5|$|Arlen Specter (February 12, 1930– October 14, 2012) was an American {{lawyer and}} {{politician}} {{who served as}} United States Senator from Pennsylvania. Specter was a Democrat from 1951 to 1965, then a Republican from 1965 until 2009, when he switched back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party.</b> First elected in 1980, he represented his state in the Senate for 30 years.|$|E
5|$|Irish {{immigrants}} generally remained loyal <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party,</b> but McKinley's {{promises of}} sound money attracted German-Americans who were appalled by Bryan's inflationary proposals. German-Americans {{had long been}} Democratic; efforts by that party to rebut McKinley, including circulating a statement by Bismarck in support of bimetallism, were ineffective. Many Catholics and recent immigrants favored McKinley because of the dislike the American Protective Association had for him.|$|E
5|$|Specter was {{instrumental}} in ensuring that the act allocated an additional $10 billion to the National Institutes of Health {{over the next two}} years. In late April 2009, facing a tough Republican primary, Specter switched <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>party</b> giving Democrats a super-majority. He was then denied seniority on Senate committees by his Democratic colleagues.|$|E

50|$|In the 2003 {{parliamentary}} election, the DSS won 17.7% of {{the popular}} vote, translating into 53 seats in the parliament. Of these 53 seats, three went <b>to</b> <b>the</b> People's <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party</b> (NDS), one <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Serbian Liberal Party and one <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Serbian <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party</b> (SDS).|$|R
5|$|Hubert Humphrey brought {{national}} {{attention to the}} state with his address at the 1948 Democratic National Convention. Minnesotans have consistently cast their Electoral College votes for Democratic presidential candidates since 1976, longer than any other state. Minnesota {{is the only state}} in the nation that did not vote for Ronald Reagan in either of his presidential runs. Minnesota has gone <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party</b> in every presidential election since 1960, with the exception of 1972, when it was carried by Richard Nixon and the Republican Party.|$|E
5|$|Racial {{politics}} {{had long}} {{played a role}} in Baltimore. As the state of Maryland did not attempt to prevent African Americans from voting through Jim Crow laws, political coalitions often involved African American community leaders. Theodore McKeldin, who served as mayor from 1943 through 1947 and from 1963 through 1967, {{was one of the first}} political leaders to work with African American community leaders. By 1999, 63% of Baltimore's registered voters were African American, and 90% were registered <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party.</b> Baltimore had not elected a Republican mayor since 1963.|$|E
5|$|Born in Philadelphia to {{a family}} active in Whig {{politics}}, Randall shifted <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party</b> after the Whigs' demise. His rise in politics began in the 1850s with election to the Philadelphia Common Council {{and then to the}} Pennsylvania State Senate. Randall served in a Union cavalry unit in the American Civil War before winning a seat in the federal House of Representatives in 1862. He was reelected every two years thereafter until his death. The representative of an industrial region, Randall became known as a staunch defender of protective tariffs designed to assist domestic producers of manufactured goods. While often siding with Republicans on tariff issues, he differed with them in his resistance to Reconstruction and the growth of federal power.|$|E

5|$|On {{his return}} to {{civilian}} life, Agnew resumed his legal studies, and secured {{a job as a}} law clerk with the Baltimore firm of Smith and Barrett. Until now, Agnew had been largely apolitical; his nominal allegiance had been <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party,</b> following his father's beliefs. The firm's senior partner, Lester Barrett, advised Agnew that if he wanted a career in politics he should become a Republican. There were already many ambitious young Democrats in Baltimore and its suburbs, whereas competent, personable Republicans were scarcer. Agnew took Barrett's advice; on moving with his wife and children to the Baltimore suburb of Lutherville in 1947, he registered as a Republican, though he did not immediately become involved in politics.|$|E
5|$|The Democratic primary for the 2010 United States Senate {{election}} in Pennsylvania {{took place on}} May 18, 2010, when Congressman Joe Sestak defeated incumbent Arlen Specter, {{which led to the}} end of Specter's five-term Senatorial career. Just {{prior to the start of}} the primary campaign, after serving in the Senate as a Republican for 29 years, Specter had switched <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party</b> in anticipation of a difficult primary challenge by Pat Toomey; Sestak was ultimately defeated by Toomey in the general election. Political observers and journalists described the race between Specter and Sestak as one of the bitterest and most watched of all the 2010 primary elections.|$|E
5|$|The midterm congressional {{elections}} of 1854 and 1855 were devastating to the Democrats (as {{well as to}} the Whig Party, which was on its last legs). The Democrats lost almost every state outside the South. The administration's opponents in the North worked together to return opposition members to Congress, though only a few northern Whigs gained election. In Pierce's New Hampshire, hitherto loyal <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party,</b> the Know-Nothings elected the governor, all three representatives, dominated the legislature, and returned John P. Hale to the Senate. Anti-immigrant fervor brought the Know-Nothings their highest numbers to that point, and some northerners were elected {{under the auspices of the}} new Republican Party.|$|E
50|$|In recent years, {{like most}} of downstate Illinois, {{opposition}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party’s</b> liberal views on social issues, along with economic problems, has caused very rapid swings toward the Republican Party. Hillary Clinton’s 2016 tally of 21.6 percent of the county’s vote is fifteen percent worse than any Democrat before 2010.|$|R

5000|$|In March 2007, Eidsness {{declared}} that he was joining <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party,</b> declaring: [...] "I am a new Democrat who can bring business savvy and fiscal restraint <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party's</b> proposals should I run for Congress in 2008 and win." [...] Media and political observers speculated that this party switch was a prelude to a second run for Congress in 2008.|$|R
5|$|New {{polls in}} January {{indicated}} voter support was growing for Toomey, who now held a projected nine percentage point lead over Specter and an eight-point lead over Sestak. Specter continued to lead against Sestak in the Democratic primary poll, {{this time by}} a 21-point margin. Some political scientists believed Toomey's gain over Specter {{could be attributed to}} voter distrust of establishment candidates and growing dissatisfaction with the health care proposal pending in Congress. However, some Democratic leaders felt Sestak's challenge to Specter was having a detrimental effect not only to Specter, but <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>party</b> in general and their prospects for ultimately winning the general election. This feeling was enhanced by the growing national support for the Republican party, and especially by the unexpected victory of the Tea Party-backed Republican Scott Brown in a special election for a traditionally Democratic Massachusetts Senate seat. Specter acknowledged to The New York Times that the national political mood might work against him in the primary, but insisted he was not discouraged and expressed confidence in his ability to survive.|$|E
5|$|The library {{has been}} criticized for not {{including}} much information about the pardons Clinton issued just before leaving office. On January 20, 2001, his last day in office, Clinton pardoned former financier Marc Rich, a fugitive who had been charged with multiple counts of racketeering, wire fraud, income tax evasion, and illegal oil trading. Rich's wife, Denise Eisenberg Rich, was reported to have made three donations totaling nearly $1,000,000 to Clinton's presidential library fund, as well as multiple other contributions <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party</b> and Hillary Clinton's senate campaign. It was later found that she only made three payments totaling $450,000 to the fundraiser. The Senate Judiciary Committee was investigating the pardon and issued subpoenas for Denise Rich's bank records because she refused to testify before the House Government Reform Committee, in accordance with her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White also launched a criminal investigation into whether the pardon had been a result of the contributions. It was later claimed that Rich had donated the funds months before asking for a pardon. Clinton maintained that the pardon had not been bought, but had been based instead on the legal merits of Marc Rich's appeal. During the 2008 U.S. presidential election, Barack Obama referenced the donations during his primary campaign against Hillary Rodham Clinton.|$|E
