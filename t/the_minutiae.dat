5|$|Heian {{culture and}} court life reached a peak {{early in the}} 11th century. The {{population}} of Kyoto grew to around 100,000 as the nobility became increasingly isolated at the Heian Palace in government posts and court service. Courtiers became overly refined with little to do, insulated from reality, preoccupied with <b>the</b> <b>minutiae</b> of court life, turning to artistic endeavors. Emotions were commonly expressed through the artistic use of textiles, fragrances, calligraphy, colored paper, poetry, and layering of clothing in pleasing color combinations—according to mood and season. Those who showed an inability to follow conventional aesthetics quickly lost popularity, particularly at court. Popular pastimes for Heian noblewomen—who adhered to rigid fashions of floor-length hair, whitened skin and blackened teeth—included having love affairs, writing poetry and keeping diaries. The literature that Heian court women wrote is recognized {{as some of the}} earliest and among the best literature written in the Japanese canon.|$|E

In August Marlborough himself left for Ireland engaged upon his first {{independent}} command – a land/sea operation upon the southern ports of Cork and Kinsale. It was a bold, imaginative project aimed at disrupting Jacobite supply routes, and one which the Earl conceived and executed with outstanding success. Cork fell on 27 September (O.S.), and Kinsale followed in mid-October. Although the campaign did not end the war in Ireland as Marlborough hoped, it taught him the significance of <b>the</b> <b>minutiae</b> of logistics, {{and the importance of}} cooperation and tact when working alongside other senior Allied commanders. It would, however, be more than ten years before he once again took charge in the field.|$|E
40|$|Fingerprint {{distortion}} changes {{both the}} geometric position and orientation of minutiae, {{and leads to}} difficulties in establishing a match among multiple impressions acquired from the same finger. In this paper, minutia polygons are used to match distorted fingerprints. A minutia polygon describes not only <b>the</b> <b>minutia</b> type and orientation but also <b>the</b> <b>minutia</b> shape. This allows <b>the</b> <b>minutia</b> polygon to be bigger than the conventional tolerance box without losing matching accuracy. In other words, a minutia polygon has a higher ability to tolerate distortion. Furthermore, the proposed matching method employs an improved distortion model using a Multi-quadric basis function with parameters. Adjustable parameters make this model more suitable for fingerprint distortion. Experimental results show the proposed method is two times faster and more accurate (especially, on fingerprints with heavy distortion) than the method in [1]. 1...|$|R

5|$|In mid-1812, Russia and the Ottoman Empire {{signed the}} Treaty of Bucharest, {{bringing}} the Russo-Ottoman War to a close. For his efforts, Karađorđe received the Order of Saint Anna from the Russians. The Governing Council scrambled {{to take an}} oath of loyalty to Russia in the hope that this would garner them further protection, to no avail. The Russian Emperor, Alexander, was aware of Napoleon's plans to invade Russia and desperately sought to return as many Russian soldiers as possible in order to repel the attack. As part of the Treaty of Bucharest, the Russians and Ottomans agreed that Serbian fortifications built after 1804 were to be destroyed, while cities and forts from which the Ottomans had been expelled {{over the course of the}} uprising were to be reoccupied and garrisoned by Ottoman troops. In exchange, the Ottomans agreed to declare a general amnesty for former rebels, as well as to grant the Serbs of the Pashalik of Belgrade some degree of autonomy. As part of the agreement, the Russians agreed to withdraw their forces from Serbia, as well as from Wallachia and Moldavia. The Russians encouraged Karađorđe and his followers to negotiate directly with the Porte regarding <b>the</b> <b>minutiae</b> of the handover of cities and fortifications to the Ottomans. Trepidation filled the rebel camp once it became clear that there was nothing to prevent the Ottomans from exacting reprisals against the Pashalik's Serb population after the Russians withdrew. Karađorđe thus refused to abide by the terms of the Treaty of Bucharest and fighting continued.|$|E
25|$|Pre-processing helped {{enhancing}} {{the quality of}} an image by filtering and removing unnecessary noises. <b>The</b> <b>minutiae</b> based algorithm only worked effectively in 8-bit gray scale fingerprint image. A reason was that an 8-bit gray fingerprint image was a fundamental base to convert the image to 1-bit image with value 0 for ridges and value 1 for furrows. As a result, the ridges were highlighted with black color while the furrows were highlighted with white color. This process partly removed some noises in an image and helped enhance the edge detection. Furthermore, there are two more steps to improve the best quality for the input image: minutiae extraction and false minutiae removal. <b>The</b> <b>minutiae</b> extraction {{was carried out by}} applying ridge thinning algorithm which was to remove redundant pixels of ridges. As a result, the thinned ridges of the fingerprint image are marked with a unique ID so that further operation can be conducted. After <b>the</b> <b>minutiae</b> extraction step, the false minutiae removal was also necessary. The lack of the amount of ink and the cross link among the ridges could cause false minutiae that led to inaccuracy in fingerprint recognition process.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Sweat pores on {{fingerprints}} {{have proven}} to be useful features for personal identification. Several methods have been proposed for pore matching. The state-of-the-art method first matches <b>minutiae</b> on <b>the</b> fingerprints and then matches the pores based on <b>the</b> <b>minutia</b> matching results. A problem of such minutia-based pore matching method is that the pore matching is dependent on <b>the</b> <b>minutia</b> matching. Such dependency limits the pore matching performance and impairs the effectiveness of <b>the</b> fusion of <b>minutia</b> and pore match scores. In this paper, we propose a novel direct approach for matching fingerprint pores. It first determines the correspondences between pores based on their local features. It then uses the RANSAC (RANdom SAmple Consensus) algorithm to refine the pore correspondences obtained in the first step. A similarity score is finally calculated based on the pore matching results. The proposed pore matching method successfully avoids the dependency of pore matching on minutia matching results. Experiments have shown that the fingerprint recognition accuracy can be greatly improved by using the method proposed in this paper...|$|R

The character has a hard time letting such annoyances go unexpressed, which often leads him into awkward situations. He is also routinely the victim of elaborate misunderstandings wherein other characters believe that he has done something morally terrible or disgusting.|$|E

Nottingham replaced Dormer with John Lumley in 1697. Before embarking on the project, Lord Nottingham consulted Sir Christopher Wren and had measurements taken at Berkeley House and Montagu House in London. The house, in an H-plan, has a pedimented central block and lightly projecting end pavilions. With its symmetrical wings and outbuildings forming a cour d'honneur, and segmental walling linking matching blocks in a larger outer grassed court, it forms one of the most ambitious aristocratic ensembles of the late seventeenth century.|$|E

40|$|The term {{biometrics}} {{refers to}} the technologies that measure and analyze human intrinsic physical or behavioral characteristics for authenticating individuals. Nowadays, biometric technology is increasingly deployed in civil and commercial applications. The growing use of biometrics is raising security and privacy concerns. Storing biometric data, known as biometric templates, in a database leads to several privacy risks such as identity fraud and cross matching. A solution is to apply biometric template protection techniques, which aim to {{make it impossible to}} recover the biometric data from the templates. The goal of our research is to combine biometric systems with template protection. Aimed at fingerprint recognition, this thesis introduces <b>the</b> Spectral <b>Minutiae</b> Representation method, which enables the combination of a minutiae-based fingerprint recognition system with template protection schemes based on fuzzy commitment or helper data schemes. In this thesis, three spectral minutiae representation methods have been proposed: <b>the</b> location-based spectral <b>minutiae</b> representation (SML), <b>the</b> orientation-based spectral <b>minutiae</b> representation (SMO) and <b>the</b> complex spectral <b>minutiae</b> representation (SMC).
