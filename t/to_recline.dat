25|$|Mexico was a {{crossroads}} of {{trade in the}} colonial period, with goods from Asia and Europe mixing with those natively produced. This convergence is most evident in the decorative arts of New Spain. It was popular among the upper classes to have a main public room, called a salon de estrado, to be covered in rugs and cushions for women <b>to</b> <b>recline</b> in Moorish fashion. Stools and later chairs and settees were added for men. Folding screens were introduced from Japan, with Mexican-style ones produced called biombos The earliest of these Mexican made screens had oriental designs but later ones had European and Mexican themes. One {{example of this is}} a screen with the conquest of Mexico one side and an aerial view of Mexico City on the other at the Franz Mayer Museum.|$|E

40|$|Although high-flexion TKA designs aim {{to safely}} {{accommodate}} deep flexion, {{it is unknown}} how often patients use deep flexion outside the laboratory. We used a validated smart-activity monitor to document the prevalence of knee flexion greater than 90 ° in 20 consecutive patients (21 knees) who had high-flexion TKAs, at a minimum of 2  years’ followup. Patients wore the device continuously for a mean of 35. 7  ±  0. 5  hours. The 21 knees flexed more than 90 ° {{for an average of}} 10  ±  3. 8  minutes (0. 5 %). Activities performed with flexion greater than 90 ° were, on average, 70 % in single-limb stance, 12 % moving from sitting to standing, 8 % walking, 7 % moving from standing <b>to</b> <b>reclining,</b> 2 % stepping, 0. 9 % moving from lying to standing, and 0. 1 % running. Eight knees flexed greater than 120 ° for an average of 2. 2  minutes (range, 0. 2 – 15  minutes), or 0. 1 % of the testing time. Activities performed with flexion greater than 120 ° were, on average, 90 % in single-limb stance, 6 % moving from sitting to standing, 3 % walking, 0. 6 % moving from standing <b>to</b> <b>reclining,</b> 0. 3 % stepping, and 0. 1 % moving from lying to standing.
