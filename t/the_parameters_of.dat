5|$|Motor {{learning}} {{is the ability}} to refine patterns of body movement by practicing, or more generally by repetition.

5|$|One of {{the most}} common methods for {{estimating}} <b>the</b> <b>parameters</b> <b>of</b> a distribution from data, the method of maximum likelihood (MLE), can break down in various cases, such as involving certain mixtures of continuous distributions. In these cases the method of maximum spacing estimation may be successful.|$|E

5|$|Kind of Blue {{is based}} entirely on modality, in {{contrast}} to Davis's earlier work with the hard bop style of jazz and its complex chord progression and improvisation.

5|$|The {{existence}} of a neutral atmosphere implies that an ionosphere should exist, because oxygen molecules are ionized by the impacts of the energetic electrons coming from the magnetosphere and by solar EUV radiation. However, {{the nature of the}} Ganymedian ionosphere is as controversial as the nature of the atmosphere. Some Galileo measurements found an elevated electron density near Ganymede, suggesting an ionosphere, whereas others failed to detect anything. The electron density near the surface is estimated by different sources to lie in the range 400–2,500cm−3. As of 2008, <b>the</b> <b>parameters</b> <b>of</b> the ionosphere of Ganymede are not well constrained.|$|E
5|$|The kulintang player’s {{ability to}} improvise within <b>the</b> <b>parameters</b> <b>of</b> a rhythmic mode is a must.

This occurs at the discretion of the kulintang player. Therefore, the kulintang player functions not only as the one carrying the melody, but also as the conductor of the entire ensemble. She determines the length of each rendition and could change the rhythm at any time, speeding up or slowing down, accord to her personal taste and the composition she plays.|$|E
