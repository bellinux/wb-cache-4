5|$|Scott—still unsure who his {{ships were}} firing at, and afraid <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> be firing {{on his own}} destroyers—ordered a ceasefire at 23:47, {{although}} not every ship complied. Scott ordered Farenholt to flash her recognition signals and upon observing that Farenholt was close to his formation, he ordered the fire resumed at 23:51.|$|E
5|$|The port stops being {{mentioned}} {{during the}} Ayyubid and Mamluk periods, making {{it likely that}} it was destroyed by the Muslims {{along with the other}} port cities, due to fears <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> again be used by Crusader invasions from the sea. With the destruction of the port city, its inland counterpart regains its importance.|$|E

60|$|Frank's face {{became more}} serious {{than it had been}} during the {{previous}} search, as soon as they took up the double track across the fields. Before, he had felt absolutely confident <b>that</b> whatever <b>they</b> <b>might</b> find it could only tend to clear Julian from this terrible accusation; now, upon the contrary, he feared <b>that</b> any discovery <b>they</b> <b>might</b> make would confirm his suspicions that evil had befallen him. Scarcely a word was spoken as they passed along the fields.|$|R
5|$|A lack of {{preparation}} for the disaster contributed to the high death toll. Armero had been built on an alluvial fan that had been overrun by historic mudflows; authorities had ignored a hazard-zone map that showed the potential damage to the town from lahars. Residents stayed inside their dwellings to avoid the falling ash, as local officials had instructed them to do, not thinking <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> be buried by the mudflows.|$|E
5|$|Aerial {{operations}} for the incursion {{got off to a}} slow start. Reconnaissance flights over the operational area were restricted since MACV believed <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> serve as a signal of intention. The role of the Air Force in the planning for the incursion itself was minimal at best, in part to preserve the secrecy of Menu which was then considered an overture to the thrust across the border.|$|E
5|$|Although a {{fair use}} issue, Combs and Bad Boy never raised the legal {{concept of the}} fair use {{doctrine}} in their defense. This decision was questioned by some legal experts: Anthony Falzone of the Fair Use Project at Stanford Law School criticized Combs and Bad Boy for not defending the legality of sampling and suggested <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> have refused to raise such a defense because they feared it could later imperil their {{control over their own}} music.|$|E

5|$|At the Greene farm, Hershel {{reveals that}} Carl needs major surgery to live, {{and that he}} will need a respirator. Otis {{suggests}} <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> find supplies at a nearby high school—where the Federal Emergency Management Agency has set up a trailer—although the place is likely overrun with walkers. Otis and Shane decide to get the supplies, while Maggie retrieves Lori from the group and brings her to the Greene home. Rick and Hershel discuss the walker epidemic; Rick believes there is no cure, while Hershel has faith that there could be one.|$|E
5|$|During the Flavian dynasty, the princes of the Iazyges {{were trained}} in the Roman army, officially as an honor, but in reality serving as a hostage, because the kings held {{absolute}} power over the Iazyges. There were offers from the princes of the Iazyges to supply troops, but these were denied based on the fear <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> revolt or desert in a war.|$|E
5|$|In 1879, Camille Flammarion {{noted that}} the comets 1862 III and 1889 III had aphelia of 47 and 49AU, respectively, {{suggesting}} <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> mark the orbital radius of an unknown planet that had dragged them into an elliptical orbit. Astronomer George Forbes concluded {{on the basis of}} this evidence that two planets must exist beyond Neptune. He calculated, based on the fact that four comets possessed aphelia at around 100AU and a further six with aphelia clustered at around 300AU, the orbital elements of a pair of hypothetical trans-Neptunian planets. These elements concorded suggestively with those made independently by another astronomer named David Peck Todd, suggesting to many <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> be valid. However, sceptics argued that the orbits of the comets involved were still too uncertain to produce meaningful results. George Forbes is today considered to be the first describing Planet Nine.|$|E

5|$|In October 2013, NFL {{commissioner}} Roger Goodell {{announced plans}} to revisit the idea to expand the playoffs to 14 teams, with the increased revenue gained from the two additional postseason games being used to offset plans to shorten the preseason. The two extra Wild Card games could also be scheduled on the weekend, creating triple-headers on both Saturday and Sunday. Goodell then suggested <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> instead be played on Friday and/or Monday, which may eventually cause scheduling conflicts with games of the new College Football Playoff.|$|E
5|$|Literacy {{began to}} decline, perhaps dramatically, during the socio-political Crisis of the Third Century. Although the Church Fathers were well-educated, they {{regarded}} Classical literature as dangerous, if valuable, and reconstrued it through moralizing and allegorical readings. Julian, the only emperor after {{the conversion of}} Constantine to reject Christianity, banned Christians from teaching the Classical curriculum, on the grounds <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> corrupt the minds of youth.|$|E
5|$|Spectroscopic studies first {{revealed}} {{the presence of}} a planet around HD 209458 on November 5, 1999. Astronomers had made careful photometric measurements of several stars known to be orbited by planets, in the hope <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> observe a dip in brightness caused by the transit of the planet across the star's face. This would require the planet's orbit to be inclined such that it would pass between the Earth and the star, and previously no transits had been detected.|$|E

5|$|The first {{manslaughter}} {{charge was}} in March 1888, when Abby H. Corner, a practitioner in Medford, Massachusetts, attended {{to her daughter}} during childbirth; the daughter bled to death and the baby did not survive. The defense argued <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> have died even with medical attention, and Corner was acquitted. To the dismay of the Christian Scientists' Association (the secretary resigned), Eddy distanced herself from Corner, telling the Boston Globe that Corner had only attended the college for one term and had never entered the obstetrics class.|$|E

60|$|This {{was much}} {{the fate of}} our three travelers, only <b>that</b> <b>they</b> {{seemed to be the}} better {{furnished}} for traveling, and had it in their view to go farther off; for, as to the first, they did not propose to go farther than one day's journey, <b>that</b> so <b>they</b> <b>might</b> have intelligence every two or three days how things were at London.|$|R
5|$|While Rastignac desires {{wealth and}} social status, Goriot longs {{only for the}} love of his daughters: a longing that borders on idolatry. Because he {{represents}} bourgeois wealth acquired through trade– and not aristocratic primitive accumulation– his daughters are happy to take his money, but will see him only in private. Even as he is dying in extreme poverty, {{at the end of the}} book, he sells his few remaining possessions to provide for his daughters so <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> look splendid at a ball.|$|E
5|$|Around 1844, {{she married}} a free black man named John Tubman. Although {{little is known about}} him or their time together, the union was {{complicated}} because of her slave status. Since the mother's status dictated that of children, any children born to Harriet and John would be enslaved. Such blended marriages – free people of color marrying enslaved people – were not uncommon on the Eastern Shore of Maryland, where by this time, half the black population was free. Most African-American families had both free and enslaved members. Larson suggests <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> have planned to buy Tubman's freedom.|$|E
5|$|Hippopotamuses {{have been}} the {{subjects}} of various African folktales. According to a San story; when the Creator assigned each animal its place in nature, the hippos {{wanted to live in}} the water, but were refused out of fear <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> eat all the fish. After begging and pleading, the hippos were finally allowed to live in the water on the conditions that they would eat grass instead of fish and would fling their dung {{so that it can be}} inspected for fish bones. In a Ndebele tale, the hippo originally had long, beautiful hair, but was set on fire by a jealous hare and had to jump into a nearby pool. The hippo lost most of his hair and was too embarrassed to leave the water.|$|E
