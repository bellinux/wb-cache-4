One {{specific}} area of her research {{is how the}} chemical composition of magma and crystals that form during eruption can provide information {{about the amount of}} water present during the eruption and explain how explosive it was. She undergoes this research by using microanalysis and modeling of volatile diffusion along small melt tubes and embayments, found in olivine crystals. She has done field work around the ring of fire, Philippines, Nicaragua, Iceland, and across the southwest United States as well as the Aleutian Islands. Plank serves on the Executive Committee of the Deep Carbon Observatory.Two of her other main research contributions have been to the understanding of magma generation and crustal recycling at subduction zones. This is accomplished by geochemical observation of olivine minerals present in lavas. Her research focuses on magmas that evolve due to the plate tectonic cycle, namely subduction zones. More specifically, Plank has published notable papers tracing sediments from sea floors to their ultimate end as lava from arc volcanoes. This ‘creation’ of magma from sediments, how sediments decompress and at what temperature and water content, has remained the research in which she is most invested and interested.One of Dr. Planks most notable works came from a collaboration with Langmuir in 1998. Not only did The chemical composition and its consequences for the crust and mantle provided a linkage in chemical composition between subducting ocean sediment and the composition of lava from arc volcanoes, but also it called for a development of a global subducting sediment (GLOSS) composition and flux similar to upper continental crust (UCC). Plank has since updated GLOSS to GLOSS-II in her 2014 publication, Chemical composition of subducting sediments.In one of her most recent papers, Thermal structure and melting conditions in the mantle beneath the Basin and Range province from seismology and petrology, a collaboration with D.W. Forsyth, Plank revised a mantle-melt <b>thermobarometer.</b> They did this revision to show more precise pressure and temperature equilibrium estimates of mantle melt in the Basin and Range region of the United States.|$|E

40|$|Presented {{here is a}} {{suite of}} new {{experiments}} aimed at quantifying the effects of pressure, temperature, bulk composition, and H[subscript 2]O content on the stability and composition of amphibole in the Earth’s mantle. Experiments have been performed from 2 to 4 GPa and 950 to 1100 °C on fertile and depleted mantle compositions. H[subscript 2]O contents of most experiments are 0. 65 wt%. In the fertile mantle composition, pargasitic amphibole is stable up to ~ 3. 8 GPa at 1000 °C, approximately 0. 5 GPa higher than any previous study. The upper stability limit of amphibole in depleted mantle is 0. 7 GPa and 40 °C lower than in fertile mantle. The addition of 3 wt% H[subscript 2]O to fertile mantle destabilizes amphibole by 0. 5 GPa and 40 °C relative to the 0. 65 wt% H[subscript 2]O experiments. Compared to existing experiments on amphibole stability, these experiments indicate that pargasitic amphibole may be stable in mantle lithosphere to almost 4 GPa (0. 5 GPa higher (15 km deeper) than previously thought). The extremely strong destabilizing effect of H[subscript 2]O suggests that deeper portions of the strongly fluid-fluxed mantle wedge may be amphibole-free even at low temperatures near the slab–wedge interface. The molar alkali content of amphibole is {{shown to be a}} linear function (R[superscript 2] = 0. 98) of pressure and temperature and is relatively insensitive to bulk compositional differences between fertile and depleted mantle. This relationship is used to produce an empirical <b>thermobarometer</b> for pargasite-bearing spinel and garnet lherzolites.

Growth zoning in the inner segments of garnets is well preserved in the granulite belt. By contrast, garnets in the arnphibolite belt have no composition variations in the inner segments, but show growth zoning in the outer segments. This may imply different incipient metamorphic history for the two metamorphic belts. However, both reaction tex-tures and composition trends that reflect the decompression process are commonly in both of the two belts. Pressure decreased about 0. 70 and 0. 8 5 GPa for the granulite and the amphibolite belts, respectively, estimated from mineral <b>thermobarometers.</b> The metamorphic P-T paths are characteristic of collision and subduction, implying that the Dabie Complex underwent rapid subsidence and rapid tectonic uplift.

40|$|The {{following}} {{article presents}} {{constraints of the}} stability of Mg-rich (Mg/(Mg + Fe 2 +) > 0. 5) calcic amphibole in both calc-alkaline and alkaline magmas, testing of previous <b>thermobarometers,</b> and formulation of new empirical equations that take into consideration {{a large amount of}} literature data (e. g. more than one thousand amphibole compositions among experimental and natural crystals). Particular care has been taken in choosing a large number of natural amphiboles and selecting quality experimental data from literature. The final database of experimental data, composed of 61 amphiboles synthesized in the ranges of 800 1, 130 °C and 130 – 2, 200 MPa, indicates that amphibole crystallization occurs in a horn-like P–T stability field limited by two increasing curves (i. e. the thermal stability and an upper limit), which should start to bend back to higher pressures. Among calcic amphiboles, magnesiohornblendes and tschermakitic pargasites are only found in equilibrium with calc-alkaline melts and crystallize at relatively shallow conditions (P up to ~ 1 GPa). Kaersutite and pargasite are species almost exclusively found in alkaline igneous products, while magnesiohastingsite is equally distributed in calc-alkaline and alkaline rocks. The reliability of previous amphibole applications was checked using the selected experimental database. The results of this testing indicate that none of the previous <b>thermobarometers</b> can be successfully used to estimate the P, T and fO 2 {{in a wide range of}} amphibole crystallization conditions. Multivariate leastsquare analyses of experimental amphibole compositions and physico-chemical parameters allowed us to achieve a new thermobarometric model that gives reasonably low uncertainties (T ± 23. 5 °C, P ± 11. 5 %, H 2 Omelt ± 0. 78 wt%) for calc-alkaline and alkaline magmas in a wide range of P–T conditions (up to 1, 130 °C and 2, 200 MPa) and ∆NNO values (± 0. 37 log units) up to 500 MPa. The AK-[4]Al relation in amphibole can be readily used to distinguish crystals of calc-alkaline liquids from those of alkaline magmas. In addition, several chemometric equations allowing to estimate the anhydrous composition of the melts in equilibrium with amphiboles of calc-alkaline magmas were derived...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is composed}} of two manuscripts about the evolution of Mutnovsky Volcano in Kamchatka, Russia. Mutnovsky has been active for the past approximately 80, 000 years, during which there was the formation and subsequent eruption of four major stratocones. These four eruptive centers, named Mutnovsky I, II, III, and IV from oldest to youngest, {{have a range of}} erupted product compositions from basalt to dacite. The first major goal of this project was to investigate the melt source for Mutnovsky. Whole rock trace element and Nd, Sr, and Pb isotopic data were used to determine that the melt source was fluid flux melting of the mantle wedge with very little crustal or slab surface sediment-melt input. The second major goal of this project was to determine the cause of the compositional heterogeneity of erupted products at Mutnovsky. Whole rock geochemical modeling demonstrated that melts were generated both above and below the garnet/spinel transition at approximately 67 km depth in the mantle wedge. Different degrees of partial melting of these two mantle compositions, followed by fractional crystallization, was initially determined to be the cause of the range of compositions found at Mutnovsky. However, melt inclusion data collected later provided new insight into magmatic differentiation processes. Melt inclusion data have a much wider range of values for the major and trace elements than the whole rock data; whole rock compositions fall along mixing lines between the most and least evolved melt inclusion compositions. This observation, combined with mafic enclaves found in more felsic hosts in whole rock samples and a variety of types of zoning found in plagioclase, indicate that magma mixing is the major cause of the compositional heterogeneity at Mutnovsky. The third major goal {{of this study was to}} determine the structure of the preeruptive magma storage system for Mutnovsky. Two <b>thermobarometers,</b> orthopyroxene-liquid (Putirka, 2008) and clinopyroxene-liquid (Putirka et al., 2003), were used to determine the depths of pyroxene-melt equilibrium and thus the depths of magma stagnation.

40|$|Abstract Geochemical, {{microstructural}} and petrological {{analyses were}} conducted on metapelites from the Strafford Dome, Vermont. Samples record metamorphic conditions from biotite to peak kyanite/staurolite grade and preserve microstructures related to two Acadian nappe emplacement events. The {{purpose of this study}} was to test the validity and application of the Ti-in-quartz (“TitaniQ”) <b>thermobarometer</b> to constraining pressure-temperature-timing-deformation (P-T-t-D) paths in metamorphic tectonites. Due to the nearly ubiquitous presence of quartz in continental rocks, the ability to apply this method would have significant implications for improving our ability to resolve tectonic histories. Cathodoluminescence (CL) imaging on quartz was conducted to qualitatively assess the distribution of Ti in a single grain and/or compare neighboring crystals. X-ray mapping of garnet porphyroblasts was conducted to estimate P-T conditions during garnet growth to provide a framework for included quartz grains. P-T-X contour diagrams (used in P-T calculations for garnet growth) were constructed from data obtained by X-ray fluorescence analysis on bulk-rock chemistries. Secondary ion mass spectrometry analysis was conducted to constrain Ti concentrations in quartz due to the low [Ti] present in the Strafford samples (3 ̆c 10 ppm). Analysis of the samples revealed [Ti] in zoned quartz grains that can be grouped and associated with certain P-T-D conditions. A majority of quartz grains have dark cores in CL images with low [Ti] (2. 5 – 3. 5 ppm) in both matrix quartz and inclusions. Quartz inclusions in garnets that grew syn-tectonically with D 2 have bright rims 5. 5 ppm. Matrix quartz, on the other hand, has rims with much higher [Ti] (7. 5 – 9. 5 ppm). Comparing these Ti concentrations to summary P-T paths from previous studies suggests: quartz inclusions have rims recrystallized during the end of D 1 deformation, matrix grains have rims re-equilibrated at peak P-T conditions post-D 2 deformation, and the dark cores observed in CL images must be from early prograde or relics of the protolith. The evaluation of the TitaniQ thermobarometer’s application to constrain P-T-t-D histories has highlighted some potential problems and significant benefits. To use the <b>thermobarometer,</b> either T or P must be independently constrained, which is often difficult to do given the many microstructural contexts of quartz in a single sample. This study capitalized on the ability to determine the relative timing of quartz (re) crystallization relative to garnet growth. Using another trace element <b>thermobarometer</b> would be ideal (e. g. Zr-in-rutile) for greater precision, although the relevant accessory phases may not be present and constraining the timing of re-equilibration is challenging. The abundance of quartz in continental rocks and the various microstructural occurrences of quartz in a single metamorphic tectonite provides additional opportunities to constrain points on the P-T-D path than conventional thermobarometers. The TitaniQ <b>thermobarometer</b> has the potential to yield deeper insights into the tectonic history of crustal rocks than previously available.

40|$|A new {{suite of}} 173 clinopyroxene grains from heavy-mineral {{concentrates}} of the diamondiferous Novinka kimberlite (Upper Muna field, Yakutia) has been analyzed for {{major and minor}} elements with an electron microprobe to perform a thermobarometric study and model the thermal structure of the Archean Upper Muna lithospheric mantle. Scrupulous evaluation of propagation of analytical uncertainties on pressure estimates revealed that (1) the single-clinopyroxene geobarometer can be very sensitive to analytical uncertainties for particular clinopyroxene compositions, and that (2) most clinopyroxenes from Novinka have compositions that are sensitive to analytical uncertainties, notwithstanding their apparent compositional suitability for single-clinopyroxene thermobarometry based on previously proposed application limits. A test on various mantle clinopyroxenes containing different proportions of the sensitive elements Cr, Na, and Al allowed us to identify clinopyroxene compositions that produce unacceptably high propagated errors and to define appropriate analytical conditions (i. e., higher beam currents and longer counting times for specific elements) that allow precise P-T estimates to be obtained for sensitive compositions. Based {{on the results of}} our analytical test, and taking into account the intrinsic limitations of the single-clinopyroxene <b>thermobarometer,</b> we have designed a new protocol for optimum thermobarometry, which uses partly revised compositional filters. The new protocol permits precise computation of the conductive paleogeotherm at Novinka with the single-clinopyroxene <b>thermobarometer</b> of Nimis and Taylor (2000). Thermal modeling of the resulting P-T estimates indicates a ~ 34 mW/m 2 surface heat flow, a thermal lithosphere thickness of ~ 225 km, and an over 100 km thick “diamond window” beneath Novinka in the middle Paleozoic (344 – 361 Ma).

40|$|AbstractThe {{northern}} part of the Karawanken plutonic belt is a gabbro–granite complex located just north of the Periadriatic lineament near the Slovenian–Austrian border. Petrographic and geochemical studies of the Eisenkappel intrusive complex indicate that this multiphase plutonic suite developed by a combination of crystal accumulation, fractional crystallization and assimilation processes, magma mixing and mingling. The mafic rocks are alkaline and have within-plate geochemical characteristics, indicating anorogenic magmatism in an extensional setting and derivation from an enriched mantle source. The mafic melts triggered partial melting of the crust and the formation of granite. The granitic rocks are alkalic, metaluminous and have the high Fe/Fe+Mg characteristics of within-plate plutons. Temperature and pressure conditions, derived from amphibole-plagioclase and different amphibole <b>thermobarometers,</b> suggest that the analysed Eisenkappel gabbros crystallized at around 1000 ± 20 °C and 380 – 470 MPa, whereas the granitic rock crystallized at T≤ 800 ± 20 °C and≤ 350 MPa.

40|$|We present {{thermodynamic}} {{estimates of}} pressures, temperatures, and volatile activities in variably deformed, gabbroic to granitic, Cretaceous (115 – 100 Ma) batholithic and framework rocks of the Tehachapi Mountains, southernmost Sierra Nevada, California. Al contents of hornblende in granitoids imply igneous emplacement at ∼ 8 kbar in the southernmost Tehachapi Mountains, with lower pressures (3 – 7 kbar) to the north. Metamorphic pressures and temperatures for garnet-bearing paragneisses and metaigneous rocks were estimated {{on the basis}} of garnet-hornblende-plagioclase-quartz and garnet-biotite-plagioclase-quartz <b>thermobarometers.</b> Disparate results for the metaigneous rocks from the latter system point to the difficulty of applying pelite-based <b>thermobarometers</b> to rocks of contrasting composition and mineralogy. Preferred pressures cluster at 7. 1 – 9. 4 and 3. 6 – 4. 3 kbar. Incomplete knowledge of reaction histories, however, limits our interpretation of the lower pressures because they are minimum estimates. The ∼ 4 -kbar samples are all from a small area and, if our interpretation is correct, they imply a local, more shallow event superimposed on crust once residing at deeper structural levels. Garnet-hornblende and garnet-biotite temperatures are less coherent, likely owing to retrograde Fe-Mg exchange, and range from 570 ° to 790 °C, The majority of the rocks are igneous and affected by recrystallization and metamorphism during subsolidus cooling; they are not granulites. Country rock paragneisses are typically migmatized at “peak” metamorphic conditions near that of the wet granite solidus (> 690 °C). Veinlike paragenesis of garnet in the metaigneous rocks suggests formation related to the presence of a fluid phase. Thermodynamic estimates of volatile activities in these garnet-bearing assemblages suggest variable, mostly CO_ 2 -rich fluid compositions, {{in the absence of any}} pervasive fluid flux. The igneous rocks of the Tehachapi Mountains were thus intruded at depths of ∼ 30 km, making them the deepest known exposed components of the Cretaceous Sierra Nevada batholith. Metamorphism occurred at these great depths and, perhaps, locally after ∼ 15 km of uplift before ∼ 87 Ma, implying an uplift rate of 1. 2 mm/yr. (A minimum uplift rate is 0. 6 mm/yr.) This original uplift and possible subsequent uplift events may have been related to underthrusting of a block of Rand Schist from what is now the southeast, with concomitant widespread ductile deformation. The deduced pressure-temperature and uplift history is similar to those of high-pressure/high-temperature Cretaceous batholithic rocks in Salinia and the San Gabriel Mountains, but direct correlation is not wan-anted. When compared with higher-level intrusive rocks from analogous portions of the Sierra Nevada batholith to the north, the Tehachapi rocks reveal a deep batholith that is more heterogeneous and somewhat more mafic on average, but displaying a similar level of isotopic hybridization involving mantle and crustal sources. The batholith is quartz-rich at these levels, suggestive of a weak, ductile middle crust susceptible to prolonged deformation and possible delamination...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{composition}} of the phyllosilicates mica and chlorite is commonly used in thermobarometry to decipher the geological history of rocks. The <b>thermobarometers</b> that have been proposed during {{the last thirty years}} rely on the use of electron microprobe (EMP) analyses, with a spatial resolution limited to the micrometer scale. Such a resolution may not be appropriate for the size of clay particles or chemical zoning in very low grade rocks. In this respect, the transmission electron microscope coupled to an X-ray energy dispersive spectrometer (TEM-EDX) provides the proper spatial resolution in analysis. It is combined here with Focused Ion Beam (FIB) milling which makes possible in situ preparation of TEM samples with high spatial control and preservation of mineral microtextures. We test the suitability of FIB-milling for TEM-analysis of clay minerals, considering the effects of intrinsic preparation artifacts like amorphization, beam damage, Ga ions implantation and material redeposition. In addition, we evaluate a TEM-EDX analytical protocol adapted to clay minerals and yielding the FIB-section thickness at each analysis point in a non destructive way. The TEM k factors were calibrated on clay powders. A comparison between TEM-EDX and EMP analyses obtained on the same phyllosilicates in FIB and polished thin sections, respectively, shows excellent agreement, thereby validating the analytical protocol and the use of FIB-sections for the study of clay minerals. The combination of these preparation and analytical procedures opens new avenues for the petrologic study of clay-mineralbearing assemblages at an unprecedented spatial resolution...|$|R

This program (available online at [URL] provides a method to standardize raw electron microprobe data and includes functions to calculate the oxide weight percent compositions for various minerals. A set of external functions is provided to calculate structural formulae from the standardized analyses as well as to estimate pressure-temperature conditions of crystallization, using empirical and semi-empirical <b>thermobarometers</b> from the literature. Two {{graphical user interface}} modules, Chem 2 D and Triplot 3 D, are used to plot mineral compositions into binary and ternary diagrams. As an example, the software is used to study a high-pressure Himalayan eclogite sample from the Stak massif in Pakistan. The high-pressure paragenesis consisting of omphacite and garnet has been retrogressed to a symplectitic assemblage of amphibole, plagioclase and clinopyroxene. Mineral compositions corresponding to $ 165, 000 analyses yield estimates for the eclogitic pressure-temperature retrograde path from 25 kbar to 9 kbar. Corresponding pressure- temperature maps were plotted and used to interpret the link between the equilibrium conditions of crystallization and the symplectitic microstructures. This example illustrates the usefulness of XMapTools for studying variations of the chemical composition of minerals and for retrieving information on metamorphic conditions on a microscale, towards computation of continuous pressure-temperature-and relative time path in zoned metamorphic minerals not affected by post-crystallization diffusion...|$|R

The phenocryst assemblage in the trachytes is sanidine + fayalite + ferrohedenbergite + aenigmatite ± quartz ± ilmenite ± magnetite ± pyrrhotite ± pyrite. In the pantellerites, the assemblage is sanidine + quartz + ferrohedenbergite + fayalite + aenigmatite + ferrorichterite + pyrrhotite ± apatite, although fayalite, ferrohedenbergite and ilmenite are absent from more evolved rocks (e. g. with SiO 2 > 71 %). QUILF temperature calculations for the trachytes range from 709 to 793 °C and for the pantellerites 668 – 708 °C, the latter temperatures being among the lowest recorded for peralkaline silicic magmas. The QUILF <b>thermobarometer</b> demonstrates that the Eburru magmas crystallized at relatively low oxidation states (ΔFMQ + 0. 5 to − 1. 6) for both trachytes and pantellerites. The trachytes and pantellerites evolved along separate liquid lines of descent, the trachytes possibly deriving from a more mafic parent by fractional crystallization and the pantellerites from extreme fractionation of comenditic magmas...|$|E

S. Cordillera. This tonalite contains coexisting zircon, titanite, and quartz, from which we can use Ti- and Zr- trace element thermobarometry to find crystallization pressure and temperature. We obtained in-situ chemical analyses for zircon and titanite using laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICPMS), From that analysis {{we were able to}} assess equilibrium between the two minerals based upon rare earth element partitioning. Using these Ti and Zr concentrations, a temperature range of 690 - 730 ⁰C was obtained for the Triangle Mountain pluton based on the assumption of an activity of TiO 2 (aTiO 2) between (0. 6 - 0. 9) and a pressure range of (6 - 8) kbar. Alternatively, using aTiO 2 = 0. 8, and T = 720 ⁰C from the Ti-in-zircon and quartz thermometers, the titanite <b>thermobarometer</b> yields a pressure estimate of 7. 5 ± 0. 7 kbar.

40|$|The Miocene Tokuwa pluton of ‘I-type ’ granitoid {{affinity}} was emplaced discordantly into a Cretaceous to Paleogene accretion-ary {{complex and}} induced a contact aureole in which various thermally metamorphosed rocks were developed, including hornfels, metatexite, diatexite and cordierite-bearing tonalite (Crd-tonalite) of ‘S-type ’ granite affinity. The thermally metamorphosed rocks show low-pressure reaction textures culminating in partial melting. Peak P^Tconditions of 3 kbar at 7808 C are estimated {{on the basis}} of the TWQ <b>thermobarometer</b> for the garnet-bearing rocks. The rocks in the contact aureole exhibit a gradual transition from hornfels, through metatexite and diatexite to Crd-tonalite. The Sr-isotopic composition at the time of Tokuwa pluton emplace-ment at 12 Ma decreases systematically from metatexite (07100 ^ 07112) through diatexite (07078 ^ 07094) to Crd-tonalite (07067 ^ 07068); this trend is interpreted in terms of mixing between theTokuwa magma and the aureole migmatites. The field relationships, geochemical data, and isotopic data collectively suggest that the emplacement of theTokuwa pluton triggered partial melting of the surrounding metasedimentary rocks. Subsequent hybridization of theTokuwa magma with the metatexite in variable proportions produced the Crd-tonalite and diatexite. The hybridiza-tion was caused by invasion of the Tokuwa magma into the migmatite zone, accompanied by gravitational collapse of the previously crystallized wall of the magma chamber. The data presented demonstrate that even a relatively low-temperature, shallow, ‘I-type ’ granitoid pluton can induce contact anatexis and hybrid ‘S-type’granitoid formation at the intrusive contact.

40|$|Any {{quantitative}} {{interpretation of}} the formation conditions of igneous rocks requires methods for determining crystallization temperature. Accurate application of such <b>thermobarometers</b> relies on the attainment of equilibrium in the system to be studied. This may be particularly difficult in silicic magmas, where diffusivities are low and crystallization kinetics sluggish. Moreover, progressive degassing of volatile-rich magmas during ascent can result in continuous changes in effective undercooling, causing particular problems in achieving equilibrium between melt and crystals that grow in response to decompression. We consider these problems {{in the context of}} plagioclase-melt equilibria for magmas undergoing decompression and degassing-driven crystallization, using two published thermometers. The two thermometers show similar trends with key parameters but absolute temperatures can vary significantly. Analysis of decompression experiments conducted at constant temperature shows systematic variations in calculated temperature and equilibrium constant with varying decompression rate and quench pressure. This indicates that an unrecognized lack of equilibration could result in significant temperature overestimates and potentially spurious results. This highlights the need to assess for equilibrium, and we discuss problems associated with some commonly used indicators of equilibration. Finally, retrospective analysis of published plagioclase-hosted melt inclusion suites from five subduction zone volcanoes shows systematic increases in calculated temperature and decreases in equilibrium constant with decreasing H 2 O concentration. While this could represent the signature of latent heat of crystallization, we suggest that such patterns should be treated with caution unless there is clear evidence of sustained equilibrium between plagioclase and melt during decompression...|$|R

Microfabric analysis and thermobaromery, combining empirical <b>thermobarometers</b> and the self-consistent dataset of THERMOCALC, indicate that garnet websterites from the Shavaryn-Tsaram volcanic centre at the dome core were formed in the spinel-lherzolite upper mantle at pressures of 17 – 18 kbars and temperatures of 1, 070 – 1, 090 °C, whereas garnet lherzolites were derived from greater depths (18 – 20 kbars). Garnet lherzolites from the Baga Togo Uul vents near the dome edge were formed at 18 – 22 kbars under significantly cooler conditions (960 – 1, 000 °C). These xenoliths reveal reaction coronas of (1) orthopyroxene, clinopyroxene, plagioclase and spinel mantling garnets; (2) spongy rims of olivine replacing orthopyroxene and (3) low-Na, low-Al clinopyroxene replacing primary clinopyroxene. Trace-element abundances indicate that clinopyroxene from these coronas is in chemical equilibrium with the host magma. The thermobarometric and textural data suggest that lherzolite xenoliths from both sites were derived from depths of 60 – 70 km and entrained in magma at 1, 200 – 1, 300 °C. The average rate of ascent, as determined by olivine zoning, lies in the range 0. 2 – 0. 3 m s ? 1.

Magnesia clinker exhibits brilliant blue or red CL colors in these bricks. The blue CL color is generally interpreted {{to be produced}} by lattice defects or intrinsic properties of MgO crystal. The red CL color is related to impurity centers. Cr 3 +, Fe 3 +, and Mn 4 + activators are known to produce red CL color in MgO. Red to blue or blue to red CL color changes in MgO clinkers in MgO-C refractories from slag line of ladle or BOF, in fact, represent changes in local atmosphere within the refractory brick. In a reducing surrounding local CO atmosphere (in {{the center of the}} brick), the valence state of these transition metal ions are easily reduced and the blue CL is enhanced.

40|$|Four, “sub-effusive” type of nodules, {{collected}} from the uppermost layer of the Sarno (Pomici di Base - PB) plinian eruption, were studied in this doctoral research. This thesis presents new geochemical data (major/trace elements and volatiles) of both melt inclusion (MI) and minerals of the studied nodules. The main goal {{of this research was}} to constrain the formation depth of the nodules, and hence the depth of the magma chamber associated with the Sarno (PB) eruption, but later the focus shifted on the origin of melts trapped in representative minerals of the nodules. A detailed petrographic study was carried out on all four selected nodules. They have porphyrogranular texture, but they differ in terms of modal composition. Three of the four nodules contain clinopyroxene and olivine as phenocrysts (Type A nodules), whereas one contains amphibole (Type B). The groundmass in both cases is completely crystallized, and crystallized melt pockets were also recognized in the interstitial space. MI are abundant in clinopyroxenes in the nodules. All MI observed in this study are partially to completely crystallized, suggesting they cooled relatively slowly after trapping. Two types of MI can be distinguished based on petrography. Type I consists of mica, Fe-Ti-oxide minerals and/or dark green spinel, clinopyroxene, feldspar and a vapor bubble. No volatile species (CO 2, H 2 O) were detected in the bubbles during Raman analysis. Type II inclusions are generally lighter in color and they contain feldspar and/or glass and oxides. Both types of MI are randomly distributed in the crystals or occur along a growth zone and are interpreted to be primary. Some of the MI were analyzed by LA-ICP-MS without homogenizing them first, but most of the MI were heated to produce a homogeneous glass phase before analysis. MI homogenized between 1202 - 1256 °C, but mostly above 1220 °C. Type I MI can be classified as phono-tephrite – tephri-phonolite – basaltic trachy-andesite, whereas Type II MI have mainly basaltic composition. The two different types of MI also show different trace element patterns. Type I MI are more enriched in incompatible elements compared to Type II MI. The heating experiments revealed, however, that only Type I MI are representative of the crystallizing melt. The compositions of Type II MI are strongly modified by accidentally trapped An-rich feldspar. The comparative study of Type I MI and bulk rock of Mt. Somma-Vesuvius concluded that compositions of Type I MI are similar to the bulk composition of the pre-Sarno, older Somma lava rocks rather than the Sarno (PB) volcanics. Therefore, the NLM 1 - 1 a nodule and perhaps the other two Type A nodules have formed from the same melt that was erupted during the early history of Mt. Somma. The presence of older, crystallized material in the younger eruptive products indicates that the Sarno (PB) magma erupted from the same (or a deeper) magma chamber(s) that fed the older eruptions. The <b>thermobarometer</b> models estimate at least 4 kbar (~ 12 km) for nodule formation. MI were also studied in amphibole from Type B nodules. The petrographic and geochemical studies, however suggested that the compositions of these MI are strongly modified by trapping solid inclusions, including phlogopite and less commonly, apatite. Therefore, the origin of Type B nodules cannot be determined based on MI compositions. Most likely this nodule crystallized from a melt that was more enriched in light REE, but less enriched in Ti, compared to melts from which Type A nodules crystallized. <b>Thermobarometer</b> models estimate at least 8 kbar (~ 24 km) for Type B nodule formation...|$|E

This thesis addresses both objectives. In the first chapter I demonstrate that the Titanium-in-quartz <b>thermobarometer</b> (“TitaniQ”) {{can be used to}} accurately record deformation temperatures under greenschist facies conditions. In the second chapter, an experimental study, I show that the relationship between recrystallized grain size and flow stress (the “recrystallized grain size paleopiezometer”) can be used to determine the stress history of dynamically recrystallized quartz under non steady state conditions. In the third chapter I apply the paleopiezometer in Taiwan’s Hsüehshan range and compare results to independent constraints (e. g. critical taper theory and potential energy considerations). This analysis demonstrates: 1) the piezometer is accurate to within a factor of two or better under conditions at the brittle-ductile transition; 2) piezometric results are consistent with recent flow laws for quartz; 3) the activation energy of naturally deformed quartzite is > 133 kJ/mol, consistent with experimental determinations; and 4) Peak differential stress in the Hsüehshan range was ~ 210 MPa at temperature ~ 300 °C. Our results indicate hydrostatic fluid pressure and a low friction coefficient of ~ 0. 38 within the Taiwan wedge. Integrated crustal strength in Taiwan is 1. 5 - 2. 1 * 1012 N/m, consistent with the force needed to support the topography of the range.

40|$|Abstract Changes in {{deformation}} mechanism {{coupled with}} {{spatial and temporal}} variations in reaction rates can result in preservation of disequilibrium mineral compositions in rocks affected by synmetamorphic shearing. Thermobarometric calculations on such rocks may thus yield meaningless results. We use Garbens-chiefer samples from a shear zone in the Eastern Alps to {{study the effects of}} different deformational processes on calculated pressures and temperatures in samples that experienced the same overall PTt history. We focus on plagioclase, which accommodates strain by a variety of deformation mechanisms and is a key mineral in many <b>thermobarometers.</b> Plagioclase that deformed largely via dislocation creep mechanisms shows concentric chemical zoning, whereas plagioclase that experienced dissolu-tion-precipitation creep preserves complex zoning. Rim compositions in the latter domains are not necessarily the youngest compositions, nor did they typically equilibrate with other phases in the assemblage. The timing of hornblende breakdown reactions relative to changes in plagioclase deformation mechanism also af-fected chemical zoning. Samples that escaped shear strain while near the thermal maximum yield internally consistent thermobarometric results, whereas samples that experienced shearing near the thermal maximum yield scattered results. Some of the variability in the results likely represents real differences in the P–T conditions at which equilibration occurred during deformation. However, much of the variability repre-sents spurious results obtained by pairing mineral compositions that were never in equilibrium with one another. Extraction of useful P–T information from samples that experienced synmetamorphic deformation requires careful documentation of the relationships be-tween deformation mechanisms and chemical zoning in order to select appropriate mineral compositions for thermobarometric calculations...|$|R

This study applies the methods, calculations, and principles put forth in Putirka (2008) to create new sets of thermometers and barometers using previously published experimental data from martian meteorites. The experimental data P/T conditions range from 1 atm to 2. 3 GPa and from 950 - 1540 ??C, with liquid compositions that range from 40. 2 - 66. 2 wt% SiO 2, 0. 62 - 24. 5 wt% MgO and 0. 19 - 6. 77 wt% total alkalis. All new models in this study obtain R 2 values within their test data > 0. 85, with 10 out of the 12 new models having test data R 2 values _ 0. 90.
