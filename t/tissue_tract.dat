40|$|OBJECTIVES: Tissue {{engineering}} {{methods can}} be applied to regenerate diseased, or congenitally missing, urinary <b>tract</b> <b>tissues.</b> Urinary <b>tract</b> <b>tissue</b> cell cultures must be established in vitro and adequate matrices, acting as cell carriers, must be developed. Although degradable and nondegradable polymer matrices offer adequate mechanical stability, they are not optimal for cell adherence and growth. To overcome this problem, extracellular matrix proteins, permitting cell adhesion and regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation, can be adsorbed to the surface-modified polymer. METHODS: In this study, nondegradable polymer films, poly(ethylene terephthalate), were used as an experimental model. Films were modified by graft polymerization of acrylic acid to subsequently allow collagen type I and III immobilization. The following adhesion, proliferation of human urothelial cells, and induction of their stratification were analyzed. RESULTS: Collagen adsorption on 0. 2 microg/cm 2 poly(acrylic acid) -grafted polymer films rendered the matrix apt for human urothelial cell adhesion and proliferation. Furthermore, stratification of urothelial cells was demonstrated on these surface-modified matrices. CONCLUSIONS: These results have shown that surface-modified polymer matrices can be used to act as cell carriers for cultured human urothelial cells.

30|$|However, expiratory {{volume in}} one second (FEV 1) {{is the most}} widely used {{parameter}} to evaluate the disease severity with increasing airflow limitations [2, 8]. The ratio of FEV 1 to forced vital capacity (FVC) is measured with spirometry and is currently most frequently used to classify the disease state of COPD according to the Global initiative for Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) stages 1 – 4 [9]. Yet, FEV 1 correlates poorly to clinical symptoms in early stages of COPD, but slightly better in later stages of the disease [2]. A study from Evaluation of COPD Longitudinally to Identify Predictive Surrogate Endpoints (ECLIPSE) found that the degree of airflow limitation does not reflect the heterogeneity of COPD.

40|$|Abstract Background APOBEC 3 {{proteins}} are host {{factors that}} restrict infection by retroviruses like HIV, MMTV, and MLV and are variably expressed in hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic cells, such as macrophages, lymphocytes, dendritic, and epithelia cells. Previously, {{we showed that}} APOBEC 3 expressed in mammary epithelia cells function to limit milk-borne transmission of the beta-retrovirus, mouse mammary tumor virus. In this present study, we used APOBEC 3 knockout mice and their wild type counterpart to query the role of APOBEC 3 in sexual transmission of LP-BM 5 MLV – the etiological agent of murine AIDs (mAIDs). Results We show that mouse APOBEC 3 is expressed in murine genital <b>tract</b> <b>tissues</b> and gametes and that genital <b>tract</b> <b>tissue</b> of APOBEC 3 -deficient mice {{are more susceptible to}} infection by LP-BM 5 virus. APOBEC 3 expressed in genital <b>tract</b> <b>tissues</b> most likely plays a role in decreasing virus transmission via the sexual route, since mice deficient in APOBEC 3 gene have higher genitalia and seminal plasma virus load and sexually transmit the virus more efficiently to their partners compared to APOBEC 3 + mice. Moreover, we show that female mice sexually infected with LP-BM 5 virus transmit the virus to their off-spring in APOBEC 3 -dependent manner. Conclusion Our data indicate that genital tissue intrinsic APOBEC 3 restricts genital tract infection and limits sexual transmission of LP-BM 5 virus. </p...|$|R

This study aims to investigate the biodistribution, histopathological and immunological impacts of MNPs on in the liver, spleen and genital <b>tract</b> <b>tissues</b> of female mice after the intravaginal instillation. MNPs were observed within spleen and liver parenchyma as well as vaginal stroma after 3 days and 2 weeks of the instillation, and completely cleared from the vaginal stroma tissue after 6 weeks. Splenic lymphocytes of treated spleen were characterized with anisokaryosis; anisochromia. Quantitatively, the number of megakaryocyte and lymphocyte nuclei size in the spleen were highly increased after instillation of MNPs. MNPs caused acute inflammation in the liver and tarsal joints dermal.

40|$|Objective/background: Mycobacterium {{tuberculosis}} (MTB) is a {{known cause}} of refractory and recurrent fistula-in-ano. Histopathology of fistula tract and acid fast bacillus (AFB) smear of the pus are the standard procedures employed to diagnose MTB. However, {{they have some}} drawbacks. Nontubercular mycobacteria (NTM) has also been detected to cause fistula-in-ano and these methods cannot differentiate between MTB and NTM. Secondly, as these methods have low sensitivity, they could possibly be missing out MTB patients. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) has high sensitivity in detecting mycobacteria. The aim {{of the study was}} to compare the sensitivity of RT-PCR, histopathology, and AFB smear in detecting MTB in fistula-in-ano. Methods: The histopathology and RT-PCR of <b>tissue</b> (fistula <b>tract)</b> was done along with AFB smear and RT-PCR of the pus was done in all the cases as per the availability of the specimen. The histopathology, AFB smear and RT-PCR was done by same pathologists in all the cases and all the patients were operated by a single surgeon. Results: A total of 286 samples were tested in 161 patients of fistula-in-ano who were operated over a period of 1 year. The mean age was 38. 6 ± 10. 5 and male/female ratio was 153 / 8. Histopathology and RT-PCR of <b>tissue</b> (fistula <b>tract)</b> was done in 131 patients and 141 patients respectively. AFB smear and RT-PCR of pus (fistula) was done in 14 patients. Overall, MTB was detected in total of 17 / 161 (10. 63 %) patients. Out of these, MTB was detected in <b>tissue</b> (fistula <b>tract)</b> in 1 / 131 (0. 76 %) by histopathology and 14 / 141 (10 %) by RT-PCR tissue. In pus samples, AFB smear was negative in all cases (0 / 14), whereas RT-PCR detected MTB in four of 14 (28. 6 %) patients. In 17 patients detected to have MTB, four-drug antitubercular therapy (ATT) was recommended. ATT was started in 15 patients. Nine of 17 patients completed 6 months ATT and were cured. Six of 17 patients are currently taking ATT. Two patients did not take ATT; both of these have persistent symptoms of pus formation. Out of nine cured patients, two patients did not start ATT for 2 months after detection. Only after the symptoms (persistent pus discharge) continued, did they start ATT and were subsequently cured. Conclusion: RT-PCR is significantly more sensitive than histopathology and AFB smear in detecting MTB in fistula-in-ano. The routine practice of doing only histopathology and AFB smear in fistula patients might be missing a significant number of MTB cases and could be responsible for many recurrences in fistula patients. RT-PCR should preferably be done in all fistula cases and at least in refractory and recurrent fistulas...|$|R
