5|$|Globally, women's {{access to}} health care remains a challenge, both in {{developing}} and developed countries. In the United States, before the Affordable Health Care Act came into effect, 25% of women of child bearing age lacked health insurance. In the absence of adequate insurance, women are likely to avoid important steps <b>to</b> <b>self</b> care such as routine physical examination, screening and prevention testing, and prenatal care. The situation is aggravated by the fact that women living below the poverty line are at greater risk of unplanned pregnancy, unplanned delivery and elective abortion. Added to the financial burden in this group are poor educational achievement, lack of transportation, inflexible work schedules and difficulty obtaining child care, all of which function to create barriers to accessing health care. These problems are much worse in developing countries. Under 50% of childbirths in these countries are assisted by healthcare providers (e.g. midwives, nurses, doctors) which accounts for higher rates of maternal death, up to 1:1,000 live births. This is despite the WHO setting standards, such as a minimum of four antenatal visits. A lack of healthcare providers, facilities, and resources such as formularies all contribute to high levels of morbidity amongst women from avoidable conditions such as obstetrical fistulae, sexually transmitted diseases and cervical cancer.|$|E

There are numerous references to hamlets (palli) belonging to the hunter communities who resided in them (bedapalli). From the 6th century onwards, the inscriptions refer to feudal lords by the title arasa. The arasas were either brahmins or from tribal background who controlled hereditary territories paying periodic tribute to the king. The velavali who were loyal bodyguards of the royalty were fierce warriors under oath (vele). They moved with the royal family and were expected to fight for the master and be willing to lay down their lives in the process. If the king died, the velavali were required <b>to</b> <b>self</b> immolate on the funeral pyre of the master.|$|E

40|$|Evolutionary {{transitions}} from outcrossing <b>to</b> <b>selfing</b> occur commonly in heterostylous genera. The morphological polymorphisms that characterize heterostyly {{provide opportunities for}} different pathways for <b>selfing</b> <b>to</b> evolve. Here, we investigate the origins and pathways by which selfing has evolved in tristylous Eichhornia paniculata by providing new evidence based on morphology, DNA sequences and genetic analysis. The primary pathway from outcrossing <b>to</b> <b>selfing</b> involves the stochastic loss of the short-styled morph (S-morph) from trimorphic populations, followed by the spread of selfing variants of the mid- styled morph (M-morph). However, the discovery of selfing variants of the long- styled morph (L-morph) in Central America indicates a secondary pathway and distinct origin for selfing. Comparisons of multi-locus nucleotide sequences from 27 populations sampled from throughout the geographical range suggest multiple transitions <b>to</b> <b>selfing.</b> Genetic analysis of selfing variants of the L- and M-morphs demonstrates recessive control {{of the loss of}} herkogamy, although the number of factors appears to differ between the forms. Early stages in the establishment of selfing involve developmental instability in the formation of flowers capable of autonomous self-pollination. The relatively simple genetic control of herkogamy reduction and frequent colonizing episodes may often create demographic conditions favouring transitions <b>to</b> <b>selfing</b> in E. paniculata...|$|R
5|$|Despite Abi's insecurities over Jay's {{friendship}} with Lola Pearce (Danielle Harold), she and Jay remain together, and eventually Max comes {{to accept them}} as a couple. Max and Tanya continue to see each other, but when Tanya gets cancer, she keeps this to herself. Eventually, Greg and Max's fiancé Vanessa Gold (Zöe Lucker) leave Walford when the truth comes out about the affair. Abi, Ben and Lola cause trouble and Abi is arrested for stealing trainers. When Abi is mugged, Lola teaches her how <b>to</b> <b>self</b> defend. Tanya finds a pregnancy test in the bin and believes it is Abi's, before finding out about her trouble causing and calls Abi a slapper, before Lauren (now played by Jacqueline Jossa) reveals to the family that Tanya has cancer. Abi is hurt by this, but is pleased when Max and Tanya reconcile. Jay proposes to Abi and she accepts, but she is faced with a dilemma when she is offered {{the chance to go}} to Costa Rica to help with sea turtle conservation. Jay gives Abi an ultimatum, threatening to break up with her if she goes to Costa Rica but she goes regardless. When she returns several weeks later, she finds out that Jay has been involved in the murder of Heather Trott (Cheryl Fergison). Abi is upset and slams the door in his face when he tries to see her. Abi goes to visit him but when Tanya discovers they have been seeing each other, she bans Abi from speaking to him. However, they eventually reunite. Abi, {{along with the rest of}} her family, are devastated to discover that when Max was away in Manchester, he married Kirsty Branning (Kierston Wareing). Abi meets her cousin Dexter Hartman (Khali Best), not knowing they are related, and this causes Jay to be jealous until the truth of their relationship is revealed. Tanya ejects Max from the family home after discovering he loves Kirsty. Abi loses her virginity to Jay much to her parents' disappointment. Abi tries to support Lauren with her drinking problem, however, this ends badly when Lauren destroys Abi's revision notes. Abi is distraught when Tanya leaves Walford with Lauren and Oscar as Lauren goes into a rehabilitation clinic in Exeter, so Max decides to move back in with her after Kirsty confesses that she has lied about being pregnant. Abi is defensive of her father and she argues with Kirsty about it, blaming her for her family's breakdown.|$|E

40|$|A {{breakdown}} of self-incompatibility (SI) {{followed by a}} shift <b>to</b> <b>selfing</b> is commonly observed {{in the evolution of}} flowering plants. Both are expected to reduce the levels of heterozygosity and genetic diversity. However, {{breakdown of}} SI should most strongly affect the region of the SI locus (S-locus) because of the relaxation of balancing selection that operates on a functional S-locus, and a potential selective sweep. In contrast, a transition <b>to</b> <b>selfing</b> should affect the whole genome. We set out to disentangle the effects of breakdown of SI and transition <b>to</b> <b>selfing</b> on the level and distribution of genetic diversity in North American populations of Arabidopsis lyrata. Specifically, we compared sequence diversity of loci linked and unlinked to the S-locus for populations ranging from complete <b>selfing</b> <b>to</b> fully outcrossing. Regardless of linkage to the S-locus, heterozygosity and genetic diversity increased with population outcrossing rate. High heterozygosity of self-compatible individuals in outcrossing populations suggests that SI is not the only factor preventing the evolution of self-fertilization in those populations. There was a strong loss of diversity in selfing populations, which was more pronounced at the S-locus. In addition, selfing populations showed an accumulation of derived mutations at the S-locus. Our results provide evidence that beyond the genome-wide consequences of the population bottleneck associated with the shift <b>to</b> <b>selfing,</b> the S-locus of A. lyrata shows a specific signal either reflecting the relaxation of balancing selection or positive selection...|$|R

25|$|Cryptic {{self-incompatibility}} (CSI) {{exists in}} {{a limited number of}} taxa (for example, there is evidence for CSI in Silene vulgaris, Caryophyllaceae). In this mechanism, the simultaneous presence of cross and self pollen on the same stigma, results in higher seed set from cross pollen, relative <b>to</b> <b>self</b> pollen. However, as opposed to 'complete' or 'absolute' SI, in CSI, self-pollination without the presence of competing cross pollen, results in successive fertilization and seed set; in this way, reproduction is assured, {{even in the absence of}} cross-pollination. CSI acts, at least in some species, at the stage of pollen tube elongation, and leads to faster elongation of cross pollen tubes, relative <b>to</b> <b>self</b> pollen tubes. The cellular and molecular mechanisms of CSI have not been described.|$|E

40|$|Phylogenies {{indicate}} that the transition from outcrossing <b>to</b> <b>selfing</b> is frequent, with selfing populations being more prone to extinction. The rates of transition <b>to</b> <b>selfing</b> and extinction, acting on different timescales, could explain the observed distributions of extant selfing species among taxa. However, phylogenetic and theoretical studies consider these mechanisms independently, i. e. transitions do not cause extinction. Here, we theoretically explore the demographic consequences {{of the evolution of}} self-fertilization. Deleterious mutations and mutations modifying the selfing rate are recurrently introduced and the number of offspring depends on individual fitness, allowing for a demographic feedback. We show that mutational meltdowns can be triggered in populations evolving near strict selfing. Populations having survived the demographic crash are more stable than ancestral outcrossing populations once deleterious mutations are purged. The relatively rapid time-scales in which extinctions occur {{indicate that}} during evolutionary transitions the accumulation of deleterious mutations may not be the cause of extinctions observed on longer time scales, which in turn could lead to the underestimation of transition rates from outcrossing <b>to</b> <b>selfing...</b>|$|R
