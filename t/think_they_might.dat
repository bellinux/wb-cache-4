500|$|SFScope {{contributor}} Sarah Stegall {{believed the}} episode [...] "got us quickly {{back on track}} after last week's lackluster tale," [...] and called the killer revelation the greatest shock she has received on the series thus far. She continued {{that one of her}} favorite parts of the Peter-as-a-killer arc is being able to watch the emotional setbacks he is facing as a result of Fauxlivia's betrayal; she called it [...] "good characterization, and excellent acting". However, Stegall questioned why Massive Dynamic would build a machine known to be the destroyer of mankind. IGN columnist Ramsey Isler praised the writing staff because [...] "just when you <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> be stuck in old habits, they come up with new ideas and put a whole new perspective on old storylines and characters." [...] Isler continued that while [...] "'Reciprocity'" [...] isn't the most groundbreaking episode in the series, it does try a number of new ideas, and it gives us one big new plot point that could change the tone {{of the rest of the}} season." ...|$|E
2500|$|The US {{has fallen}} in love with her. We love her because she has the most {{incredible}} girl-next-door look and she's also insanely beautiful. It means women are not intimidated by her looks and guys <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> {{be able to talk to}} her. It's a fantastic combination ... people want to be around her; she's fun on a shoot … and she's not stupid, which can be a very annoying trait among some models.|$|E

2500|$|During production, {{there was}} {{criticism}} regarding the film's purported downplaying of Turing's homosexuality, particularly condemning {{the portrayal of}} his relationship with close friend and one-time fiancée Joan Clarke. Hodges, author of the book upon which the film was based, described the script as having [...] "built up the relationship with Joan much more than it actually was". Turing's niece Payne thought that Knightley was inappropriately cast, as she described the real Clarke as [...] "rather plain", and said: [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> be trying to romanticise it. It makes me a bit mad. You want the film to show it as it was, not a lot of nonsense." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{gray whale}} is {{distributed}} in an eastern North Pacific (North American) population and a critically endangered western North Pacific (Asian) population. North Atlantic populations were extirpated (perhaps by whaling) on the European coast before AD 500 {{and on the}} American coast around the late 17th to early 18th centuries. However, on May 8, 2010, a sighting of a gray whale was confirmed {{off the coast of}} Israel in the Mediterranean Sea, leading some scientists to <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> be repopulating old breeding grounds that have not been used for centuries. [...] In May and June 2013 a gray whale was sighted off the coast of Namibia – the first confirmed in the Southern Hemisphere. The round-trip journey of one gray whale has set a new record for the longest mammal migration, covering a distance of more than 22,000 kilometres across the Pacific Ocean. Her migration has shown new insight into how endangered species are making drastic changes in their life style.|$|E
2500|$|The Guardian {{reported}} in October 2016 that storage tests from [...] "Unbox Therapy" [...] and [...] "GSMArena" [...] showed the 32 GB iPhone 7 is [...] "significantly" [...] {{slower than the}} 128 and 256 GB versions, measuring data write speeds of 341 MBps on a 128 GB iPhone 7 model versus 42 MBps on a 32 GB model. October 2016 network tests by Cellular Insights showed that models A1660 and A1661 with Qualcomm modems had [...] "a significant performance edge" [...] over models A1778 and A1784 with Intel modems. Inspection of the modems {{also found that the}} Qualcomm version's ability to use Ultra HD Voice had been turned off, likely to [...] "level the playing field between the Qualcomm, and Intel variants". The report concluded with the statement that [...] "We are not sure what was the main reason behind Apple's decision to source two different modem suppliers for the newest iPhone." [...] Bloomberg {{reported in}} November 2016 that tests by researchers from Twin Prime and Cellular Insights had shown the two modems to perform similarly on some U.S. cellular networks despite one of the modems being technically capable of faster connectivity. Apple spokeswoman Trudy Muller told the publication that [...] "Every iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus meets or exceeds all of Apple’s wireless performance standards, quality metrics, and reliability testing ... In all of our rigorous lab tests based on wireless industry standards, in thousands of hours of real-world field testing, and in extensive carrier partner testing, the data shows there is no discernible difference in the wireless performance of any of the models". Bloomberg quoted analysts and technology advisers who stated that [...] " [...] don’t want one version to get the reputation that it is better" [...] and that [...] "This may not impact the fanboys, but it may make other consumers think twice about buying an Apple phone, especially if they <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> be purchasing a sub-standard product".|$|E
50|$|Kira steals {{a moment}} with Bashir and tells him what she knows. Since a {{transporter}} accident caused the last crossover, Bashir <b>thinks</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> be able to escape using another one, and tries to talk O'Brien's counterpart into helping him. Unfortunately, the beaten, put-upon Terran has little interest in risking the wrath of his superiors. Meanwhile, Kira almost succeeds in securing help from this universe's Quark, but he is arrested by Garak - the Intendant's aide, and (unlike the normal universe's Garak) a Gul in the Cardassian military - for helping Terrans escape the station.|$|R
6000|$|He laughed, {{sweeping}} aside {{her sweet}} charitable concern {{that was so}} superfluous. [...] "On the contrary, madame, I tremble to <b>think</b> what <b>they</b> <b>might</b> have made of me, and I am grateful {{to have had the}} fashioning of myself." ...|$|R
50|$|It {{does not}} profess to give biographies; {{the list of}} names adds up to 3,334 (Calamy's ejected add up to 2,465), but if all {{the names of the}} {{suffering}} clergy could be recovered, Walker <b>thinks</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> reach ten thousand (i. 200). A third part, announced in the title-page as an examination of Calamy's work, was deferred (pref. p. li), and never appeared; Calamy is plentifully attacked in the preface. Walker tried to distinguish doubtful from authenticated matter, and mentions the charges brought against some of his sufferers; but his tone was counter-productive to his argument.|$|R

6000|$|Of {{all these}} facts, Mr. Max Muller only {{mentions}} one--that many races have called themselves Snakes, and he <b>thinks</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> naturally adopt the snake for ancestor, and finally for god. He quotes the remark of Diodorus that 'the snake may either {{have been made}} a god because he was figured on the banners, or may have been figured on the banners {{because he was a}} god'; to which De Brosses, with his usual sense, rejoins--'we represent saints on our banners because we revere them; we do not revere them because we represent them on our banners.' ...|$|R
50|$|Don’t Move, Improve was a British daytime {{television}} series on ITV, {{which was about}} helping homeowners realise their dream property might be nearer than <b>they</b> <b>think</b> … <b>they</b> <b>might</b> actually be living in it.

6000|$|... "Oh, I {{know what}} they'll do," [...] moaned Codfish.

I hate people who cry over spilt milk. But when I <b>think</b> that <b>they</b> <b>might</b> lose their only son, I certainly am very much affected." ...|$|R

5000|$|The {{idea for}} the concerts had its origins in an Egyptian {{vacation}} taken by band manager Richard Loren. He returned with bassist Phil Lesh and Alan Trist to meet with officials and begin the paperwork and logistics process. Through an introduction to Joe Malone, {{a professor at the}} American University of Beirut who was formerly with the State Department, the trio had made contacts with the Egyptian government. Describing the planning, bassist Phil Lesh said [...] "it sort of became my project because I {{was one of the first}} people in the band who was on the trip of playing at places of power. You know, power that's been preserved from the ancient world. The pyramids are like the obvious number one choice because no matter what anyone <b>thinks</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> be, there is definitely some kind of mojo about the pyramids." ...|$|R
