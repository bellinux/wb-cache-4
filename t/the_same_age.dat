Another hatchling skull at the AMNH is only 4.6centimetres (1.8inches) long. Both specimens are from Mongolia.

5|$|Although {{the group}} of people at risk for SAH is younger than the {{population}} usually affected by stroke, the risk still increases with age. Young people are much less likely than middle-age people (risk ratio 0.1, or 10 percent) to have a subarachnoid hemorrhage. The risk continues to rise with age and is 60 percent higher in the very elderly (over 85) than in those between 45 and 55. Risk of SAH is about 25 percent higher in women over 55 compared to men <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>age,</b> probably reflecting the hormonal changes that result from the menopause, such as a decrease in estrogen levels.|$|E
