5|$|Doppelgänger is a 1969 British {{science fiction}} film {{directed}} by Robert Parrish and starring Roy Thinnes, Ian Hendry, Lynn Loring and Patrick Wymark. Outside Europe, {{it is known}} as Journey <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Far</b> <b>Side</b> <b>of</b> the Sun, which is now the more popular title. In the film, a joint European-NASA mission to investigate a planet in a position parallel to Earth, behind the Sun, ends in disaster {{with the death of}} one of the astronauts (Hendry). His colleague (Thinnes) discovers that the planet is a mirror image of Earth.|$|E
5|$|The deities' ongoing battles prompt {{an alien}} race called the Aurum to invade Earth for its resources. In response, the warring deities strike a brief ceasefire and unite {{alongside}} the self-proclaimed Sun God Pyrrhon {{in order to}} fight the Aurum. However, Pyrrhon betrays the deities due to wanting to claim the Aurum's power and prove himself as the strongest god in existence, which leads to him being mentally controlled by the Aurum Brain. After Pit defeats the fusion of Pyrrhon and the Aurum Brain, Pyrrhon briefly comes to his senses and sacrifices himself to banish the Aurum <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the galaxy.|$|E
5|$|The second {{battle of}} Frederikshald {{took place in}} February 1659. Harald Stake was back with 4000 men, who {{approached}} the town across the frozen inlet of Svinesund and opened artillery fire from the island Sauøya. He then let his infantry attack from the west across the river Tista. Its bridge was defended by some companies under Tønne Huitfeldt and Peder Normand. The Oppland and Østfold regiments together with four cavalry squadrons remained inside the town as strategic reserves. Bjelke, having arrived some days earlier, was {{in command of the}} Norwegian forces. The Swedes initially drove the defenders back across the Tista bridge, but were halted at the bridgehead. After heavy losses the Swedes retreated <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the river. The Norwegians then prepared for a renewed attack by fortifying the weak spots around Frederikshald.|$|E

60|$|Soames led {{till they}} had crossed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>side,</b> {{and there he}} stopped. It was the chosen site; {{but now that he}} was about <b>to</b> divulge <b>the</b> spot <b>to</b> another he had become uneasy.|$|R
5|$|However, the Germans {{were now}} {{trapped in the}} {{interior}} of Gaul, as their return route to the Rhine was barred by the Roman armies. In Julian's sector, the Caesar despatched squadrons of cavalry to lie in ambush on three roads and these successfully intercepted and destroyed the returning barbarian bands. But in Barbatio's sector, the main body of Germans were allowed to pass unmolested: Barbatio's chief-of-staff Cella rejected the urgent plea of two of his cavalry tribuni (regimental commanders) Valentinianus (later emperor Valentinian I ruled 364-75) and Bainobaudes to deploy their squadrons on a highway that they expected the enemy would use. The escaping force reached some islands in the Rhine near Strasbourg where the raiding-bands had moved their camps for safety in response to the Roman pincer movement. Nevertheless, Julian pursued them vigorously. Although without boats, his men succeeded in reaching one island, as the river had become fordable at some points due to summer drought. An entire raiding-band was surprised and slaughtered, a success repeated on a few other islands. In response, the Germans evacuated the remaining islands, removing their sutlers, baggage and booty <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the Rhine.|$|E
25|$|The 1969 science-fiction film Doppelgänger (also {{known as}} Journey <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Far</b> <b>Side</b> <b>of</b> the Sun), depicts the {{discovery}} and investigation of another planet sharing Earth's orbit {{on the opposite}} side of the Sun.|$|E
25|$|Anderson's {{next project}} took {{the special effects}} {{expertise}} built up over previous TV projects and combined it with live action. Century 21's third feature film, Doppelgänger (1969) (a.k.a. Journey <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Far</b> <b>Side</b> <b>of</b> the Sun) was a dark, Twilight Zone-style sci-fi project about an astronaut who travels to a newly discovered planet {{on the opposite side}} of the sun, which proves to be an exact mirror-image of Earth, starring American actor Roy Thinnes. Although it was not a major commercial success, Doppelganger was nominated for an Academy Award for its special effects.|$|E
5000|$|Eventually, {{the name}} was changed <b>to</b> <b>The</b> <b>Far</b> <b>Side.</b> In <b>The</b> Prehistory of <b>the</b> <b>Far</b> <b>Side,</b> Larson commented, [...] "They could have called it Revenge of the Zucchini People for all I cared" [...] as he {{was so happy to}} be eagerly {{accepted}} into the San Francisco Chronicle.|$|R
6000|$|... "Blink, {{see that}} deep wash {{running down the}} valley? It looks a good deal closer <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>side.</b> That's {{a break in the}} valley floor all right. It may be a {{wonderful}} help to us, and it may ruin our chances." ...|$|R
50|$|The artistic {{style of}} this strip had some {{similarities}} <b>to</b> <b>The</b> <b>Far</b> <b>Side.</b> For instance, <b>the</b> {{people in the}} strips were often overweight. The facial structures in Nature's Way also tended to resemble those found in <b>Far</b> <b>Side</b> cartoons, as well as having the same one-panel structure as <b>the</b> <b>The</b> <b>Far</b> <b>Side.</b>|$|R
25|$|When the Ludendorff Bridge was {{captured}} on 7 March, Major Scheller {{tried to reach}} his superiors by radio and telephone, but neither was operational. He set off on a bicycle, the only available means of transportation, to report in person and got to the 67th Corps Headquarters around midnight. Hauptmanns Bratge and Friesenhahn, {{along with the other}} Germans inside the tunnel, were captured by U.S. soldiers who had climbed over <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> Erpeler Ley. Due to the inability to communicate with other forces, the Germans in the immediate area were left to counterattack with whatever local forces they could gather. There weren't any reserves readily available and most of the essential combat units that were in the area were still on the west bank, trying to get across the Rhine.|$|E
25|$|In 1995, Simpson {{wrote that}} the {{inability}} of the British artillery adequately to respond to the changes of German tactics may have been caused by the supply difficulties in October, when the gunners lacked the ammunition to extend creeping barrages all the way <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> German defences. Guns were worn out, ammunition had three types of propellant with inconsistent characteristics, all the ammunition was damp and corrections for atmospheric conditions were insufficient to regain accuracy, without observation of targets or information on the fall of shot from artillery-observation aircraft. In 2001, Simpson described the process of forming plans by the Fourth Army headquarters to be one of consultation and negotiation with corps commanders, provided that decisions were compatible with the corps artillery plan, which was derived from the army plan. Corps then set boundaries and let divisional commanders have discretion within them. By October corps headquarters were {{aware of the importance of}} passing information from contact-patrol aircraft and other sources forward to divisions, the corps headquarters developing into information clearing-houses by the end of the battle.|$|E
25|$|The XV Corps {{divisions}} {{began to}} consolidate south of Contalmaison and repair {{the roads and}} light railway. Reports indicated that the German defence had not recovered and the 7th Division was ordered to advance into Mametz Wood {{on the right of}} Contalmaison after dark. The 17th Division reported that Wood Trench and Quadrangle Trench {{to the left of the}} wood were weakly garrisoned and that Peake Woods, half way to Contalmaison were empty. The 21st Division was relieved during the night by the 52nd Brigade, 17th Division. By the end of the day, many British officers in the area thought that the Germans were beaten and that an early advance could succeed but Rawlinson was reluctant to act without co-operation from the French. At a meeting on 3 July, the French objected to the effort being made from Longueval to Contalmaison, demanding that operations re-commence north of the Albert–Bapaume road. To prepare an attack on the German second position, the III Corps was ordered to capture Contalmaison and reach a line from Mametz Wood <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> Contalmaison, Bailiff Wood and west towards La Boisselle.|$|E

50|$|Before {{deploying}} {{radio telescopes}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>side,</b> several problems must be overcome. The fine lunar dust can contaminate equipment, vehicles, and space suits. The conducting materials {{used for the}} radio dishes must also be carefully shielded against the effects of solar flares. Finally {{the area around the}} telescopes must be protected against contamination by other radio sources.|$|R
50|$|Montes Rook is a {{ring-shaped}} {{mountain range}} that lies {{along the western}} limb of the Moon, crossing over <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>side.</b> It completely encircles the Mare Orientale, and forms part of a massive impact basin feature. This range in turn is encircled by the larger Montes Cordillera, which is separated from the Montes Rook by a rugged, ring-shaped plain.|$|R
500|$|British {{distributors}} Rank {{released the}} film under its original {{name in the}} UK {{and the rest of}} Europe. The title Journey <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Far</b> <b>Side</b> <b>of</b> the Sun was adopted in the United States and Australia, since it had been determined by Universal that the audiences of these countries might not understand the meaning of the term [...] "doppelganger". Simon Archer and Stan Nicholls, authors of Gerry Anderson: The Authorised Biography, concede that Journey <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Far</b> <b>Side</b> <b>of</b> the Sun – which has superseded Doppelgänger as the more popular title – provides a clearer explanation of the plot, but argue that it lacks the [...] "intrigue and even poetic quality of Doppelgänger".|$|E
500|$|Previously {{available}} in laserdisc format, Doppelgänger {{was released on}} NTSC Region 1 DVD in both 1998 and – in digitally-remastered form – 2008. The 2008 release included PAL Region 2 but was titled Journey <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Far</b> <b>Side</b> <b>of</b> the Sun rather than Doppelgänger. No additional material is present on the Region 1 releases; the Region 2 version includes a film trailer. While the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) has certified the film G since its original release, before the 2008 DVD release the BBFC re-rated Doppelgänger PG (from the original A) for [...] "mild violence and language". A Blu-ray version was released in Region A in April 2015 as Journey <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Far</b> <b>Side</b> <b>of</b> the Sun. In Australia, Madman Entertainment's Blu-ray Disc release included both a double-sided sleeve (enabling the film to be stored under either title) and a transfer of Fanderson's original film print.|$|E
500|$|Two {{prints of}} Doppelgänger in its {{original}} 35mm format, for UK release, are known to exist. One is retained by the British Film Institute (BFI), the other by Fanderson, the official fan society dedicated to the Gerry Anderson productions. The original prints of Doppelgänger position Ian Hendry before Roy Thinnes in the opening credits; in the Journey <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Far</b> <b>Side</b> <b>of</b> the Sun format, Thinnes is billed before Hendry. Certain UK prints alter the final scene featuring the old Jason Webb {{with the addition of}} a short voice-over from Thinnes in character as Ross, who is heard speaking a line that he says to Webb earlier in the film: [...] "Jason, we were right. There are definitely two identical planets." ...|$|E
60|$|The last of Blinky's remark forced Pan's {{observation}} {{upon the}} cardinally important point--the {{lay of the}} land. A million wild horses in sight would be of no marketable value if {{they could not be}} trapped. So he bent his keen gaze here and there, up and down <b>the</b> valley, across <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>side,</b> and upon <b>the</b> steep wall near by.|$|R
50|$|Doctor Fun was a webcomic by David Farley, {{which ran}} from September 24, 1993 to June 9, 2006. It {{may have been}} the first popular episodic World Wide Web comic strip. Doctor Fun was part of United Media's website from 1995 until 2003, and it {{eventually}} concluded in 2006. The webcomic is often compared <b>to</b> <b>The</b> <b>Far</b> <b>Side,</b> being a series of one-panel gags.|$|R
5000|$|Mare Humboldtianum (Latin for [...] "Sea of Alexander von Humboldt") is a lunar mare {{located within}} the Humboldtianum basin, just <b>to</b> <b>the</b> east of Mare Frigoris. It is located along the northeastern limb of the Moon, and {{continues}} on <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>side.</b> Due <b>to</b> its location, <b>the</b> visibility of this feature can be affected by libration, and on occasion it can be hidden from view from Earth.|$|R
500|$|In the UK, Doppelgänger {{has been}} aired on TV {{under the title}} Journey <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Far</b> <b>Side</b> <b>of</b> the Sun and has been {{formatted}} accordingly. Broadcasts have often contained inverted picture due to a mistake made in transferring the original print to videotape. Prior to a screening in the 1980s, a telecine operator viewed the print and, being unfamiliar with {{the premise of the}} film, concluded that the scenes set on the parallel Earth had been reversed in error. An additional [...] "flop-over" [...] edit restored the image to normal, which became the standard for all broadcasts but compromised the plot: if Doppelgänger is screened in this modified form, the viewer is led to conclude that the parallel Ross has landed on the non-reversed, normal Earth.|$|E
500|$|Around April 1428, Sigismund amassed {{an army of}} 25,000 infantry, 6,000 Wallachian archers led by Prince Dan II, 200 Italian artillery, and {{a number}} of Polish cavalry {{on the far side of}} the Danube, then {{attacked}} Golubac and the Turks. [...] He also had ships attacking from the river, one of which was commanded by Cecília Rozgonyi, the wife of Comes István Rozgonyi of Timișoara. [...] Murad rushed to help the besieged Turks, arriving in late May. Sigismund, who did not wish to fight the bigger army, finalised a treaty by early June. Once part of the Hungarian army had withdrawn <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the river, however, the Turkish commander Sinan Bey attacked their rear, capturing and killing those who remained, among them the Polish knight Zawisza Czarny. [...] Sigismund was nearly caught with the rest of his army; however, Cecília Rozgonyi intervened, and she was solely responsible for his rescue.|$|E
500|$|Cricket {{remained}} {{the most popular}} attraction throughout the gardens' existence, {{but there was a}} range of activities: bowling greens, a [...] "noble and conspicuous building" [...] with ground-floor billiard rooms, refreshment facilities and reading rooms and a walking area on the roof, lawns, a grotto, an aviary, fairground activities, and an artificial lake with a path leading to a maze whose centrepiece was a special swinging chair. A bizarre flying demonstration took place on one occasion, during which a businessman and associate of Ireland claimed he would fly from the roof of the main building <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the gardens. [...] When he merely sailed down a rope wearing a pair of wings and attached to a pulley, the spectators were so unimpressed that he had to escape into the maze to get away from them. The gardens soon began to decline in popularity, and Ireland sold them in 1826. Under later owners' oversight, they became overgrown, and the main building soon became unusable. Only the ornamental gate piers and the south boundary wall (on the north side of Union Road) remain.|$|E
5000|$|Loose Parts {{is a daily}} {{single panel}} comic strip drawn by Dave Blazek since 2001. It is similar in tone, content, and style <b>to</b> <b>The</b> <b>Far</b> <b>Side,</b> drawn by Gary Larson, {{involving}} Theatre of the Absurd-style themes and characters. Loose Parts is syndicated by The Washington Post Writers Group and appears in newspapers {{across the country and}} overseas. Loose Parts was nominated for Best Newspaper Panel Cartoon division award in the 2010 National Cartoonists Society Reuben Awards.|$|R
5000|$|Most often {{compared}} <b>to</b> <b>The</b> <b>Far</b> <b>Side,</b> Doctor Fun was {{a series}} of bizarre one-panel gags. Topics ranged from <b>the</b> mundane <b>to</b> <b>the</b> obscure. Farley reported that, based on the email he received, most readers were of a similar age to him and worked with computers, but that there were also a [...] "disproportionate number" [...] of nurses. Doctor Fun made various references to science and pop culture and was described by <b>The</b> Houston Chronicle <b>to</b> have a [...] "universal appeal" [...] compared to coeval webcomic NetBoy.|$|R

500|$|The {{following}} morning the Away Team {{is invited to}} witness the execution of Ramsey and his followers. Moments after Riker rejects their invitation Data makes contact and informs them {{that there is a}} 48-minute window for which Dr. Crusher has to find a cure, and for Riker to defuse the situation on the planet before the ship must leave to the Neutral Zone. On the planet, Ramsey and his men are prepared to be executed by disintegration despite Ariel's pleas, while Dr. Crusher discovers a cure for the virus. Riker is prepared to have the away team and the Odin survivors beamed to the Enterprise, but Beata announces that she will stay the execution and banish Ramsey, his men, their families, and any others that support them <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the planet. She explains that their banishment will not stop the fall of the oligarchy, but will slow it down enough that Beata will not be around to see its end. [...] The away team return to the ship and Picard, already recovering from the virus but hardly having a voice, orders the ship to the Neutral Zone at high warp.|$|E
500|$|In {{what was}} billed as the [...] "biggest main event in sports entertainment," [...] the match pitted WWF World Heavyweight Champion Hulk Hogan {{defending}} the title against André the Giant (with Bobby Heenan). Howard Finkel introduced the guest ring announcer, Bob Uecker, who in turn introduced the guest time keeper, Entertainment Tonight host Mary Hart. The fans booed André heavily and pelted him and his manager Bobby Heenan with trash as they rode the cart to the ring. In contrast, Hogan, who walked to the ring, came out to a huge ovation. Approximately two minutes into the match, Hogan attempted to body slam André, but {{he was unable to}} lift The Giant and nearly lost the match when Andre fell on him and almost pinned him. After the match had battled back and forth, André gave Hogan an Irish whip <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the ring and attempted a big boot on Hogan, but Hogan ducked it and came off the ropes to give André a clothesline to take him off his feet {{for the first time in}} the match. Hogan then [...] "Hulked up" [...] and scoop slammed the [...] Giant before hitting the ropes and executing his patented leg drop pin to get the win and retain the championship.|$|E
500|$|In {{the lower}} ground {{west of the}} Passchendaele Ridge, three months of {{constant}} shelling had blocked the watercourses that normally provided drainage. On the night of 4 October, it began to rain and continued intermittently {{for the next three}} days. Much of the battlefield again became a quagmire, making movement extremely difficult. Had the German defence collapsed during the Battle of Poelcappelle on 9 October, the reserve brigades of II Anzac Corps were to have passed through later in the day, to continue the attack <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> Passchendaele village and the Goudberg spur to the north. On 7 October, this afternoon attack had been cancelled by Haig, because of the rain and the final details of the plan for the renewed attack of 12 October, were decided on the evening of 9 October. Plumer had received misleading information about the progress of the attack that day and believed that [...] "a sufficiently good jumping-off line" [...] had been achieved, passing the erroneous information back to Haig. The decision was made to continue the offensive, to gain more favourable winter positions on higher ground, to assist the French with their attack due on 23 October (the Battle of La Malmaison) and to hold German troops in Flanders during the preparations for the Battle of Cambrai.|$|E
25|$|With {{this famous}} {{symbolic}} gesture of signing the sky, Klein had foreseen, as in a reverie, {{the thrust of}} his art from that time onwards—a quest <b>to</b> reach <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>side</b> of <b>the</b> infinite.|$|R
5000|$|The planet {{receives}} 19 {{times more}} stellar radiation than Earth. [...] The {{temperature of the}} top of its atmosphere is estimated at 500 F. The planet is estimated to be hotter than Venus, as higher temperatures may prevail near the surface. [...] (cf. Atmosphere of Venus, Colonization of Venus) It is possible that one side of the planet is cooler, because it is presumed to be tidally locked due to its proximity to its star; however, under most circumstances where an atmosphere is thick, it would be able to transfer heat <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>side.</b>|$|R
