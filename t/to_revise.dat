40|$|Although {{administrative}} law doctrine requires courts {{to defer to}} an agency’s reasonable statutory interpretation, the doctrine is unclear as to whether an agency gets less deference when it changes its own prior interpretation. We formally analyze how judicial deference <b>to</b> <b>revised</b> agency interpretations affects the ideological content of agencies’ interpretations. We find a nonmonotonic relationship between judicial deference to inconsistent agency interpretations and interpretive extremism. This relationship arises because as courts become less deferential <b>to</b> <b>revised</b> interpretations, the initial agency finds it more attractive to promulgate a moderate interpretation {{that will not be}} revised. However, the less deferential the courts, the more extreme this moderate interpretation becomes. Normatively, our results suggest that an interest in responsiveness of interpretive policy to the preferences of the incumbent leadership favors deference <b>to</b> <b>revised</b> interpretations, whereas an interest in ideological moderation favors a somewhat less deferential posture to interpretive revisions. ...|$|R

The proposal means expanding the region to cover vineyards in 357 rather than 319 villages. This is to be achieved by adding vineyards in forty villages while simultaneously removing two villages in the Marne départment that were included in the 1927 regulations, Germaine and Orbais-l'Abbaye.|$|E
