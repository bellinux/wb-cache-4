5|$|Early {{people began}} {{altering}} communities of {{flora and fauna}} for their own benefit through means such as fire-stick farming and forest gardening very early. Exact dates are hard to determine, as people collected and ate seeds before domesticating them, and plant characteristics may have changed during this period without human selection. An example is the semi-tough rachis and larger seeds of cereals from just after the Younger Dryas (about 9,500 BC) in the early Holocene in the Levant region of the Fertile Crescent. Monophyletic characteristics were attained without any human intervention, implying that apparent domestication of <b>the</b> <b>cereal</b> rachis could have occurred quite naturally.|$|E
5|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that Aldermaston was inhabited in the 12th century CE, possibly extending back to 1690 BCE. Radiocarbon dating on postholes and pits {{in the area}} show activity from 1690 to 1390, 1319 to 1214, and 977 to 899 BCE. Wheat and barley grains {{have been found in}} these excavations. Tests show that most of the barley was dehulled, but that absence of such debris may mean that <b>the</b> <b>cereal</b> was brought in from other areas.|$|E

5|$|Blackleg is a {{fungal disease}} of canola {{that results in}} major yield loss in {{affected}} crops. It overwinters on infected stubble (leftover crop residue) that is left on farm fields, and can continue to produce spores, infecting future crops, until the stubble is buried or broken down completely. The observation that C.olla grows and fruits on canola stubble has led to research on the potential of this fungus to degrade canola stubble, and {{reduce the incidence of}} stubble-borne diseases like blackleg and blackspot. In a study of its lignin-degrading abilities, C.olla was shown to colonize canola, wheat, and barley residue, but appeared to have a preference for the woody taproots of canola as compared to <b>the</b> <b>cereal</b> residue.|$|E
5|$|In 1946 until mid-1947, the Piccards were {{consultants}} to General Mills (<b>the</b> <b>cereal</b> company and dominant industry in Minneapolis) working under Otto Winzen, who Jean had met through the university. Winzen and Jean proposed a stratosphere flight with 100 cluster balloons and secured a government {{contract with the}} Navy. Featured in Navy press releases, Jean was named a project scientist responsible for gondola design and for testing the balloon film materials. But he balked, both at making weekly status reports that made him feel like a lower-level employee, and {{at the prospect of}} General Mills owning the patents to his ideas. Working as a consultant, Jeannette threatened to break off ties with the Navy and General Mills unless she was allowed to fly with Jean. Unfortunately this began a rift between General Mills and the Piccards. They were both were fired in 1947, for they were too critical of Winzen and General Mills staff.|$|E
5|$|The {{food supply}} of the country {{depended}} on cereals produced in southern Russia, while the Finns had specialized in milk and butter production. The cessation of <b>the</b> <b>cereal</b> imports from disintegrating Russia led to food shortages in Finland. The Senate responded by introducing rationing and price controls. The farmers opposed the state control; a black market with sharply rising food prices formed and export to free market of the Petrograd area increased. Food supply, prices, {{and in the end}} the fear of starvation became emotional political issues between farmers and industrial workers, in particular the unemployed ones. The common people, their fears exploited by the politicians and the political media, took to the streets. Despite the food shortages, no large-scale starvation hit southern Finland before the civil war and the food market remained a secondary stimulator in the power struggle of the Finnish state.|$|E

In addition, some research has been carried out on the international market situation and this has been reported. <b>The</b> <b>cereals</b> sector of New Zealand agriculture has grown rapidly over recent years, in spite of serious imbalances between it and other sectors of agriculture, in terms of government assistance (protection).

40|$|The {{introduction}} of new agricultural technology in Mali has been concentrated more in <b>the</b> new <b>cereals</b> (maize and rice) than in <b>the</b> traditional <b>cereals</b> (sorghum and millet). <b>The</b> new <b>cereals</b> have been emphasized for their higher productivity and for consumer 2 ̆ 7 s shift towards <b>the</b> new <b>cereals.</b> This thesis considered whether future new technology introduction should remain focused on <b>the</b> new <b>cereals,</b> or shifted towards <b>the</b> traditional <b>cereals.</b> A sector model was used to estimate the societal benefits to alternative new technology introduction policies in the traditional and new <b>cereals.</b> ^ <b>The</b> sector model results suggest that new technology introduction in <b>the</b> traditional <b>cereals</b> would provide a larger potential increase in benefits than new technology introduction in either of <b>the</b> new <b>cereals.</b> <b>The</b> model results reflect two advantages to <b>the</b> traditional <b>cereals.</b> One is that although <b>the</b> new <b>cereals</b> have higher productivity, traditional cereals have larger potential yield increases with new technology introduction. Diminishing returns are likely to accompany further new technology introduction in <b>the</b> new <b>cereals</b> given <b>the</b> considerable intensification they have already experienced. The other advantage is that <b>the</b> traditional <b>cereals</b> require less stringent growing conditions. Mali 2 ̆ 7 s dry climate and harsh geography are better suited to <b>the</b> traditional <b>cereals,</b> so benefits from new technology introduction in <b>the</b> traditional <b>cereals</b> would be realized over a wider area and extended to more farmers. ^ Two additional policy implications were found. One {{is the need to}} accompany new technology introduction with policies that increase traditional cereal demand. Under existing demand, model results found that cereal prices would fall too quickly for technology diffusion to proceed. Promoting additional uses of <b>the</b> traditional <b>cereals</b> beyond its existing role as a staple food, through cereal processing and as an animal feed, would moderate cereal prices and accelerate technology diffusion. A second policy implication is to facilitate an increase in farmer 2 ̆ 7 s liquidity. Model results suggest that to derive maximum benefits from technological change, farmer 2 ̆ 7 s out-of-the pocket expenses would need to be doubled. While farmers appear capable of self-generating this additional liquidity without credit, monitoring farmer 2 ̆ 7 s progress as they proceed through this process of self-generating liquidity is suggested. ...|$|R
