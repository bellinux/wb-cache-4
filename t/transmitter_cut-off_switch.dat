5000|$|Seven {{standard}} airbags [...] include dual-stage front airbags, driver's knee airbag, front seat-mounted side airbags, 2-row {{side curtain}} airbags and fuel pump <b>cut-off</b> <b>switch</b> with airbag deployment.|$|R
25|$|The 2005 TL {{received}} a passenger airbag <b>cut-off</b> <b>switch</b> and indicator and extra stitching {{on the front}} seats. There were several minor changes made (such as changes in seat belt anchor mounts) which are not published.|$|R
50|$|This variant, {{which was}} built {{concurrently}} with the B I and was indistinguishable externally from that variant, was fitted with Packard-built Merlin engines. The Packard Merlins used Bendix - Stromberg pressure-injection carburettors, requiring the addition of slow-running <b>cut-off</b> <b>switches</b> in the cockpit.|$|R
25|$|On station platforms, {{emergency}} {{points are}} available with a telephone connected to the command centre, an emergency power supply <b>cut-off</b> <b>switch</b> and a fire extinguisher. The power supply system is segmented into short sections that can be independently powered, so that following an incident a single train can be stopped while the others reach the nearest station.|$|R
5000|$|FINE-C: Fuel, ignition, neutral, engine <b>cut-off</b> <b>switch,</b> choke and clutch. A {{standardized}} {{series of}} controls to engage when starting a motorcycle. Older motorcycles {{might not have}} an engine cut-off, and newer ones might not have a choke, and some types have no clutch, but remembering all 6 items, and skipping {{those that do not}} apply, is safe and effective.|$|R
2500|$|... "Deep-cycle" [...] lead–acid {{batteries}} such {{as those}} used in electric golf carts have much thicker plates to extend longevity. The main benefit of the lead–acid battery is its low cost; its main drawbacks are large size and weight for a given capacity and voltage. Lead–acid batteries should never be discharged to below 20% of their capacity, because internal resistance will cause heat and damage when they are recharged. Deep-cycle lead–acid systems often use a low-charge warning light or a low-charge power <b>cut-off</b> <b>switch</b> to prevent the type of damage that will shorten the battery's life.|$|R
40|$|A new Zigzag Super-Cut-off CMOS (ZSCCMOS) is proposed, {{where only}} low-VrH {{switches}} are used {{so that the}} ZSCCMOS can be extended to sub-l-V VDD region. A zigzagging configuration with self-saturated virtual power lines can eliminate the necessity of series-connected <b>cut-off</b> <b>switches</b> of the SCCMOS without introducing the high-voltage stress problem. In the 70 -nm technology node, the ZSCCMOS is expected to reduce a leakage current to the 1 -pA-order per gate from the 10 -nA-order per gate, achieving the 20 - 60 % faster active-mode speed and the 11 times faster standby-toactive recovery time than the SCCMOS when VD=O. 6 V...|$|R
50|$|A private tuning {{and racing}} firm, Picchio S.p.a. , created a limited {{production}} race prepared Alfa Romeo 4C. The Alfa Romeo 4C Picchio {{is powered by}} a new 4-cylinder turbo 1750 cc with 600 horsepower (CV) with a Hewland sequential semi automatic gearbox at steering wheel controls and suspensions redesigned for use with the Pirelli PZero 13 inch tires. The car is fully race prepared with FIA certificate and contains the mandatory roll cage, <b>cut-off</b> <b>switches,</b> and with all interior removed bar a new bucket seat and race harness.The prototype of this car is being used in Italian Hilclimb events, though customers can specify to have their own car built to order at a price of 296.000 euro.|$|R
50|$|Fifth is the {{on-board}} {{fire extinguishing}} system that are required. These systems are directed onto the engine itself and are activated instantly when the engine catches fire, reducing the chance for the car to completely catch fire and endanger the driver. The driver also has a manual activation control available. This {{has been in place}} on all cars since 1983, when an engine explosion and fire came very close to killing then-Funny Car driver Mike Dunn. All enclosed body cars must have a five-inch circular opening which will accept the nozzle of a fire extinguisher triggered by safety personnel. All vehicles must have a clearly marked fuel pump <b>cut-off</b> <b>switch</b> on a rear panel.|$|R
5000|$|The Safari Storme {{has more}} {{passenger}} cabin space. In India, the top variant comes with Dual Airbags, ABS(Anti Lock Braking System), and EBD(Electronic Brake Force Distribution), Electronic Shift on fly 4 by 4 Mechanism, Limited Slip Differential, Fuel <b>Cut-Off</b> Inertia <b>Switch</b> for safety {{in a crash}} to reduce risks of/intensity of fire.The interior is improved and is of higher quality.|$|R
5000|$|Accidents {{most often}} occur in {{collisions}} with other off-road vehicles, and are frequently {{the result of}} not being seen. In many dune areas, all sand vehicles (motorcycles, quads, sandrails,UTVs and sandcars) are required to use an eight-foot antenna whip and flag. This is critical to being seen by other vehicles as a driver traverses from one dune to the next. Most sandrails employ a variety of safety features for the driver and passengers. The most common {{is the use of}} a three-point safety belt system. Many sand rails also utilize roll bar padding and fire extinguishers. More advanced safety features sometimes include: arm and wrist restraints, netting for large frame openings, automatic fuel <b>cut-off</b> <b>switches</b> and horns. Additionally, the use of eye protection (goggles and ballistic-grade glasses) is considered a necessity. Finally, the use of helmets while [...] "duning" [...] is increasing due to the advances in performance. Sand associations along with state and federal land management agencies work to provide dune safety information through pamphlets, online and in classes.|$|R
50|$|Once Montoya {{made his}} pit stop, Kenseth became the leader, but after one lap {{he chose to}} make a pit stop, giving the lead to Patrick Carpentier. Carpentier made a pit stop on lap 84, which {{resulted}} in Kyle Busch reclaiming the lead. Kyle Busch had a 3.6 second lead by lap 87. Five laps later, Menard took over the seventh position, after passing Harvick. Then, on lap 95, Kyle Busch reported his throttle was sticking. To fix this problem, Busch used the <b>cut-off</b> <b>switch</b> (a switch {{on the back of}} the steering wheel to slow the car). Four laps later, Menard fell to the eighth position. On the following lap, Regan Smith was passed by Kyle Busch, putting him a lap behind. Busch reported to his crew that his throttle was improving on lap 105. On the following lap, debris caused the fourth caution. All the front runners made pit stops during the caution, and Johnson reported to his crew that he and Bowyer had collided on pit road. Kyle Busch led the drivers on the restart, ahead of Gordon, Montoya, Biffle, and Logano. One lap later, Biffle moved to second, as Hamlin claimed fifth.|$|R
40|$|In {{view of the}} {{low power}} of {{traditional}} DC-DC converters, a DC-DC converter with a kilowatt power is designed. The input signal's frequency is 1 kHz and the duty cycle is 5 %. The PWM signal controls the high-speed conduction or <b>cut-off</b> of the <b>switch</b> tube. The input DC voltage is 36 V, and the output voltage is {{twice as high as}} the input voltage. The output power is greater than 1 KW; the circuit conversion efficiency is 87. 21 %...|$|R
50|$|In operation, {{progressive}} cavity {{pumps are}} fundamentally fixed flow rate pumps, like piston pumps and peristaltic pumps, and {{this type of}} pump needs a fundamentally different understanding than the types of pumps to which people are more commonly introduced, namely ones that {{can be thought of}} as generating pressure. This can lead to the mistaken assumption that all pumps can have their flow rates adjusted by using a valve attached to their outlet, but with this type of pump this assumption is a problem, since such a valve will have practically no effect on the flow rate and completely closing it will involve very high pressures being generated. To prevent this, pumps are often fitted with <b>cut-off</b> pressure <b>switches,</b> rupture discs (deliberately weak and easily replaced), or a bypass pipe that allows a variable amount of a fluid to return to the inlet. With a bypass fitted, a fixed flow rate pump is effectively converted to a fixed pressure one.|$|R
30|$|To {{obtain the}} {{equilibrium}} structures of these fibrils, we utilized NAMD package [46] with CHARMM 27 force field [47]. Here, the fibril was solvated using explicit water molecules modeled as TIP 3 P. Here, {{the box of}} explicit water molecules is constructed {{in such a way}} that the distance between the outer surface of water box and the fibril is set to be 2 nm. Before, equilibration, we performed energy minimization process using conjugate gradient method with 10, 000 steps. The <b>cut-off</b> and <b>switching</b> distance for non-bonded interactions is set to be 1 and 1.2 nm, respectively. Then, the fibril structure is equilibrated for 50 ns under NPT ensemble at 310 K and 1 atm with time step of 2 fs based on SHAKE algorithm. For NPT ensemble-based molecular dynamics simulations, the particle mesh Ewald (PME) is used with PME size of 0.9 nm. The equilibrium dynamics simulation based on NPT ensemble was conducted based on Langevin thermostat and Nose-Hoover barostat in order to make the temperature and pressure be constant. The equilibrium dynamics trajectories and energy values are recorded for every 2 and 0.2 ps, respectively.|$|R
40|$|Short channel {{effects of}} single-gate and double-gate {{graphene}} nanoribbon field effect transistors (GNRFETs) are studied {{based on the}} atomistic pz orbital model for the Hamiltonian of graphene nanoribbon using the nonequilibrium Green’s function formalism. A tight-binding Hamiltonian with an atomistic pz orbital basis set is {{used to describe the}} atomistic details in the channel of the GNRFETs. We have investigated the vital short channel effect parameters such as Ion and Ioff, the threshold voltage, the subthreshold swing, and the drain induced barrier lowering versus the channel length and oxide thickness of the GNRFETs in detail. The gate capacitance and the transconductance of both devices are also computed in order to calculate the intrinsic <b>cut-off</b> frequency and <b>switching</b> delay of GNRFETs. Furthermore, the effects of doping of the channel on the threshold voltage and the frequency response of the double-gate GNRFET are discussed. We have shown that the single-gate GNRFET suffers more from short channel effects if compared with those of the double-gate structure; however, both devices have nearly the same cut-off frequency in the range of terahertz. This work provides a collection of data comparing different features of short channel effects of the single gate with those of the double gate GNRFETs. The results give a very good insight into the devices and are very useful for their digital applications...|$|R
