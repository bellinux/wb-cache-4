50|$|The {{following}} spring {{was one of}} the coldest on record and as a result, Noblesse was very slow to come to hand, meaning that Prendergast was unable to get her ready in time for the 1,000 Guineas at Newmarket. She eventually re-appeared at York in May for the Musidora Stakes, a recognised trial for the Oaks at Epsom. She quickened away from her rivals inside the final two furlongs <b>to</b> win <b>eased</b> <b>down</b> by six lengths. This resulted in her starting as the 11/4-on favourite for the Oaks a few weeks later.|$|R
50|$|Golden Cygnet ran twice more. First, {{he headed}} to the Fairyhouse Easter Festival for the Fingal Hurdle, a race for the best novices in Ireland. As in {{previous}} races, he had little difficulty in disposing of his eight opponents, coming home <b>to</b> win <b>eased</b> <b>down</b> by 10 lengths (Form Book: 2/7 Fav, waited with, 2nd 4 out, disputed lead approaching next, soon led, quickened clear approaching last, impressive). It {{was expected to be}} his last race of the season, but he was so well in himself afterwards that connections decided to enter him in the Scottish Champion Hurdle at Ayr 18 days later.|$|R
60|$|Reuben soon {{checked the}} speed of his horse. Anxious as he was to arrive as soon as possible, he might, for aught he knew, yet have {{occasion}} to try the animal to the utmost; and he therefore reduced the almost racing pace, at which he had started, into an ordinary steady gallop. The horses were fresh and in good condition, and for several miles kept up the pace without flagging. Then they were allowed <b>to</b> <b>ease</b> <b>down</b> into a walk, until they got their wind again; and then started at the pace, half canter, half gallop, which is the usual rate of progression of the colonial horses. They drew rein at last on a slight eminence, from which the Donalds' station, {{a mile or so}} distant, could be perceived.|$|E
6000|$|And that night, {{coming out}} of the cannery, he was interviewed by his fellow workmen, who were very angry and incoherently slangy. He failed to {{comprehend}} the motive behind their action. The action itself was strenuous. When he refused <b>to</b> <b>ease</b> <b>down</b> his pace and bleated about freedom of contract, independent Americanism, and the dignity of toil, they proceeded to spoil his pace-making ability. It was a fierce battle, for Drummond was a large man and an athlete, but the crowd finally jumped on his ribs, walked on his face, and stamped on his fingers, so that it was only after lying in bed for a week {{that he was able to}} get up and look for another job. All of which is duly narrated in that first book of his, in the chapter entitled [...] "The Tyranny of Labour." ...|$|E

60|$|We were {{discharging}} sugar at Charleston, in {{very heavy}} casks. The tide being in, the vessel's rail {{was higher than}} the wharf, and we landed the casks on the rail, from which they were rolled down some planks to the shore. Two negroes were stationed on the wharf to receive the casks, and <b>to</b> <b>ease</b> them <b>down.</b> One of these fellows was {{in the practice of}} running up the planks, instead of standing at their side and holding on {{to the end of the}} hogsheads. I remonstrated with him several times about the danger he ran, but he paid no attention to what I said. At length my words came true; a cask got away from the men, and rolled directly over this negro, flattening him like a bit of dough.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Suddenly Tamb' Itam saw Jim {{catch her}} arms, trying to unclasp her hands. She hung on {{them with her}} head fallen back; her hair touched the ground. [...] "Come here!" [...] his master called, and Tamb' Itam helped <b>to</b> <b>ease</b> her <b>down.</b> It was {{difficult}} to separate her fingers. Jim, bending over her, looked earnestly upon her face, {{and all at once}} ran to the landing-stage. Tamb' Itam followed him, but turning his head, he saw that she had struggled up to her feet. She ran after them a few steps, then fell down heavily on her knees. [...] "Tuan! Tuan!" [...] called Tamb' Itam, [...] "look back;" [...] but Jim was already in a canoe, standing up paddle in hand. He did not look back. Tamb' Itam had just time to scramble in after him when the canoe floated clear. The girl was then on her knees, with clasped hands, at the water-gate. She remained thus for a time in a supplicating attitude before she sprang up. [...] "You are false!" [...] she screamed out after Jim. [...] "Forgive me," [...] he cried. [...] "Never! Never!" [...] she called back.|$|R
5000|$|Lope De Vega's {{first start}} as a 3 year old came in the Prix De Fontainebleau on 25 April 2010, a noted trial for the Poule d'Essai des Poulains, and he {{finished}} 3rd behind the Aga Khan owned duo, Rajasaman, who won, and Siyouni, who finished 2nd. Lope De Vega's major breakthrough came in the Poule d'Essai des Poulains at Longchamp on 16 May 2010. Drawn wide in stall 15, Lope De Vega was held up until the top of straight, where he was pulled out wide to make his challenge, and he ran down 2000 Guineas runner up Dick Turpin to win by 1/2 length. [...] Lope De Vega followed up his first Group 1 win winning the Prix Du Jockey Club by 3 lengths, which is the biggest winning distance in the race since it was reduced to 2100m in 2005. He was again drawn wide in stall 20, but he tracked across from the wide draw {{to take up a}} prominent position and drew clear in the straight <b>to</b> win <b>eased</b> <b>down.</b> In winning the Prix Du Jockey Club as well as the Poule d'Essai des Poulains, he emulated his sire Shamardal who won both races in 2005.|$|R

50|$|On 26 May, Galatea {{was moved}} up in {{distance}} for the one-and-a-half-mile Oaks at Epsom. She was made 10/11 favourite against twenty opponents. In a slowly run race, Jones positioned Galatea {{just behind the}} leaders and was in third place following Olein and Ella A. on the final turn. Early in the straight, Galatea took the lead and went clear of the field, but Jones appeared <b>to</b> <b>ease</b> the favourite <b>down</b> in the final furlong and was almost caught by the French-trained filly White Fox, who finished strongly on the inside. The winning margin was a head, with three lengths back to Superbe in third. Jones claimed after the race {{that he had the}} situation under control and could have won by much further had he so wished. Later in June, Galatea returned to one mile for the Coronation Stakes at Royal Ascot in which she carried 130 pounds and finished sixth behind Olein.|$|R
5000|$|North Light's three-year-old {{season began}} with a {{significant}} step up in class as {{he was sent to}} York for the Group Two Dante Stakes, a recognised trial for the Derby. He was the fourth choice of the ten runners in the betting, starting at odds of 6/1. North Light was sent into the lead by Fallon half a mile from home, and he stayed on strongly up the straight to win by half a length from Rule of Law with the favourite Let The Lion Roar two and a half lengths further back in third. North Light was travelling so well that Fallon began <b>to</b> <b>ease</b> the colt <b>down</b> and stopped riding only to start again when he noticed Frankie Dettori closing fast on Rule of Law. Although he had won an important trial, Stoute was careful not to sound overconfident after the race, describing the performance as [...] "solid" [...] and calling North Light an [...] "each-way" [...] chance for the Derby.|$|R

50|$|Brigadier Gerard {{began his}} two-year-old career on 24 June 1970 in the Berkshire Stakes at Newbury. The Berkshire Stakes, run over five furlongs and worth £1201 to the winner, drew {{a field of}} five runners.

The only other fancied runner was Mais‘y Dotes winner of four from her six starts in modest company. Brigadier Gerard was ridden by Joe Mercer and was relatively unfancied at odds of 100/7.In the race Joe sat behind the more experienced runners until approaching the two furlong marker where he gave the Brigadier the office and he strode eight to ten lengths clear before being allowed <b>to</b> <b>ease</b> <b>down</b> before the line for an easy five length success.|$|E
40|$|Environmental {{as well as}} {{economic}} issues provide a compelling impetus to develop clean, efficient, and sustainable vehicles for urban transportation. Automobiles constitute an integral part of our everyday life, yet the exhaust emissions of conventional internal combustion engines (ICE) vehicles are to be blamed for the major source of urban pollution that causes the greenhouse effect leading to global warming. One of the ways to overcome this problem is the hybrid electric vehicle. The hybrid electric vehicle serves as a compromise for the environmental pollution problem and the limited range capability of today’s purely electric vehicle. Hybrid electric vehicles have an electric motor as well as an internal combustion engine (ICE) to provide extended range and <b>to</b> <b>ease</b> <b>down</b> the pollution problem. The {{purpose of this study is}} to develop and model the energy management system of two energy sources in a hybrid electric vehicle which are the internal combustion engine and the electric motor. A small scale of a hybrid electric vehicle is constructed from a 1 / 10 th size of a nitro-engine remote control car coupled with an electric motor. The energy management system is then developed by using microcontrollers and the power division between the two energy sources is controlled by the state of charge of the motor’s battery. At the end of this project, the rpm of the motor is managed to be dependent on the state of charge of the battery and the lower the percentage of the battery state of charge, the lower the rpm of the electric motor and the higher the rpm of the engine, and vice versa...|$|E

50|$|Ebor did not race {{again until}} 22 September, {{when he was}} one of {{eighteen}} colts and fillies to contest the forty-second running of the St Leger Stakes at Doncaster Racecourse. The strong favourite for the race was Richard Watt's unnamed Whitelock colt (later named Blacklock) who started at odds of 4/5, despite having his first run of the season. Ebor, ridden by Robert Johnson, was a 20/1 outsider. The Whitelock colt, ridden with great confidence by John Jackson, took the lead in the straight and seemed poised to win very easily. In the closing stages, Jackson, who had boasted that he would win the race in a canter, began <b>to</b> <b>ease</b> the favourite <b>down,</b> apparently unaware that Bob Johnson was delivering a strong challenge on Ebor along the rail. By the time Jackson was alerted to the danger by the shouts of the crowd it was too late, and Ebor repelled the favourite's renewed challenge to win by a neck, with Restless in third place. Although {{there was a great deal}} of ill-feeling directed at Jackson, it was generally acknowledged that the favourite's defeat was a result of overconfidence rather than dishonesty.|$|R

40|$|For a {{long time}} survey, management, and {{provision}} of geographic information in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) have mainly had an authoritative nature. Today the trend is changing and such an authoritative geographic information source is now accompanied by a public and freely available one which is usually referred to as Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI). Actually, the term VGI does not refer only to the mere geographic information, but, more generally, to the whole process which assumes the engagement of volunteers to collect and maintain such information in freely accessible GIS. The quick spread of VGI gives new relevance to a well-known challenge: developing new methods and techniques <b>to</b> <b>ease</b> <b>down</b> the interaction between users and GIS. Indeed, in spite of continuous improvements, GIS mainly provide interfaces tailored for experts, denying the casual user usually a non-expert the possibility to access VGI information. One main obstacle resides in the different ways GIS and humans deal with spatial information: GIS mainly encode spatial information in a quantitative format, whereas human beings typically prefer a qualitative and relational approach. For example, we use expressions like the lake is to {{the right-hand side of}} the wood or is there a supermarket close to the university? which qualitatively locate a spatial entity with respect to another. Nowadays, such a gap in representation has to be plugged by the user, who has to learn about the system structure and to encode his requests in a form suitable to the system. Contrarily, enabling gis to explicitly deal with qualitative spatial information allows for shifting the translation effort to the system side. Thus, to facilitate the interaction with human beings, GIS have to be enhanced with tools for efficiently handling qualitative spatial information. The work presented in this thesis addresses the problem of enabling Qualitative Spatial Configuration Queries (QSCQs) in GIS. A QSCQ is a spatial database query which allows for an automatic mapping of spatial descriptions produced by humans: A user naturally expresses his request of spatial information by drawing a sketch map or producing a verbal description. The qualitative information conveyed by such descriptions is automatically extracted and encoded into a QSCQ. The focus of this work is on two main challenges: First, the development of a framework that allows for managing in a spatial database the variety of spatial aspects that might be enclosed in a spatial description produced by a human. Second, the conception of Qualitative Spatial Access Methods (QSAMs) : algorithms and data structures tailored for efficiently solving QSCQs. The main objective of a QSAM is that of countering the exponential explosion in terms of storage space occurring when switching from a quantitative to a qualitative spatial representation while keeping query response time acceptable...|$|E
40|$|This article {{develops}} a microsimulation {{model of the}} Australian housing market that has tenure choice as its principal focus. The article sheds light on {{the role played by}} relative prices, wealth and borrowing constraints in shaping housing tenure choices. We explore the model&# 039;s capabilities as an aid to policy making by reporting the findings from an impact analysis of grant programs designed <b>to</b> <b>ease</b> the transition of first home buyers into owner occupation. We find a large demand for home ownership that is not met because of borrowing constraints. The need to meet financial institutions&# 039; down payment requirements is particularly important. Government grants made available to first home buyers will <b>ease</b> <b>down</b> payment requirements, but the formal incidence of such a subsidy is found to be inequitable among potential first home buyers, and its impact is largely to bring forward purchase decisions...|$|R
