5|$|When {{there is}} more pollen applied to the stigma, more seeds are {{produced}} in <b>the</b> <b>fruits</b> and <b>the</b> <b>fruits</b> are larger with greater likelihood of maturation, an effect called xenia. Competitively grown specimens are therefore often hand-pollinated to maximize the number of seeds in the fruit, which increases the fruit size; this pollination requires skilled technique. Seedlessness is known to occur in certain cultivars of C.pepo.|$|E
50|$|B. obtusa enters <b>the</b> <b>fruit</b> through wounds. These {{can be made}} by insects, birds or growth cracks. At first a brown spot, {{near the}} calyx, appears on <b>the</b> <b>fruit.</b> <b>The</b> spot on <b>the</b> <b>fruit</b> then enlarges and black/brown rings appear on <b>the</b> <b>fruit.</b> <b>The</b> <b>fruit</b> holds its shape, however, unlike other <b>fruit</b> diseases. <b>The</b> <b>fruit</b> will then wither up and can remain on the tree for another year before falling off. During this time pycnidia appear on the surface of <b>the</b> rotted <b>fruit.</b>|$|R

5|$|Both {{resident}} and transient orangutans aggregate on large fruiting trees to feed. <b>The</b> <b>fruits</b> {{tend to be}} abundant, so competition is low and individuals may engage in social interactions. Orangutans will also form travelling groups with members moving between different food sources. These groups tend {{to be made of}} only a few individuals. They also tend to be consortships between an adult male and female.|$|E

5|$|Fruit is rich {{in sugar}} but {{deficient}} in other nutrients, {{so it must be}} eaten in large quantities. Bohemian waxwings have a large liver which helps to convert sugar to energy. They can metabolise ethanol produced from the fermentation of those sugary fruits more efficiently than humans, but may still become intoxicated, sometimes fatally. Waxwings often drink water or eat snow in winter, since the sugar in their fruit diet tends to dehydrate the birds through an osmotic effect. In the summer, <b>the</b> <b>fruits</b> are juicier and water is less of a problem.|$|E

5|$|Fruit {{was popular}} {{and could be}} served fresh, dried, or preserved, and was a common {{ingredient}} in many cooked dishes. Since sugar and honey were both expensive, it was common to include many types of fruit in dishes that called for sweeteners of some sort. <b>The</b> <b>fruits</b> of choice in the south were lemons, citrons, bitter oranges (the sweet type was not introduced until several hundred years later), pomegranates, quinces, and, of course, grapes. Farther north, apples, pears, plums, and strawberries were more common. Figs and dates were eaten all over Europe, but remained rather expensive imports in the north.|$|E

In addition to proving that his name was Joseph, not John, they were able to describe in more detail his life story.

5|$|In Africa, the warbler eats insects {{as well as}} berries, and <b>the</b> <b>fruits</b> of the {{introduced}} Spanish flag is a favourite where present. An {{increase in}} body mass occurs again before the northward migration, birds fattening even more rapidly than prior to their southward journey.
