5|$|Due {{to their}} {{higher levels of}} {{androgen}} exposure, the female hyenas are significantly more muscular and aggressive <b>than</b> <b>their</b> <b>male</b> counterparts; social-wise, they are of higher rank than the males, being dominant or dominant and alpha, and the females who {{have been exposed to}} higher levels of androgen than average become higher-ranking than their female peers. Subordinate females lick the clitorises of higher-ranked females as a sign of submission and obedience, but females also lick each other's clitorises as a greeting or to strengthen social bonds; in contrast, while all males lick the clitorises of dominant females, the females will not lick the penises of males because males are considered to be of lowest rank.|$|E
5|$|Robert Frank, a {{professor}} of child development at Oakton Community College in Illinois, conducted a study comparing households with a stay-at-home dad and households with a stay-at-home mom. His study concluded that women were still able to form a strong bond with their children despite working full-time outside the home. Also, women working full-time were often more engaged with their children {{on a day-to-day basis}} <b>than</b> <b>their</b> <b>male</b> counterparts. His study concluded that in a family with a stay-at-home dad arrangement, the maternal and paternal influences are equally strong. This contrasts with the more traditional family structure where the father works outside the home and the mother stays home with the children. In this type of arrangement, the mother's influence is extremely strong, whereas the father's is relatively small. The study found that both parents play an equal role in a child's development, but the stay-at-home dad arrangement is the most beneficial for the child.|$|E
25|$|In older adults, {{women tend}} to be more {{socially}} adept <b>than</b> <b>their</b> <b>male</b> peers, and many older men may rely a female companion such as a spouse in order to compensate for their comparative lack of skill.|$|E
30|$|Also, {{significant}} differences on {{awareness of the}} changes relating to temperature were observed across respondents’ gender (χ 2  =  8.380, df =  2, P =  0.015), with males being more aware of declining temperature than females while the females were more aware of rising temperature <b>than</b> <b>their</b> <b>males</b> counterparts. In addition, {{significant differences}} on awareness of the changes relating to temperatures were also observed across the households’ main livelihood (χ 2  =  12.631, df =  10, P =  0.002) with crop farmers being more aware of temperature changes compared to the respondents pursuing other livelihood types.|$|R
60|$|In {{one small}} and curious class of cases the {{characters}} and habits of the two sexes have been completely transposed, for the females are larger, stronger, more vociferous and brightly-coloured <b>than</b> <b>their</b> <b>males.</b> They have, also, become so quarrelsome that they often fight together like the males of the most pugnacious species. If, as seems probable, they habitually drive away rival females, and by the display of their bright colours or other charms endeavour to attract the males, we can understand {{how it is that}} they have gradually been rendered, by means of sexual selection and sexually-limited transmission, more beautiful than the males—the latter being left unmodified or only slightly modified.|$|R
50|$|The declassified MI5 {{files on}} her were {{released}} by the Public Record Office in 2000.

25|$|In his 1922 book Tobaccoism, or How Tobacco Kills, Kellogg cited {{many studies}} on the {{negative}} impacts of smoking, and {{went so far as}} to attribute the longer lifespan of women to the observation that they partook in tobacco less <b>than</b> <b>their</b> <b>male</b> counterparts.|$|E
25|$|Still {{unrelated}} {{to the requirements of}} the position, only 9% of Chief Financial Officers (CFOs) are women while they are over 60% among accountants and auditors.

40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. September 2009. Major: Psychology. Advisor: Professor Jo-Ida C. Hansen. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xiv, 206 pages, appendices A-D. This study investigated race/ethnic and sex comparisons among 182 Hmong American and 198 Caucasian American {{college students in}} regards to specific career development variables. Hmong American college students reported more perceived educational and career barriers and fewer resources (e. g., career decision-making self-efficacy, family support) than did Caucasian American college students. Caucasian American female college students reported more perceived educational and career barriers and less career decision-making self-efficacy <b>than</b> did <b>their</b> <b>male</b> counterparts. Contrary to expectations, Hmong American female college students reported more role model support <b>than</b> did <b>their</b> <b>male</b> counterparts. These results suggest that relations among career variables are likely to vary by sex and race/ethnic group membership, which supports the need to investigate these relations among different minority groups...|$|R
40|$|The {{paper was}} to {{investigate}} gender variation in reading habits in schools in Moland: using Asantekwaa S. D. A. Junior High School in the Kintampo Municipality of Ghana as a case study. Questionnaires were used to collect data from one hundred and forty four (144) students who were randomly selected for the study. The findings of the study disclosed that females have higher positive attitudes towards reading <b>than</b> <b>their</b> <b>males</b> counterparts. The study recommended that teachers should draw programmes that will attract and encourage students to engage in effective reading habits. The school management and parents association should harness resources {{to set up a}} library in the school since a library is part of a school system which serves as a store house of knowledge...|$|R
25|$|According to an {{analysis}} of Census Bureau data released by Reach Advisors in 2008, single childless women between ages 22 and 30 were earning more <b>than</b> <b>their</b> <b>male</b> counterparts in most United States cities, with incomes that were 8% greater than males on average. This shift is driven by the growing ranks of women who attend colleges and move on to high-earning jobs.|$|E
25|$|This data {{somewhat}} {{undermines the}} traditional economic {{explanation of the}} concentration of female labor in agriculture. Regardless of the underlying reason for high female participation in agriculture, these workers earn a lower wage <b>than</b> <b>their</b> <b>male</b> counterparts both within this sector and relative to workers in other sectors. This {{may be one reason}} for the wide wage gap in some majority Muslim countries.|$|E
25|$|The Kenexa Research Institute {{released}} a global survey of almost 30,000 workers {{which showed that}} females suffered more workplace distress <b>than</b> <b>their</b> <b>male</b> counterparts.

25|$|Racial {{endogamy}} {{is significantly}} stronger among recent immigrants. This result holds for all racial groups, with the strongest endogamy found among immigrants of African descent. Interestingly, {{the gender differences}} in interracial marriage change significantly when the non-white partner is an immigrant.

40|$|National data {{reveals that}} the number of juvinile arrests and {{delinquency}} cases have increased more rapidly for girls <b>than</b> for <b>their</b> <b>male</b> counterparts in recent years. On the surface, these broad national data seem to indicate dramatic increases in the proportion and seriousness of delinquent acts committed by girls. However, the reality behind the statistics is now hotly disputed by academics and policy makers...|$|R
40|$|Large {{differences}} in scientific productivity {{between male and}} female researchers have not yet been explained satisfactorily. This study finds that child care and lack of research collaboration are the two factors that cause significant gender {{differences in}} scientific publishing. Women with young children and women who do not collaborate in research with other scientists are clearly less productive <b>than</b> both <b>their</b> <b>male</b> and female colleagues...|$|R
25|$|The dual-sphere {{nature of}} women’s work, in {{household}} domestic labor, {{and in the}} marketplace, allowed for both additional opportunities at financial resources {{as well as a}} larger social circle <b>than</b> <b>their</b> <b>male</b> counterparts. This gave women greater resources both as slaves and as ex-slaves, though their mobility was hindered by gender constraints. However, women often fared better in manumission possibilities. Among Brazilian-born adult ex-slaves in Salvador in the 18th century, 60% were women.|$|E
25|$|Education in Burkina Faso {{is divided}} into primary, {{secondary}} and higher education. High school costs approximately CFA25,000 ($50 USD) per year, which is far above the means of most Burkinabè families. Boys receive preference in schooling; as such, girls' education and literacy rates are far lower <b>than</b> <b>their</b> <b>male</b> counterparts. An increase in girls' schooling has been observed because of the government's policy of making school cheaper for girls and granting them more scholarships.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the career}} gains women have made, their husbands have not reached parity {{in terms of}} their {{domestic}} work and care work. Women in the developed world, including the U.S., still do hours more of housework <b>than</b> <b>their</b> <b>male</b> counterparts, despite their success in the workplace. Working mothers on average do more work and sleep less than their husbands. The perception of who does more housework is also skewed by whether or not the husband or the wife is reporting.|$|E
40|$|The study {{investigated}} gender {{issues in the}} implementation of social studies curriculum in Nigerian universities. The subjects for the study comprised of all the 200 final-year sandwich social studies students of University of Port-Harcourt in the 2009 contact session. Five research questions guided the study. Researchers developed questionnaire containing 32 items and demographic information on students and lecturers were used to collect data. Frequencies and percentages were used to answer the research questions. The findings of the study revealed that there is a gender balance than gap {{in the implementation of}} social studies curriculum, more females offered social studies <b>than</b> <b>their</b> <b>males</b> counter parts, also there are more males than females academics teaching social studies. Finally, the study showed ways through which the social studies curriculum can be further improved for gender equity. Recommendations are made based on the findings...|$|R

50|$|Eagly (1987) suggest women due {{to their}} {{socially}} accepted roles are more often perceived in lower status positions <b>than</b> those of <b>their</b> <b>male</b> counterparts.

25|$|Infants have fully {{developed}} their locomotive abilities within {{three to four}} months. When an infant is seven months old, its mother discourages suckling; full weaning happens by its 18th month. In some populations, male infants tend to play in larger groups more often than females. However, female infants have more social interaction <b>than</b> <b>their</b> <b>male</b> counterparts. Males prefer to associate with other males around the same age, when they are two years old. Female infants will associate with individuals {{of all ages and}} sexes.|$|E
25|$|Women {{in lower}} wage jobs {{are more likely}} to be subject to wage discrimination. They {{are more likely to}} bring home far less <b>than</b> <b>their</b> <b>male</b> {{counterparts}} with equal job status, and get far less help with housework from their husbands than the high-earning women. Women with low educational attainment entering the workforce in mass quantity lowered earnings for some men, as the women brought about a lot more job competition. The lowered relative earnings of the men and increase in birth control made marriage prospects harder for lower income women.|$|E
25|$|According to Andrew Beveridge, a Professor of Sociology at Queens College, between 2000 and 2005, {{young women}} in their twenties earned more <b>than</b> <b>their</b> <b>male</b> {{counterparts}} in some large urban centers, including Dallas (120%), New York (117%), Chicago, Boston, and Minneapolis. A major {{reason for this is}} that women have been graduating from college in larger numbers than men, and that many of those women seem to be gravitating toward major urban areas. In 2005, 53% of women in their 20s working in New York were college graduates, compared with only 38% of men of that age. Nationwide, the wages of that group of women averaged 89% of the average full-time pay for men between 2000 and 2005.|$|E

50|$|They {{range in}} size, but {{male and female}} oyster drills average 24 {{millimeters}} and 28 millimeters, respectively. Not only are females longer, {{but they are also}} taller <b>than</b> <b>their</b> <b>males.</b> Almost all Atlantic oyster drills reach their largest size after two full growing seasons. About 70% of their size is reached within this time span. In the next four or so years to come, {{there is little or no}} increase in size anymore. Unfortunately, there is no protected way to check the sex of these gastropods. Their shell must be crushed in order to see the genitalia using a microscope. Although some females possess a small vestigial formation that may look like a penis, other parts are used to confirm the sex. Finding the egg capsule gland, ovary, and any sperm ingesting glands make it easier to identify the oyster drill as a female.|$|R

25|$|Women {{artists have}} also been at the {{forefront}} of the hip hop movement since its inception in the Bronx. Nevertheless, as gangsta rap became the dominant force in hip hop music, there were many songs with misogynistic (anti-women) lyrics and many music videos depicted women in a sexualized fashion. The negation of female voice and perspective is an issue that has come to define mainstream hip hop music. The recording industry is less willing to back female artists <b>than</b> <b>their</b> <b>male</b> counterparts, and when it does back them, often it places emphasis on their sexuality over their musical substance and artistic abilities. Since the turn of the century (the beginning of the 2000s decade), female hip hop artists have struggled to get mainstream attention, with only a few, such as older artists like the female duo Salt N' Pepa to more contemporary ones like Lil' Kim and Nicki Minaj, reaching platinum status.|$|E
25|$|Prices {{reflected}} {{the characteristics of}} the slave—such factors as sex, age, nature, and height were all taken into account to determine the price of a slave. Over the life-cycle, the price of enslaved women was higher <b>than</b> <b>their</b> <b>male</b> counterparts up to puberty age, as they would likely bear children and produce more slaves, in addition to serving as laborers. Men around the age of 25 were the most valued, as they were at the highest level of productivity and still had a considerable life-span. If slaves had a history of fights or escapes, their price was lowered reflecting what planters believed was risk of repeating such behavior. Slave traders and buyers would examine a slave's back for whipping scars—a large number of injuries would be seen as evidence of laziness or rebelliousness, rather than the previous master's brutality, and would lower the slave's price Taller male slaves were priced at a higher level, as height was viewed as a proxy for fitness and productivity.|$|E
25|$|The Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale, {{sometimes}} shortened to the CMAS, {{was created}} in 1956. This scale was closely modeled after the Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale. It was developed so that the TMAS {{could be applied to}} a broader range of people, specifically children. Kitano tested the validity of the CMAS by comparing students who were placed in special education classes versus those placed in regular classrooms. Kitano proposed the idea that children who were in special education classes {{were more likely to have}} higher anxiety than those in regular classrooms. Using the CMAS, Kitano found boys tested in the special education classes had higher anxiety scores than their regular classroom counterparts. Hafner tested the reliability of the CMAS with the knowledge that the TMAS had a feminine bias. Hafner found that the CMAS did not have a female bias. He only found two questions that females always scored higher on <b>than</b> <b>their</b> <b>male</b> counterparts. As the test stands now, the suggestion is to compare the female and male participants separately. Castaneda found significant differences across different grade levels, indicating that as students develop they are affected differentially by various stressors.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the earnings of}} an under-researched group: Asian women in computer science, in the United States (U. S.). I distinguish three subsets of college-educated Asian female computer scientists working full time in the U. S. : 1) U. S. -born, U. S. -educated Asian Americans, 2) Asian-born, U. S. -educated Asian immigrants, and 3) Asian-born, Asian-educated Asian immigrants. Results from multivariate regression and quantile regressions (at the 10 th, 25 th, 50 th, and 75 th percentiles) show that U. S. - and Asian-educated Asian immigrant women earn less on average (at the mean level) and at the 10 th, 50 th, and/or 75 th percentile levels <b>than</b> <b>their</b> white <b>male</b> counterparts. Only Asian American women do not earn less <b>than</b> <b>their</b> white <b>male</b> counterparts at any level. Further analysis reveals that Asian immigrant women earn less due to their gender, but not because {{of a combination of}} their gender and race. Neither the immigrant women’s birthplace or the origin of their degree further disadvantage their earnings. The lack of multiple disadvantages may be explained by white women earning less than expected, but not Asian immigrant women earning more than expected. Suggestions for further research are discussed...|$|R
30|$|The {{standard}} approach to gender wage {{discrimination in the}} labour market originates in the pathbreaking work by Becker (1971). According to Becker, discrimination stems from personal prejudices which constitute tastes for discrimination among employers, coworkers, or costumers. As a case in point, employers may possess discriminatory preferences against female workers constituting a disutility from the employment of women. Thus, to be compensated for the loss in utility following from the employment of women discriminatory employers pay lower wages to equally productive women <b>than</b> to <b>their</b> <b>male</b> counterparts.|$|R
