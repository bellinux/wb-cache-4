5000|$|The Times {{correspondent}} {{thought the}} car travelled rapidly and smoothly {{and found the}} lines of the body pleasing. Front seat access, he said, is easy but the rear seat though having good leg and elbow room and just enough head clearance is as difficult as most sports models to climb into. The car seemed [...] "well-found" [...] - two wipers with two motors, a fitted <b>tool</b> <b>tray</b> below the instrument panel, a windscreen with a handle and concealed chain for security. The signal lever has an automatic return. Driving position, location and action of all controls were all fine. There is a harmonic stabiliser. Though a sports car the engine is not fussy or hesitant at low speeds. The best speed on the open road was about 80 miles an hour.|$|E

5000|$|The R90S' type 247 [...] "airhead" [...] {{engine was}} a pushrod OHV, two valve per cylinder, {{air-cooled}} flat-twin [...] "boxer" [...] unit. The engine was based closely on the R75/5, {{sharing the same}} stroke, but with a larger bore, to give a capacity of 898cc. The R90S weighed 215 kg and has a five-speed gearbox with a shaft final drive. The first R90S models had a two-tone paintwork scheme of [...] "Smoke Black/Silver" [...] with adhesive gold pinstripes. Feedback from unimpressed customers prompted BMW to return to hand painted pinstripes. Later R90S models were available also in two-tone [...] "Daytona Orange" [...] with red pinstriping. The R90S had a redesigned seat, with a small [...] "ducktail" [...] fairing which (in addition to an underseat <b>tool</b> <b>tray)</b> provided a small storage space lightweight items such as waterproofs. Standard equipment included a full toolkit, a hand pump, a first-aid kit and even a small hand towel with an embroidered BMW logo.|$|E
50|$|Paper by FiftyThree is an iPad {{application}} {{launched in}} March 2012. Two weeks after its release, it amassed 1.5 million downloads and 7 million pages {{had been created}} in Paper. As of April 2014, Paper has been downloaded over 10 million times and over 100 million pages have been created. According to FiftyThree’s blog, creators have spent one millennium in the app combined.Paper contains digital journals in which users can create sketches, diagrams, illustrations, notes, or drawings, and share them by email or across the web. Paper is available in ten different languages, is free to download, and comes with the Draw tool. The additional tools Sketch, Outline, Write, Color, and Mixer can be added via in-app purchases. Paper was built using an OpenGL framework, making it the first productivity tool to match the world of digital gaming. Paper flows between tasks with real-time 3D and shadows, includes a touch-gesture rewind feature, and a touch-gesture. zoomPaper released a new tool in October 2012: Mixer, which allows users to create custom colors by “mixing” two colors together in the color well. As of April 2014, over 47 million colors have been created using Mixer.In May 2013 the Made With Paper Stream launched to showcase user creations. The addition of Presentation Mode followed shortly, which allows users to hide the <b>tool</b> <b>tray</b> and menus when Paper is connected to a second display or projector.|$|E

40|$|This report evaluates Scanias rescue-vehicles {{used by the}} Swedish rescue service. The {{report is}} based on visits at the {{involved}} companies and a survey carried out at Luleå rescue service. The report shows that personnel at the rescue-service in Luleå are quite pleased with their vehicles. Many point of views and comments have been made, but in a more improving then criticizing way. Some critical points have been identified, and the most criticism is put on the louvers to the <b>tool</b> <b>trays</b> that are considered deficient in several respects. Also, technology considered too old by the rescue personnel is identified as a major limiting factor. Hopefully, this report {{will lead to a}} better knowledge by the participating companies about how the rescue-vehicles are considered by the Swedish rescue service. It may also be a tool in the improvement process made by the different companies to achieve even better rescue-vehicles in the future. Validerat; 20110902 (anonymous...|$|R
40|$|Mass {{transfer}} efficiency {{was modeled}} {{by developing a}} computational fluid dynamic based artificial neural network model. A CFD model was developed and validated for hydrodynamics and mass transfer characteristics of distillation column. Generated data by CFD include {{a wide range of}} operating conditions, tray geometries and material properties were used for training and testing network. The model results were close to experimental data and shown that CFD-ANN model {{can be used as a}} powerful <b>tool</b> in <b>tray</b> design and analysis...|$|R

50|$|According to Czichon, who is {{currently}} a faculty for archaeology at Uşak University, lots of stone and loom artifacts were unearthed. Mining tools were found for copper deposits situated at nearby Tavşan Mountain field. The most valuable artifacts are tablets with cuneiform script, which point out the site as Nerik. An inventory list showing <b>tools,</b> including silver <b>trays</b> and golden bullae contained in an unknown shrine, is also among the findings.|$|R
40|$|High {{degree of}} {{competitiveness}} associated with petroleum {{leads to the}} exhaustive search for new technologies that enable greater efficiency in the related processes. A three-dimensional mathematical homogeneous biphasic model was implemented in the commercial code of computational fluid dynamics (CFD), FLUENT package to predict concentration and temperature distributions on sieve trays of distillation columns and good simulation results are obtained. The tray geometries and operating conditions {{are based on the}} experimental works of Indian oil corporation limited(R & D). The dispersed gas phase and continuous liquid phase are modelled in the Mixture model for two interpenetrating phases with inter phase momentum, heat and mass transfer. The main objective of this study has been to find the extent to which CFD {{can be used as a}} prediction tool for real behaviour, and concentration and temperature distributions of sieve trays. The simulation results are shown that CFD is a powerful <b>tool</b> in <b>tray</b> design, analysis and trouble shooting, and can be considered as a new approach for efficiency calculations...|$|R
40|$|Performance of {{the sheet}} metal cutting and forming <b>tools</b> {{producing}} baking <b>tray</b> parts was monitored. The baking trays are produced from the carbon steel sheet and from the Teflon coated steel sheet, where resistance of the steel substrate of the tool forming inserts against galling is very important, as well as resistance of the cutting inserts to wearing out. The operating inserts were produced from various Uddeholm steels. For the first cutting inserts, Sverker 21 was used, followed by Sleipner steel, both of them uncoated. In order to improve performance, PVD coating (nano-structured TiAlN) was applied on Sleipner substrate. A step forward was using of the powder metallurgy steels, Vanadis 6. The initial forming inserts were made from Vanadis 10 steel, whereas further investigations involved the recently launched steel Vancron 40, a steel type produced specifically for the applications where resistance against galling is a predominant wearing mechanism. The analysis shows that PVD coating provides cost savings due to less frequent tool resharpening. The currently obtained results indicate promising performance of the newly developed steel Vancron 40 for forming applications...|$|R
