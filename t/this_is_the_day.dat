2500|$|Handel {{travelled}} to Italy {{to engage}} new singers and also composed seven more operas, {{among them the}} comic masterpiece Partenope and the [...] "magic" [...] opera Orlando. After two commercially successful English oratorios Esther and Deborah, {{he was able to}} invest again in the South Sea Company. Handel reworked his Acis and Galatea which then became his most successful work ever. Handel failed to compete with the Opera of the Nobility, who engaged musicians such as Johann Adolph Hasse, Nicolo Porpora and the famous castrato Farinelli. The strong support by Frederick, Prince of Wales caused conflicts in the royal family. In March 1734 Handel composed a wedding anthem <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> which the Lord hath made, and a serenata Parnasso in Festa for Anne of Hanover.|$|E
2500|$|His {{reputation}} as a soldier was now established; henceforth he preferred to serve the state at home, scrutinizing {{the conduct of the}} candidates for public honours and of generals in the field. If he was not personally engaged in the prosecution of the Scipiones (Africanus and Asiaticus) for corruption, it was his spirit that animated the attack upon them. Even Scipio Africanus—who refused to reply to the charge, saying only, [...] "Romans, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> on which I conquered Hannibal" [...] and was absolved by acclamation—found it necessary to retire, self-banished, to his villa at Liternum.

2500|$|The Republic of China {{established}} Taiwan Provincial Government in September 1945 {{and proclaimed}} on October 25, 1945 as [...] "Taiwan Retrocession Day." [...] <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> {{in which the}} Japanese troops surrendered. The validity of the proclamation is subject to some debate, with some supporters of Taiwan independence arguing that it is invalid, and that the date only {{marks the beginning of}} military occupation that persists to the present. [...] By 1938 about 309,000 Japanese lived in Taiwan. Between the Japanese surrender of Taiwan in 1945 and 25 April 1946, the Republic of China forces repatriated 90% of the Japanese living in Taiwan to Japan. During the immediate postwar period, the Kuomintang (KMT) administration on Taiwan was repressive and extremely corrupt compared with the previous Japanese rule, leading to local discontent. Anti-mainlander violence flared on February 28, 1947, prompted by an incident in which a cigarette seller was injured and a passerby was indiscriminately shot dead by Nationalist authorities. During the ensuing crackdown by the KMT administration in {{what became known as the}} February 28 Incident, tens of thousands of people were killed or arrested, and the incident became a taboo topic of discussion for the entire martial law era.|$|E
2500|$|Germans eat a Three Kings cake {{which may}} be a golden pastry ring filled with orange and spice {{representing}} gold, frankincense and myrrh.

Or they may be made of typical rich Christmas bread dough with cardamom and pearl sugar in the same seven bun crown shape. These varieties are most typically purchased in supermarkets with the trinket, and gold paper crown included. As in other countries, the person who receives the piece or bun containing the trinket or whole almond becomes the king or queen for a day.

2500|$|The Wall Street Journal critic Joe Morgenstern commented, [...] "'Knight and Day' {{woke me up}} to {{just how}} awful some summer {{entertainments}} have become. It isn't that the film is harmful, except to moviegoers' wallets and movie lovers' morale, {{but that it is}} truly phenomenal for the purity of its incoherence." [...] Writing for the Chicago Sun-Times, Roger Ebert rated the movie 3 stars out of 4 and wrote, [...] "'Knight and Day' aspires to the light charm of a romantic action comedy like 'Charade' or 'Romancing the Stone,' but would come closer if it dialed down the relentless action. The romance part goes without saying after a Meet Cute contrived in an airport, and the comedy seems to generate naturally between Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz. But why do so many summer movies find it obligatory to inflict us with CGI overkill? I'd sorta rather see Diaz and Cruise in action scenes on a human scale, rather than have it rubbed in that for long stretches, they're essentially replaced by animation." [...] Ty Burr of The Boston Globe stated, [...] "The movie’s a piece of high-octane summer piffle: stylish, funny, brainless without being too obnoxious about it, and Cruise is its manic animating principle." [...] Writing for the Associated Press, Christy Lemire commented, [...] "Cruise's presence also helps keep things light, breezy and watchable when the action – and the story itself – spin ridiculously out of control." [...] Bill Goodykoontz of The Arizona Republic observed, [...] "Mangold, working from a script by Patrick O'Neill, accelerates events {{in a way that is}} either a perfect representation of how current action films are made or a demonstration of everything that's wrong with movies today. Maybe it's both." [...] Joshua Starnes of ComingSoon.net gave the film a rating of 6.5 out of 10, and concluded his review, [...] "Instead of watching it, you're better off putting [...] "Knight and Day" [...] in a time capsule and singing some Don McLean, 'cause <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> the movie star died." [...] In a subsequent [...] "mini review", Edward Douglas of ComingSoon.net gave the film a rating of 8 out of 10, and concluded, [...] "The entertainment comes from how much fun it is watching [...] on screen together and that's what separates Knight and Day from previous attempts at mixing romance, comedy, and action." [...] In a review for CNN, Tom Charity commented, [...] "there's a creeping anxiety about this project, a tendency to over-compensate that speaks to underlying inadequacies." ...|$|E
