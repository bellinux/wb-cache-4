25|$|Purge Incomplete – Mary Jo Bole's exhibit {{explores the}} history of {{plumbing}} at the penitentiary. Interestingly, the building had running water before <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>did.</b> Consisting of sculptural pieces made of resin, brass, and frosted glass, Bole's designs are modeled after John Haviland's original design for the plumbing at Eastern State Penitentiary. The exhibit includes views of the plumbing {{from the vantage point}} of those residing or working at the prison, including that of the prisoners, prison guards, and the manufacturers of the plumbing. Additionally, the exhibit showcases the sculptures as having both opaque and translucent factors, in which the translucent parts will glow within the cells.|$|E
25|$|Johnson made eleven {{international}} {{trips to}} twenty countries during his presidency. He flew 523,000 miles aboard Air Force One while in office. His October 1966 visit to Australia sparked demonstrations from anti-war protesters. One {{of the most}} unusual international trips in presidential history occurred before Christmas in 1967. The President began the trip by going to the memorial service for Australian Prime Minister Harold Holt, who had disappeared in a swimming accident and was presumed drowned. <b>The</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>did</b> not reveal in advance to the press that the President would make the first round-the-world presidential trip. The trip was 26,959 miles completed in only 112.5 hours (4.7 days). Air Force One crossed the equator twice, stopped in Travis Air Force Base, Calif., then Honolulu, Pago Pago, Canberra, Melbourne, Vietnam, Karachi and Rome.|$|E

But most were on American politics. That Dunne was often a guest of Roosevelt at <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>did</b> not spare the president from being skewered by Dooley, nor was the former Rough Rider's aggressive foreign policy spared. Dunne disliked imperialism, and was outraged by the actions of U.S. forces in the Philippine insurrection against American rule; he satirized Governor William Howard Taft's glowing report on progress there, [...] "We are giving hundreds of these poor benighted heathen the well-known old-fashioned American water cure...

[...] However, it also concluded that Cornelius, Thomason, and Martens, who all had potential business interests involved, had possibly influenced the decision. [...] Moreover, the GAO report indicated that the First Lady played a larger role than previously thought before the firings, with Watkins saying she had urged [...] "that action be taken to get 'our people' into the travel office."

500|$|During {{the first}} year {{following}} the election defeat, Romney generally kept a low profile, with his ordinary daily activities around San Diego being captured via social media glimpses. In December 2012, he joined the board of Marriott International for a third stint as a director. In March 2013, Romney gave a reflective interview on Fox News Sunday, stating, [...] "It kills me not to be there, {{not to be in}} <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>doing</b> what needs to be done". He again expressed regret at the [...] "47 percent" [...] remark, saying [...] "There's no question that hurt and did real damage to my campaign."
