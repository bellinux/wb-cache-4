He follows them to the railway station and tries to gain the {{attention}} of Viji, but she is unable to recognise him. Cheenu acts like a dancing monkey that Viji developed a liking for, but Viji, unable to comprehend, thinks that he is insane and begging for food. Cheenu continues his futile attempts to gain her attention, and the train eventually leaves with Viji not recognising him. Cheenu, who was injured while chasing her car and <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>her</b> attention, is left alone, heartbroken.|$|E
5|$|The contest drew {{national}} attention. Lazio blundered {{during a}} September debate by seeming to invade Clinton's personal space <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>her</b> {{to sign a}} fundraising agreement. The campaigns of Clinton and Lazio, along with Giuliani's initial effort, spent a record combined $90 million. Clinton won the election on November 7, 2000, with 55percent of the vote to Lazio's 43percent. She {{was sworn in as}} U.S. Senator on January 3, 2001, making her the first (and so far only) woman to have held an elected office either while, or after, serving as first lady.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, Schultz stated that {{a series of}} events changed his {{political}} views from the right of the political spectrum to left of the spectrum. One event was his mother's battle with Alzheimer's Disease, which began a long, slow decline of her mental health. Schultz found it frustrating <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>her</b> the services that she needed. Another was that he met a psychiatric nurse named Wendy who ran a homeless shelter in Fargo, North Dakota. He attributed much of his political change to her. Although he had criticized the homeless on his show, he said in his book that she helped to humanize them and he reportedly found that some of the people he had insulted were veterans, unable to get the psychiatric or medical services that might help them. He says that was the moment he began to look at poverty differently.|$|E

[...] Ferraro stated in mid- that Clinton had [...] "raised this whole woman candidate thing to a whole different level than when I ran". She thought Obama had behaved in a sexist manner and that she might not vote for him.|$|E
500|$|Josh and Naomi {{had sex in}} a hotel {{elevator}} and O'Reilly said the scenes were not awkward to film, as Bonner's sense of humour made the shoot fun. She also said that Naomi was not worried about taking advantage of Josh, as she was more worried about Sheila's reaction if she found out. Naomi was <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>her</b> life back under control {{and she did not}} want to ruin her relationship with her mother again. The relationship was almost discovered by Sheila when she returned home unexpectedly and interrupted Naomi and Josh. Naomi forced Josh to hide outside in the garden wearing nothing but his underwear. Naomi ended the affair after Josh's mother, Terese (Rebekah Elmaloglou), found out about it and confronted Naomi. O'Reilly thought Naomi was well suited to Josh as they had [...] "similar energies", but ultimately he was too young for her.|$|E

The music video won the Best Female Video and Best Video with a Social Message awards at the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards. In the following video, [...] "Judas", she portrays Mary Magdalene, and Norman Reedus plays the title role. The video for [...] "The Edge of Glory" [...] consists mostly of interchanging shots of Gaga dancing and singing {{on the street and}} was considered the simplest of her career.

500|$|Curry {{stated that}} the [...] "first few drafts of [...] focused on a 12-year-old boy and a mother's trial of <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>her</b> son out of this boy's clutches, and gradually, it became {{something}} else". In the original script, Claire was [...] "happily married", but Curry chose to have her separated due to her husband's infidelity, {{so that she could}} be a [...] "more sympathetic character". Curry was influenced by the real-life story of Mary Kay Letourneau, a teacher who became involved with her underage student, causing her to be convicted for rape charges. Director Rob Cohen revealed that in Curry's draft, the character of Noah was younger, but he made the conscious decision to age him to 19, because he felt as if it was [...] "not healthy" [...] and that audiences would lose sympathy for the protagonist. Explaining her character, Lopez stated that Claire was feeling [...] "worthless" [...] after her husband cheated, and [...] "People can understand that. They can understand making a mistake in a moment like that." ...|$|E
500|$|Ralph Abernathy {{stated in}} his 1989 {{autobiography}} And the Walls Came Tumbling Down that King had a [...] "weakness for women", although they [...] "all understood and {{believed in the}} biblical prohibition against sex outside of marriage. It was just {{that he had a}} particularly difficult time with that temptation." [...] In a later interview, Abernathy said that he only wrote the term [...] "womanizing", that he did not specifically say King had extramarital sex and that the infidelities King had were emotional rather than sexual. Abernathy criticized the media for sensationalizing the statements he wrote about King's affairs, such as the allegation that he admitted in his book that King had a sexual affair the night before he was assassinated. In his original wording, Abernathy had claimed he saw King coming out of his room with a lady when he awoke the next morning and later claimed that [...] "he may have been in there discussing and debating and <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>her</b> {{to go along with the}} movement, I don't know." ...|$|E

It was filmed at Universal CityWalk by {{director}} Ray Kay, who had previously directed videos for Beyoncé Knowles, Lady Gaga, Alexandra Burke, and Cheryl Cole, among others. Ludacris said that the video [...] "is like a 2010 version of Michael Jackson's [...] "The Way You Make Me Feel"." [...] Bieber said that the video [...] "will capture the song's message of trying to woo back a girl." [...] In explaining the concept of the video, Bieber said, [...] "It starts off, I really like this girl, but we didn't [...] along; we couldn't be together. Basically I want her back and [...] kind of going through the whole thing. I'm chasing her around, <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>her,</b> and she's kind of playing hard to get, but I'm persistent. I keep going." [...] The video premiered exclusively on Vevo on Friday, February 19, 2010. Singer and actress Jasmine Villegas portrays Bieber's love interest in the video.

500|$|The Cosby Show {{is famous}} for rarely {{discussing}} political or controversial topics; it spends significantly more time openly addressing Clair's role as [...] "a woman who 'has it all'", maintaining a successful career while raising a family, than it does the race of its characters. The series seldom shies away from discussing gender equality. Despite never referring to herself as feminist within the show, Clair proudly embodies several feminist themes and beliefs, remaining, according to The Daily Dots Nico Lang, [...] "an outspoken advocate for equality in her household, fighting sexism while setting an example for her daughters." [...] From the sitcom's earliest stages, Cosby had always intended for Clair to reflect the ever-changing work and family dynamic, explaining, [...] "If this was 1964 ... my wife could do the cooking and I could be {{the guy on the}} sofa who just says, ‘Let your mother handle this.’ But today a lot of things have changed and I want the show to reflect those changes." [...] According to Rotten Tomatoes' Alex Vo, Clair represents [...] "the rapidly changing gender and household roles from the 1980s and onward." [...] MeTV agreed that Clair is [...] "the '80s response to the '50s housewife." [...] Although feminism was hardly a new concept to sitcoms by the time The Cosby Show premiered, feminist television characters remained scare during the early 1980s. The Huffington Posts Dr. Mlsee Harris observed that, during this time, [...] "The stereotypical role of the black woman on television ... had been that of a financially struggling, single woman with dysfunctional relationships, <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>her</b> life together with no distinct direction", stereotypes Clair worked to defy. Sarah Galo of Mic observed that Clair demonstrates that motherhood and having a career are not [...] "separate entities".|$|E
