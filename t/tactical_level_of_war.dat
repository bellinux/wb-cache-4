40|$|This thesis will {{determine}} {{the degree to which}} contemporary Manoeuvre Warfare theory is appropriate at the <b>tactical</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>war.</b> In order to arrive at a basic working definition of Manoeuvre Warfare, it will draw mainly on material from the US Marine Corps. Contemporary military doctrine acknowledges the existence of three levels of war, the strategic, operational, and tactical. This was not always the case, as the operational level is a very new construct. Manoeuvre Warfare emerged {{as a response to the}} need to link the tactical and strategic levels that resulted in the inception of the operational level. While conceived at the operational level, Manoeuvre Warfare has been applied to all three levels of war. This thesis examines the context of Manoeuvre Warfare, and looks at how the US Marine Corps defines this doctrine. It then defines the three levels of war and looks at the main examples used to support manoeuvre theory before investigating the application of manoeuvre theory at the <b>tactical</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>war.</b> This thesis will show that some key aspects of Manoeuvre Warfare are not actually appropriate at the tactical leve...|$|E
40|$|Deception {{has been}} a part of warfare {{throughout}} history and has proven a very effective force multiplier when employed correctly. Many esteemed military theorist have espoused the merits of deception including; Sun Tzu, Carl von Clausewitz, Mao Tse Tung, and Basil Liddell Hart. The challenge, however, in incorporating military deception is that it can be very difficult to plan, coordinate, and synchronize from the strategic through the operational and <b>tactical</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>war.</b> The increased demand for intelligence, information superiority, as well as the increased need for operational security to conduct successful deception also present a significant challenge to military planners. Additionally, deception requires a great deal of creativity and unconventional thinking on the part of the deceiver and is considered more art than science which makes it difficult to train within the military. Although the U. S. conventional military practiced deception at all <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>war</b> on a number of occasions during World War II, it has since significantly reduced its use of deception above the <b>tactical</b> <b>level,</b> opting instead, to rely on its superior firepower, maneuver, and technology. However, while the conventional military has decreased its use of deception over the last sixty years, another force within the U. S. military, Specia...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{elements}} of military deception and defines the overarching principles that make for successful military deception. A good reference point is the six principles of military deception as defined by Joint Publication (JP) 3 - 58 : focus, integration, timeliness, security, objective, and centralized control. However, I propose that operational advantage, consisting of surprise, information advantage and security are essential elements of a successful military deception. To refine {{the scope of the}} research this analysis of deception is focused on the <b>tactical</b> and operational <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>war.</b> This thesis begins with a cross analysis of the principles of deception as defined by the U.

40|$|Our {{nation has}} a truly {{impressive}} array of space-based capabilities supporting our armed forces. However, much of this support is focused at the strategic and operational levels of war. There are several areas of desired improvement in the space force enhancement mission area at the <b>tactical</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>war</b> that could be addressed by small, inexpensive satellites dedicated for use by tactical land warfighters. One of these areas of desired improvement is tactical beyond-line-of-sight (BLOS) communications, including support for ground sensors, text message relay, voice communications, and image or video transmission. Technical solutions to fill these areas of desired improvement should be relatively inexpensive, and more importantly, taskable by tactical users {{in the area of}} operations. New trends in the miniaturization of electronic components are leading to smaller satellites with significant capabilities in the nanosatellite (1 - 10 kg) and microsat (10 - 100 kg) classes. For example, the CubeSat standard for nanosatellites now being built by universities around the world is based on tiny cube-shaped satellites with dimensions of only 10 cm on a side and weighing about 1 kg. Slightly larger nanosatellite configurations, with multiple cube formats, allowing for missions from low earth orbit with broader scopes are under investigation by organizations such as NASA, Boeing, and the US Army. One technical approach that could address today’s tactical BLOS communications area of desired improvement for the tactical warfighter would be a constellation of nanosatellites in low earth orbit. To investigate the feasibility of such a constellation, the US Army Space and Missile Defense Command/Army Forces Strategic Command (USASMDC/ARSTRAT) is executing the Space and Missile Defense Command – Operational Nanosatellite Effect, or SMDC-ONE, technology demonstration. The key SMDC-ONE demonstration thresholds for success involve designing, developing, building and qualification testing of two nanosatellite units, and acceptance testing of eight flight units within a one-year timeframe ending in April 2009. A custom communications payload will deliver a capability to support simulated ground sensors and text message relay. Communications beyond this level of complexity were not included in this demonstration to reduce schedule risk. SMDC-ONE can help establish the case for inexpensive space force enhancement for the tactical warfighter through relatively inexpensive, rapidly developed nanosatellite constellations...|$|E
40|$|At the <b>tactical</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>war</b> the Germans {{are widely}} {{regarded}} as having had the most innovative and proficient army of World War I. Likewise, many historians would agree that the Germans suffered from serious, if not fatal, shortcomings at the strategic level of war. It is at the middle level of warfare, the operational level, that the Germans {{seem to be the}} most difficult to evaluate. Although the operational was only fully accepted in the 1980 s by many Western militaries as a distinct level of warfare, German military thinking well before the start of World War I clearly recognized the Operativ, as a realm of warfighting activity between the tactical and the strategic. But the German concept of the operational art was flawed at best, and actually came closer to tactics on a grand scale. The flaws in their approach to operations cost the Germans dearly in both World Wars. Through a thorough review of the surviving original operational plans and orders, this study evaluates the German approach to the operational art by analyzing the Ludendorff Offensives of 1918. Taken as a whole, the five actually executed and two planned but never executed major attacks produced stunning tactical results, but ultimately left Germany in a far worse strategic position by August 1918. Among the most serious operational errors made by the German planners were their blindness to the power of sequential operations and cumulative effects, and their insistence in mounting force-on-force attacks. The Allies, and especially the British, were exceptionally vulnerable in certain elements of their warfighting system. By attacking those vulnerabilities the Germans might well have achieved far better results than by attacking directly into the Allied strength. Specifically, the British logistics system was extremely fragile, and their rail system had two key choke points, Amiens and Hazebrouck. During Operations MICHAEL and GEORGETTE, the Germans came close to capturing both rail centers, but never seemed to grasp fully their operational significance. The British and French certainly did. After the Germans attacked south to the Marne during Operation BLUCHER, they fell victims themselves to an inadequate rail network behind their newly acquired lines. At the operational level, then, the respective enemy and friendly rail networks had a decisive influence on the campaign of March-August 1918.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{determine}} whether the U. S. Army is adequately prepared or organizationally structured at the operational and <b>tactical</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> warfare and command to execute synchronous information operations in light of recent doctrinal changes. Implementation of the new Army Field Manual (FM) 3 - 0, Operations, will significantly affect the conduct of information and influence operations in the U. S. Army at the operational and <b>tactical</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> warfare and command. Field Manual 3 - 0, published February 27, 2008, revised how the Army views information operations and the staff responsibility for the tasks associated with them. U. S. Army information operations is now doctrinally divided into five Army information tasks, with the responsibility redistributed to different staff functional cells, ultimately to be synchronized by the operations process. The five Army information functional cells possess a reciprocal interdependence with each other, each providing inputs and feedback to the others. This study concludes that a lateral coordination process should be applied to the functional structure of the staff organization to accomplish information tasks. A direct liaison or full-time integrator role should be applied to the organization to integrate IO elements' capabilities and related activities and in order to synchronize information activities. The combined performance and effectiveness of the staff organization requires a lateral process of coordination to synchronize the highly-interdependent information tasks. US Army (USA) author...|$|R
