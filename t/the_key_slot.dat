2500|$|In {{order to}} escape his father, Clark decides {{to use a}} kryptonite key to destroy his spaceship. When Clark puts the kryptonite key into the spaceship, Beck and his FX team tried to create a [...] "virus/fungus" [...] growth from <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>slot</b> to {{simulate}} [...] "some sort of fractal decay". Mike McCormick worked specifically {{on the process of}} destroying the ship, giving the ship the appearance that it has a [...] "nasty skin infection" [...] that is spreading as if it is caught in the circulatory system. Next, Beck had to tackle the problem of the ship's final destruction. Originally, it was intended to have the ship explode, but no one wanted to have to rebuild the Kent farm. Instead, they settled on a giant EMP wave given off by the ship the moment it is destroyed. Entity FX created a beam of light that shot vertically up from the ship's location and then fell back down expanding into a [...] "ripple that spread across the land". This beam of light would create a crater where the storm cellar was, which was dug prior to filming and digitally covered up so as to keep the illusion. One of the final shots of the episode was of Lex watching as his plane crashed into the ocean. In a homage to Robert Zemeckis's Cast Away, Entity FX crafted a digital effect of the ocean water flooding Lex's plane as it hits the ocean. The scene is reminiscent of the same scene in Cast Away where Tom Hanks's character also watches as the ocean water floods his plane as he crash lands in the ocean.|$|E

50|$|While {{the maximum}} range of 2200 yd was acceptable, the Army {{thought that it}} could and should be improved. Ford {{received}} a contract to develop a longer range version in 1963, and returned a slightly larger design the next year. Test firing of the new MGM-51B started the next May, and production began in October 1966. Besides the changes to the missile, the gun was modified. In testing {{it was found that}} <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>slot</b> in the gun led to cracking after firing only a few shells. After further study a version with a shallower slot and new barrel was selected, creating the M81E1/MGM-51C.|$|E

50|$|The door to Aarushi's room (and {{the main}} door of the house) would lock {{automatically}} when shut. Aarushi's door could either be opened from inside, or from outside with a key. Usually, her room would be locked at the night, and its keys would be at Nupur's bedside. There {{was no sign of}} forced entry in Aarushi's room. On the morning of 16 May, the key was found in its shoe-shaped key ring, on top of a framed wall sculpture near the house entrance, in the living room. Nupur later told police that she was not sure whether she closed Aarushi's door the last time she entered the room at 11:00 pm, and if she did, she might have let the keys hanging in <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>slot.</b> She claims to have stated this in several lie detector, brain mapping and narco-analysis tests that she cleared. In 2013, the SP Mahesh Kumar Mishra told the court that, on 16 May 2008, Rajesh Talwar claimed that he had locked Aarushi's room from outside at 11:30 pm on the previous night. Rajesh also told him that he had forgotten to lock his own bedroom door from inside, and someone could have stolen the key to Aarushi's room from his room.|$|E

5000|$|Bank Buster: The {{contestant}} faced a bank vault door {{secured with}} six locks, each worth a different amount ($6,000, $7,000, $8,000, $9,000, $10,000 or $20,000). He/she selected one key {{at a time}} from a set of 12—two for each lock—and a model inserted it into <b>the</b> vault's <b>key</b> <b>slot</b> to reveal <b>the</b> lock to which it corresponded. Finding <b>the</b> first <b>key</b> for a lock opened it and added its value to the bank. However, if the contestant found <b>the</b> second <b>key,</b> that lock closed again and the value was deducted. The contestant could stop after any turn and keep the banked money. Opening five locks at once awarded $100,000, but closing two ended the game and forfeited the money banked.|$|R

40|$|The Retirement-for-Cause (RFC) {{program has}} a target flaw size of 0. 25 mm long × 0. 13 mm wide {{that must be}} {{reliably}} detected in complex geometries such as <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>slot</b> in the jet engine interstage seal shown in Figure 1. A rotating eddy current probe has been developed in an ongoing exploratory development program for advanced NDE methods, {{which is based on}} a YIG (Yttrium Iron Garnet) ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) probe. This rotating probe is designed to inspect the small radius (1. 8 mm) corners of <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>slot.</b> The FMR probe is utilized in an active mode in which it operates as the resonant element in an oscillator circuit (active FMR probe) at frequencies in the order of 800 MHz. A laboratory breadboard signal processor system has been fabricated which converts the active FMR probe output into voltage levels corresponding to it’s frequency and amplitude. It has been demonstrated in previous work 2 that flaw and liftoff information can be generated with phase separation from the frequency and amplitude of an active FMR probe. The data presented in this paper, however, is processed only from the amplitude signal. Due to the physical restrictions put on the fabrication of the small radius active FMR probe, we were unable to achieve flaw/liftoff separation by mixing the frequency and amplitude signals as in our previous work. However, we feel that flaw/liftoff separation from the physically small probes is possible with some redesign in the oscillator circuit...|$|E

50|$|In {{the case}} of Minuteman missile launch crews, once a launch order is received, both {{operators}} must {{agree that it is}} valid by comparing the authorization code in the order against a Sealed Authenticator (a special sealed envelope which holds the code). These Sealed Authenticators are stored in a safe which has two separate locks. Each operator has <b>the</b> <b>key</b> to only one lock, so neither can open the safe alone. Also, each operator has one of two launch keys; once the order is verified, they must insert <b>the</b> <b>keys</b> in <b>slots</b> on <b>the</b> control panel and turn them simultaneously. A total of four keys are thus required to initiate a launch. For additional protection, the missile crew in another launch control center must do the same for the missiles to be launched. As a further precaution, the slots for <b>the</b> two launch <b>keys</b> are positioned far enough apart to make it impossible for one operator to reach both of them at once.|$|R

2500|$|The Athlon Classic is a {{cartridge}}-based processor, named Slot A {{and similar}} to Intel's cartridge Slot 1 used for Pentium II and Pentium III. It used the same, commonly available, physical 242 pin connector used by Intel Slot 1 processors but rotated by 180 degrees {{to connect the}} processor to the motherboard. The reversal served to make <b>the</b> <b>slot</b> <b>keyed</b> to prevent installation of the wrong CPU, as the Athlon and Intel processors used fundamentally different (and incompatible) signaling standards for their front-side bus. The cartridge assembly allowed the use of higher speed cache memory modules than could be put on (or reasonably bundled with) motherboards at the time. Similar to the Pentium II and the Katmai-based Pentium III, the Athlon Classic contained 512kB of L2 cache. This high-speed SRAM cache was run at a divisor of the processor clock and was accessed via its own 64-bit bus, known as a [...] "back-side bus" [...] allowing the processor to both service system front side bus requests (the rest of the system) and cache accesses simultaneously versus the traditional approach of pushing everything through the front-side bus.|$|R

A flow in a clearance and between the cooling fins of the ABB HXR 400 L electric motor is simulated numerically. The clearance is simplified to a two dimensional slot and, therefore, the calculation is not valid in {{the ends of the}} rotor. Furthermore, the clearance is modelled utilizing symmetry and only a sector of 30 ◦ is modelled. The air flow around the cooling fins is modelled by calculating one fin space and its surroundings. FINFLO flow solver, developed at Helsinki University of Technology, is used in the simulations. For the turbulence modelling k-ω model is utilized. Main result: A surface sand-roughness of 46 µm is used in a case of the clearance of an electric motor. The improvement of the equivalent conductivity is 0. 4 % with open <b>key</b> <b>slots</b> and 4 % with filled <b>key</b> <b>slots.</b> A surface roughness of 1. 5 µm has no effect on the heat transfer coefficient in a flow around the cooling fins while a roughness of 260 µm improves heat transfer coefficient by 1. 8 %...|$|R
