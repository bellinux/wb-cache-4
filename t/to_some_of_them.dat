5|$|The Ohio {{legislature}} had elected Garfield to the Senate in 1880, {{and when}} he was elected President before taking his seat, they elected Sherman in his place. Sherman's position in the Senate changed after his four-year absence. He rejoined the Finance Committee, but Justin Smith Morrill, his old House colleague, now held the chairmanship. When Sherman re-entered the Senate in the 47th United States Congress, the Republicans were not in the majority. The Senate was divided among 37 Republicans, 37 Democrats, one independent (David Davis) who caucused with the Democrats, and one Readjuster (William Mahone), who caucused with the Republicans. Arthur's tie-breaking vote as Vice President left the Republicans with a narrow hold on the chamber. Even so, the special session convened in March 1881 remained deadlocked for two months over Garfield's nominations because of Conkling's opposition <b>to</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>them,</b> resulting in the resignation of Conkling and the other Senator from New York, Thomas C. Platt, in protest of Garfield's continuing opposition to their faction. Sherman sided with Garfield on the appointments and was pleased when the New York legislature declined to reelect Conkling and Platt, replacing them with two less troublesome Republicans.|$|E

25|$|Froissart {{described}} a discussion between Pembroke {{and his men}} during the night of 21–22 June regarding how to escape the trap. An attempt to escape {{under the cover of}} the night was dismissed due to the fear of the Castilian galleys, as well as another to enter La Rochelle because of the low draft of the passage. In the end, the low tide left the English ships aground. Castilian galleys could maneuver freely in shallow water. That gave them a decisive tactical advantage. When the fight resumed {{on the morning of the}} 22nd, the Castilians managed to set fire <b>to</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> by spraying oil on their decks and rigging and then igniting it with flaming arrows. Many of the English were killed or burned alive, while other surrendered, among them Pembroke. The Spanish naval historian Cesáreo Fernández Duro claims that the English prisoners amounted to 400 knights and 8,000 soldiers, without counting the slain. Estimates in English chronicles speak of about 1,500 casualties, 800 deaths and between 160 and 400 prisoners. The whole fleet was destroyed or captured and £12,000 fell into Castilian hands. The English defeat appeared inevitable because of the major inequality in strength.|$|E
25|$|Theism {{generally}} {{holds that}} God exists realistically, objectively, and independently of human thought; that God created and sustains everything; that God is omnipotent and eternal; and that God is personal and {{interacting with the}} universe through, for example, religious experience and the prayers of humans. Theism holds that God is both transcendent and immanent; thus, God is simultaneously infinite and, in some way, present {{in the affairs of}} the world. Not all theists subscribe to all of these propositions, but each usually subscribes <b>to</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> (see, by way of comparison, family resemblance). Catholic theology holds that God is infinitely simple and is not involuntarily subject to time. Most theists hold that God is omnipotent, omniscient, and benevolent, although this belief raises questions about God's responsibility for evil and suffering in the world. Some theists ascribe to God a self-conscious or purposeful limiting of omnipotence, omniscience, or benevolence. Open Theism, by contrast, contends that, {{due to the nature of}} time, God's omniscience does not mean the deity can predict the future. Theism is sometimes used to refer in general to any belief in a god or gods, i.e., monotheism or polytheism.Deism holds that God is wholly transcendent: God exists, but does not intervene in the world beyond what was necessary to create it. In this view, God is not anthropomorphic, and neither answers prayers nor produces miracles. Common in Deism is a belief that God has no interest in humanity and may not even be aware of humanity. Pandeism combines Deism with Pantheistic beliefs. Pandeism is proposed to explain as to Deism why God would create a universe and then abandon it, and as to Pantheism, the origin and purpose of the universe.|$|E

500|$|One {{of three}} presidential {{candidates}} at the December 1839 Whig National Convention, Harrison gained the nomination over Henry Clay and General Winfield Scott {{on the fifth}} ballot. At home, far from the convention {{in an era of}} primitive communications, Harrison played no part in the selection of Tyler as running mate. After the convention, a Democratic paper in Baltimore suggested that if offered a pension and some hard cider to drink in a log cabin, Harrison would turn aside from his campaign. The Whigs adopted the cabin and cider as emblems, both of which were commonly seen (and, in the case of cider, drunk) at their rallies, and became symbolic of the party's connection with the grass roots. [...] Harrison rallies grew to unprecedented size, and the candidate made speeches <b>to</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>them,</b> breaking the usual custom that the office should seek the man and presidential hopefuls should not campaign.|$|E
500|$|In Ind's opinion, Tristano's legacy [...] "is what {{he added}} {{technically}} to the jazz vocabulary and {{his vision of}} jazz as a serious musical craft". Grove Musics summary is that [...] "Tristano's influence is felt most strongly {{in the work of}} his best pupils [...] and in his example of high-mindedness and perfectionism, characteristics which presupposed for jazz the highest standards of music as art." [...] Shim too identified his teaching as part of his legacy: parts of his approach to teaching jazz have become standard practice; and [...] "the sheer number of students he taught, which may easily exceed a thousand", tied <b>to</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> going on to employ what they learned in their own playing and pedagogy, illustrate his influence. Tristano's teaching also affected the art of painter Robert Ryman, who had music lessons with the pianist: Ryman's [...] "technique not only parallels music in general but shares the principles of kinesthetic and multisensorial attention to detail that characterized the teaching of Lennie Tristano." ...|$|E

[...] Other journalists felt that Pat represented the failings of the feminine mystique, and portrayed her as being out of step with her times.
