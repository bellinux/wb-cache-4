We shall conquer and beat the Nations of the Earth into the dust and reforge them in our self wrought Image; the Final Society without weakness or mercy, hard and pure. Our descendants will walk the hillside of that future, innocent beneath the stars, with no more between them and their naked will than a wolf has. THEN there will be Gods in the Earth.|$|E

On the [...] "Token Skeptic" [...] podcast Michael Marshall said, [...] "How we try to always pitch it and how we try and run it is - it's all about the skeptical community. Because its being run by people who are just part of that community who are doing <b>this</b> <b>because</b> <b>we</b> really love it, the atmosphere, seems to be, of people coming together.

500|$|Schur {{said the}} writing staff had {{difficulty}} scripting {{the scene where}} Ann kisses Andy: [...] "We {{had a lot of}} discussions about <b>this</b> <b>because</b> <b>we</b> didn't want Ann to be too much of a jerk and kiss a guy who likes another girl, and we didn't want Andy to be too much of a jerk because he likes April. It was very delicate." [...] The episode marked a turning point for the romantic subplot between April and Andy, who shared their first kiss of the series in [...] "Freddy Spaghetti". Goor said filming of that scene, [...] "They nailed the kiss immediately." [...] While trying to get April to talk to him, Andy pretends he doesn't want to talk to her at all, which he incorrectly calls [...] "reverse psychiatry" [...] instead of reverse psychology. This line was improvised by Chris Pratt.|$|E

2500|$|Rodriguez {{made his}} 2013 return with the Yankees on August 5 {{on the same}} day MLB {{announced}} he would be suspended through the 2014 season, pending an appeal, {{for his role in the}} Biogenesis scandal. On August 11, Rodriguez hit his first home run of the season off Detroit Tigers pitcher Justin Verlander. With the home run, Rodriguez passed Stan Musial for fifth place in career RBIs. Rodriguez continued to feud with Yankees management following his return, as his lawyers accused the team, and specifically Christopher S. Ahmad MD, of mishandling his hip injury in several ways; Rodriguez's legal team contends the team withheld the injury from him and continued to play him in 2012 despite his health, and that team president Randy Levine told Rodriguez's hip surgeon that he would be happy if Rodriguez never played again. In response to the accusations, Cashman said, [...] "I'm not comfortable talking to Alex about <b>this</b> <b>because</b> <b>we</b> feel we are in a litigious environment. Hello and goodbye, that's about it." [...] He added, [...] "It's not just Yankees' management. He's putting it at the level of our trainers, our medical staff. The organization. The team." ...|$|E
2500|$|By 28 May several witness reports {{had been}} {{received}} by the police. One sighting of Nelson, at 5.15pm, reported {{that she had been}} with a man who was [...] "very drunk" [...] and was being violent towards her, [...] "punching her on the head". Another witness said he saw Nelson walk past his garden in Newmains {{in the company of a}} man with a tattooed face. A third witness had seen Nelson and a man of similar appearance in Newmains, and said: [...] "He just looked angry," [...] punching a lamp post as he walked past and saying he was going to [...] "kill some cunt tonight." [...] One witness said he had overheard the man, who was [...] "angry and agitated," [...] saying that he would [...] "end up killing someone tonight." [...] Another witness heard him tell Nelson: [...] "This is all your fucking fault" [...] while pointing angrily in her face. A fourteen-year-old girl also saw the pair together [...] "boozing behind Newmains Asda." [...] She said he was bare-chested and sunburnt and told her his name was [...] "Rab Bayne" [...] and had [...] "asked me to rate his body, like out of ten." [...] She described how the pair were drinking alcohol that they claimed was stolen – the male drinking tequila and Nelson drinking vodka. A passer-by reported seeing Nelson with a man with a facial tattoo outside the Scotmid store in Newmains, where she was rubbing suntan lotion into his sunburned back which was [...] "red as a lobster". He said: [...] "She didn't look too happy. I thought it was a boyfriend-girlfriend thing. They must have got something in the shop, sun tan lotion, because as they were walking away the girl was rubbing something onto his shoulders." [...] A shirtless, sunburned man with a tattooed face was also seen [...] "wandering aimlessly" [...] in Cambusnethan on the evening of 22 May, attracting the attention of a family who had gathered to watch the 2010 UEFA Champions League Final on television. One of the group said: [...] "What attracted attention was his hairstyle and his back was very, very red from the sun." [...] Police also received information that Robert Bayne had telephoned an acquaintance on 24 May and asked for help to [...] "batter" [...] the last people to see Nelson. Crucially, the call was made before the body had been identified. The witness said: [...] "He asked me to help him batter [...] I don't know why he said <b>this</b> <b>because</b> <b>we</b> didn't know it was Zoe who was found." ...|$|E

60|$|What we {{particularly}} like about Ram Spudd, {{and we do}} not say <b>this</b> <b>because</b> <b>we</b> discovered him but because we believe it and must say it, is that he belongs not to one school but to all of them. As a nature poet we doubt very much if he has his equal; as a psychologist, we are sure he has not. As a clear lucid thinker he is undoubtedly in the first rank; while as a mystic he is a long way in front of it. The specimens of Mr. Spudd's verse which we append herewith were selected, we are happy to assure our readers, purely at random from his work. We first blindfolded ourselves and then, standing with our feet in warm water and having one hand tied behind our back, we groped among the papers on our desk before us and selected for our purpose whatever specimens first came to hand.|$|E
60|$|We {{crossed a}} street, and came {{presently}} {{to the former}} residence of St. Veronica. When the Saviour passed there, she came out, full of womanly compassion, and spoke pitying words to him, undaunted by the hootings and the threatenings of the mob, and wiped the perspiration from his face with her handkerchief. We had heard so much of St. Veronica, and seen her picture by so many masters, {{that it was like}} meeting an old friend unexpectedly to come upon her ancient home in Jerusalem. The strangest thing about the incident that has made her name so famous, is, that when she wiped the perspiration away, the print of the Saviour's face remained upon the handkerchief, a perfect portrait, and so remains unto this day. We knew <b>this,</b> <b>because</b> <b>we</b> saw this handkerchief in a cathedral in Paris, in another in Spain, and in two others in Italy. In the Milan cathedral it costs five francs to see it, and at St. Peter's, at Rome, {{it is almost impossible to}} see it at any price. No tradition is so amply verified as this of St. Veronica and her handkerchief.|$|E
6000|$|But after {{a little}} while when he grew calmer he {{explained}} to me that the Americans are merely swineheads and that art, especially art such as his, is wasted on them. Uncle says that he has no wish to speak harshly of the Americans, but they are pig-dogs. He bears them no ill-will, he says, for what they have done and his heart is free of any spirit of vengeance, but he wishes he had his heel on their necks for about half a minute. He said this with such a strange dreadful snarl that for the moment his face seemed quite changed. But presently when he recovered himself he got quite cheerful again, and said that it was perhaps unseemly in him, as the guest of the American people, to say anything against them. It is strange how Uncle always refers to himself as the guest of the American people. Living in this poor place, in these cheap surroundings, it seems so odd. Often at our meals in the noisy dining-room down in the basement, in the speeches that he makes to the boarders, he talks of himself as the guest of America and he says, [...] "What does America ask in return? Nothing." [...] I can see that Mrs. O'Halloran, the landlady, doesn't like <b>this,</b> <b>because</b> <b>we</b> have not paid her anything for quite a long time, and she has spoken to me about it in the corridor several times.|$|E
