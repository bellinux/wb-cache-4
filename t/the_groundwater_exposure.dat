40|$|This {{analysis}} report {{is one of}} the technical reports containing documentation of the Environmental Radiation Model for Yucca Mountain, Nevada (ERMYN), a biosphere model supporting the Total System Performance Assessment (TSPA) for the license application (LA) for the Yucca Mountain repository. This {{analysis report}} describes the development of biosphere dose conversion factors (BDCFs) for <b>the</b> <b>groundwater</b> <b>exposure</b> scenario, and the development of conversion factors for assessing compliance with the groundwater protection standard. A graphical representation of the documentation hierarchy for the ERMYN is presented in Figure 1 - 1. This figure shows the interrelationships among the products (i. e., analysis and model reports) developed for biosphere modeling and provides an understanding of how this analysis report contributes to biosphere modeling. This report is one of two reports that develop biosphere BDCFs, which are input parameters for the TSPA-LA model. The ''Biosphere Model Report'' (BSC 2004 [DIRS 169460]) describes in detail the ERMYN conceptual model and mathematical model. The input parameter reports, shown {{to the right of the}} ''Biosphere Model Report'' in Figure 1 - 1, contain detailed description of the model input parameters, their development, and the relationship between the parameters and specific features events and processes (FEPs). This report describes biosphere model calculations and their output, the BDCFs, for <b>the</b> <b>groundwater</b> <b>exposure</b> scenario. The objectives of this analysis are to develop BDCFs for <b>the</b> <b>groundwater</b> <b>exposure</b> scenario for the three climate states considered in the TSPA-LA as well as conversion factors for evaluating compliance with the groundwater protection standard. The BDCFs will be used in performance assessment for calculating all-pathway annual doses for a given concentration of radionuclides in groundwater. The conversion factors will be used for calculating gross alpha particle activity in groundwater and the annual dose from drinking water for beta- and photon-emitting radionuclides. Another objective of this analysis was to re-qualify the output of the previous revision (BSC 2003 [DIRS 164403]) ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Carbon {{nanomaterials}} such as fullerene, {{carbon nanotube}} and graphene are representative nanomaterials and {{widely used in}} various fields. Carbon nanomaterials can be exposed to environments during their production, usage and disposal, spreading to different systems and posing a great threat to various ecological receptors. Researches are conducted {{in order to determine}} <b>the</b> possibility of <b>groundwater</b> <b>exposure</b> to carbon nanomaterials due to their release and passage through soils. If soils can {{play a significant role in}} limiting the transport of carbon nanomaterials, <b>the</b> possibility of <b>groundwater</b> <b>exposure</b> to carbon nanomaterials can be reduced greatly. This review paper presented the research works performed for the mobility of carbon nanomaterials in soil media. Also, the paper provided the factors affecting the transport of carbon nanomaterials in soil media along with the DLVO theory/colloid filtration theory/transport model, which are used to describe the transport of carbon nanomaterials in soil media.

40|$|Under a risk-based {{corrective}} action (RBCA) process, soils and groundwater impacted by a chemical release {{are to be}} remediated or controlled to concentration levels such that further migration will not expose human or environmental receptors to unsafe levels of hazardous constituents. For this purpose, site-specific target levels (SSTLs) must be established for the affected soil mass such that subsequent soil leachate migration to an underlying water-bearing unit does not cause exceedance of applicable <b>exposure</b> limits for <b>groundwater.</b> To derive such groundwater protection standards, a new Soil Attenuation Model (SAM) has been developed to provide a conservative estimate of soil-to-groundwater contaminant release based on readily available information regarding annual rainfall, soil type, depth to <b>groundwater,</b> and <b>the</b> hydrogeologic properties of the underlying water-bearing unit. Using either site-specific or generic site properties, this analytical model can be used either to i) predict upperbound constituent concentrations in groundwater, based on an observed soil concentration, or ii) backcalculate a lower-bound soil SSTL value, based on the applicable risk-based screening level (RBSL) at <b>the</b> <b>groundwater</b> point of <b>exposure</b> (POE).

40|$|The {{coastline}} of China {{is approximately}} 18, 000 [*]km long. In most coastal cities, seawater intrusion {{is a serious}} threat to groundwater resources. Nine shallow monitoring wells were constructed to study the dynamics of shallow groundwater level and salinity in the coastal plain region of Jiangsu province, China.

30|$|Because of over-exploitation, {{the annual}} average {{reduction}} speed during 2007 and 2013 {{is higher than}} that during 2001 and 2006. Under the same land use, the change of exploitation way of <b>the</b> <b>groundwater</b> will cause <b>the</b> change of reduction speed of <b>the</b> <b>groundwater</b> level (Choi et al. 2012). Due to the rapid development of the urban area and increase of exploitation amount of <b>the</b> <b>groundwater</b> year by year, <b>the</b> <b>groundwater</b> level during 2006 and 2013 presents an overall downward trend. In the residential area and industrial area, the exploitation quantity of <b>the</b> <b>groundwater</b> is high and <b>the</b> <b>groundwater</b> level reduction speed increases significantly; the agriculture area is mainly distributed {{in the middle and}} lower plain area of the alluvial–proluvial fan. The exploitation quantity of <b>the</b> <b>groundwater</b> is of small amount and the reduction speed is small; in the middle and lower river area of the alluvial–proluvial fan, the reduction speed of <b>the</b> <b>groundwater</b> level increases significantly. The reasons are as follows: the severe shortage of the surface water decreases the lateral infiltration recharge quantity; excessive exploitation causes the lateral recharge rate of <b>the</b> piedmont <b>groundwater</b> to be smaller than <b>the</b> <b>groundwater</b> level reduction speed in the river area; the complete lining of the Jingmi diversion canal in {{the central part of the}} plain area also aggravates the situation that <b>the</b> <b>groundwater</b> cannot be recharged in time.|$|R

The saturation index for Al-bearing minerals in the fractures, the Mg-bearing smectite group, and illite could not be calculated because the Mg concentration is too low, i.e., below the detection limit (Table  3).
