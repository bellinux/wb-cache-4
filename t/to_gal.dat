500|$|Before being selected, {{the company}} had already been {{in the process of}} {{developing}} designs for a glider which would carry a single Mk VII 'Tetrarch' light tank. The design was a low-wing aircraft designed so that the tank driver also functioned as the glider pilot, and flew the glider from his seat in the tank through a series of internal modifications to the tank. The idea behind the design was to save on specially-trained glider pilots and allow the tank to be brought into action as soon as the glider landed; surviving illustrations of the design show the tank encased in the glider's fuselage but with the turret outside the airframe, possibly so that it could engage targets as it landed. However, the design was considered to be impractical, both by the company and the War Office, and a more conventional design was finally arrived at in a joint meeting between the two in January 1941. It called for a glider which would be constructed primarily out of wood capable of carrying a Tetrarch light tank and two Universal Carriers with a combined maximum weight of approximately a surviving requisition form from the Air Ministry <b>to</b> <b>GAL</b> confirms a cost of £50,000 per glider. By early February 1941 the basic design for the glider had been completed by the company's chief designer, and had been designated the GAL. 49 with the service name 'Hamilcar'; the name came from the Carthaginian general Hamilcar Barca.|$|E

50|$|Galling is most {{commonly}} found in metal surfaces that are in sliding contact with each other. It is especially common where there is inadequate lubrication between the surfaces. However, certain metals will generally be more prone <b>to</b> <b>galling,</b> due <b>to</b> the atomic structure of their crystals. For example, aluminium is a metal that will gall very easily, whereas annealed (softened) steel is slightly more resistant <b>to</b> <b>galling.</b> Steel that is fully hardened is very resistant <b>to</b> <b>galling.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Galling {{requires}} two properties {{common to}} most metals, cohesion through metallic-bonding attractions and plasticity (the ability to deform without breaking). The tendency of a material to gall {{is affected by}} the ductility of the material. Typically, hardened materials are more resistant <b>to</b> <b>galling</b> whereas softer materials of the same type will gall more readily. The propensity of a material to gall is also affected by the specific arrangement of the atoms, because crystals arranged in a face-centered cubic (FCC) lattice will usually allow material-transfer to a greater degree than a body-centered cubic (BCC). This is because a face-centered cubic has a greater tendency to produce dislocations in the crystal lattice, which are defects that allow the lattice to shift, or [...] "cross-slip," [...] making the metal more prone <b>to</b> <b>galling.</b> However, if the metal has a high number of stacking faults (a difference in stacking sequence between atomic planes) it will be less apt to cross-slip at the dislocations. Therefore, a material's resistance <b>to</b> <b>galling</b> is usually determined by its stacking-fault energy. A material with high stacking-fault energy, such as aluminium or titanium, will be far more susceptible <b>to</b> <b>galling</b> than materials with low stacking-fault energy, like copper, bronze, or gold. Conversely, materials with a hexagonal close packed (HCP) structure, such as cobalt-based alloys, are extremely resistant <b>to</b> <b>galling.</b>|$|R
