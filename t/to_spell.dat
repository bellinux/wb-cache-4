5|$|Study of {{the decree}} was {{already under way}} when the first full {{translation}} of the Greek text appeared in 1803. It was 20 years, however, before the transliteration of the Egyptian scripts was announced by Jean-François Champollion in Paris in 1822; it took longer still before scholars were able to read Ancient Egyptian inscriptions and literature confidently. Major advances in the decoding were recognition that the stone offered three {{versions of the same}} text (1799); that the demotic text used phonetic characters <b>to</b> <b>spell</b> foreign names (1802); that the hieroglyphic text did so as well, and had pervasive similarities to the demotic (Thomas Young, 1814); and that, in addition to being used for foreign names, phonetic characters were also used <b>to</b> <b>spell</b> native Egyptian words (Champollion, 1822–1824).|$|E

50|$|Attempts <b>to</b> make English <b>{{spelling}}</b> behave phonetically {{have given}} rise to various campaigns for spelling reform; none have been generally accepted. Opponents of simplified spellings point to the impossibility of phonetic spelling for a language with many diverse accents and dialects. Several distinguished scholars, however, have thoroughly disproven all reasonable objections <b>to</b> <b>spelling</b> reform, including this objection. See, for example, Dictionary of Simplified American Spelling. Thomas Lounsbury presented a devastating rebuttal to all reasonable objections <b>to</b> <b>spelling</b> reform in 1909. A shorter rebuttal of all the reasonable objections <b>to</b> <b>spelling</b> reform was made by Bob C Cleckler in 2005.|$|R

30|$|A third {{shortcoming}} of {{the social}} security data is that the child's birth month has to be inferred from the month in which the mother goes on maternity leave. This is likely to lead to measurement error in the time which mothers spend at home after childbirth. Next, I provide evidence of this type of measurement error. The findings are based on Sample C. I additionally impose my preferred restrictions; i.e. I restrict the sample to women between 18 and 40, <b>to</b> <b>spells</b> longer than two months, <b>to</b> <b>spells</b> that do not start on the first of a month, and <b>to</b> <b>spells</b> that are not preceded by a spell in apprenticeship training.|$|R

5|$|On June2, {{dozens of}} members of the storm chasing and {{spotting}} communities coordinated a tribute to Tim Samaras, Paul Samaras, and Carl Young. Using GPS transponders over Spotter Network, they aligned themselves <b>to</b> <b>spell</b> out the initials of the three men in North Dakota, South Dakota and Nebraska for many hours. The Discovery Channel scheduled a special tribute episode of Storm Chasers titled Mile Wide Tornado: Oklahoma Disaster on June5, both honoring the three chasers and covering the events of the EF5-rated tornado that struck Moore and portions of southern Oklahoma City eleven days earlier on May20. The November 2013 issue of National Geographic, for its featured cover story, paid tribute to Tim Samaras, a National Geographic Explorer funded in part by the Society, and featured a detailed scientific analysis of the tornado itself.|$|E

On the same day that Taft's ruling was issued, Taylor filed suit in Jefferson County circuit court against Beckham and Adjutant General John Breckinridge Castleman to prevent them from exercising any {{authority}} due the offices they claimed. Unaware of Taylor's suit, Beckham filed suit against Taylor for possession of the capitol and executive building in Franklin County circuit court – a court believed to be favorable to the Democratic cause. Marshall also filed suit against Beckham and state senator L. H. Carter to prevent them from exercising any authority in the state senate, where the lieutenant governor was the presiding officer.|$|E
5|$|The Book of the Dead first {{developed}} in Thebes toward {{the beginning of}} the Second Intermediate Period, around 1700 BCE. The earliest known occurrence of the spells included in the Book of the Dead is from the coffin of Queen Mentuhotep, of the 13th dynasty, where the new spells were included amongst older texts known from the Pyramid Texts and Coffin Texts. Some of the spells introduced at this time claim an older provenance; for instance the rubric <b>to</b> <b>spell</b> 30B states that it was discovered by the Prince Hordjedef in the reign of King Menkaure, many hundreds of years before it is attested in the archaeological record.|$|E
5|$|This {{species was}} first {{described}} in 1880, by Gustav Hartlaub in the Journal für Ornithologie, as Sorella Emini Bey. Hartlaub {{gave it the}} specific name Emini Bey in honour of the explorer Emin Pasha, who collected the type specimen in modern South Sudan or Uganda near Lado, and it is occasionally given the eponymous common name Emin Bey's sparrow. Hartlaub's unusual spelling of its specific epithet as two words led some <b>to</b> <b>spell</b> the name emini or emini-bey. No subspecies are recognised, but one was described by British ornithologist George L. G. Van Someren in 1922 from Archers Post in central Kenya, as Sorella eminibey guasso.|$|E

5|$|Fagan's {{retirement}} in May 1985 and Dalglish's subsequent promotion to player-manager meant {{that instead of}} gradually succeeding Dalglish as Liverpool's main striker Walsh instead {{had to contend with}} a rival for his position as the club's manager. He missed 1985–86 pre-season after undergoing a hernia operation. He returned to fitness against Oxford United on 14 September, but had a bitter argument with Dalglish at half-time which initially seemed <b>to</b> <b>spell</b> the end to his Liverpool career as he was placed on the transfer list. He returned to the first team though and was taken off the transfer list by his own request and soon entered a scoring streak, though his form was ended after he ruptured his ankle ligaments in a collision with Manchester United's Kevin Moran on 9 February. He returned to action six weeks later but continued to suffer with ankle trouble and was ruled out {{for the rest of the}} season, ending the campaign with 18 goals in 32 appearances in all competitions throughout the campaign. His injury caused him to miss the 1986 FA Cup Final, though he secured a First Division winners medal as Liverpool won the league by a two-point margin over Everton. His contribution to the club's success was not forgotten as he was named in the First Division's PFA Team of the Year, alongside teammate Mark Lawrenson.|$|E
