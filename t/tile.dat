5|$|A {{subdivision}} rule takes a tiling of {{the plane}} by polygons and turns it into a new tiling by subdividing each polygon into smaller polygons. It is finite if there are only finitely many ways that every polygon can subdivide. Each way of subdividing a <b>tile</b> is called a <b>tile</b> type. Each <b>tile</b> type is represented by a label (usually a letter). Every <b>tile</b> type subdivides into smaller <b>tile</b> types. Each edge also gets subdivided according to finitely many edge types. Finite subdivision rules can only subdivide tilings that {{are made up of}} polygons labelled by <b>tile</b> types. Such tilings are called subdivision complexes for the subdivision rule. Given any subdivision complex for a subdivision rule, we can subdivide {{it over and over again}} to get a sequence of tilings.|$|E
5|$|The tegula (Greek solenes) was a plain flat <b>tile,</b> or a flat <b>tile</b> with raised edges, {{which was}} laid flat upon the roof, while the imbrex (Greek kalupter) was a semi-cylindrical roofing <b>tile,</b> like a half-pipe, laid over the joints between the tegulae. When well-made and {{properly}} imbricated (overlapped), {{there was little}} need for further waterproofing or sealant.|$|E
5|$|A Schwarz {{triangle}} is a {{spherical triangle}} {{that can be}} used to <b>tile</b> a sphere.|$|E
5000|$|Colored <b>tiles</b> (red, yellow, green, blue, purple, and silver); Red <b>tiles</b> {{relate to}} the player's weapons gauge, yellow <b>tiles</b> {{correspond}} to the player's engine gauge, blue <b>tiles</b> recharge your ship's shields and green <b>tiles</b> represents the ship's computer. The purple <b>tiles</b> represent your psi power while silver <b>tiles</b> are intel <b>tiles.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Green <b>Tiles,</b> Gold <b>Tiles,</b> Sapphire <b>Tiles,</b> and Diamond Tiles- These <b>tiles</b> {{are awarded}} to {{indicate}} skill in forming longer words.

It takes progressively longer for burning <b>tiles</b> to burn through the higher value <b>tiles.</b> Green <b>tiles</b> enter the board from the top, as new regular <b>tiles</b> do, while higher-value bonus titles replace random letters already on the board.|$|R
50|$|China Ceramics owns four famous band, namely Hengda (HD), Hengdeli (HDL), TOERTO, WULIQIAO and Pottery Capital of Tang Dynasty {{and largely}} six product categories, namely {{porcelain}} <b>tiles,</b> glazed <b>tiles,</b> glazed porcelain <b>tiles,</b> rustic <b>tiles,</b> ultra-thin <b>tiles,</b> and polished glazed <b>tiles.</b>|$|R
5|$|In 1996, German {{mathematician}} Petra Gummelt {{demonstrated that}} a covering (so called to {{distinguish it from}} a non-overlapping tiling) equivalent to the Penrose tiling can be constructed using a single decagonal <b>tile</b> if two kinds of overlapping regions are allowed. The decagonal <b>tile</b> is decorated with colored patches, and the covering rule allows only those overlaps compatible with the coloring. A suitable decomposition of the decagonal <b>tile</b> into kites and darts transforms such a covering into a Penrose (P2) tiling. Similarly, a P3 tiling {{can be obtained by}} inscribing a thick rhomb into each decagon; the remaining space is filled by thin rhombs.|$|E
5|$|The Euclidean {{algorithm}} can be visualized {{in terms}} of the tiling analogy given above for the greatest common divisor. Assume that we wish to cover an a-by-b rectangle with square tiles exactly, where a is the larger of the two numbers. We first attempt to <b>tile</b> the rectangle using b-by-b square tiles; however, this leaves an r0-by-b residual rectangle untiled, where r0 < b. We then attempt to <b>tile</b> the residual rectangle with r0-by-r0 square tiles. This leaves a second residual rectangle r1-by-r0, which we attempt to <b>tile</b> using r1-by-r1 square tiles, and so on. The sequence ends when there is no residual rectangle, i.e., when the square tiles cover the previous residual rectangle exactly. The length of the sides of the smallest square <b>tile</b> is the GCD of the dimensions of the original rectangle. For example, the smallest square <b>tile</b> in the adjacent figure is 21-by-21 (shown in red), and 21 is the GCD of 1071 and 462, the dimensions of the original rectangle (shown in green).|$|E
5|$|The German missionary Plebot set up {{the first}} <b>tile</b> factory at Mangalore in 1860. It was called the Basel Mission <b>tile</b> factory. Mangalorean Catholics learnt the {{technique}} of preparing Mangalore tiles. The Albuquerque <b>tile</b> factory, the first Indian Mangalore <b>tile</b> factory, was started in South Canara by Pascal Albuquerque at Panemangalore in 1868. Since then, Mangalorean Catholics have been actively involved in manufacturing the tiles. The Alvares <b>tile</b> factory was established in Mangalore by Simon Alvares, a Mangalorean Catholic from Bombay, in 1878. In 1991–1992, out of twelve Mangalore <b>tile</b> manufacturing factories in Mangalore, six were owned by Christians. These tiles, prepared from hard clay, were in great demand throughout India, Myanmar, and Sri Lanka, and were even shipped to East Africa, the Middle East, Europe, and Australia. These were the only tiles to be recommended for Government buildings in India, and still define Mangalore's skyline and characterise its urban setting. Urban and rural housing follows the traditional variety of laterite brick structures with Mangalore <b>tile</b> roofing on steeply sloped roofs. Inside the house, a spacious hall is present while a large verandah is present {{in front of the}} house. The traditional houses tend to have spacious porticos, red cement or terracotta floors, and have fruit trees outside the house. The old Catholic houses of South Canara bear traces of Portuguese influence. The tall windows, pointed roofs, and verandahs are some of the Portuguese influenced architectural features of the century-old houses.|$|E
5000|$|Honor <b>tiles</b> (字牌, pinyin zìpái, lit. word <b>tiles)</b> {{have neither}} rank nor suit but like suited <b>tiles</b> {{they are also}} formed into melds. They are divided into two categories: four Wind <b>tiles</b> (風牌/风牌, pinyin fēngpái, Japanese romaji fompai or kazehai) and three Dragon <b>tiles</b> (三元牌, pinyin sānyuánpái, Japanese romaji sangempai), {{each of which is}} quadruplicated. Thus, there are 16 wind <b>tiles</b> and 12 Dragon <b>tiles</b> for 28 honor <b>tiles.</b>|$|R
50|$|In Super Glove Ball, {{the player}} {{controls}} a virtual glove on-screen. The player {{has a life}} meter that is divided into 26 bars. The player starts off in a 3D room, and each surface of the room has rectangular <b>tiles</b> on it. The left and right walls of the room each have 20 <b>tiles</b> on their surfaces (5 <b>tiles</b> high and 4 <b>tiles</b> deep). The top and bottom walls each have 32 <b>tiles</b> (8 <b>tiles</b> wide and 4 <b>tiles</b> deep). The wall {{at the far end}} of the room has 40 <b>tiles</b> (8 <b>tiles</b> wide and 5 <b>tiles</b> high).|$|R
50|$|There are 35,960 {{possible}} ways {{to select}} 4 of the 32 <b>tiles</b> when the 32 <b>tiles</b> are considered distinguishable. However, there are 3620 distinct sets of 4 <b>tiles</b> when the <b>tiles</b> {{of a pair}} are considered indistinguishable. There are 496 ways to select 2 of the 32 <b>tiles</b> when the 32 <b>tiles</b> are considered distinguishable. There are 136 distinct hands (pairs of <b>tiles)</b> when the <b>tiles</b> of a pair are considered indistinguishable.|$|R
5|$|The {{leaf spring}} {{industry}} has {{its presence in}} Mangalore, with Canara Workshops Ltd. and Lamina Suspension Products Ltd. in the city. The Old Mangalore Port is a fishing port located at Bunder in Mangalore, where {{a large number of}} mechanised boats anchor. The traffic at this port was 122,000 tonnes during the years 2003–04. Fishing is a traditional occupation, and the products are exported to the surrounding regions. Mangalorean firms have a major presence in the <b>tile,</b> beedi, coffee, and cashew nut industry, although the <b>tile</b> industry has declined due to concrete being preferred in modern construction. The Albuquerque <b>tile</b> factory in Mangalore is one of India's oldest red roof <b>tile</b> manufacturing factories. The Ullal suburb of Mangalore produces hosiery and coir yarns, while beedi rolling is an important source of revenue to many in the city.|$|E
5|$|There are {{two kinds}} of <b>tile,</b> both of which can be {{decomposed}} into Robinson triangles.|$|E
5|$|Truchet tiles are square tiles {{decorated}} with patterns {{so they do}} not have rotational symmetry; in 1704, Sébastien Truchet used a square <b>tile</b> split into two triangles of contrasting colours. These can <b>tile</b> the plane either periodically or randomly.|$|E
50|$|There are 34 {{different}} kinds of <b>tiles,</b> with four of each kind. Just like standard mahjong, there are three suits of <b>tiles,</b> pin (circles), sou (bamboo) and wan (characters), and unranked tsū (honour) <b>tiles.</b> Honour <b>tiles</b> are further divided between Wind <b>tiles</b> and Dragon <b>tiles.</b> Some rules may have red number five <b>tiles</b> which work as dora that earn more han value. The flower and season <b>tiles</b> are omitted. Names for suit <b>tiles</b> follow the pattern of number + suit, the numbers being Japanese pronunciations of the corresponding Chinese words.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we formalize {{the concept of}} square <b>tiles</b> with colored corners, {{a new kind of}} <b>tiles</b> closely related to Wang <b>tiles.</b> We {{construct}} aperiodic sets of square <b>tiles</b> with colored corners and several new aperiodic sets of Wang <b>tiles</b> using isomorphisms between tilings. The smallest aperiodic set of square <b>tiles</b> with colored corners we have created consists of 44 <b>tiles</b> over 6 colors...|$|R
50|$|These <b>tiles</b> {{are entirely}} optional. When {{inserted}} into play, one copy of its regular non-red counterpart is removed. They increase the score when melded. Japanese sets typically {{do not include}} the Four Gentlemen flower <b>tiles</b> {{to make room for the}} red <b>tiles</b> as flower <b>tiles</b> are rarely used in Japanese Mahjong anyway. Some mahjong parlours will have their own house <b>tiles</b> which may be red <b>tiles</b> for even ranks, even higher scoring green or gold <b>tiles,</b> or colored wind <b>tiles.</b>|$|R
5|$|Wang tiles are squares {{coloured}} on each edge, {{and placed}} so that abutting edges of adjacent tiles {{have the same}} colour; hence they are sometimes called Wang dominoes. A suitable set of Wang dominoes can <b>tile</b> the plane, but only aperiodically. This is known because any Turing machine can be represented {{as a set of}} Wang dominoes that <b>tile</b> the plane if and only if the Turing machine does not halt. Since the halting problem is undecidable, the problem of deciding whether a Wang domino set can <b>tile</b> the plane is also undecidable.|$|E
5|$|When {{a player}} {{moves to a}} <b>tile</b> {{occupied}} by a Cutie, that creature is slain along with any other Cuties of the same color directly connected to that <b>tile.</b> Chains of Cuties can be slain in this fashion, producing several souls. Each <b>tile</b> the player moves to is drained of life, causing the grass to wither and preventing the player from moving back to it, any Cuties destroyed in a chain outside of the initial <b>tile</b> become eggs. After a set period of turns the eggs hatch into random Cuties, which can again be harvested for souls. Any tiles drained by the player's presence return to life and are furnished with an egg when existing eggs hatch. The result {{of this is that}} every <b>tile</b> the reaper travels on takes twice as long to spawn a new Cutie compared to tiles that housed a Cutie destroyed by a chain attack. Players move to the next game level after a certain amount of moves, every new level increases the time taken for eggs to hatch by a turn. Moving onto a <b>tile</b> containing an egg destroys the egg and incurs a small point deduction, but destroying a golden egg increases the player's score. A golden egg is produced whenever 10 or more Cuties are killed in a chain.|$|E
5|$|A monohedral tiling is a {{tessellation}} {{in which}} all tiles are congruent; it has only one prototile. A particularly interesting type of monohedral tessellation is the spiral monohedral tiling. The first spiral monohedral tiling was discovered by Heinz Voderberg in 1936; the Voderberg tiling has a unit <b>tile</b> that is a nonconvex enneagon. The Hirschhorn tiling, published by Michael D. Hirschhorn and D. C. Hunt in 1985, is a pentagon tiling using irregular pentagons: regular pentagons cannot <b>tile</b> the Euclidean plane as the internal angle of a regular pentagon, , is not a divisor of 2.|$|E
50|$|The {{range of}} <b>tiles</b> was {{expanded}} {{over the years}} and included relief <b>tiles,</b> mosaic <b>tiles,</b> transfer printed <b>tiles</b> and hand-painted picture <b>tiles.</b> Designs included Art Nouveau and Art Deco geometric designs. In the 1890s Maw & Co started making high quality art pottery.|$|R
5000|$|One more example: -5 + 2. You are {{combining}} 5 red <b>tiles</b> with 2 yellow <b>tiles.</b> The 2 yellow <b>tiles</b> {{will eliminate}} (or form a zero pair) with 2 {{of the red}} <b>tiles</b> leaving 3 red <b>tiles</b> behind. -5 + 2 = -3 ...|$|R
50|$|Having drawn <b>tiles</b> {{from the}} bag, players in turn decide to either {{purchase}} or discard those <b>tiles.</b> The {{cost of a}} set of <b>tiles</b> is equal to the square of the number of pips showing in the set. <b>Tiles</b> must be purchased or discarded as a set; players may not purchase some of the drawn <b>tiles</b> and not others. Discarded <b>tiles</b> are removed from the game. Purchased <b>tiles</b> are taken into the buyer's hand.|$|R
5|$|As {{a gateway}} to the west, and Persia in particular, Lahore had a strong {{regional}} style which was heavily influenced by Persian architectural styles. Earlier mosques, such as the Wazir Khan Mosque, were adorned in intricate kashi kari, or Kashan style <b>tile</b> work, from which the Badshahi Mosque would depart. Aurangzeb chose an architectural plan {{similar to that of}} Shah Jehan's choice for the Jama Masjid in Delhi, though built the Badshahi mosque on a much larger scale. Both mosques feature red sandstone with white marble inlay, which is a departure from typical mosque design in Lahore, in which decoration is done by means of intricate <b>tile</b> work.|$|E
5|$|Burns and Rigby {{found several}} prototiles, {{including}} the Koch snowflake, {{that may be}} used to <b>tile</b> the plane only by using copies of the prototile in two or more different sizes. An earlier paper by Danzer, Grünbaum, and Shephard provides another example, a convex pentagon that tiles the plane only when combined in two sizes. Although the Pythagorean tiling uses two different sizes of squares, the square does not have the same property as these prototiles of only tiling by similarity, because it also is possible to <b>tile</b> the plane using only squares of a single size.|$|E
5|$|Decorative tiles {{designed}} by Henry Chapman Mercer—one {{of the leading}} figures of the Arts and Crafts Movement in the U.S.—are placed throughout the building. These tiles (known as Moravian tiles after Mercer's Moravian Pottery and <b>Tile</b> Works) feature deep colors and a handmade appearance that complement the simple brick buildings. The tiles on the fireplaces and entry floors boast patterns in literary and educational themes, such as The Canterbury Tales in the old library. A large, tripartite <b>tile</b> mural on the north wall of the courtyard, also by Mercer, depicts the eastern and western hemispheres united by a ship on an allegorical journey of education.|$|E
50|$|Rummikub's main {{component}} is {{a pool of}} <b>tiles,</b> consisting of 104 number <b>tiles</b> and two joker <b>tiles.</b> The number <b>tiles</b> range in value from one to thirteen in four colors (black, orange, blue and red). Each combination of color and number is represented twice. Players each have a rack to store <b>tiles</b> without revealing {{the face of the}} <b>tiles</b> to the other players.|$|R
50|$|Porcelain <b>tiles</b> are ceramic <b>tiles</b> {{commonly}} used to cover floors and walls, with a water absorption rate of less than 0.5 percent. They can either be glazed or unglazed.

5|$|Few records survive of the Brill Brick and <b>Tile</b> Works, {{as it came}} to be called, but it was {{operational}} by 1895. Jones (1974) {{says the}} siding to the brickworks opened with the extension to Brill, implying that Brill Brick and <b>Tile</b> Works existed in early 1872. This is almost certainly incorrect; no mention of the sidings is made in the Duke of Buckingham's correspondence before 1887 and no reference to the Brill Brick and <b>Tile</b> Works exists in any source earlier than 1895. The bricks used to build Waddesdon Manor had to be shipped by road from Poore's to Brill or along the Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway from further afield before being sent down the Tramway to the site, implying there was no works capable of making high numbers of bricks along the Tramway.|$|E
