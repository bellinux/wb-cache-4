50|$|Horseshoes is {{an outdoor}} game played {{between two people}} (or two teams of two people) using four horseshoes and two <b>throwing</b> <b>targets</b> (stakes) set in a lawn or sandbox area. The game is played by the players {{alternating}} turns tossing horseshoes at stakes in the ground, which are traditionally placed 40 ft apart. Modern games use a more stylized U-shaped bar, about {{twice the size of}} an actual horseshoe.|$|E
50|$|The {{competition}} itself consists, in {{the most}} common form, {{of a series of}} straight throws aimed at a set of standard wooden targets or in some cases foam. Similar to an archery target, competition knife <b>throwing</b> <b>targets</b> have a bulls-eye surrounded by one or more rings. A sticking knife scores points. The thrower must be standing at least a set distance away from the target, with higher distances for more challenging events. KHOIKHOI keeps a ranking of its members based on their performance during these sponsored competitions. The scores achieved at Euro-throwers events can be examined at the meetings' reports.|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} {{aimed to}} see how the family members’ involvement in the practice of leisure movement games (tennis) raises the children’s movement wish and psychomotor skills: coordination, balance, rhythm, precision of movement. 	In conducting this research were used the survey method, the observation method, the measurement-evaluation method and the statistical-mathematical method. Data was collected during 10 months from 76 children, aged from 10 to 13 years (± 3 months) and enrolled in a leisure movement game program. 	Descriptive statistics indicate a significant effect of the variables: medicine ball throwing, speed running, endurance running and <b>throwing</b> <b>target</b> with the tennis ball. 	One can see a positive effect due to the Evaluation – Intervention interaction: medicine ball throwing η²= 0. 12, speed running η² = 0. 13, endurance running η²= 0. 16, <b>throwing</b> <b>target</b> with the tennis ball η²= 0. 21. 	Educational leisure time sport movement games raise the level of driving skill development and psychomotor qualities, based on a greater involvement in the correct performance of sport activities...|$|R
50|$|Most {{versions}} of the game have the players establishing a score with their first <b>throw</b> and <b>targeting</b> the inner bull with their last <b>throw.</b> The <b>targets</b> in between are often chosen by agreement and it is usual to select alternating easy and difficult ones. The selections are then recorded along with the competitors' names {{as shown in the}} adjacent table. Order of play can be determined by shooting the cork or drawing lots. If an odd number has to be halved, it is normally rounded up.|$|R

5000|$|Naturally, the {{simplest}} method of <b>throwing</b> a clay <b>target</b> is by hand, either {{into the air}} or along the ground. This method is {{the simplest}}, and many [...] "trick shot" [...] shooters <b>throw</b> their own <b>targets</b> (some able to throw as many as ten birds up and hit each individually before any land). However, a multitude of devices {{have been developed to}} throw the birds more easily and with more consistency. A plastic sling-like device is the simplest, though modern shooting ranges will usually have machines that <b>throw</b> the clay <b>targets</b> in consistent arcs at the push of a button.|$|R

40|$|A {{series of}} {{experimental}} and quasi-experimental research {{were conducted to}} investigate gender differences and differences across levels of skill amongst elite dart players. Experiments 1 and 1 a employed an identical experimental setting and were designed to investigate gender differences in <b>target</b> <b>throwing</b> accuracy and attitudes towards <b>target</b> <b>throwing</b> among undergraduate students and elite dart players. A further aim was to investigate differences between level of skill for the elite players. Results showed an overall significant superiority for men in <b>target</b> <b>throwing</b> accuracy, moreover, analyses of questionnaire data found significant gender differences in attitudes towards <b>target</b> <b>throwing.</b> Experiment 2 examined whether gender differences in <b>target</b> <b>throwing</b> accuracy may be eliminated if elite dart players undertook the same <b>target</b> <b>throwing</b> task as in Experiment 1 a using their non-preferred hand. The results of Experiment 2 showed that when using their non-preferred hand gender differences in <b>target</b> <b>throwing</b> accuracy were eliminated. In Study 1 data from the same elite dart players employed in Experiments 1 a and 2 were correlated with archival data, {{in the form of}} single dart averages, taken from a 'real world' dart playing environment. A strong relationship was found between the two dependent measures for the men's data whereas results for women, although in the same direction, did not reach statistical significance. Using single dart averages as the dependent measure, Study 2 investigated the extent of gender differences across three levels of skill. Results showed that the extent of gender differences was far-reaching with data from the lowest skill level of men players 8 being significantly superior to that of the highest skill level for women players. There were also uniformly predictable significant within gender differences for men across levels of skill but, interestingly, {{this was not the case}} for women. Study 3 explored whether physical and experiential factors, namely, height, arm length and career span may have an impact on the significant gender differences found in dart playing performance. Analysis of the data found that even when physical and experiential factors were controlled for there were still significant gender differences in dart playing performance. By way of an ex-post facto research approach Study 4 employed a semi-structured interview technique, similar to that used by Ericsson, Krampe and Tesch-Romer (1993), the aim of which was to investigate the development of elite dart players representing two levels of skill. The results revealed no significant differences on demographic variables namely, age, starting age and career span. Variables related to particular dart playing activities were also investigated. In brief, results showed evidence to suggest that deliberate practice could account for differences in performance across levels of skill but not for the superiority of men over women. Implications of these findings and suggestions for follow up research are discussed...|$|R

50|$|Modern {{automatic}} throwing machines {{can store}} hundreds of clay targets in a carousel and systematically self-load <b>targets</b> onto the <b>throwing</b> mechanism. Manual electric target throwers require {{a person in}} the traphouse with the trap machine, to set the target(s) by hand onto the machine arm. For both of these types, an electrical signal, from the push of a button or a sound activated device, causes the trap machine to <b>throw</b> its <b>targets</b> after the shooter calls for their bird(s).|$|R

50|$|For {{long-range}} weapons, the Viking's spear {{was tested}} against the Samurai's yumi bow. The spear was <b>thrown</b> at <b>targets</b> 25 feet away and penetrated wood targets several inches thick. Two spears were also thrown {{at once and}} were found capable of {{the same degree of}} penetration. The yumi hit two dummies from 45 feet. Its accuracy was further demonstrated when dummy eyes were hit at a distance of 25 feet. The yumi was given the advantage due to its accuracy and range.|$|R
5000|$|The bolt action's locking lugs are {{normally}} {{at the front}} of the breech (some designs have additional [...] "safety lugs" [...] at the rear), and this increases potential accuracy relative to a design which locks the breech at the rear, such as a lever action. Also, a bolt action's only moving parts when firing are the pin and spring. Since it has fewer moving parts and a short lock time, it has less of a chance of being <b>thrown</b> off <b>target</b> and/or malfunctioning.|$|R
5000|$|In 1880 [...] "Clay" [...] birds (disks) {{were invented}} {{by a man}} named Fred Kimble, but George Ligowsky takes {{the credit for the}} invention. [...] The Ligowsky target was used widely in the early trapshooting community, as a {{replacement}} for the glass ball targets. The downside of the Ligowsky targets were that they were too hard to break when hit. Fred Kimble made a more breakable target, unlike the Ligowsky target, which was made of hard baked clay, the Kimble target was made of coal-tar, pitch and other ingredients to make it more breakable. There were many different types of target throwers or also known as a “trap,” like one made by Bogardus, which was made to <b>throw</b> glass <b>targets.</b> This trap was able to <b>throw</b> the <b>targets</b> from 28 to 35 yards. It was operated by a person behind the shooter, who pulled a string and released an elastic spring resulting in the target to be launched. The first automatic trap machine (to launch clay targets) was used in 1909. Following the invention of the automatic trap machines, doubles trap was introduced. It was a big success in the competition community. In the 1912 Olympics, Jay Graham became the first American to win the gold medal in doubles trap.|$|R

5000|$|Sport {{psychology}} was a vital {{component of}} McDaniel's courses. To train a student, he would, {{as his first}} step, casually <b>throw</b> small <b>targets</b> (empty [...]22-short cartridge cases, aspirin tablets, or BB's) up in the air, and just as casually shoot and hit them in flight with his BB gun. This move would establish firmly in the student's mind that such shooting skills were attainable, and that McDaniel had mastered them, and therefore that he probably {{knew what he was}} teaching. Consequently, the student was usually willing to accept McDaniel's instruction as valid, and thereafter to do exactly as he was told without objection.|$|R

Objectives: The {{aim of this}} study is determination of any disparity in success rate and darts distribution among selected strongly right-handed and left- handed population of male and female students of FTVS in throwing on the vertically positioned target. Methods: The main research method was used descriptive association method. A total of 60 individuals were enrolled in the study. We used Musalek's test battery (2013) containing questionnaire part, preferential tasks and proficiency tests to define particular sidedness of individual probands. Further a specific task of the <b>throw</b> at the <b>target</b> was employed. For data analysis we used descriptive statistics methods, chi-squared test goodness of fit, analysis of variance, tetrachoric correlation and level of substantive significance expressed by Cohen's d. Results: The results indicated that left-handed individuals did not show a significantly better accuracy in throwing at the vertically positioned target compared with right-handed individuals. It seems that gender is an important factor that affects the level of accuracy in the <b>throws</b> on <b>target</b> because male showed significantly better [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. After {{directional}} sensor nodes are randomly <b>thrown</b> into <b>target</b> area, {{coverage ratio}} often {{less than the}} anticipant value, {{in order to improve}} the coverage, sensor nodes should turn from overlapping regions to coverage holes by a much faster way. In this paper, we improved the existing potential field based coverage-enhancing algorithm(PFCEA), presented a optimization of the virtual potential field based on coverage-enhancing algorithm for directional sensor networks(OPFCEA), we introducing a new-style virtual node to enhance the coverage of boundary region and a new-style control for the rotation angle. By these ways, we can improve network’s performance. This algorithm enhanced the coverage ratio of the network, the simulation results show the effectiveness of the algorithm...|$|R
