5000|$|The {{aircraft}} fuselage is {{made from}} composites, with its flying surfaces covered in doped aircraft fabric. Its 8.80 m span wing has an area of 18 m2. The standard powerplant is a [...] BMW 1100RS fuel injected, four-stroke engine. The landing gear is retracted electrically, with a back-up manual system. The Transat is advertised as the only amphibious microlight that can <b>take-off</b> <b>from</b> <b>water</b> at maximum gross weight in under 15 seconds.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{hydrodynamic model}} tests of Wing in Surface Effect (WiSE) Craft. These craft was fitted with stephull form in different location on longitudinal flat bottom (stepedhull planning craft) {{to determine the}} influences of sticking and porpoising motion performances. These motions are usually occured when the craft start to <b>take-off</b> <b>from</b> <b>water</b> surfaces. The test models with scale of 1 : 7 were comprised of 4 (four) stephull models and 1 (one) non-stephull model as a comparative study. The hydrodynamic tests were performed with craft speed of 16 – 32 knots (prototype values) in Towing Tank at UPT. Balai Pengkajian dan Penelitian Hidrodinamika (BPPH), BPPT, Surabaya. The resistance (drag) was measured by dynamo meter and the trim of model (draft changing at fore and aft of model due to model speed) was measured by trim meter. By knowing the value of model trim, the wetted surface area can be determined. Then, the lift forces were calculated based on these measured values. The model test results were presented on tables and curves. Test results show that models with step located far away from center of gravity of the WiSE craft tend to porpoising and sticking condition, except if the step location on the below of these center of gravity. While model without step tends to sticking conditions...|$|E
40|$|International {{audience}} 1. The {{study examined}} the behavioural factors that influence variation in foraging costs of wandering albatrosses (Diomedea exulans Linnaeus) during two consecutive years. This was performed by measuring simultaneously foraging activities and metabolic rates (W kg – 1) of breeding birds during the incubation periods of 1998 and 1999. 2. A total of 38 birds (19 in each year) were injected with doubly labelled water, equipped with satellite transmitters to measure foraging distance and flight speed, and equipped with activity recorders to measure landings and <b>take-offs</b> <b>from</b> the <b>water</b> surface. 3. In 1999, birds spent on average 30 % more time at sea (11 · 07 ± 3 · 53 SD, days), travelled 43 % further (5473 ± 2348 SD, km) and {{increased the number of}} landings and take-offs per day by 66 % (28 · 1 ± 11 · 4 SD, landings per day) compared to 1998. 4. Energy expenditure rates during foraging were significantly higher in 1999 (5 · 3 ± 0 · 8 SD, W kg – 1, n = 8) compared to 1998 (4 · 5 ± 0 · 5 SD, W kg – 1, n = 11). 5. Landing and take-off rates explained the greatest proportion of variation in energy expenditure rates of wandering albatrosses, rather than total distance travelled, flight speed or time in flight. 6. Despite 18 % higher foraging costs in 1999, the daily rate of food intake was similar between years, suggesting that energy acquisition per unit effort was lower. 7. The energetic cost of flight for wandering albatrosses was estimated to fall between 3 · 4 and 5 · 1 W kg - 1, or 1 · 4 – 2 · 0 ´ measured BMR, one of the lowest flight cost yet reported for any seabird...|$|R

40|$|Medium-sized to {{very large}} aquatic birds of marine and inland waters. W odd wide distribution. Six {{families}} all breeding in our region. Feed mainly on aquatic animals including fish, arthropods and molluscs. <b>Take-off</b> <b>from</b> <b>water</b> aided by hopping or kicking {{with both feet}} together, in synchrony with wing-beat. Totipalmate (four toes connected by three webs). Hind toe rather long and turned inwards. Claws of feet curved and strong to aid in clambering up cliffs and trees. Body-down evenly distributed on both pterylae and apteria. Contour-feathers without after shaft, except slightly developed in Fregatidae. Pair of oil glands rather large and external opening tufted. Upper mandible has complex rhamphotheca {{of three or four}} plates. Pair of salt-glands or nasal glands recessed into underside of frontal bone (not upper side as in other saltwater birds) (Schmidt-Nielson 1959; Siegel-Causey 1990). Salt-glands drain via ducts under rhamphotheca at tip of upper mandible. Moist throat-lining used for evaporative cooling aided by rapid gular-flutter of hyoid bones. Tongue rudimentary, but somewhat larger in Phaethontidae. Throat, oesophagus and stomach united in a distensible gullet. Undigested food remains are regurgitated. Only fluids pass pyloric sphincter. Sexually dimorphic plumage only in Anhingidae and Fregatidae. Selection of nest-site and initiation of pair-formation by male, but in Pelecanidae female first leads several males in a male-selection (or persistence) chase as in ducks. Nest built by female with material brought to nest-site mainly by male. Copulation normally on nest-site...|$|E
40|$|The {{cross-country}} {{phase of}} eventing competitions {{has been associated}} with injuries and fatalities to horses and riders. A case-control study was carried out to identify variables that were associated with increased or decreased risk of a horse fall on the cross-country phase at event competitions. After initial analysis, the dataset was split according to the categories of one-day events as compared to two- or three-day events to establish whether significant risk factors varied between the different types of eventing competitions. Data were collected for 121 cases (horse falls) at one-day events, 59 cases at two- or three-day events and for their 540 matched controls. The data were analysed using conditional logistic regression. The variables of no previous refusals on the course, fences with a landing in water and the combined variable of the angle and the spread of the fence were significantly associated with the risk of a horse fall in both datasets. Additional risk factors for one-day event falls were: fences requiring a <b>take-off</b> <b>from</b> <b>water,</b> a drop landing, the rider's knowledge of their position before the cross-country phase and if the rider received cross-country tuition. Three-day event risk factors in the multivariable model included: the camber of the fence and participation in non-equestrian sports by the rider. This study identified variables that were significantly associated with an increase or a decrease in the risk of a horse fall during the cross-country phase of different types of eventing competitions. Some of these variables are modifiable and {{the results of this study}} have been reported to the governing body of the sport of eventing in the UK so that possible interventions might be considered...|$|E
