Article 20 describes at length the offenses committed by Gaveston; {{he was once}} more condemned to exile and was to abjure the realm by 1 November. The bankers of the Italian Frescobaldi company were arrested, and their goods seized. It was held that the king’s great financial dependence on the Italians was politically unfortunate. The last individuals to be singled out for punishment were Henry de Beaumont and his sister, Isabella de Vescy, two foreigners associated with the king’s household. Though it is difficult <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>why</b> these two received particular mention, it {{could be related to}} the central position of their possessions in the Scottish war.|$|E

In June 2006, Moazzam Begg, a British man who had also been held at Guantanamo Bay but was released in 2005, claimed in his book, Enemy Combatant: A British Muslim's Journey to Guantanamo and Back, that Hicks had abandoned his Islamic beliefs, and had been denounced by a fellow inmate, Uthman al-Harbi, for his lack of observance. This has also been confirmed by his military lawyer, Major Michael Mori. He declined <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>why</b> Hicks {{was no longer a}} Muslim, saying it was a personal issue.|$|E

25|$|Contemporary {{mathematical}} empiricism, {{formulated by}} Quine and Putnam, is primarily {{supported by the}} indispensability argument: mathematics is indispensable to all empirical sciences, and {{if we want to}} believe in the reality of the phenomena described by the sciences, we ought also believe in the reality of those entities required for this description. That is, since physics needs to talk about electrons <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>why</b> light bulbs behave as they do, then electrons must exist. Since physics needs to talk about numbers in offering any of its explanations, then numbers must exist. In keeping with Quine and Putnam's overall philosophies, this is a naturalistic argument. It argues for the existence of mathematical entities as the best explanation for experience, thus stripping mathematics of being distinct from the other sciences.|$|E
500|$|Lewinski was succeeded {{that year}} as rabbi by Hyman Rosenberg, and in October {{of the same}} year a new {{secretary}} was elected, in a close-fought battle between two factions. When {{it was time for the}} former secretary to hand over the financial books, a member, Simon Freudenthal, was alleged to have grabbed them, jumped out a window, and ran away with them. When he returned, he refused <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>why</b> he took them, and insisted he would keep them. A warrant was issued for his arrest on the charge of larceny, and he was released on bail. Ten days later the synagogue president, American Civil War veteran Colonel Solomon Monday, was arrested and charged in turn with libel, for allegedly claiming that Freudenthal stole [...] "sacred books". Monday, in turn, had Freudenthal charged in November with stealing $8 (today $) worth of [...] "sacred books" [...] during [...] "divine service". Later that month both cases were dismissed. In early 1888, another case was brought, and dismissed, over attempts by one faction to expel members of the other faction.|$|E

2500|$|On the {{following}} morning, the clerk of the Crown went through formality of asking if Mitchel had anything <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>why</b> sentence {{should not be}} passed upon him. Mitchel said: [...] "I {{have to say that}} I have been found guilty by a packed jury—by the jury of a partisan sheriff—by a jury not empanelled even according to the law of England. That is the reason I object to the sentence being passed upon me." ...|$|E
2500|$|Delegates {{reporting}} to the Convention presented their credentials to the Secretary, Major William Jackson of South Carolina. The state legislatures of the day used these occasions <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>why</b> they were sending representatives abroad. New York thus publicly enjoined its members to pursue all possible [...] "alterations and provisions" [...] for good government and [...] "preservation of the Union". New Hampshire called for [...] "timely measures to enlarge the powers of Congress". Virginia stressed the [...] "necessity of extending the revision of the federal system to all its defects".|$|E
2500|$|March – Apostle Holland {{addressed}} {{a question on}} homosexuality in the church's first [...] "face to face" [...] broadcast event for youth on March 8. Stated at around 1 hour and 13 minutes into the broadcast, the question referred to homosexual members who felt [...] "scared", [...] "alone", and like they didn't [...] "fit into the Lord's kingdom". Holland respond that the church does not [...] "make any attempt <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>why</b> ... or how [...] happened" [...] and that those with homosexual attractions have [...] "complexities in their makeup" [...] that we don't fully understand. He continued saying that what the church asks [...] "for those inclined to a homosexual feeling {{is exactly what we}} ask for those with heterosexual feelings" [...] and that the church is not making them [...] "second-class citizens", later comparing them to women who never married.|$|E

2500|$|After the albums release, several {{publications}} {{deemed the}} {{commercial value of}} the album as a flop. In retrospect, Minogue commented; [...] "Maybe it didn’t do as well because it wasn’t good enough or it didn’t deserve more, who knows?". She further exclaimed, [...] "Even in retrospect it’s hard <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>why</b> something works or it doesn’t. It’s dependent on what else is out there, the way it’s promoted... The tour {{has been the most}} successful part of that album campaign for me. The album did give me some freedom." [...] In June 2015, publications reported Minogue's departure from Parlophone due to the performance of Kiss Me Once, which she first denied. However, she later confirmed she had parted with the label in December 2015 and would stay permanently with Warner Music Australia; she did announced her album Kylie Christmas that same month, and would be her final overall release with Parlophone.|$|E
2500|$|This {{art market}} was {{established}} in the 1950s in order to give young and unknown artists a chance to show and sell their work. [...] This is still the case today. Some move on from the market after they gain some fame, but others stay here either because of need or preference. One of the latter is Jorge Espinosa Carrizales, who has been selling at the market for over forty years. Because of his longevity at the market, he is nicknamed “el muerto” (the dead one) [...] A number of artists give classes in the market itself in painting, sculpture and even violin, which is given by Espinoza Carrizales at the Serapio Rendón corner of the park. Other longtime artists in the market include Roberto Ulises, Marco Antonio Zepeda, Reynaldo Torres and Armando Anguiano. Some dismiss the market as for lesser talents because of its public character and others because it has become a tourist attraction. Longtime artist Roberto Ulises states that exhibiting here can shut an artist out of venues such as the INBA, but declined <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>why.</b> However, a number of artists from here have been recruited by national and international galleries and other venues, including the Sistema Nacional de Creadores de Arte [...]|$|E

50|$|Psychological noise {{results from}} preconceived notions we bring to {{conversation}}s, such as racial stereotypes, reputations, biases, and assumptions. When we {{come into a}} conversation with ideas about what the other person is going <b>to</b> <b>say</b> and <b>why,</b> we can easily become blinded to their original message. Most of the time psychological noise is impossible to free ourselves from, and we must simply strive to recognize that it exists and take those distractions into account when we converse with others.|$|R
