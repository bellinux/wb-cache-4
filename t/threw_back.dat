5|$|When {{division}} commander Major General Robert L. Spragins {{was injured}} and relieved of command in December 1944, Dean {{was promoted to}} command the division. That month, the division {{was caught up in}} the German Army offensive in the Alsace, known as Operation Nordwind. Fort Simserhof was captured by the Germans on December 19 and the 44th Infantry Division was forced to retreat to defensive positions east of Sarreguemines. On December 21–23, the 44th <b>threw</b> <b>back</b> three attempts by the Germans to cross the Blies River. An aggressive defense of the Sarreguemines area was continued throughout February and most of March 1945.|$|E
5|$|The {{disaster}} at Eckmühl {{was followed}} by another at Regensburg (also called the Battle of Ratisbon) on 23 April, where Klenau, {{at the head of}} six squadrons of Merveldt's Uhlanen (lancers), was crushed and scattered by Étienne Marie Antoine Champion de Nansouty's heavy cavalry. Klenau and Major General Peter Vécsey stormed back at Nansouty's force with the Klenau chevauxlegers. Although their onslaught <b>threw</b> <b>back</b> the leading French squadrons, the French heavy cavalry returned, joined by Hussars and Chasseurs. In the mêlee, it was difficult to distinguish French from Austrian, but eventually the French horse overwhelmed the Austrian flank and pushed them to the gates of Regensburg.|$|E
5|$|Marlborough now {{requested}} Eugene {{to release}} Count Hendrick Fugger and his Imperial Cuirassier brigade to help repel the French cavalry thrust. Despite his own desperate struggle, the Imperial Prince at once complied, demonstrating {{the high degree}} of confidence and mutual co-operation between the two generals. Although the Nebel stream lay between Fugger's and Marsin's squadrons, the French were forced to change front to meet this new threat, thus forestalling the chance for Marsin to strike at Marlborough's infantry. Fugger's cuirassiers charged and, striking at a favourable angle, <b>threw</b> <b>back</b> Marsin's squadrons in disorder. With support from Colonel Blood's batteries, the Hessian, Hanoverian and Dutch infantry – now commanded by Count Berensdorf – succeeded in pushing the French and Irish infantry back into Oberglauheim so that they could not again threaten Churchill's flank as he moved against Tallard. The French commander in the village, the Marquis de Blainville, numbered amongst the heavy casualties.|$|E

25|$|As {{negotiations}} collapsed, the Norwegians {{opened fire}} again, but a sudden ground blizzard blinded the gunners {{and allowed the}} Germans to make a counterattack and break out of their encirclement. The attack <b>threw</b> <b>back</b> the Norwegian forces in the north, whose commander ordered a general retreat to Dombås. On the night of 16/17 April, the Fallschirmjäger under Schmidt—having thrown back the nearest Norwegian forces—disengaged and began {{to make their way}} south in the direction of Dovre.|$|E
25|$|Slade {{ordered a}} charge, which <b>threw</b> <b>back</b> the French horsemen. The British dragoons galloped wildly after the fleeing Frenchmen, {{capturing}} about 100 cavalrymen. Slade failed to reform his troopers and they soon {{came up with}} the reserve French squadron. This unit waited until their adversaries had covered a mile before attacking the disorganised British from flank and rear. The five defeated squadrons also turned on their tormentors and the result was a rout of the British.|$|E
25|$|Diogenes Laërtius {{records the}} legend that Empedocles died by {{throwing}} himself into Mount Etna in Sicily, {{so that the}} people would believe his body had vanished and he had turned into an immortal god; the volcano, however, <b>threw</b> <b>back</b> one of his bronze sandals, revealing the deceit. Another legend maintains that he threw himself into the volcano to prove to his disciples that he was immortal; he believed {{he would come back}} as a god after being consumed by the fire. Horace also refers the death of Empedocles in his work Ars Poetica and admits poets the right to destroy themselves.|$|E

25|$|Believing that it {{was only}} {{necessary}} to deliver a sharp blow to send the cautious Schwarzenberg into retreat, Napoleon occupied Arcis at mid-day on 20 March. Soon after, a large body of Coalition horsemen <b>threw</b> <b>back</b> the French cavalry, but the situation was stabilized that evening after a tough struggle. The next day, Napoleon ordered an attack only to find his 28,000 soldiers facing 80,000 Allies. Thanks to Schwarzenberg's hesitation, the French emperor quickly pulled his army to the north bank of the Aube River covered by stout rearguard fighting, but the Battle of Arcis-sur-Aube on 20–21 March was a Coalition victory.|$|E
25|$|On Wednesday morning, {{hundreds}} of British troops encircled the Mendicity Institute, which {{was occupied by}} 26 Volunteers under Seán Heuston. British troops advanced on the building, supported by snipers and machine gun fire, but the Volunteers put up stiff resistance. Eventually, the troops got close enough to hurl grenades into the building, some of which the rebels <b>threw</b> <b>back.</b> Exhausted and almost out of ammunition, Heuston's men became the first rebel position to surrender. Heuston had been ordered to hold his position for a few hours, to delay the British, but had held on for three days.|$|E
25|$|At the Battle of Monmouth on 28 June 1778, Harrison and his {{regiment}} {{were part}} of Henry Knox's artillery brigade in the American order of battle. After British commander Sir Henry Clinton <b>threw</b> <b>back</b> Charles Lee's 5,000-man advance guard, he was finally {{stopped in front of}} Washington's main line of battle. Clinton tried to break Lord Stirling's left flank, but the effort failed in the face of heavy musketry and effective fire delivered by a battalion of artillery under the tactical direction of Carrington. In fall 1778, Captain James Pendleton kept the regiment's orderly book. He recorded only 27 men remaining on the unit roster.|$|E

25|$|Gérard led {{his troops}} up the heights but the Allied {{artillery}} was well-served and <b>threw</b> <b>back</b> assault after assault. In the afternoon, the Imperial Guard artillery arrived and 40 more guns were brought into action. At 3:00 pm, Napoleon hurled three attack columns at Les Ormeaux and Surville {{and another one}} against the Allied right flank along the Seine. While the Guard remained in reserve, the French artillery unleashed a barrage at Surville chateau. The French finally overran Les Ormeaux, causing the Crown Prince to order Schäffer's Austrians to cover the retreat. As the Württembergers began pulling back, Pajol launched a cavalry charge down the Paris highway against the Allied left flank. At this time, French infantry rushed the Surville chateau and made its garrison prisoners. There were now 30,000 French troops on the field supported by 70 or 80 field pieces.|$|E
25|$|Moyle Sherer, the {{commander}} of the Aretesque picket reported seeing distant movement. The staff officer sent to investigate ordered up the four light infantry companies. This increased the knoll's defenders from 80 to 400 men. At 10:30 am, d'Erlon unleashed the eight light infantry companies from Darmagnac's division. Bursting from cover, the skirmishers rushed forward to surround the Aretesque knoll, followed by the 16th Light Infantry Regiment in column. Though surprised, the British defenders <b>threw</b> <b>back</b> several waves of attackers, but while the struggle was going on, Darmagnac's division was filing past the knoll to reach the eastern crest of the ridge. The 8th Line Infantry Regiment circled behind the knoll so that none could escape. After 45 minutes of fighting, the light infantry companies and the picket were wiped out; there were 260 dead and wounded plus six officers and 140 men captured unwounded.|$|E
25|$|Kleist's Prussians {{rebuilt the}} {{bridge over the}} Ourcq River at Lizy and crossed to the west bank. They swung left and moved {{southwest}} to the Thérouanne stream. Since Sacken had pulled back from Meaux, Marmont and Mortier deduced that Blucher intended to envelop their left flank near Lizy. Therefore, on 28 February the two marshals moved northeast toward Lizy where they knew Kleist spent the previous night. Leading Mortier's advanced guard, Vincent bumped into Kleist's forward positions at Gué-à-Tresmes at 4:00 pm. Farther west near Étrépilly, Vincent cavalry charged and <b>threw</b> <b>back</b> Katzeler's outpost line. The 2nd Old Guard Division under Charles-Joseph Christiani appeared in front of Gué-à-Tresmes and took the Prussian positions under fire with 24 artillery pieces. Katzeler had the Haase Combined Fusilier Battalion, the Fusilier Battalion of the 2nd West Prussian Regiment and the Hüllesheim Combined Musketeer Battalion in line to oppose the French. Kleist sent the Brandenburg Uhlans to guard Katzeler's left flank while ordering Colonel Blücher's cavalry brigade to support the right flank.|$|E

25|$|Wanting {{to secure}} their {{southern}} flank, the Vendeans determined to move against Luçon again. On 12 August the forces of Charette and Elbée joined Royrand's Army of the Center at Chantonnay. Overconfident in rebel numerical superiority, Lescure advised engaging the Republicans in an open plain. Because François Séverin Marceau-Desgraviers carried out an effective reconnaissance, Tuncq was aware that the rebels were massing for a big attack. He deployed 9,000 troops and 31 guns in a double line on some hills outside Luçon. On 14 August 1793, in the Battle of Luçon, 14,000–35,000 Vendeans mounted an assault with Charette and Lescure on the right, Elbée and Royrand {{in the center and}} La Rochejaquelein on the left. At first, Charette and Lescure's men pushed back the Republican left flank and overran five guns, but the attacks were poorly timed and the column of Elbée and Royrand came up too late. After the first Republican line retired, the second line stood up and launched a surprise counterattack. Marceau with some cavalry and infantry <b>threw</b> <b>back</b> the rebel right flank. The Republican artillery was ably handled, inflicting losses and demoralizing Royrand's men. La Rochejaquelein's column only arrived in time to cover the retreat. The Vendeans suffered 1,500 casualties and abandoned 18 guns.|$|E
25|$|During the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965, Guides Cavalry {{was part}} of the 6 Armoured Division, {{equipped}} with M48 Patton tanks. The regiment, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Amir Gulistan Janjua, greatly distinguished itself in the Battle of Chawinda, considered to be the greatest tank battle since World War II. On 7 September 1965, the Indians opened their main offensive with one armoured and three infantry divisions in the Sialkot Sector and penetrated up to Phillaura. However, in an audacious action, 25 Cavalry <b>threw</b> <b>back</b> the Indian armoured division, which took two days to regain its balance. In the meantime, 6 Armoured Division was inducted to counter the enemy on the Chawinda Front. The Guides Cavalry was deployed at Badiana, west of Chawinda to protect the division's left flank. On 11 September, the Indians renewed their offensive but were unable to capture the pivotal position of Chawinda. They also made a flanking move towards Bhagowal and Khakanwali in the west, where they were effectively checked by the Guides Cavalry. On 14 September, the Indians resumed their attack but again, could not breach the defences of Chawinda. At the same time, they tried to outflank the town from the west. It was here that the decisive tank battles of the war were fought in which Guides Cavalry covered itself in glory. The regiment {{was part of}} an ad hoc Task Force guarding the area between Chawinda and Sialkot. The Guides Cavalry was engaged in fierce fighting near Badiana, where it beat back repeated Indian attacks and inflicted heavy losses on the enemy armour. The regiment was awarded five Sitara-i-Jurat for its excellent performance in the war.|$|E
500|$|The next morning, September 2 at 01:30, the NK 12th Division, {{executing}} {{its part}} of the coordinated NK II Corps general attack, struck the Capital Division on the high hill masses south of the Kigye valley. This attack <b>threw</b> <b>back</b> the ROK 18th Regiment on the left {{in the area of}} Hills 334 and 438, and the ROK 17th Regiment on the right in the area of Hill 445. By dawn of September 3, the North Korean penetration there had reached the vital east-west corridor road [...] east of An'gang-ni.

500|$|Carpenter's next {{action was}} with Major Starr on July 3, 1863. Starr had his 400 troopers {{dismount}} {{in a field}} and an orchard {{on both sides of}} the road near Fairfield. Union troopers directed by their officers took up hasty defensive positions on this slight ridge. Carpenter's troops and others <b>threw</b> <b>back</b> a mounted charge of the 7th Virginia Cavalry, just as the Confederate Chew's Battery unlimbered and opened fire on the Federal cavalrymen. Supported by the 6th Virginia Cavalry, the 7th Virginia charged again, clearing Starr's force off the ridge and inflicting heavy losses. General [...] "Grumble" [...] Jones, outnumbering the Union forces by more than 2 to 1, pursued the retreating Federals for three miles to the Fairfield Gap, but was unable to eliminate his quarry. Major Starr who was wounded in the first attack was unable to escape and was captured. Small groups of the 6th Cavalry,"... reformed several miles from the field of action by Lt. Louis H. Carpenter," [...] harassed the Virginia troopers giving the impression of the vanguard of a much larger force. Carpenter became then became the acting executive officer of the Regiment.|$|E
500|$|In 1956 Holloway {{created the}} role of Alfred P. Doolittle in the {{original}} [...] Broadway production of My Fair Lady. The librettist, Alan Jay Lerner, remembered in his memoirs that Holloway was his first choice for the role, even before it was written. Lerner's only concern was whether, after so long away from the musical stage, Holloway still had his resonant singing voice. Holloway reassured him over a lunch at Claridge's: Lerner recalled, [...] "He put down his knife and fork, <b>threw</b> <b>back</b> his head and unleashed a strong baritone note that resounded through the dining room, drowned out the string quartet and sent a few dozen people off to the osteopath to have their necks untwisted." [...] Holloway had a long association with the show, appearing in the original 1956 Broadway production at the Mark Hellinger Theatre, the 1958 London version at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, and the film version in 1964, which he undertook instead of {{the role of}} Admiral Bloom in Mary Poppins that he had been offered the same year. [...] In The Manchester Guardian, Alistair Cooke wrote, [...] "Stanley Holloway distils into the body of Doolittle the taste and smell of every pub in England." [...] Also in 1964, he appeared as Bellomy in the Hallmark Hall of Fame television production of The Fantasticks.|$|E
