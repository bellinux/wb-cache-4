5|$|In a {{land where}} {{approximately}} 90% of the original island forest has been destroyed, ruffed lemurs cling to {{only a small fraction}} of their original range. Completely dependent upon large fruiting trees, neither species appears <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>flexible</b> with its habitat choice, with selective logging resulting in significantly lower population densities. Although they can survive in very disturbed habitats with lower population densities, they are still especially vulnerable to habitat disturbance. Decreased genetic diversity, in tandem with hunting, natural disasters, predation, and disease, can easily wipe out small populations.|$|E
5|$|Smith {{organised}} {{a meeting}} with Johnston, starting at 09:00 on 18 August, where he informed the British High Commissioner that he had considered the Lisbon appointment extensively, {{with the help of}} Dupont, several legal advisers, and a judge of the Rhodesian High Court. The judge had examined the relevant documents, and had {{come to the conclusion that}} Dupont's interpretation of them was correct. Smith therefore felt certain that Reedman's appointment was legitimate so long as Portugal agreed. A long argument ensued, with neither man willing to budge. Smith said that he had always tried <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>flexible</b> and civil, but that he and his government felt they had to make a stand. By making clear to Lisbon the exact nature of their proposed representative, and informing Britain of their intent, Smith said the Rhodesians had filled every legal obligation.|$|E

25|$|Jesuit priests often {{acted as}} confessors to kings during the Early Modern Period.

Advocates of additive manufacturing also predict that this arc of technological development will counter globalization, as end users will {{do much of}} their own manufacturing rather than engage in trade to buy products from other people and corporations.

25|$|The {{superior}} courts {{from the}} provinces and territories are courts of inherent jurisdiction, {{which means that}} the jurisdiction of the superior courts is more than just what is conferred by statute. Following the principles of English common law, because the superior courts derive their authority from the Constitution, they can hear any matter unless there is a federal or provincial statute that says otherwise or that gives exclusive jurisdiction to some other court or tribunal. The doctrine of inherent jurisdiction gives superior courts greater freedom than statutory courts <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>flexible</b> and creative in the delivering of legal remedies and relief.|$|E

However, they were at times dictated by politics rather planning: stops in Ruxton, Riderwood, and Village of Cross Keys were removed due to local opposition, while Mt. Royal and Timonium Business Park stations were kept because the University of Baltimore and a local business group funded them. Falls Road station was built with less parking than ridership required because of community requests, and a fence - erected {{in response to a}} homeowner objecting to the visual impact of the station - prevented riders from accessing a nearby commercial building.|$|E

25|$|Fluids {{that would}} be damaged by heat, {{irradiation}} or chemical sterilization, such as drug products, can be sterilized by microfiltration using membrane filters. This method is commonly used for heat labile pharmaceuticals and protein solutions in medicinal drug processing. A microfilter with pore size 0.2 µm will usually effectively remove microorganisms. Some staphylococcal species have, however, been shown <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>flexible</b> enough to pass through 0.22 µm filters. In the processing of biologics, viruses must be removed or inactivated, requiring the use of nanofilters with a smaller pore size (20-50 nm) are used. Smaller pore sizes lower the flow rate, {{so in order to}} achieve higher total throughput or to avoid premature blockage, pre-filters might be used to protect small pore membrane filters. Tangential flow filtration (TFF) and alternating tangential flow (ATF) systems also reduce particulate accumulation and blockage.|$|E
25|$|When it is dark, {{they use}} {{echolocation}} calls to forage. During daylight hours, they {{can rely on}} vision to look for prey and intruders. The echolocation in T. mauritianus is unique in that their frequency pulses are emitted in patterns of twos and threes separated by long intervals of silence. This helps observers distinguish the species from other kinds of bats. The bats can adjust the frequency they emit to fit a given situation. For example, the bat can decrease the frequency to less than 20 Hertz to hunt insects that are attuned to bat echolocation, which gives them an advantage and increases their number of potential food sources. They are capable of emitting frequencies more than 25 Hertz, which allows them to hunt in less open habitats. This increases their range of habitats, and allows them <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>flexible</b> in their choice of environments.|$|E

500|$|In late May 1797 Adams' cabinet met {{to discuss}} French {{relations}} and {{to choose a}} special commission to France. [...] Adams initially proposed that John Marshall and Elbridge Gerry join Pinckney on the commission, but his cabinet objected to the choice of Gerry {{because he was not}} a strong Federalist. [...] Francis Dana was chosen instead of Gerry, but he declined to serve, and Adams, who considered Gerry one of the [...] "two most impartial men in America" [...] (he himself being the other), submitted his name to the United States Senate in Dana's stead without consulting his cabinet. [...] Adams, in introducing the matter to Congress, made a somewhat belligerent speech in which he called for a vigorous defense of the nation's neutrality and expansion of the United States Navy, but stopped short of calling for war against France. [...] Congress approved this choice of commissioners, and Adams instructed them to negotiate similar terms to those that had been granted to Britain in the Jay Treaty. [...] The commissioners were also instructed to refuse loans, but <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>flexible</b> in the arrangement of payment terms for financial matters. [...] Marshall left for Europe in mid-July to join Pinckney, with Gerry following a few weeks later. [...] The political divisions in the commission's makeup were reflected in their attitudes toward the negotiations: Marshall and Pinckney, both Federalists, distrusted the French, while Gerry (who was then opposed to political parties) was willing <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>flexible</b> and unhurried in dealing with them.|$|E
