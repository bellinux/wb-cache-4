500|$|The airline's {{international}} services with existing cabins feature the fully reclining First Class Skysleeper Solo or Skysleeper; Executive Class Seasons Shell Flat Seat or Skyluxe Seat; Premium Economy Sky Shell Seat; and Economy Class. The First Class Skysleeper Solo reclines fully and features genuine leather upholstery from Poltrona Frau of Italy. The Executive Class Seasons Shell Flat Seat is a lie-flat design {{with the ability}} to lower armrests to the same height as the seat when reclined. [...] Premium Economy is a recent addition, it was first introduced on the Tokyoâ€“London route on 1 December 2007. It features a shell-shaped seat that allows passengers to recline by sliding their seat forward, without having <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> intrude when reclining.|$|E
500|$|The four WindSeekers {{opened in}} 2011 {{are based on}} the same {{prototype}} design by Dutch amusement ride manufacturer Mondial Rides. The WindSeeker at Canada's Wonderland was the first to be completed and thus the first to be tested. It was discovered during testing that the swings could rock back and forth once rotation reached full speed, and were close to hitting each other in some cases. Therefore, hydraulic dampers not included in the original design were added to all four WindSeekers to reduce this rocking. Nevertheless, there were still incidents: on June 14, 2011, the swings on Cedar Point's WindSeeker began to sway in different directions, and some seats almost collided with each other. In one reported case, a rider had to extend his leg to stop <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> from hitting him. In another, a car collided with the kneecap of a rider who had closed their eyes. Official explanations suggested that the hydraulic dampers could fail under high winds: apparently, high winds and the imbalance arising when some swings are full and others not could cause the swings to collide. On June 29, 2011, Jennifer Valentyne of Breakfast Television Toronto rode the WindSeeker at Canada's Wonderland for her [...] "Live-Eye" [...] spot on the show. When the swings {{reached the top of the}} tower, the seats began swinging and hitting each other. As the ride continued, Breakfast Television hosts Kevin Frankish and Dina Pugliese asked whether the seats were supposed to touch each other, but received no response.|$|E

25|$|By 1925, the RNA Council Stand, located {{adjacent}} the Ernest Baynes Stand overlooking the show ring, had been constructed. The Stand was originally two storeys. At some early period {{the northern end}} of the building was extended to incorporate an entrance to <b>the</b> <b>seating</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of <b>the</b> stand. By 1938, a third storey had been added to the building and later a two-storey extension facing Executive Street was constructed.|$|R

25|$|The RNA Council Stand {{is located}} {{to the south}} of Show Ring No.1, {{adjacent}} to the Ernest Baynes Stand, overlooking the show ring. It is a three-storey brick building with a double hipped roof. There is also a small, hip-roofed tower at the southeast corner of the building. At some early period the northern end of the building has been extended to incorporate an entrance to <b>the</b> <b>seating</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of <b>the</b> stand. There is a later two-storey extension on the southern side. The three earlier facades retain their face brickwork with decorative rendered bands.|$|R
60|$|They went, {{and found}} <b>the</b> Captain <b>seated</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of <b>the</b> {{door of his}} hut with his friends round him--all except Benjy, who was absent. They were very grave, as usual, {{desiring}} to be impressive.|$|R
60|$|Months passed. One day, having {{occasion}} {{to go over}} to the Boyne Iron Works to get information at first hand from certain officials, and having finished my business, I boarded a South Side electric car standing at the terminal.

Then he mounted to <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of them. [...] "The weather has changed," [...] he said.|$|E
60|$|They {{drove home}} with the boots {{standing}} {{side by side on}} <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of them. Mr. Jobson got out first and knocked at the door, and as soon as it opened Mrs. Jobson pattered across the intervening space with the boots dangling from her hand. She had nearly reached the door when Mr. Foley, who had a diabolical habit of always being on hand when he was least wanted, appeared suddenly from the offside of the cab.|$|E
25|$|The bomb's orientation, {{positioned}} front-to-back and upward angled from horizontal, {{caused the}} blast to expand vertically and lengthwise. This configuration meant that Ikegami's body absorbed {{most of the}} blast force and the plane's outer structure was spared. The lower half of his body fell into the cargo hold and ten passengers sitting <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>seats</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of and behind Ikegami were also injured; one needed urgent medical care. Additionally, the 38-minute delay in takeoff from Cebu meant the plane was not as far out to sea as anticipated, which contributed to the captain's options available for an emergency landing.|$|R

60|$|When {{they could}} be seen no longer, Millicent let Gaites arrange their hand-baggage {{together}} on <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of them. It was a warm day, {{and she said she}} did believe she would take her hat off; and she gave it to him, odorous of her pretty hair, to put in the rack overhead. After he had done this, and sat down definitively, she shrank unconsciously closer to him, knitting her fingers in those of his hand on the seat between them.|$|E
60|$|Just {{then the}} boy {{caught sight of}} a {{gigantic}} figure entering the church, and darted away to usher the stranger into the pastor's seat; but Gascoyne (for it was he) took no notice of him. He passed steadily up {{the centre of the}} church, and sat down beside the Widow Stuart, whose face expressed anxiety and surprise the moment she observed who was seated there. The countenance of Henry, who sat {{on the other side of}} his mother, flushed, and he turned with an angry glance towards the captain of the Foam; but the look was thrown away, for Gascoyne had placed his arms on the back of <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of him, and rested his head on them; in which position he continued to remain without motion while the service was going on.|$|E
60|$|But {{this was}} not the worst of it. It came out that the whole {{of the back of the}} coach had been taken by a family {{removing}} from London, and that there were no places for the two prisoners but on <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> behind the coachman. Hereupon, a choleric gentleman, who had taken the fourth place on that seat, flew into a most violent passion, and said that it was a breach of contract to mix him up with such villainous company, and that it was poisonous, and pernicious, and infamous, and shameful, and I don't know what else. At this time the coach was ready and the coachman impatient, and we were all preparing to get up, and the prisoners had come over with their keeper,--bringing with them that curious flavor of bread-poultice, baize, rope-yarn, and hearthstone, which attends the convict presence.|$|E

Will anyone offer me one hundred dollars for this superb piece of--" [...] He broke off, and seemed for a moment almost unnerved. He stared at someone <b>in</b> one of <b>the</b> <b>seats</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of Archie. [...] "Thank you," [...] he said, with a sort of gulp. [...] "One hundred dollars I am offered! One hundred--one hundred--one hundred--" ...|$|R

6000|$|They {{walked back}} through the thronged streets to Vauxhall station, saying little to one another, and there Lewisham, {{assuming}} as indifferent a manner as he could command, recovered their possessions from the booking-office by means of two separate tickets and put them aboard a four-wheeler. His luggage went outside, but the little brown portmanteau containing Ethel's trousseau was small enough to go on <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of them. You must figure a rather broken-down four-wheeler bearing the yellow-painted box and the experienced trunk and Mr. Lewisham and all his fortunes, a despondent fitful horse, and a threadbare venerable driver, blasphemous sotto voce and flagellant, in an ancient coat with capes. When our two young people found themselves in the cab again a certain stiffness of manner between them vanished {{and there was more}} squeezing of hands. [...] "Ethel Lewisham," [...] said Lewisham several times, and Ethel reciprocated with [...] "Husbinder" [...] and [...] "Hubby dear," [...] and took off her glove to look again in an ostentatious manner at a ring. And she kissed the ring.|$|E
6000|$|We made {{signals of}} distress, and, rather {{contrary}} to my expectation, the machine stopped. The driver pulled up, and the guard, a half-grown boy, who sat next him on <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> <b>in</b> <b>front,</b> making melody on the horn, jumped down, a strange bundle of consequence and courtesy, and helped {{us and our}} belongings in. He then swung himself into his seat, as the basha set off again, and fell to tooting vociferously. We had scarce got settled before the vehicle was dashing along at what seemed, to our late perambulator experience, a perfectly breakneck speed. The pace and the enthusiasm of the boy infected us. Yejiro and I fell to congratulating each other, with some fervor, on our change of conveyance, and each time we spoke, the boy whisked round {{in his seat and}} cried out, with a knowing wag of his head, [...] "I tell you, it's fast, a basha! He!" [...] and then as suddenly whisked back again, and fell to tooting with renewed vigor, like one who had been momentarily derelict in duty. The road was quite deserted, so that so much noise would have seemed unnecessary. The boy thought otherwise. Meanwhile, we were being frightfully jolted, and occasionally slung round corners in a way to make holding on a painful labor.|$|E
60|$|He {{would walk}} down merely {{as far as}} the Great Vase, so he {{arranged}} with himself. If she were not there--it was not likely that she would be--he would turn back into Albany Street. The newsvendors' shops with their display of the cheaper illustrated papers, the second-hand furniture dealers with their faded engravings and old prints, would give him something to look at, to take away his thoughts from himself. But seeing her in the distance, almost the moment he had entered the gate, it came to him how disappointed he would have been had <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the red tulip bed been vacant. A little away from her he paused, turning to look at the flowers. He thought that, waiting his opportunity, {{he might be able to}} steal a glance at her undetected. Once for a moment he did so, but venturing a second time their eyes met, or he fancied they did, and blushing furiously he hurried past. But again she came with him, or, rather, preceded him. On each empty seat between him and the sinking sun he saw her quite plainly: the pale oval face and the brown shoes, and, between them, the fawn gloves folded one upon the other.|$|E
60|$|He {{hurried back}} to rejoin the ladies, and Boardman saw him, after some parley and laughter, get into the coupe, from which he {{inferred}} that they had turned down <b>the</b> little <b>seat</b> <b>in</b> <b>front,</b> and made him take it; and he inferred {{that they must be}} very jolly, sociable girls.|$|R
