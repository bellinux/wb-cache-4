5|$|On William Cubitt's advice the two {{stations}} in the cemetery were built as temporary structures, in the expectation that <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> be rebuilt once the railway was operational and the issues with operating a railway of this unique nature became clearer.

5|$|A National Park Service {{spokesperson}} {{reported that}} surveys revealed cracks {{near the top}} of the Washington Monument, the world's tallest stone structure, which remained closed for repairs until May 2014. The earthquake severely damaged three of the four pinnacles (corner spires) on the central tower of the Washington National Cathedral, cracked some of its flying buttresses, and caused additional damage. As the cathedral's insurance policy did not cover earthquake damage, cathedral officials stated that <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> raise millions of dollars to fully evaluate the damage and to stabilize and repair its limestone exterior.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, John Maynard Smith, a noted {{biologist}} with {{a strong}} background in aeronautics, {{has pointed out that}} bumblebees would not be expected to sustain flight, as <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> generate too much power given their tiny wing area. However, in aerodynamics experiments with other insects, he found that viscosity at the scale of small insects meant even their small wings can move a very large volume of air relative to their size, and this reduces the power required to sustain flight by an order of magnitude.|$|E
5|$|During {{the time}} that Loring was {{proposed}} for closure, the region experienced economic uncertainty. Once the Air Force made its intent known in 1976, property values plummeted, and people delayed buying homes, fearing that <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> relocate. The reduction {{in the base of}} around 80% meant that possibly 60% of Aroostook County would need to relocate, according to county officials. A $25,000 study, commissioned by the Department of Labor and conducted at Northeastern University, calculated that the region had lost over $14 million in these three years of economic uncertainty.|$|E

5|$|The {{bridge over}} Swinefleet Warping Drain {{was the subject}} of an unusual request from Colonel Thompson in 1906, who asked {{permission}} for 16 of his female potato pickers to cross it to reach their place of work. To access it, <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> walk through the goods yard and along the main line, but it would save them having to walk much further each day. The request was granted, provided that the Colonel indemnified the railway against any claims made if the ladies were involved in an accident.|$|E
5|$|After a brief hiatus {{during the}} 1906 general election, which the Liberals {{won by a}} landslide, obtaining a {{majority}} of 126 seats in the House of Commons, Haldane {{turned his attention to}} the Tangier Crisis, which had almost brought France and Germany to war in December. Sir Edward Grey, the Foreign Secretary, had privately agreed to commit the Army to the aid of France, if attacked, and Haldane began to consider how best to accomplish this. He quickly concluded that there was a need for a regular expeditionary force, specifically prepared and trained for use as a continental intervention force. The question now became how to provide this force, and after a short period Haldane settled on a strength of six infantry divisions and their supporting units. <b>They</b> <b>would</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> be organised in peacetime and prepared to mobilise in the United Kingdom, as they would be committed into action as soon as they reached the Continent.|$|E
5|$|Lee's {{plan for}} July 2 called for Longstreet {{to attack the}} Union's left flank, which would be {{followed}} up by Hill's attack on Cemetery Ridge near the center, while Ewell demonstrated on the Union right. Longstreet {{was not ready to}} attack as early as Lee envisioned. He received permission from Lee to wait for Brig. Gen. Evander M. Law's brigade (Hood's division) to reach the field before he advanced any of his other brigades; Law marched his men quickly, covering 28 miles in eleven hours, but did not arrive until noon. Three of Longstreet's brigades were still in march column, and some distance from the attack positions <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> reach. All of Longstreet's divisions were forced to take a long detour while approaching the enemy position, misled by inadequate reconnaissance that failed to identify a completely concealed route.|$|E

5|$|The {{question}} now became {{how to provide}} this force, and after a short period Haldane settled on a strength of six twelve-battalion infantry divisions with supporting arms. <b>They</b> <b>would</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> be organised in peacetime and prepared to mobilise in the United Kingdom, as they would be committed into action {{as soon as they}} reached the Continent. Because the Army was now geared to a specific purpose, it could be reorganised to fit this role, and any elements which did not support it could be discarded. These reforms anticipated that the existing tripartite division of the Armythe Regular Army, the Volunteers/Yeomanry and the Militiashould be changed into a two-part structure, with an Expeditionary Force and a home-defence Territorial Force based on County Associations. The Volunteers and Yeomanry would form the basis for the Territorial Force, whilst the Militia would be used as a reserve for the all-Regular Expeditionary Force, fully liable for service overseas.|$|E
5|$|The two {{stations}} in the cemetery were very similar in design. North station served the Nonconformist section of the cemetery, and South station served the Anglican section. On William Cubitt's advice the two {{stations in}} the cemetery were built as temporary structures, in the expectation that <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> be rebuilt once the railway was operational and the issues with operating a railway of this unique nature became clearer. Other than brick platform faces, chimneys and foundations, the stations were built entirely of wood. Each station held first class and ordinary reception rooms for mourners, a first class and an ordinary refreshment room, {{and a set of}} apartments for LNC staff. To provide an attractive first view of the cemetery for visitors arriving at the stations, the areas around the stations and their associated chapels were planted with groves of bay, Cedar of Lebanon, rhododendron and Portuguese laurel.|$|E

25|$|The band's {{personal}} {{goal for}} Documentaly was to achieve 100,000 copies sold {{and to be}} able to perform at the 9,000-capacity Makuhari Messe event hall. After achieving this goal, Sakanaction decided to extend this goal for their next album: 200,000 copies sold and two days performing at the Makuhari Messe. In order for the band to meet this goal, they realized <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> reach out to a much wider audience, by agreeing to more commercial tie-ups, which they saw as a challenge for the band to do new things. Furthermore, they felt that <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> consider a new audience: people with no prior interest in the band, who would happen to hear their music as they watched television, as well as a younger audience.|$|E
