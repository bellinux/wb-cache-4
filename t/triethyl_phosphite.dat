40|$|Density {{functional}} theory calculations {{are performed}} {{to study the}} addition mechanism of e-rich moieties such as <b>triethyl</b> <b>phosphite</b> to a carbonyl group {{on the rim of}} a fullerene orifice. Three possible reaction channels have been investigated. The obtained results show that the reaction of a carbonyl group on a fullerene orifice with <b>triethyl</b> <b>phosphite</b> most likely proceeds along the classical Abramov reaction; however, the classical product is not stable and is converted into the experimental product. An attack on a fullerene carbonyl carbon will trigger a rearrangement of the phosphate group to the carbonyl oxygen as the conversion transition state is stabilized by fullerene conjugation. This work provides a new insight on the reactivity of open-cage fullerenes, which may prove helpful in designing new switchable fullerene systems.

In {{all of the}} cases, ph~ 3 sphites {{penetrate}} {{into the}} interlayer space of the montmorillonite and produce solvates whose basal spacing varies depending {{on the characteristics of}} the exchangeable cation. All the complexes with low basal spacing (Li +, Na +, Mg z+, Co 2 ~ and Zn 2 +) are stable in vacuum, whereas those with high basal spacing, formed by the Ca 2 + sample with TMP, and Ca 2 " and Fe ~ * samples with TEP are transformed into low basal spacing complexes in vacuum. The complexes with high basal spacing (Cu ~+ sample with TMP and TEP) are stable in vacuum. The TMP and TEP complexes table in vacuum with low spacing are thermally destroyed in one or two stages with two loss maxima, as a result of partial burning of phosphite molecules. Those with high spacing (Cu 2 +) are destroyed in two stages; the first is probably the result of the transformation process from high to low spacing, {{as a consequence of the}} structural reorganization f the molecules which remain in the interlayer space, and the second, could be associated with the destruction of low spacing complexes.

The proton exchange membrane (PEM) is a key part for the operation of PEMFC. Usually, the proton exchange membranes are made of organic polymers containing acidic functionalities (ex.

40|$|We {{report a}} novel {{synthetic}} approach, with good yields, for {{the synthesis of}} selective dimethylamine-substituted phthalonitriles (1 – 3) {{in the presence of}} <b>triethyl</b> <b>phosphite</b> and dimethylformamide at 160 °C. The peripherally modified dimethylamine substituted Zn(II) phthalocyanines (ZnPc 1 – 3) with varied numbers and positions of dimethylamine groups were prepared for a systematic investigation of the effect of the substituents on their electronic and spectroscopic properties. Compounds show strong aggregation behaviour in methanol and this behaviour decreases with the increase of the alkyl chain length of the alcohol solvents (i. e., from methanol to octanol). The fluorescence quantum yields of ZnPc 1 – 3 showed an excellent correlation with the extent of the molecular aggregation. The versatility of the ZnPc 1 – 5 compounds possessing both electron donating and electron withdrawing substituents at their periphery is investigated towards the detection of nitroaromatic compounds (NACs) in solution and in the vapour phase. It was found that ZnPc 1 – 5 exhibit high selectivity towards trinitrophenol (TNP). A good linearity of fluorescence detection using ZnPc 3 as the fluorescent probe was observed in the concentration range of 50 × 10 − 6 to 450 × 10 − 6 M in chloroform, with a detection limit (LOD) of 11 ± 2 ppm. Stern–Volmer (SV) and DFT studies reveal that the fluorescence quenching behaviour occurs through photo-induced electron transfer from the excited state of ZnPcs to TNP with static quenching behaviour occurring in a predominant fashion. The formation of a porous morphology of ZnPc 3 thin films promotes high selectivity and accessibility to TNP vapours (7. 7 × 10 − 3 ppb) ...|$|E
40|$|Hydroxyapatite {{coatings}} (HAp) {{have been}} obtained starting from precursors of sol-gel type. The coatings previously oxidized were deposited on metal surfaces of a based on iron alloy so-called MA 956. The alloys were at high temperatures, {{in order to improve}} the adhesion with the hydroxyapatite coatings. The sol-gel coating was obtained applying an aqueous route, using <b>triethyl</b> <b>phosphite</b> and aqueous calcium nitrate, as precursors of phosphorous and calcium, respectively. Different sintering thermal treatments were applied on the resulting gels in order to obtain a homogeneous, adherent and crystalline hydroxyapatite coating. The characterization techniques used for this study were optical microscopy, SEM/EDX, XDR and FTIR. Moreover, the adhesion between the hydroxylapatite coating and the substrate was assessed according to the ASTM D 3359 - 02 standard test method. The results of this study showed that the best thermal treatment is obtained for a sintering temperature of 550 °C during a time of 72 h. Se han preparado nuevos recubrimientos de hidroxiapatita (HAp) obtenidos a partir de precursores de tipo sol-gel, depositados sobre sustratos metálicos de una aleación de base hierro denominada MA 956, previamente oxidados a elevadas temperaturas, para mejorar la adherencia con los recubrimientos de hidroxiapatita. El recubrimiento sol-gel se obtuvo aplicando una ruta acuosa, utilizando como precursores del fósforo y del calcio trietilfosfito y nitrato cálcico tetrahidratado, respectivamente. Sobre los geles resultantes se aplicaron distintos tratamientos térmicos de sinterización, hasta la obtención de recubrimientos de hidroxiapatita homogéneos, adherentes y cristalinos. Las técnicas de caracterización utilizadas para realizar este estudio han sido microscopía óptica, MBE/EDX, DRX y FTIR. Así mismo, se ha determinado la adherencia entre el substrato y el recubrimiento de hidroxiapatita según la norma ASTM D 3359 - 02. Los resultados obtenidos han mostrado que el tratamiento térmico óptimo se consigue cuando se aplica una temperatura de sinterización de 550 °C durante un tiempo igual a 72 h...|$|E
40|$|Currently, most {{titanium}} implant coatings {{are made}} using hydroxyapatite and a plasma-spraying technique. There are however limitations {{associated with the}} plasma-spraying process including; poor adherence, high porosity and cost. An alternative - the sol-gel technique offers many potential advantages but is currently lacking research data for this application. Hydroxyapatite (HA), fluorhydroxyapatite (FHA) and fluorapatite (FA) have been synthesised by a sol-gel method. Calcium nitrate and <b>triethyl</b> <b>phosphite</b> were used as precursors under an ethanol-water based solution. Different amounts of ammonium fluoride (NH 4 F) were incorporated for {{the preparation of the}} FHA and FA sol-gels. Optimisation and characterisation of the sol-gels was carried out using, X-ray Diffraction (XRD), High Temperature X-Ray Diffraction (HTXRD), Fourier Transform Infrared Analysis (FTIR) and Differential Thermal Analysis (DTA). Rheology and hydrophilicity of the sol-gels showed that increasing fluoride ion substitution caused an increase in viscosity and contact angle. The dissolution (Ca 2 + and PO 4 3 -rates) rates of the fluoride-substituted powders from the sol-gels were considerably lower than that of HA and all rates could be decreased by increasing the sintering temperature. This suggests the possibility of tailoring the solubility of any coatings made from the sol-gels through fluoride ion substitution and increased sintering temperature. A spin coating protocol has been established for coating the sol-gels onto titanium. Increasing the coating speed decreased the porosity and thickness of the coatings. Bond strengths to titanium were investigated. Fluoride substitution and sintering temperature were shown to be important factors. Cellular proliferation studies revealed that increasing the level of fluoride substitution in the apatite structure significantly increased the biocompatibility of the material. The sol-gel technique may be an alternative to plasma spraying for coating titanium implants. Furthermore it may also be suitable for producing HA, FHA and FA as bone grafting materials. ...|$|E
