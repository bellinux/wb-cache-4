40|$|A {{prerequisite}} for receiving protection through investment arbitration for foreign investments under investment protection treaties {{is that the}} investments concerned satisfy the definitions of "investor" and "investment" in those treaties. To date, however, the interpretation of provisions concerning the definition of investors and investments {{has given rise to}} a variety of legal problems. With regard to the concept of an investor, a major point at issue is that of how to construe the nationality requirements, and in arbitral awards that have been made to date, the following two issues in particular have been disputed. (i) When the link between an investor and the investing country is weak, and in fact a national of a third country controls that investor, the point at issue is whether the said investor is qualified as a national of the investing country to file an investment arbitration claim. (ii) Even if a company is established in the recipient country, if it is controlled by a national of another country (a signatory to an investment protection treaty) it can file for investment arbitration against the recipient country on the basis of paragraph 2 (b) of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, but the point at issue is whether simply holding shares in a local company is sufficient to constitute control as defined here (or in other words, whether a local company can file a claim even when a top parent company residing in a country that has not concluded an investment protection treaty has effective management control of the local company). On these issues the stance shown by some arbitral awards has in principle been to respect the intentions of the countries or private actors that have been party to the investment protection treaties or investment agreements, and they have recognized jurisdiction for arbitration in the above two situations unless there have been special provisions limiting the eligibility of investors for protection. Nevertheless, if a firm is established as a corporation of convenience in a country that has concluded an investment protection treaty {{for the sole purpose of}} obtaining arbitration jurisdiction, and even if the treaty contains no provisions for refusing protection to such investors, an arbitral tribunal still could exercise its own discretion to deny jurisdiction, for example by piercing the corporate veil. Therefore, although the eligibility of the investors to enjoy protection is in principle subject to the intensions of the parties to the agreements concerned, an arbitral tribunal could conclude otherwise if they were inconsistent with the object and purpose of those agreements. The same is true with regard to the concept of investment. That is, parties to an investment protection treaty can freely determine what sort of investments would fall under the treaty's protection, and can also make it a condition for protection that foreign investment must be made in accordance with <b>the</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>rules</b> of the recipient country. However, according to some arbitral awards, the concept of investment in Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, for example, implicitly includes objective requirements to be satisfied by all investments in order to fall within the coverage of protection, rejecting subjective modifications by the contracting states. In addition, there have been a couple of cases in which even where foreign investments violate the laws and regulations of the recipient country, and arbitral jurisdiction would have been denied if the provision of compliance with domestic rules had been applied in an automatic manner, what in fact happened was that after taking into account the circumstances of each case and the object and purpose of the investment protection agreements concerned, arbitral tribunals resorted to their own rational judgments to affirm jurisdiction. Accordingly, with regard to the concept of investment, too, the scope of protection is determined by a combination of the intentions of the parties concerned and the tribunals' original evaluations. ...|$|E

Finally, the assistance of experts may be necessary in some cases, but full-fledged party-appointed expert testimony will rarely be a cost-effective option.

40|$|The exact {{definition}} of the substantive scope of the United Nations Convention on Contracts für the International Sale of Goods (CISG) of 11 April 1980 is a difficult but necessary task: Necessary because the scope determines over which <b>domestic</b> <b>rules</b> of law <b>the</b> Convention prevails, thereby preempting <b>the</b> concurrent <b>domestic</b> law’s application, and difficult because the CISG itself provides limited guidance about the method through which this definition is to be achieved. This article commences by discussing two approaches used in this regard in case law and legal writings on the Convention: (1) the reliance on Article 4 CISG, and (2) the use of dogmatic categories of domestic law such as "contract" and "tort". Both are found wanting, in particular in light of Article 7 (1) CISG calling for an internationally uniform interpretation of the Convention’s scope. Against this background, the article develops a novel two-step approach with Article 7 (1) CISG in mind. According to this approach, a <b>domestic</b> law <b>rule</b> is displaced by the Convention if (1) it is triggered by a factual situation which the Convention also applies to (the "factual" criterion), and (2) it pertains to a matter that is also regulated by the Convention (the "legal" criterion). Only if both criteria are cumulatively fulfilled, <b>the</b> <b>domestic</b> law <b>rule</b> concerned overlaps with the Convention’s sphere of application {{in a way that}} will generally result in its preemption.

40|$|Applying a {{stochastic}} dynamic general equilibrium model, {{the performance}} of various simple rules is analyzed in a small open economy context. The aspects that are considered in the analysis include the degree of exchange rate pass-through, trade openness, the policy objective and the source and persistency of shocks. The main objective of this analysis is to investigate if the rule reacts to exchange rate performs better than the basic closed economy rule without exchange rate term. Comparison on the performances is also made between the consumer inflation targeting and <b>domestic</b> inflation targeting <b>rules.</b> <b>The</b> results show that adding the exchange rate term to the policy rule enhances improvement especially in the higher pass-through case. The superior rule is the hybrid rule that reacts to the exchange rate term.

However, more complicated <b>domestic</b> inflation targeting <b>rules</b> generate lower loss in term of relative loss.
