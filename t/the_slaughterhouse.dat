5|$|Born {{and raised}} in Indianapolis, Indiana, Vonnegut {{attended}} Cornell University, but dropped out in January 1943 and enlisted in the United States Army. As part of his training, he studied mechanical engineering at Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University) and the University of Tennessee. He was then deployed to Europe to fight in World War II, and was captured by the Germans during the Battle of the Bulge. He was interned in Dresden and survived the Allied bombing of the city by taking refuge in a meat locker of <b>the</b> <b>slaughterhouse</b> where he was imprisoned. After the war, Vonnegut married Jane Marie Cox, {{with whom he had}} three children. He later adopted his sister's three sons, after she died of cancer and her husband died in a train accident.|$|E
5|$|With the {{development}} of the rail network, Roskilde became an important hub for traffic with Copenhagen. In the 1870s and 1880s, the harbour was extended attracting industrial firms to the area. By the end of the century, there were tobacco factories, iron foundries and machine shops. At the beginning of the 20th century, Roskilde first prospered as a satellite community for Copenhagen but then, as ships increased in size, suffered {{from the fact that the}} harbour was too small and Roskilde Fjord too shallow for navigation. Industries began to move out of the harbour area but were still the largest source of employment, thanks in part to the spirits factory (De Danske Spritfabrikker) and <b>the</b> <b>slaughterhouse</b> (Roskilde Andelssvineslagteri).|$|E

A feasibility project to investigate the site's potential was proposed by the County Council in 2009.|$|R

40|$|In Aomori Prefecture {{agriculture}} {{rice and}} apples {{are the main}} produce. However, {{there is a difference}} between each zone in the prefecture. The productivity of Livestock is high in the Kennan Area, which lies on the Pacific Ocean side of the prefecture. Therefore, it is thought that the livestock industry greatly influences Aomori Prefecture agriculture. The slaughtering process is indispensable in making meat a commodity. <b>The</b> <b>slaughterhouses,</b> which process livestock, have been rapidly reorganized. “The Slaughterhouse Law” was revised to prevent food poisoning caused by contaminated meat in 1996. This revision was promoted by a case of food poisoning by E. coli O- 157. For this revision, <b>the</b> <b>slaughterhouses</b> need to achieve of a high standard in the short term. And each slaughterhouse requires a huge investment in capital. The characteristics and the management problems of <b>the</b> <b>slaughterhouses</b> in Aomori Prefecture are clarified in this paper. As a result of the research, the following two points were clarified as characteristics of slaughterhouse management in Aomori Prefecture. First, for <b>the</b> <b>slaughterhouses</b> in Aomori Prefecture, the ratio of pigs is high and the ratio of dairy cattle is high. However the most of the beef cattle is carried outside the prefecture while lived. Therefore, the ratio slaughtered at <b>the</b> <b>slaughterhouses</b> in Aomori prefecture is lower than the other livestock. Secondly, after the 90 ’s the number slaughtered decreased in Aomori prefecture. However, in some <b>slaughterhouses,</b> <b>the</b> slaughtered number decreased. In the number of livestock slaughtered, <b>the</b> differences among <b>slaughterhouses</b> are formed. This means the collecting of livestock competition is fierce among <b>slaughterhouses.</b> <b>The</b> cause of the management problems in <b>the</b> <b>slaughterhouses</b> is; that while the numbers slaughtered livestock decrease, revenue and expenditure deteriorate. And, “The Slaughterhouse Law” is revised in such a situation and, as a result, it is necessary to increase the investment capital. This too is the main management problem...|$|R
5|$|In 1893, Esbjerg {{became a}} {{municipality}} {{in its own}} right (initially known as Esbjerg Ladeplads), receiving the status and privileges of a market town in 1899 and incorporating the parish of Jerne (east of the centre) in 1945. A number of institutions and facilities were soon established, including the courthouse and town hall (1891), the gas and waterworks (1896) and the power plant (1907). From the beginning of the 20th century, Esbjerg prospered not only as a fishing port but became one of the country's major export centres. Established in 1895 by nine local dairies, the butter-packaging factory, Dansk Andels Smørpakkeri, employed some 150 workers until 1920, packing and dispatching butter for the London market. It was later extended to include egg marketing under the name Dansk Andels Ægeksport. Ultimately, it handled produce from 140 dairies spread across the whole of Jutland. After the Second World War, the town developed several agricultural industries, especially meat processing and packaging with a plant employing over 300. <b>The</b> <b>slaughterhouse</b> and meat packaging facility, Esbjerg Andels-Slagteri, established in 1887, became Denmark's sixth largest by 1962. It later became part of Vestjyske Slagterier in 1986, and in 2001, it was acquired by Danish Crown.|$|E
5|$|There are {{a number}} of listed {{structures}} in the grounds of Dunham Massey Hall, including the 1720 wellhouse that supplied water to the hall until the 1860s, and the early-18th-century ornamental sundial in front of the hall, depicting a black slave clad in leaves, carrying the sundial above his head. The stable buildings, <b>the</b> <b>slaughterhouse,</b> the deer house, the orangery, and an ashlar shelter {{to the west of the}} hall, all date from the 17th or 18th century. Barn Cottages date from at least 1751. The cottages were originally a single barn, which was converted in the 19th century. Other grade II listed structures in the grounds of the hall include: the lakeside wall (18th century); two small piers south of the garden forecourt (18th century); a pier north west of the garden forecourt (18th century); the gateway opposite the kitchen (1750); the piers at the south of forecourt garden topped with lions (18th century); and an obelisk erected by George, 2nd Earl of Warrington, in 1714 in memory of his mother. Near the hall there is a Grade II* listed sawmill, probably built in 1616.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> {{original}} <b>slaughterhouse</b> {{workers were}} largely recent immigrants of Irish, German, and Scandinavian background. In <b>the</b> <b>slaughterhouses,</b> {{they worked in}} difficult conditions. Not only were they required to slaughter and dismember enormous numbers of animals each day, but they were exposed to poor environmental conditions, including leaks of contaminated water, liquid waste and sewage across the floors, and poorly lit, cold rooms. Both injuries and illness were commonplace among workers. In addition, most workers lived in slums next to <b>the</b> <b>slaughterhouses.</b>|$|R
30|$|Changes in {{the roles}} and {{responsibilities}} of slaughterhouse operators have also been witnessed with the dispensation of the county governments.

25|$|Upon {{reaching}} a predetermined age or weight, livestock are usually transported en masse to <b>the</b> <b>slaughterhouse.</b> Depending on its length and circumstances, this may exert stress and injuries on the animals, and some may die en route. Unnecessary stress in transport may adversely affect {{the quality of}} the meat. In particular, the muscles of stressed animals are low in water and glycogen, and their pH fails to attain acidic values, all of which results in poor meat quality. Consequently, and also due to campaigning by animal welfare groups, laws and industry practices in several countries tend to become more restrictive with respect to the duration and other circumstances of livestock transports.|$|E

25|$|In <b>the</b> <b>Slaughterhouse</b> cases Carpenter {{represented}} the Crescent City Livestock Landing and Slaughterhouse Company, {{which had been}} granted a monopoly on all slaughterhouse business in New Orleans by the carpetbag state legislature of Louisiana in 1869. Butchers and cattle dealers thrown out of work by the law obtained an injunction from a district court, claiming they had been denied equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment and deprived of property under the due process clause. Making a plea for states' rights, Carpenter contended that the amendment had been intended solely to elevate African Americans and had no bearing on economic statutes passed by a state. He also warned of too many powers being centralized in the federal government. The court concurred in Carpenter's narrowing {{of the scope of}} the Fourteenth Amendment.|$|E
25|$|In a Year of Thirteen Moons (In einem Jahr mit 13 Monden, 1978) is Fassbinder most {{personal}} and bleakest work. The film follows the tragic life of Elvira, a transsexual {{formerly known as}} Erwin.

In one sequence, Elvira wanders through <b>the</b> <b>slaughterhouse</b> where she worked as Erwin, recounting her history amid the meat-hooked corpses of cattle whose slit throats rain blood onto the floor. In another scene, Elvira returns to the orphanage where she was raised by nuns and hears the brutal story of her childhood. Fassbinder's camera tracks the nun (played by his mother) telling Elvira's story; she moves with a kind of military precision through the grounds, recounting the story in blazing detail, unaware that Elvira had collapsed and can no longer hear it.|$|E
500|$|The Supreme Court's 1873 Slaughterhouse Cases {{decision}} {{contained the}} statement that [...] "The phrase, 'subject to its jurisdiction,' was intended to exclude from its operation children of ministers, consuls, and citizens or subjects of foreign states born within the United States." [...] However, since <b>the</b> <b>Slaughterhouse</b> Cases did not deal with claims of birthright citizenship, this comment was dismissed in Wong Kim Ark and later cases as a passing remark (obiter dictum) lacking any force as a controlling precedent. [...] As to whether the Wong Kim Ark was correct on this point or not, modern scholars are divided.|$|E

500|$|There {{has been}} a growing {{movement}} by the co-operatives to centralise <b>the</b> <b>slaughterhouse</b> and bacon processing plants into ever larger establishments. [...] The plants have been moved out of Denmark to more economically advantageous locations and this has partially happened to the slaughterhouses too, leaving Denmark to concentrate on just the raising of the pigs. [...] In the 1960s, vacuum packing and automated slicing were introduced, which were carried out in plants in the UK. [...] In the 1970s, mixed farms were still common, but farms then became more specialised in pig rearing and the process more industrialised.

500|$|Quoting approvingly from an 1812 case, The Schooner Exchange v.

[...] An act of Congress, they held, does not trump the Constitution; such a law [...] "cannot control [...] meaning, or impair its effect, but must be construed and executed in subordination to its provisions." [...] The majority opinion referred to Calvin's Case (1608) as stating the fundamental common law principle that all people born within the King's [...] "allegiance" [...] were subjects, including children of [...] "aliens in amity".|$|E
500|$|By {{the time}} of the First World War, the Suffolk Punch had become a popular work horse on large farms in East Anglia due to its good {{temperament}} and excellent work ethic. It remained popular until the Second World War, when a combination of the need for increased wartime food production (which resulted in many horses being sent to <b>the</b> <b>slaughterhouse),</b> and increased farm mechanisation which followed the war decimated population numbers. Only nine foals were registered with the Suffolk Horse Society in 1966, but there has been a revival of interest in the breed since the late 1960s and numbers have risen continuously. The breed did remain rare, and in 1998 there were only 80 breeding mares in Britain, producing around 40 foals per year. [...] In the United States, the American Suffolk Horse Association became inactive after the war and remained so for 15years, but restarted in May 1961 as the draught horse market began to recover. In the 1970s and early 1980s, the American registry allowed some Belgians to be bred to Suffolk Punches, but only the fillies from these crosses were permitted registry with the American Suffolk Horse Association.|$|E

500|$|As {{part of its}} 2001 guidelines, Burger King {{stated that}} it would begin {{conducting}} announced and unannounced inspections of <b>the</b> <b>slaughterhouses</b> {{for all of its}} meat suppliers and take action against facilities that fail those inspections. It would establish animal-handling verification guidelines for all <b>the</b> <b>slaughterhouses</b> of its suppliers. The company would require its suppliers to confine no more than five hens in each battery cage, that the birds be able to stand fully upright, and require the presence of two water drinkers per cage. It would stop purchasing from suppliers who engage in the forced molting of hens, develop auditing procedures for the handling of [...] "broiler" [...] chickens, and institute humane handling procedures for chickens at slaughterhouses. It would begin purchasing pork from farms that do not confine sows to stalls.|$|R
2500|$|In response, a New Orleans {{grand jury}} {{recommended}} that <b>the</b> <b>slaughterhouses</b> be moved south, but {{since many of}} <b>the</b> <b>slaughterhouses</b> were outside city limits, the grand jury's recommendations carried no weight.

As a result, in 1869, the Louisiana legislature passed [...] "An Act to Protect the Health of the City of New Orleans, to Locate the Stock Landings and Slaughter Houses, and to incorporate the Crescent City Livestock Landing and Slaughter-House Company," [...] which allowed the city of New Orleans to create a corporation that centralized all <b>slaughterhouse</b> operations in <b>the</b> city. At the time, New York City, San Francisco, Boston, Milwaukee, and Philadelphia had similar provisions to confine butchers to areas that kept offal from contaminating the water supply.|$|R
