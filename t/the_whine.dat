500|$|Despite {{the fact}} that Larkin made audio {{recordings}} (in studio conditions) of each of his three mature collections, and separate recordings of [...] groups of poems {{for a number of}} audio anthologies, he somehow gained a reputation as a poet who was reluctant to make recordings in which he read his own work. While Larkin did express a dislike of the sound of his own voice ("I come from Coventry, between the sloppiness of Leicester and <b>the</b> <b>whine</b> of Birmingham, you know—and sometimes it comes out"), the evidence indicates that this influenced more his preference not to give public readings of his own work, than his willingness to make audio recordings of his poems.|$|E
2500|$|Ellison {{published}} {{two stories}} in the Cleveland News during 1949, and he sold a story to EC Comics early in the 1950s. Ellison moved to New York City in 1955 to pursue a writing career, primarily in science fiction. Over the next two years, he published more than 100 short stories and articles. He married Charlotte Stein in 1956, but they divorced four years later. He said of the marriage, [...] "four years of hell as sustained as <b>the</b> <b>whine</b> of a generator." ...|$|E

2500|$|Edward Kienholz died {{suddenly}} in Idaho on June 10, 1994, {{from a heart}} attack after hiking in the mountains near their home. He was a chronic smoker who had been struggling with diabetes, which progressively impaired use of his extremities. He was buried in an authentic Kienholz installation; Robert Hughes wrote, [...] "is corpulent, embalmed body was wedged into the front seat of a brown 1940 Packard coupe. There was a dollar and a deck of cards in his pocket, a bottle of 1931 Chianti beside him and the ashes of his dog Smash in the back. He was set for the afterlife. To <b>the</b> <b>whine</b> of bagpipes, the Packard, steered by his widow Nancy Reddin Kienholz, rolled like a funeral barge into the big hole." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the late}} twentieth century, The Scream was imitated, parodied, and (following its {{copyright}} expiration) outright copied, which led to it acquiring an iconic status in popular culture. It was used {{on the cover of}} some editions of Arthur Janov's book The Primal Scream. In 1983–1984, pop artist Andy Warhol made a series of silk prints copying works by Munch, including The Scream. His stated intention was to desacralize the painting by making it into a mass-reproducible object. Munch had already begun that process, however, by making a lithograph of the work for reproduction. Erró's ironic and irreverent treatment of Munch's masterpiece in his acrylic paintings The Second Scream (1967) and Ding Dong (1979) is considered a characteristic of post-modern art. The expression of Kevin McCallister (Macaulay Culkin) in the poster for the movie Home Alone was inspired by The Scream. Cartoonist Gary Larson included a [...] "tribute" [...] to The Scream (entitled <b>The</b> <b>Whine)</b> in his Wiener Dog Art painting and cartoon compilation, in which the central figure is replaced by a howling dachshund. The Scream has been used in advertising, in cartoons such as The Simpsons, films, and on television. The principal alien antagonists depicted in the 2011 BBC series of Doctor Who, named [...] "The Silence", have an appearance partially based on The Scream. The Ghostface mask worn by the primary antagonists of the Scream series of horror movies is based on the painting, and was created by Brigitte Sleiertin, a Fun World employee, as a Halloween costume, prior to being discovered by Marianne Maddalena and Wes Craven for the film.|$|E
2500|$|Academics {{and experts}} have {{suggested}} that China is in a league of its own {{compared to the other}} BRIC countries. As David Rothkopf wrote in Foreign Policy, [...] "Without China, the BRICs are just the BRI, a bland, soft cheese that is primarily known for <b>the</b> <b>whine</b> [...] that goes with it. China is the muscle of the group and the Chinese know it. They have effective veto power over any BRIC initiatives because without them, who cares really? They are the one with the big reserves. They are the biggest potential market. They are the U.S. partner in the G2 (imagine the coverage a G2 meeting gets vs. a G8 meeting) and the E2 (no climate deal without them) and so on." [...] Deutsche Bank Research said in a report that [...] "economically, financially and politically, China overshadows and will continue to overshadow the other BRICs". It added that China's economy is larger than that of the three other BRIC economies (Brazil, Russia and India) combined. Moreover, China's exports and its official foreign-exchange reserves are more than twice as large as those of the other BRICs combined. In that perspective, some pension investment experts have argued that [...] "China alone accounts for more than 70% of the combined GDP growth generated by the BRIC countries : if there is a BRIC miracle it's first and foremost a Chinese one". The [...] "growth gap" [...] between China and other large emerging economies such as Brazil, Russia and India can be attributed to a large extent to China's early focus on ambitious infrastructure projects: while China invested roughly 9% of its GDP on infrastructure in the 1990s and 2000s, most emerging economies invested only 2% to 5% of their GDP. This considerable spending gap allowed the Chinese economy to grow at near optimal conditions while many South American and South Asian economies suffered from various development bottlenecks (poor transportation, aging power grids, mediocre schools).|$|E

5000|$|In literature, the satchel {{is often}} {{associated}} with the classic image of the English schoolboy: [...] "And then <b>the</b> <b>whining</b> school-boy, with his satchel" [...] is a phrase from Shakespeare's monologue All the world's a stage.|$|R

50|$|More modern AC traction, such as on 1995 stock, uses an IGBT (which is {{essentially}} {{a combination of the}} MOSFET and BJT), which can operate at much higher switching frequencies than <b>the</b> GTO. <b>The</b> <b>whining</b> sound is far less noticeable because of the higher switching frequency of IGBT drives.|$|R

60|$|One logical thought {{alone was}} able to enter her flurried brain. The little dog that began <b>the</b> <b>whining</b> must have heard the other two sounds even better than herself.
