5|$|Numerous archaeological discoveries {{show that}} silk {{had become a}} luxury {{material}} appreciated in foreign countries well before {{the opening of the}} Silk Road by the Chinese. For example, silk has been found in the Valley of the Kings in a tomb of a mummy dating from 1070 BCE. First the Greeks, then the Romans began <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Seres (people of silk), a term to designate the inhabitants of the far-off kingdom, China. According to certain historians, the first Roman contact with silk was that of the legions of the governor of Syria, Crassus. At the Battle of Carrhae, near to the Euphrates, the legions were said to be so surprised by the brilliance of the banners of Parthia that they fled.|$|E

The report also criticized the treatment of captured Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit, and called for his release.|$|E

Jackson was originally unimpressed with Meccissininni, though Meccissininni, who often acquired white customs, asked Jackson for a similar suit to the one the president was wearing. While later wearing his suit that was made similar to Jackson's, Meccissininni also unknowingly imitated Jackson's hat, placing a piece of weed in it, which impressed Jackson since it symbolized mourning the death of his wife.|$|E

25|$|Since 1995 the {{situation}} has improved. After the year 2000, annual ticket sales rose to 20 million and since 1995, the number of theatres has steadily increased to approximately 500 nationwide. Currently, Turkish films attract audiences of millions of viewers and routinely top the blockbuster lists, often surpassing foreign films at the box office. However, it is difficult <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> existence of an industry, since most films are rather individual projects of directors who otherwise earn their living in television, advertising or theatre. The distribution of these films are mainly handled by multinational corporations such as Warner Bros. and United International Pictures.|$|E
25|$|Manchester City Council was not rate-capped. However its {{leadership}} was fully {{committed to the}} strategy of not setting a rate, arguing {{that the effect of}} the grant penalties system harmed it. A large rally protesting against rate-capping was held in Manchester on 6 March 1985, followed the next day by the council voting not to set a rate. When, the following week, the opposition Liberal Party group on the council called a special meeting to propose their own budget (which included a 4.4% rate rise), the council leader Graham Stringer insisted that the no rate strategy would continue. Liberal leader David Sandiford was ruled out of order by Stringer when he attempted <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> no rate strategy at a Policy Committee meeting on 17 March.|$|E
25|$|In {{an early}} {{chapter of the}} Agricola, Tacitus asserts that he wishes <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> years of Domitian, Nerva, and Trajan. In the Histories the scope has changed; Tacitus says that he will deal with the age of Nerva and Trajan at a later time. Instead, he will cover the period from the civil wars of the Year of Four Emperors and end with the despotism of the Flavians. Only the first four books and twenty-six {{chapters}} of the fifth book survive, covering the year 69 and {{the first part of}} 70. The work is believed to have continued up to the death of Domitian on September 18, 96. The fifth book containsas a prelude to the account of Titus's suppression of the Great Jewish Revolta short ethnographic survey of the ancient Jews, and it is an invaluable record of Roman attitudes towards them.|$|E

Though the five men that are {{disappeared}} hold only Mexican citizenships, three of the abductees hold U.S. citizenships and others were legal residents of the U.S. The family wants to the U.S. to investigate the case because they believe that the Gulf Cartel fears the involvement of U.S. authorities (according to the Cázares, a 9-year-old boy who was kidnapped from the first home was dropped off one of the international bridges in Matamoros after the kidnappers found out that he was a U.S. citizen and that his mother had contacted the FBI). The family also sent letters to U.S. President Barack Obama and to Pope Benedict XVI, and asked the latter <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> case with President Calderón during his visit to Mexico in March 2012. Barbier also sent letters to Catholic cardinals in the archdioceses of New York, Berlin, Paris, and Munich and Freising, asking them to pray for her family members that were missing. They received the same petition letters the family sent to President Calderón in their respective languages.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} days of the {{epidemic}} Haseltine recognized a two-fold problem in public perception. Many, both within and outside of the scientific/medical community, did not believe the epidemic would ever pose a serious threat to populations. Others believed that AIDS patients posed an immediate threat of infection and must avoided. To address this issue Haseltine help to create and guide several different groups. One of the most successful groups was the American Foundation of AIDS Research. Haseltine became the first chairman of the scientific advisory board of AMFAR. The mission was twofold, to make start up grants available for those wishing to begin work on HIV/AIDS and to de-stigmatize HIV/AIDS. Many of today's leaders of HIV/AIDS received their first support from AMFAR. The second goal was to provide a body of scientific and medical experts willing to speak out about the danger and magnitude of the epidemic and to provide a credible reference for those worried about causal transmission- in others words a group a qualified experts <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> real dangers of the disease and to counter unjustified fears. AmFAR continues in this role today.|$|E

Fikri presented a six-point solution at the conference in Jiddah that included obtaining the same basic rights as other groups {{when it came to}} right of language, religion, and culture. He also suggested that Thailand give up its discriminatory policies against the Patani people and allow Patani to at least be allowed the same self-governing rights as other regions in Thailand already have, citing that this does not go against the Thai constitution since it has been done in other parts of Thailand and that {{it is a matter of}} political will. He also criticised the Thai government’s escalation of violence by arming and creating Buddhist militia groups and questioned their intentions. He added Thai policies of not investigating corruption, murder, and human rights violations perpetrated by Bangkok-led administration and military personnel against the Malay Muslim population was an obstacle for achieving peace and healing the deep wounds of being treated as third-class citizens.|$|E
