5|$|The Battle of Kowloon was a {{skirmish}} between British and Chinese vessels off the Kowloon Peninsula, China, on 4 September 1839. Located {{in present-day}} Hong Kong, Kowloon was then {{part of the}} Guangdong province. The skirmish was the first armed conflict of the First Opium War and occurred when British boats opened fire on Chinese war junks enforcing a food sales embargo on the British community. <b>The</b> <b>embargo</b> was ordered after a local Chinese man died in a drunken brawl with British sailors. The Chinese authorities did not consider the punishment meted out by British officials to be sufficient and as a result, suspended food supplies {{in an attempt to}} force the handover of the culprit. In response, the British summoned nearby warships to force the Chinese to lift <b>the</b> <b>embargo.</b>|$|E

5|$|Because Israel's {{victory was}} {{largely due to}} U.S. support, the Arab OPEC nations retaliated by refusing to sell crude oil to the U.S., {{resulting}} in the 1973 oil crisis. <b>The</b> <b>embargo</b> caused gasoline shortages and rationing in the United States in late 1973, and was eventually ended by the oil-producing nations as peace in the Middle East took hold.|$|E
5|$|Following President Obama's {{announcement}} that the United States would move towards normalizing relations with Cuba, Pritzker traveled to Cuba. Although Obama's {{change in policy}} did not end the U.S. trade embargo, since ending <b>the</b> <b>embargo</b> required an act of Congress, Pritzker met with Cuban trade ministers and other officials to discuss the changing {{relationship between the two}} countries and {{to lay the groundwork for}} more economic involvement.|$|E
5|$|Prior to , {{a flourishing}} trade route for Percherons existed between Nogent-le-Rotrou, Le Havre and the United States. However, {{after the war}} began, an embargo was placed on French Percherons, disallowing them from exportation. Other than an {{exception}} in April 1916 to allow 59 horses to be shipped from France to the US, this embargo remained in place {{until the end of}} the war. The war took its toll on the Percheron breed as horses, fodder, and handlers were requisitioned for the fighting, and even after <b>the</b> <b>embargo</b> was lifted France did not have the quality or quantity of stock to fulfill the needs of American breeders. <b>The</b> <b>embargo</b> created a breeding boom in the US, replacing the previous practice of importing the majority of Percherons from France, and late in the war horses were shipped the other way– from the US to Europe– to supply those needed in the war. The lack of feathering on the Percheron's lower legs made them easier to care for in the mud that they often worked in during wartime. Their quick trot on paved roads made them more versatile than motorized vehicles, and they were useful for work with guns and in forward units due to their calm temperaments.|$|E

5|$|Word of the {{incident}} spread quickly upon Chesapeakes return to Norfolk, where the British squadron that included Leopard was provisioning. Mobs of angry citizens destroyed twohundred water casks destined for the squadron and nearly killed a British lieutenant before local authorities intervened. President Jefferson recalled all USwarships from the Mediterranean and issued a proclamation: all British warships were banned from entering USports and those already in port were to depart. The incident eventually led to <b>the</b> <b>Embargo</b> Act of 1807.|$|E
5|$|An embargo is not {{the same}} as Food Power, however, food power can be used in an embargo. In fact, embargoes that do not involve food in their list of {{restricted}} items often fail. For example, on August 20, 1914 the Allied Powers began an embargo on important items that were normally shipped to Germany. However, <b>the</b> <b>embargo</b> was not complete nor effective until food was added to the list of restricted materials. Food has the real power. After food was introduced the blockade began to strangle Germany's economy because they were dependent on imports for food. Because the Allied Powers used the power of food in their embargo, Germany was forced to resort to desperate measures and eventually failed despite them.|$|E
5|$|Bloomsbury {{invested}} £10million in {{an attempt}} to keep the book's contents secure until 21 July, the release date. Arthur Levine, U.S. editor of the Harry Potter series, denied distributing any copies of Deathly Hallows in advance for press review, but two U.S. papers published early reviews anyway. There was speculation that some shops would break <b>the</b> <b>embargo</b> and distribute copies of the book early, as the penalty imposed for previous instalments—that the distributor would not be supplied with any further copies of the series—would no longer be a deterrent.|$|E

50|$|Embargoed is a UK-based {{human rights}} {{organisation}} campaigning {{to bring an}} immediate and unconditional end to all <b>embargoes</b> against <b>the</b> people of Northern Cyprus. Embargoed does not proscribe any political remedy, but considers <b>the</b> <b>embargoes</b> on <b>the</b> people of Northern Cyprus to be unjust and immoral. It does not consider itself a nationalist organisation, and its manifesto commits it to being multi-cultural, and avoiding politics.

5|$|For most of Scott's {{tenure as}} governor, {{tensions}} between the U.S. and Great Britain escalated. Sentiment {{in favor of a}} U.S. declaration of war against the British was particularly strong in Kentucky. Most Kentuckians resented the replacement of <b>the</b> <b>Embargo</b> Act of 1807 with the weaker Non-Intercourse Act of 1809 and Macon's Bill Number 2. Kentucky Senator Henry Clay became the acknowledged leader of the war hawks in Congress. During an address to the General Assembly on December 4, 1810, Scott expressed little hope of peacefully resolving U.S. grievances against Great Britain. He reminded the General Assembly, however, that France had also violated the United States' maritime rights and urged equal treatment of the two countries for their offenses.|$|E
5|$|Greene {{was born}} in Apponaug, Rhode Island, one of nine {{children}} of Caleb and Sarah Robinson (Greene) Greene. His family had roots in the founding of Rhode Island and in the American Revolutionary War, including General Nathanael Greene, George's second cousin. Caleb was a financially shrewd ship owner and merchant, but <b>the</b> <b>Embargo</b> Act of 1807, which prohibited U.S. vessels from carrying goods to other countries, and the War of 1812 left his family in financial difficulties. Young George attended Wrentham Academy and then a Latin grammar school in Providence and hoped to attend Brown University there, but his impoverished father could not afford it, so he moved to New York City and found work in a dry goods store on Pearl Street.|$|E
5|$|Lincoln ran for {{election}} as governor {{in his own}} right in 1809, but he was perceived by moderate Federalists as overly partisan and lacked the charisma of Sullivan. His support for Jefferson's economic policy, particularly that of embargoing trade with Great Britain and France (who were then embroiled in the Napoleonic Wars) was costly. Federalists, who had regained control of the Massachusetts legislature in 1808, attacked his statements in support of Jefferson, and he lost the election to Christopher Gore, amid a complete Federalist takeover of the Massachusetts government (the outgoing Jefferson administration's repeal of <b>the</b> <b>embargo</b> before the election notwithstanding).|$|E
50|$|In 1939, <b>the</b> {{non-binding}} <b>embargo</b> {{was extended}} to materials essential to airplane manufacture and to plans, plants, and technical information {{for the production of}} high-quality aviation gasoline. These measures resulted in the suspension of the export to Japan of aircraft, aeronautical equipment, and other materials within the scope of <b>the</b> moral <b>embargoes.</b> As Japanese purchases of items other than aircraft and aeronautical equipment were minuscule, <b>the</b> moral <b>embargo</b> ultimately stopped <b>the</b> exportation of arms to Japan.|$|R

It encouraged the improved monitoring of arms embargoes through regional exchanges of information, such as through the OAU, Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), Southern African Development Community (SADC) and the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD). All states were to report on violations of <b>the</b> arms <b>embargoes.</b>|$|R
2500|$|In {{an article}} {{published}} in the British academic journal Democratization in 1998, he focused in particular on how <b>the</b> US <b>embargo</b> against Cuba helps create [...] "empathy" [...] by third parties towards Cuba, which is then domestically perceived as support towards Cuba's regime. [...] He argued, hence, that the US Government - in addition to <b>the</b> <b>embargo's</b> direct influence on supporting Cuba's regime - indirectly inhibits potentially constructive pressures towards change, insofar as third countries, foreign non-governmental organizations and prominent individuals lend support to Cuba's resistance to <b>the</b> US <b>embargo,</b> and this offsets external pressures to democratize, thereby allowing the Cuban regime to convert such [...] "empathy" [...] into a source of legitimacy at home.|$|R
5|$|On October 17, 1973, the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries {{announced}} an oil embargo against the United States {{in retaliation for}} its support of Israel during the Yom Kippur War. Because the United States imported approximately 35 percent of its oil from foreign sources, <b>the</b> <b>embargo</b> had a major effect. The price of gasoline shot upward, gasoline shortages were common, and rationing was considered. Most Americans began demanding {{a solution to the}} problem, and President Richard Nixon began lobbying for the Trans-Alaska Pipeline as at least a part of the answer.|$|E
5|$|The {{concert was}} planned {{for several months}} prior to its public {{announcement}} while the band was on their 2016 tour of South America, titled América Latina Olé Tour 2016.

5|$|The first {{railroad}} in Indiana {{was built}} in Shelbyville in the late 1830s. The first major line was completed in 1847, connecting Madison with Indianapolis. By the 1850s, the railroad began to become popular in Indiana. The railroad brought major changes to Indiana and enhanced the state's economic growth. Although Indiana's natural waterways connected it to the South via cities such as St. Louis and New Orleans, the new rail lines ran East-West, and connected Indiana with the economies of the northern states. As late as mid-1859, no rail line yet bridged the Ohio or Mississippi rivers. Because of an increased demand on the state's resources and <b>the</b> <b>embargo</b> against the Confederacy, the rail system was mostly completed {{by the end of}} the American Civil War.|$|E

5|$|Utica's {{location}} on the Erie and Chenango canals encouraged industrial development, allowing the transport of anthracite from northeastern Pennsylvania for local manufacturing and distribution. Utica's economy centered around the manufacture of furniture, heavy machinery, textiles and lumber. The combined effects of <b>the</b> <b>Embargo</b> Act of 1807 and local investment enabled further expansion of the textile industry. Like other upstate New York cities, mills in Utica processed cotton from the Deep South, a slave society. Much of the New York economy was closely involved with slavery; in the antebellum period, half of New York's exports were related to cotton.|$|E
5|$|Boston's harbor {{activity}} was significantly curtailed by <b>the</b> <b>Embargo</b> Act of 1807 (adopted during the Napoleonic Wars) and the War of 1812. Foreign trade returned after these hostilities, but Boston's merchants had found alternatives for their capital {{investments in the}} interim. Manufacturing became {{an important component of}} the city's economy, and the city's industrial manufacturing overtook international trade in economic importance by the mid-19th century. Boston remained one of the nation's largest manufacturing centers until the early 20th century, and was notable for its garment production and leather-goods industries. A network of small rivers bordering the city and connecting it to the surrounding region facilitated shipment of goods and led to a proliferation of mills and factories. Later, a dense network of railroads furthered the region's industry and commerce.|$|E
5|$|Nixon {{supported}} {{the pipeline project}} even before the oil crisis. On September 10, 1973, he released a message stating that the pipeline was his priority {{for the remainder of}} the Congressional session that year. On November 8, after <b>the</b> <b>embargo</b> had been in place for three weeks, he reaffirmed that statement. Members of Congress, under pressure from their constituents, created the Trans-Alaska Pipeline Authorization Act, which removed all legal barriers from construction of the pipeline, provided financial incentives, and granted a right-of-way for its construction. The act was drafted, rushed through committee, and approved by the House on November 12, 1973, by a vote of 361–14–60. The next day, the Senate passed it, 80–5–15. Nixon signed it into law on November 16, and a federal right-of-way for the pipeline and transportation highway was granted on January 3, 1974. The deal was signed by the oil companies on January 23, allowing work to start.|$|E
