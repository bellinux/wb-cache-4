5|$|The carnival's backstory {{begins at}} the end of the nineteenth century when Lucius Belyakov, a Russian aristocrat from Minsk and officer in the Tsar's army, became aware of his Avataric powers. The birth of his son Alexei evoked dark visions in him. After Belyakov's attempt to kill two-year-old Alexei, his wife fled with <b>their</b> <b>two</b> <b>children</b> to America, but news spread they perished in a train {{accident}} soon thereafter. Resuming his duties in Lemberg in 1914, Belyakov was again afflicted by dark visions. Henry Scudder, an American who had escaped prosecution for criminal activities in his home country by joining foreign armies, had had psychokinetic powers since childhood. At the time of Belyakov's visions, Scudder was stationed in Lemberg as an observer for the Austro-Hungarian Army. Belyakov became obsessed with killing his spiritual enemy (Scudder) and deserted his post, but an escaped circus bear feeding on the dead nearby surprised him in an attack. Belyakov was so gravely injured he would lose an arm and both legs.|$|E

Shortly thereafter, Shepherd witnesses a road accident and stops to help the victims. He rescues a young girl named Winnie (Savannah Paige Rae), and helps her mother who has a dislocated leg. With assistance from Winnie, he rescues another couple from their car right before it explodes, and offers them emergency medical care.|$|E
