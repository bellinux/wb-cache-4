25|$|It {{was very}} slow and {{therefore}} a most impressive assault with steel. At times the tanks almost 'stood on their heads', twisting to avoid mounds of rock and to get {{at right angles to}} the huge cracks and shell holes, but always getting nearer and nearer. Like beetles trying to climb an inverted ice-cream cone, they slipped a little, hung suspended and then went onwards towards the top. The behaviour of these tanks upset the Germans. Such tactics were untanklike, and no answer was contained in their military textbooks. <b>Too</b> <b>late</b> <b>now</b> to shift the anti-tank guns from their positions, too late to make alternative arrangements to deal with the new menace. There was only one answer – retreat, and that's what the Germans did – leaving the British tanks and infantry in possession of the first slope up the heights of Longstop. So ended 23 April.|$|E
500|$|When the Associated Press picked Petoskey {{as only a}} second-team All-American in 1933, ten-year-old Mary Lee Grossman from Saginaw, Michigan protested in {{a letter}} to AP sports editor, Alan Gould, that he had [...] "chosen wrong" [...] in leaving Petoskey and Whitey Wistert off the first-team. [...] To avoid any {{appearance}} of bias, the Saginaw native noted: [...] "You may think I am a friend of these boys but I do not know either of them. [...] I hope you change your mind." [...] Gould responded to Miss Grossman in his column: [...] "You may be right, Mary Lee, but it's <b>too</b> <b>late</b> <b>now</b> to change our mind." ...|$|E
500|$|When {{their efforts}} to get the Flood {{manuscript}} published failed, the Earps decided to appeal to Burns, whose own book was near publication. But he was not interested. His book {{was about to be}} published, free of the constraints imposed by a collaboration with Earp. Burns wrote them, [...] "I should not now care to undertake another book which, in part at least, would be upon much the same lines... I should have been delighted six months ago to accept your offer but it is <b>too</b> <b>late</b> <b>now.</b> My book has championed Mr. Earp's cause throughout and I believe will vindicate his reputation in Tombstone in a way that he will like." [...] When Burns turned them down, Josephine actively worked to stop the publication of his book, fearful that {{their efforts to}} publish Wyatt's biography would be thwarted as a result.|$|E

500|$|At 12:30 pm, Bellerophon {{cut through}} the enemy line, {{slipping}} under {{the stern of the}} Spanish 74-gun Monarca and firing two broadsides into her. Moving past the Spanish ship, Bellerophon collided with the French 74-gun Aigle, hitting Aigles port quarter with her starboard bow, and entangling the two ships' yards. Locked together, they exchanged broadsides at close range, with soldiers aboard Aigle sweeping Bellerophons decks with musket fire and grenades. Cumby noticed that the officers were being targeted, and that Cooke's distinctive epaulettes marked him out. Cumby urged him to take them off, only for Cooke to reply [...] "It is <b>too</b> <b>late</b> <b>now</b> to take them off. I see my situation but I will die like a man." [...] Bellerophon was now sustaining fire from Aigle and three other ships, the Spanish San Juan Nepomuceno and Bahama, and the French Swiftsure. Bellerophons main and mizzenmasts were shot away at 1 pm, and at 1:11 pm, Captain Cooke was hit and killed. An eyewitness recorded that He had discharged his pistols very frequently at the enemy, who as often attempted to board, and he had killed a French officer on his own quarterdeck. He was in the act of reloading his pistols... when he received two musket-balls in the breast. He immediately fell, and upon the quartermaster going up and asking him if he should take him down below, his answer was [...] "No, let me lie quietly one minute. Tell Lieutenant Cumby never to strike." ...|$|E
2500|$|By mid-December, it {{was obvious}} that Buford was sick, {{possibly}} from contracting typhoid, and he took respite at the Washington home of his good friend, General George Stoneman. On December 16, Stoneman initiated the proposal that Buford be promoted to major general, and President Abraham Lincoln assented, writing as follows: [...] "I am informed that General Buford will not survive the day. It suggests itself to me that he will be made Major General for distinguished and meritorious service at the Battle of Gettysburg." [...] Informed of the promotion, Buford inquired doubtfully, [...] "Does he mean it?" [...] When assured the promotion was genuine, he replied simply, [...] "It is <b>too</b> <b>late,</b> <b>now</b> I wish I could live." ...|$|E
