As of 2014, it was 8 % below its 2010 peak of US$ 13. 1 billion. <b>Total</b> <b>aid</b> {{to education}} fell by almost US$ 600 million, or 4 %, between 2013 and 2014, even though <b>total</b> <b>aid</b> levels increased by US$ 10. 1 billion over the same period. This shows that most donors are giving education a lower priority within their aid budgets. Education’s share of <b>total</b> <b>aid</b> (excluding debt relief) fell from 10. 2 % in 2010 to 9. 5 % in 2013 and 8. 2 % in 2014. While education aid from bilateral donors followed the overall trend, aid from multilateral donors rose. <b>Total</b> <b>aid</b> to education across bilateral donors fell by 9 % or US$ 9 45 million between 2013 and 2014. Three donors account for most of this drop: Japan, whose aid fell by US$ 550 million, or 48 %, the United Arab Emirates (down US$ 529 million, or 74 %) and the United Kingdom (down US$ 208 million, or 13 %).

This paper presents an empirical analysis {{of the relationship between}} foreign aid and economic growth in the case of Fiji.

Components of <b>total</b> <b>aid,</b> such as grant aid, loan aid, technical cooperation, bilateral and multilateral aid flows are also utilized to estimate a disaggregated short-run and long-run relationship between foreign aid and economic growth. The results show that <b>total</b> <b>aid</b> flows and its various forms, i. <b>e.</b> bilateral <b>aid,</b> grant aid and technical cooperation grant aid, has a significant impact on economic growth in Fiji.

40|$|Research {{on factors}} related to {{persistence}} suggest that re-enrollment decisions are based upon {{an evaluation of the}} returns on investment in education. If students perceive that the costs of a college education outweigh the benefits, they will discontinue their involvement by choosing not to re-enroll. As a result, students’ choices to maintain their enrollment in postsecondary education can be an effective indicator of affordability. This study examined the degree to which financially independent undergraduate students’ persistence decisions are related to financial factors, including unmet need, <b>total</b> financial <b>aid</b> received, and type of financial aid received. The data examined in this study consisted of 3, 662 financially independent undergraduate students who were enrolled in a four-year public institution within the state of Kentucky. The analysis was based upon data collected from two academic years: fall 2012, spring 2013, and fall 2013. The dependent variable was persistence, which was defined as re-enrollment at the same institution, graduation, or transfer to another four-year institution. The selection of independent variables was influenced by St. John’s (1992) workable model of persistence and included the following: background characteristics, college experiences, unmet need, <b>total</b> <b>aid</b> received, and type of aid received. Sequential logistic regression analyses were performed to determine {{the degree to which the}} independent variables were related to persistence. Changes in probability measures (Delta p statistics) were calculated for each variable in order to determine the relationship of a one-unit change in the independent variable to a change in the dependent variable. The analyses revealed that, as compared to background characteristics, unmet need, college experience, <b>total</b> <b>aid</b> received, and type of aid received were a significant predictor of persistence for financially independent undergraduate students, with a medium to large effect size. Unmet need, <b>total</b> <b>aid</b> received, and certain types of aid received also were significant predictors of persistence, with each possessing a small effect size. As compared to background characteristics and college experience, unmet need was a significant predictor of persistence for financially independent undergraduate students. <b>Total</b> <b>aid</b> received also was a significant predictor of persistence when compared to background characteristics, college experience, and financial factors. For this group of financially independent students, the analyses also indicated that aid awarded as workstudy, grants, or need-based loans were more effective in predicting between-year persistence than aid awarded as tuition waivers, scholarships, and non-need based loans. These predictors of between-year persistence for financially independent undergraduate students hold promise for decision makers within the Commonwealth of Kentucky (and beyond) and should be explored further...|$|R

40|$|This paper reviews {{both the}} {{literature}} on aid volatility and also adds to that literature. In general, {{the focus of this}} literature has been on the volatility of overall aid, while we focus more on the volatility of the individual <b>aid</b> sectors, <b>e.</b> g., education <b>aid.</b> In doing this, detailed use is made of the Creditor Reporting System (CRS) database on aid commitments and disbursements, particularly the latter. Key aid sectors in explaining <b>total</b> <b>aid</b> volatility relate to debt, programme assistance, infrastructure and government. This reflects both these sectors' volatility and their size. The most volatile aid sectors per se are debt, industry, humanitarian, NGO and programme assistance. The least volatile are education, health, other social infrastructure and multi-sector aid. We also find evidence that the volatility of different aid sectors saw a peak around 2006, which was about when debt aid volatility was at its highest. In an asymmetric VAR, we find that both positive and negative aid volatility tend to be corrected for in the following period, rather than there simply being a return to trend. There are also cross-sector effects by which volatility in one sector has subsequent impacts on other sectors. These tend to revolve around government aid and programme assistance. Finally we examine the impact of aid and aid volatility on very specific targets, finding both to be significant. There are several lessons we draw from this: first, in analysing aid's impact, for example, on social targets such as school completion rates, social sector aid rather than overall aid is the relevant variable although not necessarily just education aid. Second, we argue that a complete understanding of aid's impact can only be obtained by an analysis such as this, across a range of targets and then analysing the impact of these targets on the macroeconomy itself. This leads to the further conclusion {{that it is not the}} volatility of <b>total</b> <b>aid</b> which matters so much as the sum of sector and subsector volatilities...|$|R
