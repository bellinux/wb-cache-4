40|$|Teaching and Learning Department Capstone ProjectThe {{purpose of}} this paper is to look at Kindergarten {{students}} and understand how they move from writing <b>for</b> <b>themselves</b> to writing <b>for</b> an audience. Kindergarten students are still young children and have difficulty taking on the perspectives of others. For this reason, it is hard for them to write so that someone other than themselves can read their writing. However, during the Kindergarten year students experience a shift in perspectives that makes writing for an audience possible. Students move from writing <b>for</b> <b>themselves</b> to writing <b>for</b> an audience. This paper examines the journey that Kindergarteners go through as they move from writing <b>for</b> <b>themselves</b> to writing <b>for</b> an audience.

The most important decree, the October Manifesto, was announced on October 30 (October 17 O.S.), 1905. It guaranteed many political rights, {{including the right to}} form political parties and organize convocations. This decree formed the legal basis for the assembly in Vilnius. The October Manifesto also announced the intent to hold elections to the Russian Parliament (Duma), and the Lithuanian organizers used this as an official pretext for the Seimas: they claimed that the Lithuanians needed to prepare <b>themselves</b> <b>for</b> this election.|$|E

5|$|Christie's {{sacrifice}} {{in the film}} is a heavily criticized plot element, with critics from online publications such as Cracked.com and Bloody Disgusting calling it avoidable and unnecessary. In Keyframes: Popular Cinema and Cultural Studies, Matthew Tinkcom and Amy Villarejo write that Christie reinforces an Alien-franchise trope (shared by Parker in Alien and Dillon in Alien 3) where black characters save and sacrifice <b>themselves</b> <b>for</b> Caucasian characters. The theme of hybridization is exemplified by Christie and Vriess, according to Rizzo in Deleuze and Film: A Feminist Introduction; while the two characters are harnessed together, they alternate movement, support and combat.|$|E
