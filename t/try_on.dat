30|$|Thirdly, {{consumers}} are simply enjoying <b>trying</b> them <b>on</b> {{as a form}} of entertainment. We can interpret the fact that consumers have started seeing <b>trying</b> <b>on</b> clothes as a pleasant experience as a new discovery about the function of <b>trying</b> <b>on,</b> which consumers used to consider a “cumbersome and annoying event” they had to go through to figure out an item’s physical, functional, and aesthetic aspects. To understand this new phenomenon better, the researcher performed a paradigm analysis. The researcher select “enjoying <b>trying</b> <b>on</b> clothes” as a main phenomenon of this study, and aimed to identify the conditions that affect the main phenomenon using the axis coding method. The results led to the assumption that the pleasure of <b>trying</b> <b>on</b> clothes can be experienced more readily when the reason for shopping is simply leisure. The researcher determined that the process of enjoying <b>trying</b> <b>on</b> items w{{as a form of}} entertainment, enabled by the spacious store and wide variety of products, as well as the liberal, independent atmosphere in the fitting room.|$|R

25|$|Because {{the night}} that the woman ritually {{traditionally}} immerses is about 12 days after menstruation began, it often coincides with a woman's ovulation, and thus improves the chances of successful conception if sexual relations occur on that night. However, for certain women, this period extends far past the date of ovulation, and {{in combination with the}} ban on sexual relations during the niddah state, effectively results in the woman being unable to conceive. In the case of this effective infertility, rabbis <b>try</b> <b>on</b> a case-by-case basis to relax halakhic strictures in order to facilitate conception. There have been some calls within Orthodox Judaism for the custom to be modified so that the time between the end of menstruation and the end of niddah isn't as long for these women.|$|E
