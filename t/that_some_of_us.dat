Cher embodies an unapologetic freedom and fearlessness <b>that</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> can only aspire to." [...] Rolling Stone Jancee Dunn wrote, [...] "Cher is the coolest woman who ever stood in shoes. Why? Because her motto is, 'I don't give a shit what you think, I'm going to wear this multicolored wig.' There are folks all over America who would, in their heart of hearts, love to date people half their age, get multiple tattoos and wear feathered headdresses. Cher does it for us." [...] Alexander Fury of The Independent wrote that Cher [...] "represents a seemingly immortal, omnipotent, uni-monikered level of fame." [...] Bego stated: [...] "No one in the history of show business has had a career of the magnitude and scope of Cher's. She has been a teenage pop star, a television hostess, a fashion magazine model, a rock star, a pop singer, a Broadway actress, an Academy Award-winning movie star, a disco sensation, and the subject of a mountain of press coverage." ...|$|E
2500|$|Many of Scissor Sisters' songs {{deal with}} {{themes in the}} lesbian, gay, {{bisexual}} and transgender community, relating {{to the fact that}} three of the band members, including the two founders, are gay. [...] "Filthy/Gorgeous" [...] is about transsexual prostitutes while [...] "Take Your Mama" [...] deals with coming out of the closet to family members. Despite this, Shears stated, [...] "I don't believe sexuality really matters when it comes to music." [...] In an interview featured on the We Are Scissor Sisters...

2500|$|Biblical {{references}} {{appear in}} several forms. Chapter VI cites the Book of Job, ii. 13); {{there is an}} allusion to the elder brother in the Parable of the Prodigal Son, and Margaret paraphrases the definition of charity ("that spirit which suffereth long and is kind and seeketh not her own") (Gaskell, 1855, chapter 15) from the First Epistle to the Corinthians. However, Gaskell cautions against misuse; Bessy Higgins reads the Apocalypse to cope with her condition and interprets the parable of Dives and Lazarus so simplistically that Margaret counters vigorously: [...] "It won't be division enough, in that awful day, <b>that</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> have been beggars here, {{and some of us}} have been rich—we shall not be judged by that poor accident, but by our faithful following of Christ" [...] (Gaskell, 1855, chapter 19). Margaret and John follow a path of conversion which leads to reconciliation, acknowledging their [...] "unworthiness" [...] (Pollard, 1967). Margaret, who has the longest way to go, is crushed by guilt from her lie and by shame from being debased in Thornton's eyes (Gaskell, 1855, chapter 39). Francis de Sales encourages her to seek [...] "the way of humility" [...] (Gaskell, 1855, chapter 41), despite Mr. Bell's attempts to minimise and rationalise her lie as told in a panic. Thornton, on the brink of ruin like Job, tries not to be outraged while his mother rebels against the injustice of his situation ("Not for you, John! God has seen fit to be very hard on you, very") and gives fervent thanks for the [...] "great blessing" [...] his existence gives her (Gaskell, 1855, chapter 50).|$|E

25|$|The U.S. {{system is}} often {{compared}} with that of its northern neighbor, Canada (see Canadian and American health care systems compared). Canada's system is largely publicly funded. In 2006, Americans spent an estimated US$6,714 per capita on health care, while Canadians spent US$3,678. This amounted to 15% percent <b>of</b> <b>U.S.</b> GDP in that year, while Canada spent 10%.

50|$|The {{controversy}} surrounding the U.S. Attorneys dismissals was often linked to elections or voter-fraud issues.

Such allegations were made by <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the dismissed <b>U.S.</b> Attorneys themselves to suggest reasons {{they may have been}} dismissed.The background to the allegations is the recent tendency for elections in parts of the United States to be very close; an election outcome can be affected by an announced investigation of a politician. It is explicit policy of the Department of Justice to avoid bringing voter-related cases during an election for this reason. In September 2008, the Inspector General for the Department <b>of</b> Justice concluded <b>that</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the dismissals were motivated by the refusal <b>of</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the <b>U.S.</b> Attorneys to prosecute voter fraud cases during the 2006 election cycle.|$|R
