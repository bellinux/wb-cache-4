5|$|Humanity {{lives in}} the deepest reaches of {{explored}} space in a vast region known as <b>The</b> <b>Frontier.</b> It contains many well-known and inhabited star systems, but many more worlds remain uncharted. Most people will never travel this far away from normal civilization, but for pioneers, explorers, mercenaries, outlaws, and soldiers - <b>the</b> <b>Frontier</b> offers both adventure and opportunity.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Frontier</b> Militia {{represents}} the military arm of <b>the</b> <b>Frontier</b> systems' territorial defense pact. The Militia is a loosely governed mishmash of homesteaders, bandits, mercenaries, and pirates, all rising up as 'citizen soldiers' {{when the need}} arises. Each brigade within the Militia is responsible for fighting in an assigned section of Frontier territory. Although some brigades {{are little more than}} vast pirate organizations, the Militia has enough resources to be a real obstacle to the IMC's ambitions on <b>the</b> <b>Frontier.</b> The Militia often claims that direct action against the IMC {{is in the best interest}} of the homesteaders whom they allegedly represent, but not everyone on <b>the</b> <b>Frontier</b> sees it that way.|$|E

5|$|A son of William and Mary (Johns) Trigg, he mainly {{worked as}} a public servant and militia officer {{during the early years}} of <b>the</b> <b>frontier</b> {{counties}} of southwest Virginia, which then Kentucky. He was one reportedly of the wealthiest men on <b>the</b> <b>frontier.</b> Trigg was a delegate to the first Virginia revolutionary conventions, and was a member of the Fincastle Committee of Safety that drafted the Fincastle Resolutions, a precursor to the Declaration of Independence passed by the Second Continental Congress on July 4, 1776. He was also elected to the Virginia House of Delegates.|$|E
5|$|Altan Khan {{eventually}} {{made peace with}} China when it opened border cities for trade in 1571, alleviating the Mongol need to raid. This, coupled with Qi and Tan's efforts to secure <b>the</b> <b>frontier,</b> brought a period of relative peace along the border. However, minor raids still happened {{from time to time}} when the profits of plunder outweighed those of trade, prompting the Ming to close all gaps along <b>the</b> <b>frontier</b> around Beijing. Areas of difficult terrain once considered impassable were also walled off, leading to the well-known vistas of a stone-faced Great Wall snaking over dramatic landscapes that tourists still see today.|$|E

5|$|Diana Ross & the Supremes {{gave their}} final {{performance}} on January 14, 1970 at <b>the</b> <b>Frontier</b> Hotel in Las Vegas. At the final performance, the replacement for Diana Ross, Jean Terrell, was introduced. According to Mary Wilson, after this performance, Berry Gordy wanted to replace Terrell with Syreeta Wright. Wilson refused, leading to Gordy stating {{that he was}} washing his hands of the group thereafter. This claim is also made by Mark Ribowsky. After <b>the</b> <b>Frontier</b> Hotel performance, Ross officially began {{her career as a}} solo performer. Mary Wilson and Cindy Birdsong continued working with Jean Terrell on the first post-Ross Supremes album, Right On.|$|E
5|$|Exports rose 4% to 5% {{annually}} from 1810 to 1850 and 7% to 8% from 1850 to 1870. This growth was achieved through {{the extension of}} <b>the</b> <b>frontier</b> and greater efficiency in livestock production.|$|E

5|$|In 121 BC, Han forces {{expelled}} the Xiongnu from a vast territory {{spanning the}} Hexi Corridor to Lop Nur. They repelled a joint Xiongnu-Qiang invasion of this northwestern territory in 111 BC. In that year, the Han court established four new frontier commanderies in this region: Jiuquan, Zhangyi, Dunhuang, and Wuwei. The {{majority of people}} on <b>the</b> <b>frontier</b> were soldiers. On occasion, the court forcibly moved peasant farmers to new frontier settlements, along with government-owned slaves and convicts who performed hard labor. The court also encouraged commoners, such as farmers, merchants, landowners, and hired laborers, to voluntarily migrate to <b>the</b> <b>frontier.</b>|$|E
5|$|Italy {{declared}} war on the United Kingdom on 10 June 1940. Bordering on the Italian colony of Libya was the Kingdom of Egypt. Although a neutral country, Egypt was occupied by the British {{under the terms of}} the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936, which allowed British military forces to occupy Egypt if the Suez Canal was threatened. A series of cross-border raids and skirmishes began on <b>the</b> <b>frontier</b> between Libya and Egypt. On 13 September 1940, an Italian force advanced across <b>the</b> <b>frontier</b> into Egypt, reaching Sidi Barrani on 16 September, where the advance was halted until logistical difficulties could be overcome.|$|E
5|$|Major interplanetary {{corporations}} {{known as}} Hammond Robotics—a major manufacturing, aerospace and defense contractor—used resources of <b>the</b> <b>Frontier</b> to make builds of mecha-combatants such as Titans and Spectres. Titans are descendants of present-day fledgling military exoskeletons. In {{addition to the}} obvious combat applications, unarmed forms of Titans are used in heavy industries like cargo transport and deep space ship salvage. They are also used in special applications such as deep space search and rescue, and are very effective in inhospitable environments. The use of Titans is widespread throughout <b>the</b> <b>Frontier</b> in both combat and civilian life. As with Titans, <b>the</b> <b>Frontier</b> contains Pilots of many different styles and experiences. Titan Pilots are rated by 'certifications', most of which apply to civilian applications, such as construction, shipping, and heavy salvage industries. The most prestigious {{of these is the}} Full Combat Certification - a widely published series of tests that grade a Titan Pilot's abilities. Because of the extreme physical and mental challenges of mastering both Titan combat & dismounted parkour movement, a fully combat certified Titan pilot is a rare find, and the combat skills of active Pilots in the field varies widely throughout <b>the</b> <b>Frontier.</b>|$|E

5|$|The dispute {{initially}} {{took the}} form of symbolic protests and a campaign by Spanish diplomats and the state-controlled media. From 1954, Spain imposed increasingly stringent restrictions on trade and the movements of vehicles and people across the border with Gibraltar. Further restrictions were imposed in 1964, and in 1966 <b>the</b> <b>frontier</b> was closed to vehicles. In 1969, after the passing of the Gibraltar Constitution Order, to which Spain strongly objected, <b>the</b> <b>frontier</b> was closed completely and Gibraltar's telecommunications links through Spain were cut.|$|E

5|$|Al-Mu'tadid {{took care}} to prepare Ali, his oldest son and heir-apparent, for the {{succession}} by appointing him as a provincial governor: first in Rayy, Qazvin, Qum and Hamadan, when these provinces were seized from the semi-autonomous Dulafid dynasty in ca. 894/5, and in 899 over the Jazira and <b>the</b> <b>frontier</b> areas, when al-Mu'tamid deposed the last local autonomous governor, Muhammad ibn Ahmad al-Shaybani. The future al-Muktafi took up residence at Raqqa.|$|E
5|$|Al-Muktafi {{also kept}} up the {{perennial}} conflict with the Byzantine Empire, with varying success. In May 902, al-Qasim ibn Sima al-Farghani was appointed in command of <b>the</b> <b>frontier</b> districts of the Jazira. In 902 or 903, a naval raid reached the island of Lemnos, dangerously close to the Byzantine capital, Constantinople; the island was plundered and its inhabitants carried off into slavery. Nevertheless, in May 903, the newly appointed governor of Tarsus, Abu'l-Asha'ir Ahmad ibn Nasr, was dispatched to <b>the</b> <b>frontier</b> districts with gifts for the Byzantine ruler, Leo VI the Wise (r. 886–912), and in return, Byzantine envoys arrived in Baghdad for negotiations on a prisoner exchange. The exchange eventually took place in September–October 905, at the river Lamus in Cilicia, but was interrupted because the Byzantines reneged on the agreed terms. After further negotiations, the exchange was completed in August 908.|$|E
