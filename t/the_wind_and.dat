5|$|As is true {{for many}} species of deer, {{especially}} those in mountainous regions, elk migrate into areas of higher altitude in the spring, following the retreating snows, and the opposite direction in the fall. Hunting pressure also impacts migration and movements. During the winter, they favor wooded areas and sheltered valleys for protection from <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> <b>and</b> availability of tree bark to eat. Roosevelt elk are generally non-migratory due to less seasonal variability of food sources.|$|E

5|$|The {{magnetic}} field {{of a star}} interacts with the stellar wind. As the wind {{moves away from the}} star its rate of angular velocity slows. The {{magnetic field}} of the star interacts with the wind, which applies a drag to the stellar rotation. As a result, angular momentum is transferred from the star to <b>the</b> <b>wind,</b> <b>and</b> over time this gradually slows the star's rate of rotation.|$|E
5|$|Commander George Eyre {{took over}} command of Speedy in February1794. Speedy {{supported}} the siege and capture of Bastia, after which Eyre {{was ordered to}} join Diadem off Nice. While making his way there on 9June, he ran into a French fleet under Rear-Admiral Pierre Martin, which had sailed from Toulon several days earlier. Eyre attempted to escape, but <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> <b>and</b> sea favoured the larger vessels, and Speedy was chased down and captured. Eyre was brought aboard Admiral Martin's flagship {{and was told that}} the National Convention had recently ordered that no quarter should be given to the English or Hanoverians, and that had Martin's ship been first alongside, he would have sunk Speedy. The sudden appearance of a British fleet curtailed the interview, and the French hurried back to Gourjean roadstead outside Toulon, taking Speedy and the captured British crew with them.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Lili caused great {{environmental}} {{damage to the}} marshes and barrier islands in Louisiana. Huge fish kills were observed in marshes near the landfall point, and in the Atchafalaya Swamp. The barrier islands {{to the east of}} the landfall point, those subjected to the highest surge, were severely eroded. Sand was also deposited behind them into the brackish marshes, burying vegetation. The freshwater marshes were severely damaged by <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> <b>and</b> surge, some of them completely destroyed. The severe erosion created new waterways connecting inland bodies of water with the Gulf of Mexico, which eventually led to further erosion of inland lagoons.|$|E
5|$|Owing to {{the present}} state of {{continental}} drift, the Northern Hemisphere is now fairly equally divided between land and sea (a ratio of about 2:3) but the South is overwhelmingly oceanic (1:4.7). Salinity in the open ocean is generally in a narrow band around 3.5% by mass, although this can vary in more landlocked waters, near the mouths of large rivers, or at great depths. About 85% of the solids in the open sea are sodium chloride. Deep-sea currents are produced by differences in salinity and temperature. Surface currents are formed by the friction of waves produced by <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> <b>and</b> by tides, the changes in local sea level produced by the gravity of the Moon and Sun. The direction of all of these is governed by surface and submarine land masses and by the rotation of the Earth (the Coriolis effect).|$|E
5|$|The {{aerodynamics}} of a {{wind turbine}} are not straightforward. The air flow at the blades {{is not the}} same as the airflow far away from the turbine. The very nature of the way in which energy is extracted from the air also causes air to be deflected by the turbine. In addition the aerodynamics of a wind turbine at the rotor surface exhibit phenomena that are rarely seen in other aerodynamic fields. The shape and dimensions of the blades of the wind turbine are determined by the aerodynamic performance required to efficiently extract energy from <b>the</b> <b>wind,</b> <b>and</b> by the strength required to resist the forces on the blade.|$|E

5|$|The {{hurricane}} dropped torrential rainfall {{over the}} Southeast United States, causing unprecedented devastation in the region. The storm {{was considered the}} worst to impact in the region in at least 29years. Precipitation peaked at 20.65in (525mm) in Idlewild, North Carolina. The heavy rainfall caused streams to greatly exceed their respective flood stages, damaging waterfront property. Many of the deaths occurred in North Carolina, where 30people died. Transportation was disrupted {{as a result of}} the debris scattered by <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> <b>and</b> rain. In Caldwell County alone, 90percent of bridges were swept away. Overall, the storm caused 50fatalities and $13million in damages.|$|E
5|$|Two days later, Tuesday 23 February, Gothenburg passed Cooktown {{at about}} 2:00pm. <b>The</b> <b>wind</b> <b>and</b> rain {{severely}} increased and cloud cover became so thick it blocked out the sun. Despite this, she continued the journey south into worsening weather, {{in a deep}} water passage between the North Queensland coastline and the Great Barrier Reef, known as the inner route. Although taking this route provided some protection from the open sea, captains had to navigate and thread {{their way through a}} number of then uncharted reefs. All passengers and crew expected to be in Newcastle on Sunday evening for a scheduled stopover.|$|E
5|$|Yaoi and Yuri (also {{known as}} Boys' Love and Girls' Love, respectively) are Japanese genres {{incorporating}} homosexual romance themes across various media. The genres {{emerged in the}} 1970s in a branch of manga aimed at girls. Yaoi and yuri have spread beyond Japan: both translated and original yaoi and yuri are now available in many countries and languages. The characters in yaoi and yuri manga do not tend to self-identify as homosexual or bisexual. Famous works include Hiizuredokoro no Tenshi (The Angel that Came from the Sun), an 11-volume series beginning in 1980 that reinterprets {{the life of the}} introducer of Buddhism to Japan; and Kaze to Ki no Uta (Poem of <b>the</b> <b>Wind</b> <b>and</b> the Trees), a 17-volume series beginning in 1976 that chronicles the relationship between two schoolboys in France.|$|E

5|$|After {{returning}} to London briefly in mid-1939, the couple returned to America, Leigh to film the final takes for Gone with <b>the</b> <b>Wind,</b> <b>and</b> Olivier {{to prepare for}} filming of Alfred Hitchcock's Rebecca—although the couple had hoped to appear in it together. Instead, Joan Fontaine was selected {{for the role of}} Mrs de Winter, as the producer David O. Selznick thought that not only was she more suitable for the role, but that it was best to keep Olivier and Leigh apart until their divorces came through. Olivier followed Rebecca with Pride and Prejudice, in the role of Mr. Darcy. To his disappointment Elizabeth Bennet was played by Greer Garson rather than Leigh. He received good reviews for both films and showed a more confident screen presence than he had in his early work. In January 1940 Olivier and Esmond were granted their divorce. In February, following another request from Leigh, her husband also applied for their marriage to be terminated.|$|E
5|$|Artists Mike Marsicano and Kurt Bickenbach played {{critical}} {{roles in}} the creation of the game's aircraft models, which were built in 3D Studio. As reference material, the team photographed real planes at several airfields, and they received blueprints and datasheets from aircraft manufacturers. The game's Grob G103a Twin II sailplane was based directly on the one that Blackley owned at the time. The sophistication of the real-time CFDs complicated the 3D modeling process, as the planes required accurate geometry to fly properly. While attempting to meet this goal, however, Bickenbach said that the models he created were overly detailed, which caused the team to struggle with performance issues related to the high number of polygons. Reducing the number altered the plane's shape, which in turn reduced its flight realism; this necessitated a balance between performance and accuracy. To obtain audio for the planes, Greg LoPiccolo and Tom Streit—former bassist and road manager, respectively, of the band Tribe—visited a Florida importer of Russian aerobatic aircraft. The two placed microphones inside the cockpits and next to the engines, and they flew each plane at multiple speeds while recording with a digital audio tape machine. Combining this material with digital recordings of wind sounds, the team fashioned a physics-based sound system: sounds of <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> <b>and</b> engine are altered in real-time based on wind speed in the game.|$|E
5|$|At 10:38 on {{the morning}} of 21 June, Fury detonated a ground mine off Juno Beach during a gale and the navy decided to tow her into the British Mulberry harbour at Arromanches where her damage could be evaluated. While waiting for a tugboat, she took on a 6° list to {{starboard}} from flooding. The Dutch tug Thames began towing the ship at 13:25; at 21:14, Fury accidentally collided with the stern of a freighter anchored outside the Mulberry, damaging her port side above the waterline, and the towline snapped at 21:49 when she struck another ship several times. She let go her anchor after drifting clear, but it almost immediately started dragging under the pressure of <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> <b>and</b> waves and the salvage ship Lincoln Salvor was secured alongside to steady Fury. Another tug made a towline fast at 22:18, but it immediately snapped when the tug began to pull forward. Lincoln Salvor had to cast off as her wooden hull was being damaged by slamming into Furys hull and six other tugboats attempted to tow the destroyer clear of the shipping in the Mulberry, but they all failed. Fury struck at least three other ships, including petrol and ammunition ships before she was driven ashore at 01:30. Her crew was able to walk to Arromanches at about 05:30 once the tide went out.|$|E
