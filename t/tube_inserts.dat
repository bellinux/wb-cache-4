This paper focuses specifically on a composite rack prototype with a direct tie in to Space Station hardware. The outlined prototype is an all composite construction, excluding metallic fasteners, washers, and their associated inserts. The rack utilizes braided carbon composite tubing for the frame with the sidewalls, backwall and flooring sections utilizing aircraft grade composite honeycomb sandwich panels. Novel additively manufactured thermoplastic joints and <b>tube</b> <b>inserts</b> were also developed {{in support of this}} effort. Joint and tube insert screening tests were conducted at a preliminary level. The screening tests allowed for modification, and enhancement, of the fabrication and design approaches, which will be outlined. The initial joint tests did not include mechanical fasteners. Adhesives were utilized at the joint to composite tube interfaces, along with mechanical fasteners during final fabrication (thus creating a stronger joint than the adhesive only variant). In general the prototype was focused on a potential in-space assembly approach, or kit-of-parts construction concept, which would not necessarily require the inclusion of an adhesive in the joint regions. However, given the tie in to legacy Station hardware (and potential flight loads with imbedded hardware mass loadings), the rack was built as stiff and strong as possible. Preliminary torque down tests were also conducted to determine the feasibility of mounting the composite honeycomb panels to the composite tubing sections via the additively manufactured <b>tube</b> <b>inserts.</b> Additional fastener torque down tests were also conducted with inserts (helicoils) imbedded within the joints.

40|$|Over {{the last}} three years ESDU have been working with {{engineers}} from oil companies and the companies that serve them in order to produce a guide describing the current state of knowledge on fouling in pre-heat trains and ways in which it can be mitigated. One result has been the identification and description of heat exchanger technologies that experience has shown to {{have a role to play}} in reducing fouling. This paper describes these developments. As shown elsewhere, the rate at which pre-heat train exchangers foul is controlled by fluid velocity and by wall temperature. Technologies which promote the heat transfer on the crude oil side of an exchanger are therefore favoured. (Note: promotion of the heat transfer on the hot side of the unit is not generally favoured, for this is likely to raise the wall temperature on the crude side).

40|$|Heat {{exchangers}} are {{an important}} component in many industrial systems especially in process industries.

However, common enhancement approaches such as adding fins or <b>tube</b> <b>inserts</b> may not always be suitable or feasible – especially in case of heat recovery from streams having a high fouling propensity. Since heat transfer rate depends also on flow field characteristics, fluid distribution, and fouling which can all be greatly influenced by the actual shapes of flow system components, several simplified models for fast and accurate enough prediction of fluid distribution as well as applications for shape optimization based on these models were developed. The created applications can then be employed during the design of heat exchange units to improve their performance and reliability...|$|E

40|$|AbstractA {{numerical}} {{investigation on}} heat transfer behaviors {{in a constant}} heat-fluxed round tube inserted with winglet vortex generators is conducted. Air as the working medium flows through the tube for Reynolds numbers (Re) between 4000 and 20, 000. The effect of using the rectangular-winglet tape (RWT) on heat transfer characteristics in the tube is numerically examined. For comparison purpose, the trapezoidal-winglet tape (TWT) and delta-winglet tape (DWT) are also offered. The RWT parameters in this work include four relative winglet-to-tube heights or blockage ratios (BR=b/D= 0. 1, 0. 15, 0. 2, and 0. 25) while the TWT and DWT are only at BR= 0. 2. All the winglet pairs are at a single attack angle (α= 45 °) and pitch ratio (p/D=PR= 4). The numerical {{results show that the}} Nusselt number (Nu) and friction factor (f) of the <b>tube</b> <b>inserts</b> are enhanced with increasing BR values. The Nu for the inserted tube is about 1. 8 - 2. 7 times above that for the smooth tube while the f is around 4. 5 - 11 times higher.

40|$|Despite the {{advantages}} of shell and tube heat exchangers, one of their major problems is low thermal efficiency. This problem can be improved by using heat transfer enhancement techniques such as adding nanoparticles to the hot or cold fluids, and/or using <b>tube</b> <b>inserts</b> as turbulators on tube side as well as changing baffles to a helical or twisted profile on the shell side. Although all of these techniques increase the thermal efficiency; however, engineers still need a quantitative approach {{to assess the impact}} of these technologies on the shell and tube heat exchangers. This study attempts to provide a combination of such techniques to increase the impact of these improvements quantitatively. For this purpose, at first stage the thermal and hydraulic characteristics of pure fluid, Al₂O₃/water nanofluid in a plain tube equipped with and without twisted tape turbulator is evaluated based on a developed rapid design algorithm. Therefore, the impact of using enhanced techniques either in form of individual or in hybrid format and the increase of nanoparticle concentration in base fluid have been studied. The results show that using turbulators individually and in hybrid format with nanofluid can be effected on design parameters of a typical heat exchanger by reducing the required heat transfer area up to 10 %...|$|E
40|$|Effects of {{reducing}} the upwind area of conical-strip <b>tube</b> <b>inserts</b> on heat transfer and friction factor characteristics of turbulent flow are experimentally investigated. The conical-strip insert resembles {{one quarter of the}} conical-ring insert in terms of its upwind area. Results show that the Nusselt number for the case with conical-strip inserts is only 53 - 56 % of that for the case with conical-ring inserts, the friction factor for the former is merely 4 - 6 % of that for the latter, and thus the thermo-hydraulic performance factor can be enhanced by 36 - 61 % if replacing conical-ring inserts with conical-strip inserts for turbulent flow within Re range 5000 - 25, 000. In addition, a comparative study of the short conical strip and the T-type conical strip, which can be regarded as boundary-cutting and core-cutting to the normal conical strip respectively, is performed. Results indicate that the flow resistance can be reduced by both methods. However, a weakened heat transfer and a worsened thermo-hydraulic performance are obtained for the case with boundary-cutting strip inserts. In contrast, the case with T-type core-cutting conical-strip inserts, if a suitable core-cutting size is taken, shows a better thermo-hydraulic performance as compared with the case with normal conical-strip inserts when the Reynolds number is relatively large. Effects of the pitch between neighboring strips have also been examined. It is found that smaller pitch leads to higher heat transfer rate whereas the flow resistance is increased. A moderate pitch between conical strips is beneficial to the overall thermo-hydraulic performance. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|E

The candidate inserts under investigation comprise highly porous aluminium foam inserts, twisted-in wire brushes, and flocked structures, that are investigated for their flow impedance, heat transfer performance, and cyclic dehumidification performance. The conducted analysis comprises experimental testing of insert specific pressure drop and heat transfer performance in a purpose built test rig, that led to the preselection of the foam structures and a twisted-in aluminium wire brush insert for desiccant coating and further investigation. Cyclic heat and mass transfer tests were performed in a purpose-built small-scale test rig, that simulated the dehumidification process of a desiccant rotor with and without employing water-cooling. The experimental analysis is complemented by a numerical investigation of the cyclic heat and mass transfer performance of the brush and metal foam type structures, modelled as two-dimensionally axis-symmetric porous media. The geometry based functions of the insert specific flow characteristics are derived from two- and three-dimensional pore scale computational fluid dynamics models, that are calibrated against experimental data. The validity of fundamental modelling assumptions was confirmed by a decent agreement between numerical and experimental steady-state heat transfer results. The heat and mass transfer investigation showed that the investigated structures were capable of eﬀectively removing heat during the dehumidification half-cycle.
