5|$|<b>The</b> <b>monarch</b> {{also has}} power to {{exercise}} her prerogative over {{the granting of}} honours, the regulation {{of the armed forces}} and ecclesiastical appointments. Although the granting of most honours is normally decided by the executive, <b>the</b> <b>monarch</b> is still the person who technically awards them. Exceptions to this rule are membership of the Order of the Garter, the Order of the Thistle, the Order of Merit, the Royal Victorian Order and the Royal Victorian Chain, which <b>the</b> <b>monarch</b> has complete discretion to grant. In relation to the armed forces, <b>the</b> <b>monarch</b> is the Commander in Chief, and members are regulated under the royal prerogative. Most statutes do not apply to the armed forces, although some areas, such as military discipline, are governed by Acts of Parliament. Under the Crown Proceedings Act 1947, <b>the</b> <b>monarch</b> is the sole authority for the armed forces, and as such their organisation, disposition and control cannot be questioned by the courts. This exercise of prerogative power gives the Crown authority to recruit members of the armed forces, appoint commissioned officers, and establish agreements with foreign governments to station troops in their territory. The prerogative empowers <b>the</b> <b>monarch</b> to appoint bishops and archbishops in the Church of England, and to regulate the printing and licensing of the authorised Church of England version of the Bible. <b>The</b> <b>monarch</b> also exerts a certain influence power on His or Her weekly and closed conversations with the Prime-Minister of the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>monarch</b> {{and his or}} her {{immediate}} family undertake various official, ceremonial, diplomatic and representational duties. As the monarchy is constitutional, <b>the</b> <b>monarch</b> is limited to non-partisan functions such as bestowing honours and appointing the Prime Minister. <b>The</b> <b>monarch</b> is, by tradition, commander-in-chief of the British Armed Forces. Though the ultimate formal executive authority over the government of the United Kingdom is still by and through the monarch's royal prerogative, these powers may only be used according to laws enacted in Parliament and, in practice, within the constraints of convention and precedent.|$|E

50|$|In 2008 <b>the</b> <b>Monarchs</b> were {{markedly}} less strong, but {{hung around}} the Western Playoff picture all season {{and finished with}} the #4 seed. Facing the Silver Stars again in the first round, <b>the</b> <b>Monarchs</b> were hoping for some payback for 2007. The series did not start well for <b>the</b> <b>Monarchs,</b> as they dropped Game 1 at home 85-78. Now the series shifted to San Antonio, and it seemed the series would come to a quick end. But <b>the</b> <b>Monarchs</b> would not back down, blowing out the Silver Stars in Game 2 84-67, forcing the critical Game 3. In Game 3, the Stars came out strong {{and at one point}} had a 14-point lead.

5|$|A {{coronation}} is the act {{of placement}} or bestowal of a crown upon a monarch's head. The term generally also refers {{not only to the}} physical crowning but to the whole ceremony wherein {{the act of}} crowning occurs, along with the presentation of other items of regalia, marking the formal investiture of a monarch with regal power. Aside from the crowning, a coronation ceremony may comprise many other rituals such as the taking of special vows by <b>the</b> <b>monarch,</b> the investing and presentation of regalia to <b>the</b> <b>monarch,</b> and acts of homage by the new ruler's subjects and the performance of other ritual deeds of special significance to the particular nation. Western-style coronations have often included anointing <b>the</b> <b>monarch</b> with holy oil, or chrism as it is often called; the anointing ritual's religious significance follows examples found in the Bible. The monarch's consort may also be crowned, either simultaneously with <b>the</b> <b>monarch</b> or as a separate event.|$|E
5|$|After being anointed, <b>the</b> <b>monarch</b> {{rises from}} the Coronation Chair and kneels down at a faldstool {{placed in front of}} it. The {{archbishop}} then concludes the ceremonies of the anointing by reciting a prayer that is the English translation of the ancient Latin prayer Deus, Dei Filius, recited in the consecration of other Christian sovereigns. Once this prayer is finished, <b>the</b> <b>monarch</b> rises and sits again in the Coronation Chair. The Knights of the Garter then bear away the canopy.|$|E
5|$|In Part II of the 1978 Spanish constitution, among {{provisions}} {{concerning the}} Crown, Article 62(a) invests the sanction (i.e. Royal Assent) and promulgation of laws with <b>the</b> <b>monarch</b> of Spain. Chapter 2 of Part III, concerning the Drafting of Bills, outlines the {{method by which}} bills are passed. According to Article 91, <b>the</b> <b>monarch</b> shall give his or her assent and promulgate the new law within fifteen days of passage of a bill by the Cortes Generales. Article 92 invests <b>the</b> <b>monarch</b> {{with the right to}} call for a referendum, on the advice {{of the president of the}} government (commonly referred to in English as the prime minister) and the authorisation of the cortes.|$|E
50|$|Practice {{sessions}} {{would take}} place outside Jones' house and Van Morrison, then a part-time saxophone player, would often join these sessions.

5|$|In {{addition}} to the oath, <b>the</b> <b>monarch</b> may take {{what is known as}} the Accession Declaration if he or she has not yet made it. This declaration was first required by the Bill of Rights of 1689 and is required to be taken at either the first meeting of the parliament after a new monarch's accession (i.e. during the State Opening of Parliament) or at his or her coronation. <b>The</b> <b>monarch</b> additionally swears a separate oath to preserve Presbyterian church government in the Church of Scotland and this oath is taken before the coronation.|$|E
5|$|Most of the monarchies in Europe are {{constitutional}} monarchies, {{which means}} that <b>the</b> <b>monarch</b> does not influence {{the politics of the}} state: either <b>the</b> <b>monarch</b> is legally prohibited from doing so, or <b>the</b> <b>monarch</b> does not utilize the political powers vested in the office by convention. The exceptions are Liechtenstein and Monaco, which are usually considered semi-constitutional monarchies due to the large influence the princes still have on politics, and the Vatican City, which is a theocratic absolute elective monarchy. There is currently no major campaign to abolish the monarchy (see monarchism and republicanism) in any of the twelve states, although there is a significant minority of republicans in many of them (e.g. the political organisation Republic in the United Kingdom). Currently seven of the twelve monarchies are members of the European Union: Belgium, Denmark, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|On {{the day of}} the abdication, the Oireachtas, the {{parliament}} of the Irish Free State, removed all direct mention of <b>the</b> <b>monarch</b> from the Irish constitution. The next day, it passed the External Relations Act, which gave <b>the</b> <b>monarch</b> limited authority (strictly on the advice of the government) to appoint diplomatic representatives for Ireland and {{to be involved in the}} making of foreign treaties. The two acts made the Irish Free State a republic in essence without removing its links to the Commonwealth.|$|E

5|$|Prerogative {{powers were}} {{formerly}} exercised by <b>the</b> <b>monarch</b> acting {{on his or}} her own initiative.

Tony Guzzo was hired from VCU in 1995 after McMahon left ODU and led <b>the</b> <b>Monarchs</b> to {{back-to-back}} CAA titles and NCAA Tournaments in his first two seasons at the helm.

5|$|The royal court {{consisted}} of leading nobles, office holders, ambassadors and supplicants who surrounded the king or queen. At its centre was <b>the</b> <b>monarch</b> {{and members of}} the Privy Chamber. Gentleman of the chamber were usually leading nobles or individuals with kinship links to the leading noble families. They had direct access to <b>the</b> <b>monarch,</b> with the implication of being to exert influence, and were usually resident at the court. Although increasingly based at the royal palace of Holyrood in Edinburgh, <b>the</b> <b>monarch</b> and the court were often itinerant, spending time at one of the royal palaces, such as Linlithgow, Sterling and Falkland, or undertaking a royal progress to a part of the kingdom to ensure that the rule of law, royal authority or smooth government was maintained.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Monarch's</b> {{championship}} title {{had some}} controversy, however, {{due to an}} illegal goaltender substitution earlier in the playoffs.
