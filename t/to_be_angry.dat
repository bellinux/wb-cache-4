His wife Deborah Nadoolman purchased most of the costumes at local thrift stores, and she and Judy Belushi made the party togas. Landis and Bruce McGill staged a scene for reporters visiting the set where the director pretended <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>angry</b> at the actor for being difficult on the set. Landis grabbed a breakaway pitcher and smashed it over McGill's head. He {{fell to the ground}} and pretended to be unconscious. The reporters were completely fooled, and when Landis asked McGill to get up, he refused to move.|$|E
25|$|In 1999, the Liberal {{strategy}} {{had been}} to polarize the electorate between Mike Harris and Dalton McGuinty. They purposely put out a platform that was devoid of ideas, to ensure the election was about the Tory record, and not the Liberal agenda. To an extent, they succeeded. Support for the NDP collapsed from 21% to just 13%, while the Liberals climbed 9%. However, while they almost cornered the market of those angry at the Tories, they could not convince enough people <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>angry</b> at the Tories to win.|$|E

The order alleged that Petrelis and Pasquarelli made dozens of obscene and threatening calls to editors and reporters at home and at work. The newspaper's lawyers said the activists appeared <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>angry</b> about two stories published in the newspaper, one about an increase in unsafe sex practices among gay men in San Francisco, another about SFDPH statistics showing rising rates of syphilis among gay men in San Francisco.|$|E

When Jiang Gan shows up, Zhou Yu pretends <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>angry</b> at him for {{stealing}} the letter earlier and orders his men to deny Jiang entry into his camp. Jiang Gan wanders around and meets Pang Tong in a nearby temple by chance, without knowing that Pang has been expecting him. He escapes and brings Pang Tong back with him to meet Cao Cao. Pang Tong gives fake advice to Cao Cao by suggesting that he uses metal chains to link his warships together to reduce the chances of his troops falling seasick. The chained-linked ships later become vulnerable to the fire attack during the Battle of Red Cliffs.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Yang Yuqing, Yang Rushi, Yang Yuqing's brother Yang Han'gong (楊漢工), Zhang Yuanfu (張元夫), and Xiao Huan (蕭澣) were {{perceived}} by Emperor Wenzong {{to be overly}} eager in their partisanship, {{and he began to}} dislike them. After he made Li Deyu chancellor in 833, Li Deyu used Emperor Wenzong's dislike for these officials to begin ejecting Niu Faction officials from the government. Li Zongmin responded by having Zheng Tan, who was then imperial scholar, removed from his post as imperial scholar—but Emperor Wenzong reacted by promoting Zheng to be the chief imperial censor without consulting Li Zongmin, which caused Li Zongmin <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>angry</b> and fearful. Soon thereafter, Li Zongmin himself was sent out to Shannan West Circuit (山南西道, headquartered in modern Hanzhong, Shaanxi), to serve as its military governor.|$|E
25|$|Pat disowned his {{entertainer}} father, Simon Reynolds, {{when the}} latter {{came out as}} a homosexual. Simon has made efforts to reconcile with his son, which Pat has disgustedly repulsed. The entire topic of his father is off limits to Pat, suggesting repression issues. The comic has hinted at this complexity of his character for some time. In 2006, his own latent homosexuality was forced {{out into the open}} by the magical Mexican realism camera. Apparently both Pat and his father magically became homosexual due to the curse of Gladdington castle, wherein an ancestor of theirs was cursed such that all of his sons and their sons thereafter would become homosexual at the age of 26. Pat has since become much more comfortable about his homosexuality, using perceived persecution as just another reason <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>angry</b> at the world, and has been dating Rod Huggins, a gay porn star.|$|E

25|$|Finally, {{anger in}} {{infidelity}} is quite inevitable. In the initial stage of infidelity anger {{is not as}} apparent as it is seen in stage two, because there is not hard facts or evidence supporting one’s suspicions. Like previously talked about the accuser most likely feels jealous and incompetent {{in the first stage}} of cheating. These emotions can contract into anger and provide a cognitive state of anger, because the accusing person anticipates his or her anger. Unlike jealousy and resentment, it is hard to identify the purpose or cause of the individual’s anger because in reality there is nothing yet <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>angry</b> about, there is no proof of their romantic partner’s unfaithfulness. 25% of people surveyed felt angry in the beginning or suspicion stage of infidelity (Johnson, 2017). It is hard to pinpoint the anger emotion in the initial stages due to ambiguity; therefore, it begins to take on other emotions turning into a cognitive state of emotional turmoil. The individual knows they are angry and anticipates it, but cannot logically explain it to their partner {{because of the lack of}} evidence they have.|$|E
25|$|It {{is clear}} to Lizaveta Prokofyevna and General Yepanchin that their {{daughter}} {{is in love with}} the Prince, but Aglaya denies this and angrily dismisses talk of marriage. She continues to mock and reproach him, often in front of others, and lets slip that, as far as she is concerned, the problem of Nastassya Filippovna is yet to be resolved. Myshkin himself merely experiences an uncomplicated joy in her presence and is mortified when she appears <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>angry</b> with him. Lizaveta Prokofyevna feels it is time to introduce the Prince to their aristocratic circle and a dinner party is arranged for this purpose, to be attended by a number of eminent and influential persons. Aglaya, who does not share her parents' respect for these people and is afraid that Myshkin's eccentricity will not meet with their approval, tries to tell him how to behave, but ends by sarcastically telling him to be as eccentric as he likes, and to be sure to wave his arms about when he is pontificating on some high-minded subject and break her mother's priceless Chinese vase. Feeling her anxiety, Myshkin too becomes extremely anxious, but he tells her that it is nothing compared to the joy he feels in her company. He tries to approach the subject of Nastasya Filippovna again, but she silences him and hurriedly leaves.|$|E
25|$|Śrībhārgavamithilāgamanam (Sanskrit: श्रीभार्गवमिथिलागमनम्) In {{only her}} sixth year, Sītā's {{appearance}} {{is like that}} of a sixteen-year-old. Her beauty is described by the poet in 12 verses (13.9–13.20). Janaka realizes that his daughter is the Ādi Śakti of Rāma and no ordinary girl, as she can drag the onerous bow of Śiva as a child. He is concerned about Sītā getting a deserving husband. He thinks about the doctrine of Avatāra, having heard verses about it in the Vedas, but his intellect and rationalism make him not believe it. After much contemplation, he concludes that the doctrine must be true. Just then, a doorkeeper announces the arrival of Paraśurāma in Mithilā. Janaka bows down to Paraśurāma. Knowing Janaka to be a noble king, Paraśurāma does not consider him to be his enemy, unlike the despotic Kṣatriyas. Paraśurāma expresses his wish to see Sītā. Janaka leads him to the sacrificial assembly (Yajñaśālā), where Paraśurāma sees Sītā playing with the bow of Śiva by dragging it like a play-horse. Paraśurāma asks Janaka to hold a Svayaṃvara for Sītā in which the prince who breaks the bow of Śiva will have the right to marry Sītā. Paraśurāma further predicts that Rāma, the descendant of Raghu, will break the bow. Paraśurāma tells Janaka that he will arrive again in Mithilā, pretending <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>angry,</b> so that he can have an excuse of seeing both Sītā and Rāma. At the end of the canto Paraśurāma bows to the child Sītā and starts to praise her.|$|E

Although atheists disagree with the pillar of many religions, namely the existence of a God, it may not necessarily be the case that they <b>are</b> <b>angry</b> individuals. The prevalence and accuracy of angry-atheist perceptions were examined in 7 studies with 1, 677 participants from multiple institutions and locations in the United States. Studies 1 – 3 revealed that people believe atheists <b>are</b> <b>angrier</b> than believers, people in general, and other minority groups, both explicitly and implicitly. Studies 4 – 7 then examined the accuracy of these beliefs. Belief in God, state anger, and trait anger were assessed in multiple ways and contexts. None of these studies supported the idea that atheists <b>are</b> particularly <b>angry</b> individuals. Rather, these results support the idea that people believe atheists <b>are</b> <b>angry</b> individuals, but they do not appear <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>angrier</b> than other individuals in reality...|$|R

The diagnosis is confirmed: the parasite embedded itself in Jeff's brain during his stay in the country, thus causing the shift in his personality and giving him the inability <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>angry.</b> At the end of the episode the only evident change is that the patient says he now does not like ketchup, although he does wonder aloud to his wife, [...] "I wonder what else I don't like," [...] which appears to make her anxious.|$|E

500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{synopsis}} survives in The Bioscope from December 22, 1910. It states: [...] "Max, an old musician, {{finds it hard to}} support his two motherless daughters, one of whom is blind, and the professor takes great pride in his daughter's musical education. The little one sings and the blind girl plays upon the violin. But sickness and death overtake the professor, and the orphans find themselves penniless and homeless. They are compelled to sing in the streets, and thus eke out a precarious livelihood. While walking through a fashionable street one day Marie sees the sign of the famous doctor. She calls her blind sister's attention to it, but the girl has no hope that the doctor will see penniless patients. Marie returns {{in time to see the}} doctor alight from his carriage, but the servant refuses to allow the ragged little girl to follow him. Marie conceives the idea of hiding in the doctor's carriage, and when he sets out on his rounds he discovers the terrified little girl. She pleads with him not <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>angry,</b> and tells of her sister's affliction. The doctor goes with her to see Violet, and has the stricken girl taken to a hospital, where he operates successfully upon her eyes. Mr. Grey brings Violet to the attention of some charitable women, who see that she does not lack professional engagements. While returning from one of her recitals, Dr. Grey offers to drive her home, and proposes to Violet, and is accepted.
