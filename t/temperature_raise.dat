5000|$|Conversely, when air is {{compressed}} to {{fill the}} tank, its temperature increases. If the stored air is not cooled while the tank is being filled, then when the air cools off later, its pressure decreases and the available energy decreases. To mitigate this, the tank may be equipped with an internal heat-exchanger in order to cool the air quickly and efficiently while charging. Alternatively, a spring {{may be used to}} store work from the air as it is inserted in the tank, thus maintaining a low pressure difference between the tank and recharger, which results in a lower <b>temperature</b> <b>raise</b> for the transferred air.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe motor of a mini {{electric}} vehicle uses dozens of storage batteries as power supply, which has low voltage and large current. Therefore, the loss and <b>temperature</b> <b>raise</b> {{of the motor}} is high. In this paper, the loss of different induction motors for mini {{electric vehicle}}s is calculated {{and the effects of}} rotor materials and air gap length on the performance of these motors are studied. The analyses show that the efficiency of the motor with a copper mouse cage rotor is considerably higher than that of the motor with a aluminum rotor. The <b>temperature</b> <b>raise</b> of both an air-cooling and a water-cooling induction motor is analyzed, which demonstrates that the <b>temperature</b> <b>raise</b> of the motor windings is higher than that of the other parts, and the <b>temperature</b> <b>raise</b> of the water-cooling motor is lower than that of the air-cooling motor. To verify the results of the theoretical analyses, four prototype induction motors (aluminum rotor, copper mouse cage rotor, air-cooling and spiral groove machine) have been designed and processed. The experiments to measure the efficiency and <b>temperature</b> <b>raise</b> were carried out on these motors. The experimental results prove that the theoretical analyses are correct...|$|E
