50|$|Power is {{transmitted}} from the engine to the drive system <b>through</b> <b>drive</b> belts. Originally, the R22 used four separate v-belts running on multi-groove sheaves. This system proved problematic, as individual belts would sometimes roll over in their groove and fail. As a temporary measure, in 1982, R22 operators received a kit from Robinson that was installed in the cockpit and on the belt tension actuator, isolating the tensioning circuits and locking the clutch/drive system at take-off tension. The problem was ultimately solved by replacing the four individual v-belts with two dual v-belts. The upper, driven sheave is mounted on the main/tail rotor drive shaft incorporating flexible couplings, and is raised and lowered relative to the engine-mounted, driving sheave {{by means of a}} belt tension actuator. During shutdown, the actuator is used to lower the upper sheave to loosen the drive belts. For startup, the engine is started with the belts loose, allowing the engine to run without spinning the rotor system. Immediately after engine start, the clutch switch located in the cockpit is closed by the pilot, powering the actuator to slowly raise the upper sheave to flight position, which tightens the belts. The actuator is thereafter controlled by pressure-sensing column springs, automatically maintaining proper belt tension during flight as the belts wear and stretch. The shaft on which the upper sheave is mounted drives both the main and tail rotors; the main gear box delivers power to the main rotor shaft through a set of splash-lubricated spiral bevel gears.|$|E

More than 80 {{percent of the}} marine mammals in our care were born in our parks. We haven't collected a dolphin from the wild in decades." [...] However, Jacobs does not condemn those who purchase from the Taiji dolphin hunt. O'Barry has thus been criticized for emphasizing that dolphinariums are a large contributing factor to the economic success of the dolphin slaughter in Taiji and for encouraging boycotts of dolphin shows to protest the dolphin slaughter. The scene in The Cove that displays a map consisting of arrows emanating from Taiji and pointing to countries with dolphinariums has been said to be misleading since {{the majority of those}} countries do not currently have dolphins of Japanese origin. In the United States it is currently illegal to import dolphins obtained from a drive, including the drive hunt at Taiji, as it is considered an inhumane method.

40|$|Abstract—The {{existence}} of coverage holes in cellular networks {{is a common}} problem for mobile operators. Traditionally, the cellular coverage is computed using sophisticated planning tools, and then optimized <b>through</b> <b>drive</b> tests. With the drive tests information, the operators detect the poorly covered areas and take actions to eliminate them. The introduction of self-organized or “cognitive ” techniques, would allow the operators to maxi-mize the network’s information obtained <b>through</b> <b>drive</b> tests or reported by the mobile users. In this paper we propose the use of spatial Bayesian geo-statistics to build a Radio Environment Map (REM) for real coverage hole detection purposes. Results show {{that the number of}} pixels forming the coverage holes, as well as the probability of detecting them, can be significantly increased with the use of REMs, compared to the case where only network measurements are used.

30|$|Detection and {{assessment}} of coverage holes are both related to fault detection and diagnosis within self-healing [10] and coverage optimization [11]. Traditionally, coverage holes have been detected <b>through</b> <b>drive</b> tests, which are characterized by being time consuming and expensive. For this reason, particular attention is being given to automatically detect coverage holes through the already standardized mobile traces [12] and Minimization of Drive Tests feature [13 – 16], which allows operators to automatically store both the user measurements and the signaling messages. Some existing studies propose different methods to detect coverage holes. An approach to improve {{the accuracy of the}} coverage hole prediction based on a spatial Bayesian framework is presented in [17]. In addition, another technique to detect real coverage holes by means of radio environment maps is provided in [18]. However, according to [19], an LTE coverage hole has a different impact on the network depending on whether it is covered by an underlying radio access technology (uRAT) or not, so the way of compensating or optimizing them will be different. Since LTE networks are continually growing, not only the detection of coverage holes, but also the quantification of their impact would be helpful to determine how it should be improved.|$|E
