5|$|Goldfrapp {{signed a}} {{recording}} contract with London-based record label Mute Records in August 1999. The pair began recording their debut album over a six-month period, beginning in September 1999, {{in a rented}} bungalow in the Wiltshire countryside. The recording process was difficult for Alison Goldfrapp, who was often alone and disturbed by the mice and insects in the bungalow. Gregory described their recording sessions as intense because he was unaccustomed to composing with others. Goldfrapp contributed the album's lyrics, and Gregory and Goldfrapp composed the music together. The lyrics are abstract obsessional tales inspired by films, Goldfrapp's childhood, and <b>the</b> <b>loneliness</b> she felt while recording the album. Musically, the album takes influence {{from a variety of}} styles including 1960s pop, cabaret, folk, and electronica.|$|E

5|$|Sarah's {{success as}} a leader of the {{opposition}} only intensified the Queen's animosity towards the Marlboroughs. Although she could not dismiss Sarah from Anne's service, Mary responded by evicting Sarah from her court lodgings at the Palace of Whitehall. Anne responded by leaving the court as well, and Sarah and she went to stay with their friends Charles Seymour, the sixth Duke of Somerset, and Elizabeth, the Duchess of Somerset at Syon House. Anne continued to defy the Queen’s demand for Sarah’s dismissal, even though an incriminating document signed by the Earl of Marlborough supporting the recently exiled James II and his supporters had been discovered. This document is likely to have been forged by Robert Young, a known forger and disciple of Titus Oates; Oates was famous for stirring a strongly anti-Catholic atmosphere in England between 1679 and the early 1680s. The Earl was imprisoned in the Tower of London. <b>The</b> <b>loneliness</b> Sarah suffered during these events drew her and Anne closer together.|$|E

25|$|Films about {{athletics}} are overwhelmingly {{focused on}} running events: the 1962 film <b>The</b> <b>Loneliness</b> of the Long Distance Runner (based {{on the book}} of the same name) explores cross country running as a means of escape.

Track and field has been the subject of American films such as Personal Best (1981) and Across the Tracks (1991). Biopics are found within the genre, including Prefontaine (regarding Steve Prefontaine) and Jim Thorpe – All-American (1951) featuring Burt Lancaster as Thorpe.

25|$|Poetry {{and cruelty}} of life were harmonically {{combined}} {{in the works}} that Vittorio De Sica wrote and directed together with screenwriter Cesare Zavattini: among them, Shoeshine (1946), The Bicycle Thief (1948) and Miracle in Milan (1951). The 1952 film Umberto D. showed a poor old man with his little dog, who must beg for alms against his dignity in <b>the</b> <b>loneliness</b> of the new society. This work is perhaps De Sica's masterpiece {{and one of the}} most important works in Italian cinema. It was not a commercial success and since then it has been shown on Italian television only a few times. Yet it is perhaps the most violent attack, in the apparent quietness of the action, against the rules of the new economy, the new mentality, the new values, and it embodies both a conservative and a progressive view.|$|E

In The Go-Between, he played the part of Lord Hugh Trimingham, for which he won a BAFTA award for Best Supporting Actor.

40|$|In adolescence, feeling {{lonely and}} dealing with time spent alone become {{particularly}} salient. The present study examined the co-occurrence of parent- and peer-related loneliness, and positive and negative attitudes toward aloneness, using cluster analysis. In three independent samples, covering about 1, 800 adolescents (61 % female), six meaningful groups were identified. These groups showed different associations with adolescents’ self-esteem and personality, parental responsiveness and psychological control, and peer group functioning and friendships. An adaptive pattern of correlates was found for adolescents {{in three of the}} six groups, that is, the Indifference group (with rather low scores on the four constructs), the Moderate group (with moderate scores on the four constructs), and the Negative Attitude Toward Aloneness group. A rather maladaptive pattern of correlates was found for adolescents in the three other groups, that is, <b>the</b> Peer-Related <b>Loneliness</b> group, <b>the</b> Positive Attitude Toward Aloneness group, and <b>the</b> Parent-Related <b>Loneliness</b> group. More specifically, adolescents in <b>the</b> Peer-Related <b>Loneliness</b> and Positive Attitude Toward Aloneness groups may need assistance regarding their relations with their peers, whereas adolescents in <b>the</b> Parent-Related <b>Loneliness</b> group may need assistance regarding their relations with their parents.

Method: The English version was translated into Chinese. Content validity was established by group discussion and Delphi panel.

Results: The content validity was high as shown by the results of the Delphi panel. Cronbach's α of the 6 -item scale was 0. 76. For the inter-rater reliability of the six items, the intra-class correlation coefficients ranged from 0. 98 to 1. 00. <b>The</b> emotional <b>loneliness</b> subscale significantly correlated with <b>the</b> social <b>loneliness</b> subscale (ρ = 0. 37; p < 0. 001).
