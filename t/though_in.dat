5|$|In some species, the {{luciferase}} requires other cofactors such as calcium or magnesium ions, {{and sometimes}} also the energy-carrying molecule adenosine triphosphate (ATP). In evolution, luciferins vary little: one in particular, coelenterazine, {{is found in}} eleven different animal (phyla), <b>though</b> <b>in</b> some of these, the animals obtain it through their diet. Conversely, luciferases vary widely between different species, and consequently bioluminescence has arisen over forty times in evolutionary history.|$|E
