5|$|On 15 August 2008, 1FLTV, {{licensed}} by Liechtenstein's Government, {{became the first}} broadcaster based in Liechtenstein. This would allow the country to begin competing at the Eurovision Song Contest for the first <b>time,</b> <b>should</b> they decide to join the EBU, a pre-requisite for entering the contest. Shortly after its foundation however, the broadcaster announced {{that they were not}} interested in joining the EBU or Eurovision at that time because they had no budget for membership.|$|E
5|$|Optimally, the speedup from parallelization {{would be}} linear—doubling {{the number of}} {{processing}} elements should halve the runtime, and doubling it a second <b>time</b> <b>should</b> again halve the runtime. However, very few parallel algorithms achieve optimal speedup. Most {{of them have a}} near-linear speedup for small numbers of processing elements, which flattens out into a constant value for large numbers of processing elements.|$|E
5|$|All {{apprentices}} were to {{be educated}} in reading, writing and arithmetic {{for the first four}} years of their apprenticeship. The Act specified that this should be done every working day within usual working hours but did not state how much <b>time</b> <b>should</b> be set aside for it. Educational classes should be held {{in a part of the}} mill or factory designed for the purpose. Every Sunday, for one hour, apprentices {{were to be}} taught the Christian religion; every other Sunday, a divine service should be held in the factory, and every month the apprentices should visit a church. They should be prepared for confirmation in the Church of England between the ages of 14 and 18 and must be examined by a clergyman at least once a year. Male and female apprentices were to sleep separately and not more than two per bed.|$|E

5|$|There {{are some}} {{unresolved}} {{questions concerning the}} definition of work: in particular, whether unpaid endeavors, such as volunteering or studying, are work. Non-work <b>time</b> <b>should</b> not be equated with free time, as it comprises not only free time, dedicated to leisure, but also time dedicated to certain obligatory activities, such as housework. Dividing activities into free and dedicated time is not easy. For example, brushing one's teeth is neither work nor leisure; scholars differ in their classifications of activities such as eating a meal, shopping, repairing a car, attending a religious ceremony, or showering (various individuals {{may or may not}} classify such activities as leisure). The relation between work and leisure can also be unclear: research indicates that some individuals find skills that they have acquired at work useful to their hobbies (and vice versa), and some individuals have used leisure activities to advance their work careers. Sociologists also disagree as to whether political or spiritual activities should be included in studies of leisure. Further, among some occupational communities, such as police officers or miners, it is common for work colleagues to be off-time friends and to share similar, work-based leisure activities.|$|E
5|$|What {{followed}} {{was the first}} of three consecutive controversial and painful Game 7s in which Chamberlain played. In that Game 7, the Sixers could not get their act together: 15,202 stunned Philadelphia fans witnessed a historic 100–96 defeat, making it the first time in NBA history a team lost a series after leading three games to one. Although Cherry points out that the Sixers shot badly (Hal Greer, Wali Jones, Chet Walker, Luke Jackson and Matt Guokas hit a combined 25 of 74 shots) and Chamberlain grabbed 34 rebounds and shot 4-of-9, the center himself scored only 14 points. In the second half of Game 7, Chamberlain did not attempt a single shot from the field. Cherry observes a strange pattern in that game: in a typical Sixers game, Chamberlain got the ball 60 times in the low post, but only 23 times in Game 7, and only seven times in the third and only twice in the fourth quarter. Chamberlain later blamed coach Hannum for the lack of touches, a point which the coach conceded himself, but Cherry points out that Chamberlain, who always thought of himself as the best player of all <b>time,</b> <b>should</b> have been outspoken enough to demand the ball himself. The loss meant that Chamberlain was now 1–6 in playoff series against the Celtics.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to earlier}} {{recurring}} issues with mistranslations related to news updates, the team {{decided not to}} implement forums in the original release, instead hearing player feedback through fan sites and unofficial forums. Also because of mistranslation fears, dedicated teams {{in each of the}} game's release regions would gather feedback and transmit it to the development team. The game's first closed Alpha test began on March 11, 2010. It was available only to veteran players from XI. During alpha testing, the team used player feedback to find out key problems with the game, such as limitations on graphical adjustments making the game run at a slow frame rate. The open Beta test was originally scheduled to begin on August 31, but was indefinitely postponed due to the discovery of critical bugs in the game. The Beta test eventually went live on September 2, running until the game's release later that month. It was later stated that more <b>time</b> <b>should</b> have been given to fixing bugs during the Beta period. The game released on September 30, 2010, six months prior to the PS3 version's projected release date of March 2011. A Collector's Edition was released on September 22, allowing owners to log into the game from that date. The Collector's Edition, which was decorated by artwork from Amano and Yoshida, came with bonus items including a DVD featuring a behind-the-scenes documentary, a security token, a case for the game's box, and a decorated tumbler. The game was released with text in Japanese, English, French and German, while the spoken dialogue in cutscenes was English in all versions.|$|E

25|$|A year later, Maccabi Haifa won {{a second}} {{championship}} in a decisive performance. In 1986 Maccabi lost the championship in a controversial final match against runners-up Hapoel Tel Aviv. The single goal scored in that match by Gili Landau {{was said to}} be scored from a passive offside position, which by the rules of the <b>time</b> <b>should</b> have resulted in a disqualification of the goal and a scoreless draw, guaranteeing MHFC the title. Due to poor TV coverage, the issue has never been resolved.|$|E
5000|$|The raid and martyrdoms did {{not stop}} recusancy at Lyford. In 1690 an {{informer}} reported that a small estate in the parish had been reserved to build a nunnery [...] "when Popish <b>times</b> <b>should</b> come".|$|R
50|$|In {{his work}} Miranda in 1858 he {{develops}} {{the idea of}} time zones. Filopanti's hypothesis was to ideally split up the earth into 24 areas (zones) {{along the lines of}} the meridians, each of which should have its own time. Each <b>time</b> zone <b>should</b> differ from the next by one hour, whereas minutes and seconds should coincide. The first <b>time</b> zone <b>should</b> be centred on Rome's meridian. The splitting into <b>time</b> zones <b>should</b> establish the local time (L). His hypothesis provided also with the establishing of a universal <b>time</b> (U) that <b>should</b> be used as only datum line in astronomy and telegraph communications.|$|R

25|$|Subependymal nodules are {{composed}} of abnormal, swollen glial cells and bizarre multinucleated cells which are indeterminate for glial or neuronal origin. Interposed neural tissue is not present. These nodules {{have a tendency to}} calcify as the patient ages. A nodule that markedly enhances and enlarges over <b>time</b> <b>should</b> be considered suspicious for transformation into a subependymal giant cell astrocytoma, which typically develops in the region of the foramen of Monro, in which case it is at risk of developing an obstructive hydrocephalus.|$|E
25|$|One early {{attempt at}} {{lengthening}} the playing <b>time</b> <b>should</b> be mentioned. At least one manufacturer {{in the early}} 1920s, World Records, produced records that played at a constant linear velocity, controlled by Noel Pemberton Billing's patented add-on governor device. As these were played from the outside to the inside, the rotational speed of the records increased as reproduction progressed. This action is similar (although in reverse) to that on the modern compact disc and the CLV version of its predecessor, the Philips Laser Disc.|$|E
25|$|TEMED (N, N, N, N-tetramethylethylenediamine) (C6H16N2; mW: 116.21) stabilizes free {{radicals}} and improves polymerization. The rate of polymerisation and {{the properties of}} the resulting gel depend on the concentrations of {{free radicals}}. Increasing the amount of free radicals results in a decrease in the average polymer chain length, an increase in gel turbidity and a decrease in gel elasticity. Decreasing the amount shows the reverse effect. The lowest catalytic concentrations that allow polymerisation in a reasonable period of <b>time</b> <b>should</b> be used. APS and TEMED are typically used at approximately equimolar concentrations in the range of 1 to 10 mM.|$|E

25|$|The OPERA {{experiment}} {{was designed to}} capture how neutrinos switch between different identities, but Autiero realized the equipment {{could be used to}} precisely measure neutrino speed too. An earlier result from the MINOS experiment at Fermilab demonstrated that the measurement was technically feasible. The principle of the OPERA neutrino velocity {{experiment was}} to compare travel time of neutrinos against travel time of light. The neutrinos in the experiment emerged at CERN and flew to the OPERA detector. The researchers divided this distance by the speed of light in vacuum to predict what the neutrino travel <b>time</b> <b>should</b> be. They compared this expected value to the measured travel time.|$|E
25|$|It {{was later}} {{claimed by the}} Keller group in Switzerland that {{particle}} tunneling does indeed occur in zero real time. Their tests involved tunneling electrons, where the group argued a relativistic prediction for tunneling <b>time</b> <b>should</b> be 500-600 attoseconds (an attosecond is one quintillionth (1018) of a second). All that could be measured was 24 attoseconds, which is the limit of the test accuracy. Again, though, other physicists believe that tunneling experiments in which particles appear to spend anomalously short times inside the barrier are in fact fully compatible with relativity, although there is disagreement about whether the explanation involves reshaping of the wave packet or other effects.|$|E
25|$|Unaware {{that the}} Crown Prince {{did not have}} much to do with the running of Army Group Crown Prince or the 5th Army, the Deuxième Bureau offered Zelle one million francs if she could seduce him and provide France with good {{intelligence}} about German plans. The fact that the Crown Prince had, before 1914, never commanded a unit larger than a regiment, and was now supposedly commanding both an army and an army group at the same <b>time</b> <b>should</b> have been a clue that his role in German decision-making was mostly nominal. Zelle's contact with the Deuxième Bureau was Captain Georges Ladoux, who was later to emerge as one of her principal accusers.|$|E

25|$|The mode of {{inheritance}} for A-T is autosomal recessive. Each {{parent is}} a carrier, {{meaning that they}} have one normal copy of the A-T gene (ATM) and one copy which is mutated. A-T occurs if a child inherits the mutated A-T gene from each parent, so in a family with two carrier parents, there is 1 chance in 4 that a child born to the parents will have the disorder. Prenatal diagnosis (and carrier detection) {{can be carried out}} in families if the errors (mutation) in an affected child’s two ATM genes have been identified. The process of getting this done can be complicated and, as it requires <b>time,</b> <b>should</b> be arranged before conception.|$|E
25|$|The rate of a {{reaction}} is always positive. A negative sign is present {{to indicate that}} the reactant concentration is decreasing.) The IUPAC recommends that the unit of <b>time</b> <b>should</b> always be the second. The rate of reaction differs from the rate of increase of concentration of a product P by a constant factor (the reciprocal of its stoichiometric number) and for a reactant A by minus the reciprocal of the stoichiometric number. The stoichiometric numbers are included so that the defined rate is independent of which reactant or product species is chosen for measurement. For example, if a = 1 and b = 3 then B is consumed three times more rapidly than A, but v = -d/dt = -(1/3)d/dt is uniquely defined.|$|E
25|$|Horwitz summarises {{findings}} of SLA research, and applies to L2 teaching some principles of L2 acquisition honed from a vast body of relevant literature. Like Asher, Horwitz {{highlights the importance}} of naturalistic experience in L2, promoting listening and reading practice and stressing involvement in lifelike conversations. She explicitly suggests teaching practices based on these principles; ‘uch class <b>time</b> <b>should</b> be devoted to the development of listening and reading abilities’, and ‘eachers should assess student interests and supply appropriate…materials’. The ‘audio-lingual’ teaching practices {{used in the present study}} are based on principles explicated by Asher and Horwitz; listening featured heavily, closely followed by reading and speaking practice. The vocabulary items taught were deemed relevant for all learners, regardless of age, and, according to Pfeffer, they are among the most commonly used nouns in everyday German language.|$|E
