5|$|On {{his arrival}} in Cairo, Clarke began to build a network of useful contacts. He befriended Lieutenant-Colonel Raymund Maunsell, who {{operated}} Security Intelligence Middle East (SIME), the agency in charge of counter-espionage in the region. Maunsell later worked closely with Clarke, helping to feed misinformation to the enemy via double agents. Clarke's first deception was a scheme to mislead Italian forces into expecting an invasion of Italian Somaliland instead of Eritrea, the real Allied target. Operation Camilla fooled the Italian leadership completely but instead of diverting troops as the British hoped, they withdrew their forces into Eritrea. From this failure Clarke learned a first lesson, one he would teach to many other deception officers during the war: {{that the key to}} deception was not to make your enemy think what you wish but to get them <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> want.|$|E
25|$|Justice Scalia says that, {{generally}} speaking, {{the legislature}} {{has the power}} to make laws and the judiciary should only interpret the laws that are made or are explicitly in the Constitution. That is not Justice Brown's philosophy. It is simply intellectually dishonest and logically incoherent to suggest that somehow the Constitution recognizes an unlimited right <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> want with your private property and yet does not recognize a right to privacy that would forbid the Government from intruding in your bedroom. Yet {{that seems to be the}} manner in which Justice Brown would interpret our most cherished document.|$|E
500|$|... "I'm used to riding {{roughshod over}} studio executives," [...] Gilliam explained, [...] "but the Weinsteins rode roughshod over me." [...] Gilliam got so upset, filming {{was shut down}} for nearly two weeks. Matt Damon {{reflected}} on the situation: [...] "I've {{never been in a}} situation like that. Terry was spitting rage at the system, at the Weinsteins. You can't try and impose big compromises on a visionary director like him. If you try to force him <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> want creatively, he'll go nuclear." [...] The feud between Gilliam and the Weinsteins was eventually settled, although Bob Weinstein blamed the entire situation on yellow journalism. Filming was scheduled to end in October, but due to various problems during filming, principal photography did not end until the following 27 November.|$|E

Are they mad?' cried Nicholas, diving under the table, {{dragging}} up the collector by main force, and thrusting him, all doubled up, into a chair, {{as if he had}} been a stuffed figure.

500|$|Broderick's moves were choreographed by Kenny Ortega (who later choreographed Dirty Dancing). Much {{of it had}} to be {{scrapped}} {{though as}} Broderick had injured his knee badly during the scenes of running through neighbors' backyards. [...] "I was pretty sore", Broderick said. [...] "I got well enough <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> see in the parade there, but I couldn't do most of Kenny Ortega's knee spins and things like that that we had worked on. When we did shoot it, we had all this choreography and I remember John would yell with a megaphone, 'Okay, do it again, but don't do any of the choreography,' because he wanted it to be a total mess." [...] "Danke Schoen" [...] was somewhat choreographed but for [...] "Twist and Shout", Broderick said, [...] "we were just making everything up". Hughes explained that much of the scene was spontaneously filmed. [...] "It just happened that this was an actual parade, which we put our float into—unbeknownst to anybody, all the people on the reviewing stand. Nobody knew what it was, including the governor." ...|$|E
500|$|The lack of graphics, poor {{interface}} {{and controls}} {{were seen as}} {{the reasons for the}} game's difficulty. However, the reviewers also noted most of it having a role in gameplay and the argument that the text-based graphics forces players to use their own imagination, making it more engaging. Weiner wrote, [...] " [...] may not look real, but once you're hooked, it feels vast, enveloping, alive. A micro-manager's dream, the game gleefully blurs the distinction between painstaking labor and creative thrill." [...] Quintin Smith from Rock, Paper, Shotgun said, [...] "The interface has a tough job to do, bless it, but getting it <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> want is like teaching a beetle to cook." [...] Ars Technica's Casey Johnston highlighted the difficulty in performing basic actions and felt that tinkering or experimenting ended up being unproductive; she compared it to [...] "trying to build a skyscraper by banging two rocks together". She pointed out the lack of in-game tutorial and said how players can learn by themselves in other games, which are also open-ended or have intuitive mechanics, but in Dwarf Fortress, there is no autonomy [...] "even after hours" [...] of gameplay.|$|E
500|$|By 2008, Cuomo had reconsidered the album, saying: [...] "Pinkertons great. It's super-deep, brave, and authentic. Listening to it, I {{can tell}} that I was really going for it when I wrote and {{recorded}} {{a lot of those}} songs." [...] In 2010, Bell told The Aquarian Weekly: [...] "Pinkerton has definitely taken {{on a life of its}} own and became more successful and more accepted ... As an artist, you just have <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> believe in at the time, whether it’s accepted or not. You just have to keep going with it." [...] In 2015, following the Pinkerton reissue and the [...] "Memories" [...] tour, in which Weezer performed Blue and Pinkerton in their entirety, Cuomo said:The experience of learning those songs again, singing them every night, working on them with the guys, and then being in a relatively small venue with 1,000 of the most hardcore Weezer fans and hearing them sing every syllable, seeing them air-drum all the fills—it was such an amazing experience and so different from what we'd been doing the years before that ... So it was a great feeling of validation from the fans, for this album that was so personal to me and had been such a source of pain for years.|$|E

Rev. Edward Everett Hale addressed the school girls in his inimitable way, at once attractive and helpful.

2500|$|Navratilova {{said that}} the remarks {{referred}} to what she perceived as a trend of centralization of government power {{and a loss of}} personal freedom. In the discussion that followed, Chung stated: [...] "Can I be honest with you? I can tell you that when I read this, I {{have to tell you that}} I thought it was un-American, unpatriotic. I wanted to say, go back to Czechoslovakia. You know, if you don't like it here, this a country that gave you so much, gave you the freedom <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> want." ...|$|E

2500|$|After the September 11 attacks, {{a series}} of {{controversial}} military campaigns were launched, known as the War on Terror. In November 2001, shortly after the invasion of Afghanistan, the MTV Europe Music Awards were held in Frankfurt, where Gorillaz won awards for Best Song and Best Dance. As Albarn and Jamie Hewlett walked onto stage to make a speech after receiving the latter award, Albarn wore a T-shirt with the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament logo on it. In his speech, he said [...] "So, fuck the music. Listen. See this symbol here, [...] this the symbol for the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. Bombing {{one of the poorest}} countries in the world is wrong. You've got a voice and you have got <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> can about it alright?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Altman favored stories {{expressing the}} interrelationships among several characters, being more {{interested}} in character motivation than in intricate plots. He therefore tended to sketch out only a basic plot for the film, referring to the screenplay as a [...] "blueprint" [...] for action. By encouraging his actors to improvise dialogue, Altman thus became known as an [...] "actor's director," [...] a reputation that attracted many notable actors to work {{as part of his}} large casts. Performers enjoy working with Altman in part because [...] "he provides them with the freedom to develop their characters and often alter the script through improvisation and collaboration," [...] notes Derry. Richard Baskin says that [...] "Bob was rather extraordinary in his way of letting people do what they did. He trusted you <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> did and therefore you would kill for him." ...|$|E
2500|$|Smerage's mother {{learned of}} her son's {{expulsion}} {{when she opened}} Greenough's letter {{and the next day}} initiated a yearlong series of letters on his behalf. She spoke of her [...] "stricken home" [...] and her son's history of illness. Ultimately, she questioned the Court's entire approach: [...] "I feel now that you men could have done much good had you perhaps had a little less sense of justice and a little more of the spirit of Jesus in your hearts." [...] Wolff's father asked the Dean to recognize that helping his son to reform was more important than punishment: [...] "I am taking the liberty of appealing to you, not in your official capacity, but as a man, <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> can to assist him. You know all are subject to mistakes, and the blessing is in those who can aid and advise in correcting and saving rather than otherwise." ...|$|E
6000|$|The bronze {{seemed to}} deepen in the corporal's face, {{but it was}} turned {{steadily}} toward his officer. [...] "Sir," [...] he said, [...] "has that anything <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with <b>what</b> <b>you</b> were speaking of?" ...|$|R

2500|$|In 1988, {{while he}} was {{traveling}} to Philadelphia from Pakistan, Gilani was arrested by police in Frankfurt, West Germany after two kilos of heroin were found hidden in a false bottom in his suitcase. Gilani quickly made a plea deal when his case was {{handed over to the}} U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, agreeing to surrender his partners in Philadelphia in exchange for a lighter sentence. Gilani's cooperation earned him four years in prison while his two associates were sentenced to eight and ten years. At his sentencing hearing, the judge made the following statement: [...] "It's up to you, Mr. Gilani, <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> can with the rest of your life. You are still a young man. You can either take advantage of this opportunity. Your mother, your lawyer, people said some nice things about you, but what you did, not only to yourself, but to perhaps thousands, hundreds of victims, heroin users in this country is a terrible thing." ...|$|E
2500|$|At 11:00a.m. on 28 July, Austria {{declared}} war on Serbia. Following instructions from Bethmann Hollweg, von Tschirschky did not present Wilhelm’s [...] "Stop in Belgrade" [...] proposal until noon. At 1:00am on 29 July 1914 the first shots of the First World War were fired by the Austrian monitor SMS Bodrog, which bombarded Belgrade in response to Serbian sappers blowing up the railway bridge over the river Sava which linked the two countries. In Russia, partial mobilization was ordered for the four military districts bordering Austria-Hungary. Wilhelm sent a telegram to Nicholas asking for Russian support for the Austrian war against Serbia. Nicholas replied: [...] "Am glad you are back... I appeal to you to help me. An ignoble war has been declared on a weak country... Soon I shall be overwhelmed by pressure brought upon me... to take extreme measures which will lead to war. To try and avoid such as a calamity as a European war, I beg you {{in the name of}} our old friendship <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> can to stop your allies from going too far." ...|$|E
