5|$|The {{game was}} well {{received}} by gaming critics on all platforms.

5|$|Efforts to {{preserve}} {{the region as a}} national park began in the late 19thcentury, and in 1929 Grand Teton National Park was established, protecting the Teton Range's major peaks. The valley of Jackson Hole remained in private ownership until the 1930s, when conservationists led by John D. Rockefeller, Jr. began purchasing land in Jackson Hole <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>added</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> existing national park. Against public opinion and with repeated Congressional efforts to repeal the measures, much of Jackson Hole was set aside for protection as Jackson Hole National Monument in 1943. The monument was abolished in 1950 and most of the monument land was added to Grand Teton National Park.|$|E

5|$|Voice-recording {{sessions}} were supervised by Pattillo and the Andersons, with Sylvia Anderson {{in charge of}} casting. Dialogue was recorded once per month {{at a rate of}} two scripts per session. Supporting parts were not pre-assigned, but negotiated by the cast among themselves. Two recordings would be made at each session: one to be converted into electronic pulses for the puppet filming, the other <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>added</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> soundtrack during post-production. The tapes were edited at Gate Recording Theatre in Birmingham.|$|E
5|$|Along with manual exercises, several {{prominent}} automation companies attended the course. Biosearch of Novato, CA, Genetic Design of Watertown, MA, {{were two of}} several companies to demonstrate automated synthesizers at the course. Biosearch presented their new SAM I synthesizer. The Genetic Design had developed their synthesizer from the design of its sister companies (Sequemat) solid phase peptide sequencer. The Genetic Design arranged with Dr Christian Birr (Max-Planck-Institute for Medical Research) {{a week before the}} event to convert his solid phase sequencer into the semi-automated synthesizer. The team led by Dr Alex Bonner and Rick Neves converted the unit and transported it to Darmstadt for the event and installed into the Biochemistry lab at the Technische Hochschule. As the system was semi-automatic, the user injected the next base <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>added</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> growing sequence during each cycle. The system worked well and produced a series of test tubes filled with bright red trityl color indicating complete coupling at each step. This system was later fully automated by inclusion of an auto injector and was designated the Model 25A.|$|E
