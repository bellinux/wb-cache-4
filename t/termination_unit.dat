40|$|Abstract—The next digital {{subscriber}} line (DSL) generation, called G. fast, extends the frequency band up to 212 MHz and achieves Gigabit data-rates. Vectoring technology cancels the performance-limiting crosstalk among DSL lines on a signal level, but requires co-located line termination. Differently, dynamic spectrum management level 2 (DSM-L 2) coordinates the transmit power spectra among interferers and thus, does not require all line <b>termination</b> <b>units</b> to be co-located. In this work we analyze the data-rates of G. fast under full vectoring, partial vectoring restricted to groups of users, and non-vectoring scenarios. We also propose interference alignment (IA) as an alternative method to DSM-L 2 {{for dealing with the}} interference in G. fast and show that IA is superior to DSM-L 2 in non-vectoring scenarios. Furthermore, we also propose time division multiple access (TDMA) for coordination of multiple vectoring groups in partial vectoring scenarios. I...|$|R

5000|$|Each {{line module}} unit {{converts}} analogue signals from {{a maximum of}} 64 subscriber lines in the access network to the 64 kilobit/s digital binary signals used in the core network. This is done by sampling the incoming signal {{at a rate of}} 8 kS/s and coding each sample into an 8-bit word using pulse code modulation (PCM) techniques. The line module also strips out any signalling information from the subscriber line, e.g., dialled digits, and passes this to the control unit. Up to 32 line modules are connected to a digital concentrator switch unit using 2 Mbit/s paths, giving each concentrator a capacity of up to 2048 subscriber lines. The digital concentrator switch multiplexes the signals from the line modules using time-division multiplexing and concentrates the signals onto 30 time slots on up to 32-channel high speed paths for connection to the digital local switching unit via the digital line <b>termination</b> <b>units.</b> The other two time slots on each channel are used for synchronisation and signalling.|$|R

A normalised spectrum has been produced for predicting the sound power level of flow-noise produced by the strip spoilers in a rectangular air duct. The data collapse for the strip spoilers is generally good at higher Strouhal numbers, but is less efficient at lower Strouhal numbers where considerable scatter is observed.

It is found that the measured values agree well with the predicted values. The measured values are also compared with the predicted sound power levels using the generic equations given in the Appendix 5. A 2 of the CIBSE Guide. It is found that the predicted values using the generic formulae and the single normalised spectrum given in the Appendix 5. A 2 of CIBSE Guide do not agree well with the measured values, particularly at low frequencies. For very different in-duct elements, a single normalised spectrum for flow-generated noise may not be sufficient for all configurations of the in-duct elements. It is suggested that several representative normalised spectra for different types of in-duct elements should be given.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} the seroprevalence and correlates of HIV infection in a subpopulation {{of women of}} childbearing age in Montreal. DESIGN: Anonymous unlinked seroprevalence study. SETTING: Pregnancy <b>termination</b> <b>unit</b> in a teaching hospital in Montreal. PARTICIPANTS: Women presenting for abortion from July 1989 to June 1993 who resided in Quebec and were not known to have HIV infection; 12, 017 (99. 6 %) of 12, 068 eligible women were included in the study. INTERVENTION: HIV antibody testing of serum left over from samples obtained for routine Rh typing; the same algorithm as for serodiagnostic testing, namely enzyme immunoassay (EIA) followed by confirmatory testing of repeatedly EIA-reactive samples, was used. OUTCOME MEASURES: HIV serostatus by age, marital status, region of residence (metropolitan Montreal versus other), country of birth and number of living children. RESULTS: Most (84. 7 %) of the subjects resided in metropolitan Montreal. The median age was 27. 0 (range 13 to 50) years. The serum samples of 22 women were confirmed to be HIV positive, for an overall seroprevalence rate of 1. 8 per 1000 (95 % confidence interval 1. 1 to 2. 8). The seroprevalence rate did not vary significantly by age, marital status, region of residence or study year. However, it was strongly correlated with country of birth: Canada 0. 16, Haiti 23. 5, HIV-endemic countries other than Haiti 5. 3 and non-HIV-endemic countries other than Canada 0. 0 per 1000. The seroprevalence rate among women born in Haiti was 147 times higher than that among women born in Canada (p < 0. 0001). Of the women born in Haiti the rate was 3. 0 times greater among those who immigrated to Canada in 1985 or later than among those who immigrated earlier (p = 0. 047). CONCLUSIONS: The results {{of this study indicate that}} the HIV seroprevalence rate among women in Montreal is strongly associated with country of birth, women born in HIV-endemic countries, especially Haiti, having the highest rate. These results will help in the development of policies regarding HIV antibody testing and prevention of HIV transmission in Quebec...|$|E
40|$|Animals {{initiate}} behavior {{not only}} reflexively but also spontaneously {{in the absence}} of external stimuli. In vertebrates, electrophysiological data on the neuronal activity associated with the self-initiated voluntary behavior have accumulated extensively. In invertebrates, however, {{little is known about the}} neuronal basis of the spontaneous initiation of behavior. We investigated the spike activity of brain neurons at the time of spontaneous initiation of walking in the crayfish Procambarus clarkii and found neuronal signals indicative of readiness or preparatory activities in the vertebrate brain that precede the onset of voluntary actions. Those readiness discharge neurons became active > 1 s before the initiation of walking regardless of stepping direction. They remained inactive at the onset of mechanical stimulus-evoked walking in which other descending units were recruited. These results suggest that the parallel descending mechanisms from the brain separately subserve the spontaneous and stimulus-evoked walking. Electrical stimulation of these different classes of neurons caused different types of walking. In addition, we found other descending units that represented different aspects of walking, including those units that showed a sustained activity increase throughout the walking bout depending on its stepping direction, as well as one veto unit for canceling out the output effect of the readiness discharge and three <b>termination</b> <b>units</b> for stopping the walking behavior. These findings suggest that the descending activities are modularized in parallel for spontaneous initiation, continuation, and termination of walking, constituting a sequentially hierarchical control...|$|R

Materials exposed {{in the trenches}} included silts, sands, gravels of mostlyalluvial deposits and soils. Faulting was expressed in the trenches as conspicious flexures ofgeologic beds, abrupt <b>termination</b> of geologic <b>units,</b> and open tunnels that possibly formed duringfaulting. The latest faulting before the 1943 event was found in trenches A and B at Horakuji. The faulting before 1943 was inferred to have occurred between 1, 490 and 7, 970 B. P. years. The recurrence intervals for earthquakes like the 1943 Tottori earthquake along the Shikano fault isestimated to be 4, 000 - 8, 000 years. The average displacement rates for the past recent times were estimated by tectonic profiles alongthe Shikano fault. The offset of streams, ridges and geologic units suggest that the Shikano faulthas slipped 40 m right-laterally for the past 300, 000 (± 100, 000) years, indicating an average rightslip rate of 0. 1 mm/year. The maximum stream offset along the Shikano fault is 130 m. If weassume the constancy of the slip rate over the past time, the Shikano fault is inferred to haveinitiated its movement about 1 million years ago, and has a relatively low slip-rate compared withthose for active faults in the central and northern Japan. At four localities outcrops of the Shikanofault in bed rocks and overling vocalnic gravel beds of late Pliocene were found and discribed in thetext.

A detailed examination of the seismicity reveals that there are two seismic gaps that maycorrespond to the possible eastern and western ends of the Shikano-Yoshioka fault.

50|$|The taper {{design for}} {{controlling}} the sidelobe level would therefore involve only the relative unbalance Δb/bm.The transverse equivalent network is slightly {{complicated by the}} presence of two additional changes in height of the waveguide,which can be modeled by means of shunt susceptances and ideal transformers.The ideal transformer accounts for the change in the characteristic impedance, while the storing of reactive energy is taken into account through the susceptance.Scanning arrays achieve scanning in two dimensions by creating a one-dimensional phased array of leaky-wave line-source antennas. The individual line sources are scanned in elevation by varying the frequency.Scanning in the cross plane, and therefore in azimuth, is produced by phase shifters arranged in the feed structure of the one-dimensional array of line sources.The radiation will therefore occur in pencil-beam form and will scan in both elevation and azimuth in a conical-scan manner.The spacing between the line sources is chosen such that no grating lobes occur, and accurate analyses show that no blind spots appear anywhere.The described arrays have been analyzed accurately by unit-cell approach that takes into account all mutual-coupling effects.Each unit cell incorporates an individual line-source antenna, but in the presence of all the others.The radiating <b>termination</b> on the <b>unit</b> cell modifies the transverse equivalent network.A key new feature of the array analysis is therefore the determination of the active admittance of the unit cell in the two-dimensional environment as a function of scan angle.If the values of β and α did not change with phase shift, the scan would be exactly conical.However, it is found that these values change only a little, so that the deviation from conical scan is small.We next consider whether or not blind spots are present.Blind spots refer to angles at which the array cannot radiate or receive any power; if a blind spot occurred at some angle, therefore, the value of α would rapidly go to zero at that scan angle.To check for blind spots, we would then look for any sharp dips in the curves of α/k0 as a function of scan angle. No such dips were ever found.Typical data of this type exhibit fairly flat behavior for α/k0 until the curves drop quickly to zero as they reach the end of the conical-scan range, where the beam hits the ground.|$|R
