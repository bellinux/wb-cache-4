[...] Randolph hoped such a display would induce New England to submit to revisions of their charter from the Crown, rather than having it fully revoked. On August 3, 1683, Randolph wrote to Sir Leonine Jenkins, [...] "I am now informed that the H.M.S. Rose is already fitted out for the Bahamas with orders to call at Boston for 2 or 3 weeks on the way." [...] Randolph indicates that <b>time</b> <b>is</b> <b>of</b> the essence and he is willing to travel with Phips or forego the frigate idea and embark on a merchantman. Randolph, along with his brother Bernard, were given passage and cabins on HMS Rose.|$|E
500|$|The Enterprise {{arrives at}} the planet Angel One, where its native {{population}} is run as an oligarchy, with women in the dominant position of power. The ship is looking for survivors from the shipwrecked freighter Odin, 7+ years after having been evacuated. The freighter was missing 3 escape pods and the only planet in range was Angel One. An away team consisting of Commander William Riker (Jonathan Frakes), Lt. Commander Data (Brent Spiner), Lt. Tasha Yar (Denise Crosby), and Counselor Deanna Troi (Marina Sirtis) beam down to the surface. They attempt to negotiate with Beata (Karen Montgomery), the [...] "Elected One" [...] of the native inhabitants, to let them search for the survivors. <b>Time</b> <b>is</b> <b>of</b> the essence however, as the Enterprise must travel to a Federation outpost near the Romulan Neutral Zone (where a group of Romulan Battlecruisers has been detected) {{as soon as they}} resolve their investigation into the Odin survivors.|$|E
500|$|The Jesuit critic William F. Lynch, who {{believed}} that salvation happens within time and not outside of it, explained what Eliot was attempting {{to do in the}} Four Quartets when he wrote: [...] "it is hard to say no to the impression, if I may use a mixture of my own symbols and his, that the Christian imagination is finally limited to the element of fire, to the day of Pentecost, to the descent of the Holy Ghost upon the disciples. The revelation of eternity and <b>time</b> <b>is</b> <b>of</b> an intersection ... It seems not unseemly to suppose that Eliot's imagination (and is this not a theology?) is alive with points of intersection and of descent." [...] He continued with a focus on how time operated within the poem: [...] "He seems to place our faith, our hope, and our love, not in the flux of time but in the points of time. I am sure his mind is interested in the line and time of Christ, whose Spirit is his total flux. But I am not so sure about his imagination. Is it or is it not an imagination which is saved from time's nausea or terror by points of intersection? ... There seems little doubt that Eliot is attracted above all by the image and the goal of immobility, and that in everything he seeks for approximations to this goal in the human order." [...] Lynch went on to point out that this understanding of time includes Asian influences.|$|E

2500|$|Seth, Divya, and Nimali Singh {{published}} research evidence linking {{a wide range}} of health risks and overworking. The article argued that <b>time</b> <b>is</b> <b>of</b> the essence; in short time is a necessity for an individual's health whether the subject is behavior, vising the doctor’s office, and essential care. There is a direct correlation with stress and has been the cause for 24% of cardiovascular disease cases including strokes and heart attacks. Although both men and women experience shortcomings with health, the final reports stated that women, with the double burden of domestic and paid work experience an increased the risk of psychological distress and suboptimal health. Strazdins concluded that negative work-family spillover especially is associated with health problems among both women and men, and negative family-work spillover is related to a poorer health status among women." ...|$|E

They also used torture on the leading democrats before the democratic march, such as keeping an elderly democrat awake all night and then releasing him without charge, knowing he would have to march all day the following day and making severe threats to another involving his young children.|$|E
