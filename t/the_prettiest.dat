5|$|Charlie is {{accepted}} by Sam and Patrick's {{group of friends}} and begins experimenting with tobacco, alcohol and other drugs. At a party Charlie trips on LSD. He cannot control his flashbacks of Aunt Helen, {{who died in a}} car crash on her way to buy him a birthday gift. He ends up in the hospital after falling asleep in the snow. At a regular Rocky Horror Picture Show performance, Charlie is asked to fill in as Rocky for Sam's boyfriend Craig, who is unavailable. Their friend Mary Elizabeth is impressed and asks Charlie to the Sadie Hawkins dance and they enter into a desultory relationship. The relationship ends, however, during a game of truth or dare when Charlie is dared to kiss <b>the</b> <b>prettiest</b> girl in the room. He kisses Sam, and Mary Elizabeth storms out of the room in response. Following this, Patrick suggests that Charlie stay away from Sam for a while, {{and the rest of the}} friend group shuns him. His flashbacks of Aunt Helen return.|$|E
5|$|Such {{treatment}} of the Christians for refusals by the girls is also confirmed in the accounts of British officer James Scurry, who was held captive along with the Mangalorean Catholics. In his book The Captivity, Sufferings, and Escape of James Scurry, who was Detained a Prisoner During Ten Years, in the Dominions of Hyder Ali and Tippoo Saib (1824), Scurry also reports that Tipu relented on his demand for captive girls, after one captive fell from her beast and expired on the spot through loss of blood. About 200 young women, <b>the</b> <b>prettiest</b> and fairest, were selected for Tipu's seraglio. The rest {{of the women were}} distributed as wives to Muslim officers and favourites living there. The future Christian progeny of these young girls and women were lost, and their descendants are fully Islamic as of today.|$|E

25|$|Richard Abanes {{argues that}} {{polygamy}} {{may have caused}} a shortage of brides in the early Mormon community. The New York Times reported in 1860 that apostle Heber C. Kimball stated (in an address to departing missionaries): Brethren, I {{want you to understand}} that it is not to be as it has been heretofore.

25|$|Galitsky's {{followers}} sing his praise. Skula and Yeroshka are {{now working}} as gudok-players. They entertain the followers and all sing of how Galitsky and his men abducted a young woman and how she pleaded {{to be allowed to}} return to her father without being dishonoured. The prince arrives and sings of how, if he were Prince of Putivl, he would drink and feast all day while dispensing judgment and have <b>the</b> <b>prettiest</b> maidens with him all night (Galitsky's Song). The treasury would be spent on himself and his men while his sister would be praying in a monastery. A group of young women beg the prince to restore their abducted friend. He threatens them and drives them away, saying how she now lives in luxury in his quarters and does not have to work. The prince returns to his rooms having sent for wine for his followers. The gudok players and the prince's followers mock the women. They wonder what might happen if Yaroslavna hears of what happens, but then realise she would be helpless with all her men gone to war. They sing of how they are all drunkards and are supported by Galitsky. The men decide to go to the town square to declare Galitsky the Prince of Putivl, leaving just the two drunk musicians behind.|$|E

60|$|Envy of the {{fortunate}} Lizzie did not long possess Charlotte's mind, however, {{for that very}} day a wonderful thing happened at noon hour by the northwest gap. Charlotte had always been {{very careful not to}} let <b>the</b> <b>Pretty</b> Lady see her, but today, after <b>the</b> <b>Pretty</b> Lady had gone past, Charlotte leaned out of the gap to watch her as far as she could. And just at that very moment <b>the</b> <b>Pretty</b> Lady looked back; and there, peering at her from the asylum fence, was a little scrap of a girl, with mouse-coloured hair and big freckles, and the sweetest, brightest, most winsome little face <b>the</b> <b>Pretty</b> Lady had ever seen. <b>The</b> <b>Pretty</b> Lady smiled right down at Charlotte and for just a moment her eyes looked as Charlotte had always known they ought to look. Charlotte was feeling rather frightened down in her heart but she smiled bravely back.|$|R

She described it following a visit in 1895: [...] "The garden is very large, two-thirds surrounded by a red brick wall with many apricots, and an inner circle of old grey apple trees on espaliers. It is very productive but not tidy, <b>the</b> <b>prettiest</b> kind of garden, where bright old-fashioned flowers grow amongst the currant bushes." [...] Early in 1909 she wrote to her publisher, [...] "I have done lots of sketches [...] not all to the purpose [...] and will now endeavour to finish up the F. Bunnies without further delay." ...|$|E

500|$|In Project Sylpheed, starfighters and {{missiles}} leave colorful contrails {{in their wake}} as they move through the void of space, and explode into fireballs when destroyed. [...] The graphics impressed several critics; in his article for Play magazine, Dave Halverson called the game [...] "by far <b>the</b> <b>prettiest</b> free-roaming shooter ever created". [...] Other reviewers felt the effects were not outstanding; IGN's Erik Brudvig said the explosions looked like [...] "bloody snot". [...] Finding the maelstrom of color contrails distracting, Justin Hoeger wrote in his article for The Sacramento Bee that he was dogfighting [...] "garish, neon-colored contrails" [...] instead of enemy fighters, a sentiment shared by several others. [...] Will Freeman of Videogamer.com, however, appreciated the contrails for filling the emptiness of space with [...] "tangled webs of gently shimmering blue and red" [...] and found them useful as [...] "a way of tracking [...] enemies".|$|E
500|$|The two {{managers}} have [...] "exchanged some of football's best and bitterest verbal swipes," [...] according to The Daily Telegraph.

Author and Des Moines native Bill Bryson commented on how Merle Hay Mall's opening changed Des Moines in his 2006 memoir The Life and Times of the Thunderbolt Kid: [...] "My father never shopped anywhere else after that. Neither did most people. By the early 1960s, people exchanged boasts about how long it had been since they had been downtown. They had found a new kind of happiness at the malls." [...] In 1989's , Bryson wrote that [...] "Jack Kerouac, of all people, thought that Iowa women were <b>the</b> <b>prettiest</b> in the country, but I don't think he ever went to Merle Hay Mall on a Saturday" [...] when he commented on the obesity of Iowa women.|$|E
500|$|The game's visuals were {{a source}} of {{disagreement}} between some critics. Extended Play's Matthew Keil wrote that the game's visuals are the [...] "most notable improvement" [...] over Rogue Squadron.

[...] Both Keil and Mirabella praised the game for being less dependent on distance fog and [...] "vastly" [...] improving the draw distance over Rogue Squadron. Davis, however, wrote that [...] "the graphics in Battle for Naboo are exactly the same as those of Rogue Squadron, flaws and all", and Nintendo Powers Andy Meyers cited [...] "drab backgrounds and dry cinemas". EGM enjoyed the game's models and lighting, but thought the environments looked [...] "blurry". Reviewers' opinions on the game's music and sound effects were generally less divided. Keil stated that the game showcases Factor 5's audio talents, and Mirabella and Davis described the audio as [...] "atmospheric" [...] and [...] "immersive", respectively. [...] One EGM reviewer lamented [...] "the low-quality cartridge EpisodeI music", but another thought the sound was impressive.|$|E
500|$|The {{most recent}} {{meeting between the}} two teams was in the Premier League on Boxing Day, when Arsenal came from behind to beat Chelsea. Arsenal were unbeaten {{domestically}} since December 2001 and on course to complete their first league and cup double in four years. Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger was buoyant his team would complete the task on hand: [...] "We have been facing cup games in the league every week {{for a long time}} and this is just another. Chelsea will be a difficult team to beat if they are at their best on Saturday, but such is the confidence in this squad, we just feel we can win every game." [...] When asked what he made of Sir Alex Ferguson's comments that Manchester United played the best football in England, Wenger retorted: [...] "What do you want me to say?

[...] The Arsenal manager was undecided whether to drop Richard Wright who started in every round of the FA Cup for David Seaman and to recall Sol Campbell who recovered from a hamstring injury.|$|E
