5|$|Despite Mihardja's {{insistence that}} Atheis {{is meant to}} be realistic, several {{symbolic}} interpretations have been put forward. According to Mihardja, {{one of the most common}} interpretations readers conveyed to him was that Hasan's death symbolised atheism defeating religion, with Hasan's death as the death of theism. According to Maier, Atheis serves as an allegory for the development of the Indonesian nation. Hasan, representing traditionalism, is killed by the Japanese, who changed the status quo when they invaded in 1942. Meanwhile, the anarchistic Anwar finds himself without a place in the modern world.

5|$|In 1881, Nielsen {{began to}} take his violin playing more seriously, {{studying}} privately under Carl Larsen, the sexton at Odense Cathedral.
