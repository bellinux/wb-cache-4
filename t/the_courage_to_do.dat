5|$|School Rumble is {{a romantic}} shōnen comedy {{revolving}} around {{the daily lives}} of the students of Class 2-C at the fictional Yagami High School, along with their friends and families. The main female protagonist is Tenma Tsukamoto, an unremarkable second-year high school student who secretly admires her eccentric, enigmatic, nice-guy classmate, Oji Karasuma. Tenma struggles to confess her feelings to Karasuma. He remains oblivious to her interest, instead seeking fulfillment by indulging in curry. The main male protagonist, delinquent Kenji Harima, similarly yearns for Tenma, attending school solely to be near her. Like Tenma, Harima has difficulty declaring his love, and whenever he summons <b>the</b> <b>courage</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so, circumstances conspire against him.|$|E

The fact that five little kids, {{in the mouth of}} the wolf, where it really counted, had <b>the</b> tremendous <b>courage</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> what they <b>did,</b> is spectacular <b>to</b> me. I know that the world is better for them having been there, but I do not know why." ...|$|R

But now, he says, after more than forty years, he finally found <b>the</b> <b>courage</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it. With this we see him jump from an airplane and descend to earth with a parachute.|$|E
500|$|In an interview, Lee told MTV News {{that she}} pushed her own limits, doing things she didn't have <b>the</b> <b>courage</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> {{in the making of}} Fallen. She told The Sun the main themes of The Open Door are freedom and her {{personal}} life. The lyrics delve on [...] "what was going on at the time" [...] in her life and about [...] "the experimenting and fun stuff" [...] the band tried on The Open Door. Lee described the songs on the album as [...] "very dark", and said they show how to pass the tough moments in life. When comparing the songs with the material from the group's previous album Fallen, she described them as [...] " [...] very different. The chords are still there but it's just a more mature version." [...] She also said her goal was to make a record that she loved even more than Fallen, rather than to copy the formula which made the previous record successful. Incorporating classical influences and several new elements in the music, [...] the sound of the record was inspired by the works of Portishead and Björk.|$|E

She'd {{probably}} wear one of those horrid she-helmets, because she'd want <b>the</b> <b>courage</b> not <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so; but she'd wear it with a heart longing for the time when she might be allowed to throw it off. I hate such shallow false pretences. For my part I would let the world say what it pleased, and show no grief if I felt none--and perhaps not, if I did." ...|$|R
40|$|President Putin {{has chosen}} to {{escalate}} the conflict in south-eastern Ukraine, thereby ignoring both the sanctions and the diplomatic advances of the EU and its partners in response to Russia’s belligerence towards its neighbour {{over the last six}} months. Ahead of the NATO Summit in Wales on September 4 - 5, calls are growing for EU member states to provide arms and more intelligence to Ukraine’s beleaguered army. But it is far from certain that the EU will summon up <b>the</b> collective <b>courage</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so. Beyond sanctions, what other options does the EU have to alter the Kremlin’s calculus...|$|R
40|$|Ethical {{leadership}} and a values-based culture should be {{two sides of}} the same coin in intercollegiate athletics. Needed are ethical leaders serving as role models of integrity, trustworthiness, honesty, fairness, and respect for others. Ethical leaders model how values should guide actions and decisions as well as implement reward systems that hold others accountable for ethical conduct. Athletic directors and other athletic administrators with <b>the</b> moral <b>courage</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> what is right regardless of circumstances can nurture values-based cultures as they shape and develop the lives of athletes and colleagues they influence. The purposes of this theoretical work are to explicate ethical leadership, explain the connection between ethical {{leadership and}} a values-based culture, and propose a model for developing and sustaining ethical leadership in a values-based culture...|$|R
500|$|Meyer {{has been}} {{particularly}} well received by female Holby City fans, elevating Irving to sex-symbol status. The Dail Mail Lynda Lee-Potter described him as [...] "devastatingly attractive, brusque and autocratic" [...] and [...] "the kind of domineering, unsmiling hero who made Mills & Boon heroines swoon." [...] Irving {{felt that this was}} [...] "fairly predictable in terms of the nature of Meyer–tough and masterful–combined with the aphrodisiac of power, and the life and death aspects of his job." [...] He commented that he was surprised by the positive reaction to his character, explaining: [...] "He seems to have captured people's imaginations, but it's difficult to put your finger on what he has. I think it's got something to do with being a character who says exactly what he means all the time. He's got integrity, which I admire anyway, and I expect the audience responds to that. Surgeons seem to like him too. I find that particularly gratifying. He's got <b>the</b> <b>courage</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> what's right for his work and his patients and not worry about popularity or being liked." [...] Conversely, Irving noted that after assuming the role, members of the public would sometimes [...] "give a kind of shudder" [...] upon encountering him, associating him with his character.|$|E
2500|$|Probably {{a hundred}} men in Congress {{would have liked}} to do what she did. [...] Not one of them had <b>the</b> <b>courage</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it. [...] The Gazette entirely disagrees with the wisdom of her position. [...] But Lord, it was a brave thing! [...] And its bravery someway {{discounted}} its folly. [...] When, in a hundred years from now, courage, sheer courage based upon moral indignation is celebrated in this country, the name of Jeannette Rankin, who stood firm in folly for her faith, will be written in monumental bronze, not for what she did, but for the way she did it.|$|E
2500|$|Convergence Theory - {{whereas the}} Contagion Theory states that crowds {{cause people to}} act in a certain way, Convergence theory states that people who want to act in [...] a certain way come {{together}} to form crowds. Developed by Floyd Allport (1924) and later expanded upon by Neil Miller and John Dollard (1941) as [...] "Learning Theory," [...] the central argument of all convergence theories is that collective behavior reveals the otherwise hidden tendencies of the individuals who take part in the episode. It asserts that people with similar attributes find other like-minded persons with whom they can release these underlying tendencies. People sometimes do things in a crowd that they would not have <b>the</b> <b>courage</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> alone because crowds can diffuse responsibility but the behavior itself is claimed to originate within the individuals. Crowds, in addition, can intensify a sentiment simply by creating a critical mass of like-minded people.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Sewell, {{recovering}} from the first confusion which his wife's unexpected difference of opinion had thrown him into, [...] "I should {{think that was the}} very best reason in the world why he should leave her. Would his marrying make matters worse or better if he were tired of her? As for wickedness, I should feel myself guilty if I did not <b>do</b> my utmost <b>to</b> prevent marriages between people when one or other wished to break their engagement, and had not <b>the</b> moral <b>courage</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so. There is no more pernicious delusion than that one's word ought to be kept in such an affair, after the heart has gone out of it, simply because it's been given." ...|$|R
5000|$|Gouldman {{cited the}} Beatles as his influence, [...] "We {{went down to}} Denmark Street and went round all the {{publishers}} {{trying to find a}} song ... we didn't get any songs that we liked or we weren't given any songs period and the Beatles had started and I thought 'well, I’m gonna really have a crack at song-writing.' I had dabbled a bit, but they were really my inspiration and gave me and I think {{a lot of other people}} <b>the</b> <b>courage</b> <b>to</b> actually <b>do</b> it. We all wanted to be like the Beatles. I wrote two songs and the record company we were with turned down one of the songs. The song they turned down was 'For Your Love', which eventually found its way to the Yardbirds." ...|$|R
5000|$|When I hear nutcases like Glenn Gould who do: staccato {{version of}} J.S. Bach's, I say he {{understood}} nothing of Bach's music! I've listened carefully to his records: he didn't understand. He was very brilliant; I respect {{him up to}} a certain point. For me, the fact that an artist doesn't appear in public poses a problem. But at least he was a guy with <b>the</b> <b>courage</b> not <b>to</b> <b>do</b> things like other people. All the same, he was wide off the mark, so wide off the mark that you'd need a 747 to bring him back. I'm hard on Glenn Gould. Well, he's dead now, so I won't attack a colleague.|$|R
2500|$|In August 2015, Eno {{endorsed}} Jeremy Corbyn's {{campaign in}} the Labour Party leadership election. He said: [...] "I don't think electability really {{is the most important}} thing. What's important is that someone changes the conversation and moves us off this small-minded agenda." [...] He wrote in The Guardian: [...] "By gathering this level of support Jeremy Corbyn has already shown that there is a strong nascent progressive movement in this country. He's shown the others in his party that there's a well of commitment for them to tap, if they have the will and <b>the</b> <b>courage</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it. If nothing further happens with his campaign, that would be an undeniable and valuable contribution. I admit it: PM Corbyn is a long shot right now – but only four weeks ago bookies were giving 100-1 against him even becoming the candidate. Now it's 7-4 on. Things can change, and quickly. I think we should have some faith and give it a try." ...|$|E

The actress has commented that this [...] "tore [...] to pieces", and [...] "I can't begin to tell you how much I regret his not being around". She added, [...] "At the same time, it's possible that were he still alive I might never have had <b>the</b> space or <b>courage</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> what I've done ...

5000|$|... "I Feed You My Love" [...] is an {{electronic}} and electropop song written in B minor {{and set in}} common time. The song has a sparse arrangement over lush strings and starts with a dark electroclash riff that contrasts with Berger’s delicate vocals. The introduction of drums halfway through the first verse and synthesized strings during the chorus help provide build. According to lyricist Karin Park, the song is [...] "about having <b>the</b> <b>courage</b> and strength <b>to</b> <b>do</b> what you want".|$|R
50|$|The Vietnamization policy {{achieved}} limited rollback of Communist gains inside South Vietnam only, and {{was primarily}} aimed at providing the arms, training and {{funding for the}} South to fight and win its own war, if it had <b>the</b> <b>courage</b> and commitment <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so. By 1971, the Communists lost control of most, but not all, of the areas they had controlled in the South in 1967. The Communists still controlled many remote jungle and mountain districts, especially areas that protected the Ho Chi Minh Trail.|$|R

5000|$|Maddi (2006) defines {{hardiness}} as {{a combination}} of attitudes that provide <b>the</b> <b>courage</b> and motivation <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> hard, strategic work of turning stressful circumstances from potential disasters into growth opportunities. [...] While grit is primarily a measure of an individual's ability to persist in obtaining a specific goal over an extended time period (Duckworth et al., 2007), hardiness refers to an individual's ability to persist through difficult circumstances and {{does not address the}} individual's long term persistence toward a specific goal. [...] Maddi (2006) developed a theoretical model of hardiness as a tool for developing resilience.|$|R
