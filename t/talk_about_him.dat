25|$|Menzies {{heard of}} Chifley's demise while {{attending}} a parliamentary ball at King's Hall in Parliament House {{to celebrate the}} 50th Jubilee of Federation (Chifley was invited but had declined to attend). Menzies was deeply distressed and abandoned his normally impassive demeanour to announce in a halting subdued voice:It is my very sorrowful duty during this celebration tonight {{to tell you that}} Mr Chifley has died. I don't want to try to <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>him</b> now because, although we were political opponents, he was a friend of mine and yours, and a fine Australian. You will all agree that in the circumstances the festivities should end. It doesn't matter about party politics on an occasion such as this. Oddly enough, in Parliament we get on very well. We sometimes find we have the warmest friendships among people whose politics are not ours. Mr Chifley served this country magnificently for years.|$|E

Texas musician Doug Sahm wrote a song entitled [...] "Louis Riel," [...] which appeared on the album S.D.Q. '98. In the song, Sahm likens the lore surrounding Riel to David Crockett's legend in his home state, spinning an abridged tale of Riel's life as a revolutionary: [...] "...but you gotta respect {{him for what he}} thought was right...

500|$|Feller again led {{the majors}} in wins (25), strikeouts (260), innings pitched (343), and walks (194) for the 1941 season. His six shutouts were an AL-best on the season. That year, Joe DiMaggio talked about Feller's {{pitching}} ability, stating [...] "I don't think anyone {{is ever going}} to throw a ball faster than he does. And his curveball isn't human." [...] Feller appeared in the May 12, 1941, edition of Life, which said: [...] "...he is unquestionably the idol of several generations of Americans, ranging in age from 7 to 70. They represent of city, town, and village in the land, speak of him familiarly as 'Bob', and <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>him</b> by the hour, with enthusiasm." ...|$|E
500|$|Press in Europe {{ranged from}} mixed to negative. The press in Germany {{did not like}} the film. At the Berlin premiere, a writer for The New York Times wrote [...] "Whatever you think of the {{director}} Charles [...] Theodor Dreyer, there is no denying that he is 'different.' He does things that make people <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>him.</b> You may find his films ridiculous—but you won't forget them...Although in many ways [...] {{was one of the worst}} films I have ever attended, there were some scenes in it that gripped with brutal directness". Press reaction to the film in Paris was mixed. Reporter Herbert Matthews of The New York Times wrote that Vampyr was [...] "a hallucinating film", that [...] "either held the spectators spellbound as in a long nightmare or else moved them to hysterical laughter". For many years after Vampyrs initial release, the film was viewed by critics as one of Dreyer's weaker works.|$|E
500|$|Stengel {{has been}} praised {{for his role}} in {{successfully}} launching the Mets. Appel deemed the Mets' beginnings unique, as later expansion teams have been given better players to begin with, [...] "few expansion teams in any sport have tried the formula—a quotable, fan-popular man who would charm the press and deflect attention away from ineptness on the field." [...] Arthur Daley of The New York Times wrote, [...] "he gave the Mets the momentum they needed when they needed it most. He was the booster that got them off the ground and on their journey. The smoke screen he generated to accompany the blast-off obscured the flaws and gave the Mets an acceptance and a following they could not have obtained without him." [...] James wrote, [...] "Stengel became such a giant character that you really can't <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>him</b> in the past. He became an enduring part of the game." [...] Commissioner William Eckert said of Stengel, [...] "he's probably done more for baseball than anyone." ...|$|E

500|$|Initially, Horner is {{confident}} that he can seek out the married women {{who are willing to}} have affairs because {{they are the ones who}} do not care about their honor. Horner seems to believe he is in a position of power over the women because their extramarital affair is with him, but his power wanes during the duration of the play. In Act 5, Scene 4, Lady Fidget, Dainty Fidget, and Mistress Squeamish barge into Horner’s lodgings despite his protest, conveying “his lower position that alludes to his disguise: a lowly eunuch.” [...] They <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>him</b> as if he was not present, referring to him as a ‘beast,’ ‘toad,’ and eunuch. Cohen says, “As the ladies grow in aggressive self-confidence, Lady Fidget also ‘claps him on the back’ thereby revealing the altered socio-sexual roles that are now presented.” [...] While Horner thinks he is manipulating the women, he has “exhausted his sexual resources and has, in reality, become that impotent and useless object with the world publicly recognizes him to be.” [...] Horner’s true power is not in relationship to the women, but to the men. He shows his dominance over the men he cuckolds.|$|E

2500|$|Gwynn and Clark {{said they}} could {{continue}} to play together, but Clark signed with the Boston Red Sox {{as a free agent}} in the offseason. Gwynn felt appreciated after he was signed to a three-year contract extension for $12.25 million, including a $1 million signing bonus. McKeon praised Gwynn, saying, [...] "He's one of the most unselfish players I've ever managed. In '89, when he was going for a batting title, he was giving himself up to move runners along." [...] Dick Williams, who managed Gwynn from 1982 through 1985, said of Gwynn, [...] "I don't think I've ever had a player who worked harder, cared more and was more deserving of his awards." [...] Clark continued to criticize him, which Gwynn attributed to jealousy. Gwynn responded with his own criticism of Clark: [...] "Let's <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>him</b> walking 104 times, being a No. 4 hitter. Let's talk about his not flying on team flights. Let's <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>him</b> getting booted out of games on a called strike three." [...] In 1992, Gwynn sympathized with Clark, who filed for bankruptcy after bad loans by his agent. [...] "I really appreciated the things Tony said about my situation", Clark said.|$|E

Ane died on 31 July 1834, age 66, possibly from typhus. His father died on 8 August 1838, age 82. On 11 August, Kierkegaard wrote: [...] "My father died on Wednesday (the 8th) at 2:00a.m. I so deeply desired {{that he might have}} lived a few years more... Right now I feel there is only one person (E. Boesen) with whom I can really <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>him.</b> He was a 'faithful friend.'" [...] Troels Frederik Lund, his nephew, was instrumental in providing biographers with much information regarding Søren Kierkegaard. Lund was a good friend of Georg Brandes and Julius Lange.|$|E
2500|$|Hughes {{struggled}} against New Zealand in 1980–81, making only 102 runs {{at an average}} of 27.25 in three Tests. Rumours about Hughes' selection prospects again began to circulate. While Hughes was batting in the traditional Australia Day Test in Adelaide, this time against India, later that summer, his nemesis Ian Chappell opined on the airwaves that [...] "Hughes really does need to build up a big score here. People are starting to <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>him</b> being dropped." [...] In seeming response to this criticism, Hughes scored a double-century; 213 runs including 21 boundaries. A [...] "magnificent innings" [...] Wisden declared, adding that Hughes' batting [...] "touched the heights" [...] and that [...] "ith brilliant footwork, he scored freely off the spinners."

2500|$|In Mariano Azuela's novel The Underdogs, anti-federal {{soldiers}} <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>him</b> as an {{archetype of}} an anti-authoritarian bandit: [...] "Villa, indomitable {{lord of the}} sierra, the eternal victim of all governments... Villa tracked, hunted down like a wild beast... Villa the reincarnation of the old legend; Villa as Providence, the bandit, that passes through the world armed with the blazing torch of an ideal: to rob the rich and give to the poor. It was the poor who built up and imposed a legend about him which Time itself was to increase and embellish as a shining example from generation to generation." [...] However, a little later, one character distrusts the rumors: [...] "Anastasio Montañéz questioned the speaker more particularly. It {{was not long before}} he realized that all this high praise was hearsay and that not a single man in Natera's army had ever laid eyes on Villa." ...|$|E

In , Sayaka Aoki, while displaying only part of his name, said [...] "I put a camera in the chest drawer", which caused a general laugh.

2500|$|Waldock {{was educated}} at Uppingham School and from 1918 was at Hertford College, Oxford. As a cricketer, {{he was a}} left-handed middle-order batsman and a slow left-arm {{orthodox}} spin bowler. With county cricket resuming after the First World War in a fairly ad hoc manner in the 1919 season, Oxford University's first-class fixtures that year were largely against scratch teams of amateur cricketers, and Waldock was a regular player for the university side throughout. In the match against the MCC at Oxford, he made 85, and this would remain the highest score of his first-class career. The game just before the 1919 University Match was against a side raised by H. D. G. Leveson Gower at Eastbourne; Waldock took seven first-innings wickets for 46 runs and then scored 80 of a first-wicket partnership of 166 with Miles Howell. Waldock was awarded his cricket blue and was also elected secretary for the 1920 Oxford season; in its notes on the 1919 Oxford season, Wisden Cricketers' Almanack said that [...] "Waldock did so well... that people began to <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>him</b> as the coming left-hand bat".|$|E
2500|$|From that {{statement}} of March 1834, {{it does not}} appear that animosity still existed on the composer's part. Through an intermediary, Bordesi (or Bordese), a mutual friend of both men, Romani initially expressed interest in re-establishing friendly relations with Bellini. Thus, Bellini wrote back to the intermediary stating: [...] "Tell my dear Romani that I still love him even though he is a cruel man" [...] and he continues by wondering if Romani ever thinks about him where he, Bellini, says [...] "whereas I do nothing but to <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>him</b> to the entire universe". Then he ends with: [...] "Give him a kiss for me". This was followed by a letter to Florimo in late May where Bellini wishes to know if Romani reciprocated his feelings, which—it appears—did happen when he writes to Romani himself (most likely expansion of the initial draft) laying out a series of concerns, but quoting back to him a part of his own letter to Bordese in which Romani states [...] "I have not ceased to love him , for I recognise that the blame is not all his".|$|E
