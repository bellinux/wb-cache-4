When they face-off at the Vatos' base, they discover it is a hidden nursing home, and the Vatos are only trying to protect <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>family.</b> Rick leaves some of his weapons and ammo for the Vatos, and Glenn is returned unharmed. Rick's group finds their vehicle missing, and suspect Merle took it seeking vengeance on the survivors', and they start to race on foot back to the camp.|$|E

While in Edinburgh Sarah {{had given birth to}} Henrietta on 19 July 1681 (O.S.). Another daughter, Anne, arrived in 1684, followed by John in 1686, Elizabeth in 1687, Mary in 1689, and Charles in 1690 who lived for only two years.|$|E
5|$|The emu {{was long}} classified, with its closest {{relatives}} the cassowaries, {{in the family}} Casuariidae, part of the ratite order Struthioniformes. However, an alternate classification was proposed in 2014 by Mitchell et al., based on analysis of mitochondrial DNA. This splits off the Casuariidae into their own order, the Casuariformes, and includes only the cassowaries in the family Casuariidae, placing the emus in <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>family,</b> Dromaiidae. The cladogram shown below is from their study.|$|E

5|$|The Skagen Painters were {{a close-knit}} group of mainly Danish artists who {{gathered}} each summer {{from the late}} 1870s in the fishing village of Skagen in the far north of Jutland, painting the local fishermen and <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>family</b> life and celebrations. Peder Severin Krøyer (1851–1909), {{who was born in}} Stavanger, Norway, but brought up in Copenhagen, first arrived in Skagen in 1882 and returned almost every summer. He had already gained a reputation for his paintings of the fishermen in Hornbæk on the north coast of Zealand and had been influenced by the Impressionist movement during his travels to France. In Skagen, {{he became one of the}} central and most enthusiastic members of the artistic community.|$|E
5|$|Every Deshastha {{family has}} <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>family</b> patron deity or the Kuladaivat. This deity {{is common to}} a lineage or a clan of several {{families}} who are connected to each other through a common ancestor. The Khandoba of Jejuri {{is an example of}} a Kuladaivat of some Maharashtrian Deshastha families; he is a common Kuladaivat to several castes ranging from Brahmins to Dalits. The practice of worshiping local or territorial deities as Kuladaivats began in the period of the Yadava dynasty. Other family deities of the people of Maharashtra are Bhavani of Tuljapur, Mahalaxmi of Kolhapur, Mahalaxmi of Amravati, Renuka of Mahur, Parashuram in Konkan, Saptashringi on Saptashringa hill at Vani in Nasik district. Despite being the most popular deity amongst Deshastha and other Marathi people, very few families regard Vitthal or other popular Avatars of Vishnu such as Rama or Krishna as their Kuldaivat, with Balaji being an exception.|$|E
5|$|The {{capybara}} and {{the lesser}} capybara {{belong to the}} subfamily Hydrochoerinae along with the rock cavies. The living capybaras and their extinct relatives were previously classified in <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>family</b> Hydrochoeridae. Since 2002, molecular phylogenetic studies have recognized a close relationship between Hydrochoerus and Kerodon, the rock cavies, supporting placement of both genera in a subfamily of Caviidae. Paleontological classifications have yet to incorporate this new taxonomy and continue to use Hydrochoeridae for all capybaras, while using Hydrochoerinae for the living genus and its closest fossil relatives, such as Neochoerus. The taxonomy of fossil hydrochoerines is also {{in a state of}} flux. In recent years, the diversity of fossil hydrochoerines has been substantially reduced. This is largely due to the recognition that capybara molar teeth show strong variation in shape over the life of an individual. In one instance, material once referred to four genera and seven species on the basis of differences in molar shape is now thought to represent differently aged individuals of a single species, Cardiatherium paranense.|$|E

40|$|Some {{historians have}} classed as {{servants}} only {{people living with}} their masters; some have excluded farm servants; some have included married domestics living with <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>families.</b> The archive of the Bolognese Confraternity of San Vitale, also known as Università dei Servitori, is analyzed in this article to show how one group of servants defined a “true” servant. Their solution was to exclude from their association people who performed what they deemed “filthy” tasks. They also excluded women, giving us a particular insight {{in the history of}} gender and masculinity. In their view, the “true” servants were bourgeois (and locally born) men rather than lower class (migrant) women who are often identified as the stereotypical servants. Moreover, most members of the association were married, they had <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>families</b> in Bologna and did not always live with their masters. This makes possible the analysis of married male servants living with <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>families,</b> a category of servant that has received less attention than life-cycle servants...|$|R
25|$|Secular Franciscans should {{consider}} <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>family</b> {{to be the}} first place in which to live their Christian commitment and Franciscan vocation. They should make space within it for prayer, for the Word of God, and for Christian catechesis. They should concern themselves with respect for all life in every situation from conception until death. Married couples find in the Rule of the OFS an effective aid in their own journey of Christian life, aware that in the sacrament of matrimony their love shares in the love that Christ has for his Church. The beauty and the strength of the human love of the spouses is a profound witness for <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>family,</b> the Church, and the world.|$|E

25|$|Some lakinyeri {{may have}} {{disappeared}} and {{others may have}} merged {{as a result of}} population decline following colonisation. Additionally, family groups within the lakinyerar would use the local dialect or <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>family</b> groups name for lakinyeri names, also leading to confusion. For example, Jaralde, Jaraldi, Jarildekald and Jarildikald were separate family groups names as were Ramindjari, Ramindjerar, Ramindjeri, Ramingara, Raminjeri, Raminyeri. Several of these are also used as names for the lakinyerar. Family groups could also change their lakinyeri, Berndt found that two Tangani family groups who lived close to a Yaraldi family group had picked up their dialect and were thus now considered to be Yaraldi.|$|E
