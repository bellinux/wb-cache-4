2500|$|Porfirio Díaz's regime {{as leader}} of Mexico was from 1876 to 1911 and its main goal was to bring order and {{progress}} to the country. In particular, Díaz wanted to bring Mexico into the industrial world and its people to be productive, upstanding members of society. Vices such as drunkenness, laziness, and promiscuity were seen as retarding the beneficial progress {{of the city and}} the nation. Much like the Spanish authority, the Porfirian government and elites saw pulquerias a main source of such vices. So around the turn of the twentieth century there was an increase in the number of reforms and regulations centered on limiting the distribution of pulque, and supervising the use and role of pulquerias. These had to be licensed and located at least [...] apart. Opening hours were restricted to between 6.00 a.m. and 6:30p.m., thus forcing them to close before most workers had left their jobs. There were also many other restrictions on the location of pulquerias. Certain areas of the city, in particular those surrounding the Alameda central park, were forbidden to pulquerias because the Mexican authority did not want <b>the</b> <b>beauty</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> area spoiled by what they considered to be the undesirable characteristics associated with pulquerias. Overall, the Porfirian reforms enacted to directly limit the influence of pulquerias during the Porfiriato did not do much to reduce their popularity in Mexico City and the rest of the country. The Porfiriato did, however, encourage more modern attitudes in Mexico which indirectly and over time led to the diminished popularity of pulquerias.|$|E
2500|$|At four, Seeger {{was sent}} away to {{boarding}} school but came home two years later when his parents learned the school had failed to inform them he had contracted scarlet fever. He attended first and second grades in Nyack, New York, where his mother lived, before entering boarding school in Ridgefield, Connecticut. Despite being classical musicians, his parents did not press him to play an instrument. On his own, the otherwise bookish and withdrawn boy gravitated to the ukulele, becoming adept at entertaining his classmates with it while laying the basis for his subsequent remarkable audience rapport. At thirteen, Seeger enrolled in the Avon Old Farms School in Avon, Connecticut, from which he graduated in 1936. He was selected to attend Camp Rising Sun, the George E. Jonas Foundation's international summer leadership program. During the summer of 1936, while traveling {{with his father and}} stepmother, Pete heard the five-string banjo {{for the first time at}} the Mountain Dance and Folk Festival in western North Carolina near Asheville, organized by local folklorist, lecturer, and traditional music performer Bascom Lamar Lunsford, whom Charles Seeger had hired for Farm Resettlement music projects. The festival took place in a covered baseball field. There the Seegers:watched square-dance teams from Bear Wallow, Happy Hollow, Cane Creek, Spooks Branch, Cheoah Valley, Bull Creek, and Soco Gap; heard the five-string banjo player Samantha Bumgarner; and family string bands, including a group of Indians from the Cherokee reservation who played string instruments and sang ballads. They wandered among the crowds who camped out at the edge of the field, hearing music being made there as well. As Lunsford's daughter would later recall, those country people [...] "held the riches that Dad had discovered. They could sing, fiddle, pick the banjos, and guitars with traditional grace and style found nowhere else but deep in the mountains. I can still hear those haunting melodies drift over the ball park." [...] For the Seegers, experiencing <b>the</b> <b>beauty</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> music firsthand was a [...] "conversion experience". Pete was deeply affected and, after learning basic strokes from Lunsford, spent much of the next four years trying to master the five-string banjo. The teenage Seeger also sometimes accompanied his parents to regular Saturday evening gatherings at the Greenwich Village loft of painter and art teacher Thomas Hart Benton and his wife Rita. Benton, a lover of Americana, played [...] "Cindy" [...] and [...] "Old Joe Clark" [...] with his students Charlie and Jackson Pollock; friends from the [...] "hillbilly" [...] recording industry; as well as avant-garde composers Carl Ruggles and Henry Cowell. It was at one of Benton's parties that Pete heard [...] "John Henry" [...] for the first time.|$|E

I hurryed down the hill which was about 200 feet high and difficult of access, to gaze on this sublimely grand specticle. ... immediately at the cascade the river is about 300 yds. wide; about ninety or a hundred yards of this next the Lard. bluff is a smoth even sheet of water falling over a precipice of at least eighty feet, the remaining part of about 200 yards on my right formes the grandest sight I ever beheld, the hight of the fall is the same of the other but the irregular and somewhat projecting rocks below receives the water in it's passage down and brakes it into a perfect white foam which assumes a thousand forms in a moment sometimes flying up in jets of sparkling foam to the hight of fifteen or twenty feet and are scarcely formed before large roling bodies of the same beaten and foaming water is thrown over and conceals them. in short the rocks seem to be most happily fixed to present a sheet of the whitest beaten froath for 200 yards in length and about 80 feet perpendicular. the water after descending strikes against the butment before mentioned or that on which I stand and seems to reverberate and being met by the more impetuous courant they role and swell into half formed billows of great hight which rise and again disappear in an instant. this butment of rock defends a handsom little bottom of about three acres which is deversified and agreeably shaded with some cottonwood trees; in the lower extremity of the bottom {{there is a very}} thick grove of the same kind of trees which are small, in this wood there are several Indian lodges formed of sticks. ... from the reflection of the sun on the spray or mist which arrises from these falls there is a beatifull rainbow produced which adds not a little to <b>the</b> <b>beauty</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> majestically grand senery. after wrighting this imperfect discription I again viewed the falls and was so much disgusted with the imperfect idea which it conveyed of the scene that I determined to draw my pen across it and begin agin, but then reflected that I could not perhaps succeed better than pening the first impressions of the mind; I wished for the pencil of Salvator Rosa or the pen of Thompson, that I might be enabled to give to the enlightened world some just idea of this truly magnifficent and sublimely grand object, which has from the commencement of time been concealed from the view of civilized man; but this was fruitless and vain.

2500|$|José Nicolau da Fonseca has {{recorded}} that Diogo Rodrigues died in Colvá, Gôa and was buried inside this mother church (Matriz) of Salcette {{of which he}} was the Captain of the fort at that time called Igreja da Nossa Senhora de Neves at Rachol with his grave's inscription reading: Aqui jaz Diogo Rodrigues o do Forte, Capitão desta Fortaleza, O qual derrubou os pagodes destas terras. Falleceu a 21 de Abril de 1577 annos. In English translation this reads: [...] "Here lies Diogo Rodrigues (called) 'O do Forte/ Captain of this Fortress, who destroyed the pagodas of these territories. He died on the 21st April of the year 1577." [...] The grave inscription stone and his relics are still inside the church, near the altar of Igreja da Nossa Senhora de Neves from 1577. [...] Hindu pagodas of Salcette in Goa were destroyed by Diego who personally oversaw this destruction in 1567. This led to the mass exodus of Hindus from the Portuguese held territories and the Hindus taking the idols of their deities across the Zuari river to the territories of the Hindu Sonde Kings. Amongst the temples destroyed are the temples of Shri Ramnathi, Shree Shantadurga and Shree Mangeshi. Also destroyed were nine pagodas in the village of Margão (Mathagrama) by Diogo, who was rewarded with the revenues of the lands belonging to them the destruction was triggered when a Jesuit was attacked and when the community of Loutolim disobeyed Diogo Rodrigues, the then Captain of the Fort of Rachol as he had called the residents of the village of Lotoulim for a meeting, but they did not turn up. As a punishment to them, he burnt down the temple of Ramnath. The villagers filed a case with Capitão às Justiças de sua Magestad in Goa. The magistrate ordered the Captain to rebuild the temple. With the support of the Archbishop Primaz and the Provincial Council, the Captain obtained an Order from the Viceroy to burn down en masse the temples of Salcete, consequently the viceroy: Dom António de Noronha (1564–1568) {{at the request of the}} Archbishop and the Jesuits ordered Diogo Rodrigues to burn down all the remaining temples he found in Salcette, the viceroy also issued a decree in December 1565 forbidding the erection of new temples and the repairs of the existing ones, this was as stated: [...] "I hereby order that in any area owned by my master, the King, nobody should construct a Hindu temple and such temples already constructed should not be repaired without my permission. If this order is transgressed, such temples shall be, destroyed and the goods in them shall be used to meet expenses of holy deeds, as punishment of such transgression." [...] Diogo Rodrigues was also known as [...] "O do Forte", In English: [...] "Of the Strong", the Captain of Salcette who ordered the destruction of the temples of Assolna, Ambelim, Velim, Veroda, Cuncolim and Talvorda, when the villagers failed to obey some of his orders. The property and income of the temples were given to the church authorities. The exact date when the Captain Diogo Rodrigues descended upon the temple of Malsa devi (to be converted into a Church of Our Lady of Conception in future) [...] in all fury was on 7 March 1567 just at the time when the priest was about to bedeck the idol of Mahalasa with silver ornaments. Those ornaments were confiscated along with other valuables of the temple and a proper inventory of the movables was made, then began the act of destruction. The image in the sanctum sanctorum was broken to pieces allegedly because Fr. Luis Goes had denounced her as a ‘bad woman’. The villagers managed to spirit away other idols. Sacred books and works of art that enhanced <b>the</b> <b>beauty</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> temple together with the roof were ruthlessly destroyed. The Captain retreated after planting a Cross at the most prominent spot at the site. The details of the destruction of this temple are to be found in the Report of Irmão Gomes Vaz dated December 12, 1567 which notes that the temple was totally destroyed on March 14, 1567. Diego Rodrigues took toll of 280 temples in Salcette alone. The cults from those temples were shifted mainly to the New Conquest areas where, the Desais and the Sardesais, the feudal lords of Sultan Adil Shaha of Bijapur, being Hindus themselves, took it as their holy duty to facilitate creation of new abodes for the said cults.|$|E
