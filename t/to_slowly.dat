5|$|In about 65 billion years, it {{estimated}} that the Moon may end up colliding with the Earth, assuming they are not destroyed by the red giant Sun, due to the remaining energy of the Earth–Moon system being sapped by the remnant Sun, causing the Moon <b>to</b> <b>slowly</b> move inwards toward the Earth.|$|E
5|$|Minneapolis {{was founded}} at Saint Anthony Falls, the only {{waterfall}} on the Mississippi River, {{because of the}} potential for energy created by falling, flowing water. Loring understood the city's geography—its waterfalls, lakes and river banks—and was able to use these unique aspects of his new home <b>to</b> <b>slowly</b> build his fortune.|$|E
5|$|Yellowknife, in 1967, was not {{yet ready}} to serve as home for the government. During the years that it took for the capital's {{infrastructure}} <b>to</b> <b>slowly</b> develop, most of the civil service remained in Fort Smith for many years and the governing Council continued its practice of holding legislative sessions all over the territory for a number of years.|$|E

5|$|After these events, Ueshiba seemed <b>to</b> <b>slowly</b> grow {{away from}} Takeda, {{and he began}} to change his art. These changes are {{reflected}} in the differing names with which he referred to his system, first as aiki-jūjutsu, then Ueshiba-ryū, Asahi-ryū, and aiki budō. In 1942, when Ueshiba's group joined the Dai Nippon Butoku Kai, the martial art that Ueshiba developed finally {{came to be known as}} aikido.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with the}} {{asteroid}} bodies, {{the asteroid belt}} also contains bands of dust with particle radii of up to a few hundred micrometres. This fine material is produced, at least in part, from collisions between asteroids, and by the impact of micrometeorites upon the asteroids. Due to the Poynting–Robertson effect, the pressure of solar radiation causes this dust <b>to</b> <b>slowly</b> spiral inward toward the Sun.|$|E
5|$|As part of {{advancing}} science, several experiments observing {{the reaction of}} frogs <b>to</b> <b>slowly</b> heated water {{took place in the}} 19th century. In 1869, while doing experiments searching for the location of the soul, German physiologist Friedrich Goltz demonstrated that a frog that has had its brain removed will remain in slowly heated water, but an intact frog attempted to escape the water when it reached 25°C.|$|E

5|$|As {{the battles}} at P'ohang-dong raged to the south, the ROK 3rd Division faced {{increasing}} {{pressure from the}} NK 5th Division. North Korean officers from the division continued to attack the ROK unit hoping it would collapse, and the North Korean troops were able <b>to</b> <b>slowly</b> erode at the South Korean division′s defenses, forcing it into a smaller and smaller pocket. The ROK division was forced further south {{to the village of}} Changsa-dong, where U.S. Navy planners began preparations to evacuate the division by LSTs and DUKWs.|$|E
5|$|Burning houses {{suspected}} of being partisan meeting places and poisoning water wells became common practice for soldiers of the German 9th Army. At Kharkov, the fourth largest city in the Soviet Union, food was provided only to {{the small number of}} civilians who worked for the Germans, with the rest designated <b>to</b> <b>slowly</b> starve. Thousands of Soviets were deported to Germany to be used as slave labor beginning in 1942.|$|E
5|$|Chemical {{restoration}} {{is a type}} {{of chemical}} milling. Typically, chemical milling is used <b>to</b> <b>slowly</b> remove material to create a desired shape. In serial number restoration, small amounts of metal are removed until the serial number is brought back to the surface. This can be performed due to the depth that serial numbers are engraved into the weapon. However, chemical restoration is limited by that depth and is only successful when the obliteration of the serial number is superficial. Examiners performing a restoration first sand the area where the serial number used to be. This removes any debris from the area left when the serial number was obliterated. The examiner then chooses a chemical, usually an acid, that will be used <b>to</b> <b>slowly</b> bring the number back to the surface. The type of chemical that is used depends on the material the weapon is made of. These acids can range from Fry's Reagent for a magnetic metal, which is a mixture of hydrochloric acid, cupric chloride, and distilled water, to an acidic ferric chloride solution for a non-magnetic, non-aluminum material.|$|E

5|$|Early on August3, Arlene {{began to}} weaken {{as it turned}} towards the west once more. The storm {{continued}} <b>to</b> <b>slowly</b> weaken before rapidly degenerating into a tropical depression on August4. The quick decrease in intensity {{was the result of}} a sudden increase in vertical wind shear near the core of the cyclone. Later that day, the system passed near the northern Leeward Islands; however, the depression was poorly organized. The former hurricane steadily tracked northwestward and began to regenerate on August7.|$|E
5|$|For a time, Duyệt's {{attitude}} and stature {{in the south}} forced Minh Mạng to moderate his policies and allow the preaching of Christian missionaries. However, it also increased {{the tension between the}} pair and Minh Mạng was anxious to curtail the autonomy that his father had granted to Duyệt and the southerners. The emperor began <b>to</b> <b>slowly</b> wind back their military powers, in an attempt to wear down Duyệt's power base by gradually removing the general's close aides.|$|E
5|$|His {{marriage}} with Jobst soon collapsed and they divorced. He married twice thereafter and his third wife, Helga Schröck (whom he married in May 1959), {{gave birth to}} a son, Hermann-Ulrich, in 1959, and a daughter, Birgit, in 1961. In 1965, Graf was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, a condition that seemed to affect many former high-altitude flyers and which caused his health <b>to</b> <b>slowly</b> deteriorate. Graf died in his hometown of Engen on 4 November 1988.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Bonnie was a {{long-lived}} {{storm in}} the 1992 Atlantic hurricane season. It {{was the third}} tropical storm (including the April subtropical storm) and second hurricane of the 1992 season. Bonnie formed at high latitudes in the central Atlantic on September 17. Devoid of any real steering currents for much of its lifespan, it was nearly stationary for over {{a week in the}} central Atlantic Ocean. On September 27, it began <b>to</b> <b>slowly</b> track east and northeast towards the Azores. Just before becoming extratropical, it affected the Azores on September 30, although no damage was reported.|$|E
5|$|In 1243, the Seljuk armies were {{defeated}} by the Mongols at the Battle of Köse Dağ, causing the Seljuk Empire's power <b>to</b> <b>slowly</b> disintegrate. In its wake, one of the Turkish principalities governed by Osman I would evolve over the next 200 years into the Ottoman Empire. In 1453, the Ottomans completed their conquest of the Byzantine Empire by capturing its capital, Constantinople.|$|E
5|$|In this episode, Michael's (Steve Carell) {{controversial}} {{imitation of}} a Chris Rock routine forces the staff to undergo a racial diversity seminar. A consultant (Larry Wilmore) arrives to teach the staff about tolerance and diversity, but Michael insists on imparting his own knowledge—aggravating both the consultant and the entire office staff—and creates his own diversity seminar. He eventually assigns each staff member an index card with a different race on it, causing tempers <b>to</b> <b>slowly</b> simmer until they finally snap. Meanwhile, Jim struggles to keep hold of a lucrative contract extension, but Dwight makes the sale for himself.|$|E

5|$|Intermittent {{bursts of}} deep {{convection}} kept satellite intensity estimates at 40mph (65km/h) {{through the morning}} of June28. After becoming embedded within a low-level westerly flow, the system began <b>to</b> <b>slowly</b> execute a small counter-clockwise loop. That afternoon, Celia degenerated into a non-convective remnant low pressure system; operationally, the system was monitored as a tropical depression for an additional six hours before the final advisory from the NHC was issued. The remnants of Celia continued to drift towards the north before finally dissipating on June30, about 990mi (1,590km) southwest of {{the southern tip of}} Baja California Sur.|$|E
5|$|On August 22, 2011, Six Flags America {{announced}} on their Facebook page {{that they would}} be adding a new attraction in 2012.

On September 1, 2011, Six Flags America announced {{that they would be}} adding Apocalypse in 2012.|$|E
5|$|The Pink Member of the Claron Formation {{is largely}} {{composed}} of easily eroded and relatively soft limestone. When rain combines with carbon dioxide {{it forms a}} weak solution of carbonic acid. This acid helps <b>to</b> <b>slowly</b> dissolve the limestone in the Claron Formation grain by grain. It is this process of chemical weathering that rounds the edges of hoodoos and gives them their lumpy and bulging profiles.|$|E
