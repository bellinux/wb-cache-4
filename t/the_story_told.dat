5|$|Gandavyuha is <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>told</b> in {{the final}} chapter of the Avatamsaka Sutra about Sudhana's tireless {{wandering}} {{in search of the}} Highest Perfect Wisdom. It covers two galleries (third and fourth) and also half of the second gallery, comprising in total of 460 panels. The principal figure of the story, the youth Sudhana, son of an extremely rich merchant, appears on the 16th panel. The preceding 15 panels form a prologue to the story of the miracles during Buddha's samadhi in the Garden of Jeta at Sravasti.|$|E

He explains that he and other crew members were locked in with their captain, who was infected by the black oil. After being knocked out from behind, the black oil leaves the captain's body and exits via a grate into the sea. It is revealed that Bill Mulder and the Smoking Man {{are two of the}} agents who are interviewing the crewman.|$|E
5|$|It {{was in this}} palace that Alboin {{was killed}} on June 28, 572. In the account given by Paul the Deacon, the most {{detailed}} narrative on Alboin's death, history and saga intermingle almost inextricably. Much earlier and shorter is <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>told</b> by Marius of Aventicum in his Chronica, written about a decade after Alboin's murder. According to his version the king {{was killed in a}} conspiracy by a man close to him, called Hilmegis (Paul's Helmechis), with the connivance of the queen. Helmichis then married the widow, but the two were forced to escape to Byzantine Ravenna, taking with them the royal treasure and part of the army, which hints at the cooperation of Byzantium. Roger Collins describes Marius as an especially reliable source because of his early date and his having lived close to Lombard Italy.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>story,</b> <b>told</b> {{through the}} use of voiced and {{animated}} comic panels, centers on Angel, a heroine in a post-apocalyptic United States that travels from town to town protecting helpless survivors of the war from attacking gangs. Angel defends the towns using Gypsy, the name given to her armored car equipped with mounted machine guns. The game uses an overhead view as the player speeds around a small town using Gypsy's machine guns to repel enemy gangs known as Wastelanders. There are three types of Wastelanders and each one unleashes attacks in a different manner: The Slavers class will attempt to capture the townspeople, Killers will only attack the player, and Duals can take on either the role of attacking or capturing during a raid. When enemies are killed, they leave behind weapons for the player such as napalm, land mines, or Electromagnetic pulse bombs (EMPs); or they drop upgrades which improve the car's weapons or armor. The EMPs are used to temporarily disable all the enemies on the screen while the napalm and land mines can be set between waves as traps for unsuspecting Wastelanders. One weapon upgrade offers players incendiary ammunition for the car's machine guns which makes it easier to destroy enemies by lighting them on fire.|$|E
5|$|The true {{origin of}} the rhyme is unknown, but there are several theories. Complicated metaphors are often said to exist within the lyrics, as is common with nursery rhyme exegesis. Most {{explanations}} post-date the first publication of the rhyme and have no corroborating evidence. These include the suggestion by S. Baring-Gould in the 19th century that the events were a version of <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>told</b> in the 13th-century Prose Edda Gylfaginning written by Icelandic historian Snorri Sturluson. Baring-Gould stated that Hjúki and Bil, brother and sister respectively in Norse mythology, were taken up from the earth by the moon (personified as the god Máni) as they were fetching water from the well called Byrgir, bearing on their shoulders the cask called Saegr and the pole called Simul. Around 1835, John Bellenden Ker suggested that Jack and Jill were two priests; this was enlarged by Katherine Elwes in 1930 to indicate that Jack represented Cardinal Wolsey (c.1471–1530) and Jill was Bishop Tarbes, who negotiated the marriage of Mary Tudor to the French king in 1514.|$|E

25|$|In 1707, Apostolo Zeno and Pietro Pariati wrote a {{libretto}} entitled Flavio Anicio Olibrio. <b>The</b> <b>story</b> <b>told</b> in {{the opera}} {{is quite different}} from the real one, despite the fact that Zeno claimed to use several historical sources (Evagrius Scholasticus l.2.c.7, Procopius of Caesarea, Historia Vandalorum, l.1, Paul the Deacon, vi): Ricimer captures Rome, frees his sister Teodolinda and enslaves Placidia, daughter of Valentinian III; a little later, Olybrius frees Rome and Placidia, and marries her.|$|E

25|$|The Greeks, who had {{the naked}} body {{constantly}} before them in the exercises of the gymnasium, had far less need of professional models than the moderns; but it is scarcely likely {{that they could have}} attained the high level reached by their works without constant study from nature. It was probably in Ancient Greece that models were first used. <b>The</b> <b>story</b> <b>told</b> of Zeuxis by Valerius Maximus, who had five of the most beautiful virgins of the city of Crotone offered him as models for his picture of Helen, proves their occasional use. The names of some of these models of the era are themselves known, such as the beautiful Phryne who modeled for many paintings and sculptures.|$|E
25|$|Initially, a play by Alexandre Dumas {{was chosen}} as the subject for the opera, but Bellini had {{reservations}} about its suitability. After he and Giuditta Pasta (for whom the opera was to be written) had together seen the ballet based on the very different play, Tedaldi-Fores' Beatrice Tenda, in Milan in October 1832, she became enthusiastic about the subject and the composer set about persuading Romani that this was a good idea. Romani, who had his own concerns, the principal one being the close parallels with <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>told</b> in Donizetti's Anna Bolena, an opera which had established that composer's success in 1830. Against his better judgment, he finally agreed, although he failed to provide verses for many months.|$|E
25|$|Rosa {{was exposed}} to comics {{at a very young}} age, as his 11-years-older sister was a comics hoarder, and had {{thousands}} of comics for Don to look at and later read. Rosa began drawing comics before being able to write. Until he attended Saint Xavier High School in Louisville, Kentucky, his featured characters were a large cast of stick figures featured in comedy-adventures like the Barks comics and old movies Rosa enjoyed most. He never tried to draw more than stick figures, because the drawings, for him, were illustrations to get <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>told.</b> Only the story was important to him, not the actual drawings. His favorite comic books growing up were Uncle Scrooge by Western Publishing and Little Lulu comics from Dell Comics (Western Publishing), and his sister's collection of MAD comics and magazines. When he was 12 years old he also discovered and enjoyed the Superman titles by DC Comics of the editor Mort Weisinger period, drawn mostly by his favorite Superman artists Curt Swan and Kurt Schaffenberger. Shortly after starting to collect Superman comics he started to trade the collection of his older sister for Superman Comics. Since a comic book shop in his area traded two old comics for one new, he only had two Duck comics left from his sister's collection by the 1970s, one of them being The Golden Helmet. When he became a serious collector of older comics, he particularly enjoyed the classic E.C. horror and science fiction comics of the 1950s, Will Eisner's The Spirit, Walt Kelly's Pogo, and most comics of the 1940s onward.|$|E
