40|$|AbstractThe {{development}} of trichomes and root hairs in Arabidopsis provide useful {{models for the}} study of cell fate determination in plants. A common network of putative transcriptional regulators, including the small MYB proteins TRIPTYCHON (<b>TRY)</b> <b>and</b> CAPRICE (CPC), is known to influence the patterning of both cell types. Here, we used an activation tagging strategy to identify a new regulator, ENHANCER OF <b>TRY</b> <b>AND</b> CPC 1 (ETC 1). The ETC 1 sequence is similar to <b>TRY</b> <b>and</b> CPC, and ETC 1 overexpression causes a reduction in trichome formation and excessive root hair production. The etc 1 single mutant has no significant phenotype, but it enhances the effect of cpc <b>and</b> <b>try</b> on trichome <b>and</b> root hair development, which shows that ETC 1 function is partially redundant with <b>TRY</b> <b>and</b> CPC. In addition, the etc 1 try cpc triple mutant has novel phenotypes, revealing previously unrecognized roles for these regulators in epidermis development. An ETC 1 promoter–reporter gene fusion is expressed in the developing trichome and non-hair cells, similar to the expression of <b>TRY</b> <b>and</b> CPC. These results suggest that ETC 1, <b>TRY,</b> <b>and</b> CPC act in concert to repress the trichome cell fate in the shoot epidermis and the non-hair cell fate in the root epidermis...|$|R
