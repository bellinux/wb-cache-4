5|$|Route 112 {{was first}} {{assigned}} in the 1928 state numbering of state highways in Pennsylvania. The route, when originally assigned, did start in Markham, but at an intersection with U.S. Route 1.

In 1941, the southern terminus was adjusted from the intersection with U.S. Route 1 (the Baltimore Pike) to an intersection with U.S. Route 322 near Markham. Although {{they made the}} adjustment, PA 112 ended up {{becoming one of the}} many routes decommissioned in 1946, when the commonwealth of Pennsylvania removed several hundred miles from their system. The designation has not been re-used since the 1946 removal.|$|E

5|$|Lucas Rafael Bennazar Ortíz {{participated in}} the Beijing Olympics as Puerto Rico's only sharpshooter. Born in the {{northern}} city of Guaynabo, Bennazar first {{participated in the}} Olympics as a 35-year-old in Athens that competed in the men's trap shooting and double trap.

During this time, Bennazar earned 45 points in the first round; 39 points in the second round; and 39 points again in the third round. His overall score during preliminaries was 123 points, placing 17th out of 19 athletes. He defeated New Zealand's Graeme Ede (113 points) and fell behind Russia's Vitaly Fokeev (130 points), falling behind heat leader Walton Eller of the United States who set an Olympic record with his score (145 points). His score remained <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> final round on August 12, and he remained in 17th place.|$|E
5|$|Now {{under the}} command of Brigadier Gerald Lathbury, 1st Parachute Brigade's {{objective}} in Sicily was the Primosole bridge across the Simeto River, south of Catania, the only crossing point that gave the Eighth Army access to the Catania plain. Once they had captured the bridge, the brigade were to hold out until relieved by Major-General Sidney C. Kirkman's 50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division, reinforced by the 4th Armoured Brigade advancing from the landing beaches. Paratroops of the brigade would land on four DZs and the gliders at two landing zones (LZ). The 1st Parachute Battalion was divided into two groups that would land at DZs {{on both sides of the}} river and thereafter attack the bridge from both sides simultaneously–3rd Parachute Battalion would land on their own DZ north of the bridge and secure the high ground, while the 2nd Parachute Battalion did <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> south.|$|E

5|$|The Doctor {{explains}} that crossing the Void causes a traveller to become saturated in Void material. If {{he opens the}} breach and reverses it, anything saturated in Void material will be pulled in. Everyone except Jackie has crossed the breach and is thus vulnerable to being trapped in the Void, so the Doctor sends them all to the parallel universe. Rose decides she would rather be with the Doctor than her family and jumps back to help him. The Cybermen attempt to stop the Doctor but are repelled by a converted Ms. Hartman, who has resisted the effects of her conversion and at least partially retains her sense of self. The Doctor and Rose open the breach and hang on to magnetic clamps as the Cybermen and Daleks are pulled in. The Cult of Skaro use an emergency temporal shift to escape. Rose's lever slips, and in resetting it she loses her grip and plunges toward the Void. At the last second, Pete reappears and grabs her, and together they transport back to the parallel universe. The breach closes, leaving a devastated Rose trapped in the parallel universe. The devices used to travel between the two worlds have also stopped working. The Doctor presses his ear against the wall, as a tearful Rose does <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> other universe, {{as if trying to}} listen for each other.|$|E
5|$|The {{species was}} {{described}} as new to science by American mycologists Rolf Singer and Alexander H. Smith, based on specimens collected in Nor Yungas Province, Bolivia, {{on the road to}} La Paz to Coroico. They published a short description in Latin in a 1958 Mycologia publication, followed by a more detailed description in English later that year. According to Psilocybe specialist Gastón Guzmán, the species Psilocybe acutissima (described by Roger Heim in 1958), and Psilocybe isauri (described by Singer in 1959) are synonyms, as both the macroscopic and microscopic features are <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> type material of all three. Singer considered P.isauri a species distinct from P.yungensis because of differences in the hairiness of the stem surface. Smith named the variety P.yungensis var. diconica for specimens he found with conical, rather than obconical (the form of an inverted cone) papilla. Similarly, the main distinguishing feature that Heim ascribed to P.acutissima was a papillate cap (somewhat resembling the shape of a female human breast). Later studies showed that these morphological variations did not warrant individual recognition, because of the variable nature of these characteristics, and the existence of intermediate forms.|$|E

5|$|The {{story is}} {{virtually}} <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> DS version, {{but with some}} major differences in the introductory sequence: Luneth goes to the Altar Cave alone, but while exploring he trips and falls into a hole created by the earthquake. He is then beset by goblins, and while he is frantically searching for a way out, he comes upon the wind crystal. It tells him {{that he has been}} chosen as a Warrior of Light, destined to restore balance to the world, and there are three others like him, but before Luneth can ask it to elaborate, he is teleported to the surface. He returns to Ur, but Elder Topapa does not elucidate much on the matter. Going to a corner of town, Luneth finds his friend Arc being bullied by some of the kids. When Luneth intervenes, Arc runs away, heading for the village of Kazus.|$|E
5|$|While Margarito did not land {{a lot of}} punches, he {{remained}} the more engaged fighter in the sixth round. A left hook to the body had Cotto on the defensive early in the seventh round, but {{he was able to}} fend off additional difficulty. A right hand from Cotto slowed Margarito, but he returned with punches that forced Cotto to clinch. Margarito commanded the bulk of the round, throwing 130punches in the round according to Compubox. Cotto was advocated by his corner in between rounds to stay off the ropes. He obliged, providing lateral movement throughout the round but with approximately 30seconds left, Margarito was able to trap Cotto in a corner, but Cotto managed to escape. It was more of <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ninth round, with Cotto going back and forth between southpaw and conventional stance. Margarito continued charging ahead, although Cotto would counterpunch sufficiency to avoid Margarito. The same pattern applied as in the previous two rounds, with Margarito charging forward and Cotto using movement while anticipating chances to counterpunch. Margarito immediately concluded the gap in the final 15seconds, landing a left hook, left uppercut and right hand that had Cotto against the ropes. Halfway through the eleventh round, a left uppercut by Margarito left Cotto vulnerable as he took a knee after Margarito landed a right uppercut and two right hands. Cotto managed to get up, but he went down again, despite Margarito not landing another punch. The referee moved in to count, but Evangelista Cotto, Cotto's trainer and uncle, climbed onto the ring apron and threw in the towel. The official time of the stoppage was 2:05of round eleven.|$|E
5|$|The Kurma Purana narrates {{that during}} a {{particular}} council of rishis (sages), the god Brahma arrogantly {{declared that he}} was the Supreme Creator of the Universe. Shiva appeared at the assembly as an infinite pillar of light and challenged Brahma's statement. After deliberation, the council accepted Shiva as the true Creator, but Brahma remained obstinate. Angered by Brahma's vanity, Shiva—as the terrifying Bhairava—cut off one head of the five-headed Brahma with a mere flick of his fingernail (an act iconographically depicted as Brahmashirascheda-murti). As a consequence Brahma died, but the spiritual credit he had accumulated over a lifetime of devout asceticism pulled him immediately back from death. Upon his resurrection, Brahma accepted Shiva's superiority. The reason for the decapitation of Brahma remains <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> narratives of the Shiva Purana and the Matsya Purana. In the Skanda Purana, the trigger is not Brahma's arrogance but his incest with his daughter, while in the Bengali version of the Shiva Purana, Brahma insults Shiva using his fifth head's mouth, while the rest of them praise Shiva when he comes to Brahma's abode as a guest. In another instance in the Shiva Purana, when an argument erupts between Brahma and Vishnu over who is superior, Shiva appears as an infinite fiery pillar (Linga) in front of the pair. They decide whoever finds the end of the pillar is superior. Brahma lies about finding the head of the infinite pillar and declares himself as superior. In the Varaha Purana, in which Shiva is born from Brahma's brow, Brahma calls his son a Kapali and angers him. In all versions, an infuriated Shiva or Bhairava cuts off Brahma's head as a punishment. However, all Puranas (Kurma, Varaha, Shiva, Skanda, and Vamana) agree that the head of Brahma stuck to Bhairava-Shiva's left palm due to the sin of killing Brahma, the most learned Brahmin – Brahmahatya or Brahminicide. To expiate the sin of brahmahatya, Shiva had to perform the vow of a Kapali: wandering the world as a naked beggar with the skull of the slain as his begging bowl. In the Kurma and Vamana Puranas, Shiva's sin takes corporeal form, becoming a ghoulish woman called Brahmahatya who follows Bhikshatana everywhere he goes.|$|E
