5|$|Joe is victorious, and Captain Blue, {{finally coming}} to his senses, thanks the young hero for {{stopping}} him. He explains that two decades earlier, Blue was a revolutionary film maker who was soon {{thought of as}} a fad. Wanting nothing more than to create heroes, Blue was sucked into one of his own films, allowing him to live out his dream as a hero. However, he had lost <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>reality</b> and wanted revenge on the people who had betrayed him. As Captain Blue and Silvia embrace in a heartfelt reunion, the director tells Joe that the story is not complete. He snaps his fingers, and the space station's onboard computer warns {{of a large number of}} UFOs heading towards Earth. Blue tells Joe that a hero will be needed twice more to save the world. Joe attempts to leave but not before Silvia requests a V-Watch from her father and to accompany her boyfriend. Viewtiful Joe and a newly transformed Silvia head out to stop the impending threat together.|$|E

Some of her public speeches also provoked controversies; teaching union representatives called for her resignation on several occasions.|$|R
25|$|Thus, {{when the}} Act became law on 23 December 1920 {{it was already}} out of <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>realities</b> in Ireland. The long-standing demand for home rule had been {{replaced}} among Nationalists by a demand for complete independence. The Republic's army was waging the Irish War of Independence against British rule, which had reached a nadir in late 1920.|$|R

25|$|In {{more extreme}} cases {{features}} of psychosis, with delusions of persecution or delusions of reference, and pressure of speech may present themselves. Rarely, patients develop visual or auditory hallucinations or a frank psychosis, and may appear schizophrenic, lose <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>reality</b> and become delirious, Such psychotic symptoms may not completely clear {{up after the}} hyperthyroidism has been treated. Paranoia and paranoid-hallucionary psychosis in hyperthyroidism usually have a manic disposition and it is therefore often not clear if the patient is experiencing a paranoid psychosis with depressive streaks, or a depression that has paranoid streaks.|$|E
25|$|O'Brien {{accepted}} the Rising {{and the ensuing}} changed political climate in 1917 {{as the best way}} of ridding the country of IPP and AOH stagnation. Home Rule had been lost in 1913, an inflexible IPP long out of <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>reality,</b> reflected by Britain's two failed attempts to introduce Home Rule in 1916 and again in 1917. O'Brien refused to participate in the Irish Convention after southern unionist representatives he had proposed were turned down. The Convention ended as he predicted in failure when Britain attempted to link the enactment of Home Rule with conscription.|$|E

50|$|The Navya {{movement}} {{was not without}} its critics. The doubt, dilemmas and indecision in every turn of the plot resulted in increasingly sophisticated and complex narrations, which some readers found uninteresting. It was derided as an intellectual exercise {{of the middle class}} intelligentsia; in its extreme sophistication, it was thought to have lost its <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>realities</b> of life. This led to a gradual waning of the Navya school as it was supplanted by emerging waves of Navyottara, Bandaya (protest) and Dalit schools.|$|R
50|$|This theory {{suggests}} that monopolies of knowledge gradually suppress new ways of thinking. Entrenched hierarchies become increasingly rigid and out of <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> social <b>realities.</b> Challenges to elite power are often likely to arise {{on the margins of}} society. The arts, for example, are often seen as a means of escape from the sterility of conformist thought.|$|R
25|$|A Scanner Darkly (1977) is a bleak {{mixture of}} science fiction and police {{procedural}} novels; in its story, an undercover narcotics police detective begins to lose <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>reality</b> after falling victim to the same permanently mind-altering drug, Substance D, he was enlisted to help fight. Substance D is instantly addictive, beginning with a pleasant euphoria which is quickly replaced with increasing confusion, hallucinations and eventually total psychosis. In this novel, as with all Dick novels, there is an underlying thread of paranoia and dissociation with multiple realities perceived simultaneously. It was adapted to film by Richard Linklater.|$|E
25|$|The {{attempt to}} prove that Hitler had a fully {{developed}} psychosis in a clinical sense has only occasionally been made. An example is the book Hitler, Steiner, Schreber (1966) by the Freiburg psychiatrist Wolfgang Treher. Treher explains that both Rudolf Steiner (whose anthroposophy he attributes to mental illness) and Hitler suffered from schizophrenia. He writes that both managed to stay in <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>reality</b> because they {{had the opportunity to}} create their own organizations (Steiner: the Anthroposophical Society; Hitler: the NSDAP and its many subdivisions) that they could influence according to their delusions – and therefore avoid the, normally expected, “schizophrenic withdrawal”. Treher finds that Hitler’s megalomania and paranoia are quite striking.|$|E
25|$|After {{five years}} of non stop {{recording}} and touring and having lost <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>reality,</b> the band {{decided to take a}} sabbatical in 1997. They worked on some demos in January 1998, but did not find the band dynamics revitalized, and the trio decided to split up on 10 March 1998 when discussing the future of the band on a bench in the Rosenborg Castle Gardens. The split occurred amidst a wave of prominent Danish bands disbanding. Critics would later explain their decision as the band having the courage to stop in time despite enormous success, although it was largely due to fatigue that the trio could not bring themselves to continuing to play. Their tastes in music had also become less compatible, with Christensen wanting a more vintage Beatles-like sound and Nielsen and Friis preferring to make heavy metal music.|$|E

50|$|Brahmarakshas (ब्रह्मराक्षस) is {{considered}} his most influential work in experimental poems, noted {{for the use}} of archetypal imagery, and the stark depiction of the contemporary intellectual, who gets so lost in his own sense of perfectionism, unending calculations, and subjective interpretation of the external reality that soon he loses <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> the <b>reality</b> itself, and eventually dies and fades away like dead bird.|$|R

However, Lieutenant Mac, a local police officer, discovers Chet's involvement and hunts him down, leading to a tragic denouement.|$|R
500|$|Later {{that same}} month, in January 1919, after Weber and Weber's party were {{defeated}} for election, Weber delivered {{one of his}} greatest academic lectures, [...] "Politics as a Vocation", which was a reflection on the inherent violence and dishonesty found among the politicians, a profession in which only recently Weber was so personally active. [...] About the nature of politicians, he concluded that [...] "In {{nine out of ten}} cases they are windbags puffed up with hot air about themselves. They are not in <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>reality,</b> and they do not feel the burden they need to shoulder; they just intoxicate themselves with romantic sensations." ...|$|E
500|$|The lyrical themes on {{the album}} explore a variety of subjects, from nuclear {{holocaust}} ("Set the World Afire") to revisionism and censorship ("Hook in Mouth"). Still, {{the majority of the}} songs are accompanied by the same sentiment of disillusion and nihilism as their previous two albums. Unlike traditional topics related to heavy metal music, the song [...] "In My Darkest Hour" [...] contains emotional lyrics which deal with loneliness and isolation. Dave Mustaine revealed that he tried to write about subject matters that were in <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>reality,</b> including social issues and taboo topics. The lyrics on Megadeth's cover of [...] "Anarchy in the U.K." [...] were slightly mistaken because Mustaine claimed he had heard them incorrectly.|$|E
500|$|A police {{psychiatrist}} who interviewed Lépine's family and entourage, {{and who had}} access to his letters, suggested {{that he may have}} had a serious personality disorder, as he chose the multiple homicide/suicide strategy (killing oneself after killing others) that is a characteristic of this disorder. The psychiatrist noted [...] "extreme narcissistic vulnerability" [...] as shown by fantasies of power and success combined with high levels of self-criticism and difficulties dealing with rejection and failure. Feelings of powerlessness and incompetence were compensated for by a violent and grandiose imaginary life. Other psychiatrists suggested that Lépine was psychotic, having lost <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>reality</b> as he tried to erase the memories of a brutal (and absent) father, {{while at the same time}} unconsciously identifying with a violent manhood that dominates women. Other theories were that Lépine's experiences of abuse as a child had caused brain-damage or led him to feel victimized as he faced losses and rejections in his later life.|$|E
50|$|Groupe Feministe Socialiste {{experienced}} some strife {{in the form}} of conflict between its two founders, who had had their differences from the beginning. Elisabeth Renaud's goals were conciliatory; she hoped {{to bridge the gap between}} socialism and bourgeois feminism. Louise Saumoneau, on the other hand, hated the bourgeois feminists, feeling that they were irrevocably out of <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> the <b>realities</b> of the working class.|$|R
5000|$|Von Franz {{considered}} that [...] "the {{dark side of}} the Self is the most dangerous thing of all, precisely because the Self is the greatest power in the psyche. It can cause people to 'spin' megalomanic or other delusionary fantasies that catch them up", so that the victim [...] "thinks with mounting excitement that he has grasped the great cosmic riddles; he therefore loses all <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> human <b>reality.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Yen later {{recalled}} {{that at this}} time he regarded himself not as a [...] "Christian," [...] which implied membership in a church, but as a [...] "follower of Christ," [...] implying a direct relation with Jesus. He criticized most missionaries for not being in <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> the <b>realities</b> of China but enthusiastically welcomed the support of those Chinese and foreign Christian organizations which addressed the problems of the village.|$|R
500|$|As {{predicted}} by Marc Lépine in his suicide letter, some saw the event as the isolated {{act of a}} madman. A psychiatrist interviewed Lépine's {{family and friends and}} examined his writings as part of the police investigation. He noted that Marc Lépine defined suicide as his primary motivation, and that he chose a specific suicide method, namely killing oneself after killing others (multiple homicide/suicide strategy), which is considered a sign of a serious personality disorder. [...] Other psychiatrists emphasized the traumatic events of his childhood, suggesting that the blows he had received may have caused brain damage, or that Lépine was psychotic, having lost <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>reality</b> as he tried to erase the memories of a brutal (yet largely absent) father while unconsciously identifying with a violent masculinity that dominated women. A different theory was that Lépine's childhood experiences of abuse led him to feel victimized as he faced losses and rejections in his later life. His mother wondered if Lépine might have suffered from attachment disorder, due to the abuse and sense of abandonment he had experienced in his childhood.|$|E
500|$|The Allied {{disaster}} at Austerlitz significantly {{shook the}} faith of Emperor Francis in the British-led war effort. France and Austria agreed to an armistice immediately and the Treaty of Pressburg followed shortly after on 26 December. Pressburg took Austria out of both {{the war and the}} Coalition while reinforcing the earlier treaties of Campo Formio and of Lunéville between the two powers. The treaty confirmed the Austrian loss of lands to France in Italy and Bavaria, and lands in Germany to Napoleon's German allies. It also imposed an indemnity of 40 million francs on the defeated Habsburgs and allowed the fleeing Russian troops free passage through hostile territories and back to their home soil. Napoleon went on to say, [...] "The battle of Austerlitz is the finest of all I have fought". Frank McLynn suggests that Napoleon was so successful at Austerlitz that he lost <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>reality,</b> and what used to be French foreign policy became a [...] "personal Napoleonic one". Vincent Cronin disagrees, stating that Napoleon was not overly ambitious for himself, [...] "he embodied the ambitions of thirty million Frenchmen".|$|E
500|$|Napoleon did {{not succeed}} in {{defeating}} the Allied army as thoroughly as he wanted, but historians and enthusiasts alike recognize that the original plan provided a significant victory, comparable to other great tactical battles such as Cannae. Some historians suggest that Napoleon was so successful at Austerlitz that he lost <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>reality,</b> and what used to be French foreign policy became a [...] "personal Napoleonic one" [...] after the battle. In French history, Austerlitz is acknowledged as an impressive military victory, and in the 19th century, when fascination with the First Empire was at its height, the battle was revered by the likes of Victor Hugo, who [...] "in the depth of [...] thoughts" [...] was hearing the [...] "noise of the heavy cannon rolling towards Austerlitz." [...] In the 2005 bicentennial, however, controversy erupted when neither French President Jacques Chirac nor Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin attended any functions commemorating the battle. On the other hand, some residents of France's overseas departments protested against what they viewed as the [...] "official commemoration of Napoleon," [...] arguing that Austerlitz should not be celebrated since they believed that Napoleon committed genocide against colonial people.|$|E
50|$|The spies are {{frequently}} depicted {{as out of}} <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> the <b>realities</b> of Irish life. They are also often depicted as individuals highly unsuited for espionage. At times, the absurdities take on a comic dimension - {{such as in the}} arrest of Henry Obed, an Indian working for Abwehr. It is notable that the German plans for Operation Green (the intended invasion of Ireland) also included a considerable amount of outdated information.|$|R

500|$|In a 1991 {{interview}} with People, Barr described {{herself as an}} [...] "incest survivor", accusing both of her parents of physical and sexual abuse, claims which they and Geraldine publicly denied. Melvin Belli, her parents' lawyer, {{said that they had}} passed a lie detector test [...] "with flying colors". Barr was even part of an incest recovery group, something she said her parents knew about but for which they were [...] "in denial". On February 14, 2011, Barr and Geraldine appeared on The Oprah Winfrey Show where Barr admitted that the word [...] "incest" [...] could have been the wrong word to use and should have waited until her therapy was over before revealing the [...] "darkest time" [...] in her life. She told Oprah, [...] "I was in a very unhappy relationship and I was prescribed numerous psychiatric drugs... to {{deal with the fact that}} I had some mental illness... I totally lost <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>reality...</b> (and) I didn’t know what the truth was... I just wanted to drop a bomb on my family".

Geraldine said they did not speak for 12 years, but had recently reconciled.|$|E
500|$|... "Trust" [...] was {{released}} as the record's lead single. The song was developed from [...] "Absolution", an instrumental track recorded on a demo during the studio sessions {{of their previous}} album. [...] "Trust" [...] peaked at number five on the US Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks, thus becoming the band's highest charting song on that chart. It was nominated for [...] "Best Metal Performance" [...] at the 1998 Grammy Awards. [...] "Almost Honest" [...] was the second single of the album, and like its predecessor, it managed to enter the Top 10 on Billboards Mainstream Rock Chart. Mustaine stated that the song is about how people treat one another, which contains a message that [...] "it's {{difficult for people to}} be honest". Billboards Chuck Taylor commented that the song contains catchy hooks and the band's [...] "signature guitar howl" [...] and classified it [...] "somewhere between Def Leppard and Bon Jovi". [...] "Use the Man" [...] and [...] "A Secret Place" [...] were released as the third and fourth single, respectively. [...] "Use the Man" [...] (which started with a snippet of The Searchers' [...] "Needles and Pins", which was removed in the 2004 remaster) is about drug addiction, while [...] "A Secret Place" [...] describes losing <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>reality.</b>|$|E
500|$|Schwartz {{wrote in}} August 1980 that [...] "...the pilot episode manages to stuff nearly every imaginable aspect of low life into its first hour: prostitution, panhandling, pickpocketing, hostage taking, drug {{addiction}} and, finally, {{the murder of}} two policemen." [...] William Beamon of The Evening Independent noted that the opening episode introduces the audience to {{a vast array of}} characters masterfully intertwined in the storyline in a way that gives the series a [...] "powerful start". A review in the Spartanburg Herald-Journal commented that public defender Davenport's role adds professional intrigue that heightens the provocative nature of their illicit romance. However, The Miami News Jicha speculates that the romance was contrived to make the police show enticing to audiences. Jicha notes that the attack upon the police depicts the uncertainty of the daily life in law enforcement, but that the introduction of Belker's persona shows the writers are a bit out of <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>reality.</b> Buckley's review in The New York Times claimed the episode [...] "veers back and forth between comic situations that aren't funny, serious matters that aren't that convincing and a romance that is merely silly" [...] and stated that various lighting and acting techniques were unsuccessful. The Boston Globe Henry III wrote that [...] "The redeeming virtue is a visual style reminiscent of documentaries — hand-held camera, saturated color, deliberately ragged editing." [...] He also described the show as [...] "a wacky, black-comic and frequently scary portrait of life in a big city police station". Buckley claimed that the show attempts to present an entire force of police officers with foibles that make them unfit for duty. Henry describes the shooting of the officers as an [...] "appallingly realistic random shooting", but since they were not found for hours, he describes their survival and recovery in the next episode, [...] "Presidential Fever", as miraculous.|$|E
