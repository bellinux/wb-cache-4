5|$|Early on {{the third}} day, Lindwall bowled Edrich for 28 with the score at 64, before Compton and Hutton {{consolidated}} the innings with a partnership of 61 in 110 minutes. On 39, Compton aimed a hard cut shot from Johnston's bowling, which flew into Lindwall's left hand at second slip. Hutton managed to continue resisting the Australians before Miller struck Crapp {{in the head with}} a bouncer. Hutton then edged Miller to Tallon and was out for 64, having top-scored in both innings. He had batted for over four hours and left England at 153/4. Thereafter, England collapsed. Crapp was bowled by Miller for nine, and two runs later, Ring dismissed debutant Watkins for two to take his only wicket. Lindwall returned and bowled Evans for eight. Evans appeared to not detect Lindwall's yorker in <b>the</b> <b>fading</b> <b>light,</b> and the umpires called off play due to bad light. The ground was then hit by rain, resulting in a premature end to the day's play. England had lost four wickets for 25 runs to end at 178/7.|$|E

25|$|During the crisis, {{the men in}} La Carrera's {{and part}} of Belveder's {{divisions}} were able to form into brigade squares. Kellermann organized a second attack against the unbroken squares but the Spanish soldiers held steady and repelled the French cavalry. Since his infantry were still far in the rear, Kellermann tried to fix the enemy squares in place by launching partial charges. For {{two and a half}} hours, this tactic succeeded in pinning down the Spanish soldiers on the west bank. Marchand's infantry and artillery finally appeared on the horizon. Realizing that his men would be annihilated by a combined arms attack, La Carrera ordered an immediate retreat. The French cavalry rushed forward and inflicted further losses, but most of the Spanish troops got away over the bridge in <b>the</b> <b>fading</b> <b>light.</b> Marchand's leading brigade cleared some of Losada's rallied men out of the town of Alba and captured two more artillery pieces.|$|E
25|$|Australia {{were left}} to chase 449 for the victory and made a strong start, {{reaching}} 139 by {{the close of the}} fourth day without losing a wicket, and went on to 208 before Fraser had Slater (103, 10 fours) caught by Tufnell. An hour later, after a rain-lengthened lunch break, Malcolm uprooted Taylor's off stump for 113 and the intent to chase was quelled. Boon batted for an hour and three-quarters for 17, but after his dismissal Fraser (5–73) made the most of the damp conditions, delivering a series of seaming deliveries to the Australian middle order that saw Bevan, both Waugh brothers and Healy returned to the pavilion, Rhodes taking three catches. <b>The</b> <b>fading</b> <b>light</b> saw Hick, Tufnell and Gooch bowling at this critical time instead of Gough and Malcolm, with Warne and May batting out the last hour to save the draw, Malcolm spilled a catch from Warne off {{what appeared to be the}} final delivery of the match and the players walked off thinking the game was over, only to realise by the time they got to the pitch edge that there was still time for one more over.|$|E
500|$|Mikawa {{decided to}} take his fleet north of Buka Island and then down {{the east coast of}} Bougainville. The fleet would pause east of Kieta for six hours on the morning of August 8.

500|$|Early on {{the third}} day, Lindwall bowled Edrich—who was playing across the line—for 28, hitting the off stump with a ball that cut inwards to leave England’s score at 64, before Compton and Hutton {{consolidated}} the innings and took the total to 2/121 at lunch. Soon after, with his score on 39, Compton aimed a hard cut shot that flew into Lindwall's left hand at second slip for a [...] "freak slip catch" [...] from Johnston's bowling; leaving England at 3/125. Lindwall returned for another spell after lunch and bowled Evans for eight. Evans appeared to not detect Lindwall's yorker in <b>the</b> <b>fading</b> <b>light,</b> and the umpires called off play due to poor visibility after an appeal by Yardley. The next morning, England were bowled out for 188, giving Australia an innings victory and the series 4–0. Lindwall took 3/50 to total 9/70 for the match. He ended the Tests as the leading wicket-taker with 27 wickets at 19.62, and scored 191 runs at 31.83.|$|E
500|$|In 1941, Secretary of the Interior Harold Ickes hired Adams for {{six months}} to create {{photographs}} of lands {{under the jurisdiction of}} the Department of the Interior. Wright accompanied Adams and his young son Michael Adams on a long road trip around the west. While traveling through the Chama River valley near nightfall on November 1, 1941, they encountered a [...] "fantastic scene", a church and cemetery near Hernandez, New Mexico, and pulled to the side of the road. Adams recalled that he yelled at his son Michael and at Wright to [...] "Get this! Get that, for God's sake! We don't have much time!" [...] Desperate to capture the image in <b>the</b> <b>fading</b> <b>light,</b> they scrambled to set up the tripod and camera, knowing that only moments remained before the light was gone. The result was Moonrise, Hernandez, New Mexico, a photograph that became so popular and collectible that Adams personally made over 1,300 photographic prints of it during his long career. [...] On October 17, 2006, Sotheby's auctioned a print of this photograph for $609,600. [...] Art historian H. W. Janson called this photo [...] "a perfect marriage of straight and pure photography".|$|E
500|$|Several weeks later, {{she made}} a {{cautious}} transit of the recently mined Suez Canal and reached Alexandria on 10 March. 829 Squadron was issued Fairey Swordfish torpedo bombers to replace its losses around this time. On 20 March Formidable escorted a convoy to Malta and flew off five aircraft for Crete while returning to Alexandria. On the morning of 27 March, major elements of the Italian Fleet were spotted {{en route to the}} sea lanes between Egypt and Greece, and the carrier sailed later that afternoon to intercept them. Reinforced by three Fulmars from 806 Squadron, her air group only numbered 13 Fulmars, 10 Albacores and 4 Swordfish. An Albacore spotted the leading Italian ships the next morning; a strike force of six Albacores was loaded with torpedoes and began to attack the [...] Two German Junkers Ju 88 bombers intervened, but they were driven off by the escorting pair of Fulmars. The attack was unsuccessful, and another strike force of three Albacores and two Swordfish was prepared. Shortly after launching them at 12:22, Formidable was unsuccessfully attacked by a pair of torpedo-carrying Savoia-Marchetti SM.79 bombers. Around 14:50, one Albacore succeeded in torpedoing the Italian battleship, although the other aircraft missed. The hit briefly knocked out her engines and caused heavy flooding. Another air strike of six Albacores and two Swordfish was launched at 17:30 to finish off the crippled battleship, but they mistook the [...] for the battleship in <b>the</b> <b>fading</b> <b>light.</b> The cruiser was struck by a single torpedo from one of the aircraft, possibly from one of two Swordfish from 815 Squadron from Maleme, Crete, that linked up with Formidables aircraft before the attack. The mistake allowed the battleship to reach port. One Albacore was shot down by Vittorio Veneto, and two others were forced to ditch after running out of fuel during the day's operations.|$|E

2500|$|Merville {{had already}} been bombed. Over {{the course of the}} day the {{squadron}} engaged the Luftwaffe whenever they took off. At 19:30 GMT 43 squadron engaged He 111s from III./Kampfgeschwader 54 which were bombing the marshalling yards in Lille. 85 and 605 Squadrons {{had already been}} in action with the formation. The bombers were not protected and Carey claimed three destroyed and two damaged. He was officially credited with only two destroyed—his first solo victories. In <b>the</b> <b>fading</b> <b>light</b> the squadron intercepted another He 111 formation, this time from I./Kampfgeschwader 27. Carey was credited with one destroyed. Two claims were made but the squadron lost two Hurricanes from accurate return fire but pilots survived. According to Carey's combat report, the radios were useless and pilots had to act independently and not as a fighting unit. The air battles in this sector on 10 May 1940 had cost 8./KG 54 six He 111s plus another damaged. Stab./Lehrgeschwader 1 lost four aircraft and one damaged. II. and III./KG 27 lost two shot down and four damaged. One 607 and two 85 Squadron Hurricanes force-landed after being hit by return fire.|$|E

Cleburne began his advance at 6:00pm; by now the sun had set and twilight was upon Winfrey Field, a small meadow through which the 33rd advanced, with the 18th Alabama to its left, and the 16th Alabama and the 45th, 32nd and 15th Mississippi regiments to its right. Three artillery batteries were placed in support, though in the gathering darkness they had potential to inflict as much damage on their friends as on the enemy. [...] This enemy consisted of the 5th Kentucky, 1st Ohio and 32nd Indiana Infantry Regiments (belonging to Baldwin's and Willich's brigades of the Federal Army), who awaited them just behind a split rail fence near the treeline.|$|E
