500|$|The 1950s saw Hepburn take on {{a series}} of {{professional}} challenges, and stretch herself further than at any other point in her life at an age when most other actresses began to retreat. Berg describes the decade as [...] "the heart of her vast legacy" [...] and [...] "the period in which she truly came into her own." [...] In January 1950, Hepburn ventured into Shakespeare, playing Rosalind in As You Like It. She hoped to prove that she could play already established material, and said, [...] "It's better to try something difficult and flop than <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>it</b> <b>safe</b> all the time." [...] It opened at the Cort Theatre in New York to a capacity audience, and was virtually sold out for 148 shows. The production then went on tour. Reviews for Hepburn varied, but she was noted as the only leading-lady in Hollywood who was performing high-caliber material onstage.|$|E
500|$|Lynsey Hanley {{writing for}} The Daily Telegraph {{described}} [...] "Girl" [...] as an obvious {{choice for a}} single and hailed it as [...] "Beyoncé's requisite feminist anthem". A reviewer from Billboard magazine felt that the band's [...] "personal transition from teen-dom to womanhood" [...] was most evident on [...] "Girl" [...] among other songs. Slant Magazine's Eic Henderson {{felt that it was}} a [...] "smooth bump-and-grinder... almost sunk by the group's hyperbolic vocal arrangements". Vibes writer Dimitri Enrlich concluded, [...] "Destiny's Child refuses <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>it</b> <b>safe</b> with cookie-cutter formulas" [...] something he found evident on [...] "Girl". The Observer reviewer Kitty Empire noted that the band's characteristic female solidarity, [...] "is limply expressed in 'Girl', on which they purport to be your best friend". While reviewing #1's, Thomas Inskeep from Stylus Magazine described the song as [...] "lovely". Jess Harvell writing for Pitchfork Media opined, [...] "'Girl' was a stroll over a 9th Wonder-produced Dramatics sample through bros-before-hoes territory as latte frothy as its 'Sex & the City' video." [...] Idolator's Mike Wass gave a more mixed review for [...] "Girl" [...] describing it as [...] "slightly sappy".|$|E

Jamie Milton from musicOMH was also favourable, saying: [...] "When Blunt sticks <b>to</b> <b>playing</b> <b>it</b> <b>safe,</b> he offends the least.

Not long after, the housekeeper called back telling Capra that when Anson heard the news, he had a heart attack and died. Subsequently, Capra offered the part to 58 year-old Henry B. Walthall. He died before shooting began. Finally, <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>it</b> <b>safer</b> age-wise, Capra cast Sam Jaffe who was just 45.|$|R
2500|$|Chad Childers of Loudwire {{stated that}} [...] "the album {{as a whole}} {{continues}} to expand their world-view writing like what listeners got with A Thousand Suns, but it also adds more of the anger that was prevalent in their earliest work, Hybrid Theory." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic declared that [...] "there is definition to their structure, some of the choruses catch hold without too much effort -- but this album remains one of sustained mood, not individual moments" [...] and concludes that the album is [...] "a fitting soundtrack for aging rap-rockers who are comfortable in their skin but restless at heart". The Guardian writer Dave Simpson observed that [...] "Living Things is more personal than A Thousand Suns, with underlying themes of recovery from traumatic experiences. The exception, Burn It Down, delivers an antiwar sentiment via Depeche Mode-y electro-bounce, while the similarly standout Roads Untraveled is an eerie confessional ballad", and concluded that [...] "Living Things would have benefited from more of such adventure, but they still sound like a band enjoying an unexpected second life". Johan Wippsson of Melodic wrote that the album is [...] "too little too pop-oriented and made for the charts than before. The synthesizers are a bit too intent to Coldplay mode, but assume that the band felt {{it was time to}} conquer the charts again." [...] PopMatters' Jordan Blum concluded that “Living Things is a very good entry that’s simply not as special as its precursor." [...] Phil Mongredien from The Observer comments on their refusal <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>it</b> <b>safe</b> and praises their boldness.|$|E
2500|$|During bidding, a team may declare either Big Mo or Little Mo, {{meaning they}} intend {{to take the first}} several tricks. [...] This is the only time that {{cross-talk}} during the bidding is allowed. [...] A player considering a Mo may ask his teammate [...] "How many do you have on the Mo?" [...] or some similar question to determine how many tricks the teammate can contribute to the Mo without revealing any details as to which tricks they'll take. [...] The only detail that can be discussed is which teammate will be leading the first trick but not how they will be leading. [...] If a team declares Little Mo, they must take the first 7 tricks of the hand. [...] Accomplishing the Little Mo earns the team 150 points. [...] If a team declares Big Mo, they must take the first 10 tricks of the hand. [...] Accomplishing the Big Mo earns the team 250 points. [...] Taking more consecutive tricks than needed does not earn the team more points. [...] For instance, taking the first 10 tricks when a Little Mo had been declared still only earns the team 150 points. [...] The team that declares either Mo is immune to bags for that hand and will lead the first trick, regardless of whose turn it was to lead. [...] Failure to accomplish the declared Mo (the opposing team took a trick before the goal was met) will cause the team to lose the points they would have earned had they been successful. [...] This is true regardless of how many tricks they took before or after the opposing team took a trick. [...] The other team bids and must match their bid, as usual. [...] It's not unusual for a team that could do a Big Mo to declare a Little Mo <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>it</b> <b>safe</b> and then take the extra tricks to try to set their opponents.|$|E

500|$|Dek Hogan of Digital Spy stated he [...] "really enjoyed" [...] {{the episode}} {{and it was}} [...] "beautifully dark". He later {{described}} it as [...] "a chilling tale" [...] and [...] "a cracker". Now Playing magazine reviewer Arnold T Blumburg gave [...] "The Unquiet Dead" [...] a grade of A-, describing it as [...] "spectacular", though he noted there were [...] "a few hiccups, such as the weak and convenient plot point that forces the Gelth ... to be drawn out of their human hosts by {{the mere presence of}} gas". He also criticised Eccleston for making the Doctor appear an [...] "ineffectual goof", and noted that he played no role in the resolution. In 2013, Mark Braxton of Radio Times described the episode as [...] "a sparkling script, as crisp and inviting as a winter wonderland", praising the magical atmosphere and the treatment of Dickens. However, he felt that [...] "the spectral swirlings are all a bit Raiders of the Lost Ark". In Who Is the Doctor, a guide to the revived series, Graeme Burk felt that [...] "The Unquiet Dead" [...] was [...] "terribly, terribly disappointing" [...] on first viewing, as Rose and the Doctor's characterisation did not drive the plot and the story was reduced <b>to</b> <b>playing</b> <b>it</b> <b>safe</b> and being [...] "ordinary", as it just made the aliens evil instead of discussing their morality. Despite this, he wrote that the story was still enjoyable, with a [...] "delightfully ludicrous" [...] set-up, [...] "vividly realized" [...] period setting, and the characterisation of Dickens. Burk's coauthor, Robert Smith? , called the episode a [...] "complete mess". He felt that Gatiss was attempting to recreate the classic series, but that it came across as [...] "half-hearted". He felt that there was no moral dilemma and Sneed underwent an unsettling character change. While he noted that Eccleston and Piper were [...] "excellent", he felt that Rose and the Doctor's developing relationship was not subtle.|$|R

There's a futility in what she does. The shape of the track is her life, round and round, going nowhere. But the pros, the real skaters who worked with me, they were terrific.
