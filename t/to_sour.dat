5|$|Marguerite Louise's caprices lead <b>to</b> <b>sour</b> {{relations}} with the family. She argued with the Grand Duchess Vittoria over precedence, and with Grand Duke Ferdinando over her spending. Her spending habits not only spelled conflict with the Grand Duke, but made her unpopular with the Florentines. This was compounded by her unseemly conduct, such as the two grooms who frequented her chamber at all hours.|$|E
5|$|A pisco sour is an {{alcoholic}} cocktail of Peruvian origin that {{is typical of}} the cuisines from Chile and Peru, considered also a South American classic. The drink's name comes from pisco, which is its base liquor, and the cocktail term sour, in reference <b>to</b> <b>sour</b> citrus juice and sweetener components. The Peruvian pisco sour uses Peruvian pisco as the base liquor and adds freshly squeezed lime juice, syrup, ice, egg white, and Angostura bitters. The Chilean version is similar, but uses Chilean pisco and pica lime, and excludes the bitters and egg white. Other variants of the cocktail include those created with fruits like pineapple or plants such as coca leaves.|$|E
5|$|As {{with many}} Cornish and Devonian icons, clotted cream has become entrenched in local folklore. For example, one myth tells of Jenny who enticed the giant Blunderbore (sometimes called Moran) by feeding him clotted cream. He {{eventually}} {{fell in love}} with her and made her his fourth wife. Another myth, from Dartmoor, tells of a princess who wanted to marry an elven prince, but according to tradition had to bathe in pure cream first. Unfortunately, a witch who wanted the prince for her daughter kept souring the cream. Eventually, the prince offered the princess clotted cream, which the witch was unable <b>to</b> <b>sour.</b>|$|E

5|$|A BBC {{documentary}} entitled Panorama: Buying the Games, {{aired in}} August 2004, investigated {{the taking of}} bribes in the bidding process for the 2012 Summer Olympics. The documentary claimed {{it was possible to}} bribe IOC members into voting for a particular candidate city. After being narrowly defeated in their bid for the 2012 Summer Games, Parisian mayor Bertrand Delanoë specifically accused the British prime minister Tony Blair and the London Bid Committee (headed by former Olympic champion Sebastian Coe) of breaking the bid rules. He cited French president Jacques Chirac as a witness; Chirac gave guarded interviews regarding his involvement. The allegation was never fully explored. The Turin bid for the 2006 Winter Olympics was also shrouded in controversy. A prominent IOC member, Marc Hodler, strongly connected with the rival bid of Sion, Switzerland, alleged bribery of IOC officials by members of the Turin Organising Committee. These accusations led to a wide-ranging investigation. The allegations also served <b>to</b> <b>sour</b> many IOC members against Sion's bid and potentially helped Turin to capture the host city nomination.|$|E
5|$|After {{the start}} of World War II, Gheorghe Tătărescu {{initiated}} a move to rally political forces in opposition to Ion Antonescu's dictatorship, and sought an alliance with the Romanian Communist Party (PCR). He was twice expelled from the PNL, in 1938 and 1944, creating instead his own group, the National Liberal Party-Tătărescu, and representing it inside the Communist-endorsed Petru Groza cabinet. In 1946-1947, {{he was also the}} President of the Romanian Delegation to the Peace Conference in Paris. After that moment, relations between Tătărescu and the PCR began <b>to</b> <b>sour,</b> and he was replaced from the leadership of both his own party and the Foreign Ministry when his name was implicated in the Tămădău Affair. Following the Communist takeover, he was arrested and held as a political prisoner, while being called to testify in the trial of Lucrețiu Pătrășcanu. He died soon after his release from prison.|$|E
5|$|The {{years that}} {{followed}} witnessed cordial relations between Mysore and the British until things began <b>to</b> <b>sour</b> in the 1820s. Even though the Governor of Madras, Thomas Munro, determined after a personal investigation in 1825 {{that there was no}} substance to the allegations of financial impropriety made by A. H. Cole, the incumbent Resident of Mysore, the Nagar rebellion (a civil insurrection) which broke out {{towards the end of the}} decade changed things considerably. In 1831, close on the heels of the insurrection and citing mal-administration, the British took direct control of the princely state. For the next fifty years, Mysore passed under the rule of successive British Commissioners; Sir Mark Cubbon, renowned for his statesmanship, served from 1834 until 1861 and put into place an efficient and successful administrative system which left Mysore a well-developed state.|$|E

5|$|No {{congressional hearing}} was convened to {{investigate}} the misallocation of funds by Powell, and neither Cope nor Marsh was held responsible for any of their mistakes, but some of Ballou's charges against Marsh came {{to be associated with}} the Survey. Facing anti-Survey sentiment inflamed by western drought and concerns about takeovers of abandoned western homesteads, Powell found himself the subject of larger scrutiny before the House Appropriations Committee. Galvanized to action by Marsh's perceived extravagance with Survey funds, the Appropriations Committee demanded the Survey's budget be itemized. When his appropriation was cut off in 1892, Powell sent a terse telegram to Marsh demanding his resignation, a personal slight as well as a financial one. At the same time, many of Marsh's allies were retiring or had died, lessening his scientific credence. Just as Marsh's extravagant lifestyle was catching up with him, Cope received a position on the Texas Geological Survey. Cope, still reeling from the personal attacks levied at him during the Herald affair, did not take advantage of the change in fortunes to press his personal attacks. Cope's fortunes continued to look up throughout the early 1890s, as he was promoted to Leidy's position as Professor of Zoology and was elected President of the American Association for the Advancement of Science the same year that Marsh stepped down as head of the Academy of Sciences. Towards the latter part of the decade, Cope's fortunes began <b>to</b> <b>sour</b> once more as Marsh regained some of his recognition, earning the Cuvier Medal, the highest paleontological award.|$|E
5|$|Professor Bernard Quatermass {{was first}} {{introduced}} to audiences in two BBC television serials, The Quatermass Experiment (1953) and Quatermass II (1955), written by Nigel Kneale. The rights to both these serials were acquired by Hammer Film Productions, and the film adaptations – The Quatermass Xperiment and Quatermass 2, both directed by Val Guest and starring Brian Donlevy as Quatermass – were released in 1955 and 1957 respectively. Kneale went on to write a third Quatermass serial – Quatermass and the Pit – for the BBC, which was broadcast in December 1958 and January 1959. Hammer were once again interested in making a film adaptation, and Kneale, who had by then left the BBC and {{was working as a}} freelance screenwriter, completed a script in 1961. It was intended that Val Guest would once again direct and Brian Donlevy would reprise the role of Quatermass, with production to commence in 1963. However, securing finance for the new Quatermass film proved problematic. In 1957 Hammer had struck a deal with Columbia Pictures to distribute their pictures, and the two companies would go on to collaborate on thirty films between 1957 and 1964. Columbia, who were not interested in Quatermass, passed on the script and production went into limbo for several years. In 1964 Kneale and Anthony Hinds submitted a revised, lower-budget script to Columbia; but by this time the relationship between Hammer and Columbia had begun <b>to</b> <b>sour,</b> and the script was once again rejected. In 1966 Hammer entered into a new distribution deal with Seven Arts, ABPC and Twentieth Century Fox, and Quatermass and the Pit finally entered production.|$|E
5|$|When {{the time}} came for {{developmental}} and operational testing of the SAW candidates, three 5.56mm candidate weapons were included with the 6mm candidates: the M16 HBAR, a heavy-barrel variant of the M16 designed for prolonged firing; the Fabrique Nationale de Herstal (FN) Minimi; and the HK 23A1. The initial round of tests ended in December 1974. In February 1976, the Minimi and Rodman XM235 SAW were selected for further development. At this time, opinions of the 6mm cartridge were beginning <b>to</b> <b>sour</b> due to the logistical implications of providing yet another ammunition type to the infantry. In June, it was requested that the SAW specifications document be revised to emphasize standard 5.56mm ammunition. In October, the requested revisions were approved, and bids were solicited for {{the conversion of the}} Rodman XM235 to 5.56mm. Production of the converted XM235 was awarded to Ford Aerospace, and its designation was changed to XM248. A new M16 HBAR variant, the XM106, was developed in 1978, and soon after, Heckler & Koch lobbied to include a 5.56mm conversion of its HK 21A1 (instead of the standard 7.62mm NATO ammunition it was built for) in future SAW testing. The latter model was designated the XM262. At this time, the Minimi received the designation XM249. Testing of the four candidates resumed in April 1979.|$|E
