The increase of traffic due to World War II was more than the UT could handle with their existing two ancient 4-4-0 engines, cars, and facilities.

40|$|Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) {{is a form}} of Public-Private Partnerships that is {{commonly}} used to close the growing gap between the cost of developing and modernizing transportation infrastructure systems and the financial resources available to governments. When assessing the feasibility of a BOT project, private investors consider revenue risk - which is stemmed from the uncertainty about future traffic demand - as a critical factor. A potential approach to mitigating the revenue risk is the offering of revenue risk sharing mechanisms such as Minimum Revenue Guarantee options by the government. In addition to Minimum Revenue Guarantee options, a mechanism known as <b>Traffic</b> <b>Revenue</b> Cap options may also be negotiated, which makes the government entitled to a share of revenue when it grows beyond a specified threshold. Financial valuation of investments in BOT projects should take into account uncertainty about future traffic demand, as well as Minimum Revenue Guarantee and <b>Traffic</b> <b>Revenue</b> Cap options. The conventional valuation methods including Net Present Value (NPV) analysis are not capable of integrating the uncertainty about future traffic demand in the valuation of BOT projects and properly pricing Minimum Revenue Guarantee and <b>Traffic</b> <b>Revenue</b> Cap options. Real options analysis can be used as an alternative approach to valuation of investments in transportation projects under uncertainties. However, the appropriate application of real options analysis to valuation of investments in transportation projects is conditioned upon overcoming specific theoretical challenges. Current real options models do not provide a systematic method for estimating the project volatility, which measures the variability of investment value. Existing models do not provide a method for calculating the market value of Minimum Revenue Guarantee and <b>Traffic</b> <b>Revenue</b> Cap options. Also, current models are not able to characterize the impact of Minimum Revenue Guarantee and <b>Traffic</b> <b>Revenue</b> Cap options on private investors' financial risk profile. The overarching objective of this research is to apply the real options theory in order to price Minimum Revenue Guarantee and <b>Traffic</b> <b>Revenue</b> Cap options under the uncertainty about future traffic demand. To achieve this objective, a real options model is created that characterizes the long-term traffic demand uncertainty in BOT projects and determines investors' financial risk profile under uncertainty about future traffic demand. This model presents a novel method for estimating the project volatility for real options analysis. This model devises a market-based option pricing approach to determine the correct value of Minimum Revenue Guarantee and <b>Traffic</b> <b>Revenue</b> Cap options. An appropriate procedure is created for characterizing the impact of Minimum Revenue Guarantee and <b>Traffic</b> <b>Revenue</b> Cap options on the investors' financial risk profile. The proposed real options model is applied to a BOT project to illustrate the valuation process. The limitations of the proposed real options model, as well as the barriers to its implementation, are identified and recommendations for future research are offered. This research contributes to the state of knowledge by presenting a new method for estimating the project volatility, which is required for the real options analysis of transportation investments. It also introduces a risk-neutral valuation method for pricing the market value of Minimum Revenue Guarantee and <b>Traffic</b> <b>Revenue</b> Cap options in BOT projects. The research also contributes to the state of practice by introducing a novel class of assessment tools for decision makers that characterize the investors' financial risk profile under uncertainty about future traffic demand. Proper methods for pricing of Minimum Revenue Guarantee and <b>Traffic</b> <b>Revenue</b> Cap options are useful to public and private investors, in order to avoid wasting capital in transportation projects.

40|$|Despite massive {{investment}} opportunities {{and the establishment}} of a framework for private sector participation in highway infrastructure development programmes in India, private investment (including foreign direct investment) in this sector is not up to the expected level. A high degree of risk exposure, disagreement on many risk issues among major stakeholders, and the absence of adequate government guarantees have been identified as some of the major reasons for this lukewarm response. This paper discusses the outcome of a risk perception analysis carried out to evaluate the risk criticality, risk management capability, risk allocation/sharing preference, and factors influencing risk acceptance of major stakeholders. A survey was conducted among senior project participants such as government officials, promoters, lenders and consultants of Indian BOT road projects. Eight types of risks have been identified as very critical in the Indian road sector under BOT set up with <b>traffic</b> <b>revenue</b> risk being the most critical. Though there is fair agreement among survey respondents with respect to the risk management capabilities of stakeholders, their preferences of allocations are divergent. The significant factors influencing the risk acceptance of each stakeholder are identified through regression analysis. The study reveals that the factors and their relative influence on the risk acceptance of stakeholders are considerably different.

40|$|Over the years, {{many private}} sector {{participation}} (PSP) {{models have been}} evolved for infrastructure procurement and the Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) model {{is one of the}} most common approaches used for the same. Private infrastructure projects under BOT arrangement have a complex risk profile and to a considerable extent, the success of any BOT project is influenced by the degree to which various project risks are managed. The major steps involved in risk management of a project are risk identification, risk assessment and the processes of prioritization and response to the risks. The conventional risk assessment approaches may not be effective in privatized infrastructure projects because of the fact that, they have very long project lifecycle with many country and sector specific risk factors. The assessment of complex risks is often a difficult task when past data on similar risks are not available. In this research, a risk probability and impact assessment framework based on fuzzy-fault tree and the Delphi method is proposed. The framework includes extensive scenario modelling of critical risks in projects and systematic processing of professional judgement (subjective knowledge) of experts and is developed and demonstrated in the context of critical risks in Indian BOT road projects. Detailed scenario modelling of most critical risks such as <b>traffic</b> <b>revenue</b> risk, delay in land acquisition, demand risk and delay in financial closure are also presented. The proposed risk assessment framework is generic and can be applied with appropriate modifications to suit any complex developmental project where past data is inadequate for risk assessment.
