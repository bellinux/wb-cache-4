40|$|The {{campaign}} in East Africa that lasted from August 1914 to November 1918 was quite unlike those fought in Europe or the Middle East. Apart from the significant physical differences {{and the fact}} that British troops were usually in the minority, the East African Expeditionary Force had two South African officers as commanders-in-chief during the bulk of the active offensive operations. The first was Lieutenant General Jan Christiaan Smuts (February 1916 – January 1917), the noted politician, lawyer and thinker, while the second was Lieutenant General Sir Jacob (Jaap) Louis van Deventer (May 1917 - November 1918), an undeservedly forgotten. Although the two men had a long association in peace and war, their personalities, command style and ultimate achievements were very different. It is the aim of this article to examine the background to the war in East Africa, their <b>tenure</b> <b>in</b> the <b>chief</b> command, including the constraints under which they operated, and to assess their performance. </p...|$|R

50|$|However, the Sarawak United Peoples' Party (SUPP) and Sarawak National Party (SNAP) {{directed}} {{their support}} towards Taib. SUPP also started {{to persuade the}} federal government to support Taib in the crisis. This was because SUPP would not want Abdul Rahman to be back in power again because Rahman was responsible for the weakening of SUPP in 1978 by allowing Democratic Action Party (DAP) to enter Sarawak and also the policy of Islamisation adopted by Rahman during his <b>tenure</b> <b>in</b> office as <b>chief</b> minister. Meanwhile, for SNAP, James Wong was not in favour for Abdul Rahman because he was detained at Kamunting Detention Centre for 18 months under Internal Security Act when he was the opposition leader against Barisan Nasional in 1974 parliamentary elections. Abdul Rahman was believed to have advocated his arrest by accusing him of seceding the Limbang territory to Brunei. Taib also threatened to cancel SNAP's logging concessions if James Wong were to switched to Rahman's side.|$|R

5000|$|The {{nature of}} Anglo-Saxon land tenure was {{substantially}} {{changed by the}} Norman conquest of England in 1066, as all land was then held by the King under Norman feudal control. The King's tenants <b>in</b> <b>chief</b> held their land in return for provision of men at arms to the King. However, {{the changes in the}} nature of tenure were not absolute. Military service had been a duty of landholders before 1066 and some Anglo-Saxon law and custom continued to apply after the conquest. Domesday does not mention folkland or bookland, but the form of <b>tenure</b> <b>in</b> January 1066 (TRE) is frequently given. Although a variety of wording is used.
