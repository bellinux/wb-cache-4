40|$|Circumstance Descriptors {{are offered}} {{as a way to}} {{organize}} spatial and other military knowledge that may be difficult to formulate, particularly the kinds of details that are most often illustrated by example. The goal is better modeling of military command elements in simulations. <b>These</b> <b>Circumstance</b> Descriptors are applied to assimilate features, both terrain objects and units, into a frame based Understanding of the Situation that organizes these into roles oriented around the decisionmaking unit's plan. A Circumstance represents a configuration of objects that may be present on the battlefield. If recognized, the effect is to splice new roles into the frame, extending it to cover the new features. A prototype has been built which demonstrates the use of <b>these</b> <b>Circumstance</b> Descriptors in both the context of planning and execution...|$|R

5|$|Sallekhana {{differs from}} {{other forms of}} ritual deaths {{recognized}} in Jainism as appropriate.

A ritual death under <b>these</b> <b>circumstances</b> by consuming poison is believed to be better and allows for an auspicious rebirth.|$|E

5|$|Changes in {{direction}} {{of this nature}} are most commonly observed {{as a result of}} a cyclone's interaction with other low pressure systems, troughs, ridges, or with anticyclones. A strong and stationary anticyclone can effectively block the path of an extratropical cyclone. Such blocking patterns are quite normal, and will generally result in a weakening of the cyclone, the weakening of the anticyclone, a diversion of the cyclone towards the anticyclone's periphery, or a combination of all three to some extent depending on the precise conditions. It is also common for an extratropical cyclone to strengthen as the blocking anticyclone or ridge weakens in <b>these</b> <b>circumstances.</b>|$|E

In Yasui the court affirmed his conviction of the misdemeanor, but ordered re-sentencing since the lower court had determined that the curfew was not valid, and that Yasui had forfeited his citizenship.
