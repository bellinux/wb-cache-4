Indeed, Colin Powell, in his address to the U.N. Security Council {{just prior to the}} war, made reference to the aluminum tubes. But a report released by the Institute for Science and International Security in 2002 reported that it was highly unlikely that the tubes could be used to enrich uranium. Powell later admitted he had presented an inaccurate case to the United Nations on Iraqi weapons, and that the intelligence presented was in some cases [...] "deliberately misleading." ...|$|E

A poll conducted last month by WorldPublicOpinion. org finds that seven in ten Americans perceive <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>administration</b> as still <b>saying</b> that Iraq had a major WMD program or actual WMD.

5000|$|Richard Kerr, a 32-year CIA {{veteran who}} served {{three years as}} deputy {{director}} for intelligence, was commissioned to lead a review of agency analysis of Iraqi WMD claims, and produced a series of reports, {{one of which is}} unclassified. Kerr told journalist Robert Dreyfuss that CIA analysts felt intimidated by <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>administration,</b> <b>saying,</b> [...] "A lot of analysts believed that they were being pressured to come to certain conclusions … [...] I {{talked to a lot of}} people who said, 'There was a lot of repetitive questioning. We were being asked to justify what we were saying again and again.' There were certainly people who felt they were being pushed beyond the evidence they had." [...] In a January 26, 2006 interview, Kerr acknowledged this had resulted in open antagonism between some in the CIA and <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> White House, saying, [...] "There have been more leaks and discussions outside what I would consider to be the appropriate level than I've ever seen before. And I think that lack of discipline is a real problem. I don't think an intelligence organization can kind of take up arms against politics, or a policy-maker. I think that will not work, and it won't stand." ...|$|R
5000|$|On January 23, 2004, Kay resigned, {{stating that}} Iraq {{did not have}} WMD and that [...] "I think there were {{stockpiles}} {{at the end of}} the first Gulf War and a combination of U.N. inspectors and unilateral Iraqi action got rid of them." [...] Kay was replaced by Charles Duelfer and spent the following days discussing his discoveries and opinions with the news media and the U.S. political establishment. On January 28, 2004, he testified that “it turns out that we were all wrong” and “I believe that the effort that has been directed to this point has been sufficiently intense that it is highly unlikely that there were large stockpiles of deployed, militarized chemical weapons there.” However, Kay defended <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>administration,</b> <b>saying</b> that even if Iraq did not have weapons stockpiles, this did not mean the it wasn't dangerous. Kay also blamed faulty intelligence gathering for the prewar WMD conclusions. On February 2, 2004, Kay met with George W. <b>Bush</b> at <b>the</b> White House and maintained that Bush was right to go to war in Iraq and characterized Saddam Hussein's government as “far more dangerous than even we anticipated” when it was thought he had WMDs ready to deploy.|$|R
