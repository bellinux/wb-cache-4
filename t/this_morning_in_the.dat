40|$|Langford, {{a leader}} of the second Yellow-stone expedition, wrote in his diary: “Last night, and also <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> <b>in</b> camp, <b>the</b> entire party had a rather unusual discus-sion. The {{proposition}} was made by some member that we utilize the result of our exploration by taking up quarter sections of land at the most prominent points of inter-est, ” specifically, those that “would eventu-ally become a source of great profit to the owners. ” Yet Cornelius Hedges declared “that he did not approve of any of these plans—that there ought to be no private ownership of any portion of that region, but that the whole of it ought to be set aside as a great National Park, and that each one of us ought to make an effort to have this accomplished ” (quoted in Runte 1997 : 41). That was a radical suggestion for 1870. Late 19 th-century American culture was dominated by a spirit of extreme individual-ism (Dustin et al. 2004). As the country moved westward, the settlement and private development of the public domain was a primary goal of public policy. Americans viewed themselves as rugged individualists and 19 th-century governments tended to be limited in scope; few would have foreseen the development of (or need for) the net-work of preserved public lands that arose <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 20 th century. Yet seeds of change were <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wind. American intellectuals <b>in</b> <b>the</b> East were disturbed by the looting of Southwestern Indian ruins and pressed for preservation through government action (Dustin et al. 2004). The pressure they exerted on Congress resulted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Antiquities Act of 1906, which gave presi-dent Theodore Roosevelt the preservation mechanism he needed. Characteristically, Roosevelt acted immediately and with vigor, preserving multiple national monu...|$|R
