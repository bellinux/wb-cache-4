50|$|<b>The</b> eastern <b>American</b> <b>red</b> fox has a {{primarily}} carnivorous diet {{dominated by}} small mammals (Frey, 2013). However, as an opportunistic species they will adopt an omnivorous diet that includes insects, fruits, berries, birds, plants, {{and other small}} animals (Tesky, 1995). Food sources can vary depending on region, but cottontails rabbits (Sylvilagus) {{are the most important}} prey for eastern <b>American</b> <b>red</b> foxes (Frey, 2013). <b>The</b> eastern <b>American</b> <b>red</b> fox will consume larger animals as carrion, and their diet changes depending on seasonal variability (Tesky, 1995).|$|R

50|$|The native {{status of}} <b>the</b> eastern <b>American</b> <b>red</b> fox has been {{demonstrated}} by current research, which {{has important implications for}} management strategies. Previous classifications and taxonomic uncertainties (Kamler & Ballard, 2002) frame populations of Vulpes vulpes fulvus as a nonnative, invasive species that can cause declines in the populations of native species, carrying capacities, and populate regions at higher densities (Kamler & Ballard, 2002). The identification of the origins of <b>the</b> North <b>American</b> <b>red</b> fox populations is crucial in conservation efforts aimed at native versus nonnative species (Statham et al., 2012). Vulpes vulpes fulvus’s presence has been augmenting in the west, an area in which it has not been shown to be native.|$|R

50|$|Phylogeographical {{and genetic}} {{analysis}} of <b>the</b> North <b>American</b> <b>red</b> fox suggests that foxes first migrated to North America during the Illinoian glaciation (300,000 to 130,000 years before present) and spread southward (Aubry et al., 2009) More recently the Wisconsin glaciation (100,000 to 10,000 before present) separated <b>the</b> North <b>American</b> fox population into two distinct areas (Aubry et al., 2009). <b>American</b> <b>red</b> foxes are genetically distinctive from their Eurasian counterparts (Aubry et al., 2009; Frey 2013). Despite claims of historical translocations from Europe, modern red fox {{populations in the}} United States’ southeastern region {{have been shown to}} be native to North America (Statham et al., 2012). DNA comparisons show that <b>the</b> eastern <b>American</b> <b>red</b> fox is closely related to native populations in Canada and the northeastern region of the United States and is therefore the result of natural range expansions and not an invasive species from Europe as was previously thought (Statham et al., 2012). Range expansions seen recently may be connected to anthropogenic landscape change and not the spread of exotic European varieties (Statham et al., 2012).|$|R
