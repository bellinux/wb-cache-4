He {{referred}} to the forming of groups within a city or a rural area {{in the manner of}} hermitage life, among members who do not desire to become renunciants, or cannot do so because of certain obligations. Such a life would enable each one to be in daily association with those who share the same spiritual goal.|$|E

Aller's 1971 suicide had an influential impact on Clinton. British writer and feminist Sara Maitland said of Clinton, [...] "I remember Bill and Frank Aller taking me to a pub in Walton Street in the summer term of 1969 and talking <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Vietnam War. I knew nothing about it, and when Frank began to describe the napalming of civilians I began to cry. Bill said that feeling bad wasn't good enough. That {{was the first time}} I encountered the idea that liberal sensitivities weren't enough and you had to do something about such things". He also developed an interest in rugby union, which he played at Oxford.|$|E
500|$|Friends {{encouraged}} Crittenden to run {{for president}} in the 1848 election. A Nashville newspaper declared its support for him as early as 1846. A Democratic senator from Rhode Island opined that Crittenden could win support from a sizable number of Democrats in addition to the support of his own party. George B. Kinkead desired to have the Kentucky General Assembly nominate Crittenden for president in 1847. None of these overtures swayed Crittenden. [...] "For Heaven's sake don't talk <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Presidency," [...] he said, rebuffing one early offer. Clay hoped Crittenden would again support him, but Crittenden concluded that Clay was no longer a viable candidate and threw his support behind Kentuckian Zachary Taylor. This decision caused a rift between the two friends, and they were not reconciled until years later when Clay lay on his deathbed.|$|E

500|$|Early {{versions}} {{opened with}} the line [...] "Don't talk <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> rights of the IRA, UDA." [...] U2's bassist, Adam Clayton, recalls that better judgment led to the removal of such a politically charged line, and that the song's [...] "viewpoint became very humane and non-sectarian...which, is the only responsible position." [...] The chosen opening line, [...] "I can't believe the news today" [...] crystallises the prevailing response, especially among young people, to the violence in Northern Ireland during the 1970s and 1980s. In successive stanzas, the lyrics paraphrase religious text from Matthew [...] ("mother's children; brothers, sisters torn apart") and bring a twist to 1 Corinthians [...] ("we eat and drink while tomorrow they die", instead of [...] "let us eat and drink; for tomorrow we die"). [...] The song finishes with a call for the Irish to stop fighting each other, and [...] "claim the victory Jesus won...on [...] Sunday bloody Sunday." ...|$|E

2500|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the riots May urged the identification of as many as possible of the young criminals involved. She said: [...] "when I was in Manchester last week, the issue was raised <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> anonymity of juveniles who are found guilty of crimes of this sort. The Crown Prosecution Service is to order prosecutors to apply for anonymity to be lifted in any youth case they think is in the public interest. The law currently protects the identity of any suspect under the age of 18, even if they are convicted, but it also allows for an application to have such restrictions lifted, if deemed appropriate." [...] May added that [...] "what I've asked for is that CPS guidance should go to prosecutors to say that where possible, they should be asking for the anonymity of juveniles who are found guilty of criminal activity to be lifted".|$|E
2500|$|The album's opener, [...] "Sunday Bloody Sunday", {{an ardent}} protest song, {{stems from a}} guitar riff and lyric written by the Edge in 1982. Following an {{argument}} with his girlfriend, and a period of doubt in his own song-writing abilities, the Edge – [...] "feeling depressed... channeled [...] fear and frustration and self-loathing into a piece of music." [...] Early versions of the song opened with the line, [...] "Don't talk <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> rights of the IRA, UDA". After Bono had reworked the lyrics, the band recorded the song. [...] The opening drum pattern soon developed into the song's hook. A local violinist, Steve Wickham, approached the Edge one morning {{at a bus stop}} and asked if U2 had any need for a violin on their next album. [...] In the studio for only half a day, Wickham's electric violin became the final instrumental contribution to the song.|$|E
2500|$|The {{timing of}} the mission was crucial due to the pessimistic {{military}} forecasts and the widespread rumours of an imminent coup. Diệm's Presidential military adviser Dương Văn Minh had recently informed Lodge that 80 percent of Vietnamese people had no motive for supporting Diệm and that the recent lifting of martial law was [...] "eyewash for Americans". Despite his title, Minh had no command power and was confined to primarily ceremonial duties. Diệm feared that Minh had become too popular after his success in the Battle for Saigon against the criminal Bình Xuyên and his campaigns to quell the private armies of the Hòa Hảo and Cao Đài religious sects in the 1950s and had removed him from commanding troops. The two guardhouses outside Minh's headquarters at Tan Son Nhut Air Base were filled with political prisoners, many of them student protestors. Minh was widely believed to be seeking a coup against Diệm. He frequently railed against Diệm in his meeting with Lodge, decrying the police state that was being created by the Cần Lao Party of the Ngô family. Harkins reported that Minh [...] "has done nothing but complain <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> government {{and the way it}} is handled since I have been here". Harkins also put scepticism onto Minh's claims of widespread public disenchantment.|$|E

2500|$|Ralph Parcaut {{was born}} in Iowa on December 3, 1896. His parents, Edward and Eva Parcaut, were farmers who, in 1894, had settled {{on a farm in}} Grant Township an area near Sutherland a small town in O'Brien County, Iowa. [...] They had a family of seven children. From an early age, Parcaut took a keen {{interest}} in wrestling with other boys and began to demonstrate considerable aptitude for the sport. In 1906, at the age of 15, a local wrestling fan, impressed with Parcaut's talent and potential, gave him $100.00, a considerable sum of money at the time, to seek training from famed wrestler and instructor Martin [...] "Farmer" [...] Burns. [...] At the time, Burns operated a school for wrestlers in Omaha, Nebraska where he taught [...] "catch as catch can" [...] or modern day freestyle wrestling and physical training. [...] Parcaut traveled to Omaha, his $100.00 buying him 10 lessons, as Farmer Burns charged $10.00 an hour for one-on-one wrestling instruction with students. [...] Burns instilled in young Parcaut what would become a lifelong regimen of training and most importantly, [...] "clean living." [...] As Parcaut recalled years later, [...] "I'll never forget the first time I met him in Omaha ... All {{the way back to the}} gymnasium he talked <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> evils of drink and of smoking and even urged me not to partake of tea or coffee." ...|$|E
