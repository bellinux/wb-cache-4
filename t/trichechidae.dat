40|$|Extract] The Dugongidae {{is one of}} four {{families}} {{within the}} Sirenia, a mammalian order with a long evolutionary history extending back more than 50 million years. The sirenians are ancestrally related to a superficially dissimilar grouping of other mammals known as the Afrotheria. The afrotherians contain some modern families such as Proboscidea (elephants), Afrosoricida (golden moles and tenrecs), Tubulidentata (aardvarks), Hyracoidea (hyraxes), and Macroscelidea (elephant shrews). The closest contemporary relatives of sirenians are the elephants and hyraxes, and the three groups have been linked together as the clade Paenungulata. At least 35 named species of sirenians have existed through time, ranging in mass from small sea cows weighing an estimated 150 kg to the extinct Steller's Sea Cow (Hydrodamalis gigas) estimated to have weighed more than 10, 000 kg. Some early sirenians walked on land with sturdy hindlimbs but fed on aquatic vegetation. Later forms evolved a variety of foraging strategies, adapting to changing climatic, geologic, oceanographic, a n d biological conditions within the bounds of aquatic megaherbivory. Today only two sirenian families remain: the <b>Trichechidae,</b> containing the three species of manatees that occur {{on both sides of the}} Atlantic, and the Dugongidae, with one species, tl 1 e Dugong, which occurs in the Indo-West Pacific. The ancestors of these families diverged 25 - 40 million years ago. The dugongids were by far the most diverse group of sirenians. The family Dugongidae is divided into three subfamilies: the Halitheriinae, the Dugonginae, and the Hydrodamalinae. The extinct Halitheriinae was the basal group of the dugongids. The Dugonginae arose from them and diversified in the Caribbean and western Atlantic in the Oligocene. They dispersed to other tropical waters of the world in the late Oligocene and early Miocene. A partial postcranial skeleton (vertebrae and ribs) of an indeterminate sirenian has recently been described from a cave in the Hindenburg Range, Western Province of Papua New Guinea. These fossils represent the earliest evidence (c. 11 · 8 million years ago) of Sirenia in Australasian coastal marine ecosystems...|$|E
40|$|The {{evolution}} of the Neogene sirenians along the Euro-North African coasts (southern North Sea, northeastern Atlantic, Mediterranean and Paratethys) has been investigated in correlation with the palaeogeographic and palaeoclimatic {{evolution of}} the region. A better chronostratigraphic setting and a systematic review of the main specimens (listed in a database) have been provided and nine valid Neogene Euro – North African sirenian species have been recognized: Miosiren kocki, Prohalicore dubaleni, Rytiodus capgrandi, Rytiodus sp. from Libya, Metaxytherium krahuletzi, M. medium, M. petersi, M. serresii and M. subapenninum; while “Halitherium” bellunense, previously referred to the Early Miocene, has been determined to be Late Oligocene in age and confirmed to be a dugongine close to Rytiodus spp [...] These species, except Prohalicore dubaleni known only from an incomplete mandible and M. petersi under study by Domning and Pervesler, {{have been included in}} a cladistic analysis. This analysis has been carried out with the PAUP version 40 b 10 program; developed for 31 species of sirenians and the primitive Proboscidea Phosphatherium escuilliei as outgroup, and based on 57 characters of cranium, mandible and dentition. The results confirm the anatomical observations and show a close correspondence between palaeobiogeographic and chronostratigraphic distribution of the taxa and their positions on the tree. A reconstruction of Euro-North African sirenian palaeoecology and palaeobiogeography during the Neogene has been proposed in relation to the long-term trend of climatic cooling and to the decreasing of marine influence, which characterized the {{evolution of the}} region. The sirenian palaeoecology has been reconstructed by combining data from seagrass evolution and ecology, sirenian distribution and morphology, stable isotope (C and O) analyses of sirenian tooth enamel. On the whole, the Neogene Euro-North African sirenians appear to be fully aquatic herbivorous mammals strictly linked to coastal environments. During the Early Miocene, which was a period of global warming, at least three different sirenian lines lived along the Euro-North African coasts: the euryhaline mixed-feeder Miosiren kocki (<b>Trichechidae,</b> Miosireninae), living in isolation on the southernmost margin of the North Sea; the generalist small-tusked Metaxytherium krahuletzi (Dugongidae, Halitheriinae), which appears to have been widespread along the Euro-North African coasts; and the specialized large-tusked genus Rytiodus (Dugongidae, Dugonginae), recorded with confidence just in the Aquitaine Basin (SW France) and in the Sirte Basin (Libya), where it most probably lived sympatrically with Metaxytherium krahuletzi. From the Middle Miocene onward, however, the only sirenians surviving in the Euro-North African region belonged to the generalist cosmopolitan halitheriine genus Metaxytherium. The only exception is the miosirenine trichechid Prohalicore dubaleni, suggesting that <b>Trichechidae</b> survived until the Serravallian, probably living together with the generalist Metaxytherium. During the Late Miocene the genus Metaxytherium became extinct throughout the world except along the Euro-North African coasts, {{and by the end of}} the Miocene it appears to have been survived just in the Mediterranean Basin with the relictual dwarfed species M. serresii. M. serresii specimens are recorded before and after the Messinian Salinity Crisis: at about 7. 24 Ma from southern Italian deposits; at about 6. 8 Ma from Libyan deposits; at 5. 25 - 4. 98 Ma from Spanish deposits; and at 4 – 5. 3 Ma from French deposits. The M. serresii record is considered continuous from the uppermost Tortonian to the early Pliocene in the Mediterranean; according to recent data suggesting that normal marine conditions were present in the Mediterranean during the Messinian Salinity Crisis. The dwarfism in M. serresii is interpreted as a method to increase the fitness of a relictual species, permitted by geographic restriction and reduction in the genetic pool. Moreover, the increase in tusk size observed in M. serresii, in comparison with its supposed ancestors M. krahuletzi and M. medium, could denote a shift in behaviour, with tendencies to territoriality and competition for females and space. The subsequent, and latest, Metaxytherium species M. subapenninum was larger and also with larger and, probably, sexually dimorphic tusks. The sexually dimorphic tusks of M. subapenninum could be interpreted as a successive step in change in behaviour, an indication of competition for females and space that favoured the development of a sexual dimorphism similar to that observed in the living Dugong dugon. On the contrary, the rapid increase in body size could be interpreted as a response to the long-term climatic cooling, as the hydrodamaline sirenians did in the North Pacific; which survived into historic times, eating algae in cold waters. The anatomical feeding adaptations and the stable isotope analyses of M. subapenninum do not indicate a clear change in diet and habitat in comparison with the Miocene species. M. subapenninum did not respond to climatic cooling by changing its diet and habitat as the Hydrodamalinae did, and therefore it became extinct during the Middle Pliocene, most probably during the acceleration of climatic cooling record after 3. 1 Ma. But the history of Euro-North African sirenians does not appear to be concluded; in fact, the remains coming from the Pliocene deposits of the Atlantic coast of Morocco referred to Zanclean and assigned to Metaxytherium serresii, have been demostred to be Piacenzian in age and to bear more resemblances to the Pliocene caribbean dugongine Corystosiren varguezi...|$|E

The Amazonian manatee (Trichechus inunguis) is an aquatic mammal, {{pertaining to}} Sirenia Order and <b>Trichechidae</b> family. It resides at the biggest tributaries of the Amazonian basin, it?s the only order?s specie that lives exclusively in fresh water. In {{the past the}} specie suffered an intense commercial exploration, mainly between 1930 to 1950 decades. In this period is esteemed around 200 thousand animals had been killed. Nowadays the specie has been listed as an animal ?vulnerable to the extinction? by IUCN. In the region of Urucu River (Coari city-AM), characteristic area of occurrence and utilization by the specie, a scientific research, was developed between the years of 2006 and 2007, targeting to characterize limnology and to study the habitants traditional knowledge {{in the areas of}} Urucu River and in the lakes of Urucu, Aru?, Coari and Coari Grande. To the limnologic characterization the collect of the physical-chemicals parameters was realized: water temperature, depth, transparency, watercourse speed, pH, electric conductive and dissolved oxygen, with three copies to each area, to each hydrologic cycle time (low water, dryness, high water and over flowing). The results are compatible with the others Solim?es River dark waters affluent. The Urucu river, even been characterized as a dark water river, shows low transparency and an inclination to white water coloration. The offer of aquatic plants as supplies to the Amazonian Manatee alternates a lot because {{of the differences between the}} water levels in the hydrologic time of over flowing and dryness. The dryness and the low water periods are with lower supplies available. Although the productions beginner at large areas of pasture in the region lakes that would serve as supplies to the Amazonian Manatee during all the high water and over flowing periods is watched. The ships traffic in the study area showed a higher intensity around Coari city and around the gas-tube buildings. To obtain the information about the traditional knowledge from the regions habitants about the Amazonian Manatee was realized interviews semistructured that made 74 inhabitants pertaining to 33 communities. To a better quality of data, these interviews were directed to the eldest inhabitants, to the Amazonian Manatee fishermen and to the communities leaders. Between those asked, 14 inhabitants assumed to have already fished at least one Amazonian Manatee at the studied zone. Between the years of 2004 to 2007 were registered a total of 17 abated animals. The harpoon is the equipment used to fish the Amazonian Manatee, but the ?malhadeiras? (a kind of Amazonian fishing net) shows risk to accidental captures, mainly for species nestling. Half of the local inhabitants believe that the density of Amazonian Manatee has suffered reduction in the studied zone, mainly because of the fact that is still happening Amazonian Manatee captures. According the inhabitants, the Amazonian Manatee can be almost totally used to consume, taking off just the bones and the hardest leathers parts. The meat trade of Amazonian manatee, even forbidden by law, it is still occurring in the area.

40|$|Sirenians, {{the only}} aquatic herbivorous mammals, include 2 families; Dugongidae as dugong (Dugong dugon) and <b>Trichechidae</b> as West Indian manatee (Trichechus manatus), Amazonian manatee (T. inunguis) and West African manatee (T. senegalensis). The {{previous}} works {{have concentrated on}} the digestive functions in sirenians that have been supposed to be specific and different from marine carnivorous mammals and terrestrial herbivores. This paper reviews previous works and gives a perspective for further studies on digestive functions in sirenians {{by focusing on the}} following three topics: (1) The anatomy of the digestive tract, (2) Species and their nutritive values of aquatic plants on which the sirenians feed (3) Researches regarding to digestion. (1) The sirenians are non-ruminant herbivores. Their stomach is simple sac-like and is characterized by a unique “cardiac gland” which contains the digestive enzymes and acid secreting cells. No one cannot explain the difference that the cardiac gland forms like a ball in dugongs and a finger in manatees. The intestine reaches to 9 to 16 times as long as the body length when sirenians becomes adult. The length of large intestine in adult dugong becomes twice as long as small intestine, whereas that of large intenstine in adult manatees becomes to be same length as small intestine. There is a large cecum with a single diverticulum in the dugongs and paired diverticula in manatees. Based on anatomy and morphology of the digestive tract, sirenians belong to the hindgut digesters such as Perissodactyla, proboscidean, Hyracoidea, Rodentia and the green sea turtle in Cryptodira. (2) The dugong feeds exclusively on marine phanerogams of 18 species, belonging to 4 families: Cymodoceae, Hydrocharitaceae, Potamogetonaceae and Zosteraceae. Except for the Amazonian manatee which only lives in fresh water, manatees feed on many aquatic plants in marine to freshwater environments. It has been reported that the West Indian manatees feed on over 60 species of aquatic plants. The seagrasses on which the dugong preferably feeds have relatively lower crude protein, higher crude fiber and lower calorific content than those of the major plants on which terrestrial herbivores primarily feed. On the other hand, the aquatic plants on which the manatees feed have similar crude protein, higher crude fiber and lower calorific content as the above terrestrial plants. Deducing from that the aquatic plants contain 85 - 95 % water in comparison to 75 - 80 % in terrestrial plants, the sirenians must feed abundantly on seagrass and aquatic plants to maintain their body. (3) Although fed diets are different depending on each study, the digestibility in the sirenians is 80 - 90 % and is the highest among terrestrial non-ruminants and ruminants. The digestive capacity in the sirenians seems to be remarkably superior among other herbivorous mammals. Based on researches on volatile fatty acid concentration in the content of digestive tracts, the cecum and large intestine are the principal areas to breakdown and digest the fiber in the diet. Moreover, food retention times in the sirenians are much longer (120 - 216 hrs.) than for other hindgut digesters such as horses (23 - 45 hrs.), elephants (17 - 26 hrs.) and white-tailed deer (20 - 40 hrs.) and ruminants such as cattle (48 - 65 hrs.). The sirenians adapted their digestive tracts and digestive functions to their herbivorous feeding character as having at least two digestive functions to achieve sufficient nutrient absorption. First, food retention time has been lengthened due to the long intestine. Second, the sirenians may have a rich microflora within their digestive tracts, especially in the cecum and large intestine, to elevate the capacity of the fiber fraction and also energy absorption. But research on the microflora within their digestive tract has not yet been carried out. Therefore, {{little is known about the}} digestive physiology and functions in sirenians. We need to have more information about their digestive functions using the living animals in captivity and dead specimens. 海産哺乳類の中で唯一の草食動物である海牛類は，ジュゴン科のジュゴンとマナティ科のアメリカマナティ，ア マゾンマナティ，アフリカマナティの 2 科から成る。海牛頬の消化機構は他の肉食性海産哺乳類と比べて異なっ ていることから，注目を集めていた。本稿では海牛類の消化機構について，（ 1 ）消化管の解剖学的特性，（ 2 ）餌料 植物の栄養学的特性，（ 3 ）消化機能に関連した栄養生態学的研究の 3 点を中心として，消化機構に関する既知の 知見を概説し，今後の研究方向について展望する。 （ 1 ）海牛類は非反芻動物である。胃は単胃であり，「噴門腺」と呼ばれる海牛類に特有の腺塊がある。噴門腺は消 化酵素を分泌する細胞と酸を分泌する細胞の 2 種の細胞から成っている。ジュゴンの噴門腺は球状に近いが，マ ナティ科のそれは指のような形をしている。ジュゴン科とマナティ科で形が違う理由は分かっていない。成体で は腸は体長の 9 ～ 16 倍になる。ジュゴンの成獣では大腸は小腸の約 2 倍の長さになるのに対して，マナティでは 大腸と小腸は同じ長さである。ジュゴンの盲腸は単一であるが，マナティの盲腸は先端が 2 つの角状に分岐して いる。解剖や形態の面から，海牛類は奇蹄目，長鼻目，ハイラックス目，齧歯目やカメ目のアオウミガメが属す る後腸動物に属する。 （ 2 ）ジュゴンは 4 科 18 種の海産顕花植物を摂餌する。淡水種であるアマゾンマナティを除いて，マナティは海域 から淡水域までに生息する多種多様な水生植物を摂餌する。アメリカマナティは 60 種以上の水生植物を摂餌す ることが報告されている。ジュゴンが好んで食べる海草は陸生の草食動物が主に食べる植物と比べて，粗タンパ ク質含有量が少なく，粗繊維含有量が多く，カロリーが低い。一方，マナティ科が食べる水生植物を同じ陸上植 物と比べると，粗タンパク質含有量が同等で，粗繊維含有量が少なく，カロリーが低い。陸生植物では水分が 7 5 ～ 80 ％であるのに比べて，水生植物では 85 ～ 95 ％が水分であるので，海牛類は自身の体を維持するために，大 量の植物を食べなければならない。 （ 3 ）それぞれの研究で餌料植物は異なるが，海牛類の消化率は 80 ～ 90 ％であり，陸上の非反芻動物はおろか， 反芻動物よりも高いことが知られている。海牛類の消化機能は他の草食動物と比べてかなり優れている。消化管 内容物の揮発性脂肪酸濃度の研究から，盲腸と大腸は餌料植物の繊維の分解と分解生成物の消化が行われる主な場所であることが考えられた。さらに，海牛類における餌料植物の体内滞留時間（ 120 ～ 216 時間）は，後腸動物であるウマ（ 23 ～ 45 時間）やゾウ（ 17 ～ 26 時間），オジロジカ（ 20 ～ 40 時間）といった他の後腸動物やウシ （ 48 ～ 65 時間）のような反芻動物と比べてとても長い。海牛類は消化管や消化機能を草食性という自身の摂餌 特性に適応させ，十分な栄養を体内に吸収するために少なくとも消化機能を 2 つの面で特化させた。 1 つは餌料 植物が長い大腸内をよりゆっくり通過させて，餌料植物の体内滞留時間を長くしたことである。 2 つ目は繊維の 分解とエネルギー吸収能力を高めるために，消化管内，特に盲腸や大腸に豊富な微生物を有するようになったこ とである。しかし，消化管内微生物に関する研究はいまだ行われていない。さらに，海牛頬の消化生理や消化機 能に関する知見はわずかである。今後，飼育環境下にある生存個体や，死亡個体を用いて，海牛類の消化機能に 関する知見をさらに増やしていく必要がある...|$|E
