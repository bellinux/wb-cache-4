40|$|Biomass {{is a form}} {{of energy}} that is CO(2) -neutral. However, NO(x), {{emissions}} in biomass combustion are often more than that of coal on equal heating-value basis. In this study, a technology called <b>decoupling</b> <b>combustion</b> was investigated to demonstrate how it reduces NO emissions in biomass and biomass-coal blend <b>combustion.</b> The <b>decoupling</b> <b>combustion</b> refers to a two-step combustion method, in which fuel pyrolysis and the burning of char and pyrolysis gas are separated and the gas burns out during its passage through the burning-char bed. Tests in a quartz dual-bed reactor demonstrated that, in <b>decoupling</b> <b>combustion,</b> NO emissions from biomass and biomass-coal blends were both less than those in traditional combustion and that NO emission from combustion of blends of biomass and coal decreased with increasing biomass percentage in the blend. Co-firing rice husk and coal in a 10 kW stove manufactured according to the <b>decoupling</b> <b>combustion</b> technology further confirmed that the <b>decoupling</b> <b>combustion</b> technology allows for truly low NO emission as well as high efficiency for burning biomass and biomass-coal blends, even in small-scale stoves and boilers...|$|R
40|$|Through {{separating}} coal pyrolysis and char combustion {{and letting}} the pyrolysis gas burn in its passing through the combusting char bed, the so-called <b>decoupling</b> <b>combustion</b> has been proven to be effective for lowering NOx emission of coal and biomass combustion. The original design of the <b>decoupling</b> <b>combustion</b> was based on coal pyrolysis incurring with the heat transferring from the char combustion zone, thus causing the difficulty of scale-up in matching the reactions of slow coal pyrolysis and quick char combustion. An idea of using partial gasification to replace such a pyrolysis was proposed to allow the combination of reburning part of the gasification gas over the combusting char layer and the <b>decoupling</b> <b>combustion</b> of the left gasification gas by letting it pass through the char bed. This article compared first the effectiveness of reducing NOx emission by a few different combustion methods including reburning of gasification gas and the <b>decoupling</b> <b>combustion</b> based on coal pyrolysis in a laboratory scale dual-stage reactor for five different kinds of coal. It was shown that both the <b>decoupling</b> <b>combustion</b> and reburning of gasification gas represented the most effective low-NOx combustion methods, which can reduce the NOx emission by 30 - 40 % {{in comparison with the}} traditional combustion without air-staging and reburning. The fuel ratio of fixed carbon to volatile matters of the coal also affected the effectiveness of NOx reduction, the lower the fuel ratio, the higher the NOx reduction effect was. The actual running test of a 1. 4 MW industrial boiler based on combining the <b>decoupling</b> <b>combustion</b> and reburning part of the partial gasification gas reduced the NOx emission by 33 % in comparison with the traditional industrial boiler. The result showed a successful scale-up of the technology and verified the idea of reducing NOx emission by combining the <b>decoupling</b> <b>combustion</b> and the reburning of coal gasification gas.

40|$|At {{present in}} China, a {{fluidized}} bed combustor is not suitable {{to treat a}} high-water-containing (30 - 60 wt %) industrial biomass residue, such as distilled spirit lees (DSL), which can cause a low bed temperature and inflammation retardation. Our previous fundamental studies showed that the so-called dual fluidized bed gasification <b>decoupling</b> <b>combustion</b> technology (or <b>decoupling</b> <b>combustion</b> for short) can ensure the highly efficient and stable combustion for high-water-containing biomass fuel and lower NO emission as well. In this study, the combustion characteristics of DSL in a circulating fluidized bed (CFB) system and a dual fluidized bed (DFB) system will be examined and compared systematically. For direct combustion of DSL in a CFB system, the high moisture of 30 wt % decreased the bottom temperature of the combustor significantly and brought in unstable combustion, thus leading to s large amount of auxiliary fuel (such as coal) needed to raise the temperature to reach an adiabatic flame temperature and ensure normal bed combustion. Besides, the slag formed in the loop seal also affected the stable run of the DFB <b>combustion</b> system. For <b>decoupling</b> <b>combustion</b> of DSL in a DFB system, both the temperatures in the gasifier and combustor were kept stable and a uniform temperature distribution in the combustor was also observed. In terms of gas emission, the average NO contents in a CFB system and a DFB system were about 160 ppm (369 mg/m(3)) and 50 ppm, respectively, which fully verified the property of low NO emission by <b>decoupling</b> <b>combustion.</b> The direct combustion of DSL in a CFB system and <b>decoupling</b> <b>combustion</b> in a DFB system were compared in an industrial demonstration plant for demonstrating technical features of <b>decoupling</b> <b>combustion...</b>|$|R

40|$|In this fuel {{flexible}} turbine system (FFTS) program, the Parker gasification {{system was}} further optimized, fuel composition of biomass gasification process was characterized and {{the feasibility of}} running Capstone MicroTurbine(TM) systems with gasification syngas fuels was evaluated. With high hydrogen content, the gaseous fuel from a gasification process of various feed stocks such as switchgrass and corn stover has high reactivity and high flashback propensity when running in the current lean premixed injectors. The research concluded that the existing C 65 microturbine combustion system, which is designed for natural gas, {{is not able to}} burn the high hydrogen content syngas due to insufficient resistance to flashback (undesired flame propagation to upstream within the fuel injector). A comprehensive literature review was conducted on high-hydrogen fuel combustion and its main issues. For Capstone?s lean premixed injector, the main mechanisms of flashback were identified to be boundary layer flashback and bulk flow flashback. Since the existing microturbine combustion system is not able to operate on high-hydrogen syngas fuels, new hardware needed to be developed. The new hardware developed and tested included (1) a series of injectors with a reduced propensity for boundary layer flashback and (2) two new <b>combustion</b> <b>liner</b> designs (<b>Combustion</b> <b>Liner</b> Design A and B) that lead to desired primary zone air flow split to meet the overall bulk velocity requirement to mitigate the risk of core flashback inside the injectors. The new injector designs were evaluated in both test apparatus and C 65 /C 200 engines. While some of the new injector designs did not provide satisfactory performance in burning target syngas fuels, particularly in improving resistance to flashback. The combustion system configuration of FFTS- 4 injector and <b>Combustion</b> <b>Liner</b> Design A was found promising to enable the C 65 microturbine system to run on high hydrogen biomass syngas. The FFTS- 4 injector was tested in a C 65 engine operating on 100 % hydrogen and with the redesigned <b>combustion</b> <b>liner</b> - <b>Combustion</b> <b>Liner</b> Design A - installed. The results were promising for the FFTS program as the system was able to burn 100 % hydrogen fuel without flashback while maintaining good combustion performance. While initial results have been demonstrated the feasibility of this program, {{further research is needed to}} determine whether these results will be repeated with FFTS- 4 injectors installed in all injector ports and over a wide range of operating conditions and fuel variations...|$|R

A project was initiated at NASA-Marshal Space Flight Center (MSFC) to combine three existing technologies to build and demonstrate an advanced liquid rocket engine combustion chamber that would provide a 100 mission life. Technology developed in microgravity research to build cartridges for space furnaces was utilized to vacuum plasma spray (VPS) a functional gradient coating on the hot wall of the <b>combustion</b> <b>liner</b> as one continuous operation, eliminating any bondline between the coating and the liner.

The gas temperature and mass derived for the disk of EL 29 are similar to the disks of the previously studied sample. In EL 29, as in Herbig AeBe stars, the gas and dust are probably <b>thermally</b> <b>decoupled.</b> Finally, the upper limit on the H 2 O emission that we obtain suggests that water is not an important coolant of the disk gas, in agreement with theoretical water abundance predictions. The present study challenges previous claims that the FIR CO line emission observed in sources similar to EL 29 originates in shocks...|$|R
40|$|The next {{generation}} of reusable launch vehicles is likely to use GRCop- 84 [Cu- 8 (at. %) Cr- 4 %Nb] copper alloy <b>combustion</b> <b>liners.</b> The application of protective coatings on GRCop- 84 liners can minimize or eliminate many of the environmental problems experienced by uncoated liners and significantly extend their operational lives and lower operational cost. A newly developed Cu- 23 (wt. %) Cr- 5 % Al (CuCrAl) coating, shown to resist hydrogen attack and oxidation in an as-cast form, is currently being considered as a protective coating for GRCop- 84. The coating was deposited on GRCop- 84 substrates by the cold spray deposition technique, where the CuCrAl was procured as gas-atomized powders. Cyclic oxidation tests were conducted between 773 and 1, 073 K to characterize the coated substrates...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} the dynamical {{evolution of a}} Na$_ 8 $ cluster embedded in Ar matrices of various sizes from N= 30 to 1048. The system is excited by an intense short laser pulse leading to high ionization stages. We analyze the subsequent highly non-linear motion of cluster and Ar environment in terms of trajectories, shapes, and energy flow. The most prominent effects are: temporary stabilization of high charge states for several ps, sudden stopping of the Coulomb explosion of the embedded Na$_ 8 $ clusters associated with an extremely fast energy transfer to the Ar matrix, fast distribution of energy throughout the Ar layers by a sound wave. Other ionic-atomic transfer and relaxation processes proceed at slower scale of few ps. The electron cloud is almost <b>thermally</b> <b>decoupled</b> from ions and thermalizes far beyond the ps scale. Comment: 12 pages, 10 figures, accepted in Euro. Phys. J. ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn this letter, we {{consider}} {{a class of}} scenarios in which the dark matter {{is part of a}} heavy hidden sector that is <b>thermally</b> <b>decoupled</b> from the Standard Model in the early universe. The dark matter freezes-out by annihilating to a lighter, metastable state, whose subsequent abundance can naturally come to dominate the energy density of the universe. When this state decays, it reheats the visible sector and dilutes all relic abundances, thereby allowing the dark matter to be orders of magnitude heavier than the weak scale. For concreteness, {{we consider}} a simple realization with a Dirac fermion dark matter candidate coupled to a massive gauge boson that decays to the Standard Model through its kinetic mixing with hypercharge. We identify viable parameter space in which the dark matter can be as heavy as ∼ 1 – 100 PeV without being overproduced in the early universe...|$|R
40|$|The {{use of an}} {{aluminum}} matrix superconductor in the coils for the ASTROMAG magnet will increase the integrated field for conducting particle astrophysics experiments in space as compared to equal mass coils made with a copper matrix superconductor. The increased ability to detect charged particles can be achieved without decreasing the current margin of the superconductor in the coils. The use of a low-resistivity aluminum matrix conductor increases the energy needed to initiate a quench by two orders or magnitude. The current decay time constant during a quench is substantially increased. As a result, the quench energy dumped into the helium tank is reduced (the ASTROMAG coils are <b>thermally</b> <b>decoupled</b> from the helium tank), and the forces on the shield and shells due to eddy currents will be lower. A description is also given of {{the problems associated with}} the use of {{an aluminum}} matrix superconductor in the coils...|$|R
