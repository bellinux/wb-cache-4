25|$|Epidemics of cholera, malaria, rabies and African hemorrhagic fevers like Marburg hemorrhagic fever, {{are common}} {{diseases}} in several {{parts of the}} country. Many regions in <b>this</b> <b>country</b> <b>have</b> high incidence rates of tuberculosis and high HIV prevalence rates. Dengue, filariasis, leishmaniasis and onchocerciasis (river blindness) are other diseases carried by insects that also occur in the region. Angola {{has one of the}} highest infant mortality rates in the world and one of the world's lowest life expectancies. A 2007 survey concluded that low and deficient niacin status was common in Angola. Demographic and Health Surveys is currently conducting several surveys in Angola on malaria, domestic violence and more.|$|E

[...] When {{adjusted}} for inflation, it is, as of 2007, the highest-grossing independent film of all time. The film {{was among the}} first to introduce martial arts, especially hapkido to American audiences and contained elements of Jungian psychology, and fictional depictions of American Indian beliefs, depicting a tribe that does not exist, the [...] "Nishnobie." [...] As part of the film's promotion, Bong Soo Han, who was in charge of the martial arts choreography for the film, toured the United States giving hapkido demonstrations.|$|E

2500|$|Gove {{described}} {{his decision to}} campaign for Britain to leave the EU in the EU referendum as [...] "the most difficult decision of my political life". He and his family spent Christmas with the Camerons at Chequers where, according to Craig Oliver, Cameron {{got the impression that}} Gove would support remaining in the EU. He argued Britain would be [...] "freer, fairer and better off" [...] for leaving. When in an interview it was claimed that there was no expert opinion to support this, Gove remarked that [...] "the people of <b>this</b> <b>country</b> <b>have</b> had enough of experts from organizations with acronyms saying they know what is best and getting it consistently wrong." [...] However, interviewer Faisal Islam interrupted Gove after the word [...] "experts", causing some sources to report that he had made a general statement that [...] "the people... have had enough of experts".|$|E
2500|$|Also {{according}} to Vasile, Vladimir Tismăneanu's contribution, {{like those of}} historians Katherine Verdery and Catherine Durandin, is being purposefully ignored by some Romanian academics, who object to their exposure of national communism. Vasile nominates such figures as [...] "the pernicious and not altogether innocent continuity" [...] of Communist Romania. In contrast, Tismăneanu was a direct influence on the first post-Revolution generation of political scientists and historians. Vasile credits his colleague with having influenced [...] "an entire generation of young researchers of Romania's recent history." [...] As one of them, Cioroianu, writes: [...] "quite {{a lot of us}} in the field of historical-social analysis in <b>this</b> <b>country</b> <b>have</b> emerged from underneath Vl Tismăneanu's cloak". In Cioroianu's definition, the group includes himself, alongside Stelian Tănase, Mircea Mihăieș, Marius Oprea, Stejărel Olaru, Dan Pavel, Dragoș Petrescu and others. The same author notes that his predecessor had an early and important contribution, equivalent to a [...] "generative enlightenment", by presenting younger researchers with a detailed account of previously obscured phenomena and events. Most of Tismăneanu's works have English and Romanian-language editions, and books of his were translated into Polish, Lithuanian, and Ukrainian.|$|E
2500|$|The Commonwealth realms' {{prime ministers}} {{thereafter}} discussed {{the matter of}} the new monarch's title, with St. Laurent stating at the 1953 Commonwealth Conference {{that it was important to}} agree on a format that would [...] "emphasise the fact that the Queen is Queen of Canada, regardless of her sovereignty over other Commonwealth countries." [...] The result was a new Royal Style and Titles Act being passed in each of the seven realms then existing (excluding Pakistan), which all identically gave formal recognition to the separateness and equality of the countries involved, and replaced the phrase [...] "British Dominions Beyond the Seas" [...] with [...] "Her Other Realms and Territories", the latter using the medieval French word realm (from royaume) in place of dominion. Further, at her coronation, Elizabeth II's oath contained a provision requiring her to promise to govern according to the rules and customs of the realms, naming each one separately. The change in perspective was summed up by Patrick Gordon Walker's statement in the British House of Commons: [...] "We in <b>this</b> <b>country</b> <b>have</b> to abandon... any sense of property in the Crown. The Queen, now, clearly, explicitly and according to title, belongs equally to all her realms and to the Commonwealth as a whole." ...|$|E
