5|$|A {{reflective}} layer behind the tiger shark's retina, called the tapetum lucidum, allows light-sensing cells {{a second chance}} to capture photons of visible light, enhancing vision in low-light conditions. A tiger shark generally has long fins to provide lift as the shark maneuvers through water, while the long upper tail provides bursts of speed. The tiger shark normally swims using small body movements. Its high back and dorsal fin act as a pivot, allowing it <b>to</b> <b>spin</b> quickly on its axis, though the shark's dorsal fins are distinctively close to its tail.|$|E

With Sonic, Tails, Knuckles and (in the latter 2 games) Cream, she frees animals from inside Eggman's robots {{to keep him}} from building an empire.

5|$|England batted on {{for five}} minutes on the final morning, adding three runs in two overs before Yardley {{declared}} at 365/8, with Evans on 47 not out.

5|$|England batted on {{for five}} minutes on the final morning, adding three runs in two overs before Yardley {{declared}} at 8/365. Johnson ended with 1/85 from 21 overs and was the most uneconomical of the Australian bowlers, conceding runs {{at a rate of}} 4.04 per over while the others averaged 3.26. Batting into the final day allowed Yardley the right to ask the groundsman to use a heavy roller, which would help to break up the wicket, make it more likely <b>to</b> <b>spin</b> and therefore more difficult for Australia to bat on.|$|E
5|$|England {{declared}} at 8/365 {{after two}} overs {{on the last}} day. Batting into the final day allowed Yardley to ask the groundsman to use a heavy roller, which would help {{to break up the}} wicket and make it more likely <b>to</b> <b>spin.</b> Bradman elected to not have the pitch rolled at all, demonstrating his belief that such a device would only make batting more difficult.|$|E

5|$|On 7 October 1964, Vulcan B.2 XM601 crashed during {{overshoot}} from an asymmetric power practice approach at Coningsby. The copilot had executed the asymmetric {{power approach}} with two engines producing thrust and two at idle. He was being checked by the Squadron Commander, who was {{unfamiliar with the}} aircraft. When he commenced the overshoot the copilot moved all the throttles to full power. The engines that had been producing power reached full power more quickly than the engines at idle and the resultant asymmetric thrust exceeded the available rudder authority, causing the aircraft <b>to</b> <b>spin</b> and crash. All the crew perished.|$|E

Flavor quantum numbers (isospin (I3), charm (C), strangeness (S, {{not to be confused}} with spin), topness (T), and bottomness (B′)) are assigned to certain quark flavors, and denote qualities of quark-based systems and hadrons. The baryon number (B) is + for all quarks, as baryons are made of three quarks. For antiquarks, the electric charge (Q) and all flavor quantum numbers (B, I3, C, S, T, and B′) are of opposite sign. Mass and total angular momentum (J; equal <b>to</b> <b>spin</b> for point particles) do not change sign for the antiquarks.|$|E

5|$|Uneven heating {{can cause}} newly {{generated}} gases {{to break out}} of a weak spot on the surface of comet's nucleus, like a geyser.

5|$|After {{five minutes}} on the final morning, Yardley {{declared}} at 8/365. Batting into the final day allowed Yardley to ask the groundsman to use a heavy roller, which would help {{to break up the}} wicket, thereby causing more uneven bounce and making the surface more likely <b>to</b> <b>spin.</b> The declaration left Australia to chase 404 runs for victory. At the time, this would have been the highest ever fourth innings score to result in a Test victory for the batting side. Australia had only 345 minutes to reach the target, and the local press wrote them off, predicting that they would be dismissed by lunchtime on a deteriorating wicket expected to favour the spin bowlers. However, Morris partnered Bradman in a stand of 301 in 217 minutes to set up the win, although they were helped by England’s fielders, who missed several catching and stumping chances. Harvey came to the crease at 3/396 and got off the mark by hitting the winning boundary.|$|E
5|$|At {{the second}} {{practice}} session on Friday afternoon, Ferrari {{was able to}} reduce the gap to Mercedes, with Vettel third {{a little more than}} seven-tenths of a second behind Hamilton. Nico Rosberg was just 0.021 seconds off his teammate's time of 1m24.279s, even leading through the first two sectors but losing fastest time through the third and final sector. The two Force India cars of Sergio Pérez and Nico Hülkenberg split the two Ferrari drivers, with Kimi Räikkönen finishing in sixth. Max Verstappen was the second Toro Rosso driver of the day <b>to</b> <b>spin</b> out into the gravel, but he was able to continue after losing control of his car at the Ascari chicane. There were technical problems for both Daniel Ricciardo and Jenson Button. While the Australian had to cut his first run short due to a hydraulical issue, Button was summoned back into the pit lane after only three laps with an unspecified problem.|$|E
