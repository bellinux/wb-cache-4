5|$|The {{melting point}} of gallium, at 302.9146K (29.7646°C, 85.5763°F), is just above room temperature, and is {{approximately}} {{the same as the}} average summer daytime temperatures in Earth's mid-latitudes.

The triple point of gallium, 302.9166K (29.7666°C, 85.5799°F), is used by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in preference to the melting point.|$|E
5|$|Temperature is {{a measure}} of the kinetic energy of a sample of matter. Temperature is the unique {{physical}} property that determines the direction of heat flow between two objects placed in thermal contact. If no heat flow occurs, the two objects have the same temperature; otherwise heat flows from the hotter object to the colder object. Temperature, within meteorology, is measured with thermometers exposed to the air but sheltered from direct solar exposure. In most of the world, the degree Celsius scale is used for most temperature measuring purposes. However, the United States is the last major country in which the degree Fahrenheit <b>temperature</b> <b>scale</b> is used by most lay people, industry, popular meteorology, and government. Despite this, METAR reports from the United States also report the temperature (and dewpoint, see below) in degrees Celsius.|$|E

40|$|The {{parallel}} {{magnetic field}} tuned two-dimensional superconductor-insulator transition {{has been investigated}} in ultrathin films of amorphous Bi. The resistance {{is found to be}} independent of temperature {{on both sides of the}} transition below approximately 120 mK. Several observations suggest that this regime is not intrinsically "metallic" but results from the failure of the films' electrons to cool. The onset of this temperature-independent regime can be moved to higher temperatures by either increasing the measuring current or the level of electromagnetic noise. <b>Temperature</b> <b>scaling</b> is successful above 120 mK. Electric field scaling can be mapped onto <b>temperature</b> <b>scaling</b> by relating the electric fields to elevated electron temperatures. These results cast doubt on the existence of an intrinsic metallic regime and on the independent determination of the correlation length and dynamical critical exponents obtained by combining the results of electric field and <b>temperature</b> <b>scaling.</b> Comment: 4 pages, 4 figure...|$|R

25|$|Unit {{conversion}} for temperature {{differences is}} {{simply a matter of}} multiplying by, e.g., 1°F / 1 K (although the ratio is not a constant value). But because some of these scales have origins that do not correspond to absolute zero, conversion from one <b>temperature</b> <b>scale</b> to another requires accounting for that. As a result, simple dimensional analysis can lead to errors if it is ambiguous whether 1 K means the absolute temperature equal to −273.15°C, or the temperature difference equal to 1°C.|$|E

25|$|However, {{the boiling}} point for aqueous {{ethylene}} glycol increases monotonically with increasing ethylene-glycol fraction. Thus, the use of ethylene glycol not only depresses the freezing point, but also elevates {{the boiling point}} such that the operating range for the heat-transfer fluid is broadened {{on both ends of}} the <b>temperature</b> <b>scale.</b> The increase in boiling temperature is due to pure ethylene glycol having a much higher boiling point and lower vapor pressure than pure water; there is no chemical stabilization against boiling of the liquid phase at intermediate compositions, as there is against freezing.|$|E

40|$|The <b>temperature</b> <b>scaling</b> of the micromagnetic Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya {{exchange}} {{interaction is}} {{calculated for the}} whole range of temperature. We use Green's function theory to derive the finite-temperature spin wave spectrum of ferromagnetic systems described by a classical atomistic spin model Hamiltonian. Within this model, we find universal expressions for the <b>temperature</b> <b>scaling</b> not only of the Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya interaction but also of the Heisenberg exchange stiffness and the single-ion anisotropy. In the spirit of multiscale models, we establish a clear connection between the atomistic interactions and the temperature-dependent coefficients in the spin wave spectrum and in the micromagnetic free energy functional. We demonstrate that the corrections to mean-field theory or the random phase approximation for the <b>temperature</b> <b>scaling</b> of Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya and Heisenberg exchange interactions assume very similar forms. In the presence of thermal fluctuations and Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya interaction an anisotropy-like term emerges in the spin wave spectrum which, at low temperature, increases with temperature, in contrast to the decreasing single-ion anisotropy. We evaluate the accuracy of the theoretical method by comparing it to the spin wave spectrum calculated from Monte Carlo simulations. Comment: 11 pages, 4 figure...|$|R
