5|$|At the season-opening Daytona 500, Robinson {{qualified}} in 36th place {{making her}} the second woman {{to start the}} race; she finished 24th despite spinning into the track's infield, and avoided a pit road collision with Bobby Labonte. After the event, Sharp left BAM Racing, and car chief Teddy Brown became Robinson's new crew chief. She struggled during her rookie season, {{and was unable to}} attend most races due to sponsorship issues along with her team hiring new drivers which limited her on track experience. Her rival competitors said it was due to Robinson driving an noncompetitive car rather than her driving skill. Robinson made no further appearances for BAM Racing after the second race at Daytona International Speedway, and was later released by the team. She ended the season 52nd in the Drivers' Championship, and was fourth in the Rookie of the Year standings. Outside racing, Robinson spoke for Women in Sports, and attended meetings of several associations and business groups while <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> be with her children. She separated from Jeff Clark in early 2002, but both remained on good terms.|$|E

25|$|On June 4, 2015, Nichols' {{booking agency}} {{announced}} that she had suffered a mild stroke at her Los Angeles home and had been admitted to a Los Angeles-area hospital.

Nichols was reportedly awake and resting comfortably. An online news article by Frazier Moore of the Associated Press, which cited news updates from the actress's Facebook page, stated that, four days afterward, the hospitalized actress was feeling much better and was improving, remaining cheerful and alert and <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> read the messages from fans and well-wishers on her Facebook page, of which there were many.

Her fellow Star Trek actor George Takei, who played Hikaru Sulu, wished her well on his Twitter account page.|$|E

The second season sees more medical mysteries and twist with each episode as Dr. Megan Hunt (Dana Delany) and her team are back to handle everything from a child kidnapping to a murder where the entire city could be suspect. Along with murder and other crimes, the team deals with a new romance and Hunt continues to work around strained relationships with her ex-husband and boss.

2500|$|In 1895, the British {{government}} authorized Kitchener {{to launch}} a campaign to reconquer Sudan. Britain provided men and matériel while Egypt financed the expedition. The Anglo-Egyptian Nile Expeditionary Force included 25,800 men, 8,600 of whom were British. The remainder were troops belonging to Egyptian units that included six battalions recruited in southern Sudan. An armed river flotilla escorted the force, which also had artillery support. In preparation for the attack, the British established an army headquarters at the former rail head Wadi Halfa and extended and reinforced the perimeter defenses around Sawakin. In March 1896, the campaign started as the Dongola Expedition. Despite <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> reconstruct Ishmail Pasha's former [...] gauge railway south along the east bank of the Nile, Kitchener captured the former capital of Nubia by September. The next year, the British then constructed a new rail line directly across the desert from Wadi Halfa to Abu Hamad, which they captured in the Battle of Abu Hamed on 7 August 1897. [...] (The [...] gauge, hastily adopted {{to make use of}} available rolling stock, meant supplies from the Egyptian network required transshipment via steamer from Asyut to Halfa. The Sudanese system retains the incompatible gauge to this day.) Anglo-Egyptian units fought a sharp action at Abu Hamad, but there was little other significant resistance until Kitchener reached Atbarah and defeated the Ansar. After this engagement, Kitchener's soldiers marched and sailed toward Omdurman, where the Khalifa made his last stand.|$|E

2500|$|Kabary may be {{delivered}} {{by two or}} more mpikabary at the same occasion, and each one generally was nominated by and represents {{a portion of the}} audience present, as during hiragasy performances. [...] When this happens, kabary speech can take on somewhat competitive overtones as the speakers attempt to demonstrate their superior skills. The mpikabary typically addresses himself to the audience of his opponent, and while direct confrontation is generally frowned upon in polite society in the Highlands of Madagascar, if an opponent mpikabary makes an error {{in the form of the}} kabary or misstates an ohabolana, this is commonly pointed out in an indirect or delicate manner as evidence of greater mastery. [...] The use of indirect language such as proverbs is viewed as the more challenging, adult manner of speaking and demonstrates skill, while direct criticism, bluntness, hateful speech or anything that causes loss of face to the audience or a rival speaker is censured and despised as lacking in skill. [...] Kabary is generally the domain of men and not women, because women are believed and expected to speak in a more straightforward wayincluding the expression of anger that can cause loss of face to the speakerwhile men are expected to preserve face by <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> choose their words carefully when speaking to others. [...] Nonetheless, some women may exceptionally engage in kabary (for instance, all queens), although men represent the vast majority of mpikabary.|$|E
