Hughes had lost {{velocity}} in his fastball, dropping from 93MPH to 92MPH. His 2015 season was marred with inconsistency and injury as he only started 25 times while appearing 2 times out of the bullpen.

5|$|The {{following}} year Ingres sought to capitalise on <b>the</b> <b>success</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> Bertin portrait. He showed his ambitious history painting The Martyrdom of Saint Symphorian at the 1834 Salon, {{but it was}} harshly criticised; even Ingres' admirers offered only faint praise. Offended and frustrated, Ingres declared he would disown the Salon, abandon his residence in Paris for Rome, and relinquish all current positions, ending his role in public life. This petulance was not to last.|$|E
5|$|After <b>the</b> <b>success</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> {{previous}} film The Life of Oharu, Mizoguchi {{was offered}} {{to make a}} film by his old friend Masaichi Nagata at Daiei Film studios. The deal promised Mizoguchi complete artistic control and a large budget. Despite this, Mizoguchi was eventually pressured to make a less pessimistic ending for the film. Mizoguchi's sceenwriter and long-time collaborator Yoshikata Yoda said that originally, Mizoguchi did not envision making an anti-war film, instead wishing to capture the sensations and lucidity of Ueda's book Ugetsu Monogatari.|$|E
50|$|Villehardouin's words — while {{sometimes}} {{accurate and}} other times not — present a vivid personal account of the Fourth Crusade. From the outset, Villehardouin states {{that he is a}} pilgrim, but he never explains this tenet of the Crusade. Another omission is Fulk of Neuilly's influence on the origins of the Fourth Crusade. Villehardouin merely reports <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>successes</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> work.|$|R

5|$|Although Snoop Dogg retains working {{relationships}} with Warren G and Daz, who are {{alleged to be}} uncredited contributors on the hit albums The Chronic and Doggystyle, he states that Dr.Dre is capable of making beats {{without the help of}} collaborators, and that he is responsible for <b>the</b> <b>success</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> numerous albums. Dr.Dre's prominent studio collaborators, including Scott Storch, Elizondo, Mark Batson and Dawaun Parker, have shared co-writing, instrumental, and more recently co-production credits on the songs where he is credited as the producer.|$|E
5|$|Although {{no longer}} {{employed}} by the New Zealand Company, Heaphy, emboldened by <b>the</b> <b>success</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> report and the public reception to his paintings, sought further opportunities for similar work. From London, he wrote to the company secretary seeking support for exploration of the area inland of Nelson. The response was unenthusiastic, the company was concentrating on developing its settlements, rather than undertaking in further exploration of the country. Despite this, Heaphy returned to New Zealand and arrived in Nelson on 22 December 1842.|$|E

50|$|Barry Wilson was {{promoted}} from assistant coach {{and took over}} the Blue Devils football program after the departure of Steve Spurrier, but struggled with a 13-30-1 record in four seasons despite inheriting a team that had shared an ACC championship the season before he got there.

5|$|Benchley {{started at}} the Tribune as a reporter. He was a very poor one, unable to get {{statements}} from people quoted in other papers, and eventually had greater success covering lectures around the city. He was promised a position at the Tribunes Sunday magazine when it launched, and he {{was moved to the}} magazine's staff soon after he was hired, eventually becoming chief writer. He wrote two articles a week: the first a review of non-literary books, the other a feature-style article about whatever he wanted. The liberty gave his work new life, and <b>the</b> <b>success</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> pieces in the magazine convinced his editors to give him a signed byline column in the Tribune proper.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland's {{trouble with}} the Senate {{hindered}} <b>the</b> <b>success</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> nominations to the Supreme Court in his second term. In 1893, {{after the death of}} Samuel Blatchford, Cleveland nominated William B. Hornblower to the Court. Hornblower, the head of a New York City law firm, was thought to be a qualified appointee, but his campaign against a New York machine politician had made Senator David B. Hill his enemy. Further, Cleveland had not consulted the Senators before naming his appointee, leaving many who were already opposed to Cleveland on other grounds even more aggrieved. The Senate rejected Hornblower's nomination on January 15, 1894, by a vote of 30 to 24.|$|E
5|$|Coffin {{continued}} to farm {{after moving to}} Indiana and {{within a year of}} his arrival he opened the first dry-goods store in Newport. In later years Coffin credited <b>the</b> <b>success</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> business, which he expanded in the 1830s, with providing him the ability to become heavily involved in the costly enterprise of the Underground Railroad, a costly and risky enterprise that provided a network of stopover sites for fugitive slaves as they traveled north into Canada.|$|E

5|$|Following <b>the</b> <b>success</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> Sendiri tour, Chrisye {{began to}} explore the {{possibility}} of producing an album of his early hits, remastered by Gutawa. On the condition that they use an Australian orchestra to provide backing music, Gutawa agreed to an acoustic-flavoured album. Aciu also agreed, despite the expected cost of Rp 600 million (US$70,000). After basic recording in Jakarta, Chrisye, Gutawa, and sound engineer Dany Lisapali spent two weeks in Studio 301 in Sydney finishing off the album. The Philip Hartl Chamber Orchestra provided the music; the mixing and mastering was also completed in Sydney. AkustiChrisye was released in 1996 and sold well.|$|E
5|$|For the {{remainder}} of his time in San Francisco, Johnson was unable to replicate <b>the</b> <b>success</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> rookie year, as his production dropped significantly in the following two seasons. He played in seven games in 1955 before suffering a shoulder injury against the Los Angeles Rams, and finished the year with only 19 carries for 69 yards and one touchdown. He was traded to the Detroit Lions following the 1956 season in exchange for fullback Bill Bowman and defensive back Bill Stits.|$|E
5|$|Godley's II ANZAC Corps {{played an}} {{important}} role in the Passchendaele offensive in October 1917. Following <b>the</b> <b>success</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> corps at the Battle of Broodseinde on 4 October 1917, Godley believed the morale of the Germans was low, and pushed for further attacks to secure the Passchendaele Ridge. This was in concert with the preference of Field Marshal Douglas Haig, the commander of the British Expeditionary Force. However, Godley's superior officer, General Herbert Plumer, preferred to halt the offensive as the weather had deteriorated immediately after the battle. An attack on 9 October by the 49th and 66th Divisions, both British formations attached to II ANZAC Corps, was hampered by the poor weather which showed no signs of abating and achieved very limited gains.|$|E
