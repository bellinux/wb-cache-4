25|$|One {{prototype}} <b>tail-wheel</b> undercarriage carrier fighter for the USN.|$|E
25|$|The AIR-12 {{was fitted}} with a {{retractable}} <b>tail-wheel</b> undercarriage with the main-wheels retracting inwards, operated by cables, torque shaft and hand crank in the pilots cockpit.|$|E
2500|$|The Skycar I {{was first}} {{displayed}} at the spring 1931 Detroit Show. The aircraft was a two-seat high-wing monoplane, accommodating the occupants in tandem layout. It had an all-metal steel-tube frame covered with corrugated metal skin. Centre-line nose and <b>tail-wheels</b> plus a standard landing gear were fitted. The rear fuselage was constructed from an open framework carrying a single fin and rudder, inside which was located the rear pusher engine. The Sky Car was displayed with a Moorhouse engine (Alfred Moorhouse of Detroit, assignor to Packard Motor Car Company). Fuel was carried in two tanks in the leading portion of the central section of the engine housing, from where it was fed by gravity to the engine. At a later date the aircraft was fitted with twin booms carrying the single fin and rudder (see photo of preserved aircraft). The aircraft featured balanced pivoting outboard wingtips rather than ailerons. Stout attempted to design a simple aircraft that would have controls similar to early model Fords including the ignition switch and the starter button. Stout planned to build the Sky Car (i.e. its original name was [...] "Sky Car" [...] but various newspaper and magazine articles spelled it [...] "Skycar") [...] and sell it {{at the price of}} a moderately priced car (approximately $2000) if mass-produced in numbers.|$|R
25|$|The Sealand was a {{high wing}} {{cantilever}} monoplane of all-metal construction with a flying boat hull and both underwing floats and a standard <b>tail-wheel</b> undercarriage; the two main wheels retracted into recesses in the hull below the wings, while the tailwheel retracted behind the hull's planing bottom.|$|E
25|$|Rare {{examples}} of jet-powered tailwheel aircraft {{that went into}} production and saw service include the British Supermarine Attacker naval fighter and the Soviet Yakovlev Yak-15. Both first flew in 1946 and owed their configurations to being developments of earlier propeller powered aircraft. The Attacker 's <b>tail-wheel</b> configuration {{was a result of}} it using the Supermarine Spiteful's wing, avoiding expensive design modification or retooling. The Yak-15 was based on the Yakovlev Yak-3 propeller fighter. Its engine was mounted under the forward fuselage. Despite its unusual configuration, the Yak-15 was easy to fly. Although a fighter, it was mainly used to prepare Soviet pilots for flying more advanced jet fighters.|$|E
25|$|Unlike its rival, the Supermarine Attacker, {{which had}} been the first jet {{aircraft}} to enter service with the FAA, the Sea Hawk had a tricycle undercarriage rather than a <b>tail-wheel,</b> making it easier to land on carriers, it was also Hawker's first aircraft to incorporate a nose-wheel undercarriage. The Sea Hawk had adopted a fairly conventional design, being built with straight wings while a number of other contemporary aircraft, such as the F-86 Sabre, had adopted swept wings. The Sea Hawk was a reliable and elegant aeroplane, though its cautious design meant it would only be attractive on the export market, and thus be in production, for only a short period before being superseded by more advanced aircraft.|$|E
25|$|The Found FBA-2 is an {{all-metal}} {{development of}} the company's first design, the Found FBA-1. The prototype first flew on 11 August 1960. It is a high-wing monoplane with a fixed tricycle undercarriage. The production version {{was to be the}} Found FBA-2B but the aircraft was produced with a conventional <b>tail-wheel</b> landing gear as the Found FBA-2C. The first production FBA-2C first flew on 9 May 1962. It is powered by an Avco Lycoming O-540-A1D engine and had a slightly longer cabin and enlarged cabin doors than the prototype. Originally, float or ski landing gear was available through third parties, and later became a factory option. Production ended in 1965 to concentrate on building the newer and larger Centennial 100. Thirty-four had been built.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the crash}} was {{originally}} blamed on pilot error, it was subsequently {{found to have}} been caused by slush {{towards the end of the}} runway, causing deceleration of the aircraft and preventing safe flying speed. During take-off, the aircraft had reached , but, on entering the slush, dropped to , too slow to leave the ground, with not enough runway to abort the take-off. Aircraft with <b>tail-wheel</b> undercarriages had not been greatly affected by slush, due to the geometry of these undercarriages in relation to the aircraft's centre of gravity, but newer types, such as the Ambassador, with nose wheel landing-gear and the main wheels behind the centre of gravity, were found to be vulnerable. The accident resulted in the imposition of operating limits for the amount of slush build-up permitted on runways.|$|E
25|$|The {{airframe}} of the P.8 continued Pulawski's {{theme of}} semi-monocoque stressed skin Aluminium alloy structure with fabric covered control surfaces. The wings were built up around two I-section Aluminium alloy spars with alloy ribs and finely corrugated sheet Duralumin. High set gull style wings {{were attached to}} the upper fuselage with about 5 degrees dihedral out to the joint between centre-section and outer wings which had zero dihedral. Support for the wings came from pairs of struts attached to the lower fuselage and at the thickest section of the outer wings at about 1/3span. A fixed <b>tail-wheel</b> undercarriage consisted of strut mounted mainwheels attached to the fuselage at the wing strut attachment points and a steel shod tail-skid. Cooling for the engine was achieved by a large radiator bath under the rear fuselage on the P.8/I and by special surface heat exchangers under the rear fuselage of the P.8/II. The special heat exchangers caused cooling difficulties and were replaced by small radiators {{either side of the}} rear fuselage aft of the cockpit.|$|E
2500|$|The Sportsman was a parasol winged monoplane, {{equipped}} with two seats arranged in tandem. [...] The cockpit had an open layout. [...] A fixed <b>tail-wheel</b> undercarriage was fitted. The tailplane was set {{low on the}} fin. [...] A 100 h.p. Cirrus III was initially fitted.|$|E
2500|$|The Me 261 had a conventional, {{retractable}} <b>tail-wheel</b> landing gear, {{although it}} had unusually large and bulky low-pressure tires, much like modern day aircraft tundra tires, which prevented the aircraft from becoming bogged down on rough grass landing strips. [...] The main gear's design appears to use main struts that rotated through 90° during their rearwards retraction sequence, that had the sizable main wheels resting atop the retracted struts, much like the production examples of the Junkers Ju 88 already used, with even the fully retractable tailgear possessing a larger-than-average, low-pressure pneumatic tire.|$|E
2500|$|The Attacker {{suffered}} from deficiencies {{which led to}} it quickly being superseded; one being that the aircraft retained the Spiteful's <b>tail-wheel</b> undercarriage (due {{to the extent of}} the re-tooling that would have been required to alter the Spiteful's wing), rather than a nose-wheel undercarriage, thus making the Attacker more difficult to land on aircraft carriers. This same tail-down attitude meant that when operating from grass airfields the jet exhaust would create a long furrow in the ground that [...] "three men could lie down in". Also the new wing was apparently aerodynamically inferior to the original Spitfire elliptic one, with lower critical Mach number, leading to someone quipping that [...] "they rather should have left the Spitfire wing on the thing".|$|E
2500|$|Externally the K series {{could be}} {{identified}} by changes in {{the locations of the}} radio equipment hatch, which was moved forward and to a higher position between frames four and five and the filler point for the fuselage fuel tank, which was moved forward to a location between frames two and three. The D/F loop was moved aft to sit between frames three and four on the fuselage spine and a small circular plate above the footstep on the port side of the fuselage was deleted. The rudder was fitted as standard with a Flettner tab and two fixed tabs although some rare examples were not fitted with the fixed tabs. All K-4s were to be fitted with a long retractable tail wheel (...) with two small clamshell doors covering the recess when the <b>tail-wheel</b> was retracted.|$|E
2500|$|After {{the first}} few flights K5054 was {{returned}} to the factory, reappearing about 10 days later with an overall pale blue-grey finish, using a high-gloss automotive nitrocellulose-lacquer applied by people from the Rolls-Royce car plant (there is still some uncertainty over the actual colour). The tailskid originally fitted {{had been replaced by}} a Dowty manufactured, fully castoring <b>tail-wheel</b> unit. This tailwheel was to be modified several times on the prototype, including using twin tailwheels each smaller than the single wheel which was later standardised. The engine cowlings had been altered slightly and the angled fin tip had become straight topped – the rudder balance was correspondingly reduced in size. Undercarriage fairings had now been fitted to the legs. Although the propeller was still the fixed-pitch, wooden bladed unit the pitch had been changed in an attempt to increase the top speed. Several different types of propeller unit were to be fitted to the prototype. Later in 1936, the wings were replaced with a set which, for the first time, incorporated the famous eight [...]303" [...] Browning machine-gun armament.|$|E
2500|$|Variable {{incidence}} {{allowed the}} fuselage {{to be kept}} at the optimum angle for good visibility whilst maintaining lift – particularly useful for a carrier-borne aircraft and with <b>tail-wheel</b> undercarriage. [...] The incidence could be varied from 2 degrees when the flap setting was neutral, to 16 degrees when the flaps were lowered to 60 degrees. [...] The lift coefficient with the wing at this setting was 3.9 (double that of conventional and contemporary aircraft), giving a stalling speed of 57 knots. Since it was intended for carrier use, the wing also folded – a remarkable technical achievement {{in view of the}} small increase in structural weight involved. The undercarriage was a fixed tailwheel type to save complexity. It would have been very challenging to retract the landing gear into the wings. It was primarily of wooden construction, in common with the Armstrong Whitworth Albemarle bomber since, when it was being built, there was a danger of light alloy being in short supply. [...] The Exe was cancelled in 1938, and the Rolls-Royce Merlin was substituted in the design.|$|E
2500|$|The VIT-2 {{was derived}} from the VIT-1 prototype, but it was given [...] Klimov M-105 engines and its {{structure}} was revised. It was a low-winged, twin-engined aircraft with a mixed structure. The monocoque fuselage was made in halves of 'shpon', molded birch plywood and a large fuel tank was placed between the pilot and rear gunner. The fuel tank was moved to the rear and the canopy was lengthened in consequence. The wing structure was built from a mix of steel tubes and duralumin with a duralumin skin. The empennage was redesigned as a twin tail. The main legs of the conventional landing gear retracted aft into the engine nacelles and were given fairing to reduce drag when retracted, but the <b>tail-wheel</b> was fixed. The nose was extensively glazed to give the bombardier/navigator good visibility and he was armed with a [...] ShVAK cannon with 10° of vertical travel. The rear gunner/radio operator sat in a manually operated turret armed with another ShVAK and he was also provided with a retractable pair of [...] ShKAS machine guns for ventral defense. Two [...] Shpitalnyi Sh-37 cannon and two more ShVAKs were mounted in the wing roots. Up to [...] of bombs could be carried internally in the fuselage or a pair of [...] FAB-500 bombs could be carried under the wings.|$|E

50|$|The {{asymmetric}} blade {{effect is}} dependent on thrust, and is proportional to forward velocity (specifically CAS) and, while generally insignificant during the initial ground roll for <b>tail-wheel</b> aircraft, will give a pronounced nose-left tendency during the later stages of the ground roll, particularly if the thrust axis is kept inclined to the flight path vector (i.e. <b>tail-wheel</b> in contact with runway). If a high angle of attack is used during the rotation (or indeed {{straight and level flight}} with high power and high angle of attack), then the effect can also be apparent. The effect is not so apparent during the landing, flare and rollout, given the relatively low power setting (propeller RPM). However, should the throttle be suddenly advanced with the <b>tail-wheel</b> in contact with the runway, then anticipation of this nose-left tendency is prudent.|$|E

50|$|This composite-construction {{aircraft}} features three lifting surfaces: A {{front wing}} with approximately half {{the span of}} the main wing and a classical cruciform empennage. Front and main wings are connected {{by a pair of}} struts with square cross-section which also serve as fuel tanks. Both wings carry Fowler flaps on part of their span for STOL. The fixed <b>tail-wheel</b> undercarriage has four low-pressure, small-diameter main-wheels, on two cantilever spring struts,with a spring mounted <b>tail-wheel</b> assembly. The four-seat cabin is completely enclosed with a combination of flat, squared and outward-bulged tear-drop shaped windows.|$|E
