40|$|Discrete random {{structures}} are important tools in Bayesian nonparametrics {{and the resulting}} models have proven effective in density estimation, clustering, topic modeling and prediction, among others. In this paper, we consider nested processes and study the dependence structures they induce. Dependence ranges between homogeneity, corresponding to full exchangeability, and maximum heterogeneity, corresponding to (unconditional) independence across samples. The popular nested Dirichlet process is shown to degenerate to the fully exchangeable case when there are ties across samples at the observed or latent level. To overcome this drawback, inherent to nesting general discrete random measures, we introduce a novel class of latent nested processes. These are obtained by adding common and group-specific completely random measures and, <b>then,</b> <b>normalising</b> to yield dependent random probability measures. We provide results on the partition distributions induced by latent nested processes, and develop an Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampler for Bayesian inferences.

We find that both the median SFR and SSFR are enhanced in interacting galaxies, and more so as the degree of interaction is higher. The increase is moderate, reaching a maximum of a factor of 1. 9 for the highest degree of interaction (mergers). While the SFR and SSFR are enhanced statistically by interactions, in many individual interacting galaxies they are not enhanced at all.

40|$|This essay {{comes from}} pondering the relationship, queried in the Call for this Special Issue, between the 'language of diversity' and the 'embracing of {{different}} forms of knowledge and ways of knowing' in the university. The issue of diversity is usually a sociological rather than an epistemological one - the access to and inclusion in higher education of individuals from under-represented groups, groups defined by previous education qualifications, class, ethnicity or gender. But the presumption of access courses, at least, is that such personal diversity, once (hopefully) welcomed into the university, is <b>then</b> <b>normalised</b> (inter alia, Lillis & Turner, 2001).

40|$|All Statistics {{measurements}} {{which represent}} {{the values of}} useful unknown quantities have a realm that is both finite and discrete. Thus our uncertainties about any measurement can be represented by discrete probability. Nonetheless, common statistical practice treats probability distributions as representable by continuous densities or mixture densities. Many statistical problems involve the analysis of sequences of observations that the researcher regards exchangeably. Often we wish to find a joint probability mass function over X 1, X 2,..., Xn with interim interest in the sequence of updated probability mass functions f (xi+ 1 | Xi = xi) for i = 1, 2,..., n - 1. We investigate how well continuous conjugate theory can approximate real discrete mass functions in various measurement settings. Interest centres on approximating digital Normal mass functions and digital parametric mixtures with continuous Mixture Normal and Normal-Gamma Mixture Normal distributions for such items as E (Xi+ 1 | Xi = xi) and V (Xi+ 1 | Xi = xi). Digital mass functions are generated by specifying a finite realm of measurements for a quantity of interest, finding a density value of some specified functions at each point, and <b>then</b> <b>normalising</b> the densities over the realm to generate mass values.

40|$|An {{approach}} for quantification of time-of-flight (ToF) -SIMS depth profiling data is demonstrated using an independently characterised multilayer, an AlGaAs/GaAs stack from {{certified reference material}} BAM-L 200. The sample was studied with a Bi cluster ion source as the analysis projectile and a Cs+ sputter beam. Under these conditions, the negative secondary ion yield is significantly enhanced, especially for cluster ions comprising all possible elemental combinations. Each cluster ion carries a number of sputtered neutrals so if all cluster ions containing an element could be collected and identified, a large population of secondary neutrals {{will be included in}} the analysis, improving the analytical signal and approaching a ‘matrix-effect-free’ measurement. By measuring the intensities of a range of secondary cluster ions of AliGajAsk− where i, j, k are integers such 0, 1, 2, and so on, the atomic counts for each major element were accumulated based on the elemental contents of those cluster ions. The summed atomic counts were <b>then</b> <b>normalised</b> without using the more common approach of applying relative sensitivity factors.

40|$|Abstract Background and Aim: The {{significance}} of serum gamma glutamyltransferase activity and its dynamics {{have not been}} well investigated in Asian patients with idiopathic neonatal hepatitis. This study aimed to explore the significance in Mainland China. Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed in 38 cases with a diagnosis of idiopathic neonatal hepatitis. Their prognosis was compared between low or high gamma glutamyltransferase groups, and the mechanics of biochemical parameters were analysed. Results: Poor prognosis was found in 5 out of 6 patients with low gamma glutamyltransferase, compared to 3 out of 32 patients with high gamma glutamyltransferase (P= 0. 001). Dynamic analysis found that serum gamma glutamyltransferase levels gradually rose to a peak and <b>then</b> <b>normalised</b> along with a remission of jaundice in patients with good prognosis. However, the serum gamma glutamyltransferase level was consistently low {{in spite of the}} fluctuations of bilirubin and aminotransferases level in 5 cases with poor prognosis.

40|$|The {{prediction}} of flow rate and local pressure for Darcian flow through porous media that is non-homogenous {{in the direction}} of bulk fluid flow has previously been achieved through the use of numerical simulations. This thesis develops a model to predict Darcian flow behaviour by building a non-dimensional representation of flow through Cartesian geometries that are non-homogeneous along the direction of bulk flow. To construct the model, simulations were conducted in COMSOL™ by numerically modelling laminar flow through a tortuous Cartesian geometry and <b>then</b> <b>normalising</b> the results to produce a non-dimensional representation of flow behaviour {{as a function of the}} geometry. Through this method the permeability of the simulation domain was related to geometrical parameters. By splitting the geometry into simply defined ‘blocks’ the relationship between the permeability of the block to fluid flow was clearly defined with regard to the characteristic block length. The simulations were conducted across two case studies. The first case study examined the flow characteristics through a geometry with the characteristic length varying along the direction of bulk fluid flow. The major outcome of this case study was to prove that the block permeability was proportional to the square of the characteristic length of the block. In addition it is shown that the when the geometry varies, the flow rate and local pressure through a tortuous series of connected non-homogeneous blocks could be predicted using a linear equation within a maximum error of - 0. 4 % and ~ 2 Pa (when the total pressure drop was 1000 Pa) respectively. The second case study expanded the length variation to include the variation of the characteristic lengths perpendicular to the direction of bulk fluid flow. The resulting data was used to create a model that successfully predicts the permeability, flow rate and local pressure through tortuous geometries that are non-homogeneous parallel and perpendicular to the path of bulk fluid flow. Local pressure was predicted with a maximum error of 2. 5 Pa. The model developed in this thesis provides the foundation for developing a method that could decouple Fluid-Solid interface simulations in the field of deformable porous media, other future directions for this research are also discussed. Currently, the method can provide a tool to predict Darcian flow through non-homogeneous porous media...|$|R
