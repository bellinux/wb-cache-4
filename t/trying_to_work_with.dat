[...] According to Rappaport, Flocabulary has made [...] "social responsibility a core value [...] and never [...] it get overshadowed by our revenue goals," [...] and, [...] "we're trying to make this as affordable as possible, because unfortunately the schools with money aren't necessarily the schools that need Flocabulary.

Nolan had been <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> the actor for years and met him several times, {{but was unable to}} {{convince}} him to appear in any of his films until Inception. DiCaprio finally agreed because he was [...] "intrigued by this concept—this dream-heist notion and how this character's going to unlock his dreamworld and ultimately affect his real life." [...] He read the script and found it to be [...] "very well written, comprehensive but you really had to have Chris in person, to try to articulate {{some of the things that}} have been swirling around his head for the last eight years." [...] DiCaprio and Nolan spent months talking about the screenplay. Nolan took a long time re-writing the script in order [...] "to make sure that the emotional journey of his character was the driving force of the movie." [...] On February 11, 2009, it was announced that Warner Bros. purchased Inception, a spec script written by Nolan.|$|E

2500|$|The limited {{schedule}} for Live It Up meant that DeWyze {{had to write}} his songs while on tour, which he found to be an overwhelming task. He has said {{this was one of}} the reasons for why the album did not live up to expectations and has also explained that there was pressure in <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> a large number of people, all of whom had their own ideas. He described the situation as [...] "one of those too-many-cooks-in-the-kitchen kind of things". Although DeWyze felt that he and RCA were not thinking the same thing regarding his musical style, he still had high hopes about recording a second album with them and trying to take it in a different direction, but in September 2011, he was dismissed by the label. He said that this was disheartening and not what he would have expected, but that the decision was [...] "fairly mutual" [...] and followed a series of talks between him and RCA.|$|E
2500|$|James {{released}} {{their fourth}} studio album Seven in 1992 to critical and commercial acclaim. Lead single [...] "Born of Frustration" [...] became their biggest {{hit in the}} United States at the time, becoming a Top 5 hit on modern rock radio, and the band opened for Neil Young on the tour supporting his most recent album, Harvest Moon. [...] The band {{spent the rest of}} the year touring before reconvening to begin work on their next album, Laid (1993). The band's tour with Young had proven influential on the album, especially because Young requested they play acoustically, something James had never done outside of radio sessions. The band's new stripped down approach for the album was helped by its producer Brian Eno. Working with Eno was a career long dream for the band, who had been <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> Eno since their first album, Stutter (1986); the band had sent demos of the song that would feature on Stutter to Eno's management but the band did not hear a reply, and they had consistently tried to work with him since. In the early stages of writing Laid, Booth addressed a person letter to Eno with a cassette of demos, and was surprised when Eno phoned him back, agreeing to produce the album.|$|E
2500|$|The show's {{pilot was}} written by Cannell, who also wrote 36 episodes and was the show's co-creator. Juanita Bartlett, one of the show's {{producers}} and Garner's partner at Cherokee Productions, wrote 34 episodes. [...] She also wrote for Scarecrow and Mrs. King, The Greatest American Hero, and In the Heat of the Night. David Chase wrote 16 episodes; he later went on to Northern Exposure and The Sopranos. The show's co-creator, Roy Huggins, also wrote for the show during the first season, always using pen name John Thomas James. However, Huggins' contributions to the show ended midway through the first season, after he submitted a script rewrite direct to set as the episode was shooting, without getting approval from any other writer or producer. [...] Garner, <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> the material on set, felt the rewrite was unsatisfactory, and could not figure out why it had been approved for shooting. [...] When he discovered that neither Cannell nor {{any of the other}} production staff members knew anything about the rewrite, Garner issued a directive that Cannell, not Huggins, had final say on all script material. [...] Though Huggins was credited as a producer for the entire run of the series, this effectively ended his creative involvement with the show, as he submitted no further material to The Rockford Files and did not involve himself in the day-to-day running of the series.|$|E
