Abu Nidal was expelled from Libya in 1999, and in 2002 he returned to Iraq. The Iraqi government later said he had entered the country using a fake Yemeni passport and false name.|$|E
5|$|The robbery {{also made}} the Bolshevik Centre unpopular more widely among European social democrat groups. Lenin's desire <b>to</b> <b>distance</b> <b>himself</b> <b>from</b> {{the legacy of the}} robbery may {{have been one of the}} sources of the rift between him and Bogdanov and Krasin. Stalin distanced himself from Kamo's gang and never publicized his role in the robbery.|$|E
5|$|Although {{they were}} still allies, San Martín began <b>to</b> <b>distance</b> <b>himself</b> <b>from</b> Alvear, who {{controlled}} the Assembly and the lodge. Alvear opposed the merchants and the Uruguayan caudillo José Gervasio Artigas, San Martín {{thought that it was}} risky to open such conflicts when the royalists were still a threat. The Army of the North, which was operating at the Upper Peru, was defeated at the battles of Vilcapugio and Ayohuma, so the triumvirate appointed San Martín to head it, replacing Manuel Belgrano.|$|E

He later stated that he used the album <b>to</b> <b>distance</b> <b>himself</b> <b>from</b> Pink Floyd. Soon afterwards, Waters began touring his first solo album, The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking. Wright formed Zee with Dave Harris and recorded Identity, which went almost unnoticed upon its release. Mason released his second solo album, Profiles, in August 1985.|$|E
5|$|Goebbels {{was educated}} at a Christian Gymnasium, where he {{completed}} his Abitur (university entrance examination) in 1917.

His parents initially hoped that he would become a Catholic priest, and Goebbels seriously considered it. He studied literature and history at the universities of Bonn, Würzburg, Freiburg, and Munich, aided by a scholarship from the Albertus Magnus Society. By this time Goebbels had begun <b>to</b> <b>distance</b> <b>himself</b> <b>from</b> the church.|$|E

5|$|Isolated {{inside the}} Tower, the royal {{government}} {{was in a}} state of shock at the turn of events. The King left the castle that morning and made his way to negotiate with the rebels at Mile End in east London, taking only a very small bodyguard with him. The King left Sudbury and Hales behind in the Tower, either for their own safety or because Richard had decided it would be safer <b>to</b> <b>distance</b> <b>himself</b> <b>from</b> his unpopular ministers. Along the way, several Londoners accosted the King to complain about alleged injustices.|$|E

Bell's supporters attempted to convince O'Malley to run for City Council President, but O'Malley announced his decision to run for mayor in June, becoming the first major candidate in the race who was Caucasian. He began the campaign largely unknown outside of Northeast Baltimore.|$|E

5|$|Towards {{the end of}} {{his time}} at the college Ketèlbey wrote lighter, mostly mandolin-based, compositions.

On leaving the college he became one of its examiners in harmony. He wrote piano pieces as part of his role, and used the pseudonym Anton Vodorinski for the work; he subsequently used the name for more serious works, which he published with French titles.|$|E

5|$|Discontent with Richard's actions {{manifested}} itself in the summer after he {{took control of the}} country, as a conspiracy emerged to displace him from the throne. The rebels were mostly loyalists to Edward IV, who saw Richard as a usurper. Their plans were coordinated by a Lancastrian, Henry's mother Lady Margaret, who was promoting her son as a candidate for the throne. The highest-ranking conspirator was Buckingham. No chronicles tell of the duke's motive in joining the plot, although historian Charles Ross proposes that Buckingham was trying <b>to</b> <b>distance</b> <b>himself</b> <b>from</b> a king who was becoming increasingly unpopular with the people. Michael Jones and Malcolm Underwood suggest that Margaret deceived Buckingham into thinking the rebels supported him to be king.|$|E

5|$|Jameson did {{not regard}} this {{ambiguity}} as a proper answer, and impatiently waited for further {{word from the}} king. After standing by for the specified two days and receiving nothing, he correctly concluded that Lobengula was stalling him, and using the extra time <b>to</b> <b>distance</b> <b>himself</b> <b>from</b> his former capital. Jameson therefore made good on his pledge, and called for volunteers; he assembled a host of about 470 men, mixed together from the Mashonaland Mounted Police, the Bechuanaland Border Police, and Raaff's Rangers, an independent unit led by the eponymous Commandant Piet Raaff. This force was placed under Forbes's command, with three Maxim guns attached. Jameson told the major to scout the area between Shiloh and Inyati for spoor, with the ultimate objective of capturing Lobengula, and sent him out just before sunset on 14 November 1893.|$|E
5|$|One of Metternich's first tasks was to {{push for}} the {{marriage}} of Napoleon to Archduchess Marie Louise {{rather than to the}} Tsar's youngest sister Anna Pavlovna. Metternich would later seek <b>to</b> <b>distance</b> <b>himself</b> <b>from</b> the marriage by claiming it was Napoleon's own idea, but this is improbable; in any case, he was happy to claim responsibility at the time. By 7 February Napoleon had agreed and the pair were married by proxy on 11 March. Marie Louise left for France soon after and Metternich followed by a different route and unofficially. The trip was designed, Metternich explained, to transport his family (stranded in France by the outbreak of war) home and to report to the Austrian Emperor about Marie Louise's activities.|$|E

Given Chris' resentment towards Tony about Adriana's death, and his continued desire to enter the film business, the two continue to drift apart. When he relapses to drinking after yet another confrontation with Paulie, he becomes very angry with the crew and leaves. He later ends up at his [...] "friend" [...] J.T.

When J.T. foolishly made explicit mention of Chris' membership in the Mafia, and refuses to let Chris talk out his problems that night, Chris shoots him in the head and leaves.|$|R
5|$|The harder line now {{developing}} in Russian politics led Quisling <b>to</b> <b>distance</b> <b>himself</b> <b>from</b> Bolshevism. The Soviet government had rejected outright his Armenian proposals, and obstructed {{an attempt by}} Nansen {{to help with the}} 1928 Ukrainian famine. Quisling took these rebuffs as a personal insult; in 1929, with the British now keen to take back control of their own diplomatic affairs, he left Russia. He was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) for his services to Britain, an honour revoked by King George VI in 1940. By this time, Quisling had also been awarded the Romanian Crown Order and the Yugoslav Order of St. Sava for his earlier humanitarian efforts.|$|E
5|$|Alboin was {{probably}} {{born in the}} 530s in Pannonia, the son of Audoin and his wife, Rodelinda. She {{may have been the}} niece of King Theodoric and betrothed to Audoin through the mediation of Emperor Justinian. Like his father, Alboin was raised a pagan, although Audoin had at one point attempted to gain Byzantine support against his neighbours by professing himself a Christian. Alboin took as his first wife the Christian Chlothsind, daughter of the Frankish King Chlothar. This marriage, which took place soon after the death of the Frankish ruler Theudebald in 555, is thought to reflect Audoin's decision <b>to</b> <b>distance</b> <b>himself</b> <b>from</b> the Byzantines, traditional allies of the Lombards, who had been lukewarm when it came to supporting Audoin against the Gepids. The new Frankish alliance was important because of the Franks' known hostility to the Byzantine empire, providing the Lombards with more than one option. However, the Prosopography of the Later Roman Empire interprets events and sources differently, believing that Alboin married Chlothsind when already a king in or shortly before 561, the year of Chlothar's death.|$|E
5|$|Born on Korhal IV, the {{scion of}} a {{powerful}} founding family of the Terran Confederacy, Mengsk was a colonel in the Confederate Marine Corps and {{a veteran of the}} Guild Wars, who became a successful prospector after war's end. Though trying <b>to</b> <b>distance</b> <b>himself</b> <b>from</b> the actions of his father, a prominent Korhal senator and vocal dissident against the Confederacy, Mengsk became a revolutionary himself when his father, mother, and younger sister were murdered by Confederate assassins. His activities soon spurred the Confederacy to launch a nuclear attack against Korhal, wiping out its population; Mengsk swore vengeance, and formed a revolutionary group he called the Sons of Korhal. Years of open conflict successfully weakened Confederate control over the fringe worlds, during which he recruited followers such as Sarah Kerrigan, Jim Raynor and Edmund Duke. Raynor and Kerrigan grew uneasy with Mengsk's increasingly extreme methods, namely luring Zerg to attack Confederate targets, leading to Mengsk abandoning Kerrigan to the Zerg on the Confederate capital of Tarsonis (another reason for the latter was Kerrigan had been the assassin that murdered his father). With the destruction of Tarsonis by the Zerg, Mengsk crowned himself emperor and styled himself as a benevolent dictator.|$|E
