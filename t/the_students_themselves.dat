25|$|The {{community}} language learning (CLL) {{is a method}} proposed by Charles A. Curran during the 1970s. It {{is based on the}} counseling approach in which the teacher is seen as a counselor.

Both these student bodies co-ordinate with the Students' Welfare Division (SWD) branch of the administration. These elections are also used for the election of students to other posts, i.e. Sports' Secretary, Hostel Representatives, etc.|$|E

500|$|Undergraduates are {{guaranteed}} four-year housing {{in one of}} MIT's 12 undergraduate dormitories. Those living on campus can receive support and mentoring from live-in graduate student tutors, resident advisors, and faculty housemasters. Because housing assignments are made based on the preferences of <b>the</b> <b>students</b> <b>themselves,</b> diverse social atmospheres can be sustained in different living groups; for example, according to the Yale Daily News staff's The Insider's Guide to the Colleges, 2010, [...] "The split between East Campus and West Campus is a significant characteristic of MIT.

500|$|In the 1960s onwards, {{there was}} a certain progressiveness in the air, and the first women guests were {{admitted}} in 1964. Women members were first admitted to the 1974–5 year.

It was also almost completely secular– {{with the exception of the}} chaplain and his deputies; the chaplain's role itself dominated by pastoral work. <b>The</b> <b>students</b> <b>themselves</b> concentrated more and more on the exams– marks improved across the university– but this left a class gulf between some staff and undergraduates, most visible in [...] "gentlemanly" [...] sports. Michael Palin and Robert Hewison were among new creative talent.

Brasenose's traditional link with the north-west also floundered, although it is perhaps surprising that it lasted until the 1970s. In its place, there were more entrants, paying higher fees, from elsewhere in the world.|$|E

500|$|Barbauld and {{her husband}} spent eleven years {{teaching}} at Palgrave Academy in Suffolk. Early on, Barbauld was not only responsible for running her own household, but also the school's—she was accountant, maid, and housekeeper. The school opened with only eight boys, but when the Barbaulds left in 1785, approximately forty were enrolled, {{a testament to the}} excellent reputation the school had acquired. The Barbaulds' educational philosophy attracted Dissenters as well as Anglicans. Palgrave replaced the strict discipline of traditional schools such as Eton, which often used corporal punishment, with a system of [...] "fines and jobations" [...] and even, it seems likely, [...] "juvenile trials," [...] that is, trials run by and for <b>the</b> <b>students</b> <b>themselves.</b> Moreover, instead of the traditional classical studies, the school offered a practical curriculum that stressed science and the modern languages. Barbauld herself taught the foundational subjects of reading and religion to the youngest boys and geography, history, composition and rhetoric, and science to higher grade levels. She was a dedicated teacher, producing a [...] "weekly chronicle" [...] for the school and writing theatrical pieces for the students to perform. Barbauld {{had a profound effect on}} many of her students; one who went on to great success, William Taylor, a preeminent scholar of German literature, referred to Barbauld as [...] "the mother of his mind." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{their book}} Education in Popular Culture, Alma Harris, Roy Fisher, Ann Harris, and Christine Jarvis {{analyzes}} the adult education {{aspects of this}} episode that portrays adult learners as [...] "stupid and lazy". After Homer is appointed as a teacher, he feels immensely proud and boasts to all his acquaintances about it, initially making it seem like if the show is indicating that adult education tutors have a relatively high status in society. [...] "However," [...] the authors added, [...] "Homer's pride is undercut for the audience by the awareness of {{how he came to}} be appointed and by the subsequent representation of the adult education center. It seems that anyone can become a tutor. [...] Homer's fellow tutors are drunks, incompetents and down-and-outs, adult education is therefore presented as an amateur business staffed by the dregs of society." [...] The writers of the book thought the whole idea of storytelling and building on experience that Homer uses, and that many adult education tutors uses in real life, is represented in the episode [...] "simply as an excuse for gossip and prurient curiosity". They also thought that statements like [...] "I can't believe I paid ten thousand dollars for this course. What the heck was the lab fee for?" [...] imply that adult education is [...] "exploitative and poor value for money, and that <b>the</b> <b>students</b> <b>themselves</b> contribute to this by demanding an essentially recreational service." [...] The authors concluded that the episode [...] "certainly sustains a popular view of adult education as pointless and recreational. Similarly, no value whatsoever is attributed to the extensively researched, proven through practice and well-argued perspective that adult learners do best when the curriculum builds on and values their experience." ...|$|E

2500|$|Of course, {{achieving}} such a {{goal is not}} automatic nor easy, as {{he suggests}} {{that the role of}} the teacher is critical to this process. Students need to be helped by teachers to separate themselves from unconditional acceptance of the conditions of their own existence. Once this separation is achieved, then students may be prepared for critical re-entry into an examination of everyday life. In a classroom environment that achieves such liberating intent, one of the potential outcomes is that <b>the</b> <b>students</b> <b>themselves</b> assume more responsibility for the class. Power is thus distributed amongst the group {{and the role of the}} teacher becomes much more mobile, not to mention more challenging.

Lee quickly reversed this rule, requiring most students to board off-campus, and allowing only the most mature {{to live in the}} dorms as a mark of privilege; the results of this policy were considered a success. A typical account by a professor there states that [...] "the students fairly worshipped him, and deeply dreaded his displeasure; yet so kind, affable, and gentle was he toward them that all loved to approach him. ...
