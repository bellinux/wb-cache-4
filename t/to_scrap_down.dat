The importance of the opportunity cost of operating an older wind turbine is {{shown to be a}} prominent factor in the decision <b>to</b> <b>scrap.</b> I show the strong effect that renewable energy policy plays in the decision <b>to</b> <b>scrap</b> a turbine.

I also obtain the, initially, counter-intuitive result that more effective wind turbines have a higher hazard of being scrapped. Wind Power; Denmark; Empirical; Duration Models; Scrapping...|$|R
