500|$|Critics {{compared}} [...] "Hate That I Love You" [...] {{to previous}} works by Ne-Yo. Nick Levine from Digital Spy called the song a [...] "second cousin" [...] of Ne-Yo's singles [...] "Sexy Love" [...] and [...] "Because of You". Regarding the lyrics, Rihanna said, [...] "When you're {{in love with}} someone, even though they keep hurting you, you're so naive and you love them so much <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>put</b> all the negative behind even though you keep getting hurt." ...|$|E
500|$|On 10 August, Eugene sent {{an urgent}} {{dispatch}} reporting {{that he was}} falling back to Donauwörth – [...] "The enemy have marched. It is almost certain that the whole army is crossing the Danube at Lauingen ... The plain of Dillingen is crowded with troops ... Everything, milord, consists in speed and <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>put</b> yourself forthwith in movement to join me tomorrow, without which I fear {{it will be too}} late." [...] By a series of brilliant marches Marlborough concentrated his forces on Donauwörth and, by noon 11 August, the link-up was complete.|$|E
500|$|Prop master Rob Smith {{created the}} shapeshifter device and later regretted its design. He {{had joined the}} series during its second season, and had to quickly {{manufacture}} props while working under time and budget constraints. He explained, [...] " [...] first episode {{we had to make}} the shape-shifter device, the thing <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>put</b> into your mouth and it transforms one person into another person. I was brand new here and I wasn’t happy with the way that turned out, and it came back in about 5 or 6 episodes. Every time it came back I was like, ‘Oh, I wish I could have that time over again to redo this one." [...] He added, [...] "A lot of the time, I [...] actually see [...] on set, so I watched the episode to see how everything comes together." ...|$|E
5000|$|Regarding the song, McGraw told Great American Country, [...] "I hope it’s {{a record}} <b>that</b> <b>you</b> can <b>put</b> on and {{just sort of}} melt into. And that’s what the purpose was for it. We wanted a sort of earthiness <b>that</b> when <b>you</b> <b>put</b> this thing on, {{it just sort of}} kicks out all over you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I can see that," [...] said I, [...] "but I {{want one}} <b>that</b> <b>you</b> can <b>put</b> in a cradle--one {{that will have}} to stay there, when <b>you</b> <b>put</b> it in." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Wasn't it {{a curious}} {{thing that they}} should run in little Altro's head? Eh?' said Pancks as he smoked. 'Wasn't <b>that</b> how <b>you</b> <b>put</b> it?' ...|$|R
500|$|Various {{illegal drugs}} are {{taken by the}} {{characters}} {{during the course of}} the show, most notably a hallucinogen during the trip sequence. [...] The song [...] "Walking in Space" [...] begins the sequence, and the lyrics celebrate the experience declaring [...] "how dare they try to end this beauty ... in this dive we rediscover sensation ... our eyes are open, wide, wide, wide". [...] Similarly, in the song [...] "Donna", Berger sings that [...] "I'm evolving through the drugs <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>put</b> down." [...] At another point, Jeanie smokes marijuana and dismisses the critics of [...] "pot". [...] Generally, the tribe favors hallucinogenic or [...] "mind expanding" [...] drugs, such as LSD and marijuana, while disapproving of other drugs such as speed and depressants. [...] For example, Jeanie, after revealing that she is pregnant by a [...] "speed freak", says that [...] "methedrine is a bad scene". [...] The song [...] "Hashish" [...] provides a list of pharmaceuticals, both illegal and legal, including cocaine, alcohol, LSD, opium and Thorazine, which is used as an antipsychotic.|$|E
2500|$|While Yanni {{has said}} that new age is [...] "a spiritual {{definition}} more than a musical definition," [...] his music has been said to be [...] "adopted by" [...] the New Age movement as it gained mainstream momentum. His music is also called contemporary instrumental and {{has been described as}} [...] "an instrumental blend of fusion-jazz, world music, classical, and soft rock." [...] However, at least as early as 1988, Yanni was said to shun labels such as [...] "Greek" [...] and [...] "new age," [...] emphasizing that [...] "when someone says new age music, I think of something <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>put</b> on in the background while you're vacuuming the house. I don't want to relax the audience; I want to engage them in the music, get them interested." [...] Distinguishing his work from what others have called ambient mood music, Yanni pointed out in 1994: [...] "New age implies a more subdued, more relaxed music than what I do. My music can be very rhythmic, very energetic, even very ethnic." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The letter <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>put</b> on Mr. Keller's desk," [...] {{she said}} pleasantly. [...] "This time, David, I act {{as my own}} postman--at Mr. Keller's request." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Certainly not," [...] said Fraser, sternly, [...] "but it’s quite private for all <b>that.</b> Will <b>you</b> <b>put</b> {{your hat}} on {{and come out}} a little way, Miss Tyrell?" ...|$|R
60|$|DEAR SIR,--Necessarily I cannot assent to {{so strange}} a proposition. And I think it but fair to warn <b>you</b> <b>that</b> if <b>you</b> <b>put</b> the {{piece on the}} stage, you must take the legal consequences.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mine hasn't {{come to me}} yet," [...] said St. Clare, [...] "though I'll bear {{testimony}} <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>put</b> it into me pretty thoroughly when I was a boy."' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Say, look here!" [...] {{burst out}} Stanley, striding forward. [...] "Do {{you mean to}} say, Tom Rover, <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>put</b> that cap on the old well on purpose?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't exult; {{that was}} only an oversight, not a {{deliberate}} deception like <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>put</b> upon me. It was very wrong and rude, and I shall not forgive it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And yet, I daresay," [...] {{suggested}} Robina, [...] "that if one {{put it into}} a book--I mean <b>that</b> if <b>you</b> <b>put</b> it into a book, {{it would}} read amusingly." ...|$|R
5000|$|... “I {{love the}} fact <b>that</b> what <b>you</b> <b>put</b> into it {{is what you get}} out of it, and it is not left to a random individual’s opinion like {{physique}} competitions.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Good Lord! I hadn't {{thought of}} <b>that.</b> Can <b>you</b> <b>put</b> {{a few things}} in a bag when she isn't looking, and sneak them down {{to me at the}} St. Aurea?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "See <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>put</b> our sharpest {{pair of eyes}} in the bow, and let {{a second}} pair watch the first, lest the owner of them should go to sleep." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{what do you}} suppose, you {{conceited}} female," [...] said Mr. Cruncher, with unconscious inconsistency, [...] "that {{the worth}} of your prayers may be? Name the price <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>put</b> your prayers at!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sara Stanley!" [...] Felicity flew {{across the}} kitchen. [...] "Do you mean <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>put</b> the bread {{right into the}} oven after you kneaded it without leaving it to rise a second time?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{thought you}} swore on your honour {{to your wife}} <b>that</b> <b>you</b> wouldn't <b>put</b> your name to paper," [...] said Mr. Altamont, puffing at his cigar.|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't send me away so soon, Arthur," [...] she returned. [...] "What {{is it that}} I {{could not}} forgive? You should not say <b>that</b> before <b>you</b> <b>put</b> me to the test." ...|$|R
60|$|Every {{heart is}} the lair of a ferocious animal. The {{greatest}} wrong <b>that</b> <b>you</b> can <b>put</b> upon {{a man is}} to provoke him to let out his beast.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] she answered, {{with the}} courage that {{characterized}} her, [...] "I {{thought you were}} rather calculating, <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>put</b> too high a price on success. Of course you attracted me. I own it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have thought}} of an alternative, sir captain; but it depends upon your charity. It is <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>put</b> us ashore {{on one of the}} islands of this pestilent archipelago, and leave us to shift for ourselves." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This is queer plantin', Jamie," [...] put in Joel, [...] "and queerer grain {{will come}} of it. Do {{you think these}} young {{chestnuts}} will ever grow, ag'in, <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>put</b> them out in rows, like so much corn?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Jown the {{slippery}} glasses," [...] said Grandfer Cantle. [...] "What's {{the good of}} a thing <b>that</b> <b>you</b> can't <b>put</b> down in the ashes to warm, hey, neighbours; that's what I ask?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{must not}} do <b>that.</b> <b>You</b> have <b>put</b> {{yourself}} into a boat with these men, and you must remain in the boat. I should have thought all that was easy to you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Tell {{him if he}} doesn't {{send them}} on by express at once <b>that</b> <b>you</b> will <b>put</b> {{the case in the}} hands of the law," [...] said Phil. [...] "That will scare him." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Oh! John Barret, has town life so marred your once fine intellect, <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>put</b> such a {{question}} in earnest? Suppose I answer it by another: What would become of the country if all men thought and acted as you do?" ...|$|E
6000|$|At this {{proclamation}} of supreme virtue, {{the look on}} Thyme's face was very queer. 'You don't trust me,' it seemed to say, 'and <b>you</b> trust <b>that</b> girl. <b>You</b> <b>put</b> me here for her to watch over me!...' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nothing <b>that</b> <b>you</b> {{may have}} done {{troubles}} me in the least," [...] she assured him. [...] "I do wish <b>that</b> <b>you</b> could <b>put</b> it all {{out of your mind}} and let me help you to make a fresh start." ...|$|R
