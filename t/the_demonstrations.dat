5|$|A larger demonstration, the 8N, {{took place}} two months later. It was {{attended}} by {{nearly half a million}} people. They protested a variety of issues such as those of the previous demonstration, as well as the growing rate of inflation and the corruption scandals. Kirchner promised to keep her policies unchanged, and Senator Aníbal Fernández dismissed the significance of <b>the</b> <b>demonstrations.</b> Journalist Jorge Lanata explained the polarization was because the government and its supporters thought they were engaged in a revolution, and this justified being against freedom of the press and other public rights. Cabinet Chief Juan Manuel Abal Medina said the demonstrators belonged to a class that was against social justice, and compared <b>the</b> <b>demonstrations</b> to a coup d'état. A similar view was held by Kirchner's loyalists.|$|E
5|$|In 1903, Zaprešić {{railway station}} was a sight of two anti-Hungarian demonstrations caused by {{installing}} of panes with Hungarian inscriptions on railway objects across Croatia. <b>The</b> <b>demonstrations</b> {{were part of}} a wider national movement that swept the country at a time. In both occasions <b>the</b> <b>demonstrations</b> turned into a scuffle with local gendarmes which ended up with several peasants killed and dozens of locals arrested. Peasants that were killed or injuerd by the gendarmes are traditionally celebrated as a heroes and national martyrs. In their honour, two separate memorial boards were placed on the building of Zaprešić railway station in 1928. and 2003. After the First World War, the oldest meat industry in Croatia, the Industrija mesnih proizvoda, was founded.|$|E

2500|$|However, as <b>the</b> <b>demonstration</b> {{began at}} Rådhuspladsen, it was {{attended}} by well over 2000 masked demonstrators.

The obstacles had been prepared in advance, built over the summer in the courtyard behind the house, and they were not the only preparations the squatters had made. Most of them were wearing blue overall work suits, ski masks, and combat boots. Many of them were also wearing motorcycle helmets and carrying clubs and iron bars for close-quarters fighting with the police, and several were equipped with powerful slingshots. On top of that, several hundred Molotov cocktails were now being carried to the barricades.

5|$|As <b>the</b> <b>demonstrations</b> continued, Ambassador Nolting {{managed to}} extract {{theoretical}} concessions from Diệm on 18 May. Diệm agreed a modest compensation package of USD $7000 {{for the families}} of the victims as a conciliatory gesture. Diệm also agreed to dismiss those responsible for the shootings. However, the publicly stated reason for this action was that the officials had failed to maintain order, rather than that they had been responsible for the deaths of the protesters. Despite these concessions, Diệm maintained that his government was not responsible for the deaths, resolutely continuing to blame the Việt Cộng. It was enough to satisfy Nolting, who immediately departed for his vacation. His absence allowed the remaining American diplomatic staff led by William Trueheart, Nolting's deputy, to end Nolting's policy of appeasing Diệm.|$|E

40|$|A {{welfare reform}} {{demonstration}} {{program designed to}} reduce Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) recidivism through increased employment and training services resulted in significantly higher short-term caseload growth.

These entrants tended to have more extensive previous employment histories. This result suggests that <b>the</b> <b>demonstration</b> attracted individuals who previously qualified for AFDC but did not apply for benefits and/or individuals who reduced their employment to qualify for AFDC. Exits from AFDC also were delayed under <b>the</b> <b>demonstration,</b> suggesting that <b>the</b> more intensive services provided through <b>the</b> <b>demonstration</b> required more time to complete.

40|$|Abstract: Objective. To {{assess the}} {{theoretical}} and practical knowledge of health care providers (HCPs) {{in relation to the}} use of metered-dose inhalers (MDIs) and spacer devices. Methods. A cross-sectional study was conducted in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, among 52 HCPs using a stratified random sampling technique. A questionnaire was used to assess theoretical knowledge; practical knowledge was assessed by direct <b>demonstration</b> of <b>the</b> use of an MDI and a spacer device. Results. Among the participants, 57 % were female. The majority provided education to their patients (92 %). Of the HCPs, 36. 5 % completed <b>the</b> <b>demonstration</b> of holding <b>the</b> spacer with a mask and MDI together and then shaking well 4 to 5 times, 78. 8 % completed <b>the</b> <b>demonstration</b> of cap removal, 15. 4 % completed <b>the</b> <b>demonstration</b> of checking for any foreign body in the spacer, 78. 8 % completed <b>the</b> <b>demonstration</b> of holding <b>the</b> device properly, 69. 2 % completed <b>the</b> <b>demonstration</b> of inhaling slowly and deeply, 55. 8 % completed <b>the</b> <b>demonstration</b> of maintaining <b>the</b> seal for 5 to 6 breaths after the MDI is pressed, 26. 9 % completed <b>the</b> <b>demonstration</b> of “if more puffs of medication are prescribed, complete these puffs, ” and 25 % completed <b>the</b> <b>demonstration</b> of washing <b>the</b> spacer with warm soapy water. The overall scores were good (16. 6 %), fair (44. 4 %), and poor (39 %). Conclusion. Most of the HCPs in this study lacked basic knowledge and skills regarding the proper way to instruct their patients to use MDIs and spacer devices. There is a need to establish continuing education programs for HCPs about asthma inhaler knowledge and technique...|$|R
5|$|Founded in 1885, the Círculo de Trabajadores {{organization}} {{concentrated on}} educational and cultural activities, hosting a secular school for 500 poor students and meetings for workers' groups.

In addition, a few days prior to the anarchists executions, the Círculo organized a demonstration of 2,000 people in Havana to protest the state's decision to execute the Americans.

Second, {{in addition to the}} endeavor of firms who participated in <b>demonstration</b> test, <b>the</b> regional government of <b>the</b> <b>demonstration</b> test area works as a coordinator to promote information sharing between firms who participated in <b>demonstration</b> test and <b>the</b> Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) of Japan who subsidize two-thirds of <b>the</b> <b>demonstration</b> test budget.
