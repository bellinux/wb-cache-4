Biochemical markers (e.g. alanine transferase, alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin) are often used to indicate liver damage. Liver injury is defined as a rise in either (a) ALT level more than three times of upper limit of normal (ULN), (b) ALP level more than twice ULN, or (c) <b>total</b> <b>bilirubin</b> level more than twice ULN when associated with increased ALT or ALP. Liver damage is further characterized into hepatocellular (predominantly initial Alanine transferase elevation) and cholestatic (initial alkaline phosphatase rise) types.

40|$|The {{accuracy}} of transcutaneous bilirubin meters has been assessed in newborns from various ethnic backgrounds. However, there are limited data on Greek newborns. Our {{study examined the}} {{accuracy of}} transcutaneous bilirubin measurements in clinically jaundiced healthy-term Greek newborns, using <b>total</b> serum <b>bilirubin</b> as the reference standard, in order to re-evaluate our local guidelines about neonatal jaundice. Clinically jaundiced newborns requiring <b>total</b> serum <b>bilirubin</b> level estimation were recruited prospectively. 368 pairs of <b>total</b> serum bilirubin/transcutaneous <b>bilirubin</b> measurements were taken in 222 newborns, using a direct spectrophotometric device and the BiliCheck device, respectively. The level of agreement between the obtained transcutaneous <b>bilirubin</b> and <b>total</b> serum <b>bilirubin</b> values was assessed. Our data were analysed using the Stata/SE 12. 0 (StataCorp LP, USA) statistical programme. The mean (± SD) TSB was 225. 4 ± 25. 4 μmol/l and the mean (± SD) TcB was 237. 9 ± 21. 0 μmol/l. The correlation between the values was poor (Pearson’s correlation coefficient 0. 439; Lin’s concordance coefficient 0. 377 [95 % CI 0. 301 to 0. 453]; P< 0. 001). The Bland-Altman analysis demonstrated that transcutaneous bilirubin measurements tended to overestimate the <b>total</b> serum <b>bilirubin</b> value (mean difference 12. 5 ± 24. 9 μmol/l), with wide 95 % limits of agreement (– 36. 2 μmol/l to 61. 3 μmol/l).

We identified a retrospective case-control population (n = 6, 649) from a single tertiary care center, Penn State Hershey Medical Center (PSU) and a validation cohort (n = 1, 996) from Virginia Commonwealth University Medical Center (VCU). Cases were age- and sex-matched to controls (PSU: CD n = 254, UC n = 187; VCU: CD n = 233, UC n = 124). <b>Total</b> serum <b>bilirubin</b> levels were obtained from de-identified medical records and segregated into quartiles. Logistic regression analysis was performed on each quartile of <b>total</b> serum <b>bilirubin</b> compared to the last quartile (highest bilirubin levels) to determine the association of <b>total</b> serum <b>bilirubin</b> with UC.

These were divided into three groups: group 1, moderate hyperbilirubinemia (n = 30; mean maximum <b>total</b> serum <b>bilirubin</b> = 320. 7 μmol/L or 18. 9 mg%); group 2, severe hyperbilirubinemia (n = 63; mean maximum <b>total</b> serum <b>bilirubin</b> = 369. 0 μmol/L or 21. 7 mg%); and group 3, super hyperbilirubinemia (n = 6; mean maximum <b>total</b> serum <b>bilirubin</b> = 457. 2 μmol/L or 26. 9 mg%). All received phototherapy, and three neonates also had exchange transfusion. Initial brainstem auditory evoked potentials were recorded in all at {{the mean age of}} 3. 1 months (range 1 - 9 months). At initial assessment, only nine neonates (9. 1 %) had abnormal brainstem auditory evoked potentials. All except two returned to normal at 2 years. These two children had a hearing threshold at 50 nHL. We then compared serial brainstem auditory evoked potentials until 2 years for these nine cases with initial abnormal brainstem auditory evoked potentials, and nine cases with initial normal brainstem auditory evoked potentials were recruited for comparison. All 99 children had regular physical, neurologic, visual, and auditory assessments every 3 to 6 months until the age of 3 years. There was no significant correlation between demographic factors (gender, gestational age, or birthweight), maximum <b>total</b> serum <b>bilirubin,</b> and <b>total</b> serum <b>bilirubin</b> at discharge with an abnormal brainstem auditory evoked potential. There {{was no significant difference in}} the rate of brainstem auditory evoked potential abnormalities between the three groups: moderate (10 %), severe (7. 9 %), and super (16. 7 %). All had normal neurodevelopmental status at 3 years. Only two children had transient mild motor delay and hypotonia, and both had normal brainstem auditory evoked potentials. There was no relationship between the abnormalities of the brainstem auditory evoked potentials and neurodevelopmental status. None of the three children receiving exchange transfusion had abnormal brainstem auditory evoked potentials or neurodevelopmental outcome. With the neurophysiologic and clinical outcomes in our cohort with severe nonhemolytic hyperbilirubinemia, we propose that the toxic effect of hyperbilirubinemia on auditory brainstem pathways might be transient provided that prompt treatment is initiated. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Objective The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effect of phenobarbital and phototherapy combination on the <b>total</b> serum <b>bilirubin</b> of the newborn infants with isoimmune hemolytic disease (IHD) and its impact on blood exchange transfusion rates. Patients and Method This single-blinded, prospective, randomized, controlled trial was conducted between March 2013 and December 2014 at the pediatric ward of two Military Hospitals in Jordan. A total of 200 full-term neonates with IHD were divided randomly into two groups: (1) the phenobarbital plus phototherapy group (n = 103), and (2) the phototherapy-only group (n = 97). Infants in group 1 received an oral dose of 2. 5 mg/kg phenobarbital every 12 hours for 3 days in addition to phototherapy. The <b>total</b> serum <b>bilirubin</b> was observed. Results Of the total 200 included newborn infants, 186 infants completed the study: 97 infants were included in group 1 and 89 infants in group 2. The difference between the mean <b>total</b> serum <b>bilirubin</b> levels at 24, 48, and 72 hours after starting the trial was clinically and statistically significant at P < 0. 05.

40|$|The {{pattern of}} serum bilirubins was {{determined}} in serum {{of humans and}} rats with unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia due to increased pigment load or defective hepatic conjugation. Bilirubin ester conjugates were present in all serum samples tested and were identified as bilirubin 1 -O-acyl glucuronides. In Gilbert's syndrome, the concentration of total conjugates was comparable to the values in healthy control subjects. Because the concentration of unconjugated pigment was increased, the fraction of conjugated relative to <b>total</b> <b>bilirubins</b> was markedly decreased. Sera from patients with Crigler-Najjar disease differed from those with Gilbert's syndrome by the higher unconjugated bilirubin levels and the undetectability of diconjugated bilirubins. A striking finding was that in hemolytic disease, the concentration of both monoconjugates and diconjugates was enhanced in parallel {{with the increase of}} unconjugated pigment. Therefore, the fraction of conjugated relative to <b>total</b> <b>bilirubins</b> remained within the normal range. As in Gilbert's syndrome, heterozygote R/APfd-j/+ rats with impaired hepatic bilirubin conjugation exhibit an increased unconjugated bilirubin level in serum, whereas the concentration of total conjugates was comparable to the values in normal rats. In serum of normal rats loaded intraperitoneally with unconjugated bilirubin, both unconjugated and mono- and diconjugated bilirubins were increased in parallel so that the ratio of unconjugated to esterified pigment remained unaffected. Decreased hepatic conjugation or increased bilirubin load was associated with a lower percentage of diconjugates relative to total conjugates both in human and rat serum. The present results are consistent with a compartmental model in which there is bidirectional transfer across the sinusoidal membrane for unconjugated bilirubin {{as well as for the}} bilirubin glucuronides. Because typical patterns of serum bilirubins are found in Gilbert's syndrome and patients with hemolytic hyperbilirubinemia, determination of esterified bilirubins in serum is of value to study the pathophysiology and the differential diagnosis of unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. status: publishe...|$|R
