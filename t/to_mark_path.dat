50|$|One aspect {{that draws}} {{tourists}} every year are the fantastic formation of speleothems {{present in the}} cave, otherwise known as stalagmites and stalactites, well as the sparkling calcite that adorns many of the cave walls. However, these beautiful natural formations are delicate and easily damaged and destroyed. Visitors in Georgies Hall, Honeycomb 1 cave and Tailender Cave have already caused serious, and in some cases, irreparable damage to speleothems and calcite formations in the caves, by tracking mud and dirt across the delicate surfaces by not sticking <b>to</b> <b>marked</b> <b>paths,</b> or due <b>to</b> irresponsible cave exploring.|$|R
50|$|The term marker {{came from}} its use <b>to</b> <b>mark</b> a <b>path</b> of links through the {{switching}} fabric. A marker's comprehensive {{view of the}} switching fabric allowed it to find and assemble a path from one terminal to another, if the links were available, unlike the earlier graded progressive systems in which a path might not be found.|$|R

40|$|New {{approaches}} to Quality-of-Service (QoS) Routing in {{wireless sensor networks}} which use different forms of learning {{are the subject of}} this paper. The Cognitive Packet Network (CPN) algorithm uses smart packets for path discovery, together with reinforcement learning and neural networks, while Self-Healing Routing (SHR) is based on an ant colony paradigm which emulates the pheromone based technique which biological ants use <b>to</b> <b>mark</b> <b>paths</b> and communicate information about paths between different insects of the same colony. In this paper we present first experimental results on a network testbed to evaluate CPN’s ability to discover paths having the shortest delay, or shortest length. Then, we present small test-bed experiments and large-scale network simulations {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} the SHR algorithm. Finally, the two approaches are compared with respect to their ability to adapt as network conditions change over time. ...|$|R

It is an alternative to radioluminescent paint. Kenner's Lightning Bug Glo-Juice was a popular non-toxic paint product in 1968, marketed at children, alongside other glow-in-the-dark toys and novelties. Phosphorescent paint is typically used as body paint, on childrens' walls and outdoors.|$|R
30|$|In an ant colony, the {{communication}} between individuals, or between the {{individuals and the}} environment, {{is based on the}} pheromone produced by them. The trail pheromone is a specific type of pheromone that some ant species use <b>to</b> <b>mark</b> <b>paths</b> on the ground. When detecting pheromone trails, forage ants may follow the path trodden by other ants to the food source. The first ants when sniffing the pheromone tend to choose, probabilistically, the trails marked with stronger concentrations of pheromone. The second group of ants will notice more intense the shortest path due to the shorter evaporation time. With the continuation of this procedure by all the ants, at one point in this process, one of the paths stands out for being the most frequented, being indicated by the intensity of ants’ pheromone and density superior to the others. At this point, the best path found by the ants is defined. This behavior inspired the optimization method by ant colonies [11].|$|R

5000|$|The {{coat-of-arms}} is {{from modern}} times; they were granted on 24 May 1985. The blue and silver/white arms show two stone road signs (varder), which in historical times were used <b>to</b> <b>mark</b> the <b>paths</b> and tracks. Two {{of the largest}} of these signs {{are found in the}} municipality, and were mentioned in historical records in the early 17th century. According to legend, they were already built by King Olaf II of Norway (Hellige-Olav), in the 11th century.|$|R
50|$|In the park, one is {{not allowed}} <b>to</b> leave <b>marked</b> <b>paths,</b> make fire or sleep outside the Chamanna Cluozza; the {{mountain}} hut located in the park. It is also forbidden to disturb the animals or the plants, or to take home anything found in the park. Dogs are not allowed, not even on a leash. Due to these strict rules, the Swiss National Park is the only park in the Alps who has been categorized by the IUCN as a strict nature reserve, which is the highest protection level.|$|R
50|$|Warning signs urge {{visitors}} {{walking to}} the island to keep <b>to</b> the <b>marked</b> <b>path,</b> check tide times and weather carefully and to seek local advice if in doubt. For drivers, tide tables are prominently displayed {{at both ends of}} the causeway and also where the Holy Island road leaves the A1 Great North Road at Beal. The causeway is generally open from about three hours after high tide until two hours before the next high tide, but the period of closure may be extended during stormy weather. Tide tables giving the safe crossing periods are published by Northumberland County council.|$|R

40|$|MPACA) models the {{collective}} behaviour of ants to find clusters in data and to assign {{objects to the}} most appropriate class. It is an ant colony optimisation approach that uses pheromones <b>to</b> <b>mark</b> <b>paths</b> linking objects that are similar and potentially {{members of the same}} cluster or class. Its novelty is in the way it uses separate pheromones for each descriptive attribute of the object rather than a single pheromone representing the whole object. Ants that encounter other ants frequently enough can combine the attribute values they are detecting, which enables the MPACA to learn influential variable interactions. This paper applies the model to real-world data from two domains. One is logistics, focusing on resource allocation rather than the more traditional vehicle-routing problem. The other is mental-health risk assessment. The task for the MPACA in each domain was to predict class membership where the classes for the logistics domain were the levels of demand on haulage company resources and the mental-health classes were levels of suicide risk. Results on these noisy real-world data were promising, demonstrating the ability of the MPACA to find patterns in the data with accuracy comparable to more traditional linear regression models.

5000|$|The most {{important}} form of symbolic communication that the Indians employed were dendroglyphs. These symbols carved into trees and logs served as boundary markers between tribes, to thank local spirits {{in the wake}} of a successful hunt and to record one's whereabouts. Moravian missionaries in the mid-eighteenth century noted that the Lenape of Pennsylvania and New Jersey would carve animals and etchings onto trees when they camped, and were able to pinpoint the tribe, region or village of symbols that they encountered. Similarly, the Abenaki peoples of northern New England used etchings on trees <b>to</b> <b>mark</b> <b>paths</b> or drew beaver huts and ponds <b>to</b> <b>mark</b> their trapping areas. The Mi'kmaq pictographic tradition was later converted into a true writing system with adjustments by French missionaries. These symbols were also painted. In 1813, residents found a tree carved into the shape of a woman and a child around Lake Winnipesaukee. Evidence for dendroglyphic picture writing in southern New England is lacking, as most of the trees were felled by the Federal Period, with current forests consisting of secondary growth after farms were abandoned for land in the Great Plains in the end of the nineteenth century. [...] The markings may have been similar to the wiigwaasabak of Ashinaabe (Ojibwe) culture in scope and usage, able to record mnemonically songs related to ritual traditions, meetings between clans, maps and tribal identity.|$|R
50|$|One {{practical}} use for trail laying is <b>to</b> <b>mark</b> the <b>path</b> toward food. The ants will often find a food source {{requiring them to}} make multiple trips to the nest or shelter. In order {{to keep track of}} space, a scent is useful. Another significant use of a scent is to recruit other workers. This is actually helpful in a number of scenarios. It can increase efficiency when a food source is located and needs to be brought back to the nest. It can also be helpful in recruiting assistance during an attack on one of the acrobat ants' plant shelters.|$|R
5000|$|Carrying {{a map and}} compass, {{and knowing}} how to use them, will {{decrease}} the risk of getting lost. Likewise, a Global Positioning System may prove invaluable, as it can pinpoint a traveler's location, revealing his exact position and the direction to roads, services, and inhabited areas. Most GPS devices can also be designed <b>to</b> <b>mark</b> one's <b>path</b> on a map, {{making it easy to}} backtrack. Family Radio Service, General Mobile Radio Service, and amateur radios operating on the [...] "2 meters" [...] band may help maintain communication. Flashing lights, signal mirrors, and whistles are low-tech emergency signals.|$|R

Therefore, as I could see through the woods that the sun was getting low, and it was uncertain how far the lake might be, even if we were on the right course, and in what part of the world we should find ourselves at nightfall, I proposed that I should push through with what speed I could, leaving boughs <b>to</b> <b>mark</b> my <b>path,</b> and find the lake and the Indian, if possible, before night, and send the latter back to carry my companion's bag.|$|R
