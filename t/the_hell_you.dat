Noisey's Daisy Jones interpreted the words as a reference to Australian singer Sia's 2013 single [...] "Elastic Heart", {{who served as the}} executive producer of Daddy Issues. The song continues with the lyrics: [...] "Living for the days, living for the nights, living for the chance to give what's right, now tell me who <b>the</b> <b>hell</b> <b>you</b> think I am." [...] During the song's hook, Candy sings [...] "Why do all the good girls have to die/ Living in a bad girl's paradise"; Yasmeen Gharnit wrote that the section discusses how women must discard their innocence to achieve independence.

2500|$|The Wall Street Journal said, [...] "The WB's One Tree Hill, a slick prime-time {{drama about}} a small town packed with hunky {{teenagers}} and simmering family secrets, {{is one of the}} fastest-growing shows on network television." [...] The Star-Ledger commented, [...] "One Tree Hill is a welcome surprise... Every choice it makes from pacing to photography to music seems just about right, and the casting is inspired." [...] Alynda Wheat of Entertainment Weekly called the show a [...] "guilty pleasure" [...] and said they had not had one [...] "this guilty" [...] since Melrose Place. [...] "Their relationships change so quickly you'd need a spreadsheet to keep up," [...] she stated. [...] "As Brooke put it to Peyton, 'I think Nathan likes Tutor Girl, but I think Tutor Girl likes Lucas. And I know I like Lucas, and I don't know who <b>the</b> <b>hell</b> <b>you</b> like anymore. However, Wheat criticized the lack of parents in most of the teenage characters' lives. [...] "Any time order threatens to reign, the writers ship out the parents – to Italy, a boating accident, whatever," [...] said Wheat. Daniel Fienberg of zap2it.com said that, though the show has all the elements that make for a good show about teenagers/young adults, [...] "it's also a show that has stubbornly refused to be categorized merely as a guilty pleasure and its myriad artistic pretensions – Lucas's Bartlett's Familiar Quotations-spewing narration, Peyton's (Hilarie Burton) pedantic lectures on indie rock, countless expositional monologues lifted from a Philosophy 101 lecture—have often rendered it merely bad, rather than so-bad-its-good". Fienberg did, however, compliment the school shooting episode. Cynthia Boris of DVDVerdict.com, on the other hand, said, [...] "One Tree Hill doesn't claim to be anything more than it is. They acknowledge that they're a teen fantasy complete with an appropriately emo WB soundtrack." ...|$|E
