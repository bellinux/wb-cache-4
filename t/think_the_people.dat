500|$|Numerous hip hop {{fans and}} certain rappers mocked West for {{becoming}} [...] "sappy" [...] while others deemed the upcoming LP as a throwaway experimental album. Comparisons {{were drawn to}} Electric Circus, an album recorded by West's labelmate and close friend Common. MTV eventually interviewed Common to share his thoughts and views on the artistic direction of the album. Common expressed both his understanding and his support for West's intentions, stating [...] "I love it. I'mma tell you, as an artist, you wanna be free. I'mma do what I feel. You can't just cater to the audience. You gotta say, 'Hey, y'all, this is where I'm at.' For him to do an album called 808s and Heartbreak, you know that's where he is at this moment. I heard some songs, and I think it's fresh. I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> are ready for it." ...|$|E
500|$|While the Windows and Xbox 360 {{versions}} of The Orange Box were developed {{and published by}} Valve, {{the development of the}} PlayStation 3 port was outsourced to Electronic Arts. In an interview with Edge magazine before the game's release, Valve co-founder Gabe Newell commented, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> who have The Orange Box on the PS3 are going to be happy with their game experience. We've done the PC and 360 versions here and EA has a team doing the PS3 version– and they'll make the PS3 version a good product; EA got the job done in putting {{a lot of people with}} PS3 experience on the project. But I think it's harder to get it to the same standard as the 360 and PC versions". Despite this, he noted that Valve will probably handle PlayStation 3 {{versions of}} its products in the future.|$|E

In his dissenting conclusion, Hynek described Blue Book's conclusions as absurd: in their reports, several of the police had unknowingly described the moon, Venus and the UFO, though they unknowingly described Venus as a bright [...] "star" [...] very near the moon.

2500|$|The Hurricane Floyd {{disaster}} {{was followed}} by what many judged {{to be a very}} slow federal response. Fully three weeks after the storm hit, Jesse Jackson complained to FEMA Director James Lee Witt on his CNN program Both Sides Now, [...] "It seemed there was preparation for Hurricane Floyd, but then came Flood Floyd. Bridges are overwhelmed, levees are overwhelmed, whole towns under water ... an awesome scene of tragedy. So there's a great misery index in North Carolina." [...] Witt responded, [...] "We're starting to move the camper trailers in. It's been so wet it's been difficult to get things in there, but now it's going to be moving very quickly.

2500|$|In July 2009, Bernie Ecclestone faced {{calls from}} WJC President Ronald S.

He urged Formula One teams, drivers and host countries to suspend their cooperation with him. In reaction, Ecclestone told the news agency Associated Press that [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> who are saying that haven't got the power to say these things." [...] Asked if the WJC was influential, Ecclestone said: “It's a pity they didn't sort the banks out" [...] and “They have a lot of influence everywhere."

2500|$|While {{some conservatives}} like Emad Afrough {{support the idea}} of Civil society, some like Ayatollah Mesbah Yazdi are opposed to the idea of civil rights for citizens. Emad Afrough stated: [...] "If we do not {{actively}} seek cultural change, our national and ethnic cultures get destroyed. We must consciously choose to answer the questions confronting us. Today's question is civil society ... I believe we can easily reconstruct civil society here (in Iran) based on our own values and cultural characteristics. Civil society is a necessity, and the growing complexity of society requires it. Our historical past also supports it. In reality, in Iran, as in elsewhere in the Middle East, the only obstacle to civil society is the state." [...] Mesbah Yazdi, however, stated: [...] "It doesn’t matter what the people <b>think.</b> <b>The</b> <b>people</b> are ignorant sheep." ...|$|E

On February 27, 1974, Maryland's Governor Mandel {{pulled the plug on}} the idea. Orioles owner Jerold Hoffberger was blunt: [...] "I will bow to the will of the people. They have told us what they want to tell us. First, they don't want a new park and second, they don't want a club." [...] Robert Irsay was willing to wait. [...] "It's not a matter of saying {{that there will be no}} stadium. It's a matter of getting the facts together so everybody is happy when they build the stadium. I'm a patient man.

2500|$|On December 13, Matsuzaka and Boras joined Red Sox GM Theo Epstein, CEO Larry Lucchino, and Chairman Tom Werner on {{a private}} plane owned by Red Sox owner John Henry headed for Boston. During the flight—which was {{followed}} by both the Boston and the Japanese media—the group agreed to terms on a contract. Journalist Nobuhiro Chiba characterized Japanese reaction to the signing: [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> are relieved to send Daisuke to the Boston Red Sox." [...] In Boston, Matsuzaka passed his physical and signed a six-year, $52 million contract, {{which could have been}} worth as much as $60 million if he fulfilled incentives. The details of the contract included a $2 million signing bonus with a $6 million salary in 2007, $8 million in each of the following three seasons (2008–2010), and $10 million in each of the final two years (2011–2012). He also had a no-trade clause, specially constructed by the Red Sox to fit Matsuzaka's contract.|$|E

And actually... you can tell which are which. The people who are decent, responsible citizens pick up after themselves. The people who are just out there as activists trash the place and walk off and are proud of having trashed it, so let’s draw that distinction."

Her Aunt says that Ani’s mother has {{the gift of}} people-speaking, as do many monarchs; she also says that she herself has the gift of animal-speaking. Ani discovers she has the gift of animal-speaking, but her Aunt soon returns to the forest, and Ani's mother, the queen, keeps Ani from using her gift of animal-speaking, for she <b>thinks</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> will not trust her if she communicates with beasts.
