5|$|To {{eliminate}} this danger, if a USB hub detects {{a mix of}} {{high speed}} or full speed and low speed devices, it will by default disable communication <b>to</b> <b>low</b> speed device unless requested to switch <b>to</b> <b>low</b> speed mode. On reception of a PRE packet however, it will temporarily re-enable the output port to all low speed devices, to allow the host to send a single low speed packet <b>to</b> <b>low</b> speed devices. After the low speed packet is sent, an end of packet (EOP) signal will tell the hub to disable all outputs <b>to</b> <b>low</b> speed devices again.|$|E
