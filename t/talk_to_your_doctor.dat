30|$|In {{contrast}} to these challenges, {{many of the}} nursing students credited supportive nursing faculty members with assisting them through the process to receive approval for testing accommodations. Students mentioned teachers on several occasions as the impetus or the support structure. Taylor shared, “I had a teacher that I went to and spoke {{with him in his}} office and he kind of told me that I needed to look into it and so I went to my doctor…he wrote a note for the school for the student services, and when I had that, then they set up accommodations for my testing.” She added, “Many of the teachers have this big open-door policy for everyone.” Emerson also noted, “and I went <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> my professor and he was like, ‘are you sure you don’t have anxiety? Have you <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>your</b> <b>doctor</b> about it?’ And I was like, ‘Yea, I have,’ but, I was just really in denial’ (fanning herself with her hands). And he was like, ‘you really should look into it, I think it would help a lot.’” Students appear to appreciate the support offered by their faculty members and suggest that many students would not make the effort to secure testing accommodations without the encouragement of their teachers.|$|R
40|$|Before {{taking any}} {{medication}} {{it is very}} important to read the label. Medication labels contain important information to help you take your medications the right way and prevent medication interactions and other medication-related problems. If you do not read a medication label, you may make mistakes in taking medications and cause serious health problems. Labels for over-the-counter (OTC) medications have detailed information to assist in their proper use without the advice of a health care professional. However, over-thecounter medications are not without risks. The use of these medications is relatively safe only when the proper dosage is followed. Reading labels carefully before buying an OTC medication is important, especially if you have a special health problem or are on a special diet. Some examples include: ■ If you have high blood pressure or diabetes (high blood sugar), you should not take decongestants without <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>your</b> <b>doctor</b> or pharmacist. By reading the label, or asking your pharmacist, you can find out if an OTC cold medicine is safe for you. ■ If you have high blood pressure, or are on a low sodium or salt-free diet, you should avoid products containing sodium bicarbonate (a common antacid) or other forms of sodium. Labels provide ingredient information and ma...|$|R

50|$|There {{are many}} {{resources}} to help pregnant women quit smoking such as counseling and drug therapies.

However, {{it is important to note}} that the use of Nicotine Replacement Therapies (NRTs) is questionable for pregnant women as these treatments still deliver nicotine to the child. For some pregnant smokers, NRT might still be the most beneficial and helpful solution to quit smoking.
