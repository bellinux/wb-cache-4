40|$|Abstract—During {{manufacture}} of wire bonding in packaged IC products, {{the breaking of}} bond wires and the peeling of bond pads occur frequently. The result is open-circuit failure in IC products. There were several prior methods reported {{to overcome these problems}} by using additional process flows or special materials. In this paper, a layout method is proposed to improve the bond wire reliability in general CMOS processes. By changing the layout patterns of bond pads, the reliability of bond wires on bond pads can be improved. A set of different layout patterns of bond pads has been drawn and fabricated in a 0. 6 - m single-poly triple-metal CMOS process for investigation by the bond wire reliability tests, the ball shear test and the wire pull test. By im-plementing effective layout patterns on bond pads in packaged IC products, not only the bond wire reliability can be improved, but also the bond pad capacitance can be reduced for high frequency application. The proposed layout method for bond pad design is fully process-compatible to general CMOS processes.

50|$|When {{drilling}} a fastener, {{the choice}} of where to drill {{it depends on the}} type of fastener and to what it will be wired. The alternative to drilling holes in fasteners is to use safety <b>wire</b> <b>tabs</b> (see Safety <b>wire</b> <b>tabs</b> section below), or to purchase pre-drilled fasteners.|$|R
40|$|Devices {{that look}} and {{function}} much like conventional zippers on clothing {{have been proposed}} as connectors for flexible electronic circuits. Heretofore, flexible electronic circuits have commonly included rigid connectors like those of conventional rigid electronic circuits. The proposed zipper connectors would {{make it possible to}} connect and disconnect flexible circuits quickly and easily. Moreover, the flexibility of zipper connectors would make them more (relative to rigid connectors) compatible with flexible circuits, so that the advantages of flexible circuitry could be realized more fully. Like a conventional zipper, a zipper according to the proposal would include teeth anchored on flexible tapes, a slider with a loosely attached clasp, a box {{at one end of the}} rows of mating teeth, and stops at the opposite ends. The tapes would be made of a plastic or other dielectric material. On each of the two mating sides of the zipper, metal teeth would alternate with dielectric (plastic) teeth, there being two metal teeth for each plastic one. When the zipper was closed, each metal tooth from one side would be in mechanical and electrical contact with a designated metal tooth from the other side, and these mating metal teeth would be electrically insulated from the next pair of mating metal teeth by an intervening plastic tooth. The metal teeth would be soldered or crimped to copper <b>tabs.</b> <b>Wires</b> or other conductors connected to electronic circuits would be soldered or crimped to the ends of the tabs opposite the teeth...|$|R
5000|$|Cheater plugs were {{previously}} available {{with a short}} flexible grounding wire rather than a screw tab. This allows use of the second duplex outlet {{that does not have}} a faceplate screw in the correct location for the screw <b>tab.</b> The grounding <b>wire</b> would be wrapped around the adapter to reach the faceplate screw. However, this ground-wire style of cheater plug was discontinued when it was noted that a loose unattached grounding wire could by accident become inserted into the [...] "hot" [...] blade socket of a nearby outlet, potentially leading to electrocution.|$|R
40|$|Nanoparticles (NPs) {{can improve}} {{mechanical}} properties of construction elements. However, the integration is not trivial {{due to the}} nanoscopic nature of the particles and the different material properties of particle and device: new processing routes have to be found for homogeneous incorporation. Therefore, a wet chemical synthesis is established to incorporate various ceramic NPs such as TiO 2, TiC, SiC, and WC in copper films in desired concentrations. Depending on the kind and concentration of NPs, hardness and wear resistance of copper are enhanced. The resulting metal matrix composite films are thus of high interest for various applications such as reinforced electrical contacts and in aerospace and automotive technology. The energy released in an exothermic reaction of a reactive multilayer system (RMS) {{can be used as}} a precise and well-defined local heat source for joining the surface of polymers. In this case, a RMS consisting of alternating layers of nickel and aluminum is used. The design of the RMS is adjusted in a way that despite the intensive but very short reaction no damaging of the polymers occurs. The joining process takes only milliseconds and does not require any pre- or post-treatment of the polymers. With the optimal joining parameters, e. g., the joining load, for fiber non-reinforced polymers tensile strengths can be achieved, which lead to a material failure by tensile attempts. Preliminary tests of fiber reinforced polymers result in a tensile strength that is characteristic for adhesive polymer bonding. Model simulations show that only the first few micrometers of the materials surface are in a liquid state for a very short period of time. In addition to the applied joining load, the materials composition and specifically the resulting solidification process of the liquid polymer phase result in a strong bond between polymer samples that have to be joined. Materials with different thermal expansion coefficients are difficult to join thermally. Among them is the joining of solar cells. It is conventionally carried out by heating the whole assembly. Due to the thermal differences between <b>tabbing</b> <b>wire</b> and silicon, deformations as well as changes in the microstructure can occur. In the worst case, damage of the whole assembly is possible. Upon inspection of the joining process, the high energy consumption of the process itself is also critical...|$|R
50|$|Safety <b>wire</b> <b>tabs</b> are washers {{that are}} used to secure {{fasteners}} by transferring the force of the safety wire {{to the head of the}} fastener to be secured. They are installed just like any other washer, after which the sides of the tab are bent up to make contact with the sides of the head of the fastener. One side of the tab is longer than the other with a small hole at the top, through which safety wire is threaded. Once the Safety Wire is properly installed, the sides of the tab transfer the force of the safety wire to the fastener, as though the fastener itself had been drilled and had the safety wire run though it.|$|R
50|$|The {{advantage}} of safety <b>wire</b> <b>tabs</b> {{is that the}} fastener to be secured {{does not need to}} be drilled, which can be advantageous for fasteners that should not or cannot be drilled because of size or damage concerns. They can also be useful when a fastener needs to be replaced, the replacement is not already drilled, and circumstances do not afford the time or tools to properly prepare the replacement fastener. The disadvantages are that it adds extra distance between the head of the fastener and the surface to which it is to be secured, and it is not as secure as securing the wire directly to the fastener itself as the tab could be a point of failure if it somehow unbends or the hole breaks (which is more likely than the hole in a drilled fastener failing due to the thinness and malleability of the material from which it is made).|$|R
