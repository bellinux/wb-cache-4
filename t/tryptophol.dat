40|$|A new and {{efficient}} synthesis of α-functionalized α-indol- 3 -yl ketones from easily available indolyl α-acyloins is reported. This process, catalyzed by Brønsted or Lewis acids, involves an uncommon direct nucleophilic substitution reaction of a secondary α-carbonyl-substituted hydroxyl group. The described methodology allows {{the introduction of}} a variety of nucleophiles such as (hetero) arenes, thiophenols, nitroanilines and 1, 3 -dicarbonyl derivatives.

5000|$|The first toxic {{compound}} found in W. sebi was isolated and named walleminol A by Wood et al. in 1990 {{in their study}} on toxic metabolite of W. sebi.

[...] The toxin contains two hydroxyl groups, four methyl groups, {{and two or three}} ring structures in the molecule. [...] The molecular weight of this compound is 236. The toxicity level is comparable with mycotoxins like penicillic acid and citrinin. However, the toxic metabolite only applies in culture environment, the mycotoxin does not necessarily produce in food. A recent study on secondary metabolism of W. sebi found six compounds including walleminone, <b>tryptophol,</b> <b>tryptophol,</b> phenylacetic acid, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, and wallimidione.

40|$|<b>Tryptophol</b> (3 -indole ethanol) is a {{compound}} which induces sleep, and is formed: (a) {{in the liver}} after disulfiram treatment, and (b) by the parasite in trypanosomal sleeping sickness.

After intravenous administration, <b>tryptophol</b> distribution to tissues correlated with relative blood flow.
