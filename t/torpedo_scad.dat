25|$|The <b>torpedo</b> <b>scad,</b> Megalaspis cordyla (also {{known as}} the hardtail scad, finny scad, finletted {{mackerel}} scad and cordyla scad), is a species of moderately large marine fish classified in the jack and horse mackerel family, Carangidae. The <b>torpedo</b> <b>scad</b> is distributed throughout the tropical Indo-Pacific region, ranging from South Africa {{in the west to}} Tonga in the east, extending to Japan in the north and Australia in south. It is a schooling pelagic fish which occupies the surface layers of both inshore and offshore oceanic waters. The <b>torpedo</b> <b>scad</b> is easily identified by both its 'torpedo' shaped body and a series of detached finlets at the rear of both the dorsal and anal fins. The largest recorded individual was 80cm long and weighed 4 kg, although it is more common at lengths less than 40cm. It is a predatory species, taking a variety of fish, cephalopods and crustaceans by both active and filter feeding. There is a shift in diet as the species grow; however fish is the dominant prey in all size classes. <b>Torpedo</b> <b>scad</b> reach sexual maturity at 22cm in females and 26.4cm in males, with spawning occurring between March and July in India, where significant research into larval growth and morphometrics has been carried out.|$|E
25|$|The <b>torpedo</b> <b>scad</b> is {{of major}} {{importance}} to commercial fisheries {{in the central}} Indo-Pacific region (including India), and of moderate to minor importance elsewhere. Statistics recorded by the FAO do not include India, however even without this country the annual take of <b>torpedo</b> <b>scad</b> has increased from 70 000 t in 1997 to 107 000 t in 2007. On {{the basis of these}} statistics, the biggest utiliser of the species is Indonesia, with a take of 42 000 t followed by Malaysia with a take of 22 000 t. Thailand and the Philippines also take large quantities of the fish, with around 18 000 t each annually. Middle Eastern countries also record this species in their hauls, but at lower amounts of between 50 and 5000 t. In more southerly regions such as South Africa, it is a rare catch, usually appearing in beach seines. The species is taken by a variety of netting methods such as beach seines, trawls, purse seines and other types of trap including hook and line. It is usually marketed fresh, dried or salted. <b>Torpedo</b> <b>scad</b> are often caught by recreational fishermen throughout their range, however are not considered a target for gamefishing. They readily take small lures and are good sport on light tackle. <b>Torpedo</b> <b>scad</b> are said to have fair to good quality flesh, however are not very popular. Some chefs recommend frying or steaming the fish, although grilling is also acceptable.

50|$|The 2004 marine {{production}} in Thailand was composed of: pelagic fish 33 percent, demersal fish 18 percent, cephalopod 7.5 percent, crustaceans 4.5 percent, trash fish 30 percent and others 7 percent. Trash fish refers to non-edible species, edible species of low commercial value and juveniles, which are {{released to the}} sea. Pelagic fishes were distributed between anchovies (Stolephorus spp., 19 percent), Indo-Pacific mackerel (Rastrelliger brachysoma, 18 percent), sardinellas (Sardinellars spp., 14 percent), scad (11 percent), longtail tuna (Thunnus tonggol, 9 percent), eastern little tuna (Euthynnus affinis, 6 percent), trevallies (6 percent), bigeye scad (5 percent), Indian mackerel (Rastrelliger kanagurta, 4 percent), king mackerel (Scomberomorus cavalla, 3 percent), <b>torpedo</b> <b>scad</b> (Megalaspis cordyla , 2 percent), wolf herrings (1 percent), and others (2 percent). Demersal fish production was dominated by purple-spotted bigeye (Priacanthus tayenus), threadfin bream (Nemipterus hexodon), brushtooth lizardfish (Saurida undosquamis), slender lizardfish (Saurida elongata) and Jinga shrimp (Metapenaeus affinis). Most species are overfished since the 1970s-1990s, except for Spanish mackerel (Scomberomorus commersoni), carangidae and <b>torpedo</b> <b>scad</b> (Meggalaspis spp.). The overall overfishing rate was 333 percent for pelagic and 245 percent for demersal species in 1991. Cephalopods are divided into squid, cuttlefish and molluscs, where squid and cuttlefish in Thai waters consists of 10 families, 17 genera and over 30 species. The main mollusk species captured in the Andaman Sea are scallop, blood cockle (Anadara granosa) and short-necked clam. Their collection requires bottom dredge gears, which damage the sea floor and the gears themselves and are becoming unpopular. So, the mollusk production has decreased from 27,374 tonnes in 1999 to 318 tonnes in 2004. While crustaceans composed only 4.5 {{percent of the total}} marine products in 2004 by volume, they accounted for 21 percent of the total value. They were dominated by banana prawn, tiger prawn, king prawn, school prawn, bay lobster (Thenus orientalis), mantis shrimp, swimming crabs and mud crabs. The total catch in 2004 was 51,607 tonnes for squid and cuttlefish and 36,071 tonnes for crustaceans.|$|E

40|$|Background: Understanding {{different}} patterns of fish consumption {{is an important}} component for risk assessment of contaminants in fish. A few studies on food consumption had been conducted in Malaysia, but none of them focused specifically on fish consumption. The objectives of this study were to document the meal pattern among three major ethnics in Malaysia with respect to fish/seafood consumption, identify most frequently consumed fish and cooking method, and examine the influence of demographic factors on pattern of fish consumption among study subjects. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted between February 2008 and May 2009 to investigate patterns of fish consumption among Malaysian adults in Peninsular Malaysia. Adults aged 18 years and above were randomly selected and fish consumption data were collected using a 3 -day prospective food diary. Results: A total of 2, 675 subjects, comprising male (44. 2 %) and female (55. 7 %) participants from major ethnics (Malays, 76. 9 %; Chinese, 14. 7 %; Indians, 8. 3 %) {{with a mean age of}} 43. 4 ± 16. 2 years, were involved in this study. The results revealed 10 most frequently consumed marine fish in descending order: Indian mackerel, anchovy, yellowtail and yellow-stripe scads, tuna, sardines, <b>torpedo</b> <b>scad,</b> Indian and short-fin scads, pomfret, red snapper, and king mackerel. Prawn and squid were also among the most preferred seafood by study subjects. The most frequently consumed freshwater fish were freshwater catfish and snakehead. The most preferred cooking style by Malaysians was deep-fried fish, followed by fish cooked in thick and/or thin chili gravy, fish curry, and fish cooked with coconut milk mixed with other spices and flavorings. Overall, Malaysians consumed 168 g/day fish, with Malay ethnics’ (175 ± 143 g/day) consumption of fish significantly (p< 0. 001) higher compared with the other two ethnic groups (Chinese= 152 ± 133 g/day, Indians= 136 ± 141 g/day). Conclusion: Fish consumption was significantly associated with ethnicity, age, marital status, residential area, and years of education of adults in Peninsular Malaysia, and the data collected are beneficial for the purpose of health risk assessment on the intake of contaminants through fish/seafood consumption...|$|E
