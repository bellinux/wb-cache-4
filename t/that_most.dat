5|$|Blöndal & Benedikz (2007) note <b>that</b> <b>most</b> of the Greece runestones {{are from}} Uppland and relate {{it to the}} fact that it was the most common area to start a journey to Greece, and the area from which most Rus' originated. However, as noted by Jansson (1987), the fact <b>that</b> <b>most</b> of these runestones were raised in Uppland and Södermanland does not {{necessarily}} mean that their number reflects the composition of the Scandinavians in the Varangian Guard. These two provinces are those that have the greatest concentrations of runic inscriptions.|$|E
