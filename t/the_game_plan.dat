25|$|At the 1973 US Open, Evert {{started off}} hot {{by winning the}} first two games, but Court quickly stormed back to win the next five games, which allowed her to fend off Evert in a narrow win of the first set 57. Evert made many passing shots against Court in the second set, which was due to poor tactics by her {{opponent}} by coming into net, and this made Court’s error total go up allowing Evert to string together five straight games in a 62 set. Conversely, Court went back to <b>the</b> <b>game</b> <b>plan</b> she used to win the first set in the final and decisive third set. During the set Court won the first game and Evert took the next, which Court would win three {{games in a row}} breaking Evert’s serve in the four game and going out to a lead of 41, which during one game in the Court fell behind 1540, but would get lucky when Evert missed a smash and the next point was won by Court win an ace. The set and the finals appearance eventually went to Court, who defeated Evert 26 in the set.|$|E
25|$|In {{front of}} 14,623, {{far short of}} a sell-out, Mayweather won via TKO in the 10th round, surpassing Rocky Marciano and setting {{the record for the}} longest active unbeaten streak in a {{professional}} career at 50–0. In the opening round, Mayweather, as per previous fights, started slow to work out McGregor's tactics. In his post-fight interview, he revealed it was part of <b>the</b> <b>game</b> <b>plan</b> to let McGregor punch himself out in the early rounds. McGregor won the first round on all three judges scorecards, the same case could have been made for the opening three rounds. McGregor was warned a few times through the fight for hitting behind the head, but no points were deducted by referee Robert Byrd. By the fourth round, McGregor began to tire and breathe heavily with his mouth open. Mayweather started to take control and landed with his right hands. For the next few rounds, McGregor came out throwing shots in the opening 30 seconds, but immediately tired, giving Mayweather enough time to carry on landing clean shots and winning the rounds. By round 9, McGregor had almost nothing left. Although he didn't look hurt, he was very fatigued and his face started showing redness. Two of the judges scored the round 10–8 for Mayweather. In round 10, McGregor staggered across the ring and was in a bad way against the ropes as Mayweather landed some hard shots. With McGregor barely on his feet after a few unanswered punches, the referee waived the fight off. The time of stoppage was 1 minute and 5 seconds of round 10.|$|E

500|$|Gameplay was {{compared}} frequently to Blizzard's Diablo series. According to Sullivan, the comparison was inevitable as Diablo helped define the genre, and was emphasized {{by the lack}} of action RPGs at the time. While the core gameplay remained traditional, they attempted to innovate in other areas. Character creation was simplified to simply choosing a name and gender rather than character types being tied to classes or chosen proficiency. They also effectively removed tutorials so players could get straight into gameplay, using games like Neverwinter Nights as an example of tutorials impeding players during early stages. When creating the skill system, the team looked at earlier successful RPGs and considered how they could improve on them. They also wanted to avoid creating characters who had [...] "a little of everything" [...] while offering replayability. The result was the creation of the themed masteries, with the added element of skill acquisition not being tied to level progression, allowing for players to bank skill points for different purposes. This system was built to encourage player freedom and represent logical character progression rather than tying one character to one class. Spawn points for enemies were governed by a random generation system, of what monsters are spawned depending on both environment and player level. Loot was controlled by a database system which mixed and matched characteristics to produce [...] "over 100,000" [...] item combinations. Loot drops were also made to fit the types of creatures killed, in contrast to other games such as World of Warcraft which had animals dropping currency and weapons regardless. Loot types were also designed to be clearly visible on enemies so players could pick and choose which enemies to engage and which defeated enemy to loot. According to Bruno, the team were limited with the amount of impact and realism they could put into combat by the necessity of keeping the game within its prescribed ESRB age ratings of [...] "E for Everyone" [...] and [...] "T for Teens": this meant that blood was non-existent and hit reactions were minimal, negatively affecting player impressions of the game. Multiplayer was part of <b>the</b> <b>game</b> <b>plan</b> from its beginnings, with the main goal being to foster a community around the game. Bruno later faulted the lack of secure multiplayer as one of the major faults with the game: THQ apparently was unwilling to invest in this.|$|E
