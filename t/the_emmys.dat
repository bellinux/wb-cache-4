Laurie was not nominated for the 2006 Emmys, apparently to the outrage of Fox executives, but he still appeared in a scripted, pre-taped intro, where he parodied his House character by rapidly diagnosing host Conan O'Brien and then proceeded to grope him as the latter asked him for help to get to <b>the</b> <b>Emmys</b> on time.

500|$|Colbert {{is deeply}} self-centered and takes {{everything}} personally, a trait which {{is reflected in}} his discussion of the news and current events. According to the comedian, [...] "There's nothing too large that doesn't involve him. Every news story is really about him ... Everything he cares about is a news story because he cares about it." [...] This is expressed in his frequent attacks on and feuds with well-known figures such as The Decemberists, Sean Penn, Conan O'Brien, Rain, Barry Manilow, Tony Bennett, and Don Rickles (the latter three of whom beat out Colbert for Best Individual in a Variety or Music Program at <b>the</b> <b>Emmys).</b> The comedian equates these feuds with Bill O'Reilly's culture wars.|$|E

In January 2016, according to The Hollywood Reporter, the film and Gibney were reported to have been “snubbed” by Oscar voters and not included in the Best Documentary category of the 88th Academy Awards.|$|E

500|$|In 2006, the United States Department of State called Sesame Street [...] "the {{most widely}} viewed children's {{television}} {{show in the}} world".

The controversy, which surprised the Sesame Workshop, was short-lived and died down after Kofi Annan and Jerry Falwell praised the Workshop's efforts.
