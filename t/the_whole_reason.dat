500|$|The European leg of {{the tour}} seemed to garner mostly {{unfavorable}} reviews from the media, although there were positive reviews as well. Bowie was frustrated how the reviews in Europe changed from initially positive to negative, blaming the early start of the tour in some outdoor venues for the poor reception. He said, [...] "the biggest mistake that was made on that tour, was opening in the daylight. <b>The</b> <b>whole</b> <b>reason</b> for the entire damn show was lost." [...] He noted that reviews from indoor shows (where the set and lighting were more effective) were quite positive.|$|E
500|$|Discussing Simmons' {{actions in}} the episode, Henstridge noted that the {{previous}} episodes in the season had established the character's new position high in the S.H.I.E.L.D. hierarchy so that this episode could see her abuse that power, using her position to help her friends, including the now ex-S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Johnson, rather than the agency of its director. Henstridge said that [...] "this is <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>reason</b> that she [...] {{but it is a}} turning point for because in that moment she could've gone the other way" [...] and chose to protect her new position. Henstridge appreciated the episode exploring the relationship between Simmons and Johnson, feeling that there was [...] "so much bad blood" [...] between them after the events of the third season that could be explored. She compared this to a relationship between sisters.|$|E
500|$|Smith {{graduated}} from Hampshire College in Amherst, Massachusetts in 1991 {{with a degree}} in philosophy and political science. [...] "Went straight through in four years", he explained to Under the Radar in 2003. [...] "I guess it proved to myself that I could do something I really didn't want to for four years. Except I did like what I was studying. At the time it seemed like, 'This is your one and only chance {{to go to college and}} you had just better do it because some day you might wish that you did.' Plus, <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>reason</b> I applied in the first place was because of my girlfriend, and I had gotten accepted already even though we had broken up before the first day." [...] After he graduated, he [...] "worked in a bakery back in Portland with a bachelor's degree in philosophy and legal theory".|$|E
50|$|Although this {{assumption}} {{could be interpreted}} morally or ethically, in Promise Theory this is simply a pragmatic `engineering' principle, {{which leads to a}} more complete documentation of the intended roles of the actors or agents within <b>the</b> <b>whole.</b> <b>The</b> <b>reason</b> for this is that, when one is not allowed to make assumptions about others' behaviour, one is forced to document every promise more completely in order to make predictions; thus it leads to a more complete documentation which in turn points out the possible failure modes by which cooperative behaviour could fail.|$|R

2500|$|In this case, <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>reason</b> the DEA agents seized Place's luggage was so {{they could}} subject it to the dog sniff. The sniff, in turn, would violate Place's Fourth Amendment rights if it {{constituted}} a [...] "search." [...] A [...] "search" [...] is an unwarranted intrusion on a person's objectively reasonable expectation of privacy. But the sniff did not require opening the luggage; it did not expose {{things that are not}} contraband to public view. The sniff was thus far more limited than the typical search. Moreover, the sniff merely revealed {{the presence or absence of}} narcotics. Thus, it was sui generis, and did not constitute a [...] "search" [...] under the Fourth Amendment.|$|E

6000|$|I find that, {{classified}} altogether, {{there are}} seventeen reasons advanced in Scotland for taking whiskey.

But I remember that reason number seventeen is [...] "because it canna do ye any harm." [...] On <b>the</b> <b>whole,</b> <b>reason</b> seventeen is the best.|$|E
5000|$|Taking a wider view, the {{relative}} density of Roman {{military in the}} north (along the Wall and its hinterland) presents the thorny problem of whether the Carvetii and other northern tribes were simply uncivilsed and required a large army presence for internal security reasons; or, whether the army numbers were such as to deal with external enemies beyond the Wall. (Other possible reasons include the protection of mining industries, {{and to provide a}} reserve of troops that could be called upon elsewhere in the Empire). One historian believes that, on <b>the</b> <b>whole,</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> was to [...] "protect the province from attack" [...] (by outside forces, that is).|$|R

5000|$|Rennyo, {{the charismatic}} {{leader of the}} Hongan-ji branch of Jōdo Shinshū responded to this {{situation}} by clarifying the positive religious meaning of 'Ikkō' (single-minded) whilst simultaneously distancing himself from the antinomian behaviour of the original Ikkō sect. In his pastoral letters, known as Ofumi or Gobunsho, he therefore wrote; [...] "It has been established with certainty that our Founder did not particularly name our school the [...] "Ikkō-shū". On <b>the</b> <b>whole,</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> the people call us this is that we place our complete reliance, exclusively, on Amida Buddha ...'However, the Founder has specifically named this sect [...] "Jōdo Shinshū".

60|$|A {{resumption}} {{of this investigation}} was the outward and apparent hobby of Phillotson at present--his ostensible reason for going alone into fields where causeways, dykes, and tumuli abounded, or shutting himself up in his house with a few urns, tiles, and mosaics he had collected, instead of calling round upon his new neighbours, who for their part had showed themselves willing enough to be friendly with him. But it was not the real, or <b>the</b> <b>whole,</b> <b>reason,</b> after all. Thus on a particular evening in the month, when it had grown quite late--to near midnight, indeed--and the light of his lamp, shining from his window at a salient angle of the hill-top town over infinite miles of valley westward, announced as by words a place and person given over to study, he was not exactly studying.|$|E
60|$|But, after careful consideration, I most unwillingly {{come to the}} {{conclusion}} that I must decline. At the time in question I shall, please God, either have just finished, or be just finishing, my present book. Country rest and reflection will then be invaluable to me, before casting about for Christmas. I am a little shaken in my nervous system by the terrible and affecting incidents of the late railway accident, from which I bodily escaped. I am withdrawing myself from engagements of all kinds, in order that I may pursue my story with the comfortable sense of being perfectly free while it is a-doing, and when it is done. The consciousness of having made this engagement would, if I were to make it, render such sense incomplete, and so open the way to others. This is the real state of the case, and <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>reason</b> for my declining.|$|E
60|$|Why had I come here? To gain cattle as a trader? No, for I {{was not at}} {{all sure}} that I would take them if gained. Because Saduko had twitted me with faithlessness to my words? Yes, to a certain extent; but that was by no means <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>reason.</b> I had been moved by the recital of the cruel wrongs inflicted upon Saduko and his tribe by this Bangu, and {{therefore}} had not been loath to associate myself with his attempted vengeance upon a wicked murderer. Well, that was sound enough so far as it went; but now a new consideration suggested itself to me. Those wrongs had been worked many years ago; probably most of the men who had aided and abetted them by now were dead or very aged, and it was their sons upon whom the vengeance would be wreaked.|$|E

60|$|Let {{us first}} examine the antiquated theory, {{as it must}} now be called. By {{bringing}} a raptorial insect and a firefly together, {{we find that the}} flashing light of the latter does actually scare away the former, and is therefore, for the moment, a protection as effectual as the camp-fire the traveller lights in a district abounding with beasts of prey. Notwithstanding this fact, and assuming that we have here <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>reason</b> of the existence of the light-emitting power, a study of the firefly's habits compels us to believe that the insect would be just as well off without the power as with it. Probably it experiences some pleasure in emitting flashes of light during its evening pastimes, but this could scarcely be considered an advantage in its struggle for existence, and it certainly does not account for the possession of the faculty.|$|E

I can save France, and I stand ready to do it, but not under these present conditions. If they want me, let them send for me; otherwise, let them take the consequences; I shall not budge but as an officer." ...|$|E
60|$|Part of this prophecy or {{probability}} {{has already}} been accomplished; the rest of it, {{in the absence of}} any protest, is in process of accomplishment. It would be easy to give an almost endless catalogue of examples, to show how, in dealing with the poorer classes at least, coercion has already come near to a direct control of the relations of the sexes. But I am much more concerned in this chapter to point out that all these things have been adopted in principle, even where they have not been adopted in practice. It is much more vital to realise that the reformers have possessed themselves of a principle, which will cover all such things if it be granted, and which is not sufficiently comprehended to be contradicted. It is a principle whereby the deepest things of flesh and spirit must have the most direct relation with the dictatorship of the State. They must have it, by <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>reason</b> and rationale upon which the thing depends. It is a system that might be symbolised by the telephone from headquarters standing by a man's bed. He must have a relation to Government like his relation to God. That is, the more he goes into the inner chambers, and the more he closes the doors, the more he is alone with the law. The social machinery which makes such a State uniform and submissive will be worked outwards from the household as from a handle, or a single mechanical knob or button. In a horrible sense, loaded with fear and shame and every detail of dishonour, it will be true to say that charity begins at home.|$|E

5000|$|Graetzs history {{became very}} popular and {{influential}} in its time.
