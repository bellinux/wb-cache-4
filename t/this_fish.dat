5|$|Fish and {{shellfish}} {{have a natural}} tendency to concentrate mercury in their bodies, often {{in the form of}} methylmercury, a highly toxic organic compound of mercury. Species of fish that are high on the food chain, such as shark, swordfish, king mackerel, bluefin tuna, albacore tuna, and tilefish contain higher concentrations of mercury than others. As mercury and methylmercury are fat soluble, they primarily accumulate in the viscera, although they are also found throughout the muscle tissue. When <b>this</b> <b>fish</b> is consumed by a predator, the mercury level is accumulated. Since fish are less efficient at depurating than accumulating methylmercury, fish-tissue concentrations increase over time. Thus species that are high on the food chain amass body burdens of mercury that can be ten times higher than the species they consume. This process is called biomagnification. Mercury poisoning happened this way in Minamata, Japan, now called Minamata disease.|$|E
5|$|In the 18th and 19th centuries, tengu {{came to be}} feared as the {{vigilant}} protectors {{of certain}} forests. In the 1764 collection of strange stories , a tale tells {{of a man who}} wanders into a deep valley while gathering leaves, only to be faced with a sudden and ferocious hailstorm. A group of peasants later tell him {{that he was in the}} valley where the guhin live, and anyone who takes a single leaf from that place will surely die. In the , written in 1849, the author describes the customs of the wood-cutters of Mino Province, who used a sort of rice cake called kuhin-mochi to placate the tengu, who would otherwise perpetrate all sorts of mischief. In other provinces a special kind of fish called okoze was offered to the tengu by woodsmen and hunters, in exchange for a successful day's work. The people of Ishikawa Prefecture have until recently believed that the tengu loathe mackerel, and have used <b>this</b> <b>fish</b> as a charm against kidnappings and hauntings by the mischievous spirits.|$|E
5|$|Many {{factors are}} thought to be {{responsible}} for the dramatic decline of this species in Australia, including habitat fragmentation, erosion and sedimentation of soil, insecticides and fertilisers contaminating water systems, the introduction of predatory fish, and alteration of drainage regimes. Population declines are closely related to the introduction of the eastern mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki), a species native to North America that was introduced to control mosquito larvae. Laboratory studies have demonstrated the eggs and tadpoles of the green and golden bell frog are extremely susceptible to predation by <b>this</b> <b>fish,</b> and in 77 of the 93 sites in New South Wales where the green and golden bell frog was known to have disappeared before 1990, eastern mosquitofish were found to be present. The frogs have been known to inhabit waters containing the fish, but breeding is rarely successful there, pointing to the fish's voracious eating of eggs and tadpoles. The fish are not yet present in eastern Victoria, where green and golden bell frog numbers have remained solid, but the fish likely will spread to rivers there, possibly inflicting heavy losses on the frogs.|$|E

5|$|The Bhagavata Purana and the Kathasaritsagara continue, that on {{advice of}} Shiva, Rati assumes {{the form of}} Sambara's kitchen-maid Mayavati and awaits her husband's arrival in Sambara's house. Sambara is foretold that the reborn Kama would be his destroyer. Sambara finds out that Kama was born as Pradyumna, the son of Krishna and his wife Rukmini. He steals the child and throws him in the ocean, where the child is {{swallowed}} by a fish. <b>This</b> <b>fish</b> is caught by fishermen and sent to Sambara's kitchen. When the fish is cut, the child is found by Mayavati, who decides to nurture him. The divine sage Narada reveals to Mayavati that she was Rati and the child was Kama and she was to rear him. As the child grew up, the motherly love of Mayavati changes to the passionate love of a wife. The reborn Kama resents her advances, as he considers her his mother. Mayavati tells him the secret of their previous births as narrated by Narada {{and that he was}} not her son, but that of Krishna and Rukmini. Mayavati trains Pradyumna in magic and war and advises him to kill Sambara. Pradyumna defeats Sambara and slays him. He returns to Dvārakā, Krishna's capital with Mayavati as his wife, where they are welcomed.|$|E
25|$|<b>This</b> <b>fish</b> is {{not related}} to any of the {{families}} found in its range (Ariidae, Ictaluridae, or Heptapteridae). It is most similar to Ictaluridae, but lacks some important characteristics to classify <b>this</b> <b>fish</b> into this family or the other two families. Initial study has placed <b>this</b> <b>fish</b> above Diplomystidae, Cetopsidae, and Hypsidoridae, but further classification is unknown. This family probably represents a basal group in which intermediates have disappeared.|$|E

25|$|<b>This</b> <b>fish</b> {{has been}} {{successfully}} bred in captivity. Captive breeding presents an alternative to wild-caught fish.

25|$|Many large {{cichlids}} {{are popular}} game fish. The peacock bass (Cichla species) of South America {{is one of}} the most popular sportfish. It was introduced in many waters around the world. In Florida, <b>this</b> <b>fish</b> generates millions of hours of fishing and sportfishing revenue of more than US$8 million a year.

25|$|Coelacanths are {{opportunistic}} feeders, hunting cuttlefish, squid, snipe eels, small sharks, {{and other}} fish {{found in their}} deep reef and volcanic slope habitats. Coelacanths are also known to swim head down, backwards or belly up to locate their prey, presumably using their rostral glands. Scientists suspect one reason <b>this</b> <b>fish</b> has been so successful is that specimens are able to slow down their metabolisms at will, sinking into the less-inhabited depths and minimizing their nutritional requirements {{in a sort of}} hibernation mode.|$|E
25|$|They can {{be divided}} into flabby or robust body types. Flabby benthopelagic fishes are like bathopelagic fishes, they have a reduced body mass, and low {{metabolic}} rates, expending minimal energy as they lie and wait to ambush prey. An example of a flabby fish is the cusk-eel Acanthonus armatus, a predator with a huge head and a body that is 90% water. <b>This</b> <b>fish</b> has the largest ears (otoliths) and the smallest brain in relation to its body size of all known vertebrates.|$|E

25|$|Yellowstone {{cutthroat}} trout (Oncorhynchus clarki bouvieri) have suffered considerable declines since European settlement, but recently began flourishing in some areas. Especially in Yellowstone Lake itself, long-term records indicate an almost remarkable restoration of robust populations from only {{three decades ago}} when the numbers of <b>this</b> <b>fish</b> were depleted because of excessive harvest. Its current recovery, though a significant management achievement, does not begin to restore the species' historical abundance. Also, they declined because of invasive lake trout.

25|$|DNA testing {{revealed}} this specimen differed genetically {{from the}} Comorian population. Superficially, the Indonesian coelacanth, locally called raja laut (king of the sea), {{appears to be}} the same as those found in the Comoros, except the background coloration of the skin is brownish-gray rather than bluish. <b>This</b> <b>fish</b> was described in a 1999 issue of Comptes Rendus de l'Académie des sciences Paris by Pouyaud et al. It was given the scientific name Latimeria menadoensis. A recent molecular study estimated the divergence time between the two coelacanth species to be 40–30 mya.|$|E
25|$|It {{is found}} in {{abundant}} coral areas from sub-tidal reef flats to deeper lagoons and seaward reefs and has a depth of 40 meters. Unlike other cleaner wrasses, <b>this</b> <b>fish</b> spans larger areas to clean and is cleans more during the day when it is active. It feeds on crustacean ectoparasites such as gnathiidae and fish mucus and, both individually and in groups, it will also clean sharks and rays such as grey reef shark, whitetip reef shark; Labroides bicolor will also clean other. At night, it may sleep in a mucous cocoon.|$|E
