5|$|The niche image {{carved on}} the {{southwest}} wall, near the Linga shrine (see 6 on plan) is <b>the</b> <b>wedding</b> of Shiva and Parvati. This legend is called the Kalyanasundara in Hindu texts. Parvati is seen standing to Shiva's right, the customary place for a Hindu bride at <b>the</b> <b>wedding.</b> The carvings are substantially damaged, but the ruined remains of the sculpture has been significant to scholarly studies of Hindu literature. In many surviving versions of the Puranas, <b>the</b> <b>wedding</b> takes place in King Parvata's palace. However, in this Elephanta Cave panel, the narrative shows some earlier version. Here King Parvata standing behind Parvati gives away the bride to Shiva while Brahma is the priest in the grotto relief.

Shepherds read the mantras (the responsibility of the Brahmin in a normal wedding) and the bleating of sheep replaces the traditional wedding band. <b>The</b> <b>wedding</b> is sometimes described as a gandharva marriage. Due to the unceremonious nature of <b>the</b> <b>wedding,</b> she is sometimes considered as a rakh (concubine) of Khandoba.|$|E
