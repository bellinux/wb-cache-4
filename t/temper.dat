50|$|Differential <b>tempering</b> (also called graded <b>tempering,</b> {{selective}} <b>tempering</b> {{or local}} <b>tempering)</b> is the inverse of differential hardening, to ultimately produce similar results. Differential <b>tempering</b> begins by taking steel {{that has been}} uniformly quenched and hardened, and then heating it in localized areas to reduce the hardness. The process is often used in blacksmithing for <b>tempering</b> cutting instruments, softening the back, shaft, or spine, but simultaneously <b>tempering</b> the edge to a very high hardness. The process was very common in ancient Europe, for making tools, but soon was applied to knives and swords as well.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{effect of}} <b>tempering</b> on the {{microstructure}} and roomtemperature yield {{stress of the}} two creep-resistant steels, X 20 CrMoV 121 and P 91, was investigated. The samples were <b>tempered</b> for 17520 h at 650 °C and 8760 h at 750 °C. After <b>tempering,</b> the room-temperature yield stress was determined. In addition, the SEM (Scanning Electron Microscopy) imaging on the <b>tempered</b> samples was carried out. It {{was found that the}} effect of <b>tempering</b> at 750 °C on the microstructure and room-temperature yield stress was greater for both steels than the effect of <b>tempering</b> at 650 °C. Changes of yield stress for both steels were found to be mutually very similar; hence a general mathematical expression with specific parameters for both steels and <b>tempering</b> temperatures was deduced. For the samples <b>tempered</b> at 750 °C only, a fairly good correlation between the interparticle spacing, yield stress and creep rate was observed...|$|R

The <b>tempered</b> stable Lévy motion uses exponential <b>tempering</b> to cool these jumps.

This article provides finite difference and particle tracking methods for solving the <b>tempered</b> fractional diffusion equation with drift.

40|$|Martensitic and {{bainitic}} steels are {{two types}} of widely used steels with excellent mechanical behaviors in automatic industry. It’s universally acknowledged that as- quenched martensite possesses poor ductility and impact toughness, which should be <b>tempered</b> before putting into application. During <b>tempering,</b> as-quenched martensite changes from a hard and brittle microstructure to more ductile and softer microstructure, leading to improved mechanical properties for manufacturing. Bainitic microstructures is less sensitive to <b>tempering</b> in the improvement of mechanical properties, while the explicit <b>tempering</b> effects are still unknown. The primary goal of the current research is to study the effect of <b>tempering</b> on the microstructure and properties of martensitic and bainitic microstructures developed in the same low carbon steel with high content of silicon and manganese (0. 2 wt. %C- 2 wt. %Si- 3 wt. %Mn). Results show that for <b>tempered</b> martensite, the hardness, yield strength and tensile strength have a decreasing tendency with higher <b>tempering</b> temperatures. Through <b>tempering,</b> martensite became more ductile at the expense of strength. Based on the literatures, transitional carbide precipitation is expected to take place instead of cementite at early stage of <b>tempering</b> due to the retarding effect of high silicon content. Investigations also show that bainite is less sensitive to <b>tempering</b> compared to martensite. The yield strength and elongation firstly increase due to the TRIP effect of retained austenite and then decrease with higher <b>tempering</b> temperature. Hardness and tensile strength have a similar decreasing tendency as martensite during <b>tempering.</b> The fracture modes of <b>tempered</b> martensite for all temperatures show a typical ductile fracture, while for bainite, a morphology of quasi-cleavage fracture is observed...|$|R
40|$|High {{strength}} low-alloyed (HSLA) Cr-Mn-Si steels {{belong to}} a group of steels that can reach their full mechanical properties after quenching and <b>tempering.</b> Those properties depend both on the temperature and time of <b>tempering.</b> Knowing the <b>tempering</b> parameters, it is possible to reach the desired properties of the treated steel. Some results on investigating the Hollomon-Jaffe equation (in parametric form) application for <b>tempering</b> of HSLA steel, are shown in this paper.

40|$|Simulated and {{parallel}} <b>tempering</b> are families of Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithms where a temperature parameter is varied during the simulation to overcome bottlenecks to convergence due to multimodality. In this work we introduce {{and analyze the}} convergence {{for a set of}} new <b>tempering</b> distributions which we call entropy dampening. For asymmetric exponential distributions and the mean field Ising model with and external field simulated <b>tempering</b> is known to converge slowly. We show that <b>tempering</b> with entropy dampening distributions mixes in polynomial time for these models. Examining slow mixing times of <b>tempering</b> more closely, we show that for the mean-field 3 -state ferromagnetic Potts model, <b>tempering</b> converges slowly regardless of the temperature schedule chosen. On the other hand, <b>tempering</b> with entropy dampening distributions converges in polynomial time to stationarity. Finally we show that the slow mixing can be very expensive practically. In particular, the mixing time of simulated <b>tempering</b> is an exponential factor longer than the mixing time at the fixed temperature. Comment: 35 pages, 1 figur...|$|R
