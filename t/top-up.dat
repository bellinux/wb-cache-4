5|$|One {{major issue}} is the West Lothian question, in which MPs from Scotland and Wales are able to vote on {{legislation}} affecting only England, while English MPs have no equivalent right to legislate on devolved matters. This when placed {{in the context of}} England being the only country of the United Kingdom not to have free cancer treatment, prescriptions, residential care for the elderly and free <b>top-up</b> university fees, has led to a steady rise in English nationalism. Some have suggested the creation of a devolved English parliament, while others have proposed simply limiting voting on legislation which only affects England to English MPs.|$|E

40|$|Postoperative {{epidural}} analgesia often needs rate readjustment using <b>top-ups.</b> Patient-controlled {{epidural analgesia}} (PCEA) {{is said to}} reduce the requirement of epidural <b>top-ups</b> when compared to continuous epidural analgesia (CEA). We compared CEA and PCEA in major thoracic and abdominal surgery, in a cohort study. The primary endpoint was the required number of epidural <b>top-ups.</b> Secondary endpoints were pain scores, side effects and workload differences. We analysed 199 patients with CEA and 187 with PCEA. Both groups had similar pain scores. The total number of <b>top-ups</b> was 75 in 57 patients (CEA) versus 20 <b>top-ups</b> in 18 patients (PCEA). (p = 0. 0001) Sedation tended to occur more frequently in patients with CEA versus PCEA, 5. 5 % vs 1. 6 % (p = 0. 05). Implementation of PCEA led to a decreased number of <b>top-ups,</b> fewer side-effects and decreased use of the postoperative care uni...|$|R
30|$|Nonexportability of noncontributory {{benefits}} (pension <b>top-ups)</b> {{is quite}} likely {{the most contentious}} issue in all four corridors.

25|$|The {{amount of}} oxygen is more {{difficult}} to calculate, as it is derived from two sources, the added oxygen and the air <b>top-up.</b> However, all of the nitrogen is provided by the air <b>top-up,</b> so the partial pressure of the nitrogen is calculated in a similar way as for helium, which allows the pressure of the air to be calculated, assuming nitrogen to be 79% of the air. In the Tx 20/40 example, the fraction of nitrogen is 100% - (20% + 40%) = 40%. The required partial pressure of nitrogen is therefore 230bar x 40% = 92bar, so the air <b>top-up</b> pressure is 92bar/79% = 116bar (for a 3,000psi fill this would be 3,000 x 40% / 79% = 1,500psi of air). The remaining pressure of 230bar - 92bar - 116bar = 22bar is the added oxygen pressure required for the mix (for a 3,000psi fill this would be 3,000 - 1,200 - 1,500 = 300psi of oxygen).|$|E

40|$|Pain during {{labor and}} {{delivery}} is often very unpleasant and stressful for the parturients. Patient controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA) {{has been found}} to be both safe and effective, providing optimal pain relief and allowing women to participate in their own analgesia). Compared to other epidural techniques, intermittent epidural <b>top-ups</b> and continu- ous epidural analgesia (CEA), PCEA uses diluted local anesthetic solutions with less motor block and less unscheduled clinician interventions. The purpose of our study was to compare intermittent bolus epidural <b>top-ups</b> and PCEA in labor. Sixty ASA I patients who requested epidural analgesia for labor and had written consent were included in the study. 30 patients in the first group received intermittent bolus epidural <b>top-ups,</b> while patients in the second group received PCEA. We evaluated duration of labor, maternal sense of pain using VAS scale and maternal satisfaction during fetal descent in both groups. We found that the duration of labor was significantly shorter and maternal sense of pain was lower in the PCEA group than in the group receiving epidural bolus <b>top-ups.</b> There were no differences between groups in maternal satisfaction during fetal descent...|$|R

Two approaches were applied: in an ex post analysis we address how accession have so far influenced structural changes income situation and production structure. Secondly, in an ex-ante analysis we apply the agent-based model AgriPoliS to simulate the impacts of decoupling <b>top-ups</b> on structural change and farm income. In the ex post analysis it has been observed that production decisions are strongly influenced by <b>top-ups.</b> Furthermore, the model shows that accession slows down structural change while decoupling of <b>top-ups</b> in 2009 will not lead to significant changes in farm restructuring nor income situation.

50|$|The rate {{increase}} {{was accompanied by}} an offset package to help Singaporeans {{with the increase in}} GST. The package would cost the government $4 billion over five years. The government argued that the offset package would help the majority of Singaporeans offset their increased GST costs for several years. The offset package consisted of direct transfer benefits, in the form of cash payouts (GST credits, growth dividends, senior citizens' bonuses), CPF <b>top-ups</b> (post-secondary education account <b>top-ups</b> for students, Medisave <b>top-ups</b> for older Singaporeans), and rebates (on utilities and public housing service & conservancy charges). Those who earned less or lived in smaller homes received more benefits. The government also argued that the Workfare Income Supplement, a wage subsidy, would provide significant support for lower-income workers on a continuing basis even after the GST offsets have been distributed.|$|R
