25|$|The 2014 season {{started off}} in great style as Parramatta won 4 {{out of their}} first 6 matches. Parramatta then went into their Easter Monday clash at Stadium Australia sitting 5th on the ladder but lost the match {{controversially}} 21-18 in front of 50,000 fans. In round 24 Parramatta were sitting 8th on the ladder and looked destined {{to play in the}} finals {{for the first time since}} 2009 and only needed to win one of their last two remaining games against sides lower than <b>them</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> which were Canberra and Newcastle. Parramatta lost both matches and missed out on the finals series by two competition points.|$|E
25|$|All guests retire for bed except Lord Charles and Sir George. Mr. Carlile {{is sent to}} get {{the plans}} for the fighter from the safe, so he set off for the study, colliding with Mrs. Vanderlyn who wants to {{retrieve}} her handbag. The two men walk along the terrace, when Lord Charles is startled by a figure leaving the study by the French window, although Sir George sees nothing. When they enter the study, Mr. Carlile has the papers out but Lord Charles quickly sees that the plans of the fighter itself are gone. Carlile is adamant that they were in the safe and he put <b>them</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table.</b> He was distracted when he heard a woman's scream in the hallway and ran out to find Leonie, Mrs. Vanderlyn's maid, who claimed that she had seen a ghost. Carlile had not otherwise left the study. Sir George suggests calling in Hercule Poirot immediately.|$|E
2500|$|After {{committing}} the crimes, on Sajal's directions, his friends cleaned their weapons with mustard oil and neatly organised <b>them</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table.</b> Exhausted with the exertion, they ate a few Bengali sweets from the refrigerator, {{and left a}} few coins on the table as [...] "payment" [...] for the food, an idea that had occurred to Sajal from watching a television programme.|$|E

2500|$|The crucifix, {{painting}} of the Crucifixion and the glass orb are not mentioned by Ripa, and Vermeer changed some of the iconography that Ripa gave: Instead of Ripa's suggestion that Faith hold the chalice and rest her hand on a book, Vermeer put <b>them</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> next to her. According to Arthur Wheelock, a University of Maryland academic and curator of a Vermeer exhibit at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, this is [...] "an assemblage that gives the image a Eucharistic character {{not found in the}} text." [...] By putting the golden chalice against the dark background of the painting's frame and the dark crucifix against the gilt-leather backdrop, the elements are given a greater prominence in the painting. Wheelock, citing his fellow academic at the University of Maryland, Quint Gregory, believes the slight overlapping of the chalice and the gold backdrop of the crucifix [...] "may symbolically suggest the essential role of the Eucharist in bridging the physical and spiritual realms", a very Catholic idea. Selena Cant calls the fact that the book, chalice and crucifix together represent the Catholic Mass.|$|E
60|$|Pacifico {{brought the}} writing materials, and laid <b>them</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table.</b>|$|E

6000|$|... "Will you {{not accept}} of {{something}} to aid you in your pilgrimage?" [...] said the Lady of Avenel, putting into her hands two crowns of the sun. The old woman flung <b>them</b> down <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table.</b>|$|R

60|$|Martin Harris was willing, {{and led the}} {{way into}} the cabin. Battery and light were stored away in a couple of soap boxes, and the boys brought them out and set <b>them</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> cabin <b>table.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, sir,' the man replied, in a hesitating tone; 'as I {{took the}} letters {{out of the}} box and laid <b>them</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> hall <b>table,</b> <b>the</b> {{envelope}} was back upwards, and I could not help seeing what was on it.' ...|$|R

60|$|The monk bowed, and {{producing}} several folios of manuscript, laid <b>them</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> {{together with an}} ink-horn and a pen.|$|E
60|$|With that, Sir Arthur {{drew from}} his pocket a large ram's horn, with a copper cover, {{containing}} a considerable quantity of coins, chiefly silver, but with a few gold pieces intermixed. The Antiquary's eyes glistened as he eagerly spread <b>them</b> out <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table.</b>|$|R
60|$|He spread <b>them</b> out <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> {{with hands}} that trembled he knew not why. Among {{them was the}} back number of the Times {{for which he had}} written to London, with a letter from the {{publisher}} explaining the means by which the copy had been procured.|$|R

40|$|Filariasis {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} tropical diseases in the world. As in Japan elephantiasis, chyluria and hydrocele patients are still found in some areas. Many studies have been made in attempt to obtain information <b>on</b> <b>the</b> mechanism of filarial immunity and to find better antigens to be used for serologic tests and skin tests. The author has been making studies of this subject with aid of his co-workers and the results have been published in Japanese. Present paper attempts to summarize briefly some of their recent experiences concerning skin reaction for filariasis and its practical application, illustrating <b>them</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tables</b> and figures. FPT抗原を用いた糸状虫症の皮内反応については著者及協力者の名で,既に日本論語文としてその都度発表した. 本編ではその重要な知見を総括的に紹介した. 犬糸状虫から分離したペプタイド分画を抗原として仔虫陽性者 541 名,未感染の非流行地住民集団 264 名,他の寄生虫性疾患 134 名に皮内反応を実施すると同時にその一部について補体結合反応との関係を追究した. 又流行地で仔虫陰性の反応強陽性者を長期に亘り経過を観察した. その結果本抗原による皮内反応は糸状虫感染,寄生に対して特異的で,類属反応や非特異的陽性反応の山現する率はきわめて低いことを知った. この皮内反応を沖縄及内地の流行地の集団約 18, 000 名に実施し,その結果を分析すると在来行われてきた単なる仔虫検索や臨床的観察だけでは知ることのできなかったバンクロフト糸状虫症の真の広がりや流行伝搬の性格など動的疫学相を把握することができる. ことに中学校集団から得られた成績はその地域を代表するもので,流行のこまかい地域的差異を知るのに便利である. 従って全国的規模による糸状虫対策を行うにあたって,対策の対象となる濃厚流行地をさがし出す予備調査の手段としても有効である. 又本皮内反応の長所は昼間に,しかも学校集団では一括して実施出来ることである...|$|R
