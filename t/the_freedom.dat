50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Freedoms</b> {{were active}} in the trade market at the WTT Roster Player Draft on April 1, 2008. In the first round, they {{protected}} local favorite Lisa Raymond, which left Jamea Jackson unprotected. Since Jackson had substituted for Raymond in 2007, {{she had to be}} protected in the first round (Raymond's 2007 position), if <b>the</b> <b>Freedoms</b> intended to keep her. Raymond, on the other hand, could have been protected in the fourth round, if <b>the</b> <b>Freedoms</b> had protected Jackson in the first round. In the second round, <b>the</b> <b>Freedoms</b> protected Travis Parrott, who had substituted for Daniel Nestor in 2007. Parrott was still technically a WTT rookie under the rules in place at the time, even though he played for Sacramento Capitals in 2006, and for <b>the</b> <b>Freedoms</b> in 2007. <b>The</b> <b>Freedoms</b> traded their third round pick to the Delaware Smash for Alex Bogomolov Jr., whom had been selected by the Smash with the seventh pick in the first round. The trade forced <b>the</b> <b>Freedoms</b> to leave 2006 WTT Male Most Valuable Player Nestor and Frédéric Niemeyer unprotected. The Smash used the third round selection it acquired from <b>the</b> <b>Freedoms</b> to draft Madison Brengle. In the fourth round, <b>the</b> <b>Freedoms</b> selected Audra Cohen and left Olga Savchuk unprotected. <b>The</b> <b>Freedoms</b> did not select any roster-exempt players.|$|R

5|$|In 2009, a {{jury found}} for Heffernan and awarded him damages {{from the police}} {{officials}} and the city. Despite the verdict, Heffernan sought a retrial because Judge Peter G. Sheridan had not allowed him to pursue <b>the</b> <b>freedom</b> of speech claim; the defense did so as well because Judge Sheridan had allowed <b>the</b> <b>freedom</b> of association claim. While considering these motions, Judge Sheridan became aware of {{a conflict of interest}} through a former law firm and set aside the verdict, setting a new date for trial before Judge Dennis M. Cavanaugh.|$|E

5|$|On June 2, 2010, Harris {{signed with}} the Washington Freedom {{following}} the dissolution of Saint Louis Athletica. After signing with <b>the</b> <b>Freedom,</b> Harris stated that her contributions to the team would not be through starting and playing, as Erin McLeod was the starting goalkeeper for the team at the time. On July 24, McLeod suffered an ACL tear during a match against FC Gold Pride. Brianna Scurry, the back-up for <b>the</b> <b>Freedom,</b> had suffered a concussion {{earlier in the year}} and was also out for the season. Harris was left as the starting goalkeeper and made her first appearance for the team on July 28, 2010, where she started in a match against Atlanta Beat. She appeared in the seven remaining games of the regular season and earned <b>the</b> <b>Freedom</b> a spot in the playoffs. <b>The</b> <b>Freedom</b> took on the Philadelphia Independence {{in the first round of}} the playoffs on September 19. Harris made three saves in regular time and the match was scoreless after 90 minutes. In the 120th minute, Amy Rodriguez scored for Philadelphia, resulting in a 1–0 victory and the Freedom's elimination from the playoffs.|$|E
50|$|The {{following}} evening, <b>the</b> <b>Freedoms</b> met <b>the</b> Washington Kastles {{at home in}} {{an atmosphere}} {{quite different from the}} teams' previous encounter. Just eight days earlier, <b>the</b> <b>Freedoms</b> prevailed in a matchup of WTT's only two undefeated teams. Now <b>the</b> <b>Freedoms</b> were 5-4, and the Kastles were 4-5 and facing elimination. The five-time defending WTT champions won the first three sets to gain a 15-9 lead before exacting their revenge for the home loss they suffered at the hands of <b>the</b> <b>Freedoms.</b> <b>The</b> 24-18 Kastles victory gave both teams 5 wins and 5 losses and put them both on the brink of elimination.|$|R
50|$|At the WTT draft on March 16, 2015, <b>the</b> <b>Freedoms</b> {{passed on}} making any {{selections}} in the marquee {{portion of the}} draft. In the roster portion of <b>the</b> draft, <b>the</b> <b>Freedoms</b> protected Taylor Townsend and 2014 WTT Male Most Valuable Player Marcelo Melo. They left Victoria Duval and Liezel Huber unprotected {{in the second round}} and instead chose Robby Ginepri. <b>The</b> <b>Freedoms</b> could not protect Frank Dancevic in the fourth round, because they already had two full-time male players. Huber was still available, and <b>the</b> <b>Freedoms</b> selected her to complete their roster.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Freedoms</b> {{followed}} their three-match winning streak with two straight losses. Yet, with 4 wins and 8 losses and two matches remaining, <b>the</b> <b>Freedoms</b> controlled their own playoff destiny. The Lobsters were {{in second place}} in the Eastern Conference with 4 wins and 7 losses, and <b>the</b> <b>Freedoms</b> had a home-and-home series scheduled with them to close the season. Following the home-and-home, the Lobsters were scheduled to close their season on the road against the Kastles. Therefore, if <b>the</b> <b>Freedoms</b> could sweep <b>the</b> home-and-home series, they would clinch a playoff berth.|$|R

50|$|Returning {{home with}} a chance to clinch a playoff berth in their final regular-season match, <b>the</b> <b>Freedoms</b> got off to a quick start when Ginepri won the opening set of men's singles, 5-0. But the Lobsters charged back, winning the next three sets to take a 15-12 lead to the final set. Melo and Townsend {{controlled}} the early portion of the fifth set of mixed doubles with two breaks of serve on two opportunities, and it looked as though <b>the</b> <b>Freedoms</b> might win <b>the</b> match outright with a lopsided final set win. But the Lobsters broke back late, and <b>the</b> <b>Freedoms</b> won <b>the</b> set by a score of 5-3 to cut the Lobsters' lead in the match to 18-17 and set up extended play. Melo served the first game of extended play, and <b>the</b> <b>Freedoms</b> quickly fell behind in the game, 3-1. <b>The</b> <b>Freedoms</b> successfully defended <b>the</b> first two break points, but the Lobsters ultimately broke at 3 all to win the match, 19-17. <b>The</b> <b>Freedoms</b> would {{have to wait for the}} result of the Lobsters' final match to learn their fate.|$|R
5|$|The First Amendment {{prohibits the}} making of any law {{respecting}} an establishment of religion, impeding {{the free exercise of}} religion, abridging <b>the</b> <b>freedom</b> of speech, infringing on <b>the</b> <b>freedom</b> of the press, interfering with the right to peaceably assemble or prohibiting the petitioning for a governmental redress of grievances.

5|$|At the trial, Archibald Macdonald, {{representing}} the prosecution, argued that Paine's work served only to inflame the populace and distribute radical ideas to those without {{the experience to}} understand them in context.

Despite Erskine's speech later receiving a rapturous response, Paine was found guilty before Macdonald replied.
