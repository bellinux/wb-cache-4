40|$|The {{additional}} tax ("penalties") imposable {{in terms of}} section 76 (1) of the Income Tax Act (No 58 of 1962) when a <b>taxpayer</b> is <b>in</b> <b>default,</b> can be very harsh (up to 200 % of the tax properly chargeable). The Commissioner may, in terms of section 76 (2) (a), remit any penalty imposed, as he sees fit. However, when there was intent {{on the part of}} the taxpayer to evade the payment of tax, the Commissioner may not remit any portion of the 200 % penalty imposable, unless he is of the opinion that "extenuating circumstances" exist. This dissertation examines the meaning of "extenuating circumstances", as interpreted by the judiciary, and lists the factors and defences that a taxpayer may plead to justify a remission of penalties, both in the case of an intention by the taxpayer to evade tax and in cases where the <b>taxpayer</b> is merely <b>in</b> <b>default</b> of section 76 (1).

50|$|There are {{criticisms of}} Sperling & Tucker's {{economic}} and financial arguments. At the time this book was published, the student loan default rate for University of Phoenix students was at or below the average for state 4-year institutions. This parity eliminated loan default costs as {{a significant factor in}} the analysis. (Although the model included default rates by institution.) Today, the default rate for-profit institutions is above the average for public and non-profit institutions, leading critics to argue that the difference in the level of taxpayer support required under the three models is not so large and perhaps does not exist. Considerable disagreement centers on this point. Some of the disagreement rests on which {{economic and financial}} variables to consider <b>in</b> the <b>taxpayer</b> cost equation; some disagreement rests on uncertainties and disputes surrounding true <b>taxpayer</b> costs <b>in</b> loan <b>defaults.</b>|$|R
