5|$|In 1649, {{the town}} is witness to many witch burnings. In the church, the townspeople <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> out whom to condemn next. People begin accusing others and soon they erupt into chaos, until Marge intervenes. She tries to talk sense into the townspeople, but Moe accuses her of being a witch. Quimby assures her that she is {{entitled}} to due process which means she will be thrown off a cliff with a broomstick; {{if she is a}} witch she will be able to fly to safety, in which case the authorities expect her to report back for punishment. If she is not a witch, then she will fall to an honorable Christian death. After being shoved off the cliff, Marge flies up on the broomstick revealing that she really is a witch and vows to conquer the whole entire town. She returns to her sisters Patty and Selma. The sisters watch Ned and Maude Flanders talking about how the witches eat children, which gives them the notion to do just that. They knock on the Flanders' door and demand their sons, but before they leave, Maude offers the witches gingerbread men instead. The witches like these better than the children so they go to each house, getting goodies in exchange for not eating the children. As they fly off, the Sea Captain says that is how the tradition of Halloween and trick-or-treating started.|$|E

25|$|The central concept {{around which}} this play is built is {{the dilemma of}} what to do with Harry and Edna. Their {{situation}} is the focal point for all the characters, including Harry and Edna themselves. Albee uses this dilemma to cause emotions to rise. As his characters <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> out what to do about the Harry and Edna, they have a series of discussions or debates that slowly rise in emotional temperature. Each character has his or her definition of what the dilemma is, as well as a means for resolving it. The tension in the play rises with the rise of emotions as the characters move toward a climax or a moment of truth. This moment is played out most specifically by Tobias and Harry in the conversation that defines their friendship: one that is built on rights and responsibilities rather than love and affection. In the end, Harry and Edna decide to go back home, thus solving, or at least releasing some of the tension of the dilemma.|$|E

Bannon, by constructing fictional biographies for her lesbian characters, produced a new knowledge about how one arrives at a lesbian identity." ...|$|E

500|$|The God of War comic series {{received}} mixed reviews.

Romanek hoped the audience of Never Let Me Go would be reminded of what is important: love, behaviour, and friendships. He recalled an email a person had written to him: [...] "I saw your film {{and it made me}} cry and I haven't reacted to a film emotionally like that in years.

500|$|When writing lyrics for {{previous}} releases, Moore would [...] "start mumbling and I <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> {{out what}} I'm saying {{and then try}} to make it make sense". With Blood, he [...] "really wrote them down and tried to make them coherent. I didn't want it to be like 'Oh, you get your own impression of the lyrics. Everybody has their own idea!' I wanted to have an idea that I wanted to communicate, and something communicable." [...] Moore noted that he did occasionally use his [...] "mumbling" [...] method as it [...] "puts you in the right direction as far as sounds, vowel sounds, and stresses on certain syllables. And if you can write some words and lyrics that match that, sometimes it flows really well." [...] He described all the songs as based on [...] "personal experiences". [...] "I'll start writing a song that has {{a little bit of a}} world view or political view or something," [...] he said, [...] "but then by the time I'm finished the lyrics it'll be about a relationship or something like that." ...|$|E
500|$|According {{to music}} {{journalist}} Jon Pareles, Songs of Innocence features U2 strictly playing rock music, particularly arena rock, whose elaborate production [...] "puts a higher gloss, {{and sometimes a}} heavier fuzz tone, on the band's instantly recognizable sound". Thematically, Songs of Innocence revisits the group members' youth in Ireland in the 1970s, touching on childhood memories, loves, and losses, while paying tribute to their musical inspirations. Bono described it as [...] "the most personal album we've written". In an interview with Gus Wenner of Rolling Stone, he said, [...] "Let's <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> out why {{we wanted to be}} in a band, the relationships around the band, our friendships, our lovers, our family. The whole album is first journeys—first journeys geographically, spiritually, sexually." [...] He said that he felt challenged to write about more personal themes and why he wanted to be in a rock band after producer Jimmy Iovine told him, [...] "The person you need to be to make the album that you wanna make {{is a long way from}} where you live." [...] Rolling Stone deemed Songs of Innocence as having the feeling of a concept album, a notion that Bono rejected, although he did opine it was lyrically cohesive in a way the group's other records were not. For the album, the group revisited adolescent musical influences, such as punk rock band Ramones and electronic music group Kraftwerk, for inspiration.|$|E
