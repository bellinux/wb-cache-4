5|$|Biathlon {{combines}} {{cross-country skiing}} and rifle shooting. Depending on the shooting performance, extra distance or time {{is added to}} the contestant's total running distance/time. For each shooting round, the biathlete must hit five targets; <b>the</b> <b>skier</b> receives a penalty for each missed target, which varies according to the competition rules.|$|E
5|$|Prior {{to a new}} hotel {{opening on}} Amity Island, an {{enormous}} great white shark ambushes and kills two divers who are photographing {{the wreck of the}} Orca. A couple of days later, their camera is recovered, and the shark goes after a female water skier and speedboat driver, killing <b>the</b> <b>skier,</b> while the driver fends off the shark using a gas tank and flare gun, causing the boat to explode, which kills her and severely burns the shark's face.|$|E
5|$|Cross-country skiing has {{two basic}} {{propulsion}} techniques, which apply to different surfaces: classic (undisturbed snow and tracked snow) and skate skiing (firm, smooth snow surfaces). The classic technique {{relies on a}} wax or texture on the ski bottom under the foot for traction on the snow to allow <b>the</b> <b>skier</b> to slide the other ski forward in virgin or tracked snow. With the skate skiing technique a skier slides on alternating skis on a firm snow surface at an angle {{from each other in}} a manner similar to ice skating. Both techniques employ poles with baskets that allow the arms to participate in the propulsion. Specialized equipment is adapted to each technique and each type of terrain. A variety of turns are used, when descending.|$|E
500|$|When <b>the</b> <b>skier's</b> {{weight is}} {{distributed}} on both skis, the ski's [...] diminishes {{the pressure of}} the grip zone on the snow and promotes bearing on the remaining area of the ski—the [...] "glide zone". A test for stiffness of camber is made with a piece of paper under <b>the</b> <b>skier's</b> foot, standing on skis on a flat, hard surface—the paper should be pinned throughout the grip zone of the ski on which all <b>the</b> <b>skier's</b> weight is placed, but slide freely when <b>the</b> <b>skier's</b> weight is bearing equally on both skis.|$|R

50|$|The {{company was}} at a height of 2,600m (8,500 ft) when the {{avalanche}} struck at 13:50, while 5-6 of <b>the</b> <b>skiers</b> neared Col de Le Petit Argentier. A large slab of ice, about 100 meters wide, broke off a ridge causing a mass avalanche. Several branches of snow about 400 meters wide, engulfed 13 of <b>the</b> <b>skiers</b> in a steep sector of the valley. In all, 18 of <b>the</b> <b>skiers</b> downstream were either buried or shaken. The rest of the company remained {{at the foot of}} the slope, near the Pas du Roc peak.|$|R
5|$|Slalom was {{originally}} released in 1986 in the arcades {{as part of}} the Nintendo VS. System and was titled Vs. Slalom. This release featured an upright cabinet, a joystick, one jump button, monaural sound, and standard raster graphics. There was also an optional controller upgrade that featured two physical ski poles and shortened skis that the player could stand on and use to control <b>the</b> <b>skier</b> onscreen. The NES version was released by Nintendo in North America in March1987 and in Europe on October15, 1987. Slalom was Rare's first video game developed as a new company. It was also the Stamper brothers' first video game console release.|$|E
25|$|In {{learning}} to ski, {{one of the}} first skills learned is getting {{into and out of the}} ski, and how to position the body in the ski in order to maintain balance. <b>The</b> <b>skier</b> then learns how to fall and to get up. <b>The</b> <b>skier</b> then works with the instructor on {{learning to}} ski on flat terrain, with the purpose of this exercise being to learn how to use the outriggers. <b>The</b> <b>skier</b> next learns how to get into and out of a chairlift. After this, <b>the</b> <b>skier</b> learns how to make basic turns, edging, medium radius turns and advance skiing techniques.|$|E
25|$|One of the para-Alpine skiing {{techniques}} used by this class {{is called the}} three track method, and was developed {{as part of the}} American Training System. One of the first skills learned using this technique is how to walk with the ski so <b>the</b> <b>skier</b> can learn how to flex the ankle, knee and hip. This allows <b>the</b> <b>skier</b> to determine their centre of gravity. <b>The</b> <b>skier</b> is then taught how hop turn in order to understand arm and leg coordination while on skis. This technique is only used while stationary and is not a competition skill. <b>The</b> <b>skier</b> next learns how to fall down and get back up again. The next skill learned is climbing gentle terrain, followed by learning to go down a straight run and learning to stop. After this, <b>the</b> <b>skier</b> learns how to get on and off a ski lift. This is followed by learning how to traverse the fall line, which teaches <b>the</b> <b>skier</b> how to maintain the ski edge. Other skills are then taught including the Uphill Christie, beginning turns, parallel turns, short swings and moguls.|$|E
5000|$|Popular {{from the}} start, {{the ski area}} opened in late 1957. It was {{originally}} known as Cliffs Ridge, as it operated on land leased from the Cleveland-Cliffs Iron Company of Cleveland, Ohio. The first chairlift, a Riblet double, was installed on <b>the</b> <b>skier's</b> right side of Rocket Run {{in the fall of}} 1972. Previously, there were 2 T-bars (the original Constam on <b>the</b> <b>skier's</b> left of Rocket and a newer Hall Ski-Lift on <b>the</b> <b>skier's</b> left of Snowfield) and several rope tows. The ski area was renamed [...] "Marquette Mountain" [...] in 1982.|$|R
40|$|High {{precision}} Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) {{measurements are}} becoming more and more popular in alpine skiing due to the relatively undemanding setup and excellent performance. However, GNSS provides only single-point measurements that are defined with the antenna placed typically behind <b>the</b> <b>skier’s</b> neck. A key issue is how to estimate other more relevant parameters of <b>the</b> <b>skier’s</b> body, like <b>the</b> center of mass (COM) and ski trajectories. Previously, these parameters were estimated by modeling <b>the</b> <b>skier’s</b> body with an inverted-pendulum model that oversimplified <b>the</b> <b>skier’s</b> body. In this study, we propose two machine learning methods that overcome this shortcoming and estimate COM and skis trajectories based on a more faithful approximation of <b>the</b> <b>skier’s</b> body with nine degrees-of-freedom. The first method utilizes a well-established approach of artificial neural networks, while the second method is based on a state-of-the-art statistical generalization method. Both methods were evaluated using the reference measurements obtained on a typical giant slalom course and compared with the inverted-pendulum method. Our results outperform the results of commonly used inverted-pendulum methods and demonstrate the applicability of machine learning techniques in biomechanical measurements of alpine skiing...|$|R
50|$|Barefoot skiing {{requires}} a higher speed because <b>the</b> <b>skier's</b> feet {{are smaller than}} skis, providing less lift. A rule of thumb for barefoot water skiing speed in miles per hour is (M/10)+18=S, where M equals <b>the</b> <b>skier's</b> weight in pounds. In other words, a 175 lb person would have to divide 175/10, which is 17.5; then simply add 17.5+18 which equals 35.5 mph.|$|R
25|$|Skiers use {{outriggers}} {{for balance}} and as leverage when they fall to right themselves. Outriggers {{are also used}} for turning, with <b>the</b> <b>skier</b> using the outrigger and their upper body by leaning into the direction they want to turn. In para-Nordic skiing, outriggers or ski poles are used top propel <b>the</b> <b>skier</b> forward. If a skier falls, they may require assistance in righting themselves {{to get back to}} the fall line. Doing this on their own, <b>the</b> <b>skier</b> needs to position their mono-ski facing uphill relative to the fall line.|$|E
25|$|For skiers {{with visual}} {{impairment}}s, guides {{are used to}} assist <b>the</b> <b>skier</b> down the course. Guides are skiers {{who do not have}} a vision impairment who assist a skier down the slopes by telling <b>the</b> <b>skier</b> where to go using their voice or a radio. Skiers can use more than one guide {{in the course of a}} competition, but the guide is only eligible for a medal if they have competed with the same skier for the duration of the discipline event. Like <b>the</b> <b>skier,</b> the guide is required to have an IPCAS Licence in order to participate in a competition and adhere to anti-doping rules.|$|E
25|$|In para-alpine and para-Nordic skiing, {{guides for}} B2 and B3 skiers often {{position}} themselves differently as the skiers have some vision, {{which means the}} things a guide assists with will be different from what is required of a skier who has almost no sight. The guide may ski in front of <b>the</b> <b>skier</b> and use visual cues to inform <b>the</b> <b>skier</b> of what is ahead {{of them on the}} course.|$|E
5000|$|Optionally lighter type of compass is {{attached}} to the map holder or to <b>the</b> <b>skier's</b> arm.|$|R
50|$|Longer poles {{are used}} for cross country because of {{different}} techniques. Pole length for classic (aka diagonal-stride) technique is typically measured from the ground to <b>the</b> <b>skier's</b> armpit. For skating (aka freestyle) technique {{the length of the}} pole is typically from the ground to <b>the</b> <b>skier's</b> upper lip. These length selections balance between maximum thrust and technique considerations. Most Nordic ski pole manufacturers have sizing charts available.|$|R
50|$|The {{race was}} a mass start event {{where all of}} <b>the</b> <b>skiers</b> start at <b>the</b> same time.|$|R
25|$|In para-Alpine skiing, <b>the</b> <b>skier</b> uses a mono-ski, while para-Nordic skiers use a two ski sit-ski. Skiers in {{this class}} use outriggers, and are {{required}} to wear special helmets for some para-Alpine disciplines. In learning to ski, {{one of the first}} skills learned is getting {{into and out of the}} ski, and how to position the body in the ski in order to maintain balance. <b>The</b> <b>skier</b> then learns how to fall and to get up.|$|E
25|$|Across {{both types}} of skiing, LW9 {{competitors}} use skis that would be slightly longer than if they were able-bodied. If they are using outriggers, these are fitted to <b>the</b> <b>skier</b> based {{the height of the}} skier's hip joint when <b>the</b> <b>skier</b> is standing. While learning to ski, skiers in this class with cerebral palsy may use ski-bras, bungi cords, outriggers, slant boards or toe boards. In the Biathlon, athletes with amputations can use a rifle support while shooting.|$|E
25|$|In this classification, skiers with {{cerebral}} palsy have difficulty walking in ski boots and sometimes require assistance when walking in them. When going up hill, they often have their weaker side on the uphill side. In learning to ski, a ski bra {{is often used to}} teach the proper technique. Skiers sometimes have difficulty with the snowplough technique. In teaching skiers with {{cerebral palsy}}, instructors are encouraged to delay the introduction ski poles as skiers may overgrip them. Use of a ski bra is also encourage as it helps <b>the</b> <b>skier</b> learn correct knee and hip placement. Some skiers {{with cerebral palsy}} have better balance while using skis than they would otherwise. This presents challenges for coaches who are working with <b>the</b> <b>skier.</b> Compared to other skiers in the class, <b>the</b> <b>skier</b> with cerebral palsy may tie more quickly.|$|E

25|$|In {{teaching}} skiers with cerebral palsy, {{instructors are}} encouraged to delay the introduction ski poles as skiers may overgrip them. Use of a ski bra is also encouraged as it helps <b>the</b> <b>skier</b> learn correct knee and hip placement. One method of learning to ski for competitors with cerebral palsy in this classification is the American Teaching System. They first thing skiers learn is what their equipment is, and {{how to put it}} on and take it off. Next, skiers learn about positioning their body in a standing position on flat terrain. After this, <b>the</b> <b>skier</b> learns how to side step, and then how to fall down and get back up again. <b>The</b> <b>skier</b> then learns how to do a straight run, and then is taught how to get on and off the chair lift. This is followed by learning wedge turns and weight transfers, wedge turns, wide track parallel turns, how to use ski poles, and advanced parallel turns.|$|E
25|$|When being {{assessed}} {{into this}} classification, {{a number of}} things are considered including reviewing the skiers medical history and medical information on the skier's disability, having a physical and an in person assessment of <b>the</b> <b>skier</b> training or competing.|$|E
25|$|One {{method of}} {{learning}} to ski for LW3 competitors with cerebral palsy is the American Teaching System.

50|$|Around 1850 {{artisans}} in Telemark, Norway {{invent the}} cambered ski. This ski arches {{up in the}} middle, under the binding, which distributes <b>the</b> <b>skier's</b> weight more evenly across {{the length of the}} ski. Earlier plank-style skis had to be thick enough not to bow downward and sink in the snow under <b>the</b> <b>skier’s</b> weight. Norheim's ski was also the first with a sidecut that narrowed the ski underfoot while the tip and tail remained wider. This enabled the ski to flex and turn more easily.|$|R
25|$|Outriggers {{are used}} to stop using a {{technique}} that involves bringing the skiers elbows from their raised position down to their hips while pushing the outriggers down. When using the outrigger, skiers do not rotate their arms as this changes {{the location of the}} ski on the snow. Skiers with below the knee amputations get on and off the ski lift using the same technique as able-bodied skiers. Cerebral palsy skiers in this class may have better balance while using skis than they would otherwise. This presents challenges for coaches who are working with <b>the</b> <b>skier.</b> Compared to other skiers in the class, <b>the</b> <b>skier</b> with cerebral palsy may tire more quickly.|$|E
25|$|In para-Alpine, skiers in this {{classification}} {{compete with}} one skis and two ski poles. The para-Alpine ski configuration {{is sometimes called}} a 3 track. FIS rules for para-Alpine ski boots and binding heights are modified for this class from rules applied to able bodied competitor's equipment. In para-Nordic, skiers compete with two skis and two poles. Skiers use skis that would be slightly longer than if they were able bodied. Skiers in this classification may use outriggers. Outriggers are forearm crutches with a miniature ski on a rocker at the base, and are fitted for <b>the</b> <b>skier</b> based {{the height of the}} skier's hip joint when <b>the</b> <b>skier</b> is standing.
