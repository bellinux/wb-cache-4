30|$|Recently, fallouts of salt-rich {{materials}} from the volcanic plume were observed during a high activity of the Nakadake crater, including during ash eruptions. We collected a few different types of <b>the</b> salt <b>fallouts</b> and report their occurrence, textural features and chemical compositions. The composition of the ash leachates and crater lake waters was also analyzed to compare with those of <b>the</b> salt <b>fallouts.</b> <b>The</b> origin of <b>the</b> salt <b>fallouts</b> precipitated {{during a period of}} crater lake absence is discussed, to understand the magmatic–hydrothermal interaction beneath the crater floor.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to run field data, without modification, for a number of case studies in different numerical models to find the best non-calibrated approach. The purpose of the comparison is to identify which frequently used approach gives the best agreement with <b>the</b> observed <b>fallouts</b> with respect to location, depth, shape, and extent. All of the five case studies are situated in hard rock masses that are massive or sparsely fractured, at depths of 630 - 965 m below surface. <b>The</b> observed <b>fallouts</b> are compared with the results from numerical models in Examine 2 D and Phase 2 D. None of the studied approaches give perfect agreement with <b>the</b> actual <b>fallouts.</b> This study demonstrates that when rock mass strength parameters are defined by either the Hoek-Brown or the Mohr-Coulomb criterion, the elastic and elastic-perfectly plastic models reasonably well predict actual <b>fallout</b> depth, although <b>the</b> extent of <b>fallout</b> is exaggerated and the shape incorrect. Therefore, a precise estimation can not be expected. When using the m= 0 approach, the results were in poor agreement with <b>the</b> observed <b>fallout.</b> <b>The</b> <b>fallouts</b> are significantly overestimated when applying the brittle-plastic models using instantaneous softening by cohesion and friction or cohesion weakening.

5|$|Upon release, Fallout Shelter {{received}} mostly positive reviews. Critics {{enjoyed the}} game's extension of <b>the</b> <b>Fallout</b> universe, the core gameplay, and its visual style. Common criticisms included the game's lack of depth, {{its use of}} unnecessary microtransactions, and its lack of an ending. The game grossed $5.1 million in microtransaction sales {{in the first two}} weeks after its release.|$|E
5|$|Black Isle's Torn was a {{role-playing}} {{video game}} developed for Windows by Black Isle Studios, announced on March 22, 2001 and cancelled in July of that year. The game {{was to use}} {{a modified version of}} the SPECIAL role-playing system, which had been implemented in <b>the</b> <b>Fallout</b> series. Developed on various editions of the Lithtech engine, Torn possessed features unseen in previous Black Isle Studios games, such as 3D graphics and real-time camera movement.|$|E
5|$|Bo Xilai's {{political}} fortunes came to {{an abrupt}} end when his police chief, Wang Lijun, fled to the American consulate in Chengdu hoping to gain political asylum. Wang reportedly provided the consulate with information on Bo's alleged misconduct, including his role obstructing investigations into the homicide of British citizen and Bo family associate Neil Heywood. In <b>the</b> <b>fallout,</b> Bo was removed as Chongqing party chief in March 2012 and suspended from the politburo in April 2012.|$|E
30|$|Emission of {{water-soluble}} salts from volcanoes is not rare. Volcanic ashes commonly contain water-soluble salts (ash leachates) with variable contents (Witham et al. 2005). Water-soluble salts, such as NaCl and KCl, {{are often}} found in the high-temperature fumarolic sublimates (Symonds 1993; Africano et al. 2002). However, the observation of <b>the</b> salt <b>fallouts</b> from a plume is an uncommon phenomenon, particularly from an ash plume. This study is the first report of such a case, {{as far as the}} authors know. Compositions of <b>the</b> salt <b>fallouts,</b> with <b>the</b> exception of white salt, are similar to the dried lake water samples, indicating <b>the</b> salt <b>fallouts</b> formation caused by the evaporation of the lake water. <b>The</b> salt <b>fallouts</b> have large Mg/Na ratios (close to one), similar to the ratios observed from the dried lake water samples, but different from the ash leachates. Although there are no samples of the fumarolic sublimates at Aso volcano, such sublimates rarely contain Mg-containing salts (Symonds 1993; Africano et al. 2002). The Mg-rich composition of <b>the</b> salt <b>fallouts</b> is different from the Mg-poor fumarolic sublimates.|$|R

On December 11, Ellis was traded to the New York Yankees of the American League (AL) along with pitcher Ken Brett and top infield {{prospect}} Willie Randolph, in exchange for pitcher Doc Medich. Tired of Ellis' behavior, Pittsburgh general manager Joe L. Brown insisted that the Yankees take Ellis as part of the deal.|$|E
5|$|Fallout Shelter is a free-to-play {{simulation}} {{video game}} developed by Bethesda Game Studios, with assistance by Behaviour Interactive, {{and published by}} Bethesda Softworks. Part of <b>the</b> <b>Fallout</b> series, it was released worldwide for iOS devices in June 2015, for Android devices in August 2015, for Microsoft Windows in July 2016, and Xbox One in February 2017. The game tasks the player with building and managing their own Vault, a fallout shelter.|$|E
5|$|First Great Western {{declined}} a {{contractual option}} {{to continue the}} Greater Western passenger franchise beyond 2013, citing a desire for a longer-term contract due to the impending upgrade to the Great Western Main Line. The franchise was put out to tender, but the process was halted and later scrapped due to <b>the</b> <b>fallout</b> from {{the collapse of the}} InterCity West Coast franchise competition. A two-year franchise extension until September 2015 was agreed in October 2013, and subsequently extended until March 2019.|$|E

5|$|In 2004, Bethesda Softworks {{purchased}} the license {{to develop and}} publish Fallout 3, {{as well as an}} option to create two sequels, from Interplay Entertainment. Three years later they bought <b>the</b> <b>Fallout</b> intellectual property. Bethesda abandoned the original gameplay style of previous Fallout titles; instead of an isometric game with action point/turn-based combat, Bethesda's Fallout 3 was a fully 3D game with real-time combat as well as the action point-based V.A.T.S. system.|$|E

5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>fallout,</b> Bo {{was removed}} {{as the party}} chief of Chongqing and lost his seat on the Politburo. Bo's {{dismissal}} exposed disunity within Communist Party ranks shortly before a major leadership transition, and some observers suspected {{that it was because}} he threatened Xi Jinping's future grip on power. He was later stripped of all his positions, lost his seat at the National People's Congress, and was eventually expelled from the party.|$|E

After four months, they married in February 1887. Once he moved in with Goldman's family, however, their relationship faltered. On their wedding night she discovered that he was impotent; they became emotionally and physically distant. Before long he became jealous and suspicious. She, meanwhile, was becoming more engaged with the political turmoil around her—particularly <b>the</b> <b>fallout</b> of the 1886 Haymarket affair in Chicago and the anti-authoritarian political philosophy of anarchism.|$|E
5|$|Beyond the {{negative}} impact on Bertuzzi's individual play, the media speculated that <b>the</b> <b>fallout</b> from the Moore incident had become a distraction to the organization as a whole. Compounding the situation in Vancouver, the Canucks had missed {{the playoffs for the}} first time in four years. As such, general manager Dave Nonis spent the off-season making significant changes to the Canucks lineup. On June 23, 2006, he traded Bertuzzi to the Florida Panthers, along with goaltender Alex Auld and defenceman Bryan Allen, in exchange for goaltender Roberto Luongo, defenceman Lukáš Krajíček and a sixth-round selection in the 2006 NHL Entry Draft (Sergei Shirokov). After seven-and-a-half seasons with the Canucks, Bertuzzi left the club ranked seventh all-time among franchise scoring leaders with 449 points.|$|E
