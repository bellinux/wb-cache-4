25|$|In 1768 John Golborne {{advised the}} {{narrowing}} {{of the river}} and the increasing of the scour by the construction of rubble jetties and the dredging of sandbanks and shoals. A particular problem was the division of the river into two shallow channels by the Dumbuck shoal near Dumbarton. After James Watt's report on this in 1769, a jetty was constructed at Longhaugh Point to block off the southern channel. This being insufficient, a <b>training</b> <b>wall</b> called the Lang Dyke was built in 1773 on the Dumbuck shoal to stop water flowing over into the southern channel. In the late 18th and early 19th centuries hundreds of jetties were built out from the banks between Dumbuck and the Broomielaw quay in Glasgow itself. In some cases this resulted in an immediate deepening as the constrained water flow washed away the river bottom; in others, dredging was required.|$|E
5000|$|The Savannah River {{north of}} Elba Island was {{particularly}} wide, and the Army Corps of Engineers built a <b>training</b> <b>wall</b> {{to narrow the}} channel {{to prevent it from}} filling up with silt. The Corps also filled the area behind the <b>training</b> <b>wall</b> with dredging spoilage. Both South Carolina and Georgia claimed the land that was created behind the <b>training</b> <b>wall,</b> even though it was on the South Carolina side of the river. This new land was called [...] "Denwill and Horseshoe Shoal".|$|E

50|$|<b>Training</b> <b>walls</b> {{are built}} to {{constrain}} a river or creek as it discharges across a sandy coastline. The walls stabilise and deepen the channel which benefits navigation, flood management, river erosion and water quality, but can cause coastal erosion by interrupting longshore drift. One solution is a sand bypassing system to pump sand under/around the <b>training</b> <b>walls.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The river has a bar at its {{confluence}} {{with the}} Tasman Sea. Work {{on the river}} <b>training</b> <b>walls</b> was concentrated in 1907, following extensive siltation of the river opening. The dredge Antleon was based there during the 1920s, when in 1924, the steamer Benandra was wrecked at the entrance. Work on the break walls was completed in 1925 when huge storms required some repairs to the <b>training</b> <b>walls.</b> The port gained greater significance in 1924 when a stone quarry was opened and used to supply granite for the pylons of the Sydney Harbour Bridge, and the stone for the Cenotaph in Martin Place. The Public Works Department built a wharf adjacent to the quarry fore ease of use. Extensions to the southern <b>training</b> <b>walls</b> were undertaken between 1931 and 1933, with major additional works from 1946-1954. [...] The bar is dangerous to shipping {{and as a result}} of its hazards for smaller ships and because it prevented access by larger ones, the major settlement in the area was first developed at nearby Broulee. In 1841 a flood cleared the bar and the town of Moruya, now accessible to shipping, developed at the expense of the settlement at Broulee despite later recurring problems with the bar, not least as it was the easist point to access the rich Araluen goldfields from the 1850s.|$|R
50|$|Building the 22 mi of slag <b>training</b> <b>walls</b> in the Tees {{was started}} in 1859.Blocks of solid blast furnace slag were cast and moved into {{position}} {{along the banks of}} the River Tees, then back filled using 70,000 tons of material dredged from river bed.This canalised the river allowing it to keep itself clean by the action of flow and tides.|$|R

The {{depth of water}} over the Whakatāne River entrance has been a limiting factor {{to the development of}} better port facilities, but it is generally held that a <b>training</b> <b>wall</b> along {{the western edge of the}} entrance would allow greater depths and safer crossings.|$|E
50|$|A 33 million upgrade of {{facilities}} was completed between 2009 and 2012, and involved {{the construction of}} a parapet wall on top of the dam wall crest and raising the spillway <b>training</b> <b>walls.</b> The addition of the parapet wall increased the crest height to 114 m. Storage capacity and water releases from the dam were not altered by the upgrade.|$|R
5000|$|The {{management}} of the River Boyne estuary channel by the Drogheda Harbour Commissioners (1790-1997) and their commercial successor Drogheda Port Company, since 1997, has been {{a feature of the}} last 150 years, with major dredging work beginning in the 1830s following the Alexander Nimmo report of 1826. This report was based on a survey of the estuary undertaken by John Benjamin Macneill. A recent EPA report states that [...] "From Drogheda town to the sea at Mornington the river has been trained by means of <b>training</b> <b>walls</b> constructed around the 1850s by the then Drogheda Harbour Commissioners. This captured the main river flow with estuarine polders being created north and south of the <b>training</b> <b>walls.</b> This important work had two effects in that it increased the tidal exit velocity and thereby produced a scouring effect and created a reserve of water from the estuarine polders to supplement the falling tide.As part of this engineering the old bridge at Mornington previously had a lock gate which restricted tidal water entering the Colpe stream.|$|R

50|$|Moriarty {{was made}} {{responsible}} for the Clarence River Entrance Works between 1862 and 1889, where he proposed short breakwaters and rock training walls. (Powell, 1974). However, this was not entirely successful as sandbars formed near the opening. Moriarty argued with the harbour engineer John Coode about the cause and remedy, but when Moriarty went on leave prior to his retirement, his successor, C.W. Darley, implemented Coode’s scheme. Part of the remaining north <b>training</b> <b>wall</b> is still called “Moriarty’s Wall” in recognition of his role.|$|E

40|$|The {{coastal regions}} of Kerala are mostly dynamic {{in nature and}} is accentuated {{as the result of}} various {{developmental}} activities taking place along the coastline. Choking of river mouths and sand bar formation is a persistent perennial problem occurring in the tropical states of the Indian sub-continent during non-monsoon seasons. Predominant sediment transport is attributed as a major reason for this occurrence. Critical locations along the Kerala coast were identified to be Cheruvathur, Korapuzha and Chettuvai. Training of river mouths was identified as the long term solution for the aforementioned problem, and hence the same were proposed for construction after carrying out a detailed study by adopting numerical modeling techniques. The magnitude and direction of the net sediment drift is evaluated. The patterns of shoreline changes corresponding to the proposed <b>training</b> <b>walls</b> were assessed. Wave transformation studies for typical monthly wave climate were performed to analyze the phase and amplitude variation in the presence of proposed structures. The detailed analysis of the results from the numerical model that were analyzed are presented and discussed in this paper. Post implementation of the proposed <b>training</b> <b>walls,</b> desirable effects were yielded...|$|R
5000|$|After {{several years}} of deliberations, a {{decision}} was made to build the channel at an estimated cost of $37 million. The channel's construction commenced in 1990 and was completed in April 1994. It is about 2.5 kilometres long, 200 metres wide and between 6 and 6.5 metres deep. [...] Construction involved the excavation of about 4.5 million cubic metres of material. In addition to the excavation work, construction of breakwaters, <b>training</b> <b>walls,</b> a bridge and installation of a sand bypassing system was undertaken.|$|R
5000|$|As before, {{the seats}} were located {{alongside}} the <b>train</b> <b>walls.</b> The top speed was 70 km/h. The smallest unit of these trains were half trains {{made up of}} two double multiple units. After intensive testing the LEW Hennigsdorf factory began manufacturing the trains. The production models had lower side windows and a changed front, but were technically the same. 114 cars were built until 1982. There were 24 more, but those were delivered to Greece for a railway line there. They were returned to Berlin in 1984/85.|$|R
50|$|Despite the <b>training</b> <b>wall</b> and a mini-lighthouse called 'Apex Light' {{which is}} {{situated}} {{at the end of}} the wall, navigation at Trent Falls is not simple. There are no real waterfalls, but there is a very rapid race of water at difficult stages of the tide (especially spring tides), and there is a tidal bore on the Trent (the Trent Aegir). Boats coming down one river with an ebbing tide often have to wait several hours (sometimes beached on the sand, and sometimes overnight) until the tide turns and the flood can carry them up the other river.|$|E
50|$|The River Ouse {{flows to}} the east where it turns into the Humber, and the River Trent flows northwards. It curves {{to the east}} near the confluence, {{although}} this is largely engineered, rather than natural. A <b>training</b> <b>wall</b> {{was built on the}} western bank of the Trent after the First World War, in an attempt to keep the channel in a known position. The rivers deposit large volumes of silt in this area, and charts for coastal shipping have to be updated monthly, but for smaller vessels, the channel can be considered to be reasonably static.|$|E
50|$|Remedial works {{involved}} {{building a}} <b>training</b> <b>wall</b> {{to separate the}} original single spillway into a service spillway and a secondary (emergency) spillway. A concrete slab, anchored to the underlying rock was constructed in {{the floor of the}} main scour channel to provide some additional protection on those rare occasions when the secondary spillway will discharge water over this area. The smaller, more frequent flood events will be discharged through the service spillway onto more scour resistant rock which has performed satisfactorily to date. The secondary spillway will operate very infrequently and will only discharge when the capacity of the service spillway is exceeded.|$|E
5000|$|CAF series 5000: Currently {{servicing}} line [...] {{and occasionally}} line , this model {{has had a}} long history: the first trainsets were delivered in 1974 for the newly opened, first wide-profile line , while the latest subseries, 5500, of which 24 trainsets of 6 cars each were built, entered service in 1993. They were the last to use the old, square [...] "box-like" [...] design from CAF, which was already becoming unpopular for its exaggerate priming of effectiveness versus aesthetics. The first iteration featured a wood lookalike coating for the inner walls and a novel seat distribution in two-seat rows perpendicular to the <b>train</b> <b>walls,</b> making them look not unlike older regional trains. Subseries 5100-5200 returned to the traditional seating along the <b>train</b> <b>walls,</b> but still included another feature from the first iteration, automatic opening of all the gates in the train. The final subseries, 5500, has a distinct, darker color scheme and returns to the usual on-demand opening of train gates with a button on each one. Being the oldest rolling stock in operation in the wide profile lines, many cars were retired or sold to the Buenos Aires Underground for operation on Line B to make up for shortfalls on the line following extensions.|$|R

40|$|Marina di Rimini {{is located}} on the western shore of the Northern Adriatic. The marina itself {{provides}} berthing for pleasure craft, and is accessed through a river channel which is trained several hundred metres into the sea. This layout is common along the Northern Adriatic coastline of Italy. On occasion, however, navigation along the river channel into the marina basin is thwarted by excess levels of wave disturbance. It has been proposed to modify the layout of the river <b>training</b> <b>walls</b> so that greater protection from waves, and therefore safer navigation into the marina, is achieved. The objective of the study reported in this paper was to examine the potential impact on the nearby shoreline of modifying the layout of the river <b>training</b> <b>walls.</b> Numerical models exploit our understanding of physical processes and it has become a standard requirement, in turn, to exploit numerical models when carrying out assessments of the effects of intervening at the coastline. The innovative method of assessment applied here at Marina di Rimini included the numerical modelling of wave propagation and sediment transport from within a GIS. This methodology not only enables straight-forward operability of the embedded models and the provision of readily assimilated model output, but it also takes the functionality of the GIS as a coastal management tool beyond a database and data-analysis system...|$|R
50|$|Until the 1960s the Noosa {{beach and}} river {{entrance}} {{were in a}} state of dynamic equilibrium. The beach was wide and usable and it recovered quickly from the occasional extreme storm events such as cyclones. From the mid 60's rapid development on the beachfront including building a rockwall along the beach created instability. The beach became narrow and often non existent at high tide. At this time the river entered the sea at the present day Noosa Woods. In 1978 a <b>training</b> <b>wall</b> was built to relocate the river entrance to the northwest where it is today.|$|E

The southern Gold Coast beaches were soon faced with intense erosion during storms which was not replenished. In 2001, a sand bypass system was implemented, in part based on the successful operation of the Gold Coast Seaway. [...] The level of sand on southern Gold Coast beaches soon returned to pre-1960s levels.|$|R

50|$|The Gold Coast Seaway or Southport Seaway is {{the main}} {{navigation}} entrance from the Pacific Ocean into the Gold Coast Broadwater and southern Moreton Bay {{and is one of}} Australia’s most significant coastal engineering projects. It is located at the northern end of the Southport Spit where the Nerang River enters the Pacific Ocean. The channel was constructed between 1984 and 1986, primarily to facilitate the safe passage of sea-faring vessels. The passage was previously known as the Southport Bar. The mouth of the Nerang River was once located further south in Broadbeach. The main driving force for this movement is the northward drift of sand along the coast. This northward drift was responsible for the unstable and shifting conditions of the bar, which made crossing it so hazardous for small boats. The southern <b>training</b> <b>wall</b> of the Gold Coast Seaway is the northern end of the Gold Coast Oceanway.|$|E

50|$|The dam {{wall was}} {{extended}} during the 1950s, and completed in 1961, necessitating the wholesale removal of Tallangatta township and its re-establishment {{at a new}} site 8 km west of the original, as well as railway and road diversions. Monitoring of the dam in the early 1990s revealed that the water pressure and leakage had caused the dam to move on its foundations slightly, leading to concerns that the dam was heading for collapse, threatening Albury-Wodonga and the entire Murray basin. Authorities denied any short-term threat. Traffic was banned from the spillway, and remedial work commenced involving, in part, {{the construction of a}} secondary earth wall behind the original to take the strain. Further upgrades to the dam at an estimated cost of 60 million commenced in 2010 and are due for completion in 2015. These works include the installation of an improved filter and drainage system on the junction between the concrete spillway and southern embankment, construction of a concrete buttress on the southern <b>training</b> <b>wall,</b> and possible modifications to improve the ability of the dam to manage extreme floods.|$|E
50|$|Recent {{extensions}} of the Palm Beach area to the west have created new subdivisions with different characteristics including a small section of canal development.
