40|$|By {{means of}} {{clinical}} bone marrow tissue culture influences of sympathetic stimulating or blocking drugs and parasympathetic stimulating or blocking drugs on <b>the</b> <b>function</b> <b>of</b> megakaryocytes were observed. The solution {{of these drugs}} at various concentrations were added directly to the culture media and obtained the following results: 1) <b>The</b> <b>function</b> <b>of</b> megakaryoctes was diminished when epirenamine or nor-epirenamine being sympathetic stimulating drugs added to culture media. 2) 2 -Benzyl-imidazoline-hydrochloride being sympathetic blocking drugs accelerated <b>the</b> <b>function</b> <b>of</b> megakaryocytes. 3) In the cases administered acetylcholine hydrochloride or bethanechol chloride which are parasympathetic stimulating drugs <b>the</b> <b>function</b> <b>of</b> megakaryocytes were accelerated. 4) No effects on <b>the</b> <b>function</b> <b>of</b> megakaryocytes were observed when atropine sulfate or dl-tropyltropate-n-methylbromide were added to culture media directly. These results may conclude that <b>the</b> <b>function</b> <b>of</b> megakaryocytes are diminished when adrenaline that is produced {{at the end of}} sympathetic nerve affects on bone marrow directly and also <b>the</b> <b>function</b> <b>of</b> it is accelerated when acetylcholine which is produced at the end of parasympathetic nerve affects on bone marrow directly...|$|R

30|$|As {{one kind}} of extra condition, we also can supply the {{relationship}} between the two surfaces. The relationship can be assigned based on appropriate assumptions. As the simplest cases, we can give <b>the</b> <b>function</b> <b>of</b> one surface and solve the other surface of the freeform-surface lens.

5|$|Benzodiazepines work by {{increasing}} the efficiency of a natural brain chemical, GABA, to decrease the excitability of neurons. This reduces the communication between neurons and, therefore, has a calming effect on many of <b>the</b> <b>functions</b> <b>of</b> the brain.|$|E
5|$|However, the {{nutritional}} {{significance of these}} components is defined not only by their structure or macronutrient category, {{but also by the}} physiological role that each nutrient serves.

Many of these nutrients are known to play important functional roles within the gut, brain, and elsewhere in the body; <b>the</b> <b>functions</b> <b>of</b> other components are still being elucidated.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the roles}} and {{importance}} of {{the various forms of}} vitamin E are presently unclear, and it has even been suggested that the most important function of α-tocopherol is as a signaling molecule, with this molecule having no significant role in antioxidant metabolism. <b>The</b> <b>functions</b> <b>of</b> the other forms of vitamin E are even less well understood, although γ-tocopherol is a nucleophile that may react with electrophilic mutagens, and tocotrienols may be important in protecting neurons from damage.|$|E

30|$|Besides, the {{semantic}} maps as shown above {{can also provide}} insights for us to solve some long-standing issues in Chinese.

This suggests that <b>the</b> Repetition <b>functions</b> <b>of</b> hai and zai come from different conceptual sources, and our hypothesis is that hai expressing Repetition emphasizes the “similar” feature shared by Repetition and Inverted Sequence while zai expressing Repetition emphasizes the “increasing” feature shared by Repetition and Increment. Argumentation on this hypothesis will be provided in a separate study.|$|R
