5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the shootings, Virginian governor Tim Kaine convened a panel consisting of various officials and experts to investigate and examine the response and handling of issues related to the shootings. The panel released its final report in August 2007, devoting more than 30 pages to detailing Cho's troubled history. In the report, the panel criticized the failure of <b>the</b> <b>educators</b> and mental health professionals who came into contact with Cho during his college years to notice his deteriorating condition and help him. The panel also criticized misinterpretations of privacy laws and gaps in Virginia's mental health system and gun laws. In addition, the panel faulted Virginia Tech administrators in particular for failing to take immediate action after the first shootings. Nevertheless, the report did acknowledge that Cho was still primarily responsible for not seeking assistance and for his murderous rampage.|$|E

At each of these statements, different audience members interrupted Bruner's speech to inform her that her statements were not factual. After an audience member stood up and suggested to Bruner that she visit with superintendents of the area, to which Bruner replied that she had, the local county superintendent stood up and informed Bruner that she had never attempted to meet with her.|$|E

500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1968, under what Sesame Street {{researchers}} Edward Palmer and Shalom Fisch called Lesser's [...] "able leadership", five three-day curriculum planning seminars were conducted in Boston. [...] The purpose of the seminars, attended by educational experts and the new show's writers and producers, was to ascertain which school-preparation skills to emphasize. [...] According to writer Michael Davis, Lesser's skills at encouraging collegiality were evident during the seminars. [...] Writer Louise Gikow reported that the real friction occurred between <b>the</b> <b>educators</b> present. [...] As Sesame Street songwriter Christopher Cerf reported, [...] "... ran meetings better than anyone I've ever seen. [...] He made everybody feel like they were important, that they got listened to, and that their work {{ended up in the}} final product". [...] Davis noted that the seminars also served as a [...] "crash course in child development, psychology, and preschool education" [...] for the show's producers and writers. [...] According to researcher Robert W. Morrow, Lesser understood that in order to bring research about child development into the production process of Sesame Street, a close working relationship had to be created between the researchers and the producers. [...] Davis credited Lesser's [...] "informal, unpretentious, and collaborative" [...] manner with the creation of that close relationship.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. Ed.) [...] North-West University, Vaal Triangle Campus, 2009. Diabetes {{mellitus}} (DM) {{is increasing}} worldwide {{and the number}} of individuals who have this condition in South Africa has also increased drastically. <b>The</b> <b>educator</b> with DM experiences many challenges that affect his or her ability to function effectively. The goal of this in-depth study is to; investigate the causes and physical and emotional effects of DM; investigate <b>the</b> challenges <b>educators</b> with DM face, as well as the effect the condition has on the effective performance of daily tasks in the educational environment; empirically investigate perceptions about DM and its effect on <b>the</b> <b>educator</b> who lives with DM; provide guidelines and make possible recommendations for <b>the</b> <b>educator</b> with DM to perform effectively in the educational sector. For this purpose, terms such as diabetes mellitus, <b>the</b> <b>educator,</b> <b>the</b> <b>educator</b> who has DM, learner of an educator with DM and the effect on the educational system on <b>the</b> <b>educator</b> who has DM had to be clarified. Problems and everyday challenges that <b>the</b> <b>educator</b> with DM faces have been investigated by means of a literature study. The possible perceptions of employers, management, colleagues and learners of educators with DM are also included in the study. Interviews were conducted with eight educators who have DM to obtain information regarding daily challenges they face. The data analysis was conducted carefully, data were arranged and categorised logically and integrated into the core summary of the study. The most important result was that educators who have DM are facing numerous challenges in the educational sector. Guidelines were suggested and possible recommendations were made from the data of the research conducted on educators who have DM that may assist in making the working environment less challenging. These guidelines and adjustments could {{have a positive effect on}} and increase the effective functionality of <b>the</b> <b>educator</b> with DM in the educational sector. More effective functioning of <b>the</b> <b>educator</b> with DM will have a positive effect on learners, colleagues, the education profession and ultimately the educational sector in South Africa.

60|$|As {{women are}} from the {{constitution}} of things <b>the</b> <b>educators</b> of us all at the most critical periods, and mainly of their own sex {{from the beginning to}} the end of education, the writer of the most imperfect treatise on this world-interesting subject can hardly avoid saying something on the upbringing of women. Such a writer may start from one of three points of view; he may consider the woman as destined to be a wife, or a mother, or a human being; as the companion of a man, as the rearer of the young, or as an independent personality, endowed with gifts, talents, possibilities, in less or greater number, and capable, {{as in the case of}} men, of being trained to the worst or the best uses. Of course to every one who looks into life, each of these three ideals melts into the other two, and we can only think of them effectively when they are blended. Yet we test a writer's appreciation of the conditions of human progress by observing the function which he makes most prominent. A man's whole thought of the worth and aim of womanhood depends upon the generosity and elevation of the ideal which is silently present in his mind, while he is specially meditating the relations of woman as wife or as mother. Unless he is really capable of thinking of them as human beings, independently of these two functions, he is sure to have comparatively mean notions in connection with them in respect of the functions which he makes paramount.|$|E
6000|$|Now this is {{all wrong}} and ruinous. The mother's mind should be the lodestar of the daughter's. Anything which loosens the bond of filial reverence, of filial resignation, is even more destructive, if possible, to womanhood than to manhood--the certain bane of both. And the evil fruits are evident enough--self-will and self-conceit in the less gentle, restlessness and dissatisfaction {{in many of the}} meekest and gentlest; talents seem with most a curse instead of a blessing; clever and earnest young women, like young men, are {{beginning}} to wander up and down in all sorts of eclecticisms and dilettanteisms--one year they find out that the dark ages were not altogether barbarous, and by a revulsion of feeling natural to youth, they begin to adore them as a very galaxy of light, beauty, and holiness. Then they begin to crave naturally enough for some real understanding of this strange ever-developing nineteenth century, some real sympathy with its new wonders, some real sphere of labour in it; and this drives them to devour the very newest authors--any book whatever which seems to open for them the riddle of the mighty and mysterious present, which is forcing itself on their attention through every sense. And so up and down, amid confusions and oscillations from pole to pole, and equally eclectic at either pole, from St. Augustin and Mr. Pugin to Goethe and George Sand, and all intensified and coloured by that tender enthusiasm, that craving for something to worship, which is a woman's highest grace, or her bitterest curse--wander these poor Noah's doves, without either ark of shelter or rest for the sole of their foot, sometimes, alas! over strange ocean-wastes, into gulfs of error--too sad to speak of here-- and will wander more and more till teachers begin boldly to face reality, and interpret to them both the old and the new, lest they misinterpret them for themselves. <b>The</b> <b>educators</b> of the present generation must meet the cravings of the young spirit with the bread of life, or they will gorge themselves with poison.
