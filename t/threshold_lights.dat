The pilots performed a normal approach from the East in good conditions and visibility before {{landing on the}} closed runway. No one was hurt, and the aircraft later made a technical flight {{to land on the}} correct runway. The Polish State Commission on Aircraft Accidents Investigation made recommendations to add additional markings to the runway (in the form of red X shapes on the runway), and to modify the ATIS to include warnings about the closed runway. The CAT I ILS was disabled due to the construction, and the aircraft featured an older EGPWS that lacked a [...] "Smart Landing" [...] mode and high resolution map of the area which prevented it from informing the crew of the situation. During the approach, PAPI and <b>threshold</b> <b>lights</b> were set to maximum brightness. The incident is still being investigated by Polish authorities.|$|E
50|$|On {{the land}} of the Gai suburb there already was an {{infrastructure}} with a runway, hangar and a terminal, from the military campaign from 1917. Here, on 14 July 1912, a big meeting took place when Aurel Vlaicu, a pioneer in Romanian aviation, returned from Aspen Vienna and he was seen by his co nationals as a hero of all the Romanians. As a result of some negotiations that took place in order to build a new airport, on 30 May 1935 the civil municipal aviation give the land from the Ceala suburb where the constructions will start for building the infrastructure. The construction work ended in 1936 and the official inauguration of the new airport took place on 14 November 1937. From that moment all the air traffic was conducted on this location and the landings and taking off happened on a grass runway. In 1953 a concrete runway, 2000 meters long, was built, as the increased traffic demanded it. The A and D taxiways were built {{at the same time as}} the runway. The lighting system was rebuilt in 1954 using Elba lamps.Nowadays, the runway, made of concrete with dimensions 2000 X 45 m orientated on East - West direction, is endowed with a state of the art IDMAN lighting system consisting of marginal and axial light, <b>threshold</b> <b>lights,</b> approach lightings on both direction of operation and Category II instrument landing system.|$|E

We tested the morphological response (shoot density and growth) of four Indo-West Pacific seagrass species (Cymodocea serrulata, Halodule uninervis, Halophila ovalis and Zostera muelleri) to six daily light levels ranging from 0 to 23 mol m(- 2) d(- 1) (0 - 70 % surface irradiance) in cool (- 23 degrees C) and warm temperatures (- 28 degrees C) over 14 weeks. The impact of light limitation on shoot densities and growth rates was higher at warm than at cool temperatures, and for 1 muelleri and H. ovalis than for C. serrulata and H. uninervis, {{in terms of both}} the time taken for the low light treatment to take effect and the predicted time to shoot loss (e. g. 17 - 143 days at 0 mol m(- 2) d(- 1)). Using fitted curves we estimated temperature-dependent thresholds (with estimates of uncertainty) for 50 % and 80 % protection of growth and shoot density, defined here as "potential light thresholds" in recognition that they were derived under experimental conditions. Potential <b>light</b> <b>thresholds</b> that maintained 50 % and 80 % of seagrass shoot density fell within the ranges 1. 1 - 5. 7 mol m(- 2) d(- 1) and 3. 8 - 10. 4 mol m(- 2) d(- 1), respectively, depending on temperature and species. <b>Light</b> <b>thresholds</b> calculated in separate in situ studies for two of the same species produced comparable results. We propose that the upper (rounded) values of 6 mol m(- 2) d(- 1) and 10 mol m(- 2) d(- 1) can be used as potential <b>light</b> <b>thresholds</b> for protecting 50 % and 80 % of shoot density for these four species over 14 weeks.

Seagrass cover was measured at similar to 3 month intervals from 2008 to 2011 at three sites: Magnetic Island (MI) Dunk Island (DI) and Green Island (GI). Photosynthetically active radiation was continuously measured within the seagrass canopy, and three light metrics were derived. Complete seagrass loss occurred at MI and DI and at these sites changes in seagrass cover were correlated with the three light metrics. Mean daily irradiance (I(d)) above 5 and 8. 4 mol m⁻² d⁻¹ was associated with gains in seagrass at MI and DI, however a significant correlation (R = 0. 649, p 0. 05) with change in percent cover, except for I(d) which was always high, but correlated with change in seagrass cover. Although distinct <b>light</b> <b>thresholds</b> were observed, the departure from threshold values was also important. For example, light levels that are well below the thresholds resulted in more severe loss of seagrass than those just below the threshold.
