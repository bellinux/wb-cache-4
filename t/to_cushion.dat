5|$|Since {{electrical}} energy cannot easily {{be stored in}} quantities large enough to meet demands on a national scale, at all times exactly as much must be produced as is required. This requires electricity utilities to make careful predictions of their electrical loads, and maintain constant co-ordination with their power stations. A certain amount of generation must always be held in reserve <b>to</b> <b>cushion</b> an electrical grid against inevitable disturbances and losses.|$|E
5|$|Huskisson {{was loaded}} onto the {{flat-bottomed}} wagon of the Duke's train which had carried the band. The remaining three carriages of the Duke's train were detached and the band's carriage, hauled by Northumbrian, {{set off for}} Manchester with Stephenson driving. Lord Wilton held Huskisson's hands and arms steady, while Lord Colville supported his head {{on his knees and}} tried <b>to</b> <b>cushion</b> him from the vibration of the train. With the train almost unladen and Stephenson running the engine flat-out, the train reached the speed of almost , briefly giving those on board the world speed record. The crowds lining the route, unaware of what had happened, cheered and waved as Northumbrian rushed past.|$|E
5|$|Merlin {{reports to}} Camelot's {{physician}} Gaius (Richard Wilson) and saves the old man's {{life when he}} falls from a balcony by magically moving a mattress <b>to</b> <b>cushion</b> his fall. Though initially denying his abilities, Merlin later admits {{that he has had}} magical powers since birth, which Gaius warns him to keep secret. Reading a letter from Merlin's mother, Gaius realises that the boy was sent to Camelot for protection. Meanwhile, in the forest outside Camelot, Mary kills Lady Helen (Myles), a singer who is to perform at Uther's court, with a poppet. Mary assumes Helen's appearance using an enchantment, though her true hideous appearance can still be seen in her reflection (like in mirrors or water).|$|E
50|$|An {{inflatable}} {{air cushion}} is {{a bag of}} fabric or plastic that can be inflated <b>to</b> provide <b>cushioning.</b> Unlike Bubble Wrap, inflatable air cushions have a check valve <b>to</b> allow the <b>cushion</b> <b>to</b> be inflated or sometimes deflated.|$|R

5|$|Pistorius uses {{custom-made}} spike pads on the blades. Before {{development of}} the pads, his spikes were changed by roughing up the surface and applying over-the-counter spikes by hand, but the results using this method were inconsistent. Research was conducted in Össur’s Iceland lab using a pressure-sensitive treadmill and film at 500 fps to measure the blade strike, and produced a spike pad which includes a midsole of two machine-molded pieces of foam of different densities <b>to</b> <b>cushion</b> impact, with a carbon fibre plate on the bottom. The developers attached the pad with contact cement, which can be quickly removed with the application of heat when the spike pad needs to be changed.|$|E
5|$|Inmates were {{permitted}} {{out into the}} yard on Saturdays and Sundays and on holidays for a maximum of 5 hours. Inmates who worked seven days a week in the kitchen were rewarded with short yard breaks during the weekdays. Badly behaved prisoners were liable to having their yard access rights taken away from them on weekends. The prisoners of Alcatraz {{were permitted}} to play games such as baseball, softball and other sports at these times and intellectual games such as chess. Because of the small size of the yard and the diamond at the end of it, a section of the wall behind the first base had to be padded <b>to</b> <b>cushion</b> the impact of inmates overrunning it. Inmates were provided gloves, bats, and balls, but no sport uniforms. In 1938, there were four amateur teams, the Bees, Oaks, Oilers, and Seals, named after Minor League clubs, and four league teams named after Major League clubs, the Cardinals, Cubs, Giants, and Tigers. Many of the inmates used weekends in the yards to converse with each other and discuss crime, the only real opportunities they had during the week for a durable conversation.|$|E

25|$|The Bedok {{class is}} made of {{glass-reinforced}} plastic, designed by the Swedish Navy and Kockums (then known as Karlskronavarvet). Its low magnetic and acoustic signatures reduces the possibility of setting off mines. It is highly durable, fire- and shock-resistant, easy to repair and is maintained only by painting. The ship's bridge, major combat equipment and engines are also shock-mounted <b>to</b> <b>cushion</b> against underwater explosions.|$|E
25|$|A {{mouthguard}} {{is important}} to protect the teeth and gums from injury, and <b>to</b> <b>cushion</b> the jaw, resulting in a decreased chance of knockout. Both fighters must wear soft soled shoes to reduce the damage from accidental (or intentional) stepping on feet. While older boxing boots more commonly resembled those of a professional wrestler, modern boxing shoes and boots tend to be quite similar to their amateur wrestling counterparts.|$|E
25|$|Faced {{with the}} {{destruction}} {{of many of the}} farmlands and the displacement of farmers and other workers the government had to search for a long term solution to address the issue. Agricultural based industries were also greatly affected. Closure of Clark Air base also raised an issue of finding short term livelihoods and the need to use the base lands <b>to</b> <b>cushion</b> the repercussions of the worker’s displacement.|$|E
30|$|As a {{precautionary measure}} against {{impending}} {{effects of climate}} variability, farmers often employ various strategies. These measures are largely dependent on their perception, level of awareness, education, and affordability – tied to their levels of income (Ndamani and Watanabe 2015; Oluoko-Odingo 2011). In Trans-Mara East, the current smallholders' adaptation strategies include those related <b>to</b> <b>cushioning,</b> and enhancing the productivity of, their cropping and livestock rearing practices.|$|R
5000|$|The words zabuton, zafuton and futon {{are closely}} linked. The word zazen meaning [...] "seated {{meditation}}" [...] or [...] "sitting meditation" [...] is also closely linked. In western terms, colloquially speaking, zafu refers <b>to</b> a meditation <b>cushion,</b> and zabuton refers <b>to</b> the <b>cushioned</b> mat upon which a zafu is placed.|$|R
50|$|Back {{and forth}} {{movement}} is typically less stimulating than side-to-side movement. The most stimulating movement {{tends to be}} rotational (spinning) and should be used carefully by the therapist. Ideally therapy will provide a variety of these movements. A rocking motion will usually calm a child while vigorous motions like spinning will stimulate them. Merry-go-rounds, being tossed on <b>to</b> <b>cushions</b> or jumping trampolines can be favorite activities with some children.|$|R
25|$|Because of {{the weak}} economy, the Gulf War and its aftermath, and rising {{operational}} costs, many airlines lost money in 1990 and 1991. The ongoing liberalisation enforced the competition additionally, and Swissair lost 99million Swiss Francs {{in the first half}} year, and so Swissair was not able to pay dividends to its shareholders. In the years 1991 and 1992 Swissair had to dissolve financial reserves <b>to</b> <b>cushion</b> the losses from the commercial aviation sector.|$|E
25|$|Manley's {{second term}} focused on liberalizing Jamaica's economy, with {{the pursuit of}} a free-market {{programme}} that stood in marked contrast to the interventionist economic policies pursued by Manley's first government. Various measures were, however, undertaken <b>to</b> <b>cushion</b> the negative effects of liberalisation. A Social Support Programme was introduced to provide welfare assistance for poor Jamaicans. In addition, the programme focused on creating direct employment, training, and credit for much of the population.|$|E
25|$|The coat {{provided}} some protection against swords and other edged weapons, however, the buff coat was ineffective against firearms, possibly excepting spent bullets. The buff coat was worn under armour, where it helped <b>to</b> <b>cushion</b> the wearer from chafing or bruising by the armour's edges, {{but it also}} was worn {{as an alternative to}} wearing metallic armour. The finest quality buff coats were expensive, which may account for their widespread association with officers and other men of greater than average wealth.|$|E

25|$|The thumb lug on the Umnumzaan is {{used for}} opening the knife blade, as well as serving as the stop pin that {{contacts}} the titanium handle slabs upon lockup. Around each lug is a polyurethane o-ring {{that acts as a}} shock absorber <b>to</b> <b>cushion</b> the shock of opening, and reduce the audible noise of opening. The use of the shock absorber concept was pioneered by knife designers Grant and Gavin Hawk, and is being implemented in the Umnumzaan with their consent.|$|E
25|$|In 2008, Royal Marine Reservist Lance Corporal Matthew Croucher {{received}} the George Cross {{for his actions}} whilst deployed with 40 Commando in Afghanistan. The incident occurred whilst on a reconnaissance patrol, when upon entering a compound he felt himself activate a grenade tripwire. L/Cpl Croucher deliberately fell onto the device aiming to protect his colleagues from the blast. Fortunately he managed <b>to</b> <b>cushion</b> {{the majority of the}} blast with his Bergen whilst his body armour stopped further shrapnel, this left him with only minor injuries and his fellow Marines unharmed.|$|E
25|$|In December 1991, the {{two governments}} were again in talks to extend the {{withdrawal}} of American forces for three years but this broke down as the United States refused to spell out in detail their withdrawal plans or say if nuclear weapons were kept on base; nuclear weapons were forbidden on Philippine soil. Finally, on December 27, President Corazon Aquino, who fought to delay the pullout <b>to</b> <b>cushion</b> the country's battered economy, issued a formal notice for the U.S. to leave {{what has been the}} U.S.'s largest overseas defense facility after Clark Air Base was closed, by the end of 1992.|$|E

25|$|Lead weights can be {{coated with}} a {{protective}} outer layer such as plastic or paint, and this is commonly used for lead abatement. This prevents the lead from corroding or being ground into dust by rubbing, and helps <b>to</b> <b>cushion</b> impacts. However the protection is reduced if the coating is cracked or otherwise damaged. Soft plastics may become brittle over time due to UV degradation {{from the sun and}} loss of plasticizers, leading to cracking and shattering. Encapsulation materials are usually of near neutral buoyancy in water, and reduce the average density of the weights, making the weights slightly less effective, and increasing the overall weight in air of the diving equipment.|$|E
25|$|Wood from mature giant sequoias {{is highly}} {{resistant}} to decay, {{but due to}} being fibrous and brittle, it is generally unsuitable for construction. From the 1880s through the 1920s, logging took place in many groves in spite of marginal commercial returns. The Hume-Bennett Lumber Company {{was the last to}} harvest giant sequoia, going out of business in 1924. Due to their weight and brittleness, trees would often shatter when they hit the ground, wasting much of the wood. Loggers attempted <b>to</b> <b>cushion</b> the impact by digging trenches and filling them with branches. Still, as little as 50% of the timber is estimated to have made it from groves to the mill. The wood was used mainly for shingles and fence posts, or even for matchsticks.|$|E
25|$|Therefore, in December 1988 the General Water and Sanitation Law (Ley General de Servicios Sanitarios) {{allowed the}} {{granting}} of 13 regional concessions to public, private or mixed shareholding companies in each of Chile’s regions. In 1990 the regulatory agency SISS (Superintendencia de Servicios Sanitarios) was created through a separate law. An innovative model of tariff regulation was borrowed from the Chilean electricity and telecommunications sector: Efficient cost levels were estimated for an imaginary model company and used as a benchmark to set tariffs for the utilities. Means-tested subsidies (i.e. subsidies that are granted only to those that demonstrably have limited means) were also introduced {{at the same time}} <b>to</b> <b>cushion</b> the effect of the tariff increase on the poor. The legal framework with some modifications is still in force today.|$|E
