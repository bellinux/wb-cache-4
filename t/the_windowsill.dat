5|$|On {{one side}} of the road is a barber surgeon whose sign advertises Shaving, bleeding, and teeth drawn with a touch. Ecce signum! Inside the shop, the barber, who may be drunk, haphazardly shaves a customer, holding his nose like that of a pig, while spots of blood darken the cloth under his chin. The {{surgeons}} and barbers had been a single profession since 1540 and would not finally separate until 1745, when the surgeons broke away to form the Company of Surgeons. Bowls on <b>the</b> <b>windowsill</b> contain blood from the day's patients.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} a brief {{sequence}} inside a dark room where water drips from an open window. Recreating {{a scene from the}} Andrei Tarkovsky film The Sacrifice, Buck, Berry, and Mills run across the room while Stipe remains seated as a pitcher of milk drops from <b>the</b> <b>windowsill</b> and shatters; the song then begins. Director Singh also drew inspiration from the Italian painter Caravaggio and the video is laden with religious imagery such as Saint Sebastian, the Biblical episode of the Incredulity of Thomas and Hindu deities, portrayed in a series of tableaux.|$|E
25|$|Chanukah – It is {{the custom}} of Chabad Hasidim to place the Chanukah menorah against the room's doorpost (and not on <b>the</b> <b>windowsill).</b>|$|E
50|$|The SCS {{program was}} {{established}} in the late 1970s during the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union. Around this time, SCS operatives reportedly hid eavesdropping devices in pigeons perched on <b>the</b> <b>windowsills</b> of <b>the</b> Soviet Embassy in Washington, D.C.|$|R
25|$|The {{windows at}} Lanier were {{upgraded}} at some point. Originally, they were 4-panel window panes that could each be opened. They were upgraded to standard slide-open windows. Possibly at this point, for currently unknown reasons, many of <b>the</b> <b>windowsills</b> in <b>the</b> {{back side of}} the school were bricked up.|$|R
50|$|A {{continuous}} limestone {{water table}} runs {{around the first}} story at floor level. Limestone is also used for <b>the</b> <b>windowsills,</b> lintels, quoins and steps to the main entrance. A datestone set in the gable field on the east elevation of the main block gives 1849 as the construction date.|$|R
25|$|A single wood-paneled door {{leads into}} the church's interior, with a wood floor and coved ceiling. Between them are plaster walls wainscoted with {{horizontal}} {{tongue and groove}} boards topped by molding at <b>the</b> <b>windowsill</b> level. In the walls are the original metal hardware for placing lanterns.|$|E
25|$|Unlike most house spiders, {{which will}} wander the {{dwelling}} by spring if male, or seek {{refuge from the}} first cold by autumn if female, P. tepidariorum species of both sexes can be encountered in mid-winter, in wall corners or underneath <b>the</b> <b>windowsill.</b> Some species will build their webs there, other can remain almost motionless until prey is abundant.|$|E
25|$|All three entrances use heavy opaque modern metal doors. On the inside, the {{sanctuary}} has curved rows of wooden pews on a hardwood floor divided by a central aisle that offer seating for 350. Laminated wooden buttresses flank all the windows; in between {{them are the}} painted Stations of the Cross. Every third buttress is heavier and thicker. The walls are finished in shiplap below <b>the</b> <b>windowsill</b> level; above that a chair rail sets off a finish of grooved rectangles similar to those on the exterior.|$|E
50|$|In {{some old}} houses <b>the</b> <b>windowsills</b> and <b>the</b> walls often conceal treasures, {{including}} historical relics, such as period newspapers and comic books, {{as well as}} money. It is expected that the treasure hunter, called a TH'er, respect people and property, and this is also strongly stated in the magazine.|$|R

50|$|The {{building}} {{itself is a}} three-story five-by-four-bay structure faced in cobblestones 4 - 7 in wide on the front set amid mortar. There are three rows of cobblestones per limestone quoin {{on the front and}} four per quoin on the end walls, where the stones are 2 - 2.5 in wide. <b>The</b> <b>windowsills,</b> lintels and water table are also of limestone.|$|R
25|$|Five-part Renaissance - early Baroque organ {{from the}} 17th century, {{decorated}} with golden eared ornaments, has winged heads and statues of angels on its wings. In its peak rests {{the statue of}} St. Giorgio. Baroque tracery of chorus from {{the second half of}} the 18th century contains a small organ decorated with acanthus ornamentation. On <b>the</b> <b>windowsill</b> there are reliefs of the apostles individually separated by pilasters with festoons and acanth. It is located in the western part. It consists of 43 registers placed in three boxes. It has 3480 pipes and 20 bells. Threemanual game table controls valves using a pneumatic tracker.|$|E
25|$|Mei's {{disappearance}} prompts Satsuki and {{the neighbors}} {{to search for}} her. Eventually, Satsuki returns in desperation to the camphor tree and pleads for Totoro's help. Delighted to be of assistance, he summons the Catbus, which carries her to where the lost Mei sits. Having rescued her, the Catbus then whisks her and Satsuki over the countryside to see Yasuko in the hospital. The girls perch in a tree outside of the hospital, overhearing a conversation between their parents and discovering {{that she has been}} kept in hospital by a minor cold, but is otherwise doing well. They secretly leave the ear of corn on <b>the</b> <b>windowsill,</b> where it is discovered by the parents, and return home on the Catbus. When the Catbus departs, it disappears from the girls' sight.|$|E
25|$|Celtic Reconstructionist Pagans (or CRs) often {{celebrate}} Samhain on {{the date}} of first frost, or when {{the last of the}} harvest is in and the ground is dry enough to have a bonfire. Some follow the old tradition of building two bonfires, which celebrants and livestock then walk or dance between as a ritual of purification. For CRs, it is a time when the dead are especially honoured. Though CRs make offerings at all times of the year, Samhain is a time when more elaborate offerings are made to specific ancestors. This may involve making a small shrine. Often there will be a meal, where a place for the dead is set at the table and they are invited to join. Traditional tales may be told and traditional songs, poems and dances performed. A western-facing door or window may be opened and a candle left burning on <b>the</b> <b>windowsill</b> to guide the dead home. Divination for the coming year is often done, whether in all solemnity or as games for the children. The more mystically inclined may also see this as a time for deeply communing with their deities, especially those seen as being particularly linked with this festival.|$|E
50|$|Contrary to many light installations, {{direct light}} is {{minimized}} to viewers, instead using the automated timber louvers to reflect light from Klik System's linear LEDs (running along <b>the</b> <b>windowsills,</b> angled upwards with a 10-degree spreader lens). The entire project offsets almost all its energy use, thanks to photo-voltaic panels {{on the roof}} of both Darling Quarter buildings. The project allegedly uses the same power as 5 household vacuum cleaners.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} is to analyse the decay of the precast {{concrete}} elements which characterize the building envelope of the Enel-SGES Building, designed by Giuseppe Samonà in 1959 and built after two years in Palermo. Thanks to the original technical documents, saved in the IUAV archive in Venice and in the Samonà's archive of Parma, and according to contemporary evidence the building history has been defined in detail. Moreover we have studied in deep particular elements of the building envelope made of concrete like <b>the</b> <b>windowsills</b> that have different shape {{in relation to their}} position on the different building façades. The analysis of these elements, which represent the first example of precast concrete elements assembled on site in Palermo, allowed us to classify 17 type of windowsills that are different in shape and in relation to the water downflow. We have also determined the different mechanisms of decay pathologies and, at the end we have defined three different solutions in order to recover <b>the</b> <b>windowsills</b> based on <b>the</b> different entity of the decay...|$|R
5000|$|Built of brick, the privy {{features}} {{elements of}} limestone. It is a rectangular {{building with a}} gabled roof and a chimney at each end; two doors pierce the front, while two full windows and a small semicircular light are placed in the side. [...] Rather than being built simply functionally without unnecessary elements, the building features the high styling of Romanesque Revival architecture, such as rusticated stone trim and decorative stonework in the arches that top the entrances. Stonework is used {{in many of the}} components that were expected to see heavy use, including <b>the</b> steps, <b>the</b> <b>windowsills,</b> <b>the</b> thresholds, and the water table.|$|R
2500|$|They got {{together}} again the following May in New York, {{while he and}} [...] John Lennon were there to inaugurate Apple Records. A few weeks after he returned to London he invited her {{to spend some time}} with him there. When she arrived, they went to his home where they spent the evening. [...] "He must have been really happy that night," [...] said one of the fans who often loitered outside his home. [...] "He sat on <b>the</b> <b>windowsill</b> with his acoustic guitar and sang 'Blackbird' to us" [...] from his upstairs room.|$|E
2500|$|On 4 March 2015, {{a formal}} {{announcement}} was made, confirming the project, with Ullman {{saying that it}} was a 'privilege to be doing this,' and [...] "I still feel as inspired to inhabit people as I did when I was six, standing on <b>the</b> <b>windowsill</b> in my mother's bedroom, putting on a show." [...] Shane Allen, controller of comedy commissioning added: [...] "It's about time the Americans gave her back. Tracey has been the missing gem in the British comedy crown for too long. Talent doesn't come much bigger and the BBC audience is in for a huge treat." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the {{aftermath}} of their father's death, their mother would slip into a deep depression and {{spend a lot of}} time in bed. In an effort to cheer her up, Ullman, along with her sister, created and performed a nightly variety show on <b>the</b> <b>windowsill</b> in their mother's bedroom. “It was originally the Patti Ullman Show. So I’m a spin-off of my sister’s show, as she likes to point out.” In the show, Ullman would mimic neighbours, teachers, family members, and celebrities such as Julie Andrews and Édith Piaf. [...] "Some kids can play the piano or kick a football; I could just impersonate everyone." [...] She would also perform alone for herself after everyone had gone to bed. [...] "I'd stand in front of the mirror and talk to myself until I fell asleep. I'd interview myself as women with problems. Women in documentaries who had three kids and chain-smoked and husbands in prison that hit them." [...] Her mother would eventually remarry to a man who Ullman has described as a maniac who drove a London taxi and had a son who stole. [...] "We weren't the Brady Bunch, let me tell you!" [...] The marriage brought an end to the children's late night antics. [...] "There was a new person in her bed now and I couldn't do my nightly performance anymore. I was nine years old and my show had been cancelled." [...] Alcoholism and domestic violence became a common occurrence in the household. The marriage also resulted in the family moving around the country, with Ullman attending numerous state schools. Her flair for mimicry helped with the transitions as her new classmates didn't take to her upper crust accent. [...] "I had to talk like them to avoid being beaten up." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{technology}} for these cars {{was based on}} the Presidents Conference Committee streetcar but also borrowed design elements from the North Shore Line's Electroliners. The 5000-series was distinct in that each car was a three-piece articulated unit, the only cars on the [...] "L" [...] system to ever feature articulation. They were also the first series of [...] "L" [...] cars to be wider at <b>the</b> <b>windowsills</b> than at <b>the</b> doorsills to permit more interior space and still provide clearance for station platforms.|$|R
50|$|On the {{interior}} of the depot, the original passenger area has walls and ceiling finished in tongue-and-groove boarding, placed vertically below the level of <b>the</b> <b>windowsills</b> and horizontally above. It has the original maple flooring. The original baggage portion of the depot has more utilitarian walls and open-truss roof framing, and most of the floor is elevated to the height of a wagon to facilitate loading of baggage. Between the passenger area and the baggage room is the original ticket office containing the large bay window.|$|R

5|$|Federal Hill is made {{primarily}} of brick fired on-site and {{laid in the}} Flemish bond pattern. The mansion possesses a foundation crafted of limestone native to the surrounding countryside. <b>The</b> <b>windowsills</b> and mantels were finely carved by a free black craftsman. The mansion is designed in the Federal Style. Federal Hill has three floors traversed by a staircase located within a central hallway on each floor and an English basement. The first floor's main rooms are a dining room, parlor, and library. The second floor consists of three bedrooms similarly spaced to the rooms below.|$|R
50|$|The Centralia Elks Lodge is a {{historic}} building located at 328 E. Broadway in Centralia, Illinois. The Classical Revival building was constructed between 1929 and 1931 for Centralia Lodge 493, the city's chapter of the Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks. The entrance to the building is flanked by Ionic columns. The second-story windows on the front facade are topped with limestone pediments and segmented arches; <b>the</b> <b>windowsills</b> feature decorative brackets. Limestone cornices top both stories of the building, and a cartouche bordered by scrolls sits on the roofline above the central front window.|$|R
50|$|The {{red brick}} facade has two arched {{openings}} {{on the ground}} floor and two pairs of arched sash windows separated by a central column on the second floor. <b>The</b> <b>windowsills</b> and <b>the</b> bases of the ground floor arches are cast stone. The Hope Building originally had eight windows in each side wall, four upstairs and four downstairs, but all but two upstairs windows on the west side have been covered by later construction. The building's interior has been remodeled many times and does not retain any original details.|$|R

60|$|In {{a moment}} Affery had thrown the {{stocking}} down, started up, caught hold of <b>the</b> <b>windowsill</b> {{with her right}} hand, lodged herself upon the window-seat with her right knee, and was flourishing her left hand, beating expected assailants off.|$|E
50|$|The site's {{isolated}} {{location and}} lack of available building materials proved {{a challenge to the}} construction process. Stone for <b>the</b> <b>windowsills</b> and <b>the</b> corners was quarried at Lower Fort Garry, dressed and hauled overland during the winter. Timber was freighted from Ontario. A brick-making machine from St. Paul, Minnesota was employed in the manufacture of over 400,000 bricks from local clay. Despite efforts to avoid wastage due to difficulties in transporting materials, by the time the Penitentiary was completed in February, 1877, the final cost was $125,000—some $9000 over budget. Some 60 tradesmen worked during the summer months and 25 stonemasons during the winters.|$|R
5000|$|The bath {{consists}} of three sections: [...] "soyunmalık", where the customers take off their clothes, [...] "ılıklık", meaning [...] "warm place" [...] and [...] "sıcaklık", meaning [...] "hot place". According to Haşmet Muzaffer Gürkan, the [...] "soyunmalık" [...] section {{consists of}} the original remains of the Latin church. A large dome and central massage platform {{are present in the}} [...] "sıcaklık" [...] area, which is considered the main section of the bath. The ashlar building has one floor. The arch at the entry has Gothic reliefs and decorative elements as it is a remnant from the Latin church, along with <b>the</b> <b>windowsills</b> in <b>the</b> [...] "soyunmalık" [...] section.|$|R
50|$|Returning to {{work again}} at The Comanche Chief newspaper, Hill began to spend idle time {{exploring}} the local terrain. His interest in geology grew as he took special interest in the many flat-topped mesas and buttes in the region. One butte in particular, named Round Mountain, was located only 6 mi to the northwest of Comanche and he often {{climbed to the top}} to enjoy the view. Although he had little knowledge of geology at this point, he found the fossils along its rocky slopes to be fascinating and he began to collect specimens. Hill’s collection of fossils grew and soon cluttered <b>the</b> <b>windowsills</b> and filled <b>the</b> corners of the newspaper office.|$|R
