Although the Reptilians and Insectoids want to attack the humans, Degra advises them {{to continue with the}} plan to build the superweapon. On Enterprise, Sub-Commander T'Pol continues to help Commander Tucker with Vulcan neuropressure sessions. The ship, seeking <b>the</b> <b>formula</b> <b>for</b> a compound to reinforce its hull against spatial anomalies, then approaches a planet with a vast floating alien bazaar. Captain Archer leads an away team to meet with B'Rat Ud, a chemist who they have met before.|$|E
5|$|After bartering, {{he sells}} them <b>the</b> <b>formula</b> <b>for</b> liquid trellium-D, and also informs {{them that the}} Xindi {{recently}} visited a merchant nearby. Archer meets the merchant, Zjod, a slaver who tries to sell him a female called Rajiin. Archer refuses and leaves, but Rajiin chases after him. Following a fight between Archer and Zjod, the away team leave with Rajiin, and Archer promises to return her to her home planet. Later she approaches Archer in his quarters, and as she nears him she puts him in a trance, and he no longer remembers her visit. Meanwhile, T'Pol and Tucker attempt to replicate the chemical from B'Rat's formula but the first attempt fails.|$|E

Matsuda does not comply and is eventually tied to a chair in a remote building. As the Earth's atmosphere heats up due to the approaching world, Ginko again arrives to learn why Planet R is not yet destroyed. They locate Matsuda through Pairan technology and gather <b>the</b> <b>formula</b> <b>for</b> the device. The scientists then all watch as the nuclear device is shot from the space station and destroys Planet R, cooling the atmosphere and removing the threat. Ginko then changes back to her original form aboard the space station.|$|E
