5|$|Longfellow {{moved to}} Cambridge {{to take a}} job at Harvard College as Smith Professor of Modern Languages and of Belles Lettres. A friend, Cornelius Conway Felton, {{recommended}} that Longfellow rent a room {{on the third floor of}} the home of a Professor Stearns on Kirkland Street; Longfellow stayed there for the 1836–1837 academic year. He disliked the place, however, and sought out better accommodations. Beginning in the summer of 1837, he rented rooms on the east side of the second floor of the home on Brattle Street, now owned by Elizabeth Craigie. At first, Mrs. Craigie <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> student at Harvard and refused to rent to him until he convinced her that he was a professor as well as the author of the book she was reading, Outre-Mer.|$|E

25|$|Early in life, Ford's {{politics}} were conventionally progressive; his favorite presidents were Democrats Franklin D. Roosevelt and John F. Kennedy and Republican Abraham Lincoln. But despite these leanings, many <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> Republican {{because of his}} long association with actors John Wayne, James Stewart, Maureen O'Hara and Ward Bond.|$|E
25|$|The Felt {{theory was}} a strong one... Felt had a {{personal}} motive for acting. After the death of J. Edgar Hoover... Felt <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> leading candidate to succeed Hoover... The characteristics were a good fit. The trouble with Felt's candidacy was that Deep Throat in All the President's Men simply did not sound {{to me like a}} career FBI man.|$|E

25|$|The {{scandal that}} {{followed}} Mesmer's unsuccessful attempt {{to treat the}} blindness of an 18-year-old musician, Maria Theresia Paradis, led him to leave Vienna in 1777. In February 1778 Mesmer moved to Paris, rented an apartment {{in a part of}} the city preferred by the wealthy and powerful, and established a medical practice. Paris soon divided into those who <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> charlatan who had been forced to flee from Vienna and those who thought he had made a great discovery.|$|E
25|$|The rumours {{of another}} castrato sequestered in the Vatican for the {{personal}} delectation of the Pontiff until {{as recently as}} 1959 have been proven false. The singer in question was a pupil of Moreschi's, Domenico Mancini, such a successful imitator of his teacher's voice that even Lorenzo Perosi, Direttore Perpetuo of the Sistine Choir from 1898 to 1956 and a strenuous opponent {{of the practice of}} castrato singers, <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> castrato. Mancini was in fact a moderately skilful falsettist and professional double bass player.|$|E

Murray then retired and started working at a toy store. He also appeared on a talk show in another episode with Simon the monster hunter and two other characters and everyone laughed at him. This character was scrapped after season 1.|$|E

500|$|The book Conversations with Woody Allen {{reports that}} {{director}} Woody Allen wanted to cast Downey and Winona Ryder in his film Melinda and Melinda in 2005, {{but was unable}} to do so because he could not get insurance on them, stating, [...] "We couldn't get bonded.

When Grissom emerges from his room, she asks him [...] "How long have you and Sara been together?"

500|$|Executive {{producer}} Diederick Santer {{has discussed}} the [...] "wonderfully dysfunctional mother-son relationship" [...] Nick shares with Dot and her perpetual willingness to give Nick another chance {{regardless of his}} history of wrongdoing. Santer explained: [...] "There’s that thing where you sort of dare to hope that someone’s changed, which is really tragic. They’ve let you down a hundred times, and yet you still hope that the hundred and first time they’ll have changed." [...] Actor Leslie Grantham has stated that Dot is the [...] "one friend in [...] life", while series story producer Dominic Treadwell-Collins has affirmed: [...] "Dot’s always going to forgive him. And that’s the beauty of Nick and Dot." [...] Concurring with this sentiment, John Altman (Nick) agreed: [...] "No matter what he does, she’ll forgive him.

500|$|In December 2006, Robert [...] "Evel" [...] Knievel sued West for {{trademark}} infringement in West's video for [...] "Touch the Sky". Knievel {{took issue with}} a [...] "sexually charged video" [...] in which West takes on the persona of [...] "Evel Kanyevel" [...] and attempts flying a rocket over a canyon. The suit claimed infringement on Knievel's trademarked name and likeness. Knievel also claimed that the [...] "vulgar and offensive" [...] images depicted in the video damaged his reputation. The suit sought monetary damages and an injunction to stop distribution of the video. West's attorneys argued that the music video amounted to satire and therefore was covered under the First Amendment. Just days {{before his death in}} November 2007, Knievel amicably settled the suit after being paid a visit from West, saying, [...] "I <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> wonderful guy and quite a gentleman." ...|$|E
500|$|By morning, {{the friends}} {{return to their}} {{respective}} homes to discover what punishment awaits them.

At school, Thomas, Costa and J.B. are cheered by the students and Thomas reconciles romantically with Kirby. In the epilogue, T-Rick is recovered alive following the explosion, Thomas is convicted for disturbing the peace, contributing to the delinquency of minors, and inciting a riot, and Costa and J.B. are acquitted; Costa because of his expensive lawyer and J.B. because his parents convince the court that he is mentally incapable and unfit to stand trial. Costa, however, is currently waiting for the results of three paternity tests. [...] Dax, meanwhile, is under investigation for the disappearance of his parents. In an interview with Jillian Reynolds, Costa promises his next party will be even better.|$|E
500|$|Ultimately, Fellini {{drew his}} three leading players from people {{associated}} with the 1954 film Donne Proibite (Angels of Darkness), directed by Giuseppe Amato, in which Masina played the very different role of a madam. Anthony Quinn was also acting in the film, while Richard Basehart was often on the set visiting his wife, actress Valentina Cortese. When Masina introduced Quinn to her husband, the actor was disconcerted by Fellini's insistence that the director had found his Zampanò, later remembering: [...] "I <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> little bit crazy, and I told him I wasn't interested in the picture, but he kept hounding me for days." [...] Not long afterwards, Quinn spent the evening with Roberto Rossellini and Ingrid Bergman, and after dinner they watched Fellini's 1953 Italian comedy-drama I Vitelloni. According to Quinn: [...] "I was thunderstruck by it. I told them the film was a masterpiece, and that the same director {{was the man who}} had been chasing me for weeks." ...|$|E
