40|$|By {{reducing}} the fuel costs of <b>travel,</b> <b>motor</b> vehicle efficiency, improvements tend {{to increase the}} demand for travel, thereby offsetting some of the energy-saving benefit of the efficiency improvement and creating a "rebound" effect. The key factor is the elasticity of vehicle travel with respect to fuel cost per mile. Past studies offer {{a wide range of}} estimates depending on model formulation and time period, with more recent analyses indicating that travel is insensitive to fuel costs and efficiency. This paper analyzes U. S. light-duty, vehicle miles travelled from 1966 89, examining a variety of statistical issuesthat bear {{on the size of the}} "rebound" effect, including error structure, functional form, and possible lagged effects. The results consistently confirm that the 'rebound" effect has been quite small, about 5 15 %, or less; and that short-run (one year) adjustments accounted for essentially all of the change in travel due to fuel price and fuel economy changes. The findings imply that the energy savings of technical fuel economy improvements to cars and light trucks will be only slightly reduced by increased vehicle travel. They also imply that gasoline taxes would need to be very large in order to stimulate significant reductions in travel. ...|$|R

40|$|Evidence on the {{relevance}} of lead in petrol to lead in blood has come from two main sources. Cross sectional studies of blood lead levels in population samples and {{in the air to}} which they are exposed suggest that petrol makes only a very small contribution. However longitudinal studies in the USA in which changes in lead levels in petrol and changes in blood lead have been studied suggest that petrol makes a substantial contribution to blood lead. The possibility that this discrepancy might be explained by the exposure of subjects to very high levels of lead when <b>travelling</b> in <b>motor</b> vehicles is examined, and rejected...|$|R
