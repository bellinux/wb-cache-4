5000|$|According to the Association of University Staff of New Zealand (AUS) in 2007, New Zealand universities, {{including}} the University of Auckland, {{had been taking}} a more litigious approach to managing their staff {{in recent years and}} engaged lawyers and employment advocates to handle even minor matters. The University of Auckland [...] "paid out more than $780,000 in 2006 <b>to</b> <b>settle</b> <b>problems</b> it listed as including personal grievances and disputes". For example, Paul Buchanan, a popular, world-renowned lecturer on international relations and security, was summarily dismissed in 2007 because a student to whom he sent an email complained that she found his comments about her performance in his class to be offensive. He was later reinstated, but this was just a formality and he never returned to lecturing. As the AUS would not financially support a case for full reinstatement, Buchanan accepted the formal reinstatement and a nominal monetary payout as a settlement of his appeal to the Employment Court.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn high {{performance}} computing, many large scientific and engineering problems are solved on a supercomputer {{which is the}} gathering of two specialized entities, one dedicated to computations and another one to I/O. Many applications <b>to</b> <b>settle</b> <b>problems</b> have deterministic behaviors in computations and I/O. This knowledge {{may be used to}} load data in advance or delegate data writing on dedicated nodes. Thereby, it could be interesting to use the specialized parts of the supercomputer and this knowledge {{in order to have a}} better cache management by uncoupling computations and I/O.

40|$|According to Howard Clinebell, {{pastoral}} counselling {{involves the}} utilisation, by persons in ministry, of one-to-one relationships, to enable healing empowerment, and growth, {{to take place}} with individuals and their relationships. 1 From the Christian point of view, the above definition {{can be understood as}} a Christian mutual concern for relationships. This concern includes the well-being of individuals within the congregation, the extended family, in both small and large communities, whose lives are being both enriched, and challenged, by other cultures. The concept of mutual concern (pastoral care), and counselling, always plays a very important role in our Melanesian societies. It is part of our traditional social and religious structure, which sometimes can be called “cultural counselling”. The approach, here, is directly related to, and only has meaning in, a particular culture and customs of our people, all through the Melanesian region. Traditional cultural counselling covers both social and religious matters, and its aim is not only to advise and instruct the individual, but also <b>to</b> <b>settle</b> <b>problems</b> that concern the whole community. The Importance of Traditional Values in Melanesia The search for a Melanesian approach to pastoral counselling can be best understood, and found, within Melanesian traditional values. Such values vary, according to many different languages, and tribal groupings, and customs. However, one of the most-common values within Melanesian society, is that of a “traditional community”. Although the shape and size of the community varies from one society to another, the group of people, which is essentia 1 fo...|$|E

In {{the light}} of {{enlarged}} threats of terrorism, and with an intention to protect European culture of living by increasing the security of rail passengers and personnel, rail security systems shall establish a new organization and apply new detection and protection technologies. The work presents potential areas of application of detection and protection technologies appropriate to public rail transport, as well as operational and technical requirements that place new challenges {{to the development of}} detection and protection technologies. Present-day Terrorism The history of mankind is primarily the history of conflicts and wars, together with efforts <b>to</b> <b>settle</b> <b>problems</b> between states in a peaceful way. The culture of using violence in the family and in international relationships for the purpose of imposing one's own interests has a long history and various manifestations. War and terrorism are the most common among them. Traumas resulting from {{the use of force in}} interpersonal relations are experienced by individuals, communities, and by states. The development of civilisation has evidenced that damage from performing such politics is enormous. Technological development has stimulated the existence and easy use of weapons for mass destruction, stronger destructive effects and unrecoverable consequences. Mankind has become aware of a real hazard from total destruction if the use of force does not stop primarily at settling political relations in the society and among states; as a result we are approaching the period when refraining from the use of force in international relations has been pervasive. War becomes an unacceptable social phenomenon if not being defensive. Inappropriate use of force is codified as a war crime and infringement of human rights. 1 What about Terrorism? For the purpose of easier understanding, the problem of terrorism and interdependence of relevant factors are shown in the following block diagram in Figure 1...|$|E
