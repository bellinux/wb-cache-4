40|$|Mobile {{market has}} grown very fast {{during the last}} decade and {{revenues}} from mobile telephony have increased. The sudden growth in mobile telephony market revealed regulatory needs in particular services. The crucial service that regulators mainly focus was Mobile Termination service since it was identified that operators have monopoly power in termination service. By this identification, a debate on whether mobile <b>termination</b> <b>rates</b> need to be regulated arose. This master thesis exemines the debate in detail. Some argue that mobile <b>termination</b> <b>rates</b> are high and high <b>termination</b> <b>rates</b> may cause some market failures. To understand whether mobile <b>termination</b> <b>rates</b> are high, the incentives of the mobile operator: are discussed. Mobile operators have different incentives to set high termination charges for fixed-to-mobile (FTM) and mobile-to-mobile (MTM) calls. Therefore, it is plausible to examine termination issue separately in FTM and MTM markets. The thesis illustrates that while FTM <b>termination</b> <b>rates</b> need to the regulated since incentives are strong, MTM termination charges {{are less likely to be}} regulated. However, termination charges are high not only for FTM, but they are also high for MTM in many countries. Therefore, countries regulate <b>termination</b> <b>rates</b> in both FTM and MTM markets. The issue of mobile termination in Turkey is discussed and compared to the Europe. The regulatory procedures in mobile <b>termination</b> <b>rates</b> in Turkey seem to be the opposite of those in Em-ope: while FTM <b>termination</b> <b>rates</b> are not regulated. MTM <b>termination</b> <b>rates</b> are regulated...|$|R

50|$|In the European mobile {{telecommunications}} sector, absent a {{bill and keep}} arrangement, the wholesale markets have traditionally applied the calling party pays (CPP) principle in which an originating network pays the terminating network a charge called the mobile <b>termination</b> <b>rate</b> (MTR) or fixed <b>termination</b> <b>rate</b> (FTR) for calls to the terminating network. The MTRs paid under the CPP model, therefore, act as a cost floor to the retail pricing, preventing lowering of prices and innovation of retail propostitions. In many countries including the UK, the CPP model has thus led to {{a high level of}} regulatory activity aimed at capping the MTRs at a competitive level, which inevitably acts to reinforce the cost floor rather than being pro-competitive.|$|E

5000|$|Norrish and Smith, Trommsdorff, and later, Schultz and Harborth, {{concluded}} that autoacceleration must {{be caused by}} a totally different polymerization mechanism. They rationalized through experiment that a decrease in the <b>termination</b> <b>rate</b> was the basis of the phenomenon. This decrease in <b>termination</b> <b>rate,</b> kt, is caused by the raised viscosity of the polymerization region when the concentration of previously formed polymer molecules increases. Before autoacceleration, chain termination by combination of two free-radical chains is a very rapid reaction that occurs at very high frequency (about one in 104 collisions). However, when the growing polymer molecules - with active free-radical ends - are surrounded in the highly viscous mixture consisting of a growing concentration of [...] "dead" [...] polymer, the rate of termination becomes limited by diffusion. The Brownian motion of the larger molecules in the polymer [...] "soup" [...] is restricted, therefore limiting the frequency of their effective (termination) collisions.|$|E
40|$|Firms {{in mobile}} {{telephone}} markets charge {{one another for}} delivering calls to subscribers. These so-called termination charges are controversial from a policy perspective since they are fairly high and stable. We present a model of consumer and firm behavior in mobile markets {{in order to identify}} the role of termination charges in determining the market equilibrium. We analyze three segments of the mobile market: termination, calling, and subscribing. Our model predicts a “waterbed effect”, that is, high <b>termination</b> <b>rates</b> will be associated with low subscription prices, if preferences are the primary source of variation in <b>termination</b> <b>rates.</b> If costs are the main driver of <b>termination</b> <b>rates</b> our model predicts a “tide ” hypothesis in which high <b>termination</b> <b>rates</b> exist alongside high subscription prices. We test these and other predictions from our model using international data on mobile subscriptions per person. We find results which are broadly consistent with our model. More specifically, we find evidence that mobile <b>termination</b> <b>rates</b> are positive and significantly related to mobile phone adoption. This result is robust to the inclusion of a variety of other structural, institutional, demographic, and income controls. We also find that competition, internet subscriptions, and a free press are positively associated with mobile phone adoption while fixed <b>termination</b> <b>rates</b> and inequality slow the adoption of mobile technologies...|$|R

5000|$|However, the {{question}} of how a called party could avoid paying for unwanted calls (e.g., advertisements, tele-sales, or polls) is raised. The answer is that it is the callee's responsibility to distinguish, which call is important and should be accepted and which should be rejected. This {{is only one of the}} RPP side effects [...] that feared to slow-down the mobile sector in the past. The RPP principle may add an extra degree of freedom in the mobile call charges, since the <b>termination</b> <b>rate</b> is not a part of the total cost that the caller has to pay. However, it is also adding a considerably big overhead for consumers such as the provider selection decision, while considering the callee role.|$|E
50|$|The {{total cost}} of each call placed by a {{subscriber}} of a Mobile Network Operator (MNO) is split in two parts. The first part is the amount that the caller’s provider is charging {{in order to provide}} the service to the calling party. However, a considerably big amount of the total calling cost, includes the amount that the provider of the call-receiver will charge caller’s MNO, in order to terminate his call into his network. Since {{the early years of the}} mobile communications, a significant effort has been put from the scientific community, as well as from the regulation authorities, in order to reduce the negative effects of the termination rates monopoly. However, the attempt to overcome any negative effects of this monopoly is limited in charging solutions mainly focused on the paying party of the <b>termination</b> <b>rate,</b> or in regulation rules that need to be enforced to the MNOs by the respective regulation authorities. Thus, the Calling Party Pays (CPP) principle with a strong regulator presence, and the Receiving party pays (RPP) principle, claim to eliminate the negative effects of the monopolistic termination rates market.|$|E
40|$|A {{method is}} {{presented}} {{by which the}} time-dependent average <b>termination</b> <b>rate</b> coefficient in an emulsion polymerization may be calculated as an appropriate average of the chain-length-dependent <b>termination</b> <b>rate</b> coefficients. The method {{takes advantage of the}} fact that the overall <b>termination</b> <b>rate</b> is dominated by terminations between rapidly moving short radicals and much slower long ones. This <b>termination</b> <b>rate</b> coefficient is suitable for use in the Smith-Ewart equations describing the compartmentalization of radicals in an emulsion polymerization. Rate data in emulsion polymerizations can be quantitatively interpreted if the kinetics fall into one of two categories: zero-one (showing compartmentalization; intraparticle termination is not rate-determining) or pseudo-bulk (no compartmentalization; intraparticle termination is rate-determining). The new method can be used to interpret rate data for systems falling between these categories and also can be used to find <b>termination</b> <b>rate</b> coefficients from Monte Carlo simulations of termination kinetics. The latter is especially useful for predicting and understanding kinetics in controlled radical polymerizations in disperse media. (C) 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc...|$|E
5000|$|Given {{that there}} is no {{substitute}} for a termination service, the terminating MNO (T) enjoys a monopoly position for this service under the CPP principle. Thus T is able to exploit the originating MNO O by setting monopolistic <b>termination</b> <b>rates.</b> Of course, this holds for each termination of mobile calls under CPP, as long as termination can be realized by a single network only. Consequently, there is always an incentive for terminating MNOs to set monopolistic <b>termination</b> <b>rates,</b> irrespective of which MNO (here T or O) serves as the originating or terminating MNO. Moreover, since termination fees can be considered as part of the marginal costs of calls, originating networks have the incentive to pass high <b>termination</b> <b>rates</b> on to their own customers.|$|R
40|$|When {{a person}} uses the {{traditional}} wireline telephone network to call another person {{on his cell}} phone, the fixed network must transfer the call to the mobile network to which the recipient subscribes. The fixed network provides originating access for the call, and the mobile network provides terminating access. This paper provides an economic analysis of the regulation of fixed-to-mobile <b>termination</b> <b>rates.</b> Mobile party pays (2 ̆ 2 MPP 2 ̆ 2) creates better incentives than calling party pays (2 ̆ 2 CPP 2 ̆ 2) for mobile network operators to place downward pressure on <b>termination</b> <b>rates.</b> Cellular telephone use in the United States and Canada has continued to increase at a significant pace despite the MPP regime and now far exceeds mobile telephone use in countries with CPP regimes. Multiple factors, including substitution possibilities for the callers of mobile subscribers, constrain the market power of mobile operators in setting mobile <b>termination</b> <b>rates</b> under CPP regimes. It is unrealistic for regulators to attempt to set mobile <b>rates,</b> including <b>termination</b> <b>rates,</b> at marginal cost. If large fixed network costs and customer acquisition costs must be recovered from variable charges, then marginal-cost-based pricing is not feasible. Also, the value to callers {{of being able to}} reach mobile subscribers justifies mobile termination charges that exceed marginal cost because of network externalities in mobile telecommunications. Finally, mobile <b>termination</b> <b>rates</b> that exceed marginal cost (or its proxy, long-run average incremental cost) are consistent with Ramsey (quasi-efficient) pricing. To the extent that high <b>termination</b> <b>rates</b> are a problem in countries that have embraced CPP, it is because customers are poorly informed of the charges they pay for their terminating calls. Consumer education would solve the potential market failure without the need to impose price regulation on otherwise competitive markets...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the link}} between <b>termination</b> <b>rate</b> reductions and retail prices. It draws on in-depth case studies of South Africa, Namibia and Kenya where regulators have reduced termination rates towards {{the cost of an}} efficient operator. To varying degrees these have all led to lower retail prices and a significant market expansion. While both Namibia and Kenya, experienced significant retail price reduction following substantial <b>termination</b> <b>rate</b> reductions, the case of South Africa demonstrates that <b>termination</b> <b>rate</b> reductions are not automatically passed through to consumers. In South Africa only the second reduction in March 2012 allowed smaller operators to reduce their off-net prices to a level could tempt subscribers from dominant operators to switch. The case studies confirm that retail prices do not go up in response to termination rates going down, in CPNP (calling-party's-network-pays) markets as contended by dominant mobile operators. This is also in contrast to a body of academic literature stating that termination rates and mobile retail prices constitute a two-sided market and that <b>termination</b> <b>rate</b> reductions will lead to a so called waterbed effect. This study draws on a database of all prepaid products available in 46 African countries which were collected monthly for the period January 2011 to June 2012. The OECD price basket methodology is used to compare prices between countries and between operators. In-depth face-to-face interviews on <b>termination</b> <b>rate</b> regulations were also held with regulators in Kenya, Namibia and South Africa. The analysis is further supplemented with an analysis of audited financial statements of dominant operators in each market, namely Vodacom South Africa, MTN South Africa, Telkom South Africa, MTC 2 in Namibia, and Safaricom in Kenya...|$|E
40|$|It is broadly {{accepted}} that mobile network operators are monopolists when {{they set the}} <b>termination</b> <b>rate</b> for the calls made to their own network. Since the mobile-to-fixed termination rates are usually regulated at cost and the fixed network operator has the obligation to terminate the incoming calls, therefore the fixed provider can neither threaten to raise the mobile-to-fixed termination charge, nor threaten to refuse to terminate the call. Hence, mobile network operators can fix high fixed-to-mobile termination rates. We propose a policy to overcome this termination bottleneck imposing reciprocity between the mobile-to-fixed and fixed-to-mobile termination rates and relaxing the interconnection obligation. First, we consider a benchmark where mobile-tofixed termination rates are regulated at cost and fixed and mobile network operators negotiate the fixed-to-mobile <b>termination</b> <b>rate.</b> We show that fixedto-mobile termination rates depend negatively on the MTM <b>termination</b> <b>rate</b> and positively on the intensity of competition in the mobile sector.
