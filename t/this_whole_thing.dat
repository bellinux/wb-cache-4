500|$|Describing {{the various}} songs on Bleach, Christopher Sandford wrote: [...] "'Paper Cuts' {{includes}} a folk-influence melody and ponderous rhythm {{of an early}} Led Zeppelin number; 'Mr. Moustache' addressed itself to Nirvana's male fans; 'Downer' showed the same exceptional contempt for the group's audience". Sandford felt [...] "School" [...] – which features only four lines of lyrics – was memorable for its chorus that [...] "served as the rip". While [...] "Scoff" [...] is [...] "a parting salvo at [...] ", [...] "Negative Creep" [...] was written by Cobain about himself. According to Sandford, [...] "About a Girl" [...] has a [...] "chiming melody and ironic chorus". In Sounds magazine, Keith Cameron said the song [...] "was exhilarating and it was exciting {{because that was the}} nature of the music, but there was also an almost palpable sense of danger, that <b>this</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> could fall apart any second. There was never any relaxation from the first note to the last". In his book Nirvana: The Stories Behind Every Song, Chuck Crisafulli writes that the song [...] "stands out in the Cobain canon as a song with a very specific genesis and a very real subject".|$|E
500|$|... "Cool" [...] was {{originally}} written by Dallas Austin {{after listening to}} Stefani's group No Doubt's song [...] "Underneath It All" [...] (2002).

Stefani commented, [...] "When he told me about the track and where it came from for him, it just triggered something in me." [...] The lyrics of [...] "Cool" [...] reflect Stefani's former relationship with No Doubt bassist Tony Kanal. Although their romantic relationship ended, the lyrics portray Stefani's attitude that it is [...] "cool" [...] that they still remain very good friends. Stefani and Kanal's relationship had provided the inspiration for No Doubt's [...] "Don't Speak" [...] (1996), and while [...] "Cool" [...] presents an amicable friendship between former lovers, [...] "Don't Speak" [...] is about a failing relationship and never arrives at a solution for the couple. Stefani said that she had never intended to include [...] "personal" [...] material on Love. Angel. Music. Baby., and commented, [...] "but no matter what you do, things just come out. It just ended <b>this</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> for me in my head, and it puts an end to a chapter in a really nice way."

500|$|Principal {{photography}} {{took place}} in Vancouver, British Columbia in April 2009, and lasted for approximately 67 days. Many filming locations were established in Downtown Vancouver and its surroundings. Stage shooting for the film {{took place at the}} Canadian Motion Picture Park studio in Burnaby, an adjacent city that forms part of Metro Vancouver. Kosinski devised and constructed twelve to fifteen of the film's sets, including Kevin Flynn's safe house, a creation he illustrated on a napkin for a visual effects test. [...] "I wanted to build as much as possible. It was important to me that this world feel real, and anytime I could build something I did.

[...] The film was shot in dual camera 3D using Pace Fusion rigs like James Cameron's Avatar, but unlike the Sony F950 cameras on that film, Tron used the F35s. [...] "The benefit of ," [...] according to director Kosinski, [...] "is that it has a full 35mm sensor which gives you that beautiful cinematic shallow depth of field."

Digital Domain was contracted to work on the visual effects, while companies such as Prime Focus Group, DD Vancouver, and Mr. X were brought on to collaborate with producer on the post-production junctures of Tron: Legacy.

500|$|Shortly {{after the}} release of The Incredible Hulk, Gale Anne Hurd commented on the {{uncertainty}} of its relationship with Ang Lee's Hulk film. [...] "We couldn't quite figure out how to term this ... It's kind of a reboot and it's kind of sequel." [...] Hurd said that [...] "requel", a portmanteau of [...] "reboot" [...] and [...] "sequel", was a [...] "perfect" [...] description for the film. Norton explained his decision to ignore Lee's origin story: [...] "I don't even like the phrase 'origin story', and I don't think in great literature and great films that explaining the roots of the story doesn't mean it comes in the beginning." [...] "Audiences know this story," [...] he added, [...] " [...] deal with it artfully." [...] He wanted to [...] "have revelations even in the third act about what set <b>this</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> in motion". The new origin story references Ultimate Marvel's take on the Hulk, which also had him created in an attempt to make super soldiers. Norton removed Rick Jones and toned down S.H.I.E.L.D.'s presence. He also added the scene where Banner attempts to extract a cure from a flower and his e-mailing with Samuel Sterns, which references Bruce Jones' story. Norton rewrote scenes every day. Ultimately, the Writers Guild of America decided to credit the script solely to Penn, who argued Norton had not dramatically changed his script. Journalist Anne Thompson explained [...] "The Guild tends to favor plot, structure and pre-existing characters over dialogue." [...] Penn said in 2008, [...] "I wasn't happy with [...] coming to Comic-Con saying that he wrote the script." [...] Before either Penn and Norton joined the project, an anonymous screenwriter wrote a draft and lobbied for credit.|$|E
