40|$|Change or action {{theories}} provide frameworks {{that guide}} {{the development of}} interventions, translate concepts to messages and strategies, and form a basis for evaluation. Abstract: Over the past few decades, researchers have been developing <b>and</b> refining psychological <b>theories</b> <b>and</b> models to provide solid behav-ioral frameworks for evidence-based research. Each year new <b>theories</b> <b>and</b> models are created; however, a select few appear to have withstood {{the test of time}} and continue to be frequently utilized in present-day research. The objectives of this review are to highlight these psychological <b>theories</b> <b>and</b> models and describe their application to vari-ous public health issues and behaviors. Descriptions and example applica-tions of the following <b>theories</b> <b>and</b> mod-els are described in this review: health belief model, theory of reasoned action/ planned behavior, social cognitive the-ory, transtheoretical model, and socio-ecological model...|$|R

Additionally, non-Indigenous authors are also writing messages of encouragement and support for Indigenous <b>theories</b> <b>and</b> pedagogies and highlight ways for non-Indigenous practitioners/teachers to reframe a worldview that incorporates Indigenous worldviews in a “good and respectful way”...|$|R
