25|$|Daedalus {{marked a}} drastic design {{change from the}} team's {{previous}} solar cars. Designed for the new cruiser class in the World Solar Challenge, it was the team's first two-seater car {{with an emphasis on}} practicality. The team overcame electrical problems to be in the minority of teams to finish the race without <b>trailering.</b> Daedalus also marked a permanent switch from three-wheeled to four-wheeled solar cars.|$|E
25|$|Eos I {{continues}} the team's focus on more practical multi-occupant solar cars. It differs from Daedalus {{in that the}} occupants are {{on either side of}} the catamaran shell with door on the sides instead of a canopy on top. Eos finished BWSC 2015 without <b>trailering</b> despite a more challenging scoring formula and regulations. In 2016, Eos I became the first Cruiser car to ever compete in the American Solar Challenge.|$|E
25|$|The J/24 is {{no longer}} {{considered}} the most modern sailboat in its class, {{but it is still}} a very popular sailboat among keelboat racers. While some of the world's best J/24 sailors have the latest version J/24, a well-prepared 1977 model, built to the same shape and weight with rigid end-grained balsa core construction can still win sailing the class world championship even after 30,000+ miles of <b>trailering.</b> This {{is one of the many}} advantages of One-Design sailing that the J/24 is benefitting from.|$|E

Smaller <b>trailers</b> may not contain <b>trailer</b> brakes (for example; basic 4'x8' utility <b>trailers).</b> It is highly recommended that, if the total <b>trailer</b> weight is over a couple thousand pounds, the <b>trailer</b> {{have some sort of}} braking system, and the tow vehicle be equipped with a brake controller.|$|R

25|$|The {{prototype}} first flew on July 11, 1963 and featured folding wings for <b>trailering</b> {{and ease}} of storage. Bede formed a company, Bede Aviation Corporation, based in Cleveland Ohio, to produce the aircraft, but the BD-1 never entered production as a certified aircraft. At that time the FAA was hesitant to certify a light aircraft with folding wings. The certification process was complex and expensive and disagreements arose between Bede and the other shareholders. As a result, Bede was ousted by his business partners and the company renamed American Aviation.|$|E

50|$|The basic {{function}} of a <b>trailer</b> jack is to lift the <b>trailer</b> to a height that allows the <b>trailer</b> to be hitched or unhitched {{to and from the}} towing vehicle. <b>Trailer</b> jacks are also used for leveling the <b>trailer</b> during storage. The most common types of <b>trailer</b> jacks are A-frame jacks, swivel jacks, and drop-leg jacks. Some <b>trailers,</b> such as horse <b>trailers,</b> have a built-in jack at the tongue for this purpose.|$|R

2500|$|Station wagon {{models for}} 1970 were offered {{initially}} {{in three different}} levels: the Fairlane 500 wagon, the Torino wagon, and the Torino Squire wagon. Mid-year 1970, the Falcon wagon became the new base station wagon. The sheetmetal on the station wagons was not changed as drastically as 2-door and 4-door models. The majority of the sheetmetal behind the front doors was carried over from the 1968-69 body style. As a result, the wagons appeared more upright and square than the sedans and coupes. The Torino Squire was the top level wagon and it featured simulated woodgrain sides, headlamp covers and a trim level similar to the Torino Brougham sedan. The Squire came standard with a 302-2V V8 engine, as well as power front disc brakes; other wagons had 4-wheel drums and the 250 CID I-6. All wagons still featured Ford's [...] "Magic Doorgate" [...] two-way tailgate, while the power rear window, rear-facing third seat and roof rack remained options. Ford offered a <b>trailering</b> towing package for all Torinos that would allow Torino to have a Class II tow rating (...) [...] This package included heavy-duty suspension, heavy-duty battery and alternator, extra cooling package, and power front disc brakes. The [...] or [...] engine, power steering and the Cruise-O-Matic transmission were required options.|$|E
