5|$|Metroid Prime: Samus {{receives}} a distress signal {{in her new}} ship and travels to Tallon IV to stop the Space Pirates from exploiting a powerful radioactive substance known as Phazon. She discovers that the Chozo once settled on this planet, and their disappearance, {{as well as the}} emergence of Phazon, is due to a meteor impacting the planet decades ago. After ruining a Space Pirate mining operation and collecting the twelve Chozo Artifacts that allow access to the sealed impact crater, she confronts and defeats Ridley before delving deeper into the impact site and discovering Metroid Prime, a matured Metroid, mutated and corrupted by Phazon. Metroid Prime had been feeding off the Phazon Core of the meteor to increase in size and strength. During the final battle against Metroid Prime, Metroid Prime grabs and takes Samus's Phazon Suit from her. She flees the impact site and after the credits, there is a glimpse of a dark hand coming out of a pool of Phazon in the arena where Samus and Metroid Prime fought. It is implied that <b>this</b> <b>hand</b> is Dark Samus in the future games and that Metroid Prime by taking Samus's suit becomes Dark Samus. It was released on the GameCube and is the first of the Metroid Prime Trilogy.|$|E

A two-hour long procession of tanks, armored cars, field guns, and lorries full of troops went through the city and surrounded it. At 9:00pm a wave of detentions began. The detainees were taken to Ławica airport, where they were subjected to brutal interrogation; 746persons were detained until August8. The protests continued until June30, when the troops finally pacified the city, after exchanging fire with some violent demonstrators.

500|$|The gada {{appears as}} an {{attribute}} in the oldest known sculpture of Vishnu (from Malhar, Madhya Pradesh), dated to c. 200 BCE. One {{of the earliest}} images of Vishnu date to the Kushan period (30–375 CE) found around Mathura, the gada {{does not appear in}} a stylised design as in later depictions, but the mace is a simple [...] "round top-heavy rod" [...] held in his upper (back) right hand and lifted above the shoulders. In another Kushan sculpture, the gada is depicted as a long rod which is almost the height of Vishnu and is held in his upper right hand. It is depicted similar to a long pestle (musala). A similar image found in Jhusi as well as early images from Western India depict Vishnu resting his upper right hand on the mace or holding the mace in <b>this</b> <b>hand.</b> Gupta images continue the trend of having upper (back) right hand resting on or holding the gada. The gada started being depicted in other arms. Twenty-four configurations of Vishnu images are noted, where the order of the four attributes is changed.|$|E
500|$|Although Oswald {{could be}} {{interpreted}} as a martyr for his death in battle, Bede puts a clear emphasis on Oswald being saintly as a king. Bede does not focus on his martyrdom as being primary to his sainthoodindeed, it has been noted that Bede never uses the word [...] "martyr" [...] in reference to Oswald. Bede's portrayal of Oswald stands out as unusual as a king regarded as saintly for his life while ruling, in contrast to a king who gives up the kingship in favour of religious life, or who is venerated because of the manner of his death. Bede recounts Oswald's generosity to the poor and to strangers, and tells a story highlighting this characteristic: on one occasion, at Easter, Oswald was sitting at dinner with Aidan, and had [...] "a silver dish full of dainties before him", when a servant, whom Oswald [...] "had appointed to relieve the poor", came in and told Oswald that a crowd of the poor were in the streets begging alms from the king. Oswald, according to Bede, then immediately had his food given to the poor and even had the dish broken up and distributed. Aidan was greatly impressed and seized Oswald's right hand, stating: [...] "May <b>this</b> <b>hand</b> never perish." [...] Accordingly, Bede reports that the hand and arm remained uncorrupted after Oswald's death.|$|E

500|$|In {{the main}} event, Cada was the tournament chip leader after day 1C, {{which was the}} third of the four opening day sessions, but he began the final table with the fifth largest chipstack. In the 122nd final table hand Cada's stack was reduced to 2,275,000—enough for only four big blinds and about 1.2% of the {{combined}} total stack at play—due to calling Jeff Shulman's [...] "all in" [...] pre-flop with [...] against [...] No community cards hit either player, and Shulman was rewarded by his better high card.

By the time the field was reduced to two players he had 135 million chips to 58 million for Darvin Moon. During the final heads-up duel, Cada surrendered the chip lead, but he eventually climbed back to 120.1 million before the last hand of the heads-up with Moon.
