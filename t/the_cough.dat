5|$|A cold usually {{begins with}} fatigue, {{a feeling of}} being chilled, sneezing, and a headache, {{followed}} {{in a couple of days}} by a runny nose and cough. Symptoms may begin within sixteen hours of exposure and typically peak two to four days after onset. They usually resolve in seven to ten days, but some can last for up to three weeks. The average duration of cough is eighteen days and in some cases people develop a post-viral cough which can linger after the infection is gone. In children, <b>the</b> <b>cough</b> lasts for more than ten days in 35–40% of cases and continues for more than 25 days in 10%.|$|E
5|$|The typical {{symptoms}} of a cold include a cough, a runny nose, nasal congestion and a sore throat, sometimes accompanied by muscle ache, fatigue, headache, and loss of appetite. A sore throat is present in about 40% of cases and a cough in about 50%, while muscle ache occurs in about half. In adults, a fever is generally not present but it is common in infants and young children. <b>The</b> <b>cough</b> is usually mild compared to that accompanying influenza. While a cough and a fever indicate a higher likelihood of influenza in adults, {{a great deal of}} similarity exists between these two conditions. A number of the viruses that cause the common cold may also result in asymptomatic infections.|$|E

25|$|Acute bronchitis, {{also known}} as a chest cold, is short term {{inflammation}} of the bronchi of the lungs. The most common symptom is a cough. Other symptoms include coughing up mucus, wheezing, shortness of breath, fever, and chest discomfort. The infection may last from a few to ten days. <b>The</b> <b>cough</b> may persist for several weeks afterwards with the total duration of symptoms usually around three weeks. Some have symptoms for up to six weeks.|$|E

This initiates an attempt to try to dislodge the food or liquid from the windpipe.|$|E
25|$|The classic {{symptoms}} of pertussis are a paroxysmal cough, inspiratory whoop, and fainting, or vomiting after coughing. <b>The</b> <b>cough</b> from pertussis {{has been documented}} to cause subconjunctival hemorrhages, rib fractures, urinary incontinence, hernias, and vertebral artery dissection. Violent coughing can cause the pleura to rupture, leading to a pneumothorax. Vomiting after a coughing spell or an inspiratory whooping sound on coughing, almost doubles {{the likelihood that the}} illness is pertussis. The absence of a paroxysmal cough or posttussive emesis, though, makes it almost half as likely.|$|E
25|$|Sinusitis, {{also known}} as a sinus {{infection}} or rhinosinusitis, is inflammation of the sinuses resulting in symptoms. Common signs and symptoms include thick nasal mucus, a plugged nose, and pain in the face. Other signs and symptoms may include fever, headaches, poor sense of smell, sore throat, and cough. <b>The</b> <b>cough</b> is often worse at night. Serious complications are rare. It is defined as acute rhinosinusitis (ARS) if it lasts less than 4 weeks, and as chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) if it lasts for more than 12 weeks.|$|E

25|$|Pertussis {{is caused}} by the {{bacterium}} Bordetella pertussis. It is an airborne disease which spreads easily through <b>the</b> <b>coughs</b> and sneezes of an infected person. People are infectious to others from the start of symptoms until about three weeks into <b>the</b> <b>coughing</b> fits. Those treated with antibiotics are no longer infectious after five days. Diagnosis is by collecting a sample {{from the back of the}} nose and throat. This sample can then be tested by either culture or by polymerase chain reaction.|$|R
25|$|Chronic {{bronchitis}} {{is defined}} as a productive cough that lasts for three months or more per year for at least two years. Most people with chronic bronchitis have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Protracted bacterial bronchitis {{is defined as}} a chronic productive cough with a positive bronchoalveolar lavage that resolves with antibiotics. Symptoms of chronic bronchitis may include wheezing and shortness of breath, especially upon exertion and low oxygen saturations. <b>The</b> <b>cough</b> is often worse soon after awakening and the sputum produced may have a yellow or green color and may be streaked with specks of blood.|$|E
25|$|Bubonic plague is an {{infection}} of the lymphatic system, usually resulting from the bite of an infected flea, Xenopsylla cheopis (the rat flea). In very rare circumstances, as in the septicemic plague, the disease can be transmitted by direct contact with infected tissue or exposure to <b>the</b> <b>cough</b> of another human. The flea is parasitic on house and field rats, and seeks out other prey when its rodent hosts die. The bacteria remain harmless to the flea, allowing the new host to spread the bacteria. The bacteria form aggregates in the gut of infected fleas and this results in the flea regurgitating ingested blood, which is now infected, into the bite site of a rodent or human host. Once established, bacteria rapidly spread to the lymph nodes and multiply.|$|E
25|$|Prevention {{is mainly}} by {{vaccination}} with the pertussis vaccine. Initial immunization is recommended between six and eight weeks of age, with four doses {{to be given}} {{in the first two}} years of life. The vaccine becomes less effective over time, with additional doses often recommended for older children and adults. Antibiotics may be used to prevent the disease in those who have been exposed and are at risk of severe disease. In those with the disease, antibiotics are useful if started within three weeks of the initial symptoms, but otherwise have little effect in most people. In children less than one year old and among those who are pregnant, they are recommended within six weeks of symptom onset. Antibiotics used include erythromycin, azithromycin, clarithromycin, or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Evidence to support interventions, other than antibiotics, for <b>the</b> <b>cough</b> is poor. Many children less than a year of age require hospitalization.|$|E

My best record was set in New York, where I played 18 variations. However, I {{hope that you will}} play all of them, and won't [...] "cough".|$|R
25|$|By 1849, Njegoš began {{experiencing}} an incessant {{cough and}} soon a doctor from Kotor {{discovered that he}} had tuberculosis. By early 1850, {{it was clear that}} the condition was life-threatening. Painfully aware that Montenegro did not have a single trained physician, he travelled to Kotor in the spring and composed his last will and testament, intending for it to prevent the power struggle that had preceded his own accession to the position of vladika. He mailed the will to vice-consul Gagić in Dubrovnik with a message asking him to return the document unopened in the event that he regained his health. Njegoš then headed to Venice and Padova, where he spent much time resting and seemingly succeeded in containing his illness. His cough returned after eight days; he left Padova and went back to Montenegro in the hope that the country's fresh mountain air would alleviate his symptoms. He spent the summer of 1850 resting and writing poetry. His condition prevented him from lying down, so he had to keep in a constant upright position, even when sleeping. By November 1850, <b>the</b> <b>cough</b> abated and Njegoš undertook another journey to Italy. He reached Italy in January 1851, and travelled through Venice, Milan, Genoa and Rome. He visited the ruins of Pompeii with Serbian writer Ljubomir Nenadović, and the two men travelled together along Italy's western coast discussing philosophy and contemporary politics. The journey was documented in a book Nenadović published following Njegoš's death, titled Letters from Italy.|$|E
500|$|Influenza, {{commonly}} known as [...] "the flu", is an infectious disease caused by an influenza virus. Symptoms can be mild to severe. The most common symptoms include: a high fever, runny nose, sore throat, muscle pains, headache, coughing, and feeling tired. These symptoms typically begin two days after exposure to the virus and most last less than a week. <b>The</b> <b>cough,</b> however, may last {{for more than two}} weeks. In children, there may be nausea and vomiting, but these are not common in adults. Nausea and vomiting occur more commonly in the unrelated infection gastroenteritis, which is sometimes inaccurately referred to as [...] "stomach flu" [...] or [...] "24-hour flu". Complications of influenza may include viral pneumonia, secondary bacterial pneumonia, sinus infections, and worsening of previous health problems such as asthma or heart failure.|$|E
500|$|A chronic cough {{is often}} the first symptom to develop. When it {{persists}} {{for more than three}} months each year for at least two years, in combination with sputum production and without another explanation, there is by definition chronic bronchitis. This condition can occur before COPD fully develops. The amount of sputum produced can change over hours to days. In some cases, <b>the</b> <b>cough</b> may not be present or may only occur occasionally and may not be productive. Some people with COPD attribute the symptoms to a [...] "smoker's cough". Sputum may be swallowed or spat out, depending often on social and cultural factors. Vigorous coughing may lead to rib fractures or a brief loss of consciousness. Those with COPD often have a history of [...] "common colds" [...] that last a long time.|$|E

500|$|Formby was {{the first}} comic to use a delayed {{entrance}} as a joke to make the audience laugh before he arrived: his orchestra played his entrance music, and then he failed to appear on stage. His act included songs, described by Smart and Bothway Howard as [...] "characteristically simple, some with tunes derived from Methodist hymns, and with catchy choruses", and he would chat to the orchestra conductor and front rows, punctuating his stage patter—delivered in a deadpan style—with his cough. He used his health—particularly the coughing—as part of his act, and would {{say that he was}} [...] "Coughin' well tonight!" [...] He also created the phrase [...] "It's not <b>the</b> <b>cough</b> that carries you off – it's the coffin they carries you off in!" [...] One of Formby's nicknames, [...] "The Wigan Nightingale" [...] was coined {{because of the way he}} used his bronchial cough in his act.|$|E
500|$|For {{people whose}} {{injuries}} are {{high enough to}} interfere with breathing, there is great emphasis on airway clearance during this stage of recovery. Weakness of respiratory muscles impairs the ability to cough effectively, allowing secretions to accumulate within the lungs. [...] As SCI patients suffer from reduced total lung capacity and tidal volume, physical therapists teach them accessory breathing techniques (e.g. apical breathing, glossopharyngeal breathing) that typically are not taught to healthy individuals. [...] Physical therapy treatment for airway clearance may include manual percussions and vibrations, postural drainage, respiratory muscle training, and assisted cough techniques. Patients are taught to increase their intra-abdominal pressure by leaning forward to induce cough and clear mild secretions. The quad cough technique is done lying on the back with the therapist applying pressure on the abdomen in the rhythm of <b>the</b> <b>cough</b> to maximize expiratory flow and mobilize secretions. Manual abdominal compression is another technique used to increase expiratory flow which later improves coughing. Other techniques used to manage respiratory dysfunction [...] include respiratory muscle pacing, use of a constricting abdominal binder, ventilator-assisted speech, and mechanical ventilation.|$|E
500|$|George Formby {{was born}} George Hoy Booth at 3 Westminster Street, Wigan, Lancashire, on 26 May 1904. He was {{the eldest of}} seven {{surviving}} children born to James Lawler Booth and his wife Eliza, [...] Hoy, although this marriage was bigamous because Formby Sr was still married to his first wife, Martha Maria Salter, a twenty-year-old music hall performer. Booth was a successful music hall comedian and singer who performed under the name George Formby (he {{is now known as}} George Formby Sr). Formby Sr suffered from a chest ailment, identified variously as bronchitis, asthma or tuberculosis, and would use <b>the</b> <b>cough</b> as part of the humour in his act, saying to the audience, [...] "Bronchitis, I'm a bit tight tonight", or [...] "coughing better tonight". One of his main characters was that of John Willie, an [...] "archetypal Lancashire lad". In 1906 Formby Sr was earning £35 a week at the music halls, which rose to £325 a week by 1920, and Formby grew up in an affluent home. Formby Sr was so popular that Marie Lloyd, the influential music hall singer and actress, would only watch two acts: his and that of Dan Leno.|$|E
