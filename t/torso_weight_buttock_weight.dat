40|$|Abstract — This study {{investigated}} the teratogerucity of ethanol in several different strains of chickens. The chick embryo provides a useful model for studying the fetal alcohol syndrome. Two broad classifications of chicks, each containing many strains, arc commercially available for use: broilers and layers. Teratogenicity of ethanol in broilers and layers was studied by examining three different parameters: embryo <b>weight,</b> ratio of <b>torso</b> <b>weight</b> to head weight, and embryo viability. Broilers and layers experienced similar ethanol-induced reductions in embryo weight. Broiler embryos experienced a preferential ethanol-induced suppression of head growth. Differences in viability between different strains were found, but no clear pattern between broilers or layers could be determined, possibly due to environmental conditions. The data presented here suggest that the strain of chick and {{the handling of the}} eggs are important considerations when studying the teratogenicity of ethanol. An ethanol dose-response test should be periodically performed as a check on environmental conditions affecting the eggs — conditions that are beyond the control of the researcher...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{review the}} {{literature}} {{to determine which}} interventions available in the inpatient rehabilitation setting are efficacious for increasing standing balance in patients with multiple sclerosis. Case Description: Virginia (first name has {{been changed to protect}} patient’s privacy) is a 71 -year-old woman with a long standing history of multiple sclerosis, who sustained an acute right elbow fracture due to a recent fall at home. Following a surgical repair, she was admitted to an inpatient rehabilitation facility. Her goals were to regain independent functional mobility while maintaining non-weight bearing restrictions through her right arm. Outcomes: Virginia did not progress to independent ambulation. After two weeks she was discharged to a skilled nursing facility. Discussion: A variety of interventions are available and should be implemented when attempting to improve balance in a patient with multiple sclerosis. These interventions often include <b>torso</b> <b>weighting,</b> resistive exercise, neuromuscular re-education, and core strengthening. In less medically complex subjects than Virginia, the above stated interventions have proven effective, low-risk and easily replicable within an inpatient rehabilitation setting...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: During long-duration spaceflight, astronauts {{experience}} progressive muscle atrophy {{and often}} perform strenuous extravehicular activities. Post-flight, {{there is a}} lengthy recovery period with an increased risk for injury. Currently, there is a critical need for an enabling tool to optimize muscle performance and {{to minimize the risk}} of injury to astronauts while on-orbit and during post-flight recovery. Consequently, these studies were performed to develop a method to address this need. METHODS: Eight test subjects performed a repetitive dynamic exercise to failure at 65 % of their upper <b>torso</b> <b>weight</b> using a Lordex spinal machine. Surface electromyography (SEMG) data was collected from the erector spinae back muscle. The SEMG data was evaluated using a 5 th order autoregressive (AR) model and linear regression analysis. RESULTS: The best predictor found was an AR parameter, the mean average magnitude of AR poles, with r = 0. 75 and p = 0. 03. This parameter can predict performance to failure as early as the second repetition of the exercise. CONCLUSION: A method for predicting human muscle performance early during dynamic repetitive exercise was developed. The capability to predict performance to failure has many potential applications to the space program including evaluating countermeasure effectiveness on-orbit, optimizing post-flight recovery, and potential future real-time monitoring capability during extravehicular activity...|$|R

Although exercise therapies have shown that strengthening the multifidus produces reductions in low back pain, the quantification of the LMs role is undetermined. The goal of this in vitro study was {{to test the hypothesis}} that LM atrophy significantly reduces lumbar lordosis for spines in the upright posture. The paraspinal muscles of six fresh human thoracolumbar spine (T 12 -pelvis) were surgically removed, leaving the spinal segments intact. The T 12 level was fixed to a torso plate that facilitated anatomically appropriate trunk muscle attachment and dead <b>weight</b> simulation of <b>torso</b> <b>weight</b> (245 N). The pelvis was attached to a custom fixture that allowed pelvic tilt adjustment to the appropriate value for upright stance. In this experiment, three muscle groups were simulated using steel cables: the deep LM, erector spinae (ES), and rectus abdominus (RA). These cables were inserted at anatomically appropriate vertebral sites and were routed directly to digitally controlled torque motors. A total of five loading cases were investigated for three sets of experiments: neutral posture, axial rotation, and flexion/extension stability perturbation. Results indicated a small change in lumbar lordosis for L 4 /L 5 motion segment for atrophy while in the neutral posture. The data highlights how variations in muscle activation patterns alter lumbar lordosis and tissue stress distribution...|$|R

40|$|AbstractGait {{and balance}} {{disorders}} are often major causes of handicap {{in patients with}} cerebellar ataxia. Although {{it was thought that}} postural and balance disorders in cerebellar ataxia were not treatable, recent studies have demonstrated the beneficial effects of rehabilitation programs. This article is the first systematic review on the treatment of postural disorders in cerebellar ataxia. Nineteen articles were selected, of which three were randomized, controlled trials. Various aetiologies of cerebellar ataxia were studied: five studies assessed patients with multiple sclerosis, four assessed patients with degenerative ataxia, two assessed stroke patients and eight assessed patients with various aetiologies. Accurate assessment of postural disorders in cerebellar ataxia is very important in both clinical trials and clinical practice. The Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA) is a simple, validated measurement tool, for which 18 of the 40 points are related to postural disorders. This scale is useful for monitoring ataxic patients with postural disorders. There is now moderate level evidence that rehabilitation is efficient to improve postural capacities of patients with cerebellar ataxia – particularly in patients with degenerative ataxia or multiple sclerosis. Intensive rehabilitation programs with balance and coordination exercises are necessary. Although techniques such as virtual reality, biofeedback, treadmill exercises with supported bodyweight and <b>torso</b> <b>weighting</b> appear to be of value, their specific efficacy has to be further investigated. Drugs have only been studied in degenerative ataxia, and the level of evidence is low.

40|$|Recent {{research}} into the mechanics of walking indicates that a quasi passive wearable device could be created which dramatically reduces the metabolic energy used in walking especially when the wearer is carrying additional <b>torso</b> <b>weight.</b> Target population groups include military personnel who must carry heavy battle packs and body armor, hikers, letter carriers, and the quasi disabled. This latter group includes a significant fraction of the elderly who have reduced leg strength and/or higher <b>weight</b> <b>torsos.</b> The device is called PUUMA, an acronym for Personal Unpowered Universal Mobility Assistant. Though walking has been studied extensively, {{there appears to be}} a limited understanding of the interplay between the kinetic and potential energy of the torso when driven by legs that can store and release energy. This thesis introduces a simplified model which enables simulation of the entire walking process including the epoch following heel strike. One simulation goal was to explore the knee spring properties which enable lossless walking. Simulations show that there are two knee spring configurations which allow for lossless walking. It is also shown that the percentage of kinetic energy transferred to a knee spring can be a significant fraction of the torso kinetic energy. (cont.) PIJUMA's basic idea is the incorporation of torsion springs at the knee joints which absorb torso kinetic energy following heel strike and then release that stored energy later in the step. An application of the capstan effect is introduced which enables a practical implementation of two knee spring configurations. In particular, the design allows the thigh and shank to be dynamically coupled to a microprocessor controlled knee spring thereby allowing both unimpeded leg swing and kinetic energy transfer to the knee spring. Another use of the capstan effect is introduced which allows for a microprocessor controlled brake that can freeze the knee at its maximum torsion and then release it later in the walking cycle. A design is shown which embodies the architectural ideas created. Several of the key components were designed, prototyped and tested. by Matthew R. Carvey. Thesis (S. B.)

40|$|Study Design. Biomechanical analysis. Objective. To {{investigate}} {{the relationship between}} gravity-induced torques acting on the scoliotic spine and rotation within the vertebrae. Summary of Background Data. Vertebral rotation is {{an important aspect of}} spinal deformity in idiopathic scoliosis, associated with ribcage asymmetry. Although both lateral curvature and rotation seem to increase together in progressive scoliosis, the mechanisms driving vertebral rotation are not clearly established and it is not known whether lateral curvature precedes rotation, or vice versa. Methods. Three-dimensional spinal curvature was measured for a small group of idiopathic scoliosis patients using standing radiographs, and equations of static equilibrium were used to calculate gravity-induced torque profiles along the length of each spine because of head, neck, and <b>torso</b> <b>weight.</b> Vertebral rotations were then measured for the same patients using Aaro and Dahlborn's technique with reformatted computed tomography images. The gravity-induced torque curves were compared with rotation measurements to see whether gravity-induced torque is a likely contributor to intravertebral rotation in scoliosis. Results. Gravity-induced torques as high as 7. 5 Nm act on the spines of idiopathic scoliosis patients because of body weight in the standing position, and maximum intravertebral rotations (for a single vertebra) are approximately 4 degrees. There is a statistically significant relationship between gravity-induced torque and intravertebral rotation in the scoliotic spine. Conclusion. Gravity-induced torque is a likely cause of intravertebral rotation in progressive idiopathic scoliosis. Because the spine must be curved in 3 -dimensions (out of plane) to produce such torques, vertebral rotation would be expected to occur subsequent to an initial lateral deviation, suggesting that lateral curvature precedes vertebral rotation in progressive idiopathic scoliosis...|$|R
5000|$|The {{buttocks}} (singular: buttock) are two rounded {{portions of}} the anatomy, located on the posterior of the pelvic region of primates (including humans), and many other bipeds or quadrupeds, and comprise a layer of fat superimposed on the gluteus maximus and gluteus medius muscles. Physiologically, the <b>buttocks</b> enable <b>weight</b> to {{be taken off the}} feet while sitting. In many cultures, they play a role in sexual attraction. Many cultures have also used the buttocks as a primary target for corporal punishment, as the buttocks' layer of subcutaneous fat offers protection against injury while still allowing for the infliction of pain.

Unfortunately, unstable surface {{training is}} risky and leads to detraining. Purpose: The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine core muscle activation during stable surface ground-based lifts. Methods: Fourteen recreational trained and former NCAA DI athletes (weight 84. 2 ± 13. 3 kg; height 176. 0 ± 9. 5 cm; age 20. 9 ± 2. 0 years) volunteered for participation. Subjects completed two ground-based lifts: overhead press and push-press. Surface EMG was recorded from 4 muscles on the right side of the body (Rectus Abdominus (RA), External Oblique (EO), Transverse Abdominus (TA), and Erector Spinae (ES). Results: Paired sample T-tests identified significant muscle activation differences between the overhead press and the push-press included ES and EO. Average and peak EMG for ES was significantly greater in push-press (P< 0. 01). Anterior displacement of COP was significantly greater in push-press compared to overhead press during the eccentric phase.

40|$|The {{design of}} child {{restraints}} is guided {{in part by}} data on {{the size and shape}} of child occupants. This study presents for the first time statistical body shape models for children weighing 9 to 27 kg (20 to 60 lb) in a seated posture relevant to child restraint design. A laboratory study was conducted with 47 child participants, ages 12 to 48 months. Standard anthropometric dimensions were taken and whole-body surface scans were conducted in a range of postures. A three- dimensional coordinate measurement system was used to record body landmarks. The body surface data were analyzed using novel template fitting methods to obtain homologous meshes for each participant in a standardized seated posture. Data from the current study were combined with data from a preceding study to obtain body scans from 68 children. Principal component analysis and regression were used to develop a statistical body shape model (SBSM). The SBSM was exercised to create 18 manikins representing children with long and short <b>torsos</b> at body <b>weights</b> ranging from 20 to 60 lb.

40|$|This {{paper is}} closed access. Background: We analyse the NHANES III sample {{to assess the}} {{suitability}} of measured stature and sitting height to estimate leg length (tibia + femur) and predict fatness. High rates of overweight in the United States population may lead to greater gluteo-femoral fat mass which will increase sitting height and artificially decrease estimates of both absolute and relative leg length. Methods: The analyses include 3076 women and 3233 men, 20. 0 - 49. 9 years of age of White, Black or Mexican-American ethnicity. The poverty index ratio, measured stature, sitting height, upper leg length, <b>weight,</b> four skinfolds, <b>buttocks</b> circumference and elbow, biacromial and biiliac breadths were extracted from the database. The sitting height ratio, % body fatness, % upper leg length (ULL/stature), and other indices were estimated. Correlation and principle component analysis {{were used to assess}} the relationship between measures of body fatness, relative leg length and the other variables. Results: For adults in the NHANES III %body fat is more strongly correlated with buttocks circumference (r = 0. 87 and 0. 78 for women and men), than with any measure of estimated leg length (r's range from - 0. 28 to - 0. 10 for both sexes). Principle components analysis separates fatness, stature and estimated leg length into uncorrelated factors for this sample. Conclusion: Reports of a negative association between leg length and fatness for adults of the NHANES III are likely spurious, due to greater gluteo-femoral fat thickness increasing sitting height. Future rounds of the NHANES, and similar surveys in other nations with high body fat populations, should measure lower extremity length directly to better assess its relationship to health and disease risk. © The Author 2008; all rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Postpartom {{hemorrhage}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} major problems that threaten the mothers' health and is regarded as one of the most important reasons for mortality specially in the developing countries. So far, many studies have been conducted in regard to effectiveness of chemical and herbal medicine on decrease of Postpartom hemorrhage. This study aimed to investigate effectiveness of date (Rutab) on postpartum hemorrhage. Methods: This is a clinical trial study in which 94 subjects, having the adequate criteria for the research, were selected in Shahid Sadoughi Hospital. The participants were divided into two groups. In the first group, immediately after placenta delivery infusion, 20 unit oxytocin in 1000 ml 5 % dextrose in water with normal salin solution(group 1) were given, whereas in the second group, infusion of 10 unit oxytocin in 1000 ml 5 % dextrose in water with normal salin solution associated with 100 gram date (Rutab) were given and the patients were required to have them in 10 minutes. At the same time a plastic and a cotton sheet were widen under the patients. Blood loss was determined by regular <b>weighting</b> of the <b>buttocks</b> that were previously weighted. The difference was calculated before and after weight (1 gram increase in weight was considered to be equivalent to 1 ml blood). Data were submitted to SPSS software and then analyzed by T-test, Chi-squre, Mann-whitney. Results: The two groups were homogenous in regard to all the variables. The study results indicated that the bleeding mean was 127 / 11 ml at the two hour after delivery in the first group and 68 / 5 ml in the second group. There was a significant difference between postpartum hemorrhages of the two groups Conclusion: Since date(Rutab) was more effective than infusion oxytocin on post partum hemorrhage and no side effect was reported for that, it is recommended that its significance will be prposed to related specialist. Moreover, extra investigations are necessitated for future studies...|$|R
