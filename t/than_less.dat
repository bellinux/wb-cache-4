5|$|Production of lead is {{increasing}} worldwide {{due to its}} use in lead–acid batteries. There are two major categories of production: primary from mined ores, and secondary from scrap. In 2014, 4.58million metric tons came from primary production and 5.64million from secondary production. The top three producers of mined lead concentrate in that year were China, Australia, and the United States. The top three producers of refined lead were China, the United States, and South Korea. According to the International Resource Panel's Metal Stocks in Society report of 2010, {{the total amount of}} lead in use, stockpiled, discarded or dissipated into the environment, on a global basis, is 8kg per capita. Much of this is in more developed countries (20–150kg per capita) rather <b>than</b> <b>less</b> developed ones (1–4kg per capita).|$|E
5|$|Bliege Bird et al. {{observed}} turtle {{hunting and}} spear fishing patterns in a Meriam {{community in the}} Torres Strait of Australia, publishing their findings in 2001. Here, only some Meriam men were able to accumulate high caloric gains {{for the amount of}} time spent turtle hunting or spear fishing (reaching a threshold measured in kcal/h). Since a daily catch of fish is carried home by hand and turtles are frequently served at large feasts, members of the community know which men most reliably brought them turtle meat and fish. Thus, turtle hunting qualifies as a costly signal. Furthermore, turtle hunting and spear fishing are actually less productive (in kcal/h) than foraging for shellfish, where success depends only on the amount of time dedicated to searching, so shellfish foraging is a poor signal of skill or strength. This suggests that energetic gains are not the primary reason men take part in turtle hunting and spear fishing. A follow-up study found that successful Meriam hunters do experience greater social benefits and reproductive success <b>than</b> <b>less</b> skilled hunters.|$|E

40|$|We {{introduce}} the polynomial time version, in short <b>less</b> <b>than</b> or equal to(T) (P) -introreducibility, {{of the notion}} of introreducibility studied in Recursion Theory. We give a simpler proof of the known fact that a set is <b>less</b> <b>than</b> or equal to(T) (P) -introreducible if and only if it is in P. Our proof generalizes to virtually all the computation bounded reducibilities <b>less</b> <b>than</b> or equal to(r), showing that a set is <b>less</b> <b>than</b> or equal to(r) -introreducible if and only if it belongs to the minimum <b>less</b> <b>than</b> or equal to(r) -degree. It also holds for most unbounded reducibilities like <b>less</b> <b>than</b> or equal to(m), <b>less</b> <b>than</b> or equal to(c), <b>less</b> <b>than</b> or equal to(d), <b>less</b> <b>than</b> or equal to(p), <b>less</b> <b>than</b> or equal to(tt), etc., but it does not hold for <b>less</b> <b>than</b> or equal to(T). A very strong way for a set L to fail being <b>less</b> <b>than</b> or equal to(r) -introreducible is that L is not <b>less</b> <b>than</b> or equal to(r) -reducible to any coinfinite subset of L. We call such sets <b>less</b> <b>than</b> or equal to(r) -introimmune. It is known that <b>less</b> <b>than</b> or equal to(T) -introimmune sets exist but they are not arithmetical. In this paper we ask for which reducibilities <b>less</b> <b>than</b> or equal to(r) there exist arithmetical <b>less</b> <b>than</b> or equal to(r) -introimmune sets.

40|$|The {{anaerobic}} threshold during graded exercise (GXT, AT 1) {{was determined}} as the exercise level initiating a curvilinear increase in ventilation (VE), and during prolonged exercise (PXT, 40 min, AT 2) as the maximal exercise level where still a steady state for VE can be reached. Subjects were 8 healthy males, 20 to 53 years of age. Maximal exercise capacity was estimated {{by means of}} 1) VO 2 max 2) max time on bicycle ergometer at 200 Watts and 3) maximal distance run within 12 min (Cooper test). VO 2 max {{was significantly related to}} AT 1, GXT (r = 0. 85, 0. 01 <b>less</b> <b>than</b> p <b>less</b> <b>than</b> 0. 001) and to AT 2, PXT (r = 0. 75, 0. 05 <b>less</b> <b>than</b> p <b>less</b> <b>than</b> 0. 01). Also a significant correlation was found between the endurance exercise capacity (= 200 Watts) and both AT 1 (r = 0. 80; 0. 05 <b>less</b> <b>than</b> p <b>less</b> <b>than</b> 0. 01) and AT 2 (r = 0. 84; 0. 01 <b>less</b> <b>than</b> p <b>less</b> <b>than</b> 0. 001). Finally only AT 2 was significantly correlated with the Cooper test (r = 0. 81; 0. 01 <b>less</b> <b>than</b> p <b>less</b> <b>than</b> 0. 001), no significant relationship was found for AT 1 (r = 0. 68; p <b>less</b> <b>than</b> 0. 05).
