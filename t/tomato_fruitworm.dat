5|$|Helicoverpa zea, {{commonly}} known as the corn earworm, is a species (formerly in the genus Heliothis) in the family Noctuidae. The larva of the moth Helicoverpa zea is a major agricultural pest. Since it is polyphagous (feeds on many different plants) during the larval stage, the species has been given many different common names, including the cotton bollworm and the <b>tomato</b> <b>fruitworm.</b> It also consumes a wide variety of other crops.|$|E
50|$|Archytas apicifer adults feed on flower nectar, and {{are also}} known to be pollinators of some flowers with strong odor. They {{commonly}} pollinate Euonymus kiautschovicus a flowering bush cultivated in North America and native to Japan. Larvae feed on Forest tent caterpillars and fall webworms, other common hosts include the <b>tomato</b> <b>fruitworm,</b> corn earworm, and cutworms. After mating female flies search for potential hosts by sight. They lay their eggs on the hosts underside and later as the eggs hatch the larvae burrow into the host where they quickly begin feeding on tissue, later killing the host.|$|E
50|$|The insecticidal toxin {{from the}} {{bacterium}} Bacillus thuringiensis has been inserted into a tomato plant. When field tested they showed {{resistance to the}} tobacco hornworm (Manduca sexta), <b>tomato</b> <b>fruitworm</b> (Heliothis zea), the tomato pinworm (Keiferia lycopersicella) and the tomato fruit borer (Helicoverpa armigera). A 91-day feeding trial in rats showed no adverse effects, but the Bt tomato has never been commercialised. Tomatoes resistant to a root knot nematode have been created by inserting a cysteine proteinase inhibitor gene from taro. A chemically synthesised ceropin B gene, usually found in the giant silk moth (Hyalophora cecropia), has been introduced into tomato plants and in vivo studies show significant resistance to bacterial wilt and bacterial spot. When the cell wall proteins, polygalacturonase and expansin are prevented from being produced in fruits, they are less susceptible to the fungus Botrytis cinerea than normal tomatoes. Pest resistant tomatoes can reduce the ecological footprint of tomato production {{while at the same}} time increase farm income.|$|E
50|$|Some common tomato pests are stink bugs, cutworms, tomato hornworms {{and tobacco}} hornworms, aphids, cabbage loopers, whiteflies, <b>tomato</b> <b>fruitworms,</b> flea beetles, red spider mite, slugs, and Colorado potato beetles. The tomato russet mite, Aculops lycopersici, feeds on foliage and young fruit of tomato plants, causing shrivelling and {{necrosis}} of leaves, flowers, and fruit, possibly killing the plant.|$|R

40|$|<b>Tomato</b> <b>fruitworm</b> larvae bore {{deeply into}} the fruit and will destroy about 20 % of the {{tomatoes}} in a field. • In the 1930 s the tomato pinworm reduced the California tomato crop by 25 %. • Prior {{to the development of}} effective insecticides, whiteflies caused annual losses of $ 25 million in Florida tomatoes. • Tomato shipments exceeding 2 % insect infestation are rejected by processors. Technical Summary Growers in eighteen states harvest 25 billion pounds of tomatoes with a value of $ 2. 3 billion from 429, 000 acres. Insecticides are used on 95 % of U. S. tomato acres. USDA estimates that without insecticides U. S. production of fresh market tomatoes would decline by 64 % while processing tomato production would decline by 51 % [30].

40|$|In this study, {{we address}} {{the theory behind}} the {{ecological}} functions provided by biodiversity and ecological infra-structures, {{as well as their}} role in enhancing the performance of natural enemies, in agrarian ecosystems. This study focuses on the processing tomato agrarian ecosystem.

40|$|The mass {{application}} of synthetic pesticides can cause severe {{health and environmental}} problems. Therefore, reducing pesticide input {{is a very important}} issue nowadays. One of the solutions for reducing the use of pesticides is using some natural products, such as jasmonic acid (JA), to trigger plant's defense. When plants are wounded by insects, the endogenous JA level increases. Jasmonic acid can transmit the wounding signal and subsequently plants produce some defensive compounds, such as defense proteins, against insect herbivores. Previously researches indicated that exogenous JA on tomato plants could elevate the activities of defense-related proteins, polyphenol oxidase (PPO) and proteinase inhibitor (PI). This induction response would also reduce the performance of some tomato pests. The effect of JA induction on <b>tomato</b> <b>fruitworm</b> (Helicoverpa armigera) and the effect of nutrient on this induction response are not known. The aim {{of this study is to}} know the effect of methyl jasmonic acid (MeJA) and plant's nutrient available levels on tomato's induced resistance, and subsequently on the performance of <b>tomato</b> <b>fruitworm.</b> Tomato plants were grown in different nutrient levels; then MeJA was applied. The results indicated that MeJA treatment would increase the activities of trypsin inhibitor (TI). There is no significant difference on the activity of PPO between MeJA-treated and control plants. In addition, MeJA treatment also increased the quantity of volatiles emission. Results of feeding study revealed that larvae all dead when fed on MeJA-treated leaflets. Results of the short-term feeding study also showed that relative growth rates were negative for larvae fed on MeJA-treated foliage. Adult oviposition, however, there was no difference between the treatments. Finally, we also found that fertilization did not affect the effect of MeJA induction. The induced resistance may have reached its maximum effect with minimum nutrient. In conclusion, the negative effect of MeJA induction on <b>tomato</b> <b>fruitworm</b> may due to the increased activities of trypsin inhibitor. Besides, increased volatiles emission and other unknown factors may also have effects on the reduced preference for MeJA-treated leaves. 當植物受到昆蟲傷害後植物內茉莉酸的量會上升，茉莉酸會傳遞傷害訊息，使植物產生防禦蛋白對抗昆蟲。過去尚未研究過番茄外加茉莉酸對番茄夜蛾 (Helicoverpa armigera) 生長的影響，以及植物營養對誘導防禦反應的效果。因此本實驗想瞭解外加茉莉酸甲酯以及配合不同程度的施肥條件對番茄之誘導防禦反應及對番茄夜蛾生長表現之影響。番茄先經高、低及無施肥三種施肥處理，接著三種施肥處理再各自分為兩大組，分別為茉莉酸甲酯處理組及控制組。實驗結果顯示，茉莉酸甲酯處理之番茄防禦蛋白胰蛋白酶抑制劑活性顯著高於控制組約 3 倍，多酚氧化酵素活性無顯著差異，而揮發物質的量上升。以茉莉酸甲酯處理之番茄葉片餵食四齡番茄夜蛾幼蟲，造成番茄夜蛾死亡，短期實驗發現相對生長速率為負値，但成蟲產卵偏好無顯著差異。另外，施肥處理並不影響茉莉酸甲酯誘導的效果，在無施肥處理防禦反應即達到很好的效果。茉莉酸甲酯處理番茄對番茄夜蛾生長發育有顯著的負面影響，除了可能由於葉片中 trypsin inhibitor 的量升高導致之外，揮發物質的量上升或其他尚未知的因素可能對於降低番茄夜蛾幼蟲對茉莉酸甲酯處理之葉片的偏好也有影響。中文摘要 [...] i 英文摘要 [...] -ii 目次 [...] iⅤ 一、前言 [...] 1 二、材料與方 [...] 6 三、結果 [...] - 13 四、討論 [...] - 16 五、參考文獻 [...] - 21 表 [...] - 30 圖 [...] - 3...|$|E

40|$|Caterpillars produce oral {{secretions}} {{that may}} serve as cues to elicit plant defenses, but in other cases these secretions {{have been shown to}} suppress plant defenses. Ongoing work in our laboratory has focused on the salivary secretions of the <b>tomato</b> <b>fruitworm,</b> Helicoverpa zea. In previous studies we have shown that saliva and its principal component glucose oxidase acts as an effector by suppressing defenses in tobacco. In this current study, we report that saliva elicits a burst of jasmonic acid (JA) and the induction of late responding defense genes such as proteinase inhibitor 2 (Pin 2). Transcripts encoding early response genes associated with the JA pathway were not affected by saliva. We also observed a delayed response to saliva with increased densities of Type VI glandular trichomes in newly emerged leaves. Proteomic analysis of saliva revealed glucose oxidase (GOX) was the most abundant protein identified and we confirmed that it plays a primary role in the induction of defenses in tomato. These results suggest that the recognition of GOX in tomato may represent a case for effector-triggered immunity. Examination of saliva from other caterpillar species indicates that saliva from th...|$|E
40|$|In Africa, Helicoverpa armigera (Hübner) (Lepidoptera, Noctuidae) {{is a key}} pest {{of cotton}} and {{vegetable}} crops, particularly tomato. Alternatives to insecticides to control this pest are needed such as conservation biological control. However, knowledge on the diversity and ecology of naturally occurring enemies of H. armigera is limited. A two-year field survey was conducted {{in a set of}} tomato farmer fields in the main vegetable-growing area in Senegal (Niayes) to assess the spatial and seasonal occurrence of indigenous parasitoids of H. armigera, and to evaluate the effect of insecticide use on biological control efficiency. No parasitoid emerged from H. armigera eggs. Incidence of larval parasitoids was generally moderate (20 %) but highly variable (0 %– 100 %) among fields, independently of host abundance, and negatively affected by the number of insecticide applications. Larval parasitism was largely dominated by the larval parasitoid Meteorus laphygmarum Brues (Hymenoptera, Braconidae), but a positive correlation was found between specific richness or Shannon diversity index of the parasitoid community and parasitism rate.

40|$|Corn earworm (Helicoverpa zea), {{also called}} <b>tomato</b> <b>fruitworm,</b> {{is a common}} pest of many Solanaceous plants. This insect is known {{to adapt to the}} {{ingestion}} of plant serine protease inhibitors by using digestive proteases that are insensitive to inhibition. We have now identified a B-type carboxypeptidase of H. zea (CPBHz) insensitive to potato carboxypeptidase inhibitor (PCI) in corn earworm. To elucidate the structural features leading to the adaptation of the insect enzyme, the crystal structure of the recombinant CPBHz protein was determined by x-ray diffraction. CPBHz {{is a member of the}} A/B subfamily of metallocarboxypeptidases, which displays the characteristic metallocarboxypeptidase /-hydrolase fold, and does not differ essentially from the previously described Helicoverpa armigera CPA, which is very sensitive to PCI. The data provide structural insight into several functional properties of CPBHz. The high selectivity shown by CPBHz for C-terminal lysine residues is due to residue changes in the S 1 ' substrate specificity pocket that render it unable to accommodate the side chain of an arginine. The insensitivity of CPBHz to plant inhibitors is explained by the exceptional positioning of two of the main regions that stabilize other carboxypeptidase¿PCI complexes, the 8 - 9 loop, and 7 together with the 7 - 8 loop. The rearrangement of these two regions leads to a displacement of the active-site entrance that impairs the proper interaction with PCI.

40|$|Insect {{oviposition}} {{on plants}} frequently precedes herbivory. Accumulating {{evidence indicates that}} plants recognize insect oviposition and elicit direct or indirect defenses to reduce the pressure of future herbivory. Most of the oviposition-triggered plant defenses described thus far remove eggs or keep {{them away from the}} host plant or their desirable feeding sites. Here, we report induction of antiherbivore defense by insect oviposition which targets newly hatched larvae, not the eggs, in the system of tomato Solanum lycopersicum L., and <b>tomato</b> <b>fruitworm</b> moth Helicoverpa zea Boddie. When tomato plants were oviposited by H. zea moths, pin 2, a highly inducible gene encoding protease inhibitor 2, which is a representative defense protein against herbivorous arthropods, was expressed at significantly higher level at the oviposition site than surrounding tissues, and expression decreased with distance away from the site of oviposition. Moreover, more eggs resulted in higher pin 2 expression in leaves, and both fertilized and unfertilized eggs induced pin 2 expression. Notably, when quantified daily following deposition of eggs, pin 2 expression at the oviposition site was highest just before the emergence of larvae. Furthermore, H. zea oviposition primed the wound-induced increase of pin 2 transcription and a burst of jasmonic acid (JA); tomato plants previously exposed to H. zea oviposition showed significantly stronger induction of pin 2 and higher production of JA upon subsequent simulated herbivory than without oviposition. Our results suggest that tomato plants recognize H. zea oviposition as a signal of impending future herbivory and induce defenses to prepare for this herbivory by newly hatched neonate larvae...|$|E

Twenty HearNPV isolates were obtained from single field-collected larval cadavers. Restriction endonuclease (REN) profiles of the collected isolates with BglII and PstI allowed identification of six different H. armigera single-embedded NPV strains in Spain (referred to as HearSP 3, HearSP 4, HearSP 5, HearSP 6, HearSP 7, and HearSP 8) and two in Portugal (referred to as HearPT 1 and HearPT 2). No strains were shared by isolates from different geographical regions except HearSP 5, which was found in isolates from Olivenza and Toledo. Cluster analysis based on the restriction fragment length polymorphisms of these strains in relation to two previously identified strains from Badajoz (HearSP 1) and Cordoba (HearSP 2) in Spain, showed no correlation among the strains and their geographical origin. The biological activity of HearSP 2, HearSP 4, HearSP 7, HearSP 8, HearPT 1, and HearPT 2 was compared in terms of pathogenicity (50 % lethal concentration, LC 50) and virulence (mean time to death).

40|$|AbstractTomato, Lycopersicum esculentum L. (Solanaceae), is an {{important}} crop worldwide that is grown both outdoors and under protected structures, for fresh market consumption and for processing. In the Mariana Islands, tomato is grown as an outdoor crop throughout the year. Tomatoes are attacked {{by a variety of}} pests, including the <b>tomato</b> <b>fruitworm,</b> Helicoverpa armigera (Hübner) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), and, in Pacific islands, the red spider mite Tetranychus marianae McGregor. These pests cause scarring, tissue damage, and aberrations in fruit shape or color, making the tomatoes undesirable for fresh market. Also, insect bodies, excretia or parts in fruits reduce their market suitability. Field trials aimed at improving management of these pests were undertaken at two locations in Guam (Yigo and Inarajan), USA in 2012 and 2013, assessing the efficacy of different biorational and conventional insecticides against T. marianae and H.  armigera on tomato. At both locations, the mean percentage of mite-infested leaves and the population density of T.  marianae were higher in control than in treated plots. An integrated pest management (IPM) program comprising sprays of selective insecticides (Petroleum spray oil, Beauveria bassiana, azadirachtin, and Bacillus thuringiensis), evaluated at 15, 30, 45 and 60 days after transplantation of tomato seedlings, significantly reduced the number of T.  marianae-infested leaves and the density of T.  marianae over plots treated with carbaryl, malathion, six applications of B.  bassiana or B.  thuringiensis and over both controls at both locations. Similarly, significantly lower fruit damage by H.  armigera was recorded in the plots treated with the IPM program than in plots treated with carbaryl, malathion, or the control treatments at both locations. Marketable tomato yields from the plots which received with the IPM program were significantly greater at both locations than were those in the other treatments...|$|E
