5|$|As {{the number}} of condors grew, {{attention}} {{began to focus on}} releasing some back into the wild. In 1988, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service began a reintroduction experiment involving the release of captive Andean condors into the wild in California.

The site of the killings was moved to Crematorium I, where more than 700 victims could be killed at once. By the middle of 1942, the operation was moved to Auschwitz II–Birkenau, a nearby satellite camp which had been under construction since October 1941.|$|E

40|$|The optimal model-based {{design of}} {{experiments}} aims at designing a set of dynamic <b>experiments</b> yielding <b>the</b> most informative process data {{to be used for}} the estimation of the parameters of a first-principles dynamic process model. According to the usual procedure for parameter estimation, <b>the</b> <b>experiment</b> <b>is</b> first designed offline; then, <b>the</b> <b>experiment</b> <b>is</b> carried out in the plant, and process measurements are collected; and finally, parameters are estimated after completion of <b>the</b> <b>experiment.</b> Therefore, <b>the</b> information gathered during the evolution of <b>the</b> <b>experiment</b> <b>is</b> analyzed only at the end of <b>the</b> <b>experiment</b> itself. Since <b>the</b> <b>experiment</b> <b>is</b> designed on <b>the</b> basis of the parameter estimates available before <b>the</b> <b>experiment</b> <b>is</b> started, <b>the</b> progressive increase of the information resulting from the progress of <b>the</b> <b>experiment</b> <b>is</b> not exploited by the designer until the end of that experiment. In this paper, a strategy for the online model-based redesign of <b>experiments</b> <b>is</b> proposed to exploit the information as soon as it is generated from the execution of an experiment, and its performance is compared to that of a standard optimal experiment design approach. Intermediate parameter estimations are carried out while <b>the</b> <b>experiment</b> <b>is</b> running, and by exploiting the information obtained, <b>the</b> <b>experiment</b> <b>is</b> partially redesigned before its termination, with the purpose of updating the experimental settings to generate more valuable information for subsequent analysis. This enables us {{to reduce the number of}} experimental trials that are needed to reach a statistically sound estimation of the model parameters and results in a reduction of experimental time, raw materials needs, number of samples to be analyzed, control effort, and labor. Two simulated case studies of increasing level of complexity are used to demonstrate the benefits of the proposed approach with respect to a state-of-the-art sequential model-based experiment design...|$|R

5|$|In 1957, American News Company, by far {{the largest}} {{magazine}} distributor, was liquidated. Almost all the science-fiction magazines had to find a new distributor, and the smaller independent companies remaining in the market often demanded monthly publication and a larger format from the magazines they took on. Many of the magazines did not have the advertising revenue required to support these changes, and within two or three years, many of them had disappeared: the number of science-fiction magazines being published dropped from a high of 46 in 1953 to less than a dozen {{by the end of the}} decade. For a while If was hard to find on the news stands, but it survived. Quinn did try the slick format (using glossy paper, unlike the cheaper paper used for pulps and digests) for a companion magazine, Space Age, which he launched in November 1958; <b>the</b> <b>experiment</b> <b>was</b> unsuccessful, however. In an attempt to improve Ifs circulation, Quinn hired writer Damon Knight, whose first issue was October 1958.

5|$|In 2004–05, {{researchers}} from Dubna and Livermore identified a new dubnium isotope, 268Db, as a fivefold alpha decay {{product of the}} newly created element 115. This new isotope proved to be long-lived enough to allow chemical experimentation. In the 2004 experiment, a thin layer {{was removed from the}} surface of the target (with dubnium on it), dissolved in aqua regia with tracers and lanthanum carrier, from which precipitated various +3, +4, and +5 species on adding ammonium hydroxide. The precipitate was washed and dissolved in hydrochloric acid, in which it was converted to nitrate form then dried on a film and counted. It mostly contained a +5 species, which was immediately assigned to dubnium, but also a +4 species; based on that result, the team decided that additional chemical separation was needed. In 2005, <b>the</b> <b>experiment</b> <b>was</b> repeated, with the final product being hydroxide rather than nitrate precipitate, which was processed further at both Livermore (based on reverse phase chromatography) and Dubna (based on anion exchange chromatography). The +5 species was effectively isolated; dubnium in that experiment appeared three times in tantalum-only fractions and not even once in niobium-only fractions. However, it was noted that these experiments were insufficient to draw conclusions about the general chemical profile of dubnium.|$|E

5|$|On February 29, 1960, the New York City Transit Authority (NYCTA) {{began to}} test a new tie-less roadbed on Track 1, which had been {{installed}} since the previous Thursday. <b>The</b> <b>experiment</b> <b>was</b> intended to produce a smoother and more comfortable ride for commuters, in addition to lessening the effect of moisture and erosion. It was planned that if the test succeeded, {{the rest of the}} tracks in the subway system would be retrofitted in such a manner. The set-up included two parallel strips of concrete that would serve as the roadbed. Between them, flat-bottomed steel troughs were installed, cushioned by rubber. Inside the troughs, there were rubber tie plates spaced apart with flaps that encase the rail bottom. The rails were kept in place by lug bolts that were anchored in concrete. The third rail was also mounted on concrete. This differed from the normal roadbeds, which consisted of stone, with wooden ties set into it. The ties, under damp conditions, would rot and the spikes would become loose, resulting in bumpy rides. This test replicated similar roadbeds in Toronto's subway system. In order to construct the new roadbed, Track 1 had to be closed. From May 6 to June 5, 1961, Track 4 was closed for the installation of the same roadbed as was tested on Track 1.|$|E
