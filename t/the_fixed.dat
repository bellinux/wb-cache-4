5|$|Back in Kristiansund, Løvold {{started working}} {{with the idea of}} {{building}} a subsea road tunnel from Kristiansund to the mainland. He discussed the issue in Foreningen Kristiansunderen where it received support. Løvold was an important enthusiast for <b>the</b> <b>fixed</b> link project, which would materialize as the Kristiansund and Frei Fixed Link in 1992. The local press dubbed him <b>the</b> <b>fixed</b> link general. In 1955 he organized an inspection of Freifjorden; using echo sounding it was possible to survey the depth of the fjord. Afterwards he took contact with County Governor Olav Oksvik and the two started working towards implementing the plans.|$|E

40|$|<b>Fixing</b> in <b>the</b> foreign {{exchange}} market, in Tokyo at 10 am and in London at 4 pm, {{is a market}} practice that determines the bid-ask-mid-point exchange rate at a scheduled {{time of the day}} in Japan. <b>The</b> <b>fixing</b> exchange rate is then applied to the settlement of {{foreign exchange}} transactions between banks and retail customers including broker dealers, institutional investors, insurance companies, exporters and importers, with varying bid-ask spreads. The findings for <b>the</b> Tokyo <b>fixing</b> are summarized as follows. (1) Price spikes are more frequent than <b>the</b> London <b>fixing.</b> (2) <b>The</b> customer orders are biased toward buying the foreign currencies, and this is predictable. (3) Trading volumes and liquidity concentrate on the USD/JPY. (4) Before 2008, <b>the</b> <b>fixing</b> price set by banks was biased upward, and higher than the highest transaction price during <b>the</b> <b>fixing</b> time window; <b>the</b> banks were earning monopolistic profits, but this gap disappeared after 2008. (5) <b>The</b> <b>fixing</b> price is still above the average transaction prices in <b>the</b> <b>fixing</b> window, suggesting that banks make profits, but that can be understood considering the risk of maintaining <b>the</b> <b>fix</b> for <b>the</b> rest of the business day. And (6) calendar effects also matter for the determination of <b>the</b> <b>fixing</b> rate and <b>the</b> price fluctuation around fixing. 2012 ～ 2016 年度科学研究費補助金[基盤研究(S) ]「長期デフレの解明」(研究代表者 東京大学経済学研究科・渡辺努, 課題番号： 24223003...|$|R

5|$|Al-Zarqali (1028–1087) {{developed}} {{a more accurate}} astrolabe, used for centuries afterwards. He constructed a water clock in Toledo. He discovered that the Sun's apogee moves slowly relative to <b>the</b> <b>fixed</b> stars, and obtained a good estimate of its motion for its rate of change. Nasir al-Din al-Tusi (1201–1274) wrote an important revision to Ptolemy's celestial model. When he became Helagu's astrologer, he was given an observatory and gained access to Chinese techniques and observations. He developed trigonometry as a separate field, and compiled the most accurate astronomical tables available up to that time.|$|E

Ibn Yunus observed more than 10,000 entries for the Sun's position for many years using a large astrolabe.|$|E

5|$|In the {{historically}} very important case where MN in Fig. 1 {{was part of}} an ellipse and S was one of its foci, Newton showed in Proposition 11 that the limit QR / QT2 was constant at each point on the curve so that the force on the body directed towards <b>the</b> <b>fixed</b> point S varied inversely as the square of the distance SP.|$|E
5|$|Intentionally {{set at a}} {{low level}} {{at the time the}} {{cemetery}} and railway opened, in later years <b>the</b> <b>fixed</b> fares offered a very substantial saving over main line tickets to Brookwood (in 1902 the 4s LSWR third class fare to Brookwood was twice the cost of the LNC's equivalent). Additional LNC traffic was generated by golfers disguised as mourners travelling to the golf course which had been built on those parts of the land bought by the LNC in 1852 which had not yet been incorporated into the cemetery. <b>The</b> <b>fixed</b> fares prompted complaints from other London funeral firms after the opening of Woking Crematorium in 1885, as rival undertakers were not given access to the LNC's cheap trains and had to pay the LSWR's cargo rate (24shillings in 1885) to ship a coffin to Brookwood or Woking stations for transfer to the crematorium.|$|E
40|$|An {{automorphism}} {{group of}} a graph G is {{the set of}} all permutations of the vertex set of G that preserve adjacency and non adjacency of vertices in a graph.
