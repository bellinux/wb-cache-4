This {{may have been due}} to the use of short-term, seasonal field studies instead of yearlong studies that <b>take</b> <b>into</b> <b>consideration</b> <b>the</b> effects that changing seasons have on ruffed lemur communities. For instance, during the cold, rainy season, which corresponds with the breeding season, interactions between core groups within a community are significantly reduced. During this time small subgroups form consisting of a mature female, a mature male, and sometimes offspring. This can be misinterpreted as monogamous pair bonding.|$|E

Her Majesty's Government responded that the local planning authorities are responsible for general control of development in their areas and are required to <b>take</b> <b>into</b> <b>consideration</b> <b>the</b> views of interested persons and particularly local communities. In regard to this specific proposal, the government was informed by the Newham London Borough Council that there is neither a current planning permission or application for a mosque, nor is one expected in the near future. In September 2012, a planning application was submitted to Newham Council and is under consideration by them.|$|E

5|$|In February 1995, SINTEF {{handed over}} a report {{ordered by the}} {{commission}} which revealed several absent safety procedures in Widerøe. The report {{was based on a}} recommendation by the International Civil Aviation Organization to <b>take</b> <b>into</b> <b>consideration</b> <b>the</b> organizational structure the aircraft operate within when investigating aviation accidents. In June, parliamentarian Magnus Stangeland criticized the commission for working too slow, stating that the victims and next of kin needed answers to why the accident happened. The lack of cooperation between the police and the commission was the main source of the delays. Similar delays had occurred after Partnair Flight 394 in 1989, which had resulted in the statute of limitations having come into effect by the time the report was published. A temporary report was presented to the survivors and next of kin on 20 March 1996; the report laid the responsibility for the accident on the airline. The final report was published on 10 July 1996 and laid the responsibility for the accident on the company and its operating routines. The report contained 26 recommendations for improvements for the company. The Norwegian Prosecuting Authority decided in September 1997 not to charge Widerøe for the accident.|$|E
5|$|In the Malaysian case Tan Tek Seng v. Suruhanjaya Perkhidmatan Pendidikan (1996), the {{appellant}} had appealed {{against his}} wrongful dismissal from employment {{on the grounds}} of procedural unfairness. One of the issues brought up was whether an unfair procedure meant that he had been deprived of his constitutional right to life or liberty protected by Article 5(1) of the Malaysian Constitution, which is identical to Singapore's Article 9(1). Judge of the Court of Appeal Gopal Sri Ram held that the courts should <b>take</b> <b>into</b> <b>consideration</b> <b>the</b> unique characteristics and situation of the country, and must not be blind to the realities of life. He went on to suggest that a liberal approach be adopted to grasp the intention of the framers of the Constitution by giving life a broad and liberal meaning. He opined that such an interpretation would include elements that form the quality of life, namely the right to seek and be engaged in lawful and gainful employment, and the right to live in a reasonably healthy and pollution-free environment. He also noted that life cannot be extinguished or taken away except according to procedure established by law.|$|E

The results of the referendums were that the Stockholm Municipality voted for the congestion tax, while the other municipalities voted against it.
