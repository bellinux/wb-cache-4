5000|$|A zigzag {{transformer}} is a special-purpose transformer with a zigzag or [...] "interconnected star" [...] winding connection, {{such that}} each output is the vector sum of two (2) phases offset by 120°. Its applications {{are for the}} creation of a missing neutral connection from an ungrounded 3-phase system to permit the grounding of that neutral to an earth reference point and also harmonic mitigation, as it can suppress triplet (3rd, 9th, 15th, 21st, etc.) harmonic currents, to supply 3-phase power as an autotransformer (serving as the primary and secondary with no isolated circuits), and to supply non-standard, phase-shifted, 3-phase power.Nine-winding, three-phase transformers typically have 3 primaries and 6 identical secondary windings, which can be used in zigzag winding connection as pictured. As with the conventional delta or wye winding configuration <b>three-phase</b> <b>transformer,</b> a standard, stand-alone transformer containing only six windings on three cores can also be used in zigzag winding connection, such transformer sometimes being referred to as a zigzag bank. In all cases, six or nine winding, the first coil on each zigzag winding core is connected contrariwise to the second coil on the next core. The second coils are then all tied together to form the neutral, and the phases are connected to the primary coils. Each phase, therefore, couples with each other phase, and the voltages cancel out. As such, there would be negligible current through the neutral point, which can be tied to ground.|$|E

40|$|A {{modified}} winding layout for <b>three-phase</b> <b>transformers</b> with PCB windings {{is proposed}} in this paper. This modified layout {{can be used}} in high current transformers with many PCB layers to simplify the fabrication process.

This issue becomes even more important in medium-high power <b>three-phase</b> <b>transformers,</b> where the number of PCB layers is higher. In addition to that, the proposed method allows the use of commercial core shapes that are commonly used to design single-phase transformers.

40|$|Abstract [...] This paper {{compares the}} mass {{and the total}} owning cost (TOC) of {{three-phase}} distribution transformer banks against three-phase distribution transformers and the comparison {{is based on the}} minimum TOC. This is achieved through a field validated distribution transformer design program that automatically minimizes the objective function (TOC). Transformers compared in this paper are of shell-type, immersed in oil, and all are designed to meet the standard NMX-ANCE- 2006 -J 116 in Mexico. The conclusion of this paper is that from the viewpoint of minimum mass and minimum TOC, in case of small-size transformers (smaller than 45 kVA) it is recommended to use <b>three-phase</b> <b>transformer</b> banks, which is in disagreement with transformer textbooks.

40|$|Abstract. When the HVDC {{works in}} mono-polar {{operation}} or bipolar unbalanced operation, DC {{flows through the}} neutral point and causes DC bias magnetic of transformer around HVDC grounding electrode, which influences the operation security of transformers. Beside highly saturated core, it also causes the distortion of exciting current, increasing harmonics and leakage magnetic flux, and thus the losses, which in turn results in the structures of transformer overheating and insulation aging. Based {{on the principle of}} transformer DC bias magnetic and UMEC of transformer in PSCAD/EMTDC, electromagnetic transient simulation platform of transformer DC bias magnetic is built. Considering the effect of DC bias magnetic on different structure of transformer, three kinds of typical transformer that has been widely applied are selected including <b>three-phase</b> three-limb <b>transformer,</b> <b>three-phase</b> five-limb <b>transformer,</b> <b>three-phase</b> bank <b>transformer.</b> After comparing the differences between these three kinds of transformer, related parameters are set such as the core structure and mode of winding connection and so on...|$|R

Existing methods utilizing excitation inductances {{to discriminate}} inrush current and internal fault of transformer are all {{derived from the}} singe-phase transformer circuit model, yet there are no discussions considering the widely used <b>three-phase</b> three-limb <b>transformers.</b> In view of this question, the mathematical model of <b>three-phase</b> three-limb <b>transformer</b> based {{on the characteristics of}} its magnetic equivalent circuit is established, through which the excitation inductances of the <b>three-phase</b> three-limb <b>transformer</b> can be calculated. The calculated excitation inductances have definite physical meanings and can reflect the saturation state of the transformer core under inrush condition. Analysis of the circuit model demonstrates that the delta circulating current is not the excitation current of <b>three-phase</b> three-limb <b>transformer,</b> so the proposed method can be used to the transformers with delta connection directly.
