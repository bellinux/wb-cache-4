Jameela Jamil was announced as the new presenter of The Official Chart. Matt Edmondson moved <b>to</b> <b>weekend</b> mornings with Tom Deacon briefly replacing him on Wednesday nights. Dan Howell and Phil Lester, famous YouTubers also joined the station. The changes took effect in January 2013.|$|E
25|$|On {{the morning}} {{that he and}} his downtrodden wife, Gerda, are due to travel down to the country <b>to</b> <b>weekend</b> with friends, Dr John Christow, a {{successful}} physician, leading researcher, and very tired and irritated by his current life, allows his little daughter to tell his fortune with cards. When the death card is drawn, he pays no attention, but the appearance of an old flame at The Hollow seems to be the final link in a chain of fatal circumstances.|$|E
25|$|On 15 February 2016, Victoria Police members {{voted for}} the 2016 - 2019 Enterprise Bargain Agreement. On 4 March 2016, {{the outcome of the}} vote was {{announced}} but the new EB took effect starting on 1 December 2015. Under the new EB, Victoria Police officers will receive increased penalty rates for weekend work, added unsociable and intrusive <b>to</b> <b>weekend</b> work, increased pay for prosecutors {{and a number of other}} benefits and entitlements.

25|$|The CBS Evening News {{expanded}} <b>to</b> <b>weekend</b> evenings in February 1966, originally {{anchored by}} Roger Mudd. The Sunday {{edition of the}} program was dropped in September 1971, when CBS began airing 60 Minutes in the 6:00p.m. Eastern Time (5:00p.m. Central) slot in order to help affiliates fulfill requirements imposed by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC)'s Prime Time Access Rule. The Sunday edition returned in January 1976, when the network moved 60 Minutes one hour later to 7:00p.m. Eastern Time, where that program remains to this day (barring NFL on CBS overruns).|$|E
25|$|After Tortoricci {{resigned}} from the network in July 1999, Telemundo tapped former Universal Television president Jim McNamara as its {{president and chief executive}} officer, and Alan Sokol as chief operating officer to helm its operations. Their programming strategy reverted to a more traditional approach to Spanish-language television than the mainstream concept implemented by Tortoricci. The new team struck a programming agreement with TV Azteca for the U.S. rights to the Mexican broadcaster's novelas and other programming, and restored a two-hour block of telenovelas originating from Mexico, Colombia and Brazil – later expanded to three hours with the shift of its late local and national newscasts to the traditional 11:00 (or 10:00) p.m. time slot in 2000 – as part of its Monday through Friday prime time slate which resulted in the cancellation of Angeles and Reyes el Rey. Reality, entertainment and newsmagazine programs were also added to the schedule, while prime time movies were relegated <b>to</b> <b>weekend</b> evenings.|$|E
500|$|While {{working in}} the United States, Saria familiarised himself with the {{independent}} American cinema, which greatly influenced his work. He also listed such directors as the Dardenne brothers, Eric Rohmer and Hrishikesh Mukherjee as influential during his formative years as a filmmaker himself. Critics and commentators drew similarities between Loev and Ang Lee's Brokeback Mountain (2005), as explained by Jha that the similarity [...] "in the way the rocky terrain is used to define the theme of forbidden love is palpable". The film {{was thought to be}} visually and structurally similar to Andrew Haigh’s Weekend (2011), and Wong Kar Wai’s Happy Together (1997), although Saria admitted to have never seen them. However, Ford thought that Loev was more subtle in its portrayal of samesex affection (when compared <b>to</b> <b>Weekend),</b> which made it [...] "quite novel for Bollywood".|$|E
50|$|On September 8, 2011, it was {{announced}} that Dahler would move <b>to</b> <b>weekends,</b> <b>to</b> make room for Chris Wragge who is returning to the local station from a 9-month stint as co-host of CBS' The Early Show.|$|R

500|$|Shortly {{after the}} Cuban Revolution of 1959, newly elected Cuban President Manuel Urrutia Lleó, a devout Christian and liberal, began {{a program of}} closing {{gambling}} outlets, nightclubs, and other establishments associated with Havana's hedonistic lifestyle. This had an immediate impact on the livelihoods of local entertainers. As the Cuban government rapidly shifted towards the left {{in an effort to}} build a [...] "classless and colourblind society", it struggled to define policy toward forms of cultural expression in the black community; expressions which had implicitly emphasized cultural differences. Consequently, the cultural and social centers were abolished, including the Afro-Cuban mutual aid Sociedades de Color in 1962, to make way for racially integrated societies. Private festivities were limited <b>to</b> <b>weekend</b> parties and organizers' funds were confiscated. The measures meant the closure of the Buena Vista Social Club. Although the Cuban government continued to support traditional music after the revolution, certain favor was given to the politically charged nueva trova, and poetic singer-songwriters such as Silvio Rodríguez and Pablo Milanés. The emergence of pop music and salsa, a style derived from Cuban music but developed in the United States, meant that son music became even less common.|$|E

2500|$|When {{the line}} opened, fare {{collection}} was modelled on traditional rapid transit lines, with booth attendants. Low volumes of activity at some entrances led <b>to</b> <b>weekend</b> closures of alternate station entrances. In November 1980, Edmonton Transit (as {{it was then}} named) switched to a modified European-style [...] "proof of payment" [...] system, retaining the old turnstiles to issue the new receipts. Fares were now collected by automated ticket vending machines with irregular proof of payment inspectors, which permitted keeping all entrances open and required fewer staff.|$|E

2500|$|In mid-2002, A {{underwent}} {{an overhaul}} in management which moved the network's focus toward reality television {{in order to}} attract a younger demographic and cancelled the network's two original scripted series. In May 2003, A launched a marketing campaign with the network's new tagline, [...] "The Art of Entertainment." [...] Between 2003 and 2007, the channel gradually retired several long-running series, moving its classic mysteries to The Biography Channel and cancelling Breakfast with the Arts, in favor of reality programming such as Dog the Bounty Hunter, Gene Simmons Family Jewels, Growing Up Gotti, Family Plots, Airline, Inked, King of Cars, and Criss Angel Mindfreak. In addition, A had garnered favorable notice for true-crime documentary series such as Cold Case Files, American Justice, City Confidential, Investigative Reports, and The First 48. The network also cut back on its broadcasts of Biography from originally twice daily <b>to</b> <b>weekend</b> mornings only.|$|E
2500|$|A {{few months}} later, {{in the wake}} of the April 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, Chung was widely criticized for sarcasm as she asked an Oklahoma City Fire Department spokesman, [...] "Can the Oklahoma City Fire Department handle this?" [...] Many Oklahomans felt the {{question}} was insensitive to the situation. For instance, a few women created [...] "Bite Me, Connie Chung" [...] shirts in response to the interview. Thousands of viewers in Oklahoma and elsewhere called and wrote letters of protest over the tone of the questions. Moreover, co-anchor Dan Rather was irate that Chung was sent from New York to the assignment while he was already in nearby Texas. Consequently, after public outcry, and Rather's complaints, Chung was given a choice to resign or move <b>to</b> <b>weekend</b> anchor or morning anchor, or resign. Chung left the network after being removed as Co-Anchor of CBS Evening News.|$|E
2500|$|In 2011, the MTA {{began to}} look at ways of {{displaying}} service disruptions due <b>to</b> <b>weekend</b> engineering works in a visual format. They invited Vignelli Associates (comprising at that time Massimo Vignelli, Yoshiki Waterhouse, and Beatriz Cifuentes) to develop a digital version of the 2008 map. On September 16, 2011, the MTA introduced a Vignelli Associates interactive subway map, called [...] "The Weekender", to its website. As the title suggests, {{it is a way}} for riders to get information about any planned work, from late Friday night to early Monday morning, that is going on either on a service(s) or station(s) of the subway during the weekend only. On June 11, 2012, the MTA duplicated [...] "The Weekender" [...] site as a free mobile app download for iOS. On November 29, 2012, an Android version of the app was released. The Weekender, however, is only available as an online version, because it changes every week.|$|E
50|$|In January 2016, Tong {{returned}} to weekdays, co-anchoring a new 6:30 p.m. newscast alongside longtime WWOR anchor Brenda Blackmon. However, in September 2016, the newscast was cancelled and Tong was moved back <b>to</b> <b>weekends.</b>|$|R

2500|$|The station's 11:00p.m. {{newscast}} {{evolved into}} an hour-long 10:00p.m. program after it joined Fox, but was revived in 1995 as a 15-minute wrap-up {{of the proceedings}} in the O.J. Simpson murder case, and expanded to a half-hour the following year; the 11:00p.m. newscast expanded <b>to</b> <b>weekend</b> evenings on September 26, 2009. The station debuted a half-hour 4:00p.m. newscast on September 11, 2006, which later expanded to one hour in 2007. On January 11, 2009, starting with its 5:00p.m. newscast, WSVN became the second station in the Miami market (behind WTVJ) to begin broadcasting its local newscasts in high definition. With the switch to HD, came an updated newsplex set that premiered two weeks earlier on December 29, 2008 and new HD graphics. On July 11, 2010, WSVN expanded its Saturday and Sunday 6:00p.m. newscasts to one hour {{with the addition of}} half-hour newscasts at 6:30p.m. On August 22, 2011, WSVN added a fifth hour (from 9:00–10:00a.m.) to the weekday edition of Today in Florida, by way of the move of Live! with Regis and Kelly to WPLG. On Sunday, September 13, 2015, the station expanded its Today in Florida newscast to Sunday mornings airing from 8:00–11:00a.m. [...] The latest addition now brings the total newscast output to 64 1/2 hours per week.|$|E

If I were weekending at Bodfish's, I should have arrived there just half an hour ago. I therefore selected that moment for beginning not <b>to</b> <b>weekend</b> with Bodfish. I settled myself in this chair and I did not have my back slapped at the station. A few minutes later I was not whirling along the country roads, trying to balance the car with my legs and an elbow. Time passed, and I was not shaking hands with Mrs. Bodfish. I have just had the most corking half-hour, and shortly--when you have remembered an appointment--I shall go on having it. What I am {{really looking forward to}} is the happy time after dinner. I shall pass it in not playing bridge with Bodfish, Mrs. Bodfish, and a neighbor. Sunday morning is {{the best part of the}} whole weekend, though. That is when I shall most enjoy myself. Do you know a man named Pringle? Next Saturday I am not going to stay with Pringle. I forget who is not to be my host the Saturday after that. I have so many engagements of this kind that I lose track of them." ...|$|E

50|$|The busiest {{portion of}} the street had, since 2000, been pedestrianised all week long. However, the Traffic and Transport Committee of the Yau Tsim Mong District Council voted on 21 November 2013 to {{restrict}} the pedestrianisation <b>to</b> <b>weekends</b> and public holidays only, citing complaints from local residents. A {{survey conducted by the}} Home Affairs Department found that 80 per cent of residents and shop owners wanted to limit pedestrianisation, while most people questioned on the street wanted to keep the weekday pedestrianisation. In spite of criticism, the pedestrianisation hours were reduced <b>to</b> <b>weekends</b> only with effect from January 2014. Retail rents on the street subsequently dropped.|$|R
