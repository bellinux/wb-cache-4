5|$|On August 27, 2013, Hickenlooper {{asked the}} Colorado Supreme Court to clarify if a voter had <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> recall in order <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> a {{replacement}} candidate. At the same time, Libertarian Jan Brooks turned in petitions {{to be on}} the ballot against Morse while Democrat Richard Anglund announced his write-in candidacy against Giron. On August 28, the Supreme Court ruled that a voter did not have to vote to recall in order <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> a replacement, but that the Senators could only be recalled by a majority vote. Secretary of State Gessler announced that Brooks did not have sufficient signatures to qualify for the ballot, leaving only Republican opponents on the ballot.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the desire}} of silver delegates to {{nominate}} a candidate who shared their beliefs, and although several states instructed their delegates <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> a specific candidate, there was no overwhelming favorite for the nomination going into the convention. With a two-thirds vote of the delegates needed to nominate, almost every silver delegate would have <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> the same candidate to assure success, though any organized support from gold delegates would greatly damage a silver candidate's chances.|$|E
5000|$|In {{election}} campaigns, {{a leading}} candidate may appeal to voters who support a less-popular candidate <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> instead <b>for</b> the leading candidate for tactical reasons, {{on the basis}} that a <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> their preferred candidate is likely to be wasted. In some electoral systems, it may be plausible for less-popular candidates to make similar appeals to supporters of more-popular candidates. In a plurality voting system, the term [...] "wasted vote" [...] is not usually applied <b>to</b> <b>votes</b> <b>for</b> the second-placed candidate, but rather <b>to</b> <b>votes</b> <b>for</b> candidates finishing third or lower. This is a reflection of Duverger's Law, i.e. the institutionalisation of a two-party system.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} impact of the HEXACO model of {{personality}} structure in predicting political ideology and voting. Five-hundred and seventeen participants provided responses for measures of the HEXACO and the Five Factor Models, ideological orientation, and past voting. Results showed that Conscientiousness was linked <b>to</b> <b>voting</b> <b>for</b> right-wing parties, whereas Honesty-Humility. Agreeableness and Openness were related <b>to</b> <b>voting</b> <b>for</b> left-wing parties. Ideological orientation mediated the relationship between personality traits and voting. Hierarchical tests indicated that the HEXACO outperformed the Five Factor Model in predicting ideological orientation. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

30|$|Idescat labels as “PP” the {{information}} about <b>votes</b> <b>for</b> right-wing parties, however it is worth mentioning that this label refers <b>to</b> <b>votes</b> <b>for</b> different right-wing political parties. For instance, the 1980 figure is for Solidaritat Catalana, party that was dissolved after this election.|$|R
5|$|A {{few months}} before the {{election}} Cheney put his home in Dallas up for sale and changed his drivers' license and voter registration back to Wyoming. This change was necessary to allow Texas' presidential electors <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> both Bush and Cheney without contravening the Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which forbids electors from voting for someone from their own state for both President and Vice President.|$|E
5|$|Baronius {{came within}} 9 votes of election, with 32 of the electors {{supporting}} him, {{but he refused}} to advocate his own election or accept election by acclamation. Aldobrandini was unable to convince some members of his faction <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> Baronius because they viewed him as too strict, and by 30 March he had resigned himself to look for other candidates.|$|E

5|$|In 1829, Crittenden {{was elected}} to the Kentucky House via a special election. He served as Speaker of the House for his entire term. In 1830, he was the Whig nominee to replace John Rowan in the Senate. Secretly, the party wished to {{nominate}} Henry Clay, giving him a springboard from which to launch another presidential campaign, but it was unknown whether {{he would be able to}} secure enough votes for confirmation; it was decided that Crittenden would be the nominee, and if the voting favored the Whigs by a large enough margin, Crittenden would withdraw and allow them to confirm Clay instead. The Democrats countered successively with Richard Mentor Johnson, John Rowan, Charles A. Wickliffe, and John Breathitt. None of them polled more than sixty-four of the sixty-nine votes needed for confirmation. Crittenden garnered sixty-eight votes on fourteen different ballots, but he refused <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> himself because he wanted Clay to be the nominee. Some of Crittenden's supporters, however, refused <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> Clay, and the seat was left vacant.|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} <b>to</b> <b>voting</b> <b>for</b> a party list, voters may express {{preference for}} one individual candidate. A candidate receiving sufficiently many personal votes can rise in rank {{on his or}} her district party list; voters thus have a certain degree of influence as to which particular individual wins which particular seat. It is not possible, however, <b>to</b> simultaneously <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> party X but exert influence on the candidate rankings on the party list of party Y.|$|R

5|$|It {{lasted for}} five months, from 12 February to 12 July 1691. The {{conclave}} became deadlocked after Catholic monarchs opposed {{the election of}} Gregorio Barbarigo, who {{some members of the}} College of Cardinals also viewed as too strict. The conclave only ended in the July when cardinals started to become ill from the heat, and after French cardinals agreed <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> Pignatelli despite him coming from Spanish-controlled Naples.|$|E
5|$|Nonetheless, Bute {{was able}} to {{personally}} appoint the Constable of Cardiff Castle, and the constable by law acted as the effective mayor of Cardiff, ran the town's council and had wide powers when appointing local officials. He inherited the title of Lord-Lieutenant of the county in 1815, giving him the right to recommend the appointments of new magistrates and various other civic posts; potential candidates for these posts were advised <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> Bute's representatives at elections. In 1825 he became the colonel {{in chief of the}} Royal Glamorgan Militia, and used this authority to instruct the militia <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> his candidates. Those who publicly voted against Bute faced charitable donations and support being cut off. His later control of the Cardiff Docks also helped to provide patronage and influence voting behaviour.|$|E
