5|$|A {{number of}} witnesses, {{including}} Hannah Cox, {{testified to the}} events of the evening of 26 May and of the following morning. The first witnesses to attract significant cross-examination by William Reader, Thornton's barrister, were the two factory workers, William Lavell and Joseph Bird, who had matched Thornton's shoes to the footprints in the harrowed field. Under cross-examination, both admitted that it had rained heavily between the time the footprints were made and the time they attempted to match the prints. Constable Dales told the jury that Thornton admitted having sex with Ashford before he was searched: that is, before his bloodstained clothing came to light. Mr Freer, a Birmingham surgeon who conducted the post-mortem, testified as to its results, and stated <b>that</b> <b>except</b> for the vaginal lacerations, there were no signs of violence on Ashford's person, and that those cuts could have been caused by consensual sexual relations. Freer's testimony concluded the prosecution case, and as the defendant declined to exercise his right to himself make a statement to the court, the defence began calling witnesses.|$|E

25|$|There is {{a wealth}} of early Chinese {{literature}} dating from the Hundred Schools of Thought {{that occurred during the}} Eastern Zhou Dynasty (770–256 BC).

Note <b>that,</b> <b>except</b> for the books of poems and songs, most of this literature is philosophical and didactic; there is {{little in the way of}} fiction.

25|$|However, Karl Ludwig Hencke persisted, {{and began}} searching for more {{asteroid}}s in 1830. Fifteen years later, he found 5 Astraea, {{the first new}} asteroid in 38 years. He also found 6 Hebe {{less than two years}} later. After this, other astronomers joined in the search and at least one new asteroid was discovered every year after <b>that</b> (<b>except</b> the wartime year 1945). Notable asteroid hunters of this early era were J. R. Hind, Annibale de Gasparis, Robert Luther, H. M. S. Goldschmidt, Jean Chacornac, James Ferguson, Norman Robert Pogson, E. W. Tempel, J. C. Watson, C. H. F. Peters, A. Borrelly, J. Palisa, the Henry brothers and Auguste Charlois.|$|E
25|$|Geographically, the Basque Country was {{inhabited}} in Roman {{times by}} several tribes: the Vascones, the Varduli, the Caristi, the Autrigones, the Berones, the Tarbelli, and the Sibulates. Many believe <b>that</b> <b>except</b> for the Berones and Autrigones they were non-Indo-European peoples, although the ethnic {{background of the}} most westerly tribes is not clear {{due to lack of}} information. Some ancient place-names, such as Deba, Butrón, Nervión, Zegama, suggest the presence of non-Basque peoples at some point in protohistory. The ancient tribes are last cited in the 5th century, after which track of them is lost, with only Vascones still being accounted for, while extending far beyond their former boundaries, e.g. in the current lands of Álava and most conspicuously around the Pyrenees and Novempopulania.|$|E
25|$|It was at Cerne, {{and partly}} at the desire, it appears, of Æthelweard, {{that he planned}} the two series of his English homilies (edited by Benjamin Thorpe, 1844–1846, for the Ælfric Society and more {{recently}} by Malcolm Godden and Peter Clemoes for the Early English Text Society), compiled from the Christian fathers, and dedicated to Sigeric, Archbishop of Canterbury (990–994). The Latin preface to the first series enumerates some of Ælfric's authorities, the chief of whom was Gregory the Great, but the short list there given by no means exhausts the authors whom he consulted. In the preface to the first volume he regrets <b>that</b> <b>except</b> for Alfred's translations, Englishmen had no means of learning the true doctrine as expounded by the Latin fathers. John Earle (Anglo-Saxon Literature, 1884) thinks he aimed at correcting the apocryphal, and to modern ideas superstitious, teaching of the earlier Blickling Homilies.|$|E

25|$|Under {{the racial}} {{restrictions}} that lasted from Brigham Young's presidency until 1978, persons with any black African ancestry could not receive church priesthood or any temple ordinances including the endowment and eternal marriage or {{participate in any}} proxy ordinances for the dead. An important exception to this temple ban was <b>that</b> (<b>except</b> for a complete temple ban period from the mid-1960s until the early 70s under McKay) black members had been allowed a limited use recommend to act as proxies in baptisms for the dead. The priesthood restriction was particularly limiting, because the LDS Church has a lay priesthood and most male members {{over the age of}} 12 have received the priesthood. Holders of the priesthood officiate at church meetings, perform blessings of healing, and manage church affairs. Excluding black people from the priesthood meant that men could not hold any significant church leadership roles or participate in many important events such as performing a baptism, blessing the sick, or giving a baby blessing. Between 1844 and 1977, most black people were not permitted to participate in ordinances performed in the LDS Church temples, such as the endowment ritual, celestial marriages, and family sealings. These ordinances are considered essential to enter the highest degree of heaven, so this meant that they could not enjoy the full privileges enjoyed by other Latter-day Saints during the restriction.|$|E
25|$|No {{fighting}} is reported for 342. Instead the sources {{focus on a}} mutiny by part of the soldiery. According to the most common variant, following the Roman victories of 343 the Campani asked Rome for winter garrisons to protect them against the Samnites. Subverted by the luxurious lifestyle of the Campani, the garrison soldiers started plotting to seize control and set themselves up as masters of Campania. However the conspiracy was discovered by the consuls of 342 before the coup could be carried out. Afraid of being punished, the plotters mutinied, formed a rebel army and marched against Rome. Marcus Valerius Corvus was nominated dictator {{to deal with the}} crisis; he managed to convince the mutineers to lay down their arms without bloodshed and a series of economic, military and political reforms were passed to deal with their grievances. The history of this mutiny is however disputed among modern historians and {{it is possible that the}} whole narrative has been invented to provide a background for the important reforms passed this year. These reforms included the Leges Genuciae which stated that no one could be reelected to the same office within less than ten years, and it is clear from the list of consuls <b>that</b> <b>except</b> in years of great crisis this law was enforced. It also became a firm rule that one of the consuls had to be a plebeian.|$|E
