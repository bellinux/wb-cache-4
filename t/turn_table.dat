40|$|Design of multi-functional {{machining}} center The {{purpose of this}} diploma thesis is a design of <b>turning</b> <b>table</b> for multi-functional {{machining center}}. The first part is the background research of multi-functional machining centers, rotary tables, chip management and brief overview of chosen machining center’s manufacturers. The sphere of using of the designed machine, including parameters of <b>turning</b> <b>table,</b> and its basic parameters are determined {{on the basis of}} this research. Afterwards, the variants of <b>turning</b> <b>table</b> drives are drawn up and one variant of calculation and construction is made. Design of clamping desk and chip management of the machine is also made. Above a specified framework of this thesis, simplified machine foundation design and anchoring of machine parts to this basis is performed. The work also includes a 3 D model of <b>turning</b> <b>table</b> and substructure. The complete set of constructed machining center was brought into immersion virtual reality environment.
