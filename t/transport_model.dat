40|$|The {{movement}} and transport {{of people and}} goods is spatial by its very nature. Thus, geospatial fundamentals of transport systems need to be adequately considered in <b>transport</b> <b>models.</b> Until recently this was not always the case. Instead, transport research and geography evolved widely independently in domain silos. However, driven by recent conceptual, methodological and technical developments {{the need for an}} integrated approach is obvious. This paper attempts to outline the potential of Geographical Information Systems (GIS) for <b>transport</b> <b>modeling.</b> We identify three fields of <b>transport</b> <b>modeling</b> where the spatial perspective can significantly contribute to a more efficient modeling process and more reliable model results, namely geospatial data, disaggregated <b>transport</b> <b>models</b> and the role of geo-visualization. For these three fields, available findings from various domains are compiled before open aspects are formulated as research questions. The overall aim {{of this paper is to}} strengthen the spatial perspective in <b>transport</b> <b>modeling</b> and to call for a further integration of GIS in the domain of <b>transport</b> <b>modeling...</b>|$|R
40|$|Recent {{developments}} in {{national and international}} freight <b>transport</b> <b>models</b> within Europe The past decade has seen many new freight <b>transport</b> <b>models</b> for use in transport planning by public authorities. Some of these models have developed new concepts, such as logistics modules, inclusion of transshipments, storage and sourcing and the determination of shipment size. This paper provides {{a review of the}} European literature on freight <b>transport</b> <b>models</b> that operate at the national or international level and have been developed since 2004. The introduction of elements of logistics thinking is identified as a common theme in recently developed models, and further worked out.

40|$|The paper proposes an {{approach}} to better integrate logistics hubs into freight <b>transport</b> <b>modelling.</b> We will do this for the particular case of seaports and concentrate in the empirical section on German ports. In current freight <b>transport</b> <b>models</b> seaports are handled as ‘singular transport generators’. The freight traffic flow for seaports is directly inserted into the models and is not generated by the implementation of attributes or indicators. There {{are only a few}} approaches of integrating logistics in freight <b>transport</b> <b>models.</b> They are using the supply chain or supply chain elements for the integration of logistics. None of the models analysed integrate logistics hubs in freight <b>transport</b> <b>models.</b> We will show how to differentiate logistics hubs, which data on logistics hubs especially on seaports are available and which data are needed. We will develop a new approach of integration of seaports as logistics hub in freight <b>transport</b> <b>models</b> by using key ratios. For this we will take a look at different parts and terminals of seaports...|$|R

Its advancing boundary, often called a plume edge, can intersect with groundwater wells or daylight into surface water such as seeps and spring, making the water supplies unsafe for humans and wildlife.

25|$|Water runoff often {{collects}} over watersheds {{flowing into}} rivers. A mathematical model used to simulate river or stream flow and calculate water quality parameters is a hydrological <b>transport</b> <b>model.</b> Some water is diverted to irrigation for agriculture. Rivers and seas offer opportunity for travel and commerce. Through erosion, runoff shapes the environment creating river valleys and deltas which provide rich soil and level {{ground for the}} establishment of population centers. A flood occurs when an area of land, usually low-lying, is covered with water. It is when a river overflows its banks or flood comes from the sea. A drought is an extended period of months or years when a region notes a deficiency in its water supply. This occurs when a region receives consistently below average precipitation.|$|E
25|$|Interactions between {{groundwater}} {{and surface}} water are complex. Consequently, groundwater pollution, {{also referred to}} as groundwater contamination, is not as easily classified as surface water pollution. By its very nature, groundwater aquifers are susceptible to contamination from sources that may not directly affect surface water bodies, and the distinction of point vs. non-point source may be irrelevant. A spill or ongoing release of chemical or radionuclide contaminants into soil (located away from a surface water body) may not create point or non-point source pollution but can contaminate the aquifer below, creating a toxic plume. The movement of the plume, called a plume front, may be analyzed through a hydrological <b>transport</b> <b>model</b> or groundwater model. Analysis of groundwater contamination may focus on soil characteristics and site geology, hydrogeology, hydrology, {{and the nature of the}} contaminants.|$|E

40|$|This report {{summarizes}} the research {{activities in the}} Florida State University for quantifying parametric and model uncertainty in groundwater reactive <b>transport</b> <b>modeling.</b> Mathematical and computational research was conducted to investigate the following five questions: (1) How does uncertainty behave and affect groundwater reactive <b>transport</b> <b>models?</b> (2) What cause the uncertainty in groundwater reactive <b>transport</b> <b>modeling?</b> (3) How to quantify parametric uncertainty of groundwater reactive <b>transport</b> <b>modeling?</b> (4) How to quantify model uncertainty of groundwater reactive <b>transport</b> <b>modeling?</b> and (5) How to reduce predictive uncertainty by collecting data of maximum value of information or data-worth? The questions were addressed using Interdisciplinary methods, including computational statistics, Bayesian uncertainty analysis, and groundwater modeling. Both synthetic and real-world data were used to evaluate and demonstrate the developed methods. The research results revealed special challenges to uncertainty quantification for groundwater reactive <b>transport</b> <b>models.</b> For example, competitive reactions and substitution effects of reactions also cause parametric uncertainty. Model uncertainty {{is more important than}} parametric uncertainty, and model averaging methods are a vital tool to improve model predictions. Bayesian methods are more accurate than regression methods for uncertainty quantification. However, when Bayesian uncertainty analysis is computationally impractical, uncertainty analysis using regression methods still provides insights into uncertainty analysis. The research results of this study are useful to science-informed decision-making and uncertainty reduction by collecting data of more value of information...|$|R

40|$|The {{advanced}} internationalisation {{of markets}} and production processes continuously {{adds to the}} complexity of supply chains. At the same time improving the sustainability of the related international freight transport processes and optimising their efficiency is becoming a topic of central relevance. International freight <b>transport</b> <b>models</b> are an important tool to simulate impacts of measures taken to achieve such improvements of transport processes. Yet, the requirements towards international freight <b>transport</b> <b>models</b> are complex: they need to include various modes of transport, they need to cover different industries and their dynamics, they need to consider seasonality of supply and demand of goods, demographic parameters, economic developments, technological developments including their impact on production processes and structures, and many other aspects. Furthermore, international freight <b>transport</b> <b>models</b> need to include freight flows within countries as well as freight flows between the considered countries. This paper discusses the challenges which need to be confronted when developing international freight <b>transport</b> <b>models</b> which are able to correspond to the described complexity of international freight transport.
