5000|$|Doddridge {{sat on the}} {{commission}} appointed in October 1621 to examine the right of Archbishop George Abbot to install the newly elected bishops John Williams, John Davenant, and Valentine Cary who objected to be consecrated by him {{on account of his}} accidental homicide in a hunting accident. Directed at the time of interest in the Spanish Match (August 1623) by warrant under the great seal to soften the rigour of the statutes against recusants, Doddridge, according to Yonge, was hoped to discover a way to dispense with the statutes altogether. He concurred in the judgment delivered by Chief-Justice Nicholas Hyde on 28 November 1627 in Darnell's Case, refusing <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>to</b> <b>bail</b> the five knights committed to prison for refusing to subscribe the forced loan of that year, and he was arraigned by the House of Lords in April of the following year to justify his conduct. His plea was that [...] "the king holds of none but God".|$|E
5000|$|The court {{being of}} the opinion that the {{defendant}} ought not <b>to</b> be <b>admitted</b> <b>to</b> <b>bail</b> after conviction and sentence unless some extraordinary reason therefor is shown, and there being no sufficient reason shown in this case, it is ordered that the motion and application for bail be and the same is hereby denied, and the defendant be remanded to the custody of the United States marshal.|$|R
60|$|However, as I was {{a person}} of {{hitherto}} unblemished character, and wore a good coat made by a fashionable tailor, the magistrate decided <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> me <b>to</b> <b>bail,</b> if two sureties in five hundred pounds each were promptly forthcoming for the purpose. Luckily, I had no difficulty in finding friends who believed in my story; and as I felt sure the lost Wulfric would soon be found in cleaning the museum, I suffered perhaps a little less acutely than I might otherwise have done, owing to my profound confidence in the final triumph of the truth.|$|R
50|$|Clawson v. United States, , {{was a case}} {{regarding}} a Utah territorial statute which authorized an appeal by a defendant in a criminal action from a final judgment of conviction, which provides that an appeal shall stay execution upon filing with the clerk a certificate of a judge that in his opinion there is probable cause for the appeal, and further provides that after conviction, a defendant who has appealed may be <b>admitted</b> <b>to</b> <b>bail</b> as of right when the judgment is for the payment of a fine only, and as matter of discretion in other cases, does not confer upon a defendant {{convicted and sentenced to}} pay a fine and be imprisoned the right, after appeal and filing of certificate of probable cause, <b>to</b> be <b>admitted</b> <b>to</b> <b>bail</b> except within the discretion of the court.|$|R
50|$|If {{the accused}} pleads not guilty or innocent, the {{magistrate}} will postpone {{the case and}} arrange the next hearing. If the accused has been <b>admitted</b> <b>to</b> police <b>bail</b> {{at the time of}} the first hearing, the magistrate will normally set the same requirements as the police have set and allow the accused <b>to</b> continue being <b>admitted</b> <b>to</b> <b>bail.</b> Although judicial bail and police bail are the same, they are required to proceed separately under the principle of separation of powers; the accused is thus required to finish all the procedure for transferring the police bail into judicial bail.|$|R
50|$|Before 1990, {{admission}} <b>to</b> <b>bail</b> was not {{a fundamental}} right, even though it could be extended from the principle of presumption of innocence. So, back then, if the accused did not know or request <b>to</b> for <b>admitting</b> <b>to</b> <b>bail,</b> the accused could literally be stuck in a police station forever. But in 1991, the law changed. In 1991, the government enacted Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance, Article 5(3), which recognises the right <b>to</b> <b>bail.</b> Like many other fundamental rights, the right <b>to</b> <b>bail</b> is not absolute. Depending on the situation, the police or the prosecutor may refuse the accused from <b>admitting</b> <b>to</b> <b>bail</b> (like, if the prosecutor believes {{there is a strong}} possibility that the accused would annoy or threaten any witnesses of the case). Under that situation, the accused may request to bring the question before a magistrate. If the magistrate follows the prosecutor's advice and refuses the accused from <b>admitting</b> <b>to</b> <b>bail,</b> the accused still has the last chance to bring the question to the High Court. By the same token, if the magistrate allows the accused <b>to</b> <b>bail,</b> the prosecutor can also bring the question to the High Court.|$|R

50|$|Montgomery was not tried, and in November 1700 was ill at Ghent. In January 1701 King William III {{allowed him}} to travel from Flanders {{in order to raise}} money on his estate and pay debts.

He was living in Powis House in Great Ormond Street in 1708.|$|R
50|$|In 1852, he was {{a presidential}} elector on the Democratic ticket, voting for Franklin Pierce. He was United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York from 1853 to 1854.

After the war he became senior counsel for Jefferson Davis on his indictment for treason. He also appeared upon Davis's bond when the latter was <b>admitted</b> <b>to</b> <b>bail.</b> These facts and O'Conor's connection with the Roman Catholic Church affected unfavourably his political fortunes.|$|R
5000|$|... (f) {{provides}} that only persons who fit into certain categories {{are subject to}} detention without bail: persons {{charged with a crime}} of violence, an offense for which the maximum sentence is life imprisonment or death, certain drug offenses for which the maximum offense is greater than 10 years, repeat felony offenders, or if the defendant poses a serious risk of flight, obstruction of justice, or witness tampering. There is a special hearing held to determine whether the defendant fits within these categories; anyone not within them must be <b>admitted</b> <b>to</b> <b>bail.</b>|$|R
50|$|If {{a person}} has been <b>admitted</b> <b>to</b> <b>bail</b> in another state, escapes bail, and is present in this State, the bail bondsman or other person who is bail for such fugitive, may file with a {{magistrate}} in the county where the fugitive is present an affidavit stating the name and whereabouts of the fugitive, the offense with which the alleged fugitive was charged or {{of which he was}} convicted, the time and place of same, and the particulars in which the fugitive has violated the terms of his bail, and may request the issuance of a warrant for arrest of the fugitive, and the issuance, after hearing, of an order authorizing the affiant to return the fugitive to the jurisdiction from which he escaped bail. The magistrate may require such additional evidence under oath as he deems necessary to decide the issue. If he concludes that there is probable cause for believing that the person alleged to be a fugitive is such, he may issue a warrant for his arrest. The magistrate shall notify the district attorney of such action and shall direct him to investigate the case and determine the facts of the matter. When the fugitive is brought to him pursuant to the warrant, the magistrate shall set a time and place for hearing, and shall advise the fugitive of his right to counsel and to produce evidence at the hearing. He may <b>admit</b> the fugitive <b>to</b> <b>bail</b> pending the hearing. The district attorney shall appear at the hearing. If, after hearing, the magistrate is satisfied from the evidence that the person is a fugitive he may issue an order authorizing affiant to return the fugitive to the jurisdiction from which he escaped bail. A bondsman or other person who is <b>bail</b> for a fugitive <b>admitted</b> <b>to</b> <b>bail</b> in another state who takes the fugitive into custody, except pursuant to an order issued under this section, is guilty of a misdemeanor.|$|R
50|$|Procurators fiscal make {{preliminary}} {{investigations into}} criminal cases, take written statements from witnesses (known as precognition) and {{are responsible for}} the investigation and prosecution of crime. This includes the power to direct the police in their investigation, but except for serious crimes such as murder the police normally complete their enquiries before involving the procurator fiscal. Once someone has been charged with an offence and remanded in custody, the Crown must bring the case to trial within 110 days or the accused will be <b>admitted</b> <b>to</b> <b>bail.</b> Otherwise, in serious cases (known as solemn procedure with a jury as opposed to summary procedure without) the trial must commence within 12 months of the date of first appearance in court.|$|R

50|$|Historically, {{at least}} a {{significant}} portion of people have engaged in premarital sex, although the number willing <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>to</b> having done so was not always high. In a study conducted in the United States, 61 percent of men and 12 percent of women born prior <b>to</b> 1910 <b>admitted</b> <b>to</b> having premarital sex; the gender disparity may have been caused by cultural double standards regarding the admission of sexual activity or by men frequenting prostitutes.|$|R

50|$|What makes denial {{denial and}} not just a refusal <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>to</b> or accept a truth or fact rests in the degree of an individual's {{awareness}} of the existence of the truth or fact. In denial, an individual does not see or is mostly unconscious of existence of the truth or fact. The choice to refuse reality, then, is unconscious as well. Refusal <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>to</b> or accept a truth or fact differs from denial in that the individual recognizes or is conscious of the existence of the truth or fact but consciously refuses to accept it as such.|$|R
