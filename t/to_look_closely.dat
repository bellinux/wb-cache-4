Brownies {{were known to be}} driven off by being given clothing, though some folktales recounted that they were offended by inferior quality of the garments given, and others merely stated it, some even recounting that the brownie was delighted with the gift and left with it. Other brownies left households or farms because they heard a complaint, or a compliment. People who saw the fairies were advised not <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>closely,</b> because they resented infringements on their privacy. The need to not offend them could lead to problems: one farmer found that fairies threshed his corn, but the threshing continued after all his corn was gone, and he concluded that they were stealing from his neighbors, leaving him the choice between offending them, dangerous in itself, and profiting by the theft.|$|E

CNN reported that [...] "So while August Kreis may be calling, {{there is no}} sign that al Qaeda is listening." [...] His statements raised federal concerns about violations of the law which caused the government <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>closely</b> at his activities and finances. The federal government concluded that he had no link with any terrorist organization. The government, however, in the process discovered “substantial unreported funds” going into his bank accounts with more than $33,000 in unreported income in 2005.|$|E

All his known degrees are from unaccredited institutions, {{and he has}} no training in paleontology. Barbara Forrest, a professor of philosophy, expert on the history of creationism and activist in the creation-evolution controversy, wrote that Hovind's lack of training makes academic discussion impossible and has said that his understanding of historical and scientific research is deficient. Patriot University is a diploma mill. Karen Bartelt, an organic chemistry professor who debated Hovind, examined Hovind's dissertation and found it is incomplete, contains numerous spelling errors, lacks references, shows flawed reasoning, and states that it does not present any original research.|$|E

60|$|Here {{it seemed}} to me that a {{conjunction}} of circumstances--first, the unfavourable season preventing migration at the proper time, and secondly, the strip of valley out of which the spiders had been driven to the higher ground till they were massed together--only served to make visible and evident that a vast annual migration takes place which we have only <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>closely</b> for to discover.|$|E
60|$|In {{about three}} minutes she {{appeared}} in sight without a veil. He discovered, as she drew nearer, a difficulty which had not struck him at first--that {{it is not an}} easy matter to particularize the colour of a stranger's eyes in a merely casual encounter on a path out of doors. That Mrs. Manston must be brought close to him, and not only so, but <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>closely</b> at him, if his purpose were to be accomplished.|$|E
60|$|It {{interested}} them to {{hear about}} the abundance and tameness of the monkeys, although it was scarcely news; but how tame they must have been when I, the stranger not to the manner born--not naked, brown-skinned, lynx-eyed, and noiseless as an owl in his movements--had yet been able <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>closely</b> at them!

60|$|At this moment, Francois {{was raising}} his father's head <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>closely</b> at him.

At the same instant Gabriel started from the wall; his {{expression}} altered, his pale cheeks flushed suddenly, as he snatched up the wicker-cased bottle, and poured all the little brandy that was left in it down his grandfather's throat.|$|E
60|$|Thorne laughed. It was a {{laugh with}} a strange, high note. It was reckless--it hinted of exaltation.

On this side of the house there was a porch opening on a plaza with trees and {{shrubbery}} and branches. Thorne peered out one window, then another. His actions were rapid. Returning to the table, he put his hands upon it and leaned over <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>closely</b> into Gale's face.|$|E

50|$|Soon enough, though, {{photography}} was not enough. Knapp began <b>to</b> <b>look</b> more <b>closely</b> at permanent materials.

60|$|As his unusual emotion subsided, these misgivings {{gradually}} melted away, though so much {{of their}} shadow remained behind, that he was constant in his resolution <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>closely</b> after Richards himself, without appearing to do so. Being now in an easier frame of mind, he regarded the woman's station as rather an advantageous circumstance than otherwise, by placing, in itself, a broad distance between her and the child, and rendering their separation easy and natural. Thence he passed to the contemplation of the future glories of Dombey and Son, and dismissed the memory of his wife, for the time being, with a tributary sigh or two.|$|E
