5|$|Members of the red-breasted {{nuthatch}} superspecies excavate their own tree holes, although most other nuthatches use natural holes or old woodpecker nests. Several species {{reduce the size}} of the entrance hole and seal up cracks with mud. The {{red-breasted nuthatch}} makes the nest secure by daubing sticky conifer resin globules around the entrance, the male applying the resin outside and the female inside. The resin may deter predators or competitors (the resident birds avoid the resin by diving straight through the entrance hole). The white-breasted nuthatch smears blister beetles around the entrance to its nest, and {{it has been suggested that}} the unpleasant smell from <b>the</b> <b>crushed</b> insects deters squirrels, its chief competitor for natural tree cavities.|$|E
5|$|Predators {{of adult}} nuthatches include owls and diurnal {{birds of prey}} (such as sharp-shinned and Cooper's hawks), and nestlings and eggs are eaten by woodpeckers, small squirrels, and {{climbing}} snakes such as the western rat snake. The white-breasted nuthatch responds to predators near the nest by flicking its wings while making hn-hn calls. When a bird leaves the nest hole, it wipes around the entrance with a piece of fur or vegetation; this makes it more difficult for a predator to find the nest using its sense of smell. The nuthatch may also smear blister beetles around the entrance to its nest, and {{it has been suggested that}} the unpleasant smell from <b>the</b> <b>crushed</b> insects deters squirrels, its chief competitor for natural tree cavities. The estimated average lifespan of this nuthatch is two years, but the record is twelve years and nine months.|$|E

40|$|Cone crushers {{are widely}} used in the mining and {{aggregates}} industries {{to reduce the size}} of blasted rock. A cone crusher consists of a fixed conic liner called concave and inside it a smaller moving liner called mantle. The mantle is suspended on an eccentrically rotating shaft. As the eccentric is turned, rock particles fed to <b>the</b> <b>crusher</b> will be squeezed and <b>crushed</b> between <b>the</b> mantle and concave. <b>The</b> <b>crushing</b> process is governed by the geometry of <b>the</b> <b>crusher</b> liners. Previous research has made it possible to model <b>the</b> <b>crushing</b> process for a given set of liners and feed rock material. This model has made it possible to optimise the geometry of <b>the</b> <b>crushing</b> chamber. A problem however is that due to wear <b>the</b> <b>crusher</b> geometry and performance will change and possibly suffer. For this reason it is desirable to be able to simulate not only <b>the</b> <b>crushing</b> process for a given <b>crusher,</b> but also <b>the</b> wear and change of performance over time. A model for this purpose is presented. <b>The</b> cone <b>crusher</b> model comprises flow, breakage, power draw, hydraulic pressure and wear. The material used in rock crusher wear parts is austenitic manganese steel, a material well known for its work hardening capability. It has been a common conception in the mining and aggregates industry that the work hardening increases as <b>the</b> <b>crushing</b> pressure against <b>the</b> liner increases. To verify this, hardness tests were performed on two mantles that were cut and grinded. Liners used to crush two different materials, granite and highly abrasive quartzite, were studied. The tests reveal that there is no variation in obtained hardness depending on crushing pressure or rock material for the studied application. <b>The</b> <b>crusher</b> model has two model parameters which need to be validated. A study was conducted in a quarry where operating conditions were tracked during the lifetime of the liners. Operating parameters are predicted with acceptable accuracy, although <b>the</b> <b>crusher</b> was run under inconsistent conditions. An important question is whether model parameters remain valid as liners are worn. The simulation results show that they do. <b>The</b> <b>crusher</b> model is useful to engineers developing new crusher liners, and for selecting an appropriate liner for a certain crushing application...|$|R

40|$|Wear in rock crushers causes great {{costs in}} the mining and {{aggregates}} industry. Change of the geometry of <b>the</b> <b>crusher</b> liners is {{a major reason for}} these costs. Being able to predict the geometry of a worn crusher will help designing <b>the</b> <b>crusher</b> liners for improved performance. A model for prediction of sliding wear was suggested by Archard in 1953. Tests have been conducted to determine the wear coefficient in Archard's model. Using a small jaw <b>crusher,</b> <b>the</b> wear of <b>the</b> <b>crusher</b> liners has been studied for different settings of <b>the</b> <b>crusher.</b> <b>The</b> experiments have been carried out using quartzite, known for being very abrasive. Crushing forces have been measured, and the motion of <b>the</b> <b>crusher</b> has been tracked along with the wear on <b>the</b> <b>crusher</b> liners. <b>The</b> test results show that the wear mechanisms are different for the fixed and moving liner. If there were no relative sliding distance between rock and liner, Archard's model would yield no wear. This is not true for rock crushing applications where wear is observed even though there is no macroscopic sliding between the rock material and the liners. For this reason, Archard's model has been modified to account for the wear induced by the local sliding of particles being <b>crushed.</b> <b>The</b> predicted worn geometry is similar to <b>the</b> real <b>crusher.</b> A cone crusher is a machine commonly used in the mining and aggregates industry.

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>crushed</b> mineral {{is treated}} with hot {{concentrated}} sulfuric acid to produce water-soluble sulfates of rare earths. The acidic filtrates are partially neutralized with sodium hydroxide to pH 3-4. Thorium precipitates out of solution as hydroxide and is removed.

The oxides are dissolved in nitric acid that excludes the main components, cerium, whose oxide is insoluble in HNO3. Neodymium oxide is separated from other rare-earth oxides by ion exchange. In this process, rare-earth ions are adsorbed onto suitable resin by ion exchange with hydrogen, ammonium or cupric ions present in the resin. The rare earth ions are then selectively washed out by suitable complexing agent, such as ammonium citrate or nitrilotracetate.|$|E
25|$|While the {{original}} specimen of Oviraptor was poorly preserved, especially <b>the</b> <b>crushed</b> and deformed skull, {{new and more}} complete oviraptorid specimens {{were assigned to the}} genus in the 1970s and 1980s.

Another specimen, IGN 100/42, is perhaps the most famous, owing to its well-preserved complete skull and large size. This specimen was referred to the genus Oviraptor by Barsbold in 1981 and came to represent Oviraptor in most popular depictions and in scientific studies of oviraptorids. However, this specimen, with its distinctive tall, cassowary-like crest, was re-examined by the scientists who described the nesting oviraptorids, and found to resemble them more closely than {{the original}} specimens of Oviraptor. For this reason, they removed IGN 100/42 from the genus Oviraptor, provisionally re-classifying it as a species of Citipati.|$|E
