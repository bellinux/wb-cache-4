5|$|Selection has {{different}} effects on traits. Stabilizing selection acts {{to hold a}} <b>trait</b> at a stable optimum, and in the simplest case all deviations from this optimum are selectively disadvantageous.

Secondly, disruptive selection is selection for extreme <b>trait</b> values and often results in two different values becoming most common, with selection against the average value. This would be when either short or tall organisms had an advantage, but not those of medium height. Finally, in stabilising selection there is selection against extreme <b>trait</b> values on both ends, which causes a decrease in variance around the average value and less diversity. This would, for example, cause organisms to slowly become all the same height.|$|E

5|$|The <b>Trait</b> du Nord is an {{endangered}} breed; the Haras de Compiègne (Compiegne Stud), a national stud in France, {{had a major}} influence in saving the breed, until it was closed in October 2009. The national breed registry for the <b>Trait</b> du Nord is supported by other local initiatives. However, breed numbers were already low when these initiatives began to be implemented, and media attention on the <b>Trait</b> du Nord is insufficient to maintain economically viable interest. The breed is bred mainly by enthusiasts returning to family farms, but even the number of farms has been decreasing as many young farmers prefer more to breed cattle, which are more lucrative.|$|E
5|$|The {{ancestors}} of the breed lived in the northern river valleys of the Sambre and the Scheldt, near Valenciennes. Although it is a popular myth that many French draft breeds, including the <b>Trait</b> du Nord, are descendants of the prehistoric horses found at Solutré, this is not true. Two or possibly three subspecies of now-extinct equines have been found at Solutré, {{but there is no}} evidence that they migrated to the area that later produced the <b>Trait</b> du Nord. Like Dutch and Belgian draft breeds such as the Brabant, the origin of the <b>Trait</b> du Nord is found in the large, fertile Flemish grasslands that cover the southern portion of the Netherlands, northern France and all of Belgium. The Hainaut region is the true birthplace of the breed in France. The Belgian draft breeds, the Ardennes and the <b>Trait</b> du Nord share the same ancestry, and the <b>Trait</b> du Nord has a history that is very similar to the Ardennes, due to the influence of the latter breed on the former. The Ardennes, Belgian, Dutch Heavy Draft, <b>Trait</b> du Nord and Auxois are all considered to come from the same group of breeds, due to their heritage, physical characteristics and selection for draft work. Until relatively recently, the breeds were not differentiated, and were frequently crossbred.|$|E

Methods: We used a wide-scale mesocosm experiment based on several assemblages of species differing in clonal <b>traits,</b> and evaluated if {{the relationship between}} biomass production and clonal <b>traits</b> is consistent at different ecological scales. Results: Results showed that at the individual level, foliar <b>traits</b> were independent from clonal <b>traits</b> in most studied species. Community specific above-ground net primary productivity was significantly correlated to community-aggregated values of clonal and foliar <b>traits.</b> Nevertheless, a stronger relationship with clonal <b>traits</b> was indicated, emphasizing a plant foraging strategy along the horizontal plant plane, which was a determinant of community productivity. An inverse relationship between clonal <b>traits</b> and biomass production was observed at the individual and community levels, which was attributed to modifications in resource acquisition processes resulting from competitive interactions.

40|$|<b>Traits</b> are {{basically}} mixins or interfaces but with method bodies.

5|$|An {{adaptation}} is an observable {{structure or}} other feature of an organism (for example, an enzyme) generated {{by natural selection}} to serve its current function. A biologist might propose the hypothesis that feathers are adaptations for bird flight. That would require three things: that the <b>trait</b> of having feathers is heritable; that the <b>trait</b> does serve the function of flight; and that the <b>trait</b> increases the fitness of the organisms that have it. Feathers clearly meet these three conditions in living birds. However, {{there is also a}} historical question, namely, did the <b>trait</b> arise {{at the same time as}} bird flight? Unfortunately for the hypothesis, this seems not to be so: theropod dinosaurs had feathers, but many of them did not fly. Feathers can be described as an exaptation, having been co-opted for flight but having evolved earlier for another purpose such as insulation. Biologists may describe both the co-option and the earlier adaptation in teleological language.|$|E

Eggshell quality <b>traits</b> were measured early (42 or 45 wk of age) or late (67 or 68 wk of age) and included specific gravity, nondestructive deformation, compression fracture strength, shell weight, and shell weight per unit surface area. Percentage of eggs remaining intact from oviposition to placement in fiber trays after being washed, candled, and sorted was measured. Economic <b>traits</b> studied included egg production <b>traits,</b> egg <b>traits,</b> and hen <b>traits.</b> All phenotypic correlations between shell quality <b>traits</b> or percentage intact and economic <b>traits</b> were low, being {{equal to or}} less than. 21. High egg production was associated with low shell quality. However, high egg production from 386 to 497 days was associated with early high percentage intact [(genetic correlation) rg =. 38, P<. 05] but was not correlated significantly with percentage intact at other ages. The egg <b>traits,</b> Haugh units and blood spots, were not associated with shell quality <b>traits</b> or percentage intact. As for hen <b>traits,</b> high BW at 365 days was associated with high shell weight (rg =. 23 and. 32, P<. 05). Other correlations involving age at first egg, viability, fertility, and hatchability were antagonistic to selection objectives in some instances, but were not significant.

40|$|Background - Autism {{spectrum}} disorder (ASD) {{and attention}} deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and associated subclinical <b>traits,</b> regularly co-occur with one another. However, the aetiology of their co-occurrence remains poorly understood. This paper provides the first genetically informative, longitudinal analysis of the interaction between <b>traits</b> of ASD and ADHD, and explores their genetic and environmental overlap. Method - Parents of approximately 5000 twin pairs completed questionnaires assessing <b>traits</b> of ASD and ADHD when twins were aged 8 and 12 years. Cross-lagged longitudinal modelling explored their developmental association, enabling a consideration of phenotypic-driven processes. Overlapping aetiological influences on <b>traits</b> at age 12 years were explored using bivariate twin modelling. Results - <b>Traits</b> of ADHD at age 8 years were more strongly predictive of <b>traits</b> of ASD at 12 years than <b>traits</b> of ASD at 8 years were of <b>traits</b> of ADHD at 12 years. Analysis of <b>traits</b> by subscales assessing specific symptom domains suggested that communication difficulties were most strongly associated with <b>traits</b> of ADHD. Bivariate modelling suggested moderate genetic overlap on <b>traits</b> in males (genetic correlation = 0. 41), and a modest degree of overlap in females (genetic correlation = 0. 23) at age 12 years. Conclusions - <b>Traits</b> of ADHD at age 8 years significantly influence <b>traits</b> of ASD at age 12 years, after controlling for their initial relationship at age 8 years. In particular, early ADHD <b>traits</b> influenced later communication difficulties. These findings demonstrate the dynamic nature of co-occurring <b>traits</b> across development. In addition, these findings add to a growing body of literature suggesting that <b>traits</b> of ASD and ADHD may arise via similar aetiological processes...|$|R
