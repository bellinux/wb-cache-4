5|$|After {{watching}} Jackass, Peter and his friends, Cleveland, Quagmire, and Joe are impressed into filming {{their own}} highly dangerous stunts. In one stunt, Peter attempts to jump a lake but instead crashes into a tree, {{causing him to}} fall into the lake and become incapacitated. Brian swims out to save him from drowning, but strains his back during the rescue and also ends up stranded in the water along with Peter, before being rescued by Joe. Lois berates Peter for his actions, since Brian is becoming old and has been smoking and drinking. Peter begins to grow upset about Brian's age so he obtains another dog and names him New Brian. His positive attitude and desirable personality make Brian feel like an outcast and Brian becomes sad that he is now unloved, and rejected. For example in one scene, when the Griffins hear New Brian fart, <b>they</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> cute and when Brian does it, they get furious and kick him out. He ultimately decides to leave the residence, while his family begins to miss him.|$|E

5000|$|Rogers died on March 24, 2007, at {{his home}} in Fremont, California. His Batman {{collaborator}} Steve Englehart said he was told by Spencer Beck, Rogers' agent, that, [...] "His son found him. <b>They</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a heart attack, and that he might have been dead for a while.” ...|$|R
50|$|Also {{the band}} was working towards perfection. They won’t release <b>it</b> if <b>they</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{not as good as}} the {{materials}} on the first LP. That helped to explain why the band had taken so long to finish their latest album. If they felt it wasn’t good enough, this album might not have been released for another five years.|$|R

Paul was {{definitely}} a fun character to play, I really had fun researching him and researching military guys and how they operate and how <b>they</b> <b>think.</b> <b>It</b> <b>was</b> just a really, really life-altering experience that I'll never forget." ...|$|R
25|$|Mearsheimer wrote a {{book that}} {{analyzes}} lying in international politics. He argues in Why Leaders Lie (Oxford University Press, 2011) that leaders lie to foreign audiences {{as well as their}} own people because <b>they</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> good for their country. For example, he maintains that President Franklin D. Roosevelt lied about the Greer incident in September 1941, because he was deeply committed to getting the United States into World War II, which he thought was in America's national interest.|$|E
500|$|The false door {{inscription}} of Shery {{might indicate}} that Peribsen is identical with king Senedj ("Senedj" [...] means [...] "the frightening") {{and that this}} name {{was used in the}} king lists by proxy, as the Seth name was forbidden mention. In contrast, Dietrich Wildung and Wolfgang Helck identify Peribsen with the Ramesside cartouche name Wadjenes. <b>They</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> possible that the name Per-ib-sen was misread from a sloppy hieratic inscription of Wadj-sen.|$|E
500|$|Ahmadzai {{used the}} {{technique}} of making the music freeze midrhythm throughout American Life, including [...] "Love Profusion". One technique was the stutter edit, which Ahmadzaï clarified was not characteristic of his production and recording. [...] "People get upset because <b>they</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> not natural to skip and stutter the music. But I {{do it because it}} is natural. The stuttering can help you create a new groove", he said. The track starts with a [...] "strummy" [...] acoustic guitar introduction, as described by Michael Paoletta from Billboard, on the four-chord progression of Bm–Fm–A–E sequence. The folk rock inspired song has elements of electronica and folk at its core. Its rhythm is [...] produced by a four piece bass drum—which fades in and out abruptly—and atmospheric synth-strings, which are added later in the song.|$|E
5000|$|The suicide has {{nevertheless}} {{continued to}} fuel speculation: then-presidential candidate Donald Trump made news in 2016 when he remarked {{in an interview}} with the Washington Post that Foster's death was [...] "very fishy", and added [...] "I will say there are people who continue to bring <b>it</b> up because <b>they</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> absolutely a murder. I don’t do that because I don’t <b>think</b> <b>it’s</b> fair.” ...|$|R
50|$|Moreover, on {{the grounds}} of the powers the king held at the time of the regal period <b>they</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> more {{probable}} that he decided without the veto of the curiae but only by the support of the collegium pontificum.and by deliberation of the senate.Some speculate that the curiae had only a function of public participation. The leges regiae were promulgated publicly at the presence of the curiae (comitia curiata).|$|R

"We {{feel we have}} {{probably}} interviewed folks in this investigation already that probably have information {{that we would like}} to have and have been reluctant to hand that information over yet," [...] county sheriff Steve Simpson told a local newspaper later in 2011.

2500|$|Intrinsic {{motivation}} {{occurs when}} people are internally motivated to do something because it either brings them pleasure, <b>they</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> important, or they feel that what they are learning is significant. [...] It {{has been shown that}} intrinsic motivation for education drops from grades 3-9 though the exact cause cannot be ascertained. [...] Also, in younger students {{it has been shown that}} contextualizing material that would otherwise be presented in an abstract manner increases the intrinsic motivation of these students.|$|E

2500|$|The {{game was}} {{frequently}} compared to Konami's Castlevania series, {{to the point}} where authors John Edgar Browning and Caroline Joan S. Picart wrote in their book Dracula in Visual Media that <b>they</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> possible that there were connections to Konami during Rusty development, but that it for some reason was not released as a Castlevania game. They also noted that the Castlevania title they thought it resembled the most – [...] – was released three months after Rusty. John Szczepaniak, writing for Hardcore Gaming 101, said that despite several similarities, no connections between Konami and C-Lab had been proven, and considered it more of an homage with high production values than a cash-in.|$|E
2500|$|Set in {{the small}} {{suburban}} town of Rosewood, Pennsylvania (not far from Philadelphia), the series follows the lives of five girls: Spencer Hastings, Alison DiLaurentis, Aria Montgomery, Hanna Marin and Emily Fields, whose clique falls apart after {{the leader of the}} group, Alison, goes missing. One year later, the remaining estranged friends are reunited as they begin receiving messages from a mysterious villain named [...] "A" [...] or [...] "A.D.", [...] who threatens and tortures them for the mistakes they have made before and after Alison's death.
