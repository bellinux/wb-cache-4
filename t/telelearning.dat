This project was undertaken to develop a <b>telelearning</b> knowledge base aimed at making specialized <b>telelearning</b> knowledge accessible to non-specialized practitioners in the field. The challenge stems from a rationale related to a user-centered approach for the software design process, which is focused on learning in the context of professional practice, the bridge to be built between expert and practitioner knowledge, as well as the knowledge valorization of the latter. In order to take into account users and their situated actions, a usage study was integrated in the analysis phase. This study allows the creation of procedural and contextual <b>telelearning</b> models, and also lists of needs.

40|$|<b>Telelearning</b> {{relates to}} "making {{connections}} among people and resources, via communication technologies, for learning-related purposes". <b>Telelearning</b> {{as a general}} term includes asynchronous learning activities; in all cases efficiency is an important construct. Efficiency {{is defined as the}} relation between costs and effects/quality. An educational system is said to be "efficient " when an optimum balance is found between minimizing the costs and maximizing the effects/quality. This balance is often difficult to obtain, for an example, when the opportunity for direct contact between tutor and tutee through telecommunications facilities can lead not only to beneficial learning and social effects but also to a large amount of messages and a huge time investment by tutors/tutees, leading to an uncontrollable rise in costs. Measuring the effect/quality of <b>telelearning</b> has its own methodological problems and therefore it is difficult to come up with viable and reliable data. How to deal with the efficiency problem is illustrated in the article based upon literature research and data from a recent project executed {{in the context of the}} telematics research program of the European Union...|$|E

40|$|The {{advance of}} the {{networking}} and the multimedia technologies are making possible {{a wide range of}} interactive applications and services to be built which may eventually change the way that people live. <b>TeleLearning</b> is one prospective area among them which has obtained lots of attentions from both the educators and the researchers. In this thesis we discuss a Multimedia Interactive <b>TeleLearning</b> System under development in the Multimedia Information Research Laboratory at the University of Ottawa. The system aims at providing a seamlessly integrated environment for <b>TeleLearning</b> using the latest telecommunication and multimedia information processing technologies. It provides a new type of learning service [...] Course On Demand, which makes learning more accessible, more flexible, and with more proper help. The system basically consists of a media production center, a courseware author site, a courseware database, a courseware user site, and an on-line facilitator site. All these components are distributed over an ATM network and work together to offer a multimedia interactive courseware service. An MHEG-based model is exploited as the system architecture to achieve the real-time, reusable information interchange through heterogeneous platforms.

Our starting point has been collaborative <b>telelearning</b> (Bourdeau & Wasson, 1997) and coordination mechanisms (Schmidt & Simone, 1996). We identify some difficulties that arise when geographically distributed teams organize joint activities by groupware tools, and we look at how various forms of coordination mechanisms address these issues. Our findings indicate that students coordinate many of their activities by informal, locally adopted resources instead of fully developed coordination mechanisms. To explain this form of behaviour we see coordination as an aspect of inter-subjectivity, and we define inter-subjectivity as a reciprocal relationship of coordination, collaboration and interaction. We discuss intersubjectivity [...] ...|$|E

40|$|We have {{analyzed}} {{data from}} a field study in collaborative <b>telelearning.</b> The participants were students from three educational institutions in Norway.

We have used concepts from collaborative <b>telelearning</b> (Bourdeau & Wasson, 1997) and coordination mechanisms (Schmidt & Simone, 1996) as framework for analysis. Our findings indicate that students coordinate many activities by implicit, locally adopted resources instead of fully developed mechanisms. Three implicit resources were identified and named (no initial discussion, asymmetry of knowledge, and different expectations). These resources were not associated with any specific groupware features, but referred to the students' background knowledge and subjective interpretation of the activity. We end the paper by suggesting how implicit resources in distributed learning environments can play a role similar to how non-verbal cues [...] such as gesture and facial expression [...] play a role in face-to-face interaction, but without imitating human body language...|$|E
40|$|The {{challenge}} facing <b>TeleLearning</b> and Distance Education {{is to support}} the essentially autonomous knowledge building process by the learner, {{while at the same}} time, emphasizing the very important collaborative dimension of learning.

We call such an architecture the Virtual Campus. A review of five LICEF's projects related to this architecture will be presented. Then, applying an object oriented modeling technique, we outline the modeling process, defining the actors of the Virtual Campus, their roles, the processes they are involved in and the computer tools they need to perform their roles. Upgrading tools and methods to support the Virtual Campus will open up and extend the traditional classroom in a very &quot;real&quot; way.

40|$|Collaborative <b>telelearning</b> {{emphasizes}} the collaborative interaction in online learning communities in-between students and facilitators. The {{nature of the}} distribution puts an heavy load on coordinating the interaction between learners (e. g working in teams), and between learners and facilitators (teachers etc). Mechanisms to support the coordination work on behalf on the students and mediate the interaction are needed to lessen this load. This {{can be done by}} designing personal assistant that keep an overview of what happens and report (and support) back to the student. Incorporated in the agent/assistant there also should be wisdom about how knowledge building communities best flourish thereby scaffolding the interaction creating richer interactions and opportunities for learning. Problem: Students have difficulties in following and structuring an cohesive joint effort/interaction on learning tasks when working collaboratively in distributed teams. This often lead to little activity, scattered contributions, alienation, and students feeling they are wasting their online time.

40|$|Abstract—In Romania, the {{diversification}} of telecommunication networks and advances in communications technologies, including the Internet, has considerable {{potential as a}} medium for telemedicine applications. In this context, The National Communication Research Institute – INSCC develops a Romanian telemedicine project, Multimedia platform for Complex medical teleservices implementation – TELMES. The main propose of this project is to implement scalable medical telecenters networks, based on the new ITC technologies available in Romania. This paper presents the concept, structure for a pilot model of a regional medical telecenters network, based on TELMES platform, and consisting from a enabling to implement applications from the complex medical teleservices category for GPs and patients. The TELMES network also includes the capability for transmission and acquisition of medical records and remotely updating the medical regional database developed within the project.

40|$|One of {{the most}} obvious and {{important}} facts for <b>TeleLearning</b> is that it depends on telecommunication and information processing technologies to exist {{as a means for}} education. Since the learning and teaching take place at a distance, there must be some medium of communication to bridge the distance. The explosive Internet provides such a channel to convey the information nationally and internationally. Multimedia capabilities in instruction significantly enhance and expand the learning opportunities and quality for the students. Integrated video, audio, image, and text create a rich new learning environment awash with possibility and a clear potential to increase student involvement in the learning process. For many years, various multimedia document models have been proposed and constructed by many researchers. In 1998, SMIL came out as a web-based international standard for synchronized multimedia document, recommended by W 3 C.
