5|$|As {{a general}} rule, {{there is no}} {{requirement}} for particular formalities in trust instruments, they can be oral or written. The only requirement is that they show an intention to create a trust. The exceptions are where it is a <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> land, the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> existing equitable interests, or where the trust is made in a will.|$|E
5|$|For contact or semi-detached binaries, the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> mass from a star to its {{companion}} {{can also}} {{result in a}} significant <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> angular momentum. The accreting companion can spin {{up to the point}} where it reaches its critical rotation rate and begins losing mass along the equator.|$|E
5|$|In {{ordinary}} circumstances, transduction, conjugation, {{and transformation}} involve <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> DNA between individual bacteria {{of the same}} species, but occasionally transfer may occur between individuals of different bacterial species and this may have significant consequences, such as the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> antibiotic resistance. In such cases, gene acquisition from other bacteria or the environment is called horizontal gene transfer and may be common under natural conditions. Gene transfer is particularly important in antibiotic resistance as it allows the rapid <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> resistance genes between different pathogens.|$|E

5|$|Molecular oxygen is {{an ideal}} {{terminal}} electron acceptor {{because it is a}} strong oxidizing agent. The reduction of oxygen does involve potentially harmful intermediates. Although the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> four electrons and four protons reduces oxygen to water, which is harmless, <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> one or two electrons produces superoxide or peroxide anions, which are dangerously reactive.|$|E
5|$|After the 1899 <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> {{services}} to the Metropolitan Railway, the MR introduced a single Brown Marshall passenger carriage on the line; unlike other stations on the line, the platform height at Wood Siding was not raised {{at this time to}} accommodate the new carriage. From 1872 to 1894 the station was served by two passenger trains per day in each direction, and from 1895 to 1899 the number was increased to three per day. Following the 1899 <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> {{services to}} the Metropolitan Railway, the station was served by four trains per day until closure in 1935.|$|E

5|$|Flagella are rigid protein structures, about 20nanometres in {{diameter}} and up to 20micrometres in length, that are used for motility. Flagella are driven by the energy released by the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> ions down an electrochemical gradient across the cell membrane.|$|E

5|$|Forensic {{examination}} of any trace evidence {{is based upon}} Locard's exchange principle. This states that every contact leaves a trace. In practice, even though a <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> material has taken place, it may be impossible to detect, because the amount transferred is very small.|$|E
5|$|Gene {{transfer}} between species {{includes the}} formation of hybrid organisms and horizontal gene transfer. Horizontal gene transfer is the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> genetic material from one organism to another organism that is not its offspring; this is most common among bacteria. In medicine, this contributes {{to the spread of}} antibiotic resistance, as when one bacteria acquires resistance genes it can rapidly transfer them to other species. Horizontal <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> genes from bacteria to eukaryotes such as the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the adzuki bean weevil Callosobruchus chinensis has occurred. An example of larger-scale transfers are the eukaryotic bdelloid rotifers, which have received a range of genes from bacteria, fungi and plants. Viruses can also carry DNA between organisms, allowing <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> genes even across biological domains.|$|E

40|$|We {{present an}} {{algorithm}} that constructs program dependence graphs {{as a program}} is parsed.

For programs that contain explicit <b>transfers</b> <b>of</b> control, our algorithm can determine whether these <b>transfers</b> <b>of</b> control are used in a structured way, and if so, compute control dependencies without explicit control flow or postdominator information. When <b>transfers</b> <b>of</b> control are ill-behaved, our algorithm adjusts the control dependence information computed during the parse, to obtain exact control dependencies. For many programs, our algorithm provides savings in time and memory, {{because it does not}} require prior computation of control flow or postdominator information. However, our algorithm also calculates control flow information during the parse, and incorporates this information into the program depend [...] ...|$|R
