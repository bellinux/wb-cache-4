40|$|Standard {{telephone}} keypads {{are labeled}} with {{letters of the}} alphabet, enabling users to enter textual data {{for a variety of}} possible applications. However, the overloading of three letters on a single key creates a potential ambiguity as to which character was intended, which must be resolved for unambiguous text entry. Existing systems all use pairs of keypresses to spell out single letters, but are extremely cumbersome and frustrating to use. Instead, we propose single-stroke text entry on telephone keypads, with the ambiguity resolved by exploiting information-theoretic constraints. We develop algorithms capable of correctly identifying up to 99 % of the characters in typical English text, sufficient for such applications as <b>telephones</b> <b>for</b> the <b>hearing-impaired,</b> E-mail without a terminal, and advanced voice-response systems.

The formulation of the research problems were: 1) what are students’ strategies to learn English especially <b>for</b> <b>hearing-impaired</b> students? 2) how do the students use strategies to learn English especially <b>for</b> <b>hearing-impaired</b> students in SLB B Negeri Tulungagung? 	The {{purpose of this study}} were to: 1) find out what students’ strategies to learn English especially <b>for</b> <b>hearing-impaired</b> students, 2) find out how the students use strategies to learn English especially <b>for</b> <b>hearing-impaired</b> students. 	Research method: 1) the research design in this study was case study design with qualitative approach, 2) the subject of this research were students in Junior High School level at SLB B Negeri Tulungagung, 3) the data was collected by using interview among the researcher and the subjects, and observation, 4) the data analysis was using data reduction, data display, also conclusion drawing and verification. 	 	The result of this study showed that every hearing-impaired student used their own strategy. Most of hearing-impaired students used three types of learning strategies (meta cognitive, cognitive, and affective/social). Most of them focused to teacher’s explanation, by read the teacher’s lip, or read the teacher’s sign/gesture. In cognitive strategy, most of them used taking notes, guessing word, practice, translation, correct spelling, and memorization. And in affective/social strategy, most of them were active learners. They used asking pairs, asking teacher, and helping pairs. In other words, learning strategy that used by hearing-impaired students covered meta cognitive, cognitive, and affective/social strategy...|$|R

40|$|Acoustic {{speech is}} marked by {{time-varying}} changes in the amplitude envelope that may pose difficulties <b>for</b> <b>hearing-impaired</b> listeners. Removal of these variations (e. g., by the Hilbert transform) could improve speech reception for such listeners, particularly in fluctuating interference. Léger, Reed, Desloge, Swaminathan, and Braida [(2015 b). J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 138, 389 – 403] observed that a normalized measure of masking release obtained <b>for</b> <b>hearing-impaired</b> listeners using speech processed to preserve temporal fine-structure (TFS) cues was larger than that for unprocessed or envelope-based speech. This study measured masking release for two other speech signals in which level variations were minimal: peak clipping and TFS processing of an envelope signal. Consonant identification was measured <b>for</b> <b>hearing-impaired</b> listeners in backgrounds of continuous and fluctuating speech-shaped noise. The normalized masking release obtained using speech with normal variations in overall level was substantially less than that observed using speech processed to achieve highly restricted level variations. These {{results suggest that the}} performance of hearing-impaired listeners in fluctuating noise may be improved by signal processing that leads to a decrease in stimulus level variations.

40|$|The {{topic of}} my {{bachelor}} thesis is: "Leisure Time Activities <b>for</b> <b>Hearing-Impaired</b> Children". The theory {{part of my}} bachelor thesis explains what hearing impairment means and the associated concepts, and it further presents special education as an academic discipline and surdopaedia as its branch. The final theory part defines the concept of leisure time and describes the organisations and institutions that offer leisure time activities. The thesis is aimed to determine the offer of leisure time activities <b>for</b> <b>hearing-impaired</b> children in České Budějovice. The research part is focused to identify how hearing-impaired children spend their leisure time, and to gather information from {{people who work with}} hearing-impaired children. To further illustrate this issue, it was necessary to find out in the organisations that offer leisure time activities whether they have some clients amongst hearing-impaired children and whether their organisations enable at all to work with such handicapped children. The research part was implemented using qualitative research and the method of controlled interview. The research was carried out in the period of four months from January to April 2011. Interviews were conducted in three target groups - the S 1 set comprised hearing-impaired children, S 2 covered teaching staff, and S 3 included organisations and specialists who offer leisure time activities, or children and youth organisations. A total of 20 interviews were conducted with hearing-impaired children, 3 interviews with school staff and the staff of the Special Education Centre <b>for</b> <b>Hearing-Impaired</b> People, 1 interview with the interpreter from the Basic Deaf Organisation, and 9 interviews with the staff of the organisations that offer leisure time activities. The research results show that children who do not depend on communication using the sign language spend their leisure time similar to their intact peers. Further it was determined that no specific afternoon club is available <b>for</b> <b>hearing-impaired</b> children in České Budějovice, but none of the approached organisations offering leisure time activities resist to work with such handicapped children. The gathered knowledge can inspire parents of hearing-impaired children to improve how their children spend leisure time. The knowledge could also be used by organisations and institutions that offer leisure time activities...|$|R

40|$|Studies {{have shown}} that {{permanent}} childhood hearing impairment can have detrimental consequences for spoken-language development. It is widely accepted that early detection and intervention may improve outcomes <b>for</b> profoundly <b>hearing-impaired</b> children. However, few studies evaluate the influence on the families or give particular attention to children with mild-to-severe hearing impairments. This research used spoken language and communication {{to focus on a}} range of factors that may influence outcomes for children with permanent sensorineural hearing impairments. In two studies, children with a range of hearing impairments, aged 32 to 85 months (mean = 63, s = 14) were audio- and video-recorded at home interacting with a major care-giver. Measures of spoken language for the children and their interlocutors were derived from transcripts. Controlling for the age of the child, spoken-language outcomes were evaluated in relation to factors such as the severity of the child's hearing impairment, age of intervention and the language addressed to the child during the interaction. The first study indicated that hearing severity, excluding profound hearing impairments, {{may not be the most}} important influence on spoken language. However, earlier intervention corresponded to better language performance. The second study failed to replicate these findings but suggested that a complex interaction of factors - including earlier referral for hearing assessment - may influence spoken language production <b>for</b> <b>hearing-impaired</b> children. Questionnaires revealed the families' attitudes and feelings towards the diagnosis of their child's hearing-impairment, showing that parents often experienced negative emotions at the time and that intervention provisions often fail to take parental attitude into consideration at this time. Results also suggested that earlier and prompt intervention for childhood hearing-impairment is viewed as beneficial and essential. This may have important implications for habilitation and intervention programmes <b>for</b> <b>hearing-impaired</b> children and their families. The conclusions suggest that further studies - which evaluate and detail the potential long-term benefits of very early intervention <b>for</b> <b>hearing-impaired</b> children - need to be conducted...|$|R
40|$|Amplitude-modulation {{detection}} thresholds (AMDTs) {{were measured}} at 40 [*]dB sensation level for listeners with mild-to-moderate {{sensorineural hearing loss}} (age: 50 - 64 [*]yr) for a carrier frequency of 500 [*]Hz and rates of 2 and 20 [*]Hz. The number of modulation cycles, N, varied between two and nine. The data were compared with AMDTs measured for young and older normal-hearing listeners [Wallaert, Moore, and Lorenzi (2016). J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 139, 3088 - 3096]. As for normal-hearing listeners, AMDTs were lower for the 2 -Hz than for the 20 -Hz rate, and AMDTs decreased with increasing N. AMDTs were lower <b>for</b> <b>hearing-impaired</b> listeners than <b>for</b> normal-hearing listeners, {{and the effect of}} increasing N was greater <b>for</b> <b>hearing-impaired</b> listeners. A computational model based on the modulation-filterbank concept and a template-matching decision strategy was developed to account for the data. The psychophysical and simulation data suggest that the loss of amplitude compression in the impaired cochlea is mainly responsible for the enhanced sensitivity and temporal integration of temporal envelope cues found <b>for</b> <b>hearing-impaired</b> listeners. The data also suggest that, for AM detection, cochlear damage is associated with increased internal noise, but preserved short-term memory and decision mechanisms. N.
