A hard-working teacher despite poor pay, within several years Sudirman had become headmaster despite not having a teacher's certificate. As a result, his monthly wages quadrupled from three gulden to twelve and a half.

5|$|Blois died on 10 May 1206, and {{was buried}} in Lincoln Cathedral. In the early fourteenth century, he was still remembered well by the cathedral chapter and was {{described}} as learned and kindly by the 14th century writer John Schalby, who wrote a work on <b>the</b> <b>lives</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bishops of Lincoln. Besides his kinsman William de Blois, another known relative was a nephew, William de Marum. Marum succeeded his uncle as rector in Durham. He was once identified with another William of Blois, who was a poet and the brother of Peter of Blois, {{but there is no}} evidence supports that identification.|$|E
5|$|By {{the second}} {{decade of the}} 21st century, the overall {{consensus}} supported the position {{that there was only}} a single author who was writing either {{at the end of the}} 4th century or the beginning of the 5th century, and who was interested in blending contemporary issues (political, religious and social) into <b>the</b> <b>lives</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 3rd century emperors. Further, that the author used the fictitious elements in the work to highlight references to other published works, such as to Cicero and Ammianus Marcellinus in a complex allegorical game. Despite these conundrums, it is the only continuous account in Latin for much of its period and is thus continually being re-evaluated, since modern historians are unwilling to abandon it as a unique source of possible information, despite its obvious untrustworthiness on many levels.|$|E
