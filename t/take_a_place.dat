25|$|In 2009, Wexford {{took part}} in Division 2 of the Allianz National Hurling League. After their shock defeat by Antrim, in which the Saffrons made a memorable comeback, Wexford {{improved}} to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> in the division final against Offaly. The yellowbellies were favourites, having beaten them earlier in the league, however Colm Bonnar's men did not perform on the day. It was a massive disappointment, meaning Wexford will be outside of hurling's top tier {{for the second year}} running. The Leinster championship arrived and Wexford had a chance for redemption with an opening round clash against Offaly. They gained revenge with Stephen Banville starring in a comfortable victory, with the aid of home advantage. Up next was Dublin and a younger more talented city side prevailed. This was followed up by defeat in the qualifiers against Limerick.|$|E

Later that day, the organizations released two press releases where they emphasized that no side suffered any casualty, stating their stance that [...] "as a revolutionary army, [...] respect the lives of anyone that is judged {{to be a victim}} of the system" [...] as well as that [...] "of those enemies that surrender or are taken as prisoners." [...] Citing these policies to establish a contrast with {{the manner in which the}} Romero administration handled the Cerro Maravilla murders and to criticize government downsizing, the EPB also warned that [...] " [...] will be implacable" [...] against anyone that [...] "exploits and betrays" [...] them or that serves as an obstacle to their goals. Later that month, during the commemoration of the Jayuya Uprising, the group published a draft notice where they claimed that it was [...] "not just another political-military organization", but [...] "a military structure being formed" [...] and warned that they intended to act [...] "in military fashion [...] guided by the laws of war". Noting their willingness to take their conflict [...] "to the final consequences, the group emphasized that it was [...] "not playing war". Directly identifying the United States [...] "and its collaborators" [...] as their enemy, the EBP stated that [...] "despite treating the public with the upmost responsibility", their sworn enemy would be subjected to trial and if necessary executed. After further distancing themselves from the modus operandi other revolutionary movement, the organization urged potential draftees to [...] "earn physical conditioning" [...] and opened the door to less militant individuals to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> within their combat units.|$|E

2500|$|This term {{is often}} used {{in the field of}} {{metallurgy}} to refer to the extent that an alloying element will dissolve into the base metal without forming a separate phase. The solvus or solubility line (or curve) is the line (or lines) on a phase diagram that give the limits of solute addition. That is, the lines show the maximum amount of a component that can be added to another component and still be in solid solution. [...] In the solid's crystalline structure, the 'solute' element can either take the place of the matrix within the lattice (a substitutional position; for example, chromium in iron) or <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> in a space between the lattice points (an interstitial position; for example, carbon in iron).|$|E
2500|$|Greece: Chrysa Koritsia: In 2008, Greek {{broadcaster}} ET1 premiered a Greek remake entitled Chrysa Koritsia ( [...] , Gold Girls), {{which features}} the four women in Greece. Each {{of the characters}} has been hellenized to suit the culture and modern setting. Names were only slightly changed, but more for cultural reasons, as Sophia (whose first name was unchanged, as it is Greek), Bela (Blanche), Dora (Dorothy), Fifi (Rose), and Panos (Stan). The series began airing in mid-January, and features many similar plots to the original. ET1 aired a rerun of the show {{in the summer of}} 2008 and managed to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> in the top-10 ratings chart, presented by AGB Nielsen Media Research. The Greek edition features Mirka Papakonstantinou as Dora, Dina Konsta as Sofia, Eleni Gerasimidou as Fifi, and Ivonni Maltezou as Bela.|$|E
2500|$|In 1889, Warren {{enrolled}} at Princeton University. [...] Warren {{was tall and}} thin, standing five feet, eleven inches tall, and weighing only 152 pounds. [...] At Princeton, Warren was switched from a halfback to a left end. [...] Despite his small size, Warren became a starter as a freshman for Princeton's football team—considered {{the best in the}} United States at the time. [...] He began in 1889 on Princeton's freshman team but was elevated to the scrub team and then the varsity before the season's end. [...] The following newspaper account describes Warren's quick progression to varsity:"In his freshman year he began work by trying for his class team. [...] His work soon caused [...] "Snake" [...] Ames, then captain of the Princeton eleven, to invite the smooth-faced youth to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> at right end on the scrub team. [...] Warren filled his position so admirably that Ames had no cause for regret when circumstances called for a new man and Warren was placed on the 'varsity team. [...] He played in the Harvard game, but it was in the memorable battle of '89 on the Berkeley Oval that the freshman distinguished himself. [...] Aided by Donnelly's splendid interference he dropped on the ball when McBride muffed it. [...] Princeton thus scored four points and Warren had established his reputation." ...|$|E

2500|$|One of Moulton's most appreciative, scholastic, and discriminating critics was Professor John Meiklejohn. He {{has said}} with {{authority}} that she {{deserved to be}} classed with the best Elizabethan lyricists in her lyrics,—with Robert Herrick and Thomas Campion and Shakespeare,—while in her sonnets she might rightly <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> with John Milton and William Wordsworth and Christina Rossetti. [...] "I cannot tell you how keen and great enjoyment (sometimes even rapture)," [...] he wrote her, [...] "I have got out of your exquisite lyrics." [...] In a series of [...] "Notes," [...] following the poems, line by line, he asserted that the poet won her success by the simplest means and plainest words, as true genius always does, and that her pages were full of emotional and imaginative meaning, Nature and Poetry uniting in an indissoluble whole; and Shelley himself, he said, {{would have been proud}} to own certain of the lines. The poem [...] "Quest" [...] he found so beautiful that, in his own words, it was [...] "difficult to speak of it in perfectly measured and unexaggerated language." [...] Of the poem [...] "Wife to Husband" [...] he said that [...] "the tenderness, the sweet and compelling rhythm, are worthy of the best Elizabethan days." [...] The sonnet, [...] "A Summer's Growth," [...] "unites," [...] he says, the [...] "passion of such Italian poets as Dante with the imagination of modern English." [...] This was in relation to her first volume, [...] "Swallow Flights"; and in conclusion he said: [...] "This poet must look for her brothers in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries among the noble and intense lyrists. Her insight, her subtlety, her delicacy, her music, are hardly matched, and certainly not surpassed by Herrick or Campion or Crashaw or Carew or Herbert or Vaughan." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1891 O'Gorman went to London {{to study}} {{electrical}} {{engineering at the}} City and Guilds Central Institution. [...] He was elected an associate member of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers in 1893, and obtained his City and Guilds diploma in 1894, his marks being amongst the best in his year. [...] On graduating he obtained a position as an assistant engineer at the Fowler, Waring Cables Company, and was sent {{to take charge of}} the company's cable networks in Ostend and Grenoble. [...] Back in England he assisted with the laying of 3000 volt systems in Salford, Leicester and Taunton, and took part in experiments on the use of celluloid as an insulator. [...] He was rapidly promoted to chief engineer, and reorganised the company's factory near London before being sent to Paris in 1895 to set up a new cable factory for a French company; in 1896 he became Fowler Waring's general manager. In 1898 Fowler Waring became part of Western Electric and O'Gorman left the company and started an engineering consultancy at 66 Victoria Street, London in partnership with E. H. Cozens-Hardy. [...] The partnership was brought to an end in October 1908 when Cozens-Hardy left London for St Helens to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> {{on the board of the}} glass manufacturers Pilkingtons. O'Gorman was a keen motorist, being an active member of the Automobile Club of Great Britain and Ireland, and he published a book on the subject, O'Gorman's Motoring Pocket Book, in 1904; he also wrote articles on motoring for The Times. In August 1908 at a race meeting at Brooklands, the mechanic accompanying one of the racers in the first O'Gorman Trophy race was killed in an accident after a Mercedes two-seater was taken high up on the banks to pass another car - both going at speed. The Mercedes lost control and careened across the track ejecting both occupants resulting in the death of the 21 year old mechanic.|$|E
