5|$|All <b>told,</b> <b>about</b> {{two dozen}} {{aircraft}} {{were involved in}} the massive search, operating from the primary search base at Minden, Nevada, with a secondary search base located at Bishop, California. CAP searchers came from Wings across the United States, including Nevada, Utah, California, Arizona, New Mexico, Idaho, Oregon, Pennsylvania and Texas.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, Sukarno recovers {{from the}} poison and is <b>told</b> <b>about</b> the Gilchrist Document, also {{being told that}} the Chinese are reneging on their {{agreement}} to supply nuclear weapons for Indonesia's confrontation with Malaysia. Sukarno uses the Gilchrist Document to spread rumours and distrust among the populace, demoting his commander of the military, while the Chinese ambassador is sent home.|$|E
5|$|I {{heard about}} drowned farms and hamlets, the ruination of the salmon-fishing and how Inverness might be washed away if the dams failed inland. I was <b>told</b> <b>about</b> the huge veins of crystal they found {{when they were}} {{tunnelling}} deep under the mountains.|$|E
60|$|Yes, that {{is better}} {{and has more}} composure. That is {{just the way it}} happened. He <b>told</b> her <b>about</b> the wet-nurse, she <b>told</b> him <b>about</b> {{political}} justice; he <b>told</b> her <b>about</b> the deadly sister-in-law, she <b>told</b> him <b>about</b> her mother; he <b>told</b> her <b>about</b> the bonnet-shop, she murmured back about the rights of woman; then he assuaged her, then she assuaged him; then he assuaged her some more, next she assuaged him some more; then they both assuaged one another simultaneously; and so they went on by the hour assuaging and assuaging and assuaging, until at last what was the result? They were in love. It will happen so every time.|$|R

5|$|In 1983, Evgeny Nikolaev's book Predavshie Gippokrata (Betrayers of Hippocrates), when {{translated}} from Russian into German {{under the title}} Gehirnwäsche in Moskau (Brainwashing in Moscow), first came out in München and <b>told</b> <b>about</b> psychiatric detention of its author for political reasons. In 1984, the book under its original title {{was first published in}} Russian which the book had originally been written in.|$|E
5|$|Fisheries Minister Brian Tobin, expressing anxiety to {{his staff}} about the {{referendum}} the week before, was <b>told</b> <b>about</b> a small rally planned in Place du Canada in Montreal for businesspersons on October 27. Asked by Federal advisor John Rae, Pierre Claude Nolin agreed to allow Tobin to invite Canadians outside Quebec to the rally, provided Quebec's referendum laws were adhered to. Tobin then encouraged fellow caucus members to send {{as many people as}} possible.|$|E
5|$|Look, I'm sorry you're dead OK? I do care. But to be {{perfectly}} honest with you, I don't care a lot. You had a choice, you took the drugs, you died. Are you seriously claiming no one warned you it was dangerous?... I mean, have you had a look at the world lately?... There's plenty of stuff going on that kills you and you don't get warned at all. So sticking your head in a crocodile you were <b>told</b> <b>about</b> is not calculated to get my sympathy.|$|E
5000|$|The {{following}} day, police interviewed Hirte's {{friends at}} school, including Wenzelow, who <b>told</b> them <b>about</b> driving past Kopitske's house with Hirte in July {{while they were}} [...] "shining for deer", and how Hirte had <b>told</b> him <b>about</b> the murder and showed him the knife.|$|R
60|$|On the Yonkers basis {{they became}} more intimate, more personal, and Dan <b>told</b> her <b>about</b> Ponkwasset Falls {{and his mother}} and sisters; he <b>told</b> her <b>about</b> his father, {{and she said she}} should like to see his father; she thought he must be like her father.|$|R

5|$|The {{plan that}} the Union {{officers}} devised was called Moss 3, {{named after the}} Pittston’s Moss 3 Preparation Plant which was its primary coal processing plant at the time. The officials were very secretive about planning this act of nonviolent strike. They wanted Pittston to know nothing about {{what was about to}} take place. Officials selected 99 union members out of Virginia, West Virginia, and Kentucky to participate in Moss 3 and the selected miners met in Virginia and were <b>told</b> <b>about</b> the plan.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{his time}} in the General Assembly, Breckinridge had battled with typhoid fever. In an 1828 letter to his wife, who was visiting {{relatives}} in Virginia, he recounted that he had been bedridden and near death for two months. Finally, in February 1829, the illness subsided. Only then could he be <b>told</b> <b>about</b> the death of his daughter, Louisiana, which had occurred a month earlier. The illness, combined with the news of the death of his daughter, caused Breckinridge to turn to religion.|$|E
5|$|Various {{stories have}} been <b>told</b> <b>about</b> Bregowine's origins, {{including}} {{that he was a}} nobleman and a continental Saxon who converted to Christianity and came to Canterbury because of the saintly reputation of Theodore of Tarsus. Others say that he owed his elevation to King Æthelbert II of Kent, but all these stories rest on works that were written after the Norman conquest of England in 1066. There are no contemporary records of Bregowine before he was archbishop. It does not appear, however, that he was of Mercian origins like his predecessors Tatwin and Nothhelm.|$|E

5|$|Although he {{was neither}} aesthetically nor {{technically}} {{among the best}} batsmen, Leyland {{had a reputation for}} batting well under pressure. He performed most effectively against the best teams and bowlers, and in difficult situations; his Test batting record is better than his first-class figures, and against Australia his average is even higher. Outside of Tests, he had some success with the ball, and {{had it not been for}} the depth of spin bowling in Yorkshire, he might have been a leading bowler. He was one of the first to bowl left-arm wrist-spin, and may have invented the name to describe such deliveries—"chinamen". Very popular with team-mates and spectators, Leyland had a reputation as a humorist, and many stories were <b>told</b> <b>about</b> him.|$|E
5|$|Baird and Jackie {{were asked}} to visit Lennon at Kenwood which was his home in Weybridge in 1964. Cynthia Lennon—Lennon's wife at the time—took them both out {{shopping}} in Knightsbridge, buying them expensive clothes. During the same visit, The Beatles played at the Finsbury Park Astoria, and the sisters asked {{to be allowed to}} stand near the front, but had to be pulled out of the audience by security guards because of the crush. In December 1965, Dykins was killed in a car crash at the bottom of Penny Lane. Lennon was not <b>told</b> <b>about</b> his death for months afterwards. Dykins had married again, but Baird acknowledges that she and Jackie had very little contact with his wife, and did not attend their father's funeral.|$|E
5|$|Bregowine (died August 764) was {{a medieval}} Archbishop of Canterbury. Little {{is known of}} his origins or his {{activities}} as archbishop, although a number of stories were <b>told</b> <b>about</b> his possible origins after the Norman conquest in 1066. There are no records of him prior to his becoming archbishop. He possibly owed his elevation to the Kentish monarch. The records after his elevation to Canterbury are mainly about disputes over land, but knowledge {{of his time in}} office is hampered by the destruction of many of the contemporary records. After his death, he was considered a saint and a life about him was written in the 12thcentury.|$|E

5|$|Harris, then host of Rolf's Cartoon Time, {{approached}} the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC) and the Tavistock Clinic with his idea {{about making a}} film on child sexual abuse. Both organisations were receptive. Harris had previous connections with the NSPCC, having appeared in films in 1963 and 1973 promoting the NSPCC League of Pity, and a NSPCC official suggested that he use child actors in Kids Can Say No! Harris approached director Jessica Skippon, {{with whom he had}} made a film about water safety, and said that he wanted to make Kids Can Say No! to protect children. Harris later said that production was hampered by colleagues opposing the idea that children should be <b>told</b> <b>about</b> sexual abuse.|$|E
5|$|In 1971, the Pentagon Papers, {{a secret}} United States Department of Defense {{history of the}} United States' {{political}} and military involvement in the Vietnam War from 1945 to 1967, were given ("leaked") to Neil Sheehan of The New York Times by former State Department official Daniel Ellsberg, with his friend Anthony Russo assisting in copying them. The New York Times began publishing excerpts {{as a series of}} articles on June 13. Controversy and lawsuits followed. The papers revealed, among other things, that the government had deliberately expanded its role in the war by conducting air strikes over Laos, raids along the coast of North Vietnam, and offensive actions taken by U.S. Marines well before the public was <b>told</b> <b>about</b> the actions, all while President Lyndon B. Johnson had been promising not to expand the war. The document increased the credibility gap for the U.S. government, and hurt efforts by the Nixon administration to fight the ongoing war.|$|E
5|$|In mid-1943 the District Engineer of the Manhattan Engineer District, Lt-Col Kenneth Nichols {{had several}} queries from Canada {{relating}} to contracts Canadian firms Eldorado Gold Mines and Consolidated Mining and Smelting (CMS of Cominco) {{had for the}} secret atomic bomb project; CMS was building a heavy water plant and Eldorado was mining and processing uranium ore. He phoned a C. D. Howe in Ottawa and arranged to travel on the overnight train to Ottawa and see Howe the next day (June 14). On arriving at the address given Nichols {{was surprised to find}} that Howe was the minister of munitions and supply, and found him most friendly. Howe was <b>told</b> <b>about</b> the Manhattan Project, and Nichols was told that Eldorado was now a Crown company.|$|E

5|$|It was {{considered}} {{more likely that}} Germany might employ such weapons against the United Kingdom, so four officers from the European Theater of Operations United States Army (ETOUSA) were summoned to Chicago where {{they were given a}} top secret briefing by the Manhattan District's Chicago area engineer, Major Arthur V. Peterson. They were <b>told</b> <b>about</b> possible forms such an attack might take, and what the effects and symptoms of them were, and they were given survey instruments and shown how to use them. They were enjoined to tell other officers in the theater to report unexplained fogging of film or illnesses with symptoms corresponding to the effects of radiation sickness.|$|E
5|$|Later {{commenting on}} this source, Maylam {{highlighted}} that its author {{did not appear}} to be from Kent and that, from their use of wording, it appeared that they had been <b>told</b> <b>about</b> the tradition by locals but had not actually witnessed it first hand. As such, Maylam suggested that the author may have been wrong in describing the use of a horse's skull in the Ramsgate tradition, given that both later sources and the hoodeners of his own time all used a wooden model of a horse's head. At the same time, Maylam noted that the use of a horse's skull was not impossible, for such skulls had also been used in the hobby horse traditions of other parts of Britain.|$|E
5|$|Mayer was {{introduced}} to topology by his colleague Vietoris when attending his lectures in 1926 and 1927 at a local university in Vienna. He was <b>told</b> <b>about</b> the conjectured result {{and a way to}} its solution, and solved the question for the Betti numbers in 1929. He applied his results to the torus considered as the union of two cylinders. Vietoris later proved the full result for the homology groups in 1930 but did not express it as an exact sequence. The concept of an exact sequence only appeared in print in the 1952 book Foundations of Algebraic Topology by Samuel Eilenberg and Norman Steenrod where the results of Mayer and Vietoris were expressed in the modern form.|$|E
50|$|Meanwhile, the Goodwins <b>told</b> {{investigators}} <b>about</b> Roth's having seduced {{their daughter}} {{and of a}} staged burglary he'd conducted on his own house in 1988 for insurance money, but had <b>told</b> nobody <b>about</b> this before {{because they were afraid}} of him. Roth had also carried on an affair with his son's babysitter for years, but her husband did nothing either for the same reason.|$|R
