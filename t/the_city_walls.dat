5|$|Despite Canterbury's walls, a Viking army {{successfully}} {{attacked the}} city in 835, killing many of the inhabitants. Scandinavian raids recommenced from 991 onwards and in 1011 a Danish army demanded fresh tribute from the city. <b>The</b> <b>city</b> <b>walls</b> were used to defend the city during an 11-day siege, and the chronicler Roger of Hoveden recounts how the attacking Danes were thrown off {{the tops of the}} walls to their deaths by the citizens. Roger's account may be an exaggeration, but the story shows that <b>the</b> <b>city</b> <b>walls</b> were in sufficiently good condition for such a story to be considered plausible at the time. After a fire broke out in the city, however, the Danes entered and pillaged Canterbury.|$|E

It was abandoned in the Ming dynasty when Beijing was rebuilt and slightly shifted to the south. The northern segment of <b>the</b> <b>city</b> <b>wall</b> is preserved, and a narrow and long park was created around the ruin of <b>the</b> <b>city</b> <b>wall</b> in Haidian District and Chaoyang District.|$|R

5|$|The city's first {{stone was}} laid by Grand Master Jean de Valette on 28 March 1566, {{and the new}} city was called Valletta in his honour. <b>The</b> <b>city</b> <b>walls</b> {{were among the first}} {{structures}} to be built within the city, and were largely complete by the 1570s. Some changes were made to the design while the city was being constructed, and only two cavaliers were constructed, while the arsenal and Manderaggio were never built. Fort St. Elmo, which had been severely damaged in the 1565 siege, was also rebuilt and integrated in <b>the</b> <b>city</b> <b>walls.</b>|$|E

5|$|The two armies met near Peritheorion on 7 July 1345. Momchil {{tried to}} seek refuge behind the city's walls— {{scholars}} debate whether he actually held {{the city or}} not— but they were shut against him and his men by the locals. The locals did let in Momchil's cousin Rayko along with 50 men, which they hoped would persuade Momchil not to take vengeance on the city if he defeated his opponents. In the subsequent battle before <b>the</b> <b>city</b> <b>walls,</b> Momchil's forces used the Peritheorion's ruined old fortifications as a first line of defence, with <b>the</b> <b>city</b> <b>walls</b> behind them.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>City</b> <b>Wall</b> of Nanjing (...) was {{designed}} by Emperor Zhu Yuanzhang (r. 1328-1398) after he founded the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) and established Nanjing as the capital 600 years ago. To consolidate his sovereignty and keep out invaders, he adopted the suggestions of advisor Zhu Sheng to build a higher <b>city</b> <b>wall,</b> to collect grains and to postpone the coronation. Then, he started to build <b>the</b> <b>city</b> <b>wall.</b> It took 21 years to complete, and used 200,000 laborers to move 7 million cubic metres of earth. <b>The</b> <b>City</b> <b>Wall</b> of Nanjing was among <b>the</b> largest <b>city</b> <b>walls</b> ever constructed in China.

5|$|During the night, Pyrrhus {{was able}} to enter Argos. While Pausanias recounts that he did so by force, Plutarch asserts that Diamperes Gate had been left open for the Epiriotes by Aristeas. Hammond opines {{that it is more}} likely that Aristeas {{admitted}} Pyrrhus into the city. Although Pyrrhus' Gauls were able to occupy the Argive agora, the rest of the army was delayed due to the war elephants being too large to pass through the gate. In order for them to enter, the towers need to be taken off their backs and reattached once they were inside the city. Furthermore, Pyrrhus left the majority of his army outside <b>the</b> <b>city</b> <b>walls</b> under the command of his son Helenus. This delay gave the Argives enough time to reach their citadel, the Aspis, and seek aid from Antigonus. The Macedonian king responded immediately, advancing towards <b>the</b> <b>city</b> <b>walls</b> and sending a relief force inside under the command of his son Halcyoneus.|$|E
5|$|In 1565, the Ottomans {{attacked}} {{again in}} the Great Siege of Malta. Fort Saint Elmo fell after fierce fighting (in which the Ottoman general Dragut Reis was killed), but the knights held out in Birgu and Senglea until a relief force arrived. By {{the end of the}} siege, most of the fortifications had been destroyed in the attacks, so they were rebuilt. The Grand Master, Jean Parisot de Valette, decided to build a new fortified capital on the Sciberras Peninsula. The first stone of the new city was laid down in 1566, and it was called Valletta. <b>The</b> <b>city</b> <b>walls,</b> which were constructed mainly in the 1560s and 1570s, remain largely intact to this day, and they include bastions, cavaliers, counterguards and a ditch. The ruined Fort Saint Elmo was rebuilt and integrated into <b>the</b> <b>city</b> <b>walls.</b> The area around St Elmo was strengthened a number of times later on in the 17th century, especially by the building of the Carafa Enceinte in 1687.|$|E

5|$|News soon {{spread of}} {{thousands}} of Chinese joining forces with Javanese soldiers in Grobogan, outside of Semarang. On 1 May, Visscher was accosted by Captain Rudolph Carel von Glan, a unit leader, asking why Visscher had done nothing {{to deal with the}} uprising. Visscher heatedly replied that it was not Glan's business. The following day, after being questioned by prosecutor Jeronimus Tonnemans Jr., Yonko, and Anko, Visscher became increasingly angry, breaking a table in half and yelling at his Chinese advisers. When Yanko disappeared after the meeting, Anko told Visscher that he had joined the rebelling Chinese. This caused Visscher, who had heavily invested in Yonko and had left a large amount of money with him, to take out his carriage and scream to the residents of Semarang to escape while it was still possible. This continued until he crashed into <b>the</b> <b>city</b> <b>walls.</b> The residents ran away from Semarang in a panic, leaving eight loaded cannons outside <b>the</b> <b>city</b> <b>walls.</b>|$|E

25|$|Long-term {{strategic}} considerations {{meant that}} <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> of important <b>cities</b> often enclosed an area {{much larger than}} existing urban areas {{in order to ensure}} excess capacity for growth, and to secure resources such as timber and farmland in times of war. <b>The</b> <b>city</b> <b>wall</b> of Quanzhou in Fujian still contained one quarter vacant land by 1945. <b>The</b> <b>city</b> <b>wall</b> of Suzhou by the Republic of China era still enclosed large tracts of farmland. <b>The</b> <b>City</b> <b>Wall</b> of Nanjing, built during the Ming dynasty, enclosed an area large enough to house an airport, bamboo forests, and lakes in modern times.|$|R
