Cattle owners do not always recall the era prior to the 1980 s fondlye, as some recall that government veterinarians would sometimes supply drugs and vaccines on credit, only to seize the animals when bills went unpaid. Nonetheless, cattle owners in the focus group participants agreed that treatment was more reliable and cheaper in those decades, as a tightly controlled and subsidised supply chain left little room <b>for</b> <b>substandard</b> <b>products.</b>|$|R
30|$|In many ways, the {{veterinary}} drug sector faces similar problems {{but as a}} research topic has been even more neglected. The International Federation for Animal Health reports that the trade in unregistered and substandard {{veterinary drug}}s is worth $ 400 million annually - a size similar to the legitimate market (FAO 2012). Other disease-specific studies have warned {{of the availability of}} fake products (e.g. Melaku and Birasa 2013), whilst other research has subjected samples purchased to laboratory testing (e.g. Chaka et al. 2009; Gberindyer et al. 2014). Importantly, <b>substandard</b> <b>products</b> which contain some active ingredient but at a lower-than-specified level ‘are not only less effective when used by farmers, but also greatly increase the risk of drug resistance developing’ (Geerts et al. 2001 : 28; see also Waller et al. 1996 : 184). As well as the direct harm caused by poor drug quality and treatment failure, many industry actors interviewed emphasised that a large market <b>for</b> <b>substandard</b> or fake <b>products</b> acted as a major disincentive for the development of new products. A preponderance of fake and <b>substandard</b> <b>products</b> might even imperil the continued manufacturing of genuine drugs, should those ‘brand name’ drugs continue to lose ground in the marketplace.|$|R
40|$|MEDLINE?? is {{the source}} for the MeSH terms of this document. The influx of {{medicines}} from different sources into healthcare systems of developing countries presents a challenge to monitor their origin and quality. The absence of a repository of reference samples or spectra prevents the analysis of tablets by direct comparison. A set of paracetamol tablets purchased in Malaysian pharmacies were compared to a similar set of sample purchased in the UK using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). Additional samples of products containing ibuprofen or paracetamol {{in combination with other}} actives were added to the study as negative controls. NIR spectra of the samples were acquired and compared by using multivariate modeling and classification algorithms (PCA/SIMCA) and stored in a spectral database. All analysed paracetamol samples contained the purported active ingredient with only 1 out of 20 batches excluded from the 95 % confidence interval, while the negative controls were clearly classified as outliers of the set. Although the <b>substandard</b> <b>products</b> were not detected in the purchased sample set, our results indicated variability in the quality of the Malaysian tablets. A database of spectra was created and search methods were evaluated for correct identification of tablets. The approach presented here can be further developed as a method <b>for</b> identifying <b>substandard</b> pharmaceutical <b>products.</b> ?? 2011 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

Although such risk classification can substantially increase a company's profitability, {{these products are}} uncommon except for the well established U. K. market.

Second, we propose a theoretical model to determine the optimal profit-maximizing risk classification system <b>for</b> <b>substandard</b> annuities.

40|$|The {{practice}} of medicine has always been characterized by uncertainty. Yet, attempts to study <b>tolerance</b> <b>for</b> uncertainty in medicine have been few, and limited to its influence on specialty preferences and test-ordering behavior. In particular, studies have not investigated how the process of socialization into the medical profession affects <b>tolerance</b> <b>for</b> uncertainty. Based {{on the assumption that}} uncertainty and ambiguity are related concepts, a modified version of a <b>tolerance</b> <b>for</b> ambiguity scale was used to study Johns Hopkins medical students' (N = 386) <b>tolerance</b> <b>for</b> ambiguity (TFA) through 4 yr of medical school. In addition, using alcoholism {{as an example of a}} clinically ambiguous condition, the association between students' <b>tolerance</b> <b>for</b> ambiguity and their perceived role in diagnosing and treating alcoholism was also investigated. Results indicate that <b>tolerance</b> <b>for</b> ambiguity (1) does not change throughout medical school, (2) is lower among men, whites and students who are younger when they begin medical school, (3) is higher among prospective psychiatrists than surgeons, and (4) is lower among students who do not feel responsible for diagnosing and treating alcoholism. These findings suggest that <b>tolerance</b> <b>for</b> ambiguity may, indeed, affect practitioners' career choices and performance and that selection of medical students may be more important than medical training per se in influencing students' <b>tolerance</b> <b>for</b> ambiguity. If medical schools admitted students who possess a high <b>tolerance</b> <b>for</b> ambiguity, quality of care for ambiguous conditions might improve, imbalances in physician supply and practice patterns might be reduced, and the increasing ambiguity in medical practice might be better acknowledged and accepted. uncertainty professional socialization medical education medical students' attitudes alcoholism specialty choice...|$|R
