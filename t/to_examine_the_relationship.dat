25|$|A 2001 study, {{conducted}} by Aagaard et al., utilized MRI, ultrasonography and muscle biopsy techniques <b>to</b> <b>examine</b> <b>the</b> <b>relationship</b> between muscle architecture, contractile strength and pennation angle {{in the human}} quadriceps muscle after 14 weeks of resistance training. Upon completion of the training program, Aagaard et al. noticed a symmetrical increase in quadriceps CSA and volume, as each increased 10.2 and 10.3 percent respectively; however, these parameters increased disproportionately to quadriceps PCSA, which grew 16 percent. The rapid increase in PCSA {{was accompanied by a}} 35.5% increase in the fascicle pennation angle of the vastus lateris, one of the major quadriceps muscles, as well as a 16% increase in myofiber CSA. The increase in pennation angle in the vastus lateris resulted in an increase to the muscle’s PCSA, a measure proportional to the contractile force a pennate muscle is capable of producing. Work by Azizi et al. suggests this increase in pennation angle of the vastus lateris following resistance training generates an increase in the muscle’s AGR, a property which allows the whole muscle to contract with a higher velocity.|$|E
25|$|Long-term {{decreasing}} {{rates in}} fertility and increasing life expectancy could have damaging consequences for almost every European nation. One consequence of ageing might be lower inflation rates as elderly {{people are more}} inflation averse and have sufficient political power for governments to care about their preferences. These demographic trends provoked debate over the best policies that can reverse these trends and lessen their consequences. RAND Europe, an independent not-for-profit research institute, was able to collect these policies through research and analysis. There were three broad policy approaches that were generated from the debate. The first policy is to encourage childbearing among younger couples that involves marriage and cohabitation. The second policy states {{that there should be}} an increase in the immigration of working-age people. Thirdly, there should be an improvement of social policy in general, to mitigate negative consequences of these trends. The research intends <b>to</b> <b>examine</b> <b>the</b> <b>relationship</b> between demographic trends and European government policies and determine which policies can reduce the consequences of low fertility and population ageing.|$|E
25|$|While most {{molecular}} epidemiology studies are still using conventional disease diagnosis and classification systems, {{it is increasingly}} recognized that disease evolution represents inherently heterogeneous processes differing from person to person. Conceptually, each individual has a unique disease process {{different from any other}} individual (“the unique disease principle”), considering uniqueness of the exposome (a totality of endogenous and exogenous / environmental exposures) and its unique influence on molecular pathologic process in each individual. Studies <b>to</b> <b>examine</b> <b>the</b> <b>relationship</b> between an exposure and molecular pathologic signature of disease (particularly cancer) became increasingly common throughout the 2000s. However, the use of molecular pathology in epidemiology posed unique challenges including lack of research guidelines and standardized statistical methodologies, and paucity of interdisciplinary experts and training programs. Furthermore, the concept of disease heterogeneity appears to conflict with the long-standing premise in epidemiology that individuals with the same disease name have similar etiologies and disease processes. To resolve these issues and advance population health science in the era of molecular precision medicine, “molecular pathology” and “epidemiology” was integrated to create a new interdisciplinary field of “molecular pathological epidemiology” (MPE), defined as “epidemiology of molecular pathology and heterogeneity of disease”. In MPE, investigators analyze the relationships between; (A) environmental, dietary, lifestyle and genetic factors; (B) alterations in cellular or extracellular molecules; and (C) evolution and progression of disease. A better understanding of heterogeneity of disease pathogenesis will further contribute to elucidate etiologies of disease. The MPE approach can be applied to not only neoplastic diseases but also non-neoplastic diseases. The concept and paradigm of MPE have become widespread in the 2010s.|$|E

500|$|Keynes {{had begun}} a {{theoretical}} work <b>to</b> <b>examine</b> <b>the</b> <b>relationship</b> between unemployment, money and prices {{back in the}} 1920s. The work, Treatise on Money, was published in 1930 in two volumes. A central idea of the work was that if {{the amount of money}} being saved exceeds the amount being invested – which can happen if interest rates are too high – then unemployment will rise. This is in part a result of people not wanting to spend too high a proportion of what employers pay out, making it difficult, in aggregate, for employers to make a profit. Another key theme of the book is the unreliability of financial indices for representing an accurate – or indeed meaningful – indication of general shifts in purchasing power of currencies over time. In particular he criticised the justification of Britain's return to the gold standard in 1925 at pre-war valuation by reference to the wholesale price index. He argued that the index understated the effects of changes in the costs of services and of labour. In 1927 he wrote, [...] "We will not have any more crashes in our time." ...|$|E
