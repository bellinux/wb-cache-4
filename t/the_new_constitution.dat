5|$|On September 7, 1874, <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>constitution</b> was {{completed}} {{and signed by}} a majority of delegates. The entire electorate, including the disenfranchised Confederates and the Freedmen, voted. The election not only was for ratification of <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>constitution</b> but also for state officials that would be elected if the constitution was indeed ratified. The Republicans actually took the same position that the Democrats had taken earlier, believing that the election was illegal they nominated no candidates. Conservative Democrats and allied paramilitary groups suppressed black voting, using a combination of intimidation, blocking blacks from the polls, and outright assassinations. <b>The</b> <b>new</b> <b>constitution</b> was ratified on October 13, 1874 and Democratic officials elected almost unanimously, including new Democratic Governor Augustus H. Garland who was inaugurated November 12, 1874, and Baxter left office after only serving two years of a four-year term.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> Parliament of <b>New</b> Zealand adopted <b>the</b> Statute of Westminster {{by passing}} its Statute of Westminster Adoption Act 1947 in November 1947. <b>The</b> <b>New</b> Zealand <b>Constitution</b> Amendment Act, passed the same year, {{empowered}} <b>the</b> <b>New</b> Zealand parliament {{to change the}} constitution, but did not remove {{the ability of the}} British parliament to legislate regarding <b>the</b> <b>New</b> Zealand <b>constitution.</b> <b>The</b> remaining role of the British parliament was removed by <b>the</b> <b>New</b> Zealand <b>Constitution</b> Act 1986 and the Statute of Westminster was repealed in its entirety.|$|R
5|$|After {{being pushed}} back repeatedly, a {{constitutional}} referendum {{was held on}} 17 November 2010 that resulted in adoption of the state's fourth constitution with 73% in favor and a voter turnout of 52.6%. The independent Malagasy political watchdog group KMF-CNOE, {{as well as the}} political opposition and the international community, cited numerous irregularities in the process, which was carried out unilaterally by the HAT. The constitution in effect at the time Rajoelina took office required that presidential candidates attain a minimum of 40 years of age. One substantive change made by <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>constitution</b> was to lower the minimum age for presidential candidates from 40 to 35, making Rajoelina eligible to stand in presidential elections. In addition, <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>constitution</b> mandated the leader of the High Transitional Authority – the position held by Rajoelina – be kept as interim president until an election could take place. <b>The</b> <b>new</b> <b>constitution</b> also contained a clause that required presidential candidates to have lived in Madagascar for at least six months prior to the elections, effectively barring Ravalomanana and other opposition leaders living in exile from running in the next election. After being repeatedly postponed, the general election was held on 25 October 2013.|$|E
5|$|In 1851, a {{new state}} {{constitution}} was created and ratified. Among the constitution's new clauses was {{an extension of the}} terms of representatives to two years and senators to four years. It also made many of the previously appointed positions open to public election. <b>The</b> <b>new</b> <b>constitution</b> delegated many minor tasks to newly created elected offices. With its workload considerably decreased, instead of meeting annually, the General Assembly only convened a session every two years. <b>The</b> <b>new</b> <b>constitution</b> also placed new limits on the General Assembly's power to create local laws, the General Assembly having become notorious for creating state level laws that were only applied to one town or county.|$|E
5|$|Nasser's {{nomination}} {{for the post}} and <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>constitution</b> were put to public referendum on 23 June and each was approved by an overwhelming majority. A 350-member National Assembly was established, elections for which were held in July 1957. Nasser had ultimate approval over all the candidates. The constitution granted women's suffrage, prohibited gender-based discrimination, and entailed special protection {{for women in the}} workplace. Coinciding with <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>constitution</b> and Nasser's presidency, the RCC dissolved itself and its members resigned their military commissions as part of the transition to civilian rule. During the deliberations surrounding the establishment of a new government, Nasser began a process of sidelining his rivals among the original Free Officers, while elevating his closest allies to high-ranking positions in the cabinet.|$|E

5|$|Aside {{from his}} {{opposition}} to slavery, Garrard did not take a particularly {{active role in the}} convention's proceedings.

5|$|During the {{preparation}} of <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>constitution</b> for West Germany, discussions regarding its national symbols took place in August 1948 during a meeting at Herrenchiemsee. Although there were objections {{to the creation of}} a national flag before reunification with the east, it was decided to proceed. This decision was primarily motivated by the proposed constitution by the eastern SED in November 1946, where black-red-gold were suggested as the colours for a future German republic.|$|E

5|$|Lieutenant-Colonel J. S. V. Hickman {{took over}} from Caine as {{commanding}} officer on 26 August 1968 {{and the rest}} of the year was uneventful for the RLI. The same was not true, however, for the Rhodesian government, which on 20 September 1968 accepted an invitation from Wilson for a new round of talks, this time aboard HMS Fearless, anchored off Gibraltar, for four days starting on 9 October 1968. These ended without agreement on the evening of 13 October 1968, when Smith flew back to Rhodesia. Unsuccessful attempts by both sides to salvage an accord from the Fearless talks continued for months afterwards but ultimately Smith's government resolved that compromise was impossible. It prepared a new constitution of its own and on 20 June 1969 called a constitutional referendum, polling public opinion on both <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>constitution</b> and the adoption of a republican form of government. The electorate firmly backed both of these proposals. As a result, Rhodesia became a republic with <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>constitution</b> in place on 2 March 1970.|$|E
5|$|Soon Vladimir Bukovsky {{was again}} out of favour with the Russian authorities.

According to Bukovsky, Yeltsin became a hostage of the security agencies from 1994 onwards, and a restoration of KGB rule was inevitable.|$|E

5|$|The Third Amendment was {{introduced}} in Congress in 1789 by James Madison {{as a part of}} the United States Bill of Rights, in response to Anti-Federalist objections to <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>Constitution.</b> Congress proposed the amendment to the states on September 28, 1789, and by December 15, 1791, the necessary three-quarters of the states had ratified it. Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson announced the adoption of the amendment on March 1, 1792.|$|E
5|$|There {{was growing}} resentment amongst Tamils at the monopolisation of {{political}} and economic power by the Sinhalese. As a result, Tamil parties started coming together and on 14 May 1972 the ITAK, ACTC, Ceylon Workers' Congress, Eelath Thamilar Otrumai Munnani and All Ceylon Tamil Conference met in Trincomalee and formed the Tamil United Front (TUF) with Chelvanayakam as its president. The TUF MPs boycotted the ceremonial opening of the National State Assembly (NSA) on 22 May 1972, the day <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>constitution</b> was promulgated. In October 1972 Chelvanayakam informed the NSA that he was resigning his parliamentary seat and would seek re-election on the issue of <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>constitution</b> which he claimed had been rejected by the Tamils. The government delayed holding a by-election in Chelvanayakam's constituency, citing the possibility of violence, which resulted in Chelvanayakam being exiled from Parliament for nearly two and half years. Chelvanayakam wrote to Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike on 4 November 1973 stating that the election would be peaceful and that the government's supporters could campaign freely. Bandaranaike did not respond.|$|E

5|$|According to the {{memoirs of}} Ken Flower, then the {{director}} of Rhodesia's Central Intelligence Organisation (CIO), Harper's downfall {{was the result of}} an extramarital affair with a young secretary in the Rhodesian civil service who the CIO discovered was an agent for MI6. Flower informed Smith of this on 3 July and the Prime Minister demanded Harper's resignation that afternoon; Harper acquiesced the next day. Because this was kept secret (presuming it is true), Harper's sudden departure from the Cabinet was interpreted by many observers at the time as the culmination of the personal and political rivalry between Smith and Harper, or the result of disagreements over <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>constitution.</b>|$|E
5|$|Adams was {{concerned}} about <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>Constitution</b> and made an attempt to re-enter national politics. He allowed his name to be put forth {{as a candidate for}} the United States House of Representatives in the December 1788 election, but lost to Fisher Ames, apparently because Ames was a stronger supporter of the Constitution, a more popular position. Despite his defeat, Adams continued to work for amendments to the Constitution, a movement that ultimately resulted in the addition of a Bill of Rights in 1791. Adams subsequently became a firm supporter of the Constitution, with these amendments and the possibility of more.|$|E
5|$|After {{his service}} in the House, Brown took a break from politics, but re-entered the {{political}} arena {{as a candidate for}} governor of Kentucky in 1891. He secured the Democratic nomination in a four-way primary election, then convincingly won the general election over his Republican challenger, Andrew T. Wood. Brown's administration, and the state Democratic Party, were split between gold standard supporters (including Brown) and supporters of the free coinage of silver. Brown's was also the first administration to operate under the Kentucky Constitution of 1891, and most of the legislature's time was spent adapting the state's code of laws to <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>constitution.</b> Consequently, little of significance was accomplished during Brown's term.|$|E
