5|$|Ida is {{a member}} of the Koronis family of asteroid-belt asteroids. Ida orbits <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>at</b> an average {{distance}} of , between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. Ida takes 4.84089 years to complete one orbit.|$|E
5|$|Venus, with {{an orbit}} {{inclined}} by 3.4° {{relative to the}} Earth's, usually appears to pass under (or over) <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>at</b> inferior conjunction. A transit occurs when Venus reaches conjunction with <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>at</b> or near one of its nodes—the longitude where Venus passes through the Earth's orbital plane (the ecliptic)—and appears to pass directly across the Sun. Although the inclination between these two orbital planes is only 3.4°, Venus can be as far as 9.6° from the Sun when viewed from the Earth at inferior conjunction. Since the angular diameter of the Sun is about half a degree, Venus may appear to pass above or below the Sun by more than 18 solar diameters during an ordinary conjunction.|$|E
5|$|A sungrazing comet is a comet {{that passes}} {{extremely}} close to <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>at</b> perihelion, generally {{within a few}} million kilometres. Although small sungrazers can be completely evaporated during such a close approach to the Sun, larger sungrazers can survive many perihelion passages. However, the strong tidal forces they experience often lead to their fragmentation.|$|E

5000|$|The day arcs at 70° latitude. At local noon <b>the</b> winter <b>Sun</b> culminates <b>at</b> −3.44°, and <b>the</b> summer <b>Sun</b> <b>at</b> 43.44°. Said another way, during <b>the</b> winter <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> {{does not}} {{rise above the}} horizon, it is the polar night. There will be still a strong {{twilight}} though.

5|$|After Kepler-40b was confirmed, the French and Swiss science team {{worked to}} clarify the stellar {{parameters}} its star by analyzing the star's spectrum as collected by SOPHIE. Kepler-40 is the sixth known planetary host star with a radius of more than 1.8 times that of <b>the</b> <b>Sun.</b> <b>At</b> {{the time of its}} discovery, Kepler-40 was the most evolved star known to have a transiting planet.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} first {{millennium}} BC, Babylonian astronomers {{observed that the}} Sun's motion along the ecliptic is not uniform, though {{they did not know}} why; it is today known that {{this is due to the}} movement of Earth in an elliptic orbit around the Sun, with Earth moving faster when it is nearer to <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>at</b> perihelion and moving slower when it is farther away at aphelion.|$|E
5|$|Kepler was {{the first}} to devise a system that {{described}} correctly the details of the motion of the planets with <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>at</b> the center. However, Kepler did not succeed in formulating a theory behind the laws he wrote down. It was left to Newton's invention of celestial dynamics and his law of gravitation to finally explain the motions of the planets. Newton also developed the reflecting telescope.|$|E

In addition, with an orbital inclination of 86.3º, Kepler-5b orbits Kepler-5 almost edge-on with respect to Earth. In comparison, planet Mercury orbits <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>at</b> a distance of 0.387 AU every 87.97 days.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} solar missions to date has been the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory, jointly built by the European Space Agency and NASA and launched on 2 December 1995. Originally intended to serve a two-year mission, a mission extension through 2012 was approved in October 2009. It has proven so useful that a follow-on mission, the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), was launched in February 2010. Situated at the Lagrangian point between Earth and <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> (<b>at</b> which the gravitational pull from both is equal), SOHO has provided a constant view of <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>at</b> many wavelengths since its launch. Besides its direct solar observation, SOHO has enabled the discovery {{of a large number of}} comets, mostly tiny sungrazing comets that incinerate as they pass the Sun.|$|E
5|$|Plutoids are {{celestial}} {{bodies in}} orbit around <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>at</b> a semi-major axis {{greater than that of}} Neptune that have sufficient mass for their self-gravity to overcome rigid body forces so that they assume a hydrostatic equilibrium (near-spherical) shape, and that have not cleared the neighbourhood around their orbit. Satellites of plutoids are not plutoids themselves.|$|E

5|$|The MESSENGER {{space probe}} may provide {{evidence}} regarding vulcanoids. Its opportunities {{will be limited}} because its instruments need to be pointed away from <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>at</b> all times to avoid damage. The spacecraft has already taken a few of a planned series of images of the outer regions of the vulcanoid zone.|$|E
5|$|The first {{satellites}} {{designed to}} observe the Sun were NASA's Pioneers 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9, which were launched between 1959 and 1968. These probes orbited <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>at</b> a distance {{similar to that of}} Earth, and made the first detailed measurements of the solar wind and the solar magnetic field. Pioneer 9 operated for a particularly long time, transmitting data until May 1983.|$|E
5|$|After the Deluge was {{exhibited}} in unfinished form in 1886 as <b>The</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>at</b> St Jude's Church, Whitechapel; Samuel Barnett, vicar of St Jude's, organised annual art exhibitions in east London {{in an effort}} to bring beauty into the lives of the poor; he had a close relationship with Watts, and regularly borrowed his works to display them to local residents. Following this exhibition Watts continued to work on the painting for a further five years.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the closest}} scattered-disc objects {{approach}} <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>at</b> about 30–35AU, their orbits can extend well beyond 100AU. This makes scattered objects {{among the most}} distant and coldest objects in the Solar System. The innermost portion of the scattered disc overlaps with a torus-shaped region of orbiting objects traditionally called the Kuiper belt, but its outer limits reach much further away from the Sun and further {{above and below the}} ecliptic than the Kuiper belt proper.|$|E
5|$|At around midday on 23 November Horrocks darkened {{his room}} and focused the rays of {{sunlight}} coming through the window onto the paper where the image could be observed safely. At his location in Much Hoole (the latitude of which he determined to be 53° 35'), he calculated that the transit should begin at about 3:00pm on Sunday the 24th, but he began his observations the previous day fearing that he might miss the event if his calculations proved to be inaccurate. On the Sunday he began observing at sunrise, the weather was cloudy, but he first saw the tiny black shadow of Venus crossing <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>at</b> about 3:15pm, and observed {{for half an hour}} until sunset at 3:53pm.|$|E
5|$|Galileo's {{discovery}} {{proved the}} importance of the telescope as a tool for astronomers by showing that there were objects in space to be discovered that until then had remained unseen by the naked eye. More importantly, the discovery of celestial bodies orbiting something other than Earth dealt a blow to the then-accepted Ptolemaic world system, which held that Earth {{was at the center of}} the universe and all other celestial bodies revolved around it. Galileo's Sidereus Nuncius (Starry Messenger), which announced celestial observations through his telescope, does not explicitly mention Copernican heliocentrism, a theory that placed <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>at</b> the center of the universe. Nevertheless, Galileo accepted the Copernican theory.|$|E

5|$|Juno orbits at a {{slightly}} closer mean {{distance to the}} Sun than Ceres or Pallas. Its orbit is moderately inclined at around 12° to the ecliptic, but has an extreme eccentricity, {{greater than that of}} Pluto. This high eccentricity brings Juno closer to <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>at</b> perihelion than Vesta and further out at aphelion than Ceres. Juno had the most eccentric orbit of any known body until 33 Polyhymnia was discovered in 1854, and of asteroids over 200km in diameter only 324 Bamberga has a more eccentric orbit.|$|E
5|$|Kepler's laws of {{planetary}} motion describe {{the orbits of}} objects about the Sun. Following Kepler's laws, each object travels along an ellipse with <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>at</b> one focus. Objects closer to the Sun (with smaller semi-major axes) travel more quickly {{because they are more}} affected by the Sun's gravity. On an elliptical orbit, a body's distance from the Sun varies over the course of its year. A body's closest approach to the Sun is called its perihelion, whereas its most distant point from the Sun is called its aphelion. The orbits of the planets are nearly circular, but many comets, asteroids, and Kuiper belt objects follow highly elliptical orbits. The positions of the bodies in the Solar System can be predicted using numerical models.|$|E
