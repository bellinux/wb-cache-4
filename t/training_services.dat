5|$|The Federal {{government}} retired Air Marshal Jones in 1952 {{and replaced}} him with Air Marshal Donald Hardman, RAF, who proceeded to re-organise the RAAF command-and-control system along functional lines, establishing Home (operational), Training, and Maintenance Commands in October 1953. The first was re-formed from Eastern Area Command {{as it was}} considered the RAAF's de facto operational organisation. The second was re-formed from Southern Area Command, {{as it was the}} hub of <b>training</b> <b>services,</b> controlling those in New South Wales and Queensland as well as Victoria and South Australia. The third and last functional command was formed from the extant Maintenance Group headquarters in Melbourne. The transition to a functional system was completed in February 1954, when the three new commands assumed control of operations, training and maintenance from Western, North-Western, and North-Eastern Areas.|$|E

The first was re-formed {{from the existing}} Eastern Area Command, which was considered a de facto operational organisation owing to the preponderance of combat forces within its sphere.

5|$|Various {{fund-raising}} schemes, {{along with}} some financial support from local authorities, allowed small-scale work on the locks to continue, but the projected timescales for completion were missed. In 1983 the Manpower Services Commission, which had a remit to co-ordinate employment and <b>training</b> <b>services</b> in the United Kingdom, agreed to employ 50 men on work that included restoration of Aldermaston Lock, its adjacent wharf, and Widmead Lock. The restoration of the Dundas Aqueduct and several smaller schemes were later added to the list. Maintenance agreements were signed with local authorities along the route, while fund-raising activities continued. The National Association for the Care and Resettlement of Offenders sponsored a workshop, which opened in Shrivenham in 1987, to create new lock gates for the Crofton and Devizes flights. In 1988 the restoration of Woolhampton Lock was completed, but obstructions remained on either side. Frounds swing bridge could not be opened and the restoration of Midgham Lock had not been finished; both were completed the following year. Re-puddling of the Crofton pounds {{was carried out in}} 1989, along with the reconstruction of Midgham Bridge. Restoration of the turf-sided Monkey Marsh Lock proved difficult because of its status as a Scheduled Ancient Monument, and the consequent need to protect the historic site while improving safety.|$|E
40|$|<b>Train</b> <b>service</b> {{network is}} a network form of <b>train</b> <b>service</b> plan. The {{controllability}} of the <b>train</b> <b>service</b> plan determines the recovery {{possibility of the}} <b>train</b> <b>service</b> plan in emergencies. We first build the small-world model for <b>train</b> <b>service</b> network and analyze the scale-free character of it. Then based on the linear network controllability theory, we discuss the LB model adaptability in <b>train</b> <b>service</b> network controllability analysis. The LB model is improved and we construct the <b>train</b> <b>service</b> network and define the connotation of the driver nodes based on the immune propagation and cascading failure in the <b>train</b> <b>service</b> network. An algorithm {{to search for the}} driver nodes, turning the <b>train</b> <b>service</b> network into a bipartite graph, is proposed and applied in the <b>train</b> <b>service</b> network. We analyze the controllability of the <b>train</b> <b>service</b> network of China with the method and the results of the computing case prove the feasibility of it...|$|R

To optimize the <b>train</b> <b>service</b> plan, {{especially in the case of}} emergency, this paper convert the <b>train</b> <b>service</b> plan into <b>train</b> <b>service</b> network. Then, a model to optimize the <b>train</b> <b>service</b> network is built, taking the total travel time of all the passengers on the railway network as the optimizing goal. An approach to solve the problem of <b>train</b> <b>service</b> network optimization is given. The computing case proves the efficiency of the method propose in this paper.

5000|$|In the 1990s, {{the era of}} {{continuous}} growth came to end. Ridership shrank {{as a result of}} a recession in the early part of the decade. In spite of this, GO extended limited rush hour GO <b>Train</b> <b>service</b> to Barrie, Guelph, Acton and Oshawa in 1990. In the same year, GO also introduced off-peak <b>train</b> <b>service</b> on the Milton line, much of which only operated as far west as Erindale. In May 1992, while GO Transit celebrated its 25th birthday, all-day GO <b>Train</b> <b>service</b> was extended to Burlington with the building of a new station at Aldershot. However, in 1993 Ontario NDP premier Bob Rae announced the Social Contract, which would see a [...] "temporary" [...] reduction in spending on <b>services.</b> Consequentially GO <b>Train</b> <b>service</b> to Barrie, Guelph and Acton was eliminated. All day GO <b>Train</b> <b>service</b> to Whitby and Burlington was reduced to rush hours only (while limited rush hour <b>train</b> <b>service</b> to Oshawa and Hamilton remained in place). All day Lakeshore <b>train</b> <b>service</b> existed only between Pickering and Oakville.
