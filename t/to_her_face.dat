5|$|The {{details of}} the murder are sketchy. Carol was killed due to blunt trauma <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> by means of some instrument, alleged in court {{to have been an}} ice axe. She was then bound with rope, using complex knots, weighed down with rocks and lead pipes and thrown {{overboard}} from a boat on Coniston Water. The body landed on an underwater ledge where it was later found by amateur divers. Had it been dropped a few metres further from the shore, it would have sunk to the much deeper bottom and probably never have been discovered.|$|E
5|$|The opera was {{frequently}} revised, most particularly in 1717 and in 1731; modern performances are usually a conflation of the versions available. Up {{to and including}} 1717, these changes had no {{significant effect on the}} plot. In the 1731 version, however, in Act 2 Armida imitates Almirena's voice rather than assuming her appearance, and Argante declares his love to Almirena's portrait rather than <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>face.</b> In Act 3 the marches and the battle scene are cut; Armida and Argante remain unrepentant and vanish in a chariot drawn by dragons before the conclusion.|$|E

25|$|Kat briefly {{works the}} market again, but marker {{inspector}} Aleks Shirovs (Kristian Kiehling) forces her off her stall when he discovers {{she is working}} and claiming maternity benefit. Alfie lies {{to her that he}} has managed to convince the council to give them more time to rally together the money they need, but secretly plans to claim house insurance by setting fire to their house. He does so, but is unaware Kat is inside. She becomes trapped although Alfie rescues her. She is badly burnt and suffers permanent scarring <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>face.</b> On leaving hospital, she and Alfie remarry with two nurses as the only witnesses, before returning to the square and moving into a flat Alfie has organised for them to squat in. When the owners arrive, they are thrown out and Kat is angry with Alfie, although out of desperation they squat in a new flat with help from Donna. Lee Carter (Danny-Boy Hanchard) calls the landlord of the flat when trying to fix the boiler, so they are evicted again and they stay at the Vic with Alfie's friend Mick Carter (Danny Dyer). After Kat makes an emotional speech to the social housing manager, they are offered a council house in Hull. Stacey tries to stop her but before they leave Kat discovers a photo of Nana that was not lost in the house. Alfie confesses that it was he who started the fire. Kat, appalled by the disclosure, insists their marriage is over and stays with Stacey and Lily.|$|E
500|$|An autopsy {{ruled that}} Flores {{did not have}} sexual {{intercourse}} before her death {{and that she was}} not under the influence of enough alcohol to prevent her from resisting an attack. She suffered blunt force trauma to her head, which caused a brain hemorrhage, cranial fracture, and broken neck. She also suffered significant injuries <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> and showed signs of asphyxiation, according to court documents. Flores tested positive for the presence of amphetamines. The lab report does not indicate whether the victim took the drugs willingly or unknowingly.|$|E
500|$|The {{prosecution}} {{account was}} that Morgan raped and killed Figard {{on the afternoon}} or evening of 19 December 1995, then kept her body in his cab for ten days before disposing of it. Farrer told the court {{that she had been}} strangled and battered around the head with a heavy object, and injuries <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> were [...] "consistent with kicking and stamping". There was also evidence to suggest her hands had been taped together, with the prosecution of the opinion she had been [...] "intimidated" [...] into having sex.|$|E

500|$|Following his flight, a {{military}} dictatorship took power. The new authorities removed Evita's body from display, and its whereabouts were a mystery for 16 years. From 1955 until 1971, the military dictatorship of Argentina issued {{a ban on}} Peronism. It became illegal not only to possess pictures of Juan and Eva Perón in one's home, but to speak their names. In 1971, the military revealed that Evita's body was buried in a crypt in Milan, Italy, under the name [...] "María Maggi." [...] It appeared that her body had been damaged during its transport and storage, such as compressions <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> and disfigurement {{of one of her}} feet due to the body having been left in an upright position.|$|E
500|$|Her morning ablutions {{included}} washing herself unassisted with a flannel {{rather than}} taking a shower ("an odd invention"), and applying first soap, then olive oil and powder <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>face.</b> She washed her own glass and cutlery before proceeding to lunch. She enjoyed daube (braised beef) but was not keen on boiled fish. After the meal she smoked a Dunhill cigarette (formerly a cigar, a habit she had acquired from her husband) and drank {{a small amount of}} Port wine. She enjoyed chocolate (and at the age of 112 received a delivery of 800 kilogrammes after challenging a TV presenter – this was then distributed to care homes), and made herself daily a fruit salad based on banana slices and squeezed orange.|$|E
500|$|Clive Russell, who portrayed Brynden [...] "Blackfish" [...] Tully in the series, {{spoke about}} his character's {{encounter}} with Brienne of Tarth, {{in an interview}} with IGN, noting [...] "Brienne represented for him his young self, a person of integrity, a soldier of integrity, {{trying to do the right}} thing. That added to the conflict he felt of what was the right thing to do: whether to send men to Sansa or not." [...] He continued by saying about their relationship to each other, [...] "She spoke very clearly to power. She was talking to an older man who's, initially, very irritated by her being there, but eventually takes her very, very seriously. There's a touching moment where he acknowledges that <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>face.</b> It's very touching and sad, and I think that's what it's about. He's really recognizing the next generation of what I once was." ...|$|E

500|$|The Christmas Day episodes, {{written by}} Simon Ashdown, {{drew on the}} show's early history to mark the {{occasion}} of Pauline's exit, which was particularly emphasised {{by the use of}} flashback vocal snippets of several members of Pauline's deceased family. The critic for The Times, Tim Teeman, commented that [...] "Wendy Richard as Pauline had the air of the departing diva, queen of all she had loved, lost and laid waste <b>to,</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> set in a silent snarl." [...] In addition, her parting scene with the other EastEnders long-serving [...] "grand dame" [...] Dot Cotton (played by June Brown) has also been praised, with Teeman commenting: [...] "The really choking scene came in the launderette between Pauline and Dot... Here the two grand dames had worked, bitched and consoled for years. Richard and the wonderful June Brown played their final encounter as intensely as the characters deserved." ...|$|E
500|$|Although {{both were}} {{committed}} O.T.O. members, Northrup's usurpation of Helen's role led to {{conflict between the}} two sisters. The reactions of Parsons and Helen towards Northrup were markedly different. Parsons told Helen <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> that he preferred Northrup sexually: [...] "This {{is a fact that}} I can do nothing about. I am better suited to her temperamentally – we get on well. Your character is superior. You are a greater person. I doubt that she would face what you have with me – or support me as well." [...] Some years later, addressing himself as [...] "You", Parsons told himself that his affair with Northrup (whom he called Betty) marked a key step in his growth as a practitioner of magick: [...] "Betty served to affect a transference from Helen at a critical period ... Your passion for Betty also gave you the magical force needed at the time, and the act of adultery tinged with incest, served as your magical confirmation in the law of Thelema." ...|$|E
500|$|Later in {{the same}} month, music website Popjustice {{announced}} that Stefani was going to release a single called [...] "Baby Don't Lie" [...] and it was set to premiere on October 6, 2014. The news was accidentally posted on Interscope's playiga.com, a site that lists current and upcoming radio releases. Furthermore, the song was reportedly co-written by Ryan Tedder and produced Benny Blanco, while its video {{was going to be}} directed by Sophie Muller, whom Stefani has worked numerous times on videos from No Doubt and her solo career. On October 18, 2014, the song leaked online, ahead of its premiere date, October 19, 2014. The same day, Stefani premiered the single's cover art through her social media. As stated by Jocelyn Vena, [...] "the coverart is a colorful piece of pop art," [...] with Stefani appear on it, in front of a clear blue sky, with bright yellow hair and neon pink lipstick, while holding a big gemstone up <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>face.</b> The song was released for digital download on October 20, 2014, and it officially impacted mainstream radio on October 21, 2014.|$|E

500|$|Method Studios was {{contracted}} {{to handle the}} film's visual effects work. The studio's supervisor Sean Faden, worked alongside the film's visual effects supervisor, Brad Parker throughout the production. Several of the film's scenes {{proved to be a}} challenge for the team. Director Reeves wanted the [...] "car-crash" [...] sequence to appear as if it were filmed uncut in first-person. Several plates were shot with the first involving actor Jenkins backing the car out of the gas station and swerving, the second plate shot had a model of the car capable of being spun mechanically on a [...] "rotisserie" [...] in front of a blue screen which could simulate the car's roll down the hill. Jenkins' stunt double and a dummy were placed in the car as the rotisserie spun with additional effects work used to animate the dummy as the car rolled. The two shots were then combined to deceive the viewer into believing that it was one complete shot. Houdini software was used for much of the film's shots which involved Abby in her vampiric form. Faden noted the techniques used in another challenging shot important to Abby's character in which she begins bleeding when she enters Owen's apartment without invitation. Faden stated, [...] "Normally in such a scene, the character would be shot on set, dressed in blood. But in this case, the timing of the bleeding was so dependent on the emotional beats of the scene that this technique wouldn’t have allowed us enough control." [...] Actress Chloë Grace Moretz was first shot with minimal prosthetic blood applied <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> for reference. Then using techniques utilized in a prior Method Studios film, A Nightmare on Elm Street, Faden had the Houdini software track Moretz's shaking movements and render the gradual release of blood from her face.|$|E
500|$|Mileena was {{described}} by Computer and Video Games as [...] "equally erotic and repulsive". According to IGN, [...] "at first blush she seems like your quintessential sultry video-game vixen, but the mask comes off and she's got a gaping mouth filled {{to the brim with}} dagger-like teeth." [...] In 2008, IGN's Scott Collura listed [...] "Mileen-ewwwwww" [...] as one of [...] "top 50 chicks behaving badly," [...] while GamesRadar included her on the list of [...] "gaming's most repellent anti-babes". Comparing the Mortal Kombat characters to the seven deadly sins in Dante's Inferno, Chris Holt of GamePro chose Mileena to represent Envy. Aaron Koehn of GamePro placed Mileena and Kitana eleventh on his 2009 list of the best palette-swapped video game characters, but wrote that [...] "if you gauge Mileena's attractiveness simply based on the size of her baby-feeders, be ready for some disappointment when she removes her mask." [...] ScrewAttack ranked her as seventh on their list of the top ten [...] "ugly chicks in games" [...] for her horrific looks when unmasked, but otherwise calling her [...] "the ultimate woman." [...] Virgin Media included her on their list of the ten [...] "game girls you wouldn't dare to date" [...] for being attractive [...] "until she rips off her veil and reveals her monstrous form beneath." [...] Destructoid's Nick Chester commented: [...] "Her story, as far as I'm concerned, is that she needs to see a dentist." [...] On the other hand, EGMs Eric L. Patterson, stating his preference of Mileena over Kitana, wrote that Mileena's face is actually {{one of the reasons why}} he likes her. Reviewing the Vita version of MK2011, GamesRadar's Jack DeVries called it [...] "as pretty as Mileena minus mask, but overall, just as viciously fun." [...] Ranking Mileena as second on his 2013 list of ugliest video game characters, Alex Langley of Arcade Sushi wrote: [...] "If ever there were a time to use the term 'butterface' it would be with Mileena, because everything about her is hot...but her face. Her face will friggin' bite your face off, which is never a sign of a good date." [...] Ramon Hagenbeuk of Dutch XGN included Mileena among the [...] "top 10 ugly game chicks" [...] in 2015 due <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> despite [...] "her nice figure". French magazine Retropolis placed Mileena second in a 2013 ranking of the sexiest girls in fighting games in which her bust was the criteria for her [...] "reverse décolleté" [...] approach to fashion after Mortal Kombat II, while comparing the character to shrimp in regards to her physical appearance: [...] "Everything is good except for the head." [...] Playboy included Mileena, Kitana, and Jade together in their list of [...] "the hottest video game breasts of all time" [...] at 19th place.|$|E

Nash wears a veil daily because the attack left devastating injuries <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> and she [...] "doesn't want to scare people."
