5|$|From a {{technical}} standpoint, Kanō combined <b>the</b> <b>throwing</b> {{techniques of the}} Kitō-ryū and the choking and pinning techniques of the Tenjin Shin'yō-ryū. As such, judo's Koshiki no Kata preserves the traditional forms of the Kitō-ryū with only minor differences from the mainline tradition. Similarly, many of the techniques (but not the forms) of the Tenjin Shin'yō-ryū are preserved in the Kime no Kata.|$|E
5|$|Illingworth's final {{match was}} against Queensland in December 1964. He took 0/34 as Queensland batted first and made 270. After scoring seven of his team's 341, he took 1/86 as Queensland {{declared}} at 5/332. Chasing 261 for victory, Illingworth made four as his team lost by 40 runs. Illingworth ended {{his career with}} 15 wickets {{at an average of}} 27.60, and 155 runs at 17.22. The state selectors were reluctant to pick him for Victoria because of <b>the</b> <b>throwing</b> allegations that surrounded him.|$|E

50|$|Most throws {{are named}} by {{describing}} the circumvention point of <b>the</b> <b>throw</b> (e.g., hip throw, shoulder throw, wrist <b>throw</b> etc.), or <b>the</b> nature of effect of <b>the</b> <b>throw</b> on <b>the</b> opponent (e.g., {{heaven and earth}} throw, valley drop, body drop) with variations are given descriptive names.

It is conventional for the Japanese to name their throws in this manner, and many western martial art dojos have given English names to <b>the</b> <b>throws</b> feeling that {{it is easier for}} English speaking students to remember <b>the</b> names of <b>throws</b> if they can associate <b>the</b> <b>throws</b> by <b>the</b> descriptive nature of <b>the</b> <b>throw</b> name.|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>throwing</b> events involve hurling an {{implement}} (such as a heavy weight, javelin or discus) from a set point, with athletes being judged on {{the distance that}} the object is thrown. Combined events involve {{the same group of}} athletes contesting a number of different track and field events. Points are given for their performance in each event and the athlete with the greatest points total at the end of all events is the winner.|$|E
5|$|Track {{and field}} is a sport which {{includes}} athletic contests established on {{the skills of}} running, jumping, and throwing. The name {{is derived from the}} sport's typical venue: a stadium with an oval running track enclosing a grass field where <b>the</b> <b>throwing</b> and jumping events take place. Track and field is categorised under the umbrella sport of athletics, which also includes road running, cross country running, and race walking.|$|E
5|$|All four of {{the common}} jumping events are held at indoor venues. The long and triple jump areas run {{alongside}} the central 60m track and are mostly identical in form to their outdoor counterparts. The pole vault track and landing area are also alongside the central running track. Shot put (or weight throw) is the only throwing event held indoors due to size restrictions. <b>The</b> <b>throwing</b> area {{is similar to the}} outdoor event, but the landing sector is a rectangular section surrounded by netting or a stop barrier.|$|E

5|$|Journalists {{who wrote}} {{books about the}} 1958–59 season made thinly veiled {{references}} to the controversy {{in the names of}} their work. Fingleton's account on the series was entitled Four Chukkas to Australia, while E. N.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>throwing</b> {{became more}} intense as {{kick-off}} approached. Moments later, {{a group of}} Liverpool fans charged into section Z, causing the fans there to retreat. As they had nowhere to go, they moved towards the side perimeter wall. As more people moved up against the wall, it collapsed, which resulted in 39 deaths and injuries to 600 people. At {{the other end of}} the ground, Juventus fans began to riot in retaliation for the events in section Z. They advanced down the pitch towards the Liverpool fans and were stopped by the police. The resulting confrontation lasted two hours and was still ongoing when the match kicked-off.|$|E

5|$|In 1635, without {{reference}} to a general assembly of the Parliament, the King authorised a book of canons that made him head of the Church, ordained an unpopular ritual and enforced {{the use of a}} new liturgy.

5|$|The four {{throwing}} events generally all {{begin on}} one side of the stadium. The javelin throw typically takes place on a piece of track that is central and parallel to the straights of the main running track. The javelin throwing area is a sector shape frequently across the Pitch (sports field) in the middle of the stadium, ensuring that the javelin has a minimal chance of causing damage or injury. The discus throw and hammer throw contests begin in a tall metal cage usually situated in one of the corners of the field. The cage reduces the danger of implements being thrown out of the field of play and throws travel diagonally across the field in the centre of the stadium. The shot put features a circular throwing area with a toe board at one end. <b>The</b> <b>throwing</b> area is a sector. Some stadia also have a water jump area {{on one side}} of the field specifically for steeplechase races.|$|E

5|$|The {{second day}} started {{dramatically}} when Halcombe bowled {{from the opposite}} end and bowled the second over of the day, with Lonergan standing at square leg. His first ball was deemed to be legitimate but from then on there was a continuous call of no ball, for ten consecutive deliveries. Halcombe then substantially reduced his pace and completed the over after 18 balls. Although Bryant did not switch Halcombe {{to the other end}} in the first match, he did so on this occasion. Halcombe continued bowling and there were no further no ball calls. During the ten consecutive no balls, Lonergan had remained firm despite continuous heckling from a section of the crowd who showed their support of the bowler. Halcombe persevered and ended the innings with 3/61 from 20 overs. His action was much discussed, in particular his faster ball. The opening batsmen Rushforth and Atkinson played Halcombe in a diplomatic manner, making little effort to attack his bowling in the midst of <b>the</b> <b>throwing</b> calls.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>throwing</b> {{controversy}} subsided {{during the}} 1961 English season, and the 1961–62 Australian season was purely domestic, with no touring international teams. As a result, {{there were no}} pressing diplomacy imperatives involving throwing. Meckiff was Victoria's leading bowler with 28 wickets at 27.14 in eight matches and was not called. His best performance was 5/53 in the first innings of the match against Queensland at the MCG, which ended in defeat for the home team. Despite healthy results for the season overall, the paceman struggled and took match figures of 2/136 and 3/112 as Victoria lost both their matches against the dominant New South Wales XI, who won their ninth successive Shield. At {{the end of the}} season, Meckiff was part of an International XI that toured New Zealand and played against the hosts' national team and against teams from India and Pakistan. He had little success, taking four wickets at 53.00 in three matches.|$|E
5|$|Section 1(2) of the Act {{creates an}} offence which {{includes}} {{all the elements}} of the section 1(1) offence with an additional element of intending or being reckless as to the endangering of life. The offence lies in possible effects of the defendant's actions and it is not therefore necessary to prove an actual danger to life. However, there must be a connection between the damage and the mental state of the defendant. In R v. Steer (1986), the defendant fired a gun intending to injure another person, but missed and hit a window instead; it was held that although the intention to endanger life and the fact of damage coexisted, the damage itself did not endanger life. This approach was extended in R v. Webster (1995), in which the relationship between the damage caused and the damage intended was explored. That case involved <b>the</b> <b>throwing</b> of heavy items into the paths of moving vehicles, and it was held that a defendant may be guilty if he intends to endanger life by the actual damage intended, or is reckless that life will be endangered by that damage. Therefore, although a defendant does not necessarily intend to endanger life when he intends to break a car window, ignoring the likely risk that this will cause the driver to swerve into the path of another vehicle, perhaps fatally, constitutes recklessness and is a sufficient causative nexus.|$|E
