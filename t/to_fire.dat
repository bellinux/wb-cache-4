5|$|Director of {{photography}} Mark Irwin was fired during filming of Screams finale, {{a week before}} principal photography was to be completed. Upon review of the dailies, Craven found the footage was out of focus and unusable. Irwin was initially ordered <b>to</b> <b>fire</b> his camera crew. He retorted that if his crew were to be fired, they would also have <b>to</b> <b>fire</b> him. The producers fired him and replaced him with Peter Deming, who finished the film.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Liz {{has been}} told by Jack that she has <b>to</b> <b>fire</b> ten percent of her staff. While the staff try their best to keep their jobs, Liz struggles with making a {{decision}} of whom <b>to</b> <b>fire.</b> Liz's problem is solved when Floyd, for whom Liz has romantic feelings, tells her that his girlfriend works in accounting at TGS. After Liz fires Floyd's girlfriend, she goes on a rampage around 30 Rock firing people, including her producer Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit), who disagrees with her decision <b>to</b> <b>fire</b> Floyd's girlfriend for her own personal gain. Jack later tells her that he hired all the fired people back, but he is transferring Floyd's girlfriend to General Electric headquarters in Fairfield, Connecticut.|$|E

5|$|With {{the added}} missile {{capacity}} of the battleships in the 1980s came additional fire-support systems to launch and guide the ordnance. <b>To</b> <b>fire</b> the Harpoon anti-ship missiles, the battleships were equipped with the SWG-1 fire-control system, and <b>to</b> <b>fire</b> the Tomahawk missiles the battleships used either the SWG-2 or SWG-3 fire-control system. In addition to these offensive-weapon systems, the battleships were outfitted with the AN/SLQ-25 Nixie {{to be used as}} a lure against enemy torpedoes, an SLQ-32 electronic warfare system that can detect, jam, and deceive an opponent's radar and a Mark 36 SRBOC system <b>to</b> <b>fire</b> chaff rockets intended to confuse enemy missiles.|$|E
5|$|A Slovene {{account of}} the same event asserts that the {{soldiers}} began <b>to</b> <b>fire</b> only when an Austrian citizen discharged a revolver {{in the direction of}} the Slovene soldiers, striking the bayonet of one.

5|$|Bellona {{opened fire}} on Corageux while Brilliant engaged Maliceuse and Hermione. Through {{skillful}} sailing, Logie {{was able to keep}} both French frigates at bay and unable to assist Courageux, which surrendered to Bellona after ninety minutes of fighting. At 7.30 a.m. Maliceuse and Hermione made sail and retreated, with Brilliant too damaged to give chase. British losses in the battle numbered six killed and 28 wounded on Bellona and five killed and 16 wounded on Brilliant. On the French side, losses on Courageux alone were 240 killed and 110 wounded. Historian William Laird Clowes has suggested that the much higher French casualty rate was the result of differences in tactics, with the French gun crews trained <b>to</b> <b>fire</b> at the masts and rigging of an enemy ship in order to disable them ahead of a boarding attempt. By contrast, British crews were trained <b>to</b> <b>fire</b> into the hulls of enemy ships.|$|E
5|$|Besieged {{forces would}} {{sometimes}} launch sorties {{in an attempt}} <b>to</b> <b>fire</b> the attackers' camps or equipment.

5|$|During {{the night}} of 14–15 April 1809, contact was {{maintained}} with the French squadron by Recruit, Captain Charles John Napier firing on the rearmost ship Hautpoult and coming under fire from the French stern-chasers, guns situated {{in the rear of}} a ship <b>to</b> <b>fire</b> on pursuers. Shortly after 04:00, Pompee came within range and began <b>to</b> <b>fire</b> her bow-chasers, the chase continuing westwards into the Caribbean Sea. Frustrated by her inability to escape Recruit, Hautpoult eventually turned and fired a broadside at 10:45, causing severe damage but failing to dissuade Napier, who immediately counter-attacked. Hautpoults manoeuvre caused her to lose ground to her pursuers and throughout the day the squadrons exchanged shots, neither causing significant damage but the French being driven deeper into British held waters and unable to drive off their opponents.|$|E

5|$|Glorious was hit {{again in}} the centre engine room at 17:20 and this caused her to lose speed and {{commence}} a slow circle to port. She also developed a list to starboard.

40|$|Knowledge based {{expert system}} <b>to</b> assess <b>fires</b> and. {{pollution}} due <b>to</b> <b>fires</b> in underground coal mIne A {{considerable amount of}} coal is lost due <b>to</b> the <b>fires</b> in underground/surface mines and it pollutes the natural environment because {{of the evolution of}} the pollutant gases like carbon monoxide, oxides of sulphur and nitrous fumes besides the unburnt hydrocarbons. Subsoil water loss in the area are severely damaging the strata. The movement of water overfire areas createfurther problems of low dissolved oxygen and downward movement of salts thereby increasing soil salinity, restricting end use potential of water. Hence, the knowledge based expert system model is developed for the combat of fires and also pollution due <b>to</b> <b>fires</b> by analysing the different causes of fires in underground workings with the help of certainty factor techniques. The modification of mining methods can be suggested to avoid dangerous combinations. These models help us to understand the optimisation of the parameters needed to controlfires as well as pollution due <b>to</b> <b>fires</b> in underground coal mines...|$|R
