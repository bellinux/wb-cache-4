5|$|The Japanese Navy used five Ko-hyoteki-class midget {{submarines}} in {{an unsuccessful}} operation against US battleships during {{the attack on}} Pearl Harbor. The navy hoped that upgrades to the submarines, intensified crew training, and {{the selection of a}} less well defended target would lead to better results and an increased chance of the crews of the midgets to return alive from <b>their</b> <b>mission.</b> Therefore, on 16 December 1941, the navy initiated plans for a second midget submarine operation.|$|E
5|$|The {{official}} {{start of}} the expedition occurred when the crew docked to the station on 2 November 2000, aboard the Russian spacecraft Soyuz TM-31, which had launched two days earlier.

The crew was very busy throughout the mission, which was declared a success.|$|E
5|$|The simple {{appearance}} of MiGs could often accomplish <b>their</b> <b>mission</b> by causing American pilots to jettison their bomb loads {{as a defensive}} measure. In 1966, the MiG-17 were joined by more modern Soviet-built MiG-21 Fishbeds, which could fight on a more equal footing with the U.S. aircraft. By 1967, the North Vietnamese Air Force was maintaining an interceptor force of 100 aircraft, {{many of which were}} based on PRC airfields and out of reach of American air attack.|$|E

5|$|Through {{the seventh}} and eighth centuries, the two abbeys {{followed}} <b>their</b> <b>mission</b> of evangelism, along with forest clearance. With {{the decline of the}} Carolingian Empire, however, the abbeys suffered the same decay as elsewhere, leaving the principality in the custody of lay abbots—temporal guardians—from 844 to 938, including Ebbo, archbishop of Rheims, Adalard the Seneschal, and Reginar and Giselbert, dukes of Lorraine.|$|E

Not knowing what to make of the crystal's pronouncements, but nonetheless recognizing the importance of its words, the four inform their adoptive family of <b>their</b> <b>mission</b> and set out to explore an overworld outside the area in which they were brought up, in order to bring balance back to the world.|$|E
