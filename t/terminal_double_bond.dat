The model, based on the mechanism described {{in the first part}} of this work (Macromolecules 2003, 36, 0000), accounts for polymerization, thermal initiation, and degradation reactions, including backbiting, chain transfer to polymer, and addition to terminal unsaturation, all followed by beta-scission. All activation energies for the rate parameters were taken from independent literature sources, with the exception of backbiting for which the experimental data obtained in part 1 of this work have been used.

40|$|The surface {{chemistry}} of silicon resonators {{plays an important}} role in mechanical energy dissipation. Significantly higher quality factors are observed for methyl-terminated-MHz-frequency silicon oscillators as compared to similar resonators terminated with longer alkyl moieties. Megahertz-frequency silicon micromechanical torsional resonators were coated with mixed monolayers consisting of methyl groups with a small admixture of functional moieties. Infrared absorption spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy were used to characterize the functionalized surfaces. Resonators terminated with mixed acetal/methyl monolayers had very high quality factors. In contrast, when the acetal moiety was converted to an aldehyde using standard deprotection chemistries in both aqueous and organic media, a dramatic decrease in resonator quality was observed. Resonators terminated with a mixture of methyl and butenyl moieties were found to have high quality factors than those observed for methyl-terminated resonators. Furthermore, the <b>terminal</b> <b>double</b> <b>bond</b> on the butenyl moiety was reacted with the <b>terminal</b> <b>double</b> <b>bond</b> on ethyl 10 -undecenoate molecule via olefin cross-metathesis, resulting in ester-terminated resonators.
