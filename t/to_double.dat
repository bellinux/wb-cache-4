5|$|Afforestation {{projects}} have been undertaken to prevent groundwater pollution, secure drinking water, sequester CO2, increase biodiversity, create an attractive countryside, provide easy access to nature and offer outdoor activities to the public. In 2000 the first project, the New Forests of Aarhus, was completed which aimed <b>to</b> <b>double</b> the forest cover in the municipality and in 2009 another phase was announced <b>to</b> <b>double</b> forest cover once more before the year 2030. The afforestation plans were realised as a local project in collaboration with private landowners, under a larger national agenda. Other projects to expand natural habitats include a rewilding effort in Geding-Kasted Bog and continuous monitoring of the four Natura 2000 areas in the municipality.|$|E

5|$|Ian Richardson {{was booked}} {{within a minute}} {{of the second half}} {{starting}} for bringing down Kiwomya. Notts County started to come back into the game; Martindale headed wide, Agana and Richardson both had shots blocked during a goalmouth scramble and Tony Battersby had a shot saved over the crossbar by Jonathan Gould, as County tried to equalise during a 20-minute spell of pressure. Between County's chances, Stallard had the opportunity <b>to</b> <b>double</b> City's lead when he capitalised on a slip from Strodder, but Ward saved his effort. However, City went on <b>to</b> <b>double</b> their advantage on 75 minutes. Ormondroyd, who had replaced the injured Hamilton, flicked on a long pass from Richard Huxford with his first touch. His header went across goal to Stallard who volleyed home. Two minutes after the goal, Martindale fired wide for County after a pass from Agana, and with time running out Finnan's long-range shot was deflected for a corner, but from the resulting set-piece, Richardson shot over the crossbar.|$|E

40|$|Although {{there is}} a great deal of {{information}} concerning responses to increases in atmospheric CO 2 at the tissue and plant levels, there are substantially fewer studies that have investigated ecosystem-level responses in the context of integrated carbon, water, and nutrient cycles. Because our understanding of ecosystem responses to elevated CO 2 is incomplete, modeling is a tool that can be used to investigate the role of plant and soil interactions in the response of terrestrial ecosystems to elevated CO 2. In this study, we analyze the responses of net primary production (NPP) <b>to</b> <b>doubled</b> CO 2 from 355 to 710 ppmv among three biogeochemistry models in the Vegetation/Ecosystem Modeling and Analysis Project (VEMAP) : BIOME-BGC (BioGeochemical Cycles), Century, and the Terrestrial Ecosystem Model (TEM). For the conterminous United States, doubled atmospheric CO 2 causes NPP to increase by 5 % in Century, 8 % in TEM, and 11 % in BIOME-BGC. Multiple regression analyses between the NPP response <b>to</b> <b>doubled</b> CO 2 and the mean annual temperature aid annual precipitation of biomes or grid cells indicate that there are negative relationships between precipitation and the response of NPP <b>to</b> <b>doubled</b> CO 2 for all three models. In contrast, there are different relationships between temperature and the response of NPP <b>to</b> <b>doubled</b> CO 2 for the three models: {{there is a}} negative relationship in the responses of BIOME-BGC, no relationship in the responses of Century, and a positive relationship in the responses of TEM. In BIOME-BGC, the NPP response <b>to</b> <b>doubled</b> CO 2 is controlled by the change in transpiration associated with reduced leaf conductance to water vapor. This change affects soil water, then leaf area development and, finally, NPP. In Century, the response of NPP <b>to</b> <b>doubled</b> CO 2 is controlled by changes in decomposition rates associated with increased soil moisture that results from reduced evapotranspiration. This change affects nitrogen availability for plants, which influences NPP. In TEM, the NPP response <b>to</b> <b>doubled</b> CO 2 is controlled by increased carboxylation which is modified by canopy conductance and the degree to which nitrogen constraints cause down-regulation of photosynthesis. The implementation of these different mechanisms has consequences for the spatial pattern of NPP responses, and represents, in part, conceptual uncertainly about controls over NPP responses. Progress in reducing these uncertainties requires research focused at the ecosystem level to understand how interactions between the carbon, nitrogen, and water cycles influence the response of NPP to elevated atmospheric CO 2...|$|R

5000|$|In {{the earlier}} 1979 NAS report (p. 7), the {{radiative}} forcing due <b>to</b> <b>doubled</b> [...] {{is estimated to}} be 4 W/m2, as calculated (for example) in Ramanathan et al. (1979). In 2001 the IPCC adopted the revised value of 3.7 W/m2, the difference attributed to a [...] "stratospheric temperature adjustment". [...] More recently an intercomparison of radiative transfer codes (Collins et al., 2006) showed discrepancies among climate models and between climate models and more exact radiation codes in the forcing attributed <b>to</b> <b>doubled</b> [...] even in cloud-free sky; presumably the differences would be even greater if forcing were evaluated in the presence of clouds because of differences in the treatment of clouds in different models. Undoubtedly the difference in forcing attributed <b>to</b> <b>doubled</b> [...] in different climate models contributes to differences in apparent sensitivities of the models, although this effect is thought to be small relative to the intrinsic differences in sensitivities of the models themselves.|$|R
