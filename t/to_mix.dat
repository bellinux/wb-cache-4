5|$|In feral sheep, rams may fight {{during the}} rut to {{determine}} which individuals may mate with ewes. Rams, especially unfamiliar ones, will also fight outside the breeding period to establish dominance; rams can kill one another if allowed <b>to</b> <b>mix</b> freely. During the rut, even usually friendly rams may become aggressive towards humans due to increases in their hormone levels.|$|E

5|$|The band did not {{consider}} the album to be important and only Glover and Paice showed up <b>to</b> <b>mix</b> it. According to Birch, Gillan and Blackmore have never heard the finished album.

5|$|Van Gogh {{created more}} than 43 self-portraits between 1885 and 1889. They were usually {{completed}} in series, {{such as those}} painted in Paris in mid-1887, and continued until shortly before his death. Generally the portraits were studies, created during introspective periods when he was reluctant <b>to</b> <b>mix</b> with others, or when he lacked models, and so painted himself.|$|E

5|$|After {{the liberation}} of Belgium in September 1944, there was a boom of new {{magazines}} for the youth, both in French and Dutch. Many of those tried <b>to</b> <b>mix</b> American comics with local artists. Vandersteen worked in these early years for countless publications. He continued publishing in Bravo, with the medieval gags of Lancelot. Having moved to the suburbs of Brussels to avoid the bombardments of Antwerp, he {{came into contact with}} some French language editors. French language magazines he contributed to included Franc Jeu, Perce-Neige, and Le Petit Monde. Two of the comics he created for Franc Jeu were also published in albums. By 1947, all these magazines had disappeared.|$|E
5|$|In March 2002, Meshuggah {{recorded}} three-track demos with programmed drums {{in their}} home studio, which were based on Haake's sample Drumkit from Hell. The upcoming album was recorded in five to six weeks in May and was produced by the band at Dug-Out Studios in Uppsala and at its home studio in Stockholm. The last-minute decision to join 2002's Ozzfest tour forced the band <b>to</b> <b>mix</b> the album in two days and master it in one. Meshuggah immediately went on another US tour after finishing the recording.|$|E

5|$|In May 2000, {{two months}} before Steve & Emma were officially {{resigned}} from Live & Kicking, the show was brought back for a one-off special during the summer break. It was <b>to</b> <b>mix</b> in with the BBC's Music Live and the show was titled as Music Live & Kicking with Steve & Emma returning to present along with future presenter Ortis Deley and special guest presenter Stephen Gately of Boyzone. This special was dedicated {{to a series of}} music performances (hence the title) and was the first edition to be broadcast in widescreen.|$|E
5|$|In {{the band}}'s fourth album, 2011's The Here and Now, the band set out <b>to</b> <b>mix</b> their typical sounds {{with the music}} they were {{listening}} to at the time. The response was polarising. During the publicity for The Here and Now, the band praised it as a progression for them; {{they did not want}} to reject an album they had just released. But their own lack of belief in the record and their growing concern that they were irrelevant started to severely affect the band's confidence in themselves and their style.|$|E
5|$|Kei Iwasaki of {{the band}} Sekaiichi, writing for Musica, felt that Ichiro Yamaguchi's dual love of 1990s pop music and {{electronic}} musicians such as Daft Punk and Cornelius strongly expressed itself throughout the album. He lauded Sakanaction's efforts <b>to</b> <b>mix</b> electronica and pop, but felt that mixing these two genres was a double-edged sword that invariably influenced the composition of songs. Because of this, he felt that Night Fishing might be more successful musically if the songs were re-recorded.|$|E

5|$|Lambert {{proved to}} be unable <b>to</b> <b>mix</b> the track, and a fresh attempt at {{recording}} was made {{at the start of}} April at Mick Jagger's house, Stargroves, using the Rolling Stones Mobile Studio. Glyn Johns was invited to help with production, and he decided to re-use the synthesized organ track from Townshend's original demo, as the re-recording of the part in New York was felt to be inferior to the original. Keith Moon had to carefully synchronise his drum playing with the synthesizer, while Townshend and Entwistle played electric guitar and bass.|$|E
5|$|Martin oversaw {{post-production}} on The Beatles Anthology (which {{was originally}} entitled The Long and Winding Road) in 1994 and 1995, working again with Geoff Emerick. Martin {{decided to use}} an old 8-track analogue deck – which EMI learned an engineer still had – <b>to</b> <b>mix</b> the songs for the project, instead of a modern digital deck. He explained this {{by saying that the}} old deck created a completely different sound, which a new deck could not accurately reproduce. He also said he found the whole project a strange experience (and McCartney agreed), as they had to listen to themselves chatting in the studio, 25–30 years previously.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{kauri gum}} was found <b>to</b> <b>mix</b> more easily with linseed oil, at lower temperatures, than other resins, by the 1890s, 70 {{percent of all}} oil {{varnishes}} made in England used kauri gum. It was used to a limited extent in paints during the late 19th century, and from 1910 was used extensively {{in the manufacture of}} linoleum. From the 1930s, the market for gum dropped as synthetic alternatives were found, but there remained niche uses for the gum in jewellery and specialist high-grade varnish for violins.|$|E

5|$|Sound {{designer}} Frank Serafine, {{a longtime}} Star Trek fan, {{was invited to}} create the sound effects for the picture. Given access to state-of-the-art audio equipment, Serafine saw the picture as the chance to modernize outdated motion picture sound techniques with digital technology. Owing to background noise such as camera operation, much of the ambient noise or dialogue captured on set was unusable; it was Serafine's job to create or recreate sounds <b>to</b> <b>mix</b> back into the scenes.|$|E
5|$|The {{music group}} Chari Jazz formed in 1964 and {{initiated}} Chad's modern music scene. Later, more renowned {{groups such as}} African Melody and International Challal attempted <b>to</b> <b>mix</b> modernity and tradition. Popular groups such as Tibesti have clung faster to their heritage by drawing on sai, a traditional style of music from southern Chad. The people of Chad have customarily disdained modern music. However, in 1995 greater interest has developed and fostered the distribution of CDs and audio cassettes featuring Chadian artists. Piracy {{and a lack of}} legal protections for artists' rights remain problems to further development of the Chadian music industry.|$|E
5|$|The team {{considered}} several ideas, {{including a}} return to a post-apocalyptic earth and the conquest of another planet in the Alpha Centauri system, before deciding to keep the new title on Planet. The premise allowed them <b>to</b> <b>mix</b> and match old and new characters and delve into the mysteries of the monoliths and alien artifacts. The backstory evolved quickly, and the main conflict centered on the return of the original alien inhabitants. The idea of humans inadvertently caught up in an off-world civil war focused the story.|$|E
