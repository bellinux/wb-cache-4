5|$|Most of {{the series}} {{consists}} of original content featuring new as well as established characters, but the second season is mostly based on the plots of Sonic Adventure and Sonic Adventure 2. While traditionally animated, it includes non-outlined CGI elements for <b>things</b> <b>such</b> as Sonic's homing attack.|$|E
5|$|Dr. Isaacs' {{attempts}} to domesticate the infected {{have led to}} a new zombie breed that remembers basic <b>things,</b> <b>such</b> as how to use phones and cameras. Wesker's security officer, Captain Alexander Slater (Matthew Marsden), is adamant about Isaacs' disregard for Umbrella's regulations. Wesker, in private, informs Slater to keep watch on Isaacs' actions, and tells Slater that if Issacs disobeys orders, Slater should kill Isaacs.|$|E
5|$|In 1871 {{he became}} the first Cavendish Professor of Physics at Cambridge. Maxwell was put in charge of the {{development}} of the Cavendish Laboratory, supervising every step in the progress of the building and of the purchase of the collection of apparatus. One of Maxwell's last great contributions to science was the editing (with copious original notes) of the research of Henry Cavendish, from which it appeared that Cavendish researched, amongst other <b>things,</b> <b>such</b> questions as the density of the Earth and the composition of water.|$|E

5000|$|Interpreting proverbs {{is often}} complex, but is best {{done in a}} context. [...] Interpreting proverbs from other {{cultures}} {{is much more difficult}} than interpreting proverbs in one's own culture. Even within English-speaking cultures, there is difference of opinion on how to interpret the proverb A rolling stone gathers no moss. Some see it as condemning a person that keeps moving, seeing moss as a positive <b>thing,</b> <b>such</b> as profit; others see it the proverb as praising people that keep moving and developing, seeing moss as a negative <b>thing,</b> <b>such</b> as negative habits.|$|R

5|$|Shiina, {{given name}} unknown, {{otherwise}} {{referred to by}} his nickname , is another adult friend of Shuichi and Yoshino. He was Yuki's classmate in elementary school, and he eventually became her boyfriend after her transition. Unlike Yuki, Shiina had many friends in school. He generally just watches over Shuichi and Yoshino with Yuki, but he sometimes does bold and unexpected <b>things,</b> <b>such</b> as grabbing Yoshino's crotch when he first meets Yoshino because he feared that, because Yoshino was dressed as a boy at the time, Yuki might be having an illicit affair with Yoshino.|$|E
5|$|The Elves, {{particularly}} the Noldor, preoccupy themselves with various <b>things</b> <b>such</b> as smithwork, sculpture, music and other arts, and of course, what to eat. Males and females can do almost everything equally; however, the females often specialize {{in the arts}} of healing while the males go to war. This is {{because they believe that}} taking life interferes with the ability to preserve life. However, Elves are not stuck in rigid roles; females can defend themselves at need as well as males, and many males are skilled healers as well, such as Elrond.|$|E
5|$|Chinese Nü Yr is an electronica album using {{elements}} of bass, grime and 2-step garage. Malliagh explained that Chinese Nü Yr is based {{a story about}} 'Xiāngjiāo', a gelatinous and amorphous worm who wears a witch hat and is voiced by heavily pitch-shifted and processed recordings {{of his father and}} little sister. Xiāngjiāo is forced to go through portals in colorful and nonsensical lands, having to dodge <b>things</b> <b>such</b> as peanuts, floating fruit, pink-colored fog, and mountains growing out of the ground. Xiāngjiāo fears both the unfamiliarity of future lands and the extreme speed at which it travels. In a December 2015 interview, Malliagh stated the fate of the worm will occur in a full-length album.|$|E

5000|$|... "The {{morning star}} {{rises in the}} morning" [...] no longer needs {{to be thought of}} as having the subject-predicate form. It is instead {{analysed}} as [...] "there is one unique <b>thing</b> <b>such</b> that it is the morning star and it rises in the morning". Thus, strictly speaking, the two expressions [...] "the morning star..." [...] and [...] "the evening star..." [...] are not synonymous, so it makes sense that they cannot be substituted (the analysed description of the evening star is [...] "there is one unique <b>thing</b> <b>such</b> that it is the evening star and it rises in the evening"). This solves Gottlob Frege's problem of informative identities.|$|R

5|$|In {{people with}} AD, the {{increasing}} impairment {{of learning and}} memory eventually leads to a definitive diagnosis. In a small percentage, difficulties with language, executive functions, perception (agnosia), or execution of movements (apraxia) are more prominent than memory problems. AD does not affect all memory capacities equally. Older memories of the person's life (episodic memory), facts learned (semantic memory), and implicit memory (the memory of the body {{on how to do}} <b>things,</b> <b>such</b> as using a fork to eat or how to drink from a glass) are affected to a lesser degree than new facts or memories.|$|E
5|$|In the Hanzhong community, {{everyone}} {{was regarded as}} ill in some way. This was because sin caused qi to leave the body, and qi was necessary for life. In order to cure any illness, repentance was a crucial factor in ensuring {{that the loss of}} qi could be staunched. Repentance could be accomplished by spending time in a 'Chamber of Silence,' and reflecting on one's sins, or by beating one's breasts and kowtowing to heaven. Illness could be cured in other ways as well, such as using medicinal herbs and by listening to ritual music. Eating very little was also of extreme importance, and an ideal diet would consist of no food at all, but only of noncorporeal <b>things</b> <b>such</b> as air, which the person could absorb through meditation.|$|E
5|$|The cup {{appears in}} another {{inventory}} of CharlesV in 1400, {{and then is}} not recorded until it appears as the property of another royal uncle, and collector, John of Lancaster, 1st Duke of Bedford (1389–1435), son of HenryIV, who was briefly Regent of both France and England for his infant nephew HenryVI. How he acquired the cup is not known, {{but he would have}} received many gifts from CharlesVI, and had both lent the king money and bought from him <b>things</b> <b>such</b> as the library of the Palais du Louvre, in the uneasy period when Charles had made peace with the English and made HenryV his heir. After the death of his brother HenryV, Bedford struggled to stem the resurgent French resistance, which was energised by Joan of Arc. He died in Normandy in 1435, leaving HenryVI as his heir.|$|E

It was hard to tell which was the most surprised--Chatterer himself, Farmer Brown's boy, or Sammy Jay.|$|R
5|$|The {{reactors}} {{were used}} to undertake research related to weapons, such as investigations of the properties of tritium. Wartime experiments included measuring the neutron absorption cross-section of elements and compounds. Albert Wattenberg recalled that about 10 elements were studied each month, and 75 {{over the course of}} a year. An accident involving radium and beryllium powder caused a dangerous drop in his white blood cell count that lasted for three years. As the dangers of <b>things</b> <b>such</b> as inhaling uranium oxide became more apparent, experiments were conducted on the effects of radioactive substances on laboratory test animals.|$|E
5|$|U.S. {{taxation}} {{is generally}} progressive, especially the federal income taxes, and {{is among the}} most progressive in the developed world. The highest 10% of income earners pay a majority of federal taxes, and about half of all taxes. Payroll taxes for Social Security are a flat regressive tax, with no tax charged on income above $118,500 (for 2015 and 2016) and no tax at all paid on unearned income from <b>things</b> <b>such</b> as stocks and capital gains. The historic reasoning for the regressive nature of the payroll tax is that entitlement programs have not been viewed as welfare transfers. However, according to the Congressional Budget Office the net effect of Social Security is that the benefit to tax ratio ranges from roughly 70% for the top earnings quintile to about 170% for the lowest earning quintile, making the system progressive.|$|E
5|$|After the {{different}} {{components of a}} scene were finished, the team at Bones created its layout art; this included <b>things</b> <b>such</b> as determining the camera position throughout the scene and how movements would be done. The developers wanted to focus on how the characters' faces were drawn and animated, {{and make sure that}} the characters matched their respective in-game 3D models, so Fuse gave detailed feedback on the layouts, and drew over them in red to indicate what he wanted to be changed. These changes included corrections to off-model drawings, facial expressions, body postures, and character acting. Once the layouts had been approved, the animators drew the key animation, after which the in-between frames were drawn. Once the animated footage was completed, it was put together and rendered in stereoscopic 3D. Voice acting, music, sound effects, sound leveling and remixing was then done, and added to the cutscene.|$|E

5|$|Chi's {{character}} is voiced by Rie Tanaka, and Georgette Rose in its English counterpart. The anime and manga storylines are essentially the same, but they differ slightly. These differences include {{the events in}} the ending, other <b>things</b> <b>such</b> as describing Elda's memory loss, and her special program. In the anime for example, it is explained that Hibiya reset Elda's memories after her husband's death rather than Elda losing them when she took Freya's program in. Another difference is the special program that was placed into Elda in the anime, this program appears to have an alternate effect. If Chi finds the Person just for her, all persocoms would be granted the ability to feel emotion. The reason for this is since Ichiro Mihara was the creator of persocoms, he viewed them all as his children. His wish was that if Chi were able to find someone who loved her in return, all his children would be able to share in this happiness by being able to feel emotions the way humans do.|$|E
5|$|Holmes {{had served}} under Kit Carson and John C. Fremont, {{but he was}} old and {{physically}} impaired when he met Burnham. He had lost all of his family in the Indian wars and before he died he wanted to impart {{his knowledge of the}} frontier to the young Burnham. The two men traveled throughout the American Southwest and northern Mexico, and Holmes taught him many scouting skills, such as how to track a trail, how to double and cover one's own trail, how to properly ascend and descend precipices, and how to tell the time at night. Burnham also learned survival skills from Holmes, such as where to find water in the desert, how to protect himself from snakes, and what to do in case of forest fires or floods. A stickler for details, Holmes impressed on him that even in the simplest <b>things,</b> <b>such</b> as braiding a rope, tying a knot, or putting on or taking off a saddle, there is a right way and a wrong way. The two men earned a living by hunting and prospecting. Burnham also worked as a cowboy, a guard for the mines, a guide, and a scout during these years.|$|E
5|$|In {{his first}} match as leader, Miller scored 109 against Queensland. Taking 260minutes, {{it was the}} slowest century of his career. In another match against the touring South Africans, Miller elected to field and reduced his opponents to 3/3 {{and went on to}} win by five wickets. His players {{respected}} him, and some began to mimic his cough, voice, gait and idiosyncrasies. Richie Benaud unbuttoned his shirt in Miller's mould. He captained in an unorthodox manner, often trying unusual ploys to unsettle the opposition. He encouraged the opposition to attack in an attempt to get a wicket, and often shuffled his batting order to suit the circumstances of his batsmen. He was soon called before authorities after a match against South Australia. Sid Barnes, his 12th man, had come onto the ground with drinks, dressed as a flight attendant. He also brought <b>things</b> <b>such</b> as cigars, mirrors and combs. Barnes' antics extended the break longer than usual. Miller was called before the NSWCA after the South Australian Cricket Association lodged a complaint, and had to give an assurance that such an incident would not be repeated.|$|E
