In 2017, the uncertainty about whether <b>the</b> <b>payments</b> would continue caused Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina {{to try to}} raise premiums by 22.9 percent the next year, {{as opposed to an}} increase of only 8.8 percent that it would have sought if <b>the</b> <b>payments</b> were assured.|$|E

5|$|In late 2011, Oregon Senators Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley {{proposed}} legislation to extend <b>the</b> <b>payments</b> {{for another five}} years. The move was backed by Governor John Kitzhaber and the entire Oregon congressional delegation. Republican and Democratic members of Oregon's congressional delegation also proposed setting aside some of the federal land in Oregon as public trusts in which half would be designated for harvest to provide revenue for the counties, and half designated as a conservation area. President Barack Obama's proposed 2013 United States federal budget included $294 million to extend the program for fiscal year 2013 {{with a plan to}} continue <b>the</b> <b>payments</b> for four more years, with the amount declining 10% each year.|$|E

5|$|A final {{obstacle}} for the Port Authority {{was getting}} approval from New York City Mayor John Lindsay and the New York City Council, who {{raised concerns about}} the limited extent that the Port Authority involved {{the city in the}} negotiations and deliberations. Negotiations between The City of New York and the Port Authority were centered on tax issues. A final agreement was made on August 3, 1966, that the Port Authority would make annual payments to the City, in lieu of taxes, for the portion of the World Trade Center leased to private tenants. In subsequent years, <b>the</b> <b>payments</b> would rise as the real estate tax rate increased.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the late}} 12th century chronicler Roger of Howden, the main source for {{information}} on the 1198 carucage, assessments were carried out in county by a commission of two royal officials working in each hundred (a subdivision of a county). Each of these commissions included two local knights who would take sworn testimonies in each village from four villagers and the bailiffs or estate officials of those barons holding land in the village. The resulting assessments were recorded, and the sheriff, or chief royal official of the county, would receive the money and forward it to the treasury. Estate holders in the area were responsible for <b>the</b> <b>payments</b> from their estates, and when they were handed to the Exchequer a special procedure was followed to record <b>the</b> <b>payments,</b> which were then deposited into a dedicated set of accounts. These elaborate procedures were probably meant to avoid misappropriation of funds, but may not have been successful, as justices were later sent out to inquire into the commissioners' activities. As a result of their investigations, 23counties paid fines to secure an end to royal inquiries and any arrears in payments.|$|E

After denying his guilt for months, Agnew negotiated a plea agreement that would involve his resignation from office.

Agnew spent the remainder of his life quietly, rarely making public appearances. He wrote a novel, and also a memoir defending his actions. He died in 1996.|$|E

Bo faced three charges: bribery, abuse of power, and embezzlement. The prosectors alleged that Bo received the equivalent of some 21.79 million yuan (US$3.56 million) in bribes from businessmen Xu Ming and Tang Xiaolin. At the trial Xu Ming testified that he gave Bo's wife Gu Kailai $3.23 million in 2000 to buy the villa Fontaine St-Georges in Nice, France, and that he paid for their son Bo Guagua's travel and credit card bills. Bo Xilai cross-examined Xu and denied knowledge of many of <b>the</b> <b>payments.</b>|$|E
5|$|Brazil {{ordered the}} ship in 1911 as Rio de Janeiro from the British company Armstrong Whitworth. However, the {{collapse}} of Brazil's rubber boom and a warming in relations with Argentina, the country's chief rival, led to the ship's sale while under construction to the Ottoman Empire. The Ottomans renamed her Sultan Osman I, after the empire's founder, and the ship was nearly complete when World War I broke out. The British government seized her {{for use by the}} Royal Navy, together with another Ottoman dreadnought being constructed in Britain. This act caused resentment in the Ottoman Empire, as <b>the</b> <b>payments</b> for both ships were complete, and contributed to the decision of the Ottoman government to join the Central Powers.|$|E

40|$|Marriage is an {{institution}} that exists in all human societies. For most African cultures, it involves the bridegroom paying bride price to the bride’s family, what is known in Ndebele and Shona as amalobolo and roora respectively. <b>The</b> <b>payment</b> is made in ‘order to legalize the marriage’ and any marriage that does not involve <b>the</b> <b>payment</b> of <b>the</b> bride price ‘looks like casual sex or prostitution’. Bride price payment also exists in other non-African societies, but not all societies demand <b>the</b> <b>payment.</b> Hence, payment of bride price is not a universal human practice. This paper seeks to show the controversy that surrounds <b>the</b> <b>payment</b> of bride price in contemporary thinking.

Also in the renewed interest of women empowerment and emancipation, we argue that <b>the</b> <b>payment</b> of roora or amaloblolo is one of the hindrances of the women’s quest for freedom and emancipation. Payment of bride price is one of the traditional beliefs that in many ways encourage the violation of women’s human rights...|$|R
