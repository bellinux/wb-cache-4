5|$|Although sign theft {{has always}} been a problem along this highway, thefts reached {{epidemic}} proportions when the pending number change was announced. Within days of the announcement, virtually every US666 sign had been stolen, some for sale on eBay. Officials in Utah reported that five entire sign assemblies had been cut down with a chainsaw and stolen, while New Mexico officials reported that even signs welded to metal posts, as a <b>theft</b> <b>deterrent,</b> had been stolen. Officials speculated from one scene that someone had intentionally crashed a car into the sign post to break the welds.|$|E
25|$|All trim levels {{received}} a chrome exterior appearance package, factory remote start feature, XM Satellite Radio, telescoping steering wheel column, redundant steering wheel controls and dual-zone climate control as added standard equipment.

The L-types of this year were not available with a leather interior, but P-types were. Toyota added a standard factory <b>theft</b> <b>deterrent</b> system and the outside mirrors were equipped with a defogger that activated with the rear defroster. All Supras this year received automatic-off lights that also encompassed an automatic illuminated entry and fade-out system.|$|E
50|$|Some {{high-tech}} automotive {{keys are}} billed as <b>theft</b> <b>deterrents.</b> Mercedes-Benz uses a key that, {{rather than have}} a cut metal piece to start the car, uses an encoded infrared beam that communicates with the car's computer. If the codes match, the car can be started. These keys can be expensive to replace if lost and can cost up to US $400.|$|R
2500|$|Issa {{was able}} to use his {{knowledge}} of the weaknesses in automotive security that car thieves preyed on to develop effective <b>theft</b> <b>deterrents.</b> Using sensors that, when armed, would detect motion and pressure on the body of the car, his device would create loud noise to draw attention to a would-be car thief, such as the car's horn honking or a speaker playing a recording with Issa's voice saying: [...] "Protected by Viper. Stand back" [...] and [...] "Please step away from the car", warnings for DEI's signature product, the Viper car alarm. Sales grew from a million dollars in the company's first year to $14 million by 1989.|$|R
40|$|Philadelphia {{has many}} worries: from a declining economy, to a {{population}} decrease, to severe gun violence. The city suffers from these worries {{as well as}} high taxes, poor transportation options and few jobs for many workers, all detrimental {{the quality of life}} of Philadelphia citizens. Severe congestion, high costs of car ownership as the mounting price of public have severely impeded personal mobility in the city. One answer to this detrimental problem can be found in Europe, through public-use bicycles (PUBs). In over 60 European cities, PUBs have made an enormous impact on personal mobility, allowing citizens to access the city through bicycles, used as a part of public transportation. Through user accountability and <b>theft</b> <b>deterrents,</b> PUB programs provide citizens with a highly efficient and reliable transportation option. Philadelphia could benefit greatly from such a program. Through a study of successful PUB programs throughout the world, Philadelphia can garner information regarding implementation, funding, operation, and infrastructure. All this information will be put forth in order to deliberate on the best practices of other models and see them replicated in Philadelphia. It is hoped that, in the future, Philadelphia will have a very successful large-scale public-use bicycle program, the first of its kind in North America...|$|R

50|$|In {{the case}} of vehicle <b>theft,</b> the best <b>deterrent</b> to <b>theft</b> is in the {{installation}} of an approved vehicle anti theft passive immobilizer. Many vehicles have OEM (factory installed) units and afford protection through the ignition system. OEM immobilizers function through the ECM/PCM (computer) under {{the hood of the}} vehicle. In general terms, the RFID tag attached to the key must be read by the ECM in order to allow ignition to occur. Unfortunately, organized crime thieves are able to bypass these systems and steal any vehicle at will. An approved immobilizer uses a 3 circuit isolation system which thwarts even the most experienced thief.|$|R
50|$|On Japan's list of {{the most}} {{commonly}} stolen vehicles the HiAce currently resides in first place. Because of a lack of a theft immobilizer, it is fairly easy to steal a HiAce, as opposed to much more valuable SUVs and sports cars, which have more sophisticated <b>theft</b> <b>deterrent</b> systems.|$|E

50|$|An early {{version of}} a car alarm {{for use as a}} <b>theft</b> <b>deterrent</b> was invented by an unknown {{prisoner}} from Denver in 1913. This version was manually armed, and triggered when someone tried to crank the engine. A later alarm inspired by an {{early version of}} a remote starter was published in 1916. This version had the car owner carry a receiver, which would buzz if the car ignition system was tampered with.|$|E

50|$|The {{commercials}} {{focus on}} the Trunk Monkey, a fictional dealer-installed option on cars. The optional feature consists of a live chimpanzee inside the trunk and a special button in the passenger compartment. The button is pressed in situations {{not found in the}} user's manual such as handling irate drivers in traffic, dealing with unruly children throwing eggs at the car, negotiating with highway patrol officers after being pulled over, helping deliver a child when a nearby hospital is not accessible, or dispatching a gang in the parking lot. The Trunk Monkey is also portrayed as an effective <b>theft</b> <b>deterrent,</b> as seen in one commercial where the chimpanzee knocks out a would-be car thief and throws him off a bridge. The chimpanzee also administers first aid to the driver after an accident. In addition, its security abilities are effective during a driver's daughter's first date or an alien invasion.|$|E

5000|$|In New Mexico's {{motion to}} {{renumber}} the highway, they selected U.S. Route 393. Since the route came nowhere near US 93, AASHTO instead suggested US 491, noting it as {{a branch of}} US 191 at Monticello, Utah. Although the next three-digit child of US 91 would have been U.S. Route 291, both the 291 and 391 designations were already in use as state route numbers {{in at least one}} of the affected states. At the news that the motion had passed, a New Mexico spokesperson stated, [...] "The devil's out of here, and we say goodbye and good riddance." [...] Referring to the motion passing with a different number from what New Mexico requested, another spokesperson responded, [...] "As long as it's not 666 and it's nothing satanic, that's OK."

50|$|According to an August 2016 {{report by}} Bloomberg Businessweek, {{aggressive}} cost-cutting decisions {{that began in}} 2000 when Lee Scott took over as CEO of the company led to {{a significant increase in}} crime in stores across the United States. These included the removal of the store's famed greeters, which are seen as a <b>theft</b> <b>deterrent</b> at exits, the replacement of many cashiers with self-checkout stations, and the addition of stores at a rate that exceeded the hiring of new employees, which led to a 19 percent increase in space per employee from a decade previous. While these decisions succeeded in increasing profits 23 percent in the decade that followed, it led to an increase in both theft and violent crime. During 2016, the year the report was published, more than 200 violent crimes, including attempted kidnappings and multiple stabbings, shootings, and murders, occurred at the 4,500 Walmarts in the U.S., or about one a day, with petty crimes committed on Walmart properties nationwide predicted to be in the hundreds of thousands {{by the end of that}} year. In 2015, under CEO Doug McMillon, Walmart began a company-wide campaign to reduce crime that includes spot-checking receipts at exits, stationing employees at self-checkout areas, eye-level security cameras in high-theft areas, use of data analytics to detect credit fraud, hiring off-duty police and private security officers, and reducing calls to police with a program by which first-time offenders caught stealing merchandise below a certain value can avoid arrest if they agree to go through a theft-prevention program. Police chiefs and their officers in various locations around the U.S., however, were quoted in the report stating that the problem was continuing unabated, and that the need for constant police presence at Walmarts was a drain on police resources, one that Walmart needed to address by doing more to combat crime at its stores.|$|E

To use the Car Jacker, a software application must be installed on an Android smartphone and hardware must be installed in the vehicle. To ensure they are paire...|$|E
40|$|Cryptographic {{algorithms}} {{have always}} relied on stored keys for {{the provision of}} security services. Since these keys are stored on a system this makes them prone to attack. Efforts to increase the key size makes brute forcing difficult but does not eliminate key theft. This thesis proposes a comprehensive security framework for groups of devices. The research makes four major contributions to improve the security of devices in the multiparty environment. The proposed framework uses the novel Integrated Circuit Metric (ICMetric) technology which proposes utilizing measurable properties and features of a device to create a device identification. This device identification called the ICMetric is used to create cryptographic keys which are then used in the designed cryptosystems. The first contribution of the thesis is the creation of an ICMetric using sensors found in modern smart devices. The research explores both explicit and implicit features which can be used to generate of an ICMetric. The second contribution of this research is the creation of a group ICMetric which is computed using the device ICMetric. The computation of the device ICMetric is a particular challenge as it has to be computed without violating the properties of the ICMetric technology. The third contribution is the demonstration that an ICMetric can be used for the creation of symmetric key. The fourth contribution of this research is an efficient RSA based asymmetric key generation scheme for the multiparty environment. Designing a system using widely accepted cryptographic primitives does not guarantee a secure system therefore the security of proposed schemes has been studied under the standard model. The schemes presented in this thesis attempt to improve the security of devices in the group environment. The schemes demonstrate that key <b>theft</b> <b>deterrent</b> technologies can be incorporated into cryptographic schemes to offer higher levels of security and privacy...|$|E
40|$|This {{document}} {{is provided by}} the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) ONLY as an historical reference for the public health community. It is no longer being maintained and the data it contains may no longer be current and/or accurate. The Hazardous Substances Emergency Events Surveillance (HSEES) system, maintained by the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR), actively collects information to describe the public health consequences of acute releases of hazardous substances in 15 states. This report summarizes the characteristics of events reported to ATSDR by all participating state health departments in 2004. Information about acute events involving hazardous substances was collected, including the substance(s) released, number of victims, number and types of injuries, and number of evacuations. The data were computerized using an ATSDR-provided Web-based data entry system. A total of 7, 744 events was reported. In 6, 835 (88. 3 %) events, only one substance was released. The most commonly reported categories of substances were other inorganic substances (excluding chemicals in the categories of acids, bases, ammonia, and chlorine), volatile organic compounds, and mixtures involving substances from different categories that were mixed or formed from a reaction before release. During this reporting period, 620 events (8. 0 % of all reported events) resulted in a total of 1, 838 victims, 41 of whom (2. 4 %) died. The most frequently reported injuries were respiratory irritation, headaches, and dizziness/central nervous system symptoms. Evacuations were ordered for 499 (6. 4 %) events. Findings regarding the percentage of events involving victims and the distribution of types of injuries reported have been consistent in recent years. Topics targeted in 2004 included 1) disaster preparedness, 2) methamphetamine lab awareness activities, 3) outreach to specific groups using ammonia, chlorine, cleaning products, acids, and mercury, 4) outreach to targeted populations including children, responders, the transportation industry, and 5) special interest topics including carbon monoxide poisonings from underground utility fires and exposure to tearing agents from <b>theft</b> <b>deterrent</b> devices...|$|E
