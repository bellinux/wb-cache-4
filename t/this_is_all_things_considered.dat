So color seemed a natural material to use, because color is abstract. If you make a form that appears to be composed of color, then you have something, an object, that's pretty abstract. Just form alone would be more abstract, of course, because it's just a mental idea, but you don't have anything there for your perceptions to grapple with unless you make it out of a material. However, if you make it out of metal, or stone, or wood, or whatever, then you have something that to my mind may overemphasize the physical aspect and therefore be difficult to perceive as purely mental. An important thought behind <b>this</b> <b>is</b> that <b>all</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> essentially mental - that matter, while quite real on the one hand, is on the other hand composed of energy, and in turn, of pure thought." ...|$|R

5000|$|Nāgārjuna's major {{thematic}} {{focus is}} the concept of śūnyatā, or [...] "emptiness," [...] which brings together other key Buddhist doctrines, particularly anātman [...] "not-self" [...] and pratītyasamutpāda [...] "dependent origination", to refute the metaphysics of some of his contemporaries. For Nāgārjuna, as for the Buddha in the early texts, it is not merely sentient beings that are [...] "selfless" [...] or non-substantial; <b>all</b> phenomena (dhammas) <b>are</b> without any svabhāva, literally [...] "own-being", [...] "self-nature", or [...] "inherent existence" [...] and thus without any underlying essence.

40|$|Nāgārjuna’s “middle path” charts {{a course}} between two extremes: Nihilism, and Absolutism, not unlike earlier Buddhism. However, as early Buddhists countinanced {{constituents}} of reality as characterizable by essences while macroscopic objects lack such essences, Nāgārjuna argues that <b>all</b> <b>things</b> lack {{what he calls}} svabhāva – “own being” – the Sanskrit term for essence. Since everything lacks an essence, it is Empty (śūnya). To lack an essence is to lack autonomy. The corollary of <b>this</b> <b>is</b> that <b>all</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> interrelated. The Mahāyāna (Great Vehicle) school of Buddhist thought draws heavily on <b>this</b> insight: if <b>all</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> related, individualism has {{to give way to}} inclusivity. According to Nāgārjuna, the key to understanding his Middle path philosophy is dharma: ethics. It is only by a prior commitment to ethics that we can properly understand the Buddha's philosophy as teaching no doctrine of reality, for it is not a teaching of metaphysics, but of ethics, which is to say, Dharma. At the center of Dharma is a kind of Contractualism of the Buddhist community (saṅga). A failure to approach emptiness via ethics is like trying to hold a snake dangerously. However, approaching the emptiness of reality via ethics is grounds for optimism: nothing is stuck by essence, and we have reason to believe in positive change made possible by prudent ethical choice. In this module I consider some objections to Nāgārjuna's position from Vedic positions, and Yoga, and identify responses available to Nāgārjuna...|$|R

50|$|In the {{classical}} view, the {{expansionary fiscal policy}} also decreases net exports, which has a mitigating effect on national output and income. When government borrowing increases interest rates it attracts foreign capital from foreign investors. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> because, <b>all</b> other <b>things</b> being equal, the bonds issued from a country executing expansionary fiscal policy now offer {{a higher rate of}} return. In other words, companies wanting to finance projects must compete with their government for capital so they offer higher rates of return. To purchase bonds originating from a certain country, foreign investors must obtain that country's currency. Therefore, when foreign capital flows into the country undergoing fiscal expansion, demand for that country's currency increases. This causes the currency to appreciate, reducing the cost of imports and making exports from that country more expensive to foreigners. Consequently, exports decrease and imports increase, reducing demand from net exports.|$|R
40|$|Th e Renaissance did {{not merely}} rediscover the “human being ” – as is {{commonly}} known – but also discovered anew (perhaps even primarily) the human soul. Th e most prominent Florentine philosopher {{of the second}} half of the Quattrocento, Marsilio Ficino, 1 defi ned the soul in terms of “the bond of the world ” (copula mundi) that binds the lower and upper levels of being, this Here and that Th ere: “Th e soul is the middle level of being. It links and unites all the levels above it and below it when it ascends to the higher and descends to the lower levels ” (Ficino, 2002, 21). In his book titled Th eologia Platonica (Th e Platonic Th eology), Ficino associated classical Platonism (i. e. Plato himself) and particularly Neoplatonism (Plotinus, Proclus et al.) with Christian theology and biblical tradition. Th e subtitle of his book is “On the Immortality of Souls ” (in the plural), since Ficino, by referring to Plato, tried to prove the immortality of the individual soul. Furthermore, a prominent role in his Renaissance Platonism is assumed by symbolic thought (analogies, metaphors, images as imagines in general) which is quite diff erent to the conceptually abstract Aristotelian scholastics of the late Middle Ages. In accordance with Renaissance reverence for a human being, Ficino says: Th is [the human soul] is the greatest miracle in nature. For the remaining things below God are each individually something singular in themselves, but <b>this</b> essence <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>things</b> together. It possesses within itself images of things divine (imagines divinorum) on which it depends, and these images are the reasons (rationes) and paradigms (exemplaria) of the lower entities which in some sense it produces (Ficino, 2002, 25). * Th e Slovene version of <b>this</b> article <b>is</b> available on...|$|R

40|$|My work {{focuses on}} the reality and life of mental objects. The unseen {{masquerade}} as the seen, not only in our mind 2 ̆ 7 s eye but as an immediate visual experience. To realize this I apply volumetric form to models of thought and present them {{in a variety of}} environments. The forms are derived from the fields of science and mathematics, specifically geometry and topology. Topology or 2 ̆ 2 rubber-sheet geometry, 2 ̆ 2 is the study of shapes whose essential attributes are unchanged by continuous deformation. The shapes are not defined by measurements of distance and angle, but by whether they can be transformed when bent, stretched, or shrunk. For these shapes I assemble environments which include architecture and devices from Italian Renaissance painting. In constructing the compositions I use an underlying geometric framework. The impetus for <b>this</b> device <b>is</b> that <b>all</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> hung on a structure of some sort, whether it be paint or metaphor. <b>This</b> device <b>is</b> also connected to Renaissance ideas of proving the divine through the employment of mathematics, or rather, using the tools of the exact sciences as a way of proving the unprovable.

Lassitude, giddiness, and headache came on as our exertions increased, and took away the pleasure I should otherwise have felt in contemplating by moonlight the varied phenomena, which seemed to crowd upon the restless imagination, in the different forms of mountain, glacier, moraine, lake, boulder and terrace.

It is impossible to begin observing too soon, or to observe too much: if the excursion is long, little is ever done on the way home; the bodily powers being mechanically exerted, the mind seeks repose, and being fevered through over-exertion, it can endure no train of thought, or be brought to bear on a subject.|$|R
40|$|In “Five Divisions”(Pañca-nikāya) of Pali sutras, {{considered}} the collected discourses of Sakyamuni and his disciples, there is preaching on “no definite answer”. This {{belongs to the}} “Kindred Sayings about No Definite Answer” (Avyākata-saṃyutta) in “The Division of Kindred Sayings”(Saṃyutta-nikāya). “No definite answer”(avyākata）means that the questions were not answered definitely by Sakyamuni, such as whether the world is eternal, whether {{the world is not}} eternal, whether the world is finite, whether the world is infinite, whether soul and body are identical, whether soul and body are different, whether the Tathāgata exists after death, whether the Tathāgata does not exist after death, whether the Tathāgata both exists and not exists after death, whether the Tathāgata neither exists nor not-exists after death, whether there is a self, whether there is not a self, and so on. Sakyamuni’s preaching consists of no definite answer and the reasons for it. But what is the true meaning of it? According to established theory in the Buddhist studies, it points that people should not be preoccupied with transcendental-metaphysical problems difficult to solve and should instead be entirely concerned only with laws of the phenomenal world and man's actual life. However, what is described as a reason for no definite answer in <b>this</b> preaching <b>is</b> that <b>all</b> <b>things,</b> including “world”, “soul”, “body”, “Tathāgata” and “self” are in reality "the Holy Truth" (ariyasacca) or "Nirvana" (nibbāna) that exceeds the phenomenon immanently. Therefore, it cannot be said, as if they were phenomenon, to be eternal, or not to be eternal, or to be finite, or to be infinite, or to be identical, or to be different, or to exist after death, or not to exist after death, or both to exist and not to exist after death, or neither to exist nor not to exist after death, or to be there, or not to be there, and so on. Thus, in conclusion {{it can be said that}} what is meant by Sakyamuni’s preaching on no definite answer, together with <b>all</b> other preaching, <b>is</b> that <b>all</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> the transcendent Truth...|$|R
40|$|The {{sporting}} arena {{is replete with}} examples and anecdotes of great inspirational coaches that have led teams to success, often {{in the face of}} adversity and against seemingly better opponents. The role of the coach in developing and motivating athletes has also been the focus of much research in sport psychology (e. g., Challaduria 1990; Smith & Smoll, 2007). Despite the ease with which one readily accepts that coaches can be inspirational, the sport coaching literature is somewhat devoid of research on inspirational coaches and the effects of such coaches on athletic success. The purpose of the current paper is to theoretically delineate the inspirational effects of coaches in sport. Given the relative paucity of inspiration-related research in sport we draw upon contemporary theories of leadership from organisational and military psychology (e. g., transformational and charismatic leadership theories). We propose a sport-specific model of leadership that centres around the vision, support, and challenge meta-cognitive model developed by Arthur and Hardy in military contexts. The model posits that â��greatâ�� coaches inspire their athletes by: (a) creating an inspirational vision of the future; (b) providing the necessary support to achieve the vision; and (c) providing the challenge to achieve the vision. The underlying proposition is that the vision provides meaning and direction for followersâ�� effort. That is, the vision serves as the beacon around which all the sweat, pain and sacrifice involved in achieving success at the highest level in sport is directed. At the heart of <b>this</b> model <b>is</b> the notion that athletes can achieve their dreams provided they are inspired to do so; <b>this</b> <b>is</b> because <b>all</b> other <b>things</b> being equal the person who is motivated to practice longer and train harder will ultimately be the best. The current paper will delineate the coachâ��s role in inspiring the athlete to train harder and longer...|$|R

I use this theory to explore the southern Illinois site of Kincaid Mounds during the latter portion of its Mississippian period occupation, with a focus on how community was constructed and maintained within and through time. I do so using evidence from the non-discursive aspects of ceramic and architectural manufacture under the assumption that the methods of producing these items are habituated and thus reveal communities of learning. I consider contextual evidence to determine what other factors may have been at play in the production of these goods. With statistical analyses, I explore the variation in the way things were made between several spatially discrete neighborhoods at Kincaid Mounds, and discuss those results in terms of the making and manipulation or maintenance of community at this pre-Columbian center, followed by a narrative history of the Middle and Late Kincaid phases. I contrast these finds with those of communities within two other Middle Mississippian regions, Greater Cahokia and the Central Illinois River Valley, in order to discuss the variable processes that led diverse and unique communities to participate in a much broader, imagined Mississippian community...|$|R
