25|$|The {{evolutionary}} {{history of the}} <b>three-toed</b> <b>sloths</b> is not well known. No particularly close relatives have yet been identified.|$|E
25|$|Sloths have short, flat heads, big eyes, short snouts, stout bodies, long limbs, {{and tiny}} ears. <b>Three-toed</b> <b>sloths</b> also have stubby tails about 5-6 cm long. Sloths {{are about the}} size of small dogs, with the head and body having a {{combined}} length of 50 to 70cm. Almost all mammals have seven cervical vertebrae, including those with very short necks, such as elephants and cetaceans, and those with very long necks, such as giraffes and camels. The few exceptions include manatees and two-toed sloths, which have only six cervical vertebrae, and <b>three-toed</b> <b>sloths</b> with nine cervical vertebrae.|$|E
25|$|Manatees are unusual amongst mammals in {{possessing}} {{just six}} cervical vertebrae, {{which may be}} due to mutations in the homeotic genes. All other mammals have seven cervical vertebrae, other than the two-toed and <b>three-toed</b> <b>sloths.</b>|$|E

25|$|Sloths {{were thought}} to be among the most somnolent animals, {{sleeping}} from 15 to 18 hours each day. In 2008, however, Dr. Neil Rattenborg and his colleagues from the Max Planck Institute for Ornithology in Starnberg, Germany, published a study testing sloth sleep patterns in the wild; this is the first study of its kind. The study indicated that sloths sleep just under 10 hours a day. <b>Three-toed</b> <b>sloths</b> are mostly diurnal, while two-toed sloths are nocturnal.|$|E
25|$|Sloths are mammals {{classified}} in {{the families}} Megalonychidae (two-toed sloths) and Bradypodidae (<b>three-toed</b> <b>sloths).</b> There are six extant species of sloths. They are named after the capital sin of sloth because they seem slow and lazy at first glance; however, their usual idleness is due to metabolic adaptations for conserving energy. Aside from their surprising bursts of speed during emergency flights from predators, other notable traits of sloths include their strong body, the ability to swim, {{and the fact that}} they host symbiotic algae on their fur.|$|E
25|$|However, their adaptations {{contradict}} the actual {{relationship of the}} two families, which are more distant from each other than their outward similarity suggests. The common ancestor of the two families lived around 35 Mya, making the living forms exceptional examples of convergent or parallel evolution. The modern two-toed sloths are far {{more closely related to}} the Megalonychidae ground sloths than to the living <b>three-toed</b> <b>sloths.</b> Whether the ground-dwelling Megalonychidae descended from tree-climbing ancestors or whether the two-toed sloths are really miniature ground sloths that have converted or reverted to arboreal life cannot be properly determined yet. The latter possibility seems slightly more likely, because the small ground sloths Acratocnus and Neocnus, which were also able to climb, are among the closer relatives of the two-toed sloths, and these together were related to the huge ground sloths Megalonyx and Megalocnus.|$|E

50|$|The pygmy <b>three-toed</b> <b>sloth</b> (Bradypus pygmaeus), {{also known}} as the monk sloth or dwarf sloth, is a sloth endemic to Isla Escudo de Veraguas, a small island off the coast of Panama. The species was first {{described}} by Robert P. Anderson of the University of Kansas and Charles O. Handley Jr., of the Smithsonian Institution in 2001. The pygmy <b>three-toed</b> <b>sloth</b> is significantly smaller than the other three members of its genus, but otherwise resembles the brown-throated <b>three-toed</b> <b>sloth.</b> According to Anderson and Handley Jr., the head-and-body length is between 48 and 53 cm, and the body mass ranges from 2.5 to 3.5 kg.|$|R

2500|$|Currently living sloths belong {{largely to}} two families, Megalonychidae ("two-toed" [...] sloths) and Bradypodidae (<b>three-toed</b> <b>sloths).</b> All living sloths {{have in fact}} three toes; the [...] "two-toed" [...] sloths, however, have only two fingers. Two-toed sloths {{generally}} move faster than <b>three-toed</b> <b>sloths.</b> Both types tend to occupy the same forests; in most areas, one species of three-toed sloth and one species of the larger two-toed sloth will jointly predominate.|$|E
