5|$|After {{attending}} a theatre show on March 18, Morgan Earp was assassinated by gunmen firing {{from a dark}} alley through a door window into a room where he was playing billiards. Morgan was struck in the right side. The bullet shattered his spine, passed through his left side, and lodged in the thigh of George A. B. Berry. Another round narrowly missed Wyatt. A doctor was summoned and Morgan was moved from <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>to</b> a nearby couch. The assassins escaped {{in the dark and}} Morgan died 40 minutes later.|$|E
5|$|Catherine {{was buried}} {{according}} to her wishes, but her tombstone was moved from <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>to</b> a wall of Ara Coeli during works on {{the interior of the}} church in 1590. The original epitaph was destroyed at that time, but the Roman calligrapher Giovanni Battista Palatino had recorded it in 1545 and published two years later. It was uniquely bilingual and digraphic, written both in Latin language and script and in Bosnian language and Cyrillic. Only the Latin epitaph was restored, and can be found on her tombstone today.|$|E

50|$|The First and Second Floors {{contain a}} series of {{classrooms}} opening onto a corridor running {{the length of the}} building on the southern side. There are panelled doors with toplights and double-hung windows between the classrooms and the corridor. The high ceilings, regular external windows and internal windows and doors provide substantial natural light and cross ventilation. <b>The</b> <b>floors</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> classrooms are timber, whilst <b>the</b> <b>floors</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> corridors, stairs and utilities are concrete. The two stairways, near either end of the building, have steel balustrades, cast newels and timber handrails.|$|R
5|$|He {{returned}} to South Australia to assist Charles Kingston in his government, but ultimately crossed <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>to</b> bring down Kingston over {{his plans to}} lessen {{the power of the}} Legislative Council. With the advent of Australian Federation, Playford became a Senator for South Australia. He was leader of the Senate and the 7th Minister for Defence. After one term as a Senator, Playford was defeated. He ran again in 1910, was unsuccessful, and retired to Kent Town, where he died in 1915 at the age of 78.|$|E
5|$|The Corn Store {{adjacent}} to the Chapel may originally {{have been used as}} accommodation for a gatekeeper or steward. By the late 17th century it had been converted into a grain store by raising <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>to</b> protect its contents from damp. Five oak-framed bins inside may have held barley for the Brew-house, which is now used as a toilet block.|$|E
5|$|The rifle, {{without the}} {{silencer}} or sights attached, {{was lying on}} her body pointing up at her neck. June's Bible lay on <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>to</b> the right of Sheila. It was normally kept in a bedside cupboard. June's fingerprints were on it, as were others {{that could not be}} identified, including one made by a child.|$|E

5|$|According to {{the list}} of largest {{shopping}} malls in Canada, the Scarborough Town Centre is the tenth largest in the country and the fourth largest in the GTA. It is located next to the Scarborough Civic Centre, Albert Campbell Square, and Consilium Place. This area was developed as a city centre under the old City of Scarborough government. The Scarborough Walk of Fame is also located in the Town Centre, consisting of plaques embedded in <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>to</b> honour notable residents, past and current. The inaugural inductees included National Basketball Association player Jamaal Magloire, Olympic gold medalist Vicky Sunohara, and eight prominent residents who contributed to advances in medicine, arts, and the community.|$|E
5|$|At its {{session of}} 23 November 2006, the {{planning}} {{committee of the}} city council charged its staff with examining how the Altes Stadthaus could be used for large-scale retail without damaging it as an architectural landmark. The report, which was presented at the end of December, recommended reuse of the already modified internal space housing the library, and creation of additional usable space up to a total of approximately 1600m². This could be done by lowering <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>to</b> street level and modifying stairway areas without changing the external appearance of the building, which is characteristic of government buildings of the 1920s, particularly in its blocky ground floor. Changes to the upper floors, which remained largely in their original condition, were not recommended.|$|E
5|$|Barkley also possessed {{considerable}} defensive talents led by {{an aggressive}} demeanor, foot speed and his capacity to read <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>to</b> anticipate for steals, a reason why he established his career as the second All-Time leader in steals for the power forward position {{and leader of the}} highest all-time steal per game average for the power forward position. Despite being undersized for both the small forward and power forward positions, he also finished among the all-time leaders in blocked shots. His speed and leaping ability {{made him one of the}} few power forwards capable of running down court to block a faster player with a chase-down block.|$|E

50|$|The {{completed}} {{building was}} a flat-slab structure, without crossbeams or a steel skeleton, which effectively meant {{that there was}} no way to transfer the load across <b>the</b> <b>floors.</b> <b>To</b> maximise <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> space, Lee Joon ordered <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> columns <b>to</b> be reduced to be 24 in thick, instead of the minimum of 31 in in the original blueprint that was required for the building to stand safely. In addition, columns were spaced 36 ft apart to maximize retail space, a decision that also meant that there was more load on each column than there would have been if the columns were closer together.|$|R
5|$|Benn {{was born}} in London on 3 April 1925. He had two brothers, Michael, who was older, and David, a {{specialist}} in Russia and Eastern Europe. Their father, William Wedgwood Benn, was a Liberal Member of Parliament from 1906 who crossed <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>to</b> the Labour Party in 1928 and was appointed Secretary of State for India by Ramsay MacDonald in 1929, a position he held until the Labour Party's landslide electoral defeat in 1931. William Benn was elevated to the House of Lords with the title of Viscount Stansgate in 1942 – the new wartime coalition government was short of working Labour peers in the upper house. In 1945–46, William Benn was the Secretary of State for Air in the first majority Labour Government.|$|E
5|$|Principal filming {{took place}} in Vancouver, British Columbia, with the crash scene being filmed on an old airport space with flat roads. However, other key {{sequences}} occurred in the studio. Because the fight scene between the Winchesters and Azazel at the climax was meant {{to take place in}} a secluded, forest-enclosed cabin, production built the set on a sound stage. Production designer Jerry Wanek felt the set was extremely important, as viewers would become uninterested if the forest looked fake. With Morgan rendered blind by the yellow contact lenses required to depict his character's demonic possession, the production crew placed sandbags on <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>to</b> help the actor locate his marks.|$|E
5|$|The UFA {{was in an}} {{uncertain}} position when Reid became Premier; besides Brownlee's resignation, longtime Minister of Public Works Oran McPherson {{was in the midst}} of a scandalous divorce and had also left cabinet, and UFA MLAs Peter Miskew and Omer St. Germain had crossed <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>to</b> the Liberals. Additionally, the province's economic condition remained poor. Liberal leader William R. Howson tried to take advantage of this to undermine the government and position himself as the province's next Premier; he attacked Reid relentlessly for what he alleged were spendthrift habits, and suggested the province's tax rates were causing the confiscation of family homes. Reid asserted in response that Alberta's taxes had decreased since 1921, and criticised Howson for simultaneously attacking government spending and demanding new infrastructure projects.|$|E

5|$|The copious {{amounts of}} blood spilled {{in the fight}} scenes came from bags of fake blood {{strapped}} to the performers' bodies. Animal blood gathered from slaughterhouses was poured onto <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>to</b> simulate puddles of human blood. Most of the times trick swords made from fiberglass were used when the scene called for a killing blow. Designed by Allder, these swords could also retract their blades, and several sprayed blood from their tips. Although the swords were intended to be safer alternatives to metal weapons, they could still be dangerous: {{in one of the}} fights, Bergman sparred with an extra who failed to follow the choreography and sliced open her finger.|$|E
5|$|The groom Shiva {{is shown}} calm and young, while Parvati is {{depicted}} as shy and emotional. Her head is tilted towards him and her eyelids joyfully lowered, while his hand (now broken) is holding hers. Their dress reflect the Hindu customs. He wears the sacred thread across his chest, she the customary jewelry. The other characters shown in the wedding carry items or are shown holding items that typically grace a Hindu wedding. Chandra (moon god), for example, holds a traditionally decorated water vessel (kalash). Brahma, the priest, is squatting on <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>to</b> the right tending the yajna fire (agni mandapa).|$|E
5|$|The show {{planned a}} {{dramatic}} stunt which {{would lead to}} the discovery of Callum's body. The scene featured Carla Connor (Alison King) causing a car accident, colliding with Tyrone Dobbs' (Alan Halsall) pick-up truck which smashes into the Platt's home. This causes <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>to</b> give way and a recovery team unearthing Callum's body. Producers decided to conclude the story without Kylie being held accountable for the murder. Instead they used a character that had been recently killed off, Tony Stewart (Terence Maynard), who had publicly feuded with Callum. When Sarah confesses the truth to Todd Grimshaw (Bruno Langley), he decides to frame Tony for the crime–a scheme which proved successful.|$|E
