5|$|On January 27, 1967, {{the date}} of the Apollo 1 fire, Armstrong was in Washington, D.C., with Gordon Cooper, Dick Gordon, Jim Lovell and Scott Carpenter for the signing of the United Nations Outer Space Treaty. The astronauts chatted with the {{assembled}} dignitaries until 6:45p.m. when Carpenter went to the airport, and the others returned to the Georgetown Inn, where they each found messages to phone the Manned Spacecraft Center. During these telephone calls, they learned of the deaths of Gus Grissom, Ed White and Roger Chaffee.

A {{rickshaw}} driver says that he can take only one of them. Jean sees it as a sign that it is time to split with Douglas; she bids him farewell and departs. He winds up at another hotel, discovering that it's nothing more than a brothel and drug den, and spends <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> wandering the streets. He returns to the hotel just as Evelyn is leaving for work, and asks her out on a date. A closing montage with a voiceover shows Muriel checking in customers in an elegant renovated lobby, Madge dining with a handsome older Indian man, and Norman and Carol living happily together.

5|$|Moving {{by itself}} and {{completely}} {{cut off from}} all other units, G Company, numbering only about 80 men, was hardest hit. At 08:00, nearing the top of Hill 464, it surprised and killed three North Korean soldiers. Soon after, North Korean automatic weapons and small arms fire struck the company. All day G Company maneuvered around the hill but never gained its crest. At mid-afternoon it received radio orders to withdraw that night. The company left six dead on the hill and, carrying its wounded on improvised litters of ponchos and tree branches, it started down the shale slopes of the mountain in rain and darkness. Halfway down, friendly fire injured Captain Herman L. West, the G Company commander. The company scattered but West reassembled it. Cautioning his men to move quietly and not to fire their weapons, West led his men to the eastern base of Hill 464 where he went into a defensive position for <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>night.</b>|$|E

5|$|With the Chinese infiltrating the Canadian {{perimeter}} {{through the}} gaps between platoons, D Company was close to being surrounded. The company commander—Captain J.G.W. Mills—was subsequently forced to call down artillery fire onto his own position on several occasions during the early morning of 25 April to avoid being overrun. The tactic succeeded and the exposed Chinese were soon swept off the position, while the dug-in Canadians escaped unharmed. The Chinese persisted however, launching a number of smaller attacks during <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>night,</b> but these were again repulsed by artillery and small arms fire. By dawn {{the attacks on the}} Canadian positions had abated, and with D Company remaining in control of the summit they were able to recover the previously abandoned machine-gun at first light. Meanwhile, on the right flank B Company was also able to re-occupy the platoon position it had been forced to relinquish earlier the previous evening. The Chinese had suffered heavily during the night, with perhaps as many as 300 killed by the Patricias.|$|E
5|$|Harry and Debbie punish Annie by not {{allowing}} {{her to go to}} Naomi's party. When they reconsider and decide to let her go, they discover that she has already left. Harry goes to the party to find Annie, but is instead told by Tracy that they have a son together, whom she gave up for adoption over twenty years ago. Adrianna, who had previously stolen money from Naomi's purse, claims to have found it and gives it back. Naomi checks her phone messages and learns that Ethan is cheating on her. Naomi asks Ethan if he is really cheating on her, and leaves the party after he fails to answer. Annie leaves with Silver for another party on the beach, where she apologizes to Ethan for revealing that he was cheating on Naomi. When she asks why he told the truth about Dixon not starting the fight, he replies that he is trying to be the good guy he used to be. Annie, Silver, Dixon and Navid spend <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> swimming at the beach. In the closing scenes, Kelly talks to the father of her four-year-old son, Adrianna pays her drug dealer with money she stole from Naomi, and Ethan visits Naomi's house.|$|E
5|$|The 3rd Parachute Brigade was {{the first}} unit of the Airborne Division to arrive in Palestine, {{disembarking}} at Haifa on 3 October 1945. The brigade then moved to Gaza to acclimatise and regain their fitness after the voyage from England. On 21 October the brigade was deployed around the Lydda district, with responsibility for Tel Aviv and Jaffa. The first incident involving the brigade came on 14 November 1945, when the Jewish National Council called for a 12-hour strike, which resulted in rioting in Tel Aviv. By 18:15 the Palestine Police Force was unable to cope and sent for reinforcements from the 8th Parachute Battalion. The complete battalion was deployed and the riot was under control by 21:40 and a curfew imposed for <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>night.</b> Early the following day the curfew was broken by large crowds gathering to loot and burn buildings, so {{the remainder of the}} brigade was deployed to the city under the codename Operation Bellicose. Night time curfews remained in place until 05:20 on 20 November, when all troops returned to their barracks. All was quiet in the brigade area until the night of 26/27 December, when police stations in Jaffa and Tel Aviv, the railway at Lydda and an armoury at Tel Aviv were attacked. The brigade again imposed a curfew around Tel Aviv. This was followed by cordon and search operations: Pintail on 29 December, Heron on 8 January, and Pigeon on 30 January.|$|E

5|$|Using the {{retreating}} South Korean troops {{to cover their}} movements, the Chinese had infiltrated the brigade position {{in the initial stages}} of the battle, penetrating between A and B Companies, 3 RAR astride the road, and largely surrounding the latter before moving into the rear positions. The Australians struggled to distinguish the Chinese from the South Koreans in the dark, although the Korean Service Corps porters attached to the battalion were able to provide valuable assistance to the defenders distinguishing the Chinese by the sounds of their voices. At 21:30 the Chinese launched their first attack on the forward platoon of American tanks, which had been posted on the road without infantry support. The initial moves were easily repelled; however, a stronger attack an hour later forced the tanks to withdraw after two of the tank commanders were killed, including the platoon commander. The Chinese then proceeded to assault the Australians on two different axes: one against the two forward companies in front of Hill 504, and the other through the valley astride the road around Battalion Headquarters. Finally, by 23:00 the New Zealand artillery had returned to the brigade, although they provided only limited support throughout <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>night.</b>|$|E
5|$|Chamberlain {{made the}} First Team of the All-America squad and led his Jayhawks into the NCAA finals against the Tar Heels of North Carolina. In that game, Tar Heels coach Frank McGuire used several unorthodox tactics to thwart Chamberlain. For the tip-off, {{he sent his}} {{shortest}} player, Tommy Kearns, in order to rattle Chamberlain, and the Tar Heels spent <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> triple-teaming him, one defender in front, one behind, and a third arriving {{as soon as he}} got the ball. With their fixation on Chamberlain, the Jayhawks shot only 27% from the field, as opposed to 64% of the Tar Heels, and trailed 22–29 at halftime. Later, North Carolina led 40–37 with 10 minutes to go and stalled the game: they passed the ball around without any intention of scoring a basket. After several Tar Heel turnovers, the game was tied at 46 at the end of regulation. In the first overtime each team scored two points, and in the second overtime Kansas froze the ball in return, keeping the game tied at 48. In the third overtime, the Tar Heels scored two consecutive baskets, but Chamberlain executed a three-point play, leaving KU trailing 52–51. After King scored a basket, Kansas was ahead by one point, but then Tar Heel Joe Quigg was fouled on a drive with 10 seconds remaining and made his two foul shots. For the final play, Dick Harp called for Ron Loneski to pass the ball into Chamberlain in the low post. The pass was intercepted, however, and the Tar Heels won the game. Nonetheless, Chamberlain, who scored 23 points and 14 rebounds, was elected the Most Outstanding Player of the Final Four. Cherry has speculated, however, that this loss was a watershed in Chamberlain's life, because it was the first time that his team lost despite him putting up impressive individual stats. Chamberlain later admitted that this loss was the most painful of his life.|$|E
