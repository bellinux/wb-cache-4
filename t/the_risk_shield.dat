40|$|This paper {{describes}} a theoretical approach to compare {{two types of}} fiber reinforced composite materials for femoral component of hip implants. The natural fiber reinforced composite implant is compared with carbon fiber reinforced composite {{and the results are}} evaluated against the control solution of a metallic implant made of titanium alloy. With identical geometry and loading condition, the composite implants assumed lower stresses, thus induced more loads to the bone and consequently reduced <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of stress <b>shielding,</b> whilst the natural fiber reinforced composite showed promising result compared with carbon fibers. However, natural fibers, as well as carbon fibers, lack the power to improve interface debonding due to excessive loads in interface. Nevertheless, natural fiber reinforced composite could be an appropriate alternative given its capability of tailoring and achieving the optimal fiber orientation and robust design. <br /...|$|R

Using a disruptive experience in an immersive theatrical storytelling performance as a catalyst to deconstruct and raise consciousness about the author’s privilege and her own role in research, this article seeks to unpack the politics at play in qualitative research in social and political psychology. The extent to which our privileged role and our identity as researchers are nested in history, in systems, and in structures is explored, and <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> that this <b>shields</b> us {{from being able to}} truly understand the reality, or epistemology, of the vulnerable groups we are seeking to investigate, is examined. The notion of unknowing the researcher’s vulnerability in research is discussed, along with the ways in which systems and structures have allowed researchers to maintain emotional control and dominance in knowledge production. Moreover, through othering vulnerable emotions and legitimising a researcher’s position as emotion-free, value-free, neutral, and objective, we may continue to engender epistemological injustice. Finally, the author emphasizes the importance of reflexivity and re-searching researchers’ humility as ways to address this challenge...|$|R

Many researchers have investigated electromagnetic field behaviour in solid metal, but {{little of this}} work has probed into {{the effects of a}} wire mesh. The primary goal of this work is to design wire mesh shielding under overhead power lines to investigate the electromagnetic energy transmitted to the ground and possibly can exposed people under certain <b>risk.</b> <b>The</b> electromagnetic <b>shielding</b> of wire-mesh screens is discussed in the frequency range where the individual meshes are electrically small) 1. 0 (λ<L. The screen, whose meshes are assumed to be square, its applicability to the measurement of mesh properties is described. The low-frequency magnetic shielding afforded by mesh enclosures is considered. Because of the reactive character of the mesh surface, the near field source shielding effectiveness decreases with increasing frequency. The enclosure magnetic-field shielding effectiveness increases with increasing frequency, but saturates at a maximum value that depends on the geometry of the mesh size, and the mesh wire radius. The enclosure electrostatic-field shielding effectiveness depends only on the enclosure and mesh geometries. Experimentally, shielding effectiveness measurements have been performed.

40|$|The use of {{high power}} CO 2 lasers in welding enables {{processing}} with {{high laser intensities}} at the workpiece which is connected {{with the formation of}} a laser induced plasma at the surface of the workpiece. Therefore the effect of deep penetration welding by formation of a plasma filled keyhole and plasma plume above the workpiece is possible, including <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of plasma <b>shielding,</b> which means strong absorption of the incident laser beam above the workpiece and thus interruption of the welding process. The conditions for ignition of plasma shielding, which is determined by electron density, are mainly influenced by laser intensity, process gas and material. Variations of these parameters have been conducted in order to find limits for the appearance of plasma shielding. Experimental data are used to verify a model concerning the absorption mechanism of a stationary shielding plasma state. The dynamic behaviour is treated by time resolved spectroscopic analysis of the light emitted by th e plasma above the workpiece yielding monitoring signals that have a strong correlation with the formation of plasma shielding. Based on these investigations a closed-loop process control in continuous high power laser welding has been developed. Using the intensity of a spectral line of laser induced plasma as monitoring signal and the regulation of laser intensity via laser power, plasma shielding can be suppressed. From the industrial point of view increase in economy and reliability of the laser welding process combined with quality improvements which are induced by the application of the plasma shielding controller (PSC) are of great importance. For this reason three examples for PSC application are presented...|$|R
40|$|Orbiting the Earth {{are spent}} rocket stages, non-functioning satellites, {{hardware}} from satellite deployment and staging, fragments of exploded spacecraft, and other relics of decades of space exploration: orbital debris. The United States Space Command tracks and maintains {{a catalog of}} the largest objects. The catalog contains over 7000 objects. Recent studies have assessed the debris environment {{in an effort to}} estimate the number of smaller particles and the probability of a collision causing catastrophic damage to a functioning spacecraft. The results of the studies can be used to show, for example, that the likelihood of a collision of a particle larger than about one centimeter in diameter with the International Space Station during a 10 -year period is a few percent, roughly in agreement with earlier estimates for Space Station Freedom. Particles greater than about one centimeter in diameter pose <b>the</b> greatest <b>risk</b> to <b>shielded</b> spacecraft. There are on the order of 105 such particles in low Earth orbit. The United States National Space Policy, begun in 1988, is to minimize debris consistent with mission requirements. Measures such as venting unused fuel to prevent explosions, retaining staging and deployment hardware, and shielding against smaller debris have been taken by the U. S. and other space faring nations. There is at present no program to remove debris from orbit. The natural tendency for upper atmospheric drag to remove objects from low Earth orbit is more than balanced by {{the increase in the number}} of debris objects from new launches and fragmentation of existing objects. In this paper I describe a concept under study by the Program Development Laboratory of Marshall Space Flight Center and others to remove debris with a ground-based laser.

40|$|We discuss {{calculations}} of probability distribution functions (PDF) representing uncertainties in projecting fatal cancer risk from {{galactic cosmic rays}} (GCR) and solar particle events (SPE). The PDF s are used in significance tests {{of the effectiveness of}} potential radiation shielding approaches. Uncertainties in risk coefficients determined from epidemiology data, dose and dose-rate reduction factors, quality factors, and physics models of radiation environments are considered in models of cancer risk PDF s. Competing mortality risks and functional correlations in radiation quality factor uncertainties are treated in the calculations. We show that <b>the</b> cancer <b>risk</b> uncertainty, defined as the ratio of the 95 % confidence level (CL) to the point estimate is about 4 -fold for lunar and Mars mission risk projections. For short-stay lunar missions (180 d) or Mars missions, GCR risks may exceed radiation risk limits, with 95 % CL s exceeding 10 % fatal risk for males and females on a Mars mission. For reducing GCR cancer <b>risks,</b> <b>shielding</b> materials are marginally effective because of the penetrating nature of GCR and secondary radiation produced in tissue by relativistic particles. At the present time, polyethylene or carbon composite shielding can not be shown to significantly reduce risk compared to aluminum shielding based on a significance test that accounts for radiobiology uncertainties in GCR risk projection...|$|R

Since the HZE spectra decline rapidly with energy and HZE attenuation in materials is limited by their penetration power, details of the mass distributions about the sensitive tissues (shielding materials and the astronaut's body) are important determining factors of the exposure levels. Typical space suit and lightly shielded structures allow significant contributions from HZE components to some critical body tissues and have important implications on <b>the</b> models for <b>risk</b> assessment. Only a heavily shielded equipment room of a space vehicle or habitat provides sufficient shielding for the early response at sensitive organs from this event.
