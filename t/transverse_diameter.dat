40|$|SummaryBackground/ObjectiveAbout 20 % of biliary atresia (BA) {{survivors}} have {{attacks of}} esophageal variceal bleeding. We propose {{a method to}} evaluate the risk of esophageal variceal bleeding (EVB) using noninvasive indices by multislice computed tomography (CT). MethodsWe reviewed 31 potential living-related liver recipients aged 99 – 5314 days (mean, 1474 days) who underwent CT examinations using a 64 -slice multislice CT scanner. Of the 31 patients, 19 patients (Group A) with fecal occult blood had EVB on esophagogastroduodenoscopy; the rest belonged to Group B. Splenic diameters (mm) were divided by body heights (m) and platelet counts (1000 /mm 3) to produce standardized ratios of transverse splenic length/body height/platelet count (SLHPR). The <b>transverse</b> <b>diameters</b> of paraesophageal veins (PVs) and perigastric veins (PGVs) were measured adjacent to the lower thoracic esophagus and within the lesser sac, respectively. ResultsAccording to a receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, the SLHPRs (r= 0. 833), transverse PV (r= 0. 957), and PGV (r= 0. 987) diameters were better predictors of EVB than demographic and laboratory variables. However, the <b>transverse</b> <b>diameters</b> of PGVs and PVs were the most accurate predictors of the EVB.

6000|$|Prof. Faye {{remarks that}} [...] "a still greater {{preponderance}} of males would be met with, if death struck both sexes in equal proportion {{in the womb}} and during birth. But the fact is, that for every 100 still-born females, we have in several countries from 134.6 to 144.9 still-born males. During the first {{four or five years}} of life, also, more male children die than females, for example in England, during the first year, 126 boys die for every 100 girls--a proportion which in France is still more unfavourable." [...] (51. 'British and Foreign Medico-Chirurg. Review,' April 1867, p. 343. Dr. Stark also remarks ('Tenth Annual Report of Births, Deaths, etc., in Scotland,' 1867, p. xxviii.) that [...] "These examples may suffice to show that, at almost every stage of life, the males in Scotland have a greater liability to death and a higher death-rate than the females. The fact, however, of this peculiarity being most strongly developed at that infantile period of life when the dress, food, and general treatment of both sexes are alike, seems to prove that the higher male death-rate is an impressed, natural, and constitutional peculiarity due to sex alone.") Dr. Stockton Hough accounts for these facts in part by the more frequent defective development of males than of females. We have before seen that the male sex is more variable in structure than the female; and variations in important organs would generally be injurious. But the size of the body, and especially of the head, being greater in male than female infants is another cause: for the males are thus more liable to be injured during parturition. Consequently the still-born males are more numerous; and, as a highly competent judge, Dr. Crichton Browne (52. 'West Riding Lunatic Asylum Reports,' vol. i. 1871, p. 8. Sir J. Simpson has proved that the head of the male infant exceeds that of the female by 3/8ths of an inch in circumference, and by 1/8th in <b>transverse</b> <b>diameter.</b> Quetelet has shewn that woman is born smaller than man; see Dr. Duncan, 'Fecundity, Fertility, and Sterility,' 1871, p. 382.), believes, male infants often suffer in health for some years after birth. Owing to this excess in the death-rate of male children, both at birth and for some time subsequently, and owing to the exposure of grown men to various dangers, and to their tendency to emigrate, the females in all old-settled countries, where statistical records have been kept, are found to preponderate considerably over the males.

40|$|<b>Transverse</b> Cerebellar <b>Diameter</b> (TCD) {{is a more}} {{accurate}} & better predictor of gestational age in normal {{as well as in}} IUGR fetuses. In intra uterine growth restricted (IUGR) Fetuses, the <b>transverse</b> cerebellar <b>diameter</b> does not get affected due to insufficiency of fetal circulation and so can be used as an unbiased measurement of gestational age (GA).

The cerebellum is easily visualized sonographically. The aim {{of this study was to}} establish ‘Correlation between TCD & GA in Normal & IUGR fetuses’. The study group comprised of 650 cases.
