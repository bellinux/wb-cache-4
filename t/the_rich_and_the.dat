5|$|The {{controversial}} {{study has}} met with mixed reactions since its publication. Though praised by some contemporary and modern reviewers, and once cited in a speech by Harold L.

5|$|The telenovela {{features}} Facundo Arana and Natalia Oreiro, {{who both}} {{appeared in the}} successful telenovela Muñeca Brava, as lead actors. The {{relationship between the two}} was more than professional; Facundo Arana had spontaneously been offered a guest appearance on the Russian series A ritmo de tango starring Oreiro. Both actors agreed to appear in You Are the One on the condition that they worked together. As a result, the program design was decided only after both were confirmed in the leading roles. Oreiro delayed filming proposals in Israel, Spain, and Uruguay, and the recording of her fourth music album to join the project. As in Muñeca Brava, the narrative of You Are the One revolves around a wealthy suitor and a poor woman, but unlike the former program it does not concentrate all the characters on a single narrative context. You Are the One organizes two contexts for both <b>the</b> <b>rich</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> poor, each one with its own characteristic locations and supporting characters.|$|E
5|$|Until 1927, {{the exact}} shades of the {{national}} colors were not legally specified. In practice, the actual hue, particularly of red, depended {{on what kind of}} red dye was available. In pre-partition Poland, crimson, due to its high price, was a color associated with <b>the</b> <b>rich</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> privileged. It could be obtained from the domestically harvested Polish cochineal, although imported alternatives were also available: kermes from the Mediterranean Basin (hence karmazyn, the Polish name of the color) and Mexican cochineal after the discovery of the New World. Crimson was reserved for the nobility and considered a symbol of the aristocracy, so that karmazyn became synonymous with a magnate. A royal ban on wearing this color could be a form of punishment; in the 14th century, the Nałęcz clan of Greater Poland were forbidden to dress in crimson for their ancestors' complicity in the assassination of King Premislaus in 1296. In {{the first half of the}} 19th century, due to the influence of French fashion, crimson was largely replaced with the cheaper amaranth.|$|E

5|$|When {{the pilgrims}} reach the {{appropriate}} Miqat (depending on where they're coming from), they {{enter into a}} state of holiness – known as Ihram – that consists of wearing two white seamless cloths for the male, with the one wrapped around the waist reaching below the knee and the other draped over the left shoulder and tied at the right side; wearing ordinary dress for the female that fulfills the Islamic condition of public dress with hands or face uncovered; taking ablution; declaring the intention (niyah) to perform pilgrimage and to refraining from certain activities such as clipping the nails, shaving any part of the body, having sexual relations; using perfumes, damaging plants, killing animals, covering head (for men) or the face and hands (for women); getting married; or carrying weapons. The ihram is meant to show equality of all pilgrims in front of God: there is no difference between <b>the</b> <b>rich</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> poor.|$|E

25|$|Violent {{crime is}} limited, but increasing, and public {{perception}} associates this with returns of ethnic Tongans {{who have been}} raised overseas.

At this moment crime increases faster than the police force and will remain a serious problem for the years to come. Increasing wealth has also increased the gap between <b>the</b> <b>rich</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> poor, leading {{to more and more}} burglaries.|$|E

25|$|Although {{there is}} little ethnic strife in Paraguay to impede social and {{economic}} progress, there is social conflict caused by underemployment and the enormous economic inequality between <b>the</b> <b>rich</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> poor, who are mostly rural inhabitants.

Acts also portrays both positive and negative uses of wealth: those who practiced almsgiving and generosity to the poor (9.36; 10.2, 4) and those who gave priority to money over the needs of others (5.1–11; 8.14–24).|$|E
