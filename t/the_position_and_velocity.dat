50|$|In {{addition}} to propagating through a vacuum, light may also propagate through {{many types of}} matter, denoted as the medium or phase. Light traveling within a medium {{is no longer a}} disturbance solely of the electromagnetic field, but rather a disturbance of <b>the</b> field <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>positions</b> <b>and</b> <b>velocities</b> of <b>the</b> charged particles (electrons) within the material. The motion of the electrons is determined by the field (due to the Lorentz force) but the field is determined by <b>the</b> <b>positions</b> <b>and</b> <b>velocities</b> of <b>the</b> electrons (due to Gauss' law and Ampère's law). The behavior of a disturbance of this combined electromagnetic-charge density field (i.e. light) is still determined by Maxwell's equations, but the solutions are complicated because of the intimate link between the medium and the field.|$|R
50|$|The {{independent}} {{nature of}} the field became more apparent with James Clerk Maxwell's discovery that waves in these fields propagated at a finite speed.

2500|$|By 1913 {{he had in}} {{his spare}} time, using calculus, {{developed}} the mathematics which allowed him to calculate <b>the</b> <b>position</b> <b>and</b> <b>velocity</b> of a rocket in vertical flight, given the weight of the rocket and weight of the propellant and the velocity (with respect to the rocket frame) of the exhaust gases. His first goal was to build a sounding rocket with which to study the atmosphere. Not only would such investigation aid meteorology, but it was necessary to determine temperature, density and wind speed in order to design efficient space launch vehicles. He was very reluctant to admit that his ultimate goal was in fact to develop a vehicle for flights into space, since most scientists, especially in the United States, did not consider such a goal to be a realistic or practical scientific pursuit, nor was the public yet ready to seriously consider such ideas. Later, in 1933, Goddard said that [...] "n no case must we allow ourselves to be deterred from the achievement of space travel, test by test and step by step, until one day we succeed, cost what it may." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{interpretation}} of entropy in statistical mechanics {{is the measure}} of uncertainty, or mixedupness in the phrase of Gibbs, which remains about a system after its observable macroscopic properties, such as temperature, pressure and volume, have been taken into account. For a given set of macroscopic variables, the entropy measures {{the degree to which}} the probability of the system is spread out over different possible microstates. In contrast to [...] the macrostate, which characterizes plainly observable average quantities, a microstate specifies all molecular details about the system including <b>the</b> <b>position</b> <b>and</b> <b>velocity</b> of every molecule. The more such states available to the system with appreciable probability, the greater the entropy. In statistical mechanics, entropy is a measure of the number of ways in which a system may be arranged, often taken to be a measure of [...] "disorder" [...] (the higher the entropy, the higher the disorder). This definition describes the entropy as being proportional to the natural logarithm of the number of possible microscopic configurations of the individual atoms and molecules of the system (microstates) which could give rise to the observed macroscopic state (macrostate) of the system. The constant of proportionality is the Boltzmann constant.|$|E

40|$|An algorithm, called RATTLE, for {{integrating}} the {{equations of motion}} in molecular dynamics calculations for molecular models with internal constraints is presented. The algorithm is similar to SHAKE, {{which is one of}} the standard methods for performing such calculations. RATTLE calculates <b>the</b> <b>positions</b> <b>and</b> <b>velocities</b> at <b>the</b> next time from <b>the</b> <b>positions</b> <b>and</b> <b>velocities</b> at <b>the</b> present time step, without requiring information about the earlier history.

RATTLE guarantees that the coordinates <b>and</b> <b>velocities</b> of the atoms in a molecule satisfy the internal constraints at each time step. RATTLE has two advantages over SHAKE. On computers of fixed precision. it is of higher precision than SHAKE. Since it deals directly with the velocities, it is easier to modify RATTLE for use with the recently developed constant temperature and constant pressure molecular dynamics methods and with the nonequilibrium molecular dynamics methods that make use of resealing of the atomic velocities.
