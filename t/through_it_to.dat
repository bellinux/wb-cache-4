5|$|Rhodes became Prime Minister of the Cape Colony in July 1890. A {{month later}} the British and Transvaalers agreed to joint control over Swaziland (without {{consulting}} the Swazis)—the South African Republic {{could build a}} railway <b>through</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> Kosi Bay {{on the condition that}} the Transvaal thereafter supported the interests of Rhodes's Chartered Company in Matabeleland and its environs. Kruger honoured the latter commitment in 1891 when he outlawed the Adendorff Trek, another would-be emigration to Mashonaland, over the protests of Joubert and many others. This, along with his handling of the economy and the civil service—now widely perceived as overloaded with Dutch imports—caused opposition to grow. The industrial monopolies Kruger's administration granted became widely derided as corrupt and inefficient, especially the dynamite concession given to Edouard Lippert and a French consortium, which Kruger was forced to revoke in 1892 amid much scandal over misrepresentation and price gouging.|$|E
5|$|Several {{proposals}} {{have been made}} to bypass the Antelope Valley Freeway by boring a tunnel under the San Gabriel Mountains and extending the Glendale Freeway <b>through</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the Antelope Valley. In 2003, Caltrans published a map showing potential improvements to the transportation infrastructure of southern California. The proposal showed both the unconstructed portion of Route 14 and new routes over or under the mountains to Antelope Valley. In 2005, the idea was advanced as a combination toll tunnel and surface highway. Preliminary studies estimated costs around $3 billion and suggested charging a varying toll, adjusted for the time of day, averaging around $8 for one-way passage.|$|E

25|$|The Berlin Wall {{was erected}} with great {{efficiency}} by the East German government in 1961, {{but there were}} many means of escape {{that had not been}} anticipated. For example, Checkpoint Charlie was initially blocked only by a gate, and a citizen of the DDR (East Germany) smashed a car <b>through</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> escape, so a strong pole was erected. Another escapee approached the barrier in a convertible, the windscreen removed prior to the event, and slipped under the barrier. This was repeated two weeks later, so the East Germans duly lowered the barrier and added uprights.|$|E
25|$|An {{implosion}} {{shock wave}} {{might be of}} such short duration that {{only part of the}} pit is compressed at any instant as the wave passes <b>through</b> <b>it.</b> <b>To</b> prevent this, a pusher shell may be needed. The pusher is located between the explosive lens and the tamper. It works by reflecting some of the shock wave backwards, thereby having the effect of lengthening its duration. It is made out of a low density metal—such as aluminium, beryllium, or an alloy of the two metals (aluminium is easier and safer to shape, and is two orders of magnitude cheaper; beryllium has high-neutron-reflective capability). Fat Man used an aluminium pusher.|$|E

25|$|Late in his life, {{the writer}} coined another term, daco-românism ("Daco-Romanianism"), which {{referenced}} the ancient territory of Dacia and, <b>through</b> <b>it,</b> <b>to</b> {{the ideal of}} grouping together all territories inhabited by Romanians outside the Old Kingdom's borders. This allusion to Transylvania contributed to his polemic with Austro-Hungarian authorities, who came to regard the term with suspicion. At the same time, Urechia sought to build contacts with representatives of other Romance-speaking communities in the Balkans, Aromanians as well as Megleno-Romanians and Istro-Romanians, {{as well as with}} Romanian leaders from Bukovina and Bessarabia. After the Russo-Turkish War, when Romanian rule was extended to formerly Ottoman Northern Dobruja, he called for the region's Romanianization through colonization and changes in toponymy.|$|E
25|$|In {{accordance}} with convention, the Governor-General, {{to maintain the}} stability of government, must appoint as prime minister the individual most likely to maintain {{the support of the}} House of Representatives: usually the leader of the political party with a majority in that house, but also when no party or coalition holds a majority (referred to as a minority government situation), or other scenarios in which the Governor-General's judgement about the most suitable candidate for prime minister has to be brought into play. The Governor-General also appoints to Cabinet the other ministers of the Crown, who are, in turn, accountable to the Parliament, and <b>through</b> <b>it,</b> <b>to</b> the people. The Queen is informed by her viceroy of the acceptance of the resignation of a prime minister and the swearing-in of a new prime minister {{and other members of the}} ministry, and she holds audience with her Australian ministers where possible.|$|E
25|$|The 1853 lease {{gave the}} company {{the right to}} extract water from Red Tarn and Keppelcove Tarn. In the late 1860s both tarns were {{modified}} by building dams. A dam was built in 1868 to increase the capacity of Red Tarn and to regulate the beck supplying water to the Low Mill. In Keppel Cove a natural tarn had formed behind a glacial moraine across {{the floor of the}} valley. To draw on this water in times of low rainfall, a tunnel was made through the moraine and an 18-inch cast iron pipe laid <b>through</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> extract water {{from the bottom of the}} tarn. The top of the moraine was flattened and widened, and the work completed in 1871. Catchment of the tarn was increased by diverting two streams into it, include the one out of Brown Cove and at some point a dam was built to create a reservoir in Brown Cove. Its remains can still be seen, though the wall was cut down in 1936 when it was no longer needed.|$|E

25|$|Pacheco {{repeatedly}} {{went into}} the lab at night to take photographs and to escort scientists, including veterinarians and a primatologist, <b>through</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> secure their testimony. Newkirk lay crouched {{on the back seat}} of a car outside, hidden under a large cardboard box with holes for her eyes, using a walkie-talkie from a toy store to alert Pacheco if anyone else entered the building. The monkeys' living conditions documented by Pacheco were graphically disturbing. Having collected the evidence, Newkirk and Pacheco alerted the police, who raided the lab, removed the monkeys, and charged Taub with 113 counts of cruelty to animals and six counts of failing to provide adequate veterinary care. Taub maintained that he had been set up by Newkirk and Pacheco while he was on vacation and that several of the photographs had been staged. The judge found Taub guilty of six counts of cruelty to animals for failing to provide adequate veterinary care and fined him $3,000. A later jury trial saw five of these counts dismissed, and the sixth was overturned on appeal because of a technicality. The National Institutes of Health, which had funded Taub's research, was among the scientists and other professionals who criticized the conditions in which Taub had kept the monkeys, though the NIH later reversed its decision when the charges against Taub were overturned.|$|E
