5|$|The {{impact of}} scenes is {{heightened}} by alternating between objective and subjective perspectives, the warm {{face of the}} Earth and the depths of dark space, <b>the</b> <b>chaos</b> <b>and</b> unpredictability of the debris field, and silence in the vacuum of space with the background score giving the desired effect. The film uses very long, uninterrupted shots throughout to draw the audience into the action, but contrasts these with claustrophobic shots within space suits and capsules.|$|E
5|$|At {{the science}} fair, Steve causes a panic by announcing his pet {{tarantula}} has escaped, and Carly Beth is terrified of tarantulas. Steve creeps {{up behind her}} during <b>the</b> <b>chaos,</b> <b>and</b> pinches her leg {{to make it seem}} that the tarantula is biting her. Carly Beth flies into a frenzied panic, destroys her and Sabrina's project and is again humiliated in front of her teachers and classmates. Carly Beth vows that she will definitely make Steve pay for what he did to her. She plots to go to a new store that has opened, which sells frightening costumes, and plans to scare Steve and Chuck as payback.|$|E
5|$|Sujoy Ghosh {{approached}} {{novelist and}} script writer Advaita Kala {{with the idea}} for the film. Kala took inspiration from her experience in Kolkata, where she had moved in 1999, akin to the protagonist in the film. She reported that despite facing a language barrier and <b>the</b> <b>chaos</b> <b>and</b> poverty of the metropolis, she was charmed by the warmth of the people, which was reflected in the film. Kala started writing in 2009 and finished the 185-page script by February 2010. Her research included reading the books Open Secrets: India's Intelligence Unveiled by Maloy Krishna Dhar and India's External Intelligence: Secrets of Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) by V. K. Singh.|$|E

5000|$|They confront Blumiere but {{are unable}} to attack due {{to the power of}} <b>the</b> <b>Chaos</b> Heart {{granting}} him invincibility. Peach, Bowser, and Luigi reappear and use the Pure Hearts to destroy Blumiere's defenses and defeat him, but they fail to halt The Void's destruction. Dimentio appears and takes control of <b>the</b> <b>Chaos</b> Heart, revealing that he has studied the Dark Prognosticus extensively and that he wishes to use <b>the</b> <b>Chaos</b> Heart <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Void to create a new universe in his own image. Dimentio takes control of Luigi again, as the Dark Prognosticus revealed him as the ideal host for <b>the</b> <b>Chaos</b> Heart, <b>and</b> fuses <b>the</b> <b>Chaos</b> Heart, Luigi, <b>and</b> himself into one entity called Super Dimentio, who has complete control over The Void. He shatters the Pure Hearts and begins making his new universe. However, Blumiere and Timpani's renewed love for one another, as well as the feelings of loyalty by Blumiere's remaining minions, restore the Pure Hearts. Mario uses their power to defeat Super Dimentio, who splits back into Luigi, <b>the</b> <b>Chaos</b> Heart, <b>and</b> Dimentio, who dies, but leaves behind a fragment of his power to control <b>the</b> <b>Chaos</b> Heart <b>and</b> complete <b>the</b> destruction of all worlds. As such, Blumiere leads everyone to the chapel where Bowser and Peach were originally married. There, he and Timpani use the power of their renewed love to summon the Pure Hearts one final time <b>and</b> destroy <b>the</b> <b>Chaos</b> Heart, sealing <b>The</b> Void.|$|R
5|$|When the Shawnee Purchase Units {{were first}} established, {{temporary}} headquarters {{were set up}} in Room 303, First Trust and Savings Bank Building, Harrisburg, Illinois. This was the only modern office building {{in the town of}} Harrisburg suitable for headquarters, and the forest has continued to occupy this building as Supervisor's offices. Expansion of the offices has continued since 1933, until today (June 1938), ten rooms on the third floor, and four rooms on the fourth floor, are leased by the Forest Service. Employees who were here during {{the early days of the}} forest tell of <b>the</b> <b>chaos</b> <b>and</b> confusion caused by the small space under lease, the incoming shipments of equipment and supplies, and the constant inflow of new personnel.|$|E
5|$|The French Democracy {{begins with}} a re-enactment of the real-life 27 October 2005 event that {{triggered}} riots in France: the electrocution of two teenagers, Zyed Benna and Bouna Traoré. In the film, the youths attempt to hide from police in a building near an electric power station. In a televised speech, the Minister of the Interior vows to increase efforts to fight crime. Three fictional Moroccan men discuss the recent events and disagree with means used by the police, and feel that blacks are unfairly targeted. They face different forms of discrimination: overnight detention {{for lack of a}} passport during an identity check, refusal of employment and housing rental, and police brutality. Angered, the three riot using Molotov cocktails. A white family watches television coverage of <b>the</b> <b>chaos,</b> <b>and</b> the film ends with a dedication to Benna and Traoré, lamenting the loss of the French ideals of freedom, equality, and fraternity.|$|E
5|$|The player {{character}} is a prisoner being led to an Imperial execution in Helgen. Alduin unexpectedly interrupts the procession, destroying the town before the player can be executed. The player escapes in <b>the</b> <b>chaos</b> <b>and</b> journeys {{to the city of}} Whiterun to request aid against the dragon threat. After slaying a different dragon that attacks nearby, the player absorbs the dragon's soul which grants them the ability to perform a shout. The city's guards inform the player that they must be Dragonborn. The player is summoned to meet with the Greybeards, an order of monks who live in seclusion. The Greybeards train the player in using shouts and inform the player of their role in stopping Alduin. The player learns that Skyrim's civil war is the last in a sequence of prophetic events foretold by the Elder Scrolls, which also predicted the return of Alduin.|$|E

5|$|Tyrion {{discovers that}} the Sons of the Harpy are {{funded by the}} slavers of Yunkai, Astapor, and Volantis, and {{arranges}} a meeting with representatives of those cities to give them seven years to abolish slavery. Despite Tyrion's insistence that compromise is necessary, this solution is met with disapproval by Daenerys' other advisors and the freedmen of Meereen. Tyrion also enlists {{the assistance of the}} red priestess Kinvara, who believes that Daenerys is a messianic figure prophesied by her faith and offers the support of the followers of R'hllor. Meereen begins to prosper, but the city's success attracts the ire of the slavers, who fear it will undermine the legitimacy of slavery, and so launch a massive naval attack against the city. Daenerys returns in <b>the</b> <b>chaos,</b> <b>and</b> though she is displeased with Tyrion's failure, she is persuaded by him to obliterate the slavers' fleet and force their ultimate surrender rather than destroy them outright. Soon after, Theon and Yara Greyjoy arrive in Meereen offering Daenerys the Iron Fleet; they are joined by the fleets of Dorne and the Reach, who have defected from the Lannisters. Daenerys names an honored Tyrion as her Hand of the Queen. Tyrion then joins her, the dragons, and her army as they sail to Westeros.|$|E

25|$|The Viceroy {{attempted}} {{to form a}} defense by the Riachuelo, the city's southern border, ordering the burning of the Gálvez bridge (located {{on the site of}} today's Pueyrredón Bridge). He moved his troops to the west, believing the British would cross upriver, where he could attack them. The British captured the river-crossing boats, crossing to the north side. The defense failed there on their first attempt, and the viceroy gave incoherent orders which added to <b>the</b> <b>chaos</b> <b>and</b> confusion.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—The paper {{discusses}} the main ideas of <b>the</b> <b>chaos</b> theory <b>and</b> presents mainly {{the importance of}} the nonlinearities in <b>the</b> mathematical models. <b>Chaos</b> <b>and</b> order are apparently two opposite terms. The fact that in chaos can be found a certain precise symmetry (Feigenbaum numbers) is even more surprising. As an illustration of <b>the</b> ubiquity of <b>chaos,</b> three models among many other existing models that have chaotic features are presented here: the nonlinear feedback profit model, one model for the simulation of the exchange rate and one application of <b>the</b> <b>chaos</b> theory in <b>the</b> capital markets...|$|R

The lack of this institution ("At that time, there was no king in Israel") is repeated a number of times, such as Judges 17:6; 18:1; 19:1; and 21:25.|$|E
25|$|The SWOC {{signed up}} {{thousands}} of members and absorbed {{a number of}} company unions at U.S. Steel and elsewhere, but did not attempt the sort of daring strike that the UAW had pulled off against GM.

Students and teachers privacy was also protected during image recording for TV. In 2004 and 2005, the Portuguese Ministry of Education reported over 1,200 aggressions inside Portuguese schools.|$|E

25|$|The {{war ended}} with the total defeat of Paraguay. After it lost in {{conventional}} warfare, Paraguay conducted a drawn-out guerrilla resistance, a disastrous strategy {{that resulted in the}} further destruction of the Paraguayan military and much of the civilian population through battle casualties, hunger and diseases. The guerrilla war lasted 14 months until President Francisco Solano López was killed in action by Brazilian forces in the Battle of Cerro Corá on March 1, 1870. Argentine and Brazilian troops occupied Paraguay until 1876. Estimates of total Paraguayan losses range from 21,000 to 200,000 people.

The International Dutch Gendarmerie was also joined by Isa Boletini and his men, mostly from Kosovo. Dutch gendarmes together with northern Mirdita Catholics attempted to capture Shijak, but when they engaged the rebels on May 23, they were surrounded and captured, as well as another expedition from Durres which attempted to release the captured gendarmes. Rebels launched the attack on Durres and even started firing on it with their light weapons. The people in Durres panicked and the Prince and his family found shelter on an Italian ship anchored in the bay.|$|E
