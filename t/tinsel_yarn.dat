5000|$|Terry's {{spectacular}} gown {{was designed}} by Alice Comyns-Carr [...] and made in crochet by Ada Nettleship, using a soft green wool and blue <b>tinsel</b> <b>yarn</b> from Bohemia to create an effect similar to chain mail. It was embroidered with gold and decorated with 1,000 iridescent wings from the green jewel beetle, Sternocera aequisignata. The dress has a narrow border of Celtic designs worked out in red and white stones, is hemmed on all the edges, and girt with a gold belt. The design {{was inspired by a}} dress worn by Lady Randolph Churchill that was also trimmed with green beetle wings. It was designed to [...] "look as much like soft chain armour... and yet have something that would give the appearance of the scales of a serpent".|$|E
