500|$|Chamberlain was in {{his third}} season in the NBA, having set season scoring records {{in each of his}} first two seasons with 37.6 and then 38.4 points per game. [...] Frank McGuire, the Warriors' new coach, started the season vowing to get the ball to Chamberlain [...] "two-thirds of the time." [...] Sports Illustrated wrote that McGuire's [...] "eventual effect may be to measurably change the {{character}} of professional basketball from the brawling, hustling, cigar-in-the-face and eye-on-the-till game it has been for decades to the major league sport which it longs and deserves to be." [...] He was determined to play Chamberlain every minute of every game; the [...] and [...] center had missed only eight minutes and 33 seconds that season due to disqualification in a game from technical fouls. In three earlier games that week, Chamberlain had scored 67, 65, and 61 points respectively, giving him an already-record 15 times scoring 60 or more points in his career. He was closing in on 4,000 points for the season, needing 237 more; no other player had ever scored 3,000 points at that point. On December 8, 1961, in a triple overtime game versus the Los Angeles Lakers, he set a new NBA record by scoring 78 points, breaking the record of 71 previously set by Elgin Baylor. Legendary Laker broadcaster Chick Hearn often told the story that after the game, he asked Baylor if it bothered him that Chamberlain had an extra 15 minutes to break the record. According to Hearn, Baylor said he wasn't concerned because [...] "someday <b>that</b> <b>guy</b> <b>is</b> going to score 100". Rival center Bill Russell predicted, [...] " [...] has the size, strength, and stamina to score one hundred some night." [...] In a high school game in 1955, Chamberlain had scored 90points in a 123–21 victory. The Philadelphia Inquirer wrote, [...] "Chamberlain might have hit 100 if he had played the entire 32 minutes." ...|$|E

When questioned about Sapp's refusal to fight {{on the day of the}} event, FEG President Sadaharu Tanikawa asked, [...] "Does anyone actually care? I don't know the reasons why, but we did our best to make him fight. He just said he didn't want to. This is typical [...]" [...] But Sapp claims that the promoters were contracted to pay him $30,000 for the fight, but that Tanikawa offered him $15,000 shortly after he arrived in Japan for the event. Sapp refused to fight for half of the original purse. [...] In response, he [...] "should not be considered as a normal person" [...] and is [...] "the worst, most lamentable dust man."

2500|$|June 12, 2009: Both teams played {{each other}} {{for the first time at}} the new Yankee Stadium. The game had several lead changes, {{including}} Mariano Rivera giving up the go ahead run to the Mets in the 8th. In the bottom of the 9th, after Derek Jeter stole 2nd base and Mark Teixeira was intentionally walked, the Mets new closer Francisco Rodríguez (K-Rod) paired off against Alex Rodriguez (A-Rod). In what seemed a routine pop with two outs, Mets 2nd baseman and three time gold glove award winner Luis Castillo dropped the ball. Teixeira wound up scoring the winning run all the way from first on the error to give the Yankees the 9-8 victory. It would prove to be the Yankees' 7th walk off game that season and the first statistical blown save for K-Rod as a Met. After the game, injured Yankees pitcher Brian Bruney criticized K-Rod and his animated behavior on the mound to reporters. [...] " [...] couldn't have happened to a better guy on the mound, either", said Bruney. [...] "He's got a tired act. ... He gets what he deserves, man. I just don't like watching the guy pitch. I think it's embarrassing." [...] Rodriguez responded, [...] "Instead of sending a message in the paper, next time when he sees me at Citi Field, come up to me and say it. Don't be sending a message to the media. I don't even know who <b>that</b> <b>guy</b> <b>is,</b> somewhere in Double-A and not even pitching one full season." ...|$|E
