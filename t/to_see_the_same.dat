In this novel Duteurtre relates some personal experiences from his activities {{as a journalist}} and music critic. He sent this novel to Guy Debord, who returned a friendly letter with these words ”Il vous a suffi de voir le même siècle et sa sorte d'art, vous l'avez ressenti justement” (you only needed <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> century and its kind of art, you felt it precisely).|$|E
25|$|In December 1924, {{several days}} after the last ship left the port, Welch treated a few {{children}} for what he first diagnosed as sore throats or tonsillitis, initially dismissing diphtheria since it is extremely contagious {{and he would have}} expected <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> symptoms in their family members or other cases around town. In the next few weeks, as the number of tonsillitis cases grew and four children died whom he {{had not been able to}} autopsy, Welch became increasingly concerned about diphtheria.|$|E
25|$|Recent {{research}} on spatial memory and wayfinding {{in an article}} by Ishikawa et al. in 2008 revealed that using a GPS moving map device reduces an individual's navigation abilities {{when compared to other}} participants who were using maps or had previous experience on the route with a guide. GPS moving map devices are frequently set up to allow the user to only see a small detailed close-up of a particular segment of the map which is constantly updated. In comparison, maps usually allow the user <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> view of the entire route from departure to arrival. Other research has shown that individuals who use GPS travel more slowly overall compared to map users who are faster. GPS users stop more frequently and {{for a longer period of}} time whereas map users and individuals using past experience as a guide travel on more direct routes to reach their goal.|$|E

500|$|Although most stories {{submitted}} to Super Science Stories were rejects from the better-paying markets such as Astounding Science Fiction, Pohl recalled {{in his memoirs}} that John W. Campbell, the editor of Astounding, would occasionally pass on a good story by a prolific author because he felt readers did not want <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> authors in every issue. [...] As a result, Pohl was able to print L. Sprague de Camp's Genus Homo, in the March 1941 Super Science Stories, and Robert Heinlein's [...] "Let There Be Light" [...] and [...] "Lost Legacy" [...] in the May 1940 and November 1941 issues: these were stories which, in Pohl's opinion, [...] "would have looked good anywhere". [...] Pohl also suggested that Campbell rejected some of Heinlein's stories because they contained mild references to sex. [...] A couple of readers did complain, with one disgusted letter writer commenting [...] "If {{you are going to}} continue to print such pseudosophisticated, pre-prep-school tripe as [...] "Let There Be Light", you should change the name of the mag to Naughty Future Funnies".|$|E
500|$|The {{development}} team recognised {{the differences}} between creating a game for the PlayStation Vita and the PlayStation 3. Lovegrove said that designing the game for the Vita's smaller screen {{made it easier to}} develop, alleviating [...] "old problems" [...] with designing a game targeted for an HD screen, but the studio had to ensure that the game could run at any resolution. Roberts agreed, saying that [...] "it [...] less of a headache for artists" [...] who wanted to tweak lighting effects. Asked about major differences between the PlayStation 3's RSX Reality Synthesizer graphics processing unit (GPU) and the PlayStation Vita's ARM architecture, Roberts said that the [...] "most obvious" [...] difference was the Vita's lack of stream processing units (SPU). He said that most of Wipeout HD SPU code was directed towards GPU support, which included features such as geometry culling, lighting effects and rendering. According to Roberts, the Vita's GPU and ARM architecture were more capable and handled Wipeout 2048 [...] "very well". Lovegrove, who had worked with ARM architecture on the BBC Micro, said that the team did not have to optimise anything to accomplish their goals and it was enjoyable <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> architecture running the game.|$|E
500|$|Pierre {{characterized}} Hoppus as both [...] "very {{involved and}} not involved," [...] with {{his job as}} producer mainly giving notes on {{the sound of the}} instruments and offering suggestions to improve songs. Hoppus mostly worked with the band on arrangements, believing the songs were too packed and [...] "needed to breathe". Hoppus mentioned that label politics had hindered the creativity of Blink's Take Off Your Pants and Jacket (2001), and did not want <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> fate befall the band. He was [...] "meticulous" [...] in his approach, partially {{due to the fact that}} it was his first production job. Hoppus was the one who advised the band to merge two previously unrelated songs—a slower, softer song and a pulsating drum track—into one, which became [...] "Time Turned Fragile". The frontman of Fall Out Boy, Patrick Stump, contributed guest vocals to [...] "Everything Is Alright", and Hoppus to [...] "Hangman". With production completed, Hoppus was very excited for the band that he felt was on the cusp of [...] "great things", recalling, [...] "After six weeks of these guys living all together in two rooms of this house with a studio attached they created this amazingly beautiful and honest album. Justin's lyrics are so brutally truthful." [...] The group completed recording in November 2004, and judged final mixes over the interim months. Pierre later called Commit This to Memory his personal favorite album by the band.|$|E

500|$|Tammareddy Bharadwaja said [...] "Ever since Arundhati and Magadheera {{did well}} at the box office, {{the rest of the}} {{industry}} started following their footsteps. Also, since there is an irrational craze to make high budget films right now, producers are turning towards mythological films. It is the only genre where you can boast of spending crores for creating the sets and the look of the film. But what they don't realize is that if these films flop, the blow to the producer will be severe." [...] Films like Anaganaga O Dheerudu (2011) and Shakti (2011) were commercial failures and Badrinath (2012) was an average grosser; all being fantasy films in which the protagonist is a warrior. The promos of Badrinath looked similar to Magadheera and the former's director V. V. Vinayak along with its male lead Allu Arjun kept insisting that Badrinath is dissimilar to Magadheera. Producer Natti Kumar said [...] "If a hero delivers a hit, producers run after him for five years and burn their fingers only after six or eight flops. It's the same story with movies. Since Magadheera became a hit, every other hero and director wants to do period film where there is scope to spend crores. They don't work on the script, story or relevance. It is a pure display of graphics, heroes' abs and grandeur. The plot is lost. Magadheera worked because it was a novel genre then, but why will people want <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> things again?".|$|E
500|$|Janssen {{said the}} film is [...] "definitely played {{with a bit of}} a wink and doesn't take itself too seriously." [...] Wirkola himself {{described}} it as [...] "a little more grounded" [...] and action-centered than Dead Snow. He recalled that he has tried to downplay comedy elements: [...] "If you go too far, it can turn into a spoof almost...We shot a lot more than what is in the movie of course and it’s just balancing it when you’re cutting." [...] Speaking of graphic violence, he said that [...] "the first version we tested was for sure the most extreme. Some stuff stayed in, some stuff got cut out." [...] By August 2012, Paramount was reportedly test screening two versions of the film, rated R and PG-13, and the R-rated cut received the positive feedback. Wirkola said, [...] "I was afraid. I actually made sure they could never cut it to PG-13...We always {{knew it was going to}} be R." [...] McKay said that Paramount's Adam Goodman [...] "was perceptive enough <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> thing and got behind it as well." [...] Wirkola said, [...] "The pre-production and shooting went very smooth, but the post-production was very new to me and how they do things here with testing and the studio." [...] He said about the test screenings in particular: [...] "I can see why they do it – there’s a lot of money involved and they want it to hit as broad as possible. But I think it’s a flawed process, I really do." [...] McKay said that Paramount executives might nevertheless regret the film's R rating.|$|E
2500|$|The {{departure}} of Nebraska from the Big 12 marked this game as the probable last game {{of one of}} the longest continuous series in the history of NCAA college football, as Kansas and Nebraska have met on the field every year without interruption since 1903, and failed to meet in only two seasons overall since 1892.

2500|$|During the American Revolution, most Congregational ministers {{sided with}} the Patriots and American independence. This was largely because ministers chose to stand with their congregations who felt the British {{government}} was becoming tyrannical. Ministers were also motivated by fear that the British would appoint Anglican bishops for the American colonies. This had been proposed as a practical measure; American bishops could ordain Anglican priests in the colonies without requiring candidates for ordination to travel to England. Congregationalists, however, remembered how their Puritan ancestors were oppressed by bishops in England and had no desire <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> system in America.|$|E
2500|$|On {{specific}} crossovers with Daredevil, {{which had}} completed its first season {{by the time}} Jessica Jones began casting, Loeb said [...] "they’re in the same area.

When you go to the hospital, you start <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> people. [...] we don’t want people suddenly going, [...] "Wait, is that Matt Murdock that’s walking down the street?" [...] Because that’s going to feel odd, and in a weird way feel false." [...] On existing in the MCU, specifically in the same world as the other Netflix series, Rosenberg said, [...] "Jessica Jones is a very, very different show than Daredevil. We exist in a cinematic universe, [...] the mythology of the universe is connected, but they look very different, tonally they’re very different… That was my one concern coming in: Am I going to have to fit into Daredevil or what’s come before? And the answer is no." ...|$|E
2500|$|More recently, sound {{engineers}} {{have seen the}} introduction of dual [...] "fft" [...] (fast-fourier transform) based audio analysis software which allows an engineer to view not only frequency vs. amplitude (pitch vs. volume) information that an RTA provides, but also <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> signals (sounds) in the time domain. This provides the engineer with much more meaningful data than an rta alone. Also, dual fft analysis allows one to compare the source signal with the output signal and view the difference. This is a very fast way to calibrate a system to sound {{as close as possible}} to the original source material. As with any such measurement tool, it must always be verified using actual human ears. Some DSP system processing devices have been designed for use by non-professionals that automatically make adjustments in the system EQ based upon what is being read from the RTA mic. [...] These are practically never used by professionals, as they almost never calibrate the system as well as a professional audio engineer can manually.|$|E

2500|$|Scully {{has endured}} {{a pair of}} {{personal}} tragedies in his life. In 1972, his 35-year-old wife, Joan Crawford, died of an accidental medical overdose; the couple {{had been married for}} 15 years. In late 1973, he married Sandra Hunt, who had two children of her own, and they soon had a child together. Scully's eldest son, Michael, died in a helicopter crash at the age of 33 while working for the ARCO Transportation Company. He was inspecting oil pipelines for leaks near Fort Tejon, California {{in the immediate aftermath of}} the Northridge earthquake in January 1994. Although Michael's death still haunts him, Scully, a devout Roman Catholic, has said in numerous interviews that he credits his Catholic faith and being able to dive back into his work with helping him ease the burden and grief from losing his wife and son. He has encouraged devotion to the Virgin Mary, saying, [...] "her prayers are more powerful than those of the rest of heaven combined. No one was closer or more devoted to Christ on earth, so it only makes sense <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> thing in heaven. Now, the Blessed Virgin seeks to help her spiritual children get home to spend eternity with her Son." ...|$|E
