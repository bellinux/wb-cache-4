40|$|Abstract: Ultrasonic Testing (UT) {{is still}} {{concentrated}} on the ‘classical ’ wave modes generated by piezoelectric probes. Other wave modes as the Shear Horizontal (SH) waves and the wide class of guided waves offer new solutions for UT not yet widely used {{due to the lack}} of availability of appropriate probes and equipments. EMAT’s are the most far developed ultrasonic probes for UT using SH-waves and guided waves. Despite their limitations (efficiency, lift off-effect, frequency range etc.) they have the big advantage to perform dry UT. This contribution will present new solutions for UT of metallic parts using guided Shear Horizontal waves: for the in-line inspection for defects and weld geometry of butt welds, for crack inspection in gas pipelines, for screening UT for hidden corrosion in <b>tubular</b> <b>goods,</b> for long range inspection of pipes and for the inspection of multilayered aircraft components. The latest developments of the probe design are shortly reported. The equipments and their integration in production lines as well for in-service application are shown together with examples of inspection results during their practical applications. Introduction: In thin walled plates and <b>tubular</b> <b>goods</b> ultrasonic waves can propagate as guided plate waves in a flat strip or in the wall of a pipe with a radius of curvature large compared with the ultrasonic wavelength (in circumferential as in axial direction).

40|$|IN recent years, {{studies of}} heart failure have {{stressed}} the fact that, when cardiac output is inadequate for tissue needs, the body compensates by in-creasing the blood volume and the tissue fluid volume.

40|$|Abstract. Weight {{reduction}} and the structural strengthening of frameworks {{have always been}} of great interest for automobile and bicycle manufacturers. In order to achieve this goal, manufacturers have always been looking for new materials and their corresponding processing technology. This paper focuses on investigating the most suitable forming-control path pattern for manufacturing magnesium-based alloy quadrilateral tubular components using the tube-hydroforming (THF) process for framework components. Conventionally, there are three usual patterns of forming-control path. Through numerical simulation, {{it was found that}} forming-control path C provided the best profile results. The simulation results were also verified by physical THF experiments which were carried out at around 270 ºC to fabricate the quadrilateral <b>tubular</b> component.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{versatility}} of {{the textile}} weaving process {{has made it}} a popular method for producing structural composite preforms. Enhanced through-thickness strength by multi-layer weaving, good in-plane strength {{and the ability to}} produce 2. 5 D or 3 D shapes, are some of the advantages which have made weaving the most commonly used textile process for composite applications. It is also possible to incorporate local modifications to the weave patterns and fibre-densities within the woven structure; although this characteristic of weaving has not been completely exploited by the composites industry. It is easy to produce a <b>tubular</b> structure having <b>good</b> bi-directional mechanical properties. Moreover, the preform also can be molded into bent shapes, making the woven composites more versatile than ever before. Drape behavior of such tubular fabrics is complex and has not previously been investigated. The aim {{of this paper is to}} discuss the manufacturing aspects of such tubular preforms and to suggest ways to overcome the wrinkling problems using the mapping results. In terms of the mapping models, existing shear-based algorithms for mapping a flat fabric over open surfaces are first applied to a closed tubular section. Specific algorithms are developed to map a straight tubular preform over a bent tubular section. Wrinkles are prevalent in sections with severe bends and the paper also discusses methods to remove them...|$|R

BackgroundTo assess the prognostic value of tubular lesions and {{cell adhesion}} molecules' expression, a retrospective study with immunohistochemistry was performed on 152 patients presenting lupus nephritis from January 1985 to December 1999. MethodsThe following clinical parameters were recorded: age, sex, race, time of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) diagnosis, time of the biopsy, proteinuria, creatininemia, and renal function {{at the end of}} follow-up. All biopsies were re-evaluated according to a tubular grading, an inflammatory grading, the percentage of sclerosed glomeruli, the percentage of crescents, and the current WHO classification. Immunohistochemistry was performed with anti-CD 40, anti-CD 44, and anti-intercellular adhesion molecule- 1 (anti-ICAM- 1) antibodies. ResultsPatients were 136 women (89. 5 %) and 16 men {{with a mean age of}} 31. 2 years ± 12. 8 at the time of biopsy. The mean follow-up period was 94. 3 months ± 64. 1. Eighty-eight biopsies (58 %) showed various degrees of tubular atrophy. Males (P = 0. 001) and tubular grading (P = 0. 0001) were linked with renal survival in univariate and multivariate analysis. CD 40 (P = 0. 01) and ICAM- 1 (P = 0. 001) tubular expressions were linked with renal survival. ICAM- 1 tubular expression provided additional information for the prognosis of the patients with biopsies showing tubular atrophy (P = 0. 005) or not (P = 0. 05). ConclusionsOur study shows that <b>tubular</b> lesions are <b>good</b> indicator of lupus nephritis outcome.

40|$|Purpose: Alloying {{elements}} in steels {{are used for}} a various reasons. One {{of the most important}} is the achievement of higher strength in required shapes and sizes. Often in very large sections of steels are used for production of the oil country <b>tubular</b> <b>goods</b> (OCTG). Therefore the hardenability of steels is an important property aim for the appropriate concentration of alloying elements needed to harden the section of steel for oil industry. In this study the hardenability, the cooling rates and microstructures of low alloy Cr-Mo and Mn-Mo steels were investigated. Design/methodology/approach: The cooling rate determines the amount of martensite structure. Hardenability test was carried out by Jominy method. During Jominy testing the temperature changes were monitored by means of CrNi-Ni thermocouples which are connected to eight-channel digital/analogues converter. Microstructure was determined using a scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Findings: The cooling rates in the temperature range between 1133 and 973 K at different distances from the quenched end of low alloy Cr-Mo and Mn-Mo steels were found. Also the hardness and microstructures against the distances from quenched end are determined. Research limitations/implications: It is known that carbon has a marked the effect on hardenability of steel, but its use at higher levels is limited because lower toughness and increased probability of distortion and cracking during heat treatment and welding. Addition of manganese at low alloy steels is very useful for improvement of their hardenability. Practical implications: Chemical composition of low alloy steels for oil industry is usually complex and defined in most cases by standard which give range of concentration of the important alloying elements (Cr, Mo, Mn, etc.) as well as the upper limits of impurity elements (S and P). Alloying {{elements in}}crease the cost of the steel and from these reason it is important to select only steels which required to ensure compliance with specifications. The economical way of increasing the hardenability of steels (at constant carbon content) is to increase the manganese content. Originality/value: Originality and high value of our research work based on development and application of a new grade of low alloy Mn-Mo steel for oil country <b>tubular</b> <b>goods...</b>|$|E

Four formulas for collapse are given in API 5 C 3, each valid for a specific D/t range. With increasing yield strength of the steel, the difference between the yield strength collapse and the plastic collapse gets larger. Also, the elastic collapse zone gets bigger, so stronger materials with relatively large D/t ratios will collapse in the elastic zone instead of the plastic or transition zone. These four formulas can be approached by a third-order polynomial equation that is valid for all D/t ratios...|$|E

The objective of the composite OTM development task is to develop the architecture and fabrication techniques necessary to construct stable, high performance, thin film OTMs supported on suitable porous, load bearing substrates. The objective of the process development task of this program to demonstrate the program objectives on a single OTM tube under test conditions simulating those of the optimum process cycle for the power plant.

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} WTO Appellate Body Report on United States-Anti-Dumping Measures on Oil Country <b>Tubular</b> <b>Goods</b> (OCTG) from Mexico (WT/DS 282 /AB/R 2 November 2005). This dispute {{concerns}} the disciplines {{imposed by the}} Anti-Dumping Agreement on WTO Members seeking to extend their anti-dumping measures beyond the original five-year period through a so-called sunset review. Our analysis focuses on the Appellate Body's finding {{in this case that}} no causation analysis is required in sunset reviews, and addresses the AB's approach towards the legal instrument that provides for the US policy in terms of sunset reviews, the Sunset Policy Bulletin. We conclude that the Anti-Dumping Agreement, as interpreted by the Appellate Body in this and other similar cases, imposes only minimal disciplines of a general nature on Members wishing to extend the anti-dumping measure beyond its original five-year period. We argue that the ‘textual' argument relied on to support this deferential approach is weak and has resulted in undermining the practical effect of, what was considered to be, one of the major achievements of the Uruguay Round Anti-Dumping Agreement: limiting the life span of an anti-dumping measure to five years. From an economic perspective, Panels and the Appellate Body are simply debating the wrong type of questions. The prospective nature required by a sunset review analysis raises questions such as why exporters engaged in dumping in the first place, and what the conditions of the industry were so that the dumped imports caused injury.

This means Oil Country <b>Tubular</b> <b>Goods</b> (OCTG) must improve in order to withstand harsher conditions; especially the ability of connections to effectively create leak tight seals. This study investigates the use of thread connections in tight gas fields; therefore, an insight into their potential to contribute to fulfilling the energy demands is necessary. Also, a survey of completed projects done in tight gas fields can provide vital information that will establish the minimum requirements thread connection must meet to perform its functions. To make suitable adjustments to ensure safe and efficient operations we must thoroughly understand the many aspects of thread connections. To have this understanding, a review of previous works was carried out that highlights the capabilities and imitations of thread connections. In addition to reviewing previous work done on thread connections; this study measured the viscosity of thread compounds under variable conditions. It was found that viscosity of thread compound falls in the range of 285, 667 cP and 47, 758 cP when measured between 32. 9 degrees F and 121. 5 degrees F.
