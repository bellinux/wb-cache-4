5|$|The {{cerebrum}} has a contralateral organisation {{with each}} hemisphere {{of the brain}} interacting primarily with {{one half of the}} body: <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> brain interacts with {{the right side of the}} body, and vice versa. The developmental cause for this is uncertain. Motor connections from the brain to the spinal cord, and sensory connections from the spinal cord to the brain, both cross sides in the brainstem. Visual input follows a more complex rule: the optic nerves from the two eyes come together at a point called the optic chiasm, and half of the fibres from each nerve split off to join the other. The result is that connections from the left half of the retina, in both eyes, go to <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> brain, whereas connections from the right half of the retina go to the right side of the brain. Because each half of the retina receives light coming from the opposite half of the visual field, the functional consequence is that visual input from <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world goes to the right side of the brain, and vice versa. Thus, the right side of the brain receives somatosensory input from <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> body, and visual input from <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> visual field.|$|E
5|$|A {{hexagonal}} mortuary {{is located}} on <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> façade. It was built by Father Bon between 1867 and 1868. Inside is a baroque retablo, similar to the altars inside the church. It is now used as an adoration chapel.|$|E

5|$|As {{with other}} toothed whales, {{the skull of}} the sperm whale is {{asymmetrical}} so as to aid echolocation. Sound waves that strike the whale from different directions will not be channeled in the same way. Within the basin of the cranium, the openings of the bony narial tubes (from which the nasal passages spring) are skewed towards <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> skull.|$|E
5|$|In 1983, Atari {{released}} several computer versions {{under the}} Atarisoft label. All {{of the computer}} ports had the cement factory level, {{while most of the}} console versions did not. None of the home versions of Donkey Kong had all of the intermissions or animations from the arcade game. Some have Donkey Kong on <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> screen in the barrel level (like he is in the arcade game) and others have him on the right side.|$|E
5|$|On lap 22, Zorzi {{pulled off}} to <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main straight, {{just after the}} brow of a hill and a bridge over the track. He was having {{problems}} with his fuel metering unit, and fuel was pumping directly onto the engine, which then caught fire. Zorzi did not immediately {{get out of his}} car as he could not disconnect the oxygen pipe from his helmet.|$|E

5|$|The Anfield Road stand, on <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Main Stand, {{houses the}} away fans during matches. The Anfield Road End was rebuilt in 1965, and multi-coloured seats were added in 1982. Originally a single-tier stand, a further revamp, which was {{completed}} in 1998, gave the stand a second-tier providing additional seating.|$|E
5|$|The Mk. XIV {{consisted}} of two independent parts, the sighting head and the computor. The sighting head was located in the bomb aimer's window {{at the front of}} the aircraft. The separate computor cabinet was assembled with the operating knobs positioned on the right side of the case, so it had to be placed on <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fuselage. The two were connected via two flexible cable drives.|$|E
5|$|The {{audience}} is seated {{in front of}} the stage, to <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stage, and in the corner front-left of stage; these are in order of decreasing desirability. While the metsuke-bashira pillar obstructs the view of the stage, the actors are primarily at the corners, not the center, and thus the two aisles are located where the views of the two main actors would be obscured, ensuring a generally clear view regardless of seating.|$|E

5|$|The {{computor}} cabinet {{included only}} four main controls. On <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chassis, {{from top to}} bottom, were dials that set the wind direction, wind speed, target altitude and terminal velocity of the bomb. All of these inputs were set by reading their value in a small window on <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dials. Additional windows provided output values for the indicated airspeed, course, and bombing angle (or range angle). Clips in the upper right held a card with levelling data, as well as notes about the sight or the bombs being dropped. The computor was also connected to several external sources. Compressed air was supplied from the engines to drive the mechanism, and an exhaust allowed the less dense used air to escape. Tubes were also connected to the pitot tube and static air source, which allowed the accurate measurement of airspeed. A separate electrical connection input the direction measured on the distant reading compass, using a selsyn.|$|E
5|$|The engine used {{a single}} updraft carburetor; early {{versions}} used a Stromberg unit, which {{was replaced by}} a Schebler unit. The carburetor was {{on the right side of}} the engine, the mixture went into a passage through the engine block to the intake manifold on <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> engine. Ignition was by Delco coil and breaker points, with the distributor at the end of the generator/starter unit.|$|E
5|$|The side altar {{located on}} the left hand side facing the altar is consecrated to the Santo Niño. Joining the statue of the Holy Child are 19th century images of Saint Anthony of Padua and Saint Blaise; and Saint Lucy on the topmost level. Another smaller neoclassical retablo housing a 19th-century image of Saint Mary Magdalene is located on <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gospel retablo.|$|E

5|$|Combat in Final Fantasy is menu-based: {{the player}} selects an action {{from a list}} of options such as Attack, Magic, and Item. Battles are turn-based and {{continue}} until either side flees or is defeated. If the player's party wins, each character will gain experience and Gil; if it flees, it will be returned to the map screen; and if every character in the party dies, the game will be over and all unsaved progress will be lost. Final Fantasy was the first game to show the player's characters {{on the right side of}} the screen and the enemies on <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> screen, as opposed to a first-person view.|$|E
5|$|Cunningham {{was allowed}} back onto operations. He was given command of No. 85 Squadron RAF, {{equipped}} with the de Havilland Mosquito NF.II based at Hunsdon. He selected Jimmy Rawnsley as his operator. The radar set displayed the entire picture. A small cathode-ray tube set on <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> instrument panel gave Cunningham a composite image. The duo decided Rawnsley should control the interception {{in the initial stages}} until they reached a point where the enemy could take evasive action. Then Cunningham would take over while Rawnsley would call out the ranges and free the pilot from looking at his ray-tube.|$|E
5|$|During {{conversations with}} characters, Mass Effect 2 employs a radial command menu, called Dialogue Wheel, where the player's {{dialogue}} options depend on wheel direction. <b>The</b> <b>left</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wheel is normally reserved for options {{that will continue}} the conversation in depth, while options {{on the right side}} tend to move the conversation towards completion. Responses at the top are generally more polite and selfless, while those at the bottom are more aggressive and hostile. The game also introduces a context-sensitive interrupt system, allowing players to interrupt the conversation with direct actions at certain times. Dialogue choices impact how others react to Shepard, the rewards for completing missions, possible discounts from merchants, romances and, most importantly, the Commander's morality.|$|E

5|$|In roughly 1 out {{of every}} 100200people, the right {{inferior}} laryngeal nerve is nonrecurrent, branching off the vagus nerve around {{the level of the}} cricoid cartilage. Typically, such a configuration is accompanied by variation in the arrangement of the major arteries in the chest; most commonly, the right subclavian artery arises from <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> aorta and crosses behind the esophagus. A left nonrecurrent inferior laryngeal nerve is even more uncommon, requiring the aortic arch be on the right side, accompanied by an arterial variant which prevents the nerve from being drawn into the chest by the left subclavian.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool's {{pressure}} {{paid off}} in the 68th minute as McManaman scored a second goal. From <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pitch, McManaman went past Green, then McAteer, before he got in front of Seagraves and scored with a shot into the Bolton goal. Bolton replied immediately. Liverpool defender Neil Ruddock's clearance was played back into the Liverpool penalty area by Guðni Bergsson who had replaced Green. Paatelainen headed the ball onto Thompson, whose shot went into the Liverpool goal. Bolton continued to pressure Liverpool {{in search of the}} equaliser but were unable to score and Liverpool won the match 2–1 to claim their fifth League Cup victory.|$|E
5|$|Nani {{scored on}} his debut in a {{pre-season}} friendly against Shenzhen, scoring {{the third in}} a 6–0 win. He also scored in the following match against Guangzhou Pharmaceutical with a chip off the right post from <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> penalty area in a 3–0 win. On 5 August 2007, Nani made his competitive debut for United, coming on as a substitute in the Community Shield against Chelsea. He marked his debut with a trophy after they won 3–0 on penalties, following a 1–1 draw during normal time. This was followed up by Nani's third goal for the club three days later, when he scored against Glentoran in another 3–0 pre-season win.|$|E
