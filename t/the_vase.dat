50|$|In 2008, two ceramic vases by Xu {{came into}} the centre of a legal tussle, between the sponsor of the art {{exhibition}} titled Xu Beihong In Nanyang at the Singapore Art Museum and the family friends of Xu. The art collectors Huang Man Shi and Huang Meng Gui had passed <b>the</b> <b>vases</b> and some of Xu's paintings to Mr Jack Bonn, a Hong Kong art dealer in 2006, to be auctioned off at Christie's auction house. <b>The</b> 18 cm-high <b>vases</b> {{were made in the}} 1940s, and titled Malay Dancers and Orchid. These items were to be returned if the auctions failed. Instead, <b>the</b> <b>vases</b> went on show at the Museum without the approval from the owners. The Museum maintained they were unaware of any legal implications surrounding the artifacts. It was only {{after the end of the}} exhibition in July 2008, that the Museum received notice to reclaim <b>the</b> <b>vases</b> from Jack Bonn. In 2009 <b>the</b> <b>vases</b> were returned to the descendants of the Huang brothers.|$|R

5|$|Today, New South Wales waratahs {{are grown}} commercially in Australia north of Sydney {{and in the}} Dandenong Ranges near Melbourne. They are also grown commercially in New Zealand and in Israel, and also in Hawaii, {{where they have been}} grown since 1961. One major {{challenge}} in commercial production is that in any one location the flowering season is generally short (five weeks total, with only small numbers in the earliest and latest weeks). The season for cut flowers may be extended, however, by growing plants at different latitudes. <b>The</b> <b>vase</b> life of a cut waratah is 10 to 14 days, and cut flower waratahs can be revived somewhat by water.|$|E
5|$|The cup was {{probably}} made in Alexandria, Egypt. It was {{once thought to}} {{date back to the}} Hellenistic period, c. 250 BC, but is now regarded as dating to the 1st century AD. Its supposed connection with the Ptolemies dates back to a description in 1644 by historian Jean Tristan de Saint-Amant; he argued that <b>the</b> <b>vase</b> was made for the funeral processions of Ptolemy II Philadelphus, who ruled the Ptolemaic Kingdom of Egypt from 285 until 246 BC. Scholar E. Babelon argued that the cup had been made in Egypt during the general time of the Ptolemies, a much looser range stretching from 305 to 30 BC. However, there is no particular evidence for this, and other scholars, such as John Henry Middleton or Martin Conway, suggest that the cup was carved later, during the first or second centuries AD by Romans. Dating the cup has been problematic largely because similar pieces are rare, making comparison difficult.|$|E
5|$|Zimri-Lim {{started his}} reign with a {{campaign}} against the Banu-Yamina, he also established alliances with Eshnunna and Hammurabi of Babylon, and sent his armies to aid the Babylonians. The new king directed his expansion policy toward the north in the Upper Khabur region, which was named Idamaraz, where he subjugated the local petty kingdoms in the region such as Urkesh, and Talhayum, forcing them into vassalage. The expansion was met by the resistance of Qarni-Lim, the king of Andarig, whom Zimri-Lim defeated, securing the Mariote control over the region in c. 1771 BC, and the kingdom prospered as a trading center and entered a period of relative peace. Zimri-Lim's greatest heritage was the renovation of the Royal Palace, which was expanded greatly to contain 275 rooms, exquisite artifacts such as The Goddess of <b>the</b> <b>Vase</b> statue, and a royal archive that contained thousands of tablets.|$|E
40|$|Cataloged from PDF {{version of}} article. The Old Hittite polychrome relief-decorated vases have {{attracted}} scholarly interest {{since the first}} substantial fragment was discovered at Bitik in the 1940 s. Academics have concurred that <b>the</b> <b>vases</b> illustrate cult practice, but have differed {{as to whether the}} figures portray the king or the gods, both, or neither. The publishing in 2008 of a second nearly complete vase now permits a programmatic comparison between it and <b>the</b> famous İnandıktepe <b>vase</b> (published 1988). This thesis studies the vases’ decorative program and contends that <b>the</b> relief <b>vases</b> represent centralized monumental art. In contrast with iconography of the preceding and later periods, <b>the</b> <b>vases</b> portray gods without attributes. Similarly, the vases’ reliefs depict an anonymous king who engages alongside others in cult activities. Rank is de-emphasized. The focus on solidarity within the ruling group recalls the major historical document of the period, the Edict of Telepinu. Material evidence also links <b>the</b> <b>vases</b> to <b>the</b> network of royal storehouses, listed {{in the second part of}} the Edict. This political requirement of solidarity evident in <b>the</b> <b>vases</b> may have arisen from the exigencies of supporting chariotry, a new form of warfare. Moore, ThomasM. S...|$|R

5|$|The {{music video}} begins with Clarkson {{sitting on a}} couch in an apartment's living room, holding a {{heart-shaped}} locket in her hand. The next scene shows Clarkson in the bathroom where she fixes {{her face in the}} mirror, she opens the medicine cabinet and tossing all the pills in the medicine cabinet over her shoulder and messing all the bathroom items on the floor, squirting the toothpaste into the sink. When she gets to a container of birth control pills, she turns on the water in the sink, snaps the pills out, and drops them down the drain. Clarkson then starts to take other items; she throws a container of makeup powder spray in the air and smears a container of facial mud mask on the wall. During the chorus, Clarkson and her band perform the song for a dancing crowd in a club. After the first chorus, Clarkson walks into a room full of closets. She cuts up dresses, rifling through the closets and pulling out clothes, destroying them and singing in a pile of them. After the second chorus, she walks into a bedroom and begins to tear the pillow on the bed, filling the room with feathers. The scenes of Clarkson singing with her band then alternate with a montage of her destroying the apartment, breaks the glass window from the door, breaks <b>the</b> <b>vase,</b> television, clock, fridge, lights, microwave, phone, furniture and the chair. Later, Clarkson takes a framed photo of her ex-boyfriend with another girl in the living room, before pushing a tall CD rack over. She then smashes the framed photo through a glass table, breaking it in half. Having decimated the apartment, Clarkson walks out the door and down the hallway with a hat on her head, just as her ex-boyfriend appears with his girlfriend, walking arm in arm. Clarkson hides her face as she walks away from them. The final scene shows the couple seeing their damaged apartment in shock and the scene of the locket swinging.|$|E

25|$|The {{foundation}} for pottery painting {{is the image}} carrier, in other words <b>the</b> <b>vase</b> onto which an image is painted. Popular shapes alternated with passing fashions.

25|$|The change-of-state {{property}} of Verb Phrases (VP) {{is a significant}} observation for the syntax of lexical semantics because it provides evidence that subunits are embedded in the VP structure, and that {{the meaning of the}} entire VP is influenced by this internal grammatical structure. (For example, the VP <b>the</b> <b>vase</b> broke carries a change-of-state meaning of <b>the</b> <b>vase</b> becoming broken, and thus has a silent BECOME subunit within its underlying structure.) There are two types of change-of-state predicates: inchoative and causative.|$|E

50|$|The clay of <b>the</b> <b>vases</b> {{is mixed}} with gold mica, which is normal in Hittite pottery. They were turned on a potter's wheel. After they were turned, figures made of {{high-quality}} clay were attached {{to the surface of}} <b>the</b> <b>vases,</b> in friezes. <b>The</b> surfaces were hatched to encourage adhesion. The resulting composition consists of red, black and cream coloured clays.|$|R

25|$|The knife was {{designed}} exclusively for surprise attack and fighting, with a slender blade {{that can easily}} penetrate a ribcage. <b>The</b> <b>vase</b> handle grants precise grip, and the blade's design is especially suited to its use as a fighting knife.

25|$|The {{success of}} all this effort could only be judged after a complicated, {{three-phase}} firing process which generated the red color of <b>the</b> <b>vase</b> clay and the black of the applied slip. Specifically, the vessel was fired in a kiln at a temperature of about 800°C, with the resultant oxidization turning <b>the</b> <b>vase</b> a reddish-orange color. The temperature was then raised to about 950°C with the kiln's vents closed and green wood added to remove the oxygen. The vessel then turned an overall black. The final stage required the vents to be re-opened to allow oxygen into the kiln, which was allowed to cool down. The vessel then returned to its reddish-orange colour due to renewed oxidization, while the now-sintered painted layer remained the glossy black color which had been created in the second stage.|$|E

25|$|Among black-figure Attic vases, the Panathenaic prize amphoras play {{a special}} role. After 566 BC—when the Panathenaic {{celebrations}} were introduced or reorganized—they were {{the prize for}} the winners of sport competitions and were filled with olive oil, one of the city's main export goods. On the front they routinely bore {{the image of the}} goddess Athena standing between two pillars on which roosters perched; on the back there was a sports scene. The shape was always the same and was only modified slightly over the long period of its production. The belly amphora was, as its name suggests, originally especially bulbous, with a short neck and a long, narrow foot. Around 530 BC the necks become shorter and the body somewhat narrower. Around 400 BC <b>the</b> <b>vase</b> shoulders were considerably reduced in width and the curve of <b>the</b> <b>vase</b> body looked constricted. After 366 BC the vases were again more elegant and become even narrower.|$|E
