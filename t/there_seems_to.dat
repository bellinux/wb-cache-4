5|$|Members of {{the family}} Theridiidae weave irregular, tangled, {{three-dimensional}} webs, popularly known as cobwebs. <b>There</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> be an evolutionary trend towards {{a reduction in the}} amount of sticky silk used, leading to its total absence in some species. The construction of cobwebs is less stereotyped than that of orb-webs, and may take several days.|$|E

5|$|<b>There</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> only be one known {{example of}} extreme marital strife in Tolkien's mythology, that of Eöl and Aredhel, {{in which the}} latter {{actually}} left the former without his knowledge, resulting in Eöl ultimately killing her (albeit he was actually trying to kill their son Maeglin). However, this marriage was far from typical of the Elves.|$|E
5|$|This rockfowl is {{protected}} {{in some of}} the areas in which it lives by national parks. Additionally, <b>there</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> be little habitat destruction in Gabon and on Bioko as the locations in these places in which the rockfowl lives is believed to be too inaccessible for future human development. Recent surveys have also discovered new populations of the grey-necked rockfowl.|$|E

5|$|A map of Kintzheim in Alsace from 1348 {{contains}} the text zu dem Russelinge, {{but it is}} not certain that this reference is to the grape variety. However, in 1477, Riesling was documented in Alsace under the spelling Rissling. In Wachau in Austria, there is a small stream and a small vineyard both called Ritzling, which are claimed locally to have given Riesling its name. However, <b>there</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> be no documentary evidence to back this up, so this claim is not widely believed to be correct.|$|E
5|$|A {{researcher}} {{examining the}} skeleton identifies {{it as the}} missing victim from 1933. However, <b>there</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> be no substantial evidence proving that Tooms was the murderer. Scully relieves Mulder, who is watching Tooms' new residence; they are unaware that Tooms is hiding {{in the trunk of}} Mulder's car. He manages to break into Mulder's apartment, where he injures himself and imprints Mulder's shoe print on his face. Tooms' frameup leads the police to question Mulder. Skinner then forbids Mulder from contacting Tooms.|$|E
5|$|In {{the period}} before the Norman Conquest, Somerset {{came under the}} control of Godwin, Earl of Wessex, and his family. <b>There</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> have been some Danish {{settlement}} at Thurloxton and Spaxton, judging from the place-names. After the Norman Conquest, the county was divided into 700 fiefs, and large areas were owned by the crown, with fortifications such as Dunster Castle used for control and defence.|$|E

5|$|Not {{only have}} the {{symbionts}} and specific species been shown to shift, but <b>there</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> be a certain growth rate favorable to selection. Slower-growing but more heat-tolerant corals have become more common. The changes in temperature and acclimation are complex. Some reefs in current shadows represent a refugium location {{that will help them}} adjust to the disparity in the environment even if eventually the temperatures may rise more quickly there than in other locations. This separation of populations by climatic barriers causes a realized niche to shrink greatly in comparison to the old fundamental niche.|$|E
5|$|The {{evidence}} for auxiliary ranks and pay is scant: even less exists than the patchy {{evidence for}} their legionary counterparts. <b>There</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> be some consensus, however, that the auxiliary was paid {{one third of}} what a legionary received: 300 sesterces a year (400 after {{the reign of the}} emperor Commodus). Both auxiliaries and seamen received the viaticum of 300 sesterces, although the various sources differ as to whether auxiliaries and sailors received the retirement bonus known as the honesta missio, or honorable discharge.|$|E
5|$|There is {{not much}} {{evidence}} that the chariot races were subject to bribes {{or other forms of}} cheating in the Roman Empire. In the Byzantine Empire, <b>there</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> have been more cheating; Justinian I's reformed legal code prohibits drivers from placing curses on their opponents, but otherwise there {{does not seem to have}} been any mechanical tampering or bribery. Wearing the colours of one's team became an important aspect of Byzantine dress.|$|E

5|$|<b>There</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> prevail {{the opinion}} in some {{quarters}} that this meeting has been called {{for the purpose of}} inaugurating a riot, hence these warlike preparations on the part of so-called 'law and order.' However, let me tell you at the beginning that this meeting has not been called for any such purpose. The object of this meeting is to explain the general situation of the eight-hour movement and to throw light upon various incidents in connection with it.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{being more}} powerfully built than other large cats, Smilodon had a weaker bite. Modern big cats have more {{pronounced}} zygomatic arches, while these were smaller in Smilodon, which restricted the thickness and therefore {{power of the}} temporalis muscles and thus reduced Smilodons bite force. Analysis of its narrow jaws indicates that it could produce a bite only a third as strong {{as that of a}} lion. <b>There</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> be a general rule that the saber-toothed cats with the largest canines had proportionally weaker bites. Analyses of canine bending strength (the ability of the canine teeth to resist bending forces without breaking) and bite forces indicate that the saber-toothed cats' teeth were stronger relative to the bite force than those of modern big cats. In addition, Smilodons gape could have reached almost 120 degrees, while that of the modern lion reaches 65 degrees. This made the gape wide enough to allow Smilodon to grasp large prey despite the long canines.|$|E
5|$|Despite their {{physical}} isolation, the islanders maintained a lively community. A school {{had been established}} in 1723 by the Society for Propagating Christian Knowledge (SPCK), with sixty children on its initial attendance roll. The demands of island life conflicted to some extent with those of schooling. The SPCK's inspector found only eighteen out of seventy pupils present when he visited in 1824. He found {{that many of the}} children were fully occupied helping their families in summer and only attended school in winter. Two places of worship were built within a couple of years of each other, a Baptist chapel in 1877 and a Church of Scotland church in 1878 (at a cost of £900). Although they soon became focal elements of community life, <b>there</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> have been some bad blood between the two congregations, perhaps due to a clash between the missionary zeal of local Baptists and the Calvinism of the Presbyterian Kirk.|$|E

5|$|Edington's {{parents were}} Roger and Amice of Edington near Westbury, Wiltshire. Though {{it has been}} claimed that he was educated at Oxford, <b>there</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> be no support for this. His first patron, however, was the Oxford {{chancellor}} Gilbert Middleton, {{who was also a}} royal counsellor. When Middleton died in 1331, Edington entered the service of Middleton's friend, Adam Orleton, Bishop of Winchester. Through Orleton, Edington's abilities were {{brought to the attention of}} King Edward III, and in 1341 the King named him keeper of the wardrobe. The position was an important one; the wardrobe functioned as the treasury while the King was on campaign, and Edward strongly resisted any attempts to limit this royal prerogative.|$|E
5|$|Over the winter, <b>there</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> {{have been}} some tension between the Allies. In particular, the Athenians, who were not {{protected}} by the isthmus, but whose fleet were {{the key to the}} security of the Peloponnesus, felt hard done by. They demanded an Allied army march north the following year. When the other Allies failed to commit to this, the Athenian fleet probably refused to join the Allied navy in the spring. The navy, now under the command of the Spartan king Leotychides, thus skulked off Delos, while the remnants of the Persian fleet skulked off Samos, both sides unwilling to risk battle. Similarly, Mardonius remained in Thessaly, knowing an attack on the isthmus was pointless, while the Allies refused to send an army outside the Peloponessus.|$|E
5|$|The {{implications}} here is that, {{from this}} time onwards, the Hiberno-Scandinavian ruler would hold his kingship from his Munster overlord. Brian, at this stage, aspired to an even tighter dominance of Dublin that than secured by his rival, Máel Sechnaill mac Domnaill , ten years earlier. <b>There</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> {{be little doubt that}} the longer term beneficiary of Glenn Máma was Brian alone. With renewed confidence, he again moved against Máel Sechnaill| Máel Sechnaill mac Domnaill, even if his initiatives of 1000-1001 resulted in setbacks, one expedition into Brega resulted in his advance cavalry being slaughtered by the Uí Néill, another foray was reversed in Míde (Co Westmeath), and the Dál Cais river-fleet was impeded by the King of Tara and his Connachta allies having constructed a barrier across the Shannon. Brian, however, found a way of circumventing hit and, early in 1002, brought a large army through to Athlone and took the hostages of Connacht.|$|E
