5|$|If the {{governor}} becomes incapacitated, then <b>the</b> <b>Lieutenant</b> <b>Governor</b> of Indiana becomes acting-governor until his recovery. Only two governors have become incapacitated during their terms, and current precedent is that {{the governor}}'s office is to notify <b>the</b> <b>lieutenant</b> <b>governor,</b> who will then {{make the decision to}} become acting governor by notifying the General Assembly by letter. The governor can resume his powers and duties by sending a letter to the General Assembly notifying them that he is again capable of executing the duties of office. If the governor resigns, dies, or is impeached, tried, and convicted, then <b>the</b> <b>lieutenant</b> <b>governor</b> becomes governor. If the office of <b>the</b> <b>lieutenant</b> <b>governor</b> is vacant, then the Senate Pro-Tempore becomes governor. If the office of Senate President pro tempore is also vacant, then the Senate must elect a new Pro-Tempore to fill the governor's office.|$|E
5|$|If {{the office}} of {{governor}} becomes vacant through death, resignation, or conviction on impeachment, <b>the</b> <b>lieutenant</b> <b>governor</b> becomes governor {{for the remainder of}} the term; if the office is only temporarily vacant due to disability of the governor, <b>the</b> <b>lieutenant</b> <b>governor</b> only acts out the duties of governor. Should both offices be vacant, the president pro tempore of the state senate becomes governor. The position of lieutenant governor was created in the 1874 constitution; prior to then, the speaker of the senate would act as governor in cases of vacancy. Originally, <b>the</b> <b>lieutenant</b> <b>governor</b> could only act as governor; it was not until the 1968 constitution that <b>the</b> <b>lieutenant</b> <b>governor</b> could actually become governor in that fashion. The office of governor has been vacant for an extended period once, a 17-day gap in 1848 between the resignation of the previous governor and the swearing in of his acting successor. Governors and lieutenant governors are elected on the same ticket.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Lieutenant</b> <b>Governor</b> of New Jersey is {{an elected}} {{constitutional}} {{officer in the}} executive branch of the state government of New Jersey in the United States. <b>The</b> <b>lieutenant</b> <b>governor</b> is the second highest-ranking official in the state government and is elected concurrently on a ticket with the governor for a four-year term. Because the position itself does not carry any powers or duties other than to be next in the order of succession, the state constitution requires that <b>the</b> <b>lieutenant</b> <b>governor</b> be appointed to serve as the head of a cabinet-level department or administrative agency within the governor's administration.|$|E
50|$|The seven Prizes, {{as well as}} <b>The</b> <b>Lieutenant</b> <b>Governor’s</b> Award for Literary Excellence, are {{presented}} annually at <b>the</b> <b>Lieutenant</b> <b>Governor’s</b> BC Book Prize Gala in April.|$|R
25|$|The viceroys {{themselves}} {{also offer}} awards, such as <b>the</b> <b>Lieutenant</b> <b>Governor's</b> Award for Outstanding Service to Rural Saskatchewan, <b>the</b> <b>Lieutenant</b> <b>Governor's</b> Nova Scotia Talent Trust Award, and <b>the</b> <b>Lieutenant</b> <b>Governor's</b> Award for Excellence in Architecture, awarded in New Brunswick, and the Heritage Canada Foundation also presents <b>the</b> <b>Lieutenant</b> <b>Governor's</b> Award, presented {{to an individual}} or group who has achieved an outstanding result in heritage conservation in the province in which the Heritage Canada Foundation's annual conference is held. Further, <b>the</b> <b>lieutenant</b> <b>governors</b> (as well as the territorial commissioners) present the Vice-Regal and Commissioners' Commendation to individuals who offer their service—paid or volunteer—to the viceregal offices. It was originally {{intended to be a}} distinction in place of appointment to the Royal Victorian Order, regularly granted to those who aided the monarch or governor general with distinction, but nominees from <b>the</b> <b>lieutenant</b> <b>governors</b> were frequently overlooked by staff at Rideau Hall. However, after 1984, suggestions from <b>the</b> <b>lieutenant</b> governors' offices for membership in the Royal Victorian Order were more readily accepted and the Vice-Regal and Commissioners' Commendation became an award for one or more commendable acts benefiting the viceroy.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Lieutenant</b> <b>Governor’s</b> Award for Literary Excellence {{was first}} {{conceived}} {{in the spring}} of 2002. Led by the late Carol Shields, a group of respected BC writers met with <b>the</b> current <b>Lieutenant</b> <b>Governor</b> of British Columbia, the Honourable Iona Campagnolo to initiate a special provincial literary arts award. Inspired by Shields, this meeting resulted in the establishment of <b>the</b> <b>Lieutenant</b> <b>Governor’s</b> Award for Literary Excellence.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>lieutenant</b> <b>governor</b> has two {{constitutional}} functions. The {{primary function}} is {{to serve as the}} President of the Indiana Senate. In the Senate <b>the</b> <b>lieutenant</b> <b>governor</b> is permitted to debate on legislation, introduce legislation, and vote on matters to break ties. As presiding officer in the Senate, lieutenant governors also have partial control over what legislation will be considered, and influence on the legislative calendar. Unless a special session is called by the governor, the Senate meets for no more than 91 days in any two years period, leaving <b>the</b> <b>lieutenant</b> <b>governor</b> free from his or her senatorial duties in the remainder of the year.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of the powers exercised by <b>the</b> <b>lieutenant</b> <b>governor</b> are statutory and have been assigned by the Indiana General Assembly. The first additional powers granted to <b>the</b> <b>lieutenant</b> <b>governor</b> were added in 1932 when the office holder was made {{the head of the}} state's agricultural commission. The office's powers have since expanded to include the chairmanship of the Office of Community and Rural Affairs, the Indiana Housing and Community Development Authority, Office of Energy and Defense Development, and the Office of Tourism Development. As head of the various office and committees, <b>the</b> <b>lieutenant</b> <b>governor</b> controls many patronage positions and is permitted to fill them by appointment. Important positions filled by <b>the</b> <b>lieutenant</b> <b>governor</b> include the members of the Corn Marketing Council, the Main Street Council, Steel Advisory Commission, and the Indiana Film Commission.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, an Order in Council {{delegated}} to <b>the</b> <b>lieutenant</b> <b>governor</b> {{the power to}} grant royal assent to bills passed by Tynwald. <b>The</b> <b>lieutenant</b> <b>governor</b> must however refer any bill impacting on reserved powers (defence, foreign relations, nationality law, {{the relationship between the}} island and the United Kingdom and any matters relating to the monarch) to the British government for advice, on which he is required to act.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> {{office of}} <b>Lieutenant</b> <b>Governor</b> {{was created by}} the North Carolina Constitution of 1868. Just as the Vice President of the United States presides (albeit rarely) over the United States Senate, <b>the</b> <b>lieutenant</b> <b>governor's</b> primary {{responsibility}} is to preside over the North Carolina Senate; until 1970, this was <b>the</b> <b>lieutenant</b> <b>governor's</b> only major responsibility, and the position was only part-time. The position is now a full-time job.|$|R

5|$|Like all Canadian provinces, Manitoba {{is governed}} by a unicameral {{legislative}} assembly. The executive branch is formed by the governing party; the party leader is the premier of Manitoba, {{the head of the}} executive branch. The head of state, Queen ElizabethII, is represented by <b>the</b> <b>Lieutenant</b> <b>Governor</b> of Manitoba, who is appointed by the Governor General of Canada on advice of the Prime Minister. The head of state is primarily a ceremonial role, although <b>the</b> <b>Lieutenant</b> <b>Governor</b> has the official responsibility of ensuring that Manitoba has a duly constituted government.|$|E
5|$|Should {{the office}} of {{governor}} become vacant, <b>the</b> <b>lieutenant</b> <b>governor</b> becomes governor. If both the offices governor and lieutenant governor are vacant, the line of succession moves down through the {{senior members of the}} state senate and state house of representatives of the same party as the governor. <b>The</b> <b>lieutenant</b> <b>governor</b> was elected separately from the governor until a 1968 amendment to the constitution made it so that they are elected on the same ticket.|$|E
5|$|The Canadian {{province}} of Alberta holds elections to its unicameral legislative body, the Legislative Assembly of Alberta. The maximum period between general elections {{of the assembly}} is five years, but <b>the</b> <b>Lieutenant</b> <b>Governor</b> is able to call one at any time. However, the Premier has typically asked <b>the</b> <b>Lieutenant</b> <b>Governor</b> to call the election in {{the fourth or fifth}} year after the preceding election. The number of seats has increased over time, from 25 for the first election in 1905, to the current 87.|$|E

5|$|The {{office of}} {{lieutenant}} governor {{was created in}} 1868, abolished in 1875, and recreated in 1901.

Earlier constitutions said the powers of the governor devolved upon the successor, rather than them necessarily becoming governor, but the official listing includes these as full governors.

2500|$|Beginning {{immediately}} after confederation, the Dominion {{government and the}} Colonial Office in London considered <b>the</b> <b>lieutenant</b> <b>governors</b> as representatives of, and subordinate to, the governor general in Ottawa, reflecting the view of John A.

5|$|Should {{the office}} of {{governor}} become vacant, <b>the</b> <b>lieutenant</b> <b>governor</b> becomes governor, followed in order of succession by the Secretary of State and the Attorney General.

The term begins at noon on January 1 of the year following the election. Prior to the 1963 constitution, the governor and lieutenant governor were elected through separate votes, allowing them to be from different parties. In 1963, this was changed, so that votes are cast jointly for a governor and lieutenant governor of the same party.|$|E
