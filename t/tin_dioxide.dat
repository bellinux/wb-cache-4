5|$|In {{the early}} 1800s, John Dalton used {{the concept of}} atoms to explain why {{elements}} always react in ratios of small whole numbers (the law of multiple proportions). For instance, {{there are two types}} of tin oxide: one is 88.1% tin and 11.9% oxygen and the other is 78.7% tin and 21.3% oxygen (tin(II) oxide and <b>tin</b> <b>dioxide</b> respectively). This means that 100g of tin will combine either with 13.5g or 27g of oxygen. 13.5 and 27 form a ratio of 1:2, a ratio of small whole numbers. This common pattern in chemistry suggested to Dalton that elements react in whole number multiples of discrete units—in other words, atoms. In the case of tin oxides, one tin atom will combine with either one or two oxygen atoms.|$|E

Linear sweep voltammetry was used to identify the electrode potentials that favour MO degradation. Batch electrolyses were then carried out at a constant electrode potential of 1. 5, 1. 75 and 2. 0 V vs. SHE using either a three-electrode batch cell or a flow reactor.

50|$|Ultra-high-temperature {{ceramics}} (UHTCs) are a {{class of}} refractory ceramics that offer excellent stability at temperatures exceeding 2000 °C being investigated as possible thermal protection system (TPS) materials, coatings for materials subjected to high temperatures, and bulk materials for heating elements. Broadly speaking, UHTCs are borides, carbides, nitrides, and oxides of early transition metals. Current efforts have focused on heavy, early transition metal borides such as hafnium diboride (HfB2) and zirconium diboride (ZrB2); additional UHTCs under investigation for TPS applications include hafnium nitride (HfN), zirconium nitride (ZrN), titanium carbide (TiC), titanium nitride (<b>TiN),</b> thorium <b>dioxide</b> (ThO2), tantalum carbide (TaC) and their associated composites.|$|R

The ternary oxide coating {{was used for the}} electrochemical combustion of indigo textile dye as a model organic compound in chloride medium. Bulk electrolyses were then carried out at different volumetric flow rates under galvanostatic conditions using a filter-press flow cell. The galvanostatic tests using RNO confirmed that Ti/IrO 2 -SnO 2 -Sb 2 O 5 favor the hydroxyl radical formation at current densities between 5 and 7 mA cm - 2, while at current density of 10 mA cm - 2 the oxygen evolution reaction occurs. The indigo was totally decolorized and mineralized via reactive oxygen species, such as (· OH, H 2 O 2, O 3 and active chlorine) formed in-situ at the Ti/IrO 2 -SnO 2 -Sb 2 O 5 surface at volumetric flow rates between 0. 1 - 0. 4 L min - 1 and at fixed current density of 7 mA cm - 2.

During calcination all the Sb ions in an antimony-containing <b>tin</b> <b>dioxide</b> catalyst transform into the +5 oxidation state. Following the catalytic reaction, almost all Sb ions revert from the +5 to the +3 oxidation state. A significant change in the chemical environment surrounding the antimony nucleus occurs during the oxidation state change which can easily be monitored as an isomer shift in the Mössbauer spectrum.|$|E
500|$|John Dalton {{studied and}} {{expanded}} upon this previous work and developed {{the law of}} multiple proportions: if two elements can be combined to form {{a number of possible}} compounds, then the ratios of the masses of the second element which combine with a fixed mass of the first element will be ratios of small whole numbers. [...] For example: Proust had studied tin oxides and found that their masses were either 88.1% tin and 11.9% oxygen or 78.7% tin and 21.3% oxygen (these were tin(II) oxide and <b>tin</b> <b>dioxide</b> respectively). Dalton noted from these percentages that 100g of tin will combine either with 13.5g or 27g of oxygen; 13.5 and 27 form a ratio of 1:2. Dalton found that an atomic theory of matter could elegantly explain this common pattern in chemistry. In the case of Proust's tin oxides, one tin atom will combine with either one or two oxygen atoms.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the case}} of the {{original}} Grätzel and O'Regan design, the cell has 3 primary parts. On top is a transparent anode made of fluoride-doped <b>tin</b> <b>dioxide</b> (SnO2:F) deposited {{on the back of a}} (typically glass) plate. On the back of this conductive plate is a thin layer of titanium dioxide (TiO2), which forms into a highly porous structure with an extremely high surface area. The (TiO2) is chemically bound by a process called sintering. TiO2 only absorbs a small fraction of the solar photons (those in the UV). [...] The plate is then immersed in a mixture of a photosensitive ruthenium-polypyridine dye (also called molecular sensitizers) and a solvent. After [...] the film in the dye solution, a thin layer of the dye is left covalently bonded to the surface of the TiO2. The bond is either an ester, chelating, or bidentate bridging linkage.|$|E
50|$|Potassium {{carbonate}} crystals {{are destroyed}} by the melting process so that the urea can react with almost all potassium ions to convert to potassium cyanate {{at a higher rate}} than when {{in the form of a}} salt. This makes it easier to reach higher purities above 95%. It can also be made by oxidizing potassium cyanide at a high temperature in the presence of oxygen or easily reduced oxides, such as lead, <b>tin,</b> or manganese <b>dioxide,</b> and in aqueoues solution by reacting with hypochlorites or hydrogen peroxide. Another way to synthesize it is to allow an alkali metal, cyanide, to react with oxygen in nickel containers under controlled conditions. It can be formed by the oxidation of ferrocyanide. Lastly, it can be made by heating potassium cyanide with lead oxide.|$|R

The theory of nonspecular reflection, the Kubelka-Munk model, and bandgap structure is explored. The methods, procedure, and equipment involved in measurements are detailed. The bandgap energies of titanium <b>dioxide,</b> <b>tin</b> sulfide, and 10 percent tin doped indium oxide are determined. The measured bandgap energy of TiO₂ agrees within 0. 03 eV of the accepted value. The measured bandgap energy of SnS was inconsistent with the accepted value and is most likely attributable to incorrect infrared spectral data.

Presented here are the results of experimental research on growth, device fabrication and application of quasi-one dimensional phthalocyanines and metal oxides to gas-sensing. The possibility of rational tuning of the growth conditions, in order to control composition, morphology, size, orientation and alignment of the grown low-dimensional nanostructures was investigated. Employing custom designed heating stages coupled with optical microscope the in situ approach of monitoring the growth of nanostructures has been realized. Using this method, the growth of VO 2 nanowires and nanoplatelets have been investigated and two novel growth mechanisms were discovered and explained. 	A variety of phthalocyanine and metal-oxide nanowire-based chemical sensors have been proposed, fabricated and tested. The focus of our research was on the development of new sensing principles and the improvement of existing ones. In particular, nanowires of <b>tin</b> and titanium <b>dioxide</b> were proposed to be used as self-heated chemiresistors capable of operating {{in the absence of an}} external heater, thus paving the way for ultra-low power consumption sensors. For the first time VO 2 nanowires were used to create a nano-Pirani gauge and a gas sensor employing a sharp temperature-driven metal-insulator transition in this material. The sensor is sensitive to both chemically active and inert gases. Its performance is modeled and optimization parameters are presented...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{foreseen}} {{depletion of}} conventional energy resources coupled to the greenhouse gases emissions is urging {{the scientific community}} to find energy alternatives. Hydrogen will represent a credible alternative in the future, provided {{that it can be}} produced and converted without any impact on the environment. Water splitting for hydrogen production and fuel cells use for electricity supply and heat cogeneration may be part of the answer. Their development still need some improvements on both processes and materials aspects. Active materials based on aerogels are possible promising candidates, as catalyst supports or photocatalysts, due to a specific morphology and suited properties well adapted to the aforementioned applications. Doped <b>tin</b> or titanium <b>dioxide</b> aerogels have thus been synthesized in our laboratory in order to help improving the performance and the durability of low temperature fuel cells [1, 2, 3], namely PEMFC, and water splitting process for hydrogen production [4]. We propose to summarize our work on this class of materials for the specified applications. The synthesis, based on the sol-gel process associated to supercritical drying, allowed to readily prepare doped oxides aerogels, while i) keeping reasonable specific surface areas and ii) providing adequate porosity.

40|$|With recent {{advances}} in engineering, thin film technology is playing an increasingly important rote in spearheading technological advancement of future society. Aside from traditional applications, thin film technology is also closely tied to nanotechnology, {{which is one of}} the key technologies of the near future. Thin films play a dominant role in modem technology like optoelectronics, microelectronics, etc. Generally thin films have thickness between 0. 1 pm and 30 pm and must be chemically stable, well adherent, well to the surface, uniform, pure, and have low density of imperfections. There are a number of different techniques that facilitate the deposition of stable thin films of oxide materials on a silicon wafer and on other suitable substrates of conducting or insulaters. Common materials include silicon <b>dioxide,</b> <b>tin</b> oxide and transtion metal oxides. Electrochromic materials, especially transtion metal oxides like WO, and MOO,, are able to change their optical properties in a reversible and persistent way under the application of a voltage pulse. These materials are currently of interest for displays, rear-view mirrors and smart windows for energy saving. Because WO, in the best suited material for energy oonservation application, materials properties before and after colouration and its electrochromic mechanism are elaborately given in this review. The enormous flexibility provided by thin film growth technique allows the fabrication of desired geometrical, topographical, physical, crystallographic and metallurgical structures in two or lesser dimensions. These features are increasingly being exploited to tailar make the structure sensitive physical, mechanical, chemical and electrochemical properties of micro materials. All the techniques used to prepare WO, thin films are summarised with an elaborative account on the electrodeposition technique along with our results...|$|R
40|$|Transparent, {{conductive}} oxides (TCOs) applied as coatings find {{multiple applications}} in various {{areas such as}} flat panel display setups, as electrodes in touch-screen panels, electrochromic devices, slar cells and in architectural applications for example as IR reflectors. The favored material {{in the class of}} TCOs is still ITO - Sn-doped In 2 O 3 - due to its unique combination of high transparency and electrical conductivity. Though already very good, the potneital of the ITO coatings with regard to their conductivity leaves some space for future improvements. Also ITO as a material has some serious drawbacks, such as limitied availability and high costs. This work presents some strategies to overcome these obstacles. One way to enhance the conductivities of alternative materials is to use carbon nanotubes as a dopant. This strategy was tested for ATO (Antimony-doped <b>Tin</b> Oxide), Titan <b>dioxide</b> and AZO (Aluminium-doped Zinc oxide). The results for these materials are presented. In coatings of ITO on glass or polymeric foils usually silica-based binders are used. They have the disadvantage to reduce the contact between the highly conducting grains and thus reduce overall conductivity in the composite. The matrix between the nanoparticles can be improved by serveral measures. Experiments with relevance in this direction are discussed. A third strategy aims at the reduction of costs in the process of ITO fabrication. Here one way to go is to use in electrochemical synthesis method. Results of the line of development are presented. Other strategies comprise the suitable processing of materials with a lower intrinsic conductivity or the search for materials with high intrinsic conductivity close to that of ITO. Exmples are presented and discussed...|$|R

This change in resistance is used to calculate the gas concentration. Semiconductor sensors are commonly used to detect hydrogen, oxygen, alcohol vapor, and harmful gases such as carbon monoxide. One of the most common uses for semiconductor sensors is in carbon monoxide sensors. They are also used in breathalyzers.
