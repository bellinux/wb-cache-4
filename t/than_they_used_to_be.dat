2500|$|Four {{years after}} the release of Bringing Down the Horse in 1996, (Breach) was {{released}} on October 10, 2000. [...] The album was met with generally positive critical reception but underwhelming sales. [...] Rolling Stone gave (Breach) four stars, calling the band [...] "more muscular" [...] <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>be.</b> [...] However, the (Breach) commercially floundered in comparison to its high-selling predecessor. [...] The album peaked at No. 13 on the Billboard 200 and took almost a year to receive the Gold certification, which is the highest certification (Breach) has received to date.|$|E
2500|$|In 1968 Travers {{returned}} to playwriting {{with a new}} farce, Corker's End, which was produced at the Yvonne Arnaud Theatre, Guildford. The Times commented, [...] "Some of his jokes, which always tended to be outrageous, are perhaps a little more outspoken <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>be,</b> but nothing essential has changed. Those who care for farce will enjoy themselves for exactly that reason." [...] In 1970 BBC television broadcast seven Travers plays: Rookery Nook, A Cuckoo in the Nest, Turkey Time, A Cup of Kindness, Plunder, Dirty Work and She Follows Me About. At the age of 83 Travers rewrote the plays for the BBC to concentrate on plot twists and verbal misunderstandings, rather than the high-speed action and split-second timing that characterised the original stage versions.|$|E

60|$|One of {{the figures}} {{detached}} itself from the rest and grew clearer. The man wore an old skin coat spattered with flakes of mire, and his long boots were covered with clots of mud.
