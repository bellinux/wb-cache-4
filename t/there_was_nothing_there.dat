5|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} in three parts. First, Anderson recorded the music for Ashen. This was done in a wooden loft {{in the corner of}} the rehearsal space used by Azrael, of whom Anderson was, at the time, a member. Anderson has said that he does not remember how long this recording took him, as he slept there after finishing the work. He described that space as perfect for the recording, as <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>there</b> to distract him.|$|E
25|$|Before {{construction}} {{began in}} Blizna, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>there</b> but uncleared forest. The Nazis used slave labour {{from the nearby}} SS Truppenübungsplatz Heidelager concentration camp in Pustków to build new infrastructure, starting with concrete roads, then a narrow-gauge railway line linking to the station at Kochanówka village. They built barracks, bunkers, buildings and all the specialised equipment needed for the operation and firing of rockets. In addition, {{efforts were made to}} disguise the site as much as possible. They did this by building an artificial village; cottages and barns were made of plywood, lines were hung with clothes and bed-sheets, and imitation people and animals were created using gypsum plaster.|$|E
2500|$|Gaubatz {{said that}} [...] "They even worked {{out how it}} would go. If <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>there,</b> nothing would be said. If the site had been , nothing would be said. But, if it was still there, they would bring the press corps out." [...] After a May 4, 2006 meeting, {{according}} to Gaubatz, he called a reporter at the Washington Times, who called Weldon's office to get confirmation. That inquiry, Gaubatz said, scuttled the project.|$|E

2500|$|Cleutin {{remained}} in Scotland {{after the war}} with England was concluded in 1550. In May he travelled to the border to meet the brother of Mary of Guise, the Marquis de Mayenne, {{who had been a}} hostage for the peace in England. While waiting for the Marquis he visited Dunbar Castle, Fast Castle and Tantallon Castle. D'Oisel wrote to Mary of Guise from Dunglass remarking that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>there</b> except what they brought themselves. The countryside could hardly provide for their horses. [...] D'Oisel, not the Duke of Châtelherault, was left in charge of Scotland when Mary of Guise the Queen Dowager visited France in 1550. He wrote to Mary of Guise asking her to ensure that no impediment was made for food to be shipped to Scotland from France in February 1551 on account of the needs of the town of Edinburgh and the French soldiers because of the pillages and burnings during the war. D'Oisel and Regent Arran travelled to Jedburgh with Camillo Marini, an Italian military engineer to plan new fortifications on the border.|$|E
2500|$|On April 16, 2008, rival mayoral {{candidate}} Leonard Padilla distributed a 2007 {{report of}} similar allegations made against Johnson at St. HOPE Sacramento High School. The allegations were investigated by local police, but no charges were filed. On April 29, 2008, {{a group of}} female civic leaders including former Sacramento Mayor Ann Rudin, Sacramento Municipal Utility District board member Genevieve Shiroma, and former State Senator Deborah Ortiz demanded {{the release of the}} police report on the matter. The teacher to whom the student initially brought the complaint subsequently resigned over the incident, claiming, [...] "St. HOPE sought to intimidate the student through an illegal interrogation and even had the audacity to ask me to change my story." [...] Sacramento Police Chief Rick Braziel responded, saying, [...] "I think the allegations at the school were handled in the way that you would want them handled. Immediately they followed all the normal protocols that they were supposed to follow. I think it was pretty clear <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>there...</b> We did ask the young lady whether anyone had influenced her – her answer was no." [...] The Sacramento County Sheriff John McGinness said on May 30, 2008, that Johnson's actions, though ill-advised, were not illegal.|$|E

6000|$|... "No, I don't {{think that}} <b>is</b> worth while. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>there</b> worth stealing. The natives have {{got plenty of}} fish of their own, no doubt, and drift-wood too. Now let us be off." ...|$|R
50|$|The area on {{the west}} side of Wheatland Center Road and between North and Scottsville-Mumford Roads once held houses and businesses. Today, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>there</b> but scrub land on the eastern side of the former gravel pit.|$|R

6000|$|... “Upon my word,” she said, “there was a {{time that}} they thought I could carry him off, away from them all—beyond them all.

60|$|Sir Thomas, {{when the}} door closed, looked furtively up into his son's face. Might it be that he could read there how much had been already told, or how much still {{remained}} to be disclosed? That Herbert was to learn it all that evening, he knew; {{but it might be}} that Mr. Prendergast had failed to perform his task. Sir Thomas in his heart trusted that he had failed. He looked up furtively into Herbert's face, but at the moment <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>there</b> that he could read. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>there</b> but black misery; and every face round him for many days past had worn that aspect.|$|E

50|$|On October 19, 2006, a cloak was {{produced}} that routed microwaves {{of a particular}} frequency around a copper cylinder {{in a way that}} made them emerge almost as if <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>there.</b> The cloak <b>was</b> made from metamaterials.

6000|$|It {{was what}} sailors call a [...] "dirty night." [...] When you looked out upon the sea, {{it seemed as}} if <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>there</b> but horrible {{darkness}}.

60|$|Both the impostors {{begged him}} to be so kind as to step closer, {{and asked him if}} it were not a {{beautiful}} texture and lovely colours.

60|$|He stole off to Teddy's bath-room, but <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>there,</b> {{and then}} to Teddy's mother's bath-room.

60|$|In the end, with loud protestations that {{he could}} lose like a gentleman, the cook’s last money was staked on the game—and lost. Whereupon he leaned his head {{on his hands and}} wept.

50|$|Travellers and {{tourists}} are regularly befuddled by the highway signs directing them to Seebe {{only to discover}} that it no longer exists. A tourism display at one of the turnoffs describes Seebe in detail, proudly boasting that it is home to the world's smallest single-sheet, artificial ice curling rink. In fact, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>there.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... “No, {{because she}} didn’t,” contradicted Blunt, with an angry frown {{and in an}} {{extremely}} suave voice. “In fact, she bit her tongue.

Neither is my friendship, {{as a matter of}} fact.” ...|$|R
5000|$|In our view, William James {{was right}} about {{evolutionary}} psychology. Making the natural seem strange is unnatural -- it requires the twisted outlook seen, for example, in Gary Larson cartoons. Yet it is a pivotal part of the enterprise.

60|$|When the Interpreter {{had shown}} them this, He has {{them into the}} very best room in the house; a very brave room it was.

6000|$|He {{closed his}} eyes; {{and at once}} he seemed to see Irene, in a dark street below a church--passing, turning her neck so that he caught the gleam of her eyes and her white {{forehead}} under a little dark hat, which had gold spangles on it and a veil hanging down behind.
