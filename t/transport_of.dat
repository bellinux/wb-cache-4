5|$|The first {{proposal}} that the membranes within cells form a single system that exchanges material between its components was by Morré and Mollenhauer in 1974.

The idea of lipid flow through a continuous system of membranes and vesicles was an alternative to the various membranes being independent entities that are formed from <b>transport</b> <b>of</b> free lipid components, such as fatty acids and sterols, through the cytosol. Importantly, the <b>transport</b> <b>of</b> lipids through the cytosol and lipid flow through a continuous endomembrane system are not mutually exclusive processes and both may occur in cells.|$|E

40|$|Development <b>of</b> a <b>{{transport}}</b> complex <b>of</b> {{the region}} and transport servicing {{becomes more and more}} urgent every year and exerts the increasing impact on development of the region in general. In article basic provisions <b>of</b> <b>transport</b> servicing <b>of</b> economy of the region are determined.

The system <b>of</b> <b>transport</b> servicing <b>of</b> the region is considered as set <b>of</b> elements <b>of</b> <b>transport</b> infrastructure through which interaction the needs for cargo transfer and passengers in the region are satisfied. It is the open system having the isolated internal environment and interacting with the external environment. At the same time the internal environment consists of elements between which communication is much stronger, than with the elements constituting the external environment. In market conditions the urgent problem of uncertainty of the external environment influences in turn a condition and development <b>of</b> system <b>of</b> <b>transport</b> servicing <b>of</b> the region, changing external and internal conditions of its functioning.

Features <b>of</b> <b>transport</b> servicing <b>of</b> economy of the region are marked out: need of updating of a property, plant and equipment on <b>transport</b> and development <b>of</b> <b>transport</b> infrastructure; insufficient development of strategic planning <b>of</b> <b>transport</b> as single complex within transport system and in a general context of development of productive forces; the low investment and innovative activity in a motor transportation industry caused by reducing internal and foreign investments, decrease in financing from the government budget.
