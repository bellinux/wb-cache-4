40|$|Abstract. To reduce emissions, CNG {{engines are}} {{commonly}} equipped with <b>three-way</b> <b>catalytic</b> <b>converters.</b> However when the engines run at transient conditions, the {{air fuel ratio}} can not be precisely controlled at theoretical value by traditional means, so the <b>catalytic</b> <b>converters</b> can not achieve their desired effect. This paper presents a new method for CNG engines to control air fuel ratio at transient conditions. The moments which intake and exhaust valves open are used as the trigger signals for ECU to collect the test data simultaneously. The dynamic information of CNG engine is detected by multiple sensors; the nonlinear coupling relationship between air fuel ratio of CNG engine and the operating conditions are established through information fusion and neural network control. The requirement of real time control for air fuel ratio is achieved, so the emissions of CNG engines are reduced further...|$|R
40|$|This report {{documents}} the automotive industry's response to federal regulations of {{light duty vehicle}} tailpipe emissions, {{with the intent of}} identifying lessons learned that might be applicable to future regulation of greenhouse gas emissions. The focus is on 1975 and 1979 - 1981, when new standards took effect that led directly to the adoption of costly new emission control equipment. The costs were significant during those time periods — with almost all automakers installing new oxidation catalyst technology in the first time period and <b>three-way</b> <b>catalytic</b> <b>converters</b> in the second. However, prices of new vehicles did not appear to reflect the full costs of emissions control. Other cost and pricing considerations seemed to be even more important. The added compliance costs associated with emissions reduction were just one more factor used by companies in setting prices. Aggregate new car sales were affected only in a minor way by emissions regulations...|$|R

40|$|The {{working of}} <b>three-way</b> <b>catalytic</b> <b>converters</b> (TWC's) {{is based on}} {{chemical}} reactions whose rates are nonlinear functions of temperature and reactant concentrations all along the device. Unfortunately, the choice of suitable expressions and the tuning of their parameters is particularly difficult in dynamic conditions. In this paper we introduce a hybrid modeling technique which allows us to preserve the most important features of an accurate distributed parameter TWC model, while it circumvents both the structural and the parameter uncertainties of "classical" reaction kinetics models, and saves computational time. In particular, we compute the rates within the TWC dynamic model by a neural network which, thus, becomes a static nonlinear component of a larger dynamic system. A purposely designed genetic algorithm, {{in conjunction with a}} fast ad hoc partial differential equation integration procedure, allows us to train the neural network, embedded in the whole model structure, using currently available measurement data and without computing gradient information...|$|R
30|$|In the end, {{vehicles}} in India emit excessive aerosols because such dirty vehicles are cheap {{to buy and}} operate. Such dirty vehicles are common among poor countries {{and so this is}} not limited to India. Clean technological solutions are available but unfortunately at additional costs. We discuss some technology examples in the next. Compared to gasoline engines, diesel engines have lower CO and HC gas emissions but higher NOx and PM emissions [38]. In gasoline engines tailpipe emissions can be significantly reduced by an efficient use of <b>three-way</b> <b>catalytic</b> <b>converters,</b> but at the expense of fuel economy [39]. In general, the emission control technologies for diesel and gasoline engines can be broadly divided into two groups: in-cylinder control and after-treatment control [40]. Posada et al. [41] give a good review of these emission control technologies. For instance, for diesel emission controls, PM filters are an example of after-treatment tools. Minjares et al. [13] and EPA [31] report that these particle filter devices reduce diesel PM emissions by as much as 85 to 90  % and BC emissions by up to 99  %.|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{reports the}} studies {{on how the}} <b>three-way</b> <b>catalytic</b> <b>converters</b> behave under {{different}} operation conditions. The main focus {{of the work is}} in the oxygen storage capacity of the three-way catalyst. Rich-to-lean air/fuel ratio step-change experiments were carried out to quantify the oxygen storage capacity. Results show that the amount of oxygen stored is dependent on how much oxygen is present in the exhaust. Thus the oxygen storage capacity is not a fixed value, rather it is determined by the equilibrium between the storage sites and the feed stream. A numerical model was developed to characterize the oxygen storage capacity. The model matches well with the experiments. The effects of catalyst age and fuel sulfur content on oxygen storage were measured. The results show that the aging effects and fuel sulfur effects are decoupled. The storage capacity decreases by 10 % for every 150 ppm increase in fuel sulfur, and it scales with (age- 0 84). Different modes of air/fuel ratio modulations were tested on the catalysts, since such modulation is the practice to keep conversion efficiency high and to increas...|$|R

40|$|Using a {{combination}} of density functional theory calculations and statistical mechanics, we show that {{a wide range of}} intermediate compositions of ceria - zirconia solid solutions are thermodynamically metastable with respect to phase separation into Ce-rich and Zr-rich oxides. We estimate that the maximum equilibrium concentration of Zr in CeO 2 at 1373 K is ~ 2 %, and therefore equilibrated samples with higher Zr content are expected to exhibit heterogeneity at the atomic scale. We also demonstrate that {{in the vicinity of the}} (111) surface, cation redistribution at high temperatures will occur with significant Ce enrichment of the surface, which we attribute to the more covalent character of Zr-O bonds compared to Ce-O bonds. Although the kinetic barriers for cation diffusion normally prevent the decomposition/segregation of ceria-zirconia solid solutions in typical catalytic applications, the separation behaviour described here can be expected to occur in modern <b>three-way</b> <b>catalytic</b> <b>converters,</b> where very high temperatures are reached.

40|$|The {{demanding}} {{legislation for}} vehicle emissions pushes {{the automotive industry}} to the commercialization of advanced exhaust systems. The careful design of each aftertreatment device fitted in exhaust line and the interactions with the engine management, makes modelling {{an important part of}} systems engineering for these applications. Almost all <b>catalytic</b> <b>converter</b> models that are found in the literature use tunable parameters which typically address the kinetic terms of chemical reactions. A great effort has been given to the definition of complex reaction schemes and mechanistic description of them in-vitro, in order to assist the advanced design of catalytic washcoats and explain their complex chemistry. This paper presents a systematic effort towards the modelling of advanced commercial exhaust treatment systems, using a unified approach for the different devices. The model used in this work describes the catalytic processes with global reactions, using apparent Arrhenius type rate expressions with L-H kinetics. The model is used to predict transient performance of commercial <b>catalytic</b> <b>converters</b> under legislated test conditions. During these tests the existing uncertainties and intrinsic variations of engine and catalyst operation make the robustness and flexibility of the model prominent targets. Comparison of computed and measured second-by-second emissions demonstrate a high level of modelling accuracy, adequate to fit the behavior of advanced commercial applications of <b>three-way</b> <b>catalytic</b> <b>converters</b> and NOx traps, using a minimum set of 3 tunable parameters for each device.
