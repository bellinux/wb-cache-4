The ATA system, {{which is}} integral to both Conventions, allows the free movement of goods across frontiers and their <b>temporary</b> <b>admission</b> into a customs territory with relief from duties and taxes. The goods are covered by a single document known as the ATA carnet that is secured by an international guarantee system.|$|R
5000|$|In 1961 the World Customs Organization (WCO), {{then known}} as the Customs Cooperation Council (CCC), adopted the Customs Convention on the ATA Carnet for the <b>Temporary</b> <b>Admission</b> of Goods (ATA Convention). More {{specific}} conventions {{for each type of}} applicable good were subsequently worked out and agreed on by the CCC. Today, WCO administers the international conventions. In 1990, the Istanbul Convention was adopted; it combines in one single instrument the various conventions on the <b>temporary</b> <b>admission</b> of goods.|$|R

5|$|Thompson was {{involved}} in a similar suit in Alabama in 2005 on behalf of the families of police personnel killed by Devin Moore, a teenager who was reportedly a compulsive Grand Theft Auto player. The lawyer's participation in the case, however, ran into a dispute over his pro hac vice, or <b>temporary,</b> <b>admission</b> to practice in that state. The opposing attorneys sought removal of the privilege by arguing that Thompson's conduct was unethical and claiming that he had threatened and harassed them in letters and emails. The judge added that Thompson had violated his gag order during Moore’s criminal trial. Thompson tried to withdraw from the case, but his request was denied by the judge, who went ahead and revoked Thompson's <b>temporary</b> <b>admission</b> to the state bar.|$|R

The third group accounted for {{a significant portion of}} no intervention requirement, therefore, the cases in which patients had organ dysfunction such as kidney dysfunction became mostly the target of intervention.|$|R

50|$|The exact numbers {{claiming}} asylum when detected {{were not}} recorded, {{but the numbers}} {{who had to be}} released after detection rather than removed from the UK are available. Between 1994 and 1996 there is shown a rising trend in detection of illegal entrants but the numbers released on <b>Temporary</b> <b>Admission</b> increased steadily. People without legal qualification could function as immigration legal advisors; legal aid was available for immigration cases. Legal aid costs rose dramatically between 1988 and 1992 as did the numbers of applications for judicial review. By 1997 25% of all judicial reviews lodged were related to immigration cases.|$|R
50|$|Upon {{learning}} of the intention to retire him, but before he was in fact retired, Bishop Basil issued letters of canonical release to all the clergy of the Diocese of Sourozh, letters backdated to (or prepared at) the beginning of February. The Moscow Patriarchate rejected the canonical validity of these letters, regarding them {{as an attempt to}} sabotage the diocese. The clergy of the diocese who wished to leave the Moscow Patriarchate with Bishop Basil used these letters, and were granted <b>temporary</b> <b>admission</b> into the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of Thyateira and Great Britain, under the omophorion of Archbishop Gregorios of Thyateira and Great Britain.|$|R
50|$|By 1987 it was {{recognised}} {{that the}} available space was inadequate and an {{attempt was made}} to address this by use of a floating detention vessel, (see above). The failure of the Earl William meant that the numbers of those who had to be released on <b>temporary</b> <b>admission,</b> (immigration bail), grew. The opening of Campsfield House Detention Centre in 1993 provided 200 extra spaces. The expansion led to a more centralised management of the detention estate whereas before the centres had largely been managed by the airports that they served. On 25 May 1995 the total number of people held in immigration detention centres was recorded as 381 with a further 508 being held in prisons under immigration powers.|$|R
5000|$|In 2006, Mr Justice Sullivan of the High Court, in S and Others v Secretary of State for the Home Department, {{ruled that}} it was {{unlawful}} under the 1971 Immigration Act to restrict the men's leave {{to remain in the}} United Kingdom, and ordered that they be granted [...] "discretionary leave to remain", which entitled them to work in the United Kingdom.The Home Secretary, John Reid, challenged the ruling in the Court of Appeal, arguing that the Home Office [...] "should have the power to grant only <b>temporary</b> <b>admission</b> to failed asylum seekers who are only allowed to stay in the UK due to their human rights".

40|$|Some of {{the most}} vexing and {{persistent}} questions in U. S. immigration policy involve whether and how to design programs to admit temporary workers. These questions often prompt disagreement, even among those who otherwise agree on many aspects of immigration law and policy. To address these questions, this Article starts with {{a brief overview of}} <b>temporary</b> worker <b>admissions</b> in U. S. immigration law today, and then summarizes the main points typically made by supporters and skeptics. It next identifies key questions for those who would design temporary worker programs. The main part of the Article then explains how analysis of temporary worker programs generally reflects some combination of four broad perspectives. One perspective evaluates temporary worker programs as a force in the U. S. economy that benefits many citizens and permanent residents but disadvantages others. A second perspective views <b>admission</b> of <b>temporary</b> workers not only in comparison to its traditional foil — admission of permanent residents — but also to immigration outside the law. A third perspective analyzes <b>temporary</b> worker <b>admissions</b> not only as a vital facet of immigration law, but also as essential to international economic development. A fourth perspective assesses <b>temporary</b> <b>admissions</b> in the context not just of immigration law, but also of citizenship, especially by looking at the integration of future generations. Comparing and evaluating these four perspectives can shed light on current debates by broadening and deepening analysis of temporary worker programs. Overall, the broad assessment provided by a balanced combination of these perspectives generally suggests cautious support for temporary worker programs, but only if they are carefully designed and coordinated with initiatives outside of immigration law. ...|$|R

Her lack of English language skills and poor educational level prevented her from enrolling. She returned to Ghana in 2005 to attend memorial services for her dead husband, but upon returning the UK, her student visa had been revoked. She was permitted to return to Wales under <b>temporary</b> <b>admission</b> assuming she adhered to certain conditions.

50|$|Coke ovens {{were charged}} and emptied {{in a set}} pattern. Coal was shovelled into an empty oven to a height of {{approximately}} 0.6 metres and ignited. The door was bricked up or closed with an iron plate and plastered with a small hole left for the <b>temporary</b> <b>admission</b> of air. The upper layer of the coal burnt and initiated the distillation of volatile material from the ovens as they met the air supply drawn in through {{the top of the}} charging door. The dome was heated to a high temperature and assisted in carbonizing the charge by radiating its heat to the coal. The operation of the distillation and immediate combustion proceeded until the whole of the volatile matter in the coal had been evolved, which took about three days. The coke was then cooled by inserting a water sprinkler through the air hole in the door and was withdrawn manually with rakes. Almost two tonnes of coal was required to produce one tonne of coke.|$|R

40|$|Immigration {{policy in}} the United States {{reflects}} multiple goals. First, it serves to reunite families by admitting immigrants who already have family members living in the United States. Second, it seeks to admit workers with specific skills and to fill positions in occupations deemed to be experiencing labor shortages. Third, it attempts to provide a refuge for people who face the risk of political, racial, or religious persecution in their country of origin. Finally, it seeks to ensure diversity by providing admission to people from countries with historically low rates of immigration to the United States. Several categories of permanent and <b>temporary</b> <b>admission</b> have been established to implement those wide-ranging goals. This Congressional Budget Office paper describes who is eligible for the various categories of legal admission and provides the most recent data available {{about the number of}} people admitted under each category.

Generally, practicing law in the state of California without {{being a member of the}} State Bar is the crime of unauthorized practice of law. The only exceptions are for patent attorneys who restrict their practice to the prosecution of patent applications (i.e., the process of obtaining a patent before the United States Patent and Trademark Office); attorneys who practice areas of law exclusively regulated by the federal government (such as immigration) under a U.S. Supreme Court decision in 1963 that prohibited states from restricting the practice of exclusively federal areas of law; and attorneys from other states who have applied to the California courts for <b>temporary</b> <b>admission</b> pro hac vice to work on a single California case in collaboration with a member of the State Bar.|$|R

25|$|On 20 June 2014, the two Chambers of the Swiss Parliament {{passed the}} Total Revision of the Federal Law Concerning the Acquisition and Loss of Swiss Nationality (Révision totale de la loi sur l'acquisition et la perte de la nationalité suisse). The Law, first {{introduced}} in 2011 by the Swiss federal government, aimed to lower, among other requirements, the residency requirement from 12 years to 8 years. During the parliamentary debates {{and the ensuing}} disagreements between the more conservative National Council (lower house) and the more liberal Council of States (upper house), the residency requirements were increased to 10 years. The time spent in Switzerland {{between the ages of}} 8 and 18 is doubled for purposes of applying for naturalisation, however, an applicant must spend at least 6 years in Switzerland. The new law also requires cantons to set a minimum residency requirement of between 2 and 5 years, as well as requiring applicants to have a permanent residency permit (Autorisation d'établissement), which is known as a C permit. Additionally, time spent in Switzerland with <b>temporary</b> <b>admission</b> (Permis d'admission provisoire) halved for purposes of applying for naturalisation.
