40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation was}} conducted to study the effect of various parameters on <b>the</b> <b>cornering</b> forces produced by a rolling aircraft tire installed on a tilted, free-swiveling nose gear. The parameters studied included tilt angle, trial, tire inflation pressure, rake angle, vertical load, {{and whether or not}} a twin tire configuration corotates. These parameters were evaluated by measuring <b>the</b> <b>cornering</b> force produced by an aircraft tire installed on the nose gear of a modified vehicle as it was towed slowly. Cornering force coefficient increased with increasing tilt angle. Increasing trial or rake angle decreased the magnitude of <b>the</b> <b>cornering</b> force coefficient. Tire inflation pressure had no effect on <b>the</b> <b>cornering</b> force coefficient. Increasing vertical load decreased <b>the</b> <b>cornering</b> force coefficient. When the tires of a twin tire system rotated independently, <b>the</b> <b>cornering</b> force coefficients were the same as those for the single-tire configuration. When the twin tire system was made to corotate, however, <b>the</b> <b>cornering</b> force coefficients increased significantly...|$|R
