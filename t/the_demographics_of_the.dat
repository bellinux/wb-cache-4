5|$|As <b>the</b> <b>demographics</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{readership}} broadened, {{it became}} possible to include characters {{who were more}} or less undisguised homosexuals, but these, in accordance with the attitudes of the times, tended to be villains: evil, demented, or effeminate stereotypes. The most popular role for the homosexual was as a 'decadent slaveholding lordling' whose corrupt tyranny was doomed to be overthrown by the young male heterosexual hero. During this period, lesbians were almost entirely unrepresented as either heroes or villains.|$|E

5|$|The {{development}} of heavy industry attracted thousands of European {{immigrants in the}} late 19th and early 20th centuries, as well as internal migrants, both black and white, from the rural and small town South.

After World War II, industrial restructuring and the shifts in heavy industry resulted in Indiana's {{becoming part of the}} Rust Belt.|$|E
5|$|During {{their next}} {{expedition}} in 943, the Rus' captured Bardha'a, {{the capital of}} Arran, in the modern-day Republic of Azerbaijan. The Rus' stayed there for several months, killing many inhabitants {{of the city and}} amassing substantial plunder. It was only an outbreak of dysentery among the Rus' that forced them to depart with their spoils. Sviatoslav, prince of Kiev, commanded the next attack, which destroyed the Khazar state in 965. Sviatoslav's campaign established the Rus's hold on the north-south trade routes, helping to alter <b>the</b> <b>demographics</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> region.
