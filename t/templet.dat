2500|$|Jupiter's {{most ancient}} attested forms of cult {{belong to the}} State cult: these include the mount cult (see section above note n. 22). [...] In Rome this cult entailed the {{existence}} of particular sanctuaries {{the most important of}} which were located on Mons Capitolinus (earlier Tarpeius). The mount had two tops that were both destined to the discharge of acts of cult related to Jupiter. The northern and higher top was the arx and on it was located the observation place of the augurs (auguraculum) and to it headed the monthly procession of the sacra Idulia. On the southern top was to be found the most ancient sanctuary of the god: the shrine of [...] Iuppiter Feretrius allegedly built by Romulus, restored by Augustus. The god here had no image and was represented by the sacred flintstone (silex). The most ancient known rites, those of the spolia opima and of the fetials which connect Jupiter with Mars and Quirinus are dedicated to Iuppiter Feretrius or Iuppiter Lapis. The concept of the sky god was already overlapped with the ethical and political domain since this early time. According to Wissowa and Dumézil Iuppiter Lapis seems to be inseparable from Iuppiter Feretrius in whose tiny <b>templet</b> on the Capitol the stone was lodged.|$|E

[...] "It is hardly right {{to state that}} fifty miles an hour 'is the limit of our speed for land travel, so far as {{existing}} conditions go.' As far as English traffic is concerned, the statement is approximately correct. In the United States, however, there are several trains running now which average over considerable distances more than sixty miles an hour, stoppages included, nor is there much reason why {{this should not be}} considerably increased. What especially hampers the development of railways in England--as compared with other countries--is the fact that the rolling-stock <b>templet</b> is too small. Hence carriages in England have to be narrower and lower than carriages in the United States, although both run on the same standard gauge (4 feet 8½ inches). The result is that several things which you describe as not possible at present, such as to 'write smoothly and easily at a steady table, read papers, have one's hair cut, and dine in comfort,' are not only feasible, but actually attained on some of the good American trains. For instance, on the present Empire State Express, running between New York and Buffalo, or on the present Pennsylvania, Limited, running between New York and Chicago, and on others. With the Pennsylvania, Limited, travel stenographers and typewriters, whose services are placed at the disposal of passengers free of charge. But the train on which there is the least vibration of any is probably the new Empire State Express, and on this it is certainly possible to write smoothly and easily at a steady table." ...|$|E

The teachers were provided with quality instructional materials including two haiku poems, a listening map, and an excerpt of Saint-Sa??ns Aquarium. In addition, an instructional DVD illustrating a guided improvisation of a creative dance was provided. Data sources included videotapes of three interdisciplinary dance and literacy lessons, audio recordings of post-lesson teacher interviews, and written lesson plan <b>templets.</b> Videotaped data was transcribed, and teacher learning tasks were identified and coded using a task presentation coding system. The students??? movement responses were coded using a scoring rubric and a qualitative content analysis was conducted on the transcribed post-lesson teacher interviews and lesson plan <b>templets.</b> Findings revealed five themes: (1) The instructional materials, particularly the DVD, contributed to teacher confidence in their understanding of structured improvisation in creative dance; (2) Each of the teachers identified similar dance concepts as viewed on the DVD, specifically changes in levels, use of smooth/fluid dynamics, and mirror and shadow partner relationships; (3) The classroom teachers used the teaching materials, particularly the music and haiku poems, to access their students??? prior knowledge; (4) The classroom teachers used scaffolded instructions, open-ended tasks, and task constraints as strategies to elicit diverse student movement responses. These strategies are identified in the research on creative dance instruction in schools; and (5) Student movement responses varied in the level of competency in four components: musicality, spatial awareness, movement clarity, and integration of poetry themes...|$|R

The result shows that the particle size and interparticle gap of Ag nanoparticles can be effectively manipulated by AAO <b>templets</b> to enhance the SERS sensitivity. From the literatures [25 – 29], the EF of the Ag-based SERS substrate is in {{the broad range of}} 102 ~ 109, which depends on the density and layers of Ag nanoparticles, molecule adsorbability on the SERS substrate, and the parameter setting of Raman spectroscopy (e.g., different wavelengths of the laser). In other words, the higher EF would induce the poorer reproducibility. For the one layer of Ag nanoparticles system, our SERS substrate exhibits enough enhancement factor (> 108) with great reproducibility (~ 10 %) from substrate to substrate.|$|R

40|$|I {{examined}} {{variability in}} the abundances of functional groups, functional diversity measures, and functional structure of littoral macroinvertebrate communities {{in relation to the}} environmental features of boreal lakes. The most important environmental variables shaping variation in the abundances of functional groups and functional structure were lake surface area, macrophyte cover, total phosphorous, and water hardness. The same environmental variables (i. e., lake surface area, macrophyte cover) accounted for variability in functional richness and functional diversity, while functional evenness was related to different environmental variables (i. e., hardness, color). Lake surface area and macrophyte cover comprised the most important axes of habitat <b>templets</b> shaping the functional trait structure and biodiversity in boreal lakes: lake area mirrors habitat differences between smaller and larger lakes, and macrophyte cover portrays the effects of habitat structural complexity on functional biodiversity. Functional biodiversity measures were also strongly correlated to species-level measures, and the correlation between similarity in functional and taxonomic structure was strong. Functional and taxonomic measures of macroinvertebrate communities thus provide rather similar information about littoral communities and ecosystem functioning. Ecological communities can be characterized followin...|$|R

40|$|In this study, the {{templating}} role of bimolecular triple hydrogen bonded honeycomb network consisting perylene- 3, 4, 9, 10 -tetracarboxydi-imide and melamine is investigated, using scanning tunneling microscopy. Although {{the stability}} of the network upon modification is a major obstacle toward higher complexity, three different approaches in this work highlight formation of successful architectures in a sequential way. 1. Insertion of pore modifier star shaped molecules based on tri(phenylene ethynylene) benzene core in the pores to construct a new template. 2. Insertion of iodinated molecules in the pores to study the network as a nanoreactor. 3. Electrochemical deposition of metals in the pores. Self-assembly monolayer of four different molecules based on tri(phenylene ethynylene) benzene core on uniform gold surface revealed different structures. The degree of the order within the structures depends highly on the symmetry of the molecules, and hence asymmetric molecule formed disordered structure. Upon insertion into the pores of the network, one of molecules did not match the pores size, while others fitted and illustrated rotation depending on the strength of their interaction with the network components and the substrate. The rotation is significantly reduced by modifying the molecules. These new architectures are used as <b>templets</b> hosting C₆₀ molecules which resulted in isolated single C₆₀ molecules. Self-assembly of iodinated molecule under different conditions on uniform gold surface leads to formation of different structures including monomers and dimers. Upon thermal treatment on the uniform surface oligomers are formed, whereas for the molecules confined in the pores of the network, the covalent bond formation was limited to dimerisation. Electrochemical copper deposition into the pores of the network under acidic condition (pH = 1 - 2) is not possible because of {{the stability of}} the network. However, by increasing pH of the electrolyte (pH = 5 – 7), a bilayer of Cu and anion is formed in the pores of the network, confirmed by scanning tunneling microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy...|$|R
