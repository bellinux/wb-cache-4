40|$|It was a brisk fall day in Boston—the type of {{day that}} Dr. William Castle {{preferred}} {{to start with}} a cup of coffee while he caught up on his correspondence, which often appeared to be an endless task. As a faculty member of Harvard Medical School, he had always received a fair amount of inquiries, but after he had published his data indicating that pernicious anemia was due to a vitamin B 12 deficiency, the amount of mail he received was sometimes overwhelming. Sitting in his reclining chair he sorted through the large pile that had accumulated. He began to meticulously segregate it into smaller piles he would open in a prescribed order. Usually the delegation of a particular envelope was a relatively easy choice. There were a few that caused him to pause for a moment, such as the one he was currently holding. The return address indicated it was from an Irving Sherman at Johns Hopkins University. Since it was from someone he had never heard of, he was inclined to place it in the pile to be opened later. But on this day he decided to <b>take</b> <b>another</b> <b>sip</b> <b>of</b> coffee and see what Mr. Sherman had to say (see next page). * Disclaimer: This case is a work of fiction that refers to real events and people. All of the discoveries mentioned in Section 1 were made by the individuals they are attributed to, as were the observations made by Dr. Vernon Hahn described in Section 2.

60|$|So saying, Aunt Keziah <b>took</b> yet <b>another</b> <b>sip</b> <b>of</b> {{the beloved}} liquid, after vainly {{pressing}} Septimius {{to do the}} like; and then lighting her old clay pipe, she {{sat down in the}} chimney-corner, meditating, dreaming, muttering pious prayers and ejaculations, and sometimes looking up the wide flue of the chimney, with thoughts, perhaps, how delightful it must have been to fly up there, in old times, on excursions by midnight into the forest, where was the Black Man, and the Puritan deacons and ladies, and those wild Indian ancestors of hers; and where the wildness of the forest was so grim and delightful, and so unlike the common-placeness in which she spent her life. For thus did the savage strain of the woman, mixed up as it was with the other weird and religious parts of her composition, sometimes snatch her back into barbarian life and its instincts; and in Septimius, though further diluted, and modified likewise by higher cultivation, there was the same tendency.|$|R
60|$|The Eminent Authority <b>took</b> <b>another</b> <b>sip</b> at his tea, {{and looked}} round at us through his spectacles.|$|R
60|$|This {{unexpected}} deviation into sense {{increased the}} general feeling of discomfort. It became {{necessary to take}} the old man seriously, to regard him as a human being. Up till then he had been {{no more than an}} object of curiosity, a mummy in an absurd suit of evening-clothes with a green ribbon across the shirt front. People could not help wishing that they had subscribed a little more. Fifty-eight pounds ten it wasn't enormous. But happily for the peace of mind of the company, Mr. Tillotson paused again, <b>took</b> <b>another</b> <b>sip</b> <b>of</b> wine, and began {{to live up to his}} proper character by talking absurdly.|$|E
60|$|Liza <b>took</b> <b>another</b> <b>sip,</b> a {{slightly}} longer one; it burnt {{as it went}} down her throat, and sent through her a feeling of comfortable warmth.|$|R
60|$|That {{seemed to}} please the {{creature}} and it began walking around the cavern, making its way easily up the slope. While it was gone, Trot and Cap'n Bill each <b>took</b> <b>another</b> <b>sip</b> from the water-flask, to wash down their breakfast.|$|R
60|$|The Colonel {{slightly}} {{lifted his}} shoulders, fortified himself with <b>another</b> <b>sip</b> <b>of</b> the julep, and, leaning back, oratorically began to read,--the stranger leaning {{over him and}} following line by line with shining eyes.|$|R
60|$|The bluff doctor {{put on his}} spectacles, {{and looked}} over the slip of yellow and worn paper scrutinizingly, puffing tobacco-smoke upon it in great volumes, as if thereby to make its hidden purport come out; he mumbled to himself, he <b>took</b> <b>another</b> <b>sip</b> from his flask; and then, putting {{it down on the}} table, {{appeared}} to meditate.|$|R
60|$|He {{paused for}} breath, {{and she gave}} him <b>another</b> small <b>sip</b> <b>of</b> the brandy.|$|R
60|$|On examination, Ned found, to {{his great}} relief; that his friend's hurts were slight.

But he firmly resisted his companion's entreaty to leave the cavern.|$|R
6000|$|Jack waited. The fiery grip of {{the brandy}} relaxed; the genial warmth of it was wafted through him persuasively from head to foot. He <b>took</b> <b>another</b> <b>sip.</b> His eyes began to glitter. [...] "What divine being made this?" [...] he asked. Without waiting to be answered, he tried it again, and emptied the cup. [...] "More!" [...] he cried. [...] "I never felt so big, I never felt so strong, I never felt so clever, as I feel now!" ...|$|R
60|$|The sudden {{pause in}} the {{conversation}} appeared to startle Mr. Bashwood. He comforted himself with <b>another</b> little <b>sip</b> <b>of</b> wine, and, leaving the letter untouched, burst irrepressibly into words, as if the silence was quite unendurable to him.|$|R

'I have no {{hesitation}} in saying,' said Mr. Chillip, fortifying himself with <b>another</b> <b>sip</b> <b>of</b> negus, 'between you and me, sir, {{that her mother}} died of it--or that tyranny, gloom, and worry have made Mrs. Murdstone nearly imbecile. She was a lively young woman, sir, before marriage, and their gloom and austerity destroyed her. They go about with her, now, more like her keepers than her husband and sister-in-law. That was Mrs. Chillip's remark to me, only last week. And I assure you, sir, the ladies are great observers. Mrs. Chillip herself is a great observer!' ...|$|R

5000|$|Poe has an alcohol-induced {{hallucination}} that recreates {{his poem}} (and the film's namesake) [...] "The Raven". As Poe sits alone, {{he hears a}} tapping at the chamber door.

As Poe stumbles outside, the word [...] "wine" [...] appearing on a rock he braces himself against, he sees a ghost.

After <b>another</b> <b>sip</b> <b>of</b> rum he went on: [...] "But who are you, young sir, if that is not an impertinent question? Do you possess money, influence, powerful friends, that you take upon yourself the care of this woman?

After all, Connie, these troubles which have tried us so severely have only proved blessings in disguise. Yes, Fan, we have been driven hither and thither about the sea, encountering terrible storms, and sometimes fearing that our bark was about to founder; but they have at last driven us into a haven more sweet and restful than storm-tossed mariners ever entered before. And looking back we can even feel grateful to the furious wind, and the hateful dark blue wave that brought us to such a goal." ...|$|R
60|$|So saying, {{he began}} slowly and painfully, but with unyielding perseverance, to push, and draw, and hitch himself, while lying at full length, towards the spring, which he reached at last so exhausted, {{that he had}} barely put his lips to it and {{swallowed}} a mouthful, when his head dropped, and he almost fainted. He was within an ace of being drowned, but with a violent effort he drew his face out of the spring, and lay there in a half unconscious condition for some time, with the clear cool water playing about his temples. Reviving in a little time, he <b>took</b> <b>another</b> <b>sip,</b> and then crawled back to his couch. Immediately he fell into a profound slumber, from which Cuffy strove in vain to awaken him; therefore, like a sagacious dog, he lay down at his master's side and joined him in repose.|$|R
6000|$|Kipps made a {{confused}} reply {{that took the}} form of not minding if he did, and drank <b>another</b> <b>sip</b> <b>of</b> old Methusaleh in his confusion.

It was as though the old gentleman was brandishing a burning torch through his vitals, lighting him here and lighting him there until at last his whole being was in a glow. Chitterlow produced a tobacco pouch and cigarette papers and with an interesting parenthesis that was a little difficult to follow about some lady named Kitty something or other who had taught him the art when he was as yet only what you might call a nice boy, made Kipps a cigarette, and with a consideration that won Kipps' gratitude suggested that after all he might find a little soda water an improvement with the whiskey. [...] "Some people like it that way," [...] said Chitterlow, and then with voluminous emphasis, [...] "I don't." ...|$|R
5000|$|On July 20, Markle tricked a {{desk clerk}} at the Homewood Suites in Lexington, Kentucky into {{drinking}} another person’s urine. The prank started with a call to a guest. The guest was told it was the front desk calling and that a prior guest had tested positive for Hepatitis C. The guest was then told there was a doctor on site and a simple urine test could determine if the guest was infected. The urine was {{to be brought to}} the front desk in a simple drinking glass. Switching roles, Markle then called the front desk alleging to be an employee of Martinelli's Cider. He told the clerk that a representative from the company would like to come downstairs with a sample of their new drink. The guest from the previous call then arrived and handed the clerk his urine. Markle then coaxed the woman to try it. He asked how it tasted. [...] "Horrible," [...] she said. [...] "That does not taste like cider. I'm not going to <b>take</b> <b>another</b> <b>sip,</b> that's horrible." [...] Markle replied: [...] "Well, I need to inform you of something, ma'am. I want you to understand that you just drank that man's urine." [...] In its investigation, the Lufkin Police Department's cyber crimes division requested a subpoena for Markle's Skype activities. The police report classifies the Lexington incident as first-degree wanton endangerment, a Class D felony in Kentucky. [...] Markle was subsequently sentenced to a shock incarceration term of six months.|$|R

40|$|Les Cousins (1959, F) by Claude Chabrol Main Cast: Gérard Blain; Jean-Claude Brialy Company: Ajym Films The film {{tells the}} story of Charles from the {{countryside}} who comes to Paris to study. He shares apartment with his cousin Paul, who is partying all the time. Scene: alcohol male adults wine or champagne nontransgressive in company 2 : 29 : 00 - 2 : 29 : 35 : alcohol This scene shows one of the party’s guests. He wakes up in the morning, stands up from the floor, corrects his tie and gets <b>another</b> <b>sip</b> out <b>of</b> the champagne bottle. Discussion: This scene is in a certain way a kind of funny or grotesque. A person gets up from the floor (I think everybody can imagine how one feels after a night on the floor) and the first thing is to correct the tie; the second step the alcohol. If there would not be daylight in the room, that could also have happened the night before. Anyway the tendency will be more towards a negative perception. Clip: 38 (Addictions 4...|$|R

50|$|Appearing in The Lord of the Rings, miruvor is a {{warm and}} {{fragrant}} clear cordial of the Elves, also translated as mead by Tolkien in Namárië. It gives the drinker renewed strength and vitality. Miruvor {{is used by the}} Elves at their festivals. They do not reveal how miruvor was made, but it is thought to come from the honey of the undying flowers in the gardens of Yavanna. Elrond gives a flask of miruvor to Gandalf when the Fellowship embarked on their quest. During the snowstorm on Caradhras, Gandalf gave each of the companions a <b>sip</b> <b>of</b> the cordial to revive their frozen and tired limbs. He gave them <b>another</b> <b>sip</b> when they stopped to rest, and a third sip when they first entered the Mines of Moria. At that point, the precious liquid had almost run out.|$|R

50|$|<b>Another</b> area <b>of</b> <b>SIP</b> {{that has}} {{received}} some criticism relates to its testability. Walther has been a self-reflective critic of his own theory. First, Walther acknowledges that SIP has not fully acknowledged nor clarified {{the role of the}} issue of time in CMC relationships. Second, in discussing the hyperpersonal perspective, Walther admits that not all of the theoretical components of his hyperpersonal approach have been researched sufficiently. Third, in examining the warranting hypothesis, Walther, Brandon Van Der Heide, Lauren Hamel, & Hillary Shulman accept the fact that high warranting value may exist on those matters that have strong social desirability. For example, physical attractiveness is a highly desirable trait in the United States, making it socially desirable. So, as Walther accepts, online communicators would seek corroboration for those qualities that society deems important or desirable. Whether or not other less socially desirable qualities are prone to warranting overtures is not fully explained.|$|R
6000|$|Foster's {{first impulse}} was to spit out the sip he had taken, for to his {{surprise}} the coffee was thick with grounds. He swallowed it, however, and wondered. Then, on taking <b>another</b> <b>sip</b> and considering it, he perceived that the grounds were not as grounds {{to which he had}} been accustomed, but were reduced--no doubt by severe pounding--to a pasty condition, which made the beverage resemble chocolate. [...] "Coffee-soup! with sugar--but no milk!" [...] he muttered, as he tried <b>another</b> <b>sip.</b> This third one convinced him that the ideas of Arabs regarding coffee did not coincide with those of Englishmen, so he finished the cup at the fourth sip, much as he would have taken a dose of physic, and thereafter amused himself with contemplating the other coffee-sippers.|$|R
