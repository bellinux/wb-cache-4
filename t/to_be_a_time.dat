5|$|The game {{opens in}} 3 AF, as the Pulse town Serah lives in is {{attacked}} by monsters. A stranger named Noel appears {{to help fight}} the monsters and claims <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> traveler from 700 AF. He arrived in her time via Valhalla, where {{he claims to have}} met Lightning as she guarded the throne of the weakened Etro. As part of Lightning's transfer to Valhalla, she was erased from the fall of Cocoon onwards (making everyone except Serah forget her being with them on Gran Pulse), and paradoxes have erupted throughout time, warping the timeline. Serah joins Noel in a journey to resolve these paradoxes by removing items and monsters, which are out of their original time and correct the timeline; she in hopes of finding her sister and he in hopes of changing the bleak future he comes from. While journeying to 5 AF to resolve a paradox on Cocoon, they meet and help Alyssa, an Academy member and survivor of the Purge, a massacre by the Sanctum at the beginning of Final Fantasy XIII.|$|E

25|$|In Denmark and Norway, the day {{is known}} as Fastelavn and is marked by eating fastelavnsboller. Fastelavn is the name for Carnival in Denmark which is either the Sunday or Monday before Ash Wednesday. Fastelavn {{developed}} from the Roman Catholic tradition of celebrating {{in the days before}} Lent, but after Denmark became a Protestant nation, the holiday became less specifically religious. This holiday occurs seven weeks before Easter Sunday, with children dressing up in costumes and gathering treats for the Fastelavn feast. The holiday is generally considered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> for children's fun and family games.|$|E
25|$|The Doctor {{initially}} dismisses Jenny as {{an echo of}} what {{it means}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>Time</b> Lord, but as they spend more time together he begins to accept her. The Doctor confides privately to Donna that he is resistant to Jenny coming with them in the TARDIS because she reminds him too much of Gallifrey and everything he lost in the Time War. Donna also becomes intrigued by a series of numbered plaques that she notices in each room. When they reach the location of the Source, {{it turns out to be}} a terraforming device within a colonising spaceship. Donna realises that the plaques represent the dates each part of the building was completed, which was a mere seven days previous. The humans and Hath have bred so many generations through the progenation machines that their own history has degraded into myth. The original cause of the conflict is determined by the Doctor to have been the death of the mission commander.|$|E
500|$|The 1970s and 1980s {{continued}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> {{of growth}} and renewal. New business and nursing classroom buildings and an art center were opened. In 1984, the Immaculate Conception Seminary returned to Seton Hall, its original home until 1926, when it moved to Darlington (a section of Mahwah centered on a grand mansion and estate). The Recreation Center was dedicated in 1987. With the construction of four new residence halls between 1986 and 1988, and the purchase of an off-campus apartment building in 1990, the University made significant changes to account for {{a larger number of}} student residents. Seton Hall is recognized as a residential campus, providing living space for about 2100 students.|$|E

500|$|While {{the neighbors}} are {{watching}} the Oscars at the Griffins' house, Mort needs {{to use the bathroom}} so desperately that he runs into what he thinks is a portable toilet in Stewie's room. The [...] "toilet" [...] turns out <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> machine, and Mort is sent to the past. Realizing that Mort does not have a return pad that would be able to bring him back to the present, Stewie and Brian take one of the return pads and go back in time to save Mort. They end up in Warsaw, Poland and find Mort in a synagogue. He believes he is in Heaven as he sees dead family members there. It does not take long for them to realize that the date is September 1, 1939, the day of the Nazi invasion of Poland and when World War II started.|$|E
500|$|Most of {{the vocal}} {{sessions}} {{took place in}} Paris, whereas the rhythm sections were recorded in the United States. The album incorporates a variety of accompanying performances including a horn section, woodwind instruments, a string orchestra and choir. Orchestral parts in particular were recorded for almost every track, but were only included on a few songs in the final product. The use of such performers and places came at great monetary expense, as noted by Bangalter: [...] "There used <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> where people that had means to experiment would do it, you know? That's what this record is about." [...] He estimated a cost of over one million dollars, but felt that the number was not important. Bangalter stated that the sessions were financed by Daft Punk themselves, which allowed them the luxury of abandoning the project if they had so wished. He also specified that [...] "there are songs on the album that traveled into five studios over {{two and a half}} years." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{treasures of}} the temple are {{considered}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> capsule of Buddhist art from the sixth and seventh century. [...] Much of the frescoes, statues, and other pieces of art within the temple, {{as well as the}} architecture {{of the temple}}'s buildings themselves show the strong cultural influence from China, Korea and India and demonstrated the international connection of the countries of East Asia. It is speculated that all these influences came from Baekje, since Baekje sent out court authorities to look for Japan's local administration.|$|E

2500|$|Historic Adventists look favorably on a past {{era of the}} church. Phil Dunham, {{a fairly}} {{conservative}} author himself, critiqued [...] "nostalgia about {{the good old days}} of 'historic Adventism.' In some people's minds it seems <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> of the most unblemished and unassailable doctrinal positions, the highest possible moral standards, the deepest spiritual maturity, the best snowlike purity, the utmost in readiness to be translated. But the way we often use the expression 'historic Seventh-day Adventism' is built on an idealized and unrealistic notion of what our early church was really like." ...|$|E
2500|$|The [...] 7th century {{can be said}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> of {{maturity}} for Korean [...] Buddhist sculptures because of the fine statuettes that have been [...] discovered and preserved. [...] As discussed above, standing bodhisattva [...] images from the 6th century generally follow the Northern and Eastern [...] Wei stylistic traditions such as the long crossed scarves and the [...] swooping scalloped curves of the robes {{to the sides of}} images. [...] During [...] {{the second half of the}} 6th century, northern China was ruled by the Northern Qi [...] and then the Northern Zhou [...] until the Sui Dynasty [...] successfully ended the Southern and Northern Dynasties [...] period in 581. [...] The styles of these three regimes can be seen in [...] contemporaneous Korean sculpture and were influential in Korean [...] sculpture of the 7th century as well.|$|E
2500|$|In Mawdryn Undead, it {{is first}} stated that a Time Lord can {{transfer}} his regenerative life essence to another being. In that story, the Fifth Doctor is coerced by Mawdryn {{to give up}} his future regenerations in order to cure Nyssa and Tegan Jovanka from Mawdryn's disease. Although the transfer does not occur (due to the timely interference of Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart), the Doctor states that the consequence of the transference would be that he would sacrifice his eight remaining lives and cease <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>Time</b> Lord. It is not until [...] "Let's Kill Hitler" [...] that a similar transference is shown; in that instance, River Song sacrifices her own regenerative power in order to revive the dead Eleventh Doctor. The favour is returned in [...] "The Angels Take Manhattan" [...] in which River's wrist is repaired by the Doctor, who subsequently gives up a portion of his regenerative energy.|$|E

60|$|Now {{that the}} prophetic Angel passes {{in this manner}} from the four kingdoms of the Greeks to the Romans reigning over the Greeks, is {{confirmed}} from hence, {{that in the next}} place he describes the affairs of the Christians unto the time of the end, in these words: [12] And they that understand among the people shall instruct many, yet they shall fall by the sword and by flame, by captivity and by spoil many days. Now when they shall fall they shall be holpen with a little help, viz. in the reign of Constantine the great; but many shall cleave to them with dissimulation. And some of them of understanding there shall fall to try them, and to purge them from the dissemblers; and to make them white even to the time of the end. And a little after, the time of the end is said <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>time,</b> times, and half a time: which is the duration of the reign of the last horn of Daniel's fourth Beast, and of the Woman and her Beast in the Apocalyps.|$|E
