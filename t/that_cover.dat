5|$|August 7–9, 1993 - Tropical Storm Bret {{moves across}} {{northern}} Venezuela and Colombia. In Venezuela, the storm drops at least 13.35inches (339mm) in Guanare.

5|$|Most archaea (but not Thermoplasma and Ferroplasma) {{possess a}} cell wall. In most archaea {{the wall is}} {{assembled}} from surface-layer proteins, which form an S-layer. An S-layer is a rigid array of protein molecules <b>that</b> <b>cover</b> {{the outside of the}} cell (like chain mail). This layer provides both chemical and physical protection, and can prevent macromolecules from contacting the cell membrane. Unlike bacteria, archaea lack peptidoglycan in their cell walls. Methanobacteriales do have cell walls containing pseudopeptidoglycan, which resembles eubacterial peptidoglycan in morphology, function, and physical structure, but pseudopeptidoglycan is distinct in chemical structure; it lacks D-amino acids and N-acetylmuramic acid.|$|E

Pumice Valley, {{directly}} to the west, is covered by sagebrush scrubland. The soil consists primarily of deep pumice, which does not hold water well. Mycorrhizal fungi in the soil invade the roots of Jeffrey pine trees in a symbiotic relationship that helps the pine absorb water and provides nutrients to the fungi. Jeffrey pine forests also surround the Inyo Craters and Mammoth Mountain.

5|$|Spathularia flavida may be {{distinguished}} from the velvet-foot fairy fan (Spathulariopsis velutipes) by differences in the stem: S.velutipes is fuzzy and brown rather than smooth and yellowish. The fuzziness {{is a result of}} a thin layer of intertwined hyphae <b>that</b> <b>cover</b> the stem, which project short hyphae outward from the surface. The closely related species S.neesi has an ochre color, spores that measure 60–80 by 1.5–2µm, and paraphyses that are branched on the upper parts. Neolecta irregularis is roughly similar in appearance to S.flavida, but lacks a sharply differentiated, spoon-shaped head, has a stem lighter in color than the head, and microscopically, has much smaller oval to elliptical spores that measure 5.5–8.5 by 3–4µm. Another yellowish earth-tongue fungus, Microglossum rufum, has a well-defined oval to spoon-shaped head, and sausage- to spindle-shaped spores that are 18–38 by 4–6µm.|$|E
