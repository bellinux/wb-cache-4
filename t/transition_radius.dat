40|$|Background: Mixed-symmetry 2 + {{states in}} {{vibrational}} nuclei {{are characterized by}} a sign change between dominant proton and neutron valence-shell components {{with respect to the}} fully symmetric 2 + state. The sign can be measured by a decomposition of proton and neutron <b>transition</b> <b>radii</b> with a combination of inelastic electron and hadron scattering [C. Walz et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 106, 062501 (2011) ]. For the case of 92 Zr, a difference could be experimentally established for the neutron components, while about equal proton <b>transition</b> <b>radii</b> were indicated by the data. Method: Differential cross sections for the excitation of one-phonon 2 + and 3 - states in 92 Zr have been measured with the (e,e') reaction at the S-DALINAC in a momentum transfer range q = 0. 3 - 0. 6 fm^(- 1). Results: Transition strengths B(E 2; 2 +_ 1 -> 0 +_ 1) = 6. 18 (23), B(E 2; 2 +_ 2 -> 0 +_ 1) = 3. 31 (10) and B(E 3; 3 -_ 1 -> 0 +_ 1) = 18. 4 (11) Weisskopf units are determined from a comparison of the experimental cross sections to quasiparticle-phonon model (QPM) calculations. It is shown that a model-independent plane wave Born approximation (PWBA) analysis can fix the ratio of B(E 2) transition strengths to the 2 +_(1, 2) states with a precision of about 1 %. The method furthermore allows to extract their proton <b>transition</b> <b>radii</b> difference. With the present data - 0. 12 (51) fm is obtained. Conclusions: Electron scattering at low momentum transfers can provide information on <b>transition</b> <b>radii</b> differences of one-phonon 2 + states even in heavy nuclei. Proton <b>transition</b> <b>radii</b> for the 2 +_(1, 2) states in 92 Zr are found to be identical within uncertainties.

40|$|In the {{framework}} of this thesis electron scattering experiments on low-energy excitations of 92 Zr and 94 Zr were performed at the S-DALINAC in a momentum transfer range q = 0. 3 − 0. 6 fm^− 1. The nature of one-phonon symmetric and mixed-symmetric 2 + and 3 − states of 92 Zr was investigated by comparison with predictions of the quasi-particle phonon model (QPM). Theoretical (e, e′) cross sections have been calculated within the distorted wave Born approximation(DWBA) to account for Coulomb distortion effects. The reduced strengths of the one-quadrupole phonon states and the one-octupole phonon state have been extracted. The similarity of the momentum-transfer dependence of the form factors between the 2 + states supports the one-phonon nature of the 2 + 2 state of 92 Zr. A new method based on the Plane Wave Born Approximation (PWBA) for a model-independent determination of {{the ratio of the}} E 2 transition strengths of fully symmetric (FSS) and mixed-symmetry (MSS) one-phonon excitations of heavy vibrational nuclei is introduced. Due to the sensitivity of electron scattering to charge distributions, the charge transition-radii difference can be determined. The basic assumptions (independence from the ratio of Coulomb corrections and from absolute values of <b>transition</b> <b>radii)</b> are tested within the Tassie model, which makes no specific assumptions about the structure of the states other than collectivity. It is shown that a PWBA analysis of the form factors, which usually fails for heavy nuclei, can nevertheless be applied in a relative analysis. This is a new promising approach to determine the ground state transition strength of the 2 + MSS of vibrational nuclei with a precision limited only by the experimental information about the B(E 2; 2 + 1 → 0 + 1) strength. The PWBA approach furthermore provides information about differences of the proton <b>transition</b> <b>radii</b> of the respective states, containing independent information about the mixed-symmetry character of 2 + states and the sign change of leading valence shell components between FSS and MSS. For 92 Zr, the proton <b>transition</b> <b>radii</b> difference of the 2 + 1 and 2 + 2 states agree with zero within about 0. 5 fm, consistent with predictions of a sign change of the leading neutron component in the wave function of the mixed-symmetry 2 + 2 state, while the leading proton components remain unchanged. The extracted B(E 2) strength of the transition of the 2 + 2 state of 94 Zr using the new method is smaller than the B(E 2) value of the 2 + 1 state in contrast to a previous but in agreement with a recent (n,n′γ) experiment. The <b>transition</b> <b>radii</b> difference in 94 Zr is − 0. 24 (34) fm compatible with zero.

We show that the two circumstellar disks are better fit by a shallow inner and steep outer power-law than a truncated power-law. The two disks have very different <b>transition</b> <b>radii</b> between their inner and outer regions of ∼ 18. 6 AU and ∼ 8. 9 AU respectively.

Furthermore, the two disks are closely aligned if not parallel with their circumbinary disk. Over an interval of ∼ 10 yr, source B (possessing the circumsecondary disk) has moved northwards with respect to and likely away from source A, indicating an orbital motion {{in the same direction as}} the rotational motion of their circumbinary disk.

40|$|In protoplanetary disks, {{the inner}} radial {{boundary}} between the MRI turbulent (`active') and MRI quiescent (`dead') zones {{plays an important role}} in models of the disk evolution and in some planet formation scenarios. In reality, this boundary is not well-defined: thermal heating from the star in a passive disk yields a <b>transition</b> <b>radius</b> close to the star (< 0. 1 au), whereas if the disk is already MRI active, it can self-consistently maintain the requisite temperatures out to a <b>transition</b> <b>radius</b> of roughly 1 au. Moreover, the interface may not be static; it may be highly fluctuating or else unstable. In this paper, we study a reduced model of the dynamics of the active/dead zone interface that mimics several important aspects of a real disk system.

We comment on the renormalization conditions, {{the preservation of the}} weak equivalence principle and the definition of the neutrino mass radius. We associate the neutrino gravitational form factors with specific angular momentum states. Based on Feynman diagrams, spin-statistics, CP invariance and symmetries of the angular momentum states in the neutrino-graviton vertex, we deduce differences between the Majorana and Dirac cases. It is then proved that in spite of the theoretical differences between the two cases, as far as experiments are considered, they would be virtually indistinguishable for any space-time geometry satisfying the weak field condition.

40|$|Modelling {{gravitational}} collapse in cosmology and astrophysics, this paper examines {{the creation and}} destruction of kinetic theory entropy after a small perturbation is introduced into a homogeneous distribution of Newtonian self-gravitating particles. The focus is on a coarse-grained slice of entropy constructed from the one- and two-particle distribution functions. Asymptotically over time, the slice dominates over all other entropy within the system. The slice's entropy is destroyed inside a central sphere near the initial location of the perturbation (the core) and created in a surrounding shell (the halo). Core-halo <b>transition</b> <b>radii</b> are not fixed, but are proportional to the coarse-graining length used. At leading order, entropy creation and destruction are in balance. At next-to-leading order, destruction predominates, with net entropy destruction being proportional to an exponent of the time elapsed after the perturbation was introduced, and further proportional to {{the square of the}} perturbation size, divided by the square of the coarse-graining volume. In this model, the destruction of asymptotic coarse-grained entropy is at least offset by entropy creation outside the system and distant from the central perturbation. This can be interpreted as follows: {{gravitational collapse}} leads to local large-scale structure formation - that is, destruction of coarse-grained entropy - at least offset by the distant creation of disorder.

The maximal jet power can be extracted from a standard thin accretion disk/spinning black hole is calculated {{as a function of}} dimensionless accretion rate ˙m (˙m = ˙ M / ˙ MEdd). Comparing with the derived jet power, we find that the accretion disks in most BL Lac objects should not be standard accretion disks.

The transition is triggered by the thermal instability of a radiation pressure-supported SSD. The <b>transition</b> <b>radius</b> {{is close to the}} central black hole. We confirm our qualitative prediction by actually constructing global bimodal SSD-ADAF solutions...|$|E
40|$|We present SPH {{simulations}} of accretion discs in orbit about rotating compact {{objects such as}} black holes and neutron stars, and study the structure of warped discs produced by the Bardeen-Petterson effect. We calculate the <b>transition</b> <b>radius</b> out to which the disc specific angular momentum vector is aligned {{with that of the}} black hole. We focus on the parameter regime where the warp dynamics are controlled by bending wave propagation, but also consider models in which warps are subject to diffusion rather than wave transport, and are able to consider the fully nonlinear regime. Because of hydrodynamic or pressure effects, for the parameter range investigated, the <b>transition</b> <b>radius</b> is always found to be much smaller than that obtained by Bardeen & Petterson (1975). For discs with midplane Mach numbers of about 10, the transition occurs between 10 - 16 gravitational radii, whereas for a Mach number of about 30 it occurs at around 30 gravitational radii. A thicker disc with a Mach number of 5 is found to produce no discernible warped structure. The rate of black hole - disc alignment is found to be consistent with the ideas of Ress (1978), with the alignment torque behaving as if it arises from the accreted material transferring its misaligned component of angular momentum at the larger <b>transition</b> <b>radius</b> of Bardeen & Petterson (1975). The inclusion of Einstein precession in the calculations modified both the warped disc structure and, consistent with linear analysis, produced an increased alignment rate by up to a factor of 4 because of the effect that a non Keplerian potential has on the propagation of warps.

40|$|The fatigue {{strength}} under reversed direct stress was ascertained for specimens of various diameters {{in the range}} from 0. 19 inch to 2. 4 inches, the largest diameter being determined by the capacity of the machines available. Two steels were used in this investigation-a 25 -ton mild steel and a 65 -ton, 2 f. per cent nickel-cbromium steel. The specimens were either plain or notched (transverse hole) and, as far as possible, geometrical similarity was preserved with regard to the <b>transition</b> <b>radii</b> and the diameter of the transverse hole. A few fatigue tests on other types of notch, such as a circumferential V-groove and a shoulder, were also carried out. No intrinsic size effect with either material was observed with the plain specimens. With transverse-hole specimens in mild steel, ‘the fatigue limit was * 8. 4 tons per sq. in. for speci-mens of 0. 33 inch diameter, and 6. 1 tons per sq. in. for specimens of 1 - 7 inches diameter, thus showing that an appreciable size effect was present. A similar size effect was found with the alloy steel specimens containing a transverse hole, and fatigue limits of f 17 - 1 and f 13. 9 tons per sq. in. respectively were obtained for these two sizes of specimen. It is suggested that the low values of fatigue-strength reduction factors usually associated with mild steel as a result of laboratory tests do not apply to the larger sections of this material commonly employed in engineering practice...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Because of the {{situation}} that the disc cutter bearing seriously damaged in the cutting process, disc cutter structural parameters is optimized which mainly affect the force on the bearing. The disc cutter cutting edge angle, cutting edge width, <b>transition</b> arc <b>radius</b> and caulking ring width between the bearings are taken as design variables, and the minimum equivalent load on the bearing as the target, the optimization model is established. Genetic Algorithm (GA) {{is used in the}} mathematical model. Finally, the optimized results indicate that the equivalent load on the bearing reduces 21 % compared with the actual structural parameters. So the optimization results effectively reduce the force on the bearing and extend the life cycle of disc cutter...|$|R
