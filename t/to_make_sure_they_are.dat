Banks must identify all the nominal and beneficial owners of any private bank account opened and maintained in the U.S. by non-U.S. citizens.

2500|$|United States – U.S. President Obama and aides {{for former}} Senator Domenici {{publicly}} supported continued {{development of new}} U.S. nuclear power facilities.

A more definitive expression {{of the impact of}} the accidents in the United States was the decision by NRG Energy, Inc. to abandon already started construction on two new nuclear power plants in Texas. Analysts attributed the abandonment of the project to the financial situation of the plant-partner TEPCO, the inability raise other construction financing, the current low cost of electricity in Texas, and expected additional permitting delays.|$|E
2500|$|Typical weekly {{maintenance}} includes changing around 10–20% {{of the water}} while cleaning the gravel, or other substrate if the aquarium has one; however some manage to avoid this entirely by keeping it somewhat self-sufficient. A good habit is to remove the water being replaced by [...] "vacuuming" [...] the gravel with suitable implements, as this will eliminate uneaten foods and other residues that settle on the substrate. In many areas tap water is {{not considered to be}} safe for fish to live in because it contains chemicals that harm the fish. Tap water from those areas must be treated with a suitable water conditioner, such as a product which removes chlorine and chloramine and neutralizes any heavy metals present. The water conditions must be checked both in the tank and in the replacement water, <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> suitable for the species of fish kept.|$|E
