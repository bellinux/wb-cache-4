Taking the rapier loom SAURER 400 as the research object, the original let-off and <b>take-up</b> <b>machine</b> of loom SAURER 400 was analyzed in the article, and the electric let-off and take-up system was designed, and the revs of the let-off input end and the take-up input end were respectively computed, which could provide some references for the alteration of future electric let-off and take-up control system. </p...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Conventional {{models for}} {{mechanical}} rotors based on Automatic Dynamic Analysis of Mechanical Systems (ADAMS) are over-constraint. This paper proposes a new method for simulating the stiffness and damping of bearings using bushing and other kinematic pairs. Analysis and Simulation for balance of rigid rotors by ADAMS were performed. To reduce the imbalance inertial force, the balance {{weight of a}} <b>take-up</b> <b>machine</b> has been optimized. The results were verified by the prototype test. Our results suggest a more effective method for balance of mechanical rotors in the design stage...|$|E
50|$|The rotary hook {{continuously}} rotates in place, hooking {{the upper}} thread each time its pointed tip passes the 12 o'clock position. Enough upper thread is pulled from above to pass around the bobbin case, which sits loosely inside the hook frame such that loops of thread can pass completely over it. The excess thread, no longer needed, is then pulled back upward by the sewing <b>machine's</b> <b>take-up</b> arm.|$|R
40|$|Evaluation of {{the length}} {{distribution}} of needle thread during stitch formation is necessary to determine the dynamic characteristics of a sewing machine, and the thread needed in this process. In this study, physical and mathematical models of the take-up disc are developed. The thread length for the full rotation range is determined as the geometrical distance between the active frictional barriers. The algorithm of calculations is introduced and im-plemented alternatively {{by means of the}} languages Fortran and C++, as well as by genetic algorithms. The length distribution of the needle thread obtained was verified by using simulations of the sequence and geometry of the frictional barriers, as well as experimental research of the purpose-oriented model of the take-up disc prototype.

30|$|In a real {{braiding}} process, {{the natural}} forming point occurs {{somewhere between the}} forming ring and the carriers. This position depends on parameters such as take-up speed, yarn fineness and yarn-to-yarn coefficient of friction. The smaller the take-up speed, the higher the coefficient of friction and the coarser the yarn, the closer the natural forming point will be to the carriers. In the FE model, the yarns were modelled as converging {{to the center of}} the braiding machine and, when the simulation started, they were pulled from the take-up node (Fig.  5 b) in the positive y-direction through the forming ring at a speed equal to the real braiding <b>machine</b> <b>take-up</b> speed υtu. Based on experimental observations, the position of the take-up nodes relative to the carriers was adjusted depending on the take-up speed to be as close as possible to where the braid would form in a real braiding process. Opposite to the take-up nodes, linear elastic springs modelled with discrete elements, were attached to each yarn end to simulate the carrier tensioning springs (0.2 N was the effective pre-tension applied by the springs to the attached yarns). These springs, as in a real carrier, were restrained to move in the y-direction during their movement on the x-z plane, and were used to maintain a uniform tension in the yarns throughout the braiding simulation. The tension of the yarns at the beginning of the virtual braiding process was not uniform among different yarns. This is because of the difference in the yarn length and the relative position of the yarns with respect to the forming point. In order to even out the tension in each yarn before the starting of the braiding process, the springs were pulled in the negative y-direction for two seconds while keeping the uppermost nodes fully constrained. From their initial position, the eyelets and the yarn ends with springs were moved along a prescribed path established by Eq. 10 on the x-z plane. Their velocity was equal to the maximum carriers’ velocity of the braiding machine used for the manufacture of microbraids.|$|R
