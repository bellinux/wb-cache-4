40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the results of a pilot study of {{observations}} of non-compliance behaviour by tourists to a voluntary code of conduct based on marine turtles attempting to nest in the Ningaloo Marine Park, Western Australia. The study used focal-animal sampling to record the response of marine turtles to non-compliance behaviour of <b>tourist</b> <b>groups.</b> Results of observations indicated that 77 % of <b>tourist</b> <b>groups</b> breached the code of conduct, with 51 % of these breaches resulting in a disturbance to marine turtles attempting to nest. The key aspects of the code of conduct that were breached included: shining light on the turtle; being closer than three metres from a turtle; and not staying behind the turtle at all times. The greatest disturbance to marine turtles was from <b>tourists</b> <b>groups</b> shining their torches on the turtles. This work demonstrates the need for further research into disturbance of turtles by tourists and the effectiveness of voluntary codes of conduct...|$|R

50|$|Several {{groups of}} Barbary macaque {{can be found}} in tourist sites, where they are {{affected}} by the presence of visitors providing food to them. Researchers comparing two such groups in the central High Atlas mountains in 2008 found that the <b>tourist</b> <b>group</b> of Barbary macaques spent significantly more time engaged in resting and aggressive behaviour, and foraged and moved significantly less than the wild group. The <b>tourist</b> <b>group</b> spent significantly less time per day feeding on herbs, seeds and acorns than the wild group. Human food accounted for 26% of the daily feeding records for the <b>tourist</b> <b>group,</b> and 1% for the wild-feeding group.Scientists who collected data on the seasonal activity budget and diet composition of the endangered Barbary macaque group inhabiting a tourist site in Morocco found that activity budgets and diet of the study group varied markedly among seasons and habitats. The percentage of daily time spent in foraging and moving was lowest in spring, and the daily time spent in resting was highest in spring and summer. The time budget devoted to aggressive display was highest in spring than the other three seasons. There is an increase in the daily feeding time spent eating flowers and fruits in summer, seeds, acorns, roots and barks in winter and autumn, herbs in spring and summer, and a clear increase in consumption of the human food in spring.The tourist and the wild groups did not differ in the proportion of daily records devoted to terrestrial feeding, but the <b>tourist</b> <b>group</b> spent a significantly lower percentage of daily records in terrestrial foraging, moving and resting, while performing more terrestrial aggressive displays more than the wild group. There {{was no significant difference between}} the two groups in the proportion of terrestrial feeding records spent eating fruits; but the <b>tourist</b> <b>group</b> had lower daily percentages of terrestrial feeding on leaves, seeds and acorns, roots and barks, and herbs, while it spent higher daily percentages of terrestrial feeding on human food.|$|E
