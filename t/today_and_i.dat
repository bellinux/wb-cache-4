500|$|In 2000, Schmirler {{worked as}} colour {{commentator}} for CBC during Canada's national junior curling championships. During her illness, Schmirler {{had been largely}} removed from the public eye. While in Moncton for the championships, Schmirler {{held a press conference}} to update her situation. In speaking publicly about her ordeal for the first time, Schmirler spared few details about what she had gone through, while also expressing her hope for the future: [...] "There were three goals I had coming out of this thing, and the first one was to look after my family. And the second one...because I curl so much, I've never taken a hot vacation, so I'm going to put my feet in the sand in a warm place. And the last one was to actually be here <b>today,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> thank CBC, I thank Lawrence (Kimber), and Joan Mead." ...|$|E

500|$|Editing and {{post-production}} work on Alien took roughly 20 {{weeks to}} complete. Terry Rawlings served as editor, having previously worked with Scott on editing sound for The Duellists. Scott and Rawlings edited {{much of the}} film to have a slow pace to build suspense for the more tense and frightening moments. According to Rawlings: [...] "I think {{the way we did}} get it right was by keeping it slow, funny enough, which is completely different from what they do <b>today.</b> <b>And</b> <b>I</b> think the slowness of it made the moments that you wanted people to be sort of scared...then we could go as fast as we liked because you've sucked people into a corner and then attacked them, so to speak. And I think that's how it worked." [...] The first cut of the film was over three hours long; further editing trimmed the final version to just under two hours.|$|E
500|$|The {{first song}} she wrote was [...] "Objection (Tango)" [...] {{and in an}} {{interview}} with Faze, she revealed that writing songs in English proved to be challenging for her: [...] "I prayed and asked God to send me a good song <b>today,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> remember I started writing the song [...] a couple of hours after. I wrote the music and lyrics at the same time, and when that happens it's really magical to me." [...] After completing [...] "Objection (Tango)", Shakira decided to write ten more songs and began setting up portable recording studios in the rural region of Uruguay. She wrote various songs with a [...] "dictionary {{in one hand and a}} thesaurus in the other." [...] During the songwriting process, Shakira wrote [...] "Underneath Your Clothes" [...] as a love song for de la Rúa. She explained that, [...] "If you check the subject of my songs, most of them talk about my own experiences and feelings and what I was actually going through in my life." ...|$|E
500|$|Martin Singer, an {{attorney}} representing Cosby, {{made a statement}} in which he asserted Dickinson was not being truthful in her account. After Singer's statement, Dickinson reappeared on a subsequent broadcast of Entertainment Tonight to reassert her account from her prior interview on the program. In addition, she publicized photographs she took with a Polaroid camera of Cosby wearing a checkered bathrobe {{in order to support}} her assertions. In the interview with Kevin Frazier she stated her account was the truth: [...] "It is not a lie. It is my right as a woman. I have to speak up {{and you have to be}} able to go in and just be brave and do it for all the women that can't come forward." [...] She explained her motivation for going public and her desire for her voice to be heard: [...] "The loss of innocence that I suffered and that these women suffered is why I'm sitting here <b>today.</b> <b>And</b> <b>I</b> don't care about what Cosby or networks or anybody says, you will hear me." ...|$|E

500|$|Cecotto's driving {{which caused}} the multi-car pileup in the feature race {{received}} much attention. It was third such {{incident in the}} season when Cecotto courted controversy and criticism from drivers: he was disqualified from qualifying for the Sepang round when he forced Bird off the track but avoided being issued with a penalty in the Catalunya sprint race when he swerved into Canamasas during a battle for fifth position. Leimer claimed that Cecotto solely concentrated on him rather than making the corner, [...] "It's really, really disappointing as a lot was possible <b>today</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> could have scored a lot of points. But once more due to another driver I lost out, while my competitors {{in the battle for}} the championship are scoring." [...] Palmer was more vocal in his criticism in Cecotto, remarking he would rather start from the pit lane than within two rows of Cecotto. Peter Allen of Formula Scout argued that while Cecotto's manoeuvre was not clearly malicious in intent, the Venezuelan deserved the race ban and that it would help him realise that he needed to control his aggressiveness.|$|E
500|$|For the album, Shakira wrote all the lyrics, and the {{majority}} of the music. [...] "To start seeing people's first reactions, and how people start relating to these songs and appreciating every single piece of work I have done over the past two years, is the best reward an artist can have after so much hard work," [...] says Shakira. [...] "I will not lie to you; it was not a path of roses. It was painful at times to come up with two albums, to write more than 60 songs and to fight my own insecurities and doubts." [...] While speaking about the difference about expressing herself in Spanish and English, Shakira told, [...] "When I express myself in Spanish, I find elements that help me express an idea in perhaps a different way than when I do it in English. There are different aesthetics, but there is a certain style to the way I write my own songs, a particular way of describing feelings and emotions that I have developed over all these years making songs. I have gotten in touch with my own gift - I am sure, 10 years ago, I was not half as good as I can say I am <b>today,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> am still not good enough. There is a long way to go." ...|$|E
500|$|American singer Gloria Estefan, {{whose husband}} Emilio Estefan was {{managing}} Shakira at that time, felt that Shakira {{had the potential}} to crossover into the mainstream pop industry. However, Shakira was initially hesitant to record songs in English as it was not her first language, so Estefan offered to translate [...] "Ojos Así" [...] into English in order to show her that [...] "it could translate well." [...] Shakira then began translating the song herself and showed it to Estefan, who responded [...] "Quite honestly, I can't do this better!." [...] As Shakira wanted to have full control over her recordings, she decided to learn English better to enable her to write her own songs. Wanting to [...] "find a way to express my ideas and my feelings, my day-to-day stories in English", Shakira bought rhyming dictionaries, started analysing the lyrics of songs by Bob Dylan, reading poetry and the work of authors like Leonard Cohen and Walt Whitman and took English lessons from a private tutor. [...] "Objection (Tango)" [...] became the first song Shakira wrote in English and in an interview with Faze, she talked about the writing process of the song, saying [...] "I prayed and asked God to send me a good song <b>today,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> remember I started writing the song [...] a couple of hours after. I wrote the music and lyrics at the same time, and when that happens it's really magical to me." [...] Shakira also wrote and recorded a Spanish-version of the song entitled [...] "Te Aviso, Te Anuncio (Tango)".|$|E

500|$|Because of his {{aggressive}} style-of-play, Selwood {{has gathered}} {{a reputation as}} a [...] "head–over–the–ball specialist" [...] and for consistently putting himself in positions to break tackles and win free kicks. His ability to [...] "buckle his knees, (get) down and pull his arm up so that the tackler's arm goes up above the neck" [...] has been declared by former Hawthorn captain Shane Crawford as [...] "almost impossible to stop at times" [...] and is reflected in his regular standing among league leaders for total free kicks received. It has also led to opposition players noting specific techniques to tackling Selwood—Carlton’s Kade Simpson admitted it was important to [...] "get in low" [...] because [...] "he’s such a master at lifting the elbows, which tries to slip the tackle up around the neck ... there’s no doubt it’s a skill". Selwood has declared the technique as a [...] "benefit and an advantage I’m getting at the moment on someone else because I see a weakness in what they are doing ... the majority of the time they are doing 95 per cent of the tackle right. It’s just that five per cent where I can use my upper body strength, I can dip at the knees slightly". Former Brisbane Lions captain Michael Voss agrees, stating [...] "all he’s doing is keeping his feet, dropping his legs and he’s got a fantastic tenchique in rolling his shoulder ... Selwood shouldn’t be penalised because he’s stronger than the tackler. If I was playing <b>today</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> could develop that technique, I’d be looking at it".|$|E

2500|$|Due to her {{dissatisfaction with}} Kisss {{constrained}} timeframe of two months, Jepsen went into writing Emotion {{with the intent}} of crafting a project that was authentic and timeless. Whereas Kiss was developed in a acquiescent manner as Jepsen was simply grateful for the opportunity, Emotion was spurred by her desire to take more creative control. Jepsen commented that much of the album is about [...] "trying to get some power back" [...] after a recent break up and subsequent move to New York. She sought to channel a [...] "heart-on-your-sleeve sensibility" [...] reminiscent of the 1980s era after attending a Cyndi Lauper concert in Japan: [...] " [...] this is when pop was at its finest. [...] I would put out 'Girls Just Wanna Have Fun' <b>today</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> wouldn’t change a bloody thing." [...] These themes were further explored through [...] "old-school" [...] Prince and Madonna records on morning runs before Cinderella rehearsals. An epiphany came to Jepsen after finishing [...] "Emotion", the album's title track, where she realized that the 1980s pop sound combined with a more [...] "alternative" [...] production was what she had been seeking. This fashioned the album's direction entirely, which developed as the midway point between the [...] "pure" [...] pop she recorded in Los Angeles and the indie folk effort that was scrapped in New York. Jepsen has stated that the album is not strictly a period piece, but is [...] "tinted with shades of that era".|$|E

[...] Coffman recalled that this was all Cochrane was waiting for, and he slammed his fist on a table and exclaimed, [...] "OK kid I'll catch you." [...] In his first big league start, Coffman got the win against Grove, as the Tigers beat Boston, 4-2. [...] Coffman and Grove both pitched complete games, and Coffman allowed eight hits in 11 innings; he also had a hit in Detroit's 11th inning rally. [...] The Associated Press account of the game opened as follows: [...] "Youthful George (Slick) Coffman, making his big-league debut with the Detroit Tigers, today pitched his teammates to an 11-lnnlng 4 to 2 victory over the Boston Red Sox." ...|$|E

He said that [...] "it would be among my highest priorities to secure our borders first", before addressing other immigration laws.

But I {{want to make sure you}} understand. Am I quitting? Well, let's get that settled right now. No, I'm not. And the reason is simple—I never learned arithmetic. You see folks, while I didn't get a college degree in mathematics and writing, I majored in miracles. Mathematically impossible miracles. It is because I go back to that which helped crystallize in me a conservative viewpoint as a teenager when it wasn't easy or popular to be a Republican or a conservative in my hometown, because I do believe that America is about making choices, not simply echoing that of others. Let others join the [...] "Me, too" [...] crowd. But I didn't get where I am <b>today</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> didn't fight the battles in a state that, when I became its governor, was 90 percent Democrat, by simply echoing the voices of others.
