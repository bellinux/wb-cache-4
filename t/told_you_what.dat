2500|$|Birley {{records that}} {{it was at this}} time, [...] "scorning the puny modern fashion of moustaches", that Grace grew the {{enormous}} black beard that made him so recognisable.

Grace was a non-smoker but he enjoyed good food and wine; many years later, when discussing the overheads incurred during Lord Sheffield's profitless tour of Australia in 1891–92, Arthur Shrewsbury commented: [...] "I <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> wine would be drunk by the amateurs; Grace himself would drink enough to swim a ship." ...|$|E
2500|$|Grace {{had another}} {{outstanding}} season in 1870, during which Gloucestershire acquired first-class status, and Derek Birley records that, [...] "scorning the puny modern fashion of moustaches", he grew the enormous black beard {{that made him}} so recognisable.

6000|$|... “That’ll do, easy as she goes,” Wolf Larsen counselled back. “I’ve <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>what’s</b> what, {{and let it}} stop at that. The man’s mine, and I’ll make soup of him and eat it if I want to.” ...|$|R

2500|$|In April 1940 he {{was traded}} to the Detroit Lions in {{exchange}} for two rookie players. However, Smukler decided to leave football and join the United States Army. He said, “I got $3,000 a year for playing football professionally. It was great during the season. Everybody shook your hand, slapped you on the back, and <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> a swell fellow you were. But the rest of the time, I couldn’t get a job.” Between football seasons Smukler could only make money doing piecework as a glove cutter. “It was enough to discourage any man, and I kept thinking about what I was going to do when I couldn’t play football anymore. I sat down and figured it out and then decided my best bet was the Army.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Although {{initially}} hesitant, Abrams {{warmed to}} the idea {{on the condition that}} the series would have a supernatural angle to it and if he had a writing partner. ABC executive Heather Kadin sent him Damon Lindelof, who had long intended to meet Abrams as he wished to write for Alias. Together, Abrams and Lindelof created the series' style and characters and also wrote a series bible that conceived and detailed the major mythological ideas and plot points for an ideal four-to-five-season run for the show. The novel idea of a story arc spanning several years was inspired by Babylon 5. Because ABC felt that Alias was too serialized, Lindelof and Abrams assured the network in the bible that the show would be self-contained: [...] "We promise ... that [...] requires NO knowledge of the episode(s) that preceded it ... there is no 'Ultimate Mystery' which requires solving." [...] While such statements contradicted their true plans, the ruse succeeded in persuading ABC to purchase the show. The game Myst, also set in a tropical island, was noted as an influence by Lindelof, as in its narrative, [...] "No one <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> the rules were. You just had to walk around and explore these environments and gradually a story was told." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Who <b>told</b> <b>you</b> so? <b>What</b> do <b>you</b> know? <b>What</b> do I know? Only that I {{long for}} some {{one to make}} me--to make me {{as good as you}} are!" [...] and she burst into tears.|$|R

6000|$|... 'Well,' he said, kissing her, 'you {{have not}} been alarmed, of course. Springrove <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> I had done, and you found there was no train?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Jupiter, I {{should like}} to {{understand}} what it is you are talking about. You say your master is sick. Hasn't he <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> ails him?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; I <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> I {{knew to be}} true. But I {{accepted}} you; and I {{determined to}} love you with all my heart,--with all my heart." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I think so," [...] Lisle {{informed}} him. [...] "But we'll {{let that}} slide. You'd better take {{the thing for}} granted. I'm not here to answer questions. I've <b>told</b> <b>you</b> plainly <b>what</b> I want." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It’s a secret," [...] {{explained}} Mr. Tredgold, addressing his staring friend. [...] "And {{you must}} swear {{to keep it}} if it’s <b>told</b> <b>you.</b> That’s <b>what</b> she means. I’ve had to and so has Stobell." ...|$|R
6000|$|Desmond {{spread his}} hands out as the men of her own {{nationality}} did. [...] "The assurance is a relief to me, but I should feel easier if <b>you</b> <b>told</b> me <b>what</b> <b>you</b> wanted. After all, {{it could not have}} been merely the pleasure of seeing me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Mrs. Andrews, I don't {{think those}} two lads can have <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> they did, for {{if they had}} you would hardly call them silly boys." ...|$|E

6000|$|The Squire's son {{felt that}} it was so, and rushed at the subject all in a hurry. [...] "I <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> I have come up to town about." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not so. That Abbot {{shall never}} be richer for any gem of mine. I have <b>told</b> <b>you</b> in <b>what</b> I trust, {{and it is}} not jewels. Whether I burn or whether I am saved, he shall not have them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Your {{letter was}} rather enigmatical, and I {{do not know}} whether I {{understood}} it exactly. I suppose <b>you</b> <b>told</b> me <b>what</b> <b>you</b> did for good reasons of your own, and I did not think much about it. I believe the question of taste did not come up in my mind.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Ralph, [...] "I know that. But I hope you've not {{forgotten}} the talk {{we had a}} year ago--when I <b>told</b> <b>you</b> exactly <b>what</b> money I should need and begged you to make some good use of the rest." ...|$|R

I <b>told</b> <b>you</b> then <b>what</b> I thought of your soldiering, and your fine ladies. I <b>told</b> <b>you</b> then <b>what</b> it would come to, and I <b>told</b> <b>you</b> true. I don't throw this in your teeth to blame you, M.

6000|$|... "What other {{explanation}} can I give?" [...] Granet asked, his brain working fiercely. [...] "I have <b>told</b> <b>you</b> the truth. <b>What</b> more can I say?" ...|$|R
