50|$|The {{pioneering}} airworthy turbojet aircraft, the He 178, was a German taildragger-geared {{design that}} first flew in August 1939. It {{was used as}} the basis of the later <b>tricycle</b> <b>landing</b> <b>geared</b> He 280, a design passed over for the Me 262. A similar British design, the Gloster E.28/39 had provisions for some armament, but the guns were not fitted on either prototype.|$|R
5|$|The YF-23 was an unconventional-looking aircraft, with {{diamond-shaped}} wings, {{a profile}} with substantial area-ruling to reduce aerodynamic drag at transonic speeds, and an all-moving V-tail. The cockpit was placed high, near {{the nose of}} the aircraft for good visibility for the pilot. The aircraft featured a <b>tricycle</b> <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> configuration with a nose landing gear leg and two main landing gear legs. The weapons bay was placed {{on the underside of the}} fuselage between the nose and main landing gear. The cockpit has a center stick and side throttle.|$|E
5|$|After {{basic design}} work was {{completed}} on the Tu-4 bomber, Tupolev decided {{to design a}} passenger variant with a pressurized fuselage, given the internal designation of Tu-70. It was intended to use as many Tu-4 components as possible to reduce cost and save development time. It was a low-wing, cantilever monoplane with <b>tricycle</b> <b>landing</b> <b>gear,</b> powered by four Shvetsov ASh-73TK radial engines. Design work on a mockup began in February 1946 and the Council of Ministers confirmed an order for a single prototype the following month. A production decision for the Tu-12, {{as it was to}} be known, would be made after testing.|$|E
5|$|Proposals were {{submitted}} by Bell, Boeing Vertol/Grumman team, Hughes, Lockheed, and Sikorsky. In July 1973, the U.S. Department of Defense selected finalists Bell and Hughes Aircraft's Toolco Aircraft Division (later Hughes Helicopters). This began the phase 1 of the competition. Each company built prototype helicopters {{and went through}} a flight test program. Hughes' Model 77/YAH-64A prototype first flew on 30 September 1975, while Bell's Model 409/YAH-63A prototype first flew on 1 October 1975. After evaluating the test results, the Army selected Hughes' YAH-64A over Bell's YAH-63A in 1976. Reasons for selecting the YAH-64A included its more damage tolerant four-blade main rotor and the instability of the YAH-63's <b>tricycle</b> <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> arrangement.|$|E
5000|$|Sky Hawk 3A (SH-3A) is a {{derivative}} of SH-3 {{and most of}} the parameters of both UAVs are identical. The most obvious external visual difference between SH-3 and SH-3A is in the landing gears: the pair of skids of SH-3 is replaced by a <b>tricycle</b> <b>land</b> <b>gear</b> system is SH-3A and thus the takeoff method is consequently different. The overall weight has been increased by 1 kg to 26 kg. Specification (please refer to SH-3 for specification parameters shared by both): ...|$|R
5000|$|Transporter (Ban-Yun-Gong or Banyungong, 搬运工) is a gasoline-powered, {{fixed-wing}} UAV {{of conventional}} layout with high-wing configuration and <b>tricycle</b> <b>land</b> <b>gear</b> system. Propulsion {{is provided by}} a two-blade propeller driven by a tractor engine mounted in the nose. HLKX Transporter share the same airframe as another Chinese UAV, the Long Technology Triumph Transporter and the two UAVs thus almost identical with only slight dimensional difference. The main {{difference between the two}} UAVs is in their respectively flight control systems, which are separately developed by their respective developers and hence totally difference from each other. Specification: ...|$|R
50|$|The Mustang is a low-wing {{cantilever}} monoplane with a swept wing, T-tail and <b>tricycle</b> retractable <b>landing</b> <b>gear.</b> One main door {{is located}} in the forward left section of the aircraft, with an additional emergency exit on the center right section of the fuselage.|$|R
5|$|The XF6U {{was a small}} {{aircraft}} with <b>tricycle</b> <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> {{and with}} straight wings and tail surfaces. The wings were short enough {{that they did not}} need to fold. In order to fit more aircraft into crowded hangars, the nose gear could be retracted and the aircraft's weight would rest on a small wheel attached by the ground crew. This raised the tail up so that it could overlap the nose of the aircraft behind it, allowing more aircraft to fit into available hangar space. The turbojet engine was mounted {{in the rear of the}} fuselage and was fed by ducts in each wing root.|$|E
25|$|<b>Tricycle</b> <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> first {{flown in}} 2006, 3 built.|$|E

50|$|Harrier Hawk I {{is based}} on Guizhou Central, another UAV {{designed}} by GAIC. Harrier Hawk I and Guizhou Central UAVs both share the identical conventional layout with low wing configuration, {{as well as the}} retractable <b>tricycle</b> <b>land</b> <b>gear</b> system. However, the fuelage of Harrier Hawk I is different than that of Guizhou Central in that instead of having an extremely smooth shuttle shaped fuselage of Guizhou Central, the fuselage of Harrier Hawk I is shaped in the form of turtle deck cokpit. Another distinction between Guizhou Central and Harrier Hawk I is that the winglets of Harrier Hawk I is much larger than that of Guizhou Central. Maiden flight of Harrier Hawk I was completed on March, 31, 2013.|$|R

25|$|The D-Plane 1 {{features}} a cantilever mid-wing, a single-seat enclosed cockpit, semi-retractable <b>tricycle</b> <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> {{and a single}} engine in tractor configuration.|$|E
50|$|The {{aircraft}} {{was designed to}} be constructed from plans and emphasized economy. The designer claimed it could be constructed for US$5000 in 1996, including a second hand Subaru engine. It {{was designed to be}} easy to convert between <b>tricycle</b> and conventional <b>landing</b> <b>gear.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Designed by the British {{test pilot}} Frank Courtney, the CA-1 was a five-seat amphibian. The CA-1 was {{powered by a}} [...] Wright 975E-1 radial, cowled and fitted into {{the leading edge of}} the top wing driving - through an {{extension}} shaft - a pusher propeller. It had a <b>tricycle</b> amphibian <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> and an enclosed cabin for the pilot and passengers. Only three aircraft were built and they were all sold in Japan, designated LXC by the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service.|$|R
50|$|Considerable {{attention}} {{was given to}} making the Mi-24 fast. The airframe was streamlined, and fitted with retractable <b>tricycle</b> undercarriage <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> to reduce drag. At high speed, the wings provide considerable lift (up to a quarter of total lift). The main rotor was tilted 2.5° to the right from the fuselage to compensate for translating tendency at a hover. The <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> was also tilted to the left so that the rotor would still be level when the aircraft was on the ground, making {{the rest of the}} airframe tilt to the left. The tail was also asymmetrical to give a side force at speed, thus unloading the tail rotor.|$|R
