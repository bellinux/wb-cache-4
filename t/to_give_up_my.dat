He {{did not attend the}} march due to church duties, but he later wrote, [...] "If I had any idea that the state troopers would use the kind of brutality they did, I would have felt compelled <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>my</b> church duties altogether to lead the line." [...] Footage of police brutality against the protesters was broadcast extensively and aroused national public outrage.|$|E
2500|$|... "I have {{determined}} finally <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>my</b> headstrong design of completing the 'Nibelungen'.

2500|$|... 2009 [...] (29 December) – Ebadi’s sister Noushin Ebadi was {{detained}} apparently {{in an effort}} to silence Ebadi who is abroad. [...] "She was neither politically active nor had a role in any rally. It's necessary to point out that {{in the past two months}} she had been summoned several times to the Intelligence Ministry, who told her to persuade me <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>my</b> human rights activities. I have been arrested solely because of my activities in human rights," [...] Ebadi said.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Either that, or <b>to</b> <b>give</b> it <b>up.</b> <b>My</b> daughter, no doubt, {{will have}} money; but money expects money.' At this moment Lord Alfred entered the room. 'You're very late to-day, Alfred. Why didn't you come {{as you said}} you would?' ...|$|R
2500|$|Harrison's {{contract}} was not renewed in 2004 and the BBC stopped broadcasting professional boxing. Harrison said the BBC {{offered him a}} new contract with which he would be financially [...] "made for life" [...] but {{he would no longer}} be a promoter. Harrison insisted this {{had nothing to do with}} his boxing ability and the decision was racist because [...] "I don’t think if I was blond-haired and blue-eyed they’d have told me <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>my</b> [...] company". A-Force Promotions was re-launched in the USA and Harrison formed a partnership with Al Haymon.|$|E
2500|$|In July 1889, Healy paid a {{courtesy}} {{call to the}} skipper of USRC Rush, Captain Leonard G. Shepard, in an intoxicated state, a serious breach of naval etiquette. Shortly thereafter, Shepard became the Chief of the Revenue Cutter Bureau and he wrote Healy warning {{him that if he}} could not control his drinking, he could face loss of command. Healy replied stating that he [...] "pledge to you by all I hold most sacred that while I live never to touch intoxicants of any kind or description....One thing I will hate and that is <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>my</b> command of the Bear.

2500|$|One {{can easily}} guess what a European {{historical}} and existentialist philosopher might reply [...] You ask me, he would say, to 'die to History'; but man is not, and he cannot be anything else but History, for his very essence is temporality. You are asking me, then, <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>my</b> authentic existence {{and to take}} refuge in an abstraction, in pure Being, in the atman: I am to sacrifice my dignity as a creator of History {{in order to live}} an a-historic, inauthentic existence, empty of all human content. Well, I prefer to put up with my anxiety: at least, it cannot deprive me of a certain heroic grandeur, that of becoming conscious of, and accepting, the human condition.|$|E

2500|$|In his {{autobiography}} written in 1876 Darwin reviewed questions about Christianity {{in relation to}} other religions and how [...] "the more we know of the fixed laws of nature the more incredible do miracles become". Though [...] "very unwilling <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>my</b> belief", he found that [...] "disbelief crept over me at a very slow rate, but was at last complete. The rate was so slow that I felt no distress, and have never since doubted even for a single second that my conclusion was correct." [...] He noted how [...] "The old argument of design in nature, as given by Paley, which formerly seemed to me so conclusive, fails, now that the law of natural selection has been discovered", and how Paley's teleological argument had difficulties with the problem of evil.|$|E

6000|$|... "I think I can {{venture to}} say the poor {{appreciate}} them, too," [...] Hilda answered, bridling up a little--for {{there was nothing she}} hated so much as class-prejudices. [...] "Besides, they need sympathy more; they have fewer comforts. I should not care <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> attending <b>my</b> poor people {{for the sake of the}} idle rich." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Write {{to him and}} bid {{him come}} <b>to</b> you. I'll <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>my</b> seat if he don't come to you. Everett was always a quaint fellow, a little idle, you know,--mooning about after ideas--" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Well, {{her ability}} was not {{sufficient}} to induce me <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>my</b> idea. She told me that after I had known her six months I should detest her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Because,' said Florence, 'I {{am going}} to be his wife, <b>to</b> <b>give</b> him <b>up</b> <b>my</b> whole heart, and to live with him and die with him.
