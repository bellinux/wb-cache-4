40|$|Juveniles and sub {{adults of}} Macrobrachium malcolmsonii were {{collected}} from lower Anicut of the Cauvery River, Tamilnadu, India. Sample tissues such as hepatopancreas, gills and muscle were taken for analyzing total protein, lipid and carbohydrate contents. The content of these biochemical constituents showed an increasing trend from juveniles to different sub adult sizes. Among the three tissues tested, the concentration of total protein <b>was</b> found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>higher</b> in the muscle, followed by hepatopancreas and gills. The concentration of total lipid <b>was</b> found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>higher</b> in the hepatopancreas, followed by gills and muscle. The concentration of total carbohydrate <b>was</b> found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>higher</b> in the muscle, followed by gills and least in the hepatopancreas. The overall percentage difference in concentration of total protein between juveniles and sub adults <b>was</b> found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>higher</b> in the hepatopancreas, less in the muscle and least in the gills. In cases of total carbohydrate and total lipid, the overall percentage differences <b>were</b> found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>higher</b> in the muscle, followed by gills and least in the hepatopancreas. The results clearly indicated that the content of these biochemical constituents proportionately increased with growth of the prawns.

5|$|In the 1790s, Boucherett {{began to}} rise through Lincolnshire's civic and mercantile circles, {{especially}} {{in the north of}} the County, where the family had their seat; his connexions helped him to become involved with a group of businessmen planning to reopen and expand Grimsby's harbour. His rise is charted in his appointments to several civic posts: <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>High</b> Steward of Grimsby from 1794 (he remained as such until his death), succeeding Christopher Clayton, and <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>High</b> Sheriff of Lincolnshire for 1795–6. As these plans for the harbour came to fruition, he was appointed chairman of the company tasked with performing the required work; it was the Grimsby Haven Company, which was created by an Act of Parliament in 1796 (36 Geo III, chap. 98) {{for the express purpose of}} building the dock and repairing the Haven. He secured the friendship and patronage of Charles Anderson Pelham, 1st Baron Yarborough, a prominent local land-owner involved in the Haven Company, and was returned as the Member of Parliament for Great Grimsby in 1796 owing to this friendship.|$|E

5|$|The shock {{from the}} ocellated {{electric}} ray is not dangerous to humans. It occasionally {{appears in the}} home aquarium trade, but is difficult to keep because it requires live invertebrates for food. The ocellated electric ray and other electric rays are used as model organisms in biomedical research because their electric organs are rich in ion channels and acetylcholine receptors, which play important roles in the human nervous system. The protein agrin, which concentrates acetylcholine receptors during human embryonic development, was first isolated from this species. Though the ocellated electric ray is not utilized economically, it is caught incidentally by shrimp trawlers. Its mortality from fishing has not been quantified but is thought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>high,</b> considering that trawling operations in the Atlantic are known to take Diplobatis species in large numbers. The catch rate is also probably underestimated due to problematic identification. Given the restricted range of this species {{and the intensity of}} trawling within its habitat, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed it as Vulnerable.|$|E
