50|$|In caving, {{ascending}} a rope {{by means}} of mechanical devices is often necessary and is the main alternative <b>to</b> <b>ladder</b> use. The rock which forms the cave is often wet, slippery, relatively featureless and often unreachable from the necessary rope locations. So climbing the rope may well be preferable to climbing the rock or a ladder, provided that a belay location that provides a dry ascent has already been found.|$|E
5000|$|Particularly {{in complex}} equipment, wired {{circuits}} are often laid {{out as a}} [...] "ladder" [...] of side-by-side components, which need connecting <b>to</b> <b>ladders</b> or components by wire links. A good layout minimizes such links and wiring complexity, often approaching that of direct point-to-point. Amongst complex devices, the pre-PCB Tektronix vacuum-tube oscilloscopes stand out for their very well-designed point-to-point wiring.|$|R

40|$|Using {{a unique}} and larger sample of {{companies}} from going public from 1998 - 2000 classified by both spinning and laddering manipulation, {{we are able to}} disentangle the effects of laddering and spinning and find that much of the underpricing during the internet bubble was due <b>to</b> <b>laddering</b> rather than spin-ning. In fact, we find that a laddered IPO is expected to be underpriced by 110 % compared to a non-laddered IPO. The effects of spinning are insig-nificant once laddering is simultaneously considered. Our study lends further support <b>to</b> the <b>laddering</b> theory of Aggarwal et al. (2006) as a reason for IPO underpricing during the internet bubble...|$|R

The individual will continue <b>to</b> <b>ladder</b> up in this manner, with the count of unweighted overhead presses equalling four times the number of pushups.
