25|$|The {{justification}} Unicode gives is {{that the}} national standards body in the PRC made unique codepoints for the two variations of the first character 內/内, whereas Korea never made separate codepoints for the unique variants of 全. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>reason</b> for this {{that has nothing to}} do with how the domestic bodies view the characters themselves. China went through a process in the twentieth century that changed (if not simplified) several characters. During this transition, there was a need to be able encode both variants within the same document. Korean has always used the variant of 全 with the 入 (U+5165) radical on top. Therefore, it had no reason to encode both variants. Korean language documents made in the twentieth century had little reason to represent both versions in the same document.|$|E

25|$|His victory odes {{are grouped}} into four books {{named after the}} Olympian, Pythian, Isthmian, and Nemean GamesPanhellenic festivals held {{respectively}} at Olympia, Delphi, Corinth and Nemea. This {{reflects the fact that}} most of the odes were composed in honour of boys, youths, and men who had recently enjoyed victories in athletic (and sometimes musical) contests at those festivals. In a few odes however much older victories, and even victories in lesser games, are celebrated, often as a pretext for addressing other issues or achievements. For example, Pythian 3, composed in honour of Hieron of Syracuse, briefly mentions a victory he had once enjoyed at the Pythian Games, but it is actually intended to console him for his chronic illness (similarly, Pythian 2 is like a private letter in its intimacy). Nemean 9 and Nemean 10 celebrate victories in games at Sicyon and Argos, and Nemean 11 celebrates a victory in a municipal election on Tenedos (though it also mentions some obscure athletic victories). These three odes are the final odes in the Nemean book of odes, and <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>reason</b> for their inclusion. In the original manuscripts, the four books of odes were arranged in the order of importance assigned to the festivals, with the Nemean festival, considered least important, coming last. Victory odes that lacked a Panhellenic subject were then bundled together at the end of the book of Nemean odes.|$|E

2500|$|Moreover, {{mathematical}} {{language can}} be difficult to understand for beginners because common terms such as or and only have more precise meanings than in everyday speech and other common terms such as open and field refer to specific mathematical ideas not related to their usual meanings. Mathematical language also includes many technical terms such as homeomorphism and integrable that have no meaning outside of mathematics. Additionally, shorthand phrases such as iff for [...] "if and only if" [...] belong to mathematical jargon. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>reason</b> for special notation and technical vocabulary: mathematics requires more precision than everyday speech. Mathematicians refer to this precision of language and logic as [...] "rigor".|$|E

Cast against type, {{she played}} a domineering yet needy fish factory worker who has nothing but contempt for her shy daughter and lusts after a local showbiz agent. A breakaway from the kind at heart roles Blethyn had previously played, it was the character's antipathy that attracted the actress to accept the role of Mari: [...] "I have to understand why she is the way she is.

2500|$|Unfortunately, Catholic {{thought is}} often {{misunderstood}} ... {{as if the}} Church supported an ideology of fertility at all costs, urging married couples to procreate indiscriminately and without thought for the future. But one need only study the pronouncements of the Magisterium {{to know that this}} is not so. Truly, in begetting life the spouses fulfill one of the highest dimensions of their calling: they are God's co-workers. Precisely for this reason they must have an extremely responsible attitude. In deciding whether or not to have a child, they must not be motivated by selfishness or carelessness, but by a prudent, conscious generosity that weighs the possibilities and circumstances, and especially gives priority to the welfare of the unborn child. Therefore, when <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>reason</b> not to procreate, this choice is permissible and may even be necessary. However, there remains the duty of carrying it out with criteria and methods that respect the total truth of the marital act in its unitive and procreative dimension, as wisely regulated by nature itself in its biological rhythms. One can comply with them and use them to advantage, but they cannot be [...] "violated" [...] by artificial interference.|$|E
2500|$|Trust is {{increased}} by oxytocin. Disclosure of emotional events {{is a sign}} of trust in humans. When recounting a negative event, humans who receive intranasal oxytocin share more emotional details and stories with more emotional significance. Humans also find faces more trustworthy after receiving intranasal oxytocin. In a study, participants who received intranasal oxytocin viewed photographs of human faces with neutral expressions and found them to be more trustworthy {{than those who did not}} receive oxytocin. This may be because oxytocin reduces the fear of social betrayal in humans. Even after experiencing social alienation by being excluded from a conversation, humans who received oxytocin scored higher in trust on the Revised NEO Personality Inventory. [...] Moreover, in a risky investment game, experimental subjects given nasally administered oxytocin displayed [...] "the highest level of trust" [...] twice as often as the control group. Subjects who were told they were interacting with a computer showed no such reaction, leading to the conclusion that oxytocin was not merely affecting risk aversion. When <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>reason</b> to be distrustful, such as experiencing betrayal, differing reactions are associated with oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR) differences. Those with the CT haplotype experience a stronger reaction, in the form of anger, to betrayal.|$|E
