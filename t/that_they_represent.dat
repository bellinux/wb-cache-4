5|$|Adult Pteranodon {{specimens}} may {{be divided}} into two distinct size classes, small and large, with the large size class being about one and a half times larger than the small class, and the small class being twice as common as the large class. Both size classes lived alongside each other, and while researchers had previously suggested <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>represent</b> different species, Christopher Bennett showed that the differences between them are consistent with the concept <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>represent</b> females and males, and that Pteranodon species were sexually dimorphic. Skulls from the larger size class preserve large, upward and backward pointing crests, while the crests of the smaller size class are small and triangular. Some larger skulls also show evidence of a second crest that extended long and low, toward the tip of the beak, which is not seen in smaller specimens.|$|E

5|$|According to Gočeva, {{the album}} {{features}} elements of ethno jazz {{in addition to}} the prominent elements of Macedonian folklore music. Critics also noted elements of pop and jazz in the songs and added <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>represent</b> an internationalization of the sound of traditional Macedonian music. The lyrics cover various topics which express states of happiness, sadness, love and longing of a mellow female protagonist. Instrumentally, the songs on Makedonsko Devojče 2 contain the following instruments: clarinet, bass guitar, horn, acoustic guitar, violin, qanun, saxophone and percussion.|$|E

5|$|By 2011 {{there were}} 210 active {{chapters}} out of 314 chapters chartered since 1919, and 7 colonies. Colonies are probationary chapters at universities {{that have not}} historically had a chapter of Kappa Kappa Psi or whose chapter has gone inactive. Chapters and colonies of Kappa Kappa Psi are organized into seven districts, six of which are named for the geographical region of the United States <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>represent.</b> These are the North Central, Northeast, Midwest, Southeast, Southwest, and Western Districts. Although an International District is provided for, it has no chapters.|$|E
5|$|In the White Sea {{region of}} Russia, all three {{assemblage}} types {{have been found}} in close proximity. This, and the faunas' considerable temporal overlap, makes it unlikely <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>represent</b> evolutionary stages or temporally distinct communities. Since they are globally distributed – described on all continents except Antarctica – geographical boundaries {{do not appear to be}} a factor; the same fossils are found at all palaeolatitudes (the latitude where the fossil was created, accounting for continental drift) and in separate sedimentary basins.|$|E
5|$|All of {{the heads}} are realistic, unidealised and frank {{descriptions}} of the men. It is likely that they were portraits of living (or recently deceased) rulers well known to the sculptors. Each head is distinct and naturalistic, displaying individualised features. They were once thought to represent ballplayers although this theory is no longer widely held; it is possible, however, <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>represent</b> rulers equipped for the Mesoamerican ballgame. Facial expressions depicted on the heads vary from stern through placid to smiling. The most naturalistic Olmec art is the earliest, appearing suddenly without surviving antecedents, with a tendency towards more stylised sculpture as time progressed. Some surviving examples of wooden sculpture recovered from El Manatí demonstrate that the Olmecs {{are likely to have}} created many more perishable sculptures than works sculpted from stone.|$|E

5|$|Bahá'u'lláh {{stated that}} he was a {{messenger}} of God, and he used the term Manifestation of God to define the concept of an intermediary between humanity and God. In the Bahá'í writings, the Manifestations of God are a series of interrelated personages who speak with a divine voice and who reflect the attributes of the divine into the human world for the progress and advancement of human morals and civilization. The Manifestations of God, as explained by Bahá'u'lláh, are not incarnations of God, but have a two-fold station; one which is the divine in that they reveal God's attributes, but not God's essence, and one which is human in <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>represent</b> the physical qualities of common man, and have human limitations. Bahá'u'lláh wrote that God will never manifest his essence into the world.|$|E
5|$|Fruit {{bodies of}} Sutorius eximius {{grow in the}} soil singly or {{scattered}} among leaf litter. A mycorrhizal species, the bolete has been recorded growing in association with plants from various genera, including Dicymbe, Dipterocarpus, Fagus, Hopea, Quercus, Shorea, and Tsuga. The species has been recorded from North America, Costa Rica, and Indonesia. In Costa Rica, where it usually associates with the endemic oaks Quercus seemannii and Q.copeyensis, the lilac-brown bolete can be locally abundant in the Cordillera Central and the Cordillera de Talamanca. Additional locations with collections {{that have not been}} confirmed by DNA analysis include Guyana, Japan, China. Although S.eximius has been reported from Thailand, molecular analysis of Thai collections suggests <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>represent</b> a distinct, as-yet unnamed species.|$|E
5|$|He {{continued}} {{to erect a}} further seven high-quality stelae until AD736, monuments that are considered masterpieces of Classic Maya sculpture with such mastery of detail <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>represent</b> the highest pinnacle of Maya artistic achievement. The stelae depict king Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil ritually posed and bearing the attributes {{of a variety of}} deities, including B'olon K'awiil, K'uy Nik Ajaw and Mo' Witz Ajaw. The king also carried out major construction works, including a new version of Temple26 that now bore the first version of the Hieroglyphic Stairway, plus two temples that have now been lost to the erosion of the Copán River. He also encased the Rosalila phase of Temple16 within a new phase of construction. He remodelled the ballcourt, then demolished it and built a new one in its place.|$|E

5|$|In these applications, one forms a graph {{in which}} each vertex {{represents}} a matched pair of atoms, one from each of two molecules. Two vertices are connected by an edge if the matches <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>represent</b> are compatible with each other. Being compatible may mean, for instance, that the distances between the atoms within the two molecules are approximately equal, to within some given tolerance. A clique in this graph represents a set of matched pairs of atoms {{in which all the}} matches are compatible with each other. A special case of this method is the use of the modular product of graphs to reduce the problem of finding the maximum common induced subgraph of two graphs to the problem of finding a maximum clique in their product.|$|E
5|$|Su Song {{also created}} a {{celestial}} atlas (in five separate maps), which had the hour circles between the xiu (lunar mansions) forming the astronomical meridians, with stars marked in an equidistant cylindrical projection {{on each side of}} the equator, and thus, was in accordance to their north polar distances. Furthermore, Su Song must have taken advantage of the astronomical findings of his political rival and contemporary astronomer Shen Kuo. This is so because Su Song's fourth star map places the position of the pole star halfway between Tian shu (−350 degrees) and the current Polaris; this was the more accurate calculation (by 3 degrees) that Shen Kuo had made when he observed the pole star over a period of three months with his width-improved sighting tube. There were many star maps written before Song's book, but the greatest significance of these star maps by Su Song is, <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>represent</b> the oldest extant star maps in printed form.|$|E
5|$|As with so {{many other}} parts of the myth, the {{resolution}} is complex and varied. Often, Horus and Set divide the realm between them. This division can be equated with any of several fundamental dualities that the Egyptians saw in their world. Horus may receive the fertile lands around the Nile, the core of Egyptian civilization, in which case Set takes the barren desert or the foreign lands that are associated with it; Horus may rule the earth while Set dwells in the sky; and each god may take one of the two traditional halves of the country, Upper and Lower Egypt, in which case either god may be connected with either region. Yet in the Memphite Theology, Geb, as judge, first apportions the realm between the claimants and then reverses himself, awarding sole control to Horus. In this peaceable union, Horus and Set are reconciled, and the dualities <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>represent</b> have been resolved into a united whole. Through this resolution, order is restored after the tumultuous conflict.|$|E
50|$|Resnick also {{sued the}} Chicago {{law firm of}} Neal, Gerber and Eisenberg for legal {{malpractice}} over a multi-million dollar contract dispute alleging <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>represented</b> both Resnick and the contracting party.

50|$|During the Romantic Era, {{in which}} the Middle Ages were glorified, the Fraktur typefaces {{additionally}} gained the (historically incorrect) interpretation <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>represented</b> the German Gothicism.

5|$|For {{almost all}} of their history, Serjeants at Law and King's Serjeants were the only advocates given rights of {{audience}} in the Court of Common Pleas. Until the 17th century they were also first {{in the order of}} precedence in the Court of King's Bench and Court of Chancery, which gave them priority in motions before the court. Serjeants also had the privilege of being immune from most normal forms of lawsuit – they could only be sued by a writ from the Court of Chancery. It was held as an extension of this that servants of Serjeants could only be sued in the Common Pleas. As part of the Court of Common Pleas the Serjeants also performed some judicial duties, such as levying fines. In exchange for these privileges, Serjeants were expected to fulfil certain duties; firstly, <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>represent</b> anybody who asked regardless of their ability to pay, and secondly that, due to the small number of judges, they serve as deputy judges to hear cases when there was no judge available.|$|E
5|$|Lactarius vietus {{is fairly}} common, {{and can be}} found growing in moist areas under trees in autumn, often among Sphagnum moss. Though it {{strongly}} favours beech, it has also been found under oak. It forms an ectomycorrhizal relationship with the trees under which it grows. It can also be found growing on rotting wood or other hard surfaces; specimens have been observed on both conifer and hardwood logs. These are typically smaller specimens, and it is possible <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>represent</b> a dwarf variety. Despite growing on rotting wood, the species is not saprotrophic; instead, the mycelia of the species are linking with tree roots growing through or near the wood. This is a particularly useful adaptation when the soil is either wet or nutrient-poor. Mushrooms can sometimes grow in large numbers, but they can also be found growing in tight clumps, or solitarily when growing out of season. The species can be found in Europe, with collections in Scandinavia, the British Isles Bulgaria, Germany, and northern Turkey; in North America, it has been recorded as common in Canada and both the northern and southern United States; in northern Asia, it was found in regions near both the Oka River and the central Angara River in Siberia; and in eastern Asia, it has been collected in China.|$|E
5|$|Sinosauropteryx was {{the first}} dinosaur to have its life {{colouration}} described by scientists based on physical evidence. Some fossils of Sinosauropteryx show an alternation of lighter and darker bands preserved on the tail. Chen and colleagues initially interpreted this banding pattern as an artifact of the splitting between the main slab and counter-slab in which the original specimen was preserved. However, Longrich suggested in his 2002 presentation for the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology that these specimens actually preserve remnants of the colouration pattern the animal would have exhibited in life. He argued that the dark, banded areas on the tail were too evenly spaced to {{have been caused by}} random separation of the fossil slabs, and <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>represent</b> fossilized pigments present in the feathers. Additionally, rather than an artifact of preservation or decomposition, the presence of dark feathers along only the top of the body may also reflect the colour pattern in life, indicating that Sinosauropteryx prima was countershaded with dark colouration on its back and lighter colouration on its underside, with bands or stripes on the tail for camouflage.|$|E
