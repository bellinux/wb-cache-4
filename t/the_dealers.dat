5|$|Trevor {{appears as}} a main {{character}} in Grand Theft Auto Online, the online multiplayer mode of Grand Theft Auto V. He provides missions to the player character once they reach Rank 13; after the player steals Trevor's rolling meth lab, Trevor demands that they are to complete jobs for him to settle the issue. The jobs that Trevor demands generally consist of stealing drugs from rival groups, specifically the Lost Motorcycle Club, while killing <b>the</b> <b>dealers.</b> The narrative of Grand Theft Auto Online is set several {{months prior to the}} events of the single-player story.|$|E
5|$|In {{part because}} he was {{overlooked}} until the mid-19th century, Velázquez found no followers and was not widely imitated. In particular, his visual and structural innovations in this portrayal of Venus were not developed by other artists until recently, largely owing to the censorship of the work. The painting remained {{in a series of}} private rooms in private collections until it was exhibited in 1857 at the Manchester Art Treasures Exhibition, along with 25 other paintings at least claimed to be by Velázquez; it was here that it became known as the Rokeby Venus. It {{does not appear to have}} been copied by other artists, engraved or otherwise reproduced, until this period. In 1890 it was exhibited in the Royal Academy in London, and in 1905 at Messrs. Agnews, <b>the</b> <b>dealers</b> who had bought it from Morritt. From 1906 it was highly visible in the National Gallery and became well-known globally through reproductions. The general influence of the painting was therefore long delayed, although individual artists would have been able to see it on occasion throughout its history.|$|E
5|$|Wonder Stories had a {{circulation}} of about 25,000 in 1934, {{comparable to that of}} Amazing Stories, which had declined from an early peak of about 100,000. Gernsback considered issuing a reprint magazine in 1934, Wonder Stories Reprint Annual, but it never appeared. That year he experimented with other fiction magazines—Pirate Stories and High Seas Adventures—but neither was successful. Wonder Stories was also failing, and in November 1935 it started publishing bimonthly instead of monthly. Gernsback had a reputation for paying slowly and was therefore unpopular with many authors; by 1936 he was even failing to pay Laurence Manning, one of his most reliable authors. Staff were sometimes asked to delay cashing their paychecks for weeks at a time. Gernsback felt the blame lay with dealers who were returning magazine covers as unsold copies, and then selling the stripped copies at a reduced rate. To bypass <b>the</b> <b>dealers,</b> he made a plea in the March 1936 issue to his readers, asking them to subscribe, and proposing to distribute Wonder Stories solely by subscription. There was little response, and Gernsback decided to sell. He made a deal with Ned Pines of Beacon Magazines and on 21 February 1936 Wonder Stories was sold.|$|E
50|$|To play, <b>the</b> <b>dealer</b> {{gives one}} card to the {{receiver}} and one to <b>the</b> <b>dealer.</b> <b>The</b> receiver may choose to exchange cards with <b>the</b> <b>dealer,</b> unless <b>the</b> <b>dealer</b> has a king, in which case no exchange occurs. Then, <b>the</b> <b>dealer</b> may choose to exchange with the top card of the deck, unless the top card is a king, in which case no exchange occurs.

50|$|Accordingly, for <b>the</b> <b>dealer,</b> <b>the</b> cost of laying-off, {{a loss to}} <b>the</b> <b>dealer,</b> is <b>the</b> <b>dealer’s</b> primary {{variable}} cost and is built into <b>the</b> <b>dealer’s</b> spread. <b>The</b> range of <b>the</b> <b>dealer’s</b> price, therefore, according to Treynor’s conclusions, can be anywhere between 30-40% of the security’s value all without any valuation changes from the VBT {{to compensate for the}} cost of laying-off.|$|R
5|$|According to the Independent Scientific Committee on Drugs, after {{mephedrone}} {{was made}} illegal, a street {{trade in the}} drug emerged, with prices around double those prior to the ban, at £20–£25 per gram. In September 2010, Druglink reported the ban had had a mixed effect on mephedrone use, with it decreasing in some areas, remaining similar in others and becoming more prevalent in some areas. In an online survey of 150 users after the ban, 63% said they were continuing to use mephedrone, half of those used the same amount and half said they used less. Compared to previous surveys, more users purchased it from dealers, rather than the internet. The average price per gram was £16, compared to around £10 before the ban. The 2010 Mixmag survey of 2,500 nightclubbers found one quarter had used mephedrone in the previous month, the price had roughly doubled since it was made illegal, and it {{was more likely to}} be cut with other substances. Of those who had already used mephedrone prior to the ban, 75% had continued to use it after the ban. Of the various drugs used by the survey participants, users {{were more likely to have}} concerns about it. Interviews with users in Northern Ireland also found the price had roughly doubled since it was made illegal, to around £30 a gram. Rather than the price rising due to increased scarcity of the drug, it is thought to have risen for two other reasons. Firstly, dealers knew there was still demand for mephedrone, but were aware the supplies may be exhausted in the future. Secondly, <b>the</b> <b>dealers</b> perceived customers were likely to be willing to pay more for an illegal substance.|$|E
5|$|Around the 1880s, San Francisco wine dealers were {{purchasing}} {{wine from}} Napa Valley vintners at low prices (sometimes around 15 to 18 cents per gallon). <b>The</b> <b>dealers</b> had facilities to store and age wines that most Napa Valley vintners lacked, and thus {{were able to}} purchase wine from the vintners at low prices. Because of this, Bourn began a campaign to build the cooperative winery; {{he was in his}} early 30s at the time. He created a business partnership with another businessman, E. Everett Wise, who was of a similar age. Bourn then asked for support within the Napa County wine industry. Bourn met with Henry Pellet, president of the St. Helena Vinicultural Club, who endorsed the idea and encouraged his associates to do the same. Bourn and Wise ended up gathering enough support from the local wine industry, and they hired George Percy and Frederick F. Hamilton of the San Francisco architectural firm Percy & Hamilton to design the Greystone Cellars, along with Italian stonemasons to build the façades, and the Ernest L. Ransome firm to handle concrete work. The plans involved the use of new materials and technology of the time, including the relatively new Portland cement. The cement was used as mortar and also poured over the iron reinforcing rods built within the first and second floor elevations. The heavy timber construction of the third floor provided structural support for not only that floor's cask, barrel and bottle aging space but also for the gravity-flow crushing area located on the floor above. The architects planned for the cellars to hold two million gallons of wine at a time, with thirteen tunnels in the hillside behind the building to hold another million gallons. Those tunnels collapsed due to effects of water seepage and of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake.|$|E
25|$|In {{the final}} episodes of season three, Jesse discovers that drug dealers in Gus's {{organization}} {{were responsible for}} the death of a friend, and that they had used Tomas (Angelo Martinez), the 11-year-old brother of his new girlfriend Andrea (Emily Rios), to commit the act. When <b>the</b> <b>dealers</b> murder Tomas, Jesse plots revenge, but Walt intervenes by killing <b>the</b> <b>dealers</b> himself. Gus's cleaner Mike Ehrmantraut (Jonathan Banks) drags Walt to the laboratory and threatens to kill him unless he tells them where Jesse is hiding. Walt frantically calls Jesse and tells him to kill Gale to ensure that they don't outlive their usefulness to Gus. Jesse goes to Gale's house and shoots him dead.|$|E
5000|$|... 4. The {{player to}} whom <b>the</b> <b>dealer</b> handed <b>the</b> cards then deals the first hand of cards for the round. If <b>the</b> <b>dealer</b> cut exactly, <b>the</b> <b>dealer</b> gets 100 points; if <b>the</b> <b>dealer</b> is + or - one card, <b>the</b> <b>dealer</b> gets 50 points. If <b>the</b> <b>dealer</b> found any Jokers or Wild 2’s {{at the bottom}} of the deck, these are counted as part of his/her first hand of a total of 11 cards. (Example: If three players and <b>the</b> <b>dealer</b> found two Jokers/Wild 2’s in the bottom three cards, the deal of the first hand of 11 cards {{consists}} of 11 cards each for the two non-dealers and 9 cards for <b>the</b> <b>dealer.</b> If <b>the</b> cut from the bottom of the original deck was exactly 11+11+9+1, or 32 cards, then <b>the</b> <b>dealer</b> gets 100 base points; if either 31 or 33 cards, <b>the</b> <b>dealer</b> was off one card and gets 50 base points.).|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>dealer</b> {{takes his}} or her turn last.

25|$|For 15 years, Wayne Schmuck of Harvard, Illinois, {{owner of}} Big Foot Auto Sales, had sold used cars {{he had bought}} in his state, where vehicle titles did not then require a {{statement}} on {{the title of the}} odometer reading {{at the time of the}} transaction, to dealers in Wisconsin, which did. Unbeknownst to <b>the</b> <b>dealers,</b> he had in some cases hired someone to roll back the odometers on them, making the vehicles appear to have less mileage than they actually did. Thus they commanded an artificially higher price, both when the dealer paid Schmuck and when they sold it to a customer. In order for the retail transaction to take place, <b>the</b> <b>dealers</b> needed to mail a title application, including the falsified odometer reading, to the state Department of Transportation.|$|E
25|$|The {{initiative}} Choice in eCommerce {{was founded}} on May 8, 2013 by several online retailers in Berlin, Germany. The cause was, {{in the view of}} the initiative, sales bans and online restrictions by individual manufacturers. <b>The</b> <b>dealers</b> felt cut off from their main sales channel and thus deprived them the opportunity to use online platforms like Amazon, eBay, or Rakuten in a competitive market for the benefit of their customers.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> initial <b>dealer</b> {{is chosen}} by any common method, {{although}} {{it should be}} remembered that in Canasta there is no privilege or advantage to being <b>the</b> <b>dealer.</b> <b>The</b> deal then rotates clockwise after every hand. <b>The</b> <b>dealer</b> shuffles <b>the</b> pack, the player to <b>the</b> <b>dealer's</b> right cuts, and <b>the</b> <b>dealer</b> deals out 2 hands of 11 cards to each player.|$|R
2500|$|Once all {{the players}} have {{completed}} their hands, it is <b>the</b> <b>dealer’s</b> turn. <b>The</b> <b>dealer</b> hand will not be completed if all players have either busted or received Blackjacks. <b>The</b> <b>dealer</b> must hit until the cards total 17 or more points. (At most tables <b>the</b> <b>dealer</b> also hits on a [...] "soft" [...] 17, i.e. a hand containing an ace and one or more other cards totaling six.) Players win by not busting and having a total higher than <b>the</b> <b>dealer,</b> or getting a blackjack without <b>the</b> <b>dealer</b> getting a blackjack. If <b>the</b> player and <b>dealer</b> have <b>the</b> same total (not counting blackjacks), {{this is called a}} [...] "push", and the player typically does not win or lose money on that hand. Otherwise, <b>the</b> <b>dealer</b> wins.|$|R
50|$|In {{the case}} of (1) or (3), <b>the</b> <b>dealer</b> remains <b>the</b> same. In {{the case of}} (2), when <b>the</b> <b>dealer</b> cannot declare tenpai, <b>the</b> <b>dealer</b> changes, but <b>the</b> number of {{counters}} increases regardless of whether <b>the</b> <b>dealer</b> declares tenpai. In all other cases, namely when only a non-dealer wins, the count is reset to zero.|$|R
25|$|It {{is unclear}} how, but several Gulf Cartel members traced {{one of their}} stolen loads to a stash house of {{suspected}} dealers in Elsa, Texas on 1 November 2011. The cartel then called on an American-based prison gang to go and buy the loads to learn {{the location of the}} stash house. The gang dealers then went and bought the drugs from <b>the</b> <b>dealers,</b> but realized that it was not at the stash house were the goods were allegedly hidden. In an attempt to disclose the information to <b>the</b> <b>dealers,</b> the gang members kidnapped them, and that was when two country sheriffs received an emergency call a possible kidnapping. The policemen then spotted the gang member's Ford F-150 pickup truck and ordered the drivers to stop. While one of the policemen was speaking to the driver, the other approached the passenger window and was shot with a 9 mm gun. The policeman managed to survive because he was wearing a bullet vest. One of the gang members, however, was killed; the other {{was shot in the head}} and remained in critical condition.|$|E
25|$|According to Weeks, Bulger {{enforced}} {{strict rules}} over <b>the</b> <b>dealers</b> who were paying him protection. The only people we ever {{put out of}} business were heroin dealers. Jimmy didn't allow heroin in South Boston. It was a dirty drug that users stuck in their arms, making problems with needles, and later on, AIDS. While people can do cocaine socially and still function, once they do heroin, they're zombies. Weeks also insists that Bulger strictly forbade PCP and selling to children, and that those dealers who refused to play by his rules were violently driven out of the neighborhood.|$|E
25|$|The {{case had}} begun when Schmuck was prosecuted for having rolled back odometers {{for years on}} cars he sold to used-car dealers. He had been indicted for 12 counts of mail fraud, based on the vehicle title {{applications}} <b>the</b> <b>dealers</b> had then mailed to the state's Department of Transportation in order to resell the cars. Before his trial in the Western District of Wisconsin, he had been denied a motion to have the jury instructed that they could vote to convict him of tampering with the odometer, {{at the time a}} less serious offense, if they did not find him guilty of mail fraud.|$|E
5000|$|All call {{bets are}} {{considered}} courtesy bets and are only placed if <b>the</b> <b>dealer</b> {{has time to}} change and place the bets. The bet is considered taken only if <b>the</b> <b>dealer</b> and <b>the</b> inspector <b>dealer</b> has repeated <b>the</b> bet. If <b>the</b> <b>dealer</b> does not take the bet, they will announce [...] "no bet". To argue with <b>the</b> <b>dealer</b> about which bets have been taken is considered extremely impolite and will most likely render a warning from <b>the</b> inspector <b>dealer</b> or pit boss.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>dealer</b> shuffles {{and deals}} two cards to each player, ending with <b>the</b> <b>dealer.</b>|$|R
50|$|When <b>the</b> <b>dealer</b> is {{involved}} in either the winning or losing side of a hand, extra tai (one plus {{twice the number of}} times <b>the</b> <b>dealer</b> has consecutively retained dealership) are added to <b>the</b> <b>dealer's</b> winnings or losses.|$|R
25|$|Blackmun ruled for the {{government}} on both questions. Since Schmuck had enjoyed a continuing relationship with <b>the</b> <b>dealers</b> he sold to, and the cars could not be resold to a retail customer without titles obtained using false information, the dealers' applications were {{an essential element of}} his crime and thus constituted mail fraud. On the second question, Blackmun said the court should have considered whether the elements of odometer tampering were a subset of the elements of the mail fraud, and since {{that was not the case}} Schmuck had been properly denied the instruction. Scalia's dissent focused exclusively on the mail fraud issue. Since Schmuck had already received his payment for the altered vehicles, it did not matter what happened afterwards, a holding he found more consistent with the Court's earlier rulings on the subject.|$|E
25|$|In 1973, Garrison {{was tried}} and {{found not guilty}} by the jury for {{accepting}} bribes to protect illegal pinball machine operations. The prosecutor was Gerald J. Gallinghouse of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana, who was seeking to halt public corruption. Pershing Gervais, Garrison's former chief investigator, testified that Garrison had received approximately $3,000 every two months for nine years from <b>the</b> <b>dealers.</b> Acting as his own defense attorney, Garrison called the allegations baseless and claimed that they were concocted {{as part of a}} U.S. government effort to destroy him because of Garrison's efforts to implicate the CIA in the Kennedy assassination. The jury found Garrison not guilty. In an interview conducted by New Orleans reporter Rosemary James with Pershing Gervais, James alleged Gervais had admitted to concocting the charges.|$|E
25|$|In May 1910, the Self-Portrait with Palette {{appeared}} in an {{exhibit at the}} gallery of Georges Petit in Paris, where it was labeled as on loan from the widow of the Marquis Etienne de Ganay. Just a month later it was shown in an exhibit by the gallery owners Paul Durand-Ruel, Bernheim-Jeune and Paul Cassirer together with all other Manet paintings {{that had previously been}} owned by Pellerin. Pellerin had sold his collection to <b>the</b> <b>dealers,</b> {{with the exception of the}} Self-Portrait with Palette, which he had sold to Madame de Ganay immediately beforehand. Ganay owned the painting through the 1920s; by 1931 it was in the collection of the Berlin bank president Jakob Goldschmidt. Goldschmidt immigrated to New York City in 1936, taking his collection with him, and died there in 1955. In 1958 the painting was bought by J. Summers for 65,000.|$|E
50|$|The person left of <b>the</b> <b>dealer</b> is <b>the</b> {{first person}} to play. <b>The</b> <b>dealer</b> {{switches}} {{from person to person}} going to <b>the</b> left. <b>The</b> <b>dealer</b> flips one card and places it next to the pile to begin the game.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>dealer's</b> joker can be 'blocked' at {{any time}} in the game by placing another joker face down over it. If <b>the</b> <b>dealer's</b> joker is so blocked it may not be used by <b>the</b> <b>dealer</b> for <b>the</b> {{remainder}} of that hand.|$|R

25|$|Around 1981 his {{scheme was}} {{discovered}} when suspicious regulators {{wrote to the}} vehicles' previous owners, whose addresses were on the dealer's applications, and learned what the odometers had {{said at the time}} of sale. He was arrested by federal authorities and indicted on 12 counts of mail fraud, a felony, for cars he had sold to five different dealers, some as many as five times over a two-year period. At his trial, presided over by district judge Barbara Brandriff Crabb, he admitted that he had rolled back the odometers, but denied that he had committed mail fraud since <b>the</b> <b>dealers</b> had sent the applications after they had bought the cars from him, therefore it wasn't necessary that they do so for him to have realized the proceeds of the odometer tampering. Before his trial in United States District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin, his attorney, Peter Lewis Steinberg, moved that the jury be instructed that they could convict Schmuck on the lesser included charge of odometer tampering, at the time a misdemeanor, if they did not feel his actions constituted mail fraud.|$|E
