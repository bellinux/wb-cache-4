5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>balance</b> {{spring is}} a fine spiral or helical torsion spring used in {{mechanical}} watches, alarm clocks, kitchen timers, marine chronometers, and other timekeeping mechanisms to control the rate of oscillation of <b>the</b> <b>balance</b> wheel. <b>The</b> <b>balance</b> spring is an essential adjunct to <b>the</b> <b>balance</b> wheel, causing it to oscillate back and forth. <b>The</b> <b>balance</b> spring and balance wheel together form a harmonic oscillator, which oscillates with a precise period or [...] "beat" [...] resisting external disturbances, and is responsible for timekeeping accuracy.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>balancing</b> {{period is}} often {{assumed to be}} one year (suitable to cover all {{operation}} energy uses). A shorter period (monthly or seasonal) could also be considered {{as well as a}} balance over the entire life cycle (including embodied energy, which could also be annualized and counted in addition to operational energy uses).|$|E
25|$|During chewing, the {{mandible}} {{moves in}} a specific manner as delineated by the two temporomandibular joints. The side of the mandible that moves laterally {{is referred to as}} either the working or rotating side, while the other side is referred to as either <b>the</b> <b>balancing</b> or orbiting side. The latter terms, although a bit outdated, are actually more precise, as they define the sides by the movements of the respective condyles.|$|E
25|$|The strict shape {{tolerance}} of gömböcs hindered production. The first prototype of a gömböc was manufactured in summer 2006 using three-dimensional rapid prototyping technology. Its accuracy however was below requirements, and the gömböc would often {{get stuck in}} an intermediate position rather than returning to the stable equilibrium. The technology was improved to increase the spatial accuracy to the required level and to use various construction materials. In particular, transparent (especially lightly colored) solids are visually appealing, as they demonstrate the homogeneous composition. Current materials for gömböcs include various metals and alloys, plastics such as Plexiglass, stones such as marble and ceramics, and injection-molded plastic. <b>The</b> <b>balancing</b> properties of a gömböc are affected by mechanical defects and dust both on its body and on the surface on which it rests. If damaged, the process of restoring the original shape {{is more complex than}} producing a new one. Although in theory <b>the</b> <b>balancing</b> properties should not depend on the material and object size, in practice, both larger and heavier gömböcs have better chances to return to equilibrium in case of defects.|$|E

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>balance</b> {{spring and}} <b>the</b> <b>balance</b> wheel (which is usually {{referred}} to as simply [...] "the balance") form a harmonic oscillator. <b>The</b> <b>balance</b> spring provides a restoring couple that limits and reverses the motion of <b>the</b> <b>balance</b> so it oscillates back and forth. The motion of <b>the</b> <b>balance</b> is approximately simple harmonic motion, i.e., a sinusoidal motion of constant period. Its resonant period makes it resistant to changes from perturbing forces, which {{is what makes it}} a good timekeeping device. The stiffness of the spring, its spring coefficient, [...] in N*m/radian, along with <b>the</b> <b>balance</b> wheel's moment of inertia, [...] in kg*m2, determines the wheel's oscillation period [...] in seconds:This period controls the rate of the timepiece.|$|R
25|$|Penang is {{also the}} birthplace of the Chingay procession, which began with its first parade in 1919.

25|$|The {{classical}}/balance controversy. The classical {{hypothesis of}} genetic variability, {{often associated with}} Hermann Muller, maintains that most genes are of a normal wild type, and that most individuals are homozygous for that wild type, while most selection is purifying selection that operates to eliminate deleterious alleles. <b>The</b> <b>balancing</b> hypothesis, often associated with Theodosius Dobzhansky, states that heterozygosity will be common at loci, and that it frequently reflects either directional selection or balancing selection.|$|E
25|$|When the {{mandible}} {{is moved}} into a lateral excursion, the working side condyle (the condyle {{on the side of}} the mandible that moves outwards) only performs rotation (in the horizontal plane), while <b>the</b> <b>balancing</b> side condyle performs translation. During actual functional chewing, when the teeth are not only moved side to side, but also up and down when biting of the teeth is incorporated as well, rotation (in a vertical plane) also plays a part in both condyles.|$|E
40|$|<b>The</b> {{principles}} of <b>balance,</b> randomization, control and repetition, which are closely related, constitute the four {{principles of}} scientific research. <b>The</b> <b>balance</b> principle is <b>the</b> kernel {{of the four}} principles which runs through the other three. However, in scientific research, <b>the</b> <b>balance</b> principle is always overlooked.

25|$|Another major {{aspect of}} the {{gameplay}} is the alethiometer, (a rare truth-telling device which features in the novels). Once the player {{has access to the}} Alethiometer, it can be asked certain set questions. The device has thirty-six symbols on its outer edge, each with three meanings. These meanings are discovered over the course of game; some are learned automatically as the plot advances, others must be sought out by the player and can be missed. For each question, Lyra is given three words, and each word is assigned a hand on the Alethiometer. If Lyra knows the corresponding symbol of a given word, the hand automatically turns to the correct symbol. Words she doesn't know must be guessed by the player. When the three hands are all pointing at symbols, the player confirms the selection and Lyra asks the question. A balancing minigame then begins, where the player must press buttons corresponding to the on-screen display. The more symbols which were correctly identified {{in the first part of}} the game, the easier <b>the</b> <b>balancing</b> game is. If the player successfully completes <b>the</b> <b>balancing</b> game, the Alethiometer will answer the question.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, strong doubts have been {{expressed}} about substantive legitimate expectation.

25|$|Much of Magnétophone's {{music from}} the early singles to the first LP is notable for its 'challenging' nature (the pounding, broken, {{distorted}} beats and unrecognisable bass textures of 'I Hear Blonde Falcons' being a case-in-point), {{and it is clear}} that the band at this stage were often concerned with creating original audio 'objects' that have questionable worth outside of pure abstract appreciation; other tracks from this time more clearly reference rock'n'roll's more simple appeal, and <b>the</b> <b>balancing</b> of these two ethics across a record creates a unique and unsettling audio and emotional experience.|$|E

25|$|The {{case was}} the first in a line {{considering}} the right of public employees to speak contemporaneously with their employment that had started with Pickering v.

The two would guide the Court's interpretation of later cases such as Rankin v. McPherson (1987). In the 1990s and 2000s, Waters v. Churchill (1994) and Garcetti v. Ceballos (2006), the latter with some similarities to the circumstances of Connick, would further clarify the Court's holding.|$|E

The interview with the architect focused on the process of building the scorecard and the views of the ‗architect‘ on the implementation of <b>the</b> <b>Balanced</b> Scorecard at <b>the</b> company. The other interviews aimed to answer two questions; namely how <b>the</b> <b>Balanced</b> Scorecard facilitated <b>the</b> implementation of the strategy in the company and the factors that helped or hindered the implementation of <b>the</b> <b>Balanced</b> Scorecard in <b>the</b> company.
