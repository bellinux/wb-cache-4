40|$|International audienceBackground and Aims Condensed tannins (also called proanthocyanidins) are {{widespread}} polymers of catechins and {{are essential}} for the defence mechanisms of vascular plants (<b>Tracheophyta).</b> A large body of evidence argues for the synthesis of monomeric epicatechin on the cytosolic face of the endoplasmic reticulum and its transport to the vacuole, although the site of its polymerization into tannins remains to be elucidated. The aim {{of the study was}} to re-examine the cellular frame of tannin polymerization in various representatives of the <b>Tracheophyta.</b> Methods Light microscopy epifluorescence, confocal microscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), chemical analysis of tannins following cell fractionation, and immunocytochemistry were used as independent methods on tannin-rich samples from various organs from Cycadophyta, Ginkgophyta, Equisetophyta, Pteridophyta, Coniferophyta and Magnoliophyta. Tissues were fixed in a caffeine-glutaraldehyde mixture and examined by TEM. Other fresh samples were incubated with primary antibodies against proteins from both chloroplastic envelopes and a thylakoidal chlorophyll-carrying protein; they were also incubated with gelatin-Oregon Green, a fluorescent marker of condensed tannins. Coupled spectral analyses of chlorophyll and tannins were carried out by confocal microscopy on fresh tissues and tannin-rich accretions obtained through cell fractionation; chemical analyses of tannins and chlorophylls were also performed on the accretions. Key Results and Conclusions The presence of the three different chloroplast membranes inside vacuolar accretions that constitute the typical form of tannin storage in vascular plants was established in fresh tissues as well as in purified organelles, using several independent methods. Tannins are polymerized in a new chloroplast-derived organelle, the tannosome. These are formed by pearling of the thylakoids into 30 nm spheres, which are then encapsulated in a tannosome shuttle formed by budding from the chloroplast and bound by a membrane resulting from the fusion of both chloroplast envelopes. The shuttle conveys numerous tannosomes through the cytoplasm towards the vacuole in which it is then incorporated by invagination of the tonoplast. Finally, shuttles bound by a portion of tonoplast aggregate into tannin accretions which are stored in the vacuole. Polymerization of tannins occurs inside the tannosome regardless of the compartment being crossed. A complete sequence of events apparently valid in all studied <b>Tracheophyta</b> is described...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The tannosome, an {{organelle}} producing condensed tannins in the chlorophyllous {{organs of}} the Tracheohyta, is formed from the unstacked granal thylakoids by pearling into tiny spheres [1]. Other variants of intraplastidial ontogenesis of the tannosomes were investigated in the <b>Tracheophyta</b> by transmission electron microscopy. The “pearl necklace ” model consists {{in the formation}} of vaguely ellipsoidal loculi by inflation of the intrathylakoidal lumen in which emerge, bound to the inner face of the lumen, “pear necklace”-shaped suites of osmiophilic spheres (30 nm); once filled with tannins, these loculi can be described as giant tannosomes bound by a single thylakoidal membrane. In the “snail ” model, the granal thylakoids whirl upon themselves while pearling tannosomes which remain, in the stroma, aggregated in vaguely spherical osmiophilic structures. While in the former model [1], numerous isolated tannosomes are packed in a shuttle, the aggregated tannosomes (“pearl necklace ” and “snail ” models) are ejected from the chloroplast by budding into shuttles...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} promote the {{accessibility}} of biodiversity data in historic and contemporary literature, we introduce a new interdisciplinary project called BIOfid (FID=Fachinformationsdienst, a service for providing specialized information). The project aims at a mobilization of data available in print only by combining digitization of scientific biodiversity literature {{with the development of}} innovative text mining tools for complex, eventually semantic searches throughout the complete text corpus. A major prerequisite for the development of such search tools is the provision of sophisticated anatomy ontologies on the one hand, and of complete lists of species names (currently considered valid as well as all synonyms) at a global scale on the other hand. In the initial stage, we chose examples from German publications of the past 250 years dealing with the geographic distribution and ecology of vascular plants (<b>Tracheophyta),</b> birds (Aves), as well as moths and butterflies (Lepidoptera) in Germany. These taxa have been prioritized according to current demands of German research groups (about 50 sites) aiming at analyses and modeling of distribution patterns and their changes through time. In the long term, we aim at providing data and open source software applicable for any taxon and geographic region. For this purpose, a platform for open access journals for long-term availability of professional e-journals will be established.

The three GS gene families (GSI, GSII, and GSIII) are represented in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. In this study, we examined the evolutionary relationship of GSII from eubacterial and eukaryotic lineages and present robust phylogenetic evidence that GSII was transferred from γ-Proteobacteria (Eubacteria) to the Chloroplastida. Results GSII sequences were isolated from four species of green algae (Trebouxiophyceae), and additional green algal (Chlorophyceae and Prasinophytae) and streptophyte (Charales, Desmidiales, Bryophyta, Marchantiophyta, Lycopodiophyta and <b>Tracheophyta)</b> sequences were obtained from public databases. In Bayesian and maximum likelihood analyses, eubacterial (GSII B) and eukaryotic (GSII E) GSII sequences formed distinct clades. Both GSII B and GSII E were found in chlorophytes and early-diverging streptophytes. The GSII B enzymes from these groups formed a well-supported sister clade with the γ-Proteobacteria, providing evidence that GSII B in the Chloroplastida arose by horizontal gene transfer (HGT). Bayesian relaxed molecular clock analyses suggest that GSII B and GSII E coexisted {{for an extended period}} of time but it is unclear whether the proposed HGT happened prior to or after the divergence of the primary endosymbiotic lineages (the Archaeplastida). However, GSII B genes have not been identified in glaucophytes or red algae, favoring the hypothesis that GSII B was gained after the divergence of the primary endosymbiotic lineages. Duplicate copies of the GSII B gene were present in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, Volvox carteri f. nagariensis, and Physcomitrella patens. Both GSII B proteins in C. reinhardtii and V. carteri f. nagariensis had N-terminal transit sequences, indicating they are targeted to the chloroplast or mitochondrion.

GSII B sequences were absent in vascular plants where the duplication of GSII E replaced the function of GSII B.

40|$|An {{analysis}} of the anthophilous fauna of N. W. Europe is presented, stressing the role plants play for insects. The study is based on some 29, 000 relations between about 2, 600 insect species and 1, 300 plant species (569 genera). The data are derived from our database (“CrypTra”) of biotic relations between Cryptobiota and <b>Tracheophyta,</b> {{that is based on}} published sources. It is suggested that a ratio of 2 to 5 anthophilous insect species per entomophilous plant species is the rule in N. W. Europe, where other types of zoophily are virtually absent. A small minority of the plant species/genera play a disproportionally important role as hosts to flower visitors; many of these so-called cornucopian taxa belong to the commonest entomophilous plants in the region, and occur also in moderately disturbed habitats. There is a significant positive correlation between the commonness of a plant species and the fraction this plant represents of the trophic resources exploited by an insect species. There is, on the other hand, a significant negative correlation between the number of insect species visiting a given plant species, and the number of plant species visited by a given insect species. These two elements together demonstrate that the anthophilous fauna and the entomophilous flora of N. W. Europe as a whole form a loose system, not predominantly characterised by specialisation. In accordance with this, factor analysis suggests that there is no ground to recognise more than three visitor types, viz., the allotropous, hemitropous, and eutropous visitors as defined by Loew. A minority of the plant taxa – essentially the cornucopian ones – can with some difficulty be associated with these three types of visitors, and a very few narrowly specialised plant taxa can be associated with more specific visitor groups. However, the large majority of plants cannot be fitted in any typology. These results have practical implications for the nature management of the anthophilous fauna, in that the important role of the cornucopian floral element is underlined. The fact {{that the majority of the}} cornucopian species are perennial, or even woody, places constraints to agricultural practices intended to foster beneficial anthophilous insects...|$|E
40|$|More than 20 years ago, the French Muséum National d'Histoire Naturelle 1 (MNHN, Secretariat of the Fauna and Flora) {{published}} {{the first part}} of an atlas of the flora of France at a 20 km spatial resolution, accounting for 645 taxa (Dupont 1990). Since then, at the national level, there has not been any work on this scale relating to flora distribution, despite the obvious need for a better understanding. In 2011, in response to this need, the Federation des Conservatoires Botaniques Nationaux 2 (FCBN, [URL] launched an ambitious collaborative project involving eleven national botanical conservatories of France. The project aims to establish a formal procedure and standardized system for data hosting, aggregation and publication for four areas: flora, fungi, vegetation and habitats. In 2014, {{the first phase of the}} project led to the development of the national flora dataset: SIFlore. As it includes about 21 million records of flora occurrences, this is currently the most comprehensive dataset on the distribution of vascular plants (<b>Tracheophyta)</b> in the French territory. SIFlore contains information for about 15 ' 454 plant taxa occurrences (indigenous and alien taxa) in metropolitan France and Reunion Island, from 1545 until 2014. The data records were originally collated from inventories, checklists, literature and herbarium records. SIFlore was developed by assembling flora datasets from the regional to the national level. At the regional level, source records are managed by the national botanical conservatories that are responsible for flora data collection and validation. In order to present our results, a geoportal was developed by the Fédération des conservatoires botaniques nationaux that allows the SIFlore dataset to be publically viewed. This portal is available at: [URL] As the FCBN belongs to the Information System for Nature and Landscapes' (SINP), a governmental program, the dataset is also accessible through the websites of the National Inventory of Natural Heritage ([URL] and the Global Biodiversity Information Facility ([URL] SIFlore is regularly updated with additional data records. It is also planned to expand the scope of the dataset to include information about taxon biology, phenology, ecology, chorology, frequency, conservation status and seed banks. A map showing an estimation of the dataset completeness (based on Jackknife 1 estimator) is presented and included as a numerical appendix. Purpose: SIFlore aims to make the data of the flora of France available at the national level for conservation, policy management and scientific research. Such a dataset will provide enough information to allow for macro-ecological reviews of species distribution patterns and, coupled with climatic or topographic datasets, the identification of determinants of these patterns. This dataset can be considered as the primary indicator of the current state of knowledge of flora distribution across France. At a policy level, and in the context of global warming, this should promote the adoption of new measures aiming to improve and intensify flora conservation and surveys...|$|E
