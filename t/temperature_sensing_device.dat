Complex cubic perovskite oxide ceramics have a great advantage in terms of their varied physico-chemical characteristics with the substitution of structural elements in the respective formula units. In this context, we have produced Ba 2 AlSnO 5. 5 ceramics by solid state reaction process. Structural characteristics, studied by powder x-diffraction, reveal that Ba 2 AlSnO 5. 5 ceramic has an ordered complex cubic perovskite structure. Ba 2 AlSnO 5; 5 ceramics were sintered in the form of circular discs of 10 and 15 mm diameters and 2 mm thickness, in the temperature 1200 to 14000 C by normal sintering process.

40|$|The {{electron}} transport {{properties of}} {{two types of}} carbon-polyimide (C-PI) nanocomposite thin films have been evaluated. Conductive nanocomposites formed by incorporation of 30 nm carbon particles prior to polymer cross linking (ex situ formation) {{has been compared to}} high energy ion beam irradiation in situ formation of nanoscale carbon clusters within the polymer composite. Addition of carbon nanoparticles were able to reduce the resistivity by 13 orders of magnitude for 8 vol% carbon content. The irradiated in situ formed film showed a comparable resistivity to this 8 % C-PI film. All the films exhibited negative temperature coefficient of resistance (NTCR) behaviour. While in the ex situ films the NTCR decreased progressively with increasing temperature above 350 K, the in situ film exhibited a constant NTCR value at ambient as well as elevated temperatures indicating that films formed by ion beam irradiation eliminate possible clustering of nanoparticles prior to crosslinking seen in the ex situ films. The optimum hop energies for the ex situ films ranged from 23. 1 to 8. 05 meV when carbon content increased from 1 to 8 vol% and the corresponding value for the in situ formed film was 34. 94 meV.

40|$|Recently {{proposed}} flight {{research at}} NASA Dryden Flight Research Center (DFRC) has prompted study into the aerodynamic effects of modifications {{made to the}} surfaces of laminar airfoils. The research {{is focused on the}} high-aspect ratio, laminar-flow type wings commonly found on UAVs and other aircraft with a high endurance requirement. A broad range of instrumentation possibilities, such as structural, pressure, and <b>temperature</b> <b>sensing</b> <b>devices</b> may require the alteration of the airfoil outer mold line as part of the installation process. This study attempts to characterize the effect of installing this additiona 1 instrumentation on key airfoil performance factors, such as transition location, lift and drag curves, and stall point. In particular, the general case of an airfoil that is channeled in the spanwise direction is considered, and the impact on key performance characteristics is assessed. Particular attention is focused on exploring the limits of channel depth and low-Reynolds number on performance and stall characteristics. To quantify the effect of increased skin friction due to premature transition caused by protruding or recessed instrumentation, two simplified, conservative scenarios are used to consider two potential sources of diaturbance: A) that leading edge alterations would cause linearly expanding areas (triangles) of turbulent flow on both surfaces of the wing upstream of the natural transition point, and B) that a channel or bump on the upper surface would trip turbulent flow across the whole upper surface upstream of the natural transition point. A potentially more important consideration than the skin friction drag increment is the change in overall airfoil performance due to the installation of instrumentation along most of the wingspan. To quantify this effect, 2 D CFD simulations of the flow over a representative mid-span airfoil section were conducted in order to assess the change in lift and drag curves for the airfoil in the presence of disturbed flow due to the installed instrumentation.

40|$|This {{engineering}} note {{documents the}} installation of two temperature sensing RTD's in the BC's. Previously, the <b>temperature</b> <b>sensing</b> <b>device</b> used in all three cryostats consisted of a FNAL designed liquid sensing probe (see EN- 168, and drawing ME- 273505). This device was necessary because of the concern that overfilling LN 2 into the main vent line during cooldown could create an undesirable back pressure on the relief valves or rupture disks. This could possibly hinder the relieving of argon gas at the required flow rate in a safety situation. The probe was installed on the CC, and has been operating perfectly, therefore, this probe will not be changed. Figure 1 shows the location of TS 232 E, the CC liquid sensing probe. Note that the probe is located downstream of the condenser outlet valve (PV 210 N), therefore, it effectively operates under atmospheric pressure. On the BC's, however, the probe was originally installed at a different location, upstream of the condenser outlet valve (PV 110 N or PV 310 N). This resulted in the probe effectively sensing the condenser pressure, which varied from approximately 30 psia to 60 psia during cooldown. The changing pressure meant that the corresponding temperature at which liquid appeared also changed. The probe then became inaccurate, especially at higher condenser pressures, when the probe would be fail to trip at the higher liquid temperature. The solution was to replace the original probe with an RTD. This involved using the PLC to compare the temperature sensed by the RTD to the liquid saturation temperature, calculated using the measured condenser pressure. A formula was created to calculate the saturation temperature from the condenser pressure. This formula was derived by curve fitting points taken from the NBS Technical Note 129 for nitrogen. A 2 nd order equation was used to fit the points, since the accuracy was not very important for temperature comparison. The entire equation was then shifted so that the curve was above all of the actual points. This was done {{to insure that the}} formula would provide higher temperatures, so the comparison to the RTD would be conservative, switching before the temperature reached saturation. Figure 2 shows the curve used to fit the data points. The lower curve is the actual data, and the higher curve is the formula to be used. Using the formula derived, the PLC calculates a conservative saturation temperature from the condenser pressure. The condenser pressure is measured by PT 110 N or PT 310 N, on the ECN and ECS, respectively. The transmitters are Rosemount 0 - 75 psia pressure transmitters. The PLC then compares the calculated temperature to the measured temperature from the RTD's, EIl 32 E and EI 332 E, which are Omega platinum RTD probes, model PR- 14 - 2 - 100 - 1 / 4 - 12 -E. If the measured temperature drops below the calculated saturation temperature, an alarm signals on the view page, and the PLC automatically closes the two inlet condenser valves (PV 101 N and PV 102 N, or PV 301 N and PV 302 N). As a final note, there are various advantages and disadvantages to using the RTD's instead of the original probe. The advantages are that the RTD's provide constant monitoring of the temperature, whereas the probe was basically designed as a switch. The RTD's are more accurate in that they can respond over the range of the condenser pressure. The probe was designed to operate under atmospheric pressure. The only disadvantage of the RTD's is that they sense temperature, therefore, they cannot distinguish saturated GN 2 from liquid, while the probe was designed specifically to do so. Overall, however, the RTD's provide an acceptable {{solution to the problem of}} liquid sensing in the vent line. Figure 3 shows the final location of the RTD on the ECN. The ECS location is the same...|$|E

The m-MZI {{is comprised of}} a section of photonic crystal fiber integrated with two independent cores of distinct construction and birefringence properties characterized for torsion, strain and <b>temperature</b> <b>sensing.</b> Due {{to the presence of}} small core geometry and use of a short fiber length, the <b>sensing</b> <b>device</b> demonstrates inter-modal interference in the small core alongside the dominant inter-core interference between the cores for each of the orthogonal polarizations. The output spectrum of the device is characterized by the three-beam interference model and is polarization-dependent. The two types of interferometers present in the fiber m-MZI exhibit distinct sensitivities to torsion, strain and temperature for different polarizations, and matrix coefficients allowing simultaneous measurement of the three sensing parameters are proposed in experiment...|$|R
