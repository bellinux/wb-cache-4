500|$|In an {{interview}} with Kerrang!, Jesse Lacey commented on the upcoming album's content, [...] "It's a pretty exhausting record. It's quite dense and I {{think some of the}} decisions we made don't always go in the most obvious direction. We were thinking a lot more about what we'd want to play when we were up onstage rather than actually what you'd want to hear on a record." [...] He then questioned the future of the band, saying, [...] "I {{think a lot of the}} record is about us trying to make decisions about how long the band should go on. When I listened back to it, I realized how many songs are about something coming to a close, or knowing when it's time <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>something</b> away and move on." ...|$|E

500|$|Wednesday 13 {{explained}} the album's inspiration in an interview: [...] "Wednesday 13 (the band) has a live DVD that I put {{out and we}} couldn't think of a title and we were driving down the road thinking, {{we are going to}} have to come up with a name for it. The live titles, you have <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>something</b> like that. So, we were watching Bill O'Reilly and we kept listening to him say, 'Fuck it, we'll do it live.' That's kind of how quick we threw that DVD together. We didn't know we were putting it together like 4 days before so we were like, 'fuck it, we'll do it live.' We didn't do any overdubs on it, everybody in the band was sick and we just went with it." ...|$|E
500|$|Writing for Rough Guides in 2006, Chris Ingham said Harrison was [...] "rightly annoyed" [...] {{with his}} former record company. Ingham added that, with the [...] "excellent Volume II" [...] (Best of Dark Horse 1976–1989) no longer in print, The Best of George Harrison was {{therefore}} the artist's only available compilation album and [...] "hardly a satisfying one-stop sampler". Reviewing Let It Roll for the music website Popdose, in 2009, Jon Cummings wrote that [...] "the compilation gods have never been kind to [...] " [...] and described the 1976 album as [...] "downright insulting". In her role as compiler of Let It Roll, Harrison's widow Olivia said of The Best of George Harrison: [...] "That album always bothered me... I just thought that is really not fair and I think we have <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>something</b> in that place, and that's really what this [...] is." ...|$|E
500|$|That {{night at}} the Marott Hotel, Kennedy hosted a meeting with 14 local black leaders. The meeting had been {{arranged}} before the assassination by aide James Tolan and took place in Tolan's room. The group had debated among themselves {{as to whether they}} should hold the meeting. Kennedy eventually arrived, and the conversation quickly became heated as leaders accused him of being an unreliable member of [...] "the white establishment." [...] He lost his temper, saying, [...] "I don't need all this aggravation. I could sit next to my swimming pool. You know, God's been good to me and I really don't need anything. But I just feel that if He's been that good, I should try <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>something</b> back in. And you all call yourselves leaders and you've been moaning and groaning about personal problems. You haven't once talked about your own people." [...] The meeting ended with most attendees pledging their support to Kennedy's campaign. One of them later acknowledged that Kennedy was [...] "completely sympathetic and understanding".|$|E

The project was started in 1996, inspired by the publication of the first draft of Elizabeth’s Mid-Montane Wetland guide.

500|$|De Vries, who {{had worked}} on the demo, asked Orbit to help produce the song, and was enlisted. According to [...] writer Lucy O'Brien, De Vries and Orbit had {{originally}} composed and produced the track before Ray of Light had been conceived. During the sessions, Orbit found De Vries' contribution [...] "off-putting", to which the latter confessed, [...] "On all the collaborations I'd left {{a lot of space}} for him, but for this I wanted <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>something</b> on the table and say, 'This is what I think'". De Vries had added electronic noise frequencies during the first chorus of the song, stating that he had a [...] "vision on how the song should be finished". Orbit did not like the addition since it sounded to him that the [...] "DAT's broken". De Vries defended his contribution saying that {{it was supposed to be}} [...] "like that [...] It's quite slow for a dance tune of that nature, not a pacey tune." [...] Madonna had enjoyed all three of their contributions to the track, and as a result, Orbit reluctantly left it on. In J. Randy Taraborrelli's book , the singer said that the main inspiration behind [...] "Nothing Really Matters" [...] and [...] "The Power of Good-Bye" [...] from the same album, was other people judging and dissecting her creative process.

2500|$|Chief Flying Hawk once visited {{some of the}} {{survivors}} of the Seneca tribe in New York State and had great admiration for their great Chiefs Cornplanter and Red Jacket.

When McCreight informed Flying Hawk that Cornplanter’s father was white and was raised by his Seneca mother, [...] "The Chief said with a smile, That is why he amounted to something."

2500|$|The {{band was}} accused by a California {{religious}} group {{and later the}} Parents Music Resource Center of backmasking Satanic messages in their anti-cocaine anthem, [...] "Snowblind". James Young has denied this charge during his introduction for [...] "Snowblind" [...] when played live. Dennis DeYoung has denied the accusation as well, joking on the In the Studio with Redbeard program [...] "we had enough trouble to make the music sound right forward." [...] Also, James Young quotes, [...] "If we were going <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>something</b> Satanic in our songs, we would have put it so {{it was in the}} song forward. Not so you would have to buy some $400 tape recorder to hear it." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a June 2016 {{interview}} with Rolling Stone, Stefani expressed uncertainty {{with the future}} of No Doubt. [...] "I don't know what's {{going to happen with}} No Doubt. When Tony [...] and I are connected creatively, it's magic. But I think we've grown apart as far as what kind of music we want to make. I was really drained and burned out when we recorded that album [...] And I had a lot of guilt: 'I have to do it.' That's not the right setting to make music. There's some really great writing on that record. But the production felt really conflicted. It was sad how we all waited that long <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>something</b> out and it didn't get heard." ...|$|E

2500|$|In mid-2009, Epic {{ended their}} {{contract}} with Norwood following {{the appointment of}} Amanda Ghost, making Human her only album with the label. A Los Angeles Times article later revealed Norwood's discontent {{with the success of}} the project the following year when asked about the commercial failure of Human: [...] "It was lacking my belief in it. It lacked my vision. Pretty much bottom line, if you don't believe in something it's not going to go," [...] she said. [...] "So do I believe that Human was as creative as Never Say Never and Full Moon? No, I do not. You definitely want <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>something</b> out that's like that. I felt at the same time I could have had much better songs and a much better set-up." [...] A statement she made during a 2010 interview with Out magazine turned out more harsh: [...] "To hell with that album! [...] Where I felt creatively it could've gone and the space I was in creatively, I needed everybody around me to be in that same space. It would've been a different album, but with the same inspiration and same blessing for other people. It would've been hotter music and a hotter look." ...|$|E
