30|$|Sixty-one {{participants}} were enrolled {{over a period}} of 6  months (49.2  % male, with a mean age 66.8). Forty-seven of the 61 patients had a B-profile. The median NT-proBNP level in the patients with B-profile was 6200, compared with the mean level in the patients with an A-profile of 180 (CI 0.33 – 0.82). The distributions in the two groups differed significantly (p =  0.034). Based on a threshold level of NT-proBNP in relation to age, the sensitivity and specificity (including the 95  % confidence interval) were determined; the sensitivity of finding B-profile on ultrasound was 92.0  %, and the specificity was 91.0  %.

By 18 June, Hitler and Ribbentrop {{spoke of the}} Plan with Italian leader Benito Mussolini as a possibility that could be pursued after the defeat of France. Once he learned of the plan, SS-Obergruppenführer Reinhard Heydrich, chief of the Reich Main Security Office (RSHA), insisted that Ribbentrop relinquish any future responsibility for the Plan to that office. As Heydrich had been appointed by Göring in January 1939 to oversee Jewish evacuation from German-occupied territory, the Jewish question was hence under his purview. Adolf Eichmann, head of the RSHA Sub-Department IV-B4, which dealt with Jewish affairs and evacuation, soon became involved. On 15 August, he released a memorandum titled Reichssicherheitshauptamt: Madagaskar Projekt (Reich Main Security Office: Madagascar Project), calling for the resettlement of a million Jews per year {{for four years and}} abandoning the idea of retaining any Jews in Europe. The RSHA, he emphasized, would control all aspects of the program. While Rademacher called for the colony to be under German control but self-governing under Jewish administration, Eichmann made it plain that he intended for the SS to control and oversee every aspect of life on the island, which they would govern as a police state.|$|E

Though Sanford enjoyed some support for his effort, most of the faculty were against the proposal, the largest concern being that the facility would be a monument to Nixon rather than a center of study. Sanford tried to engineer a compromise, but the proposal by the Duke Academic Council of a library only a third the size of that which Nixon wanted and their rejection of a Nixon museum to accompany it, ultimately led Nixon to decline Sanford's offer and site his library in the city of his birth, Yorba Linda, California, instead; it was dedicated there in 1990.|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{performance}} of <b>the</b> <b>subjects</b> <b>with</b> above-knee amputation is noticeably poorer than normal subjects. Various types of components {{have been designed}} to compensate their performance. Among various prosthetic components, the knee joint has great influence on the function. Two types of knee joints (3 R 15, 3 R 20) have been used broadly for above-knee prostheses. However, there is not enough research to highlight the influence of these joints on the gait {{performance of}} <b>the</b> <b>subjects.</b> Therefore, an aim of this research was to investigate the performance of the above-knee amputees while walking with 3 R 15 and 3 R 20 knee joints. Materials and Methods: 7 above-knee amputees were recruited in this research study. They were asked to walk with a comfortable speed to investigate the gait function of <b>the</b> <b>subjects</b> <b>with</b> 3 cameras 3 D motion analysis system (Kinematrix system). The difference between the performances of <b>the</b> <b>subjects</b> <b>with</b> these joints was compared by use of paired t-test. Results: The results of this study showed that, the performances of <b>the</b> <b>subjects</b> <b>with</b> 3 R 20 were better than that with 3 R 15. The walking speed of <b>the</b> <b>subjects</b> <b>with</b> 3 R 20 was 66. 7 m/min compared to 30. 4 m/min (P-value = 0. 045).

40|$|Backgroud : Both alcohol {{consumption}} and the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK 9) gene polymorphism modulate serum lipid levels, but their interactions on serum lipid profiles are still unknown. The {{present study was}} undertaken to detect the interactions of PCSK 9 E 670 G polymorphism and {{alcohol consumption}} on serum lipid levels. Methods : Genotypes of the PCSK 9 E 670 G in 1352 unrelated subjects (785 non-drinkers and 567 drinkers) were determined by polymerase chain reaction and {{restriction fragment length polymorphism}} combined with gel electrophoresis, and then confirmed by direct sequencing. The interactions between PCSK 9 E 670 G genotypes and alcohol consumption on serum lipid parameters were detected by using a factorial design covariance analysis after controlling for potential confounders. Results : The levels of serum triglyceride, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, apolipoprotein (Apo) A 1, and the ratio of ApoA 1 to ApoB were higher in drinkers than in non-drinkers (P &# 60; 0. 01 for all), whereas the levels of total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and ApoB were lower in drinkers than in non-drinkers (P &# 60; 0. 001 for all). The genotypic and allelic frequencies of PCSK 9 E 670 G were not different between non-drinkers and drinkers (P &# 62; 0. 05 for each). <b>The</b> <b>subjects</b> <b>with</b> AA genotype in non-drinkers had higher serum LDL-C levels than <b>the</b> <b>subjects</b> <b>with</b> AG genotype, whereas <b>the</b> <b>subjects</b> <b>with</b> AG genotype in drinkers had higher serum TC levels than <b>the</b> <b>subjects</b> <b>with</b> AA genotypes (P &# 60; 0. 05 for each).

40|$|AbstractThresholds for discriminating the {{orientation}} of unreferenced horizontal and vertical lines were measured in <b>subjects</b> <b>with</b> congenital nystagmus (CN) and normal observers and compared to the variability of torsional eye position. Orientation thresholds were determined for horizontal and vertical lines between 0. 7 ° and 5. 6 ° in length, that were presented binocularly for 20 – 1280 ms. The variability of torsional eye position was assessed using the magnetic search coil technique. Orientation thresholds improved with line length and stimulus duration in both groups of observers. Some of <b>the</b> <b>subjects</b> <b>with</b> CN exhibited poorer than normal thresholds, particularly when {{the length of the}} line was short. In addition, orientation discrimination in <b>the</b> <b>subjects</b> <b>with</b> CN was consistently anisotropic, with significantly lower thresholds for horizontal than vertical lines. The standard deviations of torsional eye position were larger in <b>the</b> <b>subjects</b> <b>with</b> CN than in normal observers. However, orientation thresholds were poorer than expected from the variability of torsional eye position in normal observers, and better than expected on the basis of torsional variability in some of <b>the</b> <b>subjects</b> <b>with</b> CN. These results imply that torsional variability does not limit normal orientation thresholds and that torsional eye movements in CN are compensated partially by extraretinal signals...|$|R

The aim of this population-based study was to compare HGS among <b>the</b> <b>subjects</b> <b>with</b> and without COPD, to evaluate HGS in relation to COPD severity, and to evaluate the impact of heart disease. Subjects and methods: Data were collected from the Obstructive Lung disease in Northern Sweden COPD study, where <b>the</b> <b>subjects</b> <b>with</b> and without COPD {{have been invited to}} annual examinations since 2005.
