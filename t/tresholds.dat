40|$|In {{this study}} we use hedonic models to measure the {{influence}} of noise nuisance on rents, costs and values of investment properties in Switzerland. Countrywide data is provided by institutional real estate investors. The effects are measured for aircraft noise, road traffic noise and railroad noise. We show that negative effects appear between lower and upper <b>tresholds</b> which vary between different noise types and across residential and non-residential properties. Rents, costs and values are affected below the administrative <b>tresholds</b> given by the LSV and the negative impact ceases at an upper threshold. However high noise nuisance might influence investment decisions, i. e. offices are built instead of housing etc. These important effects are not given account in the data. In addition, directly measured reductions on market values are lower than the expected reductions based on empirical effects on rents and costs. The reasons for the different market value reductions {{may be found in}} the Swiss tenancy law. Rents for dwellings within existing rental agreements can only be adjusted in accordance with the change of the "reference interest rate" (Referenzzinssatz) and the CPI. The analysis shows that the average contract duration is dependent on the noise nuisance, which leads to a significant reduction of noise-induced losses within periods of increasing market rents...|$|E

Methods: The change in pressure pain threshold and vibrotactile <b>treshold</b> was taken from the area above myofascial trigger point number one trapezius muscle - pars ascendens, and the vibration <b>treshold</b> at dorsum of metacarpal bone of the index finger. Fifty myofascial trigger points were examined (twenty-four from a group of probands with chronic cervicalgia or cervicobrachialgia syndrome, twenty-six in the control group). Results: The pressure pain threshold and vibrotactile threshold did not change after the PIR in the group of patients. But the threshold of vibration sense significantly decreased (nearly by 18 %, p = 0. 001). The result was opposite in the control group. Pressure pain threshold increased by 11 % (p < 0. 001) and vibrotactile threshold fell by almost 16 % (p = 0. 001). Vibration threshold did not change. Conclusions: The study confirmed that PIR can affect not only the pressure pain <b>treshold,</b> but also vibrotactile and even vibration <b>treshold.</b> PIR revealed an alteration to pain perception, vibrotactile and vibratin sensation in the group of patients.

This paper presents an approach of non-collocated active structural acoustic control of transient noise, {{produced by a}} repetitive impact excitation. Although {{there is a significant}} difference in nature between periodic and transient noise, up till now no specific research on active control of transient noise was reported. The presented research focuses on the development of time-invariant and learning feedback control algorithms, dedicated for the control of structural transient noise. A first research approach is to reduce the impact noise, generated by repetitive hammer impacts on a plate, by applying control forces on the plate. The effectiveness of the controllers is tested in simulation on a model of the plate as well as experimentally on a real plate set-up. In the future, this approach will be validated on machine structures. ...|$|E

The subject of the research was trigger point in upper fibers of m. trapezius. Vibration sensitivity (vibration extinction threshold) a bove trigger point was measured using graduated Rydel - Seiffer tuning fork 64 Hz, its sensitivity was measured by pressure sensitivity (threshold of pressure sensitivity) using a palpometer. Following postizometric relaxation reduced this sensitivity. Thus treshold of pressure sensitivity was increased but perception of vibration above trigger point was not influenced substantially. Thus decrease of its sensitivity did not substantially influence perception of vibration above it. In the case of people with soreness of neck longer than 6 months, decreased vibration extinction threshold and <b>tresholds</b> of pressure sensitivity of examined trigger point were found.

This prospective study included a total of 50 patients, which after strict exclusion critera (audiologic problems before RT, primary tumors of the auditory system, spread of the primary tumor to any part of the auditory system) resulted in 23 analyzed patients, ranging between 50 and 76 years of age, with a mean age of 60. Audiometry measuring frequency-specific thresholds was performed in three time points: one month before radiotherapy, one and six months after radiotherapy. A significant statistical difference in hearing <b>tresholds</b> after radiotherapy was found in 6 out of 23 patients. An obvious tendency towards hearing loss without statistical significance at 250 and 4000 Hz was found for a whole tested population (p≤ 0. 3 with Bonferroni correction). Observed tendency towards hearing loss after radiotherapy of laryngeal carcinoma was related to side of the tumor and less severe when chemotherapy was not added as adjuvant therapy.

40|$|Abstract. Aims. We {{present a}} {{systematic}} theoretical study on 40 {{polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons}} dications (PAHs ++) containing up to 66 carbon atoms. Methods. We performed our calculations using well established quantum–chemical techniques {{in the framework of}} the density functional theory (DFT) to obtain the electronic ground–state properties, and of the time–dependent DFT (TD–DFT) to evaluate the excited–state properties. Results. For each PAH ++ considered we computed the absolute visible–UV photo–absorption cross–section up to about 30 eV. We also evaluated their vibrational properties and compared them to those of the corresponding neutral and singly–ionised species. We estimated the adiabatic and vertical second ionisation energy∆I through total energy differences. Conclusions. The∆I values obtained fall in the energy range 8 – 13 eV, confirming that PAHs could reach the doubly–ionised state in HI regions. The total integrated IR absorption cross–sections show a marked increase upon ionization, being on the average about two and five times larger for PAHs ++ than for PAHs + and PAHs, respectively. The visible–UV photo–absorption cross–sections for the 0,+ 1 and+ 2 charge–states show comparable features but PAHs ++ are found to absorb slightly less than their parent neutrals and singly ionized species between ∼ 7 and ∼ 12 eV.
