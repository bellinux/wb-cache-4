5|$|John Boscawen of the Act Party {{commented that}} the NZ ETS was a grand experiment, without {{precedent}} in any other nation in the world.

Boscawen called for the NZ ETS to be scrapped or delayed indefinitely.|$|E
5|$|Walter revived <b>the</b> <b>scheme</b> <b>of</b> his predecessor, Baldwin of Forde, {{to found}} a church in Canterbury that would be secular and not monastic. He promised that the new foundation's canons {{would not be allowed}} to vote in archiepiscopal {{elections}} nor would the body of Saint Thomas Becket ever be moved to the new church, but the monks of his cathedral chapter were suspicious and appealed to the papacy. The dispute from the time of Baldwin of Forde flared up again, with the papacy supporting the monks and the king supporting the archbishop. Finally, Pope Innocent III ruled for the monks and ordered Walter to destroy what had been built.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Both <b>the</b> {{difference}} <b>scheme</b> <b>of</b> Richardson and <b>the</b> difference <b>scheme</b> <b>of</b> Crank-Nicolson is {{a difference}} scheme with second order of approximation. <b>The</b> two-step difference <b>scheme</b> <b>of</b> Richardson is explicit but unstable and <b>the</b> one-step difference <b>scheme</b> <b>of</b> Crank-Nicolson is stable but implicit. The explicit numerical methods are preferable for parallel computations. An explicit two-step second order accurate difference scheme for parabolic equations is constructed in this paper by combination <b>of</b> <b>the</b> difference <b>scheme</b> <b>of</b> Richardson and <b>the</b> difference <b>scheme</b> <b>of</b> Crank-Nicolson. Restriction {{of the value of}} time step for stability <b>of</b> this difference <b>scheme</b> is similar to the restriction which is necessary for stability of one-step explicit difference scheme.

5|$|According to St Petersburg {{psychiatrist}} Vladimir Pshizov, {{a disastrous}} factor for domestic psychiatry {{is that those}} who had committed the crime against humanity were allowed to stay on their positions until they can leave this world in a natural way. Those who retained their positions and influence turned domestic psychiatry from politically motivated one to criminally motivated one because the sphere of interests of this public {{has been reduced to}} making a business of psychopharmacologic drugs and taking possession of the homes of the ill. In Soviet times, all the heads of departments of psychiatry, all the directors of psychiatric research institutes, all the head doctors of psychiatric hospitals were the CPSU nomenklatura, which they remained so far. The representative of nomenklatura in psychiatry had <b>the</b> <b>scheme</b> <b>of</b> career that is simple and often stereotyped: for one to two years, he run errands as a resident, then joined the party and became a partgrouporg. His junior colleagues (usually non-partisan ones) collected and processed material for his dissertation. Its review of literature, particularly in a research institute for psychiatry, was often written by patients, because only they knew foreign languages, and their party comrades were not up to it, the natural habitat did not stimulate learning a foreign language.|$|E
5|$|In 1266, {{conflict}} between the Hohenstaufen house and the Papacy led to Sicily's conquest by Charles I, Duke of Anjou. With the usurpation of the Sicilian throne from Conradin by Manfred of Sicily in 1258, {{the relationship between the}} Papacy and the Hohenstaufen had changed again. Instead of the boy Conradin, safely sequestered across the Alps, the Papacy now faced an able military leader who had greatly supported the Ghibelline cause at the battle of Montaperti in 1260. Accordingly, when negotiations broke down with Manfred in 1262, Pope Urban IV again took up <b>the</b> <b>scheme</b> <b>of</b> disseising the Hohenstaufen from the kingdom, and offered the crown to Charles of Anjou again. With Papal and Guelph support Charles descended into Italy and defeated Manfred at the battle of Benevento in 1266 and in 1268 Conradin at the battle of Taglicozzo.|$|E
5|$|In response, a large American 'search-and-destroy' {{operation}} {{was launched in}} January 1966, involving more the 8,000 troops commanded by the US 1st Infantry Division under Major General Jonathan O. Seaman, including the US 3rd Infantry Brigade, 1st Infantry Division and the US 173rd Airborne Brigade, which {{was attached to the}} division for the operation; in total six battalions plus supporting arms. Still attached to the US 173rd Airborne Brigade was the Australian battalion, 1 RAR—now commanded by Preece—with 105 Field Battery in direct support, as well as engineers from 3rd Field Troop, Royal Australian Engineers and the M113s from the Prince of Wales Light Horse. At the time it was the largest military operation mounted in South Vietnam, being the first divisional offensive to date. Preceded by a heavy aerial bombardment, <b>the</b> <b>scheme</b> <b>of</b> manoeuvre envisioned an airmobile assault by the US 173rd Brigade in the north and west, while the US 3rd Infantry Brigade would seal off the area to the south, in preparation for a sweep designed to push trapped communist forces eastwards against the Saigon River. 1 RAR's role was to establish a blocking position in a village beside the river on the northern flank of the brigade's area of operations.|$|E

5|$|Little {{is known}} about the Beirut law school's {{curriculum}} before the 5th century. The Scholia Sinaitica and the Scholia to the Basilica provide glimpses of the school's teaching method, comparable to the method of rhetoric schools at the time. The lecturer would discuss and analyze juridic texts by adding his own comments, which included references to analogous passages from imperial constitutions or from the works of prominent classical Roman jurists, such as Ulpian. He would then formulate the general legal principles and use these to resolve legal problems inspired from actual, practical cases. This method differed from <b>the</b> <b>scheme</b> <b>of</b> classical times in which the student had to master the law basics before engaging in case studies.|$|E
5|$|Pressed by the French and Bavarians to {{the west}} and Hungarian rebels to the east, Austria faced the real {{possibility}} of being forced out of the war. Concerns over Vienna and the situation in southern Germany convinced Marlborough of the necessity of sending aid to the Danube; but <b>the</b> <b>scheme</b> <b>of</b> seizing the initiative from the enemy was extremely bold. From the start the Duke resolved to mislead the Dutch, who would never willingly permit any major weakening of Allied forces in the Spanish Netherlands. To this end, Marlborough moved his English troops to the Moselle (a plan approved of by The Hague), but once there he planned to slip the Dutch leash and march south to link up with Austrian forces in southern Germany.|$|E
5|$|The first {{element in}} <b>the</b> <b>scheme</b> <b>of</b> painted {{architecture}} is {{a definition of}} the real architectural elements by accentuating the lines where spandrels and pendentives intersect with the curving vault. Michelangelo painted these as decorative courses that look like sculpted stone moldings. These have two repeating motifs, a formula common in Classical architecture. Here, one motif is the acorn, {{the symbol of the}} family of both Pope Sixtus IV, who built the chapel, and Pope Julius II, who commissioned Michelangelo's work. The other motif is the scallop shell, one of the symbols of the Madonna, to whose assumption the chapel was dedicated in 1483. The crown of the wall then rises above the spandrels, to a strongly projecting painted cornice that runs right around the ceiling, separating the pictorial areas of the biblical scenes from the figures of Prophets, Sibyls, and Ancestors, who literally and figuratively support the narratives. Ten broad painted crossribs of travertine cross the ceiling and divide it into alternately wide and narrow pictorial spaces, a grid that gives all the figures their defined place.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>scheme</b> <b>of</b> {{manoeuvre}} {{adopted by}} 1 RAR dictated that each company undertake a dispersed patrol program {{in their own}} tactical area of responsibility, a fact which {{would allow them to}} search more ground, but limit their ability to concentrate combat power in the event of contact. A Company, under Major John Healy, patrolled east; B Company moved north along the Song Be to Xom Xoai, while D Company patrolled south. C Company remained at LZ Queen to protect 105 Field Battery which had established a fire support base (FSB). Over the next two days the Australians patrolled relentlessly through the leech-infested swamps and dense jungle. At midday on 6 November A Company received two mortar rounds which failed to do any damage, but marked the start of a series of minor clashes. A Company had a number of contacts during this time, with the Australians killing a Viet Cong scout for the loss of two wounded in one skirmish. A further contact soon after resulted in two more Viet Cong killed and one wounded. Intelligence gained from these incidents indicated the presence of a Viet Cong Main Force Regiment in the area, while documents recovered contained plans for attacks on ARVN outposts near Bien Hoa Airbase.|$|E
