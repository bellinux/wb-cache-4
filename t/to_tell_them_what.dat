Guessing (correctly) that all Company men beyond the river had been killed, they turned and trekked back to Bulawayo in miserable fashion, their supplies all but gone and the Matabele impeding their progress at every turn.|$|E
5|$|Becky reveals to Steve that Hooch arrested her for {{shoplifting}} {{when she}} was fifteen, and attempted to molest her. She filed a complaint against him at the time, and Hooch is determined to get his revenge as this harmed his promotion prospects. During Becky's trial, Steve develops genuine feelings for her and they begin an affair, with Steve promising to leave Michelle. Although he keeps his promise, Becky reunites with Jason, eventually leading to him proposing to her. She accepts but reconsiders when Steve proposes as well. Becky ultimately breaks up with Jason and moves in with Steve. His daughter, Amy Barlow (Amber Chadwick), initially dislikes Becky, prompting her to put their wedding on hold though Steve eventually convinces her to set a date. Becky turns up to her wedding so drunk that the vicar refuses to perform the ceremony. They plan a second ceremony, Slug returns, seemingly reformed but actually working for Hooch. Slug plants drugs on Becky. At Becky and Steve's 2nd wedding, the reception is raided by police, and Becky is arrested for drug possession. Steve hires lawyers to free Becky and after Steve and Becky find Slug and convince him <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>what</b> Hooch has on {{him that he would}} even consider framing Becky, they use it to blackmail Hooch into calling a truce and drop the charges.|$|E
25|$|On 21 March, Patton {{ordered his}} XII Corps {{to prepare for}} an assault over the Rhine on the {{following}} night, one day before Montgomery's scheduled crossing. While this was certainly short notice, it did not catch the XII Corps completely unaware. As soon as Patton had received the orders on the 19th to make a crossing, he had begun sending assault boats, bridging equipment, and other supplies forward from depots in Lorraine {{where they had been}} stockpiled since autumn in the expectation of just such an opportunity. Seeing this equipment moving up, his frontline soldiers did not need any orders from higher headquarters <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>what</b> it meant.|$|E
5000|$|Speaking in January 2011 to noted UK R&B writer Pete Lewis - Assistant Editor of Blues & Soul - Avant {{described}} {{his reasons for}} titling the album The Letter as being because it represents [...] "a letter from me to my fans, <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>what's</b> {{going on in my}} life, what's going through my head, and my struggles as a man." ...|$|R

"Yes, lad, I'm goin' {{with the}} committee, more <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>'em</b> <b>what</b> they ought <b>to</b> do, {{as you might}} say, than {{to serve as a}} private soldier, for you see I know Ticonderoga root and branch. I could tell you the whole story from the meanin' of the name down to who is in command of it this very minute, if there was time." ...|$|R

500|$|Upon {{viewing the}} {{performance}} of the Jamaican bobsleigh team at the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, Guèye decided to return to the Olympics once again. He maintained that he had a hard time explaining the sport to his fellow countrymen, saying [...] "I have to tell the people what snow is, what skis are, I have <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>what</b> big mountains are. They don't have any reference on these things." [...] Joining Guèye at the 1992 Winter Olympics in Albertville, France, and becoming the second Senegalese athlete to compete at a Winter Games, was ski instructor Alphonse Gomis, who resides in Tignes, near Albertville. As at the 1984 Winter Games, Guèye was Senegal's flagbearer during the Parade of Nations in the opening ceremony. No support staff were sent with the skiers, so that when Guèye injured his back, a doctor from the American team treated him.|$|E
500|$|Filming {{began in}} February 2011, and {{concluded}} {{in the late}} summer (from the Northern Hemisphere's perspective). Filming largely took place in South Africa, particularly in Cape Town, but also in Durban and Springbok, Northern Cape. Outside South Africa the series was also filmed in Budapest, Hungary, and the UK. Among the separate locations the series takes place in, the New Delhi hotel in the first two episodes were shot in Cape Town, and the suburbs of Hout Bay doubled as Mozambique. Throughout the shoot the actors were allowed to perform the majority of their own stunts. Military advisors were on hand to teach the actors how to perform certain stunts, and <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>what</b> they did wrong during the take. The series includes a number of sex scenes, many of which were performed by Stapleton. In an interview with the British newspaper Metro, the actor stated [...] "I've done my fair share of nude scenes in the past {{but not as much as}} this – not as risqué, anyway," [...] adding that while he got used to it, he was always [...] "a bit nervous running around in front of 50 people with no clothes on. The sex scenes were usually with an actress I'd just met, so it's like: 'How's it going? I'm Sullivan and this is me nude.' It's nerve-racking at first but you have as much fun as you can with it." ...|$|E

She advised Rebecca Campbell, {{executive}} director of the Austin Film Society, [...] "Whenever you speak in public you’ve got <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>what</b> you need from them." [...] She put the spotlight on film as a genuine industry, brought more focus to Texas, and had a tremendous network of people in the entertainment industry. She gave more focus to film as a business than had been done before.|$|E

5000|$|Some {{critics of}} Strauss have {{accused him of}} being elitist, illiberalist and anti-democratic. Shadia Drury, in Leo Strauss and the American Right (1999), claimed that Strauss inculcated an elitist strain in American {{political}} leaders linked to imperialist militarism, neoconservatism and Christian fundamentalism. Drury argues that Strauss teaches that [...] "perpetual deception of the citizens by those in power is critical because they need to be led, and they need strong rulers <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>what's</b> good for them." [...] Nicholas Xenos similarly argues that Strauss was [...] "an anti-democrat in a fundamental sense, a true reactionary." [...] As Xenos says, [...] "Strauss was somebody who {{wanted to go back to}} a previous, pre-liberal, pre-bourgeois era of blood and guts, of imperial domination, of authoritarian rule, of pure fascism." ...|$|R
2500|$|At the Red Guard rallies, Lin Biao {{also called}} for the {{destruction}} of the [...] "Four Olds"; namely, old customs, culture, habits, and ideas. Lin's speeches, heavy on rhetoric but light on details, did not specify what needed to be [...] "destroyed" [...] as part of this campaign. Mao believed that in creating [...] "great disorder", the masses should organically steer the direction of the movement rather than rely on the authorities <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>what</b> to do. As a result, the movement quickly spun out of control.|$|E
2500|$|The 1980s saw a {{breakthrough}} in the independence of Australian rock—Nick Cave said that before the 1980s, [...] "Australia still needed America or England <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>what</b> was good". Shaddap You Face, by Joe Dolce, became, and still remains, the most successful Australian produced original-song of all time. An example of Australians breaking free from convention came in TISM. Formed in 1982, the band {{is known for its}} anonymous members, outrageous stage antics, and humorous lyrics. In the words of the band, [...] "There's only one factor left that makes us work. And that factor, I think, we've burned away, with the crucible of time, into something that's actually genuine." ...|$|E
2500|$|Two acquaintances of Markhasev, Sara Peters and Michael Chang, {{testified against}} {{him at the}} grand jury. Peters and her boyfriend, Eli Zakaria (who refused to testify, invoking his Fifth Amendment right to not {{incriminate}} himself), were with Markhasev {{on the night of}} the murder and were high on cocaine and heroin. She testified they had stopped to use the pay phone at a park-and-ride lot about [...] from where Cosby had pulled over to fix his flat tire. Peters testified that while Zakaria was on the phone, Markhasev walked off without saying where he was going. Within a few minutes, Peters heard a loud noise like a car backfiring, and Markhasev ran back to the car, saying, [...] "Let's go. We've got to get out of here. Let's go." [...] Markhasev refused <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>what</b> had happened, but they stopped at a wooded area that matched the description of where the murder weapon was later discovered.|$|E
500|$|While {{discussing}} how {{behind the times}} Pawnee is, Tom said residents are now only starting to become interested in the rock band Nirvana. Tom said, [...] "I don't have the heart <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>what's</b> going <b>to</b> happen to Kurt Cobain in 1994", {{a reference to the}} suicide of the band's lead singer. Before Tom eats a hot pepper at the dinner party, he sings, [...] "This is how you eat it" [...] to the tune of the 1995 Montell Jordan song [...] "This Is How We Do It". Leslie said she was saving an old newspaper because it had the [...] "first rumblings of Iran-Contra", a reference to the scandal in which U.S. figures facilitated the sale of arms to Iran. Tom visits Wikipedia, the free online encyclopedia, to learn more about India when quizzed by Justin.|$|R
50|$|At Ram Charan’s house, Bakha {{sees his}} other friend, Chota. The two boys wait for Ram Charan {{to see them}} through the thicket of wedding revelers.

They coax Bakha <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>what’s</b> wrong. Bakha breaks down and <b>tells</b> <b>them</b> about the slap and Sohini’s assault. Ram Charan is quiet and embarrassed by Bakha’s tale, but Chota is indignant. He asks Bakha if he wants to get revenge. Bakha does but realizes revenge would be a dangerous and futile endeavor. A melancholic atmosphere falls over the group. Chota attempts to cheer Bakha up by reminding him of the hockey game they will play later in the day. This reminds Bakha that he must go and get his gift from Charat Singh.|$|R

[...] Some key employees worked with Fatshark following {{the closing of}} GRIN. [...] Simon Viklund, Creative Director on the first Rearmed {{was hired as a}} Creative Advisor to the Fatshark team. [...] Of his position with Fatshark, Viklund remarked [...] "They were taking over things mid-project and I worked as a creative advisor during the hand-over <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>what</b> they were looking at." [...] Viklund further stated that the original design for the game involved events beyond the existing plot. [...] "I wanted to start off there and end up in a city in the FSA where everyone can see a bionic fighting. [...] a nice way to convey that now everyone will see that bionics can't always be controlled." [...] He noted that this would be an event in which the public would notice the dangers of bionics and seek to outlaw them.|$|E
2500|$|Tabari relates on the {{authority}} of Ibn Ishaq that when Jesus was about nine or ten years old, his mother Mary would send him to a Jewish religious school. But whenever the teacher tried to teach him anything, he found that Jesus already knew it. The teacher exclaimed, [...] "Do you not marvel at the son of this widow? Every time I teach him anything, I find that he knows it far better than I do!" [...] Tabari further relates on {{the authority}} of Ismail al-Suddi that [...] "when Jesus was in his youth, his mother committed him [...] to study the Torah. While Jesus played with the youths of his village, he used <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>what</b> their parents were doing." [...] Sa'id ibn Jubayr, according to Tabari, {{is said to have}} reported that Jesus would say to one of his fellow playmates in the religious school, [...] "Your parents have kept such and such food for you, would you give me some of it?" [...] Jesus would usually tell his fellow pupils in the religious school what their parents ate and what they have kept for them when they return home. He used to say to one boy, [...] "Go home, for your parents have kept for you such and such food and they are now eating such and such food." ...|$|E

50|$|In a 1995 interview, Lien {{said the}} {{following}} about these conventions: The conventions are something within themselves, a unique world. It’s {{a very different}} experience in that I can talk to other {{people involved in the}} world of Star Trek, like authors and actors from other Star Trek shows. I also get to meet people from other SF shows, because they tend to have guests from other series at the conventions I attend. The fans love the conventions, love meeting the people involved in their favorite shows. That makes you want to give them everything you can. I try <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>what’s</b> going on, share my laughter and <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> about the wonderful experience I've been having on Voyager. The feedback is just so positive. The fans seem to really like the show, and that's good. If they have any negative feedback, they give it to me, too, which is fine. They're usually pretty respectful, and they come up with things that are very interesting - positive and negative - and I get sucked into it.|$|R

As they order their beer, the bartender notes “and then your right back down again!” as he shows the £20 note as an obvious fake. They hurry back to Kecks's flat and arrive just as he is trying to leave wearing a poor quality disguise. They force Kecks <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>what’s</b> going on and he <b>tells</b> <b>them</b> that he has stolen some printing plates for £20 notes from a heavy duty villain in London and is about to skip the country with his little bundle of counterfeit notes, but he’s hidden the plates in the van and was going to ring the lads when he was abroad to ask if they would deliver them to a contact in Parkestone.|$|R
