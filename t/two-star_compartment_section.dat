40|$|The NATO Advanced Research Workshop on Nuclear Submarine Decommissioning and Related Problems {{was held}} in Moscow June 19 [...] 22, 1995. It was preceded by {{a visit to the}} Zvezdotchka Shipyard at Severodvinsk, a repair and {{maintenance}} yard for Russian nuclear submarines, for a subgroup of the workshop attendees. Most of the material in this paper is drawn directly form the workshop proceedings. Slightly less than 500 nuclear ships and submarines (the vast majority are submarines) have been constructed by the countries with nuclear navies. This includes approximately 250 by Russia, 195 by the United States, 23 by the United Kingdom, 11 by France and 6 by China. By the year 2000 it is expected that approximately one-half of these nuclear vessels will be removed from service and in various states of decommissioning. A newspaper account in June 1997 indicated that 156 Russian nuclear submarines had been removed from service. In August 1996 it was reported that 55 reactor <b>compartment</b> <b>sections</b> from US nuclear submarines were already in long-term storage at Hanford. Overall the dismantlement of nuclear submarines and the processing, storage and disposal of nuclear fuel, activated components and section of the hulls, and the liquid and solid radioactive and hazardous wastes is an enormous problem. This problem has been exacerbated by the accelerated decommissioning schedule associated with treaty obligations...|$|R

Livestock pens for cattle, sheep, goats, chicken, ducks, guinea fowl and retaining walls for gardens were also built.|$|R
30|$|Functional {{disorders}} are described separately because, as stated above, they can clinically and radiologically present independent from pelvic organ prolapses [32]. Also, these functional disorders frequently involve all three pelvic compartments at once since, as mentioned, the pelvic floor {{functions as a}} single unit, giving support to the entire pelvic structures [9, 11]. Note that, although urethral hypermobility is considered a functional disorder, it {{was included in the}} anterior <b>compartment</b> disorder <b>section.</b> The reason is based solely on the described association between a cystocele and urethral hypermobility, which almost never is present alone. Also, some imaging cases of functional disorders in men will be presented, once they are the most common pelvic floor pathology of this gender.|$|R

The Pan American Clippers - with a wing span of 152 feet (46 m), a cruising speed of 200 mph (320 km/h) and a capacity to carry 72 passengers - were luxurious. The two-deck interior featured dining rooms, private <b>compartments</b> and sleeping <b>sections.</b>|$|R
40|$|Requirements {{for patient}} safety and {{improved}} efficacy are steadily increasing in modern healthcare and are key drivers in modern drug development. New drug characterization assays are central in providing {{evidence of the}} specificity and selectivity of drugs. Meeting this need, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI) is used to study drug localization within micro-environmental tissue <b>compartments.</b> Thin <b>sections</b> of human lung tumor and rat xenograft tissues were exposed to pharmaceutical drugs by either spotting or submerging. These drugs, the epidermal growth factor receptor antagonists, erlotinib (Tarceva™) and gefitinib (Iressa™), and the acetylcholine receptor antagonist, tiotropium were characterized by microenvironment localization. Intact tissue blocks were also immersed in drug solution followed by sectioning. MALDI-MSI was then performed using a Thermo MALDI LTQ Orbitrap XL instrument to localize drug distribution patterns. We propose three MALDI-MSI models measuring drug disposition {{that have been used}} to map the selected compounds within tissue compartments of tumors isolated from lung cancer patients...|$|R

50|$|A fascial <b>compartment</b> is a <b>section</b> {{within the}} body that {{contains}} muscles and nerves and is surrounded by fascia. In the human body, the limbs can each {{be divided into two}} segments - the upper limb can be divided into the arm and the forearm and the sectional compartments of both of these - the fascial compartments of the arm and the fascial compartments of the forearm contain an anterior and a posterior compartment. Likewise, the lower limbs can be divided into two segments - the leg and the thigh - and these contain the fascial compartments of the leg and the fascial compartments of the thigh.|$|R
50|$|The vehicle had {{its crew}} <b>compartment</b> and drive <b>section</b> forward, {{in a large}} and low casemate; the engine was {{situated}} behind it, in a separate structure (typical of Italian designs), which was sloped and somewhat smaller, and had inspection panels on the roof. The chassis was identical to that of M13/40 tanks, with eight small wheels in four trolleys which were joined in pairs by two arms. Suspensions were of the leaf spring type, which was reliable but didn't allow for high speeds. The transmission was located in the forward part of the vehicle, and the crew consisted of only three members: driver, loader/radio operator, and tank commander/gunner.|$|R
50|$|In the BTR-60, {{the crew}} {{compartment}} {{is located in}} the front of the vehicle and had a roof - unlike the troop compartment, which first received one with the introduction of the BTR-60PA. In the BTR-60P and BTR-60PA, the crew consists of a driver and a commander. The driver's seat is on the left and commander's seat is on the right. In the BTR-60PAI, BTR-60PB and BTR-60PZ, the crew consists of a driver, a commander and a gunner. The position of the driver and commander stations remained unchanged in later models. The gunner operates the BPU-1 turret, using the PP-61A optical sight. In the BTR-60P, both the driver and commander manned their positions by entering the vehicle through the sides. The BTR-60PA introduced two hatches over their stations and crew members had to climb on top of the vehicle to use them. The entry method did not change in later production models. The BTR-60B introduced a side door for the gunner on the right side, and firing ports for both the driver and commander, and two for the gunner, one on each side. (For more information on the BTR-60's firing port see the troop <b>compartment</b> <b>section).</b> Both the driver and the commander have forward views through bulletproof windshields, onto which steel covers can be lowered. In the BTR-60P and BTR-60PA, the covers had vision slots, and additional slots on both sides of the crew compartment. These were removed in the BTR-60PB in favor of two periscopes on each side. In early models of the BTR-60P and BTR-60PA, only the driver had a periscope, while the commander had a removable OU-3 infrared searchlight. In the BTR-60PB, both the driver and the commander have three periscopes in the front (the commander's center periscope can be hard to see as it's just below the OU-3 infrared light). The vehicle was usually equipped with an R-113 radio; however, some models used the R-123. The initial BTR-60P production model lacked night-vision and had only four headlights (two infrared, two white, one of each kind per side, these remained in all BTR-60 models). Late BTR-60P models were fitted with night-vision; the TKN-1 connected with the OU-3 infrared searchlight for the commander and the TWN-2 for the driver. This remained unchanged in later models.|$|R
40|$|Degradation of the {{extracellular}} matrix and basement membrane {{is a critical}} step in tumor progression. Matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP- 2) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 2 (TIMP 2) act in a coordinated manner to form an integrated system involved in ovarian cancer (OC) progression. In this study, the authors describe the expression of TIMP- 2 detected by immunohistochemistry in 6 OC cell lines and in 43 malignant epithelial ovarian tumors (in tumor and stromal <b>compartments)</b> in <b>sections</b> originating from primary laparotomies. No significant correlations between overall and progression-free survival and TIMP- 2 expression in tumor compartment were observed. The analysis demonstrated a significant association between enhanced stromal expression of TIMP- 2 and better clinical response to cisplatin- and paclitaxel-based chemotherapy. Increased expression of TIMP- 2 in the stromal compartment and simultaneous overexpression in both stromal and tumor compartments strongly correlated with increased survival. No significant correlations were found in vitro between resistance to cisplatin, paclitaxel, or topotecan and the expression of TIMP- 2 in the OC cell lines, suggesting stromal influences on tumor chemoresistance in the physiological environment. This study supports the concept of TIMP- 2 expression in the stromal compartment of OC as a promising marker of prognosis and response to cisplatin- and paclitaxel-based chemotherapy in OC patients...|$|R
50|$|When {{flying from}} a warship, the Walrus would be {{recovered}} by touching-down alongside, then {{lifted from the}} sea by a ship's crane. The aircraft's lifting-gear was kept in a <b>compartment</b> in the <b>section</b> of wing directly above the engine - one of the Walrus' crew would climb onto the top wing and attach this to the crane hook. Landing and recovery was a straightforward procedure in calm waters, but could be very difficult if the conditions were rough. The usual procedure was for the parent ship to turn through around 20° just before the aircraft touched down, thus creating a 'slick' to the lee side of ship on which the Walrus could alight, this being followed by a fast taxi up to the ship before the 'slick' dissipated.|$|R
40|$|Aim: In immunohistochemistry, {{antibodies}} {{are used}} to detect and localize antigens in cellular <b>compartments</b> in <b>sections</b> taken from frozen or paraffin blocks. Currently, computerized image processing techniques are widely available to analyze immunohistochemically stained tissues; however, the image analysis programs are generally highly specific and expensive. We aimed to show the feasibility of computer assisted image analysis (CAIA) by using two computer programs currently in widespread use. Methods: Two available computer programs, Adobe Photoshop CS and ImageJ, were used to separate areas in the same tissue sections stained with NOS antibody and labeled with peroxidase in human endometrial tissue. CAIA was made on the relevant images using these two programs. Results: There {{was a significant difference}} among the groups according to staining intensity, in all three grades of staining (P < 0. 001, P < 0. 05, and P < 0. 001, respectively). Subjective assessment of the images was in good agreement with objective CAIA. One (+) positive stained area was greater in group 1 and less in group 2 and group 3 (P < 0. 001 and P < 0. 001, respectively). Group 3, which was considered as the most intensely stained by the observer, had the greatest amount of ++ staining. Conclusion: CAIA is a safe and reliable method of analyzing tissue samples stained using immunohistochemical methods...|$|R
40|$|Two endo- 1, 3,-β-d-glucanases (I and II, EC 3. 2. 1. 6) {{are present}} in etiolated peas at {{opposite}} ends of the stem. Glucanase I from subapical regions degrades substrates to a series of low molecular weight dextrins, and is most readily assayed reductometrically (e. g. as laminarinase). Glucanase II from basal regions preferentially hydrolyzes internal linkages of long chains, and is most sensitively assayed viscometrically (e. g. as carboxymethylpachymanase). The activity of glucanase II but not I increases greatly near the apex in response to treatment of the tissue with auxin, and ethylene gas suppresses endogenous activities and the auxin response, i. e. levels of these enzymes are under developmental controls which can be regulated. Different natural substrates for the two enzymes were identified primarily in tissue fractions soluble in hot water. Substrates for glucanase I are concentrated in apical regions, as is the enzyme itself, and those for glucanase II are in basal regions, implying that enzymes and substrates are normally in separate cellular <b>compartments.</b> Tissue <b>sections</b> stained with aniline blue for β-glucan show enhanced fluorescence in cell walls, and most of this can be removed either by hot water or the appropriate purified β-glucanase. The enzymes are not likely to function directly in promoting nutrition or growth in peas, but they could help, following secretion, to maintain channels for communication and translocation through cell walls...|$|R

40|$|Antisera {{were raised}} against a {{synthetic}} peptide {{corresponding to the}} carboxyl terminus of the kappa-opioid receptor (KOR 1). Specificity of the antisera was verified by staining of COS- 7 cells transfected with KOR 1 and epitope-tagged KOR 1 cDNAs, by recognition by the antisera of proteins on Western blots of both transfected cells and brain tissue, {{by the absence of}} staining of both brain tissue and transfected cells after preabsorption of the antisera with the cognate peptide, and on the strong correlation between the distribution of KOR 1 immunoreactivity and that of earlier ligand binding and in situ hybridization studies. Results indicate that KOR 1 in neurons is targeted into both the axonal and somatodendritic compartments, but the majority of immunostaining was seen in the somatodendritic <b>compartment.</b> In <b>sections</b> from rat and guinea pig brain, prominent KOR 1 staining was seen in the ventral forebrain, hypothalamus, thalamus, posterior pituitary, and midbrain. While the staining pattern was similar in both species, distinct differences were also observed. The distribution of preprodynorphin and KOR 1 immunoreactivity was complementary in many brain regions, suggesting that KOR 1 is poised to mediate the physiological actions of dynorphin. However, the distribution of KOR 1 and enkephalin immunoreactivity was complementary in some regions as well. These results suggest that the KOR 1 protein is primarily, but not exclusively, deployed to postsynaptic membranes where it mediates the effects of products of preprodynorphin and possibly preproenkephalin...|$|R
50|$|The first {{generation}} Prairies were innovative vehicles - featuring no B-pillar between {{the front and}} rear doors (instead the interlocking front and sliding rear doors locked onto both the floor and roof of the vehicle); front seatbelts mounted on the doors (excluding the US versions) that facilitated a totally unimpeded side entrance; front seats that could be slid {{all the way to the}} front of the passenger compartment and fully reclined; rear seats that could not only be folded away conventionally, but could also be reclined fully to make a double bed (in combination with the front seats); rear window winders that folded into themselves (to prevent catching when the doors were slid open); tailgate that opened to the floor of the luggage <b>compartment</b> (the center <b>section</b> of the rear bumper was mounted on the tailgate); optional front-facing third row of seats.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} a CFD {{approach}} to optimize the design parameters for a high throughput microreactor prior to reactor micromachining and assembling. A molybdenum-based microreactor has been designed for the screening of catalytic coatings in the 100 - 800 DegC temp. range in gas phase reactions involving large heat effects (DH 298 = +- 500 kJ/mol). The microreactor consists of eight microstructured compartments, each with {{a cross section of}} 2. 28 mm * 10. 18 mm and 40 mm in length. Eight 100 mm thick molybdenum plates with a deposited catalytic layer with a thickness up to 10 mm are to be inserted in each compartment at distances of 130 mm from each other. Using the CFD code Fluent 6. 0, it is demonstrated that a low-pressure drop flow diffuser, positioned upstream of the microreactor, distributes reactants evenly in a flow range of 50 - 1000 cm 3 /min (STP) throughout all compartments. The gas sampling section allows to analyze the reaction products from a selected compartment with no interference from adjacent <b>compartments.</b> The quench <b>section</b> provides a fast quench of the effluent gases within milliseconds to avoid consecutive reactions.

The end ladies' compartment was left unchanged with room for four passengers on two longitudinal seats. The second compartment had swing doors installed, in lieu of compartment 3. External swing-doors were retained in compartment 5, and compartment 6 became the smoking <b>section.</b> <b>Compartments</b> two through five each had ten seats in the standard 2+3 arrangement, using parts from Tait carriages.

25|$|For {{conspicuous}} gallantry and intrepidity {{in action}} {{above and beyond}} the call of duty. The aircraft of which Sgt. Smith was a gunner was subjected to intense enemy antiaircraft fire and determined fighter aircraft attacks while returning from a mission over enemy-occupied continental Europe on 1 May 1943. The aircraft was hit several times by antiaircraft fire and cannon shells of the fighter aircraft, 2 of the crew were seriously wounded, the aircraft's oxygen system shot out, and several vital control cables severed when intense fires were ignited simultaneously in the radio <b>compartment</b> and waist <b>sections.</b> The situation became so acute that 3 of the crew bailed out into the comparative safety of the sea. Sgt. Smith, then on his first combat mission, elected to fight the fire by himself, administered first aid to the wounded tail gunner, manned the waist guns, and fought the intense flames alternately. The escaping oxygen fanned the fire to such intense heat that the ammunition in the radio compartment began to explode, the radio, gun mount, and camera were melted, and the compartment completely gutted. Sgt. Smith threw the exploding ammunition overboard, fought the fire until all the firefighting aids were exhausted, manned the workable guns until the enemy fighters were driven away, further administered first aid to his wounded comrade, and then by wrapping himself in protecting cloth, completely extinguished the fire by hand. This soldier's gallantry in action, undaunted bravery, and loyalty to his aircraft and fellow crewmembers, without regard for his own personal safety, is an inspiration to the U.S. Armed Forces.|$|R
40|$|Our current {{understanding}} of neuroanatomical abnormalities in neuropsychiatric diseases is {{based largely on}} magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and post mortem histological analyses of the brain. Further advances in elucidating altered brain structure in these human conditions might emerge from combining MRI and histological methods.

Here we demonstrate the utility of our method in the transfer of cytoarchitectonic information from histological sections to identify regions of interest in MRI scans of nine adult macaque brains for morphometric analyses. LDDMM improved {{the accuracy of the}} registration via decreased distances between GM/CSF surfaces after LDDMM (0. 39 ± 0. 13 mm) compared to distances after affine registration (0. 76 ± 0. 41 mm). Similarly, WM/GM distances decreased to 0. 28 ± 0. 16 mm after LDDMM compared to 0. 54 ± 0. 39 mm after affine registration.

40|$|We have {{investigated}} the use of two-photon induced spin excitation for applications to atom interferometry for lithography and rotation sensing. Our efforts have been grouped into two parts: theoretical study of schemes for nanolithography, and experimental investigation of novel schemes for rotation sensing. For lithography, we have concentrated on designing and studying theoretical models {{that would allow the}} creation of two-dimensional lithographic patterns with nanometer scale features. Specifically, We have developed a theoretical model for realizing a two-dimensional interferometer capable of producing periodic structures with a feature size of less than 10 nm. Fundamentally, this process uses the two-photon induced spin excitation for splitting atomic waves. We first extended this model to achieve a large degree of splitting via use of multiple pulses, and then showed how the process can be generalized to two orthogonal dimensions with independent controls. We have also designed a scheme for producing arbitrary two-dimensional features using atom interferometry. This process makes use of a phase mask imprinted on a laser pulse, guiding of atomic waves, and atom interferometry in order to produce any desired pattern, with features that can also be only a few nm's in size. For rotation sensing, we have realized experimentally a novel scheme that opens up a new way of controlling the interferometer contour. It may prove to be very robust for practical applications such as gravity gradiometry as well. (cont.) This process uses a single optical zone with two counter-propagating optical frequencies. The zone can be <b>compartmented</b> into small <b>sections,</b> and the optical phase of each section can be switched between 0 and n in a variable pattern. We have shown via simulations that a wide range of split-wave contours can be realized, including multiple loops of varying areas. Experimentally, we have demonstrated a preliminary version of this scheme. We have demonstrated the atomic interference via scanning the phase of a part of the optical beam. When realized in conjunction with trapped atoms, this scheme is expected to yield a rotation sensing ability that is comparable to the three-zone Raman interferometer. However, it has the advantage of being robust against angular misalignment and differential light shifts. Furthermore, it opens up the possibility of realizing atomic interferometry with dynamically tunable contours. by Ying Tan. Thesis (Ph. D.)
