5|$|Maeda {{wrote the}} episode after being {{inspired}} by the situation of a real-life French journalist, Jean-Dominique Bauby, who had been paralyzed and could only communicate by blinking his left eyelid. The character of Lukesh was in part inspired by Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho and was created by Maeda in the hopes <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>go</b> on to be a memorable villain. Effects expert Mat Beck created the unique visual sequence that showed Doggett and Lukesh traveling between the different universes. To create {{the effect of a}} parallel universe, every scene in the episode's teaser was flipped so that the mirror image was shown.|$|E
5|$|After a {{difficult}} start {{to life in}} the First Division, Cardiff secured their first victory in the top division by beating Middlesbrough 3–1. Keenor had been switched to centre-half for the match, a move Fred Stewart had resisted for some time due to his concern of Kennor's lack of height, away from his usual position at right-half and his performance impressed so much <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>go</b> on to play the position for the remainder of his career. The 1921–22 season was also Keenor's tenth year at Ninian Park and he was subsequently awarded a testimonial match against Bristol City. In the following five years, Cardiff became an established side in the First Division, missing out on the league title in the 1923–24 season to Huddersfield Town on goal average after drawing the final game of the season when a win would have guaranteed them the championship.|$|E

5|$|Khánh had {{a meeting}} with Lodge in the morning of the coup for around an hour after {{arranging}} a meeting through Wilson. Due to concerns as to whether Washington would express support for the coup and what the official policy was, the meeting was not held at the embassy but at the home of Lodge's aide Dunn. However, if Lodge was concerned about keeping a low profile regarding the coup, Khánh was not, arriving at Dunn's residence with seven jeeploads of aides before embracing Lodge. He told Lodge <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>go</b> after the communists aggressively and that the coup would not disrupt the military in any significant way. Khánh vowed to intensify the war effort, ask Lodge for guidance constantly, introduce democracy and install a direct phone line between Vietnamese military headquarters and the US Embassy. Lodge also reported that Khánh wanted {{to give the impression that}} he seriously thought that neutralist deal involving de Gaulle was a genuine and ominous prospect, and that de Gaulle had made much progress in influencing the previous administration.|$|E
5|$|Ramsey's parents hoped <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>go</b> to West Point, but at 15, he was {{too young}} to be admitted. He was awarded a {{scholarship}} to Kansas University, but in 1930 his father was posted to Governors Island, New York. Ramsey therefore entered Columbia University in 1931, and began studying engineering. He became interested in mathematics, and switched to this as his academic major. By the time he received his B.A. from Columbia in 1935, he had become interested in physics. Columbia awarded him a Kellett Fellowship to Cambridge University where he studied physics at Cavendish Laboratory under Lord Rutherford and Maurice Goldhaber, and encountered notable physicists including Edward Appleton, Max Born, Edward Bullard, James Chadwick, John Cockcroft, Paul Dirac, Arthur Eddington, Ralph Fowler, Mark Oliphant and J.J. Thomson. At Cambridge, he took the tripos in order to study quantum mechanics, which had not been covered at Columbia, resulting in being awarded a second B.A. degree by Cambridge.|$|E
