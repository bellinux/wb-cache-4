That same year, a design for the Sydney Town Hall by architect J.H.Willson was chosen which took its inspiration from the French style of the Hotel de Ville de Paris. To this day, the Hall remains the civic office of the Lord Mayor of Sydney and aldermen of the City Council.|$|E

With the rapid rise of George Lohmann in 1885, Surrey challenged for the unofficial title of Champion County for the first time in twenty years; then, by winning 32 of 42 matches in 1887, 1888 and 1889, Surrey were first or equal first in the final three years before official County Champions emerged.|$|E

6000|$|As a prose writer Dryden {{had a very}} marked {{influence}} on our literature in shortening his sentences, and especially in writing naturally, without depending on literary ornamentation {{to give effect to}} what he is saying. If we compare his prose with that of Milton, or Browne, or Jeremy Taylor, we note that Dryden cares less for style than any of the others, but takes more pains to state his thought clearly and concisely, as men speak when they wish to be understood. The classical school, which followed the Restoration, looked to Dryden as a leader, and to him we owe largely that tendency to exactness of expression which marks our subsequent prose writing. With his prose, Dryden rapidly developed his critical ability, and became the foremost critic[178] of his age. His criticisms, instead of being published as independent works, were generally used as prefaces or introductions to his poetry. The best known of these criticisms are the preface to the Fables, [...] "Of Heroic Plays," [...] "Discourse on Satire," [...] and especially the [...] "Essay of Dramatic Poesy" [...] (1668), which attempts <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> <b>a</b> <b>foundation</b> for all literary criticism.|$|E
