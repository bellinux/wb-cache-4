25|$|Historically, the indentured laborers {{who came}} from India brought with them the form of {{authentic}} Indian Classical Music. A form of local Indo-Trinidad classical music was later created. However, organisations were {{able to keep the}} pure classical form alive. Bharatiya Vidya Sansthaan, under the guidance of Prof. Hari Shankara Adesh, was the first institution to provide courses in the authentic classical artform of India. After which, more schools began to open such as, the Sangeet Mahavidyalaya and Shiv Sangeet School of Music. Other artistes who had the fortune to study in India or with teachers who came to the west, started teaching at different venues of Trinidad. Some of these prominent artistes are Pandit Mangal Patasar (sitar), Shivannad Maharaj (violin, harmonium, vocals), Dexter Raghunanan (tabla). Much support was offered by the government of India and the High Commission of India to Trinidad and Tobago. In history, Trinidad and Tobago have witnessed concerts featuring authentic Hindustani Classical performances free of charge as a technique <b>to</b> <b>spread</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> of the artform that was quickly developing. History was made again as the first ever certification course in pure Hindustani Classical music was started at the University of Trinidad and Tobago's Academy for the Performing Arts in 2010. The courses are held at the UTT'S campus {{on the grounds of the}} National Academy for the Performing Arts.
