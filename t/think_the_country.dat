2500|$|Further {{evidence}} of John's political development {{is found in}} a letter of October 1842, to his friend John Martin, responding to Martin's sending him a copy of The Nation: [...] "I think The Nation will do very well"; and again in October, on the arrival of 20,000 additional troops in Ireland: [...] "How do you <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> will take all this?"

She <b>thinks</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> is undergoing a de facto sexual revolution, and encourages people to re-examine traditional attitudes towards sexual promiscuity and homosexuality. She proposes decriminalization of orgies and prostitution (both currently illegal in China). She also believes that monogamy is a personal decision made between a couple, and should not be enforced by law or social pressure.|$|R

Quist said that AHCA [...] "will raise healthcare costs for working Montanans", {{which is consistent with}} an analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation. Quist has described AHCA as a [...] "tax cut for millionaires".|$|R

60|$|I {{must now}} observe to your Lordships, that Mr. Markham and Mr. Hastings have stated the Rajah's net revenue at forty-six lacs: but the {{accounts}} before you state it at forty lacs only.

My old mate was substantially a man of truth; but he did love to astonish [...] "know-nothings."

6000|$|MY DEAR SIR:--Your {{letter to}} Colonel Townsend, inclosing a slip from the [...] "Herald," [...] and asking {{a court of}} inquiry, has been laid before me by the Secretary of War, with the request that I would {{consider}} it. It is quite natural that you should feel some sensibility on the subject; yet I am not impressed, nor do I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> is impressed, {{with the belief that}} your honor demands, or the public interest demands, such an inquiry. The country knows that at all events you have done good service; and I believe it agrees with me that it is much better for you to be engaged in trying to do more, than to be diverted, as you necessarily would be, by a court of inquiry.|$|E
60|$|I have {{mentioned}} that this county is generally a vast continued body of high chalky hills, whose tops spread themselves into fruitful and pleasant downs and plains, upon which great flocks of sheep are fed, &c. But {{the reader is}} desired to observe these hills and plains are most beautifully intersected and cut through by the course of divers pleasant and profitable rivers; in the course and near the banks of which there always is a chain of fruitful meadows and rich pastures, and those interspersed with innumerable pleasant towns, villages, and houses, and among them many of considerable magnitude. So that, while you view the downs, and <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> wild and uninhabited, yet {{when you come to}} descend into these vales you are surprised with the most pleasant and fertile country in England.|$|E
6000|$|When London {{nights are}} intolerable, people think with longing of the cool, {{fragrant}} country, of the jasmine-muffled lattices, and the groups beneath the dreaming evening star. One dreams of coffee after {{dinner in the}} open air, as described in [...] "In Memoriam;" [...] one longs for the cool, the hush, the quiet. But try the country on a July night. First you have trouble with all the great, big, hairy, leathery moths and bats which fly in at the jasmine-muffled lattice, and endeavour to put out your candle. You blow the candle out, and then a bluebottle fly in good voice comes out too, and is accompanied by very fair imitations of mosquitoes. Probably they are only gnats, but in blowing their terrible little trumpets they are of the mosquito kind. Next the fact dawns on you that the church clock in the neighbouring spire strikes the quarters, {{and you know that}} you cannot fall asleep before the chime wakes you up again, with its warning, [...] "Another quarter gone." [...] The cocks come forth and crow about four; the hens proclaim to a drowsy world that they have fulfilled the duties of maternity. All through the ambrosial night three cows, in the meadow under your windows, have been lamenting the loss of their calves. Of all terrible notes, the [...] "routing" [...] of a bereaved, or amorous, or homesick cow is the most disturbing. It carries for miles, and keeps all who hear it--all town-bred folk, at least--far from the land of Nod. At dawn the song-birds begin, and hold you awake, as they disturbed Rufinus long ago; but the odds are that they do not inspire you, like Rufinus, with the desire to write poetry. The short and simple language of profanity is more likely to come unbidden to the wakeful lips. Thus, as John Leech found out, the country in July is almost as dreadful at night as the town. Nay, thanks to the cow, we <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> may bear away the prize for all that is uncomfortable, all that is hostile to sleep and the Muses. Yet rustics always sleep very well, and no more mind the noise of cocks, sparrows, cows, dogs, and ducks than the owner of a town-bred dog minds when his faithful hound drives a whole street beyond their patience. It is a matter of sound health and untaxed brains. If we always gave our minds a rest, none of us would dread the noises of the nights of summer.|$|E

A similar survey in Spain, after the Portuguese one, showed that 45.7% of Spanish think thatPortugal and Spain should merge; this support is especially higher among younger citizens (18 to 24 years old) and communities near the border with Portugal. But in Spain only 3.3% would prefer Lisbon as the capital, while 80% would prefer Madrid. 43.4% <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> should be known as España/Espanha (Spain) against 39.4% preferring Iberia.|$|E
