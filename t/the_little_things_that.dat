"One of {{the most}} {{important}} things we were looking for in casting was the actors' ability to play the subtleties – <b>the</b> <b>little</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> a character doesn't say or do that create the edge, the things that get under your skin and spook you," [...] Morgan said about the auditions.|$|E
500|$|He talked {{openly in}} the music press about his problems, telling the NME: [...] "When I cut myself I feel so much better. All <b>the</b> <b>little</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> might have been {{annoying}} me seem so trivial because I'm concentrating on the pain", and [...] "I'm {{the sort of person}} who wakes up in the morning and needs to pour a bottle down my throat".|$|E
500|$|Lady Bracknell's line, [...] "A handbag?", {{has been}} {{called one of the}} most {{malleable}} in English drama, lending itself to interpretations ranging from incredulous or scandalised to baffled. Edith Evans, both on stage and in the 1952 film, delivered the line loudly in a mixture of horror, incredulity and condescension. Stockard Channing, in the Gaiety Theatre, Dublin in 2010, hushed the line, in a critic's words, [...] "with a barely audible 'A handbag?', rapidly swallowed up with a sharp intake of breath. An understated take, to be sure, but with such a well-known play, packed full of witticisms and aphorisms with a life of their own, it's <b>the</b> <b>little</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> make a difference." ...|$|E

500|$|Alan Sepinwall {{praised the}} episode {{compared}} to the first few episodes of the season, writing it balanced Veronica's character traits well, including her jealousy and generosity. He also wrote that it showed her as a character with some [...] "baser instincts", giving the scene with Jeff as an example. Rowan Kaiser, writing for The A.V. Club, gave a mixed review. The reviewer was very critical {{of what he called}} the [...] "'radical feminist fakes her own rape'" [...] storyline, but he praised the episode as the first one of the third season to make the college setting feel natural. Although he thought that the case-of-the-week contributed to his overall positive view of the episode, he thought that [...] "it's mostly <b>the</b> <b>little</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> make it work", pointing out Piz's increased role as an example.|$|E
500|$|Stevens' {{teams are}} built around solid {{basketball}} fundamentals and good team work, rather than individual basketball skill. His teams {{are known for}} their defense, forcing opponents into uncharacteristic mistakes. The secret to basketball – and life – is [...] "just to do the job {{to the best of your}} ability and don't worry about anything else," [...] Stevens says. [...] "Win the next game. Win the next possession. That's our focus. It's boring. It's also the way championships are won", he says. In short, Stevens is a strong believer in [...] "The Butler Way" [...] – doing all <b>the</b> <b>little</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> transform a group of good basketball players into a great basketball team. [...] "I tell the players 'the Butler Way' isn't easy to define," [...] Stevens says, [...] "but you can see it on the floor when we share the basketball, play with great energy and defend." ...|$|E

60|$|Money {{poured in}} on him, fame poured in on him; he flashed, comet-like, {{through the world}} of literature, and he was more amused than {{interested}} by the stir he was making. One thing was puzzling him, a <b>little</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> would have puzzled the world had it known. But the world would have puzzled over his bepuzzlement rather than over <b>the</b> <b>little</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> to him loomed gigantic. Judge Blount invited him to dinner. <b>That</b> was <b>the</b> <b>little</b> <b>thing,</b> or <b>the</b> beginning of <b>the</b> <b>little</b> <b>thing,</b> <b>that</b> was soon to become the big thing. He had insulted Judge Blount, treated him abominably, and Judge Blount, meeting him on the street, invited him to dinner. Martin bethought himself of the numerous occasions on which he had met Judge Blount at the Morses' and when Judge Blount had not invited him to dinner. Why had he not invited him to dinner then? he asked himself. He had not changed. He was the same Martin Eden. What made the difference? The fact that the stuff he had written had appeared inside the covers of books? But it was work performed. It was not something he had done since. It was achievement accomplished {{at the very time}} Judge Blount was sharing this general view and sneering at his Spencer and his intellect. Therefore it was not for any real value, but for a purely fictitious value that Judge Blount invited him to dinner.|$|R

But when he actually saw <b>the</b> <b>little</b> <b>thing,</b> <b>that</b> sturdy face grew so very soft and sweet, and when we {{told him he was}} her protector, he put both his hands tight together, and said, [...] "I'll be so good!" [...] When he is with her, another child seems to shine out under the bluff pickle he generally is--he walks so quietly, and thinks it such an honour to touch her.' ...|$|R

60|$|These, as I {{have already}} intimated, were but <b>the</b> <b>little</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> touched a child's fancy; {{there was another}} romantic {{circumstance}} {{in the life of}} Rosas which appealed to everybody, adult as well as child.|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, then, it sha'n't be." [...] It {{was well}} enough to tell HER so--no harm in it.

6000|$|I {{had spent}} a number of weary days {{awaiting}} trial, when a visitor was announced, and a young, smooth-shaven man shown into my quarters.

Think of all <b>the</b> <b>little</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> didn't strike you as quite usual." ...|$|E

60|$|The fact had its {{significance}} to Nasmyth.

Their progress was slow, for there was no trail at all, and while they laboriously plodded over the shingle, or crept in and out among the thickets, the wail of the breeze grew louder. Half an hour had passed when the faint hoot of the Tillicum's whistle reached them among the trees.|$|R
