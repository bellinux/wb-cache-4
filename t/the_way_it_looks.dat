25|$|Tuten spent 15 years {{heading the}} {{graduate}} program in creative {{writing at the}} City College of New York, which he co-founded. In that capacity, he championed the work of students Walter Mosley, Oscar Hijuelos, Philip Graham, Aurelie Sheehan, Salar Abdoh, Ernesto Quiñonez, and many others. He also teaches classes on experimental writing at The New School. He {{is on the board}} of advisors for Guernica Magazine and executive editor of Smyles & Fish. Tuten's short fiction has appeared in Granta, Conjunctions, Fence, Fiction, The New Review of Literature, Tri-Quarterly, and Harper's Magazine. In 1973, he received a Guggenheim Fellowship for Creative Writing and in 2001 was given the Award for Distinguished Writing from the American Academy of Arts and Letters. In describing his usage of the past in his novels (where many of them are set), Tuten once stated:The fact that I don’t write about contemporary life doesn’t mean I’m any less taken up with it. I find it too limiting to write about contemporary life just in contemporary diction, however. I don’t think there's enough flexibility. I can imagine writing about characters who feel passion for one another in a contemporary setting but I don’t, as yet, hear the language for that. But I’m always thinking about contemporary life vis a vis <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> in the past. I mean how it looks in the past is a reflection of what it is today. That's what interests me. I think I’m always talking about present-day life, not only political life but about the quality of passion, the quality of all relationships and love.|$|E
500|$|The {{first series}} {{contains}} {{a total of}} six books. It was originally to be called [...] "The Clawed Path," [...] as the journey the four bears make through all six books in the series is referred to as [...] "the clawed path." [...] At the very last moment, the title was changed so that it would look similar to the Warriors series. Holmes was initially unhappy with the change, but has since said that she has come to like it and <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> on the books.|$|E
500|$|Golan shelved the low-budget rewrites and {{attempted}} to finance an independent production from the original big-budget script, already budgeted, storyboarded and laid out. At Cannes in May 1989, 21st Century announced a September start date, with ads touting the script by [...] "Barney Cohen, Ted Newsom & John Brancato and Joseph Goldman." [...] As standard practice, Golan pre-sold the unmade film to raise production funds, with television rights bought by Viacom and home video rights by Columbia Pictures, which wanted to establish a studio franchise. Stephen Herek was attached as director at this point. Golan submitted this [...] "new" [...] screenplay to Columbia in late 1989 (actually the 1985 script with an adjusted [...] "1989" [...] date) and the studio requested yet another rewrite. Golan hired Frank LaLoggia, who turned in his draft but grew disenchanted with 21st Century. Neil Ruttenberg was hired for one more draft, which was also [...] "covered" [...] by script readers at Columbia. Columbia’s script analysts considered all three submissions [...] "essentially the same story." [...] A tentative production deal was set. Said Stan Lee in 1990, [...] "21st Century [...] supposed to do Spider-Man and now they're talking to Columbia and <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> now, Columbia may end up buying Spider-Man from 21st Century." ...|$|E

50|$|During the World War II {{although}} much of the city was destroyed or damaged, the market did not suffer much damage. The square was restored according to <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> in <b>the</b> late 18th century, using Baroque and Classicism styles.|$|R
5000|$|Healthcare Insurance Reciprocol of Canada (HIROC), [...] Canada's leading {{provider}} of healthcare liability insurance, developed a company-wide Integrated Risk Management tool using Datix.

5000|$|In 2002 a {{decision}} was made to do yet another major remodeling of the museum.

50|$|The Victory was {{the first}} theater to be {{restored}} {{in an effort to}} revitalize 42nd Street and Times Square, and between 1994 and 1995 it underwent an $11.4 million renovation headed by Hugh Hardy of the architectural firm of Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer Associates. The restoration included rebuilding the original exterior double staircase that had been removed in 1911 for the widening of West 42nd Street, and returning the rest of the theater to much <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> during <b>the</b> Belasco era.|$|R
50|$|During {{the summer}} of 1973 {{a replica of the}} Thomas Stretch clock was {{restored}} to Independence Hall. The $159,000 replica included a 14-foot copy of the clock case atop a 40-foot soapstone column, just <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> during <b>the</b> Revolutionary War. To lessen danger of deterioration, the original delicate wood carvings were instead cast in polyester bronze. The only major concession in modernism: the clock, with an eight-foot dial painted red-brown and Persian blue, is powered by electricity rather than wooden works and weights.|$|R
50|$|In 2005, the {{building}} {{was in the process}} of being converted into 145 luxury apartments. A plan for condominiums was considered but dropped. Nissen Risk Capital LLC and HRI, using Holder Construction Co. as general contractor, began work in Summer 2004. Little Diversified Architectural Consulting and Acanthus Architecture Group provided architectural expertise. The lobby was being restored to <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> when <b>the</b> building was new, including a granite floor and brass on steel elevator doors. A pool has been added to the roof.|$|R

"Now this is <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> to me," [...] Bill Jepson said slowly, as if {{talking with}} himself, [...] "though, of course, I ain't countin' on interferin' with you lads in any way: What I've {{got to tell}} the {{commodore}} is of more importance than the yarn Macomber can spin for the admiral, an' Darius Thorpe seemed to think I couldn't see the old man any too soon. Now if this 'ere sneak is goin' to wait where he is till the fleet comes, what's to prevent our keepin' on as we started, an' then comin' back to pull him in?

Neither Whitey nor Shadow knew he was there, but it would be only a few minutes before one of them knew it. At least, that is <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> to Jumper.|$|R
50|$|The two {{buildings}} {{faced each other}} until 1971, when 317 Broadway was torn down. Early tenants of 319 Broadway included the Security State Bank and the Metropolitan Life Insurance Corporation. Above the first story, 319 Broadway remains similar to <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> at <b>the</b> time of its construction. The stoop was removed in 1912, along with sidewalk encumbrances. Around that time, the basement level was designated as the first story, which classified the building as a five-story structure. The building continues to house offices and a restaurant.|$|R

5000|$|In 1975, a {{memorial}} to Károlyi, sculpted by Imre Varga, was installed in Budapest's Kossuth Lajos tér. In 2012, the government began renovation to the square to <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> before World War II, and Károlyi's statue was moved to Siófok. At the same time, throughout Hungary, many cities changed {{the name of their}} own streets named after Mihály Károlyi.

5|$|Israeli {{military}} {{officials said the}} Palestinians intended to build a mosque on {{the ruins of the}} site.

Ghassan Shakaa, the mayor, claimed that city officials simply wanted to return the building to <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> before <b>it</b> came into Israeli hands in the 1967 Mideast war. Under intense U.S. and international pressure the dome was repainted white.|$|R
50|$|Cockshoot Broad, {{one of the}} Norfolk Broads, lies on the River Bure within The Broads in Norfolk, England. It is one {{of several}} broads where boats are not allowed at any time of the year, {{although}} they can moor at its entrance. It is a nature reserve in the care of the Norfolk Wildlife Trust. Before becoming a nature reserve, {{it was one of the}} most dilapidated broads, clogged with large amounts of silt. The silt was dredged in the early 1980s and the broad has been returned to <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> some 100 years ago.|$|R
50|$|Another hypothesis, {{based on}} the {{condition}} of the mound and <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> like, is that it was built by the Cumans, in the 13th century.

50|$|On April 23, 1800 - {{the day of}} St. Georgi, when Elena was {{attacked}} by Muslim tribes (kardzhalii), the church “St. Nikola” was burned down together {{with most of the}} books.
