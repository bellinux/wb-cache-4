5|$|Following the United States Grand Prix on 24 September, {{the teams}} {{conducted}} testing sessions at various racing circuits across Europe between 26–29 September {{to prepare for}} the Grand Prix. McLaren's <b>test</b> <b>driver</b> Olivier Panis flew to the Circuit de Nevers Magny-Cours to undertake preparations for Suzuka and development work on their 2001 car. Ferrari <b>test</b> <b>driver</b> Luca Badoer spent two days at the Fiorano Circuit testing mechanical components and ran on an artificially wet track for testing of Bridgestone's wet weather tyre compounds. Williams, with rookie competitor Jenson Button, went to the Autódromo do Estoril for two days and tried wet weather tyres and different aerodynamic configurations. Prost travelled to Magny-Cours and their <b>test</b> <b>driver</b> Stéphane Sarrazin collected three days of chassis design data for the upcoming AP04 chassis. Benetton opted to miss testing prior to the event but their <b>test</b> <b>driver</b> Mark Webber tried developments at the Circuit de Catalunya that were incorporated into their 2001 car.|$|E
5|$|After the Hungarian Grand Prix on 13 August, {{five teams}} {{conducted}} mid-season testing at the Silverstone Circuit on 15–17 August. McLaren <b>test</b> <b>driver</b> Olivier Panis was fastest {{on the first}} day, ahead of Frentzen. Williams <b>test</b> <b>driver</b> Bruno Junqueira's car had a water leak, resulting in repairs which limited his team's testing time. Panis remained the fastest on the second day. Jos Verstappen's Arrows car had a sensor failure, limiting his team's testing time; the car's floor {{had to be removed}} to install a new sensor. Panis was again fastest {{on the final day of}} testing. Ferrari opted to test the suspension and tyres of Michael Schumacher's car at the Fiorano Circuit. Schumacher later moved to the Mugello Circuit, with Barrichello conducting engine and setup tests, and Ferrari <b>test</b> <b>driver</b> Luca Badoer remained at Fiorano for development work on new car components. Prost opted to test at the Autodromo Nazionale Monza on 17–18 August with driver Jean Alesi. Benetton conducted a five-day, one-car test at the Danielson Circuit, with <b>test</b> <b>driver</b> Mark Webber on aerodynamic development for the first four days and Alexander Wurz concentrating on practice starts the last day.|$|E
5|$|Following the Austrian Grand Prix on 16 July, {{the teams}} {{conducted}} testing sessions at three circuits from 18–21 July {{to prepare for}} the Grand Prix. McLaren, Benetton, Jordan, Jaguar, Sauber and BAR went to Silverstone over three days. Olivier Panis, McLaren's <b>test</b> <b>driver,</b> set the fastest time {{on the first day of}} testing. Jaguar <b>test</b> <b>driver</b> Luciano Burti crashed at Stowe corner where his car's suspension, front and rear wings, and sidepod were damaged. The resulting incident caused a brief halt to testing and Jaguar shipped a spare car for the next day's testing. Panis remained fastest on the second day. Trulli damaged his suspension and rear wing, resulting in repairs which limited his team's testing time. Burti suffered another incident when he lost his right rear wheel. Fisichella topped the third and final day's running. Ferrari <b>test</b> <b>driver</b> Luca Badoer spent four days at the Fiorano Circuit where he concentrated on testing engine and aerodynamic development whilst Michael Schumacher did practice starts and component testing on the fourth day.|$|E

5|$|Following the Monaco Grand Prix on 4 June, {{the teams}} {{conducted}} testing sessions at the Autodromo Nazionale Monza between 6–8 June {{to prepare for}} the Canadian Grand Prix. Barrichello set the first day's fastest times, ahead of McLaren <b>test</b> <b>driver</b> Olivier Panis. Testing was halted when Nick Heidfeld and Luciano Burti both experienced engine and electronic failures respectively. Häkkinen was fastest on the second day. BAR's Ricardo Zonta lost control of his car and crashed into the barriers at the Parabolica corner, limiting his testing time as repairs were made to his car. Jenson Button for Williams was quickest on the third day. Ferrari undertook additional testing at their private facility, the Fiorano Circuit, with their <b>test</b> <b>driver</b> Luca Badoer who performed practice pit stops and starts, utilising different car set-ups, testing new car components and ran on an artificially wet track.|$|E
5|$|Webber {{was signed}} as <b>test</b> <b>driver</b> for the Arrows F1 team for 2000, and also gained {{sponsorship}} from Australian beer company Foster's whilst competing in Formula 3000. Webber took victory in round {{two of the}} season at Silverstone, and finished the series with two fastest laps and three podiums {{on his way to}} third overall—the highest position of any rookie that year. Contract issues meant that Webber was never able to drive the Arrows A21 car, and rejected a full contract offer for 2001 in July. However, he was offered a three-day evaluation test for Benetton {{at the end of the}} year, outpacing F1 drivers Ralf Schumacher and Giancarlo Fisichella at Estoril. The results were good enough to earn him the <b>test</b> <b>driver</b> role with the team for 2001, and he also agreed to take on team boss Flavio Briatore as manager in return for finance for a further F3000 season. Webber joined the championship-winning Super Nova Racing team, and despite winning at Imola, Monaco and Magny-Cours, he finished second overall to British driver Justin Wilson. Webber was replaced as <b>test</b> <b>driver</b> for Benetton for 2002 by Fernando Alonso, but Briatore managed to secure Webber a contract to race alongside Alex Yoong in the Stoddart-owned Minardi team, making him the first Australian in Formula One since David Brabham in 1994.|$|E
5|$|After the Belgian Grand Prix on 2 September, {{the teams}} {{conducted}} mid-season testing at various European race circuits between 4–7 September {{to prepare for}} the Italian Grand Prix at the Autodromo Nazionale Monza. Ferrari, Williams, BAR, Jordan and Minardi tested at the Mugello Circuit. Rubens Barrichello for Ferrari set the fastest times on the first and second days. The second day of testing was disrupted on six occasions after BAR <b>test</b> <b>driver</b> Takuma Sato went off the circuit, suffered an electronic control unit failure and had a malfunctioning anti-stall system. BAR driver Olivier Panis and Minardi driver Alex Yoong both had problems with their clutch and gearboxes. On the final day Michael Schumacher set the fastest lap of 1 minute and 24.226 seconds, four-tenths ahead of Panis. Ferrari <b>test</b> <b>driver</b> Luca Badoer spent three days at his team's private test track the Fiorano Circuit where he did practice starts as well as testing of launch control and traction control.|$|E

5|$|Andretti {{found little}} success after 1978 in Formula One– {{he failed to}} win another grand prix. He had a {{difficult}} year in 1979, as the new Lotus 80 was not competitive, and the team {{had to rely on}} the Lotus 79 which had been overtaken by the second generation of ground effect cars. In 1980, he was paired with the young Italian Elio de Angelis, and briefly with <b>test</b> <b>driver</b> Nigel Mansell, but the team was again unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|BAR driver Jacques Villeneuve {{was passed}} {{fit in the}} days leading up to the race. At the Brazilian Grand Prix, Villeneuve {{suffered}} back injury after his seat became loose during the race and the effects became worse and it caused him to withdraw from testing in Barcelona. He was also required to undergo physiotherapy. BAR had their official <b>test</b> <b>driver</b> Darren Manning available to replace Villeneuve should the need arise.|$|E
5|$|Following the Canadian Grand Prix on 18 June, {{the teams}} {{conducted}} testing sessions at the Circuit de Nevers Magny-Cours between 21–23 June {{to prepare for}} the upcoming French Grand Prix. Coulthard set the fastest times on the first day, ahead of McLaren <b>test</b> <b>driver</b> Olivier Panis. Arrows driver Jos Verstappen lost control of his car after suffering a mechanical problem and crashed into the barriers at turn two. Verstappen sustained neck strain and withdrew from testing. He was later passed fit to compete in the Grand Prix. Coulthard remained fastest on the second day. Fisichella damaged the underside of his car's chassis, limiting his testing time as Benetton made repairs to his car. Häkkinen was quickest {{on the final day of}} testing. Michael Schumacher stopped on circuit as his Ferrari engine failed, causing his team to fit a new engine into the chassis. Ferrari went to their private testing facility, the Fiorano Circuit, on 27 June where <b>test</b> <b>driver</b> Luca Badoer shook down three Ferrari F1-2000 cars and also took part in pit stop practices.|$|E

5|$|Following the German Grand Prix on 30 July, six teams {{conducted}} mid-season {{testing at}} the Circuit Ricardo Tormo from 3–5 August. McLaren <b>test</b> <b>driver</b> Olivier Panis was fastest {{on the first}} day, ahead of Häkkinen. Pedro Diniz's Sauber car was afflicted with an oil leak, limiting his team's testing time as the leak was repaired. Coulthard was fastest on the second day. Fisichella set the fastest times {{on the final day}} of testing. His teammate Alexander Wurz spun off and collided with the tyre barrier. His car's wishbone struck his right leg and was taken to the circuit's medical center before a transfer to a local hospital. Wurz was passed fit to compete in the race the day after his accident. Ferrari opted to spend five days testing at the Fiorano Circuit and concentrated on car development, practice starts, aerodynamic testing and race distance simulations with their <b>test</b> <b>driver</b> Luca Badoer. He was joined by Barrichello on the second day and Michael Schumacher from the fourth day onwards. Badoer and Michael Schumacher spent two further days at the circuit performing shakedowns of the Ferrari F1-2000 car.|$|E
5|$|Ralf Schumacher {{suffered}} a three-inch gash {{on his left}} calf. He was taken to Princess Grace Hospital for a routine check-up and his cut was stitched. Ralf Schumacher was later cleared to race in the next Grand Prix, two weeks later. He {{said that he had}} no prior indication of where his injuries originated from. Williams had their <b>test</b> <b>driver</b> Bruno Junqueira to fill in for Ralf Schumacher should the need arise.|$|E
5|$|Ralf Schumacher {{was passed}} {{fit in the}} days leading up to the race. At the {{previous}} race, he had suffered a serious crash at the Sainte Devote corner and he sustained a three-inch gash on his left calf which required stitches.

5|$|Brabham {{cars were}} also widely used by other teams, {{and not just}} in Formula One. Jack Brabham and Ron Tauranac called the company they set up in 1961 to design and build formula racing cars to {{customer}} teams Motor Racing Developments (MRD), and this company had a large portfolio of other activities. Initially, Brabham and Tauranac each held 50percent of the shares. Tauranac was responsible for design and running the business, while Brabham was the <b>test</b> <b>driver</b> and arranged corporate deals like the Repco engine supply {{and the use of the}} MIRA wind tunnel. He also contributed ideas to the design process and often machined parts and helped build the cars.|$|E
5|$|Following the Japanese Grand Prix on 8 October, {{three teams}} {{conducted}} testing sessions around European race tracks between 10–13 October {{to prepare for}} the upcoming Grand Prix. Ferrari opted to spend the four days with <b>test</b> <b>driver</b> Luca Badoer where he tested new mechanical components on the F1-2000 car at the Fiorano Circuit on a wet/dry track. He later moved to the Mugello Circuit where he tried out brake testing, car set-ups, tyre evaluation, endurance runs for the car's engines and continued trying out new car components. Benetton cancelled a test in Barcelona during the period and decided to run at the Silverstone Circuit one week later using new Supertec engines angled at 110° degrees.|$|E
5|$|Hill {{represented}} Williams {{alone at}} the next race, the Monaco Grand Prix. His race ended early in a collision involving several cars on the opening lap of the race. For the following race, the Spanish Grand Prix, Williams' <b>test</b> <b>driver</b> David Coulthard was promoted to the race team alongside Hill, who won the race just four weeks after Senna's death. Twenty-six years earlier Graham Hill had won in Spain under similar circumstances for Lotus {{after the death of}} his team-mate Jim Clark. Championship leader Schumacher finished second with a gearbox fault restricting him to fifth gear, having led the early laps.|$|E
40|$|The long term- {{and large}} scale {{effects of the}} active {{accelerator}} pedal in 284 vehicles in Lund were evaluated with regard to speed, traffic safety, driver behaviour, travel time, emissions and acceptance. The results showed that compliance with the speed limits improved among <b>test</b> <b>drivers</b> both {{according to their own}} statements and the objective measurements. The reductions in average speeds, and in speed distribution, better car following behaviour, increased attention and better behaviour towards pedestrians indicate a great traffic-safety potential. Fuel consumption and emissions decreased significantly. Travel times were unaffected. The majority of the interviewed <b>test</b> <b>drivers</b> {{think that there is a}} need for speed control measures and society must undertake such measures. The <b>test</b> <b>drivers</b> think that the active accelerator pedal is an efficient means to improve traffic safety and experience it as a support in car driving.

5|$|Prost went on {{a sabbatical}} year in 1992, which was {{dominated}} by Nigel Mansell in a Williams-Renault. Prost performed pre-season testing for Ligier early in 1992 and later turned down an offer to drive for the team. After hearing that Prost would be his teammate again in 1993, Mansell left Williams to race in the CART series. The Frenchman had a clause in his contract which prevented rival Ayrton Senna from joining the team that year. Prost {{was part of a}} new-look driver line-up at Williams, with <b>test</b> <b>driver</b> Damon Hill coming in to replace Riccardo Patrese, who had left to join Benetton.|$|E
5|$|The {{main unit}} began its work in August 1976 in Sardinia. Don McLaughlan, {{then head of}} public {{relations}} at Lotus Cars, heard that Eon were shopping for a new Bond car. He drove a prototype Lotus Esprit with all Lotus branding taped over, and parked it outside the Eon offices at Pinewood studios; on seeing the car Eon asked Lotus to borrow both of the prototypes for filming.
