She visited the chapel at the military hospital to pay her final respects on Thursday before returning home, citing health reasons. Brazilian president Dilma Rousseff attended a wake on <b>Thursday</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> military academy before returning to Brazil on Friday morning. Former President Lula da Silva accompanied president Rousseff and departed before the funeral service.|$|E
25|$|We {{assume the}} world {{was created in the}} Hebrew month of Nissan, not Tishrei. So hour 1 (sunset) on Wednesday on this chart {{represents}} the beginning of Tekufat Nissan (Spring) {{in the first year of}} creation, the Hebrew year 1. For the purpose of Birkat Hachama, the calculation of Samuel of Nehardea for the length of a tropical year is used not the more accurate calculation of Adda bar Ahavah. Therefore, a year is assumed to be 52 weeks and 1 day and 6 hours (365.25 days). This means that a year after creation Tekufat Nissan will occur 1 day and 6 hours later on this chart, or on <b>Thursday</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> 6th hour, Jupiter. Each year this will shift another day and 6 hours. It will take 28 years for Tekufat Nissan to return to being on Wednesday at twilight. It is worth noting that the true spring equinox occurs on March 21 yet Birkat Hachama is said 18 days later. This inaccuracy accrued over thousands of years as a result of using the inexact calculation of Samuel for the length of the year.|$|E

500|$|Today, {{the square}} offers {{a clear view}} of Buffalo City Hall, an Art Deco {{building}} three blocks to the west. [...] A granite Civil War monument, titled Soldiers and Sailors, gives a strong vertical and ceremonial definition to the space. [...] Conceived by Mrs. Horatio Seymour, the monument's dedication ceremony was attended by Grover Cleveland and other prominent figures.

2500|$|There was {{initially}} some {{speculation about the}} speech. [...] "White House advisors said Friday that Obama would not shy away from addressing 'tough issues' in the speech on <b>Thursday</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> University of Cairo." [...] In April and May 2009, the U.S. President had met in succession King Abdullah II of Jordan, Israeli Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu and President of the Palestinian National Authority Mahmoud Abbas to elaborate a peace plan in the Middle East. Arguments and ideas were exchanged during these three meetings, but few details were given about Obama's plan on the Middle East.|$|E
2500|$|In the Eastern Orthodox and Eastern Catholic churches, {{confirmation}} {{is known}} as chrismation. The Mystery of Chrismation is performed immediately after the Mystery of Baptism {{as part of a}} single ceremony. The ritual employs the sacred myron ( [...] , [...] "chrism"), which is said to contain a remnant of oil blessed by the Twelve Apostles. In order to maintain the apostolic blessing unbroken, the container is never completely emptied but it is refilled as needed, usually at a ceremony held on Holy <b>Thursday</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Patriarchate of Constantinople or the patriarchal cathedrals of the autocephalous churches. At the Patriarchate of Constantinople, the process is under the care of the Archontes Myrepsoi, lay officials of the Patriarchate. Various members of the clergy may also participate in the preparation, but the Consecration itself is always performed by the Patriarch or a bishop deputed by him for that purpose. The new myron contains olive oil, myrrh, and numerous spices and perfumes. This myron is normally kept on the Holy Table or on the Table of Oblation. During chrismation, the [...] "newly illuminate" [...] person is anointed by using the myron to make {{the sign of the cross}} on the forehead, eyes, nostrils, lips, both ears, breast, hands, and feet. The priest uses a special brush for this purpose. Prior to the 20th century, the myron was also used for the anointing of Orthodox monarchs.|$|E

60|$|It {{is hard to}} have {{anything}} to do with the good people without getting a mark from them. My brave nurse didn't escape no more than another. She was one <b>Thursday</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> market of Enniscorthy, when what did she see walking among the tubs of butter but the Dark Man, very hungry-looking, and taking a scoop out of one tub and out of another. 'Oh, sir,' says she, very foolish, 'I hope your lady is well, and the baby.' 'Pretty well, thank you,' says he, rather frightened like. 'How do I look in this new suit?' says he, getting to one side of her. 'I can't see you plain at all, sir,' says she. 'Well, now?' says he, getting round her back to the other side. 'Musha, indeed, sir, your coat looks no better than a withered dock-leaf.' 'Maybe, then,' says he, 'it will be different now,' and he struck the eye next him with a switch. Friends, she never saw a glimmer after with that one till the day of her death.|$|E
60|$|What could poor Ethel do? In his plausible, affectionate manner--and all {{for her own}} good, too--Cecil talked {{her over}} quickly between love and {{business}} experience, coaxing kisses and nine per cent. interest, endearing names and knowledge of West Indian affairs, till helpless little Ethel willingly promised {{to give up her}} poor little three hundred, and even arranged to meet Cecil secretly on <b>Thursday</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Bank of England, about Colonial Office dinner-hour, to effect the transfer on her own account, without saying a single word about it to Aunt Emily or Mr. Cartwright. Cecil's conscience--for he had a conscience, though he did his best to stifle it--gave him a bitter twinge every now and then, as one question after another drove him time after time into a fresh bit of deceit; but he tried to smile and smile and be a villain as unconcernedly and lightly as possible. Once only {{towards the end of the}} evening, when everything was settled, and Cecil had talked about his passage, and the important business with which he was entrusted, at full length, a gleam of suspicion seemed to flash for a single second across poor Ethel's deluded little brains. Jamaica--promotion--three hundred pounds--it was all so sudden and so connected; could Cecil himself be trying to deceive her, and using her money for his wild treasure hunt? The doubt was horrible, degrading, unworthy of her or him; and yet somehow for a single moment she could not help half-unconsciously entertaining it.|$|E

60|$|But she {{was highly}} ambitious, and she played her game with great skill and great caution. Her doors were {{not open to}} all callers;--were shut even to some who find but few doors closed against them;--were shut {{occasionally}} to those whom she most specially wished to see within them. She knew how to allure by denying, {{and to make the}} gift rich by delaying it. We are told by the Latin proverb that he who gives quickly gives twice; but I say that she who gives quickly seldom gives more than half. When in the early spring the Duke of Omnium first knocked at Madame Max Goesler's door, he was informed that she was not at home. The Duke felt very cross as he handed his card out from his dark green brougham,--on the panel of which there was no blazon to tell the owner's rank. He was very cross. She had told him that she was always at home between four and six on a Thursday. He had condescended to remember the information, and had acted upon it,--and now she was not at home! She was not at home, though he had come on a <b>Thursday</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> very hour she had named to him. Any duke would have been cross, but the Duke of Omnium was particularly cross. No;--he certainly would give himself no further trouble by going to the cottage in Park Lane. And yet Madame Max Goesler had been in her own drawing-room, while the Duke was handing out his card from the brougham below.|$|E
