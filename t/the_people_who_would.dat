5|$|SEN. CLINTON: Well, what Governor Spitzer {{has agreed}} {{to do is to}} have three {{different}} licenses; one that provides identification for actually going onto airplanes and other kinds of security issues, another which is an ordinary driver's license, and then a special card that identifies <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> be on the road.|$|E

25|$|After Catron retired {{following}} the 1916 Congressional elections, Fall lost his only local political ally. However, {{while in the}} Senate he had become close friends with <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> later make up the infamous Ohio Gang, which secured him a cabinet position in March 1921. While local politicians opposed him, his popularity with the residents of New Mexico was reportedly very high.|$|E
50|$|The poem lists <b>the</b> <b>peoples</b> {{which went}} to Kadesh as {{allies of the}} Hittites.

25|$|The Anglo-Irish Treaty {{provided}} that should Northern Ireland choose {{not be included}} in the Free State, a Boundary Commission would be set up to revise the borders between the two jurisdictions. The Irish perspective was that this was intended to allow largely nationalist areas of Northern Ireland to join the Free State, and shortly after the establishment of the Free State this commission came into being. However the commission concentrated on economic and topographic factors, rather than the political aspirations of <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> be living near the new border. In 1925 the Boundary Commission report, contrary to expectations, proposed ceding some small areas of the Free State to Northern Ireland. For a variety of reasons the governments agreed to accept the original Northern Ireland/Southern Ireland delineation in return for Britain dropping the Irish obligation to share in paying Britain's Imperial debts. The Dáil approved the boundary by a large margin of 71 to 20.|$|E
25|$|Patrick Henry {{questioned}} {{the authority of}} the Philadelphia Convention to presume to speak for “We, the people” instead of “We, the states”. In his view, delegates should have only recommended amendments to the Articles of Confederation. Consolidated government would put an end to Virginia’s liberties and state government. Nine states making a new nation without the rest would abrogate treaties and place Virginia in great peril. Edmund Randolph had changed from his opposition in the Philadelphia Convention to now supporting adoption for the sake of preserving the Union. He noted that the Confederation was “totally inadequate” and leading to American downfall. The new Constitution would repair the inadequacies of the Articles. If something were not done, the Union would be lost. The new government should be based on <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> be governed by it, not the intermediary states. The Constitution should be ratified, along with any “practical” amendments, after the new nation was begun.|$|E
25|$|Kricfalusi left Bakshi's {{studio to}} work on The New Adventures of Beany and Cecil for ABC, where he teamed up with many of <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> later work with him on many of his Spümcø projects. ABC had been {{negotiating}} {{for the production of}} the show with the Clampett family, who insisted that Kricfalusi be part of the production as he was a strong proponent of Bob Clampett's cartoon style. The long negotiations delayed the start of production to mid-July, causing much of the animation to be rushed {{in order to meet the}} September deadline. Tensions rose between Kricfalusi and ABC over the tone of the show, leading to an uncomfortable atmosphere for the show's crew. The more ABC strove to soften the show, the more Kricfalusi pushed for shocking and offensive material. The Clampett family were ultimately not very happy with the cartoon, but remained supportive of Kricfalusi. ABC cancelled the show after six episodes, finding the humor not suitable for children's programming.|$|E

500|$|Gauthier and Ste-Croix were {{managing}} a youth hostel for performing artists named Le Balcon Vert at that time. By {{the summer of}} 1979, Ste-Croix had been developing the idea of turning the Balcon Vert and the talented performers who lived there into an organized performing troupe. As part of a publicity stunt to convince the Quebec government to help fund his production, Ste-Croix walked the [...] from Baie-Saint-Paul to Quebec City on stilts. The ploy worked, giving the three men the money to create Les Échassiers de Baie-Saint-Paul. Employing many of <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> later make up Cirque du Soleil, Les Échassiers toured Quebec {{during the summer of}} 1980.|$|E

500|$|The Moon Shaped Pool tour drew {{criticism}} for its {{inclusion of a}} date in Tel Aviv on 19 July, disregarding the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions campaign for an international cultural boycott of Israel. Radiohead were subject to protests at some concerts, where sections of the audience unfurled Palestinian flags. On 23 April, more than 50 prominent figures, including musician Roger Waters, whose 2017 album Is This the Life We Really Want? was produced by Godrich, signed a petition urging Radiohead to cancel the show. Yorke told Rolling Stone he found the criticism [...] "extremely upsetting ... choose to, rather than engage with us personally, throw shit at us in public. It's deeply disrespectful to assume that we're either being misinformed or that we're so retarded we can't make these decisions ourselves. I thought it was patronising in the extreme." [...] He felt the criticisms created [...] "divisive energy" [...] rather than [...] "bring people together". Godrich added {{that he did not}} [...] "believe in cultural boycotts ... I don't think they're positive, ever ... The people you'd be denying [...] are <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> agree with you and don't necessarily agree with their government." [...] Waters responded in a public statement saying he had written to Yorke months earlier, but that Yorke had replied angrily and not replied to further correspondence. On 11 July, filmmaker Ken Loach wrote in the Independent that [...] " [...] stubborn refusal to engage with the many critics of their ill-advised concert in Tel Aviv suggests to me that they only want to hear one side – the one that supports apartheid... Radiohead need to decide if they stand with the oppressed or with the oppressor." [...] Yorke responded in a statement: [...] "Playing in a country isn't the same as endorsing the government. Music, art and academia is about crossing borders not building them, about open minds not closed ones, about shared humanity, dialogue and freedom of expression." [...] The show went ahead as planned, with Yorke telling the audience: [...] "A lot was said about this, but in the end we played some music." ...|$|E
5000|$|Coming to London at {{the request}} of William Sharp (1749-1824), the engraver, Southcott began selling paper [...] "seals of the Lord" [...] at prices varying from twelve shillings to a guinea.

60|$|I {{have heard}} that in some debating clubs there is a rule that the members may discuss {{anything}} except religion and politics. I cannot imagine what they do discuss; but it is quite evident that they have ruled out the only two subjects which are either important or amusing. The thing {{is a part of}} a certain modern tendency to avoid things because they lead to warmth; whereas, obviously, we ought, even in a social sense, to seek those things specially. The warmth of the discussion {{is as much a part}} of hospitality as the warmth of the fire. And it is singularly suggestive that in English literature the two things have died together. <b>The</b> very <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> blame Dickens for his sentimental hospitality are <b>the</b> very <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> also blame him for his narrow political conviction. <b>The</b> very <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> mock him for his narrow radicalism are those <b>who</b> <b>would</b> mock him for his broad fireside. Real conviction and real charity are much nearer than people suppose. Dickens was capable of loving all men; but he refused to love all opinions. The modern humanitarian can love all opinions, but he cannot love all men; he seems, sometimes, in the ecstasy of his humanitarianism, even to hate them all. He can love all opinions, including the opinion that men are unlovable.|$|R

2500|$|In March 2014, {{executive}} producer John Lasseter explained that Disney {{had changed the}} name to improve the film's appeal to the four quadrants: [...] "There was an audience perception that these movies were just for little girls but when boys, men, whatever actually see these movies they like them. So on Rapunzel … we changed the name and we called it Tangled.

RSF in any case does not recognise the Single European Act, Maastricht Treaty, Amsterdam Treaty, Treaty of Nice and Treaty of Lisbon as it applies to Ireland, because these agreements were ratified by what it sees as completely [...] "illegitimate" [...] regimes at Leinster House in Dublin and (for the north) Westminster Palace in London.|$|E

2500|$|In January 2006, USINT Havana began {{displaying}} {{messages on}} a scrolling [...] "electronic billboard" [...] {{in the windows}} of their top floor, including the George Burns quotation, [...] "How sad that all <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> know how to run this country are driving taxis or cutting hair." [...] Following a protest march, the Cuban government erected a large number of poles, carrying black flags with single white stars, obscuring the messages. In June 2006, Granma International referred to the billboard as [...] "the systematic launching of the crudest insults of our people via the electronic billboard, which, in violation of the most elemental regulations of international law, they think they can maintain with impunity on the facade of that imperial lair." ...|$|E
2500|$|.....seemed to us {{necessary}} {{to ensure that the}} pattern of local government was such as to make the planning of development and the organisation of services fully effective, and to make certain that new development, such as houses, main roads, bridges and shops would match the growth and location of industry instead of perpetuating the patterns of the past. We were impressed by the need on Tees-side for more housing to relieve overcrowding, to replace outworn properties, and to meet the increase in population due to industrial expansion. Yet unless Teesside could be planned as a whole, it seemed to us impossible to ensure that new houses would be built in places most convenient for <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> live in them, as it was difficult for the present ten separate housing authorities, each with their own housing list, to do other than build within or near their own boundaries...|$|E
