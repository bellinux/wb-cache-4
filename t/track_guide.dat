25|$|The force {{accelerating}} a pinewood derby car is gravity; {{the opposing}} forces are friction and air drag. Therefore, car modifications {{are aimed at}} maximizing the potential energy in the car design and minimizing the air drag and the friction that occurs when the wheel spins on the axle, contacts the axle head or car body, or contacts the <b>track</b> <b>guide</b> rail. Friction due to air drag is a minor, although not insignificant, factor. The wheel tread can be sanded or turned on a lathe and the inner surface of the hub can be tapered to minimize the contact area between the hub and body. Polishing the wheel, especially the inner hub, with a plastic polish can also reduce friction. Often one front wheel is raised slightly {{so that it does}} not contact the track and add to the rolling resistance. Axles are filed or turned on a lathe to remove the burr and crimp marks and polished smooth. More extensive modifications involve tapering the axle head and cutting a notch to minimize the wheel-to-axle contact area. Packs can establish additional rules for what, if any, modifications are allowed. In some areas, no changes can be made to the axles or wheels.|$|E

50|$|ITV's first {{broadcast}} {{was at the}} 1997 Australian Grand Prix featuring Jim Rosenthal {{along with}} Simon Taylor and Tony Jardine as expert analysts along with Murray Walker and Martin Brundle as the commentators. The pitlane reporters James Allen and Louise Goodman stayed on {{for the whole of}} ITV's coverage over 11 years. ITV had set about focusing their efforts into more in-depth pre and post-race analysis, better camera angles and conducting more interviews. Rosenthal, Taylor and Jardine all presented from a studio {{with a view of the}} paddock and the studio was transported to all the races. One feature for 1997 was known as 'Inside F1' where a driver would demonstrate a certain piece of equipment on a Formula One car and would summarise what operations the equipment performed along with its effects. There was also a <b>track</b> <b>guide</b> using a computer simulation provided by Psygnosis also for 1997. The post-race qualifying and race coverage was mainly a discussion between the presenter and the experts going over the key facts of what occurred. In the same year, Simon Taylor was left unable to broadcast live after feeling seasick during the Monaco Grand Prix when the team were presenting on a yacht that kept moving around. Sometimes the presenters hosted from the ITV studios for the Asian races due to costs of travelling.|$|E

5000|$|Russian {{soldiers}} occupied Paris from 1815 through 1816, {{after the}} defeat of Napoleon at Waterloo, {{and they may have}} introduced the Russian amusement of sledding down steep hills. In July 1817, a French banker named Nicolas Beaujon opened the Parc Beaujon, an amusement park on the Champs Elysees. Its most famous feature was the Promenades Aériennes or [...] "Aerial Strolls." [...] It featured wheeled cars securely locked to the <b>track,</b> <b>guide</b> rails to keep them on course, and higher speeds. [...] The three-wheel carts were towed {{to the top of a}} tower, and then released to descend two curving tracks on either side. King Louis XVIII of France came to see the park, but it is not recorded if he tried the ride.

50|$|The first {{prototype}} to {{be ready}} was that of Renault, that also had received orders for six sets. It was tested between 15 and 23 April 1930. Certain defects were found and remedied, after which the prototype was again tested from 3 June. A second prototype, fitted with a rubber track, was tested between 28 April and 12 May. This other track type was shown to be too weak. The project had as factory designation Renault UE, a chronological letter code without further meaning; the smaller trailer was the Renault UK. The Vickers suspension with double <b>track</b> <b>guides</b> was imitated. For Renault this new suspension type, that he patented despite its obvious Vickers ancestry, offered the solution for severe problems he had experienced trying to adapt his existing suspension models, using single <b>track</b> <b>guides,</b> to a high velocity vehicle without increasing the chance that the track would be thrown at higher speeds.

40|$|Social {{assistance}} {{is an important}} component of the national and international economy and indicates the degree of development of local and national government, being an important element in the composition of the administration budget. A sensitive and, at the same time, special issue of social policies is the need of social assistants, which over time has led to political confrontations, electoral strategies, but also to the construction and implementation of economic strategies in order to <b>track,</b> <b>guide</b> and diminish the number of social assistants and reduce the budget burden. Local and national budgets are affected by the number of social assistants, and accurately categorizing them in well-defined categories can generate targeted policies with varying degrees of implementation among social assistants, depending on the category they belong to, generating social assistance where appropriate, and a reduction in the number of social assistants who should not benefit from this form of assistance.

40|$|Portfolios {{originated}} as {{a collection}} of paper-based resources that represent one’s knowledge and skills(1, 2). In health care education and practice portfolios can be used to provide evidence of skill attainment, maintenance of competence for practice, and plans for professional growth(1, 3 – 5). The occupational therapy program here at USC started using PebblePad in 2013 after it was adopted as the University-wide electronic portfolio (ePortfolio) platform(6). Although initially the OT program had only been seeking a replacement for an existing paper-based portfolio system, it soon became apparent that PebblePad could be used as an adjunct learning management tool to track learning and showcase experience and skills. The OT program at USC has now embedded PebblePad within all four years of the academic and practical curriculum and used it as a tool to: 1. Map the Australian Minimum Competency Standards for New Graduates (ACSOT) across the curriculum. 2. Tag competencies being addressed using digital workbooks for learning activities 3. Track the student learning journey in an online repository. 4. Guide students to develop reflective practice skills. 5. Showcase student experiences and skills as they prepare to enter practice. Developing an ePortfolio that students can use for entry to practice was broken into two phases; the early education phase (focusing on tracking learning) and the transition to practice phase (focusing on translating learning to practice) (7). This presentation will examine how each of these phases are supported in PebblePad from an academic perspective as well as within practice education. This approach ensures OT students are able to understand and document their individual Learning Journey. Additionally, the presentation will highlight the kinds of technical support that facilitated success and ensured that academic staff felt competent to embed PebblePad in courses. In this presentation attendees will: 1. Hear about the broader application of PebblePad as a learning management tool. 2. See examples of workbooks and reflection templates for academic and practice education curriculum. 3. Gain insight into the integration between Blackboard and PebblePad (and ATLAS – the Active Teaching Learning and Assessment Space within PebblePad) 4. Consider how PebblePad could be used to map, tag, <b>track,</b> <b>guide,</b> reflect and showcase competencies and/or threshold concepts in their own curriculum. After the presentation of our learning journey, the session will continue as facilitated small-group discussions (think-pair-share strategy) aimed at identifying where attendees will consider the application of PebblePad in their own programs...|$|E
40|$|Problem/Condition: Malaria {{in humans}} {{is caused by}} intraerythrocytic {{protozoa}} of the genus Plasmodium. These parasites are transmitted by the bite of an infective female Anopheles mosquito. The majority of malaria infections in the United States occur among persons who have traveled to regions with ongoing malaria transmission. However, malaria is also occasionally acquired by persons who have not traveled out of the country, through exposure to infected blood products, congenital transmission, laboratory exposure, or local mosquitoborne transmission. Malaria surveillance in the United States is conducted to identify episodes of local transmission and to guide prevention recommendations for travelers. Period Covered: This report summarizes cases in persons with onset of symptoms in 2012 and summarizes trends during previous years. Description of System: Malaria cases diagnosed by blood film, polymerase chain reaction, or rapid diagnostic tests are mandated to be reported to local and state health departments by health-care providers or laboratory staff. Case investigations are conducted by local and state health departments, and reports are transmitted to CDC through the National Malaria Surveillance System (NMSS), National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS), or direct CDC consults. For the first time, CDC conducted antimalarial drug resistance testing on blood samples submitted to CDC by health-care providers or local/state health departments. Data from these reporting systems {{serve as the basis}} for this report. Results: CDC received 1, 687 reported cases of malaria with an onset of symptoms in 2012 among persons in the United States, including 1, 683 cases classified as imported, one laboratory-acquired case, one nosocomial case, and two cryptic cases. The total number of cases represents a 12 % decrease from the 1, 925 cases reported for 2011. Plasmodium falciparum, P. vivax, P. malariae, and P. ovale were identified in 58 %, 17 %, 3 %, and 3 % of cases, respectively. Twenty (1 %) patients were infected by two species. The infecting species was unreported or undetermined in 17 % of cases, a decrease of 6 percentage points from 2011. Polymerase chain reaction testing determined or corrected the species for 45 (43 %) of the 104 samples submitted for drug resistance testing. Of the 909 patients who reported purpose of travel, 604 (66 %) were visiting friends or relatives (VFR). Among the 983 cases in U. S. civilians for whom information on chemoprophylaxis use and travel region was known, 63 (6 %) patients reported that they had followed and adhered to a chemoprophylaxis drug regimen recommended by CDC for the regions to which they had traveled. Thirty-two cases were reported in pregnant women, among whom only one adhered to chemoprophylaxis. Among all reported cases, 231 (14 %) were classified as severe infections in 2012. Of these, six persons with malaria died in 2012. Beginning in 2012, there were 104 blood samples submitted to CDC that were tested for molecular markers associated with antimalarial drug resistance. Of the 65 P. falciparum-positive samples, 53 (82 %) had genetic polymorphisms associated with pyrimethamine drug resistance, 61 (94 %) with sulfadoxine resistance, 29 (45 %) with chloroquine resistance, 1 (2 %) with mefloquine drug resistance, 2 (3 %) with atovaquone resistance, and none with artemisinin resistance. Interpretation: Despite the 12 % decline in the number of cases reported in 2012 compared with 2011, the overall trend in malaria cases has been increasing since 1973. Although progress has been made in reducing the global burden of malaria, the disease remains endemic in many regions, and the use of appropriate prevention measures by travelers is still inadequate. Public Health Actions: Completion of data elements on the malaria case report form increased slightly in 2012 compared with 2011, but still remains unacceptably low. This incomplete reporting compromises efforts to examine trends in malaria cases and prevent infections. VFRs continue to be a difficult population to reach with effective malaria prevention strategies. Evidence-based prevention strategies that effectively target VFRs need to be developed and implemented to have a substantial impact on the numbers of imported malaria cases in the United States. Although more patients reported taking chemoprophylaxis to prevent malaria, the majority reported not taking it, and adherence was poor among those who did take chemoprophylaxis. Proper use of malaria chemoprophylaxis will prevent the majority of malaria illness and reduce the risk for severe disease ([URL] Malaria infections can be fatal if not diagnosed and treated promptly with antimalarial medications appropriate for the patient's age and medical history, the likely country of malaria acquisition, and previous use of antimalarial chemoprophylaxis. Recent molecular laboratory advances have enabled CDC to identify and conduct molecular surveillance of antimalarial drug resistance ([URL] These advances will allow CDC to <b>track,</b> <b>guide</b> treatment, and manage drug resistant malaria parasites both domestically and globally. For this to be successful, specimens should be submitted for cases diagnosed in the United States and for ongoing specimen collection and testing globally. Clinicians should consult the CDC Guidelines for Treatment of Malaria and contact the CDC's Malaria Hotline for case management advice when needed. Malaria treatment recommendations can be obtained online ([URL] or by calling the Malaria Hotline (770 - 488 - 7788 or toll-free at 855 - 856 - 4713) ...|$|E
