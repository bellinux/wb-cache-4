5|$|Dedicated to Mlle Sacha de Rebina, {{the second}} impromptu {{maintains}} an airy tarantella rhythm. It is scored less richly <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> of the set, {{giving it a}} lightness of texture.|$|E
5|$|The second {{ionisation}} {{energy of}} the alkali metals is much higher <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> as the second-most loosely held electron {{is part of a}} fully filled electron shell and is thus difficult to remove.|$|E
5|$|A {{glass screen}} {{separated}} {{the first class}} platform and circulating area from the platform and circulating area for third class passengers. The third class section was entered from the secondary entrance in Newnham Terrace, and was more sparsely furnished and not equipped with lifts. From the Newnham Terrace entrance a staircase led to a single communal waiting room on the first floor, and to the third class platform on the second floor, much shorter <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> class platform.|$|E

30|$|Children in the {{intervention}} group engaged in more MVPA during <b>the</b> second <b>than</b> in <b>the</b> <b>first</b> week, and more <b>than</b> children in <b>the</b> control group during week 2 (see Table  3). In contrast to {{the intervention}} children, the group of control children engaged in less MVPA in <b>the</b> second week <b>than</b> in <b>the</b> <b>first</b> week. <b>The</b> differences between the 2  weeks in MVPA {{for the two groups}} of children were in opposite directions, and the difference between groups here was statistically significant. Both sets of mothers showed more MVPA during <b>the</b> second week <b>than</b> in <b>the</b> <b>first.</b> None of <b>the</b> within-group differences were statistically significant, nor were differences between the mother groups.|$|R

The port has sold 407,000 units as of September 2011, making one of the better-selling Tales games on PlayStation consoles at the time. The budget series release of the port sold a further 7,229 units.|$|E
5|$|In {{comparison}} with its precursor, Final Destination ranked #3 on its opening weekend with {{net worth of}} $10,015,822, which is $6 million less <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> weekend of Final Destination 2 at #2. The previous film received $53,302,314 domestically throughout its 22-week run, $64 million more than its sequel's gross all through its 16-week presentation. Final Destination amassed $59,549,147 in other countries and $112,802,314 overall, getting $16 million and $22 million more than Final Destination 2 in that order.|$|E
5|$|On May 21, 2009, Virgin America {{became the}} first U.S. airline to offer Wi-Fi access via Gogo Inflight Internet on every flight. Between November 10, 2009, and January 15, 2010, the airline offered free WiFi with a subsidy from Google. On December 17, 2014, Virgin America {{announced}} that it would be offering faster fleet-wide ATG-4 inflight WiFi service from Gogo, with speeds three times faster <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> generation system.|$|E

5|$|On {{its initial}} release week, Ace Attorney Investigations 2 was the top-selling game in Japan across all platforms, selling more than 132,000 units. This was lower <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> Ace Attorney Investigations, which sold 172,000 copies during its opening week. The Japanese sales tracker Media Create theorized {{that this was}} due to Ace Attorney Investigations 2 having less TV {{commercials}} <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> game, and a lower level of consumer recognition according to weekly recognition surveys. They also noted that marketing had been targeting women more than men, leading to an increased interest among women, but decreased interest both among men and overall. During the game's second week, it dropped to fourth place in the Japanese game sales charts, selling an additional 30,910 copies.|$|E
5|$|On {{level ground}} again, {{they began to}} make quick progress. They awoke {{on the morning of}} 27 November to find another glacier (later known as the Ninnis Glacier) far larger <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>first.</b> As with the first glacier, they had to unhitch the dogs from the sledges and slowly make the treacherous descent. Once {{at the bottom of the}} glacier they spent four days {{crossing}} fields of crevasses, battling strong winds and poor light that made navigation difficult.|$|E
5|$|The country's {{participation}} at London marked {{its fifth}} {{appearance in the}} Summer Olympics since its debut in 1996. The delegation included Ruben Sança, a long-distance runner; Lidiane Lopes, a sprinter; and Adysângela Moniz, a judoka. Moniz and Sança were also selected as the flag bearers for the opening and closing ceremonies respectively. Of the three Cape Verdean athletes, only Moniz progressed further <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> round.|$|E

5|$|The ride is {{considered}} to be a terrain roller coaster, meaning the ride experiences various elevation changes. Unlike most roller coasters, the ride's second drop is longer <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>first.</b> It drops through Thunderbolt's structure, which is located at the bottom of a hill in a ravine.|$|E
5|$|The second barcarolle, {{dedicated}} to the pianist Marie Poitevin, is a longer and more ambitious work <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>first,</b> with what Morrison calls an Italianate profusion of detail. Duchen writes of the work as complex and questing, harmonically and melodically, {{and points to the}} influence of Saint-Saëns, Liszt and even, unusually for Fauré, of Wagner. The work opens in 6/8 time like the first, but Fauré varies the time signature to an unexpected 9/8 {{in the middle of the}} piece.|$|E
5|$|The second {{marriage}} of Shaftesbury was more successful <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>first,</b> producing two children.

5|$|The {{second wave}} of the 1918 {{pandemic}} was much deadlier <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>first.</b> The first wave had resembled typical flu epidemics; those most at risk were the sick and elderly, while younger, healthier people recovered easily.

In 1998, Twice received its North American premiere in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada and was also given in the United States, (by the New York Philharmonic,) Italy, Belgium and the Netherlands. In these last two countries composer Oliver Knussen conducted. The work has continued to receive international performances, for example by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra in 2009.|$|E
5|$|Young Ku Yun, 8th dan (ITF), {{has been}} {{described}} as having introduced taekwondo to Sydney in 1971.

5|$|A second movie, titled Terry, {{focused on}} the Marathon of Hope, was {{produced}} by the CTV Television Network in 2005. Fox was portrayed by Shawn Ashmore. He is not an amputee; digital editing was used to superimpose a prosthesis over his real leg. The film was endorsed by Fox's family, and portrayed his attitude more positively <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> movie. Canadian National Basketball Association star Steve Nash, who himself was inspired by Fox {{when he was a}} child, directed a 2010 documentary Into the Wind, which aired on ESPN as part of its 30 for 30 series.|$|E

Therefore, the route of the second cell was more direct and predictable <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>first,</b> following the general movement of the cold front (see conditions and climatology), and the Bureau of Meteorology issued warnings to all residents in the second cell's projected path to expect further storm activity.|$|E
5|$|A {{video of}} the Stockholm {{performance}} of the Final Fantasy VIII section was released on September 23, 2016, and unlike the original Final Symphony no album release has been announced to date.

Critics have claimed the concerts {{to be one of the}} highest quality video game music orchestral performances produced, along with the original Final Symphony, with the second tour considered to have simpler arrangement styles <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> but in turn be more approachable to audiences.|$|E
