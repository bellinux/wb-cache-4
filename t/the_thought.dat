In both examples, childish though it be, this Heathen and Christian art is alike sincere, and alike vividly imaginative: the actual {{work is that}} of infancy; <b>the</b> <b>thoughts,</b> in their visionary simplicity, are also <b>the</b> <b>thoughts</b> of infancy, but in their solemn virtue they are <b>the</b> <b>thoughts</b> of men.|$|R
5|$|A {{description}} of thought content would describe a patient's delusions, overvalued ideas, obsessions, phobias and preoccupations. Abnormalities of thought content are established by exploring individuals' thoughts in an open-ended conversational manner {{with regard to}} their intensity, salience, the emotions associated with <b>the</b> <b>thoughts,</b> <b>the</b> extent to which <b>the</b> <b>thoughts</b> are experienced as one's own and under one's control, and the degree of belief or conviction associated with <b>the</b> <b>thoughts.</b>|$|R

Although I could not decipher their meaning, it was impossible for me to think of them as having been entirely accidental. The feeling is constantly growing on me that I had been the first to hear the greeting of one planet to another.|$|E
5|$|Kristin Cavallari {{caught the}} bouquet at the wedding, and assumed the series' lead {{beginning}} {{in the second half}} of the season. She began a casual relationship with Brescia, at which point Patridge severed ties with him. Afterwards, the women developed a feud that continued through the remainder of the season. Meanwhile, Montag and Pratt purchased a new house and clashed over the decision to begin a family; Montag wished to have children, while Pratt opposed <b>the</b> <b>thought.</b>|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Brody's wife Ellen {{misses the}} {{affluent}} {{life she had}} before marrying Brody and having children. She starts a romantic relationship with Hooper, who is the younger brother of a man she used to date, and the two have a brief affair in a motel outside of town.

50|$|The Gamesmaster is an omnipath; a superhuman telepath so {{powerful}} that he can hear <b>the</b> <b>thoughts</b> of every being on the planet. However, he cannot block <b>the</b> <b>thoughts</b> out, and thus his mind is constantly filled with seven billion voices unless {{he is able to}} greatly concentrate on a distraction. The Gamesmaster also possesses the ability to manipulate <b>the</b> <b>thoughts</b> of others, and has suggested that in addition to controlling minds en masse (as he once did with Salem Center in New York) he can also manipulate <b>the</b> <b>thoughts</b> of <b>the</b> entire population of the Earth simultaneously (though this was determined by Jean Grey to be a fallacy while in combat with him).|$|R
5000|$|When {{intrusive}} thoughts {{occur with}} obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), patients are {{less able to}} ignore <b>the</b> unpleasant <b>thoughts</b> and may pay undue attention to them, causing <b>the</b> <b>thoughts</b> to become more frequent and distressing. [...] <b>The</b> <b>thoughts</b> may become obsessions which are paralyzing, severe, and constantly present, and can range from thoughts of violence or sex to religious blasphemy. [...] Distinguishing them from normal intrusive thoughts experienced by many people, <b>the</b> intrusive <b>thoughts</b> associated with OCD may be anxiety provoking, irrepressible, and persistent.|$|R

Although it has been stated that Rosebery himself was devoid of any antisemitic views, this was not always true, especially in later life.|$|E

The last stanza enters stumbling upon a pun, but its concluding lines are very fine, and make a sort of recovery with their forcible directness.|$|E

5|$|Before Parineeta, Pradeep Sarkar was a {{well-known}} personality {{in the area}} of advertisements. With 17 years in mainstream advertising and 7 years of advertisement film-making and commercial cinema, he completed about 1000 commercials and 15 music videos. Vidhu Vinod Chopra, the producer, took notice of his music videos and contacted Sarkar to direct some of the music videos of the film Mission Kashmir (2000). After carving a niche in filming music videos, Sarkar gave <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> of filming Parineeta to Chopra. There began the making of the film.|$|E
5|$|Between 1859 and 1866, he {{developed}} {{the theory of the}} distributions of velocities in particles of a gas, work later generalised by Ludwig Boltzmann. The formula, called the Maxwellâ€“Boltzmann distribution, gives the fraction of gas molecules moving at a specified velocity at any given temperature. In the kinetic theory, temperatures and heat involve only molecular movement. This approach generalised the previously established laws of thermodynamics and explained existing observations and experiments in a better way than had been achieved previously. Maxwell's work on thermodynamics led him to devise <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> experiment that {{came to be known as}} Maxwell's demon, where the second law of thermodynamics is violated by an imaginary being capable of sorting particles by energy.|$|E

5|$|Browning, Gyles' attorney, cited a case {{which had}} also {{appeared}} before Hardwicke, that of Read v Hodges. In that case, a publisher attempted {{to circumvent the}} rights of the author of Czar Peter the Great by including all three volumes in one and cutting several pages. Hardwicke rejected the argument, however, declaring that the former case had been decided merely on a motion, and that he had given his decision and statements without <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> he would have given a normal hearing. Hardwicke further took contention with the Attorney General for England and Wales' assertion that the Statute of Anne provided a publishing monopoly, instead interpreting the act as one meant to promote public education and the public good.|$|E
5|$|Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) reluctantly {{responds}} to Fox Mulder's (David Duchovny) call on Christmas Eve {{to investigate a}} haunted house in Maryland. He explains that during Christmas of 1917, a young couple {{living in the house}} agreed to a lovers' pact, one killing the other and the remaining one committing suicide. He explains that they could not stand <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> of being alone after the other died and during the afterlife; they wanted to spend all eternity together. Now, Mulder claims, they haunt the house every Christmas Eve.|$|E
5|$|Despite <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> that {{increasing}} availability to emergency medicine will improve patient outcomes, little empirical evidence exists to directly support that claim, even in developed countries. Between 1985 and 1998 only 54 randomized controlled trials related to {{emergency medical services}} were published, implying {{that much of the}} current standard of care rests upon meager support. A similar lack of direct proof exists for the effectiveness of international assistance in promoting emergency medicine in other countries. Although it may seem that such efforts must improve health, the failure to quantify international emergency medicine's impact renders it more difficult to identify the best practices and target areas in which the most benefit may be achieved.|$|E
