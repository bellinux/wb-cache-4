5|$|A year later, the Red Sox {{entered the}} final {{series of the}} season at Yankee Stadium needing only one win over the Yankees {{to advance to the}} World Series. The Red Sox found {{themselves}} up by one game with two games left against the Yankees at Yankee Stadium. <b>The</b> <b>Sox</b> lost 5–3 {{on the last day of}} the season after falling 5–4 the previous day, resulting in the Yankees winning their 16th American League pennant. The Yankees went on to defeat the Brooklyn Dodgers in the 1949 World Series for their 12th World Championship.|$|E
5|$|Of the 70 players picked in {{the first}} round by <b>the</b> <b>Sox,</b> 31 have been pitchers, the most of any position; 20 of these were right-handed, while 11 were left-handed. 19 of the players picked in the initial round were outfielders, while nine shortstops, four first basemen, four catchers, and two second basemen were {{selected}}. The team also selected one player at third base. Ten of the players came from high schools or universities in the state of California, while Texas and South Carolina follow with seven and six players, respectively. The Red Sox have also drafted two players from outside the United States: Chris Reitsma (1996) from Canada and Reymond Fuentes (2009) from Puerto Rico.|$|E
5|$|The White Sox {{brought on}} new manager Jack Onslow {{to begin the}} 1949 Chicago White Sox season. He {{had a problem with}} Seerey, who arrived {{overweight}} to spring training, and did not consider him worthy of practicing with the other players until he got the weight back down. After playing in four games for <b>the</b> <b>Sox,</b> his last coming on May 7, Seerey was sent to the Los Angeles Angels of the Pacific Coast League, ending his major league career. He played for four minor league teams in 1949: Los Angeles, the Newark Bears, the Kansas City Blues, and the San Antonio Missions.|$|E
50|$|Before the 2013 trade deadline, <b>the</b> Red <b>Sox</b> traded Montas {{and fellow}} minor leaguers J. B. Wendelken and Cleuluis Rondon to <b>the</b> Chicago White <b>Sox</b> in a three-team trade, where Jake Peavy went from <b>the</b> White <b>Sox</b> to <b>the</b> Red <b>Sox,</b> José Iglesias went from <b>the</b> Red <b>Sox</b> to <b>the</b> Detroit Tigers, Avisail García {{went from the}} Tigers to <b>the</b> White <b>Sox,</b> and Brayan Villarreal went from the Tigers to <b>the</b> Red <b>Sox.</b> <b>The</b> White <b>Sox</b> {{assigned}} Montas to the Kannapolis Intimidators, also in the SAL.|$|R
50|$|On November 20, 2014, he was claimed off waivers by <b>the</b> Chicago White <b>Sox.</b> <b>The</b> White <b>Sox</b> outrighted him to {{the minors}} on April 3. He was {{released}} by <b>the</b> White <b>Sox</b> in March 2016.|$|R
50|$|August 26 - With a doubleheader {{sweep of}} <b>the</b> White <b>Sox,</b> <b>the</b> Red <b>Sox</b> close to within 1½ {{games of the}} Yankees. <b>The</b> Red <b>Sox</b> win <b>the</b> first game, 11-4, behind Mel Parnell, who becomes the majors' first 20-game winner of the season, and Ted Williams, who slams his 31st and 32nd home runs of the season. <b>The</b> Red <b>Sox</b> take <b>the</b> second game, 10-7.|$|R
5|$|The White Sox led {{for most}} of the season {{starting}} with a tie for first on May 17, held at least a share of the lead for 154 days, and never dropped more than a game behind the leader. The Twins spent much of the season in second place behind the White Sox, along with 54 days in the lead. Despite going 11–15 in September, the Twins took a half-game lead with an extra innings win over the White Sox on September 25 that capped a three-game sweep of Chicago. The Twins maintained that lead through their final game, forcing Chicago to play a make-up on September 29 against the Tigers which had been rained out earlier that month. The White Sox won, 8–2, leaving <b>the</b> <b>Sox</b> and Twins tied atop the AL Central with 88–74 records, forcing a tie-breaker to decide the division. Tickets for the tie-breaker sold out within an hour {{of the end of the}} September 29 game.|$|E
5|$|Years {{later in}} 1967, Red Sox pitcher Billy Rohr came {{within a single}} strike of a no-hitter at Yankee Stadium. Elston Howard hit a two-out, two-strike single in the ninth to break the no-hit bid. Rohr {{completed}} the one-hitter, but ultimately finished his career with only two wins, both coming against the Yankees. Later that year, Red Sox third baseman Joe Foy hit a grand slam during {{the first game of}} a two-game series. In the second game, Yankee pitcher Thad Tillotson threw two brushback pitches at Foy before beaning him in the batting helmet. In the next inning, Red Sox pitcher Jim Lonborg beaned Tillotson. Both pitchers yelled at each other, and then a brawl ensued. During the fight, Red Sox outfielder Reggie Smith picked up and body-slammed Tillotson to the ground. Just two months later, both teams were involved in the longest game ever played (by innings) at Yankee Stadium. New York recorded a 20-inning, 4–3 victory over Boston. Earlier that year on August 3, the Yankees traded Howard, the first African-American player in franchise history, to the Red Sox to help bolster their team during the pennant race. When Howard returned to Yankee Stadium in a Red Sox uniform, the Yankee fans gave him a standing ovation. Boston would be led by Hall of Famer Carl Yastrzemski's historic season winning the batting triple crown, leading the Red Sox to the pennant in what was a dream year for <b>the</b> <b>Sox.</b> Howard's contribution would be instrumental in the 1967 World Series, but he and Yastrzemski would lose to Bob Gibson and the St. Louis Cardinals four games to three.|$|E
25|$|In the playoffs, the Red Sox {{swept the}} Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim in the ALDS. Facing the Cleveland Indians in the ALCS, Josh Beckett won Game 1 but <b>the</b> <b>Sox</b> stumbled, losing {{the next three}} games. Facing a 3–1 deficit and a must-win situation, Beckett pitched eight innings while {{surrendering}} only one run and striking out 11 in a masterful Game 5 win. <b>The</b> <b>Sox</b> captured their twelfth American League pennant by outscoring the Indians 30–5 over the final three games, winning the final two games at Fenway Park.|$|E
50|$|During the 2003 off-season, Ordonez {{was almost}} traded to <b>the</b> Boston Red <b>Sox.</b> <b>The</b> Red <b>Sox</b> and Texas Rangers {{had been in}} discussions for weeks about Boston {{acquiring}} the reigning American League MVP, SS Alex Rodriguez for outfielder Manny Ramirez. <b>The</b> Red <b>Sox</b> then agreed in principle to trade its incumbent SS Nomar Garciaparra to <b>the</b> White <b>Sox</b> for Ordonez. When the Rodriguez-for-Ramirez trade fell through, <b>the</b> Red <b>Sox</b> decided to not trade Garciaparra and the Ordonez trade was called off as well.|$|R
50|$|From 1950 to 1958, the Colorado Springs Sky Sox were a Class A {{affiliate}} of <b>the</b> Chicago White <b>Sox</b> in <b>the</b> Western League. <b>The</b> Sky <b>Sox's</b> nickname originated with their affiliation with <b>the</b> White <b>Sox.</b> <b>The</b> Pikes Peak region was without professional baseball for 30 years until 1988, when the Hawaii Islanders of the PCL relocated to Colorado Springs {{and became the}} second incarnation of <b>the</b> Sky <b>Sox.</b> From 1988 to 1992 <b>the</b> Sky <b>Sox</b> were <b>the</b> Triple-A {{affiliate of}} the Cleveland Indians. When Denver was awarded a major league franchise for the 1993 season, the new Colorado Rockies arranged for <b>the</b> Sky <b>Sox</b> to become their top farm team.|$|R

25|$|Sox family: <b>The</b> <b>Sox</b> {{family of}} {{transcription}} factors {{is associated with}} maintaining pluripotency similar to Oct-3/4, although it is associated with multipotent and unipotent stem cells in contrast with Oct-3/4, which is exclusively expressed in pluripotent stem cells.

Sox1 yields iPS cells with a similar efficiency as Sox2, and genes Sox3, Sox15, and Sox18 also generate iPS cells, although with decreased efficiency.|$|E
25|$|In {{the series}} opener, Joe Kelly was rocked for 7 earned runs in 3 innings, leaving the Red Sox {{in a big}} hole due to Josh Donaldson's grand slam, but Brock Holt would hit a grand slam {{of his own and}} <b>the</b> <b>Sox</b> would win the game after a furious {{comeback}} effort. The next day, the Red Sox tagged knuckleballer R.A. Dickey for 7 runs to improve to 3-1. However, <b>the</b> <b>Sox</b> lost the third game of the series as two runs given up by Steven Wright in the first inning proved to make all the difference as the Red Sox failed to score 6+ runs in a game {{for the first time this}} season.|$|E
25|$|Catcher Christian Vazquez {{returned}} to the Red Sox lineup {{for the first time}} since 2014 after undergoing Tommy John surgery, going 2-for-4 and making some great defensive plays. Travis Shaw's 2 2-out RBI made the difference as <b>the</b> <b>Sox</b> backed Porcello for a win. David Price earned his first home win the next day after his solid pitching was supported by Xander Bogaerts's 3-run home run. But much like the previous weekend, <b>the</b> <b>Sox</b> dropped the third game of the series after the offense went cold to give Steven Wright another loss despite only giving up 2 runs in 6 innings. On Patriots' Day, Clay Buchholz had one of his best career outings, but it was spoiled after Koji Uehara and the bullpen combined to give up 4 runs in the eighth.|$|E
50|$|In 1986, <b>the</b> Chicago White <b>Sox</b> began <b>the</b> {{season with}} Tony La Russa as their manager, however, after a 26-38 start, <b>the</b> White <b>Sox</b> fired LaRussa and named Rader, {{who was the}} team's hitting {{instructor}} at the time, as the interim manager. In his two games managing <b>the</b> White <b>Sox,</b> <b>the</b> club had a 1-1 record. <b>The</b> White <b>Sox</b> then named Jim Fregosi as their permanent manager.|$|R
50|$|Following a busy off season, {{in which}} <b>the</b> White <b>Sox</b> signed big name free agent Adam Dunn and re-signed first baseman Paul Konerko and catcher A. J. Pierzynski <b>the</b> White <b>Sox,</b> <b>the</b> 2011 White <b>Sox</b> ended <b>the</b> {{season with a}} 79-83 record.|$|R
500|$|After {{being placed}} on waivers by the Dodgers, Ramirez was claimed by <b>the</b> Chicago White <b>Sox.</b> <b>The</b> Dodgers awarded Ramirez to <b>the</b> White <b>Sox</b> on August 30, {{receiving}} no prospects, but with <b>the</b> White <b>Sox</b> assuming <b>the</b> $3.8 million remaining on Ramirez's salary. At the time, <b>the</b> White <b>Sox</b> hoped <b>the</b> pickup would bolster their offense for a playoff push. However, Ramirez hit [...]261 with just one home run and two RBI in his 24 games with <b>the</b> White <b>Sox.</b> He became a free agent {{at the conclusion of}} the season, which ended with <b>the</b> White <b>Sox</b> finishing 88-74, 6 games out of first place in the AL Central, and missing the postseason.|$|R
25|$|In the 2007 World Series, the Red Sox {{faced the}} Colorado Rockies. Beckett once again set the tone, {{pitching}} seven strong innings as the offense provided {{more than enough}} in a 13–1 victory. In Game 2, Schilling, Okajima, and Papelbon held the Rockies to one run again in a 2–1 game. Moving to Colorado, <b>the</b> <b>Sox</b> offense made the difference again in a 10–5 win. Finally, in Game 4, Jon Lester took Tim Wakefield's spot in the rotation and gave <b>the</b> <b>Sox</b> an impressive start, pitching 5⅔ shutout innings. The Rockies threatened, but thanks to World Series MVP Mike Lowell and aided by a pinch-hit home run by outfielder Bobby Kielty, Papelbon registered another save as the Red Sox swept the Rockies in four games. The Red Sox captured their second title in four years.|$|E
25|$|Shortstop Álex González {{was allowed}} to leave via free agency for the Cincinnati Reds. <b>The</b> <b>Sox</b> {{replaced}} him with Julio Lugo. Mark Loretta also {{was allowed to}} leave which opened up a spot for youngster Dustin Pedroia. Fan favorite Trot Nixon filed for free agency and agreed on {{a deal with the}} Cleveland Indians. With an opening in right field, <b>the</b> <b>Sox</b> pursued J. D. Drew, who had recently opted out of the remainder of his contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers to become a free agent. On January 25, 2007, the Red Sox and Drew agreed to a 5-year, $70 million contract. Another fan favorite, outfielder Gabe Kapler, announced his retirement at age 31 to fulfill his lifelong dream of becoming a manager. The Red Sox named him manager of their Class A affiliate, the Greenville Drive.|$|E
25|$|Glover {{opened the}} 2003 {{season with the}} White Sox but was little used, making just 24 {{appearances}} {{by the end of}} the July.

Subsequent interpretations of Lawson, however, suggest that the disclosures of a contractor’s employee are protected only if those disclosures pertain to fraud perpetrated by a publicly traded company, as opposed to wrongdoing by a private contractor.|$|E
