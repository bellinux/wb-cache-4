5|$|In January 2010, {{there was}} a full reading of the one-act version of the play. Despite an {{unfinished}} script and a performance by amateur actors, it evoked a strong response from the audience. Later that year, Stephen Waldschmidt, an artistic associate of Burnt <b>Thicket</b> Theatre, asked to read the script of She Has a Name, and later {{said he could not}} put it down. He was initially reluctant to attach himself to the play because of the immensity and ugliness of the issues therein, but he ultimately worked with Kooman to expand it into a full-length play with an extra hour of material by the end of 2010. The result is a play that can be performed in 90 minutes but may last up to two hours. Burnt <b>Thicket</b> Theatre served as the play's initial production company.|$|E

5|$|The premiere {{took place}} at the EPCOR Centre for the Performing Arts in Calgary in February 2011. Performances were {{scheduled}} to run on the centre's Motel stage between February 23 and March 5. Tickets quickly sold out. Four days after the premiere, Burnt <b>Thicket</b> Theatre moved the play to the Scott Block Theatre in Red Deer, where the play was scheduled to be performed until March 12. All the performances in Red Deer were sold out. The play drew emotional reactions from the audience. Kooman learned that some audience members at the initial performances later responded to the play by talking with others about human trafficking, writing letters to their Members of Parliament, and doing other creative things on the subject. They also contacted Waldschmidt, sometimes up to a year later, with stories about how the play had continued to affect their lives. In conjunction with the initial run of She Has a Name, Burnt <b>Thicket</b> Theatre provided the names of organizations that assist human-trafficking victims. There was also a panel discussion about human trafficking after the matinée on February 26.|$|E
5|$|According to {{personal}} {{accounts of the}} battle, after dismounting Dodge offered his men a chance {{to back out of}} the operation. No one opted out, and 21 men advanced with Dodge in an extended firing line, unsure of the enemy's location. The remaining eight soldiers were posted as guards on high grounds and near the horses. Unlike the disorganized and undisciplined troops at Stillman's Run, the volunteers at Horseshoe Bend adhered to military discipline; they waited for Dodge to give the order before they entered the <b>thicket</b> and swampland in search of their enemy, and once searching they awaited their commander's order to attack.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} impact of {{fragmentation}} in the ownership of complementary patents or patent <b>thickets</b> on firms' market value. This question is motivated by {{the increase in the}} patent ownership fragmentation following the pro-patent shifts in the US since 1982. The first chapter uses panel data on patenting US manufacturing firms from 1979 to 1996, and estimates {{the impact of}} patent <b>thickets</b> on firms' market value. I find that patent <b>thickets</b> lower firms' market value, and firms with a large patent portfolio size experience a smaller negative effect from their <b>thickets.</b> Moreover, no systematic difference exists in the impact of patent <b>thickets</b> on firms' market value over time. The second chapter extends this analysis to account for the indirect impacts of patent <b>thickets</b> on firms' market value. These indirect effects arise through the effects of patent <b>thickets</b> on firms' R&D and patenting activities. Using panel data on US manufacturing firms from 1979 to 1996, I estimate the impact of patent <b>thickets</b> on market value, R&D, and patenting as well as the impacts of R&D and patenting on market value. Employing these estimates, I determine the direct, indirect, and total impacts of patent <b>thickets</b> on market value. I find that patent <b>thickets</b> decrease firms' market value, while I hold the firms’ R&D and patenting activities constant. I find no evidence of a change in R&D due to patent <b>thickets.</b> However, there is evidence of defensive patenting (an increase in patenting attributed to <b>thickets),</b> which helps to reduce the direct negative impact of patent <b>thickets</b> on market value. The data sets used in Chapters 1 and 2 have a number of missing observations on regressors. The commonly used methods to manage missing observations are the listwise deletion (complete case) and the indicator methods. Studies on the statistical properties of these methods suggest a smaller bias using the listwise deletion method. Employing Monte Carlo simulations, Chapter 3 examines the properties of these methods, and finds that in some cases the listwise deletion estimates have larger biases than indicator estimates. This finding suggests that interpreting estimates arrived at with either approach requires caution...|$|R

5|$|After the play's initial run, Kooman {{revised the}} script, making {{prominent}} {{changes in the}} scenes involving Jason and Marta. In the version performed at the premiere, the two characters debate issues of human rights on a solely philosophical level, while in the new version, Marta makes real demands of Jason, making their interactions more dynamic. Kooman made Jason's wife Ali more patient and understanding in dealing with Jason's lengthy absences from home and removed the intermission. According to reviewer Lana Michelin of the Red Deer Advocate, Kooman's changes strengthened the emotional pull of the play. Because {{of the amount of}} interest in She Has a Name in 2011, not enough tickets were available for the initial run, and a second run was planned for the end of 2011. To finance a tour of the play, Burnt <b>Thicket</b> Theatre raised money through fundraisers, which included the 2011 Calgary Ride for Refuge.|$|E
5|$|Shots {{rang out}} from Stephenson's men but the Sauk did not {{immediately}} return fire and the fight eventually descended into a bayonet and knife battle. The militia charged into the <b>thicket</b> and the Sauk returned fire, killing Stephen P. Howard. The militia force made two more charges into the woods. During one of these, Thomas Sublette stabbed a Sauk in the neck and George Eames was killed in action. The third charge resulted in severe wounds for Stephenson, who {{was shot in the}} chest with a musketball, and the death of militia man Michael Lovell. According to Stephenson's account of the battle, five or six Native American warriors were killed and the militia lost three men.|$|E
5|$|Silviculture is the {{practice}} of controlling the establishment, growth, composition, health, and quality of forests, which are areas that have a high density of trees. Cultivated trees are planted and tended by humans, usually because they provide food (fruits or nuts), ornamental beauty, or some type of wood product that benefits people. An area of land planted with fruit or nut trees is an orchard. A small wooded area, usually with no undergrowth, is called a grove and a small wood or <b>thicket</b> of trees and bushes is called a coppice or copse. A large area of land covered with trees and undergrowth is called woodland or forest. An area of woodland composed primarily of trees established by planting or artificial seeding {{is known as a}} plantation.|$|E

5|$|The {{specific}} epithet of the Sind sparrow, pyrrhonotus, {{comes from}} the Greek purrhos ("flame-coloured"), and -nōtos ("-backed"). E. C. Stuart Baker suggested the English name rufous-backed sparrow, but as this name might cause confusion with other species, Ticehurst suggested the name Sind jungle-sparrow, which became the accepted name for the species. This name refers to Sindh, a province now in Pakistan which makes up {{a large part of}} the Sind sparrow's range, and the jungle habitat of the bird (in the word's original sense of tangled dry <b>thicket).</b> This name is shortened to jungle sparrow or Sind sparrow, of which the first was used in the IOC World Bird List, until Sind sparrow was adopted in 2009.|$|E
5|$|Bambi is a {{roe deer}} fawn {{born in a}} <b>thicket</b> to a young doe in late spring one year. Over {{the course of the}} summer, his mother teaches him about the various {{inhabitants}} of the forest and the ways deer live. When she feels he is old enough, she takes him to the meadow which he learns is both a wonderful but also dangerous place as it leaves the deer exposed and in the open. After some initial fear over his mother's caution, Bambi enjoys the experience. On a subsequent trip, Bambi meets his Aunt Ena, and her twin fawns Faline and Gobo. They quickly become friends and share what they have learned about the forest. While they are playing, they encounter princes, male deer, for the first time. After the stags leave, the fawns learn that those were their fathers, but that the fathers rarely stay with or speak to the females and young.|$|E
5|$|Both species {{walk with}} a high-stepping action, and can run swiftly through grass {{with the body}} held {{horizontal}} and laterally flattened. When disturbed, they typically fly less than , frequently landing behind a bush or <b>thicket,</b> and then go into a crouch. In short grass, they can escape from a dog using their speed and maneuverability, running with the body held almost horizontal. The typical flight is weak and fluttering, especially that of the African crake, but for longer flights, such as migration, the corn crake has a steadier, stronger action with its legs drawn up. Flocks of up to 40 corn crakes may form on migration, sometimes associating with common quails. Migration takes place at night, and flocks resting during the day may aggregate to hundreds of birds at favoured sites. The ability to migrate is innate, not learned from adults; chicks raised from birds kept in captivity for ten generations were able to migrate to Africa and return with similar success to wild-bred young.|$|E

40|$|Lantana camara, a shrub of Central and South American origin, {{has become}} {{invasive}} across dry forests worldwide. The {{effect of the}} thicket-forming habit of L. camara as a dispersal and recruitment barrier {{in a community of}} native woody seedlings was examined in a 50 -ha permanent plot located in the seasonally dry forest of Mudumalai, southern India. Sixty 100 -m(2) plots were enumerated for native woody seedlings between 10 - 100 cm in height. Of these, 30 plots had no L. camara <b>thickets,</b> while the other 30 had dense <b>thickets.</b> The frequency of occurrence and abundance of seedlings were modelled as a function of dispersal mode (mammal, bird or mechanical) and affinities to forest habitats (dry forest, moist forest or ubiquitous) as well as presence or absence of dense L. camara <b>thickets.</b> Furthermore, frequency of occurrence and abundance of individual species were also compared between <b>thickets</b> and no L. camara. At the community level, L. camara density, dispersal mode and forest habitat affinities of species determined both frequency of occurrence and abundance of seedlings, with the abundance of dry-forest mammal-dispersed species and ubiquitous mechanically dispersed species being significantly lower under L. camara <b>thickets.</b> Phyllanthus emblica and Kydia calycina were found to be significantly less abundant under L. camara, whereas most other species were not affected by the presence of <b>thickets.</b> It was inferred that, by affecting the establishment of native tree seedlings, L. camara <b>thickets</b> could eventually alter the community composition of such forests...|$|R
5|$|Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn {{takes place}} in the fictional world of Hydaelyn, a planet filled with {{multiple}} environments and climates covering three large continents. The region in which the game is set is called Eorzea. The four major city-states in Eorzea feature a wide variety of climates and biomes: the forest nation of Gridania is surrounded by a dense <b>thicket</b> called the Black Shroud; Ul'dah is a sultanate with a predilection for commerce situated in the Thanalan Desert; the thalassocracy of Limsa Lominsa finds its home in La Noscea on the island of Vylbrand; and Ishgard is a theocracy built in the snowy mountains of Coerthas. Eorzea is connected to a larger continent to the northeast which has largely been conquered by the militaristic Garlean Empire. Other political entities include the beastmen tribes who perennially assault the civilized nations; Sharlayan, a scholarly city to the northwest; and Ala Mhigo, a city-state which was occupied during the first Garlean invasion twenty years prior to the events of the game. The four major city-states formed the Eorzean Alliance to repel this invasion but Ishgard abruptly withdrew, leaving the remaining three allies in name only. This conflict also resulted in the desolation of Mor Dhona, a once-vibrant region {{in the center of the}} continent that is now a barren wasteland.|$|E
5|$|The fruit {{bodies of}} A.abrupta grow on the ground, {{typically}} solitary, in mixed conifer and deciduous forests, usually during autumn. The {{frequency with which}} fruit bodies appear depends on several factors, such as season, location, temperature, and rainfall. The mushroom {{has been described as}} common in the Southeastern United States; in Texas, it has been called both infrequent, and common in the Big <b>Thicket</b> National Preserve. Like most other Amanita species, A.abrupta is thought to form mycorrhizal relationships with trees. This is a mutually beneficial relationship where the hyphae of the fungus grow around the roots of trees, enabling the fungus to receive moisture, protection and nutritive byproducts of the tree, and affording the tree greater access to soil nutrients. Amanita abrupta is widely distributed throughout eastern North America, where it has been found as far north as Quebec, Canada, and as far south as Mexico. Orson K. Miller claims to have found it in the Dominican Republic where it appeared to be growing in a mycorrizhal association with pine trees. Kuo also mentions a mycorrhizal relationship with both hardwoods and conifers, while Tulloss lists additional preferred tree hosts such as beech, birch, fir, tsuga, oak, and poplar. However, A.abrupta has been shown experimentally to not form mycorrhizae with Virginia Pine.|$|E

Waldschmidt suggested that Warkentin audition for the play after seeing her perform at Rosebud Theatre in Rosebud, Alberta. Wong, Krogman, and Kooman spoke highly of Waldschmidt's directing, and Kooman praised Waldschmidt's work as scenic designer. Waldschmidt praised the cast's acting.

5|$|The {{turning point}} in the war came when Burnham and Bonar Armstrong, a Company native commissioner, found their way through the Matopos Hills to a sacred cave not many miles from the Mangwe district, to a {{sanctuary}} then known only to the Matabele where Mlimo had been hiding. Not far from the cave was a village (now gone) of about 100 huts filled with many warriors. The two men tethered their horses to a <b>thicket</b> and crawled on their bellies, screening their slow, cautious movements by means of branches held before them. Once inside the cave, they waited until Mlimo entered. Mlimo was said to be about 60 years old, with very dark skin, sharp-featured; American news reports of the time described him as having a cruel, crafty look. Burnham and Armstrong waited until Mlimo entered the cave and started his dance of immunity, at which point Burnham shot Mlimo just below the heart, killing him.|$|E
5|$|The corn crake is a {{difficult}} bird to see in its breeding sites, usually being hidden by vegetation, but will sometimes emerge into the open. Occasionally, individuals may become very trusting; for five consecutive summers, an individual crake on the Scottish island of Tiree entered a kitchen to feed on scraps, and, in 1999, a wintering Barra bird would come for poultry feed once the chickens had finished. In Africa, it is more secretive than the African crake, and, unlike its relative, it is rarely seen in the open, although it occasionally feeds on tracks or road sides. The corn crake is most active early and late in the day, after heavy rain and during light rain. Its typical flight is weak and fluttering, although less so {{than that of the}} African crake. For longer flights, such as migration, it has a steadier, stronger action with legs drawn up. It walks with a high-stepping action, and can run swiftly through grass with its body held horizontal and laterally flattened. It will swim if essential. When flushed by a dog, it will fly less than , frequently landing behind a bush or <b>thicket,</b> and then crouch on landing.
