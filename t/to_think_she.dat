5|$|Without speech, the Scoobies {{resort to}} {{gestures}} or writing. Humorous misperceptions arise from this gesturing when, for example, Buffy mimes driving in a stake—as though killing a vampire—too {{close to her}} pelvis, causing the Scoobies <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>she</b> is suggesting masturbating to rid the town of The Gentlemen. In the belfry, while Buffy and Riley are fighting The Gentlemen, Buffy indicates that Riley should smash the box from her dream. He misunderstands and breaks a jar beside it, looks up and grins, awaiting Buffy's approval. The clumsiness of the characters' gesturing is in direct contrast to the grace of The Gentlemen, who communicate easily through gestures and other visual signals. Their communication is simple and direct; nods, head tilts, and hand movements, achieve exactly what they want it to. The Scoobies, however, are confused and accomplish {{the opposite of what}} they intend. When they are rendered silent they are also rendered useless, unsure of how to fight The Gentlemen. According to two Buffy essayists, part of the horror stemming from the arrival of The Gentlemen is the silence that makes the people of Sunnydale helpless, easy victims.|$|E

25|$|Ronnie's cousin Sam Mitchell (Danniella Westbrook) has a son, Ricky Mitchell. Jack is {{revealed}} to be Richard's father, following a brief relationship. Ronnie is also pregnant but they agree that Richard will live with Jack and Ronnie when Sam feels unable to cope with parenthood but, having given a child up for adoption, Ronnie can see that Sam is having doubts. Consequently, Ronnie gives her money so she and Richard can leave Walford together. She and Jack marry and prepare {{for the birth of}} their child. Ronnie bonds with Kat Moon (Jessie Wallace) over being abused as children and have given their first child up for adoption. With Jack abroad on business, Ronnie gives birth to a boy called James Branning but he dies of sudden infant death syndrome within days of being born and as Ronnie seeks help, she swaps her child with Kat's newborn son, Tommy Moon. Ronnie soon regrets her actions but it is too late as James has been found and Jack has returned and met Tommy, thinking he is his son. Ronnie struggles to bond with Tommy and refuses to let anyone see him. She is refused permission to attend James's funeral but goes anyway. At the wake, she gives Tommy to Kat but her intention is misunderstood and leads Jack <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>she</b> needs psychiatric help. Ronnie discovers that Michael Moon (Steve John Shepherd) is Tommy's birth father and tries to sabotage his relationships with Roxy and Jack so he will leave Walford but Michael convinces Jack that Ronnie is obsessed with him. Unable to explain her actions, Ronnie agrees that she needs professional help and visits a counsellor but leaves before the session and lies to Jack about it. Glenda realises that Ronnie is not attending counselling but is forced to leave Walford. Ronnie briefly goes missing, and after Jack brings her home, her behaviour becomes increasingly erratic. After visiting the hospital where James was born, she finally admits the truth and returns Tommy to Kat.|$|E

I {{think it is}} really hard {{to do it without}} somehow becoming complicit and exploitative. And so as much as it's important to talk about it, I wanted to be vague and not milk it." [...] Chaiken has also admitted that the use of dream sequences involving Jenny were not a successful inclusion, but claimed it was necessary to portray Jenny coming to terms with her abuse. Heather Hogan of AfterEllen criticized the storyline because there was no conclusion to it, also stating it was never explored enough, leading everyone <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>she</b> was just a jerk.|$|E
500|$|On 5 March 1495, Lisa married Francesco di Bartolomeo di Zanobi del Giocondo, a {{modestly}} successful {{cloth and}} silk merchant, becoming {{his third wife}} at age15. Lisa's dowry was 170florins and the San Silvestro farm near her family's country home, {{a sign that the}} Gherardini family was not wealthy at the time and reason <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>she</b> and her husband loved each other. The property lies between Castellina and San Donato in Poggio, near two farms later owned by Michelangelo. Neither poor nor among the most well-to-do in Florence, the couple lived a middle-class life. Lisa's marriage may have increased her social status because her husband's family may have been richer than her own. Francesco is thought to have benefited because Gherardini is an [...] "old name". They lived in shared accommodation until 5March 1503, when Francesco was able to buy a house next door to his family's old home in the Via della Stufa. Leonardo is thought to have begun painting Lisa's portrait the same year.|$|E

500|$|Series co-creator and {{executive}} producer Weiss praised Clarke's portrayal in the scene saying [...] "Emilia absolutely crushed it. It's one of those weird scenes because it was half shot in Spain, half in Belfast. But largely due to her performance, it works brilliantly." [...] Sackheim, {{the director of the}} episode, noted in an interview, [...] "With the interior, {{there was only one way}} for her to play it, which is, bemused. She's the keeper of the secret. She knows how to extricate herself from this. I thought the ease with which she delivered the lines was necessary for the audience to feel jeopardy for her and for them <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>she</b> was crazy. The sequence outside was all about claiming the throne — or reclaiming the throne." [...] Sackheim also stated, [...] "We wanted to clearly distinguish everything we've seen from the end of the last season and the beginning of this one." ...|$|E
500|$|... "The Same Old Story" [...] {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from television critics. TV Squad writer Jane Boursaw thought the episode seemed [...] "all over the place", and wasn't sure what <b>to</b> <b>think.</b> <b>She</b> stated {{the two most}} interesting parts of the episode were when Walter removed the girl's eye in order to identity her killer, and the cliffhanger at the very end, when Walter states [...] "If you've read my file, then you know the truth about Peter's medical history". Travis Fickett of IGN thought {{it was better than}} the pilot; though it was [...] "laden with lots of clunky exposition and clichéd dialogue," [...] Fickett understood that it was needed to acquaint new viewers to the show. Fickett concluded his review by saying Fringe {{has the potential to be}} a [...] "great show", and he also praised the production level as [...] "top notch", and Torv's performance as [...] "very good" [...] as she [...] "brings a unique presence to the show". The A.V. Club critic Noel Murray gave the episode a C+, while Television Without Pity graded it with a B.|$|E
500|$|... "Sparks Fly" [...] {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} music critics. Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone praised Swift's vocals on [...] "Sparks Fly", commenting that her voice {{in such an}} upbeat song is unaffected enough to mask how masterful she has become as a singer. Rahul Prabhakar of The Oxonian Review considers it [...] "dopamine-infused, hair-whipping stuff". Jonathan Keefe of Slant Magazine calls the song [...] "the purest iteration of Swift’s template and repertoire", also saying that it [...] "could turn things around for Swift, as it’s perhaps the most perfectly constructed single in a career built on tracks that are marvels of pop production and songwriting." [...] He concluded by stating that the song [...] "proves how evocative those turns-of-phrase {{can be in the}} right context. To that end, “Sparks Fly” plays as a template as much as it does as a standalone single, and it’s a testament to everything Taylor Swift gets right." [...] Bobby Peacock of Roughstock claims that he gets [...] "a sense that Taylor is starting to experience a little [...] burnout at radio. Her songs drop like rocks once they peak, and she's currently 0 for 3 on hitting the top of the Billboard charts. While I don't think this song has that je ne sais quoi to get her another 'You Belong with Me'-level [...] hit, I still think that even a slightly lesser effort from her is a worthwhile listen." [...] Blake Boldt of Engine 145 praised Swift, saying [...] "Her infusion of individual lines with urgency (“Drop everything now,” she insists) and earnestness (“Take away the pain,” she pleads) are a tribute to her talent, {{not so much as a}} distinguished vocalist but as an excellent communicator. Each frazzled note is freighted with meaning. Should I stay or should I go now?, she wonders, [...] away the hours before he calls her again." [...] Amanda Hensel of Taste of Country claimed the song is [...] "just another one of those so-Swift tracks that continually toes the line between country and pop to create a genre that is 100% Taylor Swift." [...] Erin Thompson of Seattle Weekly stated he wasn't to [...] "hot on" [...] the song and compared the song to Swift's earlier works, [...] "Fearless", [...] "Hey Stephen", and [...] "Forever and Always", and stated that Swift [...] "puts in a line about standing in the rain in so many of her songs that I'm beginning <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>she</b> watches The Notebook every time she gets ready to sit down and write a song." [...] Mikael Wood of Spin considered it a bubbly tune along with Swift's song, [...] "Long Live".|$|E

500|$|Rebecca Mader's {{audition}} {{scene was}} a fake flashback {{and she was}} disappointed {{that it was not}} used for the show. [...] The character's name was spoiled months in advance of broadcast. [...] Charlotte was originally envisioned as an American; however, the writers preferred Mader's natural English accent to her fake American accent and they changed Charlotte accordingly. [...] Losts writer-producers compared Mader to [...] "a young Nicole Kidman". [...] During the casting process, Charlotte was described as a [...] "successful academic". [...] It was falsely rumored that Kristen Bell was offered the role of Charlotte; Bell had actually spoken to the producers about having a part; however, no role was offered to her. [...] Despite never having seen Lost, Mader decided that she [...] "was not going to leave [...] room until [...] made [...] fall in love with [...] ". [...] Mader subsequently began to watch the first three seasons of Lost and was watching the fourth episode when she received the news that she had been chosen for the role. [...] In the next two to three weeks, Mader– who was then signed on as a recurring guest star– watched the rest of the first three seasons, watching the third season finale a matter of hours before she began shooting her first [...] "Confirmed Dead" [...] scene, in which Charlotte meets Locke and his group. [...] Mader was told little about her character by the writer-producers, except that [...] "she was sort of like a female Indiana Jones type". [...] Mader has found it challenging but fun to play a character with an unknown backstory and motives. [...] Charlotte's full name is Charlotte Staples Lewis, which is an homage to the author C.S. Lewis, best known for The Chronicles of Narnia and various books about Christianity. [...] Lewis was one of Mader's favorite authors as a child and found it [...] "wicked" [...] and [...] "cool" [...] for her character to be named after him. [...] Mader also enjoyed that she only requires a small amount of hair and makeup done, saying that [...] "I just wanted to rough it. [...] I wanted to roll around in the mud with a gun." [...] Mader claims that she has [...] "never had so much fun in [...] life" [...] as when she is shooting Lost. In the episode, Charlotte's birthday is said to be July 2, 1979. This led to a minor continuity error in the fifth season episode [...] "LaFleur", when Charlotte is depicted as being a little girl in 1974. Executive producers Cuse and Lindelof claimed in a podcast that the original script for [...] "Confirmed Dead" [...] listed Charlotte's birthday as being in 1970 and that Mader had it changed because she did not want people <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>she</b> was significantly older than she actually is. This caused a controversy when Mader later stated on her blog that Gregg Nations, the script coordinator, was the one who suggested the change. Cuse and Lindelof later conceded that she was right.|$|E

2500|$|She {{also paid}} tribute to the poet Luigi Alamanni, who took refuge in France after a {{conspiracy}} against Cardinal Giulio de' Medici, later Pope Clement VII. She writes about her [...] "pitiful end" [...] (miserando fine) and [...] "now that I feel my bitter end near" [...] (or ch’io sento da presso il fine amaro), which leads one <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>she</b> was aware of her imminent murder, or perhaps waiting for the natural course of her sad existence. In the last compositions she finds consolation in Jesus Christ and the Virgin Mary, through whom {{she seems to have}} finally accepted her painful existence and tried to find peace of mind, apparently reconciling herself to the land she once despised. Her final hope is to see herself [...] "totally freed from the stormy terrestrial cloud, and among the blessed souls" [...] (sgombrata tutta dal terrestre nembo, e fra l’alme beate).|$|E
2500|$|Although {{it was not}} planned, Zsa Zsa {{was given}} a {{personality}} {{similar to that of}} her on-screen aunt, Shirley Carter (Linda Henry), an established character in EastEnders. During the development of the character, she changed a lot and was fluid until filming started, when Kenny had a full day on set with Henry. She explained: [...] "The words were there and I knew what she was like but when I saw Linda [...] speak and when I engaged with her, I realised that it was like looking in a mirror." [...] When the character was announced, she was described as beautiful, funky, an outspoken tomboy, very bright, but likes <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>she</b> does not need anybody's help. Kenny said of the character in an interview with Soaplife magazine: [...] "Zsa Zsa doesn't like authority or anyone who messes with her. She's a lone wolf and doesn't care about anyone." [...] She told entertainment website Digital Spy that Zsa Zsa is [...] "a real bitch" [...] and [...] "very mean and cold", while a profile for the character on the official EastEnders website says she is sarcastic, a rebel and [...] "desperately wants the security that comes with a family but is terrified of being dependent on anyone. Her experience has taught her that adults let you down." ...|$|E
2500|$|Queen {{said that}} to stand out in the male-dominated world of reggaeton, {{she would have to}} deliver a strong point of view from a female perspective, saying, [...] "God blessed me with a {{powerful}} voice. It is not feminine. It is not masculine. It is just a thick voice." [...] Queen also stated that her achievements are all {{due to the fact that}} she is an artist who, “always [...] something to say, something to contribute. [...] never came with empty rhythm or lyrics. [...] the girl that could write and sing and go to the platform and kill, as we say”. She created music people's bodies could move to but was consistent in standing her ground and standing for agency and women empowerment with lyric like in [...] "Quiero Baliar" [...] where she states [...] "Yo quire bailar/Tu quires sudar/Y pegarte a mi/El cuerpo rozar/Yo the dig si tu me suedes provocar/Eso no quiere decir qui pa la came voy". In these lyric she explicitly states she wants to dance, and her partner wants to sweat, and as long as she gives her partner the go ahead they can provoke her, but it still does not give her partner permission <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>she</b> is sexually bound to them, because according to Ivy, that is a common misunderstanding when regarding certain forms of reggaeton dance. Since beginning her career, Queen has wanted to create and compose songs [...] "that have some kind of subject matter" [...] so that people understand the concept and message. Instead of the vulgar lyrics common in reggaeton, Queen prefers to sing about defending women while touching on themes of social political matters, homosexuality, racism, love and heartbreak. Queen says she writes songs that [...] "put bad men in their places or stand up for the single mothers". In [...] "Que Lloren" [...] she discusses romance from a woman's perspective while belittling the stereotype that men shouldn't cry or show emotions. In [...] "Quiero Bailar" [...] she [...] "berates a lover who thinks that just because they dance she is automatically going to bed with him." [...] "Mi Barrio" [...] is a socio-political charged song which criticizes [...] "the problems present in Añasco, Puerto Rico". Queen compared the song to [...] "Corazones" [...] by Daddy Yankee from his album Barrio Fino.|$|E
