5|$|For {{the next}} {{two and a half}} centuries, Io {{remained}} an unresolved, 5th-magnitude point of light in astronomers' telescopes. During the 17th century, Io and the other Galilean satellites served a variety of purposes, including early methods to determine longitude, validating Kepler's third law of planetary motion, and determining the <b>time</b> <b>required</b> <b>for</b> light to travel between Jupiter and Earth. Based on ephemerides produced by astronomer Giovanni Cassini and others, Pierre-Simon Laplace created a mathematical theory to explain the resonant orbits of Io, Europa, and Ganymede. This resonance was later found to {{have a profound effect on}} the geologies of the three moons.|$|E
5|$|Malaria: During {{the early}} 1940s, quinine {{was the chief}} anti-malarial drug.

The test subjects allowed themselves to be bitten by malarial mosquitoes and when the fever reached its peak in three to four days, were given experimental treatments. At the University of Minnesota, twelve CPS men underwent tests to determine the recovery period for those infected with malaria.

5|$|At the New South Wales Championships in January 1997, Thorpe's time of 3min 59.43s in the 400m {{was eight}} seconds faster than his {{previous}} personal best; {{it made him}} the first 14-year-old to cover the distance {{in less than four}} minutes on Australian soil. Ranked fourth for the event countrywide, Thorpe went into the Australian Championships in Adelaide as a serious contender for selection in the national team for the 1997 Pan Pacific Swimming Championships in Fukuoka, Japan. With a top-three finish and a specific qualifying <b>time</b> <b>required</b> <b>for</b> selection, Thorpe focused on the 400m freestyle after injuries to world record holder Kieren Perkins and Daniel Kowalski; both had won Olympic medals in the event. Thorpe went on to win bronze behind 16-year-old Queenslander Grant Hackett, setting a new personal best of 3min 53.44s. The time was a world record for his age group and the race was the first of many battles with Hackett.|$|E
5|$|The {{northern}} {{high command}} also {{recognized the need}} for improvements to their logistical network to facilitate the transport of sufficient supplies of food, weapons, and ammunition necessary for continuous large-scale operations. By 1973 the 559th Transportation Group, which controlled the Ho Chi Minh trail (the Trường Sơn Strategic Transportation Route to the North Vietnamese) in southeastern Laos, was ordered to expand east of the Trường Sơn Mountains and directly into South Vietnam. The new logistical route, Corridor 613, ran inside South Vietnam from the DMZ to {{all the way to}} Loc Ninh. Besides creating the new extension, the 559th upgraded its entire network, constructing all-weather, hard-surfaced roads to accommodate the modern mechanized army that had been rebuilt since the Paris Accord. The work required two years to complete, but the <b>time</b> <b>required</b> <b>for</b> the transport of personnel from North Vietnam to the southernmost seat of battle was reduced from four months to three weeks.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} rule matching {{in learning}} classifier systems for problems involving binary and real inputs. We consider three rule encodings: the widely used character-based encoding, a specificity-based encoding, and a binary encoding used in Alecsys. We compare {{the performance of}} the three algorithms both on matching alone and on typical test problems. The results on matching alone show that the population generality influences {{the performance of the}} matching algorithms based on string representations in different ways. Character-based encoding becomes slower and slower and generality increases, specificity-based encoding becomes faster and faster as generality increases. The results on typical test problems show that the specificitybased representation can halve the <b>time</b> <b>require</b> <b>for</b> matching but also that binary encoding is about ten times faster on the most difficult problems. Moreover, we extend specificity-based encoding to real-inputs and propose an algorithm that can halve the <b>time</b> <b>require</b> <b>for</b> matching real inputs using an interval-based representation. ...|$|R
