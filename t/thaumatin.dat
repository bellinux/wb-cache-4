40|$|Abstract Sugarcane {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} agricultural crops in the world. However, pathogen infection and herbivore attack cause constant losses in yield. Plants respond to pathogen infection by inducing the expression of several protein types, such as glucanases, chitinases, <b>thaumatins,</b> peptidase inhibitors, defensins, catalases and glycoproteins. Proteins induced by pathogenesis are directly or indirectly involved in plant defense, leading to pathogen death or inducing other plant defense responses. Several of these proteins are induced in sugarcane by different pathogens or insects and have antifungal or insecticidal activity. In this review, defense-related proteins in sugarcane are described, with their putative mechanisms of action, pathogen targets and biotechnological perspectives...|$|R
40|$|Cysteine (Cys) -rich {{proteins}} (CRPs) {{are frequently}} associated with plant defense and stress resistance. Viola baoshanensis is a cadmium (Cd) hyper-accumulating plant whose CRPs-based defense systems {{are so far}} poorly understood. Next generation sequencing (NGS) techniques and a specialist searching tool, CrpExcel, were employed for identifying CRPs in V. baoshanensis. The transcriptome sequences of V. baoshanensis were assembled primarily from 454 FLX/Hiseq 2000 reads of plant cDNA sequencing libraries. CrpExcel was then used to search the ORFs and 9687 CRPs were identified, and included zinc finger (ZF) proteins, lipid transfer proteins, <b>thaumatins</b> and cyclotide precursors. Real-time PCR results showed that all CRP genes tested are constitutively expressed, but the genes of defensive peptides showed greater up-regulated expression than those of ZF-proteins in Cd-and/or wounding (Wd) treatments of V. baoshanensis seedlings. The NGS-derived sequences of cyclotide precursor genes were verified by RT-PCR and ABI 3730 sequencing studies, and 32 novel cyclotides were identified in V. baoshanensis. In general, the metal-binding sites of ZF-containing CRPs also represented the potential vulnerable targets of toxic metals. This study provides broad insights into CRPs-based defense systems and stress-vulnerable targets in V. baoshanensis. It now brings the number of cyclotide sequences in V. baoshanensis to 53 and based on projections from this work, the number of cyclotides in the Violaceae is now conservatively estimated to be > 30000.

40|$|The sweet prayers plant (Thaumatococcus daniellii) {{is widely}} found in {{tropical}} rain forests of West Africa. Local uses are versatile, ranging from cultivation as fetish plant in Gabon to collecting leaves from its natural habitat for wrapping and boiling food in Ghana and Nigeria. The most exiting use of T. daniellii, however, is its use as sweetener or taste modifier. The aril {{of the fruit}} contains <b>thaumatins,</b> a mixture of extremely sweet proteins.

The way how the fruits are collected, is often not sustainable. Integrating T. daniellii in cropping systems seems to be a promising way to lessen these shortcomings, contributing to both income generation and diversification of crop production by small scale farmers. Knowledge on its cultivation is not available. This study aimed at collecting basic information on T. daniellii and its potential for future cultivation. Therefore, interviews with key informants and a field trial were carried out in the Western Region of Ghana in 2002. The evaluation of the questionnaires improved the understanding of production conditions and contributed to identify possible production and adaptation constraints. The field experiment produced information on light requirements of T. daniellii for field establishment and growth during early growth stages...|$|R
50|$|<b>Thaumatin</b> {{production}} is induced in katemfe {{in response to}} an attack upon the plant by viroid pathogens. Several members of the <b>thaumatin</b> protein family display significant in vitro inhibition of hyphal growth and sporulation by various fungi. The <b>thaumatin</b> protein is considered a prototype for a pathogen-response protein domain. This <b>thaumatin</b> domain has been found in species as diverse as rice and Caenorhabditis elegans.Thaumatins are pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins, which are induced by various agents ranging from ethylene to pathogens, and are structurally diverse and ubiquitous in plants: They include <b>thaumatin,</b> osmotin, tobacco major and minor PR proteins, alpha-amylase/trypsin inhibitor, and P21 and PWIR2 soybean and wheat leaf proteins. The proteins are involved in systematicallyacquired resistance and stress response in plants, although their precise role is unknown. <b>Thaumatin</b> is an intensely sweet-tasting protein (on a molar basis about 100,000 times as sweet as sucrose) found in the West African shrub Thaumatococcus daniellii: it is induced by attack by viroids, which are single-stranded unencapsulated RNA molecules that do not code for protein. The <b>thaumatin</b> protein I consists of a single polypeptide chain of 207 residues.|$|E
50|$|The thaumatins {{were first}} found as {{a mixture of}} {{proteins}} isolated from the katemfe fruit (Thaumatococcus daniellii Bennett) of west Africa. Some proteins in the <b>thaumatin</b> family of sweeteners are roughly 2000 times more potent than sugar. Although very sweet, thaumatin's taste is markedly different from sugar's. The sweetness of <b>thaumatin</b> builds very slowly. Perception lasts a long time, leaving a liquorice-like aftertaste at high usage levels. <b>Thaumatin</b> is highly water-soluble, stable to heating, and stable under acidic conditions.|$|E

40|$|Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. conlutinans (Foc) is {{a serious}} root-invading and xylem-colonizing fungus that causes {{yellowing}} in Brassica oleracea. To comprehensively understand the interaction between F. oxysporum and B. oleracea, composition of the xylem sap proteome of the non-infected and Foc-infected plants was investigated in both resistant and susceptible cultivars using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) after in-solution digestion of xylem sap proteins. Whole genome sequencing of Foc was carried out and generated a predicted Foc protein database. The predicted Foc protein database was then combined with the public B. oleracea and B. rapa protein databases downloaded from Uniprot and used for protein identification. About 200 plant proteins were identified in the xylem sap of susceptible and resistant plants. Comparison between the non-infected and Foc-infected samples revealed that Foc infection causes changes to the protein composition in B. oleracea xylem sap where repressed proteins accounted for a greater proportion than those of induced in both the susceptible and resistant reactions. The analysis on the proteins with concentration change >= 2 fold indicated {{a large portion of}} up- and down-regulated proteins were those acting on carbohydrates. Proteins with leucine-rich repeats and legume lectin domains were mainly induced in both resistant and susceptible system, so was the case of <b>thaumatins.</b> Twenty-five Foc proteins were identified in the infected xylem sap and ten of them were cysteine-containing secreted small proteins that are good candidates for virulence and/or avirulence effectors. The findings of differential response of protein contents in the xylem sap between the non-infected and Foc-infected samples as well as the Foc candidate effectors secreted in xylem provide valuable insights into B. oleracea-Foc interactions...|$|R
40|$|Background and Aims The root-knot {{nematode}} Meloidogyne graminicola {{is responsible}} for production losses in rice (Oryza sativa) in Asia and Latin America. The accession TOG 5681 of African rice, O. glaberrima, presents improved resistance to several biotic and abiotic factors, including nematodes. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the cytological and molecular mechanisms underlying nematode resistance in this accession. Methods Penetration and development in M. graminicola in TOG 5681 and the susceptible O. sativa genotype 'Nipponbare' were compared by microscopic observation of infected roots and histological analysis of galls. In parallel, host molecular responses to M. graminicola were assessed by root transcriptome profiling at 2, 4 and 8 d postinfection (dpi). Specific treatments with hormone inhibitors were conducted in TOG 5681 to assess the impact of the jasmonic acid and salicylic acid pathways on nematode penetration and reproduction. Key Results Penetration and development of M. graminicola juveniles were reduced in the resistant TOG 5681 in comparison with the susceptible accession, with degeneration of giant cells observed in the resistant genotype from 15 dpi onwards. Transcriptome changes were observed as early as 2 dpi, with genes predicted to be involved in defence responses, phenylpropanoid and hormone pathways strongly induced in TOG 5681, in contrast to 'Nipponbare'. No specific hormonal pathway could be identified as the major determinant of resistance in the ricenematode incompatible interaction. Candidate genes proposed as involved in resistance to M. graminicola in TOG 5681 were identified based on their expression pattern and quantitative trait locus (QTL) position, including chalcone synthase, isoflavone reductase, phenylalanine ammonia lyase, WRKY 62 transcription factor, thionin, stripe rust resistance protein, <b>thaumatins</b> and ATPase 3. Conclusions This study provides a novel set of candidate genes for O. glaberrima resistance to nematodes and highlights the rice-M. graminicola pathosystem as a model to study plant-nematode incompatible interactions...|$|R
40|$|Plants {{possess a}} complex and poorly {{understood}} network of defence mechanisms {{that enable them to}} counteract the effects of abiotic and biotic stress. Aphid phloem feeding is source of biotic stress in plants. Russian wheat aphid and Bird Cherry-Oat aphid feeding cause significant losses in the annual wheat crop, and control by conventional methods such as pesticide application, has proved to be ineffective. Infestation by the Russian wheat aphid has a particularly devastating effect in South Africa. Aphid-resistant wheat cultivars have been identified but an incomplete understanding of the mechanism of the plant’s resistance thwarts the development of improved cultivars. A two-dimensional gel electrophoresis method was developed, partially optimised and validated {{in order to determine the}} effect of Russian wheat aphid and Bird Cherry-Oat aphid phloem feeding on the Betta and Betta DN wheat proteome. Differentially expressed proteins that were up or down regulated more than two fold were identified using PDQuest™ Basic software and matched to known wheat proteins stored in the SwissProt protein database on the basis of their molecular mass and isolectric point. Initial analysis of the differential protein expression of Betta and Betta DN wheat in response to Russian wheat aphid and Bird Cherry-Oat aphid phloem feeding at different growth stages revealed that younger plants display higher levels of resistance than older plants. Feeding by the Bird-Cherry Oat aphid does not result in the upregulation of proteins implicated in a defence response, which indicates that the damage incurred by the plant due to feeding by this aphid is not enough to trigger a classic defence response. Feeding by the more damaging Russian wheat aphid resulted in a stress response in susceptible wheat cultivar Betta, and a defence response in resistant wheat cultivar Betta DN. The infestation of Betta DN resulted in the upregulation of putative <b>thaumatins</b> and amylase trypsin inhibitors, indicating that the Betta DN resistance response could be due to the combined effect of protease inhibitors that discourage aphid phloem feeding and the activation of the salicylic acid and jasmonic acid plant defence pathways...|$|R

5000|$|Since <b>thaumatin</b> {{crystallizes}} {{rapidly and}} {{easily in the}} presence of tartrate ions, thaumatin-tartrate mixtures are frequently used as model systems to study protein crystallization. Interestingly, the solubility of <b>thaumatin,</b> its crystal habit, and mechanism of crystal formation are dependent upon the chirality of precipitant used. When crystallized with L- tartrate, <b>thaumatin</b> forms bipyramidal crystals and displays a solubility that increases with temperature; with D- and meso-tartrate, it forms stubby and prismatic crystals and displays a solubility that decreases with temperature. [...] This suggests control of precipitant chirality may be an important factor in protein crystallization in general.|$|E
50|$|The {{most popular}} use of T. daniellii is as sweetener. The aril {{contains}} a non-toxic, intensely sweet protein named <b>thaumatin,</b> {{which is at}} least 3000 times as sweet as sucrose. In West Africa, the aril is traditionally used for sweetening bread, over-fermented palm-wine and sour food. When the seeds are chewed, for {{up to an hour}} afterwards they cause sour materials eaten or drunk to taste very sweet. Since the mid-1990s, <b>thaumatin</b> is used as sweetener and flavour enhancer by the food and confectionery industry. Substituting synthetic sweeteners, it is used as a non-caloric natural sweetener. <b>Thaumatin</b> is not a carbohydrate thus it is an ideal sweetener for diabetics.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the role of}} kiwifruit host resistance and, in particular, of kiwifruit chitinases, in preventing infection by Botrytis cinerea. The effects of various host and pathogen factors on disease incidence were studied in artificial inoculation trials. High inoculum loads and addition of yeast extract to spore suspensions significantly increased infection, and most rots were visible within 6 - 8 weeks of harvest. In contrast, the average time taken for symptoms to appear increased (8 - 12 weeks), and total infection decreased when fruit were harvested {{later in the season}} or exposed to a curing treatment (6 - 24 h at 20 °C) following pedicel removal. These findings indicate that kiwifruit can develop postharvest resistance to B. cinerea. A range of chitinase assays, including four colorimetric, two fluorometric, a viscometric and a radiometric assay, were evaluated and adapted for use in the kiwifruit/B. cinerea system. Most published methods proved too insensitive to quantify the levels of chitinase in this system (160 - 6400 ng solubilized substrate/minute/g of stem plug tissue). However, a radioassay resolved two-fold concentration differences and distinguished ng/min/g amounts of activity in plant extracts. For detection of chitinase activity in gels after isoelectric focusing, a highly sensitive gel overlay assay was used. This assay was also adapted for use in petri dishes to facilitate rapid, qualitative screening of large numbers of fractions generated in the process of protein purification. Exochitinase activity was assessed using p-nitrophenyl-/β-D-N,N'-diacetylchitobiose as a substrate in a colorimetric assay. Differences between plant and fungal chitinases were evaluated by measuring exo- and endochitinase activities in healthy and diseased regions on live and autoclaved leaves. Endochitinase activity was associated with the plant, since it was found in both healthy and diseased areas on leaves, but was absent in autoclaved tissue which had been subsequently inoculated with the fungus. Conversely, equivalent amounts of exochitinase activity were present in diseased lesions on live and autoclaved leaves, but were absent from uninfected areas, showing that all exochitinase activity was of fungal origin. Enzyme activity was measured in the stem plug (picking scar wound and the underlying sclerified tissue), because this area was found to have higher chitinase and lower protease activity than {{the main body of the}} fruit. The initial level of endochitinase activity at harvest was not affected by fruit maturity, but subsequent increases in activity during coolstorage were most marked in later harvested, more mature fruit. Levels of chitinase in the stored fruit from four different harvests correlated with resistance to B. cinerea. Curing treatments (1 - 7 days at 20 °C prior to coolstorage) significantly reduced infection and induced activity of a single constitutive basic (pI≈ 9) 30 kDa protein with putative chitinase activity, but did not significantly increase total chitinase activity. At least one basic and two acidic isoforms were present in uncured, uninoculated healthy tissue, and inoculation with spores of B. cinerea appeared to induce new basic and acidic isoforms. Application of chitosan was evaluated as a potential technique for controlling stem end rot. Solubilization of chitosan required an acidic solvent, but use of this solvent without pH adjustment predisposed host tissue to disease. No chitosan treatment significantly decreased infection below the level found in the inoculated control, hence chitosan is considered unlikely to have commercial application. Cation exchange and gel filtration chromatography were used to purify to apparent homogeneity a protein with associated chitinase activity from cured kiwifruit stem plugs. The N-terminal sequence of this protein did not resemble any known chitinases, but exhibited 65 - 72 % amino acid identity with thaumatin-like (TL) proteins in barley and tobacco and 66 % with zeamatin in maize. This represents the first record of a TL protein in kiwifruit. Further analysis of the extract by Western blotting indicated that the previously ascribed chitinase activity was most probably due to small levels of contaminant chitinases. Properties of TL proteins include enzyme inhibition and membrane permeabilization of fungal hyphae. In addition, some <b>thaumatins</b> are sweet tasting. Further investigation is required to determine whether this compound influences resistance and taste in kiwifruit. Overall, the results from this study support the theory that chitinases are involved in kiwifruit resistance against B. cinerea, although the low level of induction relative to other crops and slowness of the response suggest that they are not the primary defence mechanism...|$|R

50|$|Like other PR proteins, <b>thaumatin</b> is {{predicted}} to have a mainly beta structure, with a high content of beta-turns and little helix.
