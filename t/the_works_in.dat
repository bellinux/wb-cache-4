5|$|Construction of {{the railway}} was {{estimated}} to cost £1million. Initially, with the Crimean War under way, the Met {{found it hard to}} raise the capital. While it attempted to raise the funds it presented new bills to Parliament seeking an extension of time to carry out <b>the</b> <b>works.</b> <b>In</b> July 1855, an Act to make a direct connection to the GNR at King's Cross received royal assent. The plan was modified in 1856 by the Metropolitan (Great Northern Branch and Amendment) Act and in 1860 by the Great Northern & Metropolitan Junction Railway Act.|$|E
5|$|Executing {{the design}} was slow: Little was {{actually}} completed in Michelangelo's lifetime (the Cordonata Capitolina {{was not in}} place when Emperor Charles arrived, and the imperial party had to scramble up the slope from the Forum to view <b>the</b> <b>works</b> <b>in</b> progress), but work continued faithfully to his designs and the Campidoglio was completed in the 17th century, except for the paving design, {{which was to be}} finished three centuries later.|$|E

Jassin notes that <b>the</b> <b>works</b> <b>in</b> Nyanyi Sunyi appear more developed and mature {{than those in the}} later collection. Teeuw notes that the later collection was more explicitly about romantic love, rather than the religious love of Nyanyi Sunyi.|$|E
5|$|It is {{uncertain}} if Swift allowed Faulkner to publish <b>the</b> <b>works</b> <b>in</b> {{order to allow}} an Irish publisher to compete against an English publisher or if Swift had no say in the matter and Faulkner published the works against Swift's will. In a letter to Motte in May 1736, Swift did not defend Faulkner's legal right to publish the works but made sure to admonish the attitude and action of Motte as a publisher for prosecuting Faulkner instead of coming to an agreement that Faulkner {{would be allowed to}} reprint the copyrighted material.|$|E
5|$|Matthias {{started at}} least two major {{building}} projects. <b>The</b> <b>works</b> <b>in</b> Buda and Visegrád began in about 1479. Two new wings and a hanging garden were built at the royal castle of Buda, and the palace at Visegrád was rebuilt in Renaissance style. Matthias appointed the Italian Chimenti Camicia and the Dalmatian Giovanni Dalmata to direct these projects.|$|E

5|$|The operas in the Bayreuth canon are {{the last}} ten of the {{thirteen}} that Wagner completed. He rejected the first three – Die Feen, Das Liebesverbot and Rienzi – as apprentice works. Although these have been staged elsewhere and Rienzi was very popular into the early 20th century, <b>the</b> <b>works</b> <b>in</b> the canon exceed them, both {{in the number of}} performances given and in the number of available recordings. The term Bayreuth canon is therefore sometimes taken to mean the composer's mature operas. Georg Solti was the first conductor to complete studio recordings of all <b>the</b> <b>works</b> <b>in</b> the canon, starting in 1958 with Das Rheingold and finishing in 1986 with Lohengrin.|$|E
5|$|Brushstrokes {{series is}} the name {{for a series of}} {{paintings}} produced in 196566 by Roy Lichtenstein. It also refers to derivative sculptural representations of these paintings that were first made in the 1980s. In the series, the theme is art as a subject, but rather than reproduce masterpieces as he had starting in 1962, Lichtenstein depicted the gestural expressions of the painting brushstroke itself. <b>The</b> <b>works</b> <b>in</b> this series are linked to those produced by artists who use the gestural painting style of abstract expressionism made famous by Jackson Pollock, but differ from them due to their mechanically produced appearance. The series is considered a satire or parody of gestural painting by both Lichtenstein and his critics. After 1966, Lichtenstein incorporated this series into later motifs and themes of his work.|$|E
5|$|Finding its {{locomotive}} {{works at}} Kittybrewster cramped and inadequate, the Great North began construction {{on a new}} works at Inverurie in 1898, electric lighting being provided in the buildings. The carriage and wagon department moved in 1901, the locomotive department in 1902, the offices the following year and the permanent way department in 1905; the buildings still stand and are listed Category B. Inverurie station was rebuilt nearer <b>the</b> <b>works</b> <b>in</b> 1902, and is similarly a Category B building. The Great North built houses nearby for its staff, lit by electricity generated at the works, and the Inverurie Loco Works Football Club was formed by staff in 1902.|$|E

5|$|Nicola Griffith is {{the only}} creator to have won the other work award more than once, having won twice for editing anthologies; she was also {{nominated}} for once for her writing. The creators of Buffy the Vampire Slayer have the record for most nominations, with five, one of which won the award. Cecilia Tan has the record for most nominations without winning, having been a finalist three times for editing anthologies. The most recent winners of the award are an anthology of LGBT themed science fiction entitled The Future Is Queer, edited by Richard Labonté and Lawrence Schimel, the television series Torchwood, created by Russell T Davies, and the film V for Vendetta, all in 2007. No award was presented to any of <b>the</b> <b>works</b> <b>in</b> the 2008 shortlist.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} third repulse of the Confederates on the western wing, the 2nd Kentucky and 9th Tennessee regiments arrived from the Mauckport Road and joined the battle, giving the attackers a {{numerical}} superiority. At about 12:40p.m., Capt. Byrnes arrived with the Confederate artillery and used his two ten-pound Parrott rifle cannons to pin down the defenders in <b>the</b> <b>works.</b> <b>In</b> the meantime, Morgan was leading his main body of troops far around {{the eastern edge of}} the defenses and up the Plank Road, threatening the town directly and bypassing the defenses entirely. As they moved onto the Corydon Pike, they shot and robbed a toll gate keeper who refused to throw down his gun.|$|E
5|$|Stephen King criticised the {{reactions}} of some reviewers to the books, including McCauley, for jumping too quickly to surface conclusions of the work. He felt this was inevitable, because of the extreme secrecy before launch which did not allow reviewers time to read and consider the book, but meant that many early reviews lacked depth. Rather than finding the writing style disappointing, he felt it had matured and improved. He acknowledged that {{the subject matter of}} the books had become more adult, and that Rowling had clearly been writing with the adult audience firmly in mind since the middle of the series. He compared <b>the</b> <b>works</b> <b>in</b> this respect to Huckleberry Finn and Alice in Wonderland which achieved success and have become established classics, in part by appealing to the adult audience as well as children.|$|E

5|$|The Bogdan-Pitești trust {{included}} many samples of Luchian's art. Two {{of his famous}} paintings featured there were Lăutul ("Washing the Hair")—which Bogdan-Pitești {{is said to have}} likened to the luminous oil paintings of Paolo Veronese, and Safta Florăreasa ("Safta the Flower Girl")—originally part of the Luchian family collection. Also included was the 1907 oil portrait of Luchian's cousin, Alecu Literatu ("Alecu the Literary Man"). They were accompanied by the 1906 pastel Durerea ("Pain"), which had been reproduced in a 1914 issue of Seara, and by the paintings De Nămezi ("Lunchtime") and Lica, fetița cu portocala ("Lica, the Girl with the Orange"). Among <b>the</b> <b>works</b> <b>in</b> the series were two portraits of Bogdan-Pitești: an ink drawing, copies of which were circulated with Bogdan-Pitești's election manifesto of 1899, and a since-lost oil painting.|$|E
5|$|In 1915, the Corporation {{had made}} {{enquiries}} about purchasing a second-hand steam engine, approaching six locomotive manufacturers, but eventually acquired a new 0-4-0 saddle tank from Peckett and Sons Ltd, {{which was built}} at their Bristol works in 1918. The original engine became a spare, but was hired out to the Blackburn Meadows power station in March 1936. A year later it was condemned by the insurance company, and was sold for scrap to Maden and McKee Ltd, who were based in Liverpool. A replacement was sought, and a third 0-4-0 saddle tank, made by Hudswell Clarke in 1914, was bought from the Olympia Oil and Cake Company at Selby. It was coupled into a goods train, and arrived at <b>the</b> <b>works</b> <b>in</b> July 1937. At the works, as at Selby, it carried the name Olympia, painted on the tanks. The Peckett was overhauled by the Yorkshire Engine Company at Meadow Hall Works between 1945 and 1946. Because there was a statutory obligation to keep the treatment works operational, a special dispensation was obtained during the 1926 general strike, to allow this engine to run over the main line, delivering wagons to Kilnhurst tip. Kilnhurst tip eventually became full, and in January 1948, regular tipping operations ceased, after a new tip at Thrybergh opened. Tipping continued at Kilnhurst sporadically, until it was closed in 1959. During its operational life up to 1948, 2,917,480 tons of sewage sludge was dumped at the site, and following closure, it was sold to the National Coal Board in 1961.|$|E
5|$|With Yerkes as chairman, the Underground Electric Railways Company of London (UERL) was {{established}} in 1902 with a capitalisation of £5million, the majority of shares sold to overseas investors. Further share issues followed, which, by 1903, raised a total of £18million (£ today) to be used across all of the UERL's projects. Yerkes died in December 1905, and Speyer took his place {{as chairman of the}} UERL. By 1907, the three new railways had opened and the electrification works had been completed. Despite the UERL's engineering success in carrying out <b>the</b> <b>works</b> <b>in</b> such a short time, the company was in a difficult financial position. The preliminary estimates of passenger numbers proved to be over optimistic and revenues were not covering operating costs. After bailing out the company, Speyer, with Managing Director Albert Stanley, struggled {{for a number of years}} to restore its finances. This was finally achieved with the purchase of the London General Omnibus Company in 1912, as its profits could be used to offset losses elsewhere in the group. In November 1912, Speyer further consolidated the UERL's control of London's underground railways when he negotiated the purchase of London's two other main tube railways, the City and South London Railway and the Central London Railway.|$|E
