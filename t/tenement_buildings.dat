5|$|The {{topography}} of Coatbridge {{was an important}} feature in the towns development during the industrial revolution. Coatbridge rests 60 metres below the 'Slamannan plateau' which neighbouring Airdrie {{sits on the edge}} of. The low-lying flat ground of Coatbridge was a vital factor in the siting of the towns' blast furnaces and the Monkland Canal route. Although Airdrie was an already established town and had local supplies of ironstone, the Monkland Canal link did not extend into Airdrie because of its higher elevation. The Clyde Valley plan of 1949 described Coatbridge as 'situated over a flooded coalfield'. <b>Tenement</b> <b>buildings</b> in Coatbridge were not built to the same level as Glasgow tenements due to danger of local subsidence from centuries of local mining.|$|E

25|$|Many {{building}} {{owners were}} not adequately compensated for their property. Due to city law, {{as soon as}} <b>tenement</b> <b>buildings</b> were condemned by the BRA, the city became the legal owner. This meant that building owners had no income as rent was paid directly to the city. Soon owners became desperate to sell their property at severely reduced prices.|$|E
25|$|St Mary's Lodge on Lordship Road, the 1843 home of {{architect}} and district surveyor John Young, is the last-surviving (though now ruined and derelict) of several grand detached houses {{built in the}} area around that time for well-off members of the new commuter class. Gibson Gardens, an early example of quality <b>tenement</b> <b>buildings</b> erected for the housing of 'the industrious classes', were built off Stoke Newington High Street in 1880 and still stand today.|$|E
25|$|East of the Bronx River, {{the borough}} is {{relatively}} flat and includes four large low peninsulas, or 'necks,' of low-lying land which jut into {{the waters of}} the East River and were once saltmarsh: Hunts Point, Clason's Point, Screvin's Neck (Castle Hill Point) and Throgs Neck. The East Bronx has older <b>tenement</b> <b>buildings,</b> low income public housing complexes, and multifamily homes, as well as single family homes.

25|$|After the {{execution}} the mob became violent {{and began to}} stone the City Guard. Accounts of events are confused, but what is certain is that Captain Porteous instructed his men to fire above {{the heads of the}} crowd but, in so doing, they shot and wounded people in the windows of the high <b>tenement</b> <b>buildings</b> opposite. The crowd became increasingly violent and, as panic set in, Captain Porteous ordered the guard to shoot into the mob, which led to the deaths of six people in all.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{news of his}} death, senior police {{officials}} gathered at the precinct {{to pay their respects}} and console the family. Inspector Alexander S. Williams and Captains George Washburn, Anthony J. Allaire, William Berghold and Thomas Killiloa were appointed a committee so as to organize the funeral on behalf of the family. McCullagh's personal finances, which had always been a source of speculation and controversy throughout his career, amounted to about $115,000. McCullagh had maintained a much lower estimate between $65,000 and $70,000 which was supplanted with income from property in Irvington and <b>tenement</b> <b>buildings</b> in New York. One of his sons was a student at Yale University.|$|E
25|$|Between 1930 and 1960, {{moderate}} and upper income Bronxites (predominantly non-Hispanic Whites) began to relocate from the southwestern neighborhoods of the borough. This migration {{has left a}} mostly poor African American and Hispanic (largely Puerto Rican) population in the West Bronx. One significant factor that shifted the racial and economic demographics was the construction of Co-op City, built {{with the intent of}} housing middle-class residents in family-sized apartments. The high-rise complex {{played a significant role in}} draining middle-class residents from older <b>tenement</b> <b>buildings</b> in the borough's southern and western fringes. Most predominantly non-Hispanic White communities today are located in the eastern and northwestern sections of the borough.|$|E

[...] He buys whiskey instead and returns to his pregnant wife, who herself had given up on show business for him and whom he abuses.

2500|$|Loisaida {{is a term}} {{derived from}} the Latino, and {{especially}} Nuyorican, pronunciation of [...] "Lower East Side". The term was originally coined by poet/activist, Bittman [...] "Bimbo" [...] Rivas in his 1974 poem [...] "Loisaida". Loisaida Avenue is now an alternative name for Avenue C in the Alphabet City neighborhood of New York City, whose population has largely been Hispanic (mainly Nuyorican) since the late 1960s. During the 1980s many of the old, vacant, <b>tenement</b> <b>buildings</b> in this area became inhabited by squatters.|$|E
2500|$|Geddes' work on Ramsay Garden {{began in}} the context of an urban renewal project that he had {{embarked}} on in Edinburgh’s Old Town. [...] The area had fallen into disrepair, and Geddes hoped both to improve the living conditions of the working class, and to increase the number of wealthier residents. [...] He was also involved in improving buildings for use as student accommodation. [...] To these purposes Geddes rehabilitated a significant number of <b>tenement</b> <b>buildings</b> in slums along the Royal Mile, including Abbey Cottages, Whitehorse Close and Riddle’s Court.|$|E

2500|$|Like {{many cities}} in the UK, Glasgow {{witnessed}} the construction of high-rise housing in tower blocks in the 1960s, along with large overspill estates {{on the periphery of}} the city, in areas like Pollok, Nitshill, Castlemilk, Easterhouse, Milton and Drumchapel. These were built to replace the decaying inner-city <b>tenement</b> <b>buildings</b> originally built for workers who migrated from the surrounding countryside, the Highlands, and the rest of the United Kingdom, particularly Ireland, to feed local demands for labour. The massive demand outstripped new building and many, originally fine, tenements often became overcrowded and unsanitary. [...] Many degenerated into the infamous Glasgow slums, such as the Gorbals.|$|E
2500|$|Industrialization {{also caused}} social changes. The new factory working {{class in the}} cities was housed under {{generally}} poor conditions. Whole families lived in small one or two-room apartments in <b>tenement</b> <b>buildings</b> up to six stories high, badly aired and with insufficient lighting. Sometimes, they shared apartments with [...] "night sleepers", unmarried men who paid for a bed at night. The kitchen in such an apartment was often used as a living and sleeping room, and even as a bathroom. Water had to be fetched from wells and heated on the stove. Water pipes were laid only {{towards the end of}} the 19th century, and then often only with one tap per building or per story. Brick-and-mortar stoves fired with coal remained the norm until well into the second half of the century. Pots and kitchenware were typically stored on open shelves, and parts of the room could be separated from the rest using simple curtains.|$|E
2500|$|While this [...] "work kitchen" [...] and {{variants}} {{derived from}} {{it were a}} great success for <b>tenement</b> <b>buildings,</b> home owners had different demands {{and did not want}} to be constrained by a 6.4m² kitchen. Nevertheless, kitchen design was mostly ad-hoc following the whims of the architect. In the U.S., the [...] "Small Homes Council", since 1993 the [...] "Building Research Council", of the School of Architecture of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign was founded in 1944 with the goal to improve the state of the art in home building, originally with an emphasis on standardization for cost reduction. It was there that the notion of the kitchen work triangle was formalized: the three main functions in a kitchen are storage, preparation, and cooking (which Catharine Beecher had already recognized), and the places for these functions should be arranged in the kitchen in such a way that work at one place does not interfere with work at another place, the distance between these places is not unnecessarily large, and no obstacles are in the way. A natural arrangement is a triangle, with the refrigerator, the sink, and the stove at a vertex each.|$|E
