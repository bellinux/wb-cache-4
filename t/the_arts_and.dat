5|$|The building, though {{based on}} Classical {{architecture}} {{is not entirely}} a Classical building. Its rooflines, main entrance, and the placement and style of the windows are all asymmetrical in nature, a hallmark of <b>the</b> <b>Arts</b> <b>and</b> Crafts style. Its simple massing and noticeable lack of ornamentation throughout the structure connects the building closely to <b>the</b> <b>Arts</b> <b>and</b> Crafts movement. This influence is seen most prominently on the building's interior.|$|E

5|$|Hollamby {{was born}} in his parental home of 6 Wellesley Avenue in Hammersmith, West London.

At the same time, Hollamby was influenced by the modernist movement in architecture to which two of his favourite lecturers, Arthur Ling and Alex Lowe, belonged, and joined the Modern Architectural Research Group (MARS).|$|E
