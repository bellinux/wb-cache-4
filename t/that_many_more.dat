5|$|Like many Australian {{cockatoos}} and parrots, the red-tailed black cockatoo {{is threatened}} by the thriving illegal trade in bird smuggling. High demand and high transit mortality mean <b>that</b> <b>many</b> <b>more</b> birds are taken from the wild than actually sold.|$|E
5|$|The overall {{performance}} of an SSD {{is dependent upon}} a number of factors, including write amplification. Writing to a flash memory device takes longer than reading from it. An SSD generally uses multiple flash memory components connected in parallel to increase performance. If the SSD has a high write amplification, the controller {{will be required to}} write <b>that</b> <b>many</b> <b>more</b> times to the flash memory. This requires even more time to write the data from the host. An SSD with a low write amplification will not need to write as much data and can therefore be finished writing sooner than a drive with a high write amplification.|$|E

25|$|The {{advantage}} of a DH laser is that the region where free electrons and holes exist simultaneously—the active region—is confined to the thin middle layer.

In addition, light is reflected from the heterojunction; hence, the light is confined to the region where the amplification takes place.|$|E

25|$|In January 2001, Chris Gregg, {{a senior}} West Yorkshire detective, was {{selected}} to lead an investigation into 22 of the West Yorkshire deaths. Following this, the Shipman Inquiry into Shipman's activities, submitted in July 2002, concluded that he had killed at least 215 of his patients between 1975 and 1998, during which time he practised in Todmorden, West Yorkshire (1974–1975), and Hyde, Greater Manchester (1977–1998). Dame Janet Smith, the judge who submitted the report, admitted <b>that</b> <b>many</b> <b>more</b> suspicious deaths could not be definitively ascribed to him.

25|$|Johnson {{reported}} to the group's 61st Fighter Squadron on July 19, 1942, in Bridgeport, Connecticut. The unit had just received the first production P-47B Thunderbolts, and, in effect, was flight testing the new fighter as it trained. While the 56th FG was responsible {{for many of the}} modifications that made later variants a successful fighter-bomber, the training resulted in more than forty crashes and 18 fatalities, many of which Johnson blamed on the inadequacy of the small airport at Bridgeport. However, he also asserted <b>that</b> <b>many</b> <b>more</b> lives would have been lost, had not the P-47 proved to have an exceptionally rugged airframe. The P-47 became the first USAAF aircraft to provide an understanding of compressibility and its effects.|$|E

25|$|Michell was {{the first}} person to apply the new {{mathematics}} of statistics to the study of the stars, and demonstrated in a 1767 paper <b>that</b> <b>many</b> <b>more</b> stars occur in pairs or groups than a perfectly random distribution could account for. He focused his investigation on the Pleiades cluster, and calculated that the likelihood of finding such a close grouping of stars was about one in half a million. He concluded that the stars in these double or multiple star systems might be drawn to one another by gravitational pull, thus providing the first evidence for the existence of binary stars and star clusters. His work on double stars influenced Herschel’s research on the same topic.|$|E
25|$|In 1935 Claus Jungeblut {{reported}} that vitamin C treatment inactivates the polio virus in vitro, making it non-infectious when injected into monkeys. In 1937, Jungeblut injected polio into {{the brains of}} monkeys, and found <b>that</b> <b>many</b> <b>more</b> monkeys that also received vitamin C escaped paralysis than controls - the results seemed to indicate that low doses were more effective than high doses. A subsequent study by Jungeblut demonstrated that polio infected monkeys had lower vitamin C levels than others, and that the monkeys that escaped paralysis had the highest vitamin C levels. Jungeblut subsequently confirmed his findings in a larger study, finding that natural vitamin C was more effective than synthetic vitamin C, and as the disease progressed, larger and larger amounts of vitamin C were needed for therapeutic effect.|$|E
25|$|Sociobiologists have a {{different}} theory to Harris. Indeed, his theory and interest in the topic of infanticide is born of his more generalised opposition to the sociobiological hypothesis of the procreative imperative. According to this theory of imperative, based on the 19th-century vogue for explanations rooted in evolution and its premise of natural selection, the biological {{differences between men and}} women meant <b>that</b> <b>many</b> <b>more</b> children could be gained among the elites through support for male offspring, whose fecundity was naturally much greater: the line would spread and grow more extensively. Harris believes this to be a fallacious explanation because the elites had sufficient wealth easily to support both male and female children. Thus, Harris and others, such as William Divale, see female infanticide as a way to restrict population growth, while sociobiologists such as Mildred Dickemann view the same practice as a means of expanding it.|$|E

25|$|As {{the rest}} of the {{battalion}} mobilised to relieve the beleaguered 'D' Company, a patrol from 'B' Company were the first reinforcements to arrive. As the battle continued, a relief force from 'A' Company arrived at a critical moment, on board seven M113 armoured personnel carriers from 3 Troop, 1st Armoured Personnel Carrier Squadron and launched an attack on a VC battalion that had been forming up to launch an attack aimed at 'D' Company's rear. Enemy casualties {{as a result of this}} attack were heavy, having come at their flank, and as a result the VC units were forced to retire, leaving the Australians in command of the battlefield. The extent of the Australian victory was not known until the following day, however, when 245 bodies of dead enemy soldiers were counted in the plantation and the surrounding areas. It is believed <b>that</b> <b>many</b> <b>more</b> were also removed during the battle.|$|E
25|$|On 18 September 1965, {{the largest}} ever {{official}} crowd at the SCG, 78,056, saw St George defeat the South Sydney Rabbitohs 12–8 in the NSWRFL Grand Final. Gates were ordered to be closed {{two hours before the}} game began and children were allowed to sit inside the fence. Contemporary accounts indicate <b>that</b> <b>many</b> <b>more</b> – perhaps thousands – gained other means of access and sat on grandstand roofs or went into the Sydney Showground (Moore Park) and viewed the match from the stairways and roof of the main pavilion. Estimates from people there that day put the crowd as high as 90,000. This would stand as the largest rugby league crowd in Australia until Game 2 of the 1994 State of Origin series when 87,161 attended the game at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. Due to the overcrowding of the ground during the Grand Final, the New South Wales Police Force imposed a 70,000 capacity limit on the Cricket Ground for safety reasons.|$|E
25|$|Another factor {{contributing}} to the park's high plant species richness is its location at the confluence of several diverse and unique floristic regions: the tropical Amazon lowlands and pampas {{to the north and}} southeast, the subantarctic high Andes and altiplano to the west and southwest, the subtropical Tucumano-Boliviano forests to the south (these forests do not actually reach Amboró but many of their constituent species occur within the park), and the semiarid inter-Andean valleys and wet-tropical yungas forests that characterize the eastern slopes of the central Bolivian Andes. Due to the difficulty of the terrain and the almost complete lack of infrastructure throughout the park, much of it has never been botanically surveyed, and it is essentially beyond doubt <b>that</b> <b>many</b> <b>more</b> plant species await discovery within the park's more remote regions. The high rates of endemism throughout the tropical Andes (Amboró is no exception) suggest quite strongly {{that at least some of}} the undocumented plant species yet to be discovered within Amboró will almost certainly be Amboró endemics that are currently unknown to science.|$|E
