5|$|The authorship of seventy-three of The Federalist essays {{is fairly}} certain. Twelve of these essays are disputed over by some scholars, though the modern {{consensus}} is that Madison wrote essays Nos. 49–58, with Nos. 18–20 being products of a collaboration between him and Hamilton; No. 64 was by John Jay. The first open designation of which essay belonged to whom was provided by Hamilton, who {{in the days before}} his ultimately fatal gun duel with Aaron Burr provided his lawyer with a list detailing the author of each number. This list credited Hamilton with a full sixty-three of <b>the</b> <b>essays</b> (three of those being jointly written with Madison), almost three-quarters of the whole, and was used as the basis for an 1810 printing that was the first to make specific attribution for <b>the</b> <b>essays.</b>|$|E

The same year she and her brother, John Aikin, jointly published Miscellaneous Pieces in Prose, which was also well received. <b>The</b> <b>essays</b> in it (most of which were by Barbauld) were favourably compared to Samuel Johnson's.|$|E

40|$|The {{following}} thesis {{looks at}} <b>the</b> Hispano-American <b>essay</b> through <b>the</b> lens of <b>essays</b> by 1990 -Nobel-Iaureate Octavio Paz (Mexico City, 1914 - 1998). Until recently <b>the</b> <b>essay</b> {{was not considered}} a literary form, for the three classical genres of epic, lyric, and drama excluded <b>the</b> <b>essay.</b> By studying Paz's essays [...] primarily El laberinto de la soledad (The Labyrinth of Solitude, 1950) and Posdata (Postdata, 1970) [...] {{in the context of}} their reception in Mexico, as well as touching on the Hispano-American tradition of <b>the</b> <b>essay,</b> this thesis traces the evolution of <b>the</b> <b>essay</b> as a literary genre. The history of <b>the</b> modem <b>essay</b> begins with Michel de Montaigne (1533 - 1592). In his work, Essais (1580), Montaigne, immersed in the humanism of his era, discovers his own voice, that of an individual. Montaigne's voice became possible largely because the unity of the Medieval communitarian way of life, throughout Europe, had fragmented. However, in Hispano-America, <b>the</b> <b>essay</b> did not emerge as a literary form until the nineteenth century, as countries throughout the region fought for independence from the empires of that time: Spain, North America, and France. The rupturing of empires, the fragmenting of a onceunified community [...] in both cases <b>the</b> <b>essay</b> emerges as a genre from disturbed circumstances. The critical voice of [...] ...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis on}} <b>the</b> <b>essay</b> film is written {{from the film}} maker's point of view, {{following}} {{the production of the}} film The Man Who Couldn't Feel and Other Tales, (54 min, 16 mm). The film and the thesis together form the PhD submission. Examination of the completed film led to the definition of <b>the</b> <b>essay</b> film as an avantgarde, non-fiction film genre. The thesis rejects the current positioning of <b>the</b> <b>essay</b> film {{as a part of the}} documentary genre. <b>The</b> <b>essay</b> film creates an aesthetic coherence through the use of image and sound fragments, narrative and nonnarrative structures, 'methodically unmethodically' edited together. <b>The</b> <b>essay</b> film follows Vertov's and Astruc's steps in 'writing' fragments as they occur to the film maker, which are in turn put together using the editing traditions of the film avantgarde and modernist poetry. The film maker's presence in <b>the</b> <b>essay</b> film results in the cinematic 'text' becoming the 'reflective text' - the mediating medium between the film maker and the spectator. Beside its avant-garde roots, the genre owes much to <b>the</b> literary <b>essay</b> tradition established since Michel de Montaigne. Many of <b>the</b> literary <b>essay's</b> aesthetic, thematic and structural elements are to be found in <b>the</b> <b>essay</b> film genre. Each and every essay film is unique in its structure, and the genre as a whole does not conform to a pre-determined cinematic construction. Nevertheless, the thesis charts some useful characteristics and definitions for the establishment of an independent essay film genre...|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>essay</b> was {{initially}} {{published in the}} April 1996 issue of Harper's between the publication of Franzen's novels Strong Motion (1992) and The Corrections (2001). Franzen expanded and revised <b>the</b> <b>essay,</b> re-titling it [...] "Why Bother?", and published it in his 2002 essay collection How to Be Alone. In {{the introduction to the}} collection, Franzen explained his changing the title {{as a response to the}} many interviewers asking about <b>the</b> <b>essay</b> but failing to understand its intention, believing <b>the</b> <b>essay</b> to be an explicit promise on Franzen's part of a third [...] "Big Social Novel" [...] featuring a good deal of local detail and observation. Franzen, instead, thought of <b>the</b> <b>essay</b> as a defense of reading and writing literature for its own sake in a modern world, expanding <b>the</b> <b>essay</b> later in response. Franzen noted that the original title was chosen by a Harper's editor hoping for easy recognition with Hamlet's soliloquy, but that interviewers frequently referred to the work as [...] "The Harper's Essay". <b>The</b> <b>essay</b> makes frequent reference to the Paula Fox novel Desperate Characters, the work of linguistic anthropologist Shirley Brice Heath, Joseph Heller's novel Catch-22, and previous literary manifestos of Philip Roth, Flannery O'Connor and Tom Wolfe.|$|R
