40|$|<b>Thioctic</b> or alpha-lipoic <b>acid</b> (ALA) is a {{naturally}} occurring antioxidant. It has two optical isomers designated as (R+) and (S-). Naturally occurring ALA is the (R+) -isoform, but synthetic ALA {{available as a}} registered drug or as a nutraceutical {{is a mixture of}} (R+) and (S-) -isoforms. ALA has been proposed as a potential therapeutic agent in the treatment or prevention of several pathologies related to an imbalance of the oxidoreductive status. Oxidative stress may have a relevant {{role in the development of}} neurological disorders. Peripheral neuropathy is one of these disorders characterized by myelin damage and axonal degeneration causing chronic pain syndromes with allodynia, hyperalgesia, altered sensitive information processing and impaired nerve function. The present study was designed to assess if compression of sciatic nerve, induced by loose ligation of it, is accompanied by an increased oxidative stress and by central nervous system damage. This study has also investigated the role of ALA enantiometers treatment in preventing damage related to oxidative stress. Loose ligation of the right sciatic nerve was performed in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), used as a model of enhanced oxidative stress, and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) used as a reference group. Animals with sciatic nerve ligation were left untreated or were treated intraperitoneally for 14 days with racemic-ALA (25 and 50 mg/Kg/day), (R+) -ALA(25 mg/Kg/day), (S-) -ALA (25 mg/Kg/day) and with the anticonvulsant agent used in treating neuropathic pain pregabalin (50 mg/Kg/day). Loose ligation increased astrogliosis in lumbar spinal cord and in brain at the levels of primary and secondary motor and general sensory cortices. Astrogliosis is probably related to the increase of oxidative stress in the model of compressive neuropathy used. Treatment for 14 days with (R+) -thioctic acid decreased the number and size of astrocytes, racemic-ALA was less eff ective, whereas the (S-) enantiomer and pregabalin were without eff ect. Moreover, in the brain of SHR neuronal damage and decreased expression of neurofi lament phosphorilated (NFP) protein was noticeable. The number of neurons and the expression of NFP were not aff ected by antioxidant treatment. The present study has documented the occurrence of microanatomical changes in the central nervous system consequent to peripheral nerve damage. These changes are countered by antioxidant treatment being (R+) -thioctic acid the most eff ective agent. This may have consequences in terms of clinical applications...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Impaired {{mitochondrial}} phosphorylation potential {{may play}} a role in migraine pathogenesis. Metabolic enhancers, such as riboflavin or coenzyme Q, are effective in migraine prophylaxis and quasi-devoid of adverse effects. <b>Thioctic</b> <b>acid</b> (-lipoic acid) is another substance known to enhance energy metabolism in mitochondria and to be beneficial in diabetic neuropathy. OBJECTIVE: After an open pilot study suggesting its therapeutic antimigraine potentials, we embarked therefore in a randomized controlled trial of <b>thioctic</b> <b>acid</b> (Thioctacid) in migraine prophylaxis steered by the Belgian Headache Society. METHODS: Five Belgian centers recruited 54 migraineurs (43 migraine without aura, 11 with aura; mean age 38 +/- 8 years; 7 males). After a 1 -month single-blinded run-in period, 44 patients received either placebo (n = 18) or <b>thioctic</b> <b>acid</b> 600 mg p. o. /day (n = 26) for 3 months. RESULTS: Statistical analysis was carried out on an intention-to-treat basis. Monthly attack frequency tended to be reduced between run-in and the 3 rd month of treatment in the <b>thioctic</b> <b>acid</b> group compared to placebo (P=. 06). The proportion of 50 % responders was not significantly different between <b>thioctic</b> <b>acid</b> (30. 8 %) and placebo (27. 8 %). Within-group analyses showed a significant reduction of attack frequency (P=. 005), headache days (P=. 009), and headache severity (P=. 03) in patients treated with <b>thioctic</b> <b>acid</b> for 3 months, while these outcome measures remained unchanged in the placebo group. No adverse effects were reported. For logistical reasons this trial was interrupted before the planned 80 patients were enrolled. CONCLUSION: Albeit underpowered, this study tends to indicate that <b>thioctic</b> <b>acid</b> may be beneficial in migraine prophylaxis. Before any firm conclusion can be drawn, however, a large multicenter trial is necessary. Peer reviewe...|$|E

Oxidative stress has {{a key role in}} the development of cerebrovascular and/or neurodegenerative diseases. This phenomenon is mainly mediated by an enhanced superoxide production by the vascular endothelium with its consequent dysfunction. Thioctic, also known as alpha-lipoic acid (1, 2 -dithiolane- 3 -pentanoic acid), is a naturally occurring antioxidant that neutralizes free radicals in the fatty and watery regions of cells. Both the reduced and oxidized forms of the compound possess antioxidant ability. <b>Thioctic</b> <b>acid</b> has two optical isomers designated as (+) - and (−) -thioctic acid. Naturally occurring <b>thioctic</b> <b>acid</b> is the (+) -thioctic acid form, but the synthetic compound largely used in the market for stability reasons is a mixture of (+) - and (−) -thioctic acid. The present study was designed to compare the antioxidant activity of the two enantiomers versus the racemic form of <b>thioctic</b> <b>acid</b> on hydrogen peroxide-induced apoptosis in a rat pheochromocytoma PC 12 cell line. Cell viability was evaluated by MTT (3 -(4, 5 -Dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl) - 2, 5 -diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay and free oxygen radical species (ROS) production was assessed by flow cytometry. Antioxidant activity of the two enantiomers and the racemic form of <b>thioctic</b> <b>acid</b> was also evaluated in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) used as an in vivo model of increased oxidative stress. A 3 -h exposure of PC 12 cells to hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) significantly decreased cell viability and increased levels of intracellular ROS production. Pre-treatment with racemic <b>thioctic</b> <b>acid</b> or (+) -enantiomer significantly inhibited H 2 O 2 -induced decrease in cell viability from the concentration of 50 μmol/L and 20 μmol/L, respectively.

The remaining 18 patients (45 %) continued to drink but significantly reduced their mean daily alcohol intake (p< 0. 001). No significant changes occurred in their laboratory indices, but five of the 18 (28 %) showed overall histological improvement. Changes occurred irrespective of treatment with <b>thioctic</b> <b>acid,</b> which suggested that, over six months, this drug did not influence the course of alcohol-related liver disease. In patients with alcohol-related liver damage the major factor determining outcome is abstinence from alcohol. In normal circumstances no other manoeuvre is necessary. As abstinence, however, i...|$|E

Herein, surface plasmon resonance and self-assembled monolayers on gold generated from bis-boronic acid bearing a <b>thioctic</b> <b>acid</b> moiety, whose intramolecular distance between the boronic acid moieties is well defined, are shown to detect D-glucose with high selectivity, demonstrating a higher affinity than other saccharides probed, namely D-galactose, D-fructose and D-mannose...|$|E
40|$|Among {{the many}} types of organic films, covalently-attached {{organosulfur}} monolayers have attracted {{a great deal of}} attention. The authors have focused their interest on the fundamental characterization of spontaneously adsorbed organosulfur monolayers. An introductory chapter presents general aspects of monolayer preparation and characterization, followed by a few examples that illustrate the range of applications of these films. This thesis contains two papers. In the first paper, three analogous monolayer precursors are studied to determine their similarities and differences in the monolayer structure. A GC-MS analysis of products form the chemisorption process and open circuit potential measurements are used to derive possible mechanisms behind monolayer formation. The second paper focuses on monolayers formed from <b>thioctic</b> <b>acid,</b> including its characterization and application to cytochrome c electrochemistry. Although thiols and disulfides have been extensively studied as monolayer precursors, <b>thioctic</b> <b>acid</b> is particularly interesting because the disulfide functionality of this asymmetric molecule is contained in a strained five-membered ring. Given the ring strain, steric bulk and asymmetry of the molecule, the study of these monolayers lend insight into the factors important for the formation of organosulfur monolayers. This thesis concludes with a general summary and directions for future studies. 40 refs...|$|E

Peripheral neuropathies are heterogeneous disorders presenting often with hyperalgesia and allodynia. This study has assessed if chronic constriction injury (CCI) of sciatic nerve is accompanied by increased oxidative stress and central nervous system (CNS) changes and if these changes are sensitive to treatment with <b>thioctic</b> <b>acid.</b> <b>Thioctic</b> <b>acid</b> is a naturally occurring antioxidant existing in two optical isomers (+) - and (−) -thioctic acid and in the racemic form. It has been proposed for treating disorders associated with increased oxidative stress. Sciatic nerve CCI was made in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) and in normotensive reference cohorts. Rats were untreated or treated intraperitoneally for 14 days with (+/−) -, (+) -, or (−) -thioctic acid. Oxidative stress, astrogliosis, myelin sheets status, and neuronal injury in motor and sensory cerebrocortical areas were assessed. Increase of oxidative stressmarkers, astrogliosis, and neuronal damage accompanied by a decreased expression of neurofilament were observe...|$|E
40|$|Metabolism {{of oxygen}} by cells can {{generate}} potentially dangerous {{reactive oxygen species}} (ROS). Endothelial cells lining vascular luminal surface are an important site of signalling molecules and a ROS target during ischemia, inflammation and other pathological conditions. Targeted delivery of ROS modulating enzymes conjugated with antibodies to endothelial surface molecules provide site-specific interventions of endothelial ROS. Excessive ROS cause pathological activation of endothelium including exposure to cell adhesion molecules. Intercellular adhesion molecule- 1 (ICAM- 1) {{is a member of}} the Ig superfamily and is also found on the surface of several other cell types, including endothelial cells. These molecules [e. g., ICAM- 1, vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM- 1) and platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecule- 1 (PECAM- 1) ] exposed on activated endothelium represent attractive targets for delivery of drugs and imaging probes to pathological sites in the vasculature. This study has investigated the effect of different stereoisomers of the antioxidant <b>thioctic</b> <b>acid</b> on the endothelium of rat kidney vasculature. Twenty-week-old spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and normotensive Wistar Kyoto rats were treated for 2 weeks with a daily dose of 12. 5 nM/kg racemic (+/-) -, (+) - or (-) -thioctic acid. Kidney vascular microanatomy was Investigated by ICAM- 1, VCAM- 1 and PECAM- 1 immunochemistry and immunohistochemistry.. Treatment with <b>thioctic</b> <b>acid</b> significantly improved renal vascular endothelium status by preventing the ICAM and VCAM adhesion. (+) -Thioctic acid elicited the most sustained effect, (+/-) -thioctic acid was less effective and (-) -thioctic acid worsened activity of the compound. The above data suggest that (+) -thioctic acid, the naturally-occurring enantiomer of the compound, is probably the only form of it able to interfere with endothelial adhesion mechanisms in renal vasculature. The comparatively lower activity of racemic (+/-) - <b>thioctic</b> <b>acid</b> is likely determined by the negative impact of (-) -thioctic acid on the parameters under investigation. Analysis of vascular intercellular adhesion mechanisms could represent an interesting approach for investigating specific vascular disorders and also other pathologies in which vascular involvement plays an important role...|$|E
40|$|Arterial {{hypertension}} {{is accompanied}} by significant cardiovascular and renal changes {{as well as by}} increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) Spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) are a widely used animal model in hypertension research. They are normotensive at birth and develop hypertension gradually. From the 6 th month hypertension becomes stable and {{is accompanied by}} the development of cardiovascular, renal and brain injury as well as ROS production increase. This study has evaluated in 20 -week-old SHR and normotensive Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats the effect of treatment for 2 weeks with a daily dose of 12. 5 nM/Kg racemic (+/-) -, (+) - or (-) -thioctic acid on heart and kidney oxidative stress and microanatomy. Loose ligation of the right sciatic nerve (Chronic constriction injury, CCI) was made to increase oxidative stress condition. Systolic blood pressure was unaffected by treatment with <b>thioctic</b> <b>acid.</b> In the heart hypertension and CCI were accompanied by left ventricular hypertrophy, increased size of cardiocytes and signs of fibrosis. In the kidney hypertension and CCI increased oxidative damage with obvious signs of glomerular and tubular changes. (+) -Thioctic acid {{and to a lesser extent}} (+/-) -thioctic acid countered in part these changes which were unaffected or worsened by (-) -thioctic acid. These data indicate that the naturally occurring enantiomer (+) - <b>thioctic</b> <b>acid</b> has a protective effect on hypertension/oxidative stress-related cardiac or renal microanatomical changes. (-) -Thioctic acid which is not present in nature and derives from chemical processes of synthesis of the compound has probably a negative activity on parameters investigated. Its presence in the racemic <b>thioctic</b> <b>acid</b> is probably the reason of the lower pharmacological activity noticeable with this form of the compound. Appropriate antioxidant strategy could be helpful in combination with antihypertensive drugs in the treatment of hypertensive organ damage. The more pronounced effect of (+) -thioctic acid may have consequences worthwhile of being investigated in clinical studies...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of glucose and various vitamin to the excreted dosis of pyro-racemic acid in urine was observed on 40 cases (male 19, female 21) of lung tuberculosis. And {{the results were}} as follows. 1. The dosis of vitamin B(1) and B(2) in urine for one day had relation to the severity of disease and the excreted dosis of visamin B(1) and B(2) into urine decreased with severe case. 2. The decrease of the excreted dosis of pyro-racemic acid in urine was observed on the 30 cases of 40 cases with the intravenous injection of 20 % glucose 0. 1 cc per kg and it was observed on the 20 cases of 40 cases with the administration of 20 % glucose 0. 2 cc per kg. In other words, glucose activated the disposal function of Pyro-racemic acid in some degree. And at that time, the considerable correlation between the severity of disease and the above function was observed, but it had no relation with cavity, excretion of bacillus, erythrocyte sedimentation rate liver function or subjective symptoms. 3. Giving vitamin B(1) 5 mg at 1 hour before the administration of 20 % glucose 0. 2 cc per kg, the decrease of pyroracemic acid was observed on the 6 cases of 20 cases which did not show the decrease or pyro-racemic acid, and it was shown in the 4 more cases {{on the use of}} cocarboxylase 5 mg instead of vitamin B(1). Furthermore, it was seen in the 4 cases of 10 cases, which did not show the decrease of pyro-racemic acid on the use of cocarboxylase, on the mixed use of cocarboxylase and vitamin B(2) 5 mg and it was seen in the 6 cases of them on the use of cocarboxylase and glucose after the adminstration of pantotenic acid calcium 200 mg for 3 day. The above cases included the 4 cases showing the decrease on the mixed use of vitamin B 2. And it was seen in the 6 cases of them on the administration of <b>thioctic</b> <b>acid</b> 10 mg at 1 hour the administration of glucose, and the 3 cases of them were same to the cases showing the decrease on the mixed use of cocarboxylase and pantotenic acid and other 3 cases was the cases which did not show the decrease on the mixed use of the above drugs. And the decrease of pyro-racemic acid was seen in all of 10 cases on the mixed use of <b>thioctic</b> <b>acid</b> 10 mg and glucose. 4. The disposition of pyroracemic acid became smooth by the addition of cocarboxylase, pantotenic acid and <b>thioctic</b> <b>acid</b> etc. with the combination of phosphorus in vitamin B 1 in lung tubercuosis. In other words, the latent deficiency of vitamin and enzyme, especially the deficiency of <b>thioctic</b> <b>acid,</b> was noticed...|$|E
