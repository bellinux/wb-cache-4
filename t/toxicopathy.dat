40|$|Objectives : Through the {{literature}} on the effect of Aconiti Cliare Tuber, Radix Aconiti, we are finding out the clinical posibility and revealing the more effective to intractable disease. Methods : We inverstigated {{the literature}}s of Oriental Medicine and experimental reports about Aconiti Cliare Tuber, Radix Aconiti. Results : 1. The taste of Aconiti Cliare Tuber, Radix Aconiti is hot, sweet, bitter, warm and hot, and the effect is dehumidification, warm up and relieve the pain, so it can be used for arthritis, hemiplegia, carpopedal spasm, sciatica, cancer, numbness. 2. A toxic constituent of Aconiti Cliare Tuber, Radix Aconitiis is induced by aconitine alkaloid, develope toxic symptoms and result in death. So it needs suitabe treatment for safety. 3. It is known that the <b>toxicopathy</b> due to Radix Aconiti was 3 - 30 g(dosage for adult) and Aconiti Ciliare Tuber was 1 - 9 g. But only using aconitine alkaloid to oral feeding, the <b>toxicopathy</b> due to 0. 2 mg/kg and lethal dose is 3 - 4 mg. So we using this for treating, we must be careful and need more varialble study about <b>toxicopathy,</b> lethal dose. 4. On clinical treatment, we thought Aconiti Cliare Tuber, Radix Aconiti is so effective to intractable disease after control the toxicity, it may be need variable study on toxicity and clinical effects...|$|E
40|$|Spectrum {{of metal}} {{nanoparticle}} use {{in recent years}} has increased rapidly. Despite such positive impacts of copper as antibacterial, antifungal, analgesic, improving the blood flow effects, cannot be overlooked that copper is a heavy metal which in living organisms is necessary in small quantities, but large quantities can cause <b>toxicopathy</b> and pollute the environment. That {{must be taken into account}} in product design, manufacture, use and removal. Numerous studies on metal nanoparticles impact on human and environment has shown that metal nanoparticles destroy benign bacteria species used in wastewater treatment systems for ammonia elimination [1], if penetrated into mammalian cells, they can even cause damage to the genotype [2]. This research presents copper nanoparticle coating stability during modified textile use and care, and analysis of different textile materials’ effect on the parameters of gas discharge visualization electrogramms. The overall objective of the study is to establish an alternative, less resource consuming method for measurement of textile metal coating resistance...|$|E
40|$|Management of {{technological}} changes is responsible {{not only for}} introduction of new technologies offering optional product values, but in every development step evaluation of possible hazards is the equal important. Product sustainability is closely linked to environmental hazards of every new technology - development or use of different metal covered or metal ions releasing product may have detrimental effects on people or the environment. In this area have been various studies, the results shows that metal nanoparticles can cause <b>toxicopathy,</b> destroy the beneficial bacterial species, give {{negative impact on the}} development of animals and absorbed into the human body, affect the DNA structure.  To evaluate level of metal ions presence in water after metal covered textiles washing, the indirect method based on gas discharge visualization and corresponding testing methodology are developed in this research. Data used in article obtained from experiments with cooper particles covered fabric obtained in thermal evaporation process. Experiments were carried out with gas discharge visualization (GDV) camera, using specialized software package and mathematic statistics methods to develop testing methodology which minimize main parameter variations and allow separating dependent variables responding to the metal ions amount in liquid. The overall aim of the work is to find out appropriate method of metal nanoparticle concentration detection and most sustainable method for the copper coatings deposition on textile, which does not pollute the environment, does not harm any living forms and increase product added value. Presented research is directed toward working out fast instruments for technological change management in the field of products and processes introduction/usage where metal ions are released or metal-coated textiles developed. The research is original with the applied gas discharge visualization principles...|$|E
