5|$|A defrocked Romanian Orthodox priest with an {{unconventional}} lifestyle, Creangă made an early impact as an innovative educator and textbook author, while pursuing a short career in nationalist politics with <b>the</b> <b>Free</b> <b>and</b> Independent Faction. His literary debut came late in life, closely following {{the start of}} his close friendship with Romania's national poet Mihai Eminescu and their common affiliation with the influential conservative literary society Junimea. Although viewed with reserve by many of his colleagues there, and primarily appreciated for his records of oral tradition, Creangă helped propagate the group's cultural guidelines in an accessible form. Later criticism has often described him, alongside Eminescu, Ion Luca Caragiale and Ioan Slavici, {{as one of the most}} accomplished representatives of Junimist literature.|$|E

40|$|ObjectiveTo {{explore the}} effects of extract of Hibiscus rosasinensis (H. rosasinensis) on <b>the</b> volume, <b>free</b> <b>and</b> total acidity of gastric {{secretion}} induced by carbachol. MethodsAnimals were kept on fasting for 48 h, then the pylorus of each animal was ligated. They were randomly divided into 5 groups and treated by carbachol at 600 μg/kg. Then animals in group II – V were treated by H. rosasinensis extract at 250 and 500 mg/kg body weight, cimetidine at 2. 5 mg/kg and verapamil at 10 mg/kg body weight intraperitoneally, respectively. <b>The</b> volume, <b>free</b> <b>and</b> total acidity of gastric secretion were observed and compared. ResultsIt {{was found that the}} extract significantly reduced <b>the</b> volume, <b>free</b> <b>and</b> total acidity of gastric secretion (P< 0. 01). These reductions were comparable to cimetidine and verapamil. And the reduction in <b>the</b> volume <b>and</b> <b>free</b> acidity were more significant in cimetidine and verapamil treated group indicating that cimetidine and verapamil were more effective. ConclusionsThe extract of H. rosasinensis can reduced <b>the</b> volume, <b>free</b> <b>and</b> total acidity of gastric secretion, and can be used effectively in the treatment of peptic ulcer...|$|R
