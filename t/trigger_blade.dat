5000|$|The Spartan 310 has {{a walnut}} stock and fore-end, {{automatic}} ejectors, and a ventilated barrel rib. It uses screw-in SPR choke tubes. By default, the bottom barrel fires first, but the shooter can select the top barrel to fire first by pushing the <b>trigger</b> <b>blade</b> forward when {{the gun is}} loaded and closed. [...] Opening the action automatically engages the manual safety, which {{is located on the}} tang behind the top lever.|$|E
50|$|The rifle has {{new design}} {{features}} as an adjustable Crossfire trigger, {{with an extra}} finger safety in the <b>trigger</b> <b>blade.</b> Adjustment of the trigger pull is possible within 2,5 to 5 Lbs. The black synthetic stock is made from plastic with a high nylon content making it very rigid. To reduce the recoil a gel filled pad has been added. For maximum accuracy the barrel is free floated from the stock and the stock is pillar bedded. The small ejection port also makes the receiver very rigid.|$|E

5000|$|Shadow Falls has a {{character}} roster of twelve fighters - ten immediately playable characters (the two [...] "Double Dragons" [...] and eight Shadow Warriors) and two end bosses. Many {{of the characters}} are taken from the Double Dragon animated series that aired during the game's release. Only Bones, Sekka, Blade, and Dominique are original characters, with Blade's design being based on the generic Shadow Warrior soldiers {{who were on the}} show. Dominique and the Shadow Master are playable in the Super NES and Mega Drive/Genesis versions via a code. In the Jaguar version, <b>Blade,</b> <b>Trigger</b> Happy, and Icepick were removed, and Dominique was added to the immediate roster.|$|R
5000|$|In the [...] "unharmed victim" [...] case, {{the system}} {{typically}} contains two blades, one positioned above {{the victim and}} another hidden in the woodwork below it. When the upper blade is released it falls and hits the stops, which <b>triggers</b> the lower <b>blade</b> to be released and continue through the device. Mechanical linkages are often used in order to impart the upper blade's motion onto the lower to make the timing and motion appear more realistic. These versions almost always include additional holes, typically one below the victim, into which a prop is inserted and cut by the lower blade, {{improving the quality of}} the illusion that the blade has passed right through the victim's neck.|$|R
5000|$|Most punch down {{tools are}} of the impact type, {{consisting}} of a handle, an internal spring mechanism, and a removable slotted blade. To use the punch down tool, a wire is pre-positioned into a slotted post on a punch block, and then the punch down tool is pressed {{down on top of}} the wire, over the post. Once the required pressure is reached, an internal spring is <b>triggered,</b> and the <b>blade</b> pushes the wire into the slot, simultaneously cutting the insulation and securing the wire. [...] The tool blade does not cut through the wire insulation to make contact, but rather the sharp edges of the slot in the contact post itself slice through the insulation.|$|R
5000|$|The Gryphon is {{essentially}} the same in-line blowback internals as the 98 custom, in a low cost speedball-esque style body. It has an internal gas line, fixed center-feed neck, a top cocking knob, and a 2 finger <b>blade</b> <b>trigger.</b> Sharing the same threads as the A5 and X7 Phenom, any A5/X7 barrel can be used. It was designed to give entry level players on a budget an easy to maintain, effective and reliable marker for the lowest price possible. Its price is comparable to many of the [...] "no-name" [...] guns found in department stores, however the common parts and proven design make it far more reliable and repairable, allowing for years of use. The primary drawback of the marker is its limited upgrade options, although some internal upgrades MAY be interchangeable with the 98c/ US army lineups.|$|R
5000|$|Indian Creek Designs {{also made}} a variant of this marker known as the Lasoya Promaster. The Lasoya version has {{slightly}} different milling which is more simplistic and comes in a dust finish two tone fade colour. The aggressive [...] "tail" [...] has been removed, perhaps to decrease {{the weight of the}} marker. The high pressure regulator is different from the standard ProMaster. It is a clone of the well-known Air America Vigilante regulator. Instead of the standard ProMaster <b>blade</b> <b>trigger,</b> a new trigger with two finger groves has been added. The bolt is also different as it is made of teflon, instead of delrin and has a small [...] "ramp" [...] on the top to reduce ball breakage. It also comes with a low pressure regulator gauge so the user can see exactly what the LPR is set at. Another change from the regular ProMaster is the feed neck. While it is still not a clamping feed neck, it has a lower profile, resulting in less hopper hits. The board in the Lasoya Promaster was made by Kila products for ICD and is a less adjustable version of their ProMaster Drive board. Hence it has been nicknamed the [...] "Kila Lite" [...] board. It features more firing modes than the original ProMaster board and an adjustable [...] "debounce" [...] setting.|$|R

The distances from the blade decided, where chosen after analyzing the flow field, {{in order to measure}} the fully developed flow without taking in account the entrained flow, as discussed in the second chapter. 4. 3 Angle resolved PIV measurements for a PBT impeller in up-pumping and down-pumping configurations <b>Triggering</b> the <b>blade</b> passage reduces the noise due to the macro velocity fluctuation, as blade passage, which can be identified in the time average measurement, from any energy spectrum analysis, or a frequency analysis (Yianneskis et al., 1987). Angle resolved flow field The flow near the impeller analyzed function of the angle of the blade, in other words, function of time, gives an actual continuous flow. 0 °) 15 °) 30 °) 45 °) Figure 4. 10 : Up pumping flow field at different angles The flow around the impeller has a periodicity of 1 / 6 of the impeller revolution, as observed above. As shown from the flow field in figure 4. 10. 0 °) 15 °) 30 °) 45 °) Figure 4. 11 : Down pumping flow field at different angles In the discharge region near the impeller, is found the maximum normalized velocity, clearly its value, varies with the blade position. The flow induced by the impeller in the main loop, maintains constant characteristics varying the blade angle. 4. 3. 2 Turbulent kinetic energy The angle resolved study of the turbulent kinetic energy, is shown in the following figures. Figure 4. 12 : Down pumping turbulent kinetic energy For what concerns the up-pumping configuration, the different flow profile, determines significantly different values of the kt*. As observed in Figure 4. 13. 0 °) 15 °) 30 °) 45 °) Figure 4. 13 : Up pumping turbulent kinetic energy From the set of images in Figure 4. 13, the periodicity of the turbulent kinetic energy fluctuation is highlighted. Comparing the results from the two configurations, described by the Figure 4. 12 and Figure 4. 13, is clear that in the up pumping configuration, significantly higher values are observed. 4. 3. 3 Energy dissipations rates evaluated through dimensional analysis Figure 4. 14 : Energy dissipation evaluated with the dimensional analysis. Down pumping configuration The results proposed by this method of the energy dissipation are obtained from the results of the calculation of the turbulent kinetic energy. Lower values are observed in the down pumping configuration, coherently with the values of kt* previously measured. 0 °) 15 °) 30 °) 45 °) Figure 4. 15 : Energy dissipation evaluated with the dimensional analysis. Up pumping configuration The results obtained with the dimensional analysis do not give any substantially new information to the analysis of the two flow configurations. For these reasons has been adopted another method for the energy dissipation estimation; estimating the turbulent energy dissipation rate, from its fundamental definition, as explained in the second chapter. According to previous works (P. Saarenrinne et al., 2000), has been calculated the energy dissipation rate spectrum, and its distribution function Figure 2. 10, need a spatial resolution of to resolve 90 % of the dissipation rate, and with a resolution of only 65 % of the total energy dissipation rate is achievable. In Figure 4. 16, are illustrated the results obtained for the two flow configurations. Figure 4. 16 : Turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rate calculated from the definition. Exact measurements of the turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rates, should be done to the Kolmogorov length scale. The rates of dissipation of the turbulent kinetic energy are higher in up-pumping configuration, also with this method of evaluation. Values of the turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rate obtained from the direct calculation in this paragraph are in accord with the results obtained from previous works (Sheng J. el. al., 2000). 4. 3. 5 Large eddy PIV method By overlapping and comparing the results of the flow field (Figure 4. 10 and Figure 4. 1 1), with the energy dissipation contour plots in Figure 4. 17, it evidences that the area where the main energy dissipations occur is not exactly on the discharge of the impeller, but in the area, where is present the highest shear stress. While the second area with the sensibly higher energy dissipation rate, is found in the up pumping configuration where the upper recirculation loop, comes down towards the impeller. Figure 4. 17 : Turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rate evaluated with Sub-Grid-Scale model. -Energy evaluation comparison Is evident that the energy dissipation levels for both up and down configurations, obtained with the Sub-Grid-Scale Smagorinsky model, are the closer to the value of energy input evaluated previously. Table 4. 2 : Energy comparison results The information obtained from the angle resolved vorticity plots give {{a better understanding of the}} flow in the vessel. In Figure 4. 19 is clear how the high energy dissipations zones move away from the blade for every angle. 0 °) 15 °) 30 °) 45 °) Figure 4. 19 : Vorticity function of the blade angle in the down pumping configuration Figure 4. 20 : Vorticity function of the blade angle in the down pumping configuration For instance in the 30 ° angle can be observed that above the impeller the outward moving flow, rotating clockwise, pushes away the further fluid, creating an entrained flow with counter clockwise rotation. This can explain the presence above and under the impeller, respectively for the two flow configurations, of two separated different areas of high energy dissipation rate. 4. 3. 4 Flow number as a function of the blade angle The minimum flow number is obtained for either configurations between 15 ° and 18 °. Figure 4. 21 : Flow number at different blade angles The flow number was also investigated. The first observable difference when studying the flow for the two configurations, obtained by a 6 -PBT, is the structure of the flow field. In the down pumping configuration, the flow off the blade tip is pumped down, towards the bottom of the vessel, and flows back to the top of the tank, creating one main counterclockwise loop, and a small clockwise loop beneath the impeller. The turbulent kinetic energy was measured in the vessel for every operating condition. The dissipation of the turbulent energy, which has seen, occurs at lower length scales. The low spatial resolution of the system made impossible to measure satisfactorily the energy dissipation rates. The same periodicity was found either for the turbulent kinetic energy and the energy dissipation rates. The flow number also has been evaluated function of the blade angle and compared between the configurations. To achieve a change in flow configuration, was used a second impeller, with out changing the rotational direction of the impeller, thus for the two flow configurations, the flow number versus the blade angle, followed the same profile...|$|R
