5|$|Doors and vents {{often had}} sills of {{carefully}} ground flat stone slabs and lintels constructed from {{a row of}} thin wood beams. Chacoan masons also frequently included intramural beams – horizontal logs completely enclosed in the wall core – which were probably intended to reduce horizontal deformation of the wall. The interior walls of great houses were typically covered in a rock veneer. Judd identified four distinct types, and his <b>typology</b> is the most commonly accepted in the region. Chetro Ketl's interior walls, particularly those in the eastern wing, were covered in a Type IV veneer characterized by uniform pieces of sandstone with little to no exposed mortar. Judd excluded a fifth type of masonry, called McElmo style, from his <b>typology.</b>|$|E

This bias has important consequences when WALS <b>typologies</b> are interpreted theoretically or further processed statisticall...|$|R
40|$|Research on player <b>typologies</b> {{has been}} focused on games mainly {{targeted}} for mature audience. Player <b>typologies</b> are needed for game design and marketing purposes. In order to discover children's player <b>typologies,</b> two playtest sessions were organized. In the playtests, children from 4 to 6 year olds playing a children's safety game were observed. The data gathered was analyzed and results compared to previous research. Five children's player <b>typologies</b> were discovered, with two of those concluded to be unique player <b>typologies</b> of the game. Gleeful players enjoy seeing the negative reaction resulting of incorrect play. Rulers add their own rules to the play. In conclusion, the thesis analyzes and discovers children's player <b>typologies</b> while uncovering playability and usability problems of the game...|$|R

The theoretical roots of the three <b>typologies</b> are delineated with special attention to classical person approach. Finally, we discuss the theoretical and heuristic value of <b>typologies,</b> critically evaluating empirical proofs sustaining the temporal stability and the replicability across different samples and cultures of the three <b>typologies.</b> The role of typological approaches within the contemporary debate on the objectives of personality psychology is discussed...|$|R
5|$|This view of {{language}} {{is associated with}} the study {{of language}} in pragmatic, cognitive, and interactive frameworks, as well as in sociolinguistics and linguistic anthropology. Functionalist theories tend to study grammar as dynamic phenomena, as structures that are always in the process of changing as they are employed by their speakers. This view places importance on the study of linguistic <b>typology,</b> or the classification of languages according to structural features, as it can be shown that processes of grammaticalization tend to follow trajectories that are partly dependent on <b>typology.</b> In the philosophy of language, the view of pragmatics as being central to language and meaning is often associated with Wittgenstein's later works and with ordinary language philosophers such as J. L. Austin, Paul Grice, John Searle, and W. O. Quine.|$|E
5|$|Wagiman is a prefixing language, which, in {{the context}} of <b>typology</b> of Australian languages, may refer to its genealogical {{classification}} as well as its syntactic properties. Wagiman, along with other Gunwinyguan languages, inflects verbs for person and number of the subject obligatorily, and optionally for the object. In this respect Wagiman displays characteristics of a head-marking language. However, Wagiman also behaves as a dependent-marking language, in that nominals are case marked as to their grammatical or semantic roles, such as ergative (the subject of a transitive clause) or absolutive (the object of a transitive clause or the subject of an intransitive clause).|$|E
5|$|Criminologists analyse the nature, causes, {{and control}} of {{criminal}} activity, drawing upon methods across sociology, psychology, and the behavioural sciences. The sociology of deviance focuses on actions or behaviours that violate norms, including both formally enacted rules (e.g., crime) and informal violations of cultural norms. It is the remit of sociologists to study why these norms exist; how they change over time; {{and how they are}} enforced. The concept of social disorganization is when the broader social systems leads to violations of norms. For instance, Robert K. Merton produced a <b>typology</b> of deviance, which includes both individual and system level causal explanations of deviance.|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY Poverty in {{the suburbs}} is growing, but there is great {{diversity}} in the rates of growth of poverty as well as causes and consequences of the growth across different kinds of suburbs. Suburban <b>typologies,</b> systems to group different types of suburbs, are {{a useful tool for}} understanding the variation among suburbs and highlighting potential strategies for addressing poverty. This paper discusses why <b>typologies</b> of suburban communities are important, what factors have been considered in the development and use of <b>typologies,</b> what <b>typologies</b> have been developed to date, and lastly, how <b>typologies</b> can be used to inform strategies for addressing suburban poverty. Suburban <b>typologies</b> can assist in understanding the variation between suburbs in the overall level, duration, and causes of poverty as well as variation in resources, services, and opportunities availabl...|$|R

As a result, the <b>typologies</b> are often poorly differentiated. It thus seems necessary to diversify the classification criteria further so as to improve our understanding of incubators.|$|R
5|$|The {{excavation}} of Mummy Cave yielded a nearly continuous succession of artifacts, which span {{a period of}} over 9000years. The artifacts were disposed {{in a manner that}} permitted dating in both relative terms through stratigraphy, as well as through radiocarbon dating to establish an absolute scale. This continuum has proved to be invaluable in relating and dating other excavations in the Rocky Mountain region. In particular, the stone projectile points found at Mummy Cave have been used to set the standard for classifying stone arrowheads and spear heads in the region. The point <b>typology</b> has been extrapolated to define cultural and commercial relationships between peoples throughout the American West. Stratigraphy and carbon dating indicate that Mummy Cave was first occupied {{near the end of the}} Pinedale glaciation. Later occupancy spanned the Altithermal, followed by a cooler climate from about 1000BC.|$|E

The advantage of using <b>typologies</b> is the easy integration of new methods {{and the availability of}} a broader scope of tools.|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The {{primary purpose}} of the study was to examine Generation Y {{consumer}} shopper <b>typologies.</b> The secondary purpose was to establish the influence of age in the identified shopper <b>typologies.</b> Rational: Marketers have ever been concerned with the behaviour of consumers. Generation Y consumers have emerged as an important marketing segment. Consequently, a need exists to investigate behavioural issues pertaining to this age cohort on a continuous basis. Methodology: A survey questionnaire was administered to a convenient sample of 230 Generation Y consumers of fashion apparel. Exploratory factor analysis was used to identify shopper <b>typologies.</b> The Kruskal-Wallis test was used to examine the influence of age on the identified shopper <b>typologies.</b> Findings: The study identified seven shopper <b>typologies</b> that are applicable to the Generation Y cohort. These are quality conscious, brand conscious, novelty seeking, hedonistic, confused by over-choice, habitual, brand loyal and fashion conscious shopper <b>typologies.</b> The study also revealed that younger consumers were found to be more confused by over-choice than their older counterparts. Value of research: These findings may enable marketers to understand and predict the purchase behaviour of Generation Y consumers, thereby facilitating the development and implementation of more effective marketing strategies. </p...|$|R
