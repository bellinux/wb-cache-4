5000|$|While {{critically}} neglected for {{the better}} part of the 20th century, interest in Willa Cather was aroused in the 1980s with the rise of the feminist movement. Although many of her novels have been subsequently incorporated into the canon, critics have largely ignored <b>The</b> <b>Professor’s</b> House, passing it over on account of it being “morally and psychologically unachieved”. As a reason for this disparagement, critics often cite the “broken” format of the book, rebuking its structure as unnecessary. Or, they cite the ambivalent depiction of <b>the</b> <b>Professor’s</b> psyche. <b>The</b> reader is unsure of how to consider <b>the</b> <b>Professor’s</b> demands for solitude and his entrapment in the past. He’s a family man and a university man, but <b>the</b> <b>Professor’s</b> conflict reaches its crux when he surrenders [...] "local community for the nostalgic national ideal". A.S. Byatt calls <b>The</b> <b>Professor's</b> House Cather's [...] "masterpiece... almost perfectly constructed, peculiarly moving, and completely original".|$|R

5|$|Meanwhile, Wombosi {{continues}} to obsess over the attempt on his life. Conklin, having anticipated this, planted {{a body in}} the Paris morgue to appear as the assailant, but Wombosi is not fooled and threatens to report this and other CIA secrets to the media. <b>The</b> <b>Professor</b> assassinates Wombosi on Conklin's orders. Bourne, posing as Kane, learns about Wombosi's yacht, and that the assailant had been shot twice in the back during the escape; he realizes {{that he was the}} assailant. He and Marie take refuge at the French countryside home of her old friend Eamon (Tim Dutton) and his children. Under pressure from Abbott to tie off the Wombosi matter entirely, Conklin tracks Bourne's location and sends <b>the</b> <b>Professor</b> there, but Bourne shoots him twice with Eamon's shotgun, mortally wounding him. <b>The</b> <b>Professor</b> reveals their shared connection to Treadstone before dying. Bourne sends Marie, Eamon, and Eamon's children away for their protection, and then contacts Conklin via the Professor's phone to arrange a meeting. From a rooftop near the arranged location in Paris, Bourne sees Conklin has brought backup, so he abandons the meeting, but uses the opportunity to place a tracking device on Conklin's car, leading Bourne to Treadstone's safe house.|$|E

50|$|The desperation {{reached the}} point {{of not being able}} to {{compensate}} <b>the</b> <b>professors.</b> <b>The</b> policy was, in short: if the college had <b>the</b> money, <b>the</b> <b>professors</b> would be paid. To make up for this deficiency, in the late 1890s five professors' cottages were constructed. The sole extant cottage is one of the most visible features of the campus today.|$|R

5|$|In 1932, Bethe {{accepted}} an appointment {{as an assistant}} professor at the University of Tübingen, where Hans Geiger was <b>the</b> <b>professor</b> of experimental physics. One of the first laws passed by the new National Socialist government was the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service. Due to his Jewish background, Bethe was dismissed from his job at the University, which was a government post. Geiger refused to help, but Sommerfeld immediately gave Bethe back his fellowship at Munich. Sommerfeld spent much of the summer term of 1933 finding places for Jewish students and colleagues.|$|E
5|$|In Nigel Kneale's 1996 radio serial The Quatermass Memoirs, it is {{revealed}} that <b>the</b> <b>Professor</b> was first involved in rocketry {{experiments in the}} 1930s, and that his wife died young. The unmade prequel serial Quatermass in the Third Reich, an idea conceived by Kneale in the late 1990s, would have shown Quatermass travelling to Nazi Germany during the 1936 Berlin Olympics and becoming involved with Wernher von Braun and the German rocket programme, before helping a young Jewish refugee {{to escape from the}} country. According to The Quatermass Memoirs, during World War II Quatermass conducted top secret work for the British war effort, which he subsequently refused ever to discuss.|$|E

5|$|In the Rogue Cut version, Rogue's role is more consequential, and the {{narrative}} is more complex: When seeing Stryker causes Wolverine's consciousness to phase {{between past and}} future—resulting in his claws being extended, injuring Kitty Pryde—the Professor talks {{about the need for}} Wolverine to have more time back in 1973. Bobby Drake (Iceman) proposes breaking into the heavily guarded remains of Cerebro at the Professor's school, the one place where the Professor's mind can't reach others from the outside, in order to rescue Rogue, who is being held captive there. With <b>the</b> <b>Professor</b> and Magneto, he does so—at the cost of his own life—and Rogue is taken to where the mutants are making their last stand, where she takes over for Kitty in regards to keeping Wolverine's mind in 1973, for the remaining time until the moment history is changed, with a suggestion that Wolverine is aware of the switch as he appears to feel Rogue's presence. The Sentinels were able to find the X-Men through a tracking device inside a Sentinel's hand, which got stuck in the X-Jet after the Sentinel tried to prevent <b>the</b> <b>Professor,</b> Magneto and Rogue from escaping the incinerated remains of the X-Mansion. It also includes a scene where Mystique visits the X-Mansion at night while Charles and Logan are sleeping. She revisits her previous romance with Beast but leaves very early the next morning and breaks Cerebro in order to prevent Charles from finding her.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1914, van Meegeren moved his family to Scheveningen. That year, he {{completed}} the diploma examination at the Royal Academy of Art in The Hague. The diploma allowed him to teach, {{and he took a}} position as the assistant to Professor Gips, <b>the</b> <b>Professor</b> of Drawing and Art History, for the small monthly salary of 75 guldens. In March 1915, his daughter Pauline was born, later called Inez. To supplement his income, Han sketched posters and painted pictures for the commercial art trade, generally Christmas cards, still-life, landscapes, and portraits. Many of these paintings are quite valuable today.|$|E
5|$|Like {{all other}} Pokémon RPGs, Diamond and Pearl {{begin in the}} protagonist's hometown. After viewing a {{television}} report about a media-conducted search for a Red Gyarados, which was spotted at a faraway lake (Johto's Lake of Rage), the protagonist {{and his or her}} best friend travel together to check the local lake for a Pokémon like it. They spot Professor Rowan, a Pokémon evolution researcher, and his assistant, the playable character not selected in the game: Lucas (boy) or Dawn (girl). After a short discussion, <b>the</b> <b>professor</b> and his assistant leave the lake, leaving a briefcase behind. When they are attacked by wild Starly, the protagonist and his or her rival examine the case. The player is then given a choice among the three Pokémon found in the briefcase (Turtwig, Chimchar, or Piplup) with which to battle the Starly. After defeating the Starly, Lucas or Dawn retrieves and returns the briefcase to <b>the</b> <b>professor.</b> Noticing that a bond has been forged between the young protagonist and his or her chosen Pokémon, Rowan offers it to him or her, asking that he or she embark on a journey and fill his or her Pokédex.|$|E
