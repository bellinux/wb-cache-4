We show that {{variations in the}} computation times of tasks may hazard the safeness of the controlled process. For the sake of reliability we take conditional instructions of tasks ’ code explicitly into account, {{in order to reduce}} the potential failures. We fisrt adapt the task’s temporal model to this context, then we model applications using autonomous Petri nets which run under the earliest firing rule with <b>terminal</b> <b>marking</b> set. We define two concepts of schedulability: the local schedulability and the global one and we define the concept of scheduling graph. Finally, we show how to obtain a scheduling graph from the graph of global schedulability...|$|E

40|$|Deamidation, {{the loss}} of the {{ammonium}} group of asparagine and glutamine to form aspartic and glutamic acid, {{is one of the most}} commonly occurring post-translational modifications in proteins. Since deamidation rates are encoded in the protein structure, it has been proposed that they can serve as molecular clocks for the timing of biological processes such as protein turnover, development and aging. Despite the importance of this process, there is a lack of detailed structural information explaining the effects of deamidation on the structure of proteins. Here, we studied the effects of deamidation on human triosephosphate isomerase (HsTIM), an enzyme for which deamidation of N 15 and N 71 has been long recognized as the signal for <b>terminal</b> <b>marking</b> of the protein. Deamidation was mimicked by site directed mutagenesis; thus, three mutants of HsTIM (N 15 D, N 71 D and N 15 D/N 71 D) were characterized. The results show that the N 71 D mutant resembles, structurally and functionally, the wild type enzyme. In contrast, the N 15 D mutant displays all the detrimental effects related to deamidation. The N 15 D/N 71 D mutant shows only minor additional effects when compared with the N 15 D mutation, supporting that deamidation of N 71 induces negligible effects. The crystal structures show that, in contrast to the N 71 D mutant, where minimal alterations are observed, the N 15 D mutation forms new interactions that perturb the structure of loop 1 and loop 3, both critical components of the catalytic site and the interface of HsTIM. Based on a phylogenetic analysis of TIM sequences, we propose the conservation of this mechanism for mammalian TIMs...|$|E

40|$|Brain-derived {{neurotrophic}} factor (BDNF) is widely reported to enhance synaptic vesicle (SV) exocytosis and neurotransmitter release. But {{it is still}} unclear whether BDNF enhances SV recycling at excitatory terminals only, or at both excitatory and inhibitory terminals. In the present study, in a direct comparison using cultured rat hippocampal neurons, we demonstrate that BDNF enhances both spontaneous and activity-dependent neurotransmitter release from excitatory terminals, but not from inhibitory terminals. BDNF treatment for 5 minutes or 48 hours increased both spontaneous and activity-induced anti-synaptotagmin 1 antibody uptake at excitatory <b>terminals</b> <b>marked</b> with vGluT 1. Conversely, BDNF treatment did not enhance spontaneous or activity-induced uptake of anti-synaptotagmin 1 antibodies in inhibitory <b>terminals</b> <b>marked</b> with vGAT. Time-lapse imaging of FM 1 - 43 dye destaining in excitatory and inhibitory terminals visualized by post-hoc immunostaining of vGluT 1 and vGAT also showed the same result: The rate of spontaneous and activity-induced destaining was increased by BDNF at excitatory synapses, but not at inhibitory synapses. These data demonstrate that BDNF enhances SV exocytosis in excitatory but not inhibitory terminals. Moreover, BDNF enhanced evoked SV exocytosis, even if vesicles were loaded under spontaneous vesicle recycling conditions. Thus, BDNF enhances both spontaneous and activity-dependent neurotransmitter release on both short and long time-scales, by the same mechanism...|$|R

5000|$|Like power, voltage {{and current}} are signed quantities. The current flow in a wire has two {{possible}} directions, so when defining a current variable i the direction which represents positive current flow must be indicated, usually by an arrow on the circuit diagram.

2500|$|An {{electric}} battery is a device consisting {{of one or}} more electrochemical cells with external connections provided to power electrical devices [...] such as flashlights, smartphones, and electric cars. When a battery is supplying electric power, its positive terminal is the cathode and its negative terminal is the anode. The <b>terminal</b> <b>marked</b> negative is the source of electrons that when connected to an external circuit will flow and deliver energy to an external device. When a battery is connected to an external circuit, electrolytes are able to move as ions within, allowing the chemical reactions to be completed at the separate terminals and so deliver energy to the external circuit. It is the movement of those ions within the battery which allows current to flow out of the battery to perform work. Historically the term [...] "battery" [...] specifically referred to a device composed of multiple cells, however the usage has evolved additionally to include devices composed of a single cell.|$|R

40|$|This review will {{commence}} {{with research}} into language development in native speakers by Hunt (1965); Bateman and Zidonis (1966); O'Donnell, Griffin, and Norris (1967); and Hunt (1970). Reviews of language development studies which precede Kellogg Hunt's research in 1965 {{may be found}} in Me Carthy (1954), Carroll (1960), and Erwin and Miller (1963). Hunt (1965) Hunt's research pioneered in the identification of a language unit called a 'minimal-terminal unit' or a ‘t-unit'. He explains the meaning of this term as follows: ‘terminal' because it is grammatically allowable to terminate them, like sentences, with a capital letter at one end and a period or other <b>terminal</b> <b>mark</b> at the other; and 'minimal' {{in the sense that they}} are the shortest units into which a passage can thus be segmented without leaving fragments as a residue. (pp. 8 - 9) Thus, a t-unit, as defined by Hunt, is a sentence with only one main clause plus any subordinate clauses or non-clausal elements accompanying it, This unit replaces the highly unreliable sentence length as the traditional measure of language development [...] - often younger students write longer sentences than older students by virtue of simple joining devices as coordination between main clauses (Hunt, p. 11) ...|$|R
