He had five {{possible}} uses: as basic feed for himself, food to build strength, food for his chickens for dietary variation, an ingredient for making whisky and feed for his parrots to amuse him. Then the farmer lost one sack of grain. Instead of reducing every activity by a fifth, the farmer simply starved the parrots as they were of less utility than the other four uses; in other words {{they were on the}} margin. And it is on the margin, and not with a view to the big picture, <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>make</b> economic decisions.|$|E

[...] He added that the studio is able to work on so many series across different networks and platforms because [...] "it just requires <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>make</b> sure that there's always someone from Marvel there to help guide the process." ...|$|E

William Hague emerged from the discussions to say, [...] "The issues that we have covered have included political reform, economic issues and reduction of the deficit, banking reform, civil liberties, environmental issues. So, we've had good discussions about all of those areas. We are agreed that {{a central part of}} any agreement <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>make</b> will be economic stability and the reduction of the budget deficit, but each negotiating team is now going to report to our party leaders." ...|$|E
500|$|During this period, Warner {{showed little}} {{foresight}} in {{his treatment of}} the studio's cartoon operation. [...] Animated characters such as Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, and Porky Pig, while embraced by cartoon lovers, [...] "were always stepchildren at Warner Bros." [...] As biographer Bob Thomas wrote, [...] "Jack Warner...considered cartoons {{no more than an}} extraneous service provided to exhibitors who wanted a full program for their customers." [...] In 1953, during a rare meeting between the Warners and the studio's cartoon makers, Jack confessed that he didn't [...] "even know where the hell the cartoon studio is", and Harry added, [...] "The only thing I know is <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>make</b> Mickey Mouse," [...] a reference to the flagship character of a competing company, Walt Disney Productions. Several years later, Jack sold all of the 400 cartoons Warner Bros. made before 1948 for $3,000 apiece. [...] As Thomas noted, [...] "They have since earned millions, but not for Warner Bros." ...|$|E

Hubble Space Telescope photos of the Helix Nebula and Eagle Nebula are also featured in the inside cover and liner notes for this album, respectively. The photos were used {{with the permission of}} NASA. Regarding the artwork, Ament said, [...] "The reason that we went with Tchad [...] is because he provides an amazing atmosphere to songs....So, I think we wanted the artwork to represent that....One of the themes that we've been exploring...is just realizing that in the big scheme of things, even the music <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>make</b> when we come together, no matter how powerful it is, it's still pretty minuscule. I think for me the whole space theme {{has a lot to do}} with scale. You know, you look at some of those pictures, and there are thirteen light years in four inches in that picture." ...|$|E

500|$|The second season's mythology was {{intended}} to be revealed in small parcels. Throughout the season, Pinkner and Wyman tried to create an episode that best bridged [...] "standalone" [...] traits—needed for casual viewers—with the further advancement of the show's mythology for those who watched regularly. At {{the start of the season}} Pinkner believed they had found a [...] "good rhythm" [...] between the two, as the mythology [...] "really [...] affect the characters, to the point where even the standalone [...] advance mythology". After the season ended, Wyman commented at San Diego Comic-Con International, [...] "We learned that the fan fans love mythology but there are needs from the networks. We started experimenting with a thing we called 'mythalones', not standalone or myth." [...] Wyman cited the season's 18th episode, [...] "White Tulip" [...] as a prime example, noting [...] "You can see that you're following Walter's journey, it's the right mix." [...] The Fringe producers strove to avoid becoming bogged down in mythology, an issue that they perceived happened in Alias, another J.J. Abrams television series. In a joint statement released midway through the season, Abrams, Pinkner, and Wyman noted that their [...] "only internal rule is <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>make</b> every effort to not raise mythological questions merely to string viewers along, but rather to provide answers that generate consequences." ...|$|E

2500|$|Germany, {{which is}} {{involved}} in the UN-mandated International Security Assistance force in Afghanistan and also heads an international effort improving Afghanistan's police force, has suggested that Afghanistan could potentially lose aid or technical support for reconstruction efforts depending on the outcome of Abdul Rahman's case.

[...] Schäuble also said, [...] "We contribute a lot to rebuilding Afghanistan and towards its stability, so I truly believe that Afghanistan must realize that we insist upon the freedom of religion.

2500|$|Critics of Searle's {{response}} {{argue that}} the program has allowed the man to have two minds in one head. If we assume a [...] "mind" [...] {{is a form of}} information processing, then the theory of computation can account for two computations occurring at once, namely (1) the computation for universal programmability (which is the function instantiated by the person and note-taking materials independently from any particular program contents) and (2) the computation of the Turing machine that is described by the program (which is instantiated by everything including the specific program). The theory of computation thus formally explains the open possibility that the second computation in the Chinese Room could entail a human-equivalent semantic understanding of the Chinese inputs. The focus belongs on the program's Turing machine rather than on the person's. However, from Searle's perspective, this argument is circular. The question at issue is whether consciousness is a form of information processing, and this reply requires <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>make</b> that assumption.|$|E
2500|$|Martin {{characteristically}} deviates {{from the}} traditional fantasy model and clear-cut lines of good versus evil. Martin reflects: [...] "I think the battle {{between good and evil}} is fought largely within the individual human heart, by the decisions <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>make.</b> It's not like evil dresses up in black clothing and you know, they're really ugly". This viewpoint characterizes the book and is evident in the actions of several different families which frequently have conflicts with each other. The Starks' and Lannisters' conflict is a central component of the novel, and the reader receives points of view from both sides. Likewise, Daenerys' storyline develops around the Targaryen's upheaval in Westeros, in which the Starks played a significant role. Martin argues: Having multiple viewpoints is crucial to the grayness of the characters. You {{have to be able to}} see the struggle from both sides, because real human beings in a war have all these processes of self-justification, telling ourselves why what we're doing is the right thing.|$|E

On July 21, 2010, Zuckerberg reported that the company reached the 500 million-user mark. When asked whether Facebook could earn more income from advertising {{as a result of}} its phenomenal growth, he explained: I guess we could... If you look at how much of our page is taken up with ads compared to the average search query. The average for us is a little less than 10 percent of the pages and the average for search is about 20 percent taken up with ads... That's the simplest thing we could do.
