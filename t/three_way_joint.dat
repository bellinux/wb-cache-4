50|$|The <b>Three</b> <b>Way</b> Independent School District {{was formed}} in May 1945 by the {{consolidation}} of Goodland Consolidated Independent School District No. 7, Watson Independent School District No. 10, and Wilson Independent County Line School District No. 14. <b>Three</b> <b>Way</b> School was built on a 20 acre parcel of land north of Maple. Over the years, several smaller districts - including Stegall (1946) and Bula (1975) - consolidated with <b>Three</b> <b>Way.</b> By the 1994-1995 school year, the district enrolled 127 students. That figure had fallen to 83 by 2001. Faced with declining enrollment and lower funding from the state, <b>Three</b> <b>Way</b> administrators decided that the district would have to consolidate with another larger school district {{by the start of}} the next school year. Three neighboring districts - Morton, Muleshoe, and Sudan - were considered for consolidation. A questionnaire was sent to <b>Three</b> <b>Way</b> ISD parents and registered voters to see which of the candidate districts was most favored. Sudan ISD was selected by approximately 57 percent of <b>Three</b> <b>Way</b> voters and 59 percent of <b>Three</b> <b>Way</b> parents. Both school boards approved the decision and the issue was put to a vote on February 2, 2002. In the election, Sudan ISD voters supported consolidation by a 190-1 margin. Of the 80 votes cast by <b>Three</b> <b>Way</b> ISD residents, 54 supported the measure with 26 opposed. The merger of <b>Three</b> <b>Way</b> ISD with Sudan became official on July 1, 2002.|$|R
