5|$|In July 2010, Minnesota Majority, a {{conservative}} watchdog group, {{conducted a study}} in which they flagged 2,803 voters for examination, including some 1,359 they suspected were ineligible convicted felons in the largely Democratic Minneapolisâ€“St. Paul area who voted illegally in <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>race.</b> Subsequent investigations of Minnesota Majority's claims by election officials found that many of their allegations were incorrect.|$|E

5000|$|North Dakota's house race {{occurred}} concurrently {{with both}} an ordinary <b>senate</b> <b>race</b> {{and a special}} election to <b>the</b> <b>senate</b> to replace appointee Jocelyn Burdick. The incumbent in <b>the</b> first <b>senate</b> <b>race,</b> Kent Conrad, ran in the special election and won; he switched seats in <b>the</b> <b>senate</b> on December 15. Democratic representative Byron Dorgan, therefore, who had won <b>the</b> first <b>senate</b> <b>race,</b> resigned from <b>the</b> house on December 15 to fill <b>the</b> newly vacated <b>senate</b> seat; as such, North Dakota's house seat remained vacant for 19 days, until Earl Pomeroy was sworn in on January 3.|$|R

25|$|With the {{retirement}} of Republican Barry Goldwater from the U.S. Senate in 1986, many in Arizona expected Babbitt to oppose Representative John McCain for the seat. In a surprise press conference in 1985, Babbitt instead announced he would forgo <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>race</b> to concentrate on a White House bid in 1988.|$|E
25|$|By {{the spring}} of 2015 there was media {{speculation}} Crist would seek the Democratic nomination for Florida's 2016 senate race. This would have marked his third {{run for the senate}} seat (he lost in 1998 and 2010). However, in March 2015 Crist stated he would not seek the nomination. That same month he endorsed U.S. Congressman Patrick Murphy's candidacy for <b>the</b> <b>senate</b> <b>race.</b>|$|E

25|$|Reese polled 109,698 votes (20.2 percent) in {{the general}} election; Ellender, 432,228 (79.8 percent). Reese polled {{less than half the}} vote that Nixon {{received}} in Louisiana, whereas Ellender outpolled Kennedy by nearly 25,000. A large 266,000 who voted in the presidential contest skipped <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>race</b> altogether. Ellender held the seat from 1936 until his death in office in 1972.|$|E
25|$|Only 11 {{percent of}} Tennesseans knew who Corker {{was when he}} began running for <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>race.</b> All three have run statewide campaigns in the past, albeit {{unsuccessful}} ones: Bryant for the 2002 Republican Senate nomination, losing to Lamar Alexander; Corker for the U.S. Senate in 1994, losing to Frist in the Republican primary; and Hilleary for Tennessee Governor in 2002, losing to Democrat Phil Bredesen.|$|E
25|$|When McCarthy {{became a}} {{dominant}} voice of anti-Communism starting in 1950, Kennedy contributed {{thousands of dollars}} to McCarthy, and became one of his major supporters. In <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>race</b> of 1952, Kennedy apparently worked a deal so that McCarthy, a Republican, would not make campaign speeches for the GOP ticket in Massachusetts. In return, Congressman John F. Kennedy, running for the Senate seat, would not give any anti-McCarthy speeches that his liberal supporters wanted to hear.|$|E

25|$|After losing <b>the</b> <b>senate</b> <b>race,</b> Geary {{remained}} {{active in}} public affairs. In 1957, {{he was appointed}} to the Oregon Republican Party's policy and action committee. At that time, other members of the committee included Mark Hatfield, Charles A. Sprague, and Wendell Wyatt. In 1960, he was elected president of Oregon Tax Research, a private organization that studied tax policy and advocated for tax reform. He continued represented the Oregon Tax Research group for a number of years.|$|E
25|$|Then {{followed}} four tumultuous weeks, {{in which}} Giuliani's medical life, romantic life, marital life, {{and political life}} all collided at once in a most visible fashion. Giuliani discovered that he had prostate cancer and needed treatment; his extramarital relationship with Judith Nathan became public {{and the subject of}} a media frenzy; he announced a separation from his wife Donna Hanover; and, after much indecision, on May 19, 2000 he announced his withdrawal from <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>race.</b>|$|E
25|$|Pataki and New York GOP Chairman Sandy Treadwell faced {{controversy}} after naming moderate Assemblyman Howard Mills the party's {{nominee for}} the U.S. Senate against Senator Chuck Schumer over conservative Michael Benjamin, who held significant advantages in both fund raising and organization. Benjamin publicly accused Treadwell and Pataki {{of trying to}} muscle him out of <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>race</b> and undermine the democratic process. Mills went on to lose the election in the largest landslide for a Senate seat {{in the history of}} New York.|$|E

25|$|In an {{interview}} with Politico, Gilmore {{said that he had}} been approached to run for the Senate seat of John Warner, who announced his retirement for his senate term ending in 2009. By the end of the summer, many media outlets, most notably the Washington Post, {{thought it would be a}} foregone conclusion that Gilmore would jump into <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>race.</b> Gilmore's successor as governor, Mark Warner, had already announced in September, and 11th District Congressman Tom Davis had informally announced his candidacy a few days after Mark Warner's announcement.|$|E
25|$|Following {{his loss}} in <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>race,</b> Bauman {{began working with}} the poor and {{homeless}} in Portland, organizing vigils and protests {{to draw attention to}} their plight. In 1987, he staged a solid-food fast to urge the Oregon Legislature to increase funding for social services, ending it when Oregon Governor Neil Goldschmidt proposed funding increases. Bauman became vice chairman of the Burnside Community Council, a service center for homeless adults in Portland, but later resigned in protest after the council voted to keep secret a report detailing allegations of sexual misconduct against the founder of the council; Bauman opposed the decision.|$|E
25|$|Benjamin {{publicly}} accused New York GOP Chairman Sandy Treadwell and Governor George Pataki {{of trying}} to muscle him out of <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>race</b> and undermine the democratic process. Many Republican voters were upset when Benjamin was denied the chance {{to engage in a}} primary. He had campaigned throughout New York, visiting all 62 counties on several occasions, and had built strong support among political leaders and community groups. In addition, Benjamin received the majority of his financial support in small donations, with only $2,500 from Political Action Committees (PACs). Mills had raised $200,000 less than Benjamin, and a large portion of his campaign contributions came from PACs.|$|E
5000|$|During <b>the</b> 2006 <b>Senate</b> <b>race,</b> Casey also {{expressed}} support for the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2006, saying this: [...] "if I were in <b>the</b> United States <b>Senate</b> I would vote yes." ...|$|R

50|$|In September 2011, he {{announced}} he would run for <b>the</b> U.S. <b>Senate</b> seat vacated by retiring Democrat U.S. Senator Herb Kohl. On January 29, 2012 {{he announced}} his withdrawal from <b>the</b> U.S. <b>Senate</b> <b>race.</b>|$|R
25|$|On November 13, Senator Jim DeMint of South Carolina {{announced}} he would move to have Stevens expelled from the Senate Republican Conference (caucus) regardless {{of the results of}} the election. (Absentee, provisional, and early ballots were, at the time, still being tallied in the close election.) Losing his caucus membership would cost Stevens his committee assignments. However, DeMint later decided to postpone offering his motion, saying that while there were enough votes to throw Stevens out, it would be a moot point if Stevens lost his reelection bid. Stevens ended up losing <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>race,</b> and on November 20, 2008, gave his last speech to the Senate, which was met with a rare Senate standing ovation.|$|E
25|$|After one term, he ran as the Democratic {{candidate}} to succeed Republican incumbent and House Minority Whip Trent Lott {{in what was}} then the 5th District when Lott made a successful run for the Senate. He lost to Harrison County sheriff Larkin I. Smith by almost 10 points. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee offered very little help to Taylor, believing the district to be too heavily Republican. Vice President George H. W. Bush beat Michael Dukakis by approximately a 70 to 30 margin in the district, and Lott beat Wayne Dowdy by a similar margin in <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>race.</b> Although about 30,000 Bush and Lott voters split their tickets to vote for Taylor, he could not overcome the Republican tide in the district.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, Schumer won {{re-election}} against Republican Assemblyman Howard Mills of Middletown {{and conservative}} Marilyn F. O'Grady. Many New York Republicans were {{dismayed by the}} selection of Mills over the conservative Michael Benjamin, who held significant advantages over Mills in both fundraising and organization. Benjamin publicly accused GOP chairman Sandy Treadwell and governor George Pataki of trying to muscle him out of <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>race</b> and undermine the democratic process. Schumer defeated Mills, the second-place finisher, by 2.8 million votes and won reelection with 71% of the vote. Schumer won every county in the state except one, Hamilton County in the Adirondacks, the least populated and most Republican county in the state. Mills conceded defeat minutes after the polls closed, before returns had come in.|$|E
