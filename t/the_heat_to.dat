5|$|Against the Chicago Bulls in {{the first}} round of the 2006 NBA Playoffs, Wade shook off a few {{injuries}} that scared Heat fans, including a severely bruised hip in Game 5. Returning late in the half, Wade resurrected his team by scoring 15 of his 28 points while suffering from intense pain, leading <b>the</b> <b>Heat</b> <b>to</b> the much-needed 3–2 series lead. After this, Wade successfully led his team to the 2006 NBA Finals, despite suffering from flu-like symptoms in game 6 of the Eastern Conference Finals against the Detroit Pistons. He put up a double-double with 14 points and 10 assists in that game, including an 8-point flurry to close out the third quarter that put the game out of reach.|$|E
5|$|On December 9, 2011, he re-signed with <b>the</b> <b>Heat</b> <b>to</b> a three-year, $4.5 million contract. In the 2011–12 season, an {{impressive}} playoff {{run by the}} Heat culminated in his first NBA championship, and the franchise's second as they defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder in the 2012 NBA Finals, 4 games to 1. Jones played in 51 games, starting 10, for the Heat during the season while averaging 3.6 points, 1.0 rebounds and 13.1 minutes per game. He was a DNP-CD 15 times. He finished third place in the 2012 Three-Point Shootout in Orlando.|$|E
5|$|On June 29, 2015, Wade {{opted out}} of his {{contract}} with <b>the</b> <b>Heat</b> <b>to</b> become a free agent. On July 10, 2015, he re-signed with the Heat once again to a one-year, $20 million contract. Wade hit just seven shots from beyond the arc during the entire 2015–16 regular season. However, the 2016 postseason saw a change in Wade's play. He converted on his first seven three-point shot attempts before missing his first one during a Game 3 loss to the Toronto Raptors in the conference semi-finals. According to Elias Sports Bureau, Wade had never made more than five three-pointers in a row during his career.|$|E
50|$|The first Ashes {{series was}} held in at the Brisbane Entertainment Centre, in 1995. The Australian Challengers were Kerry Warman, Nellie Baker, David Wallis and Andrew Halliday. The female challengers lost in <b>the</b> <b>heats</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> British challengers; Kerryn Sampey and Eunice Huthart, while both male challengers won in <b>the</b> <b>heats</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> British challengers; Phil Campbell and Matt Beeke. Thus, the Ashes {{competition}} ended in a tie, since two British female challengers and two Australian male challengers were in the final.

5|$|From birth, leopard sharks form large schools {{generally}} segregated {{by age and}} sex, {{which may}} intermingle with grey or brown smoothhounds (Mustelus californicus and M. henlei) or spiny dogfish (Squalus acanthias). These schools are apparently nomadic, often appearing suddenly in an area {{for a few hours}} and then vanishing just as quickly. In captivity, larger sharks have been observed establishing their dominance over smaller individuals via light nips to the pectoral fins. During summer days, large aggregations of mature females assemble in shallow bays and estuaries, dispersing at night. As these females follow the warmest patches of water, allowing them to raise their internal body temperatures by up to 3°C (5.4°F), they are speculated to be taking advantage of <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> <b>to</b> speed their growth and that of their gestating young. The membership of these aggregations is inconstant, with individual females periodically switching between different sites scattered over several kilometers.|$|E
5|$|In {{just his}} second game {{back from the}} All-Star Game on February 17, Wade {{strained}} his calf in the first quarter. He left the game with 8 points in 8 minutes of play, ending his personal and also Heat's franchise record streak of 148 consecutive games with at least 10 points. On April 2, Wade was named Eastern Conference Player of the Month and Player of the Week twice for his play {{in the month of}} March, leading <b>the</b> <b>Heat</b> <b>to</b> a 12–3, the team's best record since March 2006. It was his first Player of the Month award of the season and 5th of his career. He averaged 26.9 and 7.5 assists per game, which both ranked third in the Eastern Conference, and 2.3 steals per game, which ranked first. Wade recorded six 30 points games and had six double-doubles in the month, including a season-high 14 assists in an overtime win against the Los Angeles Lakers on March 4.|$|E
5|$|On February 26, 2012, at the All-Star Game Wade {{recorded}} {{what was}} only the third triple-double {{in the history of}} the contest, posting 24 points, 10 rebounds, and 10 assists, joining Michael Jordan and LeBron James as the only players ever to record the prestigious stat (at the 1997 and 2011 games respectively). On March 10, 2012, Wade made the game-winning shot against the Indiana Pacers, giving the Heat a 93–91 overtime win. Wade finished the season averaging 22.1 points, 4.8 assists, 4.6 rebounds, and 1.7 steals per game. In the playoffs, the Heat defeated the New York Knicks in 5 games in the first round, then defeated the Indiana Pacers in 6 games in the second round. Wade heated up in Game 6 of the second round, recording 41 points and 10 rebounds. The Celtics took <b>the</b> <b>Heat</b> <b>to</b> seven games in the Eastern Conference Finals, but the Heat prevailed and advanced to the NBA Finals. They lost to the Oklahoma City Thunder in Game 1 of the finals but won the next four games, and Wade secured his second NBA title. Wade averaged 22.6 points per game in the series. The Heat became the first team in NBA history to win a championship after trailing in three different playoff series.|$|E

40|$|Heat {{transport}} during short-circuit-Gas Metal Arc Welding is {{investigated by}} means of a calorimetric method. The influence of some important welding parameters on <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> flow <b>to</b> <b>the</b> welding plate is determined. The signal of current and voltage during the calorimetric experiments is used <b>to</b> calculate <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> transport <b>to</b> <b>the</b> welding plate. This calculation is done {{with the help of a}} computer program which analyses the measured signals of current and voltage.

5|$|On January 5, 2012, Bosh led <b>the</b> <b>Heat</b> <b>to</b> a 116–109 triple {{overtime}} {{win against}} the Atlanta Hawks, highlighted by a three-point shot {{he made to}} force the game into overtime with 0.06 seconds left {{to play in the}} fourth quarter. Bosh finished the game with 33 points, 14 rebounds, 5 assists, 2 steals, and 2 blocked shots. By season's end, the Heat had embraced a small ball strategy that featured Bosh at the center position. In the playoffs, Bosh started at center and averaged 14.0 points and 7.8 rebounds a game. In Game 1 of the Conference Semifinals against the Indiana Pacers, he suffered a lower abdominal strain that forced him to miss the rest of the series and the first four games of the Eastern Conference Finals against Boston. Boston pushed Miami to seven games, and in the final game, Bosh scored 19 points, including 3 of 4 shooting from three point range, to help the Heat advance to their second straight NBA Finals, this time against the Oklahoma City Thunder. The Thunder won {{the first game of the}} series before Miami rolled to a 4-1 victory, giving Bosh his first NBA Championship. Bosh scored 24 points in the deciding Game 5 and averaged 14.6 points and 9.4 rebounds in the Finals.|$|E
5|$|On March 3 of the 2013–14 season, James {{scored a}} career-high and franchise-record 61 {{points in a}} game against the Charlotte Bobcats. Throughout the year, {{he was one of the}} few staples for a Heat roster that used 20 {{different}} starting lineups due to injuries, finishing with averages of 27.1 points, 6.9 rebounds, and 6.4 assists per game on 56.7 percent shooting. In the second round of the playoffs, he tied a career postseason-high by scoring 49 points in Game 4 against the Brooklyn Nets. In the next round, Miami defeated the Pacers to earn their fourth consecutive Finals berth, becoming one of only four teams in NBA history to do so. In Game 1 of the Finals, James missed most of the fourth quarter because of leg cramps, helping the Spurs take an early series lead. In Game 2, he led <b>the</b> <b>Heat</b> <b>to</b> a series-tying victory with 35 points on a 64 percent shooting rate. San Antonio eventually eliminated the Heat in five games, ending Miami's quest for a three-peat. For the Finals, James averaged 28.2 points, 7.8 rebounds, and 2.0 steals per game.|$|E
5|$|To {{supply the}} {{electrical}} power necessary for arc welding processes, {{a variety of}} different power supplies can be used. The most common welding power supplies are constant current power supplies and constant voltage power supplies. In arc welding, the length of the arc {{is directly related to the}} voltage, and the amount of heat input is related to the current. Constant current power supplies are most often used for manual welding processes such as gas tungsten arc welding and shielded metal arc welding, because they maintain a relatively constant current even as the voltage varies. This is important because in manual welding, it can be difficult to hold the electrode perfectly steady, and as a result, the arc length and thus voltage tend to fluctuate. Constant voltage power supplies hold the voltage constant and vary the current, and as a result, are most often used for automated welding processes such as gas metal arc welding, flux cored arc welding, and submerged arc welding. In these processes, arc length is kept constant, since any fluctuation in the distance between the wire and the base material is quickly rectified by a large change in current. For example, if the wire and the base material get too close, the current will rapidly increase, which in turn causes <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> <b>to</b> increase and the tip of the wire to melt, returning it to its original separation distance.|$|E

5000|$|Balancing loop - A {{balancing}} loop {{is a type}} of a feedback loop, where {{a positive}} increase of variable A causes a decrease in variable B, which in turn causes a positive increase in variable A. The behavior of such a system leads to the system finding stable state over time. Consider the behavior of a thermometer. The thermometer is a very simple device in its core. If the measured temperature exceeds a certain preconfigured value, <b>the</b> <b>heating</b> is turned off. Otherwise <b>the</b> <b>heating</b> is turned on. <b>The</b> <b>heating</b> in turn influences the temperature, forcing the thermometer to reevaluate its behavior periodically. Since there is a delay in the system (it takes a while for <b>the</b> room <b>to</b> <b>heat</b> up after <b>the</b> <b>heating</b> has been turned on), the temperature in the room will oscillate around the preconfigured value. This happens because when <b>the</b> <b>heating</b> is turned on, it doesn’t have an immediate effect (<b>the</b> body emitting <b>heat</b> must warm up first), causing the temperature to fall below desired level. The same effect is in play when the temperature exceeds the desired value and <b>the</b> <b>heating</b> is turned off, since it takes a while for <b>the</b> <b>heating</b> body <b>to</b> cool down, causing further undesired temperature increases. This behavior could be potentially mitigated by setting two separate temperature thresholds, a lower one as a signal for <b>the</b> <b>heating</b> <b>to</b> activate and a higher one as a signal for <b>the</b> <b>heating</b> <b>to</b> deactivate.|$|R
5|$|Bosh {{remained}} the Heat's starting center during the 2012–13 season. On February 15, 2013, Bosh was picked as an All-Star starter over the injured Rajon Rondo by coach Erik Spoelstra. The Heat achieved the league's best record and {{swept through the}} first round of the playoffs against the Milwaukee Bucks before defeating the Chicago Bulls in five games, with Bosh scoring 20 points to go with 19 rebounds in a crucial Game 3 win in Chicago. Bosh averaged 12.1 points per game throughout the playoffs, as the Heat advanced to the NBA Finals to face the San Antonio Spurs following a grueling seven-game series against Indiana. The Heat and Spurs split the first two games before the Spurs blew out Miami in Game 3 to take a 2–1 series lead. In Game 4, Bosh scored 20 points and grabbed 13 rebounds to complement Wade's 32 points and James' 33 points to bolster the Heat's win, tying the series. San Antonio would bounce back in Game 5 to force <b>the</b> <b>Heat</b> <b>to</b> win the final two games at home. In the final seconds of Game 6, James missed a three-pointer, and Bosh grabbed the offensive rebound and found a wide open Ray Allen in the corner. Allen hit the shot to tie the game, and in overtime the Heat had a three-point lead with seconds left. San Antonio inbounded the ball to Danny Green, who attempted a corner three, but Green's shot was blocked by Bosh to secure the Heat's victory. Bosh was held scoreless in Game 7 by Tim Duncan, but the Heat still won the game and the series to claim their second consecutive NBA Championship.|$|E

40|$|This {{study is}} devoted <b>to</b> {{improving}} <b>the</b> <b>heating</b> <b>to</b> oil shale particles {{and in turn}} the yield and quality of shale oil in fixed bed reactors indirectly heated through use of internals. Metallic heating plates were vertically welded on the reactor wall as <b>heating</b> enhancement internals <b>to</b> provide extra <b>heating</b> surfaces inside <b>the</b> oil shale bed and <b>to</b> increase <b>the</b> high-temperature <b>heating</b> surface area by 35 % to 210 %. Comparison of <b>heating</b> rate <b>to</b> particles and shale oil yield was made between the reactors without and with the plate internals. Utilizing internals evidently enhanced <b>the</b> <b>heating</b> <b>to</b> oil shale particles and shortened pyrolysis time by 30 % to 50 %. The shale oil yield increased by 7 % to reach 90 % of the Fischer Assay oil yield (8. 98 wt. %, dry base) when <b>the</b> <b>heating</b> surface area was increased by 70 - 110 %. With increased heating surface area above 110 %, the shale oil yield manifested conversely a slight decrease. Nonetheless, the fraction of light oil (boiling point < 350 degrees C by analysis in simulation GC) was increased to about 66 wt. % from 60. 94 wt. % for the reactor without any <b>heating</b> plate. Characterizing <b>the</b> char samples at different lateral positions of the oil shale bed justified that the flow of gaseous pyrolysis product in the reactor was guided <b>to</b> <b>the</b> vicinity of <b>heat</b> transfer plates <b>to</b> speed up gas exhaust and selective cracking. Consequently, adding heat transfer plates into an indirectly heated reactor would obviously intensify <b>the</b> <b>heating</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> oil shale bed and also elevate the pyrolysis oil yield and quality.
