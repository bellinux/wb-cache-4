A cataract when first setting in sometimes results in much improved eyesight for a short time. One who happens to have been practicing the Bates method will likely credit it for any improvement experienced regardless of the actual cause.|$|E
5|$|There {{are still}} intense areas of shadow which throw the Cumaean Sibyl into relief. But {{it is more}} than relief; it is the three-dimensionality which art-lovers expect to see {{in the work of the}} man who sculpted Moses. Critics of the {{restoration}} claim that this was Michelangelo's aim and that many frescoes had brightly contrasting colours laid side-by-side that were then worked over a secco to achieve this effect and <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> has been lost by a too-scrupulous cleaning.|$|E
5|$|Dexter captures Jaworski, {{who admits}} his guilt and {{explains}} {{that he has no}} remorse for his act. After killing Jaworski, Dexter drives to see Rita, but is sidetracked when he sees a refrigerated truck. Dexter follows the truck, and the driver throws a severed head at Dexter's car. When the police squad arrives, LaGuerta confirms that Doakes' case was indeed a crime of passion. Dexter arrives at Rita's apartment, where she expresses interest in taking their relationship to a more intimate level, under the impression <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> Dexter wants. Dexter feels uncomfortable and is saved when Rita's son, Cody, gets sick next door and needs his mother to pick him up. When Dexter arrives home, he finds a doll's head on his refrigerator door. Inside the freezer, he finds the other parts of the doll, severed just like the bloodless bodies of the dead women. Dexter views the doll as an invitation to play, which he accepts gladly.|$|E

50|$|He learnt to {{play the}} {{synthesizer}} from his father {{at the age of}} seven. Sandeep’s professional career as a musician started when he played at his first recording session at the age of 12.

50|$|He {{was born}} in North Leith in May 1809, the son of John Cousin (1781-1862) and his wife, Isabella Paterson (1773-1851). As North Leith was then {{practically}} one street it is reasonably safe to say <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> now Sandport Street (which was wholly redeveloped around 1880, thus destroying the original house). He was christened in North Leith Church {{at the south end}} of the road, on the section now called Quayside Street. His father was John Cousin (1781-1862) and his mother was Isabella Paterson.|$|R
5|$|Static Shock was an {{extremely}} popular show, granting its new renewal for a second season just a month after its debut. As of December 2000, it was the highest-rated pre-teen—from 2 to 11 years—show among all networks on its timeslot, and the third best on the Kids' WB! lineup. From its debut to July 2003, the show secured the second post among boys aged 6 to 11 years. Ratings increased after Richie's character obtained superhero powers; McDuffie affirmed <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> secured the renewal for a new season. Indeed, the show's third season was its most popular and was the second best-rated Saturday morning program among boys aged 6 to 11 years, and tweens and male tweens aged 9 to 14. From February to April 2003, ratings regularly performed over the 4.0 stake among the public aged 9 to 14 years; it even reached the 6.4 mark in May. Static Shocks last season was only surpassed by the children's anime Pokémon, and the show's reruns on Cartoon Network were only surpassed by the adult animated sitcom Family Guy. Static Shock was the only program on Cartoon Network {{to be among the}} top 30 most watched kids shows in a week of October 2004. It was also the best rated program of the channel among kids on a week of January 2005, and the best rated show on Cartoon Network's Miguzi block as of March 2005. For the 2004–05 season, it was the 18th most watched Saturday morning children's show of all networks. Static Shock was ultimately cancelled due to the low production of associated merchandising products.|$|E
25|$|Many {{explanations}} for the optimistic bias come from the goals that people want and outcomes they wish to see. People tend to view their risks as less than others because they believe <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> other people want to see. These explanations include self-enhancement, self-presentation, and perceived control.|$|E
25|$|For Aristotle the {{underlying}} principle {{of democracy is}} freedom, since only in a democracy the citizens can have a share in freedom. In essence, he argues <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> every democracy should make its aim. There are two main aspects of freedom: being ruled and ruling in turn, since everyone is equal according to number, not merit, {{and to be able}} to live as one pleases.|$|E
50|$|Despite the feud and {{the general}} dislike for Thompson felt by many in San Antonio, both he and Fisher were feared men. Their reputations as gunmen, and their having proven their skills in that trade in many {{documented}} events made anyone wishing to face them have second thoughts. It <b>is</b> likely <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> led to Thompson's enemies deciding on an ambush rather than an armed face to face confrontation.|$|R
50|$|Alan Warner (aka Allan Warner) (born 21 April 1947, Paddington, West London) is a musician.As a boy he {{originally}} {{wanted to}} play trumpet but {{ended up with a}} toy accordion.

2500|$|In February 2005, Jordan {{resigned}} from CNN. The resignation came {{in response to}} controversy sparked after bloggers wrote that, at the recent World Economic Forum, Jordan had seemed to accuse the U.S. military of having purposely killed journalists. While Jordan acknowledged his remarks were not sufficiently clear, he denied <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> he had meant to imply, {{saying that he had}} [...] "great admiration and respect for {{the men and women of}} the U.S. armed forces." ...|$|R
25|$|This definition, he says, will be {{admitted}} by all parties. Some deny that such laws exist, {{but they will}} grant <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> ought to be understood by them. There is thus common ground for the two opposing schools of moralists to join issue. The question between them is, Do such laws exist or do they not? In reasoning thus Cumberland obviously forgot what the position maintained by his principal antagonist really was.|$|E
25|$|Finally, he {{suggested}} that {{the meaning of the}} Privileges or Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment should be read the same way that Article IV's Privileges and Immunities Clause was interpreted. He cited Justice Bushrod Washington's interpretation of the latter clause in the famous case of Corfield v. Coryell and stated <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> the framers of the Fourteenth Amendment had intended. Thomas made a case for the revival of the clause to protect fundamental rights of citizens.|$|E

En is worried when a visiting Deathlok, who reveals to the students their likely futures, shows reluctance to do so with Evan. When Evan presses him, Deathlok informs him <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> Evan is at the school to discover. Deathlok then tells Wolverine that Evan has great potential and may be a great savior, or a conqueror.|$|E

However, some IAHA insiders claimed <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> really led to his ousting.

Despite his contract stipulating that IAHA was to pay all his personal legal expenses, {{on top of his}} $100,000 annual salary, the Association refused initially to pay the legal bills.

Giorgis, the Captain of the ship, did not like the idea of losing one of his crew but Joachim assured him <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> he had always wanted. Captain Giorgis finally agreed to speak to Joachim's father about the matter and left.|$|R
25|$|Most biographers {{concede that}} those accusations {{concerning}} Marlowe contained in various documents {{sent to the}} Privy Council {{at the time were}} very serious. It is therefore surprising that, despite the initial summons for his arrest being on 18 May, he was apparently still at liberty on 30 May to attend the Deptford meeting. Whatever the reason for this, it would have certainly given the opportunity for a faked death to be organized and carried out, if the Marlovians are right in claiming <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> happened.|$|E

In June 1773, Adams introduced a set of private letters to the Massachusetts House, written by Hutchinson several years earlier. In one letter, Hutchinson recommended to London {{that there should be}} [...] "an abridgement of what are called English liberties" [...] in Massachusetts. Hutchinson denied <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> he meant, but his career in Massachusetts was effectively over. The House sent a petition to the king asking for his recall.|$|E

The year 1942 was crucial in his life because, upon hearing the sound of the clarinet through Radio London, he realized <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> he wanted. And since then, fascinated by the beauty of jazz, he had regularly visited Concert Hall in Belgrade and listened to jazz concerts of then our masters (Elija Genić, Mladen Guteša, Vojin Popović and others), {{as well as of the}} foreign performers (Kari Burnett, German singer).|$|R
500|$|Tom Noonan, {{who played}} killer Francis Dollarhyde, {{initially}} researched other serial killers {{to study for}} the role, but was repulsed by it. He then decided to play the character with {{the sense that he}} felt he was doing right by his victims, not harming them. [...] "I wanted to feel this guy was doing the best he could", Noonan explained, [...] "that he was doing this out of love". Noonan credits his casting to improvisation during his audition, recalling that he was reading lines alongside a young woman. During a reading of the scene featuring the torture of Freddy Lounds, Noonan noticed that the woman began to seem frightened, and deliberately tried to scare her more. He believed <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> secured the role for him.|$|E

500|$|Actress and dancer Zoë Lister {{was cast}} {{in the role of}} Zoe. On 8 June 2009, media {{entertainment}} website Digital Spy revealed that Lister had quit the soap and would leave {{towards the end of the}} year.
