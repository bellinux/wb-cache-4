After graduating in 1971, she got a day job as a typist at the UCLA School of the Arts and Architecture.|$|E
5|$|According to the Constitution of 1831, the Belgian {{government}} {{was allowed to}} override {{the wishes of the}} King if he had been declared incompetent to reign. On 28 May 1940, under pressure from the French government, the Pierlot government in France declared the King to be under the power of the invaders and unfit to reign according to article 82, providing strong legal foundations and making itself the only official source of government. The government, however, refused to declare a republic. Although the King technically remained the only person able to receive diplomatic legations and conclude treaties, the government in exile was able <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>both</b> during the war independently.|$|E
5|$|Although the Potsdam Conference {{was mainly}} {{concerned}} with European affairs, {{the war against}} Japan was also discussed in detail. Truman learned of the successful Trinity test early in the conference and shared this information with the British delegation. The successful test caused the American delegation to reconsider the necessity and wisdom of Soviet participation, for which the U.S. had lobbied hard at the Tehran and Yalta Conferences. High on the United States' list of priorities was shortening the war and reducing American casualties—Soviet intervention seemed likely <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>both,</b> but {{at the cost of}} possibly allowing the Soviets to capture territory beyond that which had been promised to them at Tehran and Yalta, and causing a postwar division of Japan similar to that which had occurred in Germany.|$|E

50|$|The Ineffable Kings of Darkness Tour with Enthroned and Liar of Golgotha {{took place}} with Dominion joining the band as a session bass player. The band also made their second major festival {{appearance}} at the Swedish Hultsfreds festival. After the festival, Typhos was fired and Dominion, who originally was a guitarist, was taken on as the band's second guitarist, and Caligula reverted <b>to</b> <b>doing</b> <b>both</b> vocals and bass.|$|R
5|$|Foster {{looked for}} a {{director}} and Peter Bogdanovich came to his attention. Bogdanovich's agent, Jeff Berg, set up a special screening of his client's soon-to-be released The Last Picture Show (1971) for Foster with McQueen in attendance. They loved it and met with the director and a deal was made. However, Warner Bros. approached Bogdanovich with an offer to direct What's Up, Doc? (1972), starring Barbra Streisand, with the stipulation {{that he had to}} start right away. The director wanted <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>both,</b> and the studio refused. When McQueen found out, he became upset and told Bogdanovich {{that he was going to}} get someone else to direct The Getaway.|$|E
5|$|Soule {{was born}} in Keokuk, Iowa to a public school music teacher father and a graphic {{designer}} mother. He became interested in music and symphony orchestras {{at the age of}} five. Soule began taking piano lessons at an early age and became entranced with music, even writing music notation in the margins of his math homework; after his teachers and his father realized his talent, he began taking private lessons with professors from Western Illinois University when he was in sixth grade. He claims to have earned the equivalent of a master's degree in composition before completing high school, though, as he never enrolled in the school, he did not earn a degree. He was split between trying to become a concert pianist and a composer when he grew up; he ended up deciding to become a composer once he realized how difficult it would be <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>both.</b>|$|E
5|$|Shelly becomes possessed as well, forcing Scotty {{to chop up}} {{her body}} with an axe and bury the remains. Shaken by the experience, he leaves {{to find a way}} back to town. When Ash goes to check on Linda, he is horrified to find that she has already begun to turn. A badly-injured Scotty {{staggers}} into the cabin and dies of his wounds, having been attacked by the trees. While Ash tries to figure out what <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> <b>both</b> Linda and Cheryl pretend to be cured, only to quickly revert to their demonic forms. Ash locks Linda outside, but she returns and tries to stab him before he impales her with a dagger. He tries to cut up her remains with a chainsaw, but can't bring himself to do so, and ends up burying her instead. When he reaches for her necklace on the ground, she escapes again trying to kill him. Ash decapitates her with a shovel, and her headless body bleeds all over Ash's face as it tries to rape him before he escapes. Back in the cabin, he quickly realizes that Cheryl has forced open the trapdoor. After wounding her with a shotgun, he heads to the basement for more ammunition. There, the entity tortures him by dousing him with blood from a pipe, while more blood seeps from the walls and ceilings.|$|E

25|$|At {{the outset}} of World War II, there was {{controversy}} over whether Australia should concentrate on forming an expeditionary force for overseas service to fight Germany in Europe or a home defence force to fight Japan. Prime Minister Robert Menzies decided <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>both,</b> although {{the experience of the}} Great War indicated that Australia did not have the resources to do either.|$|E
25|$|Many of {{the largest}} banks, brokerages, and {{insurance}} companies desired the Act at the time. The justification was that individuals usually put more money into investments {{when the economy is}} doing well, but they put most of their money into savings accounts when the economy turns bad. With the new Act, they would be able <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>both</b> 'savings' and 'investment' at the same financial institution, which {{would be able to do}} well in both good and bad economic times.|$|E

25|$|Adams was a founder-director and Chief Fantasist of The Digital Village, {{a digital}} media and Internet company {{with which he}} created Starship Titanic, a Codie Award-winning and BAFTA-nominated {{adventure}} game, {{which was published in}} 1998 by Simon & Schuster. Terry Jones wrote the accompanying book, entitled Douglas Adams Starship Titanic, since Adams was too busy with the computer game <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>both.</b> In April 1999, Adams initiated the h2g2 collaborative writing project, an experimental attempt at making The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy a reality, and at harnessing the collective brainpower of the internet community. It was hosted by BBC Online from 2001 to 2011.|$|E
25|$|Stripes {{were one}} of the most popular {{vehicles}} for color used by several different Color Field painters in a variety of different formats. Barnett Newman, Morris Louis, Jack Bush, Gene Davis, Kenneth Noland and David Simpson, all made important Series' of stripe paintings. Although he didn't call them stripes but zips Barnett Newman's stripes were mostly vertical, of varying widths and sparingly used. In Simpson and Noland's case their stripe paintings were all mostly horizontal, while Gene Davis painted vertical stripe paintings and Morris Louis mostly painted vertical stripe paintings sometimes called Pillars. Jack Bush tended <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>both</b> horizontal and vertical stripe paintings as well as angular ones.|$|E
25|$|By this time, Maeser {{had to be}} {{replaced}} as president by the Board of Trustees. He had been called to oversee the entire LDS education program, and was unable <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>both</b> jobs. The Board's initial choice was the twenty-seven-year-old James E. Talmage, but before they could extend the invitation, {{he was hired by}} LDS College in Salt Lake City. They instead chose a recent graduate of the University of Michigan, Benjamin Cluff, Jr.. Cluff's methods as president have been described as nearly opposite those of Maeser. Maeser was insular and conservative in his teaching methods. He kept his teachings well within the LDS world, and adhered to classical education standards. Cluff was more open to new ideas and methods. He also believed that the world outside Mormonism had a lot to offer the school.|$|E

25|$|The {{calculation}} of $24 also fails {{to recognize that}} the concepts of property trading and ownership held by the 17th-century Dutch and East Coast natives were both different from modern conceptions. Comparisons to modern land dealing distort the reality of what Minuit was trying <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> <b>Both</b> the Dutch and the Indians undoubtedly included intangibles along with any hard goods in their concept of the total transactional value. For Indians and Minuit alike, both sides felt they were getting far more than a mere 60 guilders. For instance, the natives most certainly would have thought the trade included the value of the Dutch as potential military allies against rival Indian nations—a 'good' that could not be valued in currency alone. In addition, the value of the sale to Dutch and Indians alike would have included the prospect of future trade.|$|E
25|$|When {{rescission}} is claimed, it is {{not possible}} to also claim expectation damages as if the contract were to be performed. Either rescission, or damages as if the contract were still in force, can be claimed, but it would be inconsistent <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>both.</b> In Whittington v Seale-Hayne it was held that damages for losses as if the contract were still in force, and to put the claimant in the position as if he had never entered it, could not both be claimed. So where Mr Whittington's prize poultry died on a polluted farm which Seale-Hayne represented was sanitary, Mr Whittington got an indemnity for council rates and repair costs, but not for the loss of profits. At the time it was not possible to also recoup costs for the dead poultry, but later Hedley Byrne negligence or Misrepresentation Act 1967 s 2(1) provided this remedy.|$|E
25|$|The Macedonian {{literary}} circle (1938 – 1941) was {{a literary}} society created in Sofia, Bulgaria in 1938 by young and educated {{members of the}} Macedonian immigrant community, who were Bulgarian communists. After {{the resolution of the}} Comintern on the Macedonian Question published in 1934, the Bulgarian Communist Party adopted its thesis and tried to urge some intellectuals to work out a plan {{for the creation of a}} distinct Macedonian language and for development of new Macedonian literature. With the foundation of this society, an attempt was made, to use it in order <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>both.</b> Most active from its members were: Nikola Vaptsarov, Venko Markovski, Kole Nedelkovski, Vasil Ivanovski, Gjorgji Abadžiev, Anton Popov, Mihail Smatrakalev, Dimitar Mitrev and others. However, the circle disbanded itself as useless in the spring of 1941, when most of Macedonia came under Bulgarian administration, and an euphoria overwhelmed its participiants, seeing in it a form of national unification.|$|E

25|$|Stowers made {{a strong}} start to her {{professional}} career with a national title at the 2015 USA Indoor Track and Field Championships. Her winning time of 7.84 seconds took {{a tenth of a}} second off her previous best for the 60m hurdles. No longer having <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>both</b> academics and sport, her new focus on hurdling brought results at the Drake Relays, where she moved up to twelfth on the all-time lists with a new personal record of 12.40 seconds – three tenths faster than she had gone before. She also defeated former Olympic champion Dawn Harper-Nelson and world champion Brianna Rollins in the process. She improved one hundredth further at the Jamaica International Invitational, with a meeting record of 12.39 seconds. Her debut appearance on the 2015 IAAF Diamond League circuit established her as an elite international performer. She won the Doha Diamond League meeting in a series record time of 12.35 seconds – this moved her up to seventh on the all-time rankings for the 100m hurdles.|$|E

500|$|In 1992, Panavision {{launched}} {{a project to}} develop a camera that involved rethinking {{every aspect of the}} company's existing 35mm system. [...] Nolan Murdock and Albert Mayer Sr. headed up the design team. The new Millennium camera, replacing the Platinum as the company's flagship, was introduced in 1997. The Millennium XL came to the market in 1999 and was led by Al Mayer, Jr. [...] It soon established itself as Panavision’s new 35mm workhorse. [...] The XL was the first product in Panavision history to win both an Academy Award and a Primetime Emmy Award within the first year of official release. [...] The update to the XL, the XL2 was initially released in 2004[...] [...] The first feature films to use these latter two systems were, respectively, The Perfect Storm (2000) and Just Like Heaven (2005). The XL series not only had a much smaller camera body—making it suitable for studio, handheld, and steadicam work—but also marked the first significant change to the film transport mechanism in the camera since the Panaflex: two smaller sprocket drums for feed and take-up (a design similar to the Moviecam and subsequent Arricam) instead of one large drum <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>both.</b> As of 2006, Panavision has no further plans to develop additional film camera models.|$|E
