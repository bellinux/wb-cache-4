The fountain is protected by a cylindrical bell-shaped structure. Around the building is a raised wing, accessed by an intermediary landing of stairs, with black and white ceramic floors and iron guard painted green, decorated by stylized voluptuous motifs. These structures also integrate lamps on their angles into the high columns, with globe of lighting surrounded by several stylized arms (the globe lighting repeated from the ceiling). A gutter runs along the lowest part of the interior with drains in the corners. A centralized apparatus opens the six central rotary panels; by using a vertical iron rod, moved by a lever, allows the windows to be opened simultaneously. The rooftop is a grid of horizontal rods with bearings that run north to south supporting the weight of the structure.|$|E
