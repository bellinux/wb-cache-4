40|$|The present {{research}} focuses on analysing the judicial uncertainty in the implementation, interpretation and application of the ICC Statute both in international and national arenas. In this context examined are the parameters of state sovereignty as {{the main source of}} theoretical as well as practical contemporary debate on the relationship between lex specialis character of ICC norms and domestic legal regimes. Varying and frequently inconsistent degrees of international and national compliance with international criminal law due to the multiplicity of legal regimes are scrutinised by analysing the relationship between national and ICC measures with regard to aspects of pretrial proceedings, such as surrender of accused persons and <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>proceedings,</b> rights of suspects and defendants as well as some aspects of sentencing in so far as they affect the prima facie jurisdiction. One of the main objectives of the ICC Treaty is to advance the unification of international criminal law. Whilst it may be contended that this body of law is acquiring a great degree of specificity and uniformity in content through the Statute, both its development and importantly its scope are fundamentally reliant on interpretation and application at national level; it is here that international criminal law is fragmented. Consequently, its understanding and enforcement are inconsistent. The ICC Statute presents issues that are the result of the fusion of common and civil law traditions as well as a blend of diverse criminal laws within each one of those systems. Distinguishing between Anglo-American and Continental European criminal procedures has become increasingly complex and transgressed. Such blend of legal traditions, whilst it must ensure that justice is rendered with equality, fairness and effectiveness, generates nevertheless everincreasing lack of legal orientation. The aim of this pastiche is therefore to establish an international, uniform standard across contemporary justice systems. However, the application of the ICC provisions will depend on particular method of implementation of the Rome Treaty into domestic law, local political situation, the nature of a conflict (armed conflict is where most of the ICC crimes are likely to occur), any peace process involving regional amnesties and pardons and domestic policies and rules on sentencing. The general perception of the ICC and the law it represents is that of a powerful, centralised regime. Contrary to this belief, a proposition is made here for a less hierarchical international criminal justice that is fundamentally reliant upon national courts and law enforcement agencies. Such a proposition emphasises the need for the ICC involvement at a local level. In this context, the thesis sets out to clarify the ICC law and related Statute enforcement issues.

40|$|RÉSUMÉ IN ENGLISH The {{topic of}} this master thesis is the {{principle}} of promptness in the <b>criminal</b> <b>proceedings</b> because this question is nowadays the subject-matter of numerous discussions, {{in which it is}} spoken about overloaded Czech justice system, about delays in court proceedings and about options, how to relieve the system <b>of</b> Czech <b>criminal</b> justice system. The aim of the submitted thesis is to evaluate critically the current legal institutes helping to make the <b>criminal</b> <b>proceedings</b> faster, mainly the investigation of crimes, and to contemplate its potential extension, without having caused any more significant limitation of the right of the accused to defence. Among other principles, which stay often contrary to the principle of promptness and which the legislators always must bear in mind, are the principle of material truth and the principle of contradiction. The thesis is divided into seven basic chapters. The first chapter is the introduction. The second chapter deals with the meaning <b>of</b> promptness <b>of</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>proceedings</b> for each particular subject <b>of</b> the <b>criminal</b> <b>proceedings,</b> mainly for the accused and the injured party.

40|$|Employing {{systematic}} {{document analysis}} and other methods, {{this article analyses}} a long-standing and still relevant issue related to the interpretation and application of the law regulating relationships in the field <b>of</b> European Union <b>criminal</b> justice within the framework <b>of</b> the national <b>criminal</b> <b>proceedings</b> {{that are taking place}} in EU member states. The article places special emphasis on the explanation and application of the principle of mutual recognition within the framework of one of the newest instruments of international cooperation in the European Union <b>criminal</b> <b>proceedings</b> meant to prevent conflicts of exercise of jurisdiction and to solve issues arising between two or more member states. The analysis of conflicts of exercise of jurisdiction provided in this paper is not limited to a mere explanation of the concept as such, but includes an essential analysis of other related issues, such as the principle of mutual recognition, its influence on the recognition <b>of</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>proceedings</b> as parallel proceedings, and including other aspects related to the matching of the form <b>of</b> national <b>criminal</b> <b>proceedings</b> with the <b>criminal</b> <b>proceedings</b> taking place in another member state. Finally, significant attention is given to one of the objectives in terms of prevention and solution of conflicts of exercise of jurisdiction, namely, the ne bis in idem principle and its application in case <b>of</b> parallel <b>criminal</b> <b>proceedings</b> taking place in two or more member states. One of the key conclusions offered here is that in order to eliminate conflicts of exercise of jurisdiction, positive law in the process of conflicts of jurisdiction must become an effective measure in criminal justice; however, only on the condition that at least a minimum likelihood in the form <b>of</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>proceedings</b> adopted by different EU members states is ensured as a precondition necessary to enable a smooth application of the principle of mutual recognition...|$|R
