5|$|Cole {{completely}} reprinted {{the minutes}} of an extraordinary meeting of the Royal Institution of December 23, 1820, which show that these events were initiated through an observation made by a librarian of the Royal Institution named Sturt. Sturt reported to his superiors that on November 5, 1820, a number of pages were removed from books in the reading room of the institution, books Accum had read. On the instructions of his superiors, Sturt cut a small {{hole in the wall}} of the reading room to watch Accum from an adjoining room. On the evening of December 20, as recorded in the minutes, Sturt could see Accum <b>tear</b> <b>out</b> and walk off with a paper concerning the ingredients and uses of chocolate. The paper had been in an issue of Nicholson’s Journal. Accum's premises on Old Compton Street were searched on the order of a magistrate for the City of London, and torn pages were indeed discovered there. These could be matched to books belonging to the Royal Institution.|$|E
25|$|Guðrún {{answered}} {{that she did}} not wish to marry Atli, but her mother responded that with Atli she would be as happy as if both Sigurd and her son Sigmund were still alive. Furthermore, if she did not marry Atli, she would live without husband {{for the rest of her}} life. Guðrún responded that her mother should not be so eager to giver her away to the Huns, and she prophesied that Atli would kill Gunnarr and <b>tear</b> <b>out</b> the heart of Högni. Grímhildr began to weep when she heard the prophecy and told Guðrún that she was forced to give her away to Atli.|$|E
25|$|In June 2003, University of Dallas {{students}} (undergraduate and graduate), alumni, faculty, and Facilities and Grounds staff {{formed a}} joint enterprise to designed and constructed the new outdoor theater. They selected an {{area between the}} Braniff building and the Facilities building, which had been a neglected corner of campus, a dumping ground for rubble and rebar piled up over years {{to shore up the}} Facilities parking lot. The team reclaimed the former dump and transformed the area into a lush green space, with new sod, trees, sprinkler and drainage system. The crew, mostly student volunteers, worked through the torrid Texas summer to lay sod, trim and transplant trees, pack down limestone base, lay down the stage bricks, <b>tear</b> <b>out</b> poison ivy, and more.|$|E

25|$|The {{relationship}} of homo sapiens {{to the other}} animals is one of unremitting exploitation. We employ their work; we eat and wear them. We exploit them to serve our superstitions: whereas we used to sacrifice them to our gods and <b>tear</b> <b>out</b> their entrails in order to foresee the future, we now sacrifice them to science, and experiment on their entail in the hope—or on the mere off chance—that we might thereby see a little more clearly into the present... To us it seems incredible that the Greek philosophers should have scanned so deeply into right and wrong and yet never noticed the immorality of slavery. Perhaps 3000 years from now it will seem equally incredible {{that we do not}} notice the immorality of our own oppression of animals.|$|E
25|$|The Master {{agrees to}} help the Doctor {{stop the spread of}} Entropy by {{adapting}} the Pharos Project radio telescope on Earth so that they are able to reopen the CVEs. However, when the Master tries to take control of it, the Doctor runs out under the upturned radio dish to sever the cable linking the Master to the CVEs. The Master makes the dish start rotating so that the Doctor will fall to his death. Before he falls, he manages to <b>tear</b> <b>out</b> the cable, only to leave his companions watching as he clings to the cable. As his grip begins to slip, he sees visions of all the enemies he's faced over the years, then falls. Adric, Nyssa, and Tegan gather around the mortally wounded Doctor and call out his name. The Doctor begins seeing visions of all his companions and even the Brigadier calling his name.|$|E
500|$|The ravens {{who were}} the {{messengers}} of the highest god, Huginn and Muninn, increasingly had hellish connotations, and as early as in the Christian Sólarljóð, stanza 67, the ravens of Hel(l) (heljar hrafnar) who tear the eyes off backtalkers are mentioned. Two curses in the Poetic Edda say [...] "may ravens tear your heart asunder" [...] (...) [...] and [...] "the ravens shall <b>tear</b> <b>out</b> your eyes in the high gallows" [...] (...) [...] Ravens are thus seen as instruments of divine (if harsh and unpleasant) justice.|$|E

Catelyn holds off the {{attacker}} long enough for Bran's direwolf to jump in and <b>tear</b> <b>out</b> the assassin's throat. The murder attempt arouses Catelyn's suspicions, and after finding a strand of long blonde hair in the abandoned tower where Bran fell, she concludes that the Lannisters are somehow involved.

500|$|Seven {{months into}} her captivity, Garrido {{introduced}} Dugard to his wife, Nancy, {{who brought the}} child a stuffed animal and chocolate milk, and engaged in the same tearful apologies to her. Though Dugard craved the woman's approval at the time, in retrospect she has stated that she was manipulated by Nancy, who alternated between motherly concern and coldness and cruelty, expressing her jealousy of Dugard, whom she regarded as the one to blame for her predicament. Dugard characterized Nancy, {{who worked as a}} nursing home aide, as [...] "evil" [...] and [...] "twisted." [...] When Garrido was returned to prison for failing a drug test, Nancy replaced her husband as Dugard's jailer. The Garridos manipulated Dugard further by presenting her, on two occasions, with kittens that would later [...] "mysteriously vanish." [...] When they discovered that she was signing her real name in a journal that she kept on the kittens, she was forced to <b>tear</b> <b>out</b> the page with her name on it, the last time she would be permitted to say or write her name until years later. She was never allowed to see a doctor or dentist.|$|E

2500|$|On February 25, some {{construction}} details {{relating to}} the planking of the bow and stern still remained to be worked out, but the hull lines of the vessel were ready to be laid out. [...] The yacht was to be built at Supple's shipyard on the Willamette River {{at the foot of}} east Belmont Street, in Portland, Oregon. [...] It was necessary to <b>tear</b> <b>out</b> the wall of one of the sheds at the Supple yard {{to make room for the}} yacht's construction.

2500|$|The Sultan, however, was not {{prepared}} to relinquish any power. Abdul Hamid believed that the woes of the Ottoman Empire stemmed from [...] "the endless persecutions and hostilities of the Christian world." [...] He perceived the Ottoman Armenians to be an extension of foreign hostility, a means by which Europe could [...] "get at our most vital places and <b>tear</b> <b>out</b> our very guts." [...] Turkish historian and Abdul Hamid's biographer Osman Nuri observed, [...] "The mere mention of the word 'reform' irritated him , inciting his criminal instincts." [...] Upon hearing of the Armenian delegation's visit to Berlin in 1878, he bitterly remarked, [...] "Such great impudence...Such great treachery toward religion and state...May they be cursed upon by God." [...] While he admitted that some of their complaints were well-founded, he likened the Armenians to [...] "hired female mourners [...] who simulate a pain they do not feel; they are an effeminate and cowardly people who hide behind the clothes of the great powers and raise an outcry for the smallest of causes." ...|$|E
2500|$|Both {{boys and}} girls were brought up by the city women {{until the age of}} seven, when boys (paidia) were taken from their mothers and grouped {{together}} in [...] "packs" [...] (agelai) and were sent to what is almost equivalent to present-day military boot camp. This military camp was known as the Agoge. They became inured to hardship, being provided with scant food and clothing; this also encouraged them to steal, and if they were caught, they were punished – not for stealing, but for being caught. There is a characteristic story, told by Plutarch: [...] "The boys make such a serious matter of their stealing, that one of them, as the story goes, who was carrying concealed under his cloak a young fox which he had stolen, suffered the animal to <b>tear</b> <b>out</b> his bowels with its teeth and claws, and died rather than have his theft detected." [...] The boys were encouraged to compete against one another in games and mock fights and to foster an esprit de corps. In addition, they were taught to read and write and learned the songs of Tyrtaios, that celebrated Spartan exploits in the Second Messenian War. They learned to read and write not for cultural reasons, but so they could be able to read military maps. At the age of twelve, a boy was classed as a [...] "youth" [...] (meirakion). His physical education was intensified, discipline became much harsher, and the boys were loaded with extra tasks. The youths had to go barefoot, and were dressed only in a tunic both in summer and in winter.|$|E

2500|$|The American-style cabinet saws {{generally}} {{follow the}} model of the Delta Unisaw, a design that has evolved since 1939. Saws of this general type are made in the USA, Canada, Taiwan, and China. These saws are characterized by a cast iron top on a full-length steel base, square in section, with radiused corners. Two 3/8" [...] deep by 3/4" [...] wide miter slots are located parallel to the blade, one {{to the left of the}} blade and one to the right. The most common type of rip fence mounted to this type of saw is characterized by the standard model made by Biesemeyer (now a subsidiary of Delta). It has a sturdy, steel T-type fence mounted to a steel rail at the front of the saw. It has replaceable laminate faces. American cabinet saws are normally designed to accept a [...] " [...] wide stacked dado blade in addition to a standard saw blade. The most common size of blade is 10" [...] in diameter with a blade arbor diameter of [...] ", but 12" [...] or 14" [...] in diameter with a blade arbor diameter of 1" [...] are found in commercial/industrial sites. American saws normally include an anti-kickback device that incorporates a splitter, toothed anti-kickback pawls and a clear plastic blade cover. American style saws have an easily replaceable insert around the blade in the table top. This allows the use of zero-clearance inserts, which greatly reduce <b>tear</b> <b>out</b> on the bottom of the workpiece. It is common for this type of saw to be equipped with a table extension that increases ripping capacity for sheet goods to 50". The saw blade can tilt to either the left side or right side of the saw, depending on {{the model of}} saw. The original Delta Unisaw and early cabinet saws based on it were all right-tilt units while newer Delta Unisaws and many competitive cabinet saws made after 2000 are left-tilt saws. The switch to left-tilt design is due to a lower perceived propensity for the cut piece to become trapped between the rip fence and blade and kick back when the blade tilts away from the rip fence (left tilt saw) versus towards the rip fence (right tilt saw.) While conceptually simple in design, these saws are highly evolved and are capable of efficient, high volume, precision work.|$|E
