5|$|Years later, Bennett would {{recall his}} dismay at {{being asked to}} do {{contemporary}} material, comparing it to when his mother was forced to produce a cheap dress. By 1972, he had departed Columbia for the Verve division of MGM Records (Philips in the UK) and had relocated for a stint in London, where he hosted a television show from the <b>Talk</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Town</b> nightclub in conjunction with Thames Television, Tony Bennett at the <b>Talk</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Town.</b> With his new label, he tried a variety of approaches, including some more Beatles material, but found no renewed commercial success, and in a couple more years he was without a recording contract.|$|E

50|$|Part of Ian McEwan's award-winning novel Atonement (2001) {{centers on}} Briony Tallis, {{a nurse in}} a London {{hospital}} in June 1940, to which wounded British and French soldiers evacuated from Dunkirk were brought. In a poignant passage, she is comforting Luc Cornet, a young soldier from Millau who is dying of severe head wounds.

Phips {{was treated as}} a hero in London, and the find was the <b>talk</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>town.</b> Some economic historians argue that Phips' find significantly affected history because it led to a major increase in the formation of joint-stock companies, and even {{played a role in the}} eventual formation in the Bank of England.|$|E
5|$|One of these, The <b>Talk</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Town,</b> was {{the first}} three-time World Grand Champion. Midnight Sun was also great-grandsire of I Am Jose, the second three-time winner. Most of the leading Tennessee Walker sires {{in recent years have}} {{themselves}} been descendants of Midnight Sun. Midnight Sun sired approximately 2,600 foals in his lifetime, and during his stud career earned his owners close to $100,000 a year, mostly through the then-new use of artificial insemination (AI). Through his offspring, he has also influenced the Racking Horse and Spotted Saddle Horse breeds. For many years, a life-size statue of Midnight Sun, commissioned after his death by his former owner Geraldine Livingston, stood at the TWHBEA headquarters in Lewisburg, Tennessee.|$|E

25|$|In July 1968, Durham {{announced}} that she was leaving The Seekers to pursue a solo career and the group disbanded. Their final performance, on 7 July, was screened live by the BBC as a special called Farewell the Seekers, with an audience of more than 10million viewers. The special had been preceded by a week-long season at London's <b>Talk</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Town</b> nightclub and a live recording {{of one of their}} shows was released as a live LP record, Live at the <b>Talk</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Town.</b> It reached No.2 on the UK charts. Also in July, the compilation album The Seekers' Greatest Hits was released and spent 17 weeks at No.1 in Australia. It was released as The Best of The Seekers in the UK and spent 6 weeks at No.1 in 1969, managing to knock The Beatles' (White Album) {{off the top of the}} charts and preventing The Rolling Stones' Beggars Banquet from reaching the top spot. The album spent 125 weeks in the charts in the UK.|$|E

She returned to the UK with a record-breaking run of performances at the <b>Talk</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Town</b> nightclub. Also that year, her album Something was released, and showcased a new Bassey style, a shift from traditional pop to more contemporary songs and arrangements (the eponymous single was more successful in the UK charts than the original recording by The Beatles) – although Bassey would never completely abandon what that had been her forte: standards, show tunes, and torch songs.|$|E

25|$|Local gossips noticed Wright's flirtations, and he {{developed}} a reputation in Oak Park as a man-about-town. His family had grown to six children, but Wright was not parental and he relied on his wife Catherine to care for them. In 1903, Wright designed a house for Edwin Cheney, a neighbor in Oak Park, and immediately took a liking to Cheney's wife, Mamah. Mamah Cheney was a modern woman with interests outside the home. She was an early feminist and Wright viewed her as his intellectual equal. The two fell in love, and they became the <b>talk</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>town,</b> as they often could be seen taking rides in Wright's automobile through Oak Park. Wright's wife, Kitty, sure that this attachment would fade as the others had, refused to grant him a divorce.

[...] Midnight Sun sired five horses who won the World Grand Championship: Midnight Merry in 1949; The <b>Talk</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Town</b> in 1951, 1952, and 1953; Sun's Jet Parade in 1957; Setting Sun in 1958; and Sun's Delight D. in 1963.|$|E
60|$|Not {{but what}} {{there were some}} two or three youngsters who {{manifested}} <b>the</b> first dawning <b>of</b> what is called fire and spirit, who held all labor in contempt, skulked about docks and market-places, loitered in the sunshine, squandered what little money they could procure at hustle cap and chuck farthing; swore, boxed, fought cocks, and raced their neighbor's horses; in short, who promised to be the wonder, <b>the</b> <b>talk,</b> and abomination <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>town,</b> had not their stylish career been unfortunately cut short by an affair of honor with a whipping post.|$|R
60|$|While he was <b>talking</b> to some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>town</b> people, he saw Nettie come up {{and join}} a young man at the door whom he had {{recognized}} as the tenor in the choir; and they sauntered off together under the full-leafed maples--she in dainty white and pink, he in a miraculously modish suit of gray, a rose in his lapel.

The Bosnian Serb suspension <b>of</b> <b>talks</b> and shelling <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>town</b> 'seemed a deliberate act of malice and political intent'.

500|$|Sain had {{previously}} {{competed in the}} four-year-old age division and was expected to win the World Championship in that division, but she bypassed the class {{in favor of the}} World Grand Championship.

500|$|The central {{action of}} Love's Last Shift {{is a celebration}} of the power of a good woman, Amanda, to reform a rakish husband, Loveless, by means of sweet {{patience}} and a daring bed-trick. She masquerades as a prostitute and seduces Loveless without being recognised, and then confronts him with logical argument. Since he enjoyed the night with her while taking her for a stranger, a wife can be as good in bed as an illicit mistress. Loveless is convinced and stricken, and a rich choreography of mutual kneelings, risings and prostrations follows, generated by Loveless' penitence and Amanda's [...] "submissive eloquence". The première audience is said to have wept at this climactic scene. The play was a great box-office success and was for a time the <b>talk</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>town,</b> in both a positive and a negative sense. Some contemporaries regarded it as moving and amusing, others as a sentimental tear-jerker, incongruously interspersed with sexually explicit Restoration comedy jokes and semi-nude bedroom scenes.|$|E
500|$|In 1942 Grant {{participated in}} a three-week tour of the United States {{as part of a}} group to help the war effort and was photographed visiting wounded marines in hospital. He {{appeared}} in several routines of his own during these shows and often played the straight-man opposite Bert Lahr. In May 1942, the ten-minute propaganda short Road to Victory was released, in which he appeared alongside Bing Crosby, Frank Sinatra and Charles Ruggles. On film, Grant played Leopold Dilg, a convict on the run in The <b>Talk</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Town</b> (1942), who escapes after being wrongly convicted of arson and murder. He hides in a house with characters played by Jean Arthur and Ronald Colman, and gradually plots to secure his freedom. Crowther praised the script, and noted that Grant played Dilg with a [...] "casualness which is slightly disturbing". After a role as a foreign correspondent opposite Ginger Rogers and Walter Slezak in the off-beat comedy Once Upon a Honeymoon, in which he was praised for his scenes with Rogers, he appeared in Mr. Lucky the following year, playing a gambler in a casino aboard a ship. The commercially successful submarine war film Destination Tokyo (1943) was shot in just six weeks in the September and October, which left him exhausted; the reviewer from Newsweek thought {{it was one of the}} finest performances of his career.|$|E
