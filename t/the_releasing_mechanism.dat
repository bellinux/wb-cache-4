40|$|Abstract: Transfer is the {{critical}} issue of producing high-quality and scalable graphene electronic devices. However, conventional transfer processes require the removal of an underlying metal layer by wet etching process, which induces significant economic and environmental problems. We propose the etching-free mechanical releasing of graphene using polymer adhesives. A fracture mechanics approach was introduced to understand <b>the</b> <b>releasing</b> <b>mechanism</b> and ensure high-yield process. It is shown that the thickness of adhesive and target substrate affect the transferability of graphene. Based on experimental and fracture mechanics simulation results, we further observed that compliant adhesives can reduce the adhesive stress during the transfer, which also enhances the success probability of graphene transfer...|$|E

Two variants were found that had decreased phospholipid methyltransferase enzyme levels and were unable to cause an influx of Ca 2 + or release histamine in an IgE-mediated reaction. However, these cells were able to release histamine through an ionophore-induced reaction, indicating that <b>the</b> <b>releasing</b> <b>mechanism</b> distal to the Ca 2 + channel was intact. One cell line, 1 C 1. B 1, had low specific activity for phospholipid methyltransferase I. A second variant, 2 H 3. B 6, had reduced phospholipid methyltransferase II activity. Although both variants were unable to incorporate label from [methyl- 3 H]methionine or [3 H]serine into phosphatidylcholine, {{they were able to}} incorporate [methyl- 3 H]choline and myo-[2 - 3 H(N) ]inositol into phospholipids. Fusion of the two cell lines and isolation on selective media resulted in the growth of eight independent hybrids. All eight had an increased number of chromosomes and normal phospholipid methyltransferase activities. Stimulation of the hybrids with IgE resulted in CA 2 + influx and histamine release.

40|$|International audienceIn this paper, {{we propose}} a new bricked cache system {{suitable}} for a particular surface propagation algorithm : seismic horizon reconstruction. The application domain of this algorithm is the interpretation of seismic volumes used, for instance, by petroleum companies for oil prospecting. To ensure the optimality of such surface extraction, the algorithm must access randomly into the data volume. This lack of data locality imposes that the volume resides entirely in the main memory to reach decent performances. In case of volumes larger than the memory, we show that using a classical brick cache strategy can also produce good performances until a certain size. As the size of these volumes increases very quickly, and can now reach more than 200 GB, we demonstrate that the performances of the classical algorithm are dramatically reduced when processed on standard workstation with a limited size of memory (currently 8 GB to 16 GB). In order to handle such large volumes, we introduce a new slimming brick cache strategy where bricks size evolves according to processed data : at {{each step of the}} algorithm, processed data could be removed from the cache. This new brick format allows to have a larger number of brick loaded in memory. We further improve <b>the</b> <b>releasing</b> <b>mechanism</b> by filling in priority the “holes” that appear in the surface during the propagation process. With this new cache strategy, horizons can be extracted into volumes that are up to 75 {{times the size of the}} available cache memory.

40|$|The main {{objectives}} of the work presented in this thesis were to develop new experimental methods to improve the understanding of <b>the</b> <b>release</b> <b>mechanism</b> from a coated formulation and to develop new mechanistic models to describe <b>the</b> <b>release</b> process for pellets coated with a semi-permeable film. Another aim was to characterize <b>the</b> <b>release</b> <b>mechanism</b> from a formulation coated with films made of a blend of a water-insoluble polymer, ethyl cellulose (EC), and a water-soluble polymer, hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC). The work dealt with free films intended for coating and with coated multiple-unit systems. Two methodologies were mainly {{used in the study}} of free films. Electronic speckle pattern interferometry made it possible to discriminate between a semi-permeable and a permeable film. For a permeable film, the effective diffusion coefficient of a drug in the film was determined. A new release cell equipped with a manometer was developed. The combination of pressure and release data made it possible to easily and accurately characterize <b>the</b> <b>release</b> <b>mechanism,</b> to discriminate between semi-permeable and permeable films, and to detect changes {{in the structure of the}} film and in <b>the</b> <b>release</b> <b>mechanism</b> during <b>the</b> <b>release.</b> A mechanistic model describing the lag phase of pellets coated with a semi-permeable film undergoing cracking due to hydrostatic pressure build-up was developed. The model was validated against experimentally determined whole-dose release profiles of pellets coated with an EC-based film. The model showed that a small variation in the film thickness has a significant influence on the lag time. A mechanistic model to describe <b>the</b> osmotic pumping <b>release</b> from pellets coated with a semi-permeable film containing water-filled channels was also developed. The model was validated by comparison with experimentally determined release profiles of single pellets coated with a film made of EC and HPC. Via model simulation it was found that the concentration profile in the channels was almost constant. The HPC content of EC/HPC films affects the amount of HPC leached out of the films, and thus <b>the</b> <b>release</b> <b>mechanism.</b> <b>The</b> <b>release</b> <b>mechanism</b> changed from osmotic pumping to diffusion as the amount of HPC increased.

40|$|Fungal spores play {{important}} role in the health of humans, animals, and plants by constituting a class of the primary biological aerosol particles (PBAPs). Additionally, these could mediate the hydrological cycle by acting as nuclei for ice and cloud formation (IN and CCN respectively). Various processes in the biosphere and the variations in the meteorological conditions control <b>the</b> <b>releasing</b> <b>mechanism</b> of spores through active wet and dry discharge. In the present paper, we simulate the concentration of fungal spores over the Indian region during three distinct meteorological seasons by combining a numerical model (WRF-Chem) with the fungal spore emissions based on land-use type. Maiden high-resolution regional simulations revealed large spatial gradient and strong seasonal dependence in the concentration of fungal spores over the Indian region. The fungal spore concentrations are found to be the highest during winter (0 - 70 mu g m(- 3) in December), moderately higher during summer (0 - 35 mu g m(- 3) in May) and lowest during the monsoon (0 - 25 mu g m(- 3) in July). The elevated concentrations during winter are attributed to the shallower boundary layer trapping the emitted fungal spores in smaller volume. In contrast, the deeper boundary layer mixing in May and stronger monsoonal-convection in July distribute the fungal spores throughout the lower troposphere (similar to 5 km). We suggest that the higher fungal spore concentrations during winter could have potential health impacts. While, stronger vertical mixing could enable fungal spores to influence the cloud formation during summer and monsoon. Our study provides the first information about the distribution and seasonal variation of fungal spores over the densely populated and observationally sparse Indian region. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

30|$|Similar to the MJ and SA results, {{treatment}} with MJ + SA also increased {{the production of}} bilobalide and ginkgolides. Treatment with 0.1  mM MJ +  0.1  mM SA stimulated the release of bilobalide and ginkgolides A, B and C {{at the highest level}} after 72 -h incubation up to 78, 79, 71 and 7.5  mg/g DW, respectively, compared with all treatments in immobilized cells, whereas 0.01  mM MJ +  0.01  mM SA stimulated the release of bilobalide and ginkgolides A, B and C up to 70, 75, 68 and 6.6  mg/g DW, respectively. Biotic elicitors such as MJ are considered signal molecules that act as key compounds of the signal transduction pathway involved in the induction of the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, which takes part in plant defense reactions (Almagro et al. 2009). In addition, SA is also a well-known compound that induces a rapid and local activation of defense responses that are mediated by several resistance genes against some pathogens and other stress factors by producing certain compounds and proteins, such as pathogenesis-related proteins (Li et al. 2004). In this research, we found that the synergism of MJ and SA increased the release of bilobalide and ginkgolides A, B and C into the liquid medium of immobilized cells. The secretion of compounds from cells into liquid media allows the generation of higher production quantities, because a product accumulated intracellularly sometimes inhibits its own synthesis by regulating mechanisms such as product inhibition and repression. Kang et al. (2006) reported that releasing ginkgolides and bilobalide through MJ and SA treatment was caused by medium acidification. MJ and SA treatment changes medium acidification, which could perturb the equilibrium between the intracellular and extracellular compartments. The releasing of secondary metabolites to the medium {{may be the result of}} many factors, including feedback inhibition of membrane transport, biosynthesis, gene activity, degradation of the product by enzymatic or non-enzymatic processes in the medium or cells, and volatility of substances produced (Luckner 1990).

40|$|In {{piston ring}} pack design, {{there is a}} {{tradeoff}} between reducing friction and increasing oil consumption. While friction reduces engine efficiency, oil consumption can poison exhaust aftertreatment systems. The primary method in studying the balance between friction and oil consumption is by understanding and modeling oil transport. This study used Two-Dimensional Laser Induced Fluorescence (2 D LIF) on a one-cylinder spark ignition research engine to view real-time oil transport in the power cylinder. The Lower Region, comprised of the 3 ' Land, skirt chamfer, the oil control ring (OCR), and the OCR groove, {{was the focus of}} this study for a number of real-world engine operating conditions. Previous studies noted that the interaction between oil and blowby gas flow is complex and important. What this research study attempted was a characterization and decoupling of the mechanisms governing oil transport {{into and out of the}} groove. This was accomplished by testing multiple piston ring pack configurations, thereby analyzing the effects of OCR and groove design. Namely a piston with no drain holes, a "Multi-Enlarged Hole" piston, and a baseline/production piston were used in conjunction with a U-Flex and Two-Piece OCR. In carrying out this analysis, a gross scaling relationship was created, utilizing the obtained LIF videos as a connection between the scaling model and the experiments' results. Mechanisms were classified into three types of oil transport: supply, release, and leakage. The primary mechanism of oil supply to the groove occurred during the intake stroke due to OCR downscraping. Oil's release from the groove was via the drain holes due to viscous shearing by blowby gases during the expansion stroke. It was found necessary that <b>the</b> <b>releasing</b> <b>mechanism</b> properly utilize the gas flow as well as the drainage area. Oil leakage out the groove was shown to be caused by inertia forcing oil out through the OCR gap during the intake, compression, and exhaust strokes. It was revealed that this leakage supplied oil to the Upper Region under throttled conditions. Additionally, the leakage locally affected the oil patterns of the 3 rd Land and skirt. This study is the first to document many phenomena involved in oil transport within the Lower Region. The scaling relationships that resulted from such analysis created a framework that is an initial step towards a more complete model of oil transport in the Lower Region. by Eric B. SenzerThesis (Ph.

The volume of generic tobramycin powder is more than 3. 5  times the volume of proprietary tobramycin powder for a 1. 2  g dose leading to the question: Does generic tobramycin elute from AL-PMMA faster than proprietary tobramycin?
