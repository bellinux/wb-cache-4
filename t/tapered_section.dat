50|$|At {{the rear}} of the cabin is a <b>tapered</b> <b>section</b> of simple {{semi-monocoque}} construction, which is closed by a robust hinged rear loading ramp, which serves as the main entrance for bulky loads or equipment. The loading ramp is jettisonable in emergency situations. Additionally, there is a sliding door located on the forward starboard side, while a small hinged emergency door is set on the aft port side. The tail boom uses conventional semi-monocoque construction, supported by closely spaced notched channel-section frames and continuous stringers, absent of any major longitudinal sections or longerons. The cranked section carrying the tail rotor and trim plane is more robust, strengthened by a solid-web spar, frames, and stiffeners. The juncture of the main boom and cranked section is hinged {{in order to reduce the}} rotorcraft's folded length to 58ft.

50|$|An {{oil water}} {{separation}} hydrocyclone is a device designed to separate oil from water {{by the use}} of a strong vortex. These separators are passive (no moving parts) and resemble long tapered pipes. They typically contain an inlet section, long <b>tapered</b> <b>section</b> and a long outlet section. In operation the strong vortex is created when the oily water is injected tangentially into the inlet end of the separator. This creates a centrifugal force, that accelerates as it moves down the tapered cone. The centripetal and centrifugal forces separate the heavier water component to the outside of the vortex while the lighter oil droplets are forced to the centre. The separated oils are removed through an orifice at the inlet end of the cone and treated water is discharged through the opposite end. The centrifugal forces generated inside the vortex of the better de-oiling hydrocyclone separators are of the order of 1,000 times the force of gravity. This is why smaller emulsified oil droplets as low as 15 microns can be removed.|$|E

The corresponding slope efficiencies are 71. 8 % and 54. 1 %, respectively.

Plastic design for portal frame has become popular in these days. However in Sri Lanka, most Designers adopt elastic design due to the scarcity of analytical and design software dealing with plastic design. There is no proper way of plastic analysis unlike the elastic analysis. Reactions for the plastic analysis are calculated after analyzing a number of collapse mechanisms.

In this research, design of portal frames with tapered sections are done plastically and elastically but it was observed that plastic analysis is much difficult to detect the exact position of the plastic hinge. Then elastic design was done with tapered sections using CADD A 3 D Software package. Variable section properties were taken into consideration by dividing the member into small elements with the guide line given in BS 5950 and in particular appendix G, covering a span range of 20 m to 50 m for the spacing of 4. 5 m, 6. 0 m and 9. 0 m with eave height of 4. 5 m and 6. 0 m using 355 N/mm 2 and 275 N/mm 2 strength steel plates.

40|$|The current project {{consists}} on {{the design}} of a simplified commercial aircraft wing made of carbon fiber material. A real commercial aircraft is used as a model {{in order to create a}} wing model by using finite element modelling techniques through the use of ABAQUS software. The development of the wing model involves the creation of each of the structural members of the wing, the joint of them in order to create the final model, the creation of the mesh necessary for the analysis and the application of the loads to perform an analysis that accurately predicts the stresses and displacement that the wing withstands. Two different models are presented, one consisting on one <b>tapered</b> <b>section</b> wing and the second consisting on a wing with two tapered sections. These models are subjected to two different wing loads in cruise conditions, a simplified triangular load and a load that represents a real distribution of aerodynamic loads in the wing.
