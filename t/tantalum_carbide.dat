50|$|The bonding between {{tantalum}} {{and carbon}} atoms in <b>tantalum</b> <b>carbides</b> {{is a complex}} mixture of ionic, metallic and covalent contributions, {{and because of the}} strong covalent component, these carbides are very hard and brittle materials.

50|$|Direct {{solar heating}} {{involves}} exposing the propellant directly to solar radiation.

40|$|Abstract: The {{purpose of}} this work is to examine if the {{behavior}} of refractory alloys in oxidation at high temperature can {{be influenced by the}} modification of the interdendritic carbides morphology due to a preliminary aging treatment at high temperature.

Thermogravimetry runs were performed in air at 1000, 1100 and 1200 °C during 50 hours, and the results were analyzed in order to specify the rates of transient oxidation, of parabolic oxidation and of chromia volatilization.

Broadly speaking, UHTCs are borides, carbides, nitrides, and oxides of early transition metals. Current efforts have focused on heavy, early transition metal borides such as hafnium diboride (HfB2) and zirconium diboride (ZrB2); additional UHTCs under investigation for TPS applications include hafnium nitride (HfN), zirconium nitride (ZrN), titanium carbide (TiC), titanium nitride (TiN), thorium dioxide (ThO2), <b>tantalum</b> <b>carbide</b> (TaC) and their associated composites.|$|E
50|$|Regarding {{fine-grained}} hardmetal, {{an attempt}} {{has been made}} to follow the scientific and technological steps associated with its production; this task is not easy, though, because of the restrictions placed by commercial, and in some cases research, organisations, in not publicising relevant information until long after the date of the initial work. Thus, placing data in an historical, chronological order is somewhat difficult. However, it has been possible to establish that as far back as 1929, approximately 6 years after the first patent was granted, Krupp/Osram workers had identified the positive aspects of tungsten carbide grain refinement. By 1939 they had also discovered the beneficial effects of adding a small amount of vanadium and <b>tantalum</b> <b>carbide.</b> This effectively controlled discontinuous grain growth.|$|E
40|$|Transition metal {{carbides}} {{are used in}} industry as protective hard coatings as they combine high hardness and wear resistance with a lower friction coefficient than nitrides. <b>Tantalum</b> and molybdenum <b>carbides</b> are examples of coatings that are widely used industrially in some specific applications. For example, they are often employed as protective materials against wear and adhesion in die-casting moulds. Although these {{metal carbides}} do not present an extremely high hardness, they possess excellent low friction and wear resistant properties. These interesting properties make these coatings excellent candidates for use in applications that involve sliding contact situations. In this paper, we present a tribological characterization of <b>tantalum</b> and molybdenum <b>carbide</b> coatings, each in two variants with different chemical composition, in abrasive and sliding wear conditions against alumina and hardened steel. The results were compared to those of a titanium nitride reference coating. It {{was found that the}} <b>tantalum</b> and molybdenum <b>carbide</b> coatings were not as resistant to abrasion as the titanium nitride. However, due to their extremely low friction coefficient values they were considered superior in sliding applications against both steel and alumina...|$|R
50|$|Very few {{measurements}} of melting point in <b>tantalum</b> hafnium <b>carbide</b> have been reported, {{because of the}} obvious experimental difficulties at extreme temperatures. A 1965 study of the TaC-HfC solid solutions at temperatures 2225-2275 °C found a minimum in the vaporization rate and thus maximum in the thermal stability for Ta4HfC5. This rate was {{comparable to that of}} tungsten and was weakly dependent on the initial density of the samples, which were sintered from TaC-HfC powder mixtures, also at 2225-2275 °C. In a separate study, Ta4HfC5 was found to have the minimum oxidation rate among the TaC-HfC solid solutions. Ta4HfC5 was manufactured by Goodfellow company as a 45 µm powder at a price of $9,540/kg (99.0% purity).|$|R
5000|$|At high {{temperature}} {{the heat is}} transferred predominantly by thermal radiation (rather than thermal conduction). However, hydrogen gas used as propellant is very much transparent for this radiation. Therefore, in most gas core reactor rocket concepts some sort of seeding of propellant by opaque solid or liquid particles was considered necessary. Natural choice would be carbon soot which are however chemically unstable in hydrogen rich environment at {{high temperature}} and pressure. Thus rather dust particles tungsten or <b>Tantalum</b> hafnium <b>carbide</b> ( [...] melting point 3,928 °C [...] ) or liquid tungsten droplets ( [...] boiling point 5550 °C [...] ) were preferred. This particles would make up to 4% of mass of exhaust gas, which considerably increase propellant cost and slightly lower specific impulse.|$|R
50|$|Gauge blocks {{are usually}} made either from {{hardened}} alloy tool steels or from cemented carbides (such as tungsten carbide or <b>tantalum</b> <b>carbide).</b> Often the carbide has a hardness of 1500 Vickers hardness. Long series blocks {{are made from}} high-quality steel having cross section (35 × 9 mm) with holes for clamping two slips together. These are also available in carbon steel material. Steel blocks are hardened and tempered. The hardness {{is important because it}} slows down the gauge's rate of wear during use (this is why other kinds of gauges, such as pins, thread plugs, and rings, are also hardened.) The cutting of the blocks to size is accomplished with grinding followed by lapping. Usually no plating or other coating is involved. Blocks are kept very lightly oiled, and are stored and used in dry climate-controlled conditions; unplated, uncoated steel gauge blocks can last for decades without rusting.|$|E
50|$|These zones also act {{as local}} {{galvanic}} couples, causing local galvanic corrosion. This condition {{happens when the}} material is heated to temperature around 700 °C for too long time, and often happens during welding or an improper heat treatment. When zones of such material form due to welding, the resulting corrosion is termed weld decay. Stainless steels can be stabilized against this behavior by addition of titanium, niobium, or tantalum, which form titanium carbide, niobium carbide and <b>tantalum</b> <b>carbide</b> preferentially to chromium carbide, by lowering the content of carbon in the steel and in case of welding also in the filler metal under 0.02%, or by heating the entire part above 1000 °C and quenching it in water, leading to dissolution of the chromium carbide in the grains and then preventing its precipitation. Another possibility {{is to keep the}} welded parts thin enough so that, upon cooling, the metal dissipates heat too quickly for chromium carbide to precipitate. The ASTM A923, ASTM A262, and other similar tests are often used to determine when stainless steels are susceptible to intergranular corrosion. The tests require etching with chemicals that reveal the presence of intermetallic particles, sometimes combined with Charpy V-Notch and other mechanical testing.|$|E
50|$|The {{fluorides}} of tantalum can be {{used for}} its separation from niobium. Tantalum forms halogen compounds in the oxidation states of +5, +4, and +3 of the type , , and , although multi-core complexes and substoichiometric compounds are also known. Tantalum pentafluoride (TaF5) is a white solid with a melting point of 97.0 °C and tantalum pentachloride (TaCl5) is a white solid with a melting point of 247.4 °C. Tantalum pentachloride is hydrolyzed by water and reacts with additional tantalum at elevated temperatures by forming the black and highly hygroscopic tantalum tetrachloride (TaCl4). While the trihalides can be obtained by reduction of the pentahalides with hydrogen, the dihalides do not exist. A tantalum-tellurium alloy forms quasicrystals. Tantalum compounds with oxidation states as low as −1 have been reported in 2008.As in the cases of most other refractory metals, the hardest known compounds of tantalum are its stable nitrides and carbides. <b>Tantalum</b> <b>carbide,</b> TaC, like the more commonly used tungsten carbide, is a very hard ceramic that is used in cutting tools.
