50|$|The humor {{employed}} in <b>the</b> <b>strips</b> are {{a mixture of}} Filipino slice-of-life gags, social commentary, and satires of popular culture fixtures (such as movies and TV shows).

This, in part, explains <b>the</b> <b>strip's</b> occasional foray into sci-fi themes.

5|$|However, the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) {{criticized the}} design of Grandpa Boris and charged it with being anti-Semitic.

The ADL {{issued a statement saying}} that the design resembled Nazi-era depictions of Jews, {{and the fact that the}} character was reciting the sacred prayer perverted its solemnity. The Washington Post, the newspaper who published <b>the</b> <b>strip,</b> issued a similar statement in their Editor's Note section, criticizing Nickelodeon for not showing better judgment in editing <b>the</b> <b>strip.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{phenomenon}} f spiral pair synchronization byoscillating strips (Nozaki-Bekki solution) in a 2 D CGLE is investigated analytically. The equations {{describing the}} interaction of <b>the</b> <b>strips</b> {{with one another and}} with spirals are derived. Analysis of the equations shows that under certain conditions <b>the</b> <b>strips</b> lead to frequency and phase locking of the spirals. In this case the spiral pair (dipole) is aligned parallel to <b>the</b> <b>strips,</b> with <b>the</b> position along <b>the</b> <b>strips</b> being arbitrary. Thus, <b>the</b> interaction with <b>strips</b> may transform <b>the</b> spatio-temporal chaos of spirals to the regime of periodically oscillating spatial disorder. The dynamics of circular strips is investigated and their lifetime is estimated. The behavior of the spirals bounded by circular stript is analysed. 1...|$|R

This storyline led to a Pulitzer Prize nomination for Trudeau, but three newspapers of the 900 carrying <b>the</b> <b>strip</b> refused to publish it as being in bad taste. Two years later, the long-standing character Mark Slackmeyer was revealed to be gay, continuing a reputation for controversial content.

40|$|Previous {{observations}} {{have shown}} that slugs found favourable conditions for reproduction in wildflower strips and that they caused high damage to oilseed rape adjacent to <b>the</b> <b>strips.</b> In <b>the</b> current study slug numbers and damage were estimated in wildflower strips and at different distances from <b>the</b> <b>strips</b> into winter wheat crops, from 1994 to 1996. Slug damage was estimated using an index of defoliation and slug numbers and activity were measured using wheat bran traps. Investigations began when winter wheat seedlings emerged and lasted for five weeks. Slug damage was never severe {{in any of the}} fields studied. In most fields, slug damage was higher close to <b>the</b> wildflower <b>strips</b> than at greater distances from <b>the</b> <b>strips.</b> <b>The</b> declining slug damage with increasing distances from <b>the</b> wildflowers <b>strips</b> was related to the distribution pattern of juvenile Arion lusitanicus, suggesting that this species was responsible for the higher damage near <b>the</b> <b>strips.</b> Other slug species (Deroceras reticulatum, Arion fasciatus, Deroceras laeve) were more or less evenly distributed over the field or were almost entirely confined to <b>the</b> wildflower <b>strips.</b> Results showed that winter wheat was not at risk from slug feeding in spite of the establishment of wildflower strips and that therefore the application of molluscicide along <b>the</b> <b>strips</b> is unnecessar...|$|R
