Kelley announcing, [...] "We're all here because we're enraged at the fact that someone, anyone, in the United States today would question someone who has 30 years of service." [...] Specter's campaign replied they would not remove the commercial because it was accurate, and instead called on Sestak to remove his own advertisement, claiming it violated United States Department of Defense guidelines because it used military images, references and jargon without a disclaimer that it was not endorsed by the department.|$|E
