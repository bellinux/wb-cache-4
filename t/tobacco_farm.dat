5|$|On April 10, 1941, Day and Henrietta Lacks {{were married}} in Halifax County, Virginia. Later that year, their cousin, Fred Garrett, {{convinced}} the couple to leave the <b>tobacco</b> <b>farm</b> in Virginia and move to Maryland where Day Lacks could work at Bethlehem Steel in Sparrow's Point.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a review on {{the literature of}} <b>tobacco</b> <b>farming</b> on the observed research {{on the impact of}} <b>tobacco</b> <b>farming</b> on the livelihoods of smallholder farmers as well its impact on land. In this study I drew on the existing academic structure on <b>tobacco</b> <b>farming</b> in Zimbabwe. An examination of the determinants of farmer partaking in <b>tobacco</b> <b>farming</b> was carried out on 30 smallholder farmers. The case was Mount Bokoto ward 24 in Murewa District. This study was therefore initiated with the aims to (i) to evaluate the extent to which <b>tobacco</b> <b>farming</b> has contributed to the degradation of land (ii) to assess how <b>tobacco</b> <b>farming</b> has affected livelihood (iii) to find ways of preventing massive degradation of land due to <b>tobacco</b> <b>farming.</b> Purposive sampling was used to select the smallholder farmers. Questionnaires and interviews were used to collect data. The findings show that <b>tobacco</b> <b>farming</b> improved the livelihoods of smallholder through impacting better income, improved household food security, increased assert ownership, better standard of living, improved household asserts, creation of employment and improved housing structure but however though <b>tobacco</b> <b>farming</b> has improved livelihood it has caused land degradation such as soil erosion, siltation of dams, infiltration, deforestation, desertification, global warming...|$|R

He then bought a <b>tobacco</b> <b>farm</b> himself which was destroyed shortly thereafter during the Reform War. Bankrupt, he returned to Germany in 1859 and entered his father's business. His 1866 marriage to Emilie Louise (born 1836) made him financially independent. Three children were born to them. When Lüderitz's father died in 1878 {{he took over the}} tobacco business.|$|E
25|$|The {{family moved}} to Keysville, Virginia, in 1916. There were eight Reid children, four girls and four boys. All but one survived into adulthood. Boone Reid worked a series of jobs during the 1910s and 1920s, {{occasionally}} taking work in factories and shipyards in other states. The {{rest of the family}} lived with an uncle.

40|$|Communities and {{countries}} experiencing poverty, high unemployment, and economic reliance on tobacco growing {{are vulnerable to}} predatory tobacco industry behaviour. This analysis presents a cross-national survey of social disruption in <b>tobacco</b> <b>farming</b> to illustrate the association between tobacco companies and tobacco-related child labor, poverty and environmental destruction. The health risks of <b>tobacco</b> <b>farming</b> are {{beyond the scope of}} the study. Data on social disruption in <b>tobacco</b> <b>farming</b> was obtained through newspaper stories, published and unpublished reports, scholarly literature, documentary films, and tobacco industry publications such as annual reports and websites. The analysis shows that in all World Health Organization regions (Eastern Mediterranean, Africa, Europe, the Americas, South East Asia and Western Pacific) <b>tobacco</b> <b>farming</b> involves child labor and deforestation as well as tobacco industry behaviour promoting disruption in social and environmental life in <b>tobacco</b> <b>farming</b> communities. <b>Tobacco</b> companies generate huge externalities forcing farmers and consumers to pay the costs and concealing the actual cost of tobacco leaf and other tobacco products.

25|$|FLOC began {{organizing}} cucumber pickers and pickle processing {{workers in}} North Carolina {{in the early}} 1990s. The union's efforts had made little headway by the mid-1990s, however. In October 1998, FLOC announced a boycott of Mount Olive Pickle Company, the major pickle processor in the state. The union targeted the pickle processor because it correctly believed that growers would not agree to raise wages unless Mount Olive agreed {{to pay more for}} cucumbers. The organizing campaign was a difficult one. Four FLOC organizers were arrested on August 12, 1998 after visiting workers at a <b>tobacco</b> <b>farm</b> in Nash County, North Carolina. A local judge threw out the charges, saying the organizers had broken no laws.|$|E

40|$|We {{examine the}} distortionary effects of {{agricultural}} policy on farm productivity {{by examining the}} response of U. S. tobacco farmers' productivity to the quota buyout of 2004. We isolate the impact of distortionary policy, i. e., the tobacco quota, by decomposing aggregate productivity growth into the contribution of farm-level productivity growth and the contribution of reallocation of resources among tobacco growers. Reallocation of resources includes entry into and exit from <b>tobacco</b> <b>farming,</b> as well as growth or decline of the resources allocated to existing <b>tobacco</b> <b>farms.</b> We find that aggregate productivity of Kentucky <b>tobacco</b> <b>farms</b> grew 37 % between 2002 and 2007. Reallocation of resources among continuing <b>tobacco</b> <b>farms</b> contributed 22 percentage points to productivity growth. Reallocation through entry and exit contributed 10 percentage points, {{and the elimination of}} quota rental costs directly contributed 5 percentage points.

2500|$|John Ross {{was the son}} of a Cherokee {{mother and}} a Scottish father. His mother and {{maternal}} grandmother were of mixed Scots-Cherokee ancestry, since his maternal grandfather was another Scottish immigrant. As a result, young John (one-eighth Cherokee by blood quantum) grew up bilingual and bicultural, an experience that served him well when his parents decided to send him to schools that served other mixed race Cherokee. After graduation, he was appointed an Indian agent in 1811. During the War [...] of 1812, he served as adjutant of a Cherokee regiment under the command of Andrew Jackson. After the Red Stick War ended, Ross demonstrated his business acumen by starting a <b>tobacco</b> <b>farm</b> in Tennessee. In 1816, he built a warehouse and trading post on the Tennessee River north of the mouth of Chattanooga Creek, and started a ferry service that carried passengers from the south side of the river (Cherokee Nation) to the north side (USA). His businesses served as the start of a community known as Ross's Landing on the Tennessee River (now modern-day Chattanooga, Tennessee). Concurrently, John Ross developed a keen interest in Cherokee politics, attracting the attention of the Cherokee elders, especially Principal Chiefs Pathkiller and Charles R. Hicks, who, along with Major Ridge, became his political mentors.|$|E
