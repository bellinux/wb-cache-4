5|$|Bacteria can {{be grown}} in the {{laboratory}} on nutrient culture media, but viruses need living cells in which to replicate.

Millions of eggs are used each year <b>to</b> <b>generate</b> <b>the</b> annual flu vaccine requirements, a complex process that takes about {{six months after the}} decision is made as to what strains of virus to include in the new vaccine. A problem with using eggs for this purpose is that people with egg allergies are unable to be immunised, but this disadvantage may be overcome as new techniques for cell-based rather than egg-based culture become available. Cell-based culture will also be useful in a pandemic when {{it may be difficult to}} acquire a sufficiently large quantity of suitable sterile, fertile eggs.|$|E
5|$|Construction began before {{completion}} of the design for the gaseous diffusion process. Due to {{the large amount of}} electric power that the K-25 plant was expected to consume, it was decided to provide it with its own electric power plant. While the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) believed that it could supply the Clinton Engineer Works' needs, there was unease about relying on a single supplier when a power failure could cost the gaseous diffusion plant weeks of work, and the lines to TVA could be sabotaged. A local plant was more secure.

5|$|In {{the case}} of a driven wheel, a torque must be applied <b>to</b> <b>generate</b> <b>the</b> {{locomotive}} force. In human technology, this torque is generally provided by a motor, of which there are many types, including electric, piston-driven, turbine-driven, pneumatic, and hydraulic. (Torque may also be provided by human power, as in {{the case of}} a bicycle.) In animals, motion is typically achieved by the use of skeletal muscles, which derive their energy from the metabolism of nutrients from food. Because these muscles are attached to both of the components that must move relative to each other, they are not capable of directly driving a wheel. In addition, large animals cannot produce high accelerations, as inertia increases rapidly with body size.|$|E
5|$|Trafford Park {{is almost}} entirely {{surrounded}} by water; the Bridgewater Canal forms its southeastern and southwestern boundaries, and the Manchester Ship Canal, which opened in 1894, its northeastern and northwestern boundaries. Hooley's plan was to develop the Ship Canal frontage, but the canal was slow <b>to</b> <b>generate</b> <b>the</b> predicted volume of traffic, so {{in the early days}} the park was largely used for leisure activities such as golf, polo and boating. British Westinghouse was the first major company to move in, and by 1903 it was employing about half of the 12,000workers then employed in the park, which {{became one of the most}} important engineering facilities in Britain.|$|E
5|$|Roguelike-likes are {{generally}} much shorter games {{intended to be}} winnable within a single gaming session, in contrast to traditional roguelikes that are designed for multiple sessions of gameplay. Associated with their short length, many roguelike-likes feature a metagame, whereby achieving certain goals will unlock features {{such as the ability}} to select a new character {{at the start of the}} game or the addition of new items and monsters in the procedural generation of the game's levels. Several roguelike-likes feature daily challenges, in which a preset random seed is used <b>to</b> <b>generate</b> <b>the</b> game's levels in a deterministic fashion so that each player will have the same encounters; players attempt to complete the game through those levels or otherwise get the highest score through online leaderboards.

5|$|The {{mechanism}} by which the RITS complex induces heterochromatin formation and organization is not well understood. Most {{studies have focused on}} the mating-type region in fission yeast, which may not be representative of activities in other genomic regions/organisms. In maintenance of existing heterochromatin regions, RITS forms a complex with siRNAs complementary to the local genes and stably binds local methylated histones, acting co-transcriptionally to degrade any nascent pre-mRNA transcripts that are initiated by RNA polymerase. The formation of such a heterochromatin region, though not its maintenance, is dicer-dependent, presumably because dicer is required <b>to</b> <b>generate</b> <b>the</b> initial complement of siRNAs that target subsequent transcripts. Heterochromatin maintenance has been suggested to function as a self-reinforcing feedback loop, as new siRNAs are formed from the occasional nascent transcripts by RdRP for incorporation into local RITS complexes. The relevance of observations from fission yeast mating-type regions and centromeres to mammals is not clear, as heterochromatin maintenance in mammalian cells may be independent of the components of the RNAi pathway.|$|E
5|$|The {{oxidizer}} {{and fuel}} preburners are welded to the hot-gas manifold. The fuel and oxidizer enter the preburners and are mixed so that efficient combustion can occur. The augmented spark igniter {{is a small}} combination chamber located {{in the center of}} the injector of each preburner. The two dual-redundant spark igniters, which are activated by the engine controller, are used during the engine start sequence to initiate combustion in each preburner. They are turned off after approximately three seconds because the combustion process is then self-sustaining. The preburners produce the fuel-rich hot gases that pass through the turbines <b>to</b> <b>generate</b> <b>the</b> power needed to operate the high-pressure turbopumps. The oxidizer preburner's outflow drives a turbine that is connected to the HPOTP and to the oxidizer preburner pump. The fuel preburner's outflow drives a turbine that is connected to the HPFTP.|$|E

5|$|Yerkes {{also did}} not {{live to see the}} UERL's {{financial}} struggle during the first years after the opening of the new lines. Because of greatly over-optimistic pre-opening predictions of passenger numbers, the lines failed <b>to</b> <b>generate</b> <b>the</b> income expected and needed to fund the interest payments on the UERL's substantial borrowings. In the Bakerloo Tube's first twelve months of operation, it carried 20.5million passengers, less than sixty per cent of the 35million that had been predicted during the planning of the line. The Piccadilly Tube achieved 26million of a predicted 60million and the Hampstead Tube managed 25million of a predicted 50million. For the DR, the UERL had predicted an increase to 100million passengers after electrification, but achieved 55million. The lower than expected passenger numbers were partly due to competition between the UERL's lines and those of the other tube and sub-surface railway companies, and the further spread of electric trams and motor buses, replacing slower, horse-drawn road transport, took a large number of passengers away from the trains. The low price of tickets also depressed income.|$|E
