5|$|Campaign funding – <b>The</b> <b>ACLU</b> {{believes}} that the current system is badly flawed, and supports a system based on public funding. <b>The</b> <b>ACLU</b> supports full transparency to identify donors. However, <b>the</b> <b>ACLU</b> opposes attempts to control political spending. <b>The</b> <b>ACLU</b> supported the Supreme Court's decision in Citizens United v. FEC, which allowed corporations and unions more political speech rights.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to labor, <b>the</b> <b>ACLU</b> also led efforts in non-labor arenas, for example, promoting free speech in public schools. <b>The</b> <b>ACLU</b> itself was banned from speaking in New York {{public schools in}} 1921. <b>The</b> <b>ACLU,</b> working with the NAACP, also supported racial discrimination cases. <b>The</b> <b>ACLU</b> defended free speech regardless of the opinions being espoused. For example, the reactionary, anti-Catholic, anti-black Ku Klux Klan (KKK) was a frequent target of ACLU efforts, but <b>the</b> <b>ACLU</b> defended the KKK's right to hold meetings in 1923. There were some civil rights that <b>the</b> <b>ACLU</b> did not {{make an effort to}} defend in the 1920s, including censorship of the arts, government search and seizure issues, right to privacy, or wiretapping.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>ACLU</b> {{leadership}} was divided {{over whether or}} not to defend pro-Nazi speech in the United States; pro-labor elements within <b>the</b> <b>ACLU</b> were hostile towards Nazism and fascism, and objected when <b>the</b> <b>ACLU</b> defended Nazis. Several states passed laws outlawing the hate speech directed at ethnic groups. The first person arrested under New Jersey's 1935 hate speech law was a Jehovah's Witness who was charged with disseminating anti-Catholic literature. <b>The</b> <b>ACLU</b> defended the Jehovah's Witnesses, and the charges were dropped. <b>The</b> <b>ACLU</b> proceeded to defend numerous pro-Nazi groups, defending their rights to free speech and free association.|$|E

5|$|The Scopes {{trial was}} a phenomenal public {{relations}} success for <b>the</b> <b>ACLU.</b> <b>The</b> <b>ACLU</b> became well known across America, {{and the case}} led to the first endorsement of <b>the</b> <b>ACLU</b> by a major U.S. newspaper. <b>The</b> <b>ACLU</b> continued {{to fight for the}} separation of church and state in schoolrooms, decade after decade, including the 1982 case McLean v. Arkansas and the 2005 case Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District.|$|E
5|$|A major crisis gripped <b>the</b> <b>ACLU</b> in 1968 when {{a debate}} erupted {{over whether to}} defend Benjamin Spock and the Boston Five against federal charges that they {{encouraged}} draftees to avoid the draft. <b>The</b> <b>ACLU</b> board was deeply split over whether to defend the activists; half the board harbored anti-war sentiments, and felt that <b>the</b> <b>ACLU</b> should lend its resources {{to the cause of}} the Boston Five. The other half of the board believed that civil liberties were not at stake, and <b>the</b> <b>ACLU</b> would be taking a political stance. Behind the debate was the longstanding ACLU tradition that it was politically impartial, and provided legal advice without regard to the political views of the defendants. The board finally agreed to a compromise solution that permitted <b>the</b> <b>ACLU</b> to defend the anti-war activists, without endorsing the activist's political views. Some critics of <b>the</b> <b>ACLU</b> suggest that <b>the</b> <b>ACLU</b> became a partisan political organization following the Spock case. After the Kent State shootings in 1970, ACLU leaders took another step towards politics by passing a resolution condemning the Vietnam War. The resolution was based in a variety of legal arguments, including civil liberties violations and a claim that the war was illegal.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} 1945, <b>the</b> <b>ACLU</b> {{had taken a}} stand {{to protect the rights}} of the mentally ill, when it drafted a model statute {{governing}} mental commitments. In the 1960s, <b>the</b> <b>ACLU</b> opposed involuntary commitments, unless it could be demonstrated that the person was a danger to himself or the community. In the landmark 1975 O'Connor v. Donaldson decision <b>the</b> <b>ACLU</b> represented a non-violent mental health patient who had been confined against his will for 15 years, and persuaded the Supreme Court to rule such involuntary confinements illegal. <b>The</b> <b>ACLU</b> has also defended the rights of mentally ill individuals who are not dangerous, but who create disturbances. The New York chapter of <b>the</b> <b>ACLU</b> defended Billie Boggs, a mentally ill woman who exposed herself and defecated and urinated in public.|$|E

As well as the funding and operations described here, <b>the</b> <b>ACLU's</b> requests revealed that Matrix would perform an almost identical function to the banned TIA.

5|$|As the Watergate saga unfolded, <b>the</b> <b>ACLU</b> {{became the}} first {{national}} organization to call for Nixon's impeachment. This, following the resolution opposing the Vietnam war, was a second major decision that caused critics of <b>the</b> <b>ACLU,</b> particularly conservatives, to claim that <b>the</b> <b>ACLU</b> had evolved into a liberal political organization.|$|E
5|$|By 1964, {{membership}} {{had risen}} to 80,000, and <b>the</b> <b>ACLU</b> participated in efforts to expand civil liberties. In the 1960s, <b>the</b> <b>ACLU</b> continued its decades-long effort to enforce {{separation of church and}} state. It defended several anti-war activists during the Vietnam War. <b>The</b> <b>ACLU</b> was involved in the Miranda case, which addressed conduct by police during interrogations, and in the New York Times case, which established new protections for newspapers reporting on government activities. In the 1970s and 1980s, <b>the</b> <b>ACLU</b> ventured into new legal areas, involving the rights of homosexuals, students, prisoners, and the poor. In the twenty-first century, <b>the</b> <b>ACLU</b> has fought the teaching of creationism in public schools and challenged some provisions of anti-terrorism legislation as infringing on privacy and civil liberties. Fundraising and membership spiked after the 2016 election; the ACLU's current membership is more than 1.2 million.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 1950s, <b>the</b> <b>ACLU</b> {{continued}} to steer a moderate course through the Cold War. When leftist singer Paul Robeson was denied a passport in 1950, {{even though he}} was not accused of any illegal acts, <b>the</b> <b>ACLU</b> chose to not defend him. <b>The</b> <b>ACLU</b> later reversed their stance, and supported William Worthy and Rockwell Kent in their passport confiscation cases, which resulted in legal victories in the late 1950s.|$|E
50|$|In 2013 David Cole {{also was}} the first {{recipient}} of <b>the</b> <b>ACLU's</b> Norman Dorsen Presidential Prize for academic contributions to civil liberties.|$|R
500|$|<b>ACLU</b> {{affiliates}} are <b>the</b> {{basic unit}} of <b>the</b> <b>ACLU's</b> organization {{and engage in}} litigation, lobbying, and public education. For example, in a twenty-month period beginning January 2004, <b>the</b> <b>ACLU's</b> New Jersey chapter was involved in fifty-one cases according to their annual report—thirty-five cases in state courts, and sixteen in federal court. They provided legal representation in thirty-three of those cases, and served as amicus in the remaining eighteen. They listed forty-four volunteer attorneys who assisted them in those cases.|$|R

5|$|In 1948, <b>the</b> <b>ACLU</b> {{prevailed in}} the McCollum v. Board of Education case, which {{challenged}} public school religious classes taught by clergy paid for from private funds. <b>The</b> <b>ACLU</b> also won cases challenging schools in New Mexico which were taught by clergy and had crucifixes hanging in the classrooms. In the 1960s, <b>the</b> <b>ACLU,</b> in response to member insistence, turned its attention to in-class promotion of religion. In 1960, 42 percent of American schools included Bible reading. In 1962, <b>the</b> <b>ACLU</b> published a policy statement condemning in-school prayers, observation of religious holidays, and Bible reading. The Supreme Court concurred with the ACLU's position, when it prohibited New York's in-school prayers in the 1962 Engel v. Vitale decision. Religious factions across the country rebelled against the anti-prayer decisions, leading them to propose the School Prayer Constitutional Amendment, which declared in-school prayer legal. <b>The</b> <b>ACLU</b> participated in a lobbying effort against the amendment, and the 1966 congressional vote on the amendment failed to obtain the required two-thirds majority.|$|E
5|$|In {{the year}} ending March 31, 2014, <b>the</b> <b>ACLU</b> and <b>the</b> <b>ACLU</b> Foundation had a {{combined}} income from support and revenue of $100.4million, originating from grants (50.0%), membership donations (25.4%), donated legal services (7.6%), bequests (16.2%), and revenue (0.9%). Membership dues {{are treated as}} donations; members choose the amount they pay annually, averaging approximately $50 per member per year. In the year ending March 31, 2014, the combined expenses of <b>the</b> <b>ACLU</b> and ACLU Foundation were $133.4million, spent on programs (86.2%), management (7.4%), and fundraising (8.2%). (After factoring in other changes in net assets of +$30.9 million, from sources such as investment income, the organization had an overall decrease in net assets of $2.1 million.) Over the period from 2011 to 2014 <b>the</b> <b>ACLU</b> Foundation, on the average, has accounted for roughly 70% of the combined budget, and <b>the</b> <b>ACLU</b> roughly 30%.|$|E
5|$|It is {{the policy}} of <b>the</b> <b>ACLU</b> to support the civil liberties of {{defendants}} regardless of their ideological stance. <b>The</b> <b>ACLU</b> takes pride in defending individuals with unpopular viewpoints, such as George Wallace, George Lincoln Rockwell, and KKK members. <b>The</b> <b>ACLU</b> has defended American Nazis many times, and their actions often brought protests, particularly from American Jews.|$|E
50|$|On February 19, 2008, the U.S. Supreme Court denied <b>the</b> <b>ACLU's</b> {{petition}} for a writ of certiorari, declining {{to hear an}} appeal in the case.|$|R

5|$|Religion – <b>The</b> <b>ACLU</b> {{supports}} {{the right of}} religious persons to practice their faiths without government interference. <b>The</b> <b>ACLU</b> believes the government should neither prefer religion over non-religion, nor favor particular faiths over others. <b>The</b> <b>ACLU</b> is opposed to school-led prayer, but protects students' right to pray in school.|$|E
5|$|Rights of {{the poor}} was another area that was {{expanded}} by <b>the</b> <b>ACLU.</b> In 1966 and again in 1968, activists within <b>the</b> <b>ACLU</b> encouraged the organization to adopt a policy overhauling the welfare system, and guaranteeing low-income families a baseline income; but <b>the</b> <b>ACLU</b> board did not approve the proposals. <b>The</b> <b>ACLU</b> {{played a key role}} in the 1968 King v. Smith decision, where the Supreme Court ruled that welfare benefits for children could not be denied by a state simply because the mother cohabited with a boyfriend.|$|E
5|$|Some {{factions in}} <b>the</b> <b>ACLU</b> {{proposed}} {{new directions for}} the organization. In the late 1930s, some local affiliates proposed shifting their emphasis from civil liberties appellate actions, to becoming a legal aid society, centered on store front offices in low income neighborhoods. <b>The</b> <b>ACLU</b> directors rejected that proposal. Other ACLU members wanted <b>the</b> <b>ACLU</b> to shift focus into the political arena, and to {{be more willing to}} compromise their ideals in order to strike deals with politicians. This initiative was also rejected by <b>the</b> <b>ACLU</b> leadership.|$|E
50|$|For {{the years}} of 2005-2006, Coleman was given a 17% rating by the American Civil Liberties Union {{indicating}} a weak civil liberties record (by <b>the</b> <b>ACLU's</b> definitions).|$|R
50|$|On July 18, 2017, Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly {{rejected}} <b>the</b> <b>ACLU's</b> {{motion for}} {{a temporary restraining order}} and preliminary injunction, allowing the July 19 meeting to go on.|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>ACLU</b> is {{supported}} by a variety of persons and organizations. There were over 1,000,000 members in 2017, and <b>the</b> <b>ACLU</b> annually receives thousands of grants from hundreds of charitable foundations. Allies of <b>the</b> <b>ACLU</b> in legal actions have included the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the American Jewish Congress, People For the American Way, the National Rifle Association, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, Americans United for Separation of Church and State, and the National Organization for Women.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>ACLU</b> {{was founded}} in 1920 by Helen Keller, Roger Baldwin, Crystal Eastman, Walter Nelles, Morris Ernst, Albert DeSilver, Arthur Garfield Hays, Jane Addams, Felix Frankfurter, and Elizabeth Gurley Flynn, and its focus was on freedom of speech, {{primarily}} for anti-war protesters. During the 1920s, <b>the</b> <b>ACLU</b> expanded its scope to include protecting the free speech rights of artists and striking workers, {{and working with the}} National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) to decrease racism and discrimination. During the 1930s, <b>the</b> <b>ACLU</b> started to engage in work combating police misconduct and supporting Native American rights. Many of the ACLU's cases involved the defense of Communist party members and Jehovah's Witnesses. In 1940, <b>the</b> <b>ACLU</b> leadership voted to exclude Communists from its leadership positions, a decision rescinded in 1968. During World War II, <b>the</b> <b>ACLU</b> defended Japanese-American citizens, unsuccessfully trying to prevent their forcible relocation to internment camps. During the Cold War, <b>the</b> <b>ACLU</b> headquarters was dominated by anti-Communists, but many local affiliates defended members of the Communist Party.|$|E
5|$|The Communist Party USA was {{routinely}} harassed and {{oppressed by}} government officials, leading {{it to be}} the primary client of <b>the</b> <b>ACLU.</b> The Communists were very aggressive in their tactics, often engaging in illegal or unethical conduct, and this led to frequent conflicts between the Communists and ACLU. Communist leaders often attacked <b>the</b> <b>ACLU,</b> particularly when <b>the</b> <b>ACLU</b> defended the free speech rights of conservatives. This uneasy relationship between the two groups continued for decades.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>ACLU's</b> {{case for}} Braverman made {{national}} news on January 15, 1974 when filed. [...] The case continued to attract national attention during that year. [...] John F. King served as Braverman's counsel.|$|R

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>ACLU's</b> New Jersey chapter {{has also}} made open {{government}} a priority. In 2009, the ACLU-NJ announced the Open Governance Project, an initiative dedicated to government transparency and ease of access to government meetings and documentation.|$|R
