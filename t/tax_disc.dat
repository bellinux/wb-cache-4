25|$|Motor tax, {{payable to}} the local council where the owner lives, arises when a car or other motor vehicle is used on a public road. A {{circular}} receipt, known colloquially as a <b>tax</b> <b>disc,</b> is issued on payment and must be displayed {{in the front of}} the vehicle. Certain vehicles, including state-owned vehicles, fire engines, and vehicles for disabled drivers are exempt from motor tax.|$|E

During the search, his mother Cynthia Jarrett collapsed and died. It has never been satisfactorily concluded how and why Cynthia Jarrett died, and whether it was a heart attack or due to police actions.|$|E

25|$|In December 1960, {{after its}} last <b>tax</b> <b>disc</b> expired, Dr. Carr stored the Bugatti {{along with other}} classic cars in a lock up garage in Gosforth, Newcastle upon Tyne. There it {{remained}} unused and untouched until after Carr's death, when it was discovered by Carr's nephew clearing the garage of his uncle's possessions in 2008. 57502 still possessed its original chassis, engine, drive train and body, though it did contain some modifications: bespoke bumpers, rear-view mirrors on the A-pillars, and a luggage rack dating from the Earl Howe ownership, {{as well as a}} Marshall K200 supercharger fitted by a later owner.|$|E
25|$|Three months later, {{the couple}} vacated the Cheltenham flat and {{relocated}} {{to the ground}} floor flat of a two-storey house in Midland Road, Gloucester. On 17 October 1970, Rose gave birth to their first child: a daughter they named Heather Ann (although speculation remains Heather may have been sired by Rose's own father). Two months later, Fred was imprisoned for the theft of car tyres and a vehicle <b>tax</b> <b>disc.</b> He would remain imprisoned until 24 June 1971. As he served this six-and-a-half-month sentence, Rose, having just turned 17, looked after the three girls, with both Charmaine and Anna Marie being informed to refer to Rose as their mother.|$|E
2500|$|Vehicle Excise Duty, also {{commonly}} known as 'VED', 'vehicle tax', 'car tax' and 'road tax', is a vehicle road use tax levied as an excise duty which must be paid for most types of vehicle which are to be used (or parked) on the public roads in the United Kingdom. Motor vehicles used on public roads {{no longer need to}} display a current vehicle licence (<b>tax</b> <b>disc)</b> as proof of payment which will not be issued without prior proof that the vehicle has valid MOT and insurance. [...] A 'Statutory Off Road Notification (SORN)' must be made for a registered vehicle that is not being used on the road, and which has been taxed since 31 January 1998.|$|E

2500|$|The MOT {{test was}} first {{introduced}} in 1960 {{under the direction of}} the Minister of Transport, Ernest Marples, under powers in the Road Traffic Act 1956. The test was originally a basic test including brakes, lights and steering check which was to be carried out after the vehicle was ten years old and every year thereafter. This became known as the [...] "ten year test", or alternatively the [...] "Ministry of Transport Test". The high failure rate resulted in the age that vehicles became due for testing being reduced to seven years on 31 December 1961. In 1962, the first commercial vehicle exam was created and a valid certificate was required in order to receive a <b>tax</b> <b>disc,</b> and in April 1967 the testable age for an MOT was reduced to three years. On 1 January 1983 the testable age for ambulances, taxis and vehicles with more than eight passenger seats, excluding the driver's, was reduced to one year.|$|E

50|$|Motor tax can be {{purchased}} for a duration of three, six or twelve months for some classes of vehicles. Valid vehicle insurance is required to pay for motor tax. Once tax is paid, the vehicle owner receives a motor <b>tax</b> <b>disc</b> which is required by law be displayed on the vehicle (usually on the front windscreen where available, along with insurance and NCT discs where required). Failure to display a <b>tax</b> <b>disc</b> {{can result in a}} fine, and failure to pay for motor tax can result in further fines or prosecution.|$|E

5000|$|Insurer, and Vehicle Excise Duty (VED) / licence data, {{are shared}} by the {{relevant}} authorities including the Police and this forms {{an integral part of}} the mechanism of CIE. All UK registered vehicles, including those that are exempt from VED (for example, Historic Vehicles and cars with low or zero emissions) are subject to the VED taxation application process. Part of this is a check on the vehicle's insurance. A physical receipt for the payment of VED was issued by way of a paper disc which, prior to 1 October 2014, meant that all motorists in the UK were required to prominently display the <b>tax</b> <b>disc</b> on their vehicle when it was kept or driven on public roads. This helped to ensure that most people had adequate insurance on their vehicles because insurance cover was required to purchase a disc, although the insurance must merely have been valid at the time of purchase and not necessarily for the life of the <b>tax</b> <b>disc.</b> [...] To address the problems that arise where a vehicle's insurance was subsequently cancelled but the <b>tax</b> <b>disc</b> remained in force and displayed on the vehicle and the vehicle then used without insurance, the CIE regulations are now able to be applied as the Driver & Vehicle Licence Authority (DVLA) and the MID databases are shared in real-time meaning that a taxed but uninsured vehicle is easily detectable by both authorities and Traffic Police. Post 1 October 2014 it is no longer a requirement to display a vehicle excise licence (<b>tax</b> <b>disc)</b> on a vehicle. This has come about because the whole VED process can now be administered electronically and alongside the MID, doing away with the expense, to the UK Government, of issuing paper discs.|$|E
50|$|Until 1 October 2014 {{a vehicle}} licence (<b>tax</b> <b>disc)</b> {{had to be}} {{displayed}} on a vehicle as evidence of having paid the duty.

25|$|Until 1973, driving {{licences}} (and <b>tax</b> <b>discs)</b> were issued by {{local authorities and}} had to be renewed every three years.

50|$|In 2004, Tyler {{started a}} {{campaign}} to stop government departments and agencies making citizens access their services via high-rate “0870” phone numbers.

5000|$|The {{series is}} set in 1991 and 1992, which was then the near future from when it was made (1988), with a King as the British monarch (the royal cypher {{on one of the}} Prime Minister's red boxes is shown as [...] "C III R," [...] {{suggesting}} that the monarch is Charles III, the current Prince of Wales), multiple cable and satellite television channels, and other similar details.

40|$|The {{application}} of the National Traffic Growth Forecasts published in 1989 to concurrently published vehicle ownership figures produces a projected total of a possible 35 million vehicles on the UK's roads by the year 2025. This projection, compounded by strong evidence of increasing vehicle usage, implies increased levels of congestion and, in all probability, increasing levels of greenhouse gas emissions. Despite this prognosis the Government has fallen a long way short of committing itself to strong traffic management policies, such as the introduction of road pricing and significant increases in fuel duties. Whilst acknowledging the potential role of such measures, this paper seeks to consider whether the concept of tradable pollution permits, which, increasingly, are {{being used in the}} USA to limit emissions from fixed points, can have any application to reducing levels of car ownership, and hence congestion and pollution. It suggests that car licence <b>tax</b> <b>discs,</b> obtained through the payment of Vehicle Excise Duty, should be limited in number and auctioned on the free market, with the total number in circulation being reduced on a continual basis. The monies raised from these auctions would be recycled for investment in public transport {{in order to reduce the}} inevitable hardship that would result from people being denied access to car ownership. It is concluded that, whilst such an initiative would be politically unpopular, it would necessarily succeed in halting the upward spiral of car ownership, congestion and pollution, and would, given the appropriate political response, act as a strong imperative for governments to refocus their policies on public transport. ...|$|R
5000|$|Mechanism for benefit: A DISC {{contracts}} with a producer or reseller of U.S. made goods or provider of certain qualifying construction-related services to provide [...] "services" [...] to such related supplier for a fee.

[...] Under these regulations, the fee is deductible by the related supplier and results in a specified net profit to the DISC. This net profit {{is not subject to}} Federal income <b>tax.</b> The <b>DISC</b> then distributes the profit to its shareholders, who are taxable on the income as a qualified dividend. [...] If the shareholders are U.S. resident individuals or others eligible for the reduced rate of tax (now between 0% and 20%, depending on ordinary income level) on qualified dividends, then the tax rate on the income allocated to the DISC is reduced.|$|R
