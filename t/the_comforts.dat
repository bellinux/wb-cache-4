5|$|Denied {{the use of}} compulsion, Chamberlain had {{to persuade}} Britons to {{volunteer}} for essential war work, and fit young workers to leave the factories and enter the Army. He had to address mass meetings and issue posters. He found that workers were reluctant to exchange <b>the</b> <b>comforts</b> of home and wartime salaries for the uncertainties of the trenches and a wage of one shilling a day. Chamberlain had little confidence in voluntary schemes and they indeed proved unsuccessful, with only 9,000workers freed to be drafted into the Army {{at a time when}} Britain was sustaining huge casualties.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} thirty, Mahavira {{abandoned}} <b>the</b> <b>comforts</b> {{of royal}} life and left his home and family to live an ascetic life {{in the pursuit of}} spiritual awakening. He undertook severe austerities of fasting and bodily mortifications, meditated under the Ashoka tree, and discarded his clothes. There is a graphic description of his hardships and humiliation in the Acharanga Sutra. According to the Kalpa Sūtra, Mahavira spent the first forty-two monsoons of his life at Astikagrama, Champapuri, Prstichampa, Vaishali, Vanijagrama, Nalanda, Mithila, Bhadrika, Alabhika, Panitabhumi, Shravasti, and Pawapuri. He is said to have lived in Rajagriha during the rainy season of the forty-first year of his ascetic life. This is traditionally dated to have been in 491BC.|$|E
5|$|During {{the later}} 19th century, the major {{shipping}} lines financed Swedish emigrant agents {{and paid for}} the production of large quantities of emigration propaganda. Much of this promotional material, such as leaflets, was produced by immigration promoters in the U.S. Propaganda and advertising by shipping line agents was often blamed for emigration by the conservative Swedish ruling class, which grew increasingly alarmed at seeing the agricultural labor force leave the country. It was a Swedish 19th-century cliché to blame the falling ticket prices and the pro-emigration propaganda of the transport system for the craze of emigration, but modern historians have varying views about the real importance of such factors. Brattne and Åkerman have examined the advertising campaigns and the ticket prices as a possible third force between push and pull. They conclude that neither advertisements nor pricing had any decisive influence on Swedish emigration. While the companies remain unwilling, , to open their archives to researchers, the limited sources available suggest that ticket prices did drop in the 1880s, but remained on average artificially high because of cartels and price-fixing. On the other hand, H. A. Barton states that the cost of crossing the Atlantic dropped drastically between 1865 and 1890, encouraging poorer Swedes to emigrate. The research of Brattne and Åkerman has shown that the leaflets sent out by the shipping line agents to prospective emigrants would not so much celebrate conditions in the New World, as simply emphasize <b>the</b> <b>comforts</b> and advantages of the particular company. Descriptions of life in America were unvarnished, and the general advice to emigrants brief and factual. Newspaper advertising, while very common, tended to be repetitive and stereotyped in content.|$|E

He was however cheered by the attention showered on him by the citizens of Naples, the prestige accorded him by the kingdom's elite, and <b>the</b> <b>comforts</b> he received at the Hamiltons' residence. He made frequent visits to attend functions in his honour, or to tour nearby attractions with Emma, with whom he had by now fallen deeply in love, almost constantly at his side. Orders arrived from the Admiralty to blockade the French forces in Alexandria and Malta, a task Nelson delegated to his captains, Samuel Hood and Alexander Ball. Despite enjoying his lifestyle in Naples, Nelson began to think of returning to England, but King Ferdinand of Naples, after a long period of pressure from his wife Maria Carolina of Austria and Sir William Hamilton, finally agreed to declare war on France. The Neapolitan army, led by the Austrian General Mack and supported by Nelson's fleet, retook Rome from the French in late November, but the French regrouped outside the city and, after being reinforced, routed the Neapolitans. In disarray, the Neapolitan army fled back to Naples, with the pursuing French close behind. Nelson hastily organised the evacuation of the Royal Family, several nobles and the British nationals, including the Hamiltons. The evacuation got under way on 23 December and sailed through heavy gales before reaching the safety of Palermo on 26 December.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To compare {{pain and}} {{sedation}} assessments by nurses undertaken with the Objective Pain Scale (OPS) and a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) {{to the current}} reference scale for paediatric intensive care that is <b>the</b> <b>COMFORT</b> scale. To compare <b>the</b> unmodified <b>COMFORT</b> scale to a COMFORT "behaviour" scale which does not include physiologic items. To evaluate the ease of use of these scales. METHODS: This prospective observational comparative study {{was carried out in}} children aged 1 year or older who were admitted in an intensive care unit. At 2 to 3 time points within 24 hours, a pain sedation assessment was carried out by the nurse in charge of <b>the</b> child with <b>COMFORT</b> scale, OPS and VAS. Correlation tests were used to compare the scores of each scale. RESULTS: Nurses recorded 55 assessments in 20 children. Correlation studies showed a poor correlation between OPS, VAS and <b>the</b> <b>COMFORT</b> scale (Spearman's r= 0. 54 and 0. 53 respectively) and a strong correlation between <b>the</b> <b>COMFORT</b> scale and <b>the</b> <b>COMFORT</b> "behaviour" scale (Spearman's r= 0. 96). <b>The</b> <b>COMFORT</b> behaviour scale was the most frequently fully completed scale.

For negative disparity, we cannot directly follow <b>the</b> <b>comfort</b> zone model [20] to design our <b>comfort</b> value. <b>The</b> {{reason for this is that}} there is a conflict between the pop-out effect and comfort zone. If we directly use <b>the</b> <b>comfort</b> zone model [20] to measure saliency, in some cases, stereo contrast model and stereo focus model may give quite different results for an object with negative disparity, which will reduce the performance our proposed model. For example, if the pixel has a large negative disparity and is far from <b>the</b> <b>comfort</b> value, its pop-out value becomes big, and its comfort value is small. After the fusion of two models, the results may be not reliable. To reduce the errors caused by such conflicts, we increase the importance of the negative disparity in <b>the</b> <b>comfort</b> zone by using α to balance <b>the</b> <b>comfort</b> value of <b>the</b> negative disparity. There are two benefits in this modification. Firstly, this modification increases the importance of the pop-out effect for the object with the negative disparity. Secondly, it still keeps a high importance for the object in <b>the</b> <b>comfort</b> zone in stereoscopic saliency analysis. According to our experiments, our modification for <b>the</b> <b>comfort</b> zone works in most cases and improves the performance of the proposed model.|$|R

25|$|Yet, on the whole, {{it was an}} {{agricultural}} society without skill or resources. It committed all those sins which characterize a wasteful and ignorant husbandry. Grass seed was not sown for hay {{and as a result}} the farm animals had to forage for themselves in the forests; the fields were not permitted to lie in pasturage; a single crop was planted in the soil until the land was exhausted; the manure was not returned to the fields; {{only a small part of}} the farm was brought under cultivation, the rest being permitted to stand in timber. Instruments of cultivation were rude and clumsy and only too few, many of them being made on the farm. It is plain why the American frontier settler was on the move continually. It was, not his fear of a too close contact with <b>the</b> <b>comforts</b> and restraints of a civilized society that stirred him into a ceaseless activity, nor merely the chance of selling out at a profit to the coming wave of settlers; it was his wasting land that drove him on. Hunger was the goad. The pioneer farmer's ignorance, his inadequate facilities for cultivation, his limited means, of transport necessitated his frequent changes of scene. He could succeed only with virgin soil.|$|E
25|$|In 1865, Ward {{relocated}} to Chicago, {{where he worked}} for Case and Sobin, a lamp house. He traveled for them as salesman, and sold goods on commission for a short time. Chicago {{was the center of}} the wholesale dry-goods trade, and in the 1860s Ward joined the leading dry-goods house, Field Palmer & Leiter, forerunner of Marshall Field & Co. He worked for Field for two years and then joined the wholesale dry-goods business of Wills, Greg & Co. In tedious rounds of train trips to southern communities, hiring rigs at the local stables, driving out to the crossroads stores and listening to the complaints of the back-country proprietors and their rural customers, he conceived a new merchandising technique: direct mail sales to country people. It was a time when rural consumers longed for <b>the</b> <b>comforts</b> of the city, yet all too often were victimized by monopolists and overcharged by the costs of many middlemen required to bring manufactured products to the countryside. The quality of merchandise also was suspect and the hapless farmer had no recourse in a caveat emptor economy. Ward shaped a plan to buy goods at low cost for cash. By eliminating intermediaries, with their markups and commissions, and drastically cutting selling costs, he could sell goods to people, however remote, at appealing prices. He invited them to send their orders by mail and he delivered the purchases to their nearest railroad station. The only thing he lacked was capital.|$|E
