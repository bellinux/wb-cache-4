500|$|Reacting more negatively, Stephen Whitty of The Star-Ledger {{found the}} film [...] "slickly enjoyable" [...] {{for the visual}} effects, but said, [...] "here's {{something}} empty about the film. Like Tony's suits, it's shiny and polished. But this time, there's nobody inside... This movie has neither the emotionalism of the first film, nor the flashy villains of the second... Tony's relationship with girlfriend Pepper Potts is in inexplicable jeopardy—and then simply fixes itself. A supposedly cute kid sidekick—a true sign of authorial desperation—is introduced, and then dropped." [...] Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune echoed this, saying, [...] "n a gleefully cynical bid for a preteen audience (a few years too young for the violence in Iron Man 3, I'd say), Stark befriends a bullied 8-year-old [...] (Ty Simpkins) who becomes his <b>tag-along</b> and sometime savior... Stark no longer {{needs to be in}} the Iron Man suit. He's able to operate the thing remotely when needed. The movie's like that too. It's decent superhero blockbustering, but rather remote and vaguely secondhand. At this point, even with Black's flashes of black humor, the machinery is more or less taking care of itself, offering roughly half of the genial wit and enjoyment of the first Iron Man." ...|$|E
500|$|Horner's ruse of {{impotence}} {{is a great}} success, and he has {{sex with}} many ladies of virtuous reputation, mostly the wives and daughters of citizens or [...] "cits", i.e. upwardly mobile businessmen and entrepreneurs of the City of London, {{as opposed to the}} Town, the aristocratic quarters where Horner and his friends live. Three such ladies appear on stage, usually together: Lady Fidget, her sister-in-law Mrs Dainty Fidget, and her <b>tag-along</b> friend Mrs Squeamish names that convey both a delicate sensitivity about the jewel of reputation, and a certain fidgety physical unease or tickle and the dialogue gives an indefinite impression of many more. The play is structured as a farce, driven by Horner's secret and by a succession of near-discoveries of the truth, from which he extricates himself by aplomb and good luck. A final hair-raising threat of exposure comes in the last scene, through the well-meaning frankness of the young country wife Margery Pinchwife. Margery is indignant at the accusations of impotence directed at [...] "poor dear Mr. Horner", which she knows from personal experience to be untrue, and is intent on saying so at the traditional end-of-the-play public gathering of the entire cast. In a final trickster masterpiece, Horner averts the danger, joining forces with his more sophisticated lovers to persuade the jealous Pinchwife to at least pretend to believe Horner impotent and his own wife still innocent. Horner never becomes a reformed character but is assumed to go on reaping the fruits of his planted misinformation, past the last act and beyond.|$|E
500|$|Pinto {{had four}} {{releases}} in 2011. The {{first was the}} science fiction film Rise of the Planet of the Apes, a reboot of the Planet of the Apes series. She {{played the role of}} Caroline Aranha, a primatologist who falls in love with the main character, played by James Franco. To prepare for her role, she researched the career of English anthropologist Jane Goodall. The film went on to gross [...] million worldwide; it remains her highest-grossing film as of April 2016. Pinto's character received criticism for being too one-dimensional: Anthony Quinn of The Independent called it a [...] "failure", and Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter described the character as the most [...] "boringly decorous <b>tag-along</b> girlfriend seen onscreen in years." [...] Pinto's second screen appearance of the year was playing the title character in Michael Winterbottom's Trishna. The film, based on Thomas Hardy's novel Tess of the d'Urbervilles, gave Pinto the role of a teenage Rajasthani peasant, who leaves her family to work for a British-born Indian hotelier, played by Riz Ahmed. It premiered at the 2011 Toronto International Film Festival and gained a mixed response from critics. Nishat Bari of India Today called Pinto's role her [...] "most substantial" [...] one to that point. Philip French of The Guardian stated that Pinto [...] "captivates" [...] in the lead role, while Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times called her performance [...] "touchingly beautiful". In contrast, Manohla Dargis of The New York Times wrote that Pinto is [...] "one of [...] loveliest attractions, but she and her director haven't been able to give Trishna a pulse".|$|E
50|$|In August 2012, Bandsintown {{released}} {{the results of}} a survey it commissioned from the Insight Strategy Group that examined the behavior of online music fans. The survey was completed by 1,800 music fans ages 16-59 who were active Internet users and had paid to see live music in the previous year. The results divided live music fans into five groups (Super Fans, Plugged-Indies, Soloists, Dedicated Diehards, and <b>Tag-Alongs)</b> and found that the most influential groups, Super Fans and Plugged-Indies, are also the most engaged with social media, often visiting Facebook more than once per day and most likely to post about the shows they attend. They also prefer to receive “push” notifications, such as Facebook posts and email blasts about upcoming shows, rather than “pull” notifications from artist or event websites that they need to search out themselves.|$|R
40|$|Excerpt] For {{several weeks}} {{in the summer of}} 2012 the University of Virginia became the center of {{national}} media attention in America because of the forced resignation of the university’s first female president. Teresa Sullivan, a highly reputable academic administrator, had been hired as president in 2010 with a 5 year contract by the unanimous decision of the Board of Visitors, UVA’s formal leadership body. Yet on June 8, 2012 the Board of Visitors forced Sullivan to resign from her position as president by a vote of 15 to 1 —without any warning or prior indication of dissatisfaction. The firing of an elite public university president without warning was unprecedented and the shock of this decision was exacerbated by the Board’s initial statement which failed to indicate any specific reasons other than “philosophical difference[s]”. 1 In the weeks that followed, an intense backlash led by faculty and students demanded Sullivan’s reinstatement and led the Board to unanimously rehire Sullivan on June 26. The incredible speed of these events leads to a salient question: how and why did the Board so drastically change their minds on such an important decision in less than three weeks? I will analyze the events of the UVA presidential crisis through the lens of coalition theory to show how the interactions between core members, players, and <b>tag-alongs</b> in the Board, faculty, and students rapidly dissolved one set of coalitions to form a new one in response to the crisis...|$|R
2500|$|After King of the Ring, Austin {{was left}} without a feud as Benoit was lost {{for the next year}} after neck surgery and Jericho moved on to other things. He began a small spat with Angle over who was McMahon's biggest supporter. Meanwhile, the {{purchase}} of World Championship Wrestling (WCW) by McMahon began to bear fruit as The Invasion began. McMahon was not able to fight off the invading WCW wrestlers, and when they formed an alliance with a group of Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) alumni that were signed to the WWF and both Shane and Stephanie McMahon were now aligned against their father, McMahon's empire began to crumble and he had zero help from his two biggest stars at the time. Austin made it known that he was against teaming with Angle, whom Austin saw as both a threat to his WWF Championship, as well as an annoying <b>tag-along.</b> Finally, a frustrated McMahon called Austin out and demanded that he bring [...] "the old Stone Cold" [...] back, even going as far as asking Austin to give him a Stone Cold Stunner, so he could effectively captain a team of WWF wrestlers in a ten-man tag team match at the upcoming InVasion pay-per-view in July. A dejected Austin initially refused, but on the following episode of Raw Is War he returned to his old ways and hit Stunners on every member of the Alliance, turning face again. At InVasion, Austin captained the WWF team consisting of himself, Angle, Jericho, and The Undertaker and Kane against the team of WCW's Booker T and Diamond Dallas Page and ECW's Rhyno and The Dudley Boyz. Late in the match, however, as Angle had Booker in the ankle lock, Austin turned on Angle by Stunning him and joined the Alliance, turning Austin heel once again. The reason why Austin did this was that he felt McMahon was grooming Angle to take over his spot, {{that he was trying to}} get in touch with The Rock to return, and that he himself was [...] "unappreciated" [...] when McMahon insisted he return to the old Austin. Austin was immediately made the Alliance's new leader and began to feud with Angle over his WWF Championship. Also, at August, Austin would begin his [...] "What?" [...] catchphrase, which he would say randomly while giving a promo. The catchphrase eventually would start to become popular towards the end of the Invasion, and is still used by fans to this day.|$|E
