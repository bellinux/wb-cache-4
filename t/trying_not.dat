5|$|Meanwhile, Black Hawk {{learned that}} the Ho-Chunk and Potawatomi tribes were less {{supportive}} than anticipated. As in other tribes, different bands of these tribes often pursued different policies. The Ho-Chunks who lived along the Rock River in Illinois had family ties to the Sauks; they cautiously supported the British Band while <b>trying</b> <b>not</b> to provoke the Americans. Ho-Chunks in Wisconsin were more divided. Some bands, remembering their loss to the Americans in the 1827 Winnebago War, decided to stay clear of the conflict. Other Ho-Chunks with ties to the Dakotas and Menominees, most notably Waukon Decorah and his brothers, were eager {{to fight against the}} British Band.|$|E

They then confront Apu {{and he says he}} will break up with the Squishee Lady named Annette. However, he breaks his promise (as it gets his mind off the octuplets and she forces him). Later, Manjula watches the surveillance footage of Apu cheating and kicks him out. To help get them together, Homer and Marge invite them both to dinner, but do not tell them that the other one is coming. After a failed attempt with Bart and Lisa, Apu tries to promise to Manjula that he will change, but Manjula refuses to listen and demands a divorce.|$|E
5|$|Sing's {{reputation}} {{resulted in}} a champion Turkish sniper, nicknamed 'Abdul the Terrible' by the Allied side, being assigned to deal with him. Tate alleges that the Turks were largely able to distinguish Sing's sniping from that of other ANZAC soldiers, and that only the reports of incidents believed to be Sing's work were passed on to Abdul. Through analysis of the victims' actions and wounds, Abdul concluded that Sing's position was at Chatham's Post. After several days, Sing's spotter alerted him to a potential target, and he took aim, {{only to find the}} target—Abdul—looking in his direction. Sing prepared to fire, <b>trying</b> <b>not</b> to reveal his position, but the Turkish sniper noticed him and began his own firing sequence. Sing fired first and killed Abdul. Very shortly thereafter, the Turkish artillery fired on Sing's position—he and his spotter barely managed to evacuate from Chatham's Post alive.|$|E

25|$|Another theory suggests, that Päts {{knew of the}} outbreaking {{war between}} Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union and was only {{looking for a way}} for Estonia to survive the short period in between. It is {{suggested}} that Päts knew of the difficulty of the situation and tried to keep Estonians as safe as possible by avoiding war with the Soviets and buying time. While <b>trying</b> <b>not</b> to give the Soviet Union a chance to punish the Estonians, he also continuously postponed the mobilization, which eventually never even took place, unlike in Latvia and Lithuania in 1939–1940. Under international law a war would have invalidated the Tartu Peace Treaty. As a lawyer, he also had to understand that his decisions were not valid when forced by an occupying power.|$|E
25|$|The Superman of pre-Crisis Earth-17 was the {{original}} Overman, created by the government as were the other heroes of this Earth. Likewise, all other heroes that were created were modified clones of Overman's cell scrapings, such as versions of Wonder Woman, Flash, and Green Lantern. Some time later, Overman went on a homicidal rampage (due to an STD which had affected his mind) and murdered everyone on the planet before he decided to commit suicide and destroy the planet {{at the same time}} with a doomsday bomb. This world was destroyed, and Overman was wiped out by the Crisis, until the Psycho-Pirate began bringing back characters which the Crisis had killed in Animal Man #23, Overman and bomb included, despite <b>trying</b> <b>not</b> to remember him. Overman fought against Ultraman and Animal Man, before Overman was dragged out of the comic book panels and wiped out by a closing panel, ranting that it wasn't his fault he was like that before Animal Man disarmed the bomb. In The New 52 DC Multiverse, Earth-17 is the world of the Atomic Knights and lacks a known Superman analogue.|$|E

500|$|McIntee praises Alien as [...] "possibly the {{definitive}} combination of horror thriller with science fiction trappings." [...] He notes, however, {{that it is}} a horror film first and a science fiction film second, since science fiction normally explores issues of how humanity will develop under other circumstances. Alien, on the other hand, focuses on the plight of people being attacked by a monster: [...] "It's set on a spaceship in the future, but it's about people <b>trying</b> <b>not</b> to get eaten by a drooling monstrous animal. Worse, it's about them <b>trying</b> <b>not</b> to get raped by said drooling monstrous animal." [...] Along with Halloween and Friday the 13th (1980), he describes it as a prototype for the slasher film genre: [...] "The reason it's such a good movie, and wowed both the critics, who normally frown on the genre, and the casual cinema-goer, is {{that it is a}} distillation of everything that scares us in the movies." [...] He also describes how the film appeals to a variety of audiences: [...] "Fans of Hitchcockian thrillers like it because it's moody and dark. Gorehounds like it for the chest-burster. Science fiction fans love the hard science fiction trappings and hardware. Men love the battle-for-survival element, and women love not being cast as the helpless victim." ...|$|E
500|$|Confessions on a Dance Floor merged {{elements}} from 1970s disco, 1980s electropop and modern day club music.

The songs reflected Madonna's thoughts on love, fame and religion, hence the title Confessions on a Dance Floor. It was the complete opposite direction from her previous studio effort American Life (2003). The songs on that album were a form of diatribe directed at the American society.

Sanneh notes that the album is [...] "the sound of a blown-up band <b>trying</b> <b>not</b> to deflate" [...] and [...] "a surprising number of songs here just never take flight".

[...] At the time, Kaplan also explained that the lyrics used to come last: [...] "What will really happen is somebody will start playing and we'll all fall in and play for a long time. We'll finish playing an hour later and kinda say, 'Oh, do you remember what you did?' Then we'll write something down—or maybe we won't." ...|$|E

The change in style was largely adopted so they could challenge themselves musically, but not specifically to be heavier: [...] "I don't think we go in wanting to write a heavier record," [...] guitarist Dan Watchorn stated. [...] "I don't think we have a preconceived notion of what we want, the riffs and melodies just kind of come.

500|$|Starkiller was {{designed}} as Luke Skywalker's photo-negative, and is named after [...] "Annikin Starkiller" [...] (Luke Skywalker's original name in the early Star Wars scripts).

The developers also wanted to avoid making Starkiller seem irredeemably evil, and used elements of his backstory and his relationships with other characters to balance it, while <b>trying</b> <b>not</b> to explain too much of his backstory. In {{order to avoid the}} character being over emotional, they tried to let short pieces of dialogue and looks carry scenes so that the player could interpret how Starkiller felt. They attempted to make Starkiller feel like he would belong in the classic Star Wars trilogy by making his actions faster and more intense. During an interview to Haden Blackman by The Guardian, he claimed that most of the testing players wanted the character to be ultimately redeemed {{by the end of the}} game.|$|E

The bear is often privy to Mr. Bean's various schemes and doubles as a tool or other items in emergencies; it has been decapitated ("Mr. Bean in Room 426"), used as his paint brush ("Do-It-Yourself Mr. Bean"), and shrunk in the wash ("Tee Off, Mr. Bean").

[...] Owen and Cristina have struggled with their fictional relationship in season eight, leading to Owen having a sexual affair. Directly before the episode involving the affair aired, McKidd said to Entertainment Weekly: [...] "The thing about Owen is that he tries to do things perfectly, and obviously, he messes up as the chief because you have to make these odd black-and-white decisions and sometimes you make the wrong decision. There’s a lot of stress in his life at the moment, so he’s <b>trying</b> <b>not</b> to let that affect his efficiency as chief." [...] Although the characters' marriage is tested, McKidd reported to The Hollywood Reporter: [...] "I think they're meant for each other.
