40|$|Aim: Our aim was {{to assess}} the {{prevalence}} of breast cancer among women who showed up and participated in the breast cancer screening pro-gram during October 2007 -October 2008 in Tirana, the Albanian capital city. Methods: A breast cancer prevention and treatment campaign was undertaken in Tirana, Albania, in 2007 which included also mammography examination for the early detection of breast cancer. All women residing in Tirana municipality were invited <b>to</b> <b>undergo</b> a <b>mammography</b> examination free of charge. Results: A total number of 5224 women <b>underwent</b> <b>mammography</b> examination during October 2007 – October 2008 time period in Tirana. The highest number of mammography tests were per-formed in October 2008 (1284 tests), followed by June 2008 with 746 mammography examinations realized. In general, the prevalence of breast cancer positive mammography readings where higher among women older than 60 years, followed by the 51 - 60 and 41 - 50 years age-groups. Conclusion: Our findings indicate that, among 5224 examined women during a one-year period, 1. 9 % had a positive reading in mammography.

40|$|Abstract Background There {{are many}} {{differences}} in culture, community identity, community participation, and ownership between communities in Western and Asian countries; thus, {{it is difficult}} to adopt the results of community intervention studies from Western countries. In this study, we conducted a multicity, multicomponent community intervention trial to correct breast cancer myths and promote screening mammography for women living in an urban community in Korea. Methods A 6 -month, 2 -city community intervention trial was conducted. In the intervention city, 480 women were surveyed at baseline and 7 months later to evaluate the effects of the intervention program. Strategies implemented in the intervention city included community outreach and clinic and pharmacy-based in-reach strategies. Results This study showed a 20. 4 -percentage-point decrease in myths about the link between cancer and breast size, a 19. 2 -percentage-point decrease in myths concerning mammography costs, and a 14. 1 -percentage-point increase in intention to undergo screening mammography. We also saw a 23. 4 -percentage-point increase in the proportion of women at the action stage of the transtheoretical model in the intervention city.

40|$|AbstractStudies {{have shown}} an {{increased}} risk of breast cancer associated with diabetes which may be due to differences in mammography use among women who have diabetes compared with women who do not have diabetes. Baseline data was used from the Southern Community Cohort Study – a prospective cohort study conducted primarily among low-income persons in the southeastern United States – to examine the association between diabetes and mammography use. In-person interviews collected information on diabetes and mammography use from 14, 665 white and 30, 846 black women aged 40 – 79 years between 2002 and 2009. After adjustment for potential confounding, white women with diabetes were no more likely (odds ratio [OR] 0. 95, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 0. 85 – 1. 06) <b>to</b> <b>undergo</b> <b>mammography</b> within the past 12 months than white women without diabetes. Nor was there an association between diabetes and mammography use among black women (OR 1. 00, 95 % CI 0. 93 – 1. 07). An increase in mammography use was seen within one year following diabetes diagnosis, more so among white than black women, but this was offset by decreases thereafter.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Women age 65 {{years and}} older account for most newly {{diagnosed}} breast cancers and deaths from breast cancer. Yet, older women are least likely <b>to</b> <b>undergo</b> <b>mammography,</b> perhaps because mammography 2 ̆ 7 s value is less well demonstrated in older women. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between prior mammography use, cancer stage at diagnosis, and breast cancer mortality among older women with breast cancer. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study using the Linked Medicare-Tumor Registry Database. SETTING: Population-based data from three geographic areas included in the National Cancer Institute 2 ̆ 7 s Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program. PARTICIPANTS: Women aged 67 and older diagnosed with a first primary breast cancer, from 1987 to 1993, residing in Connecticut, metropolitan Atlanta, Georgia, or Seattle-Puget Sound, Washington. MEASUREMENTS: Medicare claims were reviewed and women were classified according to their mammography use during the 2 years before diagnosis: nonusers (no prior mammograms), regular users (at least two mammograms at least 10 months apart), or peri-diagnosis users (only mammogram(s) within 3 months before diagnosis). Mammography utilization was linked with SEER data to determine stage at diagnosis and cause of death. Our main outcome variables were (1) stage at diagnosis, classified as early (in situ/Stage I) or late (Stage II or greater), and (2) breast cancer mortality, measured from diagnosis until death from breast cancer or end of the follow-up period (December 31, 1994).

30|$|This paper summarises {{the basic}} {{information}} to be offered <b>to</b> women who <b>undergo</b> <b>mammography.</b> After a delineation of the general aim of early diagnosis of breast cancer, {{the main difference between}} screening mammography and diagnostic mammography is explained. The best time for scheduling mammography in fertile women is defined. The need to bring images and reports from the previous mammogram (and from other recent breast imaging examinations) is highlighted. The technique and procedure of mammography are briefly described with particular attention to discomfort and pain experienced by a fraction of women who undergo the test. Information is given on the recall during a screening program and on the request for further work-up after a diagnostic mammography. The logic of the diagnostic mammography report and of classification systems such as BI-RADS and R 1 -R 5 is illustrated, and brief but clear information is given about the diagnostic performance of the test, with particular reference to interval cancers. Moreover, the breast cancer risk due to radiation exposure from mammography is compared to the reduction in mortality obtained with the test, and the concept of overdiagnosis is presented. Finally, five frequently asked questions are answered.|$|R

40|$|QUESTION UNDER STUDY: Physicians play a {{key role}} in {{motivating}} women <b>to</b> <b>undergo</b> <b>mammography</b> screening. In 1998 we assessed Swiss physicians' attitudes to mammography screening and their prescription behaviour in this regard. METHODS: All female physicians and every second male physician aged 50 - 69 who were either not board-certified or board-certified in general practice, internal medicine, or obstetrics/gynaecology were sent a questionnaire. The response rate was 50 % and thus 738 questionnaires were included in this study. Of the study population 39 % were female and 61 % male physicians. The distribution of professional backgrounds was: 27 % board-certified general practitioners; 23 % board-certified internists; 11 % board-certified gynaecologists; 39 % not board-certified. RESULTS: 55 % of all study participants were in favour of a mammography screening programme for women aged over 50 in Switzerland, but breast self-examination and clinical breast examination were judged to have a more positive impact on breast cancer survival. Among clinically practising physicians, 22 % reported generally prescribing biannual screening mammographies for women aged 50 - 69. Irrespective of other determinants, physicians from the Italian- and French-speaking parts of Switzerland prescribed screening mammographies more often than their colleagues from the German-speaking part (odds ratio [OR] 2. 5; 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1. 5 - 4. 2). Clinical practice in obstetrics/gynaecology (OR 2. 4; CI 1. 3 - 4. 2) and a self-reported high level of knowledge concerning mammography screening (OR 1. 9; CI 1. 1 - 3. 2) were also positively associated with the prescription of screening mammography. CONCLUSIONS: Since mammography screening programmes exist in only three French-speaking cantons of Switzerland (VS; VD; GE), the gap in prescription of screening mammographies between French/Italian- and German-speaking regions must be narrowed to prevent a higher prevalence of side effects from opportunistic screening among German-speaking women. There is a need to educate physicians and the political community regarding the risks and benefits of mammography screening...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{contributes to}} the field of health economics, which, {{in the past couple of}} decades, has substantially increased our understanding of the determinants of human health, health-related behavior, and health care choices. A large body of literature has documented the influence of peer group behavior on individual choices. The purpose of my research is to examine the extent of such a phenomenon in breast cancer preventive behavior. Using Behavioral Risk Factors Surveillance System (BRFSS) surveys from 1993 - 2008, I measured the effect of other female screening behavior on an individual 2 ̆ 7 s decision to have a routine breast cancer screening by calculating the size of a so called social multiplier in mammography. I estimated a vector of social multipliers in the use of annual mammograms by taking the ratio of group-level effects of exogenous explanatory variables to individual-level effects of the same variables. Peer groups are defined as same-aged women living in the same geographical area: county or state. Several econometric methods were used to analyze the effect of social interactions on decision <b>to</b> <b>undergo</b> <b>mammography,</b> including ordinary least squares, fixed effects, the split sample instrumental variable approach, and a falsification test. My results supported the hypothesis that social interactions have an impact on the decision to have a mammogram. For all women over age 40, I found strong evidence of social interactions being associated with individual 2 ̆ 7 s education and ethnicity. In addition, the decision for women ages 40 - 49 to have a screening was subject to peer influence through their place of employment and ownership of health insurance. Finally, for women age 75 and older, being married and aging were the most important channels through which peer group influenced the decision to have a mammogram. This research has important policy implications in the presence of current health care reform that reimburses breast cancer screening at 100...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} {{factors affecting}} compliance with screening mammography prescribed by family physicians. DESIGN: Secondary {{analysis of a}} nonrandomized trial. SETTING: University-affiliated family medicine clinic in Montreal. PATIENTS: Women aged 50 to 69 years who were given a written prescription for a screening mammography during their visit at the clinic between Oct. 12, 1991, and May 31, 1992, and who had not undergone mammography in the preceding 2 years and had never been treated for breast cancer. Information on the potential factors was obtained through a telephone questionnaire 2 months after the visit. OUTCOME MEASURES: Indicator of compliance presence of result of screening mammography in patient chart, potential factors influencing compliance: age, level of education, marital status, socioeconomic level, smoking status, perceived health status, perceived psychological well-being, risk factors for breast cancer, use of health services including frequency of Papanicolaou test, Health Belief Model variables. RESULTS: Of the 171 eligible women, 113 (66. 1 %) underwent the prescribed mammography within 2 months after the visit to the clinic, and 149 (87. 1 %) responded to the questionnaire. The patients' socioeconomic characteristics, perceived health status, health utilization indices and risk factors for breast cancer were {{not found to be}} predictors of compliance. The strongest predictor of compliance was the number of previous mammograms. Women who had undergone mammography previously {{were less likely to be}} noncompliant than those who had not (odds ratio [OR] 0. 11, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 0. 02 to 0. 51; p = 0. 005). Women who did not comply were less likely than those who did to believe that a prescription from their physician would convince them <b>to</b> <b>undergo</b> <b>mammography</b> (OR 0. 21, 95 % CI 0. 007 to 0. 60; p = 0. 004). Other factors associated with noncompliance were the expression of fear of mammography (OR 2. 09, 95 % CI 1. 08 to 4. 02; p = 0. 03) and the lack of time to take the test (OR 3. 07, 95 % CI 1. 21 to 7. 80 p = 0. 02). Being a smoker was negatively associated with compliance (OR 0. 43; 95 % CI 0. 22 to 0. 86; p = 0. 02). The stepwise logistic regression model accounted for 87. 5 % of the outcome (chi 2 for goodness of fit = 164. 4; p = 0. 0001). CONCLUSION: Family physicians who prescribe screening mammography, even to women who consult for other reasons, are likely to overcome some of the barriers observed in association with population screening rates. However, physician-oriented approaches are not likely to reach the 30 % to 40 % of reluctant women who appear to hold negative views toward physicians' recommendations. Further study is necessary to determine how better to reach these women...|$|E
40|$|Women {{are often}} asked by their doctors {{to choose their}} {{preferred}} treatment for early breast cancer. Evidence shows that many women are distressed and confused {{about how to make}} this treatment decision and frequently seek help from nurses. Very little is known about women's value-centred decision-making in relation to selecting treatment for breast cancer and for nurses {{it is difficult to know}} how to assist these women with this process. In this study, 377 women participated prior <b>to</b> <b>undergoing</b> routine <b>mammography</b> screening and the data were collected using the Pre-Decision Portfolio Questionnaire (PDPQ) by Pierce 1. The partipants identified that expected treatment outcomes were the most important factor in choosing early breast cancer treatment. The majority reported that it was very important that a treatment would reduce the chances the cancer would return (95. 6 %), increase the length of their life (82. 1 %) and lead them to being healthy (80. 4 %). In addition, the participants indicated that it was important, or very important, that the emotional consequences of the treatment did "not make you depressed" (88. 6 %) or "sad" (90. 4 %) and should "keep you from worrying" (97 %) and "give you peace of mind" (98. 6 %). Other factors, such as treatment's side effects, were identified as less important. Age, employment, education and having a family history of breast cancer were found to be significant influencing variables on the values of the participants. It was concluded that assessing and understanding the treatment values of women can help nurses focus on areas of importance to the woman and lead to informed decision-making when they are choosing treatment for early breast cancer...|$|R

40|$|IntroductionThe National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program (BCCP) in Ohio {{provides}} {{screening and}} treatment services for uninsured low-income women aged 40 to 64. Because {{participation in the}} BCCP might engender greater self-efficacy for cancer screening, we hypothesized that breast cancer and survival outcomes would be better in BCCP participants who become age-eligible to transition to Medicare than in their low-income non-BCCP counterparts. MethodsLinking data from the 2000 through 2009 Ohio Cancer Incidence Surveillance System with the BCCP database, Medicare files, Ohio death certificates (through 2010), and the US Census, we identified Medicare beneficiaries who were aged 66 to 74 and diagnosed with incident invasive breast cancer. We compared the following outcomes between BCCP women (n = 93) and low-income non-BCCP women (n = 420) : receipt of screening mammography in previous year, advanced-stage disease at diagnosis, timely and standard care, all-cause survival, and cancer survival.

A cohort of 84 SSc women was asked if they had <b>undergone</b> <b>mammography</b> and Pap test during the previous 2 - and 3 -year intervals, as indicated according to the Italian recommendations. The results were compared with those collected in patients affected by other chronic rheumatic disorders and in the general population. More than 85 % of SSc women declared to comply with an age-related cervix and breast cancer screening schedule. The data were similar to those collected in patients affected by other chronic rheumatic disorders, whereas the subjects belonging to the general population reported <b>to</b> <b>undergo</b> breast cancer screening more frequently. Among SSc women, neither the educational level, nor the lung and skin involvement influenced their cancer screening program compliance. Only a positive history of ischemic digital ulcers seemed to interfere with mammography. Our study reported a very high percentage of SSc female patients who adhered to programs for the early detection of cervical and breast cancer. The significant adherence to guidelines may be due to the schedule adopted by the local health public service, which regularly invites eligible subjects by mail <b>to</b> <b>undergo</b> cancer screening at no charge...|$|R
40|$|Women with {{extremely}} dense breasts have {{an increased}} risk of breast cancer and lower mammographic tumor detectability. Nevertheless, in most countries, these women are currently screened with mammography only. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging has the potential to improve breast cancer detection at an early stage because of its higher sensitivity. However, MR imaging is more expensive and is expected to be accompanied by {{an increase in the number}} of false-positive results and, possibly, an increase in overdiagnosis. To study the additional value of MR imaging, a randomized controlled trial (RCT) design is needed in which one group <b>undergoes</b> <b>mammography</b> and the other group <b>undergoes</b> <b>mammography</b> and MR imaging. With this design, it is possible to determine the proportion of interval cancers within each study arm. For this to be an effective screening strategy, the additional cancers detected at MR imaging screening must be accompanied by a subsequent reduction in interval cancers. The Dense Tissue and Early Breast Neoplasm Screening, or DENSE, trial is a multicenter RCT performed in the Dutch biennial population-based screening program (subject age range, 50 - 75 years). The study was approved by the Dutch Minister of Health, Welfare and Sport. In this study, mammographic density is measured by using a fully automated volumetric method. Participants with extremely dense breasts (American College of Radiology breast density category 4) and a negative result at mammography (Breast Imaging Recording and Data System category 1 or 2) are randomly assigned <b>to</b> <b>undergo</b> additional MR imaging (n = 7237) or to be treated according to current practice (n = 28 948). Participants provide written informed consent before the MR imaging examination, which consists of dynamic breast MR imaging with gadolinium-based contrast medium and is intended to be performed for three consecutive screening rounds. The primary outcome is the difference in the proportions of interval cancers between the study arms. Secondary outcomes are the number of MR imaging screening-detected cancers, proportions of false-positive results, diagnostic yield of MR imaging, tumor characteristics, quality of life, and cost effectiveness.

30|$|Almost all {{patients}} in the cohort <b>underwent</b> imaging <b>to</b> stage their disease while pregnant. Notably, nearly half of patients <b>underwent</b> <b>mammography</b> and over 10 % underwent MRI scanning, with no apparent adverse effect on the fetus. The safety and feasibility of mammography during pregnancy have been reported (Kopans 1998; Yang et al. 2006), and it is unclear why rates of mammography were not higher in this population. The {{findings from this study}} support the safety of mammography during pregnancy; and suggest that MRI may have a role in select cases (Taylor et al. 2011).|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Preventive {{health care}} services, {{such as cancer}} {{screening}} can be particularly vulnerable {{to a lack of}} paid leave from work since care is not being sought for illness or symptoms. We first describe the prevalence of paid sick leave by broad occupational categories and then examine the association between access to paid sick leave and cancer testing and medical care-seeking in the U. S. workforce. Methods Data from the 2008 National Health Interview survey were analyzed by using paid sick leave status and other health-related factors to describe the proportion of U. S. workers <b>undergoing</b> <b>mammography,</b> Pap testing, endoscopy, fecal occult blood test (FOBT), and medical-care seeking. Results More than 48 million individuals (38 %) in an estimated U. S. working population of 127 million did not have paid sick leave in 2008. The percentage of workers who <b>underwent</b> <b>mammography,</b> Pap test, endoscopy at recommended intervals, had seen a doctor during the previous 12 [*]months or had at least one visit to a health care provider during the previous 12 [*]months was significantly higher among those with paid sick leave compared with those without sick leave after controlling for sociodemographic and health-care-related factors. Conclusions Lack of paid sick leave appears to be a potential barrier to obtaining preventive medical care and is a societal benefit that is potentially amenable to change. </p...|$|R

In Hungary, percentage of women <b>undergoing</b> <b>mammography</b> increased from 27.4 to 61.0  % in 2002 – 2003, and 56.3  % in 2004 – 2005 after the introduction of the nationwide program (Boncz et al. 2008).|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE. Our aim was {{to compare}} the {{effectiveness}} of mammography and MRI in the detection of multifocal, multicentric breast cancer. SUBJECTS AND METHODS. Ninety patients with planned mastectomies (nine bilateral) <b>underwent</b> <b>mammography</b> and dynamic gadolinium-enhanced MRI. Off-site reviewers aware of the entry criterion (planned mastectomy) evaluated both examinations {{for the presence of}} malignant foci, recording the density pattern on mammography. The gold standard was pathologic examination of the whole excised breast (slice thickness, 5 mm). RESULTS. Of 99 breasts, pathologic findings revealed 52 unifocal, 29 multifocal, and 18 multicentric cancers for a total of 188 malignant foci (158 invasive and 30 in situ). Overall sensitivity was 66...|$|R
40|$|Present article {{evaluate}} {{the influence of}} leading risk factors established for breast cancer (BC) on the mammography screening efficiency. 26 912 women <b>underwent</b> <b>mammography</b> screening in 2001 − 2010. The direct impact of BC risk factor number on the disease stage was revealed. Diagnostic effectiveness of screening mammography decreased in patient groups with high mammographic density. The importance of control of patient groups with BC risk factors and reasonability of mam- mographic density evaluation is described. The occurrence of BRCA 1 / 2 mutations was revealed in patients with BC identified by mammography screening. The relationship between the presence of advanced and metastatic BC and the BRCA 1 / 2 mutations was determined. </p...|$|R

Two female patients, aged 66 and 52, presented with enophthalmos. Both had recently <b>undergone</b> <b>mammography</b> with no abnormalities being observed. CT scans of these patients disclosed an intra-orbital, space-occupying process.
