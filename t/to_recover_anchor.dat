50|$|Laplace reached Gibraltar in one week, {{and decided}} to set sail for Gorée, where he spent a week. The ship then made its way south, {{crossing}} the Equator on the 4 February, and sighting the Cape of Good Hope on 6 March. Being forced to skip the scheduled stop in Cape Town due to poor weather, Laplace attempted to continue on to Île Bourbon. Forced south by winds, La Favorie {{was hit by a}} hurricane on 28 March. The hurricane reached Bourbon on 1 April, ravaging the island, and was closely followed by another, forcing Laplace to hurriedly set sail for Mauritius. Upon returning to St. Denis, a shark killed one of his crew members who was attempting to desert, and Laplace was unable <b>to</b> <b>recover</b> an <b>anchor</b> he had lost near the island.|$|R
50|$|On 8 April four East India Company ships {{entered the}} bay in which Roebuck was lost {{and took them}} on board. One of the vessels, Hastings, elected <b>to</b> <b>recover</b> an <b>anchor</b> and cable, {{apparently}} the one used to warp Roebuck ashore. This proved successful, but a grappling anchor was lost. The ships then transported Dampier and his crew home, where he published {{an account of the}} voyage in 1703 entitled A Voyage to New Holland—again to great acclaim. Though this further cemented his reputation as an explorer, at the court martial into the loss of his ship Dampier was roundly criticised for his treatment of Fisher, destroying any further attempt at official patronage. He later gave the plant collections he saved from the wreck to the Royal Society, and they eventually found their way to the University of Oxford.|$|R

50|$|In 1972, Seton, a {{scuba diving}} enthusiast, planned an {{expedition}} <b>to</b> find and <b>recover</b> the <b>anchors</b> {{with the assistance}} of the following fellow members of the UEC - Terry & Helen Drew, Peter & Rosalie Koch and John Summers, the following residents of Esperance - Don Gulvan, Don McKenzie and Tony Moore of Cape Arid Farm, and with the support of the following sponsors - BP, a boating business known as Lawton Agencies and the Adelaide newspaper, the Sunday Mail.|$|R
500|$|Numerous {{attempts}} have been made to salvage the gold. In 1893, the nephew of Colonel Seton wrote that a certain Mr. Bandmann at the Cape obtained permission from the Cape Government to dive the wreck of the Birkenhead in search of the treasure. [...] A June 1958 salvage attempt by a renowned Cape Town diver <b>recovered</b> <b>anchors</b> and some brass fittings, but no gold. [...] In 1986-1988, a combined archaeological and salvage excavation was carried out by Aqua Exploration, Depth Recovery Unit and Pentow Marine Salvage Company. Only a few gold coins were <b>recovered,</b> which appear <b>to</b> have been the personal possessions of the passengers and crew.|$|R

[...] The recovery of the anchors and their connection to the voyage of the HMS Investigator is commemorated in the inclusion of the best bower anchor and the outline of the Australian continent on the SUHR emblem.|$|R

In 1973, the anchors were located and {{recovered}} by members of the Underwater Explorers Club of South Australia (UEC). The <b>recovered</b> <b>anchors</b> became the subject of an ownership dispute between various governments, particularly those of South Australia and Western Australia due to their historic significance as artefacts of a major voyage of European exploration. The dispute was resolved with the ownership of the anchors going to the Australian Government who subsequently gifted one of the anchors to the South Australian Government. The pair of artefacts is also known as Flinders Anchors.|$|R

The system is described by 1 -D Klein-Gordon partial differential equation with a time-varying parameter. We would like <b>to</b> <b>recover</b> the internal control applied to the system if we know some limited information about the output. We use a method called sentinel method <b>to</b> <b>recover</b> the internal control. It involves some construction of a linear functional, and we show that this construction relates closely to the exact controllability problem...|$|R
