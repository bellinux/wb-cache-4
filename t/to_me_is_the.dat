5|$|I don't {{see much}} {{difference}} between a communist regime and a fascist regime. In fact, I {{think one of the}} greatest intellectual confusions that many have had over these decades is the whole right and left thing -- fascists are on the right, communists are on the left. Nonsense! They come together and overlap, and we're seeing this in Russia today where the allies are the nationalistic chauvinists and the communists. They are natural allies because they are authoritarians by nature. And more than authoritarians, they tend to be totalitarians, which means that they tend to destroy all of the elements of the civil society. To me that's much more important than whether you're philosophically right or left. You know, are you willing to create and live in a civil society, in an open society, or not? That <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> basic issue.|$|E
25|$|Back <b>to</b> <b>Me</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> third studio album by American {{singer and}} {{songwriter}} Fantasia Barrino. It {{was released on}} August 24, 2010, by J Records. The album is her first studio album in four years since 2006's Fantasia. The album's title was suggested to her by comedian Steve Harvey, when Barrino visited his morning radio program. The album sold 117,000 in its first week, debuting at number two on the US Billboard 200 and at {{number one on the}} Billboard R/Hip-Hop Albums chart, making it Fantasia's highest charting album as of September 2010.|$|E
500|$|In 1959, On the {{occasion}} of Delage's 80th birthday, Paul Le Flem declaimed [...] "the artistic perfection that always gives way before the Apollonian pleasure of music: music and poetry, that which is not for surprising us. What puzzles some, which seems grossly unfair <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> conspiracy of silence that slowly weaves around this musician who knows the value of silence, shade, solitude." ...|$|E

500|$|Hand is also {{remembered as}} a pioneer of modern {{approaches}} to statutory interpretation. His decisions in specialist fields, such as patents, torts, admiralty law, and antitrust law, set lasting standards for craftsmanship and clarity. On constitutional matters, he was both a political progressive and an advocate of judicial restraint. He believed in the protection of free speech and in bold legislation to address social and economic problems. He argued, however, that the United States Constitution does not empower courts to overrule the legislation of elected bodies, except in extreme circumstances. Instead, he advocated the [...] "combination of toleration and imagination that <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> epitome of all good government".|$|E
500|$|Despite {{his lack}} of {{experience}} in composing film music, Prokofiev began his Kijé score confidently, later writing: [...] "I somehow had no doubts whatever about the musical language for the film". He told the producers, [...] "What is important <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> era, the internal meaning of each event, the personality of each hero", and warned them not to expect mere musical [...] "illustrations". He attended rehearsals and made detailed notes of the action and the acting. The period setting of the film appealed to Prokofiev; Robinson comments that the Kijé score {{is one of several}} works, including the Classical Symphony, The Love of Three Oranges, Cinderella, and War and Peace, that show [...] "the composer's fondness for the eighteenth century". The language he chose combined elements of humour and romance with an underlying melancholy—he interpreted the story as more tragic than comic. Prokofiev had heard Ravel's Boléro in Paris, and had been much impressed by the French composer's use of the saxophone, an instrument then rarely used in orchestral compositions outside France but which suited Prokofiev's intentions perfectly. The composer Gerard McBurney has pointed out the [...] "haunting sounds of the tenor saxophone" [...] that punctuate the Kijé music.|$|E
500|$|Regarding the {{resolution}} of the character at season four and dropping of Kartheiser from regular cast, Minear says that they had an idea at the conception of teenage Connor that he would only last a season, and [...] "it was time to end the character's story". But, they changed his original [...] "violent, morbid" [...] sendoff to a relatively happy one, citing their likability of actor and character as the reason. Also it was [...] "nice to give someone a happy ending for once." [...] Kartheiser was satisfied with the sendoff, particularly because the issue between Angel and Connor was confronted: [...] That <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> soul of the character. The name of the show is Angel so it all comes back to him. For Connor, everything stems from this place with Angel and Holtz, and when we got the opportunity for him to let that out, I think he came out of his tough shell and showed a little bit of his sensitivity. He showed that he was hurt by his father and that he was hurt by Holtz. The last scene of Angel watching memory-wiped Connor dine with his new family and slipping away quietly was Whedon's idea, derived from 1937's classic movie Stella Dallas: [...] "I've given up my child. I see my child is happy, and does not know me, and I'm happy. That is the thing that made Stella Darlas the greatest, the thing that made this episode work." ...|$|E

5000|$|Duke Ellington said, [...] "Bechet <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> very {{epitome of}} jazz ... {{everything}} {{he played in}} his whole life was completely original. I honestly think he <b>was</b> <b>the</b> most unique man to ever be in this music." ...|$|R

500|$|... "Champion" [...] {{was written}} by Minaj, along with T-Minus, Nikhil S., Drake, Young Jeezy, and Nas, with {{production}} handled by T-Minus and Nikhil S., who had previously worked with Minaj on her debut studio album Pink Friday (2010). Minaj had wanted several artists {{to appear on the}} song, including fellow New York rapper Nas. She had stated that she did not think that she could get Nas on the song, saying [...] "He's always been so exclusive. He doesn't work with everybody and I respect people that are like that. They take pride in their craft." [...] Minaj told Vibe, [...] "I keep saying to be from Queens and to end up having him... We know how picky he is [...] He said 'I like the song, I'm a do it, you can wait 'til Monday and I got you' and he kept his word. He murked it, for me to wait for a feature and it be that and murk the song and finish the song that way... I was amazed." [...] After hearing the song, Nas agreed to be on the track, and sent his verse back to Minaj the following Monday. After collaborating, Nas said that he {{had fallen in love with}} the song: [...] "Nicki hit us up, I got love, so it was nothin'--I did the record....If I feel it, I can get on it. I heard the track. I felt it. I loved it." [...] Another artist Minaj wanted on [...] "Champion" [...] was long-time idol and fellow female rapper Lauryn Hill. [...] "I wanted to get her on 'Champion'... That would have been crazy, right? She was my fave. [...] Lauryn <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> goddess. I'd love to meet her. I'm pretty sure she's heard me talk about her a billion times." [...] Although Minaj vouched for Hill to appear on the track, plans were never finalized and the collaboration ultimately fell through.|$|E
2500|$|Composer Terry Riley {{describes}} how {{he works with}} the Kronos Quartet, an ensemble devoted to contemporary music: [...] "When I write a score for them, it's an unedited score. I put in just a minimal amount of dynamics and phrasing marks...we {{spend a lot of}} time trying out different ideas in order to shape the music, to form it. At the end of the process, it makes the performers actually own the music. [...] That <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> best way for composers and musicians to interact." ...|$|E
2500|$|Naisi {{receives}} a warning {{from his childhood}} friend Levarcham. ‘It is not well for you, dear children,’ said she, ‘to have with you that (viz. Deirdre) which he (Conchobar) felt hardest to be taken from him, now {{that you are in}} his power. And it is to visit you that I have been sent,’ said Levarcham, ‘and to see whether her own form and figure remain to Deirdre. And sad <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> deed that will be done this night in Emain, namely, treachery and guile and breach of faith to be wrought upon you, beloved friends.' ...|$|E
5000|$|... “What appealed <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> {{notion of}} doing things that {{appeared}} miraculous” Jackson once recalled. [...] "I was interested in spiritualism. I was interested in things like bullet catching, things that really challenged individual sensibilities, that <b>were</b> frightening, on <b>the</b> edge." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'A boy is a cad who can't behave {{himself to}} a girl because she is poor. I really think <b>the</b> apology <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> worst part or the matter. He only treats people well when he sees they {{can take care of}} themselves.' ...|$|R
60|$|For this I {{could in}} no manner have endured, nor have abased myself to love {{one that was}} unjust, how dear soever; and none could be dearer than Elliot. Yet unjust she might have been; and this thought <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> {{greatest}} torment.|$|R
2500|$|In a September 2006 {{edition of}} the ABC News program Nightline, Parker {{expressed}} his views on religion, stating that he believes in [...] "a God" [...] and that [...] "there is knowledge that humanity does not yet possess" [...] while cautioning {{that it would take}} a long time to explain exactly what he meant by his belief in God. Parker believes all religions are [...] "silly". He states that [...] "All the religions are superfunny to me… The story of Jesus makes no sense to me. God sent his only son. Why could God only have one son and why would he have to die? It's just bad writing, really. And it's really terrible in about the second act." [...] Parker further remarked, Basically… out of all the ridiculous religion stories which are greatly, wonderfully ridiculous—the silliest one I've ever heard is, 'Yeah… there's this big giant universe and it's expanding, it's all gonna collapse on itself and we're all just here just 'cause… just cause. That, <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> most ridiculous explanation ever.|$|E
2500|$|It was {{announced}} on 29 October 2007 that Patsy Palmer would be reprising {{the role of}} Bianca in EastEnders. A day later, it {{was announced}} that Sid Owen would also be returning to the show as Ricky. Owen commented: [...] "It {{will be interesting to see}} what has been happening to Ricky and Bianca over the last few years. Although, I must admit I'm not looking forward to her nagging me by shouting his name." [...] Executive producer Diederick Santer commented: [...] "First Patsy comes home, now Sid! Ricky and Bianca were a hugely popular and well-loved partnership on the show [...] Seeing Bianca back on the show is exciting in itself, but to throw Ricky into the equation gives things an added dimension. Ricky's a great and much-loved character in his own right, but what's really exciting <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> two of them together. There's so much history, drama and passion to explore [...] There'll always be a connection between Ricky and Bianca". To promote the characters' return, the BBC began airing trailers across the BBC network in March 2008. One trailer utilised Bianca's [...] "trademark holler" [...] of Ricky's name, which is so loud that it smashes the windows of The Queen Victoria public house. The trailer featured the Righteous Brothers' song [...] "Hung on You".|$|E
2500|$|Their {{second album}} {{entitled}} The Truth {{was released on}} May 13, 2008. In a promotional interview, member Fallon said of the album, [...] "The biggest difference <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> fact that you grow artistically whenever you're being creative and we've been creative {{for the past couple}} of years. Our artistry has grown. When we wrote The Truth, we named the album The Truth because basically every song on the album is from personal experiences and we wanted to get personal with our fans. We want everybody to know that they're not alone going through these things and we're here." [...] The album was released in the UK on May 12, while the Japanese release is on May 14 and featured two bonus tracks, [...] "Do It to It" [...] (Rap Remix) and [...] "Silly". In the US, the album only sold 13,000 copies in the first week of release, which led to it debuting at number 40 on the Billboard 200. In Japan, the album debuted at number 98 on the official album chart, and has sold only 2,300 copies in that country to date. As of 2011, the album has sold only 30,000 copies in the United States. A second single from the album was released, titled [...] "Amnesia". The single failed to make an impact, however, missing the Billboard Hot 100 entirely. It did peak at number 61 on the Hot R/Hip-Hop Songs chart, though.|$|E

2500|$|In September 2011, Ahern said he {{believed}} {{that he would have}} [...] "done all right" [...] in the presidential election but for the decline in the popularity of Fianna Fáil. Ahern confirmed he considered running in the election. [...] "I still would have done all right. I mean they have done some figures and I would probably sit in around 30 per cent, which you haven’t a hope with as the party is on 20 per cent." [...] He added that [...] "the party popularity is the thing that snookers it, because if your party isn’t winnable..." [...] Mr Ahern said: [...] "If there was no downturn and if it wasn’t all the hassle of the tribunals and everything else, then you could have had a good run at it." [...] He predicted that [...] "nobody is going to win it outright – like Mary McAleese had it won on the first count". Asked about a possible future candidacy in the following presidential election, he said: [...] "Normally what happens in this country, if a president does a good job they stay on, so that’s 14 years, so that ends any chance that I’ll have." [...] He also rejected suggestions that the Mahon tribunal would reject the evidence he gave on his personal finances. [...] "The only thing that is important <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> central allegations. And what the tribunal says about the other trash is irrelevant." [...] Michael Martin said the former taoiseach was [...] "out of touch with reality" [...] if {{he believed}} he could have won the presidency for Fianna Fáil. Martin also said expenses paid to Mr Ahern in his capacity as a former taoiseach were too high and should be reduced. He was commenting on reports that Mr Ahern had claimed €265,000 for [...] "secretarial services" [...] and €7,500 on mobile phone bills since he stepped down in May 2008. Under the current expenses regime, a former taoiseach may employ two secretarial assistants for up to five years after leaving office and one indefinitely after that.|$|E
