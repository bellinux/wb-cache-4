60|$|I {{almost always}} feel inclined, when I happen to say {{anything}} to soldiers, to impress upon them, in a few brief remarks, the importance of success in this contest. It is not merely for to-day, but for all time to come, that we should perpetuate for our children's children that great and free government which we have enjoyed all our lives. I beg you to remember this, not merely for my sake, but for yours. I happen, temporarily, to occupy <b>this</b> <b>White</b> <b>House.</b> I am a living witness that any one of your children may look to come here as my father's child has. It is in order that each one of you may have, through this free government which we have enjoyed, an open field and a fair chance for your industry, enterprise, and intelligence; that you may all have equal privileges in the race of life, with all its desirable human aspirations. It is for this the struggle should be maintained, that we may not lose our birthright--not only for one, but for two or three years. The nation is worth fighting for, to secure such an inestimable jewel.|$|E

50|$|Cadence charted nearly 100 American singles between 1953 and 1964. It {{produced}} the 1962 smash bestselling parody album, The First Family starring comedic actor Vaughn Meader. Acclaimed {{at that time}} as the fastest-selling album in history, <b>this</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> satire on the Kennedy family and Capital Hill politics remained at #1 on the Billboard 200 for 12 weeks. Featuring Meader's impression of President John F. Kennedy, the sketch revue included takes on First Lady Jackie Kennedy, newsmakers like Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev, and then Vice-President Lyndon Johnson. A follow-up album, The First Family, Volume Two, released in March 1963, reached #4. Both albums were immediately recalled and taken out of print following Kennedy's Dallas assassination. The departures of the Everly Brothers in 1960 (to Warner Bros. Records) and of Andy Williams in 1961 (to Columbia Records), along with radical changes in public taste and the music business {{brought on by the}} British Invasion, led to the rapid decline of the company by 1964. Bleyer opted to shut down Cadence, and sold Williams' masters to the singer, which he bought mainly because he wanted to keep any other buyer (Kapp Records and Liberty Records were two companies mentioned interested in buying the Cadence catalog) from reissuing his old material in competition with his new material. Bleyer wanted Williams to buy the entire Cadence catalogue, which he did. Williams reissued his old albums on Columbia and formed Barnaby Records to manage the Cadence catalogue.|$|E

Though he was not given the formal title of private secretary to the president until later and the term press secretary {{had not yet been}} conceived, Cortelyou was highly respected by the press and William McKinley's biographer, Margaret Leach, called Cortelyou [...] "the first of the presidential press secretaries". President Cleveland's successor, William McKinley, kept Cortelyou on during the transition and later formally named him private secretary to the President, though he had been informally doing the job for some time prior. Under McKinley, Cortelyou became notable for his popularity with journalists covering the <b>White</b> <b>House.</b> The correspondents relied on him for information and his tenure as private secretary was noteworthy for some of the same working traits modern press secretaries have become popular for, including providing information to reporters later in the evening if events had transpired in the afternoon, offering advance copies of remarks prepared for the President, and ensuring reporters received transcripts of unprepared remarks made by the President while traveling, which were recorded by a stenographer. Cortelyou also circulated noteworthy stories to the President and other staffers (by <b>this</b> point the <b>White</b> <b>House</b> staff numbered approximately 18), which is similar to the exhaustive news summaries formally distributed to the <b>White</b> <b>House</b> staff in the modern era.
