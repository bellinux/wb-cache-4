5|$|Studies of {{rumination}} in {{otherwise healthy}} adults became decreasingly rare {{starting in the}} 1900s, {{and the majority of}} published reports analyzing the syndrome in mentally healthy patients appeared thereafter.

5|$|Despite {{being the}} most {{commonly}} studied and diagnosed mental disorder in children and adolescents, the exact cause is unknown {{in the majority of}} cases. It affects about 5–7% of children when diagnosed via the DSM-IV criteria and 1–2% when diagnosed via the ICD-10 criteria. As of 2015 it is estimated to affect about 51.1 million people. Rates are similar between countries and depend mostly on how it is diagnosed. ADHD is diagnosed approximately three times more often in boys than in girls, although the disorder is often overlooked in girls due to <b>their</b> <b>symptoms</b> differing from those of boys. About 30–50% of people diagnosed in childhood continue to have symptoms into adulthood and between 2–5% of adults have the condition.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess whether {{surgical}} decompression for carpal-tunnel syndrome (CTS) in the presence of primary or secondary osteoarthritis of the wrist is associated with poorer patient satisfaction. We did a retrospective matched cohort study. Twenty-four patients who underwent surgical decompression for CTS secondary to osteoarthritis were identified by reviewing the notes and the radiographs. A control group consisted of 24 patients without osteoarthritis of the wrist who underwent carpal-tunnel decompression. The control group was matched for age, sex, side, and neuro-physiological severity of the nerve compression. In the group with osteoarthritis of the wrist, 17 (71 %) patients reported <b>their</b> <b>symptom</b> relief as satisfactory, and 7 (29 %) reported the results as unsatisfactory. In the control group, 23 (96 %) patients reported <b>their</b> <b>symptom</b> relief as satisfactory, and 1 (4 %) reported the results as unsatisfactory (P= 0. 0325). In conclusion, patient satisfaction following surgical decompression in patients with secondary CTS due to osteoarthritis was significantly lower compared to patients without osteoarthritis of the wrist...|$|R
30|$|Findings from {{focus groups}} and {{individual}} interviews identified nine sign and symptom items covering bowel and abdominal symptoms. Important bowel-related symptoms {{from the perspective of}} the patient included frequency, consistency, the presence of blood, and the urge/need to have a bowel movement (BM) right away. Key abdominal symptoms included pain in the stomach area, bloating, gas, nausea, and vomiting. The symptoms most relevant during flare-ups included frequency of and consistency of BMs, and pain in the stomach area. Patient descriptions of the symptoms they experienced during a flare were similar to the language they used to describe <b>their</b> everyday <b>symptoms,</b> just more severe and/or persistent. Patient descriptions of <b>their</b> <b>symptom</b> experience underline the variability not only within, but also between patients.|$|R

By the middle of the 19th century, the British Royal Navy was using imported ice to cool the interiors of its ships' gun turrets.

5|$|Genetics {{may play}} a role in a person's {{disposition}} to SAH; risk is increased three- to fivefold in first-degree relatives of people having had a subarachnoid hemorrhage. However, lifestyle factors are more important in determining overall risk. These risk factors are smoking, hypertension (high blood pressure), and excessive alcohol consumption. Having smoked in the past confers a doubled risk of SAH compared to those who have never smoked. Some protection of uncertain significance is conferred by caucasian ethnicity, hormone replacement therapy, and diabetes mellitus. There is likely an inverse relationship between total serum cholesterol and the risk of non-traumatic SAH, though confirmation of this association is hindered by a lack of studies. Approximately 4 percent of aneurysmal bleeds occur after sexual intercourse and 10 percent of people with SAH are bending over or lifting heavy objects at the onset of <b>their</b> <b>symptoms.</b>|$|E
5|$|While {{individuals}} with tics are sometimes able to suppress their tics for limited periods of time, doing so {{often results in}} tension or mental exhaustion. People with Tourette's may seek a secluded spot to release <b>their</b> <b>symptoms,</b> or {{there may be a}} marked increase in tics after a period of suppression at school or at work. Some people with Tourette's may not be aware of the premonitory urge. Children may be less aware of the premonitory urge associated with tics than are adults, but their awareness tends to increase with maturity. They may have tics for several years before becoming aware of premonitory urges. Children may suppress tics while in the doctor's office, so they may need to be observed while they are not aware they are being watched. The ability to suppress tics varies among individuals, and may be more developed in adults than children.|$|E

30|$|Overall, {{research}} on relatives’ support and symptom management is still developing [60 – 62]. However, addressing relatives’ needs {{may lead to}} their subjective stress being reduced and their levels of self-care and emotional role functioning increasing [63]. These effects could, in turn, lead to better support in symptom management and improve the condition of CPTSD patients. However, {{there is little evidence}} to this effect and {{to the best of our}} knowledge no corresponding study has investigated the role of relatives during symptom management of patients with CPTSD. This is the third study of a larger mixed method research project to investigate symptom management and the social process of persons affected with CPTSD and their relatives [64]. In our first quantitative descriptive study we were able to identify adult CPTSD inpatients. Further we provided results concerning <b>their</b> <b>symptom</b> burden and related characteristics. Such high prevalence of unemployment, high prevalence of childhood abuse, high prevalence of depressive symptoms and different levels of CPTSD symptom burden. Based on that results and we were able to identify inpatients for interviews, aiming to explore <b>their</b> <b>symptom</b> management in everyday life. At the same time a related relative was additional asked for an interview, aiming to explore their view, experience and <b>their</b> role in <b>symptom</b> management of those CPTSD affected.
