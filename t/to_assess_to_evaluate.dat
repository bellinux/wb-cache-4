40|$|New {{evidence}} in aerobiology challenges {{the assumption that}} geographical isolation is an effective barrier to microbial transport. However, given the uncertainty with which aerobiological organisms are recruited into existing communities, the ultimate impact of microbial dispersal is difficult <b>to</b> <b>assess.</b> <b>To</b> <b>evaluate</b> the ecological significance of global-scale microbial dispersal, molecular genetic approaches were used to examine microbial communities inhabiting fumarolic soils on Mt. Erebus, the southernmost geothermal site on Earth. There, hot, fumarolic soils provide an effective environmental filter to test the viability of organisms that have been distributed via aeolian transport over geological time. We find that cosmopolitan thermophiles dominate the surface, whereas endemic Archaea and members of poorly understood Bacterial candidate divisions dominate the immediate subsurface. These results imply that aeolian processes readily disperse viable organisms globally, where they are incorporated into pre-existing complex communities of endemic and cosmopolitan taxa...|$|E

AimsWe sought <b>to</b> <b>assess</b> <b>to</b> <b>evaluate</b> {{the usefulness of}} SS II in a real-world acute coronary syndromes (ACS) population with severe coronary artery disease (CAD) undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). MethodsFrom August 2011 to May 2013, out of 1591 consecutive patients admitted for ACS, 217 (13. 6 %) showed severe CAD (three-vessel disease and/or left main involvement). Among the latter, 100 patients underwent PCI and were enrolled into the study. SS II was calculated in all patients. One-year clinical follow-up was performed; major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) were defined as a composite of death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, stroke, or repeat revascularization. ResultsThe median SS II was 29 (range, 14 – 59). Overall, MACCE occurred in 25 % of patients (cardiac death 4 %, myocardial infarction 4 %, stroke 0 %, and repeat revascularization 17 %). The 1 -year MACCE-free survival was significantly lower in patients with SS (⩾ 29), than in those with SS II (< 29) (64. 2 % vs. 87. 2 %, respectively; p= 0. 007). In multivariate Cox regression analysis, the presence of unprotected left main stenosis [hazard ratio 2. 52, 95 % confidence interval (CI) : 1. 02 – 5. 85; p= 0. 031] and SS II ⩾ 29 (hazard ratio 2. 74, 95 % CI: 1. 30 – 8. 21; p= 0. 011) were the only predictors of MACCE at 1 -year clinical follow-up. The c-index of SS score II was 0. 70 (95 % CI: 0. 58 – 0. 81). For patients who experienced MACCE, the SS II reclassification improved by 36 %, while in nonevent patients the reclassification improved by 22 %. The net reclassification index was 0. 24 (p= 0. 09). ConclusionSS II might represent a useful tool to predict clinical events in not only ideal stable patients, but also an unrestricted, real world population of patients with ACS and severe CAD undergoing PCI...|$|E

40|$|Measuring {{the amount}} of wear {{in the case of}} revised hip {{replacements}} {{is considered to be a}} prerequisite of understanding and assessing true in vivo performance of the implant. Whilst most case studies have been focused on developing methods for measuring wear on the bearing surface an increased revision rate of LHMOM implants compared to resurfacing suggests that all interfaces have <b>to</b> <b>assessed</b> <b>to</b> <b>evaluate</b> overall wear. This paper describes the main characteristics of a method developed by the authors for quantifying taper wear as well as general taper interface parameters. Previous studies have mostly relied on visual inspection <b>to</b> <b>assess</b> the wear of the taper interface. The method aims at characterizing any surface and form changes caused by the wear process through the use of a roundness measurement machine. The measurement process enables a full 360 degree scan on the taper surface using a diamond tip stylus. Wear is determined by analyzing the data through a custom developed Matlab program. Along with assessing the volumetric wear linear wear and contact parameters can also be determined. The method was applied to 100 retrieved LHMOM femoral head components in order to quantify the wear at the taper junction. Initial results show that the taper interface is a contributing factor to overall wear with a wear volumes ranging from 0. 2 to 25 mm 3. The wear on the femoral heads can mostly be characterized as a localized area covering the whole contact length between the stem and the femoral head. Maximum linear depth is mostly present in the distal end of the femoral head. In some cases wear is only present on one half of the contact length suggesting unilateral loading. The results suggest the geometric form errors between components are one of the contributing factors of wear at the taper interface...|$|R

However, a model controlling for risk and liquidity explains a far larger proportion of returns.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{increasing}} {{influence of}} patient-reported outcome (PRO) measurement instruments indicates their scrutiny {{has never been}} more crucial. Above all, PRO instruments should be valid: shown <b>to</b> <b>assess</b> what they purport <b>to</b> <b>assess.</b> OBJECTIVES: <b>To</b> <b>evaluate</b> a widely used fatigue PRO instrument, highlight key issues in understanding PRO instrument validity, demonstrate limitations of those approaches and justify notable changes in the validation process. METHODS: A two-phase evaluation of the 40 -item Fatigue Impact scale (FIS) : a qualitative evaluation of content and face validity using expert opinion (n= 30) and a modified Delphi technique; a quantitative psychometric evaluation of internal and external construct validity of data from 333 people with multiple sclerosis using traditional and modern methods. RESULTS: Qualitative evaluation did not support content or face validity of the FIS. Expert opinion agreed with the subscale placement of 23 items (58 %), and classified all 40 items as being non-specific to fatigue impact. Nevertheless, standard quantitative psychometric evaluations implied, largely, FIS subscales were reliable and valid. CONCLUSIONS: Standard quantitative 'psychometric' evaluations of PRO instrument validity can be misleading. Evaluation of existing PRO instruments requires both qualitative and statistical methods. Development of new PRO instruments requires stronger conceptual underpinning, clearer definitions of the substantive variables for measurement and hypothesis-testing experimental designs...|$|R
40|$|AIM: <b>To</b> <b>evaluate</b> the {{accuracy}} of spherical equivalent (SE) estimates of a double-pass system and to compare it with retinoscopy, subjective refraction and a table-mounted autorefractor. METHODS: Non-cycloplegic refraction was performed on 125 eyes of 65 healthy adults (age 23. 5 ± 3. 0 years) from October 2010 to January 2011 using retinoscopy, subjective refraction, autorefraction (Auto kerato-refractometerTOPCON KR- 8100, Japan) and a double-pass system (Optical Quality Analysis System, OQAS, Visiometrics S. L., Spain). Nine consecutive measurements with the double-pass system were performed on a subgroup of 22 eyes <b>to</b> <b>assess</b> repeatability. <b>To</b> <b>evaluate</b> the trueness of the OQAS instrument, the SE laboratory bias between the double-pass system and the other techniques was calculated.

40|$|AbstractThe {{late effects}} {{and quality of}} life (QoL) in {{childhood}} acute leukemia survivors were compared between hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) recipients and patients who underwent conventional therapy. The study included 943 patients, 256 of whom underwent HSCT (27. 1 %). Medical visits were conducted to detect the occurrence of physical late effects. Based on patient age, different questionnaires were used <b>to</b> <b>assess</b> QoL. <b>To</b> <b>evaluate</b> the association between HSCT and each type of late effect or QoL dimension, the appropriate multivariate regressions were performed. QoL mean scores were compared with those obtained for age- and sex-matched French control subjects. Of all the survivors, 674 (71. 5 %) had at least 1 late effect, with the risk being 5. 0 CI 95 (3. 0 - 8. 6) times higher for transplantation survivors. For child survivors, scoring of QoL showed {{no significant differences between the}} treatment groups. The adult HSCT survivors reported lower physical dimension QoL scores than chemotherapy survivors. Compared with French norms, the survivor group reported a significantly lower mental composite score; however, the physical composite score showed no significant difference. Thus, transplanted survivors have a high risk of developing late effects, resulting in a decreased physical well-being in adulthood. However, long after treatment completion, childhood leukemia survivors report that effects on psychological well-being are more important than they are in physical QoL dimensions...|$|R

Active hexose correlated compound (AHCC), a compound obtained from fermented extract of the mycelia of Basidiomycetes mushrooms, has immunomodulating effects. As a nutritional countermeasure, we examined the effect of AHCC on microgravityinduced immune changes by using a hind-limb unloading (HLU) of mice as a microgravity analog. Methods: BALB/c mice were divided into non-HLU and HLU groups. Each group was further divided into subgroups receiving drinking water containing 0, 0. 1, 1, and 10 g/kg/day AHCC. After 7 days of HLU and feeding treatment, the proliferative response of popliteal lymph nodes (PLN) <b>to</b> alloantigen was <b>assessed</b> <b>to</b> <b>evaluate</b> in vivo T cell function. Furthermore, LPS-stimulated inflammatory cytokine and chemokine production in splenocytes was examined. Results: The response of PLN was significantly decreased in the HLU group and AHCC supplementation significantly reversed the response. LPS-stimulated cytokine and chemokine production was increased in the HLU group compared {{to that in the}} non- HLU group, and AHCC supplementation tended to increase those levels further. Discussion: AHCC enhances in vivo T cell function in microgravity, suggesting that AHCC supplementation under microgravity may have a beneficial role in maintenance of the immune system...|$|R
40|$|Received for {{publication}} February 2, 2009. Zinc (Zn) uptake by plant roots from soils low in plant-available Zn {{may be increased}} by Zn-mobilizing rhizosphere processes, including exudation of low-molecular-weight organic anions. A rhizotron experiment with a low Zn clay soil and a nutrient solution experiment were conducted to test if this occurs in six rice (Oryza sativa L.) genotypes varying in tolerance to low Zn supply. In both experiments, low Zn supply resulted in a marked decrease in biomass production of most genotypes compared with adequate Zn supply. The genotypes showed a significant variation in Zn efficiency. Plants responded to low Zn supply with increased root exudation of malate in both experiments. The malate concentration in the rhizosphere of three genotypes ranged from 0. 22 to 0. 59 mmol L– 1 in rhizotron experiment, and the malate exudation rate of five genotypes ranged from 0. 18 to 0. 53 nmol g– 1 root dw s– 1 in the nutrient solution experiment. On average, low Zn supply in the rhizotron experiment increased rhizosphere malate concentration by 64 % compared with that at adequate Zn supply. The averaged malate exudation rate at low Zn in the nutrient solution experiment was 40 % greater than at adequate Zn supply. The malate exudation of rice genotypes at low Zn was not correlated to Zn efficiency or Zn uptake in either experiment. Based on a soil malate extraction experiment, the observed genotypic difference in rhizosphere malate concentration {{is expected to have}} a negligible effect on the concentration of Zn in soil solution. These findings suggest that Zn mobilization by rice genotypes cannot be explained by increased malate exudation alone, indicating that other mechanisms contribute to the variation in plant Zn uptake. The results also emphasize that effects of root exudates on soil properties need <b>to</b> be <b>assessed</b> <b>to</b> <b>evaluate</b> the role of root exudation in nutrient mobilization...|$|R
40|$|Water {{shortage}} {{is rising}} {{to the level of}} the number one problem of the world today. Growing population becomes an important factor further reducing availability of clean drinking water. The problem of water scarcity is strongly connected to the problem of water quality. Indeed, the problem of clean drinking water shortage is a water quality problem, because most water uses pollute it. This in turn is connected to several complex issues. In spite of the efforts during UNESCO's International Decade 1981 - 1990, about 1. 2 billion people in developing countries still lack access to safe drinking water. Delivery of sufficient water volumes to urban populations constitutes a difficult logistic and economic problem. A sustainable water supply, where the quality of the water meets the quality requirements of the application, means a lower consumption of chemicals and energy and a more economic use of valuable resources. Rainwater harvesting has traditionally been viewed as a potential water supply source in remote rural settlements where the provision of water through piped networks is uneconomic or not technically feasible. However, of late, rainwater harvesting in urban settlements has gained momentum due to the recognition that usage of water were it falls has both economic and ecological advantages. This paper reviews current practices in rainwater harvesting systems in the built environment world-wide and tries to draw these experiences to the Harare metropolis (which already enjoys piped water system and waterborne sewerage infrastructure) for possible future adoption. With new concepts and the “vision of sustainable cities ” in terms of urban water management, rainwater harvesting in urban environments will play a major role to ensure that cities of tomorrow are not wasteful (water conservation) and non-polluting (pollution prevention at source). The water resource, energy and economic aspects of rainwater collection need <b>to</b> be <b>assessed</b> <b>to</b> <b>evaluate</b> rainfall collection as an alternative option for sustainable water supply. 1. ...|$|R

ResultsAll variables were significantly reduced in DVT limbs, both compared with contralateral limbs and with healthy controls. Only two patients had all values within normal ranges (=mean ±  2 SD in controls). Measures of outflow capacity had a coefficient of variation (CV) of 5 – 6 % and exercise-induced volume changes a CV of 10 – 15 %.

In the UK, a population with lower selenium status, {{there is little}} data on the association of selenium status with cardio-metabolic risk factors in the general population. We examined the association of plasma selenium concentration with blood lipids in a nationally representative sample of British adults. A cross-sectional study was conducted among 1042 white participants (aged 19 - 64 y) in the 2000 - 2001 UK National Diet and Nutrition Survey. Plasma selenium was measured by inductively coupled-plasma mass spectrometry. Total and HDL cholesterol were measured in nonfasting plasma samples. Mean plasma selenium concentration was 1. 10 +/- 0. 19 mu mol/L. The multivariate adjusted differences between the highest (>= 1. 20 mu mol/L) and lowest (= 1. 20 mu mol/L) was associated with increased total and non-HDL cholesterol levels but not with HDL in the UK adult population.

True mahogany (Swietenia macrophylla King.) has been the target of abusive exploitation for centuries and is the most commercially important tropical timber on the international market. The species is commercially extinct within most of its range and protected in some areas; such as our study area West Botes, Rio Bravo, in Belize. Sustainable logging is being tried in the hope of finding a compromise between conservation and market demand. West Botes is a plot that has been selectively logged and the genetic diversity needs <b>to</b> be <b>assessed</b> <b>to</b> <b>evaluate</b> the actual sustainability of the logging regime. The aim of this project is to use molecular markers <b>to</b> <b>assess</b> the spatial genetic structure of the population of Swietenia macrophylla, its genetic diversity, mating system and gene flow. To do so, three different microsatellites were used on both samples from the adult trees and also on the seeds in the plot. The following results were found: heterozygosity was relatively low (0. 419) and inbreeding significant (0. 125) compared to other similar studies, and especially compared to an unlogged plot. The spatial genetic structure of the population reveals tight clusters of closely related trees and it seems likely that this explains the significant level of biparental inbreeding. One of the conclusions that could be drawn is that the logging regime had a negative impact on the genetic diversity. However, the forest in West Botes is currently recovering from past intense logging regimes (until 1992) and one hurricane, and so it is probably too early in the succession to have a definite idea of the real pollen inflow and diversity of the population. Also, the number of loci used in this project is much lower than in other published studies, and so more loci will need to be screened in order to gain a probable estimate of the level of incoming gene flow. Overall, the trial of a sustainable logging in Hill Bank does not seem to be entirely successful and other management proposals should be looked into and considered...|$|R

The aim {{of this study was to}} identify patient-derived, potentially novel outcomes that may be used to guide future clinical trials in aneurysm surgery. MethodsFocus group interviews were conducted with patients who had undergone endovascular or open aortic aneurysm repair. The discussions were transcribed and the transcript was analyzed by two indexers using constant-comparison analysis and grounded theory to identify potentially novel, patient-derived outcomes. Other potential themes relating to the patients' experience and their decision-making were also sought. ResultsSix focus groups were conducted (three with endovascular aneurysm repair patients and three with open aortic aneurysm repair patients), with a median of six participants, 2 to 12  months from surgery. Functional outcomes were most commonly mentioned and emphasized by patients. Recovery time and energy level were most frequently verbalized as important in the decision-making process between endovascular and open aneurysm repair. Other potential outcomes identified as important to patients included postoperative pain, time to walking normally, loss of appetite, extent and location of incisions, impact on cognition, being able to go home after surgery, and impact on caregivers. In addition to these outcomes, we identified three themes relating to the patient's experience: undervaluing or underappreciating the risk of death during surgery, differing informational needs and level of involvement in decision-making, and unrealistic patient expectations about the risks of and recovery after the procedure. ConclusionsFunctional outcomes emerged as most important during qualitative analysis of patients' experiences with aneurysm repair. Perceived differences in recovery time were identified as an important consideration for aneurysm patients in deciding between open and endovascular repair.

In particular, the counterfactual scenarios for establishing socioeconomic impacts are vague, unscientific, or omitted completely. We conclude that drawing specific lessons from pre-REDD+ projects for the design or evaluation of current REDD+ projects is tenuous. Rigorous project evaluations are challenging, expensive, and time-consuming, but because they are so critical for learning about what works for people and forests, evaluations of current REDD+ projects must use improved methods. In particular, much better care should be taken to construct credible – and where possible, consistent – counterfactuals for both biophysical and socioeconomic outcomes...|$|R

As acknowledge, prescription, compounding, dispensing and administration of UL and OL use of medicines should be regulated within the national profile of health care policy. Bearing in mind that in our country there is no formal mechanism for management of OL drug prescribing and use that could lead to their quality use, this concept continues to be an important public health issue. For this underlining reason the purpose of our survey is to present the best practices and risk assessment strategy for UL and OU of medicines in pediatric population. First of all it is of paramount importance to establish national policies governing UL and OL prescribing and use along with ethical standard since prescribing by clinicians is an area of practice that is not regulated by drug regulatory authorities. Strategies for collaboration and the shared responsibilities among prescribers, clinicians, pharmacists and regulators with regard to the OL and UL medicines use should be developed and adopted on every level of pediatric health care. The process of determining the need for UL and OL medicines for pediatric population will serve for regulation of certain uses. Responsible OL and UL prescribing also require development of explicit guidance for pediatric clinicians <b>to</b> <b>assess</b> appropriateness, <b>to</b> <b>evaluate</b> safety and efficacy of OL and UL prescribing justified by high-quality evidence {{as well as in the}} cases where adequate evidence is lacking. Moreover, monitoring system for OL and UL medicines use by indication then, active collection of safety data and systematically monitoring of pediatric patient responses to OL use will decrease and prevent risky and ineffective OL prescribing. There is a need of policy reforms to promote care giver and public interest in evidence-based OL prescribing. Another issue that has to be regulated is the potential cost associated with this concept of use of medicines in paediatric drug therapy...|$|R

Therefore, we hypothesized that early disturbances in microbial colonization have short- and long-lasting consequences on selected intestinal components including key digestive enzymes and protective inducible heat shock proteins (HSP). The hypothesis was tested in swine offspring born to control mothers (n = 12) or mothers treated with the antibiotic amoxicillin around parturition (n = 11), and slaughtered serially at 14, 28 and 42 days of age <b>to</b> <b>assess</b> short-term effects. <b>To</b> <b>evaluate</b> long-term consequences, young adult offspring from the same litters were offered a normal or a fat-enriched diet for 4 weeks between 140 and 169 days of age and were then slaughtered. Amoxicillin treatment transiently modified both mother and offspring microbiota. This was associated with early but transient reduction in ileal alkaline phosphatase, HSP 70 (but not HSP 27) and crypt depth, suggesting a milder or delayed intestinal response to bacteria in offspring born to antibiotic-treated mothers. More importantly, we disclosed long-term consequences of this treatment on jejunal alkaline phosphatase (reduced) and jejunal and ileal dipeptidylpeptidase IV (increased and decreased, respectively) of offspring born to antibiotic-treated dams.

To help ameliorate this circumstance, top predators are being tracked to identify important ocean habitats, biodiversity hotspots and high risk areas and <b>to</b> <b>assess</b> effects of anthropogenic developments, pollution and environmental perturbations. We used GPS, Global Location Sensors (GLSs) and satellite platform terminal transmitters (PTTs) to track foraging and migrating thick-billed and common murres and northern gannets along with vessel surveys to identify potential Marine Protected Areas, <b>to</b> <b>assess</b> risk and <b>to</b> <b>evaluate</b> {{the consequences of the}} recent Gulf of Mexico oil disaster. Multi-year persistent sites of forage fishes generated multi-species predator aggregations. Species- and colony-specific winter inshore and offshore distributions of murres are associated with risks of climate change (ice), by-catch in fishing gear, hunting and oil extraction. Some thick-billed murres wintered in oceanic areas beyond the continental slope, and an area of high biological diversity was identified west of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge that, owing to its location beyond national jurisdictions, presents unique challenges for protection. Migration research indicated a substantial proportion of the North American gannet population wintering in the Gulf of Mexico near the Deepwater Horizon pollution area. Northern gannets incurred the highest incidence of oiling/recoveries and were the third-most oiled avian species; distributions and exit dates suggest that sub-adult birds suffered much, likely most, of this mortality. Environmental risk is being assessed by tracking combined with stable isotope and blood assays to probe trophic interactions, habitat relationships and to identify and protect biologically significant marine areas...|$|R
40|$|Medical {{education}} faces ever-increasing demands: larger {{amounts of}} knowledge {{have to be}} taught to larger student numbers in a time- and cost-effective manner. Therefore, new media have gained respect and raised high expectations, due to their obvious advantages. Hence, {{the aim of this}} study was to develop a standardised instrument, which allows for valid assessment of parameters relevant for the evaluation of computer-based learning (CBL). The main emphasis was placed on the overall acceptance of CBL as well as on some pertinent characteristics of individual learners. We took this as an example to systematically describe the construction of a questionnaire, focussing on the methodological and scientific aspects of this multi-step process. A first version, which was constructed on theoretical grounds, was analysed and revised using standard pretest conditions (n= 18). The second revision was done using a cognitive pretest-technique, called "Think-Aloud" (n= 10). After this qualitative evaluation, the questionnaire was offered to a representative sample of n= 328 third-year medical students. In this quantitative analysis, 12 valid psychometric scales could be confirmed by factor analysis. Reliability analysis yielded satisfying values (a= 0. 71 - 0. 91) in 10 cases: 5 scales on learner properties, 2 scales on learning strategies, one scale on the attitude towards CBL and 2 scales on expectations regarding CBL. For 2 scales (a= 0. 66 - 0. 67), we identified a need for further revision in order to improve accuracy. The described questionnaire provides a valid, quantitative means <b>to</b> <b>assess</b> relevant parameters <b>to</b> <b>evaluate</b> CBL interventions...|$|R
40|$|Background Endothelial {{nitric oxide}} synthase (eNOS) -uncoupling links obesity-associated insulin {{resistance}} and type-II diabetes to the increased incidence of cardiovascular disease. Studies have indicated that increased arginase is involved in eNOS-uncoupling through competing with the substrate L-arginine. Given that arginase-II (Arg-II) exerts some of its biological functions through crosstalk with signal transduction pathways, and that p 38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p 38 mapk) is involved in eNOS-uncoupling, we investigated here whether p 38 mapk is involved in Arg-II-mediated eNOS-uncoupling in a high fat diet (HFD) -induced obesity mouse model. Methods Obesity was induced in wild type (WT) and Arg-II-deficient (Arg-II -/-) mice on C 57 BL/ 6  J background by high-fat diet (HFD, 55 % fat) for 14  weeks starting from age of 7  weeks. The entire aortas were isolated and subjected to 1) immunoblotting analysis of the protein level of eNOS, Arg-II and p 38 mapk activation; 2) arginase activity assay; 3) endothelium-dependent and independent vasomotor responses; 4) en face staining of superoxide anion and NO production with Dihydroethidium and 4, 5 -Diaminofluorescein Diacetate, respectively, <b>to</b> <b>assess</b> eNOS-uncoupling. <b>To</b> <b>evaluate</b> the role of p 38 mapk, isolated aortas were treated with p 38 mapk inhibitor SB 203580 (10  μmol/L, 1  h) prior to the analysis. In addition, the role of p 38 mapk in Arg-II-induced eNOS-uncoupling was investigated in cultured human endothelial cells overexpressing Arg-II in the absence or presence of shRNA against p 38 mapk. Results HFD enhanced Arg-II expression/activity and p 38 mapk activity, which was associated with eNOS-uncoupling as revealed by decreased NO and enhanced L-NAME-inhibitable superoxide in aortas of WT obese mice. In accordance, WT obese mice revealed decreased endothelium-dependent relaxations to acetylcholine despite of higher eNOS protein level, whereas Arg-II -/- obese mice were protected from HFD-induced eNOS-uncoupling and endothelial dysfunction, which was associated with reduced p 38 mapk activation in aortas of the Arg-II -/- obese mice. Moreover, overexpression of Arg-II in human endothelial cells caused eNOS-uncoupling and augmented p 38 mapk activation. The Arg-II-induced eNOS-uncoupling was prevented by silencing p 38 mapk. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of p 38 mapk recouples eNOS in isolated aortas from WT obese mice. Conclusions Taking together, we demonstrate {{here for the first}} time that Arg-II causes eNOS-uncoupling through activation of p 38 mapk in HFD-induced obesity...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – This paper leverages {{the concept}} of {{business}} information intensity (BII) {{with the aim of}} developing a model <b>to</b> <b>assess</b> control deficiency risk (CDR) in organizations. BII measures the extent of use of IT by an organization in its products and value chain. Design/methodology/approach – The paper develops a conceptual model that uses BII and CDR to examine alternative approaches to risk management. This model contains four quadrants that provide insight into varying risk management strategies for business processes. CFOs and internal auditors from Fortune 100 companies are surveyed to illustrate how the model may be used <b>to</b> guide management in <b>assessing</b> IT security expenditure. Findings – The model suggests that spending on IT and information security is higher for companies with high BII-CDR than those with low BII-CDR. Research limitations/implications – Analysis focused on only two quadrants in a four-quadrant model. Future research may seek to refine the measurement of BII and CDR, and offer greater insight into the types of business processes that fall into each of the four quadrants as well as those that do not fit neatly into those quadrants. Practical implications – Organizations may use the BII-CDR model <b>to</b> <b>assess</b> risk and <b>to</b> <b>evaluate</b> investments in IT security and other control activities. The model also highlights the need to redefine {{the concept of}} materiality and to consider its link to BII and CDR. Auditors should consider the interaction of BII and CDR in planning the audit, conducting field work, and managing overall audit risk. Originality/value – The paper provides original insights into the relationship between BII and CDR and its implications for treatment of materiality. It was observed that activities which support critical business processes are themselves critical. This is an important departure from traditional approaches <b>to</b> <b>evaluating</b> materiality.

40|$|Unemployment {{is a big}} {{economical}} {{and social}} issue for each country, in particular for Albania, which {{is a country that}} comes from a centralized system where the state ensured full employment. In the struggle of applying the transition to market economy, each government had to face the two-digit levels of unemployment. Because of this, the application of the right policies in order to decrease the level of unemployment has been in the centre of the program of each government in Albania. The objective {{of this paper is to}} show if the undervaluation or overvaluation of the real exchange rate can affect in a significant way the level of employment in Albania and that to answer the question, if the real exchange rate can be used as a political instrument for the reduction of the level of unemployment. There are relatively few works that study the impact of real exchange rate on the Albanian economy and in my knowledge there is not a previous work on employment and real exchange rate relationship in Albania, so this can be considered as the first study that attempt <b>to</b> <b>assess</b> this relationship. <b>To</b> <b>evaluate</b> the link between the real exchange rate and the level of employment the Johansen procedure and Vector Error Correction Term method is used. The result of the study demonstrates not statistically significant impact of real exchange rate on level of employment, suggesting that the increase of competition of the country through the real exchange rate doesn’t improve the condition of the employment in Albania, so the Albanian government should implement other strategies to increase the level of employment in the country...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Diabetes in {{pregnancy}} {{may result in}} unfavourable maternal and neonatal outcomes. Exercise was proposed as an additional strategy to improve glycaemic control. The effect of exercise during pregnancies complicated by diabetes needs <b>to</b> be <b>assessed.</b> OBJECTIVES: <b>To</b> <b>evaluate</b> the effect of exercise programs, alone or {{in conjunction with other}} therapies, compared to no specific program or to other therapies, in pregnant women with diabetes on perinatal and maternal morbidity and on the frequency of prescription of insulin to control glycaemia. To compare the effectiveness of different types of exercise programs on perinatal and maternal morbidity. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 December 2005). SELECTION CRITERIA: All known randomised controlled trials evaluating the effect of exercise in diabetic pregnant women on perinatal outcome and maternal morbidity. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We evaluated relevant studies for meeting the inclusion criteria and methodological quality. Three review authors abstracted the data. For all data analyses, we entered data based on the principle of intention to treat. We calculated relative risks and 95 % confidence intervals for dichotomous data. MAIN RESULTS: Four trials, involving 114 pregnant women with gestational diabetes, were included in the review. None included pregnant women with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Women were recruited during the third trimester and the intervention was performed for about six weeks. The programs generally consisted in exercising three times a week for 20 to 45 minutes. We found no significant difference between exercise and the other regimen in all the outcomes evaluated. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is insufficient evidence to recommend, or advise against, diabetic pregnant women to enrol in exercise programs. Further trials, with larger sample size, involving women with gestational diabetes, and possibly type 1 and 2 diabetes, are needed <b>to</b> <b>evaluate</b> this intervention.

40|$|Background: The Healthier Scotland Cooking Bus (HSCB) was {{launched}} in 2008 following the Scottish Government’s plan to improve diet, increase physical activity and tackle obesity. It is a mobile kitchen, {{in the form of}} an articulated truck, which visits schools and local communities. It provides cooking sessions for students, healthy eating advice, teaching resources, cooking equipment and continuing professional development (CPD) courses for teachers. Continuous evaluation of nutritional education programmes is essential to allow the impact of the programme <b>to</b> be <b>assessed.</b> Aim: <b>To</b> <b>evaluate</b> the CPD sessions of the HSCB and assess how effective they are. Design: Pre and Post-Surveys currently employed by the HSCB were used to collect a combination of quantitative and qualitative data about the session. Additional questions were developed and added to these surveys <b>to</b> <b>evaluate</b> how effective they were at collecting the relevant data. Results: The CPD session was found to increase confidence in a variety of topics concerning teaching, cooking and nutrition. When the pre and post-surveys were evaluated, the participants’ view of the importance of cooking education had significantly increased (p= 0. 011). Significant increases in confidence in various aspects of teaching cooking were also found (p< 0. 05). For example, teaching how to use cooking equipment, teaching about food hygiene, food preparation and cooking skills, adapting recipes to make them healthier, coordinating cooking lessons for different age groups/experience levels, coordinating cooking/preparing a variety of healthy recipes, planning, setting up and leading cooking activities, linking cooking education to other areas of the curriculum and developing cooking education. Conclusion: The Healthier Scotland Cooking Bus was successful in increasing confidence in a variety of cooking skills and health education. The surveys were also found to be suitable in collecting the relevant evaluation information about the CPD sessions. Key words: Health, Nutrition, Cooking, Education, Scotland, Evaluation...|$|R
40|$|Pneumococcal {{diseases}} {{have high}} mortality and morbidity worldwide, and they present in two major clinical manifestations: 1) pneumococcal pneumonia, {{which is the}} most common manifestation and 2) invasive pneumococcal disease that is less frequent but more often fatal. Pneumococcal diseases disproportionately affect young children and the elderly. The population of Arkansas is highly vulnerable due to high rates of chronic diseases, a rapidly aging population and low adult vaccinations rates. This dissertation aims at understanding the epidemiology of adult pneumococcal pneumonia and adult invasive pneumococcal disease in the state of Arkansas during the past 14 years to inform future immunization program improvement. Additionally, the sensitivity and completeness of the adult invasive pneumococcal disease surveillance system during 2003 <b>to</b> 2013 were <b>assessed</b> <b>to</b> <b>evaluate</b> the usefulness of surveillance data in informing immunization planning. Records of adult pneumococcal pneumonia and invasive pneumococcal disease cases with de-identified demographic information were extracted from hospital discharge data. Overall and subpopulation trends were evaluated using generalized linear models. Pneumococcal pneumonia trends displayed a gradual annual percent decline of 5. 07 % per year (95 % CI: 3. 53, 6. 95) from 2000 to 2009. The decline became more pronounced from 2010 to 2013 at 19. 10 % per year (95 % CI: 14. 10, 23. 51). On the other hand, the IPD trends showed a small annual percent increment of 3. 66 % per year (95 % CI: 2. 02, 4. 92) from 2000 to 2009, followed by a decline of 11. 31 % per year (95 % CI: 15. 46, 6. 57) from 2010 to 2013. Subpopulation trends showed similar trend patterns. These results highlight the indirect effects of the introduction of childhood vaccinations PCV 7 in 2000 and PCV 13 in 2010 on the reduction of the pneumococcal disease burden among adults. The surveillance system assessment revealed its low capacity for capturing adult invasive pneumococcal disease cases. However, a significant improvement in the sensitivity and data quality was observed over time, especially after the implementation of the web-based National Electronic Disease Surveillance System...|$|R
40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: The {{proportion}} of diabetic patients undergoing haemodialysis is rapidly increasing. Glucose control among such patients is difficult <b>to</b> <b>assess.</b> We aimed <b>to</b> <b>evaluate</b> the clinical {{performance of a}} continuous glucose monitoring system (CGMS) in type 2 diabetic patients on chronic haemodialysis. METHODS: We used a 4 -day CGMS to monitor glucose levels in 19 haemodialysed type 2 diabetic patients (HD T 2) including 2 days with and 2 days without dialysis session, and 39 non-HD T 2 in a double-centre study. RESULTS: The glucose concentration according to the glucose meter and CGMS were correlated in HD T 2 patients (r = 0. 90, P < 0. 0001) and in non-HD T 2 patients (r = 0. 81, P < 0. 0001). The relative absolute difference (RAD) between glucose determined by a glucose meter and glucose determined by the CGMS did not differ between HD T 2 and non-HD T 2 patients (9. 2 +/- 10. 5 vs. 8. 2 +/- 7. 6 %; P = 0. 165). Glycated haemoglobin (A 1 c) and mean glucose concentration were strongly correlated in non-HD T 2 patients (r = 0. 71; P < 0. 0001) but weakly correlated in HD T 2 patients (r = 0. 47; P = 0. 042). Fructosamine was correlated with the mean glucose concentration in non-HD T 2 (r = 0. 67; P < 0. 0001) but not in HD T 2 patients (r = 0. 04; P = 0. 88). CONCLUSION: CGM is a validated marker of glycaemic control in HD diabetic patients. This tool showed that A 1 c and fructosamine, despite being good markers of glycaemic control in non-HD diabetic patients, are of poor value in HD diabetic patients...|$|R
