5|$|After the 2014 race {{had been}} held at a resurfaced circuit, causing the teams to fight with the soft tyre choice by Pirelli, speculations arose if drivers {{would be able to}} {{challenge}} the eleven-year old track record set by Rubens Barrichello in 2004. However, practice showed that lap times actually slowed due to changes to the kerbs, forcing the drivers to stay away from <b>the</b> <b>insides</b> of the corners. Pirelli chose the soft and medium compounds for the event.|$|E
5|$|All slow loris species {{produce a}} toxin in glands on <b>the</b> <b>insides</b> of their elbows. This is spread across {{their bodies and}} those of their {{offspring}} using the toothcomb while grooming. When threatened with predators, the Sunda slow loris can bite, roll into a ball exposing its toxic saliva-covered fur, or roll up and drop from the trees. However, the primary method of predator avoidance is crypsis, whereby it hides. The Asiatic reticulated python, the changeable hawk-eagle and the Bornean orangutan have been recorded as predators of the Sunda slow loris.|$|E
5|$|Slender {{with thin}} legs {{and a short}} tail, the four-horned {{antelope}} has a yellowish brown to reddish coat. The underparts and <b>the</b> <b>insides</b> of the legs are white. Facial features include black markings on the muzzle and behind the ears. A black stripe marks the outer surface of each leg. Females have four teats far back on the abdomen. The hair feels coarse, more {{like that of a}} deer than the glossy hair typical of antelopes. The fetlocks are marked with white patches.|$|E

5|$|Another {{method of}} {{increasing}} firepower was to vary the projectile fired or {{the nature of}} the propellant. Early ironclads used black powder, which expanded rapidly after combustion; this meant cannons had relatively short barrels, to prevent the barrel itself slowing the shell. The sharpness of the black powder explosion also meant that guns were subjected to extreme stress. One important step was to press the powder into pellets, allowing a slower, more controlled explosion and a longer barrel. A further step forward was the introduction of chemically different brown powder which combusted more slowly again. It also put less stress on <b>the</b> <b>insides</b> of the barrel, allowing guns to last longer and to be manufactured to tighter tolerances.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to playing the game, Adams {{was involved in}} the production of early baseball equipment. He personally manufactured baseballs for a period of time, supplying many New York City-based clubs. Adams found that when the ball was more tightly stitched, it traveled further when batted or thrown. According to author Peter Morris, Adams' ball-manufacturing efforts helped to keep the Knickerbockers in operation during their first few years, as they would otherwise have had difficulty finding balls. In later years Adams gathered rubber from old galoshes for <b>the</b> <b>insides</b> of baseballs. A tanner then used horsehide to create the balls. As late as 1863, Adams was one of the three most prominent makers of baseballs in New York, continuing to produce them by hand. Adams also played a role in producing baseball bats, choosing which wood to use and overseeing the manufacturing process.|$|E
5|$|The white fur on {{the chin}} and around the eyes is in sharp {{contrast}} with the black stripes on the face. The coat of males shows two-tone colouration: while the upper parts and outsides of the legs are dark brown to black, the underparts and <b>the</b> <b>insides</b> of the legs are all white. Darkness typically increases as the male ages. On the other hand, females and juveniles are yellowish fawn to tan. In Texas, blackbuck moult in spring, following which the males look notably lighter, though darkness persists on the face and the legs. On the contrary, males will grow darker as the breeding season approaches. Both melanism and albinism have been observed in wild blackbuck. Albino blackbuck are often zoo attractions as in the Indira Gandhi Zoological Park (Andhra Pradesh, India).|$|E
25|$|Aids:To {{ask for the}} depart, {{the rider}} adds <b>the</b> <b>inside</b> leg near <b>the</b> girth, pushes {{slightly}} with <b>the</b> <b>inside</b> seat bone, and uses inside direct rein to indicate the direction of travel.

40|$|Section II {{indicated}} that (a) wood is extremely unstable materials for sculpture and (b) <b>the</b> <b>inside</b> boring technique is {{very effective in}} the prevention of splitting wood, making the best condition of materials, and finishing the beautiful sculpture. Section III considered the period characteristics of <b>the</b> <b>inside</b> boring structure and its expressive effectiveness in the change of the Buddha sculpture techniques, and indicated effectiveness of <b>the</b> <b>inside</b> boring technique. Section IV checked and considered <b>the</b> <b>inside</b> boring structure of the Jikokuten and the Zochouten Buddhas(produced around the 10 th century) in the Konin Temple from a wooden sculptor's point of view. Section V investigated the significance of <b>the</b> <b>inside</b> boring technique in the modern sculpture. Because <b>the</b> <b>inside</b> boring is an excellent technique to prevent splitting wood, the beautiful and invigorating sclupture will be produced by the integrating use of <b>the</b> <b>inside</b> boring and other effective techniques. Thus wood is one of the very important materlals for sculpture. Section Ⅵ attempted to apply <b>the</b> <b>inside</b> boring technique to a wooden sculptural work. The intentions and processes of production were reported with many relevant photographs...|$|R

25|$|Aids: The rider {{applies the}} outside leg {{slightly}} further back from its neutral position, thereby activating the horse's outside hind leg, while adding <b>the</b> <b>inside</b> rein aid {{to indicate the}} direction of travel. This technique is later refined, first asking with the outside leg aid before adding <b>the</b> <b>inside</b> rein and a push with <b>the</b> <b>inside</b> seat bone. <b>The</b> refined sequence usually makes for a quicker and more balanced depart, and prepares the horse for use of <b>the</b> <b>inside</b> lateral aids.|$|R

25|$|Snap front/legs : Some sleepers, {{especially}} in infant sizes, replace the usual front zipper with a front opening closing with snap fasteners. In infant sizes, this opening usually forks at the crotch, and extends down <b>the</b> <b>insides</b> of both legs to the ankles, {{in order to}} give access for diaper changes. This design tends to be less effective at eliminating drafts than the zipper closure, and is most often seen on lighter-weight sleepers designed for warmer weather.|$|E
50|$|To ask for {{the turn}} on the haunches, the rider must {{coordinate}} several aids at once. The outside leg prevents the hindquarters from swinging out, the outside rein maintains a correct bend to <b>the</b> <b>inside,</b> and helps to regulate the driving aids, telling the horse to turn rather than walk forward. <b>The</b> <b>inside</b> leg asks <b>the</b> horse to bend to <b>the</b> <b>inside,</b> pushes <b>the</b> energy into the outside aids, and keeps the activity of <b>the</b> hindquarters. <b>The</b> <b>inside</b> seatbone should be engaged, again to ask the horse to bend {{in the direction of}} the turn, and <b>the</b> <b>inside</b> rein should help lead the forehand around and also remind the horse to bend {{in the direction of the}} turn.|$|R

25|$|Henrique da Rocha Lima in 1916 then {{proved that}} the {{bacterium}} Rickettsia prowazekii was the agent responsible for typhus; he named it after H. T.

25|$|In {{the late}} 1960s through the 1970s, she {{abandoned}} painting, {{and focused on}} working in graphite pencil, creating highly detailed photorealistic drawings, based on photographs of natural elements such as the ocean's or moon's surface, <b>the</b> <b>insides</b> of shells, and closeups of rocks. Critics frequently compare her laborious approach to contemporaries Chuck Close and Gerhard Richter, and she has cited Giorgio Morandi, {{a master of the}} pale grey still life, as a major influence. These works also share with Richter's an apparent randomness and thus apparently dispassionate attitude. It is as if any photograph would do as a source for a painting, and the choice is apparently unimportant. This is of course not the case, but the work contains within it the impression that the image is chosen at random from an endless selection of possible alternative images of similar nature.|$|E
