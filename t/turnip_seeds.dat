40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the thermodynamic properties of the process of water sorption in forage <b>turnip</b> <b>seeds.</b> The equilibrium moisture content of forage <b>turnip</b> <b>seeds</b> was determined by the gravimetric-dynamic method for different values of temperature and water activity. According to the results, increasing the moisture content increases the energy required for the evaporation of water in forage <b>turnip</b> <b>seeds,</b> and the values of integral isosteric heat of desorption, within the moisture content range of 3. 33 to 11. 30 (% d. b.), varies from 4, 222. 70 to 2, 870. 34 kJ kg- 1. With the elevation in the equilibrium moisture content, there is an increase in differential entropy and Gibbs free energy, which has positive values, demonstrating non-spontaneity in the process of desorption in the seeds. The theory of enthalpy-entropy compensation can be satisfactorily applied to the sorption phenomenon, and the process of water desorption of forage <b>turnip</b> <b>seeds</b> is controlled by enthalpy...|$|E

However, studies reporting irrigation with magnetically treated water are scanty. Therefore, the effect of irrigation with magnetically treated water on <b>turnip</b> <b>seed</b> germination, seedling growth and enzymatic activities was evaluated. The tap water was treated at 211  mT for 30, 45 and 60  min and used for irrigation of <b>turnip</b> <b>seed</b> and seedlings. Uniform and healthy <b>turnip</b> <b>seed</b> was sown under randomized complete block design (RCBD). The germination, emergence rate index, vigor index I and vigor index II increased up to 28. 33 %, 11. 54 %, 57. 59 % and 32. 26 %, respectively. The growth parameters such as seedling lengths, fresh & dry weights, chlorophyll content were also enhanced in response of irrigation with magnetically treated water. The seedlings irrigated with magnetically treated water showed 28. 92 %, 11. 36 % and 14. 76 % higher protein content, alpha amylase and protease activities, respectively vs control. Results revealed that irrigation with magnetically treated water has potential to improve turnip germination, seedling growth and enzymatic activities and this study is also extendable to other vegetables and crops {{for the improvement of}} germination and growth...|$|R

40|$|Most {{studies in}} soil {{ecotoxicology}} {{are designed to}} assess the effects of individual chemicals on individual test species, using a reference soil (e. g. LUFA 2. 2, OECD soil). There is therefore an urgent need for a more comprehensive and integrated approach {{in order to assess}} the impact of chemical pollutants on soil ecosystems. In this study, a more realistic scenario in ecotoxicity evaluation was achieved through the use of microcosm-based experiments, using a small-scale terrestrial ecosystem ("STEM") containing Mediterranean agricultural soil. Earthworms (Eisenia andrei) and <b>turnip</b> <b>seeds</b> (Brassica rapa) were introduced into the microcosms, in order to examine the effects of the acaricide spirodiclofen and the insecticide dimethoate, both in single and binary combination exposures. Results showed that for plants and earthworms the recommended application dose of both pesticides did not cause impairment of growth, although increasing concentrations resulted in a biomass decrease for both species. Earthworms were found to alter their depth distribution as a response to the combined application of the two pesticides, with this parameter being more sensitive than body mass. The various binary mixtures tested resulted in antagonistic effects on B. rapa shoot length and fresh weight. Regarding the depth distribution of earthworms, antagonism was observed at field dose, as well as at five times the field dose for both pesticides, while synergism occurred at ten times the field dose.

40|$|In {{the present}} work a {{small-scale}} terrestrial ecosystem (STEM) containing a soil collected from an agricultural field in Central Portugal {{was used to}} evaluate the effects of the combination of the herbicide glyphosate and the insecticide dimethoate. Earthworms (Eisenia andrei), isopods (Porcellionides pruinosus), <b>turnip</b> <b>seeds</b> (Brassica rapa), and bait-lamina strips were placed in the STEM. The results showed that the application of the recommended field dose of both pesticides did not cause any effect on the weight variation of earthworms and growth of the plants. The application of the herbicide, even at 5 and 10 times the field dose, increased feeding activity in soil (bait-lamina test), although the application of dimethoate led to a decrease in feeding activity in all concentrations tested. The binary mixtures performed showed that according to the Independent Action model, synergism (higher effect than expected from the single exposures) was observed in both the shoot length and fresh weight of B. rapa at 5 times the field dose, but antagonism was observed at 10 times the field dose. Regarding the germination success, synergism was observed at the field dose, but antagonism was detected at 5 times and 10 times the field dose. There was a decrease on the earthworm's weight in all concentrations tested, although no statistical differences were observed in any of the treatments made. Regarding depth distribution of E. andrei, worms were found in the upper layer more than it was predicted for all concentrations. In the mixtures with the field and 5 times the field dose there was a decrease in the feeding activity (bait-lamina consumption) by the soil fauna. From the four biomarkers assessed on the isopods (Catalase, Acetylcholinesterase, Glutathione-S-transferase, and Lipid peroxidation), only a significant decrease in the Acetylcholinesterase activity upon dimethoate and the binary mixtures exposures performed with the field dose was observed and on Lipid peroxidation at the field doses of single and binary exposures.

In the first letter, Henry notes that he has {{received}} Charles' letter and that all is well. He details a terrible nose bleed he experienced and mentions that Sabina went on a trip with George and Serena to Hunt Co. Henry discusses the success of a camp meeting, the prohibition boom, and details on the politics of the prohibition party. He furthers this discussion by noting the politics of the democratic and saloonist party, and how these parties affect the chances of victory for the prohibition party. The conversation moves on from politics to a brief note on the weather and then moves to a letter which was sent from E. E. Barnard regarding a comet. Barnard details in his letter the approximate location the comet could be found in the night sky but fears that once the moon moves out of the way, it will be difficult, almost impossible, to view it. He updates Charles on news on family, friends,the community,and agricultural endeavors such as the purchase of land, the condition of cattle and crops as well as the price of wheat. In the second letter, dated August 25, 1885, Henry updates Charles on the weather and informs him that he has planted <b>turnip</b> <b>seeds,</b> but does not have any hopes for a abundant harvest. He states the the prohibition party intends to publish a newspaper. Henry mentions the papers that are published and publication's political affiliation. The topic of the discussion continues with politics and Henry tells Charles that the prohibition party may have some affect with the democratic majority currently in Texas. He details that a family friends has returned from a trip to Eureka Springs, Arkansas. Henry informs Charles about news regarding the community, political affiliations of friends, and preparations the prohibitionist party are taking to ensure that they receive votes from all races.

The manures are well described; bat no new substance is added to former lists, only hoofs come very near to the knowledge of bones. Of lime the author thinks that calcination sets free and enables to act a balsamic alkaline salt that is coagulated in the crude stone or chalk, and till the acid barren quality is evaporated by tire, the salts in them are of little or no signification to the land.

40|$|Cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) is {{transmitted}} to crucifers in a noncirculative manner by several aphid species.

In the present work, {{we used the}} electrical penetration graph technique to study the specific aphid stylet activities and behavioral events leading to the inoculation of CaMV to turnip plants by its two major vectors, Brevicoryne brassicae (L.) and Myzus persicae (Sulzer). Aphids subjected to an 8 -h acquisition access time on infected plants were transferred to test plants and removed immediately after specific behavioral events were recorded. CaMV was readily inoculated after the first intracellular puncture in nonvascular tissues by both vector species. Inoculation rate of CaMV by B. brassicae was the highest after a 3 -h inoculation access period, regardless of whether aphids had reached the phloem phase during that period. Consistent interspecific differences also {{were found in the}} ability of both aphid vectors to retain CaMV. B. brassicae could retain the virus after several intracellular punctures, whereas M. persicae readily lost the virus after performing the same number of intracellular stylet punctures. We concluded that salivation by aphids during successive intracellular stylet punctures in the epidermal and mesophyll cells before reaching the phloem phase are the key behavioral events associated to the inoculation of Cauliflower mosaic virus. The likely location of the viral retention site inside the aphid mouthparts is discussed.

40|$|The {{presence}} of three B. rapa {{forms in the}} UK {{provides an opportunity for}} a unique study of the relationships between cultivated B. rapa, and weedy and wild derived from them - the escape from cultivation. A range of morphological characters have been studied along with the DNA markers, AFLP and microsatellites, using the same plant material. Morphological characters discriminated between wild, weedy and cultivated forms of B. rapa. Within the cultivated group, the morphological analysis separates B. rapa var oleifera winter and spring <b>turnip</b> oil <b>seed</b> rape varieties. B. rapa var rapa stubble turnip varieties are separated from root turnip. Based on morphological analysis wild and weedy groups are differentiated, but this is not supported by AFLP analysis. AFLPs, as neutral markers, reflect the agricultural histories of B. rapa cultivars. All B. rapa var. rapa and var. oleifera cultivars clustered together in principal co-ordinate plots, although two accessions of vars. rapa clustered with wild and weedy forms (traditional cultivars, ‘Hardy Green Round’ and ‘Lincolnshire Red Globe’). Significant levels of genetic variation was observed in all B. rapa accessions. Genetic evidence indicates that weedy B. rapa is derived from wild plants not directly from cultivars. The microsatellite analysis indicated significant distinctions in allele frequency between wild, weedy and cultivated forms. The population structure of cultivated and weedy B. rapa was distinct from the wild group, with much enhanced homozygosity. Inbreeding and founder effects may be important factors here. Some plants of wild B. rapa growing adjacent to B. napus show intermediate DNA and morphological phenotypes. This indicates natural hybridisation and backcrossing.

40|$|Rye is an {{important}} cereal crop {{which can be used}} as a winterhard and well adopted to Poland’s natural conditions cover plant (Borowy et al. 1998). Several authors observed its allelopathic activity in laboratory and field studies (Barnes et al. 1986, Oleszek 1995). The aim of this work was to compare the growth of weeds on no-tilled plots covered with rye mulch and on conventionally tilled plots in a field experiment conducted in the south-eastern part of Poland. Rye was seeded at the rate of 140 kg·ha- 1 on half of the field in the middle of September in the years 1997 - 1999. Following year, in the beginning of May it was sprayed with glyphosate 1440 g a. i. ·ha- 1 plus adjuvant. At that time the rye plants reached 80 - 90 cm height and average fresh weight of their aerial parts and roots was 3, 1 and 0, 8 kg·m- 2 respectively. After two weeks the seeds of snap bean, carrot, cucumber, red beet and <b>turnip</b> were <b>seeded</b> and transplants of cabbage, leek, celeriac and tomato were planted on the half of the field covered with rye mulch and also on second half of the field which had been tilled conventionally. Each vegetable species was planted in 4 succeeding 6 -m-long rows, with interrow distances of 0, 75 m (1, 5 m in the case of cucumber). Weeds were counted by species in four 0, 25 m x 0, 4 m frames placed randomly in each interrow space and then the plots were weeded by hand 3 and 7 weeks after planting. Moreover, at the end of the experiment in the middle of Septembe...|$|R
