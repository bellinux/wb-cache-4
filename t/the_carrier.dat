5|$|After {{winning a}} clear victory, and as pursuit became too {{hazardous}} near Wake, American forces retired. Spruance once again withdrew {{to the east}} to refuel his destroyers and rendezvous with <b>the</b> <b>carrier</b> Saratoga, which was ferrying much-needed replacement aircraft.

For the remainder of that day and then 9 June, Fletcher continued to launch search missions from the three carriers to ensure the Japanese were no longer advancing on Midway. Late on 10 June a decision was made to leave the area and the American carriers eventually returned to Pearl Harbor.|$|E
5|$|Also in {{the early}} 1960s, <b>the</b> <b>carrier</b> {{provided}} some initial aviation support to the Ethiopia-United States Mapping Mission in its operation to acquire topographic maps of Ethiopia. The firm changed from a corporation to a share company in 1965, and changed its name from Ethiopian Air Lines to Ethiopian Airlines. By 1966, the contractual relationship with TWA was adjusted to reflect the transfer of management with the appointment of an Ethiopian deputy general manager. Two Boeing 720s were in operation and a Boeing 707-320C was due to be phased in by , when <b>the</b> <b>carrier</b> ordered a second -320C.|$|E
30|$|In the smectic phase, the {{increase}} of the nanoparticle concentration brings additional traps for <b>the</b> <b>carriers,</b> which travel in plane of the cation-anion layers.

50|$|The {{effect of}} ionized {{impurity}} scattering, however, decreases with increasing temperature because the average thermal speeds of <b>the</b> <b>carriers</b> are increased.

5|$|As Melbourne was {{the only}} ship of her size (both in {{dimensions}} and ship's company) in the RAN, <b>the</b> <b>carrier</b> underwent a regular rotation of commanding officers to give them experience. Commanding officers were changed on average every fifteen months, with few remaining on board {{for more than two}} years. The majority of Melbournes commanders later reached flag rank. <b>The</b> <b>carrier</b> was also called on to perform underway replenishments and command and control functions.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} March 1978, Melbourne left Sydney for RIMPAC 78. During this exercise, Melbourne {{acquired}} the nickname 'Little M' after working with 'Big E' —the smallest and largest aircraft carriers (respectively) in operation at the time. On return in July, <b>the</b> <b>carrier</b> entered a major refit, which continued until 3 August 1979. During this refit, on 3 March, a boiler explosion caused minor damage to <b>the</b> <b>carrier.</b> The remainder of the year involved participation in three exercises, Tasmanex off Wellington, New Zealand, Sea Eagle I in the Tasman Sea, and Kangaroo III in the Coral Sea. During Tasmanex, Melbourne lost her LW-02 radar aerial and a Skyhawk, both of which fell overboard during heavy seas.|$|E
5|$|By this point, the British {{high command}} had {{realised}} {{that they could}} not hold the Germans in southern Norway. The evacuation of Allied troops from Molde and Åndalsnes began, with Ark Royal providing air cover from 30 April. On 1 May, the Germans tried to sink <b>the</b> <b>carrier,</b> with numerous air attacks through the day. Ark Royals fighters and a heavy anti-aircraft barrage drove off the enemy, and although several bombs were dropped at <b>the</b> <b>carrier,</b> none impacted. The evacuation was completed on 3 May, and <b>the</b> <b>carrier</b> was recalled to Scapa Flow to refuel and rearm before returning to Norway. While in port, Captain Arthur Power left the ship for a promotion to the Admiralty, and was replaced by Captain Cedric Holland. On return to Norway, Ark Royal was told to provide air cover for operations around Narvik, including the landing of French troops on 13 May. She was joined on 18 May by the carriers Glorious and Furious.|$|E

5|$|During {{the last}} days of July and into early August, the Allied fleet sailed away from the Japanese coast to avoid a typhoon and allow the ships to {{replenish}} their stocks of fuel and ammunition. The fleet then sailed north and, on both 9 and 10 August, <b>the</b> <b>carrier</b> aircraft attacked a large concentration of Japanese aircraft on airfields in northern Honshu. <b>The</b> <b>carrier</b> pilots claimed the destruction of 720 Japanese aircraft in this operation.|$|E
5|$|Following her return, <b>the</b> <b>carrier</b> {{spent six}} months in Australian waters, before a two-month {{deployment}} to Southeast Asia. During this deployment, on 21 June 1981, Melbourne rescued 99 Vietnamese refugees from a disabled fishing vessel in the South China Sea. The carrier's deployments {{for the second half}} of the year consisted of two exercises, Sea Hawk and Kangaroo 81. A major refit scheduled to begin in late 1981 was postponed pending the decision on a replacement carrier. After docking at Garden Island in December, <b>the</b> <b>carrier</b> was accidentally flooded by an officer who was impatient to commence leave. In his haste to shut down <b>the</b> <b>carrier,</b> he failed to deactivate the water pumps, and over 180tons of fresh water were pumped in before a maintenance party discovered the flooding the next day. Melbourne remained in dock at the start of 1982, and did not leave before the decision regarding her replacement was made.|$|E

50|$|The MBBR system {{consists}} of an aeration tank (similar to a activated sludge tank) with special plastic carriers that provide a surface where a biofilm can grow. <b>The</b> <b>carriers</b> are made of a material with a density close to the density of water (1 g/cm3). An example is high-density polyetylene (HDPE) which has a density close to 0.95 g/cm3. <b>The</b> <b>carriers</b> will be mixed in the tank by the aeration system and thus will have good contact between the substrate in the influent wastewater and the biomass on <b>the</b> <b>carriers.</b>|$|R
5|$|From March 1965 until mid-1967, Melbourne {{underwent}} a regular pattern of deployments to Southeast Asia, exercises, and flag-showing visits to {{nations in the}} Asia-Pacific region. Several of the Southeast Asian deployments {{were related to the}} Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation, and involved participation in show of force exercises off the coast of Malaysia. During 1965 and 1966, Melbourne escorted sister ship , which had been recommissioned as a troop transport, for short periods during the latter's first, third, and fourth transport voyages to Vietnam. Despite <b>the</b> <b>carrier</b> being the centrepiece of several plans to involve Australian forces in the Vietnam War, the escort runs were the extent of Melbournes participation in the conflict, and <b>the</b> <b>carrier</b> remained outside the Market Time area while Sydney and her other escorts proceeded to Vũng Tàu. As <b>the</b> <b>carrier</b> was optimised for anti-submarine warfare, there was little need for her {{at the start of the}} war. Utilising <b>the</b> <b>carrier</b> was suggested again by RAN officials in March 1966, when the United States Seventh Fleet was having difficulties maintaining anti-submarine patrols around Yankee Station, but Melbourne could only remain on station for a single, ten-day period, a third of the time that US carriers were operational for on rotating deployments. Seventh Fleet staff suggested in April 1967 that Melbourne deploy in the anti-submarine role, but nothing came of these talks. Consideration was also given to using Melbourne as a floating helicopter base, but only ten Wessex helicopters could be provided, and modifications were required for them to operate as troop carriers. Both options were made more prohibitive by the need to supply at least two escorts for <b>the</b> <b>carrier</b> at a time when the RAN was having difficulty meeting deployment commitments with the available destroyers and destroyer escorts.|$|E
