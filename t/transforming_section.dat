40|$|Summary: This paper {{describes}} the design, modeling, {{and testing of}} two portable timber bridges, each consisting of two non-interconnected longitudinal glued-laminated timber (glulam) deck panels 1. 8 m (6 ft) wide. One bridge is 12. 2 m (40 ft) long while the other bridge is 10. 7 m (35 ft) long. The deck panels are fabricated in a unique double-tee cross section. The bridges exhibited linear elastic behavior in static bending tests. When actual lumber property data were used in <b>transformed</b> <b>section</b> and finite element models, the models overpredicted the stiffness of the bridge panels. The <b>transformed</b> <b>section</b> results provided the best agreement with test results. The bridges were cost effective and although some damaged occurred to the bridge modules during their removal, they have functioned well overall.

40|$|Abstract. Natural fibres have {{recently}} raised attention for presenting adequate mechanical characteristics for the reinforcement of wood structural elements. The use of both natural fibres, in laminated beams and wood from reforestation, is {{in accordance with}} the current economic interest and sustainable appeal. This paper focuses on the analysis the viability of sisal fibre use, in wood laminated structures as a reinforcing material, taking three methods into consideration: Stress functions, Classical lamination theory and <b>Transformed</b> <b>section</b> method. The laminated beams were reinforced by sisal strips with a thickness of 2 mm and constituted by the species of wood: Pinus (Pinus sp). Each lamina has the following dimensions: width of 5 cm, height of 10 cm and length of 150 cm. It was noted that the differences between the results from the classical lamination theory and <b>transformed</b> <b>section</b> method were, in an average of 8 % and 5 % for normal and shear stresses respectively. The difference of 12 % for displacements is a normal result taking into account that the span used is considered high for this wood species. In relation to the stress function method, the differences are minimal, around less than 1 % for all analysis, i. e., normal and shear stresses and displacements. In general, the strengthening of wood laminated beams with sisal fibres is more effective for structures that are used only in wood structural elements, in which the elastic modulus is at least equal to these fibres...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{a method for}} estimating long-term deflections of reinforced concrete beams by considering creep and shrinkage effects separately.

The concept of effective moment of inertia is extended to predict initial-plus-creep deflections. Long-term deflections computed by the proposed method are compared with the experimental results available in the literature and with the values obtained by the ACI Code method. This comparison shows that for beams having span/thickness ratio greater than 25, the ACI Code method underestimates long-term deflections while the proposed method gives a better estimate with computed to measured deflections ratio equal to 1. 0...|$|R

5000|$|In {{structural}} engineering, {{composite construction}} exists when two different materials are bound together so strongly that they act {{together as a}} single unit from a structural point of view. When this occurs, it is called composite action. One common example involves steel beams supporting concrete floor slabs. [...] If the beam is not connected firmly to the slab, then the slab transfers all of its weight to the beam and the slab contributes nothing to the load carrying capability of the beam. However, if the slab is connected positively to the beam with studs, then {{a portion of the}} slab can be assumed to act compositely with the beam. In effect, this composite creates a larger and stronger beam than would be provided by the steel beam alone.

It is demonstrated that the standard <b>transform</b> <b>section</b> fails to provide accurate results when the elastic modulus ratio exceeds 20. So an alternate approach is formulated by using the rule of mixtures to determine a set of effective material properties for the composite. Tensile tests are conducted on composite samples to verify this approach; and, when the effective material properties are used to characterize the deflections of composite beams subject to pure bending, an excellent agreement is obtained. Laminated composite plate theory is also investigated as a means for analyzing even more complex composites, consisting of multiple graphite layers oriented in different directions. In this case, composite beams are analyzed by incorporating material properties established from tensile tests.
