60|$|MRS. ARBUTHNOT. I do not, Lady Hunstanton. I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>many</b> things {{women should}} never forgive.|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] {{said the}} man gravely. [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>many</b> ways {{in which he is}} right, but you can be content with Winston the prairie farmer?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I do {{not think}} so," [...] she wrote. [...] "I do not know much of the world, but I do not <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>many</b> people like you in it." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{remarked that}} I did not <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>many</b> runners, as the No. 3 shot had served me very well, {{and getting into}} the boat was rowed to the other side, where I {{received}} more congratulations. Then, as all further shooting {{was out of the}} question because of the weather, we walked back to the castle to tea.|$|R
50|$|Madeleine {{ran to the}} bastions. She knew <b>there</b> <b>was</b> {{only one}} hope. Madeleine fired a musket and {{encouraged}} the people to make as much noise as possible so that the Iroquois would <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>many</b> soldiers defending the fort. Then Madeleine fired the cannon to warn other forts of an attack and to call for reinforcements. The Iroquois had hoped a surprise attack would easily take over the fort, so for a moment, they retreated into the bushes with their prisoners.|$|R
50|$|James Ha {{has lived}} on Hong Kong Island {{for a long}} time and he loves playing {{football}} for leisure in Victoria Park, Causeway Bay. He <b>thinks</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>many</b> top players in Victoria Park and he learnt a lot of skills and sense of soccer in the park. Recently, Victoria Park is always closed for special events so he goes to the park in low frequency now. Besides football, Ha is a rugby player and won the HKFSS Inter-School Rugby Competition in 2011.|$|R
6000|$|... "I expect so," [...] said Seaforth dryly. [...] "Harry {{does not}} usually let trifles {{of that kind}} worry him, nor do I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>many</b> men who would have ridden at that fence." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>many</b> too many," [...] he said. [...] "What {{with the}} tax on sheep, and the tax on cows, and the tax on bread, and the tax on tea, and the tax--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>many</b> to beat her, {{as far as}} malice goes. But you'll {{find out}} for yourself. I shouldn't be {{surprised}} {{if she were to}} tell you before long that you were to marry the niece." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "The idol {{was carved}} of wood, attired in green clothes, the evil looking face {{was covered with}} white iron, a black fox skin was placed on its head; the whole sanctuary, {{especially}} his site which was higher than anywhere else, was decorated with purple broadcloth. Other smaller idols nearby which were placed lower were called the servants of the real idol. I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>many</b> other things {{in front of him}} - caftans, squirrel skins, etc…" [...] (Ibid.: 93) ...|$|R
60|$|THE BISHOP. We <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> {{already too}} <b>many</b> men to <b>be</b> quite {{fair to the}} women.|$|R
5000|$|Taghrooda's next {{race was}} the Yorkshire Oaks over one and half miles at York Racecourse 21 August. Apparently facing much weaker {{opposition}} than in her previous race and started at odds of 1/5 against six opponents headed by Tapestry, an Aidan O'Brien-trained filly who had {{finished second in}} the Irish Oaks. Hanaghan settled the filly in fifth place before moving up on the turn into the straight and taking the lead approaching the final quarter mile. A furlong out, however, she was joined by Tapestry and after a prolonged struggle it was the Irish-trained filly who prevailed by a neck. After the race, Hanaghan said [...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>many</b> excuses, she <b>was</b> just beaten by a very good horse".|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>many</b> rocks out here--but we'll have {{to consult}} the chart," [...] said Dick. [...] "Oh, I think we can pilot her to some port. But I must confess I don't know much about running an engine." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I can {{understand}} your love for animals," [...] said Alfred. [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>many</b> {{interesting things about}} wild creatures. There are comparatively few animals down in Virginia where I used to live, and my opportunities to study them have been limited." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I don't <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>many</b> {{young ladies}} that Beaton's afraid of," [...] said Fulkerson, giving himself the respite of this purely random remark, while he interrogated {{the faces of}} Mrs. Leighton and Colonel Woodburn for some light upon the {{tendency}} of their daughters' words.|$|E
2500|$|When {{interviewed by}} Marc Maron in 2011, O'Brien remarked, [...] "I'm {{trying to avoid}} that thing where you get a story in your head that's very clean. I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> too <b>many</b> people that {{come up with a}} very simple story where they're the hero, and they don't learn anything." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course, I don't {{agree with}} Lindau. I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> as <b>many</b> good, kind, just people among the rich as <b>there</b> <b>are</b> among the poor, {{and that they}} are as generous and helpful. But Lindau has got hold of one of those partial truths that hurt worse than the whole truth, and--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> a good <b>many</b> {{reasons why}} it is sound advice I am {{offering}} you. For one thing, wheat is still going down, you see." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; we {{were very}} much interested. I was sorry that I knew so little about inventions. Do you <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>many</b> {{practical}} ideas amongst his things? I hope there are--he seemed so proud and pleased to show them. Shouldn't you think he had some real inventive talent?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Playford, {{will you}} land {{a party of}} fifteen men on each side to clear the hills of those rascals? I don't <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>many</b> of them, but they are doing us {{a good deal of}} damage, for they can hardly miss us closely packed as we are here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I am {{as little}} like an angel, I am afraid,' replied Tom, shaking his head, 'as any stone cherubim among the grave-stones; and I don't <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>many</b> real angels of THAT pattern. But I {{should like to}} know (if you will tell me) why you have been so very silent about Martin.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I think not," [...] he {{answered}} seriously. [...] "I love all beautiful things. I <b>think</b> that <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>many</b> {{men as well}} as women who are like that. Shall I be very rude and say that in the matter of climate and flowers one grows, perhaps, to expect a little more in my own country." ...|$|R
60|$|I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> too <b>many</b> trees. They seem {{to crowd}} round {{and stare at}} me, and I {{feel as if they}} nudged one another when I'm not looking. I can feel them {{standing}} there. And they won't let me get on about the baby this morning. Just their cussedness. I felt they encouraged me like a harem of wonderful silent wives, yesterday.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have not}} forgotten. But when I married I knew I must choose between {{my country and}} my husband's; one could not belong to both. I chose his; his people became mine. He was a good man--I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> not <b>many</b> like him--and I was happy. When he died, I tried to bring up his {{daughter}} {{as he would have}} her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{thank you}} very much for your story, sergeant," [...] Jack replied. [...] "I only wish it had been longer; and {{although}} it's very easy to say that a man ought to die rather than consent to be a pirate, I don't <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>many</b> lads who would choose death if they were placed as you were." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>many</b> {{who would}} have done so," [...] Bathurst replied. [...] "You do your countrymen injustice. There are plenty of brave men among them, and I have heard before now of villagers, armed only with sticks, attacking a tiger who has carried off a victim from among them. You {{yourself}} were standing boldly before it when I came up." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ten to one, I should think," [...] Jim agreed. [...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>many</b> English here, {{except the}} big merchants and bankers {{and that sort}} of thing, while all the small shops seem to have either French, Italian, or Greek names over the door. Well, if it is going on like this, we can afford to wait for a bit." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, sir; I've {{been here}} fifteen year, I <b>think</b> it <b>is.</b> <b>There's</b> a <b>many</b> goes away, as doesn't {{go out of}} their own heads, you know, sir." ...|$|R
50|$|Years later, Bruce Beresford {{said of the}} film:I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> a {{few things}} in it that are interesting. But, I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> so <b>many</b> things that <b>are</b> wrong. We never liked the script... we never really caught the {{friendship}} between David and Jonathan. There weren't enough scenes between them. And David, himself - I think Richard Gere was miscast. He is a wonderful actor but he is much better in contemporary pieces.|$|R
500|$|When {{promoting}} {{her first}} international album in the United States, she was reportedly offered {{a role as}} a Bond Girl in The World Is Not Enough, {{as well as in}} High Fidelity. Anggun refused being an actress and said:"I was born a singer. I won't go into another profession, because I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> still <b>many</b> people out <b>there</b> who <b>were</b> born to be movie stars or models. My calling is music." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What shall I say?" [...] he asked. [...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>many</b> {{people who}} would see {{anything}} commendable in what I have done. In fact, those who heard about it would probably consider it a piece of futile rashness, {{and it is very}} likely that they would be right. After all, the restraints of the city may become intolerable to the girl." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>many</b> {{women would}} say you 'no', Master. I wish you well in your wooing, though I can't help {{thinking}} you're doing a daft-like thing. I hope you won't have any trouble with Thomas and Janet. They are so different from other folks there is no knowing. But take my advice, Master, and go and see them about it right off. Don't go on meeting Kilmeny unbeknownst to them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am glad of that," [...] she {{answered}} heartily. [...] "Do you <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>many</b> men in France {{who have been}} asked in marriage by a beautiful maiden--with her own lips--and who have refused her to her face? I know you men would half-despise such a triumph; but believe me, we women know more of what is precious in love. There is nothing that should set a person higher in his own esteem; and we women would prize nothing more dearly." ...|$|E
40|$|Photograph {{used for}} {{a story in the}} Oklahoma Times newspaper. Caption: "(W. J. Holloway) TODAY's QUESTION - Do you <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> too <b>many</b> {{restricted}} parking places in the downtown area, cab zones, loading zones, ect., and not enough meter zones for private parking? THE PLACE - Sravens building lobby. THE ANSWERS - W. J. Holloway, 1736 Kingsberry lane-No. I would say the restricted zone have <b>been</b> put <b>there</b> for a specific purpose. ...|$|R
60|$|God bless you, O women, moist-eyed and tender-hearted! In those gentle silly {{tears of}} yours <b>there</b> <b>is</b> {{something}} touches one, be they never so foolish. I don't <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>many</b> such natural drops shed that day as those which just made their {{appearance in the}} grandmother's eyes, {{and then went back}} again {{as if they had been}} ashamed of themselves, while the good lady and her little troop walked across the road. Think how happy she will be when night comes, and <b>there</b> has <b>been</b> no murder of English, and the brood is all nestled under her wings sound asleep, and she is lying awake thanking God that the day and its pleasures and pains are over. Whilst we were considering these things, the grandfather had suddenly elevated No. 4 senior upon his left shoulder, and I saw the tartan hat of that young gentleman, and the bamboo cane which had been transferred to him, high over the heads of the crowd on the opposite side through which the party moved.|$|R
50|$|Rantala {{often had}} {{to work as a}} translator, when the civil {{servants}} in Finnish Lapland did not know Saami. “I have sometimes had to translate texts, when people have complained about the non-existent command of Saami of e.g. the police. How many Finnish civil servants have taken the trouble to learn Saami? I don’t <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> too <b>many</b> of them.” According to Rantala, society should use various perks to motivate civil servants to learn Saami.|$|R
