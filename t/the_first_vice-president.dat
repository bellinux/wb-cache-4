25|$|Sewall's work in {{establishing}} the National Council of Women in the United States led to her involvement in founding the General Federation of Women's Clubs.

25|$|At the {{congress}} {{there were two}} candidates for the presidency of IFTU. The Briton W. A. Appleton was elected with 31 votes against 18 for the Dutchman Jan Oudegeest. Appleton had been nominated by Samuel Gompers whilst Oudegeest had been nominated by Arvid Thorberg. Two vice-presidents were also elected. In the election for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>vice-president</b> the German Carl Legien was defeated by the Frenchman Léon Jouhaux. The defeat of the German candidate {{could be seen as}} an indication that many trade unionists in the former Allied countries were suspicious of the Germans, who had dominated the international labour movement before the war. Following Legien's defeat, the German and Austrian delegations abstained from nominating candidates for the second vice-president. The Belgian Cornel Mertens was elected to the position. Jan Oudegeest and fellow Dutchman Edo Fimmen were elected general secretaries.|$|E

Although Ona Ondo said {{that he intended}} to only run if he won the PDG nomination, it was noted that he made the announcement publicly without adhering to party guidelines intended to ensure unity and discipline. Eyeghé Ndong had already expressed concerns that Bongo's death could lead to a dangerous weakening of party unity if PDG members announced their candidacies without internal party consultations. The Regional Director of Health in the north, Sany Megwazeb, also stated early on that he would seek the PDG nomination.|$|E

25|$|A UN report {{stated that}} {{four million people}} died in Indonesia {{as a result of}} famine and forced labour during the Japanese occupation. Two days after the {{surrender}} of Japan in August 1945, Sukarno and Hatta, the influential nationalist leaders, declared Indonesian independence. After independence, Soekarno was selected as Indonesia's first president by the PPKI, accompanied by Hatta who had been elected as <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>vice-president.</b> In November, the Central Indonesian National Committee demanded the dissolution of the presidential cabinet, and a new cabinet was formed with Sutan Sjahrir as prime minister. The Netherlands tried to reestablish their rule, and an armed and diplomatic struggle ended in December 1949, when in the face of international pressure, the Dutch formally recognised Indonesian independence (with the exception of the Dutch territory of West New Guinea, which was incorporated into Indonesia following the 1962 New York Agreement, and the UN-mandated Act of Free Choice of 1969).|$|E
25|$|Amidst {{this tension}} and controversy, the seven {{excluded}} candidates, {{along with the}} originally accepted candidates Kolingba and Goumba, called for the mediation of Gabonese president Omar Bongo. On January 22, the matter was effectively resolved through the signing by Bozizé and his rivals of an agreement in Libreville, which allowed all the candidates except Patassé to participate and brought {{the total number of}} candidates to 11. According to the agreement, Patassé would remain barred because he was the subject of judicial proceedings. The date of the election was also delayed to March 13, and it was agreed that the constitutional court would not be dissolved, but that it would lose powers regarding the election, which would instead go to CEMI. Subsequently, although Patassé rejected the agreement—saying that he had not authorized Luc Apollinaire Dondon, <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>vice-president</b> of the MLPC, to sign it—the MLPC announced on January 26 that it would support the candidacy of Ziguélé, who had previously been running as an independent.|$|E
500|$|Gompers was an {{advocate}} of craft unionism, the idea that workers should be separated into unions according to their skills. The AFL disdained to organize workers who were not skilled. Furthermore, in 1900 Gompers became <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>vice-president</b> of the National Civic Federation, which was [...] "dedicated to the fostering of harmony and collaboration between capital and organized labor." [...] But Haywood had become convinced by the experiences of striking railroad workers that a different union philosophy, some form of industrial unionism, was necessary for workers to obtain justice. This had become apparent in 1888 when the craft-organized locomotive firemen kept their engines running, helping their employers to break a strike called by the railroad engineers.|$|E
