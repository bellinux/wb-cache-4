50|$|The RER has {{received}} criticism for its {{high level of}} particle pollution during busy periods, essentially due to <b>train</b> <b>braking.</b> Pollution by PM10 particles regularly reaches 400 µg/m3 at Auber, substantially more than at neighboring metro stations and eight times the EU Commission's daily average limit of 50 µg/m3.|$|E

50|$|The {{automatic}} {{vacuum brake}} as described represented a considerable technical advance in <b>train</b> <b>braking.</b> In practice steam locomotives had two ejectors, a small ejector for running purposes (to exhaust air that had leaked into the train pipe) {{and a large}} ejector to release brake applications. Later Great Western Railway practice was to use a vacuum pump instead of the small ejector.|$|E
50|$|The <b>train</b> <b>braking</b> on train 8151 {{had been}} {{activated}} only about 170 m {{from the rear}} of the train 1391. Given the characteristics of the brake, and its time of entry into operation, it can be assumed that it was activated in response to stop signals given by hand by station staff, as in fact was admitted by the driver.|$|E
50|$|The James Superlux Autocycle was {{manufactured}} from 1950-1953. The {{engine was}} a single speed Villiers Mk 2F with 98cc displacement at 47 x 57 mm.

Drive <b>train,</b> <b>braking</b> and lighting were identical to the Deluxe.|$|E

50|$|The {{original}} law was {{amended by}} a subsequent act in 1903, whose first section provides that {{the requirements of}} the original act respecting <b>train</b> <b>brakes,</b> automatic couplers, and grab irons shall be held to apply to all trains and cars used on any railroad engaged in interstate commerce, unless a minor exception were satisfied. By its second section this act requires that not less than 50 percent of the cars in a train shall have their <b>train</b> <b>brakes</b> used and operated by the engineer on the locomotive, and confers upon the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) the authority to increase this minimum percentage to the end that the objects intended may be more fully accomplished. By an order promulgated June 6, 1910, the Commission increased the minimum number of cars whose <b>train</b> <b>brakes</b> must be under the engineer's control to 85 percent.|$|R
50|$|Locomotive (air) {{and train}} (vacuum) brakes were fitted from new. Air <b>train</b> <b>braking</b> was added later, {{in some cases}} with {{high-level}} air brake pipes for use with Southern Region electric multiple units. Originally the class had radio communication sets fitted for use at Southampton Docks, the aerial located on the top right hand corner of the engine bonnet. These were removed when operation at the docks ceased.|$|E
5000|$|... 'Conflat' is the telegraphic code {{within the}} Great Western Railway's coding of railway wagons for a {{container}} wagon. Unlike normal wagon loads, containers were only listed to carry furniture or goods (unless they were refrigerated containers, which carried frozen products kept cold by ice) which {{needed to be}} placed on a specialist flatbed wagon which had <b>train</b> <b>braking</b> capability due to the fragile nature of the products carried.|$|E
50|$|The six-wheeled tender was {{equipped}} with a hand brake and wooden brake blocks, but the engine's coupled wheels were not braked. Until c. 1876, it was universal practice with tender engines to not fit brakes on the coupled wheels. <b>Train</b> <b>braking</b> was therefore {{by means of the}} tender's hand brake and the brakes on the guard's van, or brake van, with reliance on the guard to apply or release the van's brakes upon whistle signals from the driver.|$|E

50|$|A 2-6-2T steam locomotive, {{the design}} of Russell is {{more closely related to}} Hunslet No 865 of 1905 {{otherwise}} known as Leeds Number 1, although certain engineering aspects can be more readily associated with design of locomotives supplied to the Sierra Leone Government Railway. One of the driving wheel centres bears the initials SLR, however this has been found to have been a later replacement and not as originally supplied. Originally built with air <b>train</b> <b>brakes,</b> it was converted to vacuum <b>train</b> <b>brakes</b> following the linking of the Welsh Highland and Ffestiniog Railways.|$|R

50|$|An {{additional}} {{use for the}} injector {{technology is}} in vacuum ejectors in continuous <b>train</b> <b>braking</b> systems, which were made compulsory in the UK by the Regulation of Railways Act 1889. A vacuum ejector uses steam pressure to draw {{air out of the}} vacuum pipe and reservoirs of continuous train brake. Steam locomotives, with a ready source of steam, found ejector technology ideal with its rugged simplicity and lack of moving parts. A steam locomotive usually has two ejectors: a large ejector for releasing the brakes when stationary and a small ejector for maintaining the vacuum against leaks. The small ejector is sometimes replaced by a reciprocating pump driven from the crosshead because this is more economical of steam.|$|E
