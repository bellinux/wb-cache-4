500|$|In 1979, Sorkin {{attended}} Syracuse University. In {{his freshman}} year he failed a class that was a core requirement. It was a devastating setback {{because he wanted to}} be an actor, and the drama department did not allow students to take the stage until they completed all the core freshman classes. Determined to do better, he returned in his sophomore year, and graduated in 1983. Recalling the influence on him at college of drama teacher Arthur Storch, Sorkin recalled, after Storch's death in March 2013, that [...] "Arthur's reputation as a director, and as a disciple of Lee Strasberg, was a big reason why a lot of us went to [...] 'You have the capacity <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> better than you are', he started saying to me in September of my senior year. He was still saying it in May. On the last day of classes, he said it again, and I said, 'How?', and he answered, 'Dare to fail'. I've been coming through on his admonition ever since".|$|E
500|$|A different, widely {{circulated}} story {{suggests that}} Peel urinated on the pitch before being dismissed by Hawke. Woodhouse, writing in 1989, suggested that [...] "it {{is difficult to}} ascertain the truth behind this long-standing tale", while Hodgson observes: [...] "I have never been convinced of this account because it has always seemed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> {{out of character for}} a cricketer of that time when so much stress was placed upon behaving 'like a gentleman' even in one's cups." [...] Mick Pope writes: [...] "The more recent accusation that Peel urinated on the pitch remains unjust, unproven and such a myth... that it should have no place in any study of Bobby Peel, the cricketer." [...] The story originated in a cricket publication, Cricket Quarterly, in 1968. The historian Rowland Bowen, in an article called [...] "Fresh Light on the Dismissal of R Peel in 1897", claimed that an [...] "aged Yorkshireman of 85" [...] told him that Peel had urinated and that this was a common practice then. Subsequent research by the historian Irving Rosewater established that Bowen's information came to him second-hand. The 85-year-old had not used the word [...] "urinated" [...] but had actually said [...] "pissed at the wicket", meaning that Peel was drunk ("pissed" [...] being slang for drunk) on the pitch ("at the wicket"). Rosewater suggests that this was merely repetition of the already known story, not the new information claimed by Bowen. Rosewater self-published his findings in a book called An Unjust Slur on Bobby Peel in 1997.|$|E

2500|$|In {{his review}} for Screen Crush, Kevin Fitzpatrick stated, [...] "The honest {{truth is that}} Iron Fist needed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> weirder than it {{actually}} is, akin to how Doctor Strange essentially re-told the Iron Man story with enough out-there visuals and eccentric supporting characters to paper over any shortcomings. Iron Fist starts {{to show signs of}} life in its sixth episode... but the slog in getting there is too great an ask, especially when {{the vast majority of the}} principal characters feel so spectacularly underdeveloped." [...] Fitzpatrick felt that Henwick's Colleen Wing was [...] "the most fully-realized character" [...] with [...] "a rich supporting performance" [...] that is overlooked in the early episodes. Uproxx's Alan Sepinwall felt of the first six episodes, [...] "Iron Fist is virtually all talk — most of it painfully dull — and the fighting is both brief and unconvincing. It’s easily the worst of the Netflix Marvel shows — where the others tend to start off well and then run into massive pacing problems around episode 8 or 9, Iron Fist begins as if it’s already at that sag point — and an unfortunate illustration of the perils of miscasting." [...] He also criticized Jones' fighting ability and the way the fights were filmed and edited. Some of the few positive for the season were the appearances of Carrie-Anne Moss as Jeri Hogarth and Dawson. Sepinwall concluded, [...] "the biggest problem with the new show is that no one involved seems to have any kind of take on the material. They’re just making a mostly faithful but personality-free adaptation because someone at Marvel decided four years ago that Danny (who often partners with Luke in the comics) had to be the final member of the team... we got a show that’s so lifeless that I have no interest in finishing out the season".|$|E

5000|$|Saturday Nights & Sunday Mornings is {{the fifth}} studio album by Counting Crows, {{released}} in the United States on March 25, 2008. It is thematically divided into two sides: the rock music of Saturday Nights and the more country-influenced Sunday Mornings. Vocalist and lyricist Adam Duritz states that the album [...] "is about really wanting to mean something and failing to do it. You want your life to mean something. You want <b>to</b> <b>be</b> somebody and then what you turn out <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> less than what you thought you <b>were</b> going <b>to</b> be." ...|$|R

Well done Rhett Walker Band for such an enjoyable and thought provoking album!" ...|$|R
