40|$|During the 2010 - 2012 run of Large Hadron Collider experiment, the ATLAS trigger {{system was}} {{successfully}} operated and it contributed to several important results such as observation of Higgs boson {{with a mass}} of about 125 GeV. From 2015, collision energy will increase to 13 - 14 TeV and its instantaneous luminosity will reach 1 - 2 × 10 ^ 34 cm^- 2 s^- 1 with a 25 ns bunch crossing period. Due to the energy increase, the cross sections for SM processes are expected to get much larger. Additionally, the number of overlapping proton-proton interactions per bunch crossing, which is refereed to as pile-up, {{is expected to increase}} significantly up to about 80. Therefore it will be challenging to control trigger rates while keeping good efficiency for interesting physics events. This document summarizes the development of Fast Tracker and its tracking performance for the ATLAS experiment. The Fast <b>Tracker</b> <b>is</b> a <b>custom</b> electronics system that will operate at the full Level 1 accepted rate of 100 kHz and provide high quality track information {{at the beginning of the}} high level trigger. This will be performed by hardware based track reconstruction system with massive parallelism using associative memories and FPGAs. The availability of the full tracking information from Fast Tracker will ensure robust selection in high level trigger within the affordable latency available at the high level trigger and mitigation of the negative effects due to high pile-up...|$|R
40|$|The {{design and}} {{studies of the}} {{performance}} for the ATLAS hardware Fast <b>TracKer</b> (FTK) <b>are</b> presented. The existing trigger system of the ATLAS experiment is deployed to reduce the event rate from the bunch crossing rate of 40 MHz to < 1 KHz for permanent storage at the LHC design luminosity of 10 ^ 34 cm^- 2 s^- 1. The LHC has performed exceptionally well and routinely exceeds the design luminosity and from 2015 is due to operate with higher still luminosities. This will place a significant load on the High Level trigger (HLT) system, both due {{to the need for}} more sophisticated algorithms to reject background, and from the larger data volumes that will need to be processed. The Fast <b>TracKer</b> <b>is</b> a <b>custom</b> electronics system that will operate at the full Level- 1 accepted rate of 100 KHz and provide high quality tracks at the beginning of processing in the HLT. This will be performing by track reconstruction using hardware with massive parallelism using associative memories (AM) and FPGAs. The availability of the full tracking information will ensure robust HLT selection within the affordable latency available at the HLT, with only a limited degradation in performance arising from the additional pileup from higher luminosity running. The parallel system architecture is presented, with a focus on the I/O interfaces which use Advanced Telecommunications Computing Architecture (ATCA) technology to handle the massive data volumes from the ATLAS silicon detector, and the data output to the HLT. The processing units incorporate more than 8000 AM chips to store and match ~ 10 ^ 9 patterns, and more than 1000 FPGAs to perform data formatting and track fitting. The latest R&D progress for the individual components is discussed, including the design and prototyping of the next generation AM chip and the custom ATCA blades. The results from in-situ test results are also presented. The performance in important physics areas is demonstrated using the ATLAS Monte Carlo simulation at different LHC luminosities...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{contributes}} new algorithms and implementations for particle filter-based target tracking. From an algorithmic perspective, modifications {{that improve}} a batch-based acoustic direction-of-arrival (DOA), multi-target, particle filter <b>tracker</b> <b>are</b> presented. The main improvements are reduced execution time and increased robustness to target maneuvers. The key {{feature of the}} batch-based <b>tracker</b> <b>is</b> an image template-matching approach that handles data association and clutter in measurements. The particle filter <b>tracker</b> <b>is</b> compared to an extended Kalman filter~(EKF) and a Laplacian filter and is shown to perform better for maneuvering targets. Using an approach similar to the acoustic tracker, a radar range-only <b>tracker</b> <b>is</b> also developed. This includes developing the state update and observation models, and proving observability for a batch of range measurements. From an implementation perspective, this thesis provides new low-power and real-time implementations for particle filters. First, to achieve a very low-power implementation, two mixed-mode implementation strategies that use analog and digital components are developed. The mixed-mode implementations use analog, multiple-input translinear element (MITE) networks to realize nonlinear functions. The power dissipated in the mixed-mode implementation of a particle filter-based, bearings-only <b>tracker</b> <b>is</b> compared to a digital implementation that uses the CORDIC algorithm to realize the nonlinear functions. The mixed-mode method that uses predominantly analog components is shown to provide a factor of twenty improvement in power savings compared to a digital implementation. Next, real-time implementation strategies for the batch-based acoustic DOA <b>tracker</b> <b>are</b> developed. The characteristics of the digital implementation of the <b>tracker</b> <b>are</b> quantified using digital signal processor (DSP) and field-programmable gate array (FPGA) implementations. The FPGA implementation uses a soft-core or hard-core processor to implement the Newton search in the particle proposal stage. A MITE implementation of the nonlinear DOA update function in the <b>tracker</b> <b>is</b> also presented. Ph. D.
