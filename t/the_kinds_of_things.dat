25|$|Such {{rules are}} another {{standard}} device in traditional linguistics; e.g. passivization in English. Much of generative grammar {{has been devoted}} to finding ways of refining the descriptive mechanisms of phrase-structure grammar and transformation rules such that exactly <b>the</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> can be expressed that natural language actually allows. Allowing arbitrary transformations doesn't meet that goal: they are much too powerful, being Turing complete unless significant restrictions are added (e.g. no transformations that introduce and then rewrite symbols in a context-free fashion).|$|E
25|$|I {{think every}} {{director}} {{thinks that he}} hasn't been allowed to make the films he wanted to make. I certainly haven't {{been able to make}} as many Westerns as I've wanted. (But) sometimes staying alive in a career sense is very important, and you think, 'Maybe I'll do this, which will do well and allow me to do that.' It's very easy to miscalculate. It's a dangerous game. But I think in the end, none of us have anybody to blame except ourselves. It can be very hard. <b>The</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> that directors most want to do are usually not things the studio perceives to be commercially viable. It really is that simple. Is that true of me? Sure. Absolutely. But it's no more true of me than 50 other people I know.|$|E

500|$|This {{follows from}} the causal theory of reference. Words always refer to <b>the</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> they were coined to refer to, thus <b>the</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> their user, or the user's ancestors, {{experience}}d. So, if some person, Mary, were a [...] "brain in a vat", whose every experience is received through wiring and other gadgetry created by the [...] "mad scientist", then Mary's idea of a [...] "brain" [...] would not refer to a [...] "real" [...] brain, since she and her linguistic community have {{never seen such a}} thing. Rather, she saw something that looked like a brain, but was actually an image fed to her through the wiring. Similarly, her idea of a [...] "vat" [...] would not refer to a [...] "real" [...] vat. So, if, as a brain in a vat, she were to say [...] "I'm a brain in a vat", she would actually be saying [...] "I'm a brain-image in a vat-image", which is incoherent. On the other hand, if she is not a brain in a vat, then saying that she is a brain in a vat is still incoherent, but now because she actually means the opposite. This is a form of epistemological externalism: knowledge or justification depends on factors outside the mind and is not solely determined internally.|$|E
500|$|... "Losing My Religion" [...] {{is based}} on Peter Buck's mandolin-playing. Buck said, [...] "The verses are <b>the</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> R.E.M. uses a lot, going from one minor to another, kind [...] like those 'Driver 8' chords. You can't really say {{anything}} bad about E minor, A minor, D, and G– I mean, they're just good chords." [...] Buck noted that [...] "Losing My Religion" [...] was [...] "probably the most typical R.E.M.-sounding song on the record. We {{are trying to get}} away from those kind of songs, but like I said before, those are some good chords." [...] Orchestral strings play through parts of the song. The song is in natural minor.|$|E
500|$|In {{writing the}} script, Attanasio, Levinson and Fontana wanted the {{dialogue}} to reflect <b>the</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> detectives {{would talk about}} when not discussing murders or cases, {{which led to the}} inclusion of several scenes in which detectives talk casually among themselves during lunch or around the office. Fontana, who compared the scenes to Levinson's 1982 film Diner, said, [...] "That really made the show different from other shows, because we had the room to have conversations that seemingly didn't (storywise) connect anything, but they did reveal a lot about the characters." [...] Levinson specifically asked that the body by Howard and Felton be badly decomposing and attracting flies because he felt other police dramas did not portray corpses in a realistic way.|$|E

Allmusic reviewer Johnny Loftus awarded the album three out of five stars and wrote that, [...] "The Food Album is an enjoyable bag of treats. Just don't eat too much, or you'll probably get sick." [...] Likewise, The Rolling Stone Album Guide awarded the album three out of five stars. Anthony [...] of The Buffalo News gave the album a moderately positive review and wrote that, [...] "here are two kinds of people in the world: those who love Weird Al Yankovic and those who can't stand him. Count me among the Weird One's biggest fans, and that's why I flipped out when listening to The Food Album." [...] He concluded that the album was [...] "like reading Mad magazine"; he gave the record three stars out of five. Tim Grobaty of the Press-Telegram, on the other hand, wrote negatively of the album, stating [...] "Yankovic's songs are <b>the</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> that are sort of funny in concept, less funny when you actually hear them once, and increasingly irritating with each subsequent listen [...] his food songs are among his worst." ...|$|E
500|$|The Hurt Locker {{is based}} on {{accounts}} of Mark Boal, a freelance journalist who was embedded with an American bomb squad {{in the war in}} Iraq for two weeks in 2004. The director Kathryn Bigelow was familiar with Boal's work before his experiences, having adapted one of his Playboy articles as the short-lived television series The Inside in 2002. When Boal was embedded with the squad, he accompanied its members 10 to 15 times a day to watch their tasks, and kept in touch with Bigelow via email about his experiences. Boal used his experiences as the basis of a fictional drama based on real events. He said of the film's goal, [...] "The idea is that it's the first movie about the Iraq War that purports to show the experience of the soldiers. We wanted to show <b>the</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> that soldiers go through that you can't see on CNN, and I don't mean that in a censorship-conspiracy way. I just mean the news doesn't actually put photographers in with units that are this elite." [...] Bigelow was fascinated with exploring [...] "the psychology behind the type of soldier who volunteers for this particular conflict and then, because of his or her aptitude, is chosen and given the opportunity to go into bomb disarmament and goes toward what everybody else is running from." ...|$|E
500|$|Homicide: Life on the Street {{was unique}} among police dramas for weaving {{multiple}} intricate story-lines into single episodes; the season premiere [...] "Gone for Goode", for example, included four separate subplots. As {{the first season}} of Homicide progressed, NBC officials complained to the show's producers about {{the large number of}} subplots, but the producers resisted the pressure to scale them back until the [...] Despite intense advance promotion of the Homicide premiere due to a planned Super Bowl lead-in, Attanasio deliberately sought to introduce the show with little fanfare, avoiding sensational gimmicks in favor of character-driven plot, quirky dialogue and morbid dark humor. Homicide was noted for its deliberate lack of gun-play and car chases in favor of dialogue and story. The writers also wanted the dialogue to reflect <b>the</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> detectives would talk about when not discussing murders or cases, which led to the inclusion of several scenes in which detectives talk casually among themselves during lunch or around the office. One of the [...] "running gags" [...] was Crosetti's obsession of the Lincoln assassination and his quest to discover the [...] "truth" [...] and his arguments with Lewis or anyone else willing to listen. [...] Fontana, who compared the scenes to Levinson's 1982 film Diner, said, [...] "That really made the show different from other shows, because we had the room to have conversations that seemingly didn't [...] connect anything, but they did reveal a lot about the characters." ...|$|E

2500|$|Other {{research}} suggests that some employees perform OCBs to influence how they are viewed within the organization. While these behaviors are not formally {{part of the job}} description, performing them can influence performance appraisals. Researchers have advanced the view that employees engage in OCBs as a form of [...] "impression management," [...] a term coined by Erving Goffman. Goffman defined impression management as [...] "the way in which the individual ... presents himself and his activity to others, the ways in which he guides and controls the impression they form of him, and <b>the</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> he may and may not do while sustaining his performance before them. Some researchers have hypothesized that OCBs are not performed out of good will, positive affect, etc., but instead as a way of being noticed by others, including supervisors.|$|E
6000|$|... § 6. We {{have now}} {{analyzed}} what is {{implied in the}} two principal requisites of a philosophical language; first, precision, or definiteness; and, secondly, completeness. Any further remarks on the mode of constructing a nomenclature must be deferred until we treat of Classification; the mode of naming <b>the</b> <b>Kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> being necessarily subordinate to the mode of arranging those Kinds into larger classes. With respect to the minor requisites of terminology, {{some of them are}} well stated and illustrated in the “Aphorisms concerning the Language of Science,” included in Dr. Whewell’s Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences. These, as being of secondary importance in the peculiar point of view of Logic, I shall not further refer to, but shall confine my observations to one more quality, which, next to the two already treated of, appears to be the most valuable which the language of science can possess. Of this quality a general notion may be conveyed by the following aphorism: ...|$|E
6000|$|... § 7. If, in {{the second}} place, the property, in the {{instances}} {{in which it has}} been observed, is not an effect of causation, it is a property of Kind; and in that case the generalization can only be set aside by the discovery of a new Kind of crow. That, however, a peculiar Kind not hitherto discovered should exist in nature, is a supposition so often realized {{that it can not be}} considered at all improbable. We have nothing to authorize us in attempting to limit <b>the</b> <b>Kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> which exist in nature. The only unlikelihood would be that a new Kind should be discovered in localities which there was previously reason to believe had been thoroughly explored; and even this improbability depends on the degree of conspicuousness of the difference between the newly-discovered Kind and all others, since new kinds of minerals, plants, and even animals, previously overlooked or confounded with known species, are still continually detected in the most frequented situations. On this second ground, therefore, as well as on the first, the observed uniformity of co-existence can only hold good as an empirical law, within the limits not only of actual observation, but of an observation as accurate as the nature of the case required. And hence it is that (as remarked in an early chapter of the present book) we so often give up generalizations of this class at the first summons. If any credible witness stated that he had seen a white crow, under circumstances which made it not incredible that it should have escaped notice previously, we should give full credence to the statement.|$|E

60|$|But {{there is}} a sort of classes, for the {{recognition}} of which no such elaborate process is necessary; because each of them is marked out from all others not by some one property, the detection of which may depend on a difficult act of abstraction, but by its properties generally. I mean, <b>the</b> <b>Kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>things,</b> in the sense which, in this treatise, has been specially attached to that term. By a Kind, it will be remembered, we mean one of those classes which are distinguished from all others not by one or a few definite properties, but by an unknown multitude of them; the combination of properties on which the class is grounded, being a mere index to an indefinite number of other distinctive attributes. The class horse is a Kind, because the things which agree in possessing the characters by which we recognize a horse, agree in a great number of other properties, as we know, and, it can not be doubted, in many more than we know. Animal, again, is a Kind, because no definition that could be given of the name animal could either exhaust the properties common to all animals, or supply premises from which the remainder of those properties could be inferred. But a combination of properties which does not give evidence of the existence of any other independent peculiarities, does not constitute a Kind. White horse, therefore, is not a Kind; because horses which agree in whiteness, do not agree in any thing else, except the qualities common to all horses, and whatever may be the causes or effects of that particular color.|$|E
6000|$|On careful examination, it {{is found}} that the {{materials}} of which each of these layers of more or less hard rock are composed are, for the most part, of the same nature as those which are at present being formed under known conditions {{on the surface of the}} earth. For example, the chalk, which constitutes a great part of the Cretaceous formation in some parts of the world, is practically identical in its physical and chemical characters with a substance which is now being formed at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean, and covers an enormous area; other beds of rock are comparable with the sands which are being formed upon sea-shores, packed together, and so on. Thus, omitting rocks of igneous origin, it is demonstrable that all these beds of stone, of which a total of not less than seventy thousand feet is known, have been formed by natural agencies, either out of the waste and washing of the dry land, or else by the accumulation of the exuviæ of plants and animals. Many of these strata are full of such exuviæ--the so-called [...] "fossils." [...] Remains of thousands of species of animals and plants, as perfectly recognisable as those of existing forms of life which you meet with in museums, or as the shells which you pick up upon the sea-beach, have been imbedded in the ancient sands, or muds, or limestones, just as they are being imbedded now, in sandy, or clayey, or calcareous subaqueous deposits. They furnish us with a record, the general nature of which cannot be misinterpreted, of <b>the</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> that have lived upon the surface of the earth during the time that is registered by this great thickness of stratified rocks. But even a superficial study of these fossils shows us that the animals and plants which live at the present time have had only a temporary duration; for the remains of such modern forms of life are met with, for the most part, only in the uppermost or latest tertiaries, and their number rapidly diminishes in the lower deposits of that epoch. In the older tertiaries, the places of existing animals and plants are taken by other forms, as numerous and diversified as those which live now in the same localities, but more or less different from them; in the mesozoic rocks, these are replaced by others yet more divergent from modern types; and, in the palæozoic formations the contrast is still more marked. Thus the circumstantial evidence absolutely negatives the conception of the eternity of the present condition of things. We can say, with certainty, that the present condition of things has existed for a comparatively short period; and that, so far as animal and vegetable nature are concerned, it has been preceded by a different condition. We can pursue this evidence until we reach the lowest of the stratified rocks, in which we lose the indications of life altogether. The hypothesis of the eternity of the present state of nature may therefore be put out of court.|$|E
