40|$|This paper {{compares the}} {{techniques}} of Data Reconcil-iation and the Diagnostic Model Processor applied to an industrial full scale <b>two-ply</b> <b>paper</b> machine using ac-tual operating data. Data reconciliation optimally ad-justs the raw data to satisfy known constraints whilst simultaneously identifying gross errors. The DMP searches for faults that create the observed discrep-ancies in these constraint equations. The DR strategy worked well, reconciling the raw measurements and correctly identifying gross errors while the DMP was over enthusiastic in its attempts to identify assumption violations.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{problem of}} {{failure in the}} facings of a {{corrugated}} board is investigated {{by means of a}} mechanical model utilizing the principles of continuum damage mechanics. To evaluate the predictive capability of the model, experiments have been conducted on in-plane isotropic single- and <b>two-ply</b> <b>paper</b> sheets manufactured in the laboratory. It is found that there is a qualitative agreement between model and experiments. The model can predict if delamination will occur before the top-ply loses its in-plane load carrying capacity due to material degradation. To circumvent delamination problems, a material with low stiffness should be used in the top-ply (as compared to the bottom-ply) and a very thin top-ply should be avoided. It is exemplified {{that it is possible to}} steer the failure mode by optimizing the degree of beating or the ply thickness. It is demonstrated that plasticity may be omitted in the analysis if one is only interested in characterizing the expected type of failure mode. An important key result is that, if the circumstances are that severe damage growth takes place in the crack-tip region, then delamination most likely occur which may be in contradiction to what is anticipated from classical theories of fracture mechanics.

40|$|The {{spreading}} kinetics of {{drops of}} different liquids (water, glycerol and ethylene glycol) on {{different types of}} model papers have been investigated. In {{the first part of}} the investigation single ply and <b>two-ply</b> <b>papers,</b> made from pulps with different degrees of beating, were investigated. The results show that is very common the surface layer of the paper had a much larger influence on the spreading than the bottom ply. By normalising the data showing the drop radius as a function of time with the viscosity and surface tension of the liquids all data collapse onto a master curve. The results from {{the first part of the}} investigation also show that in order to determine a contact angle between the liquid and the paper the drop volume should remain constant and the contact angle should be determined when the drop has reached its equilibrium volume. In the second part of the investigation the influence of surface topography and surface energy of the papers on the spreading kinetics was determined. The results show that when the pattern of use, the avails on the surface creates fine capillaries the contact angle is decreased compared to the situation with a flat surface. For papers with a higher roughness the uneven structure creates barriers against the spreading which increases the contact angle compared to the situation with a flat surface. A simple attempt to fit the data to a power law based on a hydrodynamic approach was also conducted. The results from this treatment show that it is possible to get a good match for the sheets with virtually only surface spreading. The constants achieved in this treatment can be used to rationalise the spreading data to be compared with other investigations.

50|$|As {{early as}} 1985, Lebrun {{began to use}} the {{computer}} {{as a means to}} streamline and modernize production. Originally, he employed the conventional tools and materials used by earlier Blondie artists: steel pen points (originally Gillot 1290s, later Hunt 103 or 104s for the line work and filed-down Speedball A-2s for lettering), Strathmore <b>two-ply</b> plate finish <b>paper</b> and Pelikan drawing ink. By January 2002, Lebrun made the strip's production fully digital, abandoning paper, pencil and ink in favor of the PowerPC G4.|$|R
40|$|Four intermetallic-based alloys were {{evaluated}} for cutting blade applications. These alloys included Fe{sub 3 }Al-based (FAS-II and FA- 129), FeAl-based (PM- 60), and Ni{sub 3 }Al-based (IC- 50). These alloys were of interest {{because of their}} much higher work-hardening rates than the conventionally used carbon and stainless steels. The FeAl-based PM- 60 alloy was of further interest because of its hardening possibility through retention of vacancies. The vacancy retention treatment is much simpler than the heat treatments used for hardening of steel blades. Blades of four intermetallic alloys and commercially used M 2 tool steel blades {{were evaluated}} under identical conditions to cut <b>two-ply</b> heavy <b>paper.</b> Comparative results under identical conditions revealed that the FeAl-based alloy PM- 60 outperformed the other intermetallic alloys and was equal to or somewhat better than the commercially used M 2 tool steel...|$|R
