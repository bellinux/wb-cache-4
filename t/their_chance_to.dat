5|$|In 2012, in {{partnership}} with RBC, Canada's Walk of Fame launched the RBC Emerging Artist Music Mentorship Prize competition. Valued at more than $100,000, the initiative aims to support {{the next generation of}} gifted Canadian musicians. Aspiring young musicians are asked to submit a 60 sec. musical audio or video performance for <b>their</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> win the Grand Prize of $25,000 cash, recording time, performance opportunities and much more.

5|$|Mike Summerbee {{opened the}} scoring on 13 minutes, but Newcastle soon equalised. Neil Young made it 2–1, but again Newcastle equalised. A second strike by Young was {{disallowed}} for offside, and at half-time {{the score was}} 2–2. Straight after half-time Young scored again, and Francis Lee scored a fourth on 63 minutes. A late Newcastle goal set up a nervy finish, but City held on to win 4–3 and secure the title. The win was compounded by a 2–1 victory by Sunderland over Manchester United, giving City the title. Liverpool won one of their remaining games but lost the other, missing <b>their</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> leapfrog United into second by one point.|$|E
5|$|The Swedes {{were not}} {{popular in the}} regions that Sweden had gained at the Treaty of Roskilde in 1658. With the new war going badly, insurgents saw <b>their</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> rise up against the unpopular rule. Swedish response, {{especially}} in Scania, was more subtle than one might believe. An all out terror campaign would have been economically disastrous. Instead small patrols searching the woods were often employed combined with promises of carrots or sticks to the local farmers.|$|E

5|$|Battles in {{the story}} take place on maps divided into a square-based grid. Battle actions are governed by a turn-based system where each unit on both sides is given <b>their</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> move and act. During gameplay, weather and terrain effects appear such as fog of war or {{elements}} of the environment that can be manipulated to one side's advantage, affecting the progress of battle. Units are split between player, enemy and allied non-player character (NPC) units. Each unit's movement range and attack range is displayed when selected. The player must clear a map to advance the story: the objectives for clearing a level can vary from defeating all enemies to capturing strongholds or rescuing NPCs. When engaging a unit, the scene transitions into a battle between the player and enemy unit, with battle animation playing out. When hit with an attack, a character loses health points (HP). For player characters, HP can be restored with items or by units with healing magic; {{it can also be}} regained by standing on forts, gates or castles, or using a special spell that replenishes health based on damage dealt to an enemy.|$|E
5|$|Battles {{play out}} using a turn-based system where each unit {{on both sides}} is given <b>their</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> move and act. Characters move and attack within the same turn, {{and in a few}} cases units can take two moves in a turn. A key part of combat is the Weapons Triangle, a new {{addition}} which governs the opposing strengths and weaknesses of weapon types based on a rock–paper–scissors system - lances are stronger than swords, swords are stronger than axes, and axes are stronger than lances. A secondary system governs the magic system, where Fire, Lightning, and Wind spells have varying strengths and weaknesses against each other. Each unit has a character class which determines their weapon, skill set, movement and attack range, how much effect they have on other units, which latent skills they possess, and whether they use passive or aggressive skills when in combat. Different weapon types also affect character movement and battle performance: for instance, a powerful sword deals damage while slowing a character's movement.|$|E
5|$|Battles {{take place}} on a grid-based battlefield, with {{objectives}} which range from clearing enemy groups to capturing points of importance. Each map has unique terrain to be negotiated in battle ranging from mountains to rivers and flat plains. Viewed from an overhead perspective, there are castles and locations such as shops that the player can visit, the latter of which provides a means for obtaining items. Each chapter has {{a different set of}} victory conditions, which can be related to the number of turns taken or how the enemy force is dealt with. Battles play out using a turn-based system where each unit on both sides is given <b>their</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> move and act. During battle, the combat screen appears, showing the fight from a sidelong perspective. Both sides move at least once, after which the combat screen fades. Battles between individual units are governed by the series' recurring Weapons Triangle, a rock–paper–scissors system where certain weapons have advantages over others — lances are stronger than swords, swords are stronger than axes, and axes are stronger than lances. As they participate in battles, each unit gains experience points (EXP) from their actions: they raise their experience level by one when they have accumulated 100 EXP. EXP can be earned in both normal battles and challenge fights in special arenas. Players can save {{at the end of each}} chapter or outside battle. They also have a single mid-chapter save available. All units are subject to permanent death: If a unit dies in battle, they are removed from the rest of the campaign.|$|E

50|$|Infections can be {{prevented}} from occurring in homes as well. In order <b>to</b> reduce <b>their</b> <b>chances</b> <b>to</b> contract an infection, individuals are recommended to maintain a good hygiene by washing their hands after every contact with questionable areas or bodily fluids and by disposing of garbage at regular intervals to prevent germs from growing.|$|R
60|$|The dude and his crony, {{as well as}} Larkspur, {{were still}} down upon the Rovers, but for the present they kept quiet, the reason being that they were behind in their lessons and {{had to work hard}} to make up. But all were {{watching}} <b>their</b> <b>chances</b> <b>to</b> do the Rover boys some injury on the quiet.|$|R
5|$|Battles {{take place}} on grid-based {{self-contained}} maps and are governed by a turn-based system where units on both sides are given <b>their</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> move and act. Once a unit has moved, depending on their position relative to allied units and enemies, they may perform actions such as attacking or supporting allied characters through statistic-enhancing abilities, or they can wait until the next turn. When attacking, the game transitions from the top-down view of the map to a side-view battlefield, where a cinematic battle plays between the player and enemy units. Each unit has access to different weapons and items, but these will break {{after a number of}} uses and must be repaired in between missions. The effectiveness of melee weapons is dictated with the series' recurring Weapons Triangle mechanic: axes are strong against lances, lances strong against swords, and swords strong against axes. Villages found during map battles will be attacked; if defended by the player, non-player characters within the village will give hints about future objectives. A map is cleared when the boss is defeated. If characters fall in battle, they are subjected to permanent death, removing them {{from the rest of the}} game. If Roy dies, the game ends and the map must be restarted.|$|E

25|$|As {{of school}} year 2011-2012, adult {{education}} was launched {{under the name}} Druga šansa (Second chance). Its purpose is to educate people who didn't graduate primary or high school or both, so they could have better chances of getting a work. Most people attending adult education are minors who missed <b>their</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> enroll in primary schools (most of them being of Roma descent).|$|E
25|$|The final {{tally of}} prisoners {{taken in the}} Ruhr reached 325,000, far beyond {{anything}} the Americans had anticipated.

Also looking forward to going home, tens of thousands of freed forced laborers and Allied prisoners of war further strained the American logistical system.|$|E

Despite a {{first up}} win against Namibia, Uganda lost their remaining four Group A matches {{and failed to}} make the Super Eight stage, thus ending <b>their</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> qualify for the 2011 Cricket World Cup. Uganda finished 10th overall after beating Denmark but losing to Bermuda in positional playoff matches, and thus was relegated to 2013 ICC World Cricket League Division Three.|$|E

25|$|The NL {{then had}} <b>their</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> {{score in the}} twelfth off Joakim Soria, {{with the bases loaded}} and one out. Soria struck out Dan Uggla, and was {{relieved}} by George Sherrill, who struck out Adrian Gonzalez to end the threat. In the bottom of the inning, Carlos Guillén hit a long fly ball that bounced off the left field wall for a double. After advancing to third base after a Grady Sizemore groundout, Cook, pitching his third inning of relief, struck out Longoria. Morneau was intentionally walked, and advanced to second base on defensive indifference. Cook got Ian Kinsler to ground out to end the inning.|$|E
25|$|Redwoods often grow {{in areas}} prone to flooding. Deposits of {{sediment}} following floods can form impermeable barriers which suffocate tree roots, and the unstable soil {{in flooded areas}} often causes trees to lean to one side, increasing <b>their</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> be toppled over by wind. Immediately after a flood, redwoods grow their existing roots upwards into recently deposited sediment layers. A second root system then develops from adventitious buds on the newly buried trunk and the old root system dies. To counter lean, redwoods will increase wood production on their vulnerable side, creating a supporting buttress. These adaptations create forests of almost exclusively redwood trees in flood-prone regions.|$|E
25|$|Since Pedro II {{would only}} be 18 in 1843, an elected regency was created to replace the emperor during his minority. The country became {{in all but the}} name a republic. Joaquim Nabuco, writing in the 1890s, remarked that the Brazilian {{republicans}} saw this period as <b>their</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> prove that the country could survive in peace without a monarch as superior arbiter, as a neutral character above rival parties. However, this republican experience proved itself to be a complete disaster: as a republic, Brazil was no better than its Hispanic-American neighbors. The regency had little effective authority which resulted in nine years of chaos during which the country was plagued by rebellions and coup attempts initiated by unruly political factions.|$|E

50|$|In a 5-option MBC, by contrast, {{votes for}} only 1 option thus gives the {{favorite}} just 1 point; votes for 2 options give first preference 2 points (and second preference 1 point). To ensure the favorite gets the maximum 5 points, therefore, all 5 preferences should be cast. The MBC thus encourages voters {{to submit a}} fully marked ballot {{at the expense of}} giving candidates other than a favorite a higher rankings, increasing <b>their</b> <b>chances</b> <b>to</b> win as well.|$|R
25|$|The match {{closed with}} {{two days of}} rain, though Bermuda had already lost <b>their</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> qualify for the semi-finals early on the second day, after being bowled out for 133 and Kenya surpassed that score {{for the loss of}} three wickets. Thomas Odoyo took five wickets for Kenya in the first innings, and though Saleem Mukuddem responded with three on the first day and three on the second, Kenya made it to 205 all out after 66 from Steve Tikolo and 54 from Tanmay Mishra. After batting through 15 overs for no loss, Bermuda lost two wickets in an over to Hiren Varaiya and were 19 for two when bad {{conditions}} stopped play on the second day. The players could not return, and the game was called off as a draw.|$|E
25|$|On October 31, 2009, {{while playing}} against the Georgia Bulldogs, Tebow ran for his 50th and 51st rushing touchdowns, {{breaking}} the SEC career record previously held by former Georgia running back Herschel Walker.

Tebow threw for 245 {{yards and a}} touchdown and led the team with 63 yards rushing, but the Gators fell 32–13 and lost <b>their</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> play for a second consecutive national title. Florida beat Cincinnati 51–24 in the 2010 Sugar Bowl the following January. In what was Tebow's last college game, he completed 31-of-35 passes for 482 yards and three touchdowns and accounted for four total touchdowns and 533 yards of total offense, which set a record for a Bowl Championship Series game. He graduated from the University of Florida in December 2009.|$|E
25|$|In fall 2010, Norwood {{appeared}} as a contestant on season 11 of the ABC reality show Dancing with the Stars, partnered with Maksim Chmerkovskiy.

In August 2011, it was confirmed that Norwood had signed a joint record deal with RCA Records and producer Breyon Prescott's Chameleon Records. In September, a new talent show, Majors & Minors, created by musician Evan Bogart, premiered on The Hub. It followed a group of young performers age 10–16 and <b>their</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> be mentored by some established artists such as Norwood, Ryan Tedder and Leona Lewis.

5000|$|The Link {{was called}} a [...] "bloodsucker" [...] by housing estate {{residents}} after the company acquired the Housing Authority shopping centres, renovated them, and raised rents.

30|$|All {{applicants}} {{who applied}} via an anonymous standardized application form {{were asked to}} answer a short survey about their experiences with this application method. As only the candidates who were reviewed with this method actively take notice of the anonymous job applications, this survey population displays a selection out of all applicants {{that were part of}} the experiment. About 41 percent of the applicants self-evaluate <b>their</b> <b>chances</b> <b>to</b> receive an interview invitation as higher with anonymous job applications and about 33 percent rate <b>their</b> <b>chances</b> <b>to</b> be equal between anonymous and non-anonymous hiring methods. About 48 percent of the respondents generally prefer anonymous job applications over standard ones, whereas 31 percent prefer the opposite. Moreover, a majority of 44 percent do not rate the time spent for the application process as being different between anonymous and standard applications, whereas 31 percent claim to need more time for standard applications.
