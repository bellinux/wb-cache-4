25|$|Violet rings {{have several}} unique abilities. They can create {{crystals}} {{which can be}} used to imprison members of other Lantern Corps on Zamaron. Over time, the rings of the prisoners trapped in stasis within the crystals are infected with violet energy. After spending enough time inside, the prisoner will emerge as a Star Sapphire. The rings can also detect when a love is in jeopardy, locate it, and then create a connection to the embattled heart that {{can be used as a}} tether. Sapphires are also shown as being able to show others their greatest love. Unlike constructs created by Green Lanterns, Orange Lanterns cannot absorb those made by Star Sapphires. Star Sapphires appear to be able to teleport in order to escape attackers, while their energy constructs release a disorienting dust when destroyed. These two abilities can be combined effectively to avoid being pursued. Violet power rings have the ability to restore the recently deceased to life by drawing power from the heart of one <b>that</b> <b>loves</b> them.|$|E

Similar sentiments come from Bruce Eder of AllMusic, who writes: [...] "'The Lord Loves the One (<b>That</b> <b>Loves</b> the Lord)', despite its title, is the high point of the record, a fast, rollicking, funky, bluesy jewel with a priceless guitar break (maybe the best of Harrison's solo career)..." ...|$|E
500|$|Author Dale Allison {{writes of}} the lyrical themes in [...] "The Lord Loves the One (<b>That</b> <b>Loves</b> the Lord)": [...] "this song preaches karma, warns about {{judgment}} at death, and exalts love as {{our most important}} aspiration." [...] Harrison wrote the song over 1971–72, a period of heightened devotion on his part, {{as well as one}} of frustration due to the legal and business issues afflicting his Concert for Bangladesh aid project. The idea for the composition came about after a conversation with Prabhupada, when the latter visited Harrison at Friar Park.|$|E

500|$|... "The Lord Loves the One (<b>That</b> <b>Loves</b> the Lord)" [...] {{is a song}} by English {{musician}} George Harrison, {{released on}} his 1973 album Living in the Material World. Like the album's title track, it {{was inspired by the}} teachings of A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, founder of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON), more commonly known as the Hare Krishna movement. The song is an uptempo rock track with elements of blues and gospel. Some commentators have described it as the musical highpoint of Living in the Material World, with Harrison's slide guitar playing singled out as being among the finest performances of his career.|$|E

500|$|Harrison began {{sessions}} for his Living in the Material World album in October 1972, at Apple Studio in London. As {{a result of}} the problems associated with the Bangladesh project, author Peter Doggett writes, [...] "verything connected with the physical world seemed to annoy him." [...] The studio manager at the time, former Beatles engineer Geoff Emerick, recalls Harrison wearing his Hindu prayer bag and [...] "mumbling away, chanting his mantra", often unable to reply to questions put to him. As for all the tracks on the album, the recording engineer on [...] "The Lord Loves the One (<b>That</b> <b>Loves</b> the Lord)" [...] was Phil McDonald, who had also worked in that capacity for the Beatles.|$|E
500|$|The series {{presents}} {{nature as}} a force by turns benevolent and malign. It is shown at times to be oblivious to and uninterested {{in the safety of}} humanity. Hall argues, [...] "In all of these poems, nature would seem to betray the heart <b>that</b> <b>loves</b> her". The imagery used to evoke these notions serves to separate Lucy from everyday reality. The literary theorist Frances Ferguson (b. 1947) notes that the [...] "flower similes and metaphors become impediments rather than aids to any imaginative visualization of a woman; the flowers do not simply locate themselves in Lucy's cheeks, they expand to absorb the whole of her ... The act of describing seems to have lost touch with its goal—description of Lucy." ...|$|E
500|$|In his 1980 autobiography, I, Me, Mine, George Harrison {{credits the}} {{influence}} for [...] "The Lord Loves the One (<b>That</b> <b>Loves</b> the Lord)" [...] to A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, {{founder of the}} International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON), {{also known as the}} Hare Krishna movement. Harrison's association with ISKCON began in December 1968, when he befriended a small group of devotees that Prabhupada had sent to London to establish what became the Radha Krishna Temple. The Gaudiya Vaishnava teachings of Prabhupada, based on Hindu texts such as the Bhagavad Gita, resonated with Harrison, whose quest for an ego-less, God-conscious existence amid the false reality of Beatlemania had first taken him to India in September 1966.|$|E

500|$|Apple Records {{released}} Living in the Material World on 30 May 1973. [...] "Be Here Now" [...] {{appeared as}} the second track on side two of the original LP format, following what Rodriguez describes as the [...] "funky uptempo" [...] "The Lord Loves the One (<b>That</b> <b>Loves</b> the Lord)". It marked {{the first of four}} consecutive ballads on that side, which some music critics objected to at the time. Never a fan of Harrison's solo work, Robert Christgau would comment on the album: [...] "Harrison sings as if he's doing sitar impressions, and four different people, including a little man in my head who I never noticed before, have expressed intense gratitude when I turned the damned thing off during 'Be Here Now'." ...|$|E

More than 30 countries have depicted the bird on their stamps – Australia, Great Britain, Chile and France have each issued several.

500|$|Rather than revisit {{compositions}} {{left over}} from the All Things Must Pass sessions, Harrison's material for Living in the Material World was drawn from the 1971–72 period, with the exception of [...] "Try Some, Buy Some", which he wrote in 1970 and recorded with former Ronette Ronnie Spector in February 1971. The songs reflected his spiritual devotion – in the case of [...] "The Lord Loves the One (<b>That</b> <b>Loves</b> the Lord)", [...] "Living in the Material World", [...] "Give Me Love (Give Me Peace on Earth)" [...] and [...] "Try Some, Buy Some" [...] – as well as his feelings before and after the Bangladesh benefit concerts, with [...] "Miss O'Dell" [...] and [...] "The Day the World Gets 'Round".|$|E

500|$|While {{identifying}} a similar ISKCON-inspired theme in Harrison's 1973 song [...] "The Lord Loves the One (<b>That</b> <b>Loves</b> the Lord)", Allison discusses [...] "Awaiting on You All" [...] as {{a precedent for}} further statements by Harrison against organised religion, particularly Catholicism. Among these, Harrison parodied the Last Supper in his inner-gatefold artwork for Living in the Material World (1973), dressed as a Catholic priest and again mocking the [...] "perceived materialism and violence of the Roman church", according to Allison. In addition, {{in his role as}} film producer, Harrison supported Monty Python's controversial parodying of the biblical story of Christ in Life of Brian (1979), about which he said: [...] "Actually, [...] was upholding Him and knocking all the idiotic stuff that goes on around religion." ...|$|E

[...] The creative directors were Kevin Proudfoot and Todd Waterbury. Waterbury explained, [...] "We thought {{of the fact that}} a version of him is alive in everyone <b>that</b> <b>loves</b> basketball.

500|$|In mid-2013, guitarist John Petrucci {{began writing}} {{a story for}} a concept album, {{presenting}} it {{to the rest of}} Dream Theater about a year later.

The involvement of everybody at Roadrunner has been absolutely unbelievable, so supportive. It kind of ignited the secret nerd in all of us <b>that</b> <b>loves</b> this sort of stuff, because it's fun, it's different."
