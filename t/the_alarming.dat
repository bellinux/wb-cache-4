5|$|Later on, {{being told}} by his brother, Jerome, of some gossip overheard by a waiter between British {{officers}} at lunch at the 'King of Spain' inn in Genappe that the Prussians were to march over from Wavre, Napoleon declared that the Prussians would need at least two days to recover and would {{be dealt with by}} Grouchy. Surprisingly, Jerome's overheard gossip aside, the French commanders present at the pre-battle conference at Le Caillou had no information about <b>the</b> <b>alarming</b> proximity of the Prussians and did not suspect that Blücher's men would start erupting onto the field of battle in great numbers just five hours later.|$|E

Hitler also suspected that Röhm was plotting to depose him, so he ordered the deaths of Röhm and other political enemies. Up to 200 people were killed from 30 June to 2 July 1934 in an event that became known as the Night of the Long Knives. After this purge, the SA was no longer a major force.|$|E

5|$|Andrée ignored many {{early signs}} of the dangers {{associated}} with his balloon plan. Being able to steer the balloon to some extent was essential for a safe journey, and {{there was plenty of}} evidence that the drag-rope steering technique he had invented was ineffective; yet he staked the fate of the expedition on drag ropes. Worse, the polar balloon Örnen (The Eagle) was delivered directly to Svalbard from its manufacturer in Paris without being tested; when measurements showed it to be leaking more than expected, Andrée refused to acknowledge <b>the</b> <b>alarming</b> implications. Most modern students of the expedition see Andrée's optimism, faith in the power of technology, and disregard for the forces of nature as the main factors in the series of events that led to his death and those of his two companions Nils Strindberg (1872–97) and Knut Frænkel (1870–97).|$|E

Historian Gillian Gill believes that Sophia secretly gave birth to the child and that this is the reason Sophia never married. Alison Weir and others, however, write of a possible marriage between Sophia and Garth the same year as the child's birth, but {{there is no evidence to}} back this assertion other than the presence of a wedding ring in a portrait of an aged Sophia.|$|E
5|$|In 1164-65 Manuel's cousin Andronikos, {{the future}} emperor, escaped from captivity in Byzantium and {{fled to the}} court of Yaroslav in Galicia. This situation, holding out <b>the</b> <b>alarming</b> {{prospect}} of Andronikos making a bid for Manuel's throne sponsored by both Galicia and Hungary, spurred the Byzantines into an unprecedented flurry of diplomacy. Manuel pardoned Andronikos and persuaded him to return to Constantinople in 1165. A mission to Kiev, then ruled by Prince Rostislav, resulted in a favourable treaty and a pledge to supply the Empire with auxiliary troops; Yaroslav of Galicia was also persuaded to renounce his Hungarian connections and return fully into the imperial fold. As late as 1200 the princes of Galicia were providing invaluable services against the enemies of the Empire, at that time the Cumans.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 19th century, due to hunting, the Alpine ibex survived in the Gran Paradiso and Vanoise area. Approximately 60 {{individual}} ibex survived, here. Ibex were intensively hunted, partly for sport, {{but also because}} their body parts were thought to have therapeutic properties: talismans were made from a small cross-shaped bone near the ibex's heart {{in order to protect}} against violent death. Due to <b>the</b> <b>alarming</b> decrease in the ibex population, Victor Emmanuel, soon to be King of Italy, declared the Royal Hunting Reserve of the Gran Paradiso in 1856. A protective guard was created for the ibex. Paths laid out for the ibex are still used today as part of 724 kilometres (450mi) of marked trails and mule tracks.|$|E

Joining his men in Warsaw, Nansouty diligently led them towards his assigned destination, but did not arrive until 13 February 1807, {{five days after the}} Battle of Eylau and too late to take part in any action. On 14 February, Nansouty learned of the death of his comrade and former commander during the Revolutionary Wars, General d'Hautpoul, who had been fatally wounded during the heroic cavalry charges at Eylau. After the battle, the Emperor decided that the army was to take winter quarters. To ensure the safety of his outposts, he sent Murat with a powerful column, including Nansouty's men, with the mission of pushing back any enemy they might find. A short skirmish involving the 1st heavy cavalry division occurred at Wolfsdorf on 10 March, before it was decided that all the heavy cavalry would be sent to the lower Vistula, where they were to rest and be reinforced.|$|E

50|$|Another {{consideration}} {{is how the}} sensor (through its cable, if applicable) is attached to its alarm or transmitter {{in the case of}} wired alarms or wireless alarms. Some wireless alarms are truly wireless, with the transmitter being part of the sensor and completely self-contained.

The attachment mechanism to <b>the</b> <b>alarm,</b> through which <b>the</b> electric current flows to <b>the</b> <b>alarm,</b> is important. If it is easily detached (unintentionally comes out from <b>the</b> <b>alarm</b> during use) <b>the</b> <b>alarm</b> may not be triggered.

In 1637, Aurangzeb married the Safavid princess Dilras Banu Begum, posthumously known as Rabia-ud-Daurani. She was his first wife and chief consort as well as his favourite. He also had an infatuation with a slave girl, Hira Bai, whose death at a young age greatly affected him. In his old age, he was under the charms of his concubine, Udaipuri Bai.

25|$|The {{trade of}} enslaved Africans in the Atlantic has {{its origins in}} the explorations of Portuguese mariners down the coast of West Africa in the 15th century. Before that, contact with African slave markets was made to ransom Portuguese who had been {{captured}} by the intense North African Barbary pirate attacks on Portuguese ships and coastal villages, frequently leaving them depopulated. The first Europeans to use enslaved Africans in the New World were the Spaniards, who sought auxiliaries for their conquest expeditions and labourers on islands such as Cuba and Hispaniola. <b>The</b> <b>alarming</b> decline in the native population had spurred the first royal laws protecting them (Laws of Burgos, 1512–13). The first enslaved Africans arrived in Hispaniola in 1501. After Portugal had succeeded in establishing sugar plantations (engenhos) in northern Brazil ca. 1545, Portuguese merchants on the West African coast began to supply enslaved Africans to the sugar planters. While at first these planters had relied almost exclusively on the native Tupani for slave labour, after 1570 they began importing Africans, {{as a series of}} epidemics had decimated the already destabilized Tupani communities. By 1630, Africans had replaced the Tupani as the largest contingent of labour on Brazilian sugar plantations. This ended the European medieval household tradition of slavery, resulted in Brazil's receiving the most enslaved Africans, and revealed sugar cultivation and processing as the reason that roughly 84% of these Africans were shipped to the New World.|$|E

50|$|Belding's ground {{squirrel}} provides an example. The {{ground squirrel}} gives an alarm call to warn its local {{group of the}} presence of a predator. By emitting <b>the</b> <b>alarm,</b> it gives its own location away, putting itself in more danger. In the process, however, the squirrel may protect its relatives within the local group (along {{with the rest of the}} group). Therefore, if the effect of the trait influencing <b>the</b> <b>alarm</b> call typically protects the other squirrels in the immediate area, it will lead to the passing on of more copies of <b>the</b> <b>alarm</b> call trait in the next generation than the squirrel could leave by reproducing on its own. In such a case natural selection will increase the trait that influences giving <b>the</b> <b>alarm</b> call, provided that a sufficient fraction of the shared genes include the gene(s) predisposing to <b>the</b> <b>alarm</b> call.|$|R
