5|$|Among {{the many}} {{accounts}} of ancient breeds of piebald sheep {{is the story}} of Jacob from the first book of <b>the</b> <b>Hebrew</b> <b>Bible,</b> called by Christians the Old Testament.

Due to the resemblance to the animal described in Genesis, the Jacob sheep was named for the Biblical figure of Jacob sometime in the 20th century.|$|E

5|$|Biblical Hebrew as {{preserved}} in <b>the</b> <b>Hebrew</b> <b>Bible</b> {{is composed of}} multiple linguistic layers. The consonantal skeleton of the text is the most ancient, while the vocalization and cantillation are later additions reflecting a later stage of the language.

Biblical Hebrew as reflected in the consonantal text of the Bible and in extra-biblical inscriptions may be subdivided by era.|$|E
5|$|Biblical Hebrew is best-attested in <b>the</b> <b>Hebrew</b> <b>Bible,</b> the {{collection}} of Judaic religious and historical texts which reflect various stages of the Hebrew language in its consonantal skeleton, {{as well as a}} vocalic system which was added in the Middle Ages by the Masoretes.

5|$|Like the Septuagint, the Greek {{translation}} of <b>the</b> <b>Hebrew</b> <b>Bible</b> that predated the Imperial era, Jewish literature in Greek under the Empire was written mainly for Jews who spoke Greek.

The term 'Biblical Hebrew' may or may not include extra-biblical texts, such as inscriptions (e.g. the Siloam inscription), and generally also includes later vocalization traditions for the Hebrew Bible's consonantal text, most commonly the early medieval Tiberian vocalization.|$|E
5|$|According to Martin Noth, {{a scholar}} of <b>the</b> <b>Hebrew</b> <b>Bible,</b> the {{narratives}} of Isaac date back to an older cultural stage {{than that of the}} West-Jordanian Jacob. At that era, the Israelite tribes were not yet sedentary. In the course of looking for grazing areas, they had come in contact in southern Philistia with the inhabitants of the settled countryside. The biblical historian A. Jopsen believes in the connection between the Isaac traditions and the north, and in support of this theory adduces Amos 7:9 ("the high places of Isaac").|$|E
5|$|Literature {{also served}} {{religious}} purposes. Beginning with the Pyramid Texts of the Old Kingdom, works of funerary literature written on tomb walls, {{and later on}} coffins, and papyri placed within tombs, were designed to protect and nurture souls in their afterlife. This included the use of magical spells, incantations, and lyrical hymns. Copies of non-funerary literary texts found in non-royal tombs suggest that the dead could entertain themselves in the afterlife by reading these teaching texts and narrative tales.

5|$|Ways of life {{often viewed}} as more rigid, such as {{soldiers}} and religious cultures, frequently have explicit rules regarding hair length.

Similarly, religious men with long hair include the Nazarites of <b>the</b> <b>Hebrew</b> <b>Bible</b> (Samson being a famous example) and the Sikhs. Subservient cultures may view male long hair negatively, and are sometimes detected by their rulers through hair length, {{as was the case with}} the Gaelic Irish under English rule and the Moors under Spanish rule in Medieval Spain.|$|E
5|$|Amon {{was the son}} of King Manasseh of Judah and Meshullemeth, a {{daughter}} of Haruz of Jotbah. Although the date is unknown, <b>the</b> <b>Hebrew</b> <b>Bible</b> records that he married Jedidah, the daughter of Adaiah of Bozkath. Amon began his reign of Judah at the age of 22, and reigned for two years. Biblical scholar and archeologist William F. Albright has dated his reign to 642 – 640, while professor E. R. Thiele offers the dates 643/642– 641/640. Thiele's dates are tied to the reign of Amon's son Josiah, whose death at the hands of Pharaoh Necho II occurred in the summer of 609. Josiah's death, which is independently confirmed in Egyptian history, places the end of Amon's reign, 31 years earlier, in 641 or 640 and the beginning of his rule in 643 or 642.|$|E
5|$|Gaza is also {{mentioned}} in <b>the</b> <b>Hebrew</b> <b>Bible</b> {{as the place}} where Samson was imprisoned and met his death. The prophets Amos and Zephaniah {{are believed to have}} prophesied that Gaza would be deserted. According to biblical accounts, Gaza fell to Israelite rule, from the reign of King David in the early 11th century BCE. When the United Monarchy split in about 930 BCE, Gaza became a part of the northern Kingdom of Israel. When the Kingdom of Israel fell to the Assyrians under Tiglath-Pileser III and Sargon II around 730 BCE, Gaza came under Assyrian rule. In the 7th century, it again came under Egyptian control, but during the Persian period (6th-4th centuries BCE) it enjoyed a certain independence and flourished. In 529 BCE, Cambyses I unsuccessfully attacked Gaza and later, around 520 BCE, the Greeks established a trading post in Gaza. The first coins were minted on the Athens model around 380 BCE.|$|E

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Hebrew</b> <b>Bible's</b> {{suggestion}} that Jerusalem was victorious rather than defeated, is corroborated by the Jewish historian Josephus. He quotes Berossus, a well-known Babylonian historian, that a pestilence {{broke out in}} the army camp. According to Herodotus, though, field mice chewed at the leather of their weapons and rendered them useless. It is more likely that the mice described by Herodotus were the cause of the pestilence described by Berossus. Nevertheless, as all of these are expansions on <b>the</b> <b>Hebrew</b> <b>Bible's</b> account, adding Midrash, none are independent witnesses. In any case, most scholars are in agreement that Sennacherib suffered a humiliating defeat while besieging Jerusalem, and that he went back to Nineveh, never to return. [...] "Like Xerxes in Greece, Sennacherib never recovered from the shock of the disaster in Judah. He made no more expeditions against either the Southern Levant or Egypt." ...|$|R
5|$|The Black Stone {{was held}} in reverence well before the preaching of Islam by Muhammad. It had long been {{associated}} with the Kaaba, which was built in the pre-Islamic period and was a site of pilgrimage of Nabateans who visited the shrine once a year to perform their pilgrimage. The Kaaba held 360 idols of the Meccan gods. The Semitic cultures of the Middle East had a tradition of using unusual stones to mark places of worship, a phenomenon which is reflected in <b>the</b> <b>Hebrew</b> <b>Bible</b> as well as the Qur'an, although bowing to or kissing such sacred objects is repeatedly described in the Tanakh as idolatrous and was the subject of prophetic rebuke. The meteorite-origin theory of the Black Stone has seen it likened by some writers to the meteorite which was placed and worshipped in the Greek Temple of Artemis. Some writers remark on the apparent similarity of the Black Stone and its frame to the external female genitalia, and ascribe this to its earlier association with fertility rites of Arabia.|$|E
5|$|According to <b>the</b> <b>Hebrew</b> <b>Bible,</b> Solomon's Temple {{was built}} atop {{what is known}} as the Temple Mount in the 10th century BCE and {{destroyed}} by the Babylonians in 586 BCE, and the Second Temple completed and dedicated in 516 BCE. Around 19 BCE Herod the Great began a massive expansion project on the Temple Mount. In addition to fully rebuilding and enlarging the Temple, he artificially expanded the platform on which it stood, doubling it in size. Today's Western Wall formed part of the retaining perimeter wall of this platform. In 2011, Israeli archaeologists announced the surprising discovery of Roman coins minted well after Herod's death, found under the foundation stones of the wall. The excavators came upon the coins inside a ritual bath that predates Herod's building project, which was filled in to create an even base for the wall and was located under its southern section. This seems to indicate that Herod did not finish building the entire wall by the time of his death in 4 BCE. The find confirms the description by historian Josephus Flavius, which states that construction was finished only during the reign of King Agrippa II, Herod’s great-grandson. Given Josephus' information, the surprise mainly regarded the fact that an unfinished retaining wall in this area could also mean that at least parts of the splendid Royal Stoa and the monumental staircase leading up to it could not have been completed during Herod's lifetime. Also surprising was the fact that the usually very thorough Herodian builders had cut corners by filling in the ritual bath, rather than placing the foundation course directly onto the much firmer bedrock. Some scholars are doubtful of the interpretation and have offered alternative explanations, such as, for example, later repair work.|$|E
5|$|When {{the forces}} of Yekuno Amlak (r. 1270–1285) toppled the Zagwe dynasty in 1270 {{he became the first}} Emperor of Ethiopia, {{establishing}} a line of rulers in the Solomonic dynasty that would last into the 20th century. By this time the Greek language, once pivotal for translation in Ethiopian literature, had become marginalized and mixed with Coptic and Arabic translations. This contributed to a process by which medieval Ethiopian historians created a new historiographic tradition largely divorced from the ancient Aksumite textual corpus. The Solomonic kings professed a direct link to the kings of Aksum and a lineage traced back to Solomon and the Queen of Sheba in <b>the</b> <b>Hebrew</b> <b>Bible.</b> These genealogical traditions formed the basis of the Kebra Nagast, a seminal work of Ethiopian literature and Ge'ez-language text originally compiled in Copto-Arabic sometime between the 10th and 13th centuries. Its current form dates to the 14th century, by which point it included detailed mythological and historical narratives relating to Ethiopia along with theological discourses on themes in the Old and New Testament. De Lorenzi compares the tome's mixture of Christian mythology with historical events to the legend of King Arthur that was greatly embellished by the Welsh cleric Geoffrey of Monmouth in his chronicle Historia Regum Britanniae of 1136. Although the Kebra Nagast indicates that the emperors of Rome or Constantinople and Ethiopia were descended from the Israelite king Solomon, there is an emphatically anti-Jewish sentiment expressed in several passages of the book.|$|E
