5|$|Legends {{describing}} Cofresí as malevolent generally link him to supernatural elements {{acquired through}} witchcraft, mysticism or {{a deal with}} the Devil. This horror fiction emphasizes his ruthlessness while alive or his unwillingness to remain dead. Cofresí's ghost has a fiery aura or extraordinary powers of manifestation, defending the locations of his hidden treasure or roaming aimlessly. Cofresí has been vilified by merchants. Legends portraying him as benign figure are more prevalent near Cabo Rojo; in other areas of Puerto Rico, they focus on his treasure and depict him as a cutthroat. Most of the hidden-treasure stories have a moral counseling against greed; <b>those</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> find the plunder are killed, dragged to Davy Jones' Locker or attacked by the ghost of Cofresí or a member of his crew. Rumors about the locations of hidden treasure flourish, with dozens of coves, beaches and buildings linked to pirates in Puerto Rico and Hispaniola.|$|E
5|$|The {{impact of}} meat ants on other species varies, {{depending}} on the habitat and type of food source, and the ecological role the ant plays. The deliberate exclusion of meat ants show that not only can they alter the amount of sources available, but the dynamics of resource use on entire outcrops. If present, meat ants rely on rapidly discovering food sources and retain their dominance so other ants cannot collect them, as well as exploitation and interference which helps displace other ants. The habitat meat ants live in may affect their dominance among the fauna. They are less successful in complex habitats and more successful in open areas, allowing workers to forage efficiently; for example, workers forage around rocks and collect food sources more successfully in contrast to those in vegetation. Meat ants are even more dominant than other I. purpureus species group members in non-complex habitats. Meat ants are normally larger than other Iridomyrmex species and can displace or even kill <b>those</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> compete for food sources. The similar behaviours among meat ants and certain Iridomyrmex species have increased the level of conflict among each other, especially those in open habitats.|$|E

Despite the earlier drenching of the building by firefighters, officials said they feared that MOVE would shoot at the firefighters. Eleven people (John Africa, five other adults, and five children aged 7 to 13) died in the resulting fire, and more than 250 {{people in the neighborhood}} were left homeless.

Prime sent him to the Speed Planet Velocitron to locate the planet's Cyber Planet Key. Much to Red Alert's displeasure, Hot Shot got increasingly involved in the planet's affairs, rescuing Brakedown from Ransack and Crumplezone.

25|$|While {{the rate}} of {{domestic}} violence among immigrant groups does not differ {{from that of the}} general population, immigrant victims of domestic violence may face additional challenges. While victims can be of either gender, women may be especially vulnerable. The process of immigrating to another country and adjusting to American culture can be stressful, increasing the likelihood of domestic violence. Factors such as limited English language ability, legal status, and lack of social ties may create additional barriers for <b>those</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> escape such situations. Even when a woman does have access to social services that could help her escape an abusive situation, cultural norms may make it difficult for her to leave. If a woman decides to leave an abusive spouse she may run the risk of social ostracism and of bringing shame to her family. Thus, a woman may choose to stay and suffer abuse rather than face the social consequences of leaving her husband.|$|E
25|$|In the colony, {{the queen}} is {{responsible}} {{for all of the}} foraging for the nest until workers mature. This includes foraging for wood to make into pulp for the nest as well as food for the larvae. Most workers begin to help with foraging the day after they emerge from the nest as adults. Almost immediately, they take over all foraging activity for the queen. The behavior of the workers who forage differs depending on their activity. <b>Those</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> catch flies move quickly from one flower head to the next and pounce on prey when it is found. In comparison, wasps that forage for nectar move slower and spend more time at each flower. Other workers collect pulp from dead wood to use for nest construction. It appears that if the wasp is unable to quickly catch a fly it goes on to collect nectar suggesting one worker does not always collect the same type of material. Different amounts of time are given to each activity with the most time spent gathering fluid, then pulp, and then flies. Foraging takes place from roughly sunrise to sunset of each day in order {{to keep up with the}} resources needed for the colony.|$|E

For over 200 years, the Mino Province (including the present-day city of Gifu) was under control of the Toki Clan, a powerful regional clan.

500|$|Stuntman Derek Mears {{was hired}} to portray Jason Voorhees at the {{recommendation}} of special make-up effects supervisor Scott Stoddard. Before the producers contacted him, Mears had already heard about {{the production of a}} new Friday the 13th and had decided to start physical training so he could pursue the role. He was unaware that Stoddard and other industry professionals were suggesting him to the producers. The studio worried that Mears' pleasant demeanor might affect his ability to portray a menacing character, but Mears assured them he was suitable for the role. According to Mears, [...] "They were like, 'You're really nice...are you {{going to be able to}} switch over, right?' I was like, 'I cage fight..and I've got a lot of dad issues. So yeah.'". Mears said he related to [...] "Jason the victim" [...] when he was growing up, and he wanted to portray Jason as a victim in the film.
