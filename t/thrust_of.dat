5|$|Hamlet's soliloquies {{have also}} {{captured}} the attention of scholars. Hamlet interrupts himself, vocalising either disgust or agreement with himself, and embellishing his own words. He has difficulty expressing himself directly and instead blunts the <b>thrust</b> <b>of</b> his thought with wordplay. It is not until late in the play, after his experience with the pirates, that Hamlet is able to articulate his feelings freely.|$|E

5|$|The CFM56 is {{designed}} to support several reverse thrust systems which help slow and stop the aircraft after landing. The variants built for the Boeing737, the CFM56-3 and the CFM56-7, use a cascade type of thrust reverser. This type of thrust reverse consists of sleeves that slide back to expose mesh-like cascades and blocker doors that block the bypass air flow. The blocked bypass air is forced through the cascades, reducing the <b>thrust</b> <b>of</b> the engine and slowing the aircraft down.|$|E
5|$|The Increased Performance Engine (IPE) program {{led to the}} 29,588lbf (131.6kN) F110-GE-129 on the Block 50 and 29,160lbf (129.4kN) F100-PW-229 on the Block 52. F-16s began {{flying with}} these IPE engines in the early 1990s. Altogether, of the 1,446 F-16C/Ds ordered by the USAF, 556 were fitted with F100-series engines and 890 with F110s. The United Arab Emirates’ Block 60 is powered by the General Electric F110-GE-132 {{turbofan}} with a maximum <b>thrust</b> <b>of</b> 32,500lbf (144.6kN), the highest thrust engine developed for the F-16.|$|E
5|$|The main <b>thrust</b> <b>of</b> William Paley's {{argument}} in Natural Theology is that God's {{design of the}} whole creation {{can be seen in}} the general happiness, or well-being, that is evident in the physical and social order of things. This sets the book within the broad tradition of the Enlightenment's natural theology; and this explains why Paley based much of his thought on John Ray (1691), William Derham (1711) and Bernard Nieuwentyt (1750).|$|E

5|$|After a few days, {{the main}} <b>thrust</b> <b>of</b> the {{offensive}} was halted south of Rimini by strong resistance and severe weather, and the British and Indian flanking forces began to push westwards, taking the frontline towards San Marino. On 17 September the 4th Indian Infantry Division attacked {{forces of the}} 278. Infanterie-Division holding two hills just across the Sammarinese border; after heavy fighting {{to gain control of}} the hills, the situation stabilised on the 19th, and Allied forces began to push into the city of San Marino itself. The city was captured by the afternoon of 20 September, and the 4th Indian Division left the country on the 21st, leaving it {{under the control of the}} local defence forces.|$|E
5|$|An ambush predator, the Pacific {{angelshark}} conceals {{itself on}} the sea floor and waits for approaching prey, primarily bony fishes and squid. Prey are targeted visually and, with a quick upward <b>thrust</b> <b>of</b> the head, snatched in protrusible jaws. Individual sharks actively choose ideal ambush sites, where they stay for several days {{before moving on to}} a new one. This species is more active at night than during the day, when it stays buried in sediment and seldom moves. Reproduction is ovoviviparous, with the embryos hatching inside the mother's uterus and being sustained by a yolk sac until birth. Females give birth to an average of six young every spring.|$|E

5|$|Bede wrote Ecgbert {{a letter}} dealing with monastic {{issues as well}} as the {{problems}} of large dioceses. The letter, written in 734, became known as the Epistola ad Ecgberhtum episcopum. Bede urged Ecgbert to study Gregory the Great's Pastoral Care, and held up Aidan and Cuthbert as examples of model bishops. The main <b>thrust</b> <b>of</b> Bede's letter was to urge Ecgbert to reform his church to more closely resemble Gregory the Great's original plan for it. Bede's admonition to divide up dioceses fell on deaf ears, as Egbert did not break up his large diocese. The suffragans continued to be limited to the bishops of Hexham, Lindisfarne, and Whithorn.|$|E
5|$|On 24 February 1944, the Eighth Air Force {{attempted}} {{to repeat the}} success of 20 February. 1st and 2nd Divisions flew due east towards Germany and the 3rd Division east-northeast without escort. After crossing into Schleswig-Holstein they attacked targets along the Baltic sea coast. The 1st and 2nd Divisions {{were considered to be}} the main <b>thrust</b> <b>of</b> the attack and the 3rd Division went unmolested. The B-24 bombers of the 2nd Division were scheduled to bomb Gotha and JG 1 were directed to attack these B-24s. Due to strong tailwinds and flying at lower altitude, the bombers were separated from their escorting fighters and JG 1 reached Gotha before the bombers. Major Heinz Bär led II./JG 1 in a diving attack and claimed four B-24s while I./JG 1 attacked head-on and claimed five B-24s downed.|$|E
5|$|On August 14, Governor Stanley {{announced}} {{publicly that}} the main <b>thrust</b> <b>of</b> his legislative proposal would be to withhold funds from any local school district which integrated.

Stanley said he would not oppose the Gray Commission's proposal to assign students on the basis of factors other than race (which might lead to some integration). Stanley's concession, the Washington Post reported, was made because it was widely assumed that the Gray Commission was assumed to be strongly in favor of the pupil assignment plan and the tuition grant proposal.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The aim of {{this article}} is to point out the {{complicated}} internal structure <b>of</b> Paleoalpine <b>thrusts</b> <b>of</b> the Western Carpathians and the consequential ambiguous interpretations of the tectonic transport of these tectonic units. The example used here is that of the internal structure <b>of</b> the Križná <b>thrust</b> system in the area of the Demänová and II'anová Valleys in Nízke Tatry Mountains. The form that the Križná thrust takes is that <b>of</b> three individual <b>thrust</b> sheets. These overthrust each other along differently oriented thrust ramps. The geometry of the ramps influences the direction <b>of</b> the <b>thrust</b> displacement <b>of</b> the individual <b>thrust</b> sheets <b>of</b> the Križná <b>thrust...</b>|$|R
5|$|Operation Ferdinand formed part of Operation Bodyguard, a broad {{strategic}} military deception {{intended to}} confuse the Axis high command as to Allied intentions during the lead-up to the Normandy landings. During early 1944 the main <b>thrust</b> <b>of</b> deceptions in the Middle Eastern theatre were contained under Operation Zeppelin (including its sub-plan Vendetta), which developed threats against Greece and Southern France, and Operation Royal Flush, which ran political deceptions against Spain and Turkey. On 14 June the Allies committed to a landing in Southern France, codenamed Operation Dragoon (formerly Anvil). Royal Flush and Zeppelin were scaled back, to tone down the threat to France, and it was decided a new plan (Ferdinand) was required to cover the intended invasion.|$|E
5|$|The Comet 4 was {{a further}} {{improvement}} on the stretched Comet 3 with even greater fuel capacity. The design had progressed {{significantly from the}} original Comet 1, growing by 18ft 6in (5.64m) and typically seating 74 to 81 passengers compared to the Comet 1's 36 to 44 (119 passengers could be accommodated in a special charter seating package in the later 4C series). The Comet 4 was considered the definitive series, having a longer range, higher cruising speed and higher maximum takeoff weight. These improvements were possible largely because of Avon engines with twice the <b>thrust</b> <b>of</b> the Comet 1's Ghosts. Deliveries to BOAC began on 30 September 1958 with two 48-seat aircraft, which were used to initiate the first scheduled transatlantic services.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day, {{the situation}} deteriorated significantly when the German XLI Motorised Corps crossed the Yugoslav-Romanian border into the Yugoslav Banat and struck the 6th Army, halting its withdrawal and disrupting {{its ability to}} organise a coherent defence behind the Danube. Also on 10 April, the main <b>thrust</b> <b>of</b> the XLVI Motorised Corps of the 2nd Army, consisting of the 8th Panzer Division leading the 16th Motorised Infantry Division crossed the Drava at Barcs in the 4th Army sector. The 8th Panzer Division turned southeast between the Drava and Sava rivers, and meeting almost no resistance and with strong air support, had reached Slatina by evening, despite poor roads and bad weather.|$|E
