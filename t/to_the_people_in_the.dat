5|$|The Bhakti (devotional) {{movement}} was active during this time, and involved well known Haridasas (devotee saints) of that time. Like the Virashaiva {{movement of the}} 12th century, this movement presented another strong current of devotion, pervading the lives of millions. The haridasas represented two groups, the Vyasakuta and Dasakuta, the former being required to be proficient in the Vedas, Upanishads and other Darshanas, while the Dasakuta merely conveyed the message of Madhvacharya through the Kannada language <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> form of devotional songs (Devaranamas and Kirthanas). The philosophy of Madhvacharya was spread by eminent disciples such as Naraharitirtha, Jayatirtha, Sripadaraya, Vyasatirtha, Vadirajatirtha and others. Vyasatirtha, the guru (teacher) of Vadirajatirtha, Purandaradasa (Father of Carnatic music) and Kanakadasa earned the devotion of King Krishnadevaraya. The king considered the saint his Kuladevata (family deity) and honoured him in his writings. During this time, another great composer of early carnatic music, Annamacharya composed hundreds of Kirthanas in Telugu at Tirupati in present-day Andhra Pradesh.|$|E
5|$|The Vaishnava writers {{consisted}} of two groups {{who seemed to have}} no interaction with each other: the Brahmin commentators who typically wrote under the patronage of royalty; and the Bhakti (devotion) poets who played no role in courtly matters, instead taking the message of God <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> form of melodious songs composed using folk genres. Kumara Vyasa and Timmanna Kavi were well-known among the Brahmin commentators, while Purandara Dasa and Kanaka Dasa were the most famous of the Bhakti writers. The philosophy of Madhvacharya, which originated in the Kannada–speaking region in the 13th century, spread beyond its borders over the next two centuries. The itinerant haridasas, best described as mystic saint-poets, spread the philosophy of Madhvacharya in simple Kannada, winning mass appeal by preaching devotion to God and extolling the virtues of jnana (enlightenment), bhakti (devotion) and vairagya (detachment).|$|E
5|$|Jacqui meets divorcee Tony and an {{attraction}} igniting, they have sex. Tony goes away on holiday and starts {{a relationship with}} Jacqui on his return. Jacqui violates her prison tag after staying at Tony's house overnight so she is sent back to prison. Sadly, Tony is forced to dump her because he cannot handle the pressure. Jacqui befriends Becca Dean (Ali Bastian) but Becca is killed by another prisoner and Jacqui is devastated. Jacqui decides {{to make something of}} herself, not wanting to waste her life and is reunited with Tony and Davey returns with the favour. He forces Jacqui to marry Aleksander Malota (Jon Lolis). Jacqui and Aleksander manage to convince an immigration officer that their romance is genuine and they are married but Jacqui continues her affair with Tony secretly. The family uncover the truth about the marriage when Carmel and Alek's affair is revealed. Jacqui admits she married Alek to pay off her debt to Davey and is seeing Tony. Myra McQueen (Nicole Barber-Lane) is furious and orders Jacqui, Alek and Carmel to leave the house. Jacqui announces her pregnancy; Tony initially doesn't want the child, fearing that it may die like his previous child and their dreams are shattered when Jacqui miscarries and is left unable to have children of her own. Tony attacks Alek violently as he blames Alek as he cannot grieve for his baby publicly. Tony announces <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>The</b> Dog that the baby was his, not Alek's and Jacqui asks Alek to return to Albania so she can live her life and he agrees. Carmel is shocked to discover Alek is leaving, leaving Carmel devastated.

5|$|The main Monpa festivals held in {{the monastery}} are the Choksar, Losar, Ajilamu, and Torgya. Choksar is the festival when the Lamas recite {{religious}} scriptures in the monasteries. Following the religious recitations, the villagers carry the scriptures on their back and circumambulate their agricultural land seeking blessings for good yield of crops without any infestations by pests and to protect against attack by wild animals. In the Losar festival, which {{marks the beginning of}} the Tibetan New Year, people visit the monastery and offer prayers. Torgya, also known as Tawang-Torgya, is an annual festival that is exclusively {{held in the}} monastery. It is held according to the Buddhist calendar days of 28th to 30th of Dawachukchipa, which corresponds to 10 to 12 January of the Gregorian calendar, and is a Monpa celebration. The objective of the festival is to ward off evil spirits and ushering all round prosperity and happiness <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ensuing year. During the three-day festival, dances performed by artists in colorful costumes and masks are held in the courtyard, including the Pha Chan and the Losjker Chungiye, the latter of which is performed by the monks of the monastery. Each dance represents a myth and costumes and masks represent animal forms such as cows, tigers, sheep, monkeys and so forth.|$|E

In fact, he turned down offers to serve in the great monasteries in Kyoto, preferring to stay at Shoin-ji. Most of his instruction to the common people focused on living a morally virtuous life. Showing a surprising broad-mindedness, his ethical teachings drew on elements from Confucianism, ancient Japanese traditions, and traditional Buddhist teachings. He also never sought to stop the rural population from observing non-Zen traditions, despite the seeming intolerance for other schools' practices in his writings.|$|E

At the Chennai Egmore railway station, Velu's money is stolen by Speedu (Santhanam), a petty thief. He pursues Speedu on a motorbike parked at the station and manages to get back his money, but moments after alighting from the bike, the bike explodes. The parked bike had a bomb which was meant to ensure a terrorist attack at the railway station, and thus, Velu inadvertently thwarted a deadly terrorist attack which would have killed several people. After a few more incidents where Velu unknowingly prevents more terrorist attacks, {{he comes to the}} attention of Bharathi. She convinces him to take up the role of Velayudham and provide hope <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>people.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> avatar of Velayudham, Velu starts to eradicate the evils that pertain within the society such as corruption, prostitution and terrorism among others.

25|$|In the United States two photographers got {{involved}} {{at the end}} of the 19th century in favor of people on the margins of society, Jacob Riis and Lewis Hine. For them the camera was an instrument of accusation against social injustice. In 1890 Riis documented the living conditions of the unemployed and homeless in New York ("How the Other Half Lives"). He was also interested in the fate of immigrants, many of whom lived in extreme poverty in the New York slums. Riis clearly takes sides for the people he photographed and appeals to the social conscience of society. In 1908 the National Child Labor Committee hired Hine, a sociology professor who advocated photography as an educational medium, to document child labor in American industry. In the early 20th century Hine would publish thousands of photographs designed to pull at the nation's heartstrings. Child Labor was widespread in the U.S. in the early 20th century. Hine equally drew attention to the situation of immigrants. The work of Riis and Hine had political influence. Riis' commitment <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Mulberry Bend neighborhood led to its demolition. The building of schools and educational programs can also be attributed to Riis. Hine's work culminated in a law against child labor, the Keating-Owen Act of 1916, which was repealed shortly after the entry of the U.S. into the First World War.|$|E

25|$|Utah held {{intensely}} liberal {{views of}} women's suffrage {{and also a}} strong dedication to polygamy. <b>To</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> East, women's suffrage {{was seen as the}} opposite of polygamy. For many, the two ideals could not coincide because polygamy was seen as oppressive to women. Hamilton Wilcox, a New York suffragist (1867–1868), suggested women's suffrage should be experimented with in the territories. The East was heavily motivated to push women's enfranchisement in the Utah territory believing it would put an end to polygamy. By 1870 the idea became so popular and pushed by the East that Utah territorial legislature began debate over the right of women to vote. On February 12, 1870, after two weeks of debate a unanimous vote passed a bill enfranchising the women of Utah, fifty years before the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution guaranteed women nationwide the right to vote. However, instead of voting against plural marriage, Mormon women helped double the majority in favor of plural marriage by reelecting William H. Hooper, who defended polygamy. Froiseth, a long time believer in the enfranchisement of women and later {{the vice president of the}} Utah Women's Suffrage Association (1888), firmly believed Mormon women should not have the right to vote—at least until polygamy was outlawed. She recognized this was inconsistent with her beliefs about women's rights but concluded, by her own judgement, that Mormon women were too heavily influenced to make voting decisions for themselves.|$|E

500|$|The {{earliest}} {{reference to}} the town is in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, which records that in 733 the King of Wessex, Æthelheard lost control of Somerton to Æthelbald, King of Mercia. Somerton {{was the site of}} the 949 meeting of the witan, a form of Anglo-Saxon parliament. The town returned to West Saxon royal control in the ninth century, and it was listed in the Domesday Book of 1086 as [...] "Sumertone". The name may come from Old English for [...] "sea-lake enclosure", [...] "summer town" [...] or [...] "summer farmstead". The Somerton name was extended <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area it controlled, and this area became known as Somerset, although Somerton soon ceased {{to be the most important}} settlement and never grew into a large town.
