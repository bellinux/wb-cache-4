25|$|A {{majority}} of people do not start smoking at adulthood because of informed decision-making. As a result, much cigarette advertising was intended to target youth and depicted youths smoking and using tobacco {{as a form of}} leisure and enjoyment. Major cigarette companies would advertise their brands in popular TV shows such as The Flintstones and The Beverly Hillbillies, which were watched by many children and teens. In 1964, after facing much pressure from the public, The Cigarette Advertising Code was created by <b>the</b> <b>Tobacco</b> <b>companies,</b> which prohibited advertising directed to youth.|$|E

25|$|In Canada, the {{advertising}} of tobacco products was prohibited by the Tobacco Products Control Act as of 1988 and all tobacco products must show attributed warning signs on all packaging. Immediately following {{the passing of}} the legislation through parliament, RJR-MacDonald (RJR-MacDonald Inc. v. Canada (Attorney General)) filed suit against the Government of Canada through the Quebec Superior Court. It was argued that the act, which originally called for unattributed warnings, was a violation of the right to free speech. In 1991, the Quebec Superior Court ruled in favour of <b>the</b> <b>tobacco</b> <b>companies,</b> deciding that the act violated their right to free speech under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, as well as being ultra vires. The Crown subsequently appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.|$|E
25|$|On 21 September 1995 the Supreme Court of Canada {{upheld the}} Tobacco Products Control Act as legal, forcing <b>the</b> <b>tobacco</b> <b>companies</b> {{operating}} in Canada to print hazard warnings on all cigarette packs. However, the Court {{struck down the}} requirement that the health warnings be unattributed, as this requirement violated the right to free speech, further ruling {{that it was in}} the federal government's jurisdiction to pass such laws, as it fell under the peace, order and good government clause. Recently, sin taxes have been added to tobacco products, with the objective of decreasing usage by making the products less affordable. Currently, radio ads, television commercials, event sponsoring, promotional giveaways and other types of brand advertising are prohibited as well as in-store product displays. However, certain forms of advertising are permitted, such as print advertisements in magazines with an adult readership of 85% minimum.|$|E

2500|$|Ever {{since the}} first {{appearance}} of the Red, Gold and White colors of the Imperial Tobacco's Gold Leaf brand sponsorship livery at the 1968 Monaco Grand Prix, teams, drivers and circuits of Formula One (F1) for years had been heavily dependent on the financial backing of sponsors and from the arrival of Gold Leaf for many decades the tobacco industry {{played a major role}} in sponsoring the sport. In 1976, West Germany began a trend in outlawing tobacco sponsorships in motor races, followed by the United Kingdom in 1984, starting with major races and outlawing the rest of the sponsorships in later years. In 1992 France did the same. As anti-smoking legislation began to tighten in many parts of the world F1 became an even more important opportunity for cigarette brand promotion. The negotiating skills of the F1 leadership (especially Bernie Ecclestone) were such that in many jurisdictions F1 achieved some exemptions from the rules. However, there is now a blanket ban on advertising in Europe, and the cars are not allowed to show any links with <b>the</b> <b>tobacco</b> <b>companies.</b> As a result, tobacco advertising started to exit F1. In , WilliamsF1 became the first major team to run without tobacco sponsorship, and McLaren later replaced the West brand and no longer have any tobacco sponsors. Renault ended the deal with Mild Seven after the [...] season, and in the same year British American Tobacco, owners of British American Racing team withdrew from F1, selling the team to Honda. Ferrari on the other hand renewed their arrangements with Philip Morris in 2005 and later in 2011.|$|E
