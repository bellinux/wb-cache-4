5|$|Producer Frank Marshall {{stated in}} 2003 {{that the film}} would use {{traditional}} stunt work {{so as to be}} consistent with the previous films.

It did not go off and he was not injured.|$|E

60|$|She paused, {{covering}} {{her eyes with}} her hand, and it was well, for her words pierced me so that I shrank upon <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> <b>beside</b> her.|$|E

60|$|This {{reminded}} her to turn another page, {{and she had}} scarcely noted that it contained {{the picture of a}} monkey when the animal sprang from the book with a great crumpling of paper and landed upon <b>the</b> window <b>seat</b> <b>beside</b> her.|$|R

60|$|The old man {{hesitated a}} moment, and then taking <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> <b>beside</b> him, {{accepted}} the proffered pouch and smelt the contents critically. Then {{he drew a}} small black clay {{from his pocket and}} slowly filled it.|$|E

60|$|In the {{meantime}} the big touring car was leaving Crumville rapidly behind.
