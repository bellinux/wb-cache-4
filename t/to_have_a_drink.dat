25|$|Albert Graham took Sharlene {{out of the}} {{building}} and drove her back to the YWCA hostel; as he left her on the doorstep he reassured the little girl that her mother was inside waiting for her. Sharlene was looked after by the hostel staff until she was placed in the care of the Social Services. Back at the UDA club, Cowan removed the bloodstained hood and saw by her appalling head wounds and badly-bruised, disfigured face that Ann Ogilby was obviously dead; the body was then wrapped up in a brown sack and carried downstairs. The killers went <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>drink</b> with Elizabeth Douglas to whom they recounted the details of the fatal beating as she had remained on the ground floor the entire time. Afterwards, Cowan and Smith got dressed up and went out to the disco as planned.|$|E

He had just adjourned the session {{for the day and}} was preparing <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>drink</b> in House Speaker Sam Rayburn's office when he received an urgent message to go immediately to the White House. Truman assumed President Roosevelt wanted to meet with him, but Eleanor Roosevelt informed him her husband had died after suffering a massive cerebral hemorrhage. Truman's first concern was for Mrs. Roosevelt. He asked if there was anything he could do for her, to which she replied, [...] "Is there anything we can do for you? For you are the one in trouble now!" ...|$|E
500|$|Jack asks Tracy <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>drink</b> {{with him}} to {{celebrate}} his impending divorce, but Tracy has to leave early to celebrate Valentine's Day with his wife through [...] "role-play". As Jack gets more and more drunk, he reveals that he still has various fantasies about his wife from grabbing one of her breasts to her getting various terminal diseases with him by her bedside. Eventually, {{he picks up a}} prostitute (Rachel Dratch), and the two interrupt Tracy and Angie's Valentine's Day at the Soho Grand Hotel. Angie, upset that their Valentine's Day is ruined, demands that Tracy get rid of Jack and the prostitute, so he calls Liz for help. Liz gets Jack and the drunk prostitute out of the hotel, and Liz tells Jack that his relationship with his wife is sick and presents him with a scenario of [...] "Marry, Boff, Kill", all with his wife, causing Jack to say that he wants to do all of the three but promises Liz that he will get over his wife, and the two leave the prostitute in the street. The next day, Jack and Bianca sign the divorce papers, and Bianca begs Jack not to sell the Arby's that he had gotten in their settlement. He promises not to do so, but will let the place shut down and become desolate. The two argue, and the sexual tension between the two escalate, until Bianca tears herself away from Jack and leaves.|$|E
500|$|The {{customers}} who arrived on La Caravelle‍s {{last night of}} business were a mixture of regulars who had come for one last meal and bid farwell, {{as well as those}} who had never visited it before and wanted to see a piece of New York history before it was no more. Mr. and Mrs. Walter Cronkite dined with colleague Andy Rooney and his daughter; the Cronkites said they had been patrons of La Caravelle for 43 years. A couple came with their teenage daughter, who was so fussy about food, the La Caravelle chef would cook a packaged macaroni and cheese dinner for her. [...] Another family of three made reservations for four; one for the husband's mother who had been a La Caravelle regular and had died in 2000. People with no reservations managed to gain entrance to the restaurant's bar and were able to be seated at a table. [...] A young couple who had come <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>drink</b> on La Caravelles last night was graciously seated at the table which was formerly reserved for Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, who continued to patronize the restaurant after her marriage to Aristotle Onassis. Upon entering the restaurant's main room, a woman exclaimed that it was her best New York moment and she could now move to the suburbs. Though the restaurant never offered music or entertainment, the Jammets had arranged for Robert White, a tenor and teacher at the Juilliard School to perform [...] "Danny Boy". White was a patron of La Caravelle on the restaurant's first night of business in 1960. It was awarded the James Beard Foundation's Most Outstanding Restaurant in the Country award in the year of its closing. [...] The name is now known for champagnes produced by the Jammets; the restaurant began serving them as its house brand in 1997.|$|E

The next day, he is brought in to Langley for a polygraph test over the apparent suicide of Afsal Hamid (Waleed Zuaiter), a detained terrorist with whom Brody had a violent confrontation. Carrie, suspicious of Brody's replies, orders the interviewer to ask if he's ever been unfaithful to his wife. Brody says [...] "no", beating the polygraph.|$|E

[...] The 4th Light Horse Brigade had been ordered to cross the wadi mounted and attack Khurbet Buteihah, {{in the direction of}} Zuheilika and Huj, with the 5th Mounted Brigade in support. See above 'Detail of El Arish to Beersheba Map showing the Sheria position' and Falls Map 4.

5000|$|Other {{cultures}} have developed different naturalistic disease theories. One specific example lies in Latin cultures, which place [...] "hot" [...] or [...] "cold" [...] classifications {{on things like}} food, drink, and environmental conditions.

Therefore, one is expected not <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> cold <b>drink</b> after taking <b>a</b> hot bath.|$|R
2500|$|Another {{section of}} the law laid that {{whenever}} men left the camp, they had to wear full uniform – {{even if they were}} just going along the road <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>drink</b> and meet English friends in one of the pubs in Birtley. The catch was that, apart from most of the pubs in Birtley being out of bounds in any case (as agreed jointly by the British and Belgian authorities – to prevent over-indulgence or too much ‘hob-knobbing’ with the natives were the ‘reasons’), the Belgian soldier was not supposed to enter a British pub in uniform! On top of that, the British police seem to have been extremely worried about violent confrontations between the locals and the Belgians, ignoring the fact that violent confrontation had long been a normal feature of life in Birtley, especially at weekends. Furthermore, there was not always harmony within the colony or the factory themselves. [...] Worker-management lines also divided along the long-standing antipathy between the Dutch-speaking Flemish workers and the French-speaking Walloon management of the community.|$|E

2500|$|The {{testimony}} from American writer Eugene Bagger is quite unfavorable regarding {{the efficiency of}} the [...] "assembly line" [...] set up by Sousa Mendes. Bagger says that on the 18th he queued [...] for a couple of hours, at the Portuguese Consulate hoping to get a visa. Bagger says that the pushing and the elbowing drove him to despair and he gave up after a few hours. The next morning he joined again a mob of four hundred in front of the Portuguese Consulate. He waited in line from 9 a.m. till 11 o’clock, again to no avail and he finally quit. He then decided <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>drink</b> at Hotel Splendid where he found Sousa Mendes having an aperitif with a friend. Sousa Mendes told Bagger that he was tired from overworking the previous day, from the crowds and from the heat. Then, at Bagger’s request, Sousa Mendes signed Bagger’s passport and told him {{to go back to the}} consulate to have it stamped. To Bagger’s surprise he was then helped by M.

2500|$|This {{game was}} played {{regularly}} between one of the presenters {{and one of the}} Bungalow Heads, in the Bungalow's attic. The game involved a spinning wheel (akin to a roulette wheel) with twelve different chocolates placed on it, each one shaped like the show's logo. Eleven of these chocolates were milk chocolate (therefore [...] "Yum Yum") and the other one was flavoured with strong chili powder (therefore [...] "Yak"). However, the chocolates all looked identical, and therefore neither the presenter nor the Bungalow Head knew which one of the chocolates was flavoured with chili. The presenter and Bungalow Head would take turns spinning the wheel and eating the chocolate which the wheel landed on. If {{this was one of the}} milk chocolates, the person eating it would say [...] "Yum Yum" [...] to denote this and the game would continue. If however, someone consumed the chili chocolate, it would become immediately evident that they had done so as they would often cry out in pain, go red in the face and have <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>drink</b> to cool down. The person who consumed the chili chocolate was deemed the loser.|$|E

McGregor was on the verge of being recalled to the national team by manager Craig Levein, but was omitted from the squad after he was attacked on the way home from a night out in Glasgow city centre.
