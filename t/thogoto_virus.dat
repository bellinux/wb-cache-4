50|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, Nuttall started to study viruses {{transmitted}} by ticks, initially focusing on orbiviruses, nairoviruses and thogotoviruses. While performing experiments designed to explore whether <b>Thogoto</b> <b>virus,</b> an influenza-like virus, {{can be transmitted}} between ticks during mating, Nuttall and her colleagues unexpectedly found that control ticks became infected. They discovered that the virus can be transmitted between infected and uninfected ticks when they feed simultaneously on apparently uninfected guinea pigs, without the virus being present at a detectable level in the blood. With Milan Labuda, Nuttall subsequently demonstrated the same phenomenon with tick-borne encephalitis virus, a better-understood arthropod-transmitted virus.|$|E
40|$|The {{infectious}} salmon anemia virus (ISAV) is an orthomyxovirus-like virus infecting teleosts. The disease {{caused by}} this virus has had major economic {{consequences for the}} Atlantic salmon farming industry in Norway, Canada, and Scotland. In this work, we report the cloning and sequencing of an ISAV-specific cDNA comprising 2, 245 bp with an open reading frame coding for a predicted protein with a calculated molecular weight of 80. 5 kDa. The putative protein sequence shows the core polymerase motifs characteristic of all viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases. Comparison of the conserved motifs with the corresponding regions of other segmented negative-stranded RNA viruses shows a closer relationship {{with members of the}} Orthomyxoviridae than with viruses in other families. The putative ISAV polymerase protein (PB 1) has a length of 708 amino acids, a charge of + 22 at neutral pH, and a pI of 9. 9, which are consistent with the properties of the PB 1 proteins of other members of the family. Calculations of the distances between the different PB 1 proteins indicate that the ISAV is distantly related to {{the other members of the}} family but more closely related to the influenza viruses than to the <b>Thogoto</b> <b>viruses.</b> Based on these and previously published results, we propose that the ISAV comprises a new, fifth genus in the Orthomyxoviridae...|$|R
40|$|Reverse {{genetics}} {{has been}} documented for influenza A, B, and <b>Thogoto</b> <b>viruses</b> belonging to the family Orthomyxoviridae. We report here the reverse genetics of influenza C virus, another member of this family. The seven viral RNA (vRNA) segments of C/Ann Arbor/ 1 / 50 were expressed in 293 T cells from cloned cDNAs, together with nine influenza C virus proteins. At 48 h posttransfection, the infectious titer of the culture supernatant {{was determined to be}} 2. 51 × 103 50 % egg infectious doses/ml, which is lower than the number of influenza C virus-like particles (VLPs) (106 /ml) generated using the same system. By generating influenza C VLPs containing a given vRNA segment, we showed that each of the vRNA segments was similarly synthesized in the plasmid-transfected cells but that some segments were less efficiently incorporated into the VLPs. This finding leads us to speculate that the differences in incorporation efficiency into VLPs between segments might be a reason for the inefficient production of infectious viruses. Second, we generated a mutant recombinant virus, rMG 96 A, which possesses an Ala→Thr mutation at residue 24 of the M 1 protein, a substitution demonstrated {{to be involved in the}} morphology (filamentous or spherical) of the influenza C VLPs. As expected, rMG 96 A exhibited a spherical morphology, whereas recombinant wild-type of C/Ann Arbor/ 1 / 50, rWT, exhibited a mainly filamentous morphology. Membrane flotation analysis of the cells infected with rWT or rMG 96 A revealed a difference in the ratio of membrane-associated M 1 proteins, suggesting that the affinity of M 1 protein to the cell membrane is a determinant for virion morphology...|$|R

40|$|Thogoto and Dhori viruses are tick-borne orthomyxoviruses infecting {{humans and}} {{livestock}} in Africa, Asia, and Europe. Here, {{we show that}} human MxA protein is an efficient inhibitor of <b>Thogoto</b> <b>virus</b> but is inactive against Dhori virus. When expressed in the cytoplasm of stably transfected cell lines, MxA protein interfered with the accumulation of Thogoto viral RNA and proteins. Likewise, MxA(R 645), a mutant MxA protein known to be active against influenza virus but inactive against vesicular stomatitis virus, was equally efficient in blocking <b>Thogoto</b> <b>virus</b> growth. Hence, a common antiviral mechanism that is distinct from the antiviral action against vesicular stomatitis virus may operate against both influenza virus and <b>Thogoto</b> <b>virus.</b> When moved to the nucleus {{with the help of}} a foreign nuclear transport signal, MxA(R 645) remained active against <b>Thogoto</b> <b>virus,</b> indicating that a nuclear step of virus replication was inhibited.

40|$|Recent {{outbreaks}} of highly pathogenic avian influenza in Asia and associated human infections {{have led to}} a heightened level of awareness and preparation for a possible influenza pandemic. Vaccination is the best option by which spread of a pandemic virus could be prevented and severity of disease reduced. Production of live attenuated and inactivated vaccine seed viruses against avian influenza viruses, which have the potential to cause pandemics, and their testing in preclinical studies and clinical trials will establish the principles and ensure manufacturing experience that will be critical in the event of the emergence of such a virus into the human population. Studies of such vaccines will also add {{to our understanding of the}} biology of avian influenza viruses and their behavior in mammalian hosts. Influenza is a negative-strand RNA virus that belongs to the family Orthomyxoviridae, which consists of 4 genera: influenza A, influenza B, influenza C, and <b>Thogoto</b> <b>viruses.</b> The proteins of influenza A are encoded on 8 RNA gene segments. Influenza A viruses are widely distributed in nature and can infect a wide variety of birds and mammals. Influenza A virus subtypes are classified on the basis of the antigenicity of their surface glycoproteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA); 16 HA and 9 NA subtypes are known to exist, and all of them infect aquatic birds. Most infections in waterfowl are not associated with clinical disease. Relatively few subtypes of influenza A viruses have caused sustained {{outbreaks of}} disease in the human population. Influenza A viruses of the H 1, H 2, and H 3 HA and of the N 1 and N 2 NA subtypes have circulated in the human population in the 20 th century. H 1 N 1 viruses appeared in 1918 and circulated until 1957, when they were replaced by H 2 N 2 viruses. H 3 N 2 viruses appeared in 1968, replacing H 2 N 2 viruses, and have remained in circulation in the human population. H 1 N 1 viruses reappeared in the human population in 1977 and continue to cocirculate with H 3 N 2 viruses (1) ...|$|R
40|$|Genetic reassortment of <b>Thogoto</b> (THO) <b>virus</b> {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} in dually infected Rhipicephalus appendiculatus tick. However previous results howed that oral superinfection is inhibited by interference. To ascertain the site of THO viral interference, ticks were infected parenterally ororally with a temperature-sensitive (is) mutant of THO virus. Infected ticks were then challenged with wild-type (wt) THO virus via parenteral inoculation. Intra-stadial superinfection {{was carried out by}} parenteral inoculation of newly infected engorged ticks whereas inter-stadial superinfection involved inoculation of engorged ticks infected at the previous tage. In both instances viral interference was not observed, i. e. the challenge virus replicated and was delivered by bite to susceptible hosts. Therefore when the gut is bypassed, R. appendiculatus ticks are apparently permissive to dual infection even when there is a delay in the presentation of the superinfecting virus. These results demonstrate that interference following superinfection per os does not occur in the salivary glands, but may occur in the gut and possibly in a secondary site of viral replication such as the synganglion...|$|R
40|$|Tick-borne virus {{transmission}} {{was examined}} using guinea-pigs and hamsters previously infested with ticks. Guinea-pigs developed immunity to Rhipicepha-lus appendiculatus after a single {{exposure to the}} ticks. Nymphal and adult stages that fed on resistant guinea-pigs had increased mortality during feeding, and reduced engorged weights. Egg production from fe-male ticks fed on resistant hosts fell by at least 50 %. Guinea-pigs maintained high levels of immunity to tick infestation for at least 210 days after the initial exposure. In contrast, hamsters did not develop resistance to ticks even after three or four infestations. R. appendiculatus adults infected with <b>Thogoto</b> (THO) <b>virus</b> (donors) were allowed to co-feed with uninfected nymphs (recipients) on either resistant or naive guinea-pigs. The number of recipient icks that acquired virus was significantly reduced on resistant guinea-pigs. In contrast, feeding on pre-infested hamsters did not affect tick-borne transmission of THO virus. Host resistance to tick infestation, if prevalent in nature, may severely limit the spread of tick-borne viruses. Such an effect could result directly from {{a reduction in the}} number of ticks that acquire virus, or indirectly from poor egg production (in the case of viruses maintained in ticks by vertical transmission) and reduced survival of ticks fed on resistant hosts...|$|R

Peritoneal macrophages and interferon-treated embryo cells from resistant mice exhibited the same resistance phenotype in vitro. Moreover, stable lines of transfected mouse 3 T 3 cells that constitutively express Mx 1 protein showed increased resistance to <b>Thogoto</b> <b>virus</b> infection.

40|$|MxA is a large, interferon-induced GTPase with {{antiviral}} activity against RNA viruses. It forms large oligomers, {{but whether}} oligomerization and GTPase activity {{are important for}} antiviral function is not known. The mutant protein MxA(L 612 K) carries a lysine-for-leucine substitution at position 612 and fails to form oligomers. Here we show that monomeric MxA(L 612 K) lacks detectable GTPase activity but is capable of inhibiting <b>Thogoto</b> <b>virus</b> in transiently transfected Vero cells or in a <b>Thogoto</b> <b>virus</b> minireplicon system. Likewise, MxA(L 612 K) inhibited vesicular stomatitis virus multiplication. These findings indicate that MxA monomers are antivirally active and suggest that GTP hydrolysis may not be required for antiviral activity.

40|$|MxA is a GTPase that accumulates to {{high levels}} in the {{cytoplasm}} of interferon-treated human cells.

We have now generated transgenic mice that express MxA cDNA in the brain and other organs under the control of a constitutive promoter. Embryonic fibroblasts derived from the transgenic mice were nonpermissive for <b>Thogoto</b> <b>virus</b> and showed reduced susceptibility for influenza A and vesicular stomatitis viruses. The transgenic animals survived challenges with high doses of <b>Thogoto</b> <b>virus</b> by the intracerebral or intraperitoneal route.

40|$|The {{coding region}} of segment 4 of <b>Thogoto</b> (THO) <b>virus,</b> a tickborne {{member of the}} Orthomyxoviridae, was {{expressed}} in a baculovirus system {{under the control of}} the polyhedrin promoter. This construct expressed authentic envelope glycoprotein as determined by size and antigenic reactivity with a panel of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs). Immunization of hamsters with Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf 21) cells infected with the recombinant baculovirus induced neutralizing and protective antibodies against virus challenge; control hamsters developed clinical disease with high-titer viremia 3 days postchallenge. In contrast to hamsters, guinea pigs are comparatively resistant to THO virus infection but support nonviremic transmission between cofeeding infected and uninfected ticks. However, when uninfected ticks fed on guinea pigs immunized with the baculovirus recombinant, only 2 % became infected following virus challenge of the animals compared to 26 % of ticks on control nonimmune guinea pigs. Furthermore, neutralizing MAbs specific for THO viral glycoprotein protected mice against lethal challenge with THO virus; nonneutralizing MAbs specific for the glycoprotein, which inhibit THO viral agglutinating activity, did not induce a protective response. Thus at least in the murine model, protective immunity is conferred by antibodies directed against the neutralizing epitope(s) of the baculovirus-related glycoprotein of THO virus.

40|$|Engorged nymphs (Rhipicephalus appendiculatus) were inoculated parenterally with <b>Thogoto</b> (THO) <b>virus</b> (approximately 1 microl per nymph; 10 (6) - 10 (7) PFU/ml). The adult females which {{resulted}} {{were used as}} the source of infected ticks for this study. Hemolymph, salivary glands, synganglion, gut, ovary, and Malpighian tubules were collected on each day of the blood meal and titrated for THO virus by plaque assay. The percent of tissues infected with virus was 16 % or less on the day of attachment. Percent infection rose for all tissues throughout 6 - 7 days of feeding, reaching 40 - 100 % infection during the rapid phase of engorgement. For the first 4 days of feeding, virus titer in the synganglion was higher than in salivary glands (means of 6. 4 - 34. 7 PFU/synganglion and 1. 6 - 8. 8 PFU/salivary gland pair). From days 5 - 7, virus titer was generally higher in the salivary gland than the synganglion (means of 422, 408, and 817 PFU/gland pair and means of 62, 811, and 9 PFU/synganglion). However, because a salivary gland pair is much heavier than a synganglion, the virus concentration in the synganglion was much higher than in the salivary gland during the slow phase of feeding. During the rapid phase of feeding, the difference in virus titer between the synganglion and salivary gland reduced. This difference between the early and late stages of feeding may explain why a previous study [J. Gen. Virol. 70 (1989) 1093], using immunofluorescence and immuno-gold labelling, failed to detect virus in the salivary gland early in feeding. These data provide evidence to explain that R. appendiculatus can transmit THO virus within 24 h of attachment, an important epidemiological finding...|$|R
40|$|In {{the course}} of {{investigating}} suspected cases of viral haemorrhagic fever in South Africa patients were encountered who had been bitten by ticks, but who lacked evidence of infection with Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) virus or non-viral tick-borne agents. Cattle sera were tested by enzyme-linked immunoassay to determine whether tick-borne viruses other than CCHF occur in the country. The prevalence of antibody in cattle sera was 905 / 2116 (42. 8 %) for CCHF virus, 70 / 1358 (5. 2 %) for Dugbe, 21 / 1358 (1. 5 %) for louping ill, 6 / 450 (1. 3 %) for West Nile, 7 / 1358 (0. 5 %) for Nairobi sheep disease, 3 / 625 (0. 5 %) for Kadam and 2 / 450 (0. 4 %) for Chenuda. No reactions were recorded with Hazara, Bahig, Bhanja, <b>Thogoto</b> and Dhori <b>viruses.</b> The CCHF findings confirmed previous observations that the virus is widely prevalent within the distribution range of ticks of the genus Hyalomma, while antibody activity to Dugbe antigen was detected only within the distribution range of the tick Amblyomma hebraeum. Cross-reactivity for the nairoviruses, Hazara, Nairobi sheep disease and Dugbe, was detected in serum samples from 3 / 72 human patients with confirmed CCHF infection, and serum from 1 / 162 other patients reacted monospecifically with Dugbe antigen.

To synthesize the six structural proteins of THOV in mammalian cells, we used T 7 -controlled expression plasmids and a recombinant vaccinia virus producing T 7 RNA polymerase. A minireplicon encoding a reporter gene flanked by THOV promoter sequences was expressed by the cellular RNA polymerase I. The recombinant pro-teinswere functional in encapsidation, amplification and transcription of the minireplicon RNA. Fur-thermore, the artificial nucleocapsids were packaged into THO-VLPs that transferred the minireplicon to indicator cells. This system should be helpful in generating recombinant THOV entirely from cloned cDNAs. <b>Thogoto</b> <b>virus</b> (THOV) {{is the type}} species of a newly established genus of tick-transmitted viruses in the family Orthomyxoviridae (Pringle, 1996).

Here we show that Batken virus is inhibited by the interferon-induced Mx 1 protein of mice which selectively blocks the growth of orthomyxoviruses, including <b>Thogoto</b> and Dhori <b>viruses.</b> Furthermore, we show that Batken virus multiplication is characterized by accumulation of viral proteins in the nucleus and by budding of viral particles from the cell surface. Serological crossreactions between Batken and Dhori viruses revealed a phylogenetic relationship of these viruses, as previously also proposed by D. K. Lvov. Fragments of the Batken virus glycoprotein and nucleoprotein genes were amplified by RT–PCR. The deduced amino acid sequences were similar to the corresponding Dhori virus sequences. Therefore, Batken virus should be classified into the newly established genus Thogotovirus of the family Orthomyxoviridae. Finally, our results demonstrate that Mx 1 susceptibility of orthomyxoviruses is a reliable marker in the hunt for new family members. The first isolates of Batken virus (BKNV) including the prototype strain LEIV 306 K were obtained by Lvov et al.

40|$|Haematophagous insect vectors of arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) feed repeatedly. Consequently, {{they can}} {{transmit}} arboviruses {{to more than}} one host during the same developmental stage (intra-stadial transmission). By contrast, ixodid ticks generally feed only once at each parasitic stage (larva, nymph, and adult) and hence they have only one opportunity for tick-borne virus transmission per stadium (inter-stadial transmission). Under natural conditions, tick-infested hosts may die (from disease or other causes) before the ticks have completed their long period of engorgement. A laboratory model was used to investigate the consequences of premature host death on tick-borne virus transmission. We report intra-stadial transmission of <b>Thogoto</b> <b>virus</b> by the nymphal, male, and female ticks of Rhipicephalus appendiculatus. Tick-borne <b>Thogoto</b> <b>virus</b> infection caused viraemia and death of hamsters before the nymphal and adult ticks feeding on them had completed engorgement.

During feeding on the subsequent hosts, they transmitted the virus intra-stadially to susceptible hosts (hamsters), and to uninfected co-feeding ticks on non-susceptible hosts (guinea-pigs). Intra-stadial transmission, mediated by interrupted feeding, may help explain outbreaks of rapid and fatal tick-borne viral diseases, and the epidemiology as well as evolution of virulence, in a susceptible host population.

We have generated MxA-transgenic mice that lack a functional IFN system by crossing MxA-transgenic mice constitutively expressing MxA with genetically targeted (knockout) mice lacking the beta subunit of the IFN-alpha/beta receptor (IFNAR- 1 (-/-) mice). These mice are an ideal animal model to investigate the unique antiviral activity of human MxA in vivo, because they are unable to express other IFN-induced proteins. Here, we show that MxA confers resistance to <b>Thogoto</b> <b>virus,</b> La Crosse virus, and Semliki Forest virus. No <b>Thogoto</b> <b>virus</b> progeny was detectable in MxA-transgenic mice, indicating an efficient block of virus replication at the primary site of infection. In the case of La Crosse virus, MxA restricted invasion of the central nervous system. In contrast, Semliki Forest virus multiplication in the brain was detectable in both MxA-expressing and nonexpressing IFNAR- 1 (-/-) mice. However, viral titers were clearly reduced in MxA-transgenic mice. Our results demonstrate that MxA does not need the help of other IFN-induced proteins for activity but is a powerful antiviral agent on its own.

Viral dose and time of co-infection of the host affected the incidence of reassortment. This is the first report of reassortment of an arbovirus following infection of a vertebrate host via an arthropod vector...|$|E
40|$|<b>Thogoto</b> <b>virus</b> (THOV) is a tick-transmitted orthomyxovirus with a genome of six negative-stranded RNA segments. The sixth segment encodes two {{different}} transcripts: a spliced transcript that is translated into the matrix protein (M) and an unspliced transcript. Here, {{we report that}} the unspliced transcript encodes an elongated form of M named ML. A THOV isolate deficient in ML expression was an efficient interferon inducer, whereas ML-expressing wild-type strains were poor interferon inducers. These results were confirmed with recombinant THOVs rescued from cDNAs. Expression of ML efficiently suppressed activation of the beta interferon promoter by double-stranded RNA. These results indicate that ML is an accessory protein that functions as a potent interferon antagonist by blocking transcriptional activation of alpha/beta interferons...|$|E
40|$|Ticks {{transmit}} viruses {{responsible for}} severe emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases, {{some of which}} {{have a significant impact on}} public health. In Japan, little is known about the distribution of tick-borne viruses. In this study, we collected and tested ticks to investigate the distribution of tick-borne arboviruses in Kyoto, Japan, and isolated the first <b>Thogoto</b> <b>virus</b> (THOV) to our knowledge from Haemaphysalis longicomis in far-eastern Asia. The Japanese isolate was genetically distinct from a cluster of other isolates from Africa, Europe and the Middle East. Various cell lines derived from mammals and ticks were susceptible to the isolate, but it was not pathogenic in mice. These results advance understanding of the distribution and ecology of THOV...|$|E
40|$|SummaryMxA is an interferon-induced dynamin-like GTPase with wide-ranging {{antiviral}} activity, which hinges upon {{detection of}} unique viral structures that differ across virus families. Despite elucidation of its structure, {{the basis of}} MxA antiviral specificity remains enigmatic. We used an evolution-guided approach to identify the loop L 4 of MxA as a hotspot for recurrent positive selection in primates. Further, we show that single amino acid changes in L 4 are necessary and sufficient to explain dramatic differences in species-specific antiviral activity of primate MxA proteins against the orthomyxoviruses <b>Thogoto</b> <b>virus</b> and influenza A virus. Taken together, our findings identify a genetic determinant of MxA target recognition and suggest a model by which MxA achieves antiviral breadth without compromising viral specificity...|$|E
40|$|Influenza A viruses {{belong to}} the family of the orthomyxoviridae that {{consists}} of five genera: <b>Thogoto</b> <b>virus,</b> Isavirus and Influenza virus A, B and C. The generae of influenza viruses are distinguished based on their membrane channel protein, genome size and surface glycoprotein(s). [1] Influenza A viruses are classified based on their surface glycoproteins: hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). So far 16 HA subtypes and 9 NA subtypes have been identified based on genetic and antigenic analysis. [2] The nomenclature of influenza viruses is based on: subtype, host of origin (except humans), isolation site (geographical), strain number, year of isolation and followed by the description of the antigenic subtype, e. g. A/Chicken/ Netherlands/ 1 / 03 (H 7 N 7) ...|$|E
40|$|<b>Thogoto</b> <b>virus</b> (THOV) is a tick-transmitted orthomyxovirus with a genome {{consisting}} of six negative-stranded RNA segments. To rescue a recombinant THOV, the viral structural proteins were produced from expression plasmids {{by means of}} a vaccinia virus expressing the T 7 RNA polymerase. Genomic virus RNAs (vRNAs) were generated from plasmids {{under the control of the}} RNA polymerase I promoter. Using this system, we could efficiently recover recombinant THOV following transfection of 12 plasmids into 293 T cells. To verify the recombinant nature of the rescued virus, specific genetic tags were introduced into two vRNA segments. The availability of this efficient reverse genetics system will allow us to address hitherto-unanswered questions regarding the biology of THOV by manipulating viral genes in the context of infectious virus...|$|E
40|$|The ML protein of <b>Thogoto</b> <b>virus,</b> a tick-transmitted orthomyxovirus, is a splice {{variant of}} the viral matrix protein and antagonizes the {{induction}} of antiviral type I interferon (IFN). Here we identified the general RNA polymerase II transcription factor IIB (TFIIB) as an ML-interacting protein. Overexpression of TFIIB neutralized the inhibitory effect of ML on IRF 3 -mediated promoter activation. Moreover, a recombinant virus expressing a mutant ML protein unable to bind TFIIB was severely impaired {{in its ability to}} suppress IFN induction. We concluded that TFIIB binding is required for the IFN antagonist effect exerted by ML. We further demonstrate that the ML-TFIIB interaction has surprisingly little impact on gene expression in general, while a strong negative effect is observed for IRF 3 - and NF-κB-regulated promoters...|$|E
40|$|Chicken Mx {{belongs to}} the Mx family of interferon-induced dynamin-like GTPases, which in some species possess potent {{antiviral}} properties. Conflicting data exist for the antiviral capability of chicken Mx. Reports of anti-influenza activity of alleles encoding an Asn 631 polymorphism have not been supported by subsequent studies. The normal cytoplasmic localisation of chicken Mx may influence its antiviral capacity. Here we report further studies to determine the antiviral potential of chicken Mx against Newcastle disease virus (NDV), an economically important cytoplasmic RNA virus of chickens, and <b>Thogoto</b> <b>virus,</b> an orthomyxovirus known to be exquisitely sensitive to the cytoplasmic MxA protein from humans. We also report the consequences of re-locating chicken Mx to the nucleus. Chicken Mx was tested in virus infection assays using NDV. Neither the Asn 631 nor Ser 631 Mx alleles (when transfected into 293 T cells) showed inhibition of virus-directed gene expression when the cells were subsequently infected with NDV. Human MxA however did show significant inhibition of NDV-directed gene expression. Chicken Mx failed to inhibit a <b>Thogoto</b> <b>virus</b> (THOV) minireplicon {{system in which the}} cytoplasmic human MxA protein showed potent and specific inhibition. Relocalisation of chicken Mx to the nucleus was achieved by inserting the Simian Virus 40 large T antigen nuclear localisation sequence (SV 40 NLS) at the N-terminus of chicken Mx. Nuclear re-localised chicken Mx did not inhibit influenza (A/PR/ 8 / 34) gene expression during virus infection in cell culture or influenza polymerase activity in A/PR/ 8 / 34 or A/Turkey/ 50 - 92 / 91 minireplicon systems. The chicken Mx protein (Asn 631) lacks inhibitory effects against THOV and NDV, and is unable to suppress influenza replication when artificially re-localised to the cell nucleus. Thus, the natural cytoplasmic localisation of the chicken Mx protein does not account for its lack of antiviral activity...|$|E
