25|$|A <b>third</b> <b>mate</b> (3/M) {{or third}} officer is a {{licensed}} {{member of the}} deck department of a merchant ship.

25|$|Mates {{direct a}} ship's routine {{operation}} for the captain during work shifts, which are called watches. Mates stand watch for specified periods, usually in three duty sections, with 4 hours on watch and 8 hours off. When on a navigational watch, mates direct a bridge team by conning, directing courses through the helmsman and speed through the lee helmsman (or directly in open ocean). When {{more than one}} mate is necessary aboard a ship, they typically are designated chief mate or first mate, second mate and <b>third</b> <b>mate.</b> In addition to watch standers, mates directly supervise the ship's crew, and are assigned other tasks. The chief mate is usually in charge of cargo, stability and the deck crew, the second mate in charge of navigation plans and updates and the <b>third</b> <b>mate</b> as the safety officer. They also monitor and direct deck crew operations, such as directing line handlers during moorings, and anchorings, monitor cargo operations and supervise crew members engaged in maintenance and the vessel's upkeep.|$|E

60|$|All was in {{readiness}} on Monday morning. The {{second and}} <b>third</b> <b>mates</b> {{came on board}} early; the crew were not to join until the evening before sailing, {{as the work of}} loading was done by stevedores. The second and <b>third</b> <b>mates</b> were both young men. They had spoken to Jack on board the bawley, and had shaken hands with him when they left Leigh with warm expressions of gratitude, and they both greeted him most cordially as soon as they met him {{on the deck of the}} Wild Wave. Jack therefore commenced his career as a sailor under altogether exceptionally pleasant conditions. The captain and two of the mates were under very deep obligations to him, and Mr. Timmins had already conceived a very favourable opinion of him from his willingness to turn his hand to anything, and from his quickness and handiness.|$|R

25|$|Early whaling captains {{and their}} crews were well-paid if the boats netted their prey. In 1907, for instance, George Leavitt and his vessel Narwhal, steam whaler, took some 15 bowhead whales.

Other sailors aboard received smaller percentages of the haul, {{down to the}} so-called 'green hands', who received one 200th.

25|$|On 19 April, {{the captain}} of the ferry was arrested on {{suspicion}} of negligence of duty, violation of maritime law and other infringements. The captain had abandoned the ship with passengers still aboard the ferry, while South Korean law explicitly requires captains to remain on the ship during a disaster. Two other crew members, a helmsman and the <b>third</b> <b>mate,</b> were also arrested on that day on suspicion of negligence and manslaughter. By 26 April, twelve further arrests had been made with the whole crew responsible for navigation in detention.|$|E
25|$|On 16 April at 7:30a.m. (KST), <b>third</b> <b>mate</b> Park Han-kyul and {{helmsman}} Cho Joon-ki {{took over}} the watch from the previous team. At this point in time, Sewol was heading at a course of about 165 degrees {{at the speed of}} about 20 knots, and was operating two radar devices. Around 8:20a.m. when the ship was about 2-3 miles from entering the Maenggol Channel, Park ordered Cho to change the steering system from autopilot to manual steering. When Sewol arrived at the channel on 8:27a.m. at a course of around 137 degrees, the wind speed was between 4 and 7 meters per second, the wave height about 0.5 meters, and the visibility good.|$|E
25|$|Many years later, {{scientific}} study {{of the actions of}} the two crews indicated a probability that the <b>third</b> <b>mate</b> on the Stockholm misinterpreted his radar in the minutes prior to the impact. Recent studies and computer simulations carried out by Captain Robert J. Meurn of the United States Merchant Marine Academy and based on the findings of John C. Carrothers suggest Stockholm Third Officer Carstens-Johannsen misinterpreted radar data and badly overestimated the distance between the two ships. The poor design of the radar settings, coupled with unlighted range settings and a darkened bridge, makes this scenario possible. Some critics have suggested that a simple and available technology, a small light bulb on the radar set aboard Stockholm, might have averted the entire disaster. Instead, he may have unintentionally steered the Swedish ship into a collision with the Italian liner.|$|E

25|$|The {{next day}} Creole {{attacked}} Esther. Creole, of Barracoa, was armed with {{six or seven}} guns of various calibers and had a crew of 111 men {{under the command of}} Captain Pierre Burgman. The two vessels exchanged fire for about an hour and then the privateers, taking advantage of the lack of wind, used their sweeps to come alongside. The fight continued for another 45 minutes, before the privateers could board. The fight then continued for another 20 minutes. Esthers officers and crew resisted until Irving was wounded and retired to his cabin, telling his <b>third</b> <b>mate</b> to strike. The privateers killed Irving in his cabin and proceeded to massacre a number of the other crewmen. A pilot boat from Charleston came out and took off the survivors. Two died on the boat, Mr. Ashton,the first mate, died on the wharf, and two more men died in the hospital. Two seamen at the hospital and 13 others were so terribly cut up that most were not expected to survive. Three of Esthers crew, a Venetian and two Portuguese, joined the privateer, though they had fought well during the action. Creole lost six killed, seven wounded, and had several men missing, believed to have been knocked overboard and drowned.|$|E

60|$|He {{spoke to}} the men again, and again the throat {{rumbling}} and cursing arose, their faces convulsed and animal-like with rage.

Captain Davenport glanced questioningly at his first mate, and that person merely shrugged his shoulders in token of his helplessness.|$|R
