50|$|<b>Tuaminoheptane</b> (or tuamine) is a nasal {{decongestant}} drug {{which is a}} sympathomimetic stimulant and vasoconstrictor. However, it can cause skin irritation, which limits its usefulness as a {{nasal decongestant}}. Oral preparations were once available, but are no longer produced. Side effects {{associated with the use}} of <b>tuaminoheptane</b> can include shortness of breath, tachycardia and hypertension.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tuaminoheptane</b> {{is on the}} 2011 list of {{prohibited}} substances published by the World Anti-Doping Agency.|$|E

50|$|He tested {{positive}} for the stimulant 4-Methyl-2-hexanamine in June 2009. A disciplinary panel organised by the Jamaican Anti-Doping Commission (JADCO) cleared him of a doping infraction {{on the grounds that the}} drug was not on the World Anti-Doping Agency's banned list. However, JADCO appealed their own panel's ruling, stating that the athlete should be disciplined as the drug was similar in structure to the banned substance <b>tuaminoheptane.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In June 2009, five Jamaican {{athletes were}} found {{positive}} for banned substances. At {{least two of}} the athletes belong to the Racers Track Club and were coached by Mills. [...] The athletes were later revealed to be Yohan Blake, Marvin Anderson, Allodin Fothergill, Lansford Spence and Sheri-Ann Brooks, who all tested positive for the stimulant Methylhexanamine, a compound similar to <b>Tuaminoheptane,</b> and were subsequently banned for three months by the Jamaica Anti-Doping Commission.|$|E
50|$|On May 26, 2012 during urine testing, the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) found <b>tuaminoheptane,</b> a banned {{substance}} {{that she was}} using prior to the UCI Para-cycling Road World Cup event which started a day before the test. She accepted a 3-month ban from the United States Anti-Doping Agency for an unintentional anti-doping rule violation and was stripped from her awards and prizes due to the violation. She apologized, and was reinstated for competition on August 26, the day before she traveled to the 2012 London Paralympic Games.|$|E
50|$|In April 1944, Eli Lilly and Company {{introduced}} methylhexanamine {{under the}} brand name Forthane as an inhaled nasal decongestant; Lilly voluntarily withdrew methylhexanamine from the market in 1983. The compound is an aliphatic amine; the pharmaceutical industry had {{a strong interest in}} compounds in this class as nasal decongestants in the early 20th century, which led to methylhexanamine and four other similar compounds being brought to market for that use: <b>tuaminoheptane,</b> octin, oenethyl, and propylhexedrine; octin and oenethyl were eventually approved for use in keeping blood pressure sufficiently high for patients under anesthesia.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the summer}} 2012, he joined Sassuolo, scoring 5 {{goals in the}} first 4 league {{appearances}} for the Serie B side. However, during the season, he suffered a suspension of 40 days for doping, resulting in positive tests of <b>tuaminoheptane</b> after 26 December 2012 game against Livorno, Sassuolo lodged an appeal against the ban due to the assumption of Rinoflumicil, found in a nasal decongestant. Pavoletti returned to help Sassuolo earn promotion to Serie A {{for the first time}} in the history, after playing 33 matches and scoring 11 goals ...|$|E
50|$|Prior to the 2009 World Championships, Blake (along with Marvin Anderson and Sheri-Ann Brooks) tested {{positive}} for the stimulant 4-methyl-2-hexanamine. A disciplinary panel organised by the Jamaica Anti-Doping Commission (JADCO) cleared him of a doping infraction {{on the grounds that the}} drug was not on the World Anti-Doping Agency's banned list. However, JADCO appealed their own panel's ruling, stating that the athlete should be disciplined as the drug was similar in structure to the banned substance <b>tuaminoheptane.</b> As the panel would resolve the issue after the World Championships, the Jamaica Amateur Athletic Association took the precaution of withdrawing Blake from the relay race. The appeals tribunal decided that a ban would be appropriate, and Blake and the three other sprinters each received a three-month ban from competition.|$|E
40|$|A {{completely}} automated {{fluorometric determination}} of amphetamine in urine is described and evaluated. The dihydrolutidine derivative produced by reaction of amphetamine with formaldehyde and acetylace-tone is excited at 410 nm {{and the resulting}} intensity of fluorescence measured at 476 nm. The working limit of detection of amphetamine in fresh urine (1. 5 -mi samples) is 0. 15 mg/liter. A result is pro-duced for the first sample in about 20 mm; subse-quent results are obtained at 2 -mm intervals. Falsely positive reactions are given by 2 -phenylethylamine and <b>tuaminoheptane.</b> Additional Keyphrases: dihydrolutidine derivative #{ 149 } AutoAnalyzer Various methods are available for determining am...|$|E
40|$|The {{norepinephrine}} transporter (NET) transports norepinephrine {{from the}} synapse into presynaptic neurons, where norepinephrine regulates signaling pathways associated with cardiovascular effects and behavioral traits via binding to various receptors (e. g., β 2 -adrenergic receptor). NET is a known target {{for a variety}} of prescription drugs, including antidepressants and psychostimulants, and may mediate off-target effects of other prescription drugs. Here, we identify prescription drugs that bind NET, using virtual ligand screening followed by experimental validation of predicted ligands. We began by constructing a comparative structural model of NET based on its alignment to the atomic structure of a prokaryotic NET homolog, the leucine transporter LeuT. The modeled binding site was validated by confirming that known NET ligands can be docked favorably compared to nonbinding molecules. We then computationally screened 6, 436 drugs from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG DRUG) against the NET model. Ten of the 18 high-scoring drugs tested experimentally were found to be NET inhibitors; five of these were chemically novel ligands of NET. These results may rationalize the efficacy of several sympathetic (<b>tuaminoheptane)</b> and antidepressant (tranylcypromine) drugs, as well as side effects of diabetes (phenformin) and Alzheimer’s (talsaclidine) drugs. The observations highlight the utility of virtual screening against a comparative model, even when the target shares less than 30 % sequence identity with its template structure and no known ligands in the primary binding site...|$|E
40|$|The World Anti-Doping Agency prohibits and {{monitors}} {{the use of}} stimulants in sport. The effects of stimulants on enhancing performance in sport is uncertain. Stimulants have central and peripheral effects that can enhance mental or physical function. They are used therapeutically to treat a range of conditions most notable ADHD, depression and nasal decongestion. The present study looked at the peripheral sympathomimetic effects of stimulants on the cardiovascular system. The agents that were chosen {{for this study were}} reported to have modes of action either to release monoamines or to block noradrenaline reuptake transporters. Experiments were carried out in vitro in isolated tissues, and in vivo in the anaesthetised rat. The main aim {{of this study was to}} determine whether monitored substances on the WADA list are relatively free of abuse potential in sports, or are at least clearly less active than prohibited stimulants, whether non-specified or specified. The agonist stimulants that were most potent in the in vitro and in vivo preparations were; adrenaline, noradrenaline, phenylephrine, octopamine, synephrine, norephedrine and <b>tuaminoheptane.</b> The majority of agonist stimulants potently produced a tachycardia by β-adrenoceptor action. Bupropion, but not modafinil oradrafinil, was a potent noradrenaline uptake blocker similar to cocaine and desipramine. The majority of agonists that were most potent at the α- 1 D-adrenoceptor subtype also produced large pressor responses, and therefore this subtype may be the predominant α 1 -adrenoceptor subtype mediating pressor responses in the anaesthetised rat. Desipramine a potent noradrenaline reuptake blocker may also act as an α 1 -adrenoceptor antagonist. Pressor responses to cathine may be mediated by α 2 -adrenoceptors. Some of these agents, including bupropion, are likely to have peripheral cardiovascular actions at doses used in man. Their effects to enhance performance in sport warrants further investigation...|$|E
