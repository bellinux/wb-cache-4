5|$|Jonathan Del Arco had {{no concept}} of what a Borg was prior to <b>the</b> <b>audition.</b> He {{received}} his script on the evening prior to meeting with the producers and felt that {{it gave him a}} decent sense of the character. Instead, Del Arco later explained that he was deliberately anti-social towards the other actors at <b>the</b> <b>audition</b> in order to get into Hugh's mindset. When he performed for the producers, someone else read the lines assigned to Picard and La Forge, and he felt like he immediately got a positive result. He received a call back, and returned to audition once more.|$|E

5|$|When {{taking an}} audition, a judge evaluates the idol over a 30-second period. The judge's {{interest}} level continuously decreases in 10% increments, but {{this can be}} increased with another minigame. The heart points obtained up to <b>the</b> <b>audition</b> {{are used in the}} minigame as the number of times the player is given to successfully appeal to the judge until all the points are exhausted. For instance, three heart points indicates the player will have three chances to increase a judge's interest level. At the end of <b>the</b> <b>audition,</b> a judge's interest level determines if the idol passes or not. If an idol passes <b>the</b> <b>audition,</b> he or she is chosen to do a televised performance of the song previously chosen. A performance serves to increase an idol's number of fans, which in turn can increase an idol's rank if enough fans have been obtained for a given rank. For example, an idol starts at rank F with below 10,000 fans, and the next level up is a rank E with between 10,001 and 99,999 fans. The ranks continue from D to C, B, A and finally S.|$|E
