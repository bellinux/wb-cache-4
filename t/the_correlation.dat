5|$|In {{most current}} cultures, {{it is more}} typical for women to wear long hair than for men to do so.

A significant correlation was also found between women's hair length and hair quality. Moreover, hair quality was correlated with the women's perceived physical health. Consistent with principles of evolutionary psychology, {{these results indicate that}} hair length and quality can act as a cue to a woman's youth and health, signifying reproductive potential. <b>The</b> <b>correlation</b> between the woman's hair length and marital status, or number of children, was however not more than to be expected from <b>the</b> <b>correlation</b> between hair length and age.|$|E

40|$|The {{properties}} of the known superconductors can be explained with <b>the</b> <b>correlations</b> dominated superconducting mechanism (CSM). <b>The</b> <b>correlations</b> have <b>the</b> spin <b>correlation,</b> <b>the</b> charge <b>correlation</b> and <b>the</b> spin-charge <b>correlation,</b> and their strengths can be described by <b>the</b> related <b>correlation</b> lengths in their correlation functions. Our evaluation from many superconductors is that superconductivities occur if both <b>the</b> spin <b>correlation</b> and <b>the</b> charge <b>correlation</b> are stronger, and the calculation of a Hubbard model showed that <b>the</b> spin-charge <b>correlation</b> may govern superconductivities 1. Afterwards, this mechanism has led a model which includes various superconductivities and magnetisms, and the relation between superconductivities and magnetisms can be understood on this model 2 (these results have been shown by calculations). This mechanism is very practical, for example, to turn a material into a superconductor or increase the Tc of a superconductor, {{what we will do}} is to increase <b>the</b> spin-charge <b>correlation.</b> In this letter, we first describe the relations between <b>the</b> spin-charge <b>correlation,</b> <b>the</b> spin <b>correlation</b> and <b>the</b> charge <b>correlation,</b> take these relations as the basis of constructing a new phase diagram, and then classify the known superconductors into various sections in this phase diagram.
