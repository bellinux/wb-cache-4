5|$|Early in {{the morning}} of 1 May, the gunmen ordered one of the hostages to {{telephone}} the BBC's news desk. During the call, Oan took <b>the</b> <b>receiver</b> <b>and</b> spoke directly to the BBC journalist. He identified the group to which the gunmen belonged and stated that the non-Iranian hostages would not be harmed, but refused to allow the journalist to speak to any other hostages. At some point during the day, the police disabled the embassy's telephone lines, leaving the hostage-takers just the field telephone for outside communication. As the hostages woke up, Chris Cramer, a sound organiser for the BBC, became seriously ill and his colleague, Sim Harris, was taken to the field telephone to negotiate for a doctor. The police negotiator refused the request, instead telling Harris to persuade Oan to release Cramer. The ensuing negotiations between Harris, Oan, and the police took up most of the morning, and Cramer was eventually released at 11:15. He was rushed to hospital in an ambulance, accompanied by police officers sent to gather information from him.|$|E

25|$|One way {{to obtain}} a {{distance}} measurement {{is based on the}} time-of-flight: transmit a short pulse of radio signal (electromagnetic radiation) and measure the time it takes for the reflection to return.

Since radio waves travel at the speed of light, accurate distance measurement requires high-speed electronics.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In this paper, we {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} output quantization on the secrecy capacity of the binary-input Gaussian wiretap channel. As a result, a closed-form expression with infinite summation terms of the secrecy capacity of the binary-input Gaussian wiretap channel is derived for the case when both <b>the</b> legitimate <b>receiver</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> eavesdropper have unquantized outputs. In particular, computable tight {{upper and lower bounds}} on the secrecy capacity are obtained. Theoretically, we prove that when <b>the</b> legitimate <b>receiver</b> has unquantized outputs while the eavesdropper has binary quantized outputs, the secrecy capacity is larger than that when both <b>the</b> legitimate <b>receiver</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> eavesdropper have unquantized outputs or both have binary quantized outputs. Further, numerical results show that in the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) (of the main channel) region, the secrecy capacity of the binary input Gaussian wiretap channel when both <b>the</b> legitimate <b>receiver</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> eavesdropper have unquantized outputs is larger than the capacity when both <b>the</b> legitimate <b>receiver</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> eavesdropper have binary quantized outputs; as the SNR increases, the secrecy capacity when both <b>the</b> legitimate <b>receiver</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> eavesdropper have binary quantized outputs tends to overtake...|$|R
25|$|Colt's first effort {{toward a}} {{metallic}} cartridge revolver was by conversion of existing percussion revolvers. The {{first of these}} conversions was patented on September 15, 1868 by Colt engineer, F. Alexander Thuer as patent number 82258. The Thuer conversion was made by milling off the rear of <b>the</b> <b>receiver</b> <b>and</b> {{replacing it with a}} breechplate containing six internal firing pins. The cartridges were loaded through the mouths of the chambers. Colt made 5000 of these but they were not well accepted. Colt found the mechanism so complex it included a spare percussion cylinder with each revolver.|$|E
25|$|The Bizon uses {{a simple}} {{straight}} blowback method of operation, an unlocked breech system reduces cost and build complexity. The Bizon's operating cycle {{is characterized by}} a very short recoil stroke, standard 9×18mm ammunition will only drive the bolt partially to the rear of <b>the</b> <b>receiver</b> <b>and</b> produces a cyclic rate of 700 rounds/min. High-impulse ammunition forces the bolt to travel {{all the way to the}} end of the receiver, barely striking the receiver wall. A rate of fire of 650–680 rounds/min is the result. This has the effect of reducing perceived recoil and increasing controllability and hit probability.|$|E
25|$|Reciprocity {{tends to}} be {{discouraged}} in contemporary organ gifting, thus creating an irresoluble sense of debt in the receiver. This separation of the donor from the object being given was not always implemented, and in earlier cases of organ transplantation the receiver could obtain information from the donor and even meet. As Holtkamp (2002) has argued, this arrangement created a feeling of debt in <b>the</b> <b>receiver</b> (<b>and</b> close kin) {{and led to the}} creation of obligations. The discouragement of reciprocal relationships between giver and receiver is produced through what Sharp (2001) has labeled etiquettes of dehumanization where the identities of the donors are removed from the organs.|$|E

25|$|Armstrong {{was able}} to put his ideas into practice, and the {{technique}} was soon adopted by the military. However, it was less popular when commercial radio broadcasting began in the 1920s, mostly due to the need for an extra tube (for the oscillator), the generally higher cost of <b>the</b> <b>receiver,</b> <b>and</b> the level of technical skill required to operate it. For early domestic radios, tuned radio frequency receivers (TRF) were more popular because they were cheaper, easier for a non-technical owner to use, and less costly to operate. Armstrong eventually sold his superheterodyne patent to Westinghouse, who then sold it to RCA, the latter monopolizing the market for superheterodyne receivers until 1930.|$|E

25|$|The bearing {{measurement}} {{was received}} {{on a separate}} receiver and antenna system. In this case, two half-wave dipoles were used, located about one wavelength apart horizontally on the antenna framework. Both antennas were connected together electrically before entering the receivers, with the outputs {{of one of them}} inverted. This meant that the output signal would drop to zero when the antennas were precisely aligned with the target. Any mis-alignment changed the relative phase of the signals slightly, producing a net signal that entered <b>the</b> <b>receiver</b> <b>and</b> produced a display. However, {{it was not possible to}} know which of the two antennas was the one producing the net output; the system provided an indication of when the antenna was on-target, but not which side to turn to when it was off-target.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — We study secret-key {{agreement}} with public discussion over a flat-fading wiretap channel model. The fading gains are correlated across <b>the</b> <b>receivers</b> <b>and</b> sam-pled independently at each time. Perfect receiver channel state information (CSI) is assumed, whereas a noisy CSI {{of the main}} channel is also available to the transmitter. We propose lower and upper bounds on the capacity. Our lower bound is achieved by a coding scheme that involves a separate binning of <b>the</b> <b>receiver</b> CSI sequence <b>and</b> its channel output sequence. In general it improves upon the joint-binning schemes considered in earlier works. Our {{upper and lower bounds}} coincide, establishing the capacity, when either the transmitter has no CSI or when the channel gains of <b>the</b> legitimate <b>receiver</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> eavesdropper are statistically independent.
