However they came to blows over the name and design of the company, but resolved their differences with Darren moving into the boarding house, Tony working as a taxi driver and Maxine Minniver (Nikki Sanderson) takes over as receptionist.|$|E
5|$|The puffins are {{energetic}} burrow-engineers and repairers and {{the grassy}} slopes may be undermined by {{a network of}} tunnels. This causes the turf to dry out in summer, vegetation to die and dry soil be whirled away by the wind. Burrows sometimes collapse, and humans may cause this to happen by walking incautiously across nesting slopes. A colony on Grassholm was lost through erosion when there was so little soil left that burrows could not be made. New colonies are very unlikely <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>up</b> spontaneously because this gregarious bird will only nest where others are already present. Nevertheless, the Audubon Society had success on Eastern Egg Rock Island in Maine, where, after a gap of ninety years, puffins were reintroduced and started breeding again. By 2011 there were over 120 pairs nesting on the small islet. On the Isle of May {{on the other side}} of the Atlantic, only five pairs of puffins were breeding in 1958 while twenty years later there were 10,000 pairs.|$|E

25|$|Less fissile fuel needed. Because LFTRs are thermal {{spectrum}} reactors, they need much less fissile fuel to get started. Only 1-2 tons of fissile are required <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>up</b> a single fluid LFTR, and potentially {{as low as}} 0.4 ton for a two fluid design. In comparison, solid fueled fast breeder reactors need at least 8 tons of fissile fuel to start the reactor. While fast reactors can theoretically start up very well on the transuranic waste, their high fissile fuel startup makes this very expensive.|$|E
25|$|Low fissile inventory. Because the fissile fuel is {{concentrated}} in a small core fluid, the actual reactor core is more compact. There is no fissile material in the outer blanket that contains the fertile fuel for breeding. Because of this, the 1968 ORNL design required just 315 kilograms of fissile materials <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>up</b> a 250 MW(e) two fluid MSBR reactor. This reduces {{the cost of the}} initial fissile startup charge, and allows more reactors to be started up on any given amount of fissile material.|$|E
