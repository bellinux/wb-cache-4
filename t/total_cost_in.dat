The {{total cost of}} these projects during the lifetime of the programme (1984–1991) was ECU 98 million, with the EU providing ECU 41 million, or 44.5 percent of the <b>total</b> <b>cost.</b> <b>In</b> addition, a different budget line was made available from 1988 onwards for 'urgent actions for endangered species'. It was not supported by a Regulation but {{was included in the}} annual budget of the Commission by the European Parliament. In total, 50 projects were financed with assistance totalling €3 million under this budget.|$|E
25|$|Spain {{still had}} a huge {{overseas}} empire, but France was now the dominant power on continental Europe, and the United Provinces were dominant in the Atlantic. The Great Plague of Seville (1647–1652) killed up to 25% of Seville's population. Sevilla, and indeed the economy of Andalucía, would never recover from such complete devastation. Altogether Spain was thought to have lost 500,000 people, out of a population of slightly fewer than 10,000,000, or nearly 5% of its entire population. Historians reckon the <b>total</b> <b>cost</b> <b>in</b> human lives due to these plagues throughout Spain, throughout the entire 17th century, to be a minimum of nearly 1.25 million.|$|E
25|$|TfL {{introduced}} the Oyster card in 2003; {{this is a}} pre-payment smartcard with an embedded contactless RFID chip. It can be loaded with Travelcards and used on the Underground, the Overground, buses, trams, the Docklands Light Railway, and National Rail services within London. Fares for single journeys are cheaper than paper tickets, and a daily cap limits the <b>total</b> <b>cost</b> <b>in</b> a day {{to the price of}} a Day Travelcard. The Oyster card must be 'touched in' at the start and end of a journey, otherwise it is regarded as 'incomplete' and the maximum fare charged. In March 2012 the cost of this in the previous year to travellers was £66.5 million. Contactless payment cards can be used instead of an Oyster card on buses, and this was extended to London Underground, London Overground, DLR and most National Rail services in London from 16 September 2014. The use of these has grown very quickly and now over a million contactless transactions are made on the Underground every day.|$|E

40|$|Objective: The {{treatment}} {{of patients with}} schizophrenia consumes a considerable proportion of health service budgets, yet {{there have been few}} attempts to prospectively analyse the costs associated with this condition. Amid the current debate about where to invest scarce treatment resources to achieve optimal outcomes, real-world studies, such as the Schizophrenia Care and Assessment Programme (SCAP) contrast with hypothetically based models and provide comprehensive and broad-ranging data. Method: Direct health-care costs were prospectively studied in a cohort of 347 patients with schizophrenia in Dandenong, Australia over 3 years. Indirect costs were estimated from patient self-reported information. Results: The average annual societal cost was AU$ 32 160 per participant {{in the first year of}} the study, AU$ 27 190 in the second year and AU$ 29 181 in the third year. Indirect costs accounted for 46 % of the <b>total</b> <b>costs</b> <b>in</b> the first year, 52 % of the <b>total</b> <b>costs</b> <b>in</b> the second year and 50 % of the <b>total</b> <b>costs</b> <b>in</b> the third year.
