40|$|The {{main object}} {{of the concept of}} the {{definition}} of a permanent establishment in a double tax agreement is to set out the type and permanency of business activities that an entity must conduct before they can be subject to tax in another jurisdiction. Furthermore, the definition of a 'permanent establishment' as defined in article 5 of the OECD model tax convention requires the existence of a fixed place of business. This indicates the existence of a facility with a certain degree of permanence. The internet has changed the traditional international business model. It is no longer necessary that the entrepreneur, or his employees, agents, branches or intermediaries is in the country where the business is being conducted. It is clear that the internet overcomes the traditional limitations of physical presence in a jurisdiction when doing business. This poses a challenge {{when it comes to the}} determination of a 'permanent establishment', as the test is based on a physical presence of an entity in a jurisdiction. I want to determine if the current concept of a permanent establishment is still adequate to address the challenges posed by e-commerce. Taking into account that e-commerce was not a factor when the basis of the definition of the definition of a permanent establishment was formulated. The views of the OECD on e-commerce will be analysed to determine what they envisage and if they are of the opinion that the current definition is adequate to address the concept and reality of e-commerce and the taxation thereof. It is important to explore the views of the rest of the world on e-commerce and the taxation thereof. A multinational entity must be aware of the <b>tax</b> <b>presence</b> it can create in a foreign country, especially when it comes to creating a permanent establishment in that foreign country. It is my aim to identify and discuss the challenges and difficulties e-commerce poses when determining the existence of a permanent establishment and also to research certain adaptions and recommendations of the current taxing system and relevant guidelines...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe Tax protein {{expressed}} by human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV- 1) plays {{a pivotal role}} in the deregulation of cellular pathways involved in the immune response, inflammation, cell survival, and cancer. Many of these effects derive from Tax multiple interactions with host factors, including the subunits of the IKK-complex that are required for NF-κB activation.

40|$|The {{literature}} {{on the use of}} environmental <b>taxes</b> inthe <b>presence</b> of distortionary (labor) taxes warns thata partial-equilibrium Pigouvian tax analysis is notappropriate because increasing the price of dirtygoods can futher aggravate the prexisting distortions. This argument is most frequently made assuming thatlabor is taxed to meet a fixed revenue requirement. When a dirty good is also taxed, others argue thatthis lowers workers' real wages, causing people toreduce their labor supply below its already suboptimallevel, aggravating labor market distortions. However,most papers ignore the effect that a cleanerenvironment can have on labor supply. That is, mostpast work has assumed that the quality of theenvironment is weakly separable in the utilityfunction. We argue that a cleaner environment canincrease labor supply, at least partially offsettingany incentive for workers to decrease their laborsupply. Further, we show explicitly how relaxing theseparability assumption affects the standardresults.

This research captures several observations. First, capital formation or investment is an important channel for consumption smoothing over the life cycles. Second, capital gains are taxed only when the gains are realized. Third, inflation introduces an upward bias in the calculation of tax base. Thus, a capital gains <b>tax</b> in the <b>presence</b> of inflation can have a significant welfare eect even though its contribution to the government revenue is relatively small.

40|$|Pigouvian {{taxes are}} {{typically}} imposed {{in situations where}} there is imperfect knowledge {{on the extent of}} damage caused by a producing firm. A regulator imposing imperfectly informed Pigouvian taxes may cause the firms that should (should not) produce to shut down (produce). In this paper we use a Bayesian information framework to identify optimal signal-conditioned <b>taxes</b> in the <b>presence</b> of such losses. The tax system involves reducing (increasing) taxes on firms identified as causing high (low) damage. Unfortunately, when an abatement decision has to be made, the tax system that minimizes production distortions also dampens the incentive to abate. In the absence of wrong-firm concerns, a regulator can solve the problem by not adjusting taxes for signal noise. When wrong-firm losses are a concern, the regulator has to trade off losses from distorted production incentives with losses from distorted abatement incentives. The most appropriate policy may involve a combination of instruments. conditioning; heterogeneity; informativeness; Pigouvian tax; signaling...|$|R

40|$|Standard Pigovian tax {{theory has}} been {{extended}} in two directions. First, many polluting activities are difficult to tax {{because they are not}} market transactions, and so recent papers have shown that the same effects can be achieved by use of a two-part instrument (2 PI) : a tax on output or income and a subsidy for clean alternatives to pollution. It is a generalization of a deposit–refund system (DRS). Second, a different literature concerns the second-best pollution <b>tax</b> in the <b>presence</b> of other <b>tax</b> distortions. Here, we combine the two extensions by looking at the second-best 2 PI. When government needs revenue, is the deposit larger and the rebate smaller? We find explicit solutions for each tax and subsidy in a general equilibrium model with other tax distortions, and we compare these to the rates in a first-best model. The tax–subsidy combination is explained in terms of a tax effect, an environmental effect and a revenue effect. The model allows for flexible interpretation to show various applications of the 2 PI.

Unlike most of the previous analyses of optimal inflationary finance, the model postulates that conventional taxes carry collection costs whereas fiat money can be printed costlessly. For some countries, I measure tax collection costs, use the tax evasion estimates reported in the literature, and then calculate the optimal interest rate based on the model. Comparison of the actual and optimal interest rates demonstrates that the model can in fact partly explain the observed deviations from the Friedman Rule. I also show that allowing cross-country differences in the elasticity of substitution between formal and informal sectors can increase the model's explanatory power. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{positive}} and normative effects of a progressive tax on wages in a nonlinear New Keynesian DSGE model {{in the presence of}} demand and technology shocks. The non-linearity allows us to disentangle the effects of the progressive tax on the volatility and the level of macroeconomic variables, for both intertemporally optimizing ("Ricardian") and non-Ricardian ("rule-of-thumb") households. We find that the interaction of the two household types is of crucial importance. When only Ricardian households are considered, progressive taxes increase welfare (compared to at <b>taxes)</b> in the <b>presence</b> of technology shocks. Aggregate welfare falls, however, when rule-of-thumb households are added to the analysis. The progressive tax increases the welfare of the latter household by lowering its consumption volatility, but this is overcompensated for by the destabilization of Ricardian household consumption. Under demand shocks, progressive taxes reduce the welfare of both household types, with the welfare of rule-of-thumb households falling despite a decline in their consumption volatility. The reason is a lower average consumption level which is related to the changed curvature of the marginal cost function...|$|R
