5|$|At 06:00, Howell, who was {{in charge}} of a post to the right of the line, noticed the {{battalion}} on the right flank was being forced out of its trench and was beginning to retire. Immediately alerting battalion headquarters, Captain Alexander MacKenzie—who had assumed temporary command of the battalion—hurriedly organised a group of non-combatant soldiers from headquarters together with several signallers to form a defensive line along a road bank in order to fend off the expected German advance. A fierce bombing and grenade fight soon ensued, with both sides suffering heavy casualties. Fearing the Germans would outflank his battalion, Howell climbed onto the top of the parapet and began running along <b>the</b> <b>trench</b> line throwing bombs down on the Germans, all the while being subject to heavy rifle and bomb fire. Forcing the Germans back along <b>the</b> <b>trench,</b> Howell was supported by Lieutenant Thomas Richards who followed him along <b>the</b> <b>trench</b> firing bursts from his Lewis Gun. Soon exhusting his supply of bombs, Howell began to attack with his bayonet until he fell into <b>the</b> <b>trench</b> wounded. Howell had been hit in both legs by machine gun fire, and when he was brought into the clearing station some hours later, it was discovered he had suffered at least twenty-eight separate wounds. Due to his actions, the ground which had been lost was soon retaken, and the German attack was later repulsed.|$|E
5|$|Muhammad {{established}} his military headquarters at the hillock of Sala' {{and the army}} was arrayed there; this position would give the Muslims an advantage if the enemy crossed <b>the</b> <b>trench.</b>|$|E
5|$|On 19 December 1914, near Givenchy, {{during a}} night attack, Lt. Bruce was {{in command of}} a small party which {{captured}} one of the enemy's trenches. In spite of being severely wounded in the neck, he {{walked up and down}} <b>the</b> <b>trench,</b> encouraging his men to hold on against several counter-attacks for some hours until killed. The fire from rifles and bombs was very heavy all day, and it was due to the skilful disposition made, and the example and encouragement shown by Lt. Bruce that his men were able to hold out until dusk, when <b>the</b> <b>trench</b> was finally captured by the enemy.|$|E
50|$|Another {{technique}} that is useful is contour <b>trenching.</b> This involves <b>the</b> digging of 150m long, 1m deep <b>trenches</b> in <b>the</b> soil. <b>The</b> <b>trenches</b> are made {{parallel to the}} height lines of the landscape, preventing the water from flowing within <b>the</b> <b>trenches</b> and causing erosion. Stone walls are placed around <b>the</b> <b>trenches</b> to prevent <b>the</b> <b>trenches</b> from closing up again. The method was invented by Peter Westerveld.|$|R

50|$|The {{action is}} {{confined}} to the mud-entrenched, rat-infested confines of <b>the</b> <b>trenches</b> and dugouts. <b>The</b> film shows a grim picture of life in <b>the</b> <b>trenches</b> during <b>the</b> war.|$|R
5|$|The Confederate army {{made several}} other {{attempts}} to cross <b>the</b> <b>trench</b> {{during the night}} but repeatedly failed. Although the confederates could have deployed their infantry over the whole length of <b>the</b> <b>trench,</b> they were unwilling to engage the Muslims at close quarter as the former regarded the latter as superior in hand-to-hand fighting. As the Muslim army was well dug in behind the embankment made from the earth which {{had been taken from}} the ditch and prepared to bombard attackers with stones and arrows, any attack could cause great casualties.|$|E
5|$|The Epiriotes {{launched}} their first assault {{against the city}} at daybreak. However, {{they were unable to}} get a firm footing because of <b>the</b> <b>trench</b> and were repulsed by the defenders, who were encouraged by the women. In order to circumvent this obstacle. Pyrrhus ordered a 2,000 picked force of Gauls and Chaonians commanded by Ptolemy to attempt to go around <b>the</b> <b>trench.</b> Finding their path blocked by the wagons, they began to pulling them out of the ground. Aware of the danger, Acrotatus used a series of depressions to attack this force from the rear and managed to the push the Epiriote flanking group into <b>the</b> <b>trench</b> after inflicting heavy casualties upon them. Unable to make an impact on the defences, Pyrrhus ordered his troops to withdraw to their camp at nightfall.|$|E
5|$|But by {{the time}} he {{captured}} the position, the rest of his company lay dead or wounded. Singh was left alone to achieve the objective assigned. He advanced towards the second Pakistani medium machine gun post. At this juncture, he was almost blinded by a grenade that blast at his face. His Sten gun ammunition had run out. Singh moved out of <b>the</b> <b>trench</b> and lobbed grenades at the next Pakistani post. Meanwhile, he jumped into another trench, and killed two Pakistani soldiers with his bayonet. Before he was able to move out of <b>the</b> <b>trench,</b> he was hit by a bullet in his head. As he succumbed to his wounds, Singh hurled a grenade into a nearby Pakistani trench.|$|E

50|$|Pipe layers operate <b>the</b> {{backhoes}} and <b>trenching</b> {{machinery that}} dig <b>the</b> <b>trenches</b> to accommodate <b>the</b> placement of sanitary sewer pipes and stormwater sewer drainpipes. They use surveyor’s equipment to ensure <b>the</b> <b>trenches</b> have <b>the</b> proper slope and install {{the pieces of}} pipe in <b>the</b> <b>trenches,</b> joining <b>the</b> ends with cement, glue or welding equipment. Using an always-open or always-closed valve called a tap, pipe layers connect them to a wider system and bury the pipes.|$|R
50|$|Shallow {{drainage}} trenches {{may also}} be equipped with geocomposites. The scarped sides of <b>the</b> <b>trenches</b> are covered with geocomposite panels. The bottom of <b>the</b> <b>trenches</b> houses a drainage tube placed in continuity to the geocomposite canvas.|$|R
5|$|For the Muslims, {{the battle}} was a {{significant}} setback. Although they had been close to routing the Meccans a second time, their breach of Muhammad's orders in favor of collecting Meccan spoils reaped severe consequences. The two armies would meet again in AD 627 at the Battle of <b>the</b> <b>Trench.</b>|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after hearing}} the rumours about the Qurayza, Muhammad had sent 100 men to the inner city for its protection. Later he sent 300 {{horsemen}} (cavalry was not needed at <b>the</b> <b>trench)</b> as well to protect the city. The loud voices, in which the troops prayed every night, created {{the illusion of a}} large force.|$|E
5|$|In {{front of}} the Royal Crescent is a Ha-ha, a trench on which the inner side of which is {{vertical}} and faced with stone, with the outer face sloped and turfed, making <b>the</b> <b>trench,</b> in effect, a sunken fence or retaining wall. The ha-ha is designed not to interrupt the view from Royal Victoria Park, and to be invisible until seen from close by.|$|E
50|$|Although {{there was}} little danger of an {{accidental}} nuclear explosion, {{the destruction of the}} nuclear warhead on the launch pad caused contamination of the area by alpha-emitting core materials. Burning rocket fuel, flowing through <b>the</b> cable <b>trenches,</b> caused extensive chemical contamination of <b>the</b> <b>trenches</b> and <b>the</b> equipment associated with the cabling in <b>the</b> <b>trenches.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Upon {{entering}} <b>the</b> <b>trenches,</b> <b>the</b> {{men from}} D-Company {{were surprised to}} find a number of civilians, being used as human shields by the guerrillas hiding inside. The guerrillas opened fire on the paratroopers, leading the paratroopers to enter what they described later {{as a mode of}} [...] "kill or be killed", in which preventing the deaths of the civilians in <b>the</b> <b>trenches</b> was impossible. Though a number of civilians were killed in those <b>trenches,</b> as <b>the</b> paratroopers moved forward encountered less and less civilians until nearer the guns all those in <b>the</b> <b>trenches,</b> male and female, were wearing SWAPO's Cuban-style uniforms. In the meantime, 9 Platoon had entered <b>the</b> <b>trenches</b> from <b>the</b> north, though were making slow progress as they came under the attention of the gunners.|$|R
25|$|Two major faults, the Denali Fault and the Tintina Fault {{have created}} major valleys called trenches: <b>the</b> Shakwak <b>Trench</b> and <b>the</b> Tintina <b>Trench.</b> <b>The</b> Shakwak <b>Trench</b> {{separates}} <b>the</b> Kluane ranges from other mountain ranges north of it. The Haines Highway and the Alaska Highway north of Haines Junction are built in <b>the</b> Shakwak <b>Trench.</b> <b>The</b> Tintina <b>Trench</b> bisects <b>the</b> Yukon from northwest to southeast and its edges have rich mineral deposits including the Klondike gold and the lead-zinc deposits near Faro.|$|R
5|$|In {{response}} to the Spartan counter-attack against the Epiriotes filling <b>the</b> <b>trench,</b> Pyrrhus decided to personally lead a charge against the Spartan lines. Mounted on his horse, the Epiriote King was able to force his away through <b>the</b> <b>trench,</b> over the wagons and into the city {{with a group of}} his companions. The sudden onslaught of Pyrrhus sparked panic amongst the defenders of this section. At this point Pyrrhus' horse was wounded by a javelin which pierced its belly causing it to throw the King to the ground. The fall of the King threw his companions into a state of confusion and enabled the Spartans to rally. The Spartans launched a barrage of missiles at the King's comrades, felling many of them. Despite the deaths of many of his guards, Pyrrhus was successfully taken to the safety of the main Epiriote lines.|$|E
5|$|Khalid's {{leadership}} {{was instrumental in}} turning the tables and ensuring a Meccan victory during the Battle of Uhud (625). In 627 AD he {{was a part of}} Quraysh's campaign against the Muslims, resulting in the Battle of <b>the</b> <b>Trench,</b> Khalid's last battle against Muslims.|$|E
5|$|The final {{army that}} would defend {{the city from}} the {{invasion}} consisted of 3,000 men, and included all inhabitants of Medina {{over the age of}} 14, except the Banu Qurayza (the Qurayza did supply the Muslims with some instruments for digging <b>the</b> <b>trench).</b>|$|E
50|$|On 18 June 1855 at Sebastopol, Crimea, {{after the}} {{regiment}} had retired into <b>the</b> <b>trenches</b> from <b>the</b> {{assault on the}} Redan, Private Sims went out under very heavy fire in broad daylight and brought in wounded soldiers outside <b>the</b> <b>trenches.</b>|$|R

5|$|Conditions were {{worst in}} <b>the</b> Allied <b>trenches.</b> <b>The</b> Germans were {{more willing to}} accept <b>the</b> <b>trenches</b> as {{long-term}} positions, and used concrete blocks to build secure shelters deep underground, often with electrical lighting and heating.|$|R
5|$|There {{were three}} {{trenches}} {{in a typical}} front line sector; the fire trench, the support trench and the reserve trench, all joined by communication trenches. The trenches varied in depth, but they were usually {{about four or five}} feet deep, or in areas with a high water table a wall of sandbags would be built to allow the defenders to stand upright, fire trenches were provided with a fire step, so the occupants could return fire during an attack (see diagram). Ideally, the bottom of <b>the</b> <b>trench</b> was lined with duckboards to prevent men from sinking into the mud and dugouts were cut into the walls, these gave shelter from the elements and shrapnel, although in the British Army dugouts were usually reserved for the officers and senior NCOs. The men were then expected to sleep wherever they could and in wet weather they lived under groundsheets or in tents at the bottom of <b>the</b> <b>trench</b> on the duckboards.|$|E
5|$|A set {{procedure}} {{was used by}} a division that was moving into the front line. Once they had been informed that they were moving forward, the brigadiers and battalion commanders would {{be taken to the}} forward areas to reconnoitre the sections of the front that were to be occupied by their troops. Meanwhile, the battalion transport officers would be taken to the headquarters of the division that they were relieving to observe the methods used for drawing rations and ammunition, {{and the manner in which}} they were supplied to the troops at the front. Detachments from the divisional artillery group would move forward and were attached to the artillery batteries of the division they were relieving. Five days later, the infantry battalions that were destined for the front line sent forward their specialists from the Lewis gun teams, and the grenade officer, the machine gun officer, the four company commanders, and some of the signallers to take over <b>the</b> <b>trench</b> stores and settle into <b>the</b> <b>trench</b> routine before the battalions moved in. Overnight, the battalions would move into the line, and the artillery would take over the guns that were already in position, leaving theirs behind to be taken over by the batteries that had been relieved.|$|E
5|$|As they {{attempted}} to continue up the hill, several Chinese soldiers from a nearby trench opened fire, injuring another soldier. According to witness reports, Bleak rushed <b>the</b> <b>trench</b> and dove into it, tackling one Chinese soldier and, with only his hands, broke the soldier's neck, killing him. Bleak was then confronted by a second soldier, whom he reportedly grabbed by the neck, fatally crushing his windpipe. A third Chinese soldier then approached, and in the ensuing scuffle, Bleak used his combat knife to stab and kill the soldier.|$|E

25|$|After a {{combination}} of the attack through <b>the</b> <b>trenches</b> and <b>the</b> mortar fire, the guns were silenced. The toll was an acceptable one for the South Africans; there were at least 95 SWAPO fighters dead inside <b>the</b> <b>trenches</b> and around <b>the</b> guns. Two paratroopers had been killed.|$|R
5|$|Before World War One men {{generally}} had longer {{hair and}} beards. However, short hair on men {{was introduced in}} World War One for soldiers. Slaves and defeated armies were often required to shave their heads. <b>The</b> <b>trench</b> warfare in 1914 to 1918 exposed men to flea and lice infestations, which prompted the order to cut short hair, establishing a military tradition, and it expanded among civilians by imitation.|$|E
5|$|Bolstered by {{the fresh}} troops, the Spartans and their Macedonian allies {{prepared}} themselves for Pyrrhus' next assault against <b>the</b> <b>trench.</b> The presence of more adversaries intensified Pyrrhus' determination {{to capture the}} city and he ordered another attack on the trenches. He was unable to accomplish anything and suffered further losses. The failure of this attack convinced Pyrrhus about the futility of persevering with the siege {{and he decided to}} lift it and withdraw.|$|E
5|$|In {{the siege}} of Medina, the Meccans exerted the {{available}} strength to destroy the Muslim community. The failure resulted in a significant loss of prestige; their trade with Syria vanished. Following the Battle of <b>the</b> <b>Trench,</b> Muhammad made two expeditions to the north, both ended without any fighting. While returning from one of these journeys (or some years earlier according to other early accounts), an accusation of adultery was made against Aisha, Muhammad's wife. Aisha was exonerated from accusations when Muhammad announced he had received a revelation confirming Aisha's innocence and directing that charges of adultery be supported by four eyewitnesses (sura 24, An-Nur).|$|E
