25|$|A smaller spot, {{designated}} Oval BA, formed recently (March 2000) {{from the}} merger of three white ovals, has turned reddish in color. Astronomers have named it <b>the</b> <b>Little</b> <b>Red</b> Spot or Red, Jr. As of June 5, 2006, the Great Red Spot and Oval BA appeared to be approaching convergence. The storms pass each other about every two years but the passings of 2002 and 2004 were of little significance. Amy Simon-Miller, of the Goddard Space Flight Center, predicted the storms would have their closest passing on July 4, 2006. She worked with Imke de Pater and Phil Marcus of UC Berkeley, {{and a team of}} professional astronomers since April 2006 to study the storms using the Hubble Space Telescope; on July 20, the two storms were photographed passing each other by the Gemini Observatory without converging. In May 2008 a third storm turned red.|$|E

50|$|This {{species of}} flying fox hangs in a {{different}} way from other mainland species. The larger species tend to hang an arm's length apart; however, <b>the</b> <b>little</b> <b>reds</b> tend to clump together so they may hang in groups of 20 or more animals on an individual branch. So, these animals are associated with significant canopy and branch damage in camps where they reside. They also tend to appear in very large numbers (20,000 or more) and the 'footprint' of a camp can expand rapidly for the several weeks or months they remain at a site. Their large numbers and the damage they cause to a camp site mean they are not very popular animals.|$|R

25|$|Born in Lengfurt, Bavaria, Germany, Kahles {{arrived in}} America {{at the age}} of seven. His family settled in Brooklyn, New York, living in the Windsor Terrace neighborhood, then a semi-rural area. Young Charles Kahles grew up in Brooklyn, where he lived for many years. With plans to become a painter, he studied art at Pratt Institute and also {{attended}} the Brooklyn Art School. His first art job was in the stained glass shop of Joseph Hausleiter in Brooklyn, working alongside his brother Fred. At the age of 16, he went to Williamsport, Pennsylvania, where he became the staff artist on the newspaper Grit, followed by a short spell as a staff artist at the New York Recorder. In 1897–98, he drew assignments for the New York Journal, where he also contributed cartoons. In 1898, he was hired as a news illustrator by the New York World, where he also drew such comics as <b>The</b> <b>Little</b> <b>Red</b> Schoolhouse, Butch the Butcher's Boy, The Perils of Submarine Boating, Clumsy Claude, Optimistic Oswald and The Kelly Kids. In 1902, Clarence the Cop was the first police strip, and his Sandy Highflyer, the Airship Man (1902–04), was the first aviation comic strip. Foolish Fred ran from September 25 to December 11, 1904.|$|E

500|$|Turning {{away from}} the {{well-known}} archetypes of <b>the</b> <b>Little</b> <b>Red</b> Riding Hood characters, the filmmakers continued to look towards non-linear crime dramas for inspiration instead.

500|$|Although Wyman noted {{some early}} {{criticism}} of their rendition, Janovitz {{described it as}} [...] "a fairly faithful version [...] ". It is performed as a moderately slow (74 bpm) blues in the key of G. [...] Although AllMusic reviewer Matthew Greenwald describes their arrangement as having a straight I-IV-V twelve-bar blues progression, they sometimes vary the changes, {{but not in the}} same manner as Howlin' Wolf. [...] Jagger uses the lyrics from the original (omitting Cooke's extra verse), but makes one important change—instead of [...] "I got a little red rooster", he sings [...] "I am <b>the</b> <b>little</b> <b>red</b> rooster", although the later verse reverts to [...] "If you see my little red rooster". Instrumentally, Bill Wyman generally follows Dixon's bass lines. Charlie Watts later admitted that his drum part was inspired by Sam Cooke's version, which was played by Hal Blaine. Keith Richards adds a rhythm guitar part; according to Egan, [...] "the juxtaposition of acoustic guitar and electric slide all make for something richer and warmer than any blues they had ever attempted before".|$|E
500|$|After Davidson's {{death and}} burial, press {{attention}} withered as newspapers concentrated on more significant {{events in the}} years before the Second World War. In the decades after the war interest in the affair was periodically revived. In 1963 Blythe, deemed by Parris to be the affair's [...] "best historian", published his account. Later in the 1960s, two stage musical versions were produced: The Stiffkey Scandals of 1932, which appeared in Edinburgh in 1967 and London in 1968, and God Made <b>the</b> <b>Little</b> <b>Red</b> Apple, staged in Manchester in 1969. Neither of these productions was commercially successful; when the former was adapted for television, The Daily Telegraphs critic questioned the artistic justification for a musical about [...] "so sad and peculiar a person". In the 1970s Davidson's case {{was the subject of a}} radio documentary, A Proper Little Gent, and in 1994 an episode of BBC Television's Matter of Fact series examined the affair. Cullen's full-length biography of Davidson in 1975 posits a theory that multiple personalities led him to behave in different ways in differing circumstances. Robert Brown, in a biographical sketch for the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, suggests that what really motivated Davidson will never be known. In 2007 John Walsh published a fictionalised account of Davidson's life, Sunday at the Cross Bones (Fourth Estate), in which, according to a review in The Guardian, Davidson is depicted as [...] "well-meaning but ineffectual, bewildered by the world's wickedness and his own barely acknowledged desires".|$|E
2500|$|For example, [...] "Bombs {{were made}} in {{classrooms}} of left-wing schools and planted indiscriminately on the streets" [...] became [...] "Bombs were planted indiscriminately on the streets"; the fragment [...] "waving aloft <b>the</b> <b>Little</b> <b>Red</b> Book and shouting slogans" [...] disappeared, and an entire sentence criticising the hypocrisy of wealthy pro-China businessmen, the so-called [...] "red fat cats" [...] was deleted.|$|E
