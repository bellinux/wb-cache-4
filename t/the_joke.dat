The group sets out for D.C. with Cleveland in tow. They are attacked by a black car, whose occupants fire guns at them {{to prevent them from}} learning the joke's origin. Joe shoots out one of the car's tires, causing it to spin out of control and flip onto its roof. The Quahog group arrive at a Washington hotel and locate Sal, who is reluctant to reveal the source of <b>the</b> <b>joke.</b> He races away on a handcart through Washington. Losing track of Sal, they are soon captured by several men in black suits who pistol-whip them until they are unconscious.|$|E

5|$|Sheng Long is a {{character}} hoax related to the Street Fighter series, created by Electronic Gaming Monthly (EGM) as an April Fools' prank in 1992 (in an issue published mid-February). <b>The</b> <b>joke,</b> based upon a mistranslation that suggested the existence of {{a character}} named Sheng Long in the Capcom fighting game Street Fighter II, described a method to fight the character in the game. After other publications reprinted the details as fact without verifying the authenticity, the Sheng Long hoax spread worldwide. As a result of discussion revolving around the possibility of the character's appearance in Street Fighter III during the game's development, EGM revisited <b>the</b> <b>joke</b> in 1997, printing an updated version of the hoax for the title while establishing a backstory and appearance for the character in the process.|$|E

5|$|An {{exploding}} cigar is {{a variety}} of cigar that explodes shortly after being lit.

5|$|As the game's {{dialogue}} {{consists of}} a lot of wordplay and misunderstandings, Smith would analyze scenes before writing them: he would see what the scenes were trying to accomplish, and where the beats in them were. After he had the structure of a scene in his head, he would write it; at times he was able {{to make use of the}} original Japanese dialogue, but most of the time he had to come up with new ideas himself. At several points, the English wordplay was inspired by the wordplay in the Japanese version. At some points, it was not possible to do wordplay in the same places as in the Japanese version, so Smith would change the structure of the scene slightly. At other points, Smith came up with a joke or funny line, and changed the scene to make <b>the</b> <b>joke</b> work. Around half of the jokes were rewritten based on the characters present in the scene, rather than being translations of the Japanese jokes.|$|E

5|$|For the game's localization, {{the main}} focus {{was to keep the}} {{dialogue}} natural and accessible to Western players, while also staying true to the Japanese version. The Japanese version had several instances of puns or cultural jokes, which would not have worked if they had been translated literally. There were also places in the script where the development team would have liked to insert jokes in the localization, but thought that it may be inappropriate to do so since <b>the</b> <b>joke</b> was not in the Japanese version.
