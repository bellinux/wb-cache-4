5|$|Although such a {{long-range}} {{attack on a}} state far from {{the centre of the}} Empire may seem extraordinary (the last time the Empire had attempted anything on this scale was the failed invasion of Sicily over one hundred and twenty years earlier), it can be explained in terms of Manuel's foreign policy, which was to use the Latins to ensure the survival of the Empire. This focus on <b>the</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>picture</b> of the eastern Mediterranean and even further afield thus led Manuel to intervene in Egypt: it was believed that {{in the context of the}} wider struggle between the crusader states and the Islamic powers of the east, control of Egypt would be the deciding factor. It had become clear that the ailing Fatimid Caliphate of Egypt held the key to the fate of the crusader states. If Egypt came out of its isolation and joined forces with the Muslims under Nur ad-Din, the crusader cause was in trouble.|$|E

25|$|Not surprisingly, the northeast's two {{dominant}} {{programs are}} also frequent factors in <b>the</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>picture.</b> The programs rank first (UMass, 14) and fourth (URI, 12) nationally {{in the number}} of ACHA National Tournament appearances. Since 2002–03, one of the two has been among the ACHA's final four to end 12 of 15 seasons (2008–09, 2014–15 and 2015–16 are the exceptions). Somewhat surprisingly, given all of that, UMass has only run into Rhode Island five times at nationals, and only three times with something other than bragging rights attached (two meetings, both URI wins, were the 2008 third-place game and a 2016 pool round meeting after both teams had already been eliminated). In 2007, the Rams edged UMass 1–0 at the Mullins Center to end the bottom-seeded Minutemen's chances in the quarterfinals. A 2012 pool round game ended in a 1–1 tie as Sarah Oteri and Johanna Leskinen traded goals while Chelsea Corell and Kayla DiLorenzo traded saves, although the Minutemen ultimately advanced to the tournament semifinals ahead of Rhode Island. In 2014, the biggest game of the group took place, in the national semifinals. Corell and DiLorenzo (both of whom ended the year among the national top five in goals against average, save percentage and shutouts) engaged in another goaltending duel, but first-period markers from Caleigh Labossiere and Raschelle Bräm proved decisive in a 2–1 UMass victory.|$|E
500|$|The book uses {{analogy to}} explain {{molecular}} phenomena.

500|$|Attention also {{focused on}} Jaguar's {{improved}} pace during the event. Prior to the race, {{the team had}} been criticised by the media {{for their ability to}} perform well in the series with some publications criticising their move of signing Evans and Carroll to drive their cars.

Qualifying was great, to be honest, I topped the group. If you ask me or the whole team if this would have happened after Marrakesh, we would have taken it with both hands." [...] Carroll hoped he would have a strong performance in the event and be faster than he could be but it was an issue that could be improved on. Jaguar team principal James Barclay stated the improvement was [...] "a little bit of a positive surprise" [...] but was unsure if Carroll's problem {{at the start of the}} race was caused by driver error or an electrical issue but admitted his team had to improve their understanding of full course yellow in future races.|$|E

500|$|Following {{the success}} of the band's {{previous}} albums Almost There and Spoken For, MercyMe was given [...] "significantly" [...] more resources to develop their next record by their record label, INO Records. Although they decided not to alter their Christian approach to songwriting, live performances, and interviews, they opted to work with outside songwriters on the album, employed the London Symphony Orchestra to play strings on several tracks, and added a sixth member to the band, guitarist Barry Graul. Additionally, MercyMe wrote and recorded the music for Undone before they wrote any of the lyrics. Lead singer Bart Millard noted that by using this method, instead of his lyrics swaying the musical elements of the song, the music acted as [...] "a canvas with which to write [...] ". He elaborated that [...] "We’ve been making records for 10 years, so anything that sparks creativity... is very much welcomed". The title of the album was inspired by [...] "the unexpected twists and turns in the band's journey"; Millard commented that [...] "We had our plans for {{what we were going to}} do; but when <b>the</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>picture</b> happened, all of our plans came unraveled. We don’t know what tomorrow will hold. When you make your own plans, you suddenly find yourself undone; and that’s exactly where God wants us in the first place".|$|E

2500|$|The Process Work {{approach}} to leadership and conflict facilitation {{is based on}} the idea of deep democracy; it tries to build awareness of <b>the</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>picture</b> and develop compassion for all sides in a conflict, an approach that Mindell refers to as 'eldership'. Process oriented psychology is known for a positive model of conflict, seeing it as an opportunity for growth and community; Mindell, like the authors Thomas Crum and Danaan Parry, suggests that dealing with personal conflicts better can create global change. [...] The model of conflict resolution involves identifying the sides in the conflict as roles and having the conflicting parties experiment with expressing all roles, swapping sides until greater understanding is achieved. [...] Conflict is understood as a sign that at least one viewpoint or experience within the group is not being adequately represented and Process Work aims to bring these 'ghosts' into conscious awareness and dialogue.|$|E
