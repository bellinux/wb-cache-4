5|$|Apollo 11 {{landed with}} less fuel than other missions, and the astronauts {{encountered}} a premature low fuel warning. This was later {{found to be}} the result of greater propellant 'slosh' than expected, uncovering a fuel sensor.

5|$|As {{part of the}} Pacts of May, {{which ended}} the near-war {{tensions}} between Argentina and Chile, Argentina sold its two armored cruisers, Rivadavia and Moreno, that were under construction in Italy to Japan. Constitución and Libertad were put up for sale in early 1903. While the United Kingdom was not entirely interested in the ships, international politics took precedence: when the Russian Empire made an offer for the ships, the British grew concerned that the Swiftsure class could be used against their new ally Japan. <b>To</b> <b>prevent</b> <b>this,</b> the British purchased both Chilean battleships on 3 December 1903 for £2,432,000.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from its}} {{unstable}} position, Halos {{would have to}} contend with thousands of meteor and micrometeor impacts which would destabilize or destroy the ring; there is no evidence in the games that the installations project an energy shield <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> <b>this</b> occurrence. Because of the magnetic environment around the gas giant, a Halo would be exposed to high levels of radiation. Earth is protected from such radiation by charged particles created by the planet's magnetic field. Grazier posits that huge conductive cables could run the circumference of a Halo; when an electric current was run through these cables, a protective magnetic environment could be created to sustain life.|$|E

5|$|Carriage and {{shipment}} of {{some kinds of}} lithium batteries may be prohibited aboard certain types of transportation (particularly aircraft) because of the ability of most types of lithium batteries to fully discharge very rapidly when short-circuited, leading to overheating and possible explosion in a process called thermal runaway. Most consumer lithium batteries have built-in thermal overload protection <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> <b>this</b> type of incident, or are otherwise designed to limit short-circuit currents. Internal shorts from manufacturing defect or physical damage can lead to spontaneous thermal runaway.|$|E
5|$|Females are {{generally}} attracted to males by their calls, though in nonstridulatory species, some other mechanism must be involved. After the pair has made antennal contact, a courtship period may occur {{during which the}} character of the call changes. The female mounts the male and a single spermatophore is transferred to the external genitalia of the female. Sperm flows from this into the female's oviduct over a period of a few minutes or up to an hour, depending on species. After copulation, the female may remove or eat the spermatophore; males may attempt <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> <b>this</b> with various ritualised behaviours. The female may mate on several occasions with different males.|$|E
5|$|Finally, the King {{arranged}} for Stephen to marry Matilda in 1125, the daughter and only heiress of the Count of Boulogne, who owned both the important continental port of Boulogne and vast estates in the north-west and south-east of England. In 1127, William Clito, a potential claimant to the English throne, seemed {{likely to become}} the Count of Flanders; Stephen was sent by the King on a mission <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> <b>this,</b> and {{in the aftermath of}} his successful election, William Clito attacked Stephen's lands in neighbouring Boulogne in retaliation. Eventually a truce was declared, and William Clito died the following year.|$|E

5|$|Following the arming of the Italian ironclads Duilio and Dandolo with 100-ton guns, the British feared an Italian {{attack on}} Malta, as the ships could fire on Malta's batteries, {{destroying}} them {{one after the}} other, while keeping outside their guns' range. <b>To</b> <b>prevent</b> <b>this,</b> the British requested that four 100-ton guns be built. Two of these were installed in Malta, and Cambridge Battery and Rinella Battery were built specifically to house these guns. Construction of the batteries began in 1878 and they were complete by 1886. The gun at Rinella still exists.|$|E
