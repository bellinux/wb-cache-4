A two disc edition was {{released}} <b>that</b> <b>contained</b> 30 tracks heard in the game, and a deluxe edition was released <b>that</b> <b>contained</b> 15 extra tracks. The album was released just before the release of the game, and received positive reviews. Particular praise was directed towards the usage of traditional Nepalese instruments which, combined with electronic samples, suggested high octane action and mystical wondering.|$|E

50|$|Proof: (a) For {{each pair}} of {{distinct}} points, there is one line <b>that</b> <b>contains</b> both of them, lines <b>that</b> <b>contain</b> only one of them, and lines <b>that</b> <b>contain</b> none of them, so every set of size 2 is shattered. (b) For any triple of three distinct points, {{if there is a}} line x <b>that</b> <b>contain</b> all three, then there is no line y <b>that</b> <b>contains</b> exactly two (since then x and y would intersect in two points, which is contrary to the definition of a projective plane). Hence, no set of size 3 is shattered.|$|R

5|$|A Viking funeral {{could be}} a {{considerable}} expense, but the barrow and the grave goods were not considered to have been wasted. In {{addition to being a}} homage to the deceased, the barrow remained as a monument to the social position of the descendants. Especially powerful Norse clans could demonstrate their position through monumental grave fields. The Borre mound cemetery in Vestfold is for instance connected to the Yngling dynasty, and it had large tumuli <b>that</b> <b>contained</b> stone ships.|$|E
5|$|A large alcove {{close by}} in the garden, entered through a portal of grey Sussex marble, formed an amphitheatre <b>that</b> <b>contained</b> an effigy {{representing}} Truth crushing a mask, again probably the work of Roubiliac.

5|$|A warrant {{was sworn}} out for Waring's arrest, but {{officials}} {{soon learned that}} he was incapacitated, after being shot through both hips the day before Sharp's death. When Darby discovered that he was under suspicion, he began his own investigation into the murder. He traveled to Simpson County where he met Captain John F.

He also furnished Darby with a letter <b>that</b> <b>contained</b> damaging admissions against Beauchamp.|$|E
5|$|As a ceratopsid, Achelousaurus {{would have}} been a quadrupedal animal with hoofed digits and a shortened, {{downwards}} swept tail. Its very large head, which would have rested on a straight neck, had a hooked upper beak, very large nasal openings and long tooth rows developed into dental batteries <b>that</b> <b>contained</b> hundreds of appressed and stacked individual teeth. In the tooth sockets, new teeth grew under the old ones, each position housing a column of teeth posed on top of each other. Achelousaurus had 25 to 28 such tooth positions in each maxilla (upper jaw bone).|$|E

5|$|Extending this work, Nirenberg and Philip Leder {{revealed}} the code's triplet nature and deciphered its codons. In these experiments, various combinations of mRNA were {{passed through a}} filter <b>that</b> <b>contained</b> ribosomes, the components of cells that translate RNA into protein. Unique triplets promoted the binding of specific tRNAs to the ribosome. Leder and Nirenberg were able to determine the sequences of 54 out of 64 codons in their experiments. Khorana, Holley and Nirenberg received the 1968 Nobel for their work.|$|E
