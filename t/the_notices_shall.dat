50|$|There are {{two ways}} for the {{employee}} to terminate the employment contract - through a proper <b>notice</b> that <b>shall</b> be given within the specified period, and extraordinary notice. In both cases this is a subjective right of the worker. According to Art. 326(2) of the Labour Code, <b>the</b> <b>notice</b> period varies {{depending on whether the}} working contract is permanent and temporary. In case of a permanent contract, the law in Bulgaria provides for a notice period of 30 days, as long as the parties have not previously agreed on a longer period (that shall not exceed 3 months). <b>The</b> minimum <b>notice</b> period for temporary contract termination is 3 months. In accordance with Art. 326(4) of the Labour Code <b>the</b> termination <b>notice</b> may be revoked by the employee simultaneously or prior to its receipt by the employer. Afterwards, a notice may be withdrawn by the end of <b>the</b> <b>notice</b> period with <b>the</b> consent of the employer (Art. 326(4) LC). It is possible for employees in Bulgaria to terminate the employment contract without notice as well, but only for a particular reason, as provided in Art.327 of the Labour Code. The most significant ground therein is a scenario where the employer is reluctant to pay the employee his due remuneration. Under the applicable labour law provisions even a delay of one day is sufficient for the employee to unilaterally terminate the employment relationship without complying with <b>the</b> usual <b>notice</b> periods.|$|R
