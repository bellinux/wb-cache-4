5|$|The common {{blackbird}} is omnivorous, {{eating a}} wide range of insects, earthworms, seeds and berries. It feeds mainly on <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> <b>running</b> and hopping with a start-stop-start progress. It pulls earthworms from the soil, usually finding them by sight, but sometimes by hearing, and roots through leaf litter for other invertebrates. Small amphibians and lizards are occasionally hunted. This species will also perch in bushes to take berries and collect caterpillars and other active insects. Animal prey predominates, and is particularly important during the breeding season, with windfall apples and berries taken more in the autumn and winter. The nature of the fruit taken depends on what is locally available, and frequently includes exotics in gardens.|$|E
5|$|With {{the clear}} {{goal of a}} manned landing {{replacing}} the more nebulous goals of space stations and cislunar flights, NASA had to hit <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>running,</b> and decided to discard the feasibility study designs of Convair, GE, and Martin, and proceed with Faget's command / service module design. The mission module {{was determined to be}} only useful as an extra room, and therefore deemed unnecessary. They used Faget's design as the specification for another competition for spacecraft procurement bids in October 1961. On November 28, 1961, it was announced that North American Aviation had won the contract, although its bid was not rated as good as Martin's. Webb, Dryden and Robert Seamans chose it in preference due to North American's longer association with NACA.|$|E

50|$|At each substation, utility {{supplied}} {{single phase}} power is transformed and {{injected into the}} two electrical sections terminating at that substation. There are eight electrical sections in the system, two for each substation. The substations drive the contact and feed wires in a split phase arrangement so that each wire is at 25 kV with respect to <b>the</b> <b>grounded</b> <b>running</b> rails with 50 kV between them.|$|R
25|$|In 1986 Foster was claimed off waivers by the Chicago White Sox, and hit <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>running</b> {{with his}} new club. In his first game, he went two-for-four with a home run. From there, his game declined, and Foster was {{released}} on September 7 after fifteen games {{with his new}} club. When the Mets won the World Series in , they awarded Foster a World Series ring and a three-quarters share as a team member {{for part of the}} season. He attempted to sign with a new club in , but was unsuccessful.|$|E

Bills quarterback Jim Kelly threw for 300 yards and two touchdowns to wide receiver James Lofton, who finished the game with five receptions for 113 yards. Thomas recorded a 12-yard touchdown run, while Davis scored from one yard, three yards, and one yard out. Linebacker Darryl Talley returned one of his two interceptions 27 yards for a touchdown.|$|E

25|$|The Siemens-Schuckert R.VIII was a bomber {{aircraft}} {{designed and}} built in Germany from 1916. Having built the Steffen R series, Siemens-Schuckert planned to produce a six engined Riesenflugzeug (giant aeroplane) for the Fliegertruppen des deutschen Kaiserreiches (Imperial German Flying Corps). In common {{with many of the}} other contemporary R projects, the R.VIII had all six engines inside the fuselage, where they were tended by mechanics, driving two tractor and two pusher propellers mounted between the mainplanes, via leather cone clutches combining gearboxes, shafts and bevel gearboxes. Two aircraft were built but only the first, R23/16, was completed. Ground trials began in 1919, after the armistice but were interrupted by a gearbox failure which resulted in a propeller breaking up and causing extensive damage. The second airframe, R24/16, was never completed and the first was not repaired after <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>running</b> accident due to the restrictions of the Treaty of Versailles. At the time of its completion the Siemens-Schuckert R.VIII was the largest aeroplane in the world; (the Mannesman-Poll triplane was to have been much larger but was not completed before the Versailles Treaty came into force).|$|E
500|$|The Trojans defense {{dominated}} the Bruins in a 24–7 victory before a sold-out Coliseum crowd.

500|$|McEwen then sought {{election}} to the House in the Second District near Cincinnati, immediately west of his former district, and which contained some territory he represented in the 1980s. The election was to fill the vacancy caused by Willis D. Gradison's resignation to become a lobbyist for the insurance industry on January 31, 1993, three months after his re-election. [...] "It's important {{that we have an}} experienced person to fight for jobs for Southwest Ohio. We need to bring economic growth to our area," [...] McEwen said. [...] "It's important that we have someone who can hit <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>running,</b> representing our values of economic growth and low taxes." [...] Though a congressman does not need to live in the district he represents, McEwen put his home in Hillsboro up for sale and rented a home in Bethel in Clermont County.|$|E
50|$|Trolls {{initially}} seem to {{be somewhat}} shorter, due to their sagging shoulders and tendency to hunch forward. They walk with an uneven gait, and their arms dangle and drag <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> when <b>running.</b> Despite this apparent awkwardness, trolls are quite agile.|$|R

500|$|Myrie-Williams joined Port Vale on a free {{transfer}} on 2 July 2012, {{signing a}} two-year contract after having impressed during his brief loan spell {{at the club}} during the 2011–12 season. He hit <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>running</b> at Vale Park, {{and put in a}} particularly strong performance against League One leaders Tranmere Rovers in the Football League Trophy First Round, as he [...] "tormented" [...] full-back Zoumana Bakayogo, and claimed both goals of a 2–0 win with a penalty and a 30-yard free-kick he described as [...] "up there with the best goals I've scored". As the 2012–13 season drew to a close, League Two managers voted him the fifth best player of the season at the annual Football League Awards. Vale secured promotion with a third-place finish {{at the end of the}} season, and Myrie-Williams finished with nine assists and 11 goals in 50 games. He was voted onto the PFA Team of the Year, alongside teammate Tom Pope.|$|E

2500|$|In {{his second}} season, a batting slot opened {{up in the}} Baldry Badgers {{starting}} 11, {{at the top of}} the order. Boteju hit <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>running.</b> In his first game, he played a cool and calm innings scoring 80* chasing down a 200+ target. As the season progressed his aggression came to the forefront with indiscriminate battering of bowlers in every game of the season. A testament to this extraordinary season can be reflected in the fact that his lowest score was 50.|$|E

2500|$|Empire Earth {{averaged}} an 82% {{according to}} GameRankings, and earned GameSpy's 2001 [...] "PC Game of the Year" [...] award. It was rated 8.5/10 by IGN, who commented [...] "Anyone who's familiar with Age of Empires {{is going to}} hit <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>running</b> in Empire Earth. With a few additions and some small changes the economic model and interface is pretty much exactly like that in AoE2." [...] GameSpot was not as impressed, giving it 7.9/10, saying [...] "Empire Earth is best reserved for hard-core real-time strategy players who won't mind the game's less-than-stellar graphics and sound but will instead relish the ability to relive 14 different epochs of human warfare.". Game Informer was disappointed {{and gave it a}} 6.25/10, saying [...] "Empire Earth couldn't walk the walk like it talked the talk. Although no one patch can fix either of the aforementioned items, the latter will certainly see some type of quick adjustment in the near future." ...|$|E

5000|$|Sean McKenna from TV Fanatic, gave a 4.5 {{star rating}} out of 5, stating: [...] "That said, I'm {{thoroughly}} invested {{again in the}} series, the possibilities seem exciting, {{and the way the}} focus really locked in on the characters is always a plus. Especially, seeing as the changes to them and their world are dramatically different from when Sam and Dean first started their journey in the pilot.

5000|$|Lucius Glau, {{a servant}} of Madrigal Raith's in Proven Guilty, was said by Thomas {{to be the}} scion of a djinn.

2500|$|The series {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} critics. Anime News Network's Nick Creamer gave a series a 4 out 5 stars, saying that [...] "After watching {{half a dozen}} premiers that just wouldn't stop with the exposition, it sure is nice to watch a show that actually has confidence in its own storytelling. Iron-Blooded Orphans hits <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>running,</b> establishing its world in the natural conversations of its many characters." [...] He criticized that [...] "Mari Okada's an inconsistent writer, but definitely a talented one, and given {{the focus of a}} traditional Gundam-style opening, her gift for illustrating character shines through." [...] Zac Bertschy gave the series a 4.5 for the first episode, saying [...] "Iron-Blooded Orphans has a lot of moving parts, but it's only deceptively complex; this episode starts out confusing (due to the relatively haphazard way they introduce all the various factions and the sizable cast) but as it goes on it all becomes very clear". He also adds [...] "Instantly likable characters, desperate battles, a broad science fiction story about a colony struggling for independence, giant robots and even a Char-like smooth-talking pretty boy weirdo who's working with the bad guys; what's not to love?" ...|$|E
2500|$|In the 13th century, {{a curtain}} wall or wall of enceinte was {{constructed}} around the island, enclosing {{most of the}} area above the high tide line.

The eastern and southern segments of this wall are largely obscured by later development, although the enclosure is assumed to have contained an area of around [...] At the northern point of the wall the foundations of a large tower survive, measuring around [...] and the remains of foundations suggest further towers at the north-east and south-west corners of the enclosure. The enclosure was accessed via a sea-gate in the north-west curtain wall, where a small beach would have allowed boats to be drawn up. Another beach to the south-west may have formed a second access. Archaeological excavations in 2008 and 2009 confirmed the presence of these walls, and also found evidence that metalworking was taking place {{in the northern part of}} the castle. A tower house or keep was built against the curtain wall at the high point of the island, probably in the 14th century. The tower measured , with walls [...] thick. The vaulted ground floor was originally divided in two, with a stair in the north wall giving access to the first-floor hall. Above this were probably another two storeys, including a garret. The tower, according to Petit's later drawing, was topped by crowstep gables, and surrounded by a walkway and bartizans (small turrets) at the corners.|$|E
