Somes species, such as S. eglandulosum, {{can even be}} found in disturbed areas like near roads and under powerlines. Others (i.e. S. coroniforme) are sensitive to disturbance and are considered rare because of their extremely specific habitat.|$|E
25|$|If {{an article}} about a poll does not report <b>the</b> <b>margin</b> <b>of</b> error, but does state that a simple random sample of a certain size was used, <b>the</b> <b>margin</b> <b>of</b> error can be {{calculated}} for a desired degree of confidence {{using one of the}} above formulae. Also, if <b>the</b> 95% <b>margin</b> <b>of</b> error is given, one can find <b>the</b> 99% <b>margin</b> <b>of</b> error by increasing <b>the</b> reported <b>margin</b> <b>of</b> error by about 30%.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>margin</b> <b>of</b> error for a {{particular}} individual percentage will usually be smaller than <b>the</b> maximum <b>margin</b> <b>of</b> error quoted for the survey. This maximum only applies when the observed percentage is 50%, and <b>the</b> <b>margin</b> <b>of</b> error shrinks as the percentage approaches the extremes of 0% or 100%.|$|R
40|$|Efficient post-election audits {{select the}} number of {{machines}} or precincts to audit {{based in part on}} <b>the</b> <b>margin</b> <b>of</b> victory (<b>the</b> number of ballots that must be changed in order to change the outcome); a close election needs more auditing than a landslide victory. For a simple “first-pastthe-post” election, <b>the</b> <b>margin</b> is easily computed based on {{the number of}} votes the first and second place candidates received. However, for instant runoff voting (IRV) elections, it is not immediately obvious how to compute <b>the</b> <b>margin</b> <b>of</b> victory. This paper presents algorithmic techniques for computing <b>the</b> <b>margin</b> <b>of</b> victory for IRV elections. We evaluate our method by attempting to compute <b>the</b> <b>margin</b> <b>of</b> victory for 25 IRV elections in the United States. <b>The</b> <b>margin</b> <b>of</b> victory computed can then be used to conduct post-election audits more effectively for IRV elections. ...|$|R

5|$|The species favours lowland {{areas that}} are {{seasonally}} wet but never inundated, such as <b>the</b> <b>margins</b> <b>of</b> swamps and marshes. For example, in the Yule Brook Botany Reserve, where parallel sand ridges cross a clay flat, B.telmatiaea occurs neither in the lowest parts of the flat, where seasonal inundation occurs; nor {{on the tops of}} the ridges, where the drainage is good; but {{it is one of the}} most abundant plants of intermediate habitats, on ridge slopes and in higher areas of the clay flat.|$|E
5|$|The thorax {{is divided}} into two groups of somites. The {{anterior}} group is composed of four somites, each with well-developed walking limbs with lengths that extend past <b>the</b> <b>margins</b> <b>of</b> the carapace. Their morphological details are not well preserved but their distal segments appear to possess a multitude of small spines. It is unknown if these limbs are biramous, but they are assumed to be the endopodites, the inner branches (ramus) of the leg, with the exopodites, or outer branches, absent or not preserved.|$|E

25|$|To {{adjust for}} a large {{sampling}} fraction, the fpc factored into <b>the</b> calculation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>margin</b> <b>of</b> error, which has the effect <b>of</b> narrowing <b>the</b> <b>margin</b> <b>of</b> error. It holds that the fpc approaches zero as the sample size (n) approaches the population size (N), which has the effect <b>of</b> eliminating <b>the</b> <b>margin</b> <b>of</b> error entirely. This makes intuitive sense because when N = n, the sample becomes a census and sampling error becomes moot.|$|R

5|$|This {{episode is}} the forty-ninth from the fifth season of Adventure Time. Visually, the episode is framed having the {{important}} {{events of the}} story occur in its center, bordered circularly. Small polygonal creatures appear in <b>the</b> <b>margins</b> <b>of</b> the outer frame. Film and television critic Eric Kohn, in IndieWire, dubbed the inner frame a time bubble, absorbing the creatures Bubblegum experiments on with the time travel device. Following Lumpy having her memory erased in the episode, Johnnie appears in the outer frame.|$|E
5|$|While {{studying}} the Clarke Codex of Plato's dialogues at Oxford, Martin Schanz noticed that isolated letters in <b>the</b> <b>margins</b> <b>of</b> two dialogues formed an alphabetic series and marked every hundredth standard line (alpha = 100, beta = 200, etc.). He {{was able to}} show that other manuscripts had similar marginal markings. His 1881 article named this kind of line-counting 'partial stichometry' and contrasted it to 'total stichometry' studied by Graux.|$|E
5|$|Both {{the frames}} and {{pictorial}} {{areas of the}} diptych are heavily inscribed with lettering and phrases in Latin, Greek and Hebrew. Van Eyck's early works display a predilection for inscriptions, which serve a dual purpose. They are decorative while also functioning {{in a manner similar}} to the commentaries often seen on <b>the</b> <b>margins</b> <b>of</b> medieval manuscripts which set in context the significance of the accompanying imagery. Diptychs were usually commissioned for private devotion, and van Eyck would have expected the viewer to contemplate text and imagery in unison.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{its high}} level of {{nutrient}} requirements, cabbage is prone to nutrient deficiencies, including boron, calcium, phosphorus and potassium. There are several physiological disorders that can affect the postharvest appearance of cabbage. Internal tip burn occurs when <b>the</b> <b>margins</b> <b>of</b> inside leaves turn brown, but the outer leaves look normal. Necrotic spot is where there are oval sunken spots a few millimeters across that are often grouped around the midrib. In pepper spot, tiny black spots occur on the areas between the veins, which can increase during storage.|$|E
5|$|For {{some time}} afterwards, his main {{literary}} output was his voluminous correspondence with his disciples. His letters, {{most of which}} were written in the 1930s, numbered in the several thousands. Many were brief comments made in <b>the</b> <b>margins</b> <b>of</b> his disciple's notebooks in answer to their questions and reports of their spiritual practice—others extended to several pages of carefully composed explanations of practical aspects of his teachings. These were later collected and published in book form in three volumes of Letters on Yoga. In the late 1930s, he resumed work on a poem he had started earlier—he continued to expand and revise this poem {{for the rest of his}} life. It became perhaps his greatest literary achievement, Savitri, an epic spiritual poem in blank verse of approximately 24,000 lines.|$|E
5|$|In {{most cases}} of early-stage NSCLC, {{removal of a}} lobe of lung (lobectomy) is the {{surgical}} treatment of choice. In people who are unfit for a full lobectomy, a smaller sublobar excision (wedge resection) may be performed. However, wedge resection has {{a higher risk of}} recurrence than lobectomy. Radioactive iodine brachytherapy at <b>the</b> <b>margins</b> <b>of</b> wedge excision may reduce the risk of recurrence. Rarely, removal of a whole lung (pneumonectomy) is performed. Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) and VATS lobectomy use a minimally invasive approach to lung cancer surgery. VATS lobectomy is equally effective compared to conventional open lobectomy, with less postoperative illness.|$|E

5|$|Indraloris {{is known}} only from {{isolated}} teeth and {{fragments of the}} mandible. These show that Indraloris was a medium-sized sivaladapid, somewhat smaller than Sivaladapis. In 1982, Gingerich and colleagues estimated that Indraloris himalayensis may have weighed 3.7 to 4.3kg (8.2 to 9.5lb) {{on the basis of}} allometric scaling of tooth size; Flynn and Morgan estimated a body size of about 2kg (4.4lb) for I.kamlialensis. In general, the cingula (shelves) on <b>the</b> <b>margins</b> <b>of</b> the cheekteeth are weak in Indraloris. Among the two named species, I.kamlialensis is about 20% smaller than I.himalayensis. The unnamed large Indraloris is similar in size to I.himalayensis.|$|E
5|$|Known predators of the bluespotted ribbontail ray include {{hammerhead sharks}} (Sphyrna) and {{bottlenose}} dolphins (Tursiops); {{it is also}} potentially preyed upon by other large fishes and marine mammals. When threatened, this ray tends to flee at high speed in a zigzag pattern, to throw off pursuers. Numerous parasites have been identified from this species: the tapeworms Aberrapex manjajiae, Anthobothrium taeniuri, Cephalobothrium taeniurai, Echinobothrium elegans and E. helmymohamedi, Kotorelliella jonesi, Polypocephalus saoudi, and Rhinebothrium ghardaguensis and R. taeniuri, the monogeneans Decacotyle lymmae, Empruthotrema quindecima, Entobdella australis, and Pseudohexabothrium taeniurae, the flatworms Pedunculacetabulum ghardaguensis and Anaporrhutum albidum, the nematode Mawsonascaris australis, the copepod Sheina orri, and the protozoan Trypanosoma taeniurae.

5|$|The {{demographic}} {{growth that}} occurred in Sélestat after 1945 was primarily due to a relatively high birth rate (20.1‰ in Sélestat over the period 1968–1975, compared to 16.9‰ in France). After 1975, this rate progressively declined to match the national figure. Net migration figures remained slightly negative until 1990 because Sélestat and Central Alsace were on <b>the</b> <b>margins</b> <b>of</b> the metropolitan areas of Strasbourg and Colmar and lacked attractivity. Since 1990, the Strasbourg area greatly expanded to gradually reach Sélestat. The town has thus become more attractive to newcomers.|$|E
