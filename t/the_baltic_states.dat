5|$|Like the Stimson Doctrine, Welles' {{declaration}} {{was largely}} symbolic in nature, although it offered some material benefits {{in conjunction with}} Executive Order 8484. It enabled the diplomatic representatives of <b>the</b> <b>Baltic</b> <b>states</b> in various other countries to fund their operations and protected the ownership of ships flying Baltic flags. By establishing a non-recognition policy, it allowed some 120,000 postwar displaced persons from <b>the</b> <b>Baltic</b> <b>states</b> to avoid repatriation to the Soviet Union and advocate independence from abroad.|$|E

5|$|The U.S. {{position}} that <b>the</b> <b>Baltic</b> <b>states</b> had been forcibly annexed would remain its official stance {{for the following}} 51 years. Subsequent U.S. presidents and Congressional resolutions reaffirmed {{the substance of the}} Declaration. President Dwight D. Eisenhower asserted the right of <b>the</b> <b>Baltic</b> <b>states</b> to independence in an address to the United States Congress on January 6, 1957. After confirming the Helsinki Final Act in July 1975, the United States House of Representatives passed a resolution that the Final Act would not affect the continuity of U.S. recognition of the sovereignty of Baltic states.|$|E

5|$|The Welles Declaration {{established}} a five-decade non-recognition of the Baltic states' annexation. The document had major significance for overall U.S. policy toward Europe {{in the critical}} year of 1940. While the U.S. did not engage the Soviet Union militarily in the region, the Declaration enabled <b>the</b> <b>Baltic</b> <b>states</b> to maintain independent diplomatic missions, and Executive Order 8484 protected Baltic financial assets. Its essence was supported by all subsequent U.S. presidents and Congressional resolutions. <b>The</b> <b>Baltic</b> <b>states</b> re-established their independence in 1990–91.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} 1989, {{two years}} before the final {{collapse}} of the Soviet Union, the Congress of People's Deputies of the Soviet Union and Mikhail Gorbachev's government formally denounced the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, acknowledging that the bloody annexation of <b>the</b> <b>Baltic</b> <b>States</b> and the partition of Poland had been illegal.|$|E

5|$|The Soviet Union was {{responsible}} for the Katyn massacre of 22,000 Polish officers, and the imprisonment or execution of thousands of political prisoners by the NKVD, in <b>the</b> <b>Baltic</b> <b>states,</b> and eastern Poland annexed by the Red Army.|$|E
5|$|Russian Tsar Peter the Great had {{established}} a new capital and powerful naval base in Saint Petersburg in 1703. Russian naval power in the Baltic grew to challenge the interests of Sweden, the other leading power in the Baltic. Swedish holdings at that time included territory in Northern Germany, all of modern Finland and most of <b>the</b> <b>Baltic</b> <b>states,</b> a dominion depending on, and connected by, the Baltic Sea trade routes. During the Great Northern War (1700–1721), Sweden lost all its territories in <b>the</b> <b>Baltic</b> <b>states</b> and suffered Russian raids in Finland and along the chain of islands and archipelagos stretching from the Gulf of Finland to Stockholm. The Swedes began to deploy inshore flotillas of shallow-draft vessels, beginning with smaller versions of the traditional Mediterranean galleys. Most of these new vessels were more akin to galiots and were complemented with gun prams. The disastrous war with Russia (1741–43) and the minor involvement against Prussia in the Seven Years' War (1757–62) showed {{the need for further}} expansion and development of the inshore flotillas with more specialized vessels.|$|E

5|$|Speaking at a Chautauqua {{conference in}} Jūrmala, Latvia in June 1986, Matlock {{told the crowd}} that the United States did not {{recognize}} the incorporation of <b>the</b> <b>Baltic</b> <b>States</b> into the Soviet Union.

5|$|The Germans reaffirmed their {{alliance}} with Italy and signed non-aggression pacts with Denmark, Estonia and Latvia whilst trade links were formalised with Romania, Norway and Sweden. Hitler's foreign minister Joachim von Ribbentrop arranged {{in negotiations with}} the Soviet Union a non-aggression pact, the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, which was signed in August 1939. The treaty also contained secret protocols dividing Poland and <b>the</b> <b>Baltic</b> <b>states</b> into German and Soviet spheres of influence.|$|E
5|$|The Welles Declaration linked U.S. {{policy towards}} <b>the</b> <b>Baltic</b> <b>states</b> with the Stimson Doctrine, {{which did not}} {{recognize}} Japanese, German and Italian occupations during the 1930s. It broke with Wilsonian policies that had supported a strong Russian presence as a counterweight to German power.

5|$|In the {{immediate}} aftermath of the Pact, the Scandinavian countries and Finland were relieved. The Germans and Soviets were now allies, and there was no German threat against the Soviet Union. But shortly afterwards, Germany invaded Poland and Great Britain and France declared war against Germany. Next, the Soviets invaded eastern Poland, and later Moscow requested that <b>the</b> <b>Baltic</b> <b>states</b> allow the establishment of Soviet military bases and the stationing of troops on their soil. The government of Estonia accepted the ultimatum, signing the corresponding agreement in September, while Latvia and Lithuania followed suit in October.|$|E
5|$|Methods of {{destroying}} suspected vampires varied, with staking {{the most commonly}} cited method, particularly in southern Slavic cultures. Ash was the preferred wood in Russia and <b>the</b> <b>Baltic</b> <b>states,</b> or hawthorn in Serbia, {{with a record of}} oak in Silesia. Aspen was also used for stakes, as it was believed that Christ's cross was made from aspen (aspen branches on the graves of purported vampires were also believed to prevent their risings at night). Potential vampires were most often staked through the heart, though the mouth was targeted in Russia and northern Germany and the stomach in north-eastern Serbia.|$|E
5|$|On July 26, 1983, on the 61st {{anniversary of}} de jure {{recognition}} of the three Baltic countries by the U.S. in 1922, President Ronald Reagan re-declared the United States' recognition of the independence of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. The declaration was read in the United Nations as well. Throughout the 51 years that followed the events of 1940, all U.S. official maps and publications that mentioned <b>the</b> <b>Baltic</b> <b>states</b> included a statement of U.S. non-recognition of Soviet occupation.|$|E

5|$|Such {{extensive}} and enthusiastic {{collaboration with the}} Einsatzgruppen {{has been attributed to}} several factors. Since the Russian Revolution of 1905, the Kresy Wschodnie and other borderlands had experienced a political culture of violence. The period of Soviet rule had been profoundly traumatic for residents of <b>the</b> <b>Baltic</b> <b>states</b> and areas that had been part of Poland until 1939; the population was brutalised and terrorised by the imposed Soviet rule, and the existing familiar structures of society were destroyed.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} part of the agreement was the secret protocol, which provided for the partition of Poland, Finland, and <b>the</b> <b>Baltic</b> <b>States</b> between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union and for the Soviet annexation of Bessarabia (then part of Romania, now Moldova). This protocol gave Hitler the green light for his invasion of Poland, which began on 1 September. On 5 March 1940 Lavrentiy Beria gave Molotov, along with Anastas Mikoyan, Kliment Voroshilov and Stalin, a note ordering the execution of 25,700 Polish officers and anti-Soviets, in what has become known as the Katyn massacre.|$|E
