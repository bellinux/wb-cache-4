5|$|Hillsboro's Civic Center is {{a modern}} glass {{building}} with a stone base and brick highlights. There are two main buildings, the Civic Center housing government offices and the Plaza Building housing retail space. The plazas surrounding the structures contain an inlaid quartzite river, basalt planters, and Victorian style benches. Additionally, it was designed with large windows facing the north in order to reflect the giant sequoia trees located across <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Washington County Courthouse, with the trees {{dating back to the}} 1880s.|$|E
5|$|Madison Avenue {{is part of}} the {{cross-country}} US Route 20, and at four lanes wide it is {{the busiest}} street in the district. Roughly 90 buildings on Madison Avenue face the park. East of the intersection with Robin Street, Madison is more urban with 19th-century rowhouses; west of Robin Street is dominated by large detached residences, many of which have been converted to medical offices. A few buildings, such as 694 and 710 Madison predate park improvements that occurred across <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Taylor property, which later became basketball and tennis courts. 682 Madison was formerly the home of the Academy of Holy Names. It is currently administrative offices for the Albany Medical Center Annex.|$|E
5|$|In 1732, John Strachan built Redland Court for John Cossins. It now forms {{one of the}} {{buildings}} making up Redland High School for Girls. In 1760, the Bristol Bridge Act was carried through parliament by the Bristol MP Sir Jarrit Smyth. That led to the demolition of St Nicholas's Gate, along with the original St Nicholas church, part of the Old Shambles, and thirty houses that stood on the old bridge. The original bridge was a medieval wooden structure, lined with houses on both sides. A 17th-century illustration shows that these were five stories high, including the attic rooms, and that they overhung the river much as Tudor houses would overhang <b>the</b> <b>street.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> time of the Civil War the bridge was noted for its community of goldsmiths, {{who may have been}} attracted by the unusually secure premises. The current St Nicholas church was rebuilt in 1762–9 by James Bridges and Thomas Paty, who rebuilt the spire. Part of the old church and town wall survives in the 14th century crypt.|$|E

25|$|Sculptor Brenda Putnam {{was hired}} in May 1930 to design a {{sculpture}} of Puck for a garden {{on the west side}} of the building. Decades of exposure weakened the statue, and after Puck's right hand was found across <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Library of Congress in 2000, the original piece was moved. It now sits above the entrance to the Elizabethan Theatre, and an aluminum statue replaced the original in the garden.|$|E
25|$|During construction, {{there was}} also {{controversy}} about the unused land between the new roadway and the old one, since Geneva didn't own all of the property. Geneva wanted the state to give the land the college didn't own for free. However, the state refused, but later sold the land (as well as the former Route 18 alignment, which became a private access road for the university) to Geneva. After construction of the new right-of-way was complete and opened, Geneva shrunk part of the southern end to a one-lane road (in order {{to make room for}} the expansion of Reeves Field) and put a sidewalk in where the northern end used to make the first bend in the s-turn, permanently blocking access to the s-bend. A traffic light was installed at the intersection along the new alignment with Geneva R.P. Church, requiring students to cross <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> light.|$|E

25|$|O'Connell Street has {{its origins}} in a street named Drogheda Street dating from the 17th century. Laid out by Henry Moore, Earl of Drogheda, it was {{a third of the}} width of the present-day O'Connell Street, located {{on the site of the}} modern eastern {{carriageway}} and extending from Parnell Street to the junction with Abbey Street. In the 1740s, a wealthy banker and property speculator by the name of Luke Gardiner acquired the upper part of Drogheda Street extending down to Henry Street as part of a much larger land deal. He demolished the western side of Drogheda Street creating an exclusive elongated residential square 46m (50yds) in width, thus establishing the scale of the modern-day thoroughfare. The new, more ordered western side featured modest two-bay houses to the south intended for merchants, and larger three-bay houses further north, while the eastern side had many mansions, the grandest of which was Drogheda House rented by the sixth Earl of Drogheda. Gardiner also laid out a mall down the central section of the street, lined with low granite walls and obelisks topped with oil-fuelled lamp globes. It was planted with trees a few years later. He titled the new development 'Sackville Street' after the then Lord Lieutenant of Ireland Lionel Cranfield Sackville, Duke of Dorset. It was also known as 'Sackville Mall', 'Gardiner's Mall' or simply 'The Mall'. However, due to the limited lands owned by the Gardiners in this area, the Rotunda Hospital sited just off <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> bottom of Parnell Square – also developed by the family – was not built on axis with Sackville Street, terminating the vista.|$|E
500|$|The current {{start of}} the A1 is the modern {{roundabout}} at {{the northern end of}} St. Martin's Le Grand where it meets Aldersgate Street, near the site of the now demolished General Post Office, London, the headquarters of the Post Office from 1829 to 1910. When originally designated in 1921 the A1 started a little further north along Aldersgate Street at Aldersgate Bars, which marked the boundary of the City, though some later maps indicate it starting {{at the southern end of}} St. Martin's Le Grand, near St Paul's Cathedral. [...] The route runs north from Aldersgate along Aldersgate Street which is a modern dual carriageway, and from the 13th century was known as a wide street with fine buildings and travellers' inns; these were destroyed or badly damaged during the Blitz, and from 1965 to 1976 the 40 acre (162,000m²) Barbican Estate, an arts complex and residential estate, was constructed along the entire eastern side of <b>the</b> <b>street.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> end of Aldersgate Street stood Aldersgate Bars, which marked the limits of the City of London.|$|E
500|$|Over time, the {{district}} has evolved from an upscale neighborhood to a factory district and back to an upscale neighborhood. Zoning in 1853 anticipated residential development, although only one grand villa existed at the time. By 1877 the eleven-block area of Prairie Avenue as well as Calumet Avenue housed elite residences. By 1886 the finest mansions in the city, each equipped with its own carriage house, stood on Prairie Avenue. In the 1880s and 1890s, mansions for George Pullman, Marshall Field, John J. Glessner and Philip Armour anchored a neighborhood of over fifty mansions known as [...] "Millionaire's Row". Many of the leading architects of the day, such as Richard Morris Hunt, Henry Hobson Richardson and Daniel Burnham designed mansions on <b>the</b> <b>street.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> time of the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition, guidebooks described the street as [...] "the most expensive street west of Fifth Avenue". However, after Bertha Palmer, society wife of Potter Palmer, built the Palmer Mansion that anchored the Gold Coast along Lake Shore Drive, the elite residents began to move north.|$|E

500|$|Media organisations {{including}} the BBC and The Guardian incorrectly reported mephedrone was commonly {{used as a}} plant fertiliser. In fact sellers of the drug described it as [...] "plant food" [...] because it was illegal to sell the compound for human consumption. In late 2009 UK newspapers began referring to the drug as meow or miaow (sometimes doubled as meow meow or miaow miaow), a name that was almost unknown on <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time. In November 2009, the tabloid newspaper, The Sun published a story stating that a man had ripped off his own scrotum whilst using mephedrone. The story was later shown to be an online joke posted on mephedrone.com, later included in a police report with the caveat {{that it could be}} unreliable. The police report was used as a source for the story in The Sun. Other myths the media often repeated during 2010 were that mephedrone had led to the deaths of over 20 people, teachers were unable to confiscate the drug from pupils and the government was too slow to ban the drug. Parallels were drawn between the media coverage of mephedrone and a piece of satire by Chris Morris in 1997 on Brass Eye when he tricked public figures into talking of the dangers of taking the fictional legal drug [...] "cake". The Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD) have suggested that the media coverage of the drug led to its increased usage. Jon Silverman, a former BBC Home Affairs Correspondent, has written two articles discussing how the media had a strong influence over the UK government's drugs policy, particularly in that the government wished to demonstrate they were being [...] "tough" [...] on drugs.|$|E
