5|$|Pinkham Notch (elevation 2032ft. / 619 m) is a {{mountain}} {{pass in the}} White Mountains of north-central New Hampshire, United States. <b>The</b> <b>notch</b> {{is a result of}} extensive erosion by the Laurentide ice sheet during the Wisconsinian ice age. Pinkham Notch was eroded into a glacial U-shaped valley whose walls are formed by the Presidential, Wildcat, and Carter-Moriah ranges. Due to the volatility of the area's climate and rugged character of the terrain, a number of rare or endemic ecosystems have developed throughout <b>the</b> <b>notch.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>notch</b> first {{appears in}} {{recorded}} history in 1784, when an expedition led by Jeremy Belknap camped in <b>the</b> <b>notch</b> before ascending {{to the summit}} of Mount Washington through Huntington Ravine. Pinkham Notch was far more isolated than neighboring Crawford Notch; as a result, the first settler of Pinkham Notch came in 1827, 43years after habitation of Crawford Notch. The first settler, Hayes Copp, built a homestead in the then-uninhabited area, near where the Dolly Copp campground stands today. Copp and his wife lived alone in the wilderness until Daniel Pinkham completed the first road through <b>the</b> <b>notch</b> between in 1836, finally providing {{a link between the}} Copp homestead and civilization. In 1851, a railroad was built to Gorham, and a hotel, the Glen House, was constructed to accommodate passengers. Mount Washington was the main attraction in the area; a bridle path was constructed from the Glen House to hotels on the summit, which was later improved into what would become the Mount Washington Auto Road. Completion of the road in 1861 led to a massive increase in tourism.|$|E

5|$|American {{forces were}} quick to counter the attack. M20 {{recoilless}} rifles destroyed the machine gun positions, and American mortars began firing on any North Korean positions they could locate. However, North Korean forces {{were quick to}} advance up <b>the</b> <b>Notch,</b> to {{the crest of the}} hill that made up the pass. There, the discovered B Company, 19th Infantry, encamped. The 19th Infantry was apparently not prepared for combat, as North Korean forces were able to hit the American force and drive it off the hill, killing several of the American soldiers with bayonets. At about 12:00, B Company was driven from the crest of <b>the</b> <b>Notch,</b> and further confusion erupted when US Air Force aircraft accidentally strafed the retreating B Company. Neighboring positions also mistakenly attacked B Company, which retreated with 12 killed.|$|E
5|$|Fighting at <b>the</b> <b>Notch</b> {{continued}} through the afternoon, but, the attack still unsuccessful, the North Korean troops withdrew suddenly in the mid-afternoon, allowing American forces to recover most of the casualties and vehicles from <b>the</b> <b>Notch.</b> In the meantime, they set up roadblocks to prevent further North Korean attacks from moving down the road. North Korean forces disengaged from the fight without attempting to flank the Americans, and by nightfall {{they were out of}} the region. In the meantime, the 27th Infantry Regiment surprised a large column of North Korean forces advancing on the south road and captured many trucks of supplies. During the North Koreans' retreat from the two roads, US Air Force planes mounted an airstrike against the North Koreans and inflicted heavy casualties.|$|E

Effects of hole diameters on the strength and fracture of <b>the</b> <b>notched</b> specimen are analyzed. The damage initiation and growth of <b>the</b> <b>notched</b> specimen are described. In comparison with the earlier publications about the strength and fracture of laminate or textile composites in this field, {{the results of this}} paper will {{play an important role in}} the structural optimization and strength design of <b>the</b> <b>notched</b> composite laminate with a complex reinforcement mat.

Rest the pieces on the middle finger to give them a firm base, with the thumb and first finger reaching through the U shaped piece so that the two db pieces can be held. Using the U shaped pieces as a table place two other pieces on either side of it, they will curve towards each other so that they hold the db pieces up, they will link together so that it won't be as wobbly. Then <b>the</b> <b>notched</b> piece should be slide down from the top, but it'll be stopped by two pegs. <b>The</b> <b>notched</b> piece will now give the side pieces a brace so they don't fall inward. <b>The</b> <b>notched</b> piece should be slid in so <b>the</b> first <b>notch</b> near <b>the</b> edge will meet the two pegs below it, push it onto the pegs, if done carefully this will cause one of the pegged pieces to sink down, as the first peg clears the center beam, move it more towards the center of the sphere, so <b>the</b> second <b>notch</b> is over <b>the</b> second peg.

During the evening of July 31, 1st Battalion, 29th Infantry also arrived in the region. More importantly, A Company of the 8072nd Medium Tank Battalion, armed with M4 Sherman medium tanks rebuilt in Japan, arrived at Masan, {{some of the first}} heavy armor the UN had in the war. One platoon of A Company's tanks went to the 27th Infantry in the south while the 19th Infantry in the north got the other half.

40|$|The {{fracture}} {{parameters and}} fracture relational curves {{of the concrete}} containing nano-SiO 2 and fly ash with different relative <b>notch</b> depth of <b>the</b> <b>notched</b> beam specimens were measured by means of three-point bending method. The results indicate that <b>the</b> relative <b>notch</b> depth of <b>the</b> <b>notched</b> specimens has great effect on ac, KICini, KICun, GF, CMODc, and the fracture relational curves of the concrete containing nano-SiO 2 and fly ash. There is a tendency of increase in ac and CMODc {{with the increase of}} relative notch depth, while KICini, KICun, and GF are decreasing gradually with the increase of relative <b>notch</b> depth of <b>the</b> <b>notched</b> beam specimens. Besides, when <b>the</b> relative <b>notch</b> depth increases from 0. 2 to 0. 5, the nonlinear stage of the curve becomes shorter and shorter, and the descent stage of the curve becomes sharper and sharper. The fracture parameters of ac, KICini, KICun, GF, and CMODc and the fracture curves are sensitive to <b>the</b> relative <b>notch</b> depth, while CTODc may be not sensitive to <b>the</b> relative <b>notch</b> depth of <b>the</b> specimens of the concrete containing nano-SiO 2 and fly ash...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{performance}} of bamboo (Bambusa vulgaris) using <b>the</b> <b>notched</b> and <b>the</b> un-notched specimen. Double v-notched bamboo and un-notched bamboo specimens were used {{to carry out the}} experiment. Notched- angles of 20, 30, 60, 80 and 90 º were made on each specimen. These were done to ascertain the effect of the notched-angle on {{the performance of}} the bamboo. Each specimen was placed in a Uniaxial Compression Machine and was crushed with respect to time. The results are plotted as crushing load against time. The results from <b>the</b> <b>notched</b> bamboo were compared with an un-notched bamboo to predict the effect of stress concentration. Microstructures of the bamboo were also analysed with the aid of an Electronic Microscope. It was observed that the variation in <b>the</b> <b>notched</b> angles had significant effect on the crushing strength of the bamboo. <b>The</b> higher <b>the</b> <b>notched</b> angle <b>the</b> lower the crushing loads. The variation in <b>the</b> <b>notched</b> angles also had significant effect on the crushing time. Therefore, the crushing time decreases with increases with <b>the</b> <b>notched</b> angle. Results also show that stress concentration had significant effect on the performance of bamboo. Results further show that a notched-angle of 20, 30, 60, 80 and 90 º gave a crushing load of 8. 0, 5. 55, 3. 33, 1. 33 and 0. 93 kN respectively and a crushing time of 42. 46, 35. 78, 21. 89, 18. 02 and 10. 30 s, respectively...|$|R
