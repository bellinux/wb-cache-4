25|$|The Three Oaths are an Aggadic Midrash, and {{therefore}} they are not Halakhically obligatory (Aggadic Midrashim, as opposed to Halachic Midrashim are not traditionally understood as a valid source for Halacha). Accordingly, Maimonides' Mishne Torah, the Arba'ah Turim, the Shulchan Aruch, and other halachic sources do not cite the Three Oaths or rule accordingly. They are not found <b>there</b> <b>at</b> <b>all.</b>|$|E
25|$|With {{the cave}} {{thoroughly}} searched, some divers began questioning whether Ben was <b>there</b> <b>at</b> <b>all.</b> Perhaps {{his body had}} been secretly removed from the cave before searching began and disposed of on land or it had washed out through the spring's outlet. Others, including Cronin and Kelly, suggested he had staged his own disappearance to start his life over under another identity and escape his past troubles. Authorities began to consider these possibilities and adjust their search.|$|E
25|$|Because the United States has not {{ratified}} the Basel Convention or its Ban Amendment, and has few domestic federal laws forbidding {{the export of}} toxic waste, the Basel Action Network estimates that about 80% of the electronic waste directed to recycling in the U.S. does not get recycled <b>there</b> <b>at</b> <b>all,</b> but is put on container ships and sent to countries such as China. This figure is disputed as an exaggeration by the EPA, the Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries, and the World Reuse, Repair and Recycling Association.|$|E

25|$|It was 31 October 1953 when Middlesbrough last won a top flight game at Fratton Park, and 1990 {{saw their}} last victory <b>there</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> levels. Tuncay gave Boro the lead against a Portsmouth side that hadn't scored at home since September, {{and it was}} enough to give them their third away victory of the season, their second 1–0. The game also saw Mark Schwarzer surpass Tony Mowbray and Stephen Pears' totals to move into ninth in the all-time Middlesbrough {{appearance}} records, after playing his 425th game for the club. The result also saw Schwarzer overtake Dennis Bergkamp as the foreign player with the most Premier League appearances for one club.|$|E
25|$|There {{was much}} debate {{regarding}} {{the future of}} Ground Zero following {{the destruction of the}} World Trade Center. Disagreement and controversy regarding who owned the property and what would be built there hindered construction at the site for several years. Many wanted the Twin Towers to be rebuilt, but stronger and taller. The project for new Twin Towers was called Twin Towers II which was led by the informal organization, Twin Towers Alliance. Others did not want anything built <b>there</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> or wanted the entire site to become a memorial. Finally, a master plan was agreed upon, which would feature a memorial and museum where the original Twin Towers stood and six new skyscrapers surrounding it.|$|E
25|$|Unknown to Beast, Belle writes him {{a special}} book which he doesn't see until later on. She also meets Forte {{later on in}} a chance meeting. Forte tells her that Beast's {{favorite}} Christmas tradition was the Christmas tree. Belle becomes frustrated, for no tree she has seen on the grounds has been tall enough to hang ornaments. Forte lies to Belle, saying that a perfect tree {{can be found in}} the woods beyond the castle. Reluctant to go against Beast's orders that she never leave the castle, Belle leaves nonetheless in order to find the perfect tree. When Belle does not arrive to see Beast's Christmas present to her, he begins to suspect that she isn't <b>there</b> <b>at</b> <b>all.</b> When Cogsworth, having been ordered to retrieve Belle, explains that the household cannot find her, Beast becomes enraged. He goes to Forte to ask for advice, and Forte lies that Belle has abandoned him. Beast manages to find Belle and saves her in time from drowning after she fell through thin ice.|$|E

[...] A famously secretive filmmaker, Nolan is also known for his tight security on scripts, even going as far as telling the actors of The Dark Knight Rises the ending of the film verbally to avoid any leaks and also keeping the Interstellar plot secret from his composer Hans Zimmer.|$|E
500|$|The episode has {{received}} mostly positive reviews from television critics since airing. The {{authors of the}} book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, called the episode a [...] "superb example" [...] of political satire, [...] "demonstrating the lengths people will go to to win votes. Marge, of course, sees straight through Burns and uses Blinky the three-eyed fish to demonstrate his lack of conviction." [...] Phil Rosenthal of the Los Angeles Daily News called the episode a [...] "wonderful stab" [...] at American politics and the [...] "media machine that drives it", and added: [...] "The message is so subtle, the makers of The Simpsons might deny it is <b>there</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> for fear of turning off a portion of its audience. Truth is, you {{may very well be}} so busy laughing and taking in the fine details, such as the references to Citizen Kane, to notice." [...] Hal Boedeker of The Miami Herald said the episode took [...] "some well-aimed satirical jabs at American politics and the publics' short attention span. The episode has the wit of the best of All in the Family, and benign mother Marge becomes a force for good, in the Edith Bunker tradition." [...] Virginia Mann of The Record called the episode [...] "terrific", though she believed its social and political [...] "overtones" [...] were more likely to appeal to adults than children. Tom Shales of the Washington Post described the episode as [...] "a bull's-eye political satire".|$|E

On the other hand, {{there was a general}} consistency that ran through the defendants' descriptions of the attack on the female jogger: she was knocked down on the road, dragged into the woods, hit and molested by several defendants, sexually abused by some while others held her arms and legs, and left semiconscious in a state of undress."

2500|$|The {{composition}} of the individual scenes is simple and effective. In contrast to the dramatic depictions of Carolingian art, the artists avoided richly decorated backgrounds. The scenery, consisting of plants (especially on the left leaf) and architectural elements (mostly on the right leaf) are depicted in low relief and kept to a minimum. They are only <b>there</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> where they are necessary for comprehension of the scene or for compositional reasons. Instead, vast empty spaces provide negative space around the figures in the panels, to great effect. [...] identified the empty space as an [...] "effective space of corresponding gestures." [...] With their movement and individual gestures, each figure interacts with others – none of the figures can be understood on their own, independent of their counterparts, without losing their meaning.|$|E
2500|$|The play can {{be viewed}} as an allegory on the power of {{totalitarianism}} and the struggle to oppose it, the protagonist representing people ruled by dictators (the director and his aide). By [...] "tweak him until his clothing and posture project the required image of pitiful dejectedness", they exert their control over the silenced figure. “The Director’s reifying of the Protagonist can be seen as an attempt to reduce a living human being to the status of an icon of impotent suffering. But, {{at the end of the}} play, he reasserts his humanity and his individuality in a single, vestigial, yet compelling movement.” In answer to a reviewer who claimed that the ending was ambiguous Beckett replied angrily: “There’s no ambiguity <b>there</b> <b>at</b> <b>all.</b> He’s saying, you bastards, you haven’t finished me yet.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Following the {{production}} of Rabies, a [...] "glacial coldness" [...] grew between the group members, with Key and Goettel often siding against Ogre, feeling he {{was more interested in}} solo work.

Ogre also expressed his disapproval for the album stating that he had [...] "flopped"; Ogre continued on that [...] "the work and artistic environment really weren't <b>there</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> either.

Key and Goettel used this time to complete work on some of their side projects such a Hilt, releasing their first effort Call the Ambulance (Before I Hurt Myself) which was produced by Rave.
