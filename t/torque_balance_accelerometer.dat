40|$|Input <b>torque</b> <b>balancing</b> through {{addition}} of an auxiliary, input <b>torque</b> <b>balancing</b> mechanism, {{is a well-known}} way for reducing drive speed uc-tuations in high-speed cam-follower mechanisms. This paper develops a methodology to design and optimize the so-called inverted cam mecha-nism (ICM), a simple, cam-based input <b>torque</b> <b>balancing</b> mechanism. It was already introduced in the fties, but the design methodologies pro-posed by Meyer zur Capellen (1964) and Michelin (1979) are respectively erroneous or too rough an approximation, and are corrected here. The describing equation that governs the ICM cam design, is {{shown to be a}} second-order, nonlinear, ordinary dierential equation. It is solved by pa-rameterizing its solution as a nite Fourier series, the coecients of which are determined through a nonlinear least-squares problem. Based on this methodology, an ICM is designed for input <b>torque</b> <b>balancing</b> a high-speed, industrial cam-follower mechanism. The ICM's design parameters result from a design optimization, which aims at obtaining a compact and tech-nologically feasible mechanism. The optimization problem is solved using a design chart, which is eciently created based on a nondimensionalized analysis...|$|R

40|$|Input <b>torque</b> <b>balancing</b> is a {{well known}} way to reduce drive speed {{fluctuations}} in high speed machinery and combustion engines. This paper introduces a cam-based centrifugal pendulum (CBCP) and a design procedure for it which results in quasi perfect <b>balancing</b> of inertial <b>torques</b> for any drive speed. The CBCP combines the centrifugal pendulum vibration absorber, well-known in mechanical vibration literature, with a <b>torque</b> <b>balancing</b> principle well-known in mechanism literature, that is, the use of cams to generate arbitrary torques. For given design parameters (such as the link lengths and link inertial parameters), the cam design is governed by a nonlinear, second-order, explicit differential equation. This differential equation is numerically solved by reformulating it as a nonlinear least squares problem. The design parameters themselves are determined {{by means of an}} optimization problem, the goal of which is to minimize the (constant) equivalent inertia of the combined system, consisting of the original mechanism to be balanced and the CBCP. Application of the CBCP to <b>torque</b> <b>balance</b> a high-speed, purely inertial cam-follower mechanism, driving the sley of a weaving loom, shows that the optimization results in a compact and technologically feasible mechanism. ...|$|R
40|$|Particle {{detachment}} {{from the rock}} during suspension transport in porous media was widely observed in laboratory corefloods and for flows in natural reservoirs. A new mathematical model for detachment of particles is based on mechanical equilibrium of a particle positioned on the internal cake or matrix surface in the pore space. The <b>torque</b> <b>balance</b> of drag, electrostatic, lifting and gravity forces, acting on the particle from the matrix and the moving fluid, is considered. The <b>torque</b> <b>balance</b> determines maximum retention concentration during the particle capture. The particle torque equilibrium {{is determined by the}} dimensionless ratio between the drag and normal forces acting on the particle. The maximum retention function of the dimensionless ratio (dislodging number) closes system of governing equations for colloid transport with particle release. One-dimensional problem of coreflooding by suspension accounting for limited particle retention, controlled by the torque sum, allows for exact solution under the assumptions of constant filtration coefficient and porosity. The explicit formulae permit the calculation of the model parameters (maximum retention concentration, filtration and formation damage coefficients) from the history of the pressure drop across the core during suspension injection. The values for maximum retention concentration, as obtained from two coreflood tests, have been matched with those calculated by the <b>torque</b> <b>balance</b> on the micro scale.

40|$|The {{motion of}} the feed in a {{single-screw}} extruder is calculated {{with the use of}} a triangular control volume to determine the feed velocity and direction. A cylindrical coordinate system with a rotating screw is used to obtain torque, force, and energy balances needed to determine the developing stress (pressure) and temperature of the feed plug. The resulting equations can be easily programmed for evaluation with a personal computer. Background The original work of Darnell and Mol [1] formulates the basic motion and force balances for solids conveying. Constant friction factors are utilized and the flow is isothermal. Tadmor and Klein [2] improved the basics with different barrel and screw friction factors. Tadmor and Broyer [3, 4] introduced heat transfer and power consumption into the equations for solids conveying and were able to account for the variation in friction factor with temperature. Chung, Hennessey and Tusim [5] added the approach of independently measuring surface stress for calculating feed flow. Hyun, Spalding, and Hinton [6] utilized the surface stress technique with a new model using two <b>torque</b> <b>balances.</b> They provide flow data from a special feed section analysis extruder with controlled temperature and pressure conditions [7]. Campbell and Dontula [8] develop a model and neglect any <b>torque</b> <b>balance</b> equation by assuming the solid bed to be an elastic fluid. The model presented here in cylindrical coordinates progressively describes the kinematics, force, <b>torque,</b> and energy <b>balances</b> to provide pressure and temperature as a function of given flow rate.
