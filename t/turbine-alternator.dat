25|$|The first {{prototype}} AGR became operational in 1962, but {{the first}} commercial AGR did not come online until 1976. A total of fourteen AGR reactors at six sites were built between 1976 and 1988. All of these are configured with two reactors in a single building. Each reactor has a design thermal power output of 1,500 MWt driving a 660 MWe <b>turbine-alternator</b> set. The various AGR stations produce outputs in the range 555 MWe to 670 MWe though some run at lower than design output due to operational restrictions.|$|E
50|$|The Wolf Creek and Callaway plants {{each have}} single half speed, 1,800 RPM (60 Hz), steam <b>turbine-alternator</b> sets which use the steam {{produced}} {{from the heat}} generated in the reactor to produce about 1,200 MW of electricity at the US grid frequency of 60 Hz. Such large turbo-alternator sets were not available in the UK at the time Sizewell B was designed. So that orders could be given to UK manufacturers, and to avoid project risk in dealing with what were at the time newly designed very large turbo-alternator sets, Sizewell B uses two full-speed, 3,000 RPM (50 Hz), nominal 660 MW turbo-alternator sets {{similar to those used}} at Drax coal-fired power station, and at the last of the AGRs Heysham 2, but adapted to cope with the wetter steam conditions produced by the PWR steam supply system. PWR steam supply systems produce saturated steam at lower temperature and pressure than the dry superheated steam produced by AGR reactors or coal-fired power stations, and the high- and intermediate-pressure stages of the steam turbines have to be designed cope with this Sizewell B can run at half power using one turbo-alternator.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} was to determine which reactor, conversion, and radiator technologies would best fulfill future Megawatt Class Nuclear Space Power System Requirements. Specifically, the requirement was 10 megawatts for 5 years of full power operation and 10 years systems life on orbit. A variety of liquid metal and gas cooled reactors, static and dynamic conversion systems, and passive and dynamic radiators were considered. Four concepts were selected for more detailed study. The concepts are: a gas cooled reactor with closed cycle Brayton <b>turbine-alternator</b> conversion with heat pipe and pumped tube-fin heat rejection; a lithium cooled reactor with a free piston Stirling engine-linear alternator and a pumped tube-fin radiator; a lithium cooled reactor with potassium Rankine <b>turbine-alternator</b> and heat pipe radiator; and a lithium cooled incore thermionic static conversion reactor with a heat pipe radiator. The systems recommended for further development to meet a 10 megawatt long life requirement are the lithium cooled reactor with the K-Rankine conversion and heat pipe radiator, and the lithium cooled incore thermionic reactor with heat pipe radiator...|$|E

40|$|Electricity {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely used forms of energy. Being a {{renewable}} source of energy small hydropower is considered as an environment—friendly and cheap source of electricity. The installation cost of the small hydropower project depends mainly on two parts—civil works and electromechanical equipment. One of the most important element on the recovery of a small hydro-power plant is the electromechanical equipment (<b>turbine-alternator).</b> The present paper intends to develop a correlation to determine the cost based on the cost influencing parameters as power and head using three different methods, namely; sigma plot method, linest method and logest method. An attempt has also been made to identify the best correlation among the three models closer to the actual cost of electro-mechanical equipment as collected from recently developed projects...|$|E
40|$|The SNAP- 8 {{program has}} {{developed}} the technology base for one class of multikilowatt dynamic space power systems. Electrical power {{is generated by}} a <b>turbine-alternator</b> in a mercury Rankine-cycle loop to which heat is transferred and removed by means of sodium-potassium eutectic alloy subsystems. Final system overall criteria include a five-year operating life, restartability, man rating, and deliverable power in the 90 kWe range. The basic technology has been demonstrated by more than 400, 000 hours of major component endurance testing and numerous startup and shutdown cycles. A test system, comprised of developed components, delivered up to 35 kWe for a period exceeding 12, 000 hours. The SNAP- 8 system baseline is considered to have achieved a level of technology suitable for final application development for long-term multikilowatt space missions...|$|E
