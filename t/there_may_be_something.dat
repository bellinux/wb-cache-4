500|$|In March 1911, Shay {{was riding}} in a taxi that {{collided}} with a dray and he sustained severe cuts to his face. A newspaper report said that Shay might miss a portion of spring training. Shay was suspended indefinitely in late June 1911 after a fight with an umpire. In October 1911, Shay abruptly resigned as the manager in Kansas City. He declined to say what prompted his resignation {{and said that he}} might not be permanently finished with baseball, but {{he said that he was}} finished with the Kansas City club. When asked about the possibility of a major league managing job, Shay responded, [...] "There is nothing to be said now, but <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> later." ...|$|E
500|$|Technologically, the Covenant are {{described}} in [...] and [...] to be imitative rather than innovative—most of the Covenant's sophisticated weaponry and propulsion systems are based on Forerunner artifacts, rather than the Covenant's own research. Covenant weapons are generally based on Forerunner technology and utilize plasma. These weapons are built around a battery that generates plasma and discharges it at a target. Frank O'Connor, Bungie's former public relations head, hinted that <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> more to the Covenant's weaponry, saying [...] "the actual technology is not plasma as we know it, but something far more dangerous, arcane, and destructive." [...] A few of the Covenant's weapons are not plasma-based, including the Needler, which fires razor-sharp pink needles capable of [...] "homing in" [...] on organic foes and exploding. A weapons expert noted parallels between the Needler and ancient Greek Amazons painting their daggers pink as a psychological weapon in an issue of gaming magazine Electronic Gaming Monthly.|$|E
500|$|The {{majority}} {{of what is}} said and depicted in the game is open to interpretation, leading fans to develop and discuss theories {{about the nature of}} the events that occur in the game. Let's Players Voidburger and Bob from the video-game related podcast The Grate Debate opined that the open-ended nature of the game is one of its greatest aspects. They also said that <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> in the game that has not been discovered yet. They noted the colored lights as something they still had not figured out, and they felt that the game hinted that the radio may be the main culprit behind the father's killing. The game also contained a Swedish line in the radio describing a radio drama from 1938 being true, which gamers suggested may be a nod to Orson Welles's radio adaptation of The War of the Worlds. This possible reference to alien invasions was noted as a continuation of a Silent Hill tradition of having secret endings that included aliens. Another theory commonly discussed is deciphering the identity of the player character. The fetus talking to the player character about his remembering moments [...] "ten months back" [...] seems to imply that he is the father who killed Lisa and the kids, although Voidburger and Bob believe that the player character may be the protagonist that was to be in Silent Hills, as shown in the trailer following the ending of P.T.|$|E

"Why," [...] I cried, [...] "now {{you come}} to mention it, I {{remember}} the year I was working at Etna, the Sicilians at Catania all declared that sprains and cuts and rheumatic affections would never get well before or during eruptive periods.

2500|$|During {{its opening}} weekend, After Earth took in $27.5 million in box office {{receipts}} in North America and $2.5M in South Korea. Sony Pictures projected a launch of around $38 million, but the actual number was 17% lower than the lowest pre-release expectation of $33 million. It finished in third place behind Fast & Furious 6, an action film, and Now You See Me, a caper film. Taking into account the popularity of principal actor Will Smith, the disappointing finish led The Wall Street Journal {{to call it a}} [...] "flop". Ray Subers of Box Office Mojo noted the $27 million weekend placed it between two sci-fi flops of 2012 films with 200 million-plus budgets, Battleship ($25.5 million) and John Carter ($30.2 million), and also drew half of the co-stars' previous openings, Will Smith's Men in Black 3 ($54.6 million) and Jaden Smith's The Karate Kid ($55.7 million). Scott Mendelson from Forbes argued that Sony made a mistake of hiding M. Night Shyamalan as they promoted the film because for better or worse, the general public knows who he is and [...] "His name on the marquee reflects that you’re {{not going to get a}} conventional genre film, that <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> else up its sleeve." ...|$|E

"Why, to {{tell you}} the truth, Sir John Goldencalf, we monikins (for in these {{particulars}} Leaphigh is Leaplow) have two distinct governing principles in all that we say or do, which <b>may</b> <b>be</b> divided into the theoretical and the practical--moral and immoral would not be inapposite--but, by the first we control all our interests, down as far as facts, when we immediately submit to the latter. <b>There</b> <b>may</b> possibly <b>be</b> <b>something</b> inconsistent in appearance in such an arrangement; but then our most knowing ones say that it works well. No doubt among men, you get along without the embarrassment of so much contradiction." ...|$|R
6000|$|The altercation {{between the}} two gentlemen became very painful to the women, {{especially}} to Mrs. Lightfoot, who did everything to soothe Mr. Morgan; and, under pretence of giving a pipe-light to the stranger, she handed him a paper on which she had privily written the words, [...] "He knows you. Go." [...] <b>There</b> <b>may</b> have <b>been</b> <b>something</b> suspicious in her manner of handing, or in her guest's of reading, the paper; for when he got up a short time afterwards, {{and said he would}} go to bed, Morgan rose too, with a laugh, and said it was too early to go to bed.|$|R

60|$|It is {{of course}} quite {{impossible}} to say what she found there--or indeed what there was to find there then. For a moment they faced riddles, and then the Sea Lady turned her eyes with a long deferred scrutiny to the man's face, which she probably saw now closely for the first time. One wonders whether it is just possible that <b>there</b> <b>may</b> have <b>been</b> <b>something,</b> if it <b>were</b> {{no more than a}} gleam of surprise and enquiry, in that meeting of their eyes.

The fundamental manner in which hardware and software interact is poorly understood, and yet there is little indication in the literature that this is being discussed or explored. In spite of our technological achievements, we are at a loss to precisely define the boundaries between hardware and software, and to describe the nature of their interface. This paper aims to raise some of the major issues and questions, to propose a hardware-information duality, and to suggest directions in which further research might be pursued. 1...|$|R
50|$|Railway {{officials}} initially {{described how}} <b>there</b> <b>may</b> have <b>been</b> <b>something</b> {{wrong with the}} drivers of the Uttar Banga Express, detailing how the train had passed through a red signal at high speed, with {{no evidence of a}} brake application and with no apparent attempt by the driver or co-driver to jump clear of the train cab before the collision. Both were found dead in the wreckage, still in their seats. The possibility of the two drivers of Uttar Banga Express being drugged had triggered alarm in the railways. However, the post mortem of the drivers at the Suri hospital did not show any evidence of drugs. As a precaution, drivers and guards have been asked not to buy any food or drink at stations.|$|R

60|$|It <b>may</b> therefore, perhaps, <b>be</b> worthy some Physicians enquiry, whether <b>there</b> <b>may</b> not <b>be</b> <b>something</b> mixt {{with the}} Urine {{in which the}} Gravel or Stone lies, which may again make it {{dissolve}} it, {{the first of which}} seems by it's regular Figures to have been sometimes Crystalliz'd out of it.

60|$|Now there <b>is</b> <b>something</b> {{exceedingly}} captivating {{in a pair}} of soft blue eyes--not that <b>there</b> <b>may</b> not <b>be</b> <b>something</b> {{quite as}} captivating {{in a pair of}} brown or black or grey eyes--but there <b>is</b> <b>something</b> singularly captivating in the peculiar style of captivation wherewith a man is captivated by a pair of blue--distinctly blue--eyes. Perhaps it is that their resemblance to the cerulean depths of the bright sky and the blue profundities of the ocean invests them with a suggestive influence that is agreeable to the romantic and idealising tendencies of human nature; or that the colour is (or ought to be, if it is not) emblematic of purity. We throw out this suggestion solely for the benefit of unimpassioned philosophers. Those whose hearts are already under the pleasant thraldom of black or brown eyes are incapable of forming an opinion on the abstract question.|$|R
60|$|It happened, however, when I {{had gone}} on thus for a long time, that I formed an {{acquaintance}} with a deaf gentleman, which ripened into intimacy and close companionship.

6000|$|It {{seemed to}} him that what he said was irrevocable, but he was desperate. It {{seemed to him}} that in a moment more he would have told her his whole secret.
