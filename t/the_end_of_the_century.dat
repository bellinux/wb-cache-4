5|$|By the 18thcentury, the menagerie {{was open}} to the public; {{admission}} cost three half-pence or the supply of a cat or dog to be fed to the lions. By <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>century,</b> that had increased to 9 pence. A particularly famous inhabitant was Old Martin, a large grizzly bear given to George III by the Hudson's Bay Company in 1811.|$|E
5|$|Just {{before the}} {{restoration}} of King Charles II to the throne in 1660, the Royalist Sir Peter Killigrew became the new captain of the castle. Fears of an invasion continued, and an additional gun battery was constructed at Crab Quay, to the south-east of the main fortification. At <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>century,</b> a new guard barracks and gate were constructed, probably emulating those being constructed in France.|$|E
5|$|Mdina's fortifications {{remained}} in {{use during the}} British period, and some minor alterations such as the installation of gun emplacements {{were made in the}} 19th century.

5|$|Scottish art in {{the eighteenth}} century is the body of visual art made in Scotland, by Scots, or about Scottish subjects, {{in the eighteenth century}}. This period saw {{development}} of professionalisation, with art academies were established in Edinburgh and Glasgow. Art was increasingly influenced by Neoclassicism, the Enlightenment and towards <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>century</b> by Romanticism, with Italy becoming a major centre of Scottish art.|$|E
5|$|The {{only new}} poetry Riley {{published}} after <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>century</b> were elegies for famous friends. The poetic {{qualities of the}} poems were often poor, but they contained many popular sentiments concerning the deceased. Among those he eulogized were Benjamin Harrison, Lew Wallace, and Henry Lawton. Because of the poor quality of the poems, his friends and publishers requested that he stop writing them, but he refused.|$|E
5|$|A {{police station}} was {{established}} at No.21 Great Marlborough Street in 1793. This {{led to the}} establishment of Marlborough Street Magistrates Court at No.20–21 in the early 19th century, which had {{become one of the most}} important magistrates courts in England by <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>century.</b> William Ewart Gladstone gave evidence in the court against a blackmailer who claimed Gladstone had frequented prostitutes in Leicester Square, while the Marquess of Queensbury's libel trial against Oscar Wilde took place here in 1895.|$|E

5|$|After Justinian died in 565, his successor, Justin II {{refused to}} pay the large tribute to the Persians. Meanwhile, the Germanic Lombards invaded Italy; by <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>century</b> {{only a third of}} Italy was in Byzantine hands. Justin's successor, Tiberius II, {{choosing}} between his enemies, awarded subsidies to the Avars while taking military action against the Persians. Though Tiberius' general, Maurice, led an effective campaign on the eastern frontier, subsidies failed to restrain the Avars. They captured the Balkan fortress of Sirmium in 582, while the Slavs began to make inroads across the Danube.|$|E
5|$|At <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>century,</b> some of {{the most}} widely read Russian {{literary}} figures focused on feminist motifs in their works. In his later years, Leo Tolstoy argued against the traditional institution of marriage, comparing it to forced prostitution and slavery, a theme that he also touched on in his novel Anna Karenina. In his plays and short stories, Anton Chekhov portrayed a variety of working female protagonists, from actresses to governesses, who sacrificed social esteem and affluence for the sake of financial and personal independence; in spite of this sacrifice, these women are among the few Chekhovian characters who are truly satisfied with their lives.|$|E
5|$|Brownsea Castle, {{also known}} {{historically}} as Branksea Castle, was originally a Device Fort constructed by Henry VIII between 1545 and 1547 to protect Poole Harbour in Dorset, England, {{from the threat}} of French attack. Located on Brownsea Island, it comprised a stone blockhouse with a hexagonal gun platform. It was garrisoned by the local town with six soldiers and armed with eight artillery pieces. The castle remained in use after the original invasion scare had passed and was occupied by Parliament during the English Civil War of the 1640s. By <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>century,</b> however, it had fallen into disuse.|$|E

5|$|By comparison, in 1801 the {{population}} of England and Wales was 9million; by 1851 it had more than doubled to 18million, and by <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>century</b> had reached 40million. Today, Bangladeshis form the largest minority population in Tower Hamlets, constituting 33.5% of the borough's population at the 2001 census; the Bangladeshi community there is the largest such community in Britain. The 2006 estimates show a decline in this group to 29.8% of {{the population}}, reflecting a movement to better economic circumstances and the larger houses available in the eastern suburbs. In this, the latest group of migrants are following a pattern established for over three centuries.|$|E
5|$|By the 18th century local {{residents}} had built summer houses {{on top of}} the walls, which were still largely intact. During the next hundred years city and town walls across England began to be demolished to make way for new developments, and Worcester proved no exception. By <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>century</b> the walls and gates were being sold off and destroyed; Friar's Gate was probably the last to be demolished, early in the 19th century. Only a few tracts of wall survived, often concealed behind other buildings and new constructions.|$|E
5|$|By the 18th century, {{smallpox}} was endemic in Europe. There {{were five}} epidemics in London between 1719 and 1746, and large outbreaks occurred in other major European cities. By <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>century</b> about 400,000Europeans were dying {{from the disease}} each year. It reached South Africa in 1713, having been carried by ships from India, and in 1789 the disease struck Australia. In the 19th century, smallpox became {{the single most important}} cause of death of the Australian Aborigines.|$|E

5|$|By <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>century,</b> {{the many}} repairs {{undertaken}} since the memorial's construction {{had left a}} patchwork of materials and colours, and a disconcerting pattern of damage from water intrusion at the joints. In May 2001, the Government of Canada announced the Canadian Battlefield Memorials Restoration Project, a major C$30million restoration project to restore Canada's memorial sites in France and Belgium, {{in order to maintain}} and present them in a respectful and dignified manner. In 2005, the Vimy memorial closed for major restoration work. Veterans Affairs Canada directed the restoration of the memorial in cooperation with other Canadian departments, the Commonwealth War Graves Commission, consultants and specialists in military history.|$|E
5|$|Contrasted {{with the}} flourishing {{state of trade}} {{in the first half}} of the 19th century is the rapid and {{sustained}} decline during the second half. In the period of 40 years from 1841 to 1881, the population fell from 2836 to 1192, a loss of over 57%. By <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>century,</b> all that remained of the major industries of the town was the malthouse of F.A. Waller & Co., while all smaller industries had vanished completely.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{destruction}} of the Armada, the Spanish threat continued; the castles in Kent were kept ready for action throughout the rest of Elizabeth's reign. In 1596 a Spanish invasion fleet carrying reportedly 20,000 soldiers set out for Pendennis, which was then garrisoned with only 500 men. The fleet was forced to turn back due to bad weather, but Elizabeth reviewed the defences and significantly expanded Henry's original fortifications with more up-to-date bastions, designed by the engineer Paul Ive. By <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>century,</b> however, most of the Device Forts were typically out of date by European standards.|$|E
