5|$|Red Cloud's actions gave E Company {{time and}} warning to blunt the Chinese offensive, {{eventually}} repelling the attack. His actions are also credited with allowing his company to evacuate several others {{wounded in the}} attack.

5|$|There {{are several}} {{important}} temples built on Capitoline hill: {{the temple of}} Juno Moneta, the temple of Virtus, and the Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus Capitolinus.

It was built in 509 BC and was nearly as large as the Parthenon. <b>The</b> <b>hill</b> <b>and</b> the temple of Jupiter became the symbols of Rome, the capital of the world.|$|E

5|$|With the {{collapse}} of Magaw's outer lines {{to the south and}} east of the fort, the general American retreat towards the perceived safety of the fort took place. To the south, the third defensive line had never been completed so Cadwalader had nowhere left to retreat to except the fort. To the north, the riflemen under Rawlings still held, but barely, as there were fewer riflemen than before and because the increased amount of firing had jammed some of the men's weapons, some of the men were forced to push boulders down the hill at the attacking Hessians. The American battery at Fort Washington was silenced by Pearl. By this time, the riflemen's fire had almost ceased, and the Hessians slowly advanced up <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> <b>and</b> engaged the Americans in hand-to-hand fighting. Overpowering the Americans, the Hessians reached the top of <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> <b>and</b> swarmed into the redoubt with a bayonet charge, capturing it quickly.|$|E
5|$|By May, the Rangers were emplaced at Hill 258, on {{the front}} lines between the 31st RCT and the 7th Marine Regiment of the U.S. 1st Marine Division. They {{conducted}} frequent patrols along an outpost network, often encountering and engaging Chinese troops. They fortified <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> <b>and</b> surrounding areas, which served as an advance outpost to warn the 7th Infantry Division if the Chinese attacked. During this period, the fighting entered a lull, and troops resumed their rest and recuperation rotations. Allen, Pryor, and Freeman left on one such rotation with a number of men, leaving Queen and only 80 enlisted men on the hill.|$|E
5|$|Dolbadarn Castle {{comprises}} a courtyard, {{surrounded by}} a number of towers and a round keep. The castle is built from purple and green slate stone, mainly constructed in a dry stone fashion without mortar, {{with the exception of the}} keep. The courtyard follows the natural shape of <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> <b>and</b> is protected by a curtain wall; originally perhaps 15feet (5m) high, it is now only at most 3feet (1m) high. Of the castle buildings, only the keep remains to any significant height.|$|E

5|$|During {{the late}} Saxon and early medieval period {{there were at}} least four {{buildings}} on the summit. The base of a stone cross demonstrates Christian use of the site during this period and {{it may have been a}} hermitage. The broken head of a wheel cross dated to the 10th or 11th centuries was found part way down <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> <b>and</b> may have been the head of the cross that stood on the summit. The head of the cross is now in the Museum of Somerset in Taunton.|$|E
5|$|Fifty light {{infantry}} {{men were}} in pursuit of Mercer's men when a fresh brigade of 1,100 militiamen {{under the command of}} Cadwalader appeared. Mawhood gathered his men who were all over the battlefield and put them into battle line formation. Meanwhile, Sullivan was at a standoff with the detachment of the 55th Regiment that had come to assist the 40th Regiment, neither daring to move towards the main battle for risk of exposing its flank. Cadwalader attempted to move his men into a battle line but they had no combat experience and did not know even the most basic military maneuvers. When his men reached the top of <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> <b>and</b> saw Mercer's men fleeing from the British, most of the militia turned around and ran back down the hill.|$|E
5|$|From 1978 to 1981, Sai Tso Wan Landfill (晒草灣堆填區) served East Kowloon. Approximately 1.6million tonnes of {{domestic}} waste and commercial waste were {{dumped in the}} site during its four-year operation. The disposed waste stacked up to 65 metres high. After its closure in 1981, it was sealed with soil and planted over with Grasslands and trees. Sin Fat Road, which runs up <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> <b>and</b> hosts Sceneway Garden Minibus Terminus, was constructed. Sai Tso Wan Landfill was later rebuilt into Sai Tso Wan Recreation Ground.|$|E

5|$|Heavy {{rainfall}} {{from the}} typhoon breached a flood-retaining wall at Camp Fuji, a training facility for the United States Marine Corps near Yokosuka. Marines inside the camp weathered the storm inside huts {{situated at the}} base of a hill which housed a fuel farm. The breach led to hoses being dislodged from two rubber storage bladders, releasing large quantities of fuel. The fuel flowed down <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> <b>and</b> was ignited by a heater used to warm one of the huts. The resultant fire killed 13 Marines, injured 68, and caused moderate damage to the facility. The facility's barracks were destroyed, along with fifteen huts and several other structures. The barracks were rebuilt, and a memorial was established for those who lost their lives in the fire.|$|E
5|$|Ibrahim Pasha {{continued}} his expedition against the rebels of Jabal Nablus, pursuing them at Zeita. Ninety rebels were slain {{while the rest}} fled to Deir al-Ghusun, situated on a hilltop {{to the east of}} Zeita. At Deir al-Ghusun, many of the inhabitants and rebels heeded a call by Husayn Abd al-Hadi to flee once the Egyptian troops arrived. In response, Qasim had several of the defectors among his ranks killed. Ibrahim Pasha's troops stormed <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> <b>and</b> the rebels (mostly members of the Qasim, Jarrar, Jayyusi and Barqawi clans) were routed, suffering 300 fatalities. Most of the surviving rebels, including Qasim and his son Yusuf, who were both wounded, fled. Captured rebels of fighting age were sent to Egypt for professional military training, while older rebels had their right hands cut off.|$|E
5|$|It rained for {{the next}} day and a half, {{preventing}} battle. During this time, Baum's men constructed a small redoubt at the crest of <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> <b>and</b> hoped that the weather would prevent the Americans from attacking before reinforcements arrived. Stark sent out skirmishers to probe the German lines, and managed to kill thirty Indians in spite of the difficulties of keeping their gunpowder dry. Reinforcements for both sides marched out on the 15th; travel was quite difficult due to the heavy rains. Burgoyne sent 550 men under Heinrich von Breymann, while Warner's company of about 350 Green Mountain Boys came south from Manchester under Lieutenant Samuel Safford's command.|$|E

The American Sound sessions represented {{a significant departure from}} the control customarily exerted by Hill and Range. Moman still {{had to deal with the}} publisher's staff on site, whose song suggestions he regarded as unacceptable. He was on the verge of quitting, until Presley ordered <b>the</b> <b>Hill</b> <b>and</b> Range personnel out of the studio. Although RCA executive Joan Deary was later full of praise for the producer's song choices and the quality of the recordings, Moman, to his fury, received neither credit on the records nor royalties for his work.|$|E
5|$|Operating near Taegu {{during the}} Battle of Taegu, {{elements}} of the U.S. Army's 2nd Battalion, 5th Cavalry Regiment, 1st Cavalry Division were surrounded by North Korean troops crossing the Naktong River at Hill 303. Most of the U.S. troops were able to escape but one platoon of mortar operators misidentified North Korean troops as South Korean army reinforcements and was captured. North Korean troops held the Americans on <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> <b>and</b> initially tried to move them across the river {{and out of the}} battle, but they were unable to do so because of heavy counterattack. American forces eventually broke the North Korean advance, routing the force. As the North Koreans began to retreat one of their officers ordered the prisoners to be shot so they would not slow the North Koreans down.|$|E
