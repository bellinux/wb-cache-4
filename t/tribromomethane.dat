Changes in total {{dissolved inorganic carbon}} (CT) and total alkalinity (AT) were mostly dependent on temperature and salinity until the ice edge was reached. After this point only a weak correlation was seen between these. Highest mean values of CT and AT were observed in the Winter Ice Edge (WIE) (2195 and 2319 µmol/kg, respectively). Lowest mean AT (2277 µmol/kg) was observed in the Sub-Antarctic Front (SAF), whereas lowest mean CT concentration (2068 µmol/kg) {{was associated with the}} Sub-Tropical Front (STF). The pH in situ varied between 8. 060 and 8. 156 where the highest values were observed {{in the southern part of}} the Antarctic Polar Front (APF) and in the Summer Ice Edge (SIE) Region. These peaks were associated with areas of high chlorophyll a (chl a) and <b>tribromomethane</b> values. In the other areas the pH in situ was mainly dependent on hydrography. Bacterial abundance decreased more than one order of magnitude when going from north to south. The decrease appeared to be strongly related to water temperature and there were no elevated abundances at frontal zones. Microphytoplankton dominated in the SAF and APF, whereas the nano- and picoplankton dominated outside these regions. Volatile halogenated compounds were found to vary both with regions, and with daylight. For the iodinated compounds, the highest concentrations were found north of the STF. Brominated hydrocarbons had high concentrations in the STF, but elevated concentrations were also found in the APF and SIE regions. No obvious correlation could be found between the occurrence of individual halocarbons and chl a.

40|$|The study {{assessed}} {{the levels of}} trihalomethanes in drinking water from Ahmadu Bello University treatment plant between 2008 and 2010. Two hundred and fifty two (252) samples of processed drinking water at various stages of treatment and distribution were taken in duplicates. In accordance with the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) Method 551. 1, samples were taken using ammonium chloride as de-chlorinating agent and methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) as solvent extractant during samples’ analyses. Concentrations of the four regulated trihalomethanes (trichloromethane – CHCl 3, <b>tribromomethane</b> – CHBr 3, tribromochloroomethane and bromodichloromethane) were analysed using Agilent gas chromatograph (GC) model 19091 - 413 with Chemstation software. From the study, only <b>tribromomethane</b> was detected immediately after chlorination while trichloromethane and bromodichloromethane were detected at storage in the booster station. Peak values of these analytes were also obtained at the booster station. Maximum permissible levels of the analytes are set only as total mean trihalomethanes. In the study, total mean trihalomethanes (TTHMs) values ranged from zero in the raw water and water after sedimentation to 1. 3140 E- 02 ± 1. 4614 E- 05 mg/L in the booster station water samples but decreased to 1. 0601 E- 02 ± 1. 6625 mg/L at household level. These values exceeded the national limit of 0. 001 mg/L but fall within acceptable limits under the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), European Union (EU), Canadian and World Health Organization (WHO) standards. Statistically, the observed mean values showed some significant differences and also had significant relationships {{with some of the}} sampled waters’ physical parameters such as pH, residual chlorine, total organic carbon and temperature. Furthermore, the study highlights total dissolved solids and nitrates as additional contributors to total mean trihalomethanes in drinking water sampled but found seasonal influence to be insignificant despite significant temperature influence.

40|$|Chlorination is used {{to prevent}} the spread of {{waterborne}} infectious diseases from swimming pools. This required disinfection practice also results in the formation of undesirable disinfection by-products (DBPs) from the reactions of chlorine with the organic matter (released by swimmers or present in the filling water of the pool) and bromide. Some of these DBPs have important adverse public health effects; as a result their concentrations in drinking waters are regulated. Unfortunately, DBPs formation and control in swimming pools have not been studied and investigated to the same extent as their formation and control in drinking water.

This fourth series consists of the following 15 additional compounds and compound groups: 1) metals: um, selenium, tellurium, thallium, tin; 2) aromatic hydrocarbons: monochloroanilines to pentachloroanilines, 4 -chloro-methylphenol; 3) chlorinated hydrocarbons: 1, 1, 2 -trichloroethane, dichloropropanes, 1, 1 -dichloroethene; 4) pesticides: MCPA and 5) other contaminants: <b>tribromomethane,</b> isopropanol, ethylacetate, 1, 2 -butylacetate. Intervention Values were derived by integrating the ecotoxicological and human-toxicological serious soil contamination concentration (ECOTOX SCC and HUM-TOX SCC, respectively). The HUM-TOX SCC is subject of this report and was derived using the CSOIL exposure model, the standard potential exposure data set, selected contaminant specific physicochemical input parameters and the Maximal Permissable Risk levels for human intake (MPRhuman).

40|$|Solid phase {{extraction}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} commonly used pre-concentration and cleanup steps in environmental science. However, traditional methods need electrically powered pumps, can use large volumes of solvent (if multiple samples are run), and require several hours to filter a sample. Additionally, if the cartridge is open to the air volatile compounds may be lost and sample integrity compromised. In contrast, micro cartridge based solid phase extraction can be completed in less than 2 min by hand, uses only microlitres of solvent and provides comparable concentration factors to established methods. It is also an enclosed system so volatile components are not lost. The sample can also be eluted directly into a detector (e. g. a mass spectrometer) if required. However, the technology is new and has not been much used for environmental analysis. In this study we compare traditional (macro) and the new micro solid phase extraction for the analysis of four common volatile trihalomethanes (trichloromethane, bromodichloromethane, dibromochloromethane and <b>tribromomethane).</b> The results demonstrate that micro solid phase extraction is faster and cheaper than traditional methods with similar recovery rates for the target compounds.

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} the subchronic toxicity of selected halomethanes which are drinking water contaminants. The compounds studied were trichloromethane, bromodichloromethane, dibromochloromethane and <b>tribromomethane.</b> Subchronic 14 -day gavage studies were {{performed with the}} use of doses encompassing one-tenth the LD 50 for the compounds. A 90 -day gavage study of one of the compounds, trichloromethane, was also done. Parameters observed included body and organ weights, histopathology, hematology, clinical chemistries, and hepatic microsomal enzyme activities. Toxicity to the humoral immune system was assessed by measuring the number of splenic IgM antibody-forming cells and the serum antibody level to sheep erythrocytes. Cell-mediated immunity was evaluated by measuring the delayed type hypersensitivity response and popliteal lymph node proliferation response to sheep red blood cells. The functional activity of the reticuloendothelial system, as measured by the vascular clearance rate and tissue uptake of 51 Cr sheep red blood cells was also determined. The major effects of the halomethanes were increased liver weights, elevations of SGPT and SGOT, decreased spleen weights and a {{decrease in the number of}} splenic IgM antibody-forming cells. The humoral immune system appeared to be an indicator of halomethane toxicity. There is evidence that subchronic 14 -day exposure may be of greater value than long-term studies in determining the toxicity of these compounds...|$|E

The process can however, {{result in the}} formation of toxic compounds through interactions between disinfectants and organic material in the source water. These new compounds are termed disinfection by-products (DBPs). The most common are the trihalomethanes (THMs) such as trichloromethane (chloroform), dichlorobromomethane, chlorodibromomethane and <b>tribromomethane</b> (bromoform); these are commonly reported as a single value for total trihalomethanes (TTHMs). Analysis of DBPs is commonly performed via time- and solvent-intensive sample preparation techniques such as liquid-liquid and solid phase extraction. In this study, a method using headspace gas chromatography with micro-electron capture detection was developed and applied for the analysis of THMs in drinking and recycled waters from across Melbourne (Victoria, Australia). The method allowed almost complete removal of the sample preparation step whilst maintaining trace level detection limits (> 1 ppb). All drinking water samples had TTHM concentrations below the Australian regulatory limit of 250 µg/L but some were above the U. S. EPA limit of 60 µg/L. The highest TTHM concentration was 67. 2 µg/L and lowest 22. 9 µg/L.

40|$|There have {{recently}} been published {{a number of papers}} reporting the deuterium quadrupole coupling constants (QCC) of small molecules dissolved in liquid-crystalline media (1 - 5). The results presented show, in many instances, wide variations in QCC values determined by different groups. These differences can be mainly attributed to the presence of different solvent-solute interactions in different liquid-crystal phases. Other causes of the range of values found arise from the difficulty in choosing appropriate bond lengths and making vibrational corrections to the dipolar couplings. Such uncertainties have led to some puzzling anomalies. For example, with the deuterohalomethanes, <b>tribromomethane</b> appears to have a considerably larger QCC than either trichloromethane or triiodomethane. These results have prompted us to determine the QCC values for deuterotrihalomethanes, C!HX 3 (X = Cl, Br, or I), and dideuterodihalomethanes, C 2 H 2 X 2, using solid-state deuterium quadrupole spin-echo techniques (6). Such measurements, at least for the di- and trihalomethanes, do not suffer so severely from uncertainties due to solvent effects, arising, for example, from the use of various liquid crystals containing aromatic and other more polar groups, or to uncertainties in bond lengths, vibrational averaging, and unknown electric field gradient asymmetry parameters.

While there is controversy of the THMs as percentage of TOX, in an extensive study, effects of 3 pH values, 3 reaction times and 4 bromide concentrations on the formation of 4 THMs, trichloromethane (TCM), dicholorobromomethane (DCBM), dibromochloromethane (DBCM) and <b>tribromomethane</b> (TBM) as percentage of TOX have been evaluated.

The chloro- or bromo-nitrosoarenes also formed dimeric radical-anions possibly of a semi-diazoxide structure [ArN(O·) N(O -) Ar]. The radical-anions of fluoro-substituted nitrosoarenes were not detected either through alternative reaction on the ring or because the azoxy-derivative and further reduction products were favoured in the equilibrium with the nitroso-radical-anion.

In addition to currently regulated DBPs including N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA), DBPs that were reported as high priority due to potential toxicity were studied. These priority DBPs included five iodinated trihalomethanes (THMs), four haloacetonitriles (HANs), two haloketones (HK), chloronitromethane and chloral hydrate (CH). Results showed that all the measured regulated DBPs including CH were below the Australian Drinking Water Guidelines (ADWG) recommendations. THM speciation followed the order trichloromethane (TCM) > bromodichloromethane (BDCM) > dibromochloromethane (DBCM) > <b>tribromomethane</b> (TBM) in waters provided by the Capalaba WTP. The order was DBCM>BCDM>TBM>TCM for waters provided by the North Stradbroke Island (NSI) WTP {{as a result of}} different dissolved organic carbon/bromide (DOC/Br) ratios.

The diurnal cycles contained three phases; a productive phase, a phase of losses and a phase with steady state. The duration of the different phases varied for the different stations {{as well as for}} individual compounds. The measured production and losses of organo-halogens in the Antarctic Ocean based on values from each station, were in the order of a few to hundreds of Tg yr(- 1). Bromochloromethane, <b>tribromomethane,</b> trichloroethene and diiodomethane were the four compounds found in highest concentrations throughout the investigation, and they were found to be the major contributors of organohalogens. Only the presence of the photosynthetic pigment 19 '-hexanoyloxyfucoxanthin, biomarker pigment of haptophytes, could explain some of the variations in the distribution and production of halocarbons, and then only for iodinated compounds. The flux of organo-halogens from the oceans to the atmosphere was estimated in two ways, either based on calculations according to models or based on the measured concentrations. Large discrepancies were found, which could not be explained by chemical or biological degradation or adsorption to particles.

Recently polluted air, clean marine air derived from the central Pacific Ocean from different latitudes, and marine air from the Indonesian archipelago were collected. Tetrachloroethene and trichloroethene of anthropogenic origin, brominated halocarbons as <b>tribromomethane,</b> dibromochloromethane and bromodichloromethane of anthropogenic and natural sources, and other trace gases were measured in the air samples. Very sparse data {{on the distribution of}} these compounds exist for the western Pacific atmosphere.

Anthropogenic and natural sources for both chlorinated and brominated substances were identified. Tetrachloroethene and trichloroethene concentrations and their ratios identify anthropogenic sources. Their mixing ratios were quite low compared to previously published data. They are in agreement with expected low concentrations of photochemically active substances during autumn, with an overall decrease in concentrations toward lower latitudes, and with a decrease of emissions during recent years. Strong evidence for a natural source of trichloroethene was discovered in the tropical region. The concentrations of naturally released brominated species were high compared to other measurements over the Pacific.

The ED 50 for acute effects on a screen test of motor performance was about 500 mg/kg for all four trihalomethanes. The 14 -day treatments had no effect on swimming behavior and the 90 -day treatments had no effect on bar clinging, a test of motor coordination, and a measure of exploratory behavior. None of the compounds produced effects on passive-avoidance learning following 100 mg/kg/day for 30 days. TCM, DBCM and TBM elicited clear effects at both 100 and 400 mg/kg/day on operant behavior when administered for 60 days. DBCM elicited clear effects at 400 mg/kg/day. These effects on operant behavior were seen following the first dose and tolerance tended to develop. Thus, there was no evidence from these studies for a progressive neurotoxicity from trihalomethanes in adult mice. A behavioral teratology study was also conducted with TCM. Both parents were treated with 31. 1 mg/kg/day TCM, and treatment of the dam continued throughout gestation and lactation. No clear evidence for behavioral effects in the offspring were observed.

High correlation coefﬁcients were obtained for the calibration lines in water with detection limits of 0. 2 µg/L for trichloromethane (TCM) and bromodichloromethane (BDCM), 0. 1 µg/L for dibromochloromethane (DBCM) and 0. 5 µg/L for <b>tribromomethane</b> (TBM). Coef-ﬁcients of variation values were 5 – 10 % for repeatability and 15 – 25 % for reproducibility. In air analysis, high correlation coefﬁcients were also obtained for the calibration lines with detection limits of 2. 5 µg/m 3 for TCM and BDCM and 1. 25 µg/m 3 for DBCM and TBM. Repeatability and reproducibility coefﬁcients of variation {{were the same as}} in water analysis. Analytical results from a survey in four Portuguese ISPs showed that the mean concentration of total trihalomethanes (TTHMs) in water ranged from 22 ± 2 to 577 ± 58 µg/L. In the lack of European speciﬁc regulation for THMs in water from ISPs and taking into consideration that ingestion is a form of exposure, TTHMs’ values were compared with European drinking water maximum contamination level (100 µg/L, Directive 98 / 83 /CE). From the reported TTHMs mean concentration values in ISPs’ water, 40 % exceeded that value. TTHMs values determined in the air (T = 30 ◦C) ranged from 98 ± 10 to 1225 ± 123 µg/m 3 andfrom 51 ± 5 µg/m 3 to 519 ± 52 µg/m 3 at 5 and 150 cm above the water surface, respectively. As expected, swimmers are more exposed to high concentrations of THMs than lifeguards. As there is no European speciﬁc regulation for THMs in ISPs’ air, the highest TCM values were compared with maximum values reported in the literature for ISPs (1630 µg/m 3) and with the inhalation exposure limit (10, 000 µg/m 3) established for TCM by European occupational legislation (Directive 2000 / 39 /CE). info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|E

Half of the cells were immediately analyzed for DNA SB and half were transferred into fresh culture medium and incubated for an additional 22 hr before testing for DNA SB. PRH were exposed to individual THMs for 4 hr then assayed for DNA SB. F 344 /N rats were exposed to individual THMs for 4 hr, 2 weeks, and to BDCM for 5 wk then tested for DNA SB. Results CCRF-CEM cells exposed to 5 - or 10 -mM brominated THMs for 2 hr produced DNA SB. The order of activity was TBM>DBCM>BDCM; TCM was inactive. Following a 22 -hr recovery period, all groups had fewer SB except 10 -mM DBCM and 1 -mM TBM. CCRF-CEM cells were found to be positive for the GSTT 1 - 1 gene, however no activity was detected. No DNA SB, unassociated with cytotoxicity, were observed in PRH or F 344 /N rats exposed to individual THMs. Conclusion CCRF-CEM cells exposed to the brominated THMs at 5 or 10 mM for 2 hr showed a significant increase in DNA SB when compared to control cells. Additionally, CCRF-CEM cells exposed to DBCM and TBM appeared to have compromised DNA repair capacity as demonstrated by an increased amount of DNA SB at 22 hr following exposure. CCRF-CEM cells were found to be positive for the GSTT 1 - 1 gene, however no activity was detected. No DNA SB were observed in PRH or F 344 /N rats exposed to individual THMs. </p...|$|E
40|$|The pearl river delta (PRD) {{region is}} one of the most {{important}} industrial and manufacturing centers of China and the world. In order to explore the regional mixing ratios of halocarbons in the PRD atmosphere and to reconcile the major halocarbon emission sources, air samples were collected in an urban site in Guangzhou City, a semi-urban site in Panyu and a rural site on Dinghu Mountain, as well as roadside sites and vehicular tunnels of the PRD in 2001 and 2004. The samples were analyzed for a variety of carbon-containing compounds. The results revealed elevated regional mixing ratios of most halocarbons, especially trichloroethene (C 2 HCl 3), methyl iodide (CH 3 I), tetrachloroethene (C 2 Cl 4), bromochlorodifluoromethane (Halon- 1211, CBrClF 2), 1 -dichloro- 1, 1 -fluoroethane (HCFC- 142 b, CH 3 CClF 2) and trichloromethane (CHCl 3) when compared with the background levels of the western Pacific and East Asian coast, and the Northern Hemisphere suggesting that there are significant sources of halocarbons in the PRD region. Higher dichlorodifluoromethane (CFC- 12, CCl 2 F 2), 1, 1, 1 -trichlorotrifluoroethane (CFC- 113, CCl 2 FCClF 2), dibromomethane (CH 2 Br 2) and <b>tribromomethane</b> (CHBr 3) mixing ratios were found in the tunnels and roadside samples when compared with the ambient samples. In these samples, CH 2 Br 2 and CHBr 3 correlated well with each other and methyl bromide (CH 3 Br) suggesting they are associated with exhaust emissions from vehicles running on leaded gasoline. High levels of methyl halides: methyl chloride (CH 3 Cl), CH 3 Br and CH 3 I, and CH 2 Br 2, bromodichloromethane (CHBrCl 2), CHBr 3 and dimethyl sulfide (C 2 H 6 S, DMS) were simultaneously observed in the oceanic air masses that originated from the coastal areas of southeast China and had passed over the Pearl River Estuary. Good correlations were found between CH 2 Br 2 and CHBr 3 with linear regression slopes of 0. 17 and 0. 15 for the Dinghu Mountain and Guangzhou City samples, respectively, and between CH 3 I and CHBr 3, and DMS suggesting that emissions from the coastal territorial ecosystems of the PRD are important sources of the methyl halides, CH 2 Br 2, CHBrCl 2, CHBr 3 and DMS observed.

40|$|Il est admis aujourd'hui que la génotoxicité identifiée dans les extraits d'eau potable provient principalement de l'action du chlore sur la matière organique naturelle qui donne naissance à des dérivés organohalogénés. Dans le présent travail, nous avons comparé la sensibilité de trois essais de génotoxicité (SOS chromotest, test d'Ames-fluctuation et test micronoyau triton) lors de l'étude de composés organohalogénés, d'acides fulviques chlorés et d'échantillons d'eau (non concentrés) en cours de {{traitement}} de potabilisation. Les composés organohalogénés étudiés sont 4 trihalométhanes, 5 acétonitriles et 5 chloropropanones identifiés dans l'eau potable ou dans des solutions de substances humiques chlorées. Les résultats obtenus révèlent que le SOS chromotest est globalement le moins sensible des trois essais et que le test d'Ames-fluctuation et le test micronoyau triton permettent généralement de détecter les plus faibles concentrations de composés génotoxiques. Les essais ont également permis de démontrer que {{la nature}} des substituants halogénés (brome ou chlore), le nombre et la position des atomes de chlore influencent notablement la génotoxicité des composés organohalogénés. Toutefois, les résultats obtenus indiquent qu'aucun des trois tests réalisés n'est suffisant à lui seul pour détecter l'ensemble des produits génotoxiques. Ces observations confirment la nécessité de réaliser une batterie de tests qui mette en oeuvre divers types cellulaires et différents systèmes de métabolisation, et détecte divers évènements de génotoxicité. Les travaux portant sur les solutions concentrées d'acides fulviques chlorés montrent l'intérêt des essais sur bactéries (particulièrement le test d'Ames-fluctuation) pour la détection rapide de l'activité génotoxique de ces solutions. L'étude concemant les échantillons d'eau prélevés à différents niveaux d'une station de potabilisation, et analysés sans concentration préalable, indique que le test d'Ames- fluctuation est le seul capable de détecter une activité génotoxique dans les échantillons non concentrés étudiés. On montre, conformément à la littérature, que l'activité mutagène observée résulte de la chloration de l'eau. Since {{the identification of}} organohalides in drinking water in 1974, several investigators have detected genotoxic activity in drinking water concentrates. It is now widely admitted that the observed genotoxicity originates mainly from the reaction of chlorine on natural organic matter contained in the raw water, {{which leads to the}} formation of organohalogenated compounds. The aim {{of this study is to}} show the benefit of three short-term assays for the evaluation of the genotoxic potency of organohalogenated compounds and of complex mixtures. In a wider context, the purpose is to identify a test or a battery of tests that can contribute to the control of natural and drinking water genotoxicity. The three genotoxicity assays carried out during this work were:- the SOS chromotest, a primary DNA damage in vitro assay on Escherichia coli; - the Ames- fluctuation test, a point mutation in vitro assay on Salmonella typhimurium; - and the newt micronucleus test, a chromosomal aberration in vivo assay on the amphibian Pleurodeles waltl. These assays display a valuable advantage: the water samples under study can be analyzed without concentration prior to testing. Thus, the different concentration procedures, which may modify the original genotoxicity of the water samples, are avoided. A previous study on seven reference genotoxic chemicals had indicated that the SOS chromotest was never the most sensitive of the three tests (for a given chemical, the most sensitive assay is defined as the test which detects the lowest concentration inducing a significant genotoxic effect). On the contrary, the Ames-fluctuation test proved to be the most sensitive for compounds showing direct genotoxic activity, and the newt micronucleus test the most sensitive for chemicals with indirect genotoxic effects. None of the assays was the most sensitive for every substance analyzed. These observations suggested the need to implement a battery of tests using several cell types, different metabolization systems and detecting several genotoxicity events. This earlier study also showed, in accord with several results in the literature, that the Ames-fluctuation test (in liquid medium) demonstrated a better sensitivity than the Ames test (in agar solid medium). The first part of the present study involved testing the genotoxicity of 14 organo- halogenated compounds identified in drinking water samples or in chlorinated humic matter samples. The chemicals studied were four chlorinated and/or brominated trihalomethanes (trichloro-, bromodichloro-, chlorodibromo- and <b>tribromomethane),</b> five chlorinated or brominated acetonitriles with one, two or three halogens (monochloro-, dichloro-, trichloro-, monobromo- and dibromoacetonitrile) and five chlorinated propanones with one, two or three substitutions on one or two carbon atoms (monochloro-, 1, 1 -dichloro-, 1, 3 -dichloro-, 1, 1, 1 -trichloro- and 1, 1, 3 - trichloropropanone). Although the SOS chromotest was the most sensitive for 3 of the 14 substances analyzed, the results confirmed that this test was globally the least sensitive; the Ames-fluctuation test and the newt micronucleus test remained the most efficient assays. It is interesting to note that the Ames-fluctuation test appeared the most sensitive for all the chloropropanones tested and the newt micronucleus test, for all the haloacetonitriles analyzed. Moreover, several structure-activity relationships were demonstrated: the nature of the halogenated substituents (bromine or chlorine), the number and, above all, the position of chlorine atoms strongly influenced the genotoxicity of the organohalides studied. In the second part of the work we analyzed the effects of complex mixtures containing several organohalogenated compounds: the three tests were performed on two chlorinated fulvic acids of different origin. Pornic fulvic acid was extracted from a surface water reservoir used to produce drinking water in Vendée (France) and Pinail fulvic acid came from a forest pond near Poitiers (France). The total organic carbon was about 1 g/l in the solution subjected to chlorination and the molar chlorination ratio was 1. 5 Cl 2 /C. The results showed the advantage of tests using bacteria: the Ames fluctuation test was the only assay able to detect the genotoxicity of both chlorinated fulvic acids; the SOS chromotest detected the genotoxic effect of only one of the chlorinated fulvic acids (Pinail). In contrast, the newt micronucleus test did not show any genotoxicity of the chlorinated fulvic acids. However, it must be pointed out that, as insufficient fulvic acid was available, the genotoxic potency of these solutions on the newt was not tested under adequate conditions (e. g., subchronic concentrations were not studied). Nevertheless, the concentrations of fulvic acid analyzed were very close to those found in the aquatic environment. The last part of the study attempted to approximate environmental and human exposure conditions: the three tests were performed on four water samples taken at several stages of a drinking water treatment plant. These samples were analyzed for genotoxicity in the three test systems without preconcentration. The plant studied is characterized by the following treatment steps: - coagulation-flocculation; - chlorination at 6 g Cl 2 /m 3; - sand filtration; - ozonation at 1. 9 g O 3 /m 3; - final chlorination at 1. 4 g Cl 2 /m 3 before sending the treated water into the distribution system. The four samples were taken: 1. before any treatment (raw water, 10 to 13 mg total organic carbon per liter), 2. between the sand layer filter and the ozonator (chlorinated water), 3. after the ozonator (ozonated water), 4. and at the end of the treatment process (treated water). The results obtained confirmed the advantage of the Ames fluctuation test, which was the only assay able to detect a genotoxic activity in the unconcentrated water samples studied. Regarding the influence of the different chemical treatments on the mutagenicity observed, it was demonstrated that the first chlorination step led to the formation of direct-acting mutagens. The treatment with ozone, at the rate used, did not significantly modify the mutagenicity of the samples that had previously been chlorinated. Similarly, the second chlorination step did not significantly increase the direct mutagenicity detected. Practically, our study indicated that the Ames-fluctuation test is the only assay, among the three performed that is able to contribute efficiently to the control of drinking water genotoxicity. In this context, the benefit of the SOS chromotest appears only in case of accidental pollution: indeed, it is the only test able to yield results within 24 hours. The implementation of the newt micronucleus test could be useful for the control of natural or drinking water genotoxicity in case of extensive pollution...|$|E
