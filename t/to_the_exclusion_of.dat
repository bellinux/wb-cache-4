5|$|In Flint v.

5|$|Although the June 28, 1969, Stonewall riots are {{generally}} considered {{the starting point}} of the modern gay liberation movement, a number of demonstrations and actions took place before that date.

5|$|Botanists in the 20th century {{recognised}} B.oblongifolia as {{a species}} in its own right, but disagreed on the name. Those in Queensland felt Salisbury's name was invalid and used Banksia oblongifolia, while New South Wales authorities used Banksia aspleniifolia {{as it was the}} oldest published name for the species. Botanist and banksia authority Alex George ruled that oblongifolia was the correct name in his 1981 revision of the genus. After reviewing Salisbury's original species description, which is of the leaves alone, he concluded that it does not diagnose the species <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>exclusion</b> <b>of</b> others and is hence not a validly published name—the description could have applied to juvenile leaves of B.paludosa, B.integrifolia or even B.marginata.|$|E

5|$|Limusaurus was {{originally}} {{described as a}} basal ceratosaurian, with both it and Elaphrosaurus being recovered as the most basal ceratosaurians in various phylogenetic analyses. However, subsequent research has placed it in the more derived group Abelisauroidea, specifically {{as a member of}} the Noasauridae. An analysis conducted in the study of multiple individuals of different ages found Limusaurus and Elaphrosaurus to group in the clade Elaphrosaurinae, within the family Nodosauridae. Nodosauridae was placed in a position outside Neoceratosauria, the group containing Ceratosaurus and Abelisauridae. The phylogenetics within Noasauridae, from the version of the analysis with separate specimens of Limusaurus, are shown below. It is notable that all the juvenile specimens grouped <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>exclusion</b> <b>of</b> adult specimens, showing that its anatomy changed significantly through growth.|$|E
5|$|Liu {{and colleagues}} {{conducted}} a separate phylogenetic analysis in 2017. They criticized {{the analysis of}} Rieppel and colleagues as having unnecessarily repeated several characters in their data, thus imbuing the repeated characters with undue weight in the analysis. In their own analysis, Liu and colleagues used the same source datasets, but deleted repeated characters, added two new characters from an analysis by Sean Modesto and Hans-Dieter Sues (2004), and removed poorly preserved or potentially chimeric taxa such as Cosesaurus, Kadimakara, Trachelosaurus, and Malerisaurus. Analyses based on parsimony-based and Bayesian methods found that Dinocephalosaurus {{was a member of}} the Tanystropheidae, being the sister group to a clade containing Tanystropheus, Macrocnemus, Langobardisaurus, and Tanytrachelos. The analyses also recovered a monophyletic Protorosauria, albeit <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>exclusion</b> <b>of</b> Prolacerta.

5|$|Several phylogenetic studies {{published}} {{during the}} 1990s and 2000s supported {{a close relationship}} between Pseudoryzomys and two other oryzomyines with reduced or absent mesoloph(id)s, Lundomys and Holochilus. The extinct genera Noronhomys and Carletonomys, described in 1999 and 2008 respectively, were also recognized {{as members of the}} group. In 2006, a broad morphological and molecular phylogenetic study of Oryzomyini provided further support for the relationship between Holochilus, Lundomys, and Pseudoryzomys. Within this group, morphological data supported a closer relationship between Holochilus and Lundomys <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>exclusion</b> <b>of</b> Pseudoryzomys, but DNA sequence data favored a clustering between Holochilus and Pseudoryzomys <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>exclusion</b> <b>of</b> Lundomys; among all oryzomyines, this was the only case where relationships which received strong support from morphological and DNA sequence data conflicted. Together, the three genera form part of a large group of oryzomyines ("clade D"), which contains tens of other species. Several of those display some adaptations to life in the water, being partially aquatic, as do Pseudoryzomys and its relatives. Morphological data indicate that the genus Oryzomys is the closest relative of the group that includes Pseudoryzomys, but DNA sequence data from the nuclear IRBP gene did not support this relationship; convergent adaptations towards a semiaquatic lifestyle may explain the morphological support for a relation between Oryzomys and the other three genera.|$|E
