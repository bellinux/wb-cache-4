40|$|Abstract In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} the relation between beliefs and goals in agent theory. Beliefs play three roles in reasoning about goals: <b>they</b> <b>play</b> <b>a</b> role in the generation of unconditional desires from conditional ones, <b>they</b> <b>play</b> <b>a</b> role in adoption of desires as goals, and <b>they</b> <b>play</b> <b>a</b> role {{in the selection of}} plans to achieve goals. In this paper {{we consider the}} role of goals in reasoning about beliefs. Though we assume that goals do not <b>play</b> <b>a</b> role in the belief generation problem, we argue that <b>they</b> <b>play</b> <b>a</b> role in the belief selection problem. We show the rationality of the use of goals in belief selection, in the sense that there are cases in which agents that take their goals into account in selecting a belief set from a set of alternatives outperform agents that do not do so. We also formally distinguish between the rational role of goals in belief selection and irrational wishful thinking...|$|R

5|$|Argentina was a {{fragmented}} nation (since the 1852 downfall of Argentine dictator Juan Manuel de Rosas), with the Argentine Confederation and the State of Buenos Aires each vying for supremacy. Flores approached the Buenos Aires Minister of War, Bartolomé Mitre, agreeing {{to throw the}} support of the Colorados behind Buenos Aires in exchange for subsequent Argentine assistance in their fight against the fusionist government in Montevideo (the Uruguayan capital). Flores and his Colorado units served Buenos Aires with fierce determination. <b>They</b> <b>played</b> <b>a</b> decisive role in the Battle of Pavón on 17 September 1861, in which the Confederation was defeated and all Argentina was reunited under the government in Buenos Aires.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal {{were missing}} defender Sol Campbell from their team {{after the death}} of his father, and manager Arsène Wenger dropped wingers Robert Pirès and Sylvain Wiltord in favour of Ray Parlour and Fredrik Ljungberg, {{creating}} a more physical midfield. Wenger's tactics worked, as the Arsenal defence withstood the pressure from the Manchester United attack. United themselves were without Paul Scholes due to injury, and <b>they</b> <b>played</b> <b>a</b> 4–3–2–1 formation with Phil Neville, Roy Keane and Quinton Fortune completing a defensively minded midfield.|$|E

5|$|Because of its {{popularity}} and exposure, the Flying Spaghetti Monster {{is often used}} as a contemporary version of Russell's teapot—an argument that the philosophic burden of proof lies upon those who make unfalsifiable claims, not on those who reject them. Pastafarianism has received praise from the scientific community and criticism from proponents of intelligent design. Pastafarians have engaged in disputes with creationists, including in Polk County, Florida, where <b>they</b> <b>played</b> <b>a</b> role in dissuading the local school board from adopting new rules on teaching evolution.|$|E
5|$|Electrons are {{important}} in cathode ray tubes, which have been extensively used as display devices in laboratory instruments, computer monitors and television sets. In a photomultiplier tube, every photon striking the photocathode initiates an avalanche of electrons that produces a detectable current pulse. Vacuum tubes use the flow of electrons to manipulate electrical signals, and <b>they</b> <b>played</b> <b>a</b> {{critical role in the}} development of electronics technology. However, they have been largely supplanted by solid-state devices such as the transistor.|$|E

In 1962, under the captaincy of Javed Burki, Pakistan visited England where <b>they</b> <b>played</b> <b>a</b> five Test match series. In the fifth Test at Headingley, a low scoring match for Pakistan, Alimuddin's scores of 50 and 60 made him the team's highest scorer of the match. In the fifth Test of the home series against England in 1962, he scored his career best 109 runs at the National Stadium.

5|$|At one tour date in England, the {{tensions}} {{came to a}} head when Ryan Pope confronted Pryor over his recent despondence, leading to a band meeting where Pryor confessed his desire to reduce his commitment {{to the rest of the}} group. After some discussion, the band agreed that their hearts were no longer in it and at the end of the tour they would quietly end the band. Once the tour ended, the band went on an unofficial hiatus, not playing as a group until the next January, when <b>they</b> <b>played</b> <b>a</b> show at the Granada Theater in Lawrence, Kansas to celebrate the band's tenth anniversary. The show was recorded and released the following May as the band's first live album, Live! @ The Granada Theater.|$|E

5|$|Djokovic is {{the only}} player besides Nadal to defeat Federer in {{consecutive}} Grand Slam tournaments (2010 US Open and 2011 Australian Open), and the only player besides Nadal and Murray who has double-figure career wins over Federer.

Between 2007–2011 <b>they</b> <b>played</b> <b>a</b> record five times at the US Open (tied with Lendl–McEnroe and Connors–Lendl), with Federer winning the first three and Djokovic the last two.

5|$|During {{the peak}} {{popularity}} of the breed, three main types could be distinguished. All three are now considered extinct, having disappeared or been merged back into the main Canadian horse population. The first, the Canadian Heavy Draft or St. Lawrence, which disappeared by the late 1700s, probably developed from Shire and Clydesdale crosses. They were probably a popular export to New England, which bred large numbers of horses for Caribbean plantations. The second, the Frencher, sometimes also called the St. Lawrence, was a trotting horse known for its power and speed, resulting from crosses with Thoroughbreds. Mixed with French trotting lines, <b>they</b> <b>played</b> <b>a</b> {{role in the development}} of the US trotting horses.|$|E
5|$|Guitarist Eddie Reyes, who {{had played}} in The Movielife, Mind Over Matter and Inside, and guitarist Jesse Lacey of the Rookie Lot founded Taking Back Sunday in Amityville, New York in November 1999. Lacey moved to bass with the {{addition}} of guitarist John Nolan. The group also included vocalist Antonio Longo of One True Thing and drummer Steven DeJoseph. At a party, Nolan reportedly romanced Lacey's girlfriend, after which Lacey left the band. Lacey formed Brand New a year later. Nolan contacted Adam Lazzara to fill in on bass, which resulted in Lazzara moving from North Carolina to New York. Lazzara had met the band when <b>they</b> <b>played</b> <b>a</b> show near his hometown in North Carolina.|$|E
