25|$|There is also {{a marked}} {{difference}} between dextromethorphan hydrobromide, contained in most cough suppressant preparations, and dextromethorphan polistirex, contained in the brand name preparation Delsym. Polistirex is a polymer that is bonded to the dextromethorphan that requires more time for the stomach to digest it as it requires that an ion exchange reaction take place prior to its dissolution into the blood. Because of this, dextromethorphan polistirex takes considerably longer to absorb, resulting in more gradual and longer lasting effects reminiscent of <b>time</b> <b>release</b> pills. As a cough suppressant, the polistirex version lasts up to 12 hours. This duration also holds true when used recreationally.|$|E

25|$|Anna is {{featured}} as Nina's sub-boss {{in the original}} Tekken game and did not become a playable character until the console version of the game. She is Nina's sub-boss in the other Tekken games as well, except for Tekken 4, {{the only game in}} the Tekken series in which she does not appear. In Tekken 5 her sub-boss is Lee Chaolan, and she is also a sub-boss for Craig Marduk. She is also the final boss of Death by Degrees. In most games she is in, she usually only appears as an unlockable/time-release character, though Tekken Tag Tournament notably makes her a default character, and Tekken 6 and Tekken Tag Tournament 2 do away with the <b>time</b> <b>release</b> system entirely, making everyone playable on launch.|$|E
2500|$|... is a Japanese {{pop music}} idol duo which formed in 2009 with singers Clara and Alice from Hokkaido, {{who were in}} junior high school at the time. The pair began singing covers and {{submitting}} them to the Niconico video sharing website between 2009 and 2010. ClariS later signed to SME Records and released their debut single [...] "Irony" [...] in October 2010. Three more singles were released between 2011 and 2012, followed by their debut album Birthday (2012). Birthday was awarded a Gold Disc by the Recording Industry Association of Japan for having exceeded 100,000 copies shipped in a single year. Six more singles were released between 2012 and 2014, which were featured on their second album Second Story (2013) and third album Party Time (2014). Alice left the unit following Party <b>Time</b> <b>release,</b> and Karen joined ClariS in late 2014. ClariS moved to the Sacra Music record label under Sony Music Entertainment Japan in 2017.|$|E
60|$|But in {{connection}} with this distribution I have laid myself open to another potential mistake. In speaking of a sweeping redistribution, I speak of decision in the aim, not necessarily of abruptness in the means. It is not at all too late to restore an approximately rational state of English possessions without any mere confiscation. A policy of buying out landlordism, steadily adopted in England as it has already been adopted in Ireland (notably in Mr. Wyndham's wise and fruitful Act), would in a very short <b>time</b> <b>release</b> {{the lower end of the}} see-saw and make the whole plank swing more level. The objection to this course is not at all that it would not do, only that it will not be done. If we leave things as they are, there will almost certainly be a crash of confiscation. If we hesitate, we shall soon have to hurry. But if we start doing it quickly we have still time to do it slowly.|$|E

Methinks that the Kerr's hold may more easily be made to withstand a lengthened siege than Glen Cairn, seeing that the latter is commanded by the hill beside it. Kerr's castle, too, is much larger and more strongly fortified. I need no thanks," [...] he continued, as Archie was about to express his warm gratitude; [...] "it is the Warden of Scotland who rewards your services to the country; but Sir William Wallace will not forget how you have twice stood beside him against overwhelming odds, and how yesterday, in Stirling, it was your watchful care and thoughtful precaution which alone saved his life." ...|$|E
