5|$|The {{country is}} one vast wilderness, blasted out of {{recognition}} where once villages & orchards & fertile land, now tossed about & churned in hopeless disorder with never a landmark {{as far as}} the eye can reach & dotted about in <b>the</b> <b>scrub</b> and untidiness of it all are to be seen here & there singly & in groups little white crosses marking the place where men have fallen and been buried.|$|E
5|$|The {{site was}} {{once part of}} the estate linked to Clevedon Court. It is now managed via a Higher Level Stewardship {{agreement}} between the National Trust and Natural England. This has involved removing trees whose roots are growing into the earthen banks of the site. In particular non native Turkey Oaks, which provide a habitat for damaging Gall wasps, are being removed. Cattle are also being used to manage <b>the</b> <b>scrub</b> and encourage the growth of flowers such as orchids.|$|E
5|$|Among scarce plants {{found on}} Sand Point are smallflower buttercup, and honewort. The range of soils {{at the site}} support various flora and fauna. The {{calcareous}} grassland is dominated by Festuca species and Dactylis glomerata, while <b>the</b> <b>scrub</b> towards {{the west of the}} site is dominated by hawthorn (Crataegus monogyna) and blackthorn (Prunus spinosa), while that to the east consists of common gorse (Ulex europaeus) and bramble (Rubus fruticosus agg). Less common plants include the cheddar pink (Dianthus gratianopolitanus) and Somerset hair grass (Koeleria vallesiana).|$|E

5|$|Hearing {{the shots}} from the {{northern}} side of the river, Forbes uneasily moved towards the southern bank, intending to cross and help Wilson. However, Forbes's fears of an ambush proved to be well-founded; at an opportune moment, the Matabele in <b>the</b> <b>scrub</b> opened fire, catching the column in the open. The ambushers' shots were initially wild and inaccurate, but they soon began to focus their fire on the exposed Maxim guns and horses, forcing the troopers to retreat to cover. Five Company soldiers were injured. The resulting skirmish lasted about an hour, by which time the Shangani had been severely swollen by heavy rains upstream, causing it to flood.|$|E
5|$|The 15th Infantry Battalion {{arrived at}} ANZAC Cove {{on the evening}} of Anzac Day, 25 April 1915. Cannan was sent with half of his {{battalion}} to fill the gap between the 2nd and 3rd Infantry Brigades. Moving in the dark through the thick scrub of the Razorback, the 15th found in <b>the</b> <b>scrub</b> the empty positions that it was sent to fill. The 15th Infantry Battalion was soon switched to Quinn's Post, one of the most exposed parts of the Anzac perimeter, with Cannan becoming post commander.|$|E
5|$|Of the British troops, {{approximately}} 3,300 {{formed into}} a shallow horseshoe formation that {{stretched across the}} width of the Plains, the main firing line being roughly one kilometre long. Two battalions were deployed, facing north, to cover the left flank and a further two formed a reserve. In order to cover the entire plain, Wolfe was forced to array his soldiers two ranks deep, rather than the more conventional three ranks. On the left wing, regiments under Townshend exchanged fire with the militia in <b>the</b> <b>scrub</b> and captured a small collection of houses and gristmill to anchor the line. The defenders pushed the British from one house, but were repelled and, in retreat, lit several houses on fire {{to keep them out of}} enemy hands. Smoke from these fires wound up masking the British left, and may have confused Montcalm as to {{the width of the}} lines. As Wolfe's men waited for the defenders, the steady fire became intense enough that Wolfe ordered his men to lie down amid the high grass and brush.|$|E

5|$|Several {{groups of}} men {{eventually}} {{made their way}} to Pine Ridge. Among the first was Lieutenant Eric Plant's platoon from the 9th Battalion. Captain John Whitham's company of the 12th Battalion moved forward from Bolton's Ridge when they saw the 6th Battalion moving up behind them. As the 6th Battalion reached the ridge, the companies carried on towards Gun Ridge, while Lieutenant-Colonel Walter McNicoll established the battalion headquarters below Bolton's Ridge. As the 6th Battalion moved forward they were engaged by Turkish small arms and artillery fire, causing heavy casualties. At 10:00 brigade headquarters received a message from the 6th Battalion asking for reinforcement, and McCay sent half the 5th Battalion to assist. At the same time the 8th Battalion were digging in on Bolton's, except for two companies which moved forward to attack a group of Turks that had come up from the south behind the 6th Battalion. By noon the 8th Battalion was dug in on the ridge; in front of them were scattered remnants of the 5th, 6th, 7th, and 9th Battalions, mostly out of view of each other in <b>the</b> <b>scrub.</b> Shortly after, McCay was informed that if he wanted the 6th Battalion to hold its position, it must be reinforced. So McCay sent his last reserves, a company of the 1st Battalion, and ordered the 8th to leave one company on the ridge and advance on the right of the 6th Battalion. The scattered formations managed to hold their positions {{for the remainder of the}} afternoon, then at 17:00 saw large numbers of Turkish troops coming over the southern section of Gun Ridge.|$|E

40|$|One of {{characteristics}} of the rising cloud storage technology is low-cost and high reliability. A distinct benefit of disk scanning or scrubbing operation is identifying the potential failure sectors as early as possible, thus providing high reliability. Obviously, <b>the</b> higher <b>the</b> <b>scrubbing</b> frequency is, <b>the</b> higher the system reliability is. However, {{it may take a}} few hours for a scanning process to check the whole disk. In other words, <b>the</b> <b>scrubbing</b> process may result in a downtime or a lower system performance. Furthermore, <b>the</b> <b>scrubbing</b> process consumes energy. In order to reduce the impact of disk scrubbing on disk performance and energy consumption, system designers choose to scan the disk in a low frequency, which results in a lower reliability. Thus it is essential to design a good scrubbing scheme in a large scale storage system over long time horizons. In this paper, we present a novel scrubbing scheme to solve the challenge. In this scheme, an optimum scrubbing cycle is decided by keeping a balance between data loss cost, scrubbing cost, and disk failure rate. Our research shows how the data price and <b>the</b> <b>scrubbing</b> cost affect <b>scrubbing</b> frequency, and <b>the</b> <b>scrubbing</b> scheme is applicable for storage with inexpensive data. Our experiment shows that our scheme outperforms routine method 73. 3 % in cost and 40 % in reliability...|$|R
40|$|Models of dust {{collector}} for Nobori-gama (a uphill kiln for china) were constructed on the consignment of Okinawa Prefectural Office. Two types of scrubbing and electric {{dust collector}} models were built. Collection efficiency of <b>the</b> <b>scrubbing</b> dust collector was about 50 to 60 per cent. And large particles {{of the dust}} arisen from the combustion of heavy oil, among which the largest grain is to 2 or 3 mm diameter, were almost perfectly cleared by the equipment. Small particles about 10 μ or smaller, however, could not be collected by <b>the</b> <b>scrubbing.</b> Although electric collector is suit to such a small mist, its capacity is less than <b>the</b> <b>scrubbing</b> collector.

25|$|Sometimes the rufous-tailed scrub robin {{is found}} in {{association}} with a woodchat shrike (Lanius senator), perhaps nesting in a neighbouring tree.
