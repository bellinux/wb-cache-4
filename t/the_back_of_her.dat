5|$|Me and Juliet is {{a musical}} comedy by Richard Rodgers (music) and Oscar Hammerstein II (lyrics and book) and their sixth stage collaboration. The work {{tells a story}} of romance {{backstage}} at a long-running musical: assistant stage manager Larry woos chorus girl Jeanie behind <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> electrician boyfriend, Bob. Me and Juliet premiered in 1953 and was not considered a success, although it ran for much of a year on Broadway and returned a small profit to its backers.|$|E
5|$|Alex Krycek (Nicholas Lea) {{is seated}} in a chair in Assistant Director Walter Skinner's office, where he is shown a video from the morgue. Skinner tells him that Miles is somehow alive and still out to get Scully and her unborn child. Suddenly, Agent Gene Crane comes to Doggett and tells him {{that there is a}} person—Knowle Rohrer—who wants to see him, about issues {{concerning}} Miles and Scully. This leaves Fox Mulder and Skinner to interrogate Krycek. Rohrer fabricates a story to Doggett that Miles is part of a Military Project to create a super soldier and that Scully had a chip put in <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> neck during her abduction to make her pregnant with the first organic version of a super soldier.|$|E
5|$|Blood {{and urine}} samples {{indicated}} {{that she had}} taken the anti-psychotic drug haloperidol, and several days earlier had used cannabis. There were no marks on her body suggestive of a struggle. The firearms officer who first saw her said her feet and hands were clean, her fingernails manicured and not broken, and her fingertips free of blood, dirt or powder. There was no trace of lead dust. The rifle magazine would have been loaded at least twice during the killings; this would usually leave lubricant and material from the bullets on the hands. A scenes-of-crimes officer, DC Hammersley, said there were bloodstains on <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> right hand, but that otherwise her hands were clean.|$|E
50|$|When Reith {{checks his}} scout-boat, he discovers to his dismay {{that it has}} been gutted. Ylin-Ylan convinces him to take her back to technologically {{advanced}} Cath, where {{he might be able to}} build a ship with <b>the</b> <b>backing</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> wealthy father.|$|R
60|$|The younger lady {{looked down}} on her {{companion}} with something of the calm expert attention that a plumber gives to a tap that is misbehaving, and like a plumber refrained from precipitate action. She stood with <b>the</b> <b>backs</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> hands resting on her hips.|$|R
50|$|Marcella O'Donovan, {{one of the}} school's teachers, {{bought the}} school with <b>the</b> <b>backing</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> family in 1999. The O'Donovans oversaw the {{introduction}} of new courses to cater for the gap year and the amateur cook market, {{while at the same time}} maintaining the school's professional emphasis.|$|R
5|$|Both sexes reach sexual {{maturity}} at {{one year of}} age. The male mates with the female by swimming close to her with his head lowered and tail raised, continually whistling. If there {{is a group of}} males, they will chase the female in flight until only one drake is left. The female prepares for copulation, which takes place in the water, by lowering her body; the male then bobs his head up and down and mounts the female, taking the feathers on <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> head in his mouth. After mating, he raises his head and back and whistles.|$|E
5|$|Melvin Frohike visits Scully's {{apartment}} and shows her {{a newspaper article}} about Kenneth Soona's murder. When she returns to FBI headquarters, the metal detector curiously goes off. Scully presents Skinner with the newspaper article, thinking that the data from Soona's death can clear Mulder in his father's murder. Skinner, however, refuses to do any follow-up on it. After Scully leaves it is revealed that the Cigarette Smoking Man was waiting in an adjacent room to question Skinner about the exchange. Leaving the building, Scully has a hunch upon seeing the metal detector again that leads to locating metal in <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> neck. Scully sees a doctor, who removes a small metal implant.|$|E
5|$|Oviri {{has long}} blonde or grey hair {{reaching}} to her knees. Her head and eyes are disproportionately large, she has adolescent breasts, while the aperture at <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> head resembles a vaginal orifice. She holds a wolf cub to her hip, {{a symbol of}} her indifference and wild power. It {{is not clear whether}} Oviri is smothering or hugging the cub, but her pose invokes ideas of sacrifice, infanticide and the archetype of the vengeful mother, influenced by Eugène Delacroix's 1838 painting, Medea About to Kill Her Children. A second animal, likely another wolf, is at her feet either curling in submission or dead. Art historians including Sue Taylor suggest the second animal may represent Gauguin.|$|E
60|$|Dolores {{was thankful}} for help, {{and the books}} were {{scrambled}} in anyhow on the shelves; for Mysie's good nature was endangering <b>her</b> share <b>of</b> the afternoon's gouter, though perhaps it consoled her that her curiosity was gratified by a hasty glance at <b>the</b> <b>backs</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> cousin's story-books.|$|R
50|$|Born in Scranton, Pennsylvania, Jean was the {{daughter}} of Stanley and Josephine (née Kafchinski) Malanoski. At an early age, she learned to play sandlot ball with <b>the</b> <b>backing</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> father and uncle, who were professional ballplayers. She graduated from Scranton Central High School and later studied at the University of Wisconsin - Madison.|$|R
6000|$|She turns away, shuddering, {{and sits}} {{down on the edge of}} the [...] armchair, {{covering}} <b>her</b> eyes with <b>the</b> <b>backs</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> hands. MALISE [...] picks up the stick, and fingers it lovingly. Then putting it [...] down, he moves so that he can see her face. She is sitting [...] quite still, staring straight before her.|$|R
5|$|During the trip, The Smoking Man tells Scully that he {{believes}} he shares a special kinship with her because he once held her own life in his hands. Mulder finds a message Scully left on his phone suspicious and goes to her apartment, where the landlord tells him that she left with someone else. The Smoking Man and Scully arrive {{at the home of}} Marjorie Butters (Louise Latham), a 118-year-old gardener who also has the chip implanted in <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> neck. Meanwhile, Mulder visits Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) to voice his concern, but Scully calls Skinner during the meeting and says that she is fine. At a gas station, Scully removes the wire, places it in an envelope, and mails it to Mulder. However, a man following the two removes the letter from the mailbox.|$|E
5|$|The Malaysian Penanggalan is a {{woman who}} {{obtained}} her beauty through the active use of black magic or other unnatural means, and is most commonly described in local folklore to be dark or demonic in nature. She is able to detach her fanged head which flies around in the night looking for blood, typically from pregnant women. Malaysians hung jeruju (thistles) around the doors and windows of houses, hoping the Penanggalan would not enter for fear of catching its intestines on the thorns. The Leyak is a similar being from Balinese folklore of Indonesia. A Kuntilanak or Matianak in Indonesia, or Pontianak or Langsuir in Malaysia, {{is a woman}} who died during childbirth and became undead, seeking revenge and terrorising villages. She appeared as an attractive woman with long black hair that covered a hole in <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> neck, with which she sucked the blood of children. Filling the hole with her hair would drive her off. Corpses had their mouths filled with glass beads, eggs under each armpit, and needles in their palms to prevent them from becoming langsuir. This description would also fit the Sundel Bolongs.|$|E
5|$|The ferry {{scene was}} filmed in the New York town of Athens, and Mary Ann's parents' house {{was located in}} Brooklyn (but was {{featured}} in the film in Boston). For the neighborhood plane crash scene, the production crew bought a retired Boeing 747, with transportation costs of $2 million, destroyed it into pieces, and built houses around them. The destroyed plane was kept for the Universal Studios back-lot tour. Ray's house was filmed in Bayonne, New Jersey (with a soundstage doubling the interior); meanwhile, the valley war sequence was filmed in Lexington, Virginia and Mystery Mesa in California. The scene where the tripod is shot down and crashes through a factory was filmed in Naugatuck, Connecticut at the since dismantled Naugatuck Chemical. The scene of the bodies floating down the river was filmed on the Farmington River in Windsor, Connecticut by a second unit using a stand in for Dakota Fanning (<b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> character) with the portion showing {{the faces of the}} credited actors cut in later. Some filming was shot on the Korean War Veterans Parkway in Staten Island, NY. The film used six sound stages, spread over three studio lots.|$|E
6000|$|... "Husband!" [...] she cried, {{and held}} out her slender arms to me. I was {{compelled}} {{to go to her}} and kiss her, and she twined them softly about my neck and drew me to her and kissed me. I disentangled them very gently, and took each wrist and kissed it, and <b>the</b> <b>backs</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> hands.|$|R
60|$|But to {{have got}} there at last {{was a great}} comfort, {{especially}} as there were lights still burning in the office window, and therefore some hope {{that she was not}} too late. So the Marchioness dried <b>her</b> eyes with <b>the</b> <b>backs</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> hands, and, stealing softly up the steps, peeped in through the glass door.|$|R
25|$|She had visible tan {{lines from}} a halter top or bikini, {{suggesting}} {{that she may}} have come from a region with abundant October–November sunshine, as sun tanning beds were uncommon in the 1970s, and upstate New York is not generally warm or sunny enough for such tanning during that period. There were freckles on <b>the</b> <b>backs</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> shoulders and acne on her face and chest.|$|R
5|$|The initial {{round of}} gunfire killed only the Emperor, the Empress and two male servants, and wounded Grand Duchess Maria, Dr Botkin and the Empress' maidservant, Demidova. At {{that point the}} gunmen {{had to leave the}} room because of smoke and toxic fumes from their guns and plaster dust their bullets had {{released}} from the walls. After allowing the haze to clear for several minutes, the gunmen returned. Dr Botkin was killed, and a gunman named Ermakov repeatedly tried to shoot Tsarevich Alexei, but failed because jewels sewn into the boy's clothes shielded him. Ermakov tried to stab Alexei with a bayonet but failed again, and finally Yurovsky fired two shots into the boy's head. Yurovsky and Ermakov approached Olga and Tatiana, who were crouched against the room's rear wall, clinging to each other and screaming for their mother. Ermakov stabbed both young women with his 8-inch bayonet, but had difficulty penetrating their torsos because of the jewels that had been sewn into their chemises. The sisters tried to stand, but Tatiana was killed instantly when Yurovsky shot her in <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> head. A moment later, Olga too died when Ermakov shot her in the head.|$|E
5|$|The last of {{the murders}} in the Whitechapel file was {{committed}} on Friday 13 February 1891 when prostitute Frances Coles was murdered under a railway arch. Her body was found by PC Ernest Thompson only moments after the attack at 2:15am at Swallow Gardens, a passageway under a railway arch between Chamber Street and Royal Mint Street, Whitechapel. Minor wounds on <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> head suggest that she was thrown violently to the ground before her throat was cut at least twice, {{from left to right}} and then back again. Otherwise there were no mutilations to the body. Superintendent Arnold and Inspector Reid arrived soon afterwards from the nearby Leman Street police station, and Chief Inspectors Donald Swanson and Henry Moore, who had been involved in the previous murder investigations, arrived by 5am. A man named James Sadler, who had been seen with Coles earlier, was arrested by the police and charged with her murder. A high-profile investigation by Swanson and Moore into Sadler's past history and his whereabouts {{at the time of the}} previous Whitechapel murders indicates that the police may have suspected him to be the Ripper. However, Sadler was released on 3 March for lack of evidence.|$|E
5|$|Meryl gets a {{voicemail}} from Sully, and Veronica {{agrees to}} track her. Veronica and Keith have another fight, with Veronica insulting his character {{for having a}} relationship with Harmony. Veronica and Meryl track the cell phone in the Fitzpatricks’ bar. Liam Fitzpatrick drunkenly picks up Veronica and carries her around, but Vinnie supposedly takes {{a picture of it}} to get him off her. Veronica and Meryl go to the police station and find that Sully washed up on shore after surfing with a bump on his head and had mild amnesia. While cleared, Mercer is still being held in custody. Keith rejects Harmony, and Logan nervously calls Keith for the whereabouts of Veronica. At the food court, Veronica is listening to voicemails from Logan and Keith when she notices an issue with her food. She returns to the counter with her plate, leaving her drink unattended. She returns to her seat but, after eating and drinking, soon feels disoriented. She recognizes this feelings as identical to her experience after ingesting GHB previously. Veronica attempts to get into her car and collapses just outside of it but she manages to set off the alarm. A mysterious figure appears and stops the alarm. There is a buzzing sound the scene cuts to a nearby Logan hearing the alarm. Logan finds Veronica's car with her unconscious on the ground next to it. He picks her up to reveal some locks of Veronica's hair on the ground and a bald spot on <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> head.|$|E
60|$|But Miss Ledrook wouldn't come to Miss Snevellicci, so Miss Snevellicci {{was obliged}} to go to Miss Ledrook, which she did, in a {{skipping}} manner that was quite fascinating; and Miss Ledrook evidently joked Miss Snevellicci about being struck with Nicholas; for, after some playful whispering, Miss Snevellicci hit Miss Ledrook very hard on <b>the</b> <b>backs</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> hands, and retired up, {{in a state of}} pleasing confusion.|$|R

25|$|She was {{estimated}} to be between 20 and 28 years old and had been raped. Basic physical examination showed she was about 5 feet 5 inches tall and weighed about 118 pounds. The victim was white with possible Hispanic ancestry, as she had brown or black hair and brown eyes. She also had a unique scar on <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> left hand, which was shaped like the letter T. She also had an inch-long scar on <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> left thigh.|$|E
25|$|Young moviegoers began emulating romantic {{stars on}} the screen, such as Ronald Colman and Rudolph Valentino, the latter known for ending his passionate scenes with a kiss. Valentino also began his romantic scenes with women by kissing her hand, {{traveling}} up her arm, and then kissing her on <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> neck. Female actresses were often turned into stars based on their screen portrayals of passion. Actresses like Nazimova, Pola Negri, Vilma Bánky and Greta Garbo, became screen idols as a result.|$|E
25|$|During the 1916 Easter Rising, several {{jewish women}} from the {{community}} smuggled ammunition from Portobello, Dublin's Jewish quarter, to the then named Sackville Street, where the rebels occupied the General Post Office and other strategic buildings. Most notable of these women was the famous Artist Estella Solomons, she used to hide ammunition under a vegetable patch at <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> family home. The Cumann na mBan women worked as agents transferring ammunition, able to avoid detection at that time precisely because they were women.|$|E
50|$|She showed {{promise as}} a young singer, and studied with Sarah Robinson-Duff in Chicago under the {{financial}} support of wealthy patrons David and Florence Mayer. In 1896 she pursued further studies in Paris, chiefly with Trabadelo and Lucien Fugère, still under {{the support of the}} Mayers. She also studied some under Jacques Bouhy, Jules Chevalier, and Mathilde Marchesi. In 1899 Garden lost <b>the</b> <b>backing</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> benefactors, and she began to study singing with the American soprano Sibyl Sanderson. Sanderson introduced her to Jules Massenet and Albert Carré, the director of the Opéra-Comique.|$|R

25|$|In the {{painting}} generally titled The Lady with an Ermine (about 1483) {{he sets the}} figure diagonally to the picture space and turns her head so that her face is almost parallel to her nearer shoulder. <b>The</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> head and the further shoulder are deeply shadowed.

25|$|Dushku {{visited her}} father's family in Albania in 2006 after {{receiving}} {{an invitation from}} Albanian Prime Minister Sali Berisha. She visited Kosovo and received an Albanian Eagle tattoo on <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> neck. While on her second visit to Albania in 2011, she applied for Albanian citizenship and obtained the Albanian passport and ID Card. She became an honorary citizen of Tirana, and was given the honorary title of Tirana Ambassador of Culture and Tourism in the World by Tirana mayor Lulzim Basha. Additionally, she was given honorary citizen status in her father's home town of Korçë, Albania.|$|E
25|$|In 2011, a {{case study}} of a woman with ulcers on <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> leg {{reported}} as being diagnosed with PNP. The underlying tumors are almost exclusively of B-cell lineage. However, T-cells and CD56+ Natural Killer cells have also been postulated to be associated effectors of paraneoplastic pemphigus. This case demonstrated the rare association between Natural Killer cell lymphoma and PNP, suggesting that Natural Killer cells could be involved in the pathogenesis of PNP. The article warned clinicians to be alert to the possibility that paraneoplastic pemphigus in lymphomas not of B-cell lineage. This added to the already complex, not fully understood pathogenesis of PNP.|$|E
50|$|In 1841 Elizabeth {{suffered}} a compound fracture <b>of</b> <b>her</b> leg. She challenged George Combe on his 1847 pamphlet Remarks on National Education. Another disagreement {{with her husband}} with a theological root was Elizabeth's support in the 1840s for Alexander Dallas, whose efforts with Irish Church Missions were dismissed by the archbishop. Elizabeth and her daughters supported the work of Ellen Smyly, an associate of Dallas, but without <b>the</b> <b>backing</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> husband. When Daniel Murray was succeeded by Paul Cullen as Roman Catholic Archbishop of Dublin, the family connection with Dallas caused Cullen to conclude that Richard Whately was concerned with proselytising.|$|R
60|$|These sounds Cecilia heard, when, {{from the}} open door, she saw <b>the</b> thin <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> husband's neck, with its softly {{graduated}} hair, bent forward above the bureau. She stole over to him, and pressed herself against his arm.|$|R
50|$|The first {{national}} working-class {{movement in the}} world, Chartism, helped Lady Charlotte understand {{that there was a}} need for ‘closer involvement in practical work for the people of Dowlais.’ Many of the wealthier people during the 19th century helped develop educational and leisure facilities for the people who worked for them: this is something that the Guests also did. With <b>the</b> <b>backing</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> cousin, Henry Layard, Lady Charlotte eventually focused her efforts on providing education in Dowlais. Maugre her sex, a great disadvantage in that day in public affairs, Lady Charlotte managed to propagate her ideas and implement many <b>of</b> <b>her</b> educational developments.|$|R
