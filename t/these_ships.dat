5|$|In practice, the {{flexibility}} which the OBO design allows has gone largely unused, as <b>these</b> <b>ships</b> tend {{to specialize in}} either the liquid or dry bulk trade. Also, <b>these</b> <b>ships</b> have endemic maintenance problems. On one hand, due to a less specialized design, an OBO suffers more from wear and tear during dry cargo onload than a bulker. On the other hand, components of the liquid cargo system, from pumps to valves to piping, tend to develop problems when subjected to periods of disuse. These factors have contributed to a steady {{reduction in the number}} of OBO ships worldwide since the 1970s.|$|E

5|$|The {{attack on}} Sydney and Newcastle marked {{the start of}} a {{sustained}} Japanese submarine campaign against Australia. During 1942, Japanese submarines sank 17 ships in Australian waters, although none of <b>these</b> <b>ships</b> were sailing as part of a convoy. 16 ships were sunk in Australian waters during 1943, before the Japanese ended the campaign in July. Five of <b>these</b> <b>ships</b> were sunk while sailing in escorted convoys. The Australian naval authorities gradually dismantled the coastal convoy system between December 1943 and March 1944. By the end of the war, the RAAF and RAN had escorted over 1,100 convoys along the Australian coastline.|$|E

5|$|The {{distinction}} between coast-assault battleship and cruising battleship became blurred with the , ordered in 1880. <b>These</b> <b>ships</b> reflected developments in ironclad design, being protected by iron-and-steel compound armour rather than wrought iron. Equipped with breech-loading guns of between 12-inch and 16 ¼-inch (305mm and 413mm) calibre, the Admirals continued {{the trend of}} ironclad warships towards gigantic weapons. The guns were mounted in open barbettes to save weight. Some historians see <b>these</b> <b>ships</b> as a vital step towards pre-dreadnoughts; others view them as a confused and unsuccessful design.|$|E
5|$|<b>These</b> <b>ships</b> {{proved to}} be rather wet in service, as they were bow-heavy because of the {{superimposed}} turrets forward.|$|E
5|$|Again {{waiting until}} late afternoon, the Allies took the {{opportunity}} to attack a patrol of Cilician ships, destroying them, before retreating as night fell. <b>These</b> <b>ships</b> were possibly survivors of the wrecked detachment sent around Euboea, or were perhaps anchored in an isolated harbour.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the war, as in the preceding conflict, French privateers operated from the islands, including a fleet of small vessels run by Robert Surcouf. Supplementing <b>these</b> <b>ships</b> were occasional French naval vessels, principally the frigate Piémontaise (captured in March 1808) and the old frigates Sémillante and Canonnière. <b>These</b> <b>ships</b> operated independently of one another and achieved minor successes against smaller British warships and merchant vessels but were not powerful enough to have a serious effect on the Indian Ocean trade routes. In August 1808, Sémillante and Canonnière were downgraded to armed storeships and sent back to France. To replace <b>these</b> <b>ships,</b> four large frigates under Jacques Hamelin were sent to Governor Charles Decaen on Isle de France in the late autumn of 1808. These vessels, Vénus, Manche, Caroline and Bellone were large and powerful ships under orders to operate from Isle de France and Île Bonaparte against British trade in the Indian Ocean. Based on Isle de France, these frigates had access to large numbers of unemployed sailors and several fortified anchorages from which to launch raids on the British trade routes. A fifth frigate, Niémen, was to have joined the force in the summer of 1809, but was intercepted and captured within hours of leaving France at the Action of 6 April 1809.|$|E
5|$|During the war, Italy stopped {{building}} cruisers, since destroyers, submarines, {{and smaller}} patrol vessels were more useful in operations against the Austro-Hungarians. After the war, the anemic Italian economy could not support significant naval construction programs. Additionally, Italy had received several modern light cruisers from the defeated Germans and Austro-Hungarians, and <b>these</b> <b>ships</b> formed {{the backbone of}} the Italian cruiser force.|$|E
5|$|Following the November 1918 Armistice, the U.S. Navy {{converted}} fifteen older battleships, eight armoured cruisers and two larger protected cruisers {{for temporary}} service as transports. <b>These</b> <b>ships</b> made one to six trans-Atlantic round-trips each, bringing home {{a total of}} more than 145,000 passengers.|$|E

5|$|The Admiralty's 1905 draft {{building}} plan envisioned four battleships in the 1906–1907 Naval Programme, {{but the new}} Liberal government cut one of <b>these</b> <b>ships</b> in mid-1906.

5|$|The {{completion}} of the British battleship Dreadnought with her all big-gun-armament and steam turbines in 1906 meant that <b>these</b> <b>ships</b> were obsolete even before they were completed. The IJN recognized that fact when it drew up the first iteration of its Eight-Eight Fleet building plan for eight first-class battleships and eight battlecruisers in 1910 and did not include them.|$|E
5|$|The {{eventual}} {{successor to}} the Kaiserliche Marine, the Kriegsmarine, considered building three s before the Second World War {{as part of the}} Plan Z buildup of the Navy. However, the outbreak of war in 1939 caused the plans to be shelved, and none of <b>these</b> <b>ships</b> were built.|$|E

5000|$|Ship models, {{including}} {{models of}} warships {{such as in}} Dolstad Church, {{has been used as}} decoration inside churches.

5|$|The {{first two}} vessels of the Principe di Carignano class were {{initially}} ordered as steam frigates by the Regia Marina Sarda (Royal Sardinian Navy) {{shortly before the}} unification of Italy. While {{they were on the}} stocks, the Regia Marina (Royal Navy) of the newly-formed Kingdom of Italy decided to convert the ships into ironclads. A third ship, , was too far advanced in her construction to allow for conversion, and so she was completed as a wooden vessel. <b>These</b> <b>ships</b> had been designed by Inps. Eng. Felice Mattei. A fourth ship, Conte Verde, was built to a modified design created by Inps. Eng. Giuseppe De Luca. <b>These</b> <b>ships</b> came as part of a major naval expansion program that was designed to prepare a fleet of ironclads capable of defeating the Austrian Navy. Italy considered the Austrian Empire to be its main rival, since it controlled predominantly Italian areas, including Venice.|$|E

5|$|The {{proliferation}} of ironclad battleship designs {{came to an}} end in the 1890s as navies reached a consensus on the design of battleships, producing the type known as the pre-Dreadnought. <b>These</b> <b>ships</b> are sometimes covered in treatments of the ironclad warship. The next evolution of battleship design, the dreadnought, is never referred to as an 'ironclad'.|$|E

5|$|<b>These</b> <b>ships</b> were {{designed}} by Sir Edward Reed, the Director of Naval Construction, as replacements for the various gunvessels built for the Crimean War. Being built of green timber, their hulls were starting to rot after {{a decade or more}} in service, but their engines were still generally sound. As the older ships were broken up their engines were salvaged and transferred to Beacon-class ships under construction. Combat experience against Chinese fortifications had shown that the single 32-pounder smoothbore armament of the earlier ships was not powerful enough so Reed was directed to prepare a twin-screw, shallow draft design suitable for riverine operations that incorporated a pair of steam engines from the older gunboats, a heavy armament, and enough freeboard to allow for service at sea. These rather contradictory requirements forced Reed to discard traditional wooden framing for <b>these</b> <b>ships</b> and the Beacon class became the first ships of the Royal Navy to be framed in iron with wooden planking.|$|E
5|$|When Nazi Germany invaded Norway in the Second World War, Skytteren was interned in {{the neutral}} port of Gothenburg, Sweden, {{with several other}} Norwegian ships in April 1940.
