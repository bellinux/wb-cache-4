5|$|During Ford's senior year, a {{controversy}} developed when the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets refused {{to play a}} scheduled game if a black player named Willis Ward took the field. Even after protests from students, players and alumni, university officials opted to keep Ward out of the game. Ford was Ward's best friend on the team and they roomed together while on road trips. Ford reportedly threatened <b>to</b> <b>quit</b> <b>the</b> team {{in response to the}} university's decision, but eventually agreed to play against Georgia Tech when Ward personally asked him to play.|$|E
5|$|His {{contract}} having expired {{following the}} season, Johnson was a hold-out when the Rangers opened their training camp {{prior to the}} 1929–30 NHL season as the team was reluctant to meet his demands for increased pay. When the impasse dragged into November, he threatened <b>to</b> <b>quit</b> <b>the</b> game altogether, before finally agreeing to a new three-year deal. He appeared in 30 games for the Rangers that season, but again missed significant time, this time suffering a broken jaw.

5|$|In 1825 the {{inhabitants}} of Rùm (then numbering some 450 people) were given a year's notice <b>to</b> <b>quit.</b> <b>The</b> inhabitants of Rùm had simply been tenant farmers, paying rent to the laird; they owned neither the land they worked, nor the houses in which they lived. On 11 July 1826, about 300 of {{the inhabitants}} boarded two overcrowded ships bound for Cape Breton in Nova Scotia. The laird, and Dr Lachlan, paid for their journey. The remaining population followed in 1827. Similar evictions happened all over the gaelic-speaking parts of Scotland, and collectively {{became known as the}} Highland Clearances.|$|E

5|$|While {{the film}} was still untitled, Javed Akhtar was signed to write the lyrics, and even wrote and {{recorded}} one song.

5|$|Following the {{explosion}} aboard Mercure, Iéna {{and the other}} French brigs scattered, briefly pursued by Weasel, who chased Iéna and Mamelouck {{but was unable to}} bring them to a decisive action. The loss of the French escorts allowed Victorious to close with Rivoli unopposed and at 04:30 the two large ships began a close range artillery duel. This combat continued unabated for the next three and a half hours, both ships being severely damaged and suffering heavy casualties. Captain Talbot was struck on the head by a flying splinter and had <b>to</b> <b>quit</b> <b>the</b> deck, temporarily blinded, command passing to Lieutenant Thomas Peake. To assist in subduing Rivoli, Peake recalled Weasel to block the French ship's attempts to escape, Commander Andrew sailing his ship in front of Rivoli and repeatedly raking her.|$|E
5|$|In 1909, {{he became}} {{a student at the}} Melbourne Teachers Training College to obtain formal {{teaching}} qualifications. After his graduation in December 1910, he was awarded a scholarship to complete an education diploma at the University of Melbourne, but decided to defer for a year in order to teach at schools in country Victoria. He became a schoolteacher, teaching first at Tragowell in the Swan Hill district, and then at Fine View State School in the Horsham district. In 1911 he entered Trinity College at the University of Melbourne. After failing an exam in deductive logic, he decided <b>to</b> <b>quit</b> <b>the</b> state school system, and in 1912 took up a position at The Armidale School in the New England district of New South Wales. In 1914 he moved to the prestigious Melbourne Grammar School.|$|E
5|$|In {{football}}, Ward {{was only}} the second African-American to win a varsity letter for the Michigan Wolverines football team, lettering in 1932, 1933, and 1934. In 1934, a controversy developed when Georgia Tech refused to play if Ward took the field, and university officials opted to keep Ward out of the game. Teammate Gerald R. Ford reportedly threatened <b>to</b> <b>quit</b> <b>the</b> team {{in response to the}} university’s decision. After being excluded from the Georgia Tech game, Ward went on to score all 12 of Michigan's points that year outside of the Georgia Tech game, without another Wolverine even having an extra point or a field goal.|$|E

5|$|Jane Harris is {{a fictional}} {{character}} from the Australian Network Ten soap opera Neighbours, played by Annie Jones. She debuted on-screen during the episode broadcast on 31 July 1986 and {{was created by}} writer Ray Kolle. Jones originally auditioned {{for the role of}} Charlene Mitchell (Kylie Minogue), but she was not successful. This prompted Jones to telephone the producers for two months asking for a role in the show until she was cast. In 1989, Jones decided <b>to</b> <b>quit</b> <b>the</b> serial in order to pursue other projects and the character departed on 9 September the same year. In 2005, Jones was one of many ex-cast members who agreed to return to the serial, marking the 20th anniversary of Neighbours. On-screen she was featured making a cameo in Annalise Hartman's (Kimberley Davies) documentary about Ramsay Street.|$|E
5|$|Keyes first {{stated that}} he was {{considering}} leaving the Republican Party during a January 2008 appearance on The Weekly Filibuster radio show. He did not withdraw his candidacy after John McCain won the necessary 1,191 delegates to the Republican National Convention, {{even though he was}} no longer campaigning for the Republican nomination. On March 27, 2008, Keyes's campaign website began displaying the Constitution Party's logo, along with a parody of the trademarked GOP logo {{in the form of a}} dead elephant. This appeared to be an indication of Keyes's intentions <b>to</b> <b>quit</b> <b>the</b> Republican party and to begin officially seeking the Constitution Party's presidential nomination.|$|E
5|$|One of the character's {{earliest}} storylines saw him becoming {{caught up}} in Karl and Susan Kennedy's marital problems, while treating their friend, Jim Dolan (Scott Parmeter). Rhys was with Jim when he died and he remained affected by his death for a long time. Rhys had a one-night stand with Kate Ramsay (Ashleigh Brewer), which left Kate feeling awkward around him. Rhys became determined to join the hospital's surgical training programme and was devastated when he missed out on a place. Rhys then romantically pursued Erin Salisbury (Elise Jansen) and through his manipulative behaviour he forced her <b>to</b> <b>quit</b> <b>the</b> programme. Exploration of the character's backstory began after his mother was introduced and Barber believed this would allow the audience to see why Rhys has become who he is.|$|E

5|$|Sir Bert Millichip {{served as}} Albion {{chairman}} from 1974 to 1983, {{after which he}} chose to concentrate on his role {{as chairman of the}} Football Association. In 1996, the club became a public limited company, issuing shares to supporters at £500 and £3,000 each. The shares were quoted on the Alternative Investment Market, but the club withdrew from the stock exchange in order to become a private company again in 2004. The name of the company thus reverted from West Bromwich Albion plc to West Bromwich Albion Limited, the latter becoming a subsidiary of West Bromwich Albion Holdings Limited. Jeremy Peace took up the post in 2002, after a rift between previous chairman Paul Thompson and manager Gary Megson forced Thompson <b>to</b> <b>quit</b> <b>the</b> club.|$|E
5|$|The Sounds {{compiled}} a 68–76record, 20games out of first-place, in 1995. Originally, Michael Jordan, {{who played with}} the White Sox's Double-A Birmingham Barons in 1994, was signed to play the 1995 season as a non-drafted free agent for the Sounds. However, with the ongoing MLB strike, Jordan decided <b>to</b> <b>quit</b> <b>the</b> sport rather than becoming a replacement player and being labeled a strikebreaker. The team improved their record in 1996, ending up with 77wins and 67losses. Despite a decent winning percentage, Nashville failed to secure {{a spot in the}} playoffs. Outfielder Jeff Abbott won the Rookie of the Year Award, and Rick Renick earned his second Manager of the Year Award. Joey Vierra pitched in a career franchise-record 238games from 1990 to 1992 and 1994 to 1995.|$|E
5|$|To {{ensure that}} the game goes ahead, glee club members Rachel (Lea Michele), Mercedes (Amber Riley), Tina (Jenna Ushkowitz) and Lauren (Ashley Fink) join the {{football}} team. The game begins badly for the McKinley side, and when Tina is injured during a play, captain Finn Hudson (Cory Monteith) takes control of the situation. He has club member Puck (Mark Salling) convince the former football players to return, and convinces cheerleaders Santana (Naya Rivera), Brittany (Heather Morris) and his ex-girlfriend Quinn (Dianna Agron) <b>to</b> <b>quit</b> <b>the</b> cheer squad and perform at the halftime show. Only Karofsky refuses to participate, but {{when he sees the}} positive reaction the crowd has to the routine, he joins in himself.
