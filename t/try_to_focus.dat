2500|$|The Mayor's Commission {{issued a}} 52-page report on September 18, 2006 entitled, Increasing Opportunity and Reducing Poverty in New York City. {{arguing that it}} would be {{counterproductive}} to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> on everyone's problems, and instead would concentrate on three groups: very young children, young adults, and the working poor. By targeting these critical groups, the Commission believed it could best combat poverty overall. [...] However, the focus was criticized by those who would like a focus on other groups—including the elderly, the unemployed, the homeless, and those recently released from prison. The New York Times reported that little new city money was likely to be invested to fight poverty; management reform was the main source of improvements. For example, the Times noted that food stamp administration would be important for all three of the groups targeted by the commission. Food stamps are fully funded by the federal government, so any expansion of their use would be a cost-free reform for the city.|$|E

2500|$|Today {{there are}} {{multiple}} sources for detailed guidelines and tips on food and wine pairing. But many wine drinkers select wine pairings based on instinct, {{the mood of the}} meal or simply a desire to drink a particular wine at the moment they desire to eat a particular meal. The subjective nature of taste makes it possible to drink any kind of wine with any kind of food and have an enjoyable experience. Wine expert Mark Oldman has noted [...] "Food and Wine pairing can be like sex and pizza: even when it's bad, it can still be pretty good" [...] and gives the example of wedding cake with a dry sparkling wine. A very dry wine with a very sweet food is, according to Oldman, [...] "the equivalent of nails on a chalkboard" [...] and is not a [...] "good pairing" [...] according to most guidelines but the atmosphere of the occasion and the subjective nature of taste can trump any rule or guideline. Today, many wine experts and advocates in the realm of food and wine pairing <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> on the more objective physical aspects of food that {{have an effect on the}} palate, altering (or enhancing) the perception of various aspects of the wine.|$|E
2500|$|Researchers {{believe that}} the {{difference}} in scores {{is closely related to}} the overall achievement gap in American society between students of different racial groups. This gap may be explainable in part by the fact that students of disadvantaged racial groups tend to go to schools that provide lower educational quality. This view is supported by evidence that the black-white gap is higher in cities and neighborhoods that are more racially segregated. It has also been suggested that stereotype threat has a significant effect on lowering achievement of minority students. For example, African Americans perform worse on a test when they are told that the test measures [...] "verbal reasoning ability", than when no mention of the test subject is made. [...] Other research cites poorer minority proficiency in key coursework relevant to the SAT (English and math), as well as peer pressure against students who <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> on their schoolwork ("acting white"). Cultural issues are also evident among black students in wealthier households, with high achieving parents. [...] John Ogbu, a Nigerian-American professor of anthropology, found that instead of looking to their parents as role models, black youth chose other models like rappers and did not put forth the effort to be a good student. However, they felt that racism was wrong.|$|E
