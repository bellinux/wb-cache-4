5|$|The CDF is <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>senior</b> {{appointment}} in the ADF. The CDF commands the ADF, and is notionally {{the equal of}} the Secretary of Defence, <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>senior</b> public servant in the Department of Defence. The CDF is the only four-star officer in the ADF and is a general, admiral or air chief marshal. As well as having command responsibilities, the CDF is the Minister for Defence's principal military adviser. Air Chief Marshal Mark Binskin is the current CDF, and assumed this position on 30 June 2014. Hugh White, a prominent academic and former Deputy Secretary in the Department of Defence, has criticised the ADF's current command structure. White argues that the Minister plays too large a role in military decision-making and does not provide the CDF and Secretary of Defence with necessary and sufficient authority to manage the ADO effectively.|$|E

5|$|Fingleton was {{selected}} for a second string Australian team to tour New Zealand for two months {{at the end of}} the season while the Test team departred for England.

The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit often summoned him to sit with that court to hear appeals, a task he found stimulating. In 1917, he lobbied for promotion to the Second Circuit, but the unpopularity of his Masses decision and his reputation as a liberal stood against him. He was passed over in favor of Martin T. Manton.|$|E

From 1777 onwards, the military balance between the Tây Sơn and the Nguyễn fluctuated, as the enemies counterattacked each other frequently.|$|E

5|$|Men without property, {{who were}} thereby {{excluded}} from the qualifying social classes of the adsidui, were exempted from military service {{on the grounds that}} they were too poor to provide themselves with any arms whatsoever. However, in the most pressing circumstances, even these proletarii were pressed into service, though their military worth was probably questionable.

5|$|Often <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>senior</b> and {{responsible}} Patrol Leader is appointed as Troop Leader (TL), {{who no longer}} runs a Patrol but instead has other responsibilities such as enforcing discipline and running the weekly programme.
