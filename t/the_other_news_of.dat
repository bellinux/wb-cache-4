Members of THE BRYANT SERVICE CLUB, Thanks {{sincerely}} for {{the very}} attractive and specially delicious box of sugared candy. With my appreciation are included those of my buddies as we all had a hand it its rapid disappearance. As Prof “Vinal” use to point out – It was DEMAND versus SUPPLY in a Seller’s market. The bidders were hungry and numerous with the resultant increased trend in consumption – while it lasted. All of us enjoyed its tasty contents. My thanks are really double for somehow or other I received tow boxes within the week, much to the pleasure of my buddies and I will confess, to myself. To return {{it would have made}} me a social outcast among these bunch of wolves – truly all swell fellows. I hope our greed does not deprive another fellow alumnus from receiving a package. Thanks too, for you interesting letter. It was swell to read of the many things you are doing and also the news and whereabouts of other fellow alumnus (Correction – alumni) PS I looked it up. “Chet” Desormeaux was in my class. I’m glad to hear he’s well on the road to recovery. <b>The</b> <b>other</b> <b>news</b> <b>of</b> Leo Ringuette struck very close to home. I read about it first in the local paper I receive and then from my folks while home on my last pass. He was one swell fellow and will be missed by all who knew him. We in the service do not lack for want of cigarettes, especially the more popular brands. On the post here we are limited in our purchases to two packs a day which should be sufficient for even a “chain smoker”. We may purchase 1 of Camels or Chesterfields, and 1 of another brand such as Lucky Strike or Old Gold. Speaking of the shortage of yarn, our outfit has already received a sweater per person. We were issued them two weeks ago. Long sleeve in style and tops in quality, so many of us are appreciating, these cool nights, the yarn you folks now miss. I might add that this island post is the coldest post in the United States according to Believe It or Not “Ripley”, in the winter-time. The past few weeks the weather here has been really grand – Summer must be almost here. You may be interested to know of the USAFI (United States Armed Forces Institute) Courses that are in languages, trades, sciences, technician jobs, and business courses that include law, money 2 ̆ 6 banking, bookkeeping, accounting, auditing, C. P. A., public finance, cost accounting, advertising, merchandising, business management and many others. They also offer College Extension Courses where credits may be obtained for further college education. I have enrolled in their correspondent course taking “Essentials of Accounting” for a refresher or review of my past studies. I was honestly surprised in the completeness of the course as it was far above what I expected it to be. The textbook, while not so detailed or completer as the four volumes by “Finney” I used in school, is very well written and quite comprehensive/ It’s a large text book written by W. A. Paton, Ph. D., C. P. A. and is titled, “Essentials of Accounting”. Each month you have to submit at least one lesson to be graded and returned. Your progress depends entirely upon your own initiative. The enrollment fee was 2. 00 which entitles you to the course you select and to take any other course or courses you desire to go on with upon completion of your present course. This enrollment fee covers your membership and the complete cost of your course and other additional courses you latter take up. It is a great opportunity for any enlisted man who desires to further his education or study and learn some special subject. For the past two years and more my job in the Army has been that of a personnel clerk. Their job is to prepare the payrolls, keep the service records {{of the men in the}} battery they are assigned to, make out applications for bonds, insurance, family allowances, allotments, (also Furloughs), and to take care of any other financial problems or difficulties a soldier may have. Most all of the work is turned out by a typewriter. Speed is necessary though not easily acquired if not already possessed as most all work is done on form paper. We also have a goodly share of correspondence to carry on. Added to this are the applications for OCS, Infantry, Paratroops, Discharges, and etc, which manage to keep us fairly busy. The Army – red tape – is not mere fiction. That’s all for now. Thanks again for you swell letter and most delicious candy. The thoughtful way you keep us in mind is warmly and heartily felt by us. Your club is rendering a great service in a very fine way. I know all of us who happen to be on the receiving end sincerely appreciate your gifts, your time and your efforts. Sincerely yours, “Jim” [Transcription ends...|$|E

News of this event emerged when survivors from the village arrived {{in the city of}} Maiduguri, where they were able to communicate to <b>others</b> <b>the</b> <b>news</b> <b>of</b> what had happened.|$|R

5000|$|The {{possible}} {{connection between}} the Satanazes and the Skraelings was first proposed by Nordenskiöld (1889), his attention drawn by an inscription on some islands between Newfoundland and Greenland in the 1508 map of Johannes Ruysch, which notes how 'devils' located there attacked sailors (See Isle of Demons). [...] The connection need not require direct knowledge of the Norse sagas themselves, e.g. Fridtjof Nansen has drawn attention to how Norse encounters with North American 'demons' were adopted in Irish immrama,. Given the tendency of the legends of Atlantic seafarers - Norse, Irish, Arab and Iberian - to move quickly and cross-fertilize each <b>other,</b> <b>the</b> <b>news</b> <b>of</b> an Isle of Devils out in the North Atlantic may have arrived to Italian cartographers via several channels.|$|R
50|$|Thursday, May 24The cabildo, {{now with}} the session done, {{formally}} announced {{the formation of a}} Junta with now ex-Viceroy Cisneros as president and Saavedra and Castelli as two of the four members (The two were Criollos while Spaniards occupied <b>the</b> <b>other</b> two). When <b>news</b> <b>of</b> it was known, everyone was shocked and as a result, Domingo French, the city mail carrier, and treasury employee Antonio Beruti led a mob that made its way to the Cabildo for Cisneros's new job was against the Cabildo's will of his full resignation. Col. Martin Rodriguez, who was there at the Cabildo told everyone inside that a revolt among the soldiery of the city was possible enough if they some of them still had loyaties to Cisneros. The Patrician Corps was there at the plaza that day, ready for any commotion but this did not happen.|$|R
5|$|Despite a shaky {{start at}} the anchor desk, Jennings' {{broadcast}} began to climb in the ratings. Jennings was praised for his performance during the 1986 Space Shuttle Challenger disaster, when he anchored ABC's coverage of the event for 11 straight hours. By 1989, competition among the three nightly newscasts had risen to fever pitch. When the Loma Prieta earthquake struck the San Francisco Bay area, media pundits praised Jennings and ABC News for their prompt on-air response, while criticizing the delayed reaction of Tom Brokaw and NBC News. The next month, Brokaw redeemed himself by scooping <b>the</b> <b>other</b> networks with <b>news</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fall of the Berlin Wall. It was World News Tonight, however, that ended the year at the top; ABC's evening newscast spent the last 13 weeks {{of the year in}} first place, and its average ratings for the entire year beat CBS for the first time.|$|R
40|$|News songs {{differ in}} crucial ways to <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>news</b> media <b>of</b> <b>the</b> early modern period like newsletters, newspapers, or {{diplomatic}} correspondence – they differ {{even from the}} prose broadsheets and pamphlets that they so closely resemble. As historians <b>of</b> <b>news</b> {{we need to ask}} different kinds of questions of these multi-media artifacts. For example, how does the presentation in a performative genre affect the dissemination and reception of information about events? What part do orality and aurality play in how the news was sold and received? Here the activities and social status of street singers play an important role. We must consider the production, format and distribution of these songs in order to understand their impact. We also need {{to pay attention to the}} conjunction between text and melody, and the ways in which this affected the presentation <b>of</b> a <b>news</b> event. On a broader scale, what kind of information can ballads provide about specific <b>news</b> events that <b>other</b> documents cannot or will not provide? Can they offer us a new medium by which to interpret historical events? And lastly, how should historians deal with these profoundly emotive texts? The combination of sensationalist language and affecting music meant that songs had the potential to provoke a more powerful response than any <b>other</b> contemporary <b>news</b> source, and this emotional potency can at times be challenging for a modern historian to decipher and explain. This article will attempt to answer some of these questions and suggest some of the skills we as historians need to develop in order to appreciate the full meaning of songs as the most popular <b>of</b> <b>news</b> media in early modern Europe...|$|R
50|$|Marching westward, Garcia's group {{discovered}} Iguazú Falls, {{crossed the}} Río Paraná, {{and arrived at}} the site of Asunción thirteen years before it was founded. There the group gathered a small army of 2,000 Guaraní warriors to assist the invasion and set out boldly across the Chaco, a harsh semidesert. In the Chaco, they faced drought, floods, and cannibal Indian tribes. Garcia became the first European to cross the Chaco and penetrated the outer defenses of the Inca Empire to the foothills of the Andes Mountains in present-day Bolivia, eight years in advance of Francisco Pizarro. The Garcia entourage engaged in plundering and amassed a considerable hoard of silver. Only fierce attacks by the reigning Inca, Huayna Cápac, convinced Garcia to withdraw. Indian allies later murdered Garcia and <b>the</b> <b>other</b> Europeans, but <b>news</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> raid on the Incas reached the Spanish explorers on the coast and attracted Sebastian Cabot to the Río Paraguay two years later.|$|R
60|$|Once she {{was outside}} of Owen's house, Noma did not tarry. First she {{returned}} to Hokosa's kraal, where she had already learnt from his head wife, Zinti, and <b>others</b> <b>the</b> <b>news</b> <b>of</b> his betrayal of the plot of Hafela, of his conversion to {{the faith of the}} Christians, and of the march of the impi to ambush the prince. Here she took a little spear, and rolling up in a skin blanket as much dried meat as she could carry, she slipped unnoticed from the kraal. Her object was to escape from the Great Place, but this she did not try to do by any of the gates, knowing them to be guarded. Some months ago, before she started on her embassy, she had noted a weak spot in the fence, where dogs had torn a hole through which they passed out to hunt at night. To this spot she made her way under cover of the darkness--for though she still greatly feared to be alone at night, her pressing need conquered her fears--and found that the hole was yet there, for a tall weed growing in its mouth had caused it to be overlooked by those whose duty it was to mend the fence. With her assegai she widened it a little, then drew her lithe shape through it, and lying hidden till the guard had passed, climbed the two stone walls beyond. Once she was free of the town, she set her course by the stars and started forward at a steady run.|$|R

5000|$|The {{story of}} a childless mother named Madhabi who is loved by her entire family is a {{responsible}} and a committed house wife, cannot conceive because her husband, Aditya is impotent. She has strong motherly feelings for a kid named Jharon who is the adopted daughter of Batasi, who is a maid at Madhabi’s house. Jahron comes to Madhabi’s place {{on the day of}} a Ganesh Puja, when Jharon wanted some food, while everyone perceived Jharon as a thief, Madhabi could see the little girl who has come to eat some food. On the day of her sister-in-law's baby shower, she is shunned by her relatives as she might be an ill omen for the unborn child. On <b>the</b> <b>other</b> hand, <b>the</b> <b>news</b> <b>of</b> her husband’s impotency is covered up smartly by her husband and he starts living with a girl named Anamika. Madhabi is accused vehemently as a woman who is capable of harming the unborn baby. She then is pushed to such a corner that she decides to leave her house she called her own and commit suicide. She fails to commit suicide and eventually finds refuge in the slumg of a woman named Firoza who was her beautician. Here, she comes across Irfan again, Madhabi remembers Irfan from the time he sang at the slum on Eid when Madhabi was invited by Firoza. Irfan is lively boy, a krishore kanti, an energetic guy who helps Madhabi feel comfortable at the slum. Later, Madhabi helps save the slum when it was about to get demolished by the construction company where her husband works. After, Jharon’s mother is convicted of murdering her drunkard husband, Madhabi adopts Jharon legally [...] Her family figures out that Madhabi is she is innocent and the report was forged. When a talk of restabilising Madhabi in the house arises, Madhabi decides to go back but the family doesn’t want to accept the child as her own. She then takes on the struggle to establish the kid as her own and give her the name of her husband and the family to which she belongs.|$|R

5000|$|While Midway-based bombers {{attacked}} the enemy transport force that afternoon, Ens. Vandivier waited with <b>the</b> <b>other</b> pilots for <b>news</b> <b>of</b> their own special targets — the Japanese carriers. At 05:45 the following morning, another Catalina from Midway Island found the enemy flattops. Enterprise and Hornet raced {{to close the}} Japanese while Yorktown recovered search planes. At about 07:05, Enterprise planes began rumbling down her flight deck and wobbling into the air. By 07:30, the whole attack group was aloft. As they made off to attack the enemy, Ens. Vandivier formed his SBD Dauntless dive bomber up with <b>the</b> <b>other</b> planes of Bombing 6's 3d Division. Led by the carrier's group commander, Lt. Comdr. Wade McClusky, the formation winged its way toward the enemy carrier striking force, composed of {{four of the six}} carriers which had attacked Pearl Harbor. At 09:20 when the planes reached the point where they expected to find the enemy carriers, the airmen gazed down upon empty ocean. At this point, the air group commander made a hard decision. His planes were low on fuel; and, if they initiated a search, some aircraft might not make it back to the carriers. On <b>the</b> <b>other</b> hand, if <b>the</b> strike returned to Enterprise and missed the enemy carriers, Midway Island might fall. Worse yet, Japanese bombers might knock out Enterprise, Hornet, and Yorktown, leaving little or nothing between America and the forces of the Japanese Empire. Therefore, the American pilots ignored their fuel problem and began searching for the enemy. At 10:05, they spied, on the horizon to the northwest, the silhouettes of three large carriers and a number of escorts. At first, several pilots thought that their leader had brought them back to their own ships; but closer inspection revealed pagoda masts and yellow flight decks. These ships could only be Japanese. As the attack commenced, the Dauntless dive bombers of Bombing 6 jockeyed for position with those of Scouting 6. Vandivier's division followed the 2d division whose commander saw that many of Scouting 6's bombs were missing the [...] "left hand" [...] aircraft carrier — now known to have been Admiral Chuichi Nagumo's flagship Akagi. Rather than follow the 1st division in its attack on Kaga, which seemed well taken care of with critical hits, the 2d and 3d divisions bore down on Akagi. In due course, it was Ens. Vandivier's turn. Over he went and then down, toward the flagship of the Pearl Harbor attack force. He released his bomb — {{whether or not it was}} a hit or a near miss will never be known — and pulled out of the dive. He banked his plane and headed home. He later reported by radio that he was making a water landing, but he and his gunner were never seen nor heard of again.|$|R
