50|$|The United Fruit Co., now Chiquita, began {{shipping}} bananas from South America by ship to New Orleans. <b>The</b> <b>bananas</b> {{were loaded}} onto railcars {{on top of}} 162 lb blocks of ice for the trip north.

40|$|We {{describe}} {{in detail the}} pore water chemistry in the sediments below a white mat around a bunch of bananas at a water depth of 2, 200 m in the Tenryu Submarine Canyon. We infer the metabolism of microbes in the sediments around <b>the</b> <b>bananas</b> based on <b>the</b> chemical and isotopic compositions of the pore water. On {{the basis of the}} relation between ammonia and total carbonate (ΣCO 2) concentrations in the pore water, we identified that an excess ΣCO 2 was distributed around <b>the</b> <b>bananas</b> that cannot be explained by the decomposition of organic matter derived from marine organisms, indicating that <b>the</b> <b>bananas</b> decomposed to generate the excess ΣCO 2. We conclude that <b>the</b> <b>bananas</b> built a local organic-rich environment, stimulating the activity of organotrophic bacteria. SHINKAI 6500 Dive No. : 6 K 00892 ([URL]...|$|R

5|$|Each {{successive}} {{scene in}} the sequence was shorter {{than the one before}} it by exactly one frame.

There were a few problems with the finished animation for the episode. <b>The</b> <b>banana</b> in the opening scene was colored incorrectly, as the Korean animators were unfamiliar with the fruit, and the final bathtub scene was particularly problematic, including issues with lip sync. The version in the broadcast episode was the best of several attempts.|$|E
