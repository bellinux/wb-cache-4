2500|$|Skinner {{advocated}} {{the use of}} teaching machines for {{a broad range of}} students (e.g., preschool aged to adult) and instructional purposes (e.g., reading and music). For example, one machine that he envisioned could teach rhythm. He wrote:A relatively simple device supplies the necessary contingencies. The student taps a rhythmic pattern in unison with the device. [...] "Unison" [...] is specified very loosely at first (the student can be a little early or late at each tap) but the specifications are slowly sharpened. The process is repeated for various speeds and patterns. In another arrangement, the student echoes rhythmic patterns sounded by the machine, though not in unison, and again the specifications for an accurate reproduction are progressively sharpened. Rhythmic patterns can also be brought under the control of a printed score.The instructional potential of the <b>teaching</b> <b>machine</b> stemmed from several factors: it provided automatic, immediate and regular reinforcement without the use of aversive control; the material presented was coherent, yet varied and novel; the pace of learning could be adjusted to suit the individual. As a result, students were interested, attentive, and learned efficiently by producing the desired behavior, [...] "learning by doing." ...|$|E

By embodying the learning system into the Lego Mindstorm NXT platform we provide the student with a tangible tool to understand and interact with a learning system. The resulting behavior of the tangible machines in combination with the positive associations with the Lego system motivated all the students. The students with less technology affinity successfully completed the course, while the students with more technology affinity excelled towards solving advanced problems.

5000|$|Pressey {{himself was}} {{influenced}} by Edward L. Thorndike, a learning theorist and educational psychologist at the Columbia University Teacher College of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Thorndike posited laws for maximizing learning. Thorndike's laws included the law of effect, the law of exercise, and the law of recency. Following later standards, Pressey's teaching and testing machine would not considered intelligent as it was mechanically run and was based on one question and answer at a time, but it set an early precedent for future projects.By the 1950s and 1960s, new perspectives on learning were emerging. Burrhus Frederic [...] "B.F." [...] Skinner at Harvard University {{did not agree with}} Thorndike's learning theory of connectionism or Pressey's <b>teaching</b> <b>machine.</b> Rather, Skinner was a behaviourist who believed that learners should construct their answers and not rely on recognition. He too, constructed a <b>teaching</b> <b>machine</b> structured using an incremental mechanical system that would reward students for correct responses to questions.|$|E

40|$|The current {{processes}} for building machine learning systems require practitioners with deep knowledge of machine learning. This significantly limits {{the number of}} machine learning systems that can be created and {{has led to a}} mismatch between the demand for machine learning systems and the ability for organizations to build them. We believe that in order to meet this growing demand for machine learning systems we must significantly increase the number of individuals that can <b>teach</b> <b>machines.</b> We postulate that we can achieve this goal by making the process of <b>teaching</b> <b>machines</b> easy, fast and above all, universally accessible. While machine learning focuses on creating new algorithms and improving the accuracy of "learners", the <b>machine</b> <b>teaching</b> discipline focuses on the efficacy of the "teachers". <b>Machine</b> <b>teaching</b> as a discipline is a paradigm shift that follows and extends principles of software engineering and programming languages. We put a strong emphasis on the teacher and the teacher's interaction with data, as well as crucial components such as techniques and design principles of interaction and visualization. In this paper, we present our position regarding the discipline of <b>machine</b> <b>teaching</b> and articulate fundamental <b>machine</b> <b>teaching</b> principles. We also describe how, by decoupling knowledge about machine learning algorithms from the process of teaching, we can accelerate innovation and empower millions of new uses for machine learning models.
