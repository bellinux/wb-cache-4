Inspired by their own experiences as young adults living in New York City, the writers loosely based the six main characters on {{some of their own}} friends and family; Monica is based on Kauffman herself. Observing that each main character was originally written as a [...] "one-note stereotype", Jonathan Bernstein of The Daily Telegraph identified Monica as the group's [...] "uptight fun-killer". When Friends first aired, the majority of its earliest episodes revolved around Monica, via whom each character appears to be interconnected; Friends stars the character's brother, her best friend, her former roommate and her two neighbors socializing in Monica's apartment.|$|E

Although critics and audiences initially perceived Monica as the show's main character when Friends premiered, the writers had actually given Rachel the pilot's most prominent storyline. Before deciding that Rachel and Ross would be an item for the entire series, the writers had originally intended for the show's defining couple to be Joey and Monica. However, after the success of the pilot, in which Rachel and Ross' developing romance is first hinted at, and witnessing Aniston and co-star David Schwimmer's on-screen chemistry for the first time, Crane and Kauffman determined that the entire series relied on [...] "finding all the wonderful roadblocks for them to be with each other." ...|$|E

500|$|Early in the series, Clark {{was still}} {{learning}} how to handle his life, by learning to control his powers and find the best solution for everyone. His main priority was {{to fit in with}} his friends at school and be an average guy. Initially, Clark's biggest problem was the fact that he could not share his secret with anyone he cared about. According to Welling, [...] "He is burdened with a lot of responsibility. He hasn't been able to choose whether or not he has these abilities. All this responsibility has just been thrust on him, and he has to deal with it. There have got to be times when he goes home and thinks to himself, ‘Why me?' He wishes it could all go away and he could just be normal. That's part of the character dilemma which makes him interesting to play." [...] Welling noted that the show was not about Clark always saving the day, but more about how using his powers [...] "... alienate him from others". Welling reasoned {{that by the end of}} season three, Clark had decided that leaving Smallville and going with Jor-El was something that would save everyone a lot of pain in the long run. Welling described why Clark finally gave in to Jor-El at the end of season three:"If you can't fight them, you might as well join them [...] he was choosing the lesser of two evils to go with Jor-El. I think a combination of those two things would probably sum it up. A lot of <b>times</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>life,</b> you get to a point where you go, 'I just can't fight this anymore. There's nothing I can do about it, so I better get up out of bed and go to work!' And in a sense, that's what Clark had to do. Somehow he had to try to face what it was that was causing him so much pain—and everyone else so much pain—and maybe he reasoned that by causing everyone else a little bit of pain, he could save them a lot of pain in the long run." ...|$|R

Ms Rosario was congratulated for her achievements in front of academic staff, fellow students and family members at the UNDA Awards Ceremony held at the Fremantle Campus on Tuesday, April 12. The St Mary MacKillop Award was one of four service awards presented which recognised students’ commitment, dedication and enthusiasm to pastoral care at university and in the wider community. The Award was established in recognition of St Mary MacKillop’s canonisation on October 17, 2010 – the only Australian to be recognised by the Catholic Church as a saint. It adds to Ms Rosario’s growing number of accolades including the Dianne Wansborough Scholarship for Nursing in 2008 and the St John of God Health Care Outstanding Student Award in 2009. On Campus, Ms Rosario has also been a student mentor, a student ambassador, a member of the Student Affairs Committee, President of the Nursing Society and part of the Mary MacKillop Festival in 2010. “With all the work I did to get the Festival happening, to actually have an award named after her is so amazing and to be the first recipient is a huge honour,” Ms Rosario said. “I think it’s really important to enjoy your undergraduate degree as it’s one of the only <b>times</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>life</b> where you have the opportunity, time and flexibility to do all these beautiful things Notre Dame offers you. ” The Archbishop Foley Award was presented to Vincent Restifo, the Faulkner Award to Mardi McNamara and Sarah Crute won her third Service Award at Notre Dame as she received the Helen Lombard Award. Ms Crute has been the President and Vice President of the Notre Dame Students for Social Justice and is currently the national representative for the St Vincent de Paul Society. The highest academic award presented at the ceremony, the University Medal, was won by 2010 Bachelor of Commerce graduate Gemma Roddan. The award is reserved for the highest achieving graduate from an undergraduate course on the Fremantle Campus in the previous year. Currently employed with Deloitte Australia, a firm that provides risk management and financial advice to selected clients, she said the best part of her Notre Dame experience was having very good lecturers and tutors. “There were a few stand outs that helped guide me along the way and give me the capacity to do the absolute best I could,” Ms Roddan said. Vice Chancellor Professor Celia Hammond congratulated all students on their achievements and encouraged them to continue striving for the best results. “To those who have won academic awards, we are recognising your effort, your initiative, your perseverance and your dedication to your studies,” Prof Hammond said at the ceremony. “To {{those of you who have}} won our service awards, we are recognising that you have acted on your inherent capacity for love and compassion for others in concrete ways. ” The Vice Chancellor’s Medal for undergraduate studies went to the following students: School of Arts and Sciences – Nigel Hayward and Jessica Rawnsley School of Business – Gemma Thomson School of Education – Jessie Martyr School of Health Sciences – Michelle Davis School of Law – Megan Kingdon School of Medicine – Justin Barton School of Nursing – Carrie Clarkson School of Philosophy and Theology – Ryan Lister School of Physiotherapy – Arnika Lindbeck and Jonathan Mathers Mark Pearson and Helen Wilson both received the Vice Chancellor’s Medal for postgraduate studies, recognising their outstanding results in the Doctor of Counselling program...|$|R

She {{and her husband had}} written love letters to each other several years previously when living on different coasts; she rediscovered them and wondered what would happen if their daughter came across the love letters. At the same time Jones saw Shoot the Moon about a man who has an affair and thought that while the story of an affair told {{from the point of view}} of the unfaithful married man had been done man times, she had never seen the story from the point of view of the girlfriend to the married man. Jones:I put that together with the love letters and thought it would be interesting if someone came upon the love letters and realized that their parents had had an extramarital affair, if the love letters were not in fact between her mother and father, as ours were, but between the mother and a lover. In other words, what would happen if you were confronted with an understanding of a <b>time</b> period <b>in</b> <b>your</b> parents' <b>life</b> which you never really understand -- none of us have a real idea of what our parents were like in their twenties. How would that affect <b>your</b> <b>life?</b> And I thought it would be interesting if that then thrust her into an affair with a married man, trying to replicate what she saw her mother had. Basically, it was designed to be a movie about what happens to the woman outside of the marriage, who is usually, in fiction, painted as a terrible villain and often is kind of a victim who gets left in the end.Jones said she was inspired to do flashbacks by the screenplays of Harold Pinter.|$|R

In 2011, Jedi Mind Tricks released their seventh studio album Violence Begets Violence. It is the first JMT album without the production help of Stoupe The Enemy Of Mankind because Vinnie Paz and Jus Allah grew tired of waiting. Paz stated; [...] "By now you have heard that this is the first Jedi Mind Tricks album we've made without Stoupe handling the production. The bottom line is that at some point after making our last album, A History of Violence, Stoupe lost his passion for making Hip Hop and wanted to try new things. Through our career, we've always waited on him to get inspired to make a new album, but this time around we got tired of waiting out his creative drought. He tried to produce some things for this new album, but we could tell early on that his heart wasn't in making JMT records anymore. He's moved on as a producer to work in other genres with his side-projects, Dutch and Vespertina, and we've moved on with a new crop of talented producers to make the hardcore Hip Hop we've always been known for." ...|$|R
