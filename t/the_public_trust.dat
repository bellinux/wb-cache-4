This study investigates the relationship between trust and charitable giving. Charitable organizations can increase <b>the</b> <b>public’s</b> <b>trust</b> by signaling their trustworthiness. The example of the Netherlands shows how a system of accreditation can be an instrument for signaling trustworthiness to <b>the</b> <b>public.</b> Donors aware of the accreditation system have more trust in charities {{than those who are}} not aware, and they give more money to charitable causes. Charitable organizations have only limited control over <b>the</b> <b>public’s</b> <b>trust</b> because it is also rooted in a general social trust in institutions and fellow citizens. It was shown that general social trust increases the amount people give to charitable causes, even more so when people know about the accreditation system. Finally, the conditions for introducing an accreditation system are discussed. ...|$|R
40|$|Towards a more {{comprehensive}} understanding of trust: Exploring <b>the</b> <b>public’s</b> <b>trust</b> in natural resource management Chair: William T. Borrie As natural resource management agencies become increasingly cognizant of the importance building and maintaining relationships with <b>the</b> <b>public</b> {{in order to increase}} public acceptability of their management decisions, <b>the</b> <b>public’s</b> <b>trust</b> in those agencies is likely to become a long-term indicator of managerial success. This study uses a community-wide assessment of <b>public</b> <b>trust</b> in <b>the</b> U. S. Forest Service’s ability to make fire management decisions that take local values into consideration. While numerous studies have evaluated <b>the</b> <b>public’s</b> <b>trust</b> in resource management agencies, none known have attempted to take a comprehensive look at trust and its contributors. This study seeks to help fill that void. Based on a review of current trust literature, fourteen attributes that were believed to contribute to trust were identified.
