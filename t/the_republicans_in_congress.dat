500|$|Coolidge {{adopted the}} {{taxation}} policies of his Secretary of the Treasury, Andrew Mellon, {{the idea that}} [...] "scientific taxation", lower taxes, increase rather than decrease government receipts. Congress agreed, and tax rates were reduced in Coolidge's term. In addition to federal tax cuts, Coolidge proposed reductions in federal expenditures and retiring of the federal debt. Coolidge's ideas were shared by <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>in</b> <b>Congress,</b> and in 1924, Congress passed the Revenue Act of 1924, which reduced income tax rates and eliminated all income taxation for some two million people. They reduced taxes again by passing the Revenue Acts of 1926 and 1928, all the while continuing to keep spending down so as to reduce the overall federal debt. By 1927, only the wealthiest 2% of taxpayers paid any federal income tax. Federal spending remained flat during Coolidge's administration, allowing one-fourth of the federal debt to be retired in total. State and local governments saw considerable growth, however, surpassing the federal budget in 1927.|$|E

2500|$|After Roosevelt {{took office}} in 1933, New Deal {{legislation}} sailed through Congress at lightning speed. In the 1934 midterm elections, ten Republican senators went down to defeat, leaving them with only 25 against 71 Democrats. The House of Representatives was also split in a similar ratio. The [...] "Second New Deal" [...] was heavily criticized by <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>in</b> <b>Congress,</b> who likened it to class warfare and socialism. The volume of legislation, {{as well as the}} inability of the Republicans to block it, soon made the opposition to Roosevelt develop into bitterness and sometimes hatred for [...] "that man in the White House".

2500|$|Upon Lincoln's {{assassination}} in April 1865, Andrew Johnson of Tennessee, who {{had been}} elected with Lincoln in 1864 as vice president, became president. Johnson rejected the Radical program of Reconstruction and instead appointed his own governors and tried to finish reconstruction {{by the end of}} 1865. Thaddeus Stevens vehemently opposed President Johnson's plans for an abrupt end to Reconstruction, insisting that Reconstruction must [...] "revolutionize Southern institutions, habits, and manners... The foundations of their institutions... must be broken up and relaid, or all our blood and treasure have been spent in vain." [...] Johnson broke decisively with <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>in</b> <b>Congress</b> when he vetoed the Civil Rights Act in early 1865.

Johnson's friends sponsored the 1866 National Union Convention in August 1866 in Philadelphia as part of his attempt at maintaining a coalition of supporters.

The background checks provision also failed, 44-56, with Kirk being the solitary Republican supporting it. Just three Democrats—Heitkamp, Jon Tester of Montana, and Joe Manchin of West Virginia—opposed it.

50|$|Much of {{the focus}} of Clinton's foreign policy during his first term was the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina, a nation in southeastern Europe that had {{declared}} its independence from Yugoslavia in 1992. This declaration was the catalyst of a war between Bosnian Serbs, who wanted Bosnia {{to remain in the}} Yugoslav federation, and Bosnian Muslims and Croats. The Bosnian Serbs, who were supported by Serbia, were better equipped than the Muslims and the Croats; as a result, they populated and controlled much of the countryside in ways including besieging cities, such as the capital of Sarajevo. This caused widespread suffering, and in response Clinton proposed bombing Serb supply lines and lifting an embargo preventing the shipment of military arms to the former Yugoslavia (a policy known as lift and strike). European nations, however, were opposed to these moves. In 1994, Clinton opposed an effort by <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>in</b> <b>Congress</b> to lift the arms embargo, as it were, because American allies in Western Europe were still resistant to that policy.|$|E

5000|$|The most {{prominent}} scalawag {{of all was}} James L. Alcorn of Mississippi.

He supported suffrage for freedmen and endorsed the Fourteenth Amendment, as demanded by <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>in</b> <b>Congress.</b> Alcorn became the leader of the scalawags, who composed {{about a third of the}} Republicans in the state, in coalition with carpetbaggers and freedmen. Elected governor by the Republicans in 1869, he served from 1870 to 1871. As a modernizer he appointed many like-minded former Whigs, even if they were Democrats. He strongly supported education, including public schools for blacks only, and a new college for them, now known as Alcorn State University. He maneuvered to make his ally Hiram Revels its president. Radical Republicans opposed Alcorn and were angry at his patronage policy. One complained that Alcorn's policy was to see [...] "the old civilization of the South modernized" [...] rather than lead a total political, social and economic revolution.|$|E
50|$|The {{history of}} the United States from 1991 to 2008 began {{after the fall of}} the Soviet Union which {{signaled}} the end of the Cold War and left the U.S. unchallenged as the world's dominant superpower. The U.S. took a leading role in military involvement in the Middle East. The U.S. expelled an Iraqi invasion force from Kuwait, a Middle Eastern ally of the U.S., in the Persian Gulf War. On the domestic front, the Democrats returned to the White House with the election of Bill Clinton in 1992. In the 1994 midterm election, the Republicans gained control of Congress for the first time in 40 years. Strife between Clinton and <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>in</b> <b>Congress</b> initially resulted in a federal government shutdown following a budget crisis, but later they worked together to pass welfare reform, the Children's Health Insurance Program, and a balanced budget. Charges from the Lewinsky scandal led to the 1998 impeachment of Clinton by the House of Representatives but he was later acquitted by the Senate. The U.S. economy boomed in the enthusiasm for high-technology industries in the 1990s until the NASDAQ crashed as the dot-com bubble burst and the early 2000s recession marked the end of the sustained economic growth.|$|E
5000|$|With the {{nomination}} forced upon him, Seymour committed {{himself to the}} campaign. He faced considerable challenges; his opponent, General Ulysses S. Grant, enjoyed {{the support of a}} unified Republican party and most of the nation's press. While he generally adhered to the tradition that presidential nominees did not actively campaign, Seymour did undertake a tour of the Midwest and the mid-Atlantic states in mid-October. In his campaign Seymour advocated a policy of conservative, limited government, and he opposed the Reconstruction policies of <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>in</b> <b>Congress.</b> Seymour's campaign was also marked by pronounced appeals to racism with repeated attempts to brand General Grant as the [...] "Nigger" [...] candidate and Seymour as the [...] "White Man's" [...] candidate. The Republican campaign, by contrast, was the first in which they [...] "waved the bloody shirt", highlighting Seymour's support for mob violence against African Americans. Though Seymour ran fairly close to Grant in the popular vote, he was defeated decisively in the electoral vote by a count of 214 to 80. Subsequent to Seymour's loss, the Fifteenth Amendment to the federal Constitution was adopted which not only guaranteed the federal right to vote for recently emancipated slaves and others of African ancestry but also compelled New York State to reinstate voting rights for such citizens.|$|E
