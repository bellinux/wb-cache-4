5|$|Among the Antaimoro people, the {{production}} of paper embedded with flowers and other decorative natural materials is a long-established tradition that the community has begun to market to eco-tourists. Embroidery and drawn thread work are done by hand to produce clothing, as well as tablecloths and other home textiles for sale in local crafts markets. A small but growing number of fine art galleries in Antananarivo, and several other urban areas, offer paintings by local artists, and annual art events, such as the Hosotra open-air exhibition in the capital, contribute <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>continuing</b> development {{of fine arts in}} Madagascar.|$|E
5|$|Barkley {{maintained}} that Hoover's response <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>continuing</b> {{depression and the}} severe drought in 1930 were inadequate and {{pointed out that the}} $45million in loans to farmers that he approved amounted to less than half the losses sustained by Kentucky's farmers alone. He was angered that Hoover refused to call a special legislative session to adopt relief measures after the regular congressional adjourned in early March 1931. He planned a series of speeches condemning Hoover beginning in June but was injured in an automobile accident on June 22, limiting his political activities {{for the remainder of the}} year.|$|E
5|$|Most of the Baroque palazzi {{continued}} in private ownership throughout the 19th century, {{as the old}} aristocracy either married middle-class money or fell further into debt. There were a few exceptions {{and some of these}} retain the ancestral palazzo still today. Thanks <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>continuing</b> religious devotion of the Sicilian people many of the Sicilian Baroque churches are today still in the use for which they were designed.|$|E

5|$|Nyuserre {{is one of}} {{the very}} few Old Kingdom kings for whom there is {{evidence}} that the funerary cult continued uninterrupted during the First Intermediate Period, when the central authority of the pharaohs had broken down and the Egyptian state was in turmoil. The tombs of two priests Heryshefhotep I and II, who lived during this period, mention their roles and duties in the funerary establishment of Nyuserre, witnessing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>continuing</b> existence of the official mortuary cult.|$|E
5|$|Ratings {{continued}} to plummet, due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>continuing</b> success of SMTV Live. In March 2001, the BBC made an unprecedented move and extended the series over the summer, like SMTV was broadcast, but {{announced it would}} be the final series. Hill was replaced by Heather Suttie as the show was moved to BBC Scotland on 21 April until 15 September 2001 when the final show aired. It was replaced by The Saturday Show, which {{continued to}} be broadcast all year round.|$|E
5|$|Before the British Mandatory {{government}} {{took over in}} 1917, the main commercial district in Jerusalem was in the Old City. With an eye <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>continuing</b> development of new neighborhoods outside the Old City Walls, the British drew up a master town plan that called {{for the establishment of}} two commercial hubs in the New City. The first commercial district to be built was the Downtown Triangle, although it was intended to play a secondary role to the other planned commercial district in the Mamilla area, which was closer to the Old City. However, the Mamilla development did not garner as much interest as the Triangle.|$|E

5|$|Between 1996 and 2000, Saudi Arabia acceded to four UN {{human rights}} {{conventions}} and, in 2004, the government approved {{the establishment of}} the National Society for Human Rights (NSHR), staffed by government employees, to monitor their implementation. To date, the activities of the NSHR have been limited and doubts remain over its neutrality and independence. Saudi Arabia was one of only eight countries that did not accept the UN's Universal Declaration of Human Rights when it was launched in 1948. Now, only Saudi Arabia remains openly opposed to the declaration. In response <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>continuing</b> criticism of its human rights record, the Saudi government points to the special Islamic character of the country, and asserts that this justifies a different social and political order.|$|E

25|$|Unlike their {{coalition}} partners, {{and unlike}} previous American combat operations, no name was initially {{given to the}} 2014 intervention against ISIL by the U.S. government.
