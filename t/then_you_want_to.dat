The Cantometrics teaching tapes are the best thing anybody can use who wants to understand world music, classical music, pop music, whatever. That teaching kit teaches you about the qualities of music – any kind of music from any culture.” ...|$|E

60|$|The idea of {{your house}} going to the wanton expense of a flower garden!--aren't you enough? And {{what do you want}} to go and {{discourage}} the other flowers for? Is that the right spirit? is it considerate? is it kind? How do you suppose they feel when you come around--looking the way you look? And you so pink and sweet and dainty and lovely and supernatural? Why, it makes them feel embarrassed and artificial, of course; and in my opinion it is just as pathetic as it can be. Now <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> reform--dear--and do right.|$|E

That's where many good farmers fail. Bank your surplus and you get market interest, but nothing for your {{knowledge}} and experience. The money ought {{to be put into}} new teams and the latest machines, and after that into breaking new land. If you make a profit on two hundred acres, you'll increase it by a third when you break a hundred acres more, not to mention what you save by working on a larger scale. Well, I see what could be done with a united Allenwood where every man worked jointly with the rest, but the settlement needs a head." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "But then, in {{the course}} of the afternoon," [...] she continued, [...] "the old {{malignant}} heart seemed to come back again. When I came down to see the mole, I found you in such a state of mind as to take pleasure in Caleb's suffering. <b>You</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> prove that he had told a lie, and looked disappointed when I shewed you that he had not. <b>Then</b> <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> prove he had disobeyed me, when, after all, you knew very well that he had not." ...|$|R

Don't you be took in by no new saw because it's bright, and looks pretty. You want to take a saw that's been filed, and filed away till it ain't more 'n {{an inch and a half}} deep; and <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> tune it up, just so,--like a banjo--not too tight, and not too slack,--and then it'll slip through a stick o' wood like--lyin'." [...] He {{selected}} a saw, and put it in order for Lemuel. [...] "There!" [...] He picked out another. [...] "Here's my old stand-by!" [...] He took up a saw-horse, at random, to indicate that one need not be critical in that, and led through the open door into the wood-yard, where a score or two of saws were already shrilling and wheezing through the wood.|$|E

It ain't any trouble, because it's the first land you'll strike {{the other side of}} the Atlantic. If it's daytime when you strike it, bulge right on, straight west from the upper part of the Florida coast, and in an hour and three quarters you'll hit the mouth of the Mississippi--at the speed that I'm going to send you. You'll be so high up in the air that the earth will be curved considerable--sorter like a washbowl turned upside down--and you'll see a raft of rivers crawling around every which way, long before you get there, and you can pick out the Mississippi without any trouble. Then you can follow the river north nearly, an hour and three quarters, till you see the Ohio come in; <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> look sharp, because you're getting near. Away up to your left you'll see another thread coming in--that's the Missouri and is a little above St. Louis. You'll come down low then, so as you can examine the villages as you spin along. You'll pass about twenty-five in the next fifteen minutes, and you'll recognize ours when you see it--and if you don't, you can yell down and ask." ...|$|E
5000|$|This {{album is}} {{considered}} a highly refined representation of S.J. Tucker's musical talent in 2005. The tracks on this disc consist of some of her most popular and most-requested songs of that period. Her official website states: [...] "If you like rich vocal harmonies and rich, masterful musical accompaniment, <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> own Tangles!" [...] Also saying that [...] "every song on this album is somebody's favorite." [...] It {{is thought to be}} Tucker's establishing album with both Pagan and everyday audiences.|$|E

5000|$|Executive {{producer}} Jeffrey Bell {{talked about}} the more episodic aspects of the episode, saying [...] "This was a different episode for us.

And there’s a… not darker, but more of a gothic tone to it, if that makes sense." ...|$|E
5000|$|His {{portrayal}} of Johnny {{was met with}} critical praise, specifically the scenes where Johnny came out to his father. Both Strikes and Dyers sensitive performances during this scene were praised. On this particular scene, Strike said, [...] "With that scene where Johnny comes out to Mick, I was really nervous the night it aired, because {{you want it to}} look convincing but <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> do justice by the people that have been there and done it. It was a real proving ground for me, {{because it was the first}} time I actually had to do any proper drama acting." [...] In an online video on the official website, Strike said, [...] "Ive had letters and Dannys had letters saying that wed helped people to come out, and it makes things worth it." ...|$|E

It could be the single best record I own...A sugar high {{is nothing compared to}} what I felt listening to this treasure. One track isn't enough.

The Cantometrics teaching tapes are the best thing anybody can use who wants to understand world music, classical music, pop music, whatever. That teaching kit teaches you about the qualities of music - any kind of music from any culture.” Alan Lomax foresaw that computers would be an ideal way to make Cantometrics analysis available not just to scholars but to people of all ages and educational backgrounds, particularly school children. With that end in view, during the 1990s he developed The Global Jukebox, an interactive multi-media computer program designed for classrooms, museums, and libraries to visually and aurally map the world's song and dance cultures, incidentally helping people understand their own roots and those of others, while teaching geography, anthropology, and tolerance through song and dance. Since Alan Lomax's death in 2002, The Association for Cultural Equity, which Lomax founded, has been working to update the program, and make it widely available. In fulfillment of this project, as of March 2012 all the recordings of his Archive will be streamed online.|$|E
50|$|Generally speaking, wakeboard {{specific}} {{boats are}} V-drive boats. This means {{they are an}} inboard boat with the engine placed backwards {{in the rear of}} the boat. This is done to keep more weight in the back of the boat and make the wake larger. Some wakeboard specific boat models are direct drive boats where the engine is in the middle of the boat. Most wakeboard boats will have several features that help to create large wakes. These include ballast, hydrofoil, and hull technology. Ballast is a simple term for weight. When wakeboard boats have ballast tanks, it means that they have room for extra weight to weigh the boat down for larger wakes. For example. If the rider is surfing on the starboard side of the stern. <b>Then</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> activate the starboard ballast in order to give the rider a surf-able wave. All these key features would not be anything if it was not for cruise control. Cruise control innovated wake boarding. Throttles on v drive boats are extremely sensitive and it is hard to get to the desired speed of the rider. When cruise control is set the driver can push the throttle all the way down and the boat will not go any faster than the desired speed. It locks the engine in at that rpm. Cruise control is also very safe because when pulling a rider there is a lot to have to worry about. Cruise control minuses one less worry allowing for a fun wakeboard run.|$|E

40|$|As a {{field of}} study, Hmong Studies has been {{developing}} and growing over the past thirty years. Has the field developed {{to the point of}} having any clearly defined sets of key journals, publishers, authors, or institutions? Bibliometrics offers a set of tools that allows library and information researchers to look for patterns of publication which might help to answer these questions. In this initial study, using a variety of publications and databases, {{it was found that the}} field is still evolving with no clear boundaries or established “best ” journals, institutions for research or other clear patterns. “You could say that citation analysis is like fishing.

40|$|Figure 1. The {{evolution}} of the Waterfall Model (a) and its long development cycles (analysis, design, implementation, test) to the shorter, iterative devel-opment cycles within, for example, the Spiral Model (b) to Extreme Programming’s (c) blending of all these activities, {{a little at a}} time, throughout the entire software development process. 0018 - 9162 / 99 /$ 10. 00 © 1999 IEEE 70 Computer I n the beginning was the waterfall (Figure 1 a). We would get the users to tell us once and for all exactly what they wanted. We would design the system that would deliver those features. We would code it. We would test to make sure the features were delivered. All would be well. All was not well. The users didn’t tell us once and for all exactly what they wanted. They didn’t know. They contradicted themselves. They changed their minds. And the users weren’t the only problem. We programmers could think we were making great progress only to discover three-fourths of the way through that we were one-third of the way through. If long development cycles were bad because they couldn’t adapt to changes, perhaps what we needed was to make shorter development cycles. As Figure 1 b shows, the waterfall begat iterations. The waterfall model didn’t just appear. It was a rational reaction to the shocking measurement that the cost of changing a piece of software rose dramat-ically over time. If that’s true, <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> make the biggest, most far-reaching decisions as early in the life cycle as possible to avoid paying big bucks for them. The academic software engineering community took the high cost of changing software as a challenge, creating technologies like relational databases, mod-ular programming, and information hiding. What if all that hard work paid off? What if we got good at reducing the costs of ongoing changes? What if we didn’t have to settle for taking a cleaver to the water-fall? What if we could throw it in a blender? Extreme Programming turns the conventional software process sideways. Rather than planning, analyzing, and designing for the far-flung future, XP programmers do all of these activities—a little at a time—throughout development...|$|E
