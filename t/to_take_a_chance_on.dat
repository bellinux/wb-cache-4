5|$|Built by {{construction}} firm Turner Construction Company, the US$165 million Murano {{was completed}} in 2008 with residents first moving in on June 18. The building was completed with seventy percent of its units sold. As of December 31, 2008, sales on 111 units had been closed and an additional 14 units were under contract of sale. In 2008 and 2009 the late-2000s recession hurt the condominium market, with citywide sales declining 64 percent and high-end condo sales declining 24 percent. Analysts believed the Murano was overpriced based on the neighborhood, with potential buyers unwilling <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>on</b> the developing West Market Street neighborhood during a recession. In 2009, Thomas Properties Group was looking to quickly fill up the tower {{to help pay for}} condo fees and maintenance costs. On June 27, Thomas Properties Group auctioned off 40 units in the tower. The 40 units went for between US$335,000 and US$796,000, priced at nearly 20 percent less than the units sold before the auction. Thomas Properties Group priced the 137 remaining unsold units according to what similar units went for during the auction.|$|E

Though Smith insisted on casting Lee in the lead role, Miramax head Harvey Weinstein refused <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>on</b> Lee, citing the general inability of his films to gross more than $30million at the box office. The role of Fletch remained uncast, with Smith considering a list of actors including Affleck, Brad Pitt, Will Smith, and Jimmy Fallon. Though Smith considered compromising and casting Zach Braff in the role, he eventually left the project in October 2005.|$|E

500|$|The novel marked Roberts' {{return to}} {{contemporary}} romance. [...] The new series revolved around a wedding planning enterprise run by four childhood friends. [...] This first story featured the developing relationship between wedding photographer Mackensie [...] "Mac" [...] Elliot and English professor Carter Maguire. [...] Like several other Roberts novels, Vision In White explored how a protagonist balanced {{a successful career}} with a dysfunctional family environment. [...] Although the hero is a fairly typical representation of the romance novel archetype of the professor, the novel is slightly unusual for a romance in that the hero must convince the heroine <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>on</b> love.|$|E

[...] Niles Pierce recalled how Dirks was willing <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>on</b> working with a younger professor.

We have played with some [...] who can actually bring it and add their own thing to it without being a Layne clone. We're not interested in stepping on [...] rich legacy. It's a tough thing to go through. Do you take the Led Zeppelin approach and never play again, because the guy was that important? That's the approach we've taken for a lot of years. Or, do you give it a shot, try something? We're willing <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>on</b> it. It's completely a reunion because the three of us who're left are back together. But it's not about separating and forgetting — it's about remembering and moving on."

[...] Additionally, she noted that: [...] "Angelina may {{have a little bit of}} a crush on Kevin and she is not afraid to show it." [...] CBS Soaps In Depth wrote: [...] "viewers definitely can expect Angelina to make her mark in Genoa City." [...] DeGarmo confessed that she never watched daytime soap operas because she was in school, but her family was [...] "super excited" [...] about seeing her on one. Because she never had experience working on soaps, she talked about how fast-paced it was, stating: [...] "I would equate this to guerrilla theater. It’s very fast. You do your presentation and you’re done. It keeps me on my toes. I have to give my best performance at that very moment." [...] She also discussed having crossed over in the genre: [...] "Sometimes being a ‘reality’ person can be a bit of a stigma. ‘The Young and the Restless’ was willing <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>on</b> me. They are so fantastic." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1985, she {{audition}}ed for a guest spot as Cynthia in Cheers. The audition called {{for her to}} say her line and walk off the set. Cartwright decided <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>on</b> being different and continued walking, leaving the building and returning home. The production crew was confused, but she received the part. In search of more training as an actress, Cartwright joined a class taught by Hollywood coach Milton Katselas. He recommended that Cartwright study La Strada, a 1956 Italian film starring Giulietta Masina and directed by Federico Fellini. She began performing [...] "every imaginable scene" [...] from La Strada in her class and spent several months trying to secure the rights to produce a stage adaptation. She visited Italy with the intention of meeting Fellini and requesting his permission in person. Although they never met, Cartwright kept a journal of the trip and later wrote a one-woman play called In Search of Fellini, partially based on her voyage. The play was co-written by Peter Kjenaas, and Cartwright won a Drama-Logue Award after performing it in Los Angeles in 1995. In a 1998 interview, she stated her intention to make it into a feature film, which she succeeded in doing in 2017.|$|E
500|$|The show {{began as}} a single {{stand-alone}} animated short titled [...] "Adventure Time", which ran for seven minutes. It aired in January 2007 and again as part of Frederator Studios' Random! Cartoons on December 7, 2008. After its release, the short video became a viral hit on the internet. Frederator Studios then pitched an Adventure Time series to Nicktoons Network, but the network passed on it twice. The studio approached Cartoon Network, which {{said it would be}} willing to produce a series if Ward could prove the short could be expanded into a full series while maintaining elements of the original's pilot. Rob Sorcher, the chief content officer at Cartoon Network, was influential in getting the network <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>on</b> the show; he recognized the series as [...] "something that felt really indie...comic book-y [...] really new". Ward quickly rethought the concept of the pilot; he wanted a potential series to be [...] "fully realized", rather than be characterized by the [...] "pre-school vibe" [...] that permeated the original film. Ward's college friends Patrick McHale and Adam Muto helped him produce a rough storyboard that featured Finn and Princess Bubblegum going on a spaghetti-supper date. Cartoon Network was not happy with this story and asked for another. Ward then created a storyboard for the episode [...] "The Enchiridion!", which was his attempt to emulate the style of the original Nicktoons short. Cartoon Network approved the first season in September 2008, and [...] "The Enchiridion!" [...] was the first episode to enter into production.|$|E

2500|$|After {{opening with}} {{a death in}} the core Matthews family, Irna planned to follow up with an out-of-wedlock pregnancy, a septic abortion, a shooting, and murder trial. As Allen M.

She felt that with this kind of showy story she could build an {{audience}} more quickly."

2500|$|Despite his {{prolific}} college career, no NBA {{teams were}} willing <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>on</b> the undersized guard in that year's draft, {{so he went}} unselected (years later, Kobe Bryant would claim that Rashad Phillips was [...] "he best player never drafted"). Then in November, the NBA Development League began its inaugural season and held its first draft on November 1.

Bloebaum was a [...] "Bird dog" [...] scout for the Reds and he pleaded the case for his nephew. The Reds, who had recently traded away a number of prospects {{who turned out to be}} very good, decided <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>on</b> Pete.

2500|$|Sky high {{salaries}} {{also changed}} {{many of the}} strategies of the game. Players rarely were [...] "sent" [...] down to the minors if they failed to perform. Who could justify paying a slumping player millions to sit in Toledo where the major league fans couldn't pay their way? Other players in the Triple-A level of the minor leagues, who used to rise on merit, became trapped under these overpaid [...] "stars." [...] Also, {{in order to make}} the media happy, trades, rather than call-ups, became the order of the day. It was much better to buy someone else's shortstop who was a known quantity to the national sports media than <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>on</b> a player with no name value and no visibility if you were in a major market ballclub.|$|E
2500|$|Recognizing that Wagner {{should be}} {{playing at the}} highest level, Barrow {{contacted}} the Louisville Colonels, who had finished last in the National League in 1896 {{with a record of}} 38-93. They were doing better in 1897 when Barrow persuaded club president Barney Dreyfuss, club secretary Harry Pulliam, and outfielder-manager Fred Clarke to go to Paterson to see Wagner play. Dreyfuss and Clarke were not impressed with the awkward-looking man, not surprising, as Wagner was oddly built – 5-feet-11, 200 pounds, with a barrel chest, massive shoulders, heavily muscled arms, huge hands, and incredibly bowed legs that deprived him of any grace and several inches of height. Pulliam, though, persuaded Dreyfuss and Clarke <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>on</b> him. Wagner debuted with Louisville on July 19, and hit [...]338 in 61 games.|$|E
2500|$|Brandt, however, {{represented}} {{a figure of}} change, and he followed a course of social, legal, and political reforms. In 1969, Brandt gained a small majority by forming a coalition with the FDP.

This speech made Brandt, {{as well as the}} Social Democratic Party, popular among most of the students and other young West German baby-boomers who dreamed of a country that would be more open and more colorful than the frugal and still somewhat-authoritarian Bundesrepublik that had been built after World War II. However, Brandt's Neue Ostpolitik lost him {{a large part of the}} German refugee voters from East Germany, who had been significantly pro-SPD in the postwar years.|$|E

2500|$|Although RCA did not {{actively}} promote Rhymes & Reasons with a tour, Denver himself {{embarked on an}} impromptu supporting tour throughout the Midwest, stopping at towns and cities as the fashion took him, offering to play free concerts at local venues. When he was successful in persuading a school, college, American Legion hall, or local coffee-house to let him play, he would spend {{a day or so}} distributing posters in the town and could usually be counted upon to show up at the local radio station, guitar in hand, offering himself for an interview. [...] With his foot in the door as author of [...] "Leaving on a Jet Plane", he was often successful in gaining some valuable promotional airtime, usually featuring one or two songs performed live. Some venues would let him play for the [...] "door"; others restricted him to selling copies of the album at intermission and after the show. After several months of this constant low-key touring schedule, however, he had sold enough albums to persuade RCA <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>on</b> extending his recording contract.

2500|$|Change {{came when}} {{one day she}} {{showed up at the}} lot of Action Pictures, which {{produced}} B westerns, and impressed its owner Lester F. Scott, Jr., with her presence. He decided <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>on</b> a complete unknown, and she was cast in over twenty westerns in a two-year period. Only receiving $25 a picture, Arthur suffered from difficult working conditions: [...] "The films were generally shot on location, often in the desert near Los Angeles, under a scorching sun that caused throats to parch and make-up to run. Running water was nowhere to be found, and even outhouses were a luxury not always present. The extras on these films were often real cowboys, tough men who were used to roughing it and who had little use for those who were not." [...] The films were moderately successful in second-rate Midwestern theaters, though Arthur received no official attention. Aside from appearing in films for Action Pictures between 1924 and 1926, she appeared in some independent westerns including The Drug Store Cowboy (1925), and westerns for Poverty Row, as well as having an uncredited bit part in Buster Keaton's Seven Chances (1925).|$|E
