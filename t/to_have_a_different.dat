5|$|Comets are {{distinguished}} from asteroids {{by the presence}} of an extended, gravitationally unbound atmosphere surrounding their central nucleus. This atmosphere has parts termed the coma (the central part immediately surrounding the nucleus) and the tail (a typically linear section consisting of dust or gas blown out from the coma by the Sun's light pressure or outstreaming solar wind plasma). However, extinct comets that have passed close to the Sun many times have lost nearly all of their volatile ices and dust and may come to resemble small asteroids. Asteroids are thought <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> origin from comets, having formed inside the orbit of Jupiter rather than in the outer Solar System. The discovery of main-belt comets and active centaur minor planets has blurred the distinction between asteroids and comets.|$|E

Transversions are all assumed to occur at the same rate, but that rate is allowed to be different from both of the rates for transitions.|$|E
25|$|Neutrino {{oscillation}} is {{a quantum}} mechanical phenomenon whereby a neutrino created {{with a specific}} lepton flavor (electron, muon, or tau) can later be measured <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> flavor.

30|$|Hansen et al. {{reported}} on wb-MRA for screening for atherosclerotic disease in 307 elderly patients. In Hansen’s collective, {{two-thirds of the}} subjects had vascular abnormalities, of which one third showed stenosis of less than 50 % and a third was found <b>to</b> <b>have</b> luminal narrowing greater than 50 %. The remaining individuals showed no vascular abnormalities. Whereas in our cohort only 37 % had vascular pathologies, one <b>has</b> <b>to</b> consider that {{the median age of}} Hansen’s cohort was 14 years older than the median age of our participants, in addition <b>to</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> distribution of males and females. According to our results, most of relevant luminal narrowing detected by Hansen was located in the arteries of the lower legs.|$|R

25|$|South West Trains TOC opened Travel Centres {{at many of}} {{its larger}} stations, for booking of more complex journeys, and wanted each one <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> code {{from that of the}} station to {{differentiate}} revenue derived from Travel Centre bookings, typically more complex and lengthy and often of high monetary value.

25|$|The {{environment}} of El Jebha {{is known for}} its clean and natural beaches, which all seem <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> appearance. The bays behind the eastern mountain are ideal to enjoy the sun and the beach in absolute solitude. On the other hand, the beaches {{on the west side of}} El Jebha are more accessible and characterised by a somewhat rough surface and grey sand. The beaches of the west are more crowded than the bays of the east.|$|E
25|$|The Western films {{directed}} by Sergio Leone were felt by some <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> tone than the Hollywood Westerns. Veteran American actors Charles Bronson, Lee Van Cleef and Clint Eastwood became famous by starring in Spaghetti Westerns, although the films {{also provided a}} showcase for other noted actors such as James Coburn, Henry Fonda, Klaus Kinski, and Jason Robards. Eastwood, previously {{the lead in the}} television series Rawhide, unexpectedly found himself catapulted into the forefront of the film industry by Leone's A Fistful of Dollars.|$|E

25|$|The Sami {{languages}} are indigenous minority languages in Scandinavia. They belong {{to their own}} branch of the Uralic language family and are unrelated to the North Germanic languages other than by limited grammatical (particularly lexical) characteristics resulting from prolonged contact. Sami is divided into several languages or dialects. Consonant gradation is a feature in both Finnish and northern Sami dialects, {{but it is not}} present in south Sami, which is considered <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> language history. According to the Sami Information Centre of the Sami Parliament in Sweden, southern Sami may have originated in an earlier migration from the south into the Scandinavian peninsula.|$|E
25|$|The {{structure}} of AZA1(MW 841.5) was first reported in 1998 after successful isolation from Irish blue mussel (Mytilus edulis) material. A cyclic amine (or aza group), a unique tri-spiro-assembly and a carboxylic acid group {{gave rise to}} the name AZA-SPIR-ACID. The original structure reported in 1998 was found to contain an error, after attempts of synthesis were carried out in 2003. The synthesized compound was found <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> chromatographic behaviour and discrepancies in its nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrum compared to the compound isolated from natural sources. Further extensive study of the NMR spectra and more analysis resulted in structure revision in 2004.|$|E
25|$|Lighting {{designers}} sometimes select filters {{by color}} temperature, commonly to match light that is theoretically white. Since fixtures using discharge type lamps produce a {{light of a}} considerably higher color temperature than do tungsten lamps, using the two in conjunction could potentially produce a stark contrast, so sometimes fixtures with HID lamps, commonly producing light of 6000–7000K, are fitted with 3200K filters to emulate tungsten light. Fixtures with color mixing features or with multiple colors, (if including 3200K) are also capable of producing tungsten-like light. Color temperature {{may also be a}} factor when selecting lamps, since each is likely <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> color temperature.|$|E

25|$|Caine's {{previous}} three novels {{had been published}} by Chatto & Windus, but after the success of The Deemster Caine was determined <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> form of contract to receive royalties and retain the copyright. He discussed the contract with Chatto & Windus throughout November 1889 but on 6 December Andrew Chatto amicably wrote to refuse the terms, stating that the sales of The Deemster, although great, did not justify the contract and the substantial advance that Caine was asking for. Caine then turned to Heinemann, which was seeking the novel to lead {{the launch of the}} new publishing company. Caine had been introduced to Wolcott Balestier, the business partner of William Heinemann, not long before by his friend, Bram Stoker. Because Heinemann were willing to outbid Chatto & Windus, and include Caine's retention of the copyright, Caine moved to Heinemann.|$|E
25|$|This {{season was}} the first one <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> winner, other than Wayamba Elevens who had won all the {{previous}} 3 tournaments. Ruhuna Elevens won the tournament and qualified for CLT20 to be held in India. The fourth season of the Inter-Provincial Twenty20 was to be replaced by the Sri Lankan Premier League. There were franchise teams along with the inclusion of two extra provinces and the tournament was to allow international players to play, however the 2011 Sri Lanka Premier League was postponed due to allegations of corruption and incompetence by Sri Lanka Cricket. The Board of Control for Cricket in India had also decided not to allow Indian players to play in the tournament which later became the primary cause. Ruhuna elevens win their first Inter-Provincial Twenty20 tournament and qualifies for the qualifying stage of the 2011 Champions League Twenty20.|$|E
25|$|Vaitupuan {{tradition}} is that chance favoured their efforts, a ship sent {{to collect the}} last payment sank, as did the second ship the trading schooner Vaitupulemele. By the time a third ship arrived {{most of the money}} had been collected. However, the trading schooner Vaitupulemele appears <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> role in the history of Vaitupu. The creation of the debt that was repaid to Ruge & Co extended beyond the purchase of goods on credit to include the purchase price of the Vaitupulemele by the Vaitupu Company. While T.M. Williams had been the Ruge agent, he later formed the Vaitupu Company with the Vaitupuan community and purchased the Vaitupulemele from Ruge & Co. However the schooner was lost during a voyage from Samoan and soon after Williams died, leaving no accounting for copra that had been shipped from Vaitupu. In any event the Vaitupuans paid the full amount claimed by Ruge & Co, although that company soon after went into liquidation.|$|E

Wilders' views on Islam prompted the Mayor of Rotterdam, Ahmed Aboutaleb, to reprimand him.|$|E
