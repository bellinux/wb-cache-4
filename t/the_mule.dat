5|$|Familiar {{examples}} of equid hybrids are <b>the</b> <b>mule,</b> {{a cross between}} a female horse and a male donkey, and the hinny, {{a cross between a}} female donkey and a male horse. Pairs of complementary types like <b>the</b> <b>mule</b> and hinny are called reciprocal hybrids.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>mule,</b> {{especially}} its fur, was intensely textured and detailed {{to make it}} look visually rough and bristly, and <b>the</b> <b>mule</b> itself weary and worn. The same techniques were applied to the red and yellow adornments draped and hung over the animal.|$|E
5|$|Napoleon is seen wearing {{clothing}} {{appropriate for}} his location: over his uniform {{he wears a}} long topcoat which is wrapped firmly around him, in which he keeps his gloveless right hand warm. He retains {{a piece of his}} dignity in the gold-trimmed black bicorne he wears on his head. <b>The</b> <b>mule</b> Napoleon rides is undernourished, tired from its ordeal in struggling through the Alps. On the left of <b>the</b> <b>mule</b> is his guide, Pierre Nicholas Dorsaz, who must constantly push himself and <b>the</b> <b>mule</b> forward, and who leans heavily on the shaft of wood he clutches in his left hand to allow himself to continue moving forward. His clothes are weather-beaten, his face ruddy from the cold. He is not allowed the luxury of riding an animal, for he must be able to navigate independently, on the ground.|$|E

50|$|In 1975, Tom Smith {{took over}} the program for five years. During his five years as head coach, Smith led <b>the</b> <b>Mules</b> to an 86-46 overall record, winning the MIAA Championship in the 1979-80 season. After Smith left, Iowa State coach, Lynn Nance, was hired. During Nance's first season, <b>the</b> <b>Mules</b> won <b>the</b> conference championship. The next two seasons, Nance {{compiled}} a record of 43-16 overall and 17-7 conference record. In the 1983-84 season, Nance led <b>the</b> <b>Mules</b> to <b>the</b> MIAA Conference Championship and the NCAA Men's Division II Basketball Championship. The following year, Nance led <b>the</b> <b>Mules</b> to another conference championship and finished his career at Central Missouri with a 114-35 record.|$|R
25|$|Football was Muhlenberg's first {{official}} varsity sport, beginning in 1900. But it wasn't until Ben Schwartzwalder became the coach in 1946 {{that the program}} really lifted off the ground. In his first year, Schwartzwalder guided <b>the</b> <b>Mules</b> to a 9-1 record and a national championship, defeating St. Bonaventure in the Tobacco Bowl. The following year, Schwartzwalder again led <b>the</b> <b>Mules</b> to a 9-1 record, with the only loss coming by one point to Temple. However, <b>the</b> <b>Mules</b> declined {{an invitation to the}} Tangerine Bowl.|$|R
5|$|About 170 {{species of}} birds visit the park each year, {{including}} swifts and swallows. Most species migrate to warmer regions in winter, although jays, ravens, nuthatches, eagles, and owls stay. In winter, <b>the</b> <b>mule</b> deer, cougars, and coyotes migrate to lower elevations. Ground squirrels and marmots pass the winter in hibernation.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} large {{herbivore}} is the black-tailed deer, a subspecies of <b>the</b> <b>mule</b> deer. Elk and moose are less common. Mountain goats are well-adapted to steep terrain and cold temperatures, {{and are not}} usually found at lower elevations. There are eight species of bats {{that live in the}} North Cascades.|$|E
5|$|The stories The Girl with <b>the</b> <b>Mule</b> (alternately titled <b>The</b> <b>Mule</b> Without a Bridle) and Hunbaut feature Gawain in {{beheading}} game situations. In Hunbaut, Gawain {{cuts off}} a man's head and, {{before he can}} replace it, removes the magic cloak keeping the man alive, thus killing him. Several stories tell of knights who struggle {{to stave off the}} advances of voluptuous women sent by their lords as a test; these stories include Yder, the Lancelot-Grail, Hunbaut, and The Knight of the Sword. The last two involve Gawain specifically. Usually the temptress is the daughter or wife of a lord to whom the knight owes respect, and the knight is tested {{to see whether or not}} he will remain chaste in trying circumstances.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Mules</b> entered <b>the</b> 2016 {{season after}} {{finishing}} with an 8-3 record, overall and in conference play, last season under Svoboda.

5|$|The {{studbook}} for the Poitevin {{horse was}} created by the Société Centrale d'Agriculture des Deux-Sèvres on June 26, 1884, with a horse section and a donkey section. The first edition was released December 31, 1885, setting the physical criteria for the breeding and ending the practice of promoting crossbred horses as purebreds. It also marked the end of government intervention against <b>the</b> <b>mule</b> breeding industry, although bonuses were paid to encourage farmers to breed purebred horses. In 1902, a breeding syndicate to promote Poitou mules was created, but disappeared after a lack of advertising by stock breeders. On August 6, 1912, the French government released a decree officially supporting <b>the</b> <b>mule</b> breeding industry, backed by the purchase of mules by the French National Stud and bonuses given to the best stallions.|$|E
5|$|Characters can equip weapons, armor, rings, and amulets, {{which provide}} attack or defense points, or give bonuses {{to some other}} statistic. There are also usable items such as potions to restore a character's health or mana. Weapons, armor, and other items are found by killing enemies, {{breaking}} containers, or by purchase from vendors. Each character has an inventory, represented as a fixed grid, with each item depicted by a shape taking up spaces on the grid. One character type, <b>the</b> <b>mule,</b> cannot use weapons or magic, but has a much larger inventory.|$|E
5|$|Equine {{species can}} crossbreed with each other. The most common hybrid is <b>the</b> <b>mule,</b> {{a cross between}} a male donkey and a female horse. With rare exceptions, these hybrids are sterile and cannot reproduce. A related hybrid, a hinny, is {{a cross between a}} male horse and a female donkey. Other hybrids include the zorse, a cross between a zebra and a horse and a zonkey or zedonk, a hybrid of a zebra and a donkey. In areas where Grévy's zebras are {{sympatric}} with plains zebras, fertile hybrids do occur.|$|E

5|$|I Bonaparte {{chose to}} ride across the alps on a mule (obtained at a convent at Martigny) {{rather than a}} steed, the typical gentleman's mount at the time, because <b>the</b> <b>mule</b> was {{considered}} to be more sure-footed on the slippery slopes and narrow passes of the Alps, and to be more sturdy and hardy while making such a perilous journey on such volatile terrain.|$|E
5|$|In May 1980 {{wildlife}} researcher Brad Griffith of the University of Idaho {{started a}} three-year study to mark and count <b>the</b> <b>mule</b> {{deer in the}} monument. The National Park Service was concerned that the local herd might grow so large that it would damage its habitat. Griffith found that this group of mule deer has developed a drought evasion strategy unique for its species.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} half of the 20th century, <b>the</b> <b>mule</b> {{breeding}} industry collapsed with the advent of mechanization. By 1922, Poitevin foals became difficult to sell, and the population dropped dramatically as there was no economic incentive for breeding. A continued breeding of mules caused the breed to decline faster than other draft breeds, as purebred horses were not bred as often. By 1945, breed selection was oriented towards the production of meat, as the only remaining economic opportunity for farmers. The conformation of the breed changed slightly to become shorter, but the Poitevin remained unprofitable for horse meat, as breeders preferred to invest in herds of Comtois and Breton horses, which were faster growing and higher yielding.|$|E
2500|$|The Second Battle of Cabin Creek {{began at}} 1:00 A.M. on September 19. The Confederates {{advanced}} with the Texans covering the left flank and the Indian Brigade {{on the right}} flank. After the Union troops began to fire, the Confederate artillery answered. The barrage caused <b>the</b> <b>mules</b> to panic and run. Many dragged their wagons with them. Some were so terrified that they fell off the bluff and into Cabin Creek. The teamsters managed cut many of <b>the</b> <b>mules</b> from their traces.

5|$|A {{tradition}} of cottage spinning and weaving and improvements to spinning technology by local inventors, Richard Arkwright and Samuel Crompton, led to {{rapid growth of}} the textile industry in the 19th century. Crompton, whilst living at Hall i' th' Wood, invented the ] in 1779. Streams draining the surrounding moorland into the River Croal provided the water necessary for the bleach works that were a feature of this area. Bleaching using chlorine {{was introduced in the}} 1790s by the Ainsworths at Halliwell Bleachworks. Bolton and the surrounding villages had more than thirty bleachworks including the Lever Bank Bleach Works in the Irwell Valley. <b>The</b> <b>mule</b> revolutionised cotton spinning by combining the roller drafting of Arkwright's water frame with the carriage drafting and spindle tip twisting of James Hargreaves's spinning jenny, producing a high quality yarn. Self-acting mules were used in Bolton mills until the 1960s producing fine yarn. The earliest mills were situated by the streams and river as at Barrow Bridge, but steam power led to the construction of the large multi-storey mills and their chimneys that dominated Bolton's skyline, some of which survive today.|$|E
5|$|One more legend narrated {{is about}} the goddess painted on a thangka in the monastery which is of Palden Lhamo. This female deity is {{compared}} to the Hindu Goddess Kali. Like Kali, Palden Lhamo's thangka is drawn in black colour, with flaming eyes, dressed in skirt made of tiger skin, and a garland of skulls around her neck. A moon disc adorns her hair, {{similar to the one}} seen on Shiva. She is also associated with Goddess Saraswati and Ma Tara. Legend also states that in the past she had lived in Sri Lanka as the consort of a demon king who practiced human sacrifice. As she was not supportive of this practice she fled from the kingdom. As she was running away, the king shot her shot with an arrow, which struck the backside of <b>the</b> <b>mule</b> that she was riding. When she drew out the arrow, it left a gaping hole in the mule's back, and through this gap Palden Lhamo could watch the teachings of Lord Buddha.|$|E
25|$|The plan {{came close}} to failure in Foundation and Empire because of the mutant called <b>The</b> <b>Mule.</b> Because <b>the</b> <b>Mule</b> had psychic powers of mind control, he did not fit the model of {{interactions}} psychohistory was based upon. <b>The</b> <b>Mule</b> could influence men at a distance, unlike Second Foundation agents, who required eye contact. <b>The</b> <b>Mule</b> was eventually lured to a remote planet to destroy the Second Foundation. However, in so doing, he left his main fleet, which was turned against him by Second Foundation agents in his absence, thus ending his rule.|$|E

25|$|An {{external}} threat {{arises in}} the form of a mysterious man who is known only as <b>the</b> <b>Mule.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Mule</b> (whose real name is never revealed) is a mutant, and possesses the ability to sense and manipulate the emotions of others, usually creating fear and/or total devotion within his victims. He uses this ability to take over the independent systems bordering the Foundation, and has them wage a war against it.
