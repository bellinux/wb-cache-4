50|$|Four-terminal sensing is {{also known}} as Kelvin sensing, after William Thomson, Lord Kelvin, who invented the Kelvin bridge in 1861 to measure very low {{resistances}} using four-terminal sensing. Each <b>two-wire</b> <b>connection</b> can be called a Kelvin connection. A pair of contacts that is designed to connect a force-and-sense pair to a single terminal or lead simultaneously is called a Kelvin contact. A clip, often a crocodile clip, that connects a force-and-sense pair is called a Kelvin clip.|$|E
5000|$|A minimal [...] "3-wire" [...] RS-232 {{connection}} consisting only of transmit data, receive data, and ground, {{is commonly}} used when the full facilities of RS-232 are not required. Even a <b>two-wire</b> <b>connection</b> (data and ground) can be used if the data flow is one way (for example, a digital postal scale that periodically sends a weight reading, or a GPS receiver that periodically sends position, if no configuration via RS-232 is necessary). When only hardware flow control is required in addition to two-way data, the RTS and CTS lines are added in a 5-wire version.|$|E
40|$|For {{more than}} 20 years, the thermal mass flow meters {{have been widely}} used in several {{industries}} such as the petroleum refining industry, waste water processing and steeling making industry. I will call it “TMF” {{in the rest of the}} article. The TMF’ low-flow sensitivity and fast response have made them the first choice for many critical gas flow application. However, there are still some inadequacies in the TMF. Such as interruption among the wires, high cost of the installation and influenced by temperature. Some of the problem comes from its way of the connection [...] - four-wire connection. <b>Two-wire</b> <b>connection</b> can resolve some of these problems. In this thesis, the author presents a new type of two-wire installation and use of TMF which can be realized low production cost. The author found a new measurement method, which is detecting the functional relationship between working current of a traditional TMF and the flow. The author also designs a measurement converter needed for adequate signal processing so that flow value measurement values can be shown in computers...|$|E
50|$|Lead-wire {{resistance}} {{can also}} be a factor; adopting three- and four-wire, instead of <b>two-wire,</b> <b>connections</b> can eliminate connection-lead resistance effects from measurements (see below); three-wire connection is sufficient for most purposes and is an almost universal industrial practice. Four-wire connections are used for the most precise applications.|$|R
50|$|Stored-program analog {{switches}} {{such as the}} 1ESS switch, {{had both}} simple wire junctors and circuit junctors. Circuit junctors were {{in the form of}} plug-in circuit boards to provide talk battery and supervision for intraoffice calls and were closely similar to intraoffice trunk packs, with two scan points and two signal distributor points per circuit, two circuits per plug-in pack. Wire junctors were <b>two-wire</b> <b>connections</b> between trunk nets and other trunk nets or line nets. When three-way calling was introduced, three-port conference trunks were used, which only appeared on trunk nets. All junctors appeared in subgroups of sixteen on plugs or jacks at the Junctor Grouping Frame, where as many subgroups as required were plugged into other trunk nets, line nets, or circuit junctor frames.|$|R
5000|$|First, {{integrated}} circuit piezoelectric (ICP) accelerometers {{have a very}} high signal output, better resolution and the easy of <b>two-wire</b> electrical <b>connections</b> compared to piezoresistive technology. Mechanical isolation of ferroelectric ceramic accelerometers, coupled with an internal 2-pole filter available in an ICP circuit, is allowing piezoelectric accelerometers to operate successfully at higher G-levels than were previously achievable. Good design practices are allowing their elastomeric isolation materials to perform in a dynamically linear fashion within the accelerometers.|$|R
50|$|During the 1980s, class-4 tandem {{switches}} {{were converted}} to deal only with high-speed digital four-wire circuit connections: T1, T3, OC-3, etc. The <b>two-wire</b> local line <b>connections</b> to individual telephones were relegated to the class-5 switches. By {{the dawn of the}} 21st century, almost all other switches also supported four-wire connections.|$|R
