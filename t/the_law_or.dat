5|$|A {{crime is}} {{committed}} if any person posts or distributes a placard, circular or other document which contains an incitement to violence, counsels disobedience to <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>or</b> a lawful order, or {{is likely to}} lead to a breach of the peace. Spreading false reports or making false statements likely to cause public alarm orally, in writing, or in any newspaper, periodical, book, circular or other printed publication is also an offence.|$|E
5|$|Older {{accounts}} of the Whiskey Rebellion portrayed it as being confined to western Pennsylvania, yet there was opposition to the whiskey tax in the western counties of every other state in Appalachia (Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia). The whiskey tax went uncollected throughout the frontier state of Kentucky, where {{no one could be}} convinced to enforce <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>or</b> prosecute evaders. In 1792, Hamilton advocated military action to suppress violent resistance in western North Carolina, but Attorney General Edmund Randolph argued that there was insufficient evidence to legally justify such a reaction.|$|E
5|$|Vaughan Williams {{was born}} at Down Ampney, Gloucestershire, the third child and younger son of the vicar, the Reverend Arthur Vaughan Williams (1834–1875) and his wife, Margaret, née Wedgwood (1842–1937). His {{paternal}} forebears were of mixed English and Welsh descent; many of them went into <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>or</b> the Church. The judges Sir Edward and Sir Roland Vaughan Williams were respectively Arthur's father and brother. Margaret Vaughan Williams was a great-granddaughter of Josiah Wedgwood and niece of Charles Darwin.|$|E

5|$|On 1 September 1967 {{at his own}} trial Bukovsky {{used his}} final words to attack the regime's failure to respect <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>or</b> follow legal procedures. He invoked Article 125 of the (still current) 1936 Soviet Constitution to defend the right to {{organize}} demonstrations and other public protests. He further suggested that the prosecution had repeatedly failed to observe the revised 1961 Code of Criminal Procedure in its conduct of the case. Bukovsky's final words in court circulated widely in a samizdat collection of such addresses {{and as part of}} a collection of materials about the demonstration and subsequent trials compiled by Pavel Litvinov.|$|E
25|$|On September 20, {{over one}} {{thousand}} members of WSP rallied at the White House. The police used brutal tactics {{to try to}} limit it to 100 people (as per <b>the</b> <b>law)</b> <b>or</b> stop the demonstration, and the event tarnished the wholesome and nonviolent reputation of the WSP.|$|E
25|$|A {{significant}} number of renegades lived in Algiers at the time, Christians converted voluntarily to Islam, many fleeing <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>or</b> other problems at home.

25|$|The show starred Dennis Waterman as Terry McCann, {{an honest}} and likable {{bodyguard}} (minder in London slang) and George Cole as Arthur Daley, a socially ambitious, but highly unscrupulous importer-exporter, wholesaler, used-car salesman and purveyor {{of anything else}} from which there was money to be made, whether within <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>or</b> not.|$|E
25|$|Some tax protesters {{argue that}} there is no law {{imposing}} a Federal income tax or requiring the filing of a return, or that the government is obligated to show the tax protesters <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>or</b> tell the protesters why they are subject to tax, or that the government has refused to disclose the law.|$|E

25|$|Although {{the first}} arrivals were almost entirely {{made up of}} convicts and soldiers, {{it was not long}} before rumours of Van Diemen's Land began to attract free settlers, {{allowing}} Hobart Town to grow. But Hobart Town's isolation also led to a large number of 'undesirables' seeking to escape from former crimes, escaping <b>the</b> <b>law,</b> <b>or</b> just looking for a life of solitude finding their way to the fledgling town. The area around the docks was rife with crime and prostitution, and heavy drinking and fighting were common.|$|E
25|$|He {{took up the}} new {{position}} on September 25, 1584. He now held {{the three most important}} positions in the colony. With this concentration of power, he was able to remedy many of the prevalent abuses, with immediate punishment for those found to be transgressors of <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>or</b> of decency. This resulted in much enmity among the governing class, but the lower classes proclaimed him as their defender. He was able to increase rents and payments to Spain considerably.|$|E
25|$|Rape charges can {{be brought}} and a case proven based on the sole {{testimony}} of the victim, providing that circumstantial evidence supports the allegations. It is these strict criteria of proof which lead to the frequent observation that where injustice against women does occur, it is not because of Islamic law.

50|$|The Trial Chamber further {{found that}} Martić ordered the {{shelling}} of Zagreb on 2 and 3 May 1995 with Orkan Rockets, containing cluster munitions. It held that he incurred individual criminal responsibility pursuant to Article 7(1) of the Statute for ordering under Count 15, murder {{as a crime}} against humanity; Count 16, murder {{as a violation of}} <b>the</b> <b>laws</b> <b>or</b> customs of war; Count 17, inhumane acts as a crime against humanity; Count 18, cruel treatment as a violation of <b>the</b> <b>laws</b> <b>or</b> customs of war; and Count 19, attacks on civilians as a violation of <b>the</b> <b>laws</b> <b>or</b> customs of war. The Trial Chamber did not enter convictions under Counts 16 and 18, having found that these crimes were impermissibly cumulative with Count 19. The Trial Chamber sentenced Martić, in absentia, to a single sentence of thirty-five years imprisonment.|$|R
25|$|In October 2016, {{a federal}} judge ruled that the {{daughter}} of a married lesbian couple must be registered with the surnames of both her mothers. The judge argued that denying the application for registration of the newborn violates the interests of the child and violates the right to identity (i.e. name, nationality and affiliation). A few days later, the head of the Civil Registry announced that the state will continue refusing to register both surnames of same-sex parents unless Congress changes <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>or</b> if more amparos are granted by the courts.|$|E
25|$|In the Susiya synagogue, {{the hand}} of God appears on the defaced remains of a marble bimah screen that perhaps once {{illustrated}} a biblical scene such as Moses Receiving <b>the</b> <b>Law</b> <b>or</b> the Binding of Isaac. Though the hand was subjected to intense iconoclastic hacking, the iconoclasts left some vestiges of the thumb and the receding fingers intact. A thumbnail has been carved into the thumb. Foerster asserts that {{the hand of}} God originally held a Torah scroll, identifying the small piece of raised marble located between the thumb and fingers as a Torah scroll.|$|E
25|$|When a law {{or other}} act of {{government}} is challenged {{as a violation of}} individual liberty under the Due Process Clause, courts now use two forms of scrutiny or judicial review. The inquiry balances the importance of the governmental interest being served and the appropriateness of the method of implementation against the resulting infringement of individual rights. If the governmental action infringes upon a fundamental right, the highest level of review, strict scrutiny, is used. To pass strict scrutiny, <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>or</b> the act must be both narrowly tailored and the least restrictive means of furthering a compelling government interest.|$|E

25|$|I confess that, as {{a student}} unaware {{of the history of}} the subject and unaware of the {{connection}} with cyclotomy, I did not find <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>or</b> its so-called elementary proofs appealing. I suppose, although I would not have (and could not have) expressed myself in this way that I saw it as little more than a mathematical curiosity, fit more for amateurs than for the attention of the serious mathematician that I then hoped to become. It was only in Hermann Weyl's book on the algebraic theory of numbers that I appreciated it as anything more.|$|E
25|$|The book {{consists}} of three sermons or speeches delivered to the Israelites by Moses on the plains of Moab, shortly before they enter the Promised Land. The first sermon recounts the forty years of wilderness wanderings which have led to this moment, and ends with an exhortation to observe <b>the</b> <b>law</b> (<b>or</b> teachings), later {{referred to as the}} Law of Moses; the second reminds the Israelites of the need for monotheism and observance of the laws (or teachings) he has given them, on which their possession of the land depends; and the third offers the comfort that even should Israel prove unfaithful and so lose the land, with repentance all can be restored.|$|E
25|$|Unlike some {{breaches}} of Law 41, a No ball only {{attracts the}} No ball penalty (e.g. one run), {{there are no}} provisions in <b>the</b> <b>Law</b> <b>or</b> in common regulations for five penalty runs to be awarded to the batting team, {{and there are no}} incidents when five penalty runs are awarded that would require a No ball to be called, although scenarios exist in which five penalty runs might be awarded when the ball is in play and would count in the over, were it not a No ball for the reasons given here, for example: repeated damage to the wicket by the fielding team during a No ball, or the ball hits a helmet on the ground during a No ball.|$|E
