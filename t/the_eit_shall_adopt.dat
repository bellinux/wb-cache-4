40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{development}} and significance of the European Institute of Technology (<b>EIT)</b> in <b>the</b> period since 2005 when the European Union launched a suite of initiatives for higher education, research and innovation, including <b>the</b> <b>EIT,</b> {{as part of a}}ttempts to re-launch its Lisbon Strategy around a ‘growth and jobs’ agenda. <b>The</b> <b>EIT</b> is presented as implicated in European Commission attempts to redefine the mandates and governance of higher education institutions as part of a knowledge-based economy route to economic and social development. The production and contestation of <b>the</b> <b>EIT</b> as it was negotiated within EU institutions is shown as having been conditioned by the interactions between Commission attempts to use <b>the</b> <b>EIT</b> to disrupt <b>the</b> governance and financing of higher education and research and national and institutional determination to constrain <b>the</b> <b>EIT</b> within extant governance and financing principles. In conclusion, the paper outlines a research agenda for the study and analysis of <b>the</b> <b>EIT</b> in <b>the</b> period up to 2013 which will make it possible to specify the significance of <b>the</b> <b>EIT</b> for EU integration, the development of the European higher education, research and innovation fields, the fate of EU strategies for capital accumulation and social development and the legitimacy of the EU itself...|$|R

25|$|As {{noted in}} the {{preceding}} section, between 1990–1999, {{there was a large}} reduction in the emissions of <b>the</b> <b>EITs.</b> <b>The</b> reduction in <b>the</b> <b>EITs</b> is largely responsible for the total (aggregate) reduction (excluding LULUCF) in emissions of the Annex I countries, excluding the US. Emissions of the Annex II countries (Annex I minus <b>the</b> <b>EIT</b> countries) have experienced a limited increase in emissions from 1990–2006, followed by stabilization and a more marked decrease from 2007 onwards. The emissions reductions in the early nineties by <b>the</b> 12 <b>EIT</b> countries who have since joined the EU, assist the present EU-27 in meeting its collective Kyoto target.|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the relationship between}} two flare-associated waves, a chromospheric Moreton wave and a coronal EIT wave, based on an analysis of an X-class flare event in AR 8100 on 1997 November 4. A Moreton wave was observed in Hα, Hα + 0. 8 Å, and Hα − 0. 8 A ̊ with the Flare-Monitoring Telescope (FMT) at the Hida Observatory. An EIT wave was observed in EUV with the Extreme ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (EIT) on board SOHO. The propagation speeds of the Moreton wave and <b>the</b> <b>EIT</b> wave were approximately 715 kms− 1 and 202 kms− 1, respec-tively. The times of visibility for the Moreton wave did not overlap those of <b>the</b> <b>EIT</b> wave, but <b>the</b> continuation of the former is indicated by a filament oscillation. Data on the speed and location clearly show that the Moreton wave differed physically from <b>the</b> <b>EIT</b> wave in this case. The Moreton wave preceded <b>the</b> <b>EIT</b> wave, which is inconsistent with an identification of <b>the</b> <b>EIT</b> wave with a fast-mode MHD shock...|$|R

40|$|Electromagnetically induced {{transparency}} (EIT) is {{a promising}} {{technology for the}} enhancement of light-matter interactions, and recent demonstrations of <b>the</b> quantum <b>EIT</b> realized in artificial micro-structured medium have remarkably reduced the extreme requirement for experimental observation of EIT spectrum.

40|$|We {{propose a}} novel {{configuration}} that utilizes electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) to tailor a fiber mode propagating inside a thin optical fiber and coherently control its dispersion properties to drastically reduce the group {{velocity of the}} fiber mode.

We show how {{the properties of the}} fiber mode is modified due to <b>the</b> <b>EIT</b> medium, both numerically and analytically. We demonstrate that the group velocity of the new modified fiber mode can be drastically reduced (approximately 44 m/sec) using the coherently prepared orthohydrogen doped in a matrix of parahydrogen crystal as <b>the</b> <b>EIT</b> medium.

40|$|The electromagnetically induced {{transparency}} (EIT) {{phenomenon has}} been investigated in a Λ-system of the ^ 87 Rb D_ 1 line in an external transverse magnetic field. Two spectroscopic cells having strongly different values of the relaxation rates γ_rel are used: a Rb cell with antirelaxation coating (L∼ 1 cm) and a Rb nanometric-thin cell (nano-cell) with thickness of the atomic vapor column L= 795 nm. For <b>the</b> <b>EIT</b> in <b>the</b> nano-cell, we have <b>the</b> usual <b>EIT</b> resonances characterized by {{a reduction in the}} absorption (i. e. dark resonance (DR)), whereas for <b>the</b> <b>EIT</b> in <b>the</b> Rb cell with an antirelaxation coating, the resonances demonstrate an increase in the absorption (i. e. bright resonances). We suppose that such unusual behavior of <b>the</b> <b>EIT</b> resonances (i. e. the reversal of the sign from DR to BR) is caused by the influence of alignment process. The influence of alignment strongly depends on the configuration of the coupling and probe frequencies {{as well as on the}} configuration of the magnetic field. Comment: 9 pages, 23 figure...|$|R
