25|$|Before the Remedy Acquisition, BMC had {{had trouble}} {{integrating}} acquired technology into its <b>tool</b> <b>set,</b> Beauchamp {{said in a}} conference call, while Remedy software has been integrating with BMC for years. Remedy had been acquired by Peregrine Systems in 2001, but in 2002, Peregrine filed for bankruptcy, so BMC bought Remedy from the bankrupt Peregrine. In 2002, Remedy had sales of $250 million, with 800 employees, and 6,000 customers; it is a wholly owned subsidiary of BMC. The purchase had legal complications; at one point, BMC believed seven former employees of Peregrine might use their knowledge of trade secrets to develop competitive products; there were lawsuits and counterclaims involving this matter.|$|E
500|$|The {{game was}} {{developed}} on systems including dual-processor Pentium Pro 200s and Athlon 800s with eight and nine gigabyte hard drives, some using SCSI. The team used [...] "more than 100 video cards" [...] throughout development. Deus Ex was built using Visual Studio, Lightwave, and Lotus Notes. They also built a custom dialogue editor, ConEdit. The team used UnrealEd atop the Unreal game engine for map design, which Spector wrote was [...] "superior {{to anything else}} available". Their trust in UnrealScript led them to code [...] "special-cases" [...] for their immediate mission needs instead of more generalized multi-case code. Even as concerned team members expressed misgivings, the team only addressed this later in the project. To Spector, this was a lesson to always prefer [...] "general solutions" [...] over [...] "special casing", such that the <b>tool</b> <b>set</b> works predictably.|$|E

This paper introduced the interface specifications and hardware connecting methods of handwheel NK 100 AB 2, developed control program based on PMAC (Programmable Multi-Axis Controller) and industrial personal computer, finally achieved the function of axes selecting and the feed rate selecting. Based on the traditional edge detector <b>tool</b> <b>setting</b> method, an improved <b>tool</b> <b>setting</b> method is proposed. The inverted micro milling cutter hilt is used to replace the traditional edge detector, which avoids the opposite reamer error caused by the irregular cutter blade shape, finally, <b>tool</b> <b>setting</b> function is achieved through the collecting of electrical signal. The research will provide a useful reference for the {{realization of}} handwheel and <b>tool</b> <b>setting</b> of micro milling machine based on PMAC...|$|R

2500|$|Second Lifes {{status as}} a virtual world, a {{computer}} game, or a talker, is frequently debated. Unlike a traditional computer game, Second Life {{does not have a}} designated objective, nor traditional game play mechanics or rules. It can also be argued that Second Life is a multi-user virtual world, because the virtual world is centered around interaction between multiple users. As it does not have any stipulated goals, it is irrelevant to talk about winning or losing in relation to Second Life. Likewise, unlike a traditional talker, Second Life contains an extensive world that can be explored and interacted with, and it can be used purely as a creative <b>tool</b> <b>set</b> if the user so chooses.

According to Expert Gamer, the player using Guy in Alpha 3 should play defensively, as Guy takes a lot of damage when he is hit, and to rely on Guy's speed and varied attacks. [...] In a guide to , GameSpy stated that [...] "Guy is a frantic fighter. As he is without a fireball and effective zoning tools, he requires very aggressive, close-up fighting where he can land quick combos to chew into the opponent's health. This constantly forward-moving action makes Guy vulernable to counter hits, but he's got enough variety in his <b>tool</b> <b>set</b> to make it work." [...] According to MTV Multiplayer, similar to Ibuki, [...] "Guy requires an expert. His punches and kicks, while dazzling and lengthy, require precision. They also require an eye for patterns and combination opportunities, so stay frosty. Without those things in mind, you'll find Guy to be nothing more than a poor but fast damage dealer." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, archeologists working in Northeast Arkansas for the Arkansas Archeological Survey began {{research}} into causes of Mississippi Valley potters' relatively sudden shift to shell temper. The team conducted {{research at the}} AAS Station Lab at Arkansas State University involving macroscopic, microscopic, petrographic thin-sections, atomic absorption and x-ray diffraction analyses. A member of the team, Michael G. Million, also conducted replicative experiments, perhaps the first to do so with the exact clays, tempers and tools used by prehistoric Mississippian potters. Pastes were created {{using a variety of}} temper-to-clay percentages so that vessels as well as test-tiles could be produced for examination. Test tiles gave information about the shrinkage rates of various clay/temper combinations to the 'green' state and then further information upon firing. Simple, round bottom cooking jars were built using coil construction and the Mississippian pottery <b>tool</b> <b>set</b> including a potteryanvil, wooden paddle, mussel shell scrapers and polishing stones. The research discovered that there were very good reasons for using shell tempering for Mississippi Valley clays. The nature of clays formed by such a large meandering river system are distinctive. The huge annually flooded backswamp areas create a clay which is composed of very minute clay particles (primarily silica) and a high proportion of organic content. This is caused by the slow settling or deposition of the alluvial materials after floods. The clay particles tend to measure just a few micrometres in size and in plate-like form. Large amounts of water can be tightly held in the interspace between the clay particles. Add to this the organic ooze, and one has what is known colloquially as [...] "gumbo" [...] clay.|$|E

40|$|<b>Tool</b> <b>setting</b> {{precision}} is a {{basic requirement}} in ultra-precision diamond machining since it directly affects achievable machining accuracy. Different <b>tool</b> <b>setting</b> methods have evolved and brought to commercial availability. Probably the most accurate ones are based on LVDT, some apply machining of test parts and probably most wide spread are camera based systems. Systems touching the diamond tool cutting edge generally bear the risk of damaging especially fragile tools with high clearance angle. Camera based systems offer limited accuracy because {{of the characteristics of}} the optical systems applied and the need of removing the systems during machining. Applying sub-pixel interpolation methods and calibration after repositioning inside the machine system before every single measurement are two possibilities to cope with limited accuracy. [1] Thus, all of the systems in use imply specific drawbacks. Therefore, the feasibility of a non-contact <b>tool</b> <b>setting</b> system from conventional machining for ultra-precision machining is tested. This includes integration into the machine control, repeatability tests and development of adapted measuring cycles. Modifications of the system to further improve fitting ultra-precision requirements are yet to come. A major focus applying the system was to realize automated <b>tool</b> <b>setting</b> procedure to limit machine operator influence as much as possible...|$|R
