5|$|During the Croatian War of Independence, Mukos {{was part}} of a {{tactical}} group tasked with enforcing a naval blockade of the city of Split. On 14 November 1991, Croatian Navy commandos disabled the vessel with an improvised torpedo, leaving the vessel drifting and abandoned by her crew. <b>The</b> <b>crippled</b> ship was then tugged away by Croatian locals to the nearby island of Šolta. She was subsequently repaired and entered service with the Croatian Navy as Šolta. As of 2014, Šolta remains in service with the Croatian Coast Guard, {{an integral part of the}} navy.|$|E
5|$|Gurnard rose to periscope depth {{two hours}} later and found that a major effort to rescue troops and {{equipment}} from the torpedoed transports was under way. That night, the submarine torpedoed one of <b>the</b> <b>crippled</b> transports which was still afloat. Gurnards attack sank transports Aden Maru (5,825 tons) and Taijima Maru (6,995 tons) {{as well as the}} cargo ship Tenshinzan Marau (6,886 tons). While the rescue effort was relatively successful, 1,290 troops were killed and much of their equipment was lost.|$|E
5|$|In 1797, Emerald was one {{of several}} vessels sent to hunt down and capture <b>the</b> <b>crippled</b> Santisima Trinidad, which had escaped from the British at the Battle of Cape St Vincent. Emerald was {{supposed}} to have been present at the Battle of the Nile but in May 1798 a storm separated her from Horatio Nelson's squadron and she arrived in Aboukir Bay nine days too late. She was part of Rear-Admiral John Thomas Duckworth's squadron during the Action of 7 April 1800 off Cadiz.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Cripple</b> Creek {{strike was}} a major victory for the miners' union.

The WFM flourished in <b>the</b> <b>Cripple</b> Creek area for almost a decade, even helping to elect most county officials (including the new sheriff).|$|R

5|$|Moments {{after the}} two planes collided, the only mayday {{distress}} call radioed by the United Airlines crew was heard at 8:30a.m. plus 20 seconds. <b>The</b> <b>crippled</b> airlinernow missing about eight feet (2.5 m) of its right wingtrailed black smoke and flames as it spiraled earthward, and crashed into a then-empty patch of desert outside the town of Arden {{in what is now}} the unincorporated town of Enterprise. The nearly vertical impact and subsequent explosion instantly killed everyone on board.|$|E
5|$|On the {{afternoon}} of 3 February, about 600 miles northeast of Iceland, U-255 fired a salvo of torpedoes at Convoy RA-52, en route from Murmansk to New York, and hit the 7,460 ton American merchant ship Greylock. The ship attempted to evade the attack, but was holed below the waterline, immediately flooded, and began to list to starboard. Within fifteen minutes the crew of 61 and nine passengers abandoned ship in four lifeboats. A British escort then shelled and sank <b>the</b> <b>crippled</b> ship. U-255 then arrived back at Narvik on 9 February.|$|E
5|$|Only {{two months}} later she took up the role of close escort in the Pedestal convoy to Malta. During the fierce attacks that dogged the convoy, Ledbury claimed three enemy {{aircraft}} destroyed and five damaged, {{and was one of}} three destroyers that helped <b>the</b> <b>crippled</b> oil tanker Ohio into the Grand Harbour. She added to her battle honours with the Allied landings in Sicily, Salerno, and operations in the Adriatic and Aegean. The Royal Navy finally scrapped Ledbury in 1958.|$|E

5|$|After a {{month of}} {{classroom}} instruction in aviation, Shepard was posted to a destroyer, , in August 1944; it was US Navy policy that aviation candidates should first have some service at sea. At the time the destroyer was deployed on active service in the Pacific Ocean. Shepard joined it when it returned to the naval base at Ulithi on October 30. After just two days at sea Cogswell helped rescue 172 sailors from the cruiser , which had been torpedoed by a Japanese submarine, then escorted <b>the</b> <b>crippled</b> ship back to Ulithi. The ship was buffeted by Typhoon Cobra in December 1944, a storm in which three other destroyers went down, and battled kamikazes in the invasion of Lingayen Gulf in January 1945.|$|E
5|$|After {{escaping}} the Machias men, the Margaretta {{was forced to}} jibe into brisk winds, {{which resulted in the}} main boom and gaff breaking away, crippling its navigability. Once Moore was in Holmes Bay he captured a sloop and took its spar and gaff to replace the Margaretta's. Moore also took its pilot, Robert Avery, captive. The Unity crew of about 30 Machias men elected Jeremiah O'Brien as their captain and sailed out to chase down the Margaretta. Since the Unity was a much faster sailing vessel, O'Brien's crew quickly caught up to <b>the</b> <b>crippled</b> Margaretta, while the Falmouth Packet lagged behind.|$|E
5|$|After the 'panic party' {{had taken}} to the boats and the ship {{appeared}} to be sinking, the U-boat approached to within 80 yards of her port quarter, whereupon Sanders ordered the White Ensign hoisted and Prize opened fire. Within {{a few minutes the}} submarine was on fire and her bows rose in the air, whilst Prize was further damaged. The U-boat disappeared from sight, and was believed to have been sunk by the crew of Prize and by several of the German crew (including her captain) who had been blown or jumped into the sea. However, neither of <b>the</b> <b>crippled</b> ships had sunk, with Prize being towed in flames back to Kinsale. U-93 struggled back to the Sylt nine days later.|$|E

5|$|After the fire, the Monterey was {{declared}} unfit for service, and <b>the</b> <b>crippled</b> carrier reached Ulithi on December 21 before continuing across the Pacific to Bremerton, Washington where it underwent repairs. On December 24, 1944, at Ulithi, Ford was {{detached from the}} ship {{and sent to the}} Navy Pre-Flight School at Saint Mary's College of California, where he was assigned to the Athletic Department until April 1945. One of his duties was to coach football. From the end of April 1945 to January 1946, he was {{on the staff of the}} Naval Reserve Training Command, Naval Air Station, Glenview, Illinois, as the Staff Physical and Military Training Officer. On October 3, 1945, he was promoted to lieutenant commander.|$|E
5|$|Again coincidentally {{about this}} same time, the Saratoga strike force arrived and {{attacked}} Ryūjō, hitting and heavily damaging her with {{three to five}} bombs and perhaps one torpedo, and killing 120 of her crew. Also during this time, several U.S. B-17 heavy bombers attacked <b>the</b> <b>crippled</b> Ryūjō but caused no additional damage. The crew abandoned the heavily damaged Japanese carrier at nightfall and she sank soon after. Amatsukaze and Tokitsukaze rescued Ryūjōs survivors and the aircrews from her returning strike force, who ditched their aircraft in the ocean nearby. After the rescue operations were complete, both Japanese destroyers and Tone rejoined Nagumo's main force.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from the}} cordite handling, {{the battle was}} mostly inconclusive, though both the British {{flagship}} Lion and Seydlitz were severely damaged. Lion lost speed, causing her to fall behind {{the rest of the}} battleline, and Beatty was unable to effectively command his ships {{for the remainder of the}} engagement. A British signalling error allowed the German battlecruisers to withdraw, as most of Beatty's squadron mistakenly concentrated on <b>the</b> <b>crippled</b> armoured cruiser Blücher, sinking her with great loss of life. The British blamed their failure to win a decisive victory on their poor gunnery and attempted to increase their rate of fire by stockpiling unprotected cordite charges in their ammunition hoists and barbettes.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Cripple</b> Creek & Victor Gold Mine, {{formerly}} {{and historically}} the Cresson Mine, {{is an active}} gold mine located {{near the town of}} Victor, in <b>the</b> <b>Cripple</b> Creek mining district in the US state of Colorado. It is the largest current producer of gold in Colorado, and produced 211,000 troy ounces of gold in 2014. It was fully owned and operated by AngloGold Ashanti through its subsidiary, <b>the</b> <b>Cripple</b> Creek & Victor Gold Mining Company (CC&V). In June 2015, AngloGold agreed to sell the mine to Newmont Mining Corporation. The purchase by Newmont was completed in August 2015.|$|R

5|$|Despite {{attempts}} to take <b>the</b> <b>crippled</b> Szent István into tow by Tegetthoff, the ship continued to sink and the attempt was abandoned. A {{few minutes after}} 6:00am Szent István sank. Admiral Horthy, commander of the proposed attack, soon canceled the attack because {{he thought that the}} Italians had discovered his plan and ordered the ships to return to Pola. On the contrary, the Italians did not even discover that the Austrian dreadnoughts had departed Pola until later on 10 June when aerial reconnaissance photos revealed that they were no longer there. This was the last military operation that the Viribus Unitis was to take part in and she spent the rest of her career at port in Pola.|$|E
5|$|No. 266 Squadron was {{the last}} unit to trade shots with German formations. During the battles five Bf 109s were destroyed; two from JG 26 and three from JG 3. A further three Bf 109s were 60, 70 and 80 percent damaged. Four German pilots were killed, one wounded, one {{captured}} and one missing. One {{made it back to}} base where <b>the</b> <b>crippled</b> fighter crash-landed. One JG 3 and one JG 26 Bf 109s fell to Spitfires of 266 Squadron. Three fell to Spitfires of No. 54 Squadron. Bomber losses amounted to eight destroyed and ten damaged; including five Do 17s and two Ju 88s destroyed from KG 76 and two KG 1 He 111 lost.|$|E
5|$|On 31 May, Superb, {{now under}} the command of Captain Edmond Hyde Parker, was the {{eleventh}} ship from the head of the battle line after deployment. During the first stage of the general engagement, the ship opened fire with her main guns at 18:26 at <b>the</b> <b>crippled</b> light cruiser , claiming several hits. At 19:17, the ship fired seven salvos at the battlecruiser , but did not make any hits. This was the last time that the ship fired her guns during the battle. She received no damage and fired a total of 54 twelve-inch shells (38 high explosive and 16 common pointed, capped) during the battle.|$|E

5|$|On May 9, 1987, {{improperly}} assembled bearings in Il-62M engine number 2 on LOT Polish Airlines Flight 5055 overheated {{and exploded}} during cruise over {{the village of}} Lipinki, causing the shaft to break in two; this caused the low-pressure turbine disc to spin to enormous speeds and disintegrate, damaging engine number 1 and cutting the control pushers. The crew managed to return to Warsaw, using nothing but trim tabs to control <b>the</b> <b>crippled</b> aircraft, but on the final approach, the trim controlling links burned and the crew completely lost control over the aircraft. Soon after, it crashed {{on the outskirts of}} Warsaw; all 183 on board perished. Had the plane stayed airborne for 40 seconds more, it {{would have been able to}} reach the runway.|$|E
5|$|Shannon and Minotaur {{were also}} present during the {{attempted}} interception of the High Seas Fleet by the Grand Fleet on 19 August although no combat occurred. For {{the rest of}} the war, the ships were assigned to the Northern Patrol. On 11 December 1917, the sisters and four destroyers were assigned to patrol the convoy route between Lerwick and Norway, but the Germans successfully destroyed a convoy off the Norwegian coast on the following day and returned home without being spotted. The British ships were only able to rescue survivors and escort the sole surviving ship from the convoy, <b>the</b> <b>crippled</b> destroyer , back to Scapa Flow.|$|E
5|$|The video then cuts {{to a shot}} of {{the band}} playing the game before {{returning}} to the map screen as 'Docks' or 'Stage 02' flashes. The second level begins {{in much the same way}} as the first with the two characters shooting zombies who appear from the right. The villain again stands in front of the players, laughing before disappearing. A boat/submarine then enters from the right and begins firing bombs at the players who destroy it with laser beams. Another cut scene follows in which <b>the</b> <b>crippled</b> boat returns to a hangar in the sea with 'Evil' written above the entrance. The hangar explodes and disappears before flying out of the water, now with mechanical claws attached, and the video returns again to live action footage of the Super Furries playing the game.|$|E
