5|$|During daytime, the {{angelshark}} usually lies motionless {{on the sea}} floor, {{buried under}} a layer of sediment with only its eyes showing. At night, it becomes more active, and may sometimes be seen swimming above the bottom. Aggregations numbering up <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>hundred</b> have been observed off Gran Canaria in the summer. Known parasites of this species include the tapeworms Grillotia smaris-gora, G. angeli, and Christianella minuta, the fluke Pseudocotyle squatinae, the monogenean Leptocotyle minor, and the isopod Aega rosacea.|$|E
5|$|This system {{continued}} {{the tradition of}} having separate base units for geometrically related dimensions, e.g., mètre for lengths, are (100m2) for areas, stère (1m3) for dry capacities, and litre (1 dm3) for liquid capacities. The hectare, equal <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>hundred</b> ares, the area of a square 100 metres on a side (about 2.47 acres), is still in use. The early metric system included only a few prefixes from milli (one thousandth) to myria (ten thousand).|$|E

5|$|At {{some point}} in the future, IK Pegasi A will consume the {{hydrogen}} fuel at its core and start to evolve away from the main sequence to form a red giant. The envelope of a red giant can grow to significant dimensions, extending up <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>hundred</b> times its previous radius (or larger). Once IK Pegasi A expands to the point where its outer envelope overflows the Roche lobe of its companion, a gaseous accretion disk will form around the white dwarf. This gas, composed primarily of hydrogen and helium, will then accrete onto the surface of the companion. This mass transfer between the stars will also cause their mutual orbit to shrink.|$|E
5|$|Constantinople {{began to}} decline {{continuously}} {{after the end of}} the reign of Basil II in 1025. The final blow was given by the conquest of Villardouin and Enrico Dandolo in 1204 during the Fourth Crusade, where the City was sacked and pillaged. The city subsequently became the center of the Latin Empire, created by Catholic crusaders to replace the Orthodox Byzantine Empire. Hagia Sophia was converted to a Catholic church in 1204. The Byzantine Empire was restored, albeit weakened, in 1261. Constantinople's churches, defenses, and basic services were in disrepair, and its population had dwindled <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>hundred</b> thousand from half a million during the 8th century. After the reconquest of 1261, however some of the city's monuments were restored, and some, like the two Deisis mosaics in Hagia Sofia and Kariye, were created.|$|E
5|$|Furry {{conventions}} {{are usually}} run and staffed by volunteers, though venues may require certain activities to be contracted out. Event funding typically relies on convention registrations. Many {{of the larger}} conventions are incorporated as non-profit organizations, usually to achieve tax-exempt status and safeguard the organizers' personal assets - in the US, some are 501(c)(3) charities, while others are registered as recreational clubs. The largest events may require up <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>hundred</b> volunteers, not including gofers. Volunteers are thanked for their participation during the closing ceremonies, which are usually well-attended, and often receive T-shirts or other benefits.|$|E

5|$|The seeds {{maintain}} their germinative powers for decades, up <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>hundred</b> years, {{according to some}} studies. Because of this, and because the plant is an extremely prolific seed bearer (each plant produces hundreds of capsules, each containing up to 700+ seeds, with a total up to 180,000 or 240,000 seeds), it remains in the soil seed bank for extended periods of time, and can sprout from apparently bare ground, or shortly after forest fires long after previous plants have died. Its population pattern typically consists of an ephemeral adult population followed by {{a long period of}} dormancy as seeds. Great mullein rarely establishes on new grounds without human intervention because its seeds do not disperse very far. Seed dispersion requires the stem to be moved by wind or animal movement; 75% of the seeds fall within 1 m of the parent plant, and 93% fall within 5 m.|$|E
5|$|The warfare {{with the}} Prussians relied on guerilla raids {{in the border}} regions. Small groups of men, a dozen <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>hundred,</b> made quick raids on farms, villages, border posts, etc. This was a {{positional}} warfare where neither side could defeat the other, but the Teutonic Knights relied on future reinforcements from Germany and Europe, while Prussians were draining their local resources. After the massacre of surrendered Teutonic soldiers in the Battle of Krücken in 1249, the Knights refused {{to negotiate with the}} Prussians. The Prussians were also unable to coordinate their efforts and develop a common strategy: while each clan had its own leader, {{there was no one to}} lead all the clans. The Natangians had to watch for attacks from Balga, Brandenburg, Wehlau, and Königsberg while the Warmians were threatened by garrisons at Christburg and Elbing. This way only Diwane and his Bartians were able to continue the war in the west. They made several minor expeditions to Culmerland each year.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the two new cups, {{it is also possible}} to create custom cups. The disk can save up <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>hundred</b> tracks and up to three ghost racers per course. IGN singled out the track creator as the F-Zero X Expansion Kits strongest feature since it is virtually the same tool the designers of F-Zero X used for themselves to create the original circuits. The Car Editor offers a variety of options when creating a vehicle. Using a set of pre-existing parts, the player must balance their creations' settings and performance abilities before the machine is finished and named. The Track Editor is a detailed track creator that allows the player to design their own racing circuits. Using a cursor, the player can determine the basic layout of the track and also add points to it to create track elements such as curves and hills. Furthermore, numerous different properties like half pipes and cylinders, as well as numerous road surfaces, such as slip zones, can be added. The player can test the creation at any time and run practice laps.|$|E

5|$|In the lower, broader {{part of the}} estuary near Avonmouth, {{the tidal}} surge {{advances}} as a slight roll in the deepwater channels and the water rapidly spreads across the sands and mudbanks. Past Sharpness, the bore begins to form and when it encounters the large left-handed bend at Hock Cliff, it crashes headlong into the rocks. Reforming, it runs up-river close to the Overton shore before crossing the estuary towards Box Cliff. As it rounds the Horseshoe Bend it keeps to the outside but it afterwards moves across to {{the eastern side of}} the river. Above Langney Sands, the river abruptly narrows <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>hundred</b> yards, the sands diminish and the channel occupies the whole of the river. Now the bore is recognisably the spectacular phenomenon that people expect rather than a swelling flood of water. From Minsterworth to Gloucester, the width of the river varies little and the bore continues unhindered, climbing the banks on the outer side of bends and breaking over shallow places. At Lower Parting, close to Gloucester, it splits in two to pass either side of Alney Island. Both branches encounter and overcome weirs and rejoin at Upper Parting, and the much diminished bore continues upstream. In particularly high tides the water may overtop the weir at Tewkesbury, and even the foot of the weir at Worcester may experience a rise in water level of a foot or so.|$|E
5|$|When {{it became}} clear that other monarchs were not going to acquiesce to a de facto {{partition}} of Bavaria, Joseph and his foreign minister, Anton von Kaunitz, scoured the Habsburg realm for troops and concentrated six hundred guns and a 180,000–190,000-man Austrian army in Bohemia, Moravia, and Austrian Silesia. This amounted to most of Austria's two hundred thousand effectives, leaving much of the Habsburg border regions with the Ottoman Empire under-guarded. On 6 April 1778, Frederick of Prussia established his army of eighty thousand men on the Prussian border with Bohemia, near Neisse, Schweidnitz, and the County of Glatz, which Frederick had acquired from the Wittelsbach contender in 1741 in exchange for his electoral support of Charles VII. At Glatz, Frederick completed his preparations for invasion: he gathered supplies, arranged a line of march, brought up his artillery and drilled his soldiers. His younger brother, Prince Henry, formed a second army of seventy-five <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>hundred</b> thousand men to the north and west, in Saxony. In April, Frederick and Joseph officially joined their armies in the field, and diplomatic negotiations ended.|$|E
