25|$|By now, {{the writing}} {{was on the}} wall. PC-552 marked time until the {{government}} decided {{what to do with}} it. Sailors left the ship as they were honorably discharged and not replaced. When the ship made its final voyage, it was under-crewed by a third. The ship was decommissioned 18 April 1946. As of 2015, the final fate of the ship has not been determined. There was a huge push to convert the U.S. economy from a war basis to a peace <b>time</b> <b>basis.</b> People were flush with money but could not buy anything and people wanted houses and cars. Many patrol craft were immediately scrapped and the steel entered the peace time economy.|$|E
25|$|The third {{match of}} the night was a clash between the Los Villanos brothers, Villano III, Villano IV, and Villano V and several wrestlers from the La Lagunero area of Mexico, the trio of Dr. Wagner Jr., Blue Panther, and Black Warrior who had {{developed}} a rivalry with the brothers {{over the last several}} months and who would have repeated clashes over the years following the 2000 Sin Piedad show. The fifth match {{of the night}} would see the team of Los Guerreros del Infierno ("The Infernal Warriors"; Rey Bucanero and Último Guerrero) defend their CMLL World Tag Team Championship against the team of El Hijo del Santo and Negro Casas. Hijo del Santo and Negro Casas were the previous holders of the championship, but were forced to vacate the title when Hijo del Santo stopped working for CMLL on a full <b>time</b> <b>basis</b> in mid-2000. Los Guerreros del Infierno had won a tournament for the vacant titles only a month earlier when the two defeated Mr. Niebla and Villano IV at CMLL's Entre Torre Infernal show. Hijo del Santo returned to CMLL during the tournament, immediately challenging the new champions for a title match since they never defeated the duo of Hijo del Santo and Negro Casas for the championship.|$|E

2500|$|There {{have been}} a number of {{initiatives}} involving [...] "real time" [...] adherence monitoring. What [...] "real time" [...] means is debatable. A [...] "talking pill" [...] or one which can communicate its status on an ongoing real <b>time</b> <b>basis</b> is not feasible. In all cases, the medication taking event is represented in a system by proxy. For instance, the time a trace was broken on a package when a dose cavity was accessed. In this case there is no proof that the medication was a) removed or b) ingested. Proof of ingestion and the time staying of it is in and by itself a difficult task to accomplish. While sounding most useful and technically feasible, it has not been meeting with much success to-date. Even the most cutting-edge ingestion based product, Proteus' Helio, requires the ingestion of a non-active second dose enabled with a transmitting function. Again, it doesn't prove ingestion of the active dose at all. It is debatable how much acceptance this type of ingested sensor will have with the general public. At the moment, a prescription is required just to receive a sensor system.|$|E

5000|$|Zgrass {{included}} three priorities (called levels) that allowed macros {{to be run}} normally, or in [...] "foreground" [...] or [...] "background" [...] levels. This added a simple form of multitasking which was tremendously useful in an animation-oriented language. Game authors could place joystick-reading routines in a macro set {{to run in the}} background, and then the joystick would be read automatically whenever the current drawing macro completed. Functions placed in the foreground ran before either, and was often used for timers and other [...] "low latency" [...] needs. Zgrass included a [...] function that would call macros on a <b>timed</b> <b>basis,</b> making the implementation of timers very easy.|$|R
