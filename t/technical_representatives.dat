500|$|Paul Stoddart, then {{owner of}} Minardi, a team using Bridgestone tyres, {{published}} an account on Wednesday, June 22, {{of the events}} leading up to the race. Stoddart recorded a meeting around 10:00am {{on the day of the}} race, to which Speedway president Tony George, [...] "the two most senior Michelin representatives present at the circuit", Bernie Ecclestone (president and CEO of Formula One Management and Formula One Administration), the team principals, and the teams' Michelin <b>technical</b> <b>representatives</b> were summoned. All invited were present except Jean Todt, Team Principal of Scuderia Ferrari.|$|E
500|$|By Stoddart's account, {{the meeting}} {{proceeded}} as follows: The Michelin representatives stated their {{position that the}} tyres provided to the teams could not safely complete the race distance, and requested that the Bridgestone teams, represented by Stoddart and Jordan's Colin Kolles, permit the installation of a chicane in Turn 13. Those present discussed and agreed to reject the FIA's solution of speed-limiting the Michelin cars in the turn {{because of the potential}} for accidents. They likewise dismissed the possibility of making pit stops every ten laps, resolved that a chicane was the best solution, and instructed several <b>technical</b> <b>representatives</b> [...] to prepare plans for its installation. Bernie Ecclestone volunteered to consult Todt, who had not come to the meeting, {{and the president of the}} FIA, Max Mosley, who was not present at the race, and reconvene the meeting when he had responses.|$|E
2500|$|The {{second stage}} {{was the last}} inspection. Here the plane was flight tested and then turned over to its crew. [...] The engines were run up, the plane taxied and then flown by {{military}} crews to check instruments, radios and single engine operation. The planes were flown north from Baer to Kendallville, Indiana, and back to Baer. This was about 80 miles round trip. Around Kendallville one engine was shut down {{to see how the}} aircraft handled. The military flew the planes during the test flight, but often the pilot would be accompanied by a civilian test pilot. When the flight turned up additional problems they were corrected by the Flight Test section. [...] There were Pratt and Whitney <b>technical</b> <b>representatives</b> on the field for the engines, as well as other factory representatives from Douglas and Curtiss-Wright for the airframes.|$|E

2500|$|A major {{topic of}} {{discussion}} {{was the type of}} technician(s) needed. As the hardware became more and more complex, the maintenance technicians needed broad as well as in-depth knowledge. Navy technicians would also be required to make rapid repairs on combat-critical equipment in locations where assistance from the outside – such as <b>technical</b> <b>representatives</b> of industries – would not be available. [...] Modular design, where a failure might be corrected by changing out a module, was not yet in use; thus, maintenance required detailed circuit tracing and knowledge of the circuit theory. It was agreed that the ideal situation would be to recruit persons with an electrical engineering (EE) or similar education and put them through the existing five-month advanced segment of the RMS to learn Navy hardware. This approach, however, was not practical; persons with this background were not only very limited in number but also in high demand by industry and the military.|$|E
2500|$|... "A {{project team}} from the Air Force Operational Test Center left Eglin Air Force Base Sunday [...] for Eielson Air Force Base, Alaska to conduct the Arctic Testing Phase of the testing of the North American F-100C 'Super Sabre'. Major John J. Innis, project officer, and Captain Roscoe B. Tanner, {{assistant}} project officer, both of AFOTC's 3243rd Test Group (Fighter) flew the two aircraft to Alaska. A maintenance crew of 17 men from the 3243 Test Squadron (Electronics Maintenance) is accompanying the project to Eielson. Oscar F. Niedermann and Hugh Curtis, <b>technical</b> <b>representatives</b> from North American Aviation and Continental Aircraft Corporations {{are also part of}} the teams. During the Arctic test phase, which is expected to last from six weeks to three months, the project team will evaluate the operational suitability of the 'Super Sabre' in sub-zero temperatures. In an effort to determine maintenance problems peculiar to this climate, the ground crews will change the engine in one of the aircraft at 30 degrees below zero. [...] The project will be supported by two transport aircraft, a Douglas C-124 'Globemaster' and a Fairchild C-123B 'Avitruck'. The C-123B , which recently was given operational suitability testing at AFOTC, will also undergo Arctic phase testing while at Eielson. The two F-100Cs, will be integrated into the Alaskan Air Defense system during the duration of the test." ...|$|E

However, DCASR {{quality assurance}} personnel would know the assigned NASA <b>technical</b> <b>representative</b> and should contact him when problems arise. The <b>technical</b> <b>representative</b> is the expert on the hardware and should be consulted on any problem area. It is important that the DCASR quality assurance personnel recommend to the delegating NASA Center any new or improved methods of which they may be aware which would assist in achieving the desired quality and reliability in NASA hardware. NASA expects assignment of competent personnel in the Quality Assurance functional area and is not only buying the individual's technical skill, but also his experience.
