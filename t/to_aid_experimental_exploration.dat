40|$|Approximately {{half of all}} {{pharmaceutical}} {{drugs are}} marketed as salts. This thesis pioneers the application of computational crystal structure prediction to organic salts containing the commonly used chloride or carboxylate counterions, and assesses {{the extent to which}} the theoretical calculations can be used <b>to</b> <b>aid</b> <b>experimental</b> efforts targeting organic salts. A screen for multi-component solid forms of pyridine and 4 - dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) using a range of dicarboxylic acids led to one novel cocrystal of pyridine and six novel salts of DMAP. All novel crystal structures were solved using single crystal X-ray diffraction. At a simplistic level, salts differ from cocrystals in the position of the acidic proton within the crystal. For a selected set of structures, periodic ab initio calculations were shown to be useful in suggesting the observed N+-H (salt) or O-H (cocrystal) covalent bond as the preferred atomic connectivity. Modelling the same crystal structures by lattice energy minimisation using a distributed multipole based electrostatic model proved successful if the correct proton connectivity was used. The observed structures of a model salt, cocrystal and disordered salt-cocrystal system were found to be the most stable or almost equienergetic with the most stable structure in the predicted crystal energy landscapes. When the predictions were repeated using molecular structures with the wrong proton connectivity, the energetic ranking of the structure got worse. The computational model of crystal structure prediction was successfully used to rationalise the different polymorphic and hydration behaviour of the pharmacologically active amantadine hydrochloride and memantine hydrochloride salts. Finally, a similar methodology was applied to 1, 8 -naphthyridinium fumarate and the calculations performed as part of the fifth international blind test of crystal structure prediction. Overall, the success in modelling the crystal structures of carboxylate and chloride salts illustrates the promise of crystal structure prediction in <b>aiding</b> <b>experimental</b> efforts of organic salt selection...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Gene {{expression}} {{patterns of}} olfactory receptors (ORs) {{are an important}} component of the signal encoding mechanism in the olfactory system since they determine the interactions between odorant ligands and sensory neurons. We have developed the Olfactory Receptor Microarray Database (ORMD) to house OR gene expression data. ORMD is integrated with the Olfactory Receptor Database (ORDB), which is a key repository of OR gene information. Both databases aim <b>to</b> <b>aid</b> <b>experimental</b> research related <b>to</b> olfaction. Description ORMD is a Web-accessible database that provides a secure data repository for OR microarray experiments. It contains both publicly available and private data; accessing the latter requires authenticated login. The ORMD is designed to allow users to not only deposit gene expression data but also manage their projects/experiments. For example, contributors can choose whether to make their datasets public. For each experiment, users can download the raw data files and view and export the gene expression data. For each OR gene being probed in a microarray experiment, a hyperlink to that gene in ORDB provides access to genomic and proteomic information related to the corresponding olfactory receptor. Individual ORs archived in ORDB are also linked to ORMD, allowing users access to the related microarray gene expression data. Conclusion ORMD serves as a data repository and project management system. It facilitates the study of microarray experiments of gene expression in the olfactory system. In conjunction with ORDB, ORMD integrates gene expression data with the genomic and functional data of ORs, and is thus a useful resource for both olfactory researchers and the public. </p...|$|R

However, its utility depends on many assumptions. <b>To</b> <b>aid</b> <b>experimental</b> planning and design, we quantify how the precision with which cosmological parameters can be measured depends on a broad range of assumptions. We cover assumptions related to modeling of the ionization power spectrum and associated nonlinearity, experimental specifications like array layout and noise, cosmological assumptions about reionization history and inter-galactic medium (IGM) evolution, and assumptions about astrophysical foregrounds. We derive simple analytic approximations for how various assumptions affect the results, and find that ionization power modeling is most important, followed by array layout (crudely, the more compact, the better). We also present an accurate yet robust method for measuring cosmological parameters in practice, separating the physics from the astrophysics by exploiting both gravitationally induced clustering anisotropy {{and the fact that the}} ionization power spectra are rather smooth functions that can be accurately fit by 7 phenomenological parameters. For example, a future square kilometer array optimized for 21 cm tomography could improve the sensitivity of the Planck CMB satellite to spatial curvature and neutrino masses by up to two orders of magnitude, to Delta-Omega_k ~ 0. 0002 and Delta m_nu ~ 0. 007 eV, and give a 4 sigma detection of the spectral index running predicted by the simpliest inflation models.

40|$|Accelerating {{progress}} in the discovery and deployment of advanced nanoporous materials relies on chemical insight and structure–property relationships for rational design. Because {{of the complexity of}} this problem, trial-and-error is heavily involved in the laboratory today. A cost-effective route <b>to</b> <b>aid</b> <b>experimental</b> materials discovery is to construct structure models of nanoporous materials in silico and use molecular simulations to rapidly test them and elucidate data-driven guidelines for rational design. For example, highly tunable nanoporous materials have shown promise as adsorbents for separating an industrially relevant gaseous mixture of xenon and krypton. In this work, we characterize, screen, and analyze the Nanoporous Materials Genome, a database of about 670 000 porous material structures, for candidate adsorbents for xenon/krypton separations. For over half a million structures, the computational resources required for a brute-force screening using grand-canonical Monte Carlo simulations of Xe/Kr adsorption are prohibitive. To overcome the computational cost, we used a hybrid approach combining machine learning algorithms (random forests) with molecular simulations. We compared the results from our large-scale screening with simple pore models to rationalize the strong link between pore size and selectivity. With this insight, we then analyzed the anatomy of the binding sites of the most selective materials. These binding sites can be constructed from tubes, pockets, rings, or cages and are often composed of nondiscrete chemical fragments. The complexity of these binding sites emphasizes the importance of high-throughput computational screenings to identify optimal materials for a given application. Interestingly, our screening study predicts that the two most selective materials in the database are an aluminophosphate zeolite analogue and a calcium based coordination network, both of which have already been synthesized but not yet tested for Xe/Kr separations...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is concerned}} with the application of mathematical modeling and statistical signal processing into the rapidly expanding fields of proteomics and genomics. The research is guided by a translational goal which drives the problem formalization and experimental design, and leads to optimization, prediction and control of the underlying system. The dissertation is comprised of three interconnected subjects. In {{the first part of the}} dissertation, two Bayesian peptide detection algorithms are proposed to optimize the feature extraction step, which is the most fundamental step in mass spectrometry-based proteomics. The algorithms are designed to tackle data processing challenges that are not satisfactorily addressed by existing methods. In contrast to most existing methods, the proposed algorithms perform deisotoping and deconvolution of mass spectra simultaneously, which enables better identification of weak peptide signals. Unlike greedy template-matching algorithms, the proposed methods have the capability to handle complex spectra where features overlap. The proposed methods achieve better sensitivity and accuracy compared to many popular software packages such as msInspect. In the second part of the dissertation, we consider modeling and assessing the entire mass spectrometry-based proteomic data analysis pipeline. Different modules are identified and analyzed, resulting in a framework that captures key factors in system performance. The effects of various model parameters on protein identification rates and quantification errors, differential expression results, and classification performance are examined. The proposed pipeline model can be used <b>to</b> <b>aid</b> <b>experimental</b> design, pinpoint critical bottlenecks, optimize the work flow, and predict biomarker discovery results. Finally, the same system methodology is extended to analyze the work flow in DNA microarray experiments. A model-based approach is developed to explore the relationship among microarray data properties, missing value imputation, and sample classification in a complicated data analysis pipeline. The situations when it is suitable to apply missing value imputation are identified and recommendations regarding imputation are provided.

Investigations into the structure and electronic configuration of transition metal complexes allow for tuning of desired species by modifications to the ligands and/or metals to achieve more efficient thermodynamics and kinetics for the process of interest.

These reactions have utility in the synthesis of nitrogen and phosphorus containing molecules, respectively, and the results presented provide mechanistic insight into the synthesis of the organometallic intermediates. Additionally, a computational approach towards rational catalyst design was performed on the ruthenium based hydroarylation catalyst TpRu(CO) (Ph) [Tp = hydrido-tris(pyrazolyl) borate].

Using these engineered c-Kit mice, {{we were able to}} obtain high levels of conditional MLI transduction in adult mice using Cre-dependent viral vectors without any PC or granule cell labeling. We then used the mouse line to target MLIs for activity perturbation in vitro using opto- and chemogenetics...|$|R

Understanding {{the complex}} {{interactions}} between gametes, embryos and the maternal tract is required knowledge for combating infertility and developing newmethods of contraception. Here we present somemain aspects of spermatozoa {{interactions with the}} mammalian oviduct before fertilisation and discuss how computational modelling {{can be used as}} an invaluable <b>aid</b> <b>to</b> <b>experimental</b> investigation in this field. A complete predictive computational model of gamete and embryo interactions with the female reproductive tract is a long way off. However, the enormity of this task should not discourage us from working towards it. Computational modelling allows us to investigate aspects of maternal communication with gametes and embryos, which are financially, ethically or practically difficult to look at experimen-tally. In silicomodels of maternal communication with gametes and embryos can be used as tools to complement in vivo experiments, {{in the same way as}} in vitro and in situ models...|$|R
40|$|Part 1 : Artificial Intelligence Techniques in Bio MedicineInternational audienceAccurately {{detecting}} {{psychological stress}} in {{time is a}} significant issue in the modern stressful society, especially for adolescents who are not mature enough to cope with pressure well. Micro-blog offers a new channel for teens’ stress detection, since more and more teenagers nowadays prefer to express themselves on the lively virtual social networks. Previous work mainly rely on tweeting contents to detect tweeters’ psychological stress. However, a tweet is limited to 140 characters, which are too short to provide enough information to accurately figure out its tweeter’s stress. To overcome the limitation, this paper proposes to leverage details of social interactions between tweeters and their following friends (i. e., time-sensitive comment/response actions under a tweet) <b>to</b> <b>aid</b> stress detection. <b>Experimental</b> results through a real user study show that time sensitivity of comment/response acts {{plays a significant role}} in stress detection, and involving such interaction acts can improve the detection performance by 23. 5 % in F-measure over that without such interactions...|$|R
40|$|Abstract 1 Retransmission-based error {{recovery}} has been, in general, considered inappropriate for continuous media (CM) applications, {{because of its}} latency. However, retransmission is still attractive because it requires minimal network bandwidth, (less than either peak-bandwidth allocation or FEC for bursty streams) and processing cost. Despite its latency, we believe that retransmission can be used successfully in many cases, especially if playout buffering is employed. We have designed and implemented a retransmissionbased error control scheme for CM applications, which aims {{to provide the best}} possible reliability at a minimal cost, without violating the application’s timing constraints. We have enhanced selective-repeat retransmission with: (1) playout buffering to increase the time available for recovery, (2) gap-based rather than timer-based loss detection to minimize loss detection latency, (3) implicit expiration of sender retransmission buffers to eliminate acknowledgments, (4) conditional retransmission requests to avoid triggering late, unnecessary retransmissions, and (5) data integrity information delivery to the application <b>to</b> <b>aid</b> in concealment. <b>Experimental</b> results show that the mechanism significantly reduces observed loss without violating the application’s delay constraints. 1...|$|R
