5|$|After 170 {{minutes of}} slow batting, Edrich gloved a rising Lindwall {{delivery}} and was caught behind by wicket-keeper Don Tallon. At 119/5, Compton {{returned to the}} field, his head wound having been stitched <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>the</b> <b>bleeding.</b> He and Yardley played carefully until the tea break, and only the England captain offered a chance; Barnes was unable to complete the reflex catch at short leg from the bowling of Toshack. After the resumption of play, Yardley on-drove Lindwall for a four, but lofted Ernie Toshack, who had been bowling leg theory, into the packed on-side where he was caught by Johnson at forward square leg. Toshack's defensive bowling had caused the English skipper to lose patience and his departure for 22 left the score on 141/6.|$|E
5|$|The {{change in}} England's opening pair {{did not result}} in an {{improvement}} on the scoreboard. A run out was narrowly avoided from the first ball, and Washbrook and Emmett appeared to be uncomfortable on a surface that offered early assistance to the bowlers. With 22 runs on the board, Johnston bowled Washbrook with a yorker, and six runs later, Emmett fended a rising ball from Lindwall to Barnes at short leg, leaving England 28/2. Edrich eschewed attacking strokeplay as he and Compton attempted to establish themselves. Lindwall bowled a series of short balls. One hit Compton on the arm and the batsman attempted to hook another bouncer, but edged it into his face. This forced Compton to leave the field with a bloodied eyebrow with the score at 33/2. Edrich and Crapp then engaged in grim defensive batting, resulting in one 25-minute period where only one run was added. They reached lunch at 57/2. Upon the resumption, Crapp began to accelerate, hitting a six and three boundaries from Johnson. Australia took the new ball and Lindwall trapped Crapp lbw for 37. Dollery took a single to get off the mark but then missed a yorker from Johnston and was bowled. England had lost two wickets for one run to be 97/4. After 170 minutes of slow batting, Edrich gloved a rising Lindwall delivery and was caught behind. At 119/5, Compton returned to the field, his wound having been stitched <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>the</b> <b>bleeding.</b> Yardley fell to Toshack for 22 with the score at 141/6, bringing Evans to the crease. Compton combined with the gloveman to add 75 runs for the seventh wicket in 70 minutes, before Lindwall removed Evans to leave England 216/7.|$|E

25|$|Willard {{had been}} in poor health for some years, and it began to {{deteriorate}} quickly in 1860. That year the Democratic Party was struggling with internal problems, and the nation {{was on the brink}} of Civil War. Willard attended the state Democratic convention in Columbus, his last political appearance in the state. His party was so wracked with problems, it was proposed by a party member that the crowd give three cheers for the Republican candidates, who they believed would save the Union. Willard quickly ascended to the podium and rebuked the crowd and begged for unity. His speech was so forceful, he quickly became more ill than ever. His lungs began hemorrhaging, but his doctors were able <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>the</b> <b>bleeding.</b> Shortly after, Willard traveled to St. Paul, Minnesota on a tour to promote goodwill among the states. Willard died from internal bleeding while giving a speech there on October 4, 1860. He was the first Governor of Indiana to die in office. He was laid in state in Indianapolis and his bier was attended by thousands, a buried in New Albany.|$|E
25|$|On June 13, 2009, Calderón {{defended the}} {{championship}} against Rodel Mayol. During the first stage, both pugilists {{fought in the}} middle of the ring, while he focused on attacking the body while the challenger employed jabs. During the second and third rounds, Mayol pressured the offensive, managing to land a moderate amount of punches. In the fourth round, Calderón began pursuing the offensive, while avoiding Mayol’s punches. This continued in the following chapter, but a head clash opened another laceration on his forehead, he continued the contest, but was more aggressive from this point onwards. Calderón’s corner tried <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>the</b> <b>bleeding,</b> but the referee suspended the contest during the sixth round after these attempts proven unsuccessful. The fight was declared a technical draw, with both fighters receiving a 58-56 card while the third judge scored in 57-57. An immediate rematch was scheduled three months later. Calderón began this contest by effectively avoiding Mayol’s constant attack, while throwing limited punches. This pattern continued during the following three rounds. In the fifth, Mayol connected his best punch of the fight, winning the round. To retaliate, Calderón became more aggressive, throwing more combinations. The seventh round began with exchanges from both boxers, but a head clash opens another laceration that stops the fight. The contest was declared a technical decision, with the judges offering scores of 68-65 twice for Calderón and 68-65 for Mayol.|$|E
500|$|Initially police {{believed}} that the murder was a drive-by shooting, but investigators discovered a tennis shoe print near the outdoor air conditioning unit, and a yellow business card next to Fischer's body. Though the business card was stained by blood from Corinne's hands after she tried <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>the</b> <b>bleeding,</b> investigators were able to decipher the wording on the card. It was from the Collin County bail office in McKinney, Texas. A [...] phone number was printed on the card {{and it had a}} handwritten area code, 214, from the Dallas area. Alex Perez, the former sheriff of Cameron County, who was appointed to lead the investigation, called the bail office and asked them to fax copies of bond applications made by Rio Grande Valley residents. The police theorized that the assailant had dropped the card after Fischer tried to defend himself. The bail office faxed the police several applications, and included one from Rudy Cuellar, a Dallas resident who often visited Mexico.|$|E

In the fifth round Margarito connected several strong punches to his head and body. Throughout the course of the fight both boxers fought at close quarters which led to their heads hitting against each other several times. Margarito's face began bleeding in the sixth round which led to the referee stopping the fight twice in this round. Attempts by Francisco Ezpinoza, Margarito's cutman, [...] <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>the</b> <b>bleeding</b> were unsuccessful. In the late rounds Santos began boxing and focused some of his punches in Margarito's wound.

500|$|After a {{month of}} training, Hayes and the 23rd Ohio set out for western Virginia in July 1861 {{as a part of}} the Kanawha Division. They passed the next few months out of contact with the enemy until September, when the {{regiment}} encountered Confederates at Carnifex Ferry in present-day West Virginia and drove them back. In November, Hayes was promoted to lieutenant colonel (Matthews having been promoted to colonel of another regiment) and led his troops deeper into western Virginia, where they entered winter quarters. The division resumed its advance the following spring, and Hayes led several raids against the rebel forces, on one of which he sustained a minor injury to his knee. That September, Hayes's regiment was called east to reinforce General John Pope's Army of Virginia at the Second Battle of Bull Run. Although Hayes and his troops did not arrive in time for the battle, they joined the Army of the Potomac as it hurried north to cut off Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia, which was advancing into Maryland. Marching north, the 23rd was the lead regiment encountering the Confederates at the Battle of South Mountain on September 14. Hayes led a charge against an entrenched position and was shot through his left arm, fracturing the bone. He had one of his men tie a handkerchief above the wound in an effort <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>the</b> <b>bleeding,</b> and continued to lead his men in the battle.

Lexie promises to keep George's secret that he is repeating his internship after failing his intern exam and the pair strike up a friendship. Lexie is assigned to be Cristina Yang's (Sandra Oh) intern, and is dubbed [...] "three" [...] by Cristina, who doesn't {{take the time to}} learn her name. Lexie is eager to get to know her half-sister Meredith, but receives a hostile response when she introduces herself, and her later frequent attempts to bond with Meredith are similarly rebuffed. Lexie begins a brief sexual relationship with Alex Karev (Justin Chambers), who discovers that Thatcher has descended into alcoholism following Susan's death. When Meredith scolds Lexie for not looking after Thatcher, she finally retaliates and decides to stop pursuing a relationship with Meredith. Lexie bonds with patient Nick Hanscom (Seth Green), and is present when his exposed artery blows, causing him to suffer massive blood loss. She manages <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>the</b> <b>bleeding,</b> but is distraught when Nick later dies anyway. Feeling sympathy for Lexie, Cristina invites her to join her and Meredith in drinking and dancing, causing the sisters relationship to begin to thaw.

Because of the sharpness and thinness of the file the wound was very narrow and, due to pressure from Elisabeth's extremely tight corseting, the hemorrhage of blood into the pericardial sac around the heart was slowed to mere drops. Until this sac filled, the beating of her heart was not impeded, which is why Elisabeth had been able to walk from the site of the assault and up the boat’s boarding ramp.

40|$|The {{indications}} for {{and type}} {{and amount of}} fluid resuscitation for trauma patients in the field remains highly controversial. There is unanimity, however, that trauma victims may suffer from acute blood loss. In addition <b>to</b> <b>stopping</b> <b>the</b> <b>bleeding</b> fluid resuscitation is the second mainstay in shock therapy. The insertion of 1 or 2 large-bore i. v. lines is indicated for manifest or threatening shock. Patients without signs of bleeding or hemorrhagic shock do not require fluid replacement therapy. Blood losses from bleeding that has ceased or has been stopped by compression or self-tamponade should be substituted. In uncontrolled bleeding from intraabdominal, pelvic or other internal sources immediate transport to a trauma center is required. In such situations many experts favour a goal-oriented approach of permissive hypotension aiming at a systolic blood pressure of 70 - 90 mmHg. In patients with severe traumatic brain injury a goal-oriented fluid resuscitation (mean arterial blood pressure of 90 mmHg) is presently recommended. Additional doses of catecholamines may be needed. Crystalloids are the recommended choice of fluid. In {{the presence of a}} suspected blood loss of more than 2 L the additional administration of colloids is suggested.

2500|$|Regarding Traditional Chinese herbal therapy, only few trials {{exist that}} are {{considered}} to be of adequate methodology by modern western medical researchers, and its effectiveness therefore is considered poorly documented. [...] A 2016 Cochrane review found [...] "insufficient evidence that Chinese Herbal Medicines were any more or less effective than placebo or Hormonal Therapy" [...] for the relief of menopause related symptoms. A 2012 Cochrane review found no difference in decreased mortality when Chinese herbs were used alongside Western medicine versus Western medicine exclusively. A 2010 Cochrane review found there is not enough robust evidence to support the effectiveness of traditional Chinese medicine herbs <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>the</b> <b>bleeding</b> from haemorrhoids.

A 2012 Cochrane review found weak evidence suggesting that some Chinese medicinal herbs have a similar effect at preventing and treating influenza when compared to antiviral medication. Due to the poor quality of these medical studies, it is concluded that there is not enough evidence to support or dismiss the use of Chinese medicinal herbs for the treatment of influenza. There is a need for larger and higher quality randomized clinical trials to determine how effective Chinese herbal medicine is for treating people with influenza. A 2005 Cochrane review found that although the evidence was weak for the use of any single herb, there was low quality evidence that some Chinese medicinal herbs may be effective for the treatment of acute pancreatitis.|$|E
2500|$|Another common injury faced {{was those}} caused by blades. [...] If the wound was too advance for simple stitch and bandage, it would often result in {{amputation}} of the limb.

[...] Typically {{it would have taken}} less than a minute for a surgeon to remove the damaged limb, and another three to four minutes <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>the</b> <b>bleeding.</b> [...] The surgeon would first place the limb on a block of wood and tie ligatures above and below the site of surgery. [...] Then the soft tissue would be cut through, thus exposing the bone, which was then sawed through. [...] The stump was then bandaged and left to heal. [...] The rates of mortality among amputation patients was around 39%, that number grew to roughly 62% for those patients with a high leg amputation. [...] Ideas of medieval surgery are often construed in our modern mind as barbaric, as our view is diluted with our own medical knowledge. [...] Surgery and medical practice in general was at its height of advancement for its time. [...] All procedures were done with the intent to save lives, not to cause extra pain and suffering. [...] The speed of the procedure by the surgeon was an important factor, as the limit of pain and blood loss lead to higher survival rates among these procedures. [...] Injuries to major arteries that caused mass blood loss were not usually treatable as shown in the evidence of archeological remains. [...] We know this as wounds severe enough to sever major arteries left incisions on the bone which is excavated by archaeologists. [...] Wounds were also taught to be covered to improve healing. [...] Forms of antiseptics were also used in order to stave off infection. [...] To dress wounds all sorts of dressing were used such as grease, absorbent dressings, spider webs, honey, ground shellfish, clay and turpentine.

The most common complication is bleeding from tonsillectomies. Despite being the most feared complication, only a minority of patients need surgical intervention <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>the</b> <b>bleed.</b> Objective: <b>To</b> evaluate the surgical profile in hospital pediatric otolaryngology Curitiba. Method: Retrospective Study of registered surgeries. Results: A total 2020 procedures performed in the operating room in 2009, 9. 26 % (187) and tests were 90. 74 % (1833) surgeries, being 65. 14 % (1316) performed by the SUS,% 32. 47 (656) by covenant and 2. 39 % (48) individuals. The gender distribution was 1106 boys and 914 girls. Adenoidectomy with or without tonsillectomy corresponded to 62. 5 % (1146). Of these, only 0. 96 % (11) underwent revision surgery center. In second place comes the otological surgery, with results of tympanostomy, with or without ventilation tube, the most prevalent. Conclusion: The otolaryngologists are able to perform various types of ENT surgical. A procedure most frequently performed in pediatric hospital in Little Prince is adenotonsillectomy, with revision rate similar to that reported in the literature. Boys are more subjected to procedures than girls. Most ENT procedures performed in this hospital in 2009 were performed by the SUS.
