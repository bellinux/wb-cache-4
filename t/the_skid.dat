25|$|In July 2004, on the Crown Majesta, Toyota {{offered a}} Vehicle Dynamics Integrated Management (VDIM) system that {{incorporated}} formerly independent systems, including ESC. This worked not only after <b>the</b> <b>skid</b> was detected {{but also to}} prevent <b>the</b> <b>skid</b> from occurring in the first place. Using electric variable gear ratio steering power steering, this more advanced system could also alter steering gear ratios and steering torque levels to assist the driver in evasive manoeuvres.|$|E
25|$|The UH-1H also {{features}} a synchronized elevator on the tail boom, which {{is linked to the}} cyclic control and allows a wider center of gravity range. The standard fuel system consists of five interconnected fuel tanks, three of which are mounted behind the transmission and two of which are under the cabin floor. The landing gear consists of two arched cross tubes joining <b>the</b> <b>skid</b> tubes. The skids have replaceable sacrificial skid shoes to prevent wear of <b>the</b> <b>skid</b> tubes themselves. Skis and inflatable floats may be fitted.|$|E
25|$|ESC {{intervenes}} {{only when}} it detects a probable loss of steering control, i.e. when the vehicle is not going where the driver is steering. This may happen, for example, when skidding during emergency evasive swerves, understeer or oversteer during poorly judged turns on slippery roads, or hydroplaning. ESC may also intervene in an unwanted way during high-performance driving, because steering input {{may not always be}} directly indicative of the intended direction of travel (i.e. controlled drifting). ESC estimates the direction of <b>the</b> <b>skid,</b> and then applies the brakes to individual wheels asymmetrically in order to create torque about the vehicle's vertical axis, opposing <b>the</b> <b>skid</b> and bringing the vehicle back in line with the driver's commanded direction. Additionally, the system may reduce engine power or operate the transmission to slow the vehicle down.|$|E

25|$|In 1964, Hughes {{introduced}} the slightly larger three-seat Model 269B which it marketed as the Hughes 300. That same year, the Hughes 269 set an endurance record of 101 hours. To set the record, two pilots took turns piloting the aircraft and hovered in ground-effect for fueling. To ensure no cheating, eggs {{were attached to}} the bottom of <b>the</b> <b>skid</b> gear to register any record-ending landing.|$|E
25|$|During {{the first}} phase, a general {{clean-up}} of the airframe {{was performed to}} reduce drag. New aerodynamic fairings were developed using fiberglass honeycomb sandwich for the rear fuselage, a cambered vertical stabilizer was developed which, in cruise flight, aerodynamically unloaded the tail rotor. <b>The</b> <b>skid</b> landing gear also had streamlined fairings applied to it and the rotor mast {{was replaced by a}} mast that could be tilted in-flight.|$|E
25|$|In early aircraft, a {{tailskid}} made {{of metal}} or wood {{was used to}} support the tail on the ground. In most modern aircraft with conventional landing gear, a small articulated wheel assembly {{is attached to the}} rearmost part of the airframe in place of <b>the</b> <b>skid.</b> This wheel may be steered by the pilot through a connection to the rudder pedals, allowing the rudder and tailwheel to move together.|$|E

25|$|While {{steering}} into <b>the</b> <b>skid</b> (away {{from the}} pursuing vehicle) will reduce its effect, {{the fact that}} the pursuing car is continuing to push the rear of the target sideways virtually ensures loss of control of the targeted vehicle. By moving forward out of position, or by staying squarely in front of the PIT unit the lead vehicle can disallow the PIT unit from gaining proper positioning to conduct the maneuver. Alternatively, rapid deceleration will, of course, force the PIT unit to overshoot the required positioning.|$|E
25|$|That said, {{three of}} the four major {{international}} charities in the region are religious in nature: Northwest Medical Teams International, World Concern, World Vision International, and Mercy Corps. This is part of a long tradition of activist religion. <b>The</b> <b>Skid</b> Road Group, a shelter offering soup and sermons to the unemployed and recovering alcoholics, was launched in Vancouver, with the Salvation Army having deep roots in the Gastown district, dating back to the era of the construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway (1880s) and attained prominence in the same centers during the Klondike Gold Rush.|$|E
25|$|It was an {{innovative}} design and used lightweight aluminium along with techniques developed in aircraft production during World War II. As {{well as a}} novel, weight-saving integral design, it also introduced {{for the first time}} on a bus independent front suspension, power steering, a fully automatic gearbox and power-hydraulic braking. This surprised some early drivers, who found the chassis unexpectedly light and nimble compared with older designs, especially as depicted on film on tests at the Chiswick Works skid pan. Footage of RM200 undergoing <b>the</b> <b>skid</b> test at Chiswick was included in the 1971 film On the Buses.|$|E

25|$|Priscilla Tirado was {{too weak}} to grab the line when the {{helicopter}} returned to her. A watching bystander, Congressional Budget Office assistant Lenny Skutnik, stripped off his coat and boots, and in short sleeves, dove into the icy water and swam out to successfully pull her to shore. The helicopter then proceeded to where Felch had fallen, and paramedic Gene Windsor stepped out onto the helicopter skid and grabbed her by the clothing to lift her onto <b>the</b> <b>skid</b> with him, bringing her to shore. When the helicopter crew returned for Williams, the wreckage he was strapped into had rolled slightly, submerging him—according to the coroner, Williams was the only passenger to die by drowning. His body and those of the other occupants were later recovered.|$|E
25|$|In 1920 the French {{automobile}} and aircraft pioneer Gabriel Voisin experimented with systems that modulated the hydraulic braking pressure on his aircraft brakes {{to reduce the}} risk of tire slippage. These systems use a flywheel and valve attached to a hydraulic line that feeds the brake cylinders. The flywheel is attached to a drum that runs at the same speed as the wheel. In normal braking, the drum and flywheel should spin at the same speed. However, when a wheel slows down, then the drum would do the same, leaving the flywheel spinning at a faster rate. This causes the valve to open, allowing a small amount of brake fluid to bypass the master cylinder into a local reservoir, lowering the pressure on the cylinder and releasing the brakes. The use of the drum and flywheel meant the valve only opened when the wheel was turning. In testing, a 30% improvement in braking performance was noted, because the pilots immediately applied full brakes instead of slowly increasing pressure in order to find <b>the</b> <b>skid</b> point. An additional benefit was the elimination of burned or burst tires.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in September 2013, the LAPD {{started a}} trial {{program for the}} use of body worn cameras with 30 {{officers}} in <b>the</b> <b>Skid</b> Row area. Reports from the trial program indicated that the cameras functioned well and that they assisted in deescalating situations although there were some technical issues with the cameras along with slight issues with the cameras falling off of officers during movement. In November 2014 in a sign of body camera purchases to come, the department chose Taser International as the vendor for body cameras to be used by the LAPD after their use in the trial program earlier in the year. On December 16, 2014 Mayor Eric Garcetti announced that the city would purchase 7,000 body worn cameras from Taser for use by the department. Patrol officers will be equipped with the cameras which will be purchased in the next fiscal year in order to outfit all patrol officers by the expected completion date in June 2016. 700 of the cameras will first be deployed to patrol officers in the Central, Mission and Newton patrol areas of the city beginning in January 2015. $1.55 million was raised from private donors to start the body camera program for the initial rollout phase in order to ease budget constraints for the city with another $1 million coming from the National Institute of Justice, a branch of the Department of Justice. In total, the body cameras will most likely cost less than $10 million and will be included in Garcetti's proposed fiscal year 2016 budget. Before all of the cameras are deployed to patrol officers, the Police Commission will create a policy that governs the use of the cameras and video footage while consulting with department and city officials along with outside organizations including other departments who already use body cameras. While the commission has not created a policy yet as of December 2014, several guidelines were already outlined by the Mayor including that officers would have to turn on the cameras whenever they arrest or detain someone for interrogation, but many public interactions such as domestic violence interviews would not be recorded. The cameras may also be turned off in situations where police use deadly force. Prior to the rollout of any body worn cameras, officers were able to carry personally owned audio recording devices starting in 1994 if they file an application and obtain the requisite permission.|$|E

The following day, on January 31, Darryl Sutter completed a seven player trade with the Toronto Maple Leafs that saw Dion Phaneuf sent to Toronto. Olli Jokinen and Brandon Prust were then sent to the New York Rangers for Ales Kotalik and Chris Higgins a day later in a trade that was first rumoured the evening before but was delayed so that Jokinen and Prust could play with the Flames against the Philadelphia Flyers.|$|E
