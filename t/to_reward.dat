The inputs that a participant contributes to a relationship can be either assets - entitling him/her <b>to</b> <b>rewards</b> - or liabilities - entitling him/her to costs. The entitlement <b>to</b> <b>rewards</b> or costs ascribed to each input {{vary depending on the}} relational setting. In industrial settings, assets such as capital and manual labor are seen as [...] "relevant inputs" [...] - inputs that legitimately entitle the contributor <b>to</b> <b>rewards.</b> In social settings, assets such as physical beauty and kindness are generally seen as assets entitling the possessor <b>to</b> social <b>rewards.</b> Individual traits such as boorishness and cruelty are seen as liabilities entitling the possessor to costs (Walster, Traupmann & Walster, 1978).

40|$|During {{adolescence}} {{there is}} a normative increase in risk-taking behavior, which is reflected in, for example, increases in alcohol consumption. Prior research has demonstrated a link between testosterone and alcohol consumption, and between testosterone and neural responses <b>to</b> <b>rewards.</b> Yet, no study to date tested how testosterone levels and neural responses <b>to</b> <b>rewards</b> relate <b>to</b> and predict individual differences in alcohol use. The current study aimed to investigate this by assessing alcohol use, testosterone levels and neural responses <b>to</b> <b>rewards</b> in adolescents (12 – 17 years old) and young adults (18 – 26 years old). Participants were measured twice with a two-year interval between testing sessions. Cross-sectional analysis showed that at the second time point higher neural activity <b>to</b> <b>rewards,</b> but not testosterone levels, explained significant variance above age in reported alcohol use. Predictive analyses showed that, higher testosterone level at the first time point, but not neural activity <b>to</b> <b>rewards</b> at the first time point, was predictive of more alcohol use at the second time point. These results suggest that neural responses <b>to</b> <b>rewards</b> are correlated with current alcohol consumption, and that testosterone level is predictive of future alcohol consumption. These results are interpreted {{in the context of}} trajectory models of adolescent development...|$|R

40|$|Earlier {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is associated with aberrant sensitivity <b>to</b> <b>rewards</b> and punishments. Although some studies have focused on real-life decision making in children with ADHD using the Iowa gambling task, the number of good deck choices, a frequently used index of decision-making ability in the gambling task, is insufficient for investigating the complex decision-making strategies in subjects. In the present study, we investigated decision-making strategies in ADHD children, analyzing T-patterns with rewards, with punishments, and without rewards and punishments during the gambling task, and examined the relationship between decision-making strategies and skin conductance responses (SCRs) <b>to</b> <b>rewards</b> and punishments. We hypothesized that ADHD children and normal children would employ different decision-making strategies depending on their sensitivity <b>to</b> <b>rewards</b> and punishments in the gambling task. Our results revealed that ADHD children had fewer T-patterns with punishments and exhibited a significant tendency to have many T-patterns with rewards, thus supporting our hypothesis. Moreover, in contrast to normal children, ADHD children failed to demonstrate differences between reward and punishment SCRs, supporting the idea that they had an aberrant sensitivity <b>to</b> <b>rewards</b> and punishments. Therefore, we concluded that ADHD children would be impaired in decision-making strategies depending on their aberrant sensitivity <b>to</b> <b>rewards</b> and punishments. However, we were unable to specify whether large reward SCRs or small punishment SCRs is generated in ADHD children...|$|R
40|$|Functional {{magnetic}} resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to investigate the neural and behavioural correlates of learning from rewards and losses in children. Greater blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) responses in the ventral striatum (VS) and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC) were found when participants received <b>rewards</b> compared <b>to</b> when they missed out on an opportunity <b>to</b> receive <b>rewards.</b> In contrast, greater BOLD responses in the anterior insula (AI) and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) were found when participants received losses compared to when they avoided losing. The BOLD response <b>to</b> <b>rewards</b> in the VS and VMPFC correlated positively with the tendency <b>to</b> select <b>rewards.</b> Greater incidence of early life adversity was associated with greater likelihood <b>to</b> select <b>rewarding</b> stimuli and a larger BOLD response in the VS and VMPFC <b>to</b> <b>rewards.</b> Findings suggest that the functional calibration of the mesocorticolimbic pathway is sensitive {{to the experience of}} early life adversity...|$|R
