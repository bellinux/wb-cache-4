According to Kirkman, it was important to integrate dimension to the character so that viewers [...] "can see later in the episode, when [...] is losing it and actually getting somewhat violent with Lori, the transition he's gone through and how this world has changed him from being a loving, easygoing guy into <b>this</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> is slowly devolving into a bit of a maniac." ...|$|E

Penn explained in 2007 that [...] "the original idea was to have me do a young X-Men spin-off, a spin-off of the young X-Men characters. But someone came up with a pretty interesting idea [...] it was <b>this</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> worked with me named Mike Chamoy, he worked a lot with me on X3. He came up with how to do a young X-Men movie which is not what you'd expect." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1994, Conran {{set up a}} bluescreen in {{his living}} room and began {{assembling}} the tools he would need to create his movie. He was not interested in working his way through the system and instead wanted to follow the route of independent filmmakers like Steven Soderbergh. Initially, Kerry and his brother had nothing more than [...] "just a vague idea of <b>this</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> flew a plane. We would talk about all the obvious things like Indiana Jones and all the stuff we liked." [...] Conran spent four years making a black and white teaser trailer in the style of an old-fashioned movie serial on his Macintosh IIci personal computer. Once he was finished, Conran showed it to producer Marsha Oglesby, who was a friend of his brother's wife and she recommended that he let producer Jon Avnet see it. Conran met Avnet and showed him the trailer. Conran told him that he wanted to make it into a movie. They spent two or three days just talking about the tone of the movie.|$|E
5000|$|In a radio interview, {{director}} Ryan Davies said: [...] "The idea {{we came up}} {{with was}} that of <b>this</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who's</b> completely mental playing the piano until his fingers bleed and attacking random people on the street. There's a lot of blood and gore. The band wanted the video to be juxtaposed to the song, because there's no piano in the actual song." ...|$|R

I've worked with Dr. Lukefor awhile... and he ended up {{introducing}} me to Rivers. Cosgrove about new EP and collaboration with Rivers Cuomo" ...|$|R
5000|$|Donnacha O'Dea {{remembers the}} stunts Rogers pulled to {{generate}} {{interest in the}} Irish Open. “He’d publicise betting on the tournament in the Racing Post along with an event such as the Super Bowl {{so he could get}} around the law on advertising such events. He’d install an outsider such as ‘Suitcase’ Johnny as favourite. Poker players would then see these odds and think to themselves, ‘Well I’m much better than <b>this</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who’s</b> favourite’ and immediately want {{to take part in the}} tournament.” ...|$|R
500|$|Swift became {{inspired}} to write [...] "You Belong with Me" [...] after she overheard a male {{friend of hers}} speaking to his girlfriend through a phone call. He acted defensive as his girlfriend yelled at him, and said to her, [...] "No, baby...I had {{to get off the}} phone really quickly... I tried to call you right back... Of course I love you. More than anything! Baby, I’m so sorry." [...] Out of the sympathy she felt towards him in the situation, Swift developed a concept for a song. In a writing session with co-writer Liz Rose, Swift explained the situation along with her idea and conceived the song's opening line, [...] "You’re on the phone with your girlfriend / she’s upset / she's going off about something that you said." [...] Together, they developed a story line, which described Swift being in love with the male friend and her having the desire for him to break up with his current girlfriend for her. Swift described the song's concept as [...] "basically about wanting someone who is with this girl who doesn't appreciate him at all. Basically like 'girl-next-door-itis.' You like <b>this</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> you have known for your whole life, and you know him better than she does but somehow the popular girl gets the guy every time." [...] Swift recalled, [...] "It was really fun for us to write the line, 'She wears short skirts, I wear T-shirts'." [...] "You Belong with Me" [...] was first released as a promotional single from Fearless on November 4, 2008, as part of Countdown to Fearless, an exclusive campaign by the iTunes Store; the song was then released as the third single from Fearless on April 18, 2009.|$|E
2500|$|For {{roughly the}} next decade Gordon {{controlled}} Jackson with threats, lies, and routine domestic violence. According to Jackson, [...] "When he hit me, the first time I was in shock, I just recalled my ear ringing, just ringing so hard." [...] Gordon confiscated Jackson's passport, transferred her bank accounts into his name, hired bodyguards to watch La Toya constantly and banned her from speaking to or seeing her family, monitoring her every phone call. La Toya's father Joseph stated in his book The Jacksons that he believed Gordon brainwashed La Toya and made her fearful of her own family. Katherine also believed that La Toya had been brainwashed while Gordon claimed that Katherine had tried to kill her daughter. Sister Janet concurred with her parents saying at the time, [...] "I think <b>this</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> is with her has brainwashed her and made her like this... He keeps {{her away from the}} family, and now he's brainwashed her so much she keeps herself away from us." ...|$|E
2500|$|He {{underwent}} a change during mid-1970: [...] "I got stoned {{for the first}} time; I discovered Shakespeare, Dylan Thomas, and all that classic stuff. I read Moby Dick and went back as a junior taking creative writing classes." [...] Jobs also later noted to his official biographer that [...] "I started {{to listen to music}} a whole lot, and I started to read more outside of just science and technology—Shakespeare, Plato. I loved King Lear ... when I was a senior I had this phenomenal AP English class. The teacher was <b>this</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> looked like Ernest Hemingway. He took a bunch of us snowshoeing in Yosemite." [...] From that point, Jobs developed two different circles of friends: those who were involved in electronics and engineering and those who were interested in art and literature. These dual interests were particularly reflected during Jobs's senior year as his best friends were Wozniak and his first girlfriend, the artistic Homestead junior Chrisann Brennan.|$|E

2500|$|According to Amy Lee, {{the song}} has several meanings, the first being an {{incident}} at a restaurant. During an interview from a tour stop in Tulsa she told The Boston Phoenix: [...] "I {{was inspired to}} write it when someone said something to me— I didn’t know him, and I {{thought he might be}} clairvoyant. I was in a relationship and I was completely unhappy. But I was hiding it. I was being completely abused and I was trying to cover it up; I wouldn’t even admit it to myself. So then I had spoken maybe 10 or 15 words to <b>this</b> <b>guy,</b> <b>who</b> was a friend of a friend. We were waiting for everyone else to show up, and we went into a restaurant and got a table. And {{he looked at me and}} said, ‘Are you happy?’ And I felt my heart leap, and I was like, he totally knows what I’m thinking. And I lied, I said I was fine. Anyway, he's not really clairvoyant. But he is a sociology major." [...] Lee said in a VH1 interview: [...] "Open-mindedness. It's about waking up to all the things you've been missing for so long. One day someone said something that made my heart race for a second and I realized that for months I'd been numb, just going through the motions of life." [...] During an interview with Blender, Lee claimed that she wrote [...] "Bring Me to Life" [...] about her longtime friend, Josh Hartzler, whom she married in 2007.|$|E
