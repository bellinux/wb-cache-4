40|$|The {{effect of}} {{electrostatic}} <b>tractions</b> on the fracture {{behavior of a}} dielectric material under mechanical and/or electric loading is analyzed, by studying a pre-cracked parallel-plate capacitor, and illustrated by plots. The results indicate that electrostatic <b>tractions</b> on the electrodes compress the material {{in front of the}} crack tip, while electrostatic <b>tractions</b> on the crack faces have the tendency to close the crack and stretch the material behind the crack tip. Mechanical load is the driving force to propagate the crack, while applied electric field retards crack propagation due to the electrostatic <b>tractions.</b> As a direct consequence, the fracture criterion is composed of two parts: the energy release rate must exceed a critical value and the mechanical load must be higher than the critical value for crack opening...|$|R

40|$|The way {{in which}} basal <b>tractions,</b> {{associated}} with mantle convection, couples with the lithosphere is a fundamental problem in geodynamics. A successful lithosphere-mantle coupling model for the Earth will satisfy observations of plate motions, intraplate stresses, and the plate boundary zone deformation. We solve the depth integrated three-dimensional force balance equations in a global finite element model {{that takes into account}} effects of both topography and shallow lithosphere structure as well as <b>tractions</b> originating from deeper mantle convection. The contribution from topography and lithosphere structure is estimated by calculating gravitational potential energy differences. The basal <b>tractions</b> are derived from a fully dynamic flow model with both radial and lateral viscosity variations. We simultaneously fit stresses and plate motions in order to delineate a best-fit lithosphere-mantle coupling model. We use both the World Stress Map and the Global Strain Rate Model to constrain the models. We find that a strongly coupled model with a stiff lithosphere and 3 - 4 orders of lateral viscosity variations in the lithosphere are best able to match the observational constraints. Our predicted deviatoric stresses, which are dominated by contribution from mantle <b>tractions,</b> range between 20 - 70 MPa. The best-fitting coupled models predict strain rates that are consistent with observations. That is, the intraplate areas are nearly rigid whereas plate boundaries and some other continental deformation zones display high strain rates. Comparison of mantle <b>tractions</b> and surface velocities indicate that in most areas <b>tractions</b> are driving, although in a few regions, including western North America, <b>tractions</b> are resistive.

5|$|Norway is {{a country}} with {{abundance}} of hydroelectricity and NSB saw {{huge amounts of money}} burning up with the imported coal.

40|$|Abstract. We study infinitesimal {{deformations}} of a porous linear elastic body {{saturated with}} an inviscid fluid {{and subjected to}} conservative surface <b>tractions.</b> The gradient of the mass density of the solid phase is also taken as an independent kinematic variable and the corresponding higher-order stresses are considered. Balance laws and constitutive relations for finite deformations are reduced to those for infinitesimal deformations, and expressions for partial surface <b>tractions</b> acting on the solid and the fluid phases are derived. A boundary-value problem for a long hollow porous solid cylinder filled with an ideal fluid is solved, and {{the stability of the}} stressed reference configuration with respect to variations in the values of the coefficient coupling deformations of the two phases is investigated. An example of the problem studied is a cylindrical cavity leached out in salt formations for storing hydrocarbons. Mathematics Subject Classifications (2000) : 74 F 10, 74 F 20.

40|$|Posterior {{vitreous}} detachment is {{a fairly}} common condition in elderly people. <b>Tractions</b> exerted by the detached vitreous on the retina may result in retinal tears and detachments. We studied how these <b>tractions</b> can arise from saccadic eye movements. Numerical simulations have been performed on a two-dimensional model of the vitreous chamber within a rigid spherical sclera, subjected to prescribed finite-amplitude rotations about a vertical axis. The vitreous chamber {{was assumed to be}} split into two regions: one occupied by the detached vitreous, modeled as an elastic viscous solid, and the other occupied by the separated liquefied vitreous, modeled as a Newtonian fluid. At the interface between the two phases, we also considered the presence of the vitreous cortex, modeled as an elastic membrane. We tested several different configurations of the interface. In all cases, we found that eye rotations generate large <b>tractions</b> on the retina close to the attachment points of the membrane. Comparing them, we identified configurations of the vitreous detachment that exhibit higher <b>tractions.</b> We also investigated how the response to saccadic movements depends on some physical parameters, in particular on the rheological properties of the solid phase and the membrane. The numerical simulations show that the generated <b>tractions</b> may be of the same order of magnitude as the adhesive force between the retina and the pigment epithelium. Therefore, the model provides a sound physical justification for the hypothesis that saccadic movements, in the presence of posterior vitreous detachment, could be responsible for high <b>tractions</b> on the retina, which may trigger retinal tear formation...|$|R
40|$|AbstractScattering {{of surface}} waves by a {{cylindrical}} cavity {{at the surface}} of a homogenous, isotropic, linearly elastic half-space is analyzed in this paper. In the usual manner, the scattered field is shown to be equivalent to the radiation from a distribution of <b>tractions,</b> obtained from the incident wave {{on the surface of the}} cavity. For the approximation used in this paper, these <b>tractions</b> are shifted to <b>tractions</b> applied to the projection of the cavity on the surface of the half-space. The radiation of surface waves from a normal and a tangential line load, recently determined by the use of the reciprocity theorem, is employed to obtain the field scattered by the cavity from the superposition of displacements due to the distributed surface <b>tractions.</b> The vertical displacement at some distance from the cavity is compared with the solution of the scattering problem obtained by the boundary element method (BEM) for various depths and widths of the cavity. Comparisons between the analytical and BEM results are graphically displayed. The limitations of the approximate approach are discussed based on the comparisons with the BEM results...|$|R

40|$|A {{spectral}} {{formulation of}} the plane-strain boundary integral equations for an interface between dissimilar elastic solids is presented. The boundary integral equations can be written in two equivalent forms: (a) The <b>tractions</b> can be written as a space-time convolution of the displacement continuities at the interface (Budiansky and Rice, 1979) (b) The displacement discontinuities can be written as a space-time convolution of the <b>tractions</b> at the interface (Kostrov, 1966). Prior work on spectral {{formulation of the}} boundary integral equations has adopted the former as the starting point. The present work has for its basis the latter form based on a space-time convolution of the <b>tractions.</b> <b>Tractions</b> and displacement components are given a spectral representation in the spatial coordinate along the interface. The radiation damping term is then explicitly extracted to avoid singularities in the convolution kernels. With the spectral forms introduced, the space-time convolutions reduce to convolutions in time for each Fourier mode. Due to continuity of <b>tractions</b> at the interface, {{this leads to a}} simpler formulation and form of the convolution kernels in comparison to the formulation involving convolutions over the slip and opening history at the bi-material interface. The convolution kernels are validated by studying some model problems to which analytical solutions are known. When coupled with a cohesive law or a friction law at the interface, the formulation proposed here is of wide applicability for studying spontaneous rupture propagation...|$|R
