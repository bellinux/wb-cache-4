40|$|Abstract: In {{this paper}} we applied change point {{detection}} methods for failures detection in the drilling process.

The minimum of mean <b>time</b> <b>between</b> change points from those three parameters is suggested to be the time for monitoring the drilling process...|$|R

50|$|There {{are many}} {{variations}} of MTBF, such as mean <b>time</b> <b>between</b> system aborts (MTBSA), mean <b>time</b> <b>between</b> critical failures (MTBCF) or mean <b>time</b> <b>between</b> unscheduled removal (MTBUR). Such nomenclature is used {{when it is}} desirable to differentiate among types of failures, such as critical and non-critical failures. For example, in an automobile, {{the failure of the}} FM radio does not prevent the primary operation of the vehicle. Mean time to failure (MTTF) is sometimes used instead of MTBF in cases where a system is replaced after a failure, since MTBF denotes <b>time</b> <b>between</b> failures in a system which is repaired. MTTFd is an extension of MTTF, where MTTFd is only concerned about failures which would result in a dangerous condition.|$|R

40|$|There {{are many}} reasons why an {{applicant}} may retake a selection test, whether it’s due to reasons outside of their control or perhaps their first test administration was unsuccessful. Research has shown that scores generally increase when applicants retake a test. However, research on situational judgment tests and in-basket simulations have been overshadowed by research on admissions tests, cognitive ability tests, and personality tests. Further, much {{research has focused on}} retesting effects during the initial selection process, but the current research aims to shed light on retesting effects during the promotional process. The literature shows conflicting findings regarding <b>time</b> <b>between</b> tests. While some literature says that more <b>time</b> <b>between</b> tests results in larger score increases, other research says that less <b>time</b> <b>between</b> tests results in larger score increases. The current study aims to clarify this conflicting history of research while closing the gap on types of assessments examined in the retesting literature. Results showed that more <b>time</b> <b>between</b> tests resulted in larger score gains for both the SJT and in the in-basket simulation. This is probably {{due to the nature of}} the test. SJTs and In-Baskets require a lot of job knowledge. Having more time on the job between tests would allow candidates to learn more and apply that on their second attempt at promotion. The literature on <b>time</b> <b>between</b> supports this notion. Studies that showed less <b>time</b> <b>between</b> tests resulted in larger score increases were assessing some aspect of cognitive ability. Perhaps for other tests less <b>time</b> <b>between</b> tests allows for greater score increases, but for job knowledge tests, more <b>time</b> <b>between</b> tests allows for these greater score increases. Practical implications and areas for future research are discussed. Keywords: retesting, promotion, in-basket, situational judgment tes...|$|R
