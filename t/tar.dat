5|$|In their ninth {{game of the}} season, the <b>Tar</b> Heels lost to No. 2 Florida State, 203. The {{loss was}} the sole losing effort for the <b>Tar</b> Heels in the 1997 season, and came {{at the hands of}} the {{eventual}} Atlantic Coast champion Seminoles. During the game, the <b>Tar</b> Heels also lost their then-starting quarterback, Oscar Davenport, to a broken ankle. North Carolina recovered from the loss to win its final two games: 1710 against Clemson, and 5014 over Duke. Despite having only one loss, the <b>Tar</b> Heels were denied a chance to participate in a Bowl Alliance game and instead accepted a bid to the 1998 Gator Bowl.|$|E

In their fourth game, the <b>Tar</b> Heels traveled Columbia, South Carolina, to play against South Carolina, where the Gamecocks took the <b>Tar</b> Heels to overtime before North Carolina was able to come away with the victory by four points. Near the end of December, the <b>Tar</b> Heels participated in the annual Dixie Classic The <b>Tar</b> Heels won the classic, and also remained undefeated, after beating Wake Forest in the championship game. North Carolina then won five more games before going into double overtime against Maryland and winning the game 6561 to earn their seventeenth consecutive victory. In the following game, Duke and North Carolina were tied at 7373 before <b>Tar</b> Heel Kearns sank two free throws to give North Carolina a two-point lead before the game ended. The <b>Tar</b> Heels closed out the regular season with six more victories to end the season with a record of 240. North Carolina won their quarterfinal matchup in the ACC Tournament by twenty points to advance to the semifinals against Wake Forest. The Demon Deacons were ahead 5958 as the game entered the final minute. With time running out, Rosenbluth made a two-point shot and was fouled in the act of shooting, which sent him to the line to shoot a free throw; he made the free throw and the <b>Tar</b> Heels won 6159.

5|$|Chamberlain {{made the}} First Team of the All-America squad and led his Jayhawks into the NCAA finals against the <b>Tar</b> Heels of North Carolina. In that game, <b>Tar</b> Heels coach Frank McGuire used several unorthodox tactics to thwart Chamberlain. For the tip-off, {{he sent his}} {{shortest}} player, Tommy Kearns, in order to rattle Chamberlain, and the <b>Tar</b> Heels {{spent the rest of}} the night triple-teaming him, one defender in front, one behind, and a third arriving as soon as he got the ball. With their fixation on Chamberlain, the Jayhawks shot only 27% from the field, as opposed to 64% of the <b>Tar</b> Heels, and trailed 22–29 at halftime. Later, North Carolina led 40–37 with 10 minutes to go and stalled the game: they passed the ball around without any intention of scoring a basket. After several <b>Tar</b> Heel turnovers, the game was tied at 46 at the end of regulation. In the first overtime each team scored two points, and in the second overtime Kansas froze the ball in return, keeping the game tied at 48. In the third overtime, the <b>Tar</b> Heels scored two consecutive baskets, but Chamberlain executed a three-point play, leaving KU trailing 52–51. After King scored a basket, Kansas was ahead by one point, but then <b>Tar</b> Heel Joe Quigg was fouled on a drive with 10 seconds remaining and made his two foul shots. For the final play, Dick Harp called for Ron Loneski to pass the ball into Chamberlain in the low post. The pass was intercepted, however, and the <b>Tar</b> Heels won the game. Nonetheless, Chamberlain, who scored 23 points and 14 rebounds, was elected the Most Outstanding Player of the Final Four. Cherry has speculated, however, that this loss was a watershed in Chamberlain's life, because it was the first time that his team lost despite him putting up impressive individual stats. Chamberlain later admitted that this loss was the most painful of his life.|$|E
