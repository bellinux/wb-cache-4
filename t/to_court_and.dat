5|$|Anna Maria Luisa and Johann Wilhelm, notwithstanding, {{shared a}} {{harmonious}} marriage. The Electress spent her time enjoying balls, musical performances and other festivities. He commissioned a theatre for her where the comedies of French playwright Molière were performed. Because Anna Maria Luisa patronised many musicians, the contemporary Palatine court enjoyed regard {{as an international}} centre of music. She invited Fortunato Chelleri <b>to</b> <b>court</b> <b>and</b> appointed him maestro di cappella ("music teacher"). Agostino Steffani, a polymath, {{was sponsored by the}} Electress from his arrival in Düsseldorf, in 1703, until her return to Tuscany; the Conservatorio library in Florence houses two editions of his chamber duets.|$|E
5|$|As Heyer's {{popularity}} increased, {{other authors}} began to imitate her style. In May 1950, {{one of her}} readers notified her that Barbara Cartland had written several novels in a style similar to Heyer's, reusing names, character traits and plot points and paraphrased descriptions from her books, particularly A Hazard of Hearts, which borrowed characters from Friday's Child, and The Knave of Hearts which took off These Old Shades. Heyer completed {{a detailed analysis of}} the alleged plagiarisms for her solicitors, and while the case never came <b>to</b> <b>court</b> <b>and</b> no apology was received, the copying ceased. Her lawyers suggested that she leak the copying to the press. Heyer refused.|$|E
5|$|As {{the spring}} of 1794 approached, the Committee of Public Safety, led by Robespierre, Couthon, Lebas and Saint-Just, {{exercised}} near complete control over the government. Despite the vast reach of their powers, however, rivals and enemies remained. One of the thorniest problems, at least to Robespierre, came {{in the shape of}} the populist agitator Jacques Hébert, who discharged torrents of criticism against bourgeois Jacobinism in his newspaper, Le Père Duchesne. Ultra-radical Hébertists in the Cordeliers Club undermined Jacobin efforts <b>to</b> <b>court</b> <b>and</b> manage the sans-culottes, and the most extreme Hébertists even called openly for insurrection.|$|E

40|$|In this {{keynote speech}} for the Seattle University School of Law Colloquium on the 25 th Anniversary of the Summary Judgment Trilogy: Reflections on Summary Judgment, Professor Suja Thomas {{discusses}} access <b>to</b> <b>courts</b> <b>and</b> juries {{before and after}} the summary judgment trilogy. Following up on debate in the academic literature on the effect of the trilogy on summary judgment, Professor Thomas explores influences on the trilogy and influences of the trilogy outside of summary judgment. She first describes Supreme Court decisions on judgment notwithstanding the verdict, remittitur, and the directed verdict, which helped {{set the stage for the}} trilogy and which decreased litigants 2 ̆ 7 access <b>to</b> <b>courts</b> <b>and</b> juries. She then explores access after the trilogy. Professor Thomas describes how access <b>to</b> <b>courts</b> <b>and</b> juries continued <b>to</b> decline through the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s decisions on arbitration and the motion to dismiss. Professor Thomas gives all of these procedures some context by showing their effect on one class of factually intensive cases employment discrimination cases. She concludes by introducing the concept of 2 ̆ 2 the Other Branch 2 ̆ 2 and states that access <b>to</b> <b>courts</b> <b>and</b> juries can possibly increase if the jury is viewed in this manner...|$|R
5|$|Like most cats, the jaguar is solitary outside mother–cub groups. Adults {{generally}} meet only <b>to</b> <b>court</b> <b>and</b> mate (though limited noncourting socialization {{has been}} observed anecdotally) and carve out large territories for themselves. Female territories, which range from 25 to 40km2 in size, may overlap, but the animals generally avoid one another. Male ranges cover roughly twice as much area, varying in size with the availability of game and space, and do not overlap. The territory of a male can contain those of several females. The jaguar uses scrape marks, urine, and feces to mark its territory.|$|E
5|$|On 20 January 1936, George V died at Sandringham and Edward {{ascended the}} throne as King Edward VIII. The next day, he broke royal {{protocol}} {{by watching the}} proclamation of his accession from a window of St James's Palace, {{in the company of}} the still-married Wallis. It was becoming apparent <b>to</b> <b>Court</b> <b>and</b> Government circles that the new King-Emperor meant to marry her. The King's behaviour and his relationship with Wallis made him unpopular with the Conservative-led British government, as well as distressing his mother and his brother, the Duke of York. The British media remained deferential to the monarchy, and no stories of the affair were reported in the domestic press, but foreign media widely reported their relationship.|$|E
5|$|The conflict, however, {{continued}} {{over the}} following years. On 8 October, Northumberland and Salisbury were summoned <b>to</b> <b>court</b> <b>and</b> ordered to end the conflict, but the warnings were ignored. Instead, the collective forces of the Percy and Neville families gathered at their Yorkshire strongholds of Topcliffe and Sand Hutton respectively, {{only a few miles}} apart. Both sides had ignored royal commands to disband, and battle seemed inevitable, but eventually a truce ensued and the forces withdrew. Then, in October 1454, Thomas Percy and his brother Richard were captured by the Nevilles in a battle at Stamford Bridge. The conflict was escalating, and converging with events in national politics.|$|E

5|$|After 1143 the war ground on, but {{progressing}} {{slightly better}} for Stephen. Miles of Gloucester, {{one of the}} most talented Angevin commanders, had died whilst hunting over the previous Christmas, relieving some of the pressure in the west. Geoffrey de Mandeville's rebellion continued until September 1144, when he died during an attack on Burwell. The war in the west progressed better in 1145, with the King recapturing Faringdon Castle in Oxfordshire. In the north, Stephen came to a fresh agreement with Ranulf of Chester, but then in 1146 repeated the ruse he had played on Geoffrey de Mandeville in 1143, first inviting Ranulf to court, before arresting him and threatening to execute him unless he handed over a number of castles, including Lincoln and Coventry. As with Geoffrey, the moment Ranulf was released he immediately rebelled, but the situation was a stalemate: Stephen had few forces in the north with which to prosecute a fresh campaign, whilst Ranulf lacked the castles to support an attack on Stephen. By this point, however, Stephen's practice of inviting barons <b>to</b> <b>court</b> <b>and</b> arresting them had brought him into some disrepute and increasing distrust.|$|E
5|$|During the 19th century, Bond Street {{became less}} {{known for its}} social {{atmosphere}} but increased its reputation as a street for luxury shopping. The auctioneer Phillips was established in 1796 at No.101 Bond Street, specialising in stringed instruments and sheet music. The jewellers Asprey originally opened in 1830 at Nos.165–169 New Bond Street. The Jewish practice of Kabbalah {{has been associated with}} the street after former East End trader Sarah Levenson opened a shop on No.50 New Bond Street in 1856 which immediately became profitable, albeit through exaggerated and questionable product claims. Levenson was twice taken <b>to</b> <b>court</b> <b>and</b> prosecuted for fraud; each prosecution resulted in a five-year prison sentence. She died midway through the second. Nevertheless, the practice regained popularity and a Kabbalah Centre remains on the street.|$|E
5|$|Eric and Leslie Ludy {{met when}} Eric was 21 and Leslie was 16. They pursued a {{friendship}} {{for several months}} before starting <b>to</b> <b>court,</b> <b>and</b> married in December 1994, the same month that Eric turned 24. In When God Writes Your Love Story, the Ludys advise single people not to be physically or emotionally intimate with others, but {{to wait for the}} life partner that God has planned for them; the Ludys suggest that one should marry this person rather than independently choosing a mate. Also focusing on premarital physical and emotional purity, the authors do not discuss the physical processes of sexual activity. Like many other Christian books about premarital romantic relationships, the Ludys' book explicitly does not present a set of rules to follow or a strategy for romantic success, but rather gives readers a framework for pursuing Christian romantic relationships; the book is intended to be a tool {{in the creation of the}} reader's unique romantic relationship rather than as a blueprint explaining what all Christian romantic relationships are supposed to look like.|$|E

5|$|In 1525 Dudley married Guildford's {{daughter}} Jane, who {{was four}} years his junior and his former classmate. The Dudleys belonged to the new evangelical circles of the early 1530s, and their 13 children were educated in Renaissance humanism and science. Sir Edward Guildford died in 1534 without a written will. His only son having predeceased him, Guildford's nephew, John Guildford, asserted that his uncle had intended him to inherit. Dudley and his wife contested this claim. The parties went <b>to</b> <b>court</b> <b>and</b> Dudley, who had secured Thomas Cromwell's patronage, won the case. In 1532 he lent his cousin, John Sutton, 3rd Baron Dudley, over ₤7,000 on {{the security of the}} baronial estate. Lord Dudley was unable to pay off any of his creditors, so when the mortgage was foreclosed in the late 1530s Sir John Dudley came into possession of Dudley Castle.|$|E
5|$|In January and February 1554, Wyatt's {{rebellion}} broke out; it {{was soon}} suppressed. Elizabeth was brought <b>to</b> <b>court,</b> <b>and</b> interrogated regarding her role, and on 18 March, she was imprisoned in the Tower of London. Elizabeth fervently protested her innocence. Though {{it is unlikely that}} she had plotted with the rebels, some of them were known to have approached her. Mary's closest confidant, Charles V's ambassador Simon Renard, argued that her throne would never be safe while Elizabeth lived; and the Chancellor, Stephen Gardiner, worked to have Elizabeth put on trial. Elizabeth's supporters in the government, including Lord Paget, convinced Mary to spare her sister in the absence of hard evidence against her. Instead, on 22 May, Elizabeth was moved from the Tower to Woodstock, where she was to spend almost a year under house arrest in the charge of Sir Henry Bedingfield. Crowds cheered her all along the way.|$|E
5|$|In June 1560, Michel de l'Hôpital was {{appointed}} Chancellor of France. He sought {{the support of}} France's constitutional bodies and worked closely with Catherine to defend {{the law in the}} face of the growing anarchy. Neither saw the need to punish Protestants who worshipped in private and did not take up arms. On 20 August 1560, Catherine and the chancellor advocated this policy to an assembly of notables at Fontainebleau. Historians regard the occasion as an early example of Catherine's statesmanship. Meanwhile, Condé raised an army and in autumn 1560 began attacking towns in the south. Catherine ordered him <b>to</b> <b>court</b> <b>and</b> had him imprisoned as soon as he arrived. He was tried in November, found guilty of offences against the crown, and sentenced to death. His life was saved by the illness and death of the king, as a result of an infection or an abscess in his ear.|$|E

5|$|On {{arrival in}} Britain, Seymour was celebrated and {{rewarded with a}} baronetcy for his second victory in {{less than six months}} while all of his {{officers}} were promoted. Niémen was purchased into the Navy for the sum of £29,979-2-10d, which was split between the government, the crew {{and a number of other}} parties. The share that went to the captors came under dispute: Mends had no intention of abiding by Seymour's agreement with Maitland and refused to allow Emerald to share in the prize money. Seymour and Maitland took Mends <b>to</b> <b>court</b> <b>and</b> the ensuing legal battle lasted years, Mends deliberately exaggerating his role in the capture of Niémen in public (although privately admitting that the victory was entirely Seymour's). Seymour and Mends became bitter enemies and their animosity continued throughout their lives, although both remained in the Navy and had successful careers. Forty years later, the battle was among the actions recognised by a clasp attached to the Naval General Service Medal, awarded upon application to all British participants still living in 1847.|$|E
5|$|Responsibility {{for running}} the {{university}} is held at an executive level by the vice-chancellor, but the council is the only body that can recommend changes to the university's statutes and charter, {{with the exception of}} academic ordinances. These can only be made with the consent of the senate, the chief academic body in the university which also holds responsibility for teaching and learning, examinations and research and enterprise. The chancellor and pro chancellors are nominated by council and appointed formally by court, whose additional powers are now limited to these appointments and a few others, including some lay members of council. Finally, Convocation, the body of all staff, ceremonial officers and graduates of the university, returns 100 members <b>to</b> <b>court</b> <b>and</b> one member to council, but is otherwise principally a forum for discussion and to ensure graduates stay in touch with the university.|$|E

One day, Bran visits her, accompanied by his new fiance Lady Nimiar Argaliar and the Marquis of Shevraeth, who is preparing to take the throne of Remalna. Now accustomed to the fine fashions of court, Bran expresses dismay at finding Mel dressed in old clothes - she never before cared about her appearance. Mel becomes shy and embarrassed about her lack of courtly finesse and grace, and avoids the visitors, especially Shevraeth, who she fears looks down on her.
