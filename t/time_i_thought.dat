5|$|My first {{memory of}} {{fragrance}} is my mother, {{and as a}} very young girl, hearing her footsteps... Her stilettos click, click, clicking on the hardwood floor and she wore a beautiful fragrance and she would walk past me and it would just stay in the room. It left a warm feeling every <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> about her scent. I think about the icons that I respect {{and they all have}} their own fragrance so I thought {{it was time for me}} to have my own.|$|E
25|$|If I {{knew what}} I know now I {{probably}} would have switched. At the time I had already been playing two or three years, {{and it seemed like}} I had been playing a long <b>time.</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> I’d never be able to change the way I played. The reality of the situation was that I hadn’t been playing very long at all, and I probably could have spent {{the same amount of time}} learning to play right handed. I did have a go at it, but I just didn’t have the patience. It seemed impossible to me. I decided to make do with what I had, and I made some plastic fingertips for myself. I just persevered with it.|$|E
500|$|After two false {{starts from}} other skaters, Ohno won {{gold in the}} 500m {{when he took the}} lead with an {{explosive}} start and held it until the finish. [...] Despite criticism that he appeared to move before the start, a violation of the rules, the race start was validated by the officials. [...] Afterward, Ohno said, [...] "I was in the moment at the <b>time.</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> I timed the start just perfect. The starter had been pretty quick all day, so that's why there were so many false starts at the beginning. But that was really good for me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I’m sure I didn’t want him," [...] said Miss Wheeler, hastily. [...] "Two {{or three}} <b>times</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> {{there would have}} been a fight with the people behind." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't go yet. I dreamed just now, Jack,--dreamed of old <b>times.</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> that Sue and me {{was being}} married agin, {{and that the}} parson, Jack, was--who do you think?--you!" ...|$|R
6000|$|But {{you were}} sleeping; and I said, [...] "It's not for them: it's mine". [...] And {{if it comes}} [3] three <b>times,</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought,</b> <b>I</b> take it for a sign. [...] And once again it came, and close beside the window-bars, [...] Then seem'd to go right up to Heaven and die among the stars.|$|R
500|$|Five {{months after}} the Olympic session, with the Beatles having now broken up, [...] "My Sweet Lord" [...] was one of 30 or more tracks that Harrison {{recorded}} for his All Things Must Pass triple album. It was a song he had been reluctant to record, for fear of committing himself publicly to such an overt religious message. [...] "I was sticking my neck out on the chopping block because now I would have {{to live up to}} something," [...] Harrison explained in I Me Mine, [...] "but at the same <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> 'Nobody's saying it; I wish somebody else was doing it.'" ...|$|E
500|$|The Los Angeles Times spent a full {{paragraph}} on a vignette {{about two}} high school prom dresses. [...] The junior prom dress was a conservative powder blue gown to wear with a nerdy date. The senior prom dress was a sexy black mini dress that was befitting of her more desirable date. The dresses presented an identity crisis to one character: [...] "Here's the thing – I've never really known for sure which {{of those two}} people I am – the girl who almost doesn't get asked to the prom at all or the girl who gets {{to go with the}} really cute guy. Every <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> I knew which one I was, I {{turned out to be the}} other. Which is one reason I think I got married, to, like, end the confusion." ...|$|E
500|$|At the 2012 San Diego Comic-Con International, Whedon {{said he was}} {{undecided}} about directing. However, in August 2012, Iger announced that Whedon would return to write and direct the sequel and develop the Marvel television series, Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., for ABC. Later in the month, Disney set a May 1, 2015 release date. When asked about his decision to return, Whedon said, [...] "Avengers 2, it wasn't a tough decision. For a long <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought,</b> 'Well, it's {{just not going to}} happen.' Then when I actually started to consider it, it became so clear that I desperately wanted to say more about these characters, it would've been an easy no and it was a spectacularly easy yes. There was no wrestling." [...] Whedon said that they intended for the film's production to not be as rushed as the first one.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, {{it is n't}} an answer," [...] said Acton. [...] "I {{have wished}} to ask you, many <b>times.</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> it {{probable}} you would tell me yourself. The question, on my part, seems abrupt now; {{but it would be}} abrupt at any time." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'I {{have met}} him twice. Both times near home. Both times at night, when I was going back. Both <b>times</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> (though that may easily be my mistake), that he hardly {{looked as if}} he had met me by accident.' 'Did he say anything?' ...|$|R
500|$|In {{the summer}} of 2000, Stevens was offered the {{opportunity}} to volunteer in the Butler basketball office. He ran the idea of quitting his job at Eli Lilly by then-longtime girlfriend Tracy Wilhelmy. She {{thought about it for}} two hours before telling him to go for it. [...] "Now, it looks like a great idea," [...] Stevens later remarked. [...] "At the <b>time,</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> it was something I really wanted to try." [...] Tracy went back to school to get a law degree that could support the couple if things did not work out for Brad. [...] "We were 23 and realized this was our chance," [...] Tracy later said. [...] "Five years down the road, we were probably {{not going to be in}} a position to do that. The more success you had at Lilly, the harder it would be to leave." ...|$|E
500|$|Harring {{described}} her interpretation {{after seeing the}} film: [...] "When I saw it the first <b>time,</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> it {{was the story of}} Hollywood dreams, illusion and obsession. It touches on the idea that nothing is quite as it seems, especially the idea of being a Hollywood movie star. The second and third times I saw it, I thought it dealt with identity. Do we know who we are? And then I kept seeing different things in it... There's no right or wrong to what someone takes away from it or what they think the film is really about. It's a movie that makes you continuously ponder, makes you ask questions. I've heard over and over, 'This is a movie that I'll see again' or 'This is a movie you've got to see again.' It intrigues you. You want to get it, but I don't think it's a movie to be gotten. It's achieved its goal if it makes you ask questions." ...|$|E
500|$|Drizzt {{was created}} by happenstance. In 1987 R.A. Salvatore sent Mary Kirchoff, then {{managing}} editor of TSR's book department, a manuscript for what would become his 1990 novel Echoes of the Fourth Magic. She liked it, but {{asked if he could}} rewrite it to take place in the Forgotten Realms. She sent him Darkwalker on Moonshae by Douglas Niles, the only novel at the time set in the Forgotten Realms. Salvatore sent her a proposal for a sequel to Darkwalker, but Kirchoff sent back a large map of the Forgotten Realms and told him she wanted a new story set in {{a different part of the}} Realms. After two weeks of phone calls, Salvatore found a spot on the map that was not already designated for another project, and he located Icewind Dale there. According to Salvatore, the book was [...] "set on the Moonshae Isles, because at the <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> that was the Realms. When I found out how big the Realms were, I moved the story a thousand miles to the north." ...|$|E
60|$|Several <b>times</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> heard faint sounds {{behind me}} as of {{somebody}} moving cautiously, but eventually even these ceased, and I {{was left to}} the contemplation of my position without interruption. I could but vaguely conjecture the cause of my paralysis, and my only hope lay in that it might pass off as suddenly as it had fallen upon me.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I really can't say,' replied Eugene, {{shaking his}} head blankly, after pausing again to reconsider. 'At <b>times</b> <b>I</b> have <b>thought</b> yes; at other <b>times</b> <b>I</b> have <b>thought</b> no. Now, <b>I</b> have been {{inclined}} to pursue such a subject; now I have {{felt that it was}} absurd, and that it tired and embarrassed me. Absolutely, I can't say. Frankly and faithfully, I would if I could.' ...|$|R

500|$|Although the {{gameplay}} {{was praised}} by several reviewers, some found {{the game to}} be unnecessarily long, repetitive and unforgiving. In a mixed review, McCaffrey felt that the game does not offer many options of survival, requiring players {{to spend most of}} their time hiding in lockers [...] "staring at the motion tracker". Polygon criticised the overexposure to the alien creature, turning Alien: Isolation into an irritating experience. As Gies explained, [...] "Every <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> I heard the monster, every blip on my motion tracker, was a cause for a tightness in my chest at first. By the 300th time I dived under a table or into a locker, I wasn't scared anymore — I was annoyed." [...] Despite the criticism, Alien: Isolation was considered a [...] "brave" [...] title due to its difficult and unforgiving gameplay, a feature that is uncommon in games with large development costs. As of January 2015, Alien: Isolation has sold over one million copies worldwide according to Sega. As of March 2015, the game has sold over 2.1 million copies in Europe and the US.|$|E
500|$|Arular {{takes its}} title from the {{political}} code name employed by M.I.A.'s father, Arul Pragasam, during his involvement with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, popularly known as the Tamil Tigers; she contends that her father's [...] "revolutionary ideals" [...] are the album's thematic base. [...] "In Sri Lankan, arular means 'enlightenment from the sunshine' or something", she remarked, [...] "but a friend pointed {{out that it was}} a pun in English – 'a ruler' – which is funny because he is a politician. And my mum always used to say about my father, 'He was so useless, all he ever gave you was his name'. So I turned it around and turned that something into nothing. And at the same <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> {{it would be a good}} way to find him. If he really was an egomaniac, he'd be looking himself up and he'd get this pop album stealing his name that would turn out to be me, and he'd have to get in touch", a prediction which ultimately came true.) ...|$|E
500|$|Television {{columnist}} Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger {{wrote that}} despite [...] "Don Geiss, America and Hope" [...] not being [...] "strong" [...] {{as the last}} episode it had [...] "many funny moments scattered throughout" [...] that he was satisfied with. He noted that the uncomfortable relationship between Liz and Wesley [...] "worked better" [...] here than previously. Sepinwall said it [...] "was a good story" [...] for Jack's character, {{and that it was}} [...] "nice" [...] to see 30 Rock [...] "fearless about mocking their future Comcast overlords as they are at making fun of NBC". The A.V. Clubs Nathan Rabin enjoyed Michael Sheen's return, said that every part of Liz and Wesley's story was [...] "brilliant". He observed that Jack's midlife crisis here was [...] "poignant as well as funny." [...] Overall, Rabin gave it a B+ rating, and concluded [...] "...it was a rock-solid episode". Despite enjoying Sheen's role on the show, Time contributor James Poniewozik confessed he had a problem with his story arc with Tina Fey's Liz. [...] "I assume that [...] is not going to become a permanent cast member, and so however much I might enjoy parts of this story, I can never forget that this is probably one more relationship that Liz will go through and end up at status quo ante." [...] Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad was complimentary towards the NBC/Kabletown deal, enjoyed Tracy's subplot, noting it gave the character [...] "something important to do... it also shined some new light on the Tracy Morgan character." [...] Adam Mersel for TV Guide reasoned [...] "I can officially say that almost no episode of 30 Rock falls flat for me, and this one certainly didn't [...] All in all, {{this is one of my}} favorite episodes of the season." [...] Paste magazine contributor Sean Gandert was favorable to it, noting [...] "I'm not sure when the last <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> every plot in a 30 Rock episode was a winner, but 'Don Geiss, Hope and America' delivered on the exuberant claims of the episode's title". Nick Catucci of New York magazine wrote that Jack trying to fit in at Kabletown, along with his suggestion of [...] "porn for women", was [...] "meh", Liz dealing with Wesley and Tracy [...] "dealing with the world's discovery of his fidelity to his wife" [...] were all [...] "quite comfortably situated in the show's wheelhouse".|$|E

2500|$|Kondabolu's humor often {{centers on}} social issues such as poverty, racism, and a {{rejection}} of Indian stereotypes seen in media. He describes writing a July 2003 joke, which focused on the British Raj taking the Koh-i-Noor diamond from India, as [...] "the first <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought,</b> 'Okay, this is who I actually am.

2500|$|As rosh yeshiva and mashgiach, {{he acted}} warmly toward his students.

[...] But I just never thought that we'd be the ones to help do it. And I think a lot of {{what it comes down to}} is we just cared more.|$|E

I like the way she moves on the court. She's very balanced". Bollettieri stated that Watson's [...] "game is based on great movement, but she's not afraid to whack the ball. She's not easy to beat. She has very good ground strokes, though she can over-hit and strike the ball a little too flat at times".|$|E
2500|$|A true {{indication}} of how successful the Beatles became thanks to [...] "From Me to You" [...] (though it would soon be overshadowed by [...] "She Loves You" [...] and [...] "I Want to Hold Your Hand") was expressed by McCartney: [...] "The first <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> we'd really made it, was when I was lying in bed one morning, and I heard a milkman whistling 'From Me to You'. Actually, I'm sure that I once heard a bird whistling it as well. I swear I did!" ...|$|E
2500|$|In a 1971 {{conference at}} Columbia University, Borges {{was asked about}} the story by a student from the {{creative}} writing program. He recalled, [...] "When the Germans were defeated I felt great joy and relief, but at the same <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> of the German defeat as being somehow tragic, because here we have perhaps the most educated people in Europe, [...] who have a fine literature, a fine tradition of philosophy and poetry. Yet these people were bamboozled by a madman named Adolf Hitler, and I think there is tragedy there." ...|$|E
