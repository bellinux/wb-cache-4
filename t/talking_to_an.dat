500|$|Several {{witnesses}} were LaRouche followers who testified under immunity from prosecution. A former fundraiser {{testified that he}} was told, [...] "No matter what the person you are talking to says, get the money. [...] If you are <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> unemployed worker {{who says he has}} got to feed ... a dozen children, forget it. Get the money. Most of these people are immoral anyway. This is the most moral thing they have ever done is to give you money." ...|$|E

[...] Selector Dick Jones weighed in with the observation that it was [...] "good to watch him <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> old player, listening attentively to everything that is said and then replying with a modest 'thank you'." ...|$|E

500|$|Finally, on November 1, the Masked Avengers {{were able}} to talk to Palin. The call began with Trudel, who claimed to be an aide to Sarkozy named [...] "Frank l’ouvrier", <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> {{assistant}} to Palin who identifies herself as [...] "Lexi". Lexi puts Palin on the line, who says [...] "hello" [...] only to realize that Trudel is still on the other line. Trudel tells Palin to hold on for a moment while he gives the phone to Sarkozy, who is really Audette. Palin can be heard talking to someone in the room about when to hand Palin the phone. Audette then begins to speak and a somewhat extended conversation ensues.|$|E
500|$|Following Babe's arrival, it was {{speculated that}} she could be in contact with her sister, Sylvie (Marlowe). In her first episode, Babe was shown to be {{frequently}} in contact with her, despite telling Shirley she had not spoken to her. In a later episode, Babe claims to the Carter family that she lives alone and feels [...] "lonely" [...] without Sylvie, having not been in contact with her. Babe also claims that she misses having someone [...] "to share half a beer with {{at the end of a}} long day." [...] However, later scenes in the episodes depicted Babe <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> unknown person off-screen as she opens a bottle of beer for the them to share.|$|E
500|$|Clive Russell, who portrayed Brynden [...] "Blackfish" [...] Tully in the series, {{spoke about}} his character's {{encounter}} with Brienne of Tarth, {{in an interview}} with IGN, noting [...] "Brienne represented for him his young self, a person of integrity, a soldier of integrity, {{trying to do the right}} thing. That added to the conflict he felt of what was the right thing to do: whether to send men to Sansa or not." [...] He continued by saying about their relationship to each other, [...] "She spoke very clearly to power. She was <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> older man who's, initially, very irritated by her being there, but eventually takes her very, very seriously. There's a touching moment where he acknowledges that to her face. It's very touching and sad, and I think that's what it's about. He's really recognizing the next generation of what I once was." ...|$|E

500|$|Despite {{the mixed}} responses, the episode {{features}} {{one of the}} [...] "most used little clips" [...] of the series. The scene shows Grampa getting his driver's license. Instead of taking a photo for the license on the spot, Grampa suggests that Patty, {{who works in the}} facility, use a photo of him from a newspaper headline that reads [...] "Old man yells at cloud." [...] Patty agrees, and Grampa, holding his newly acquired license, goes up to a window and yells [...] "Who's laughing now?" [...] at a cloud. A still from the scene has been used several times on The Daily Show. Both Malkowski of DVD Verdict and Jacobsson of DVD Movie Guide considered it to be {{the best part of the}} episode. After Clint Eastwood's speech at the 2012 Republican National Convention, which featured Eastwood <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> empty chair representing President Barack Obama, a modified version of the image with the caption, [...] "Old man yells at chair", was used in an internet meme.|$|E
500|$|Mulan {{served as}} Wen's first voice-acting role. In an {{interview}} with IGN, the actress elaborated on the recording process, specifically {{the fact that she}} was required to record the majority of the character's dialogue in isolation, saying, [...] "I just loved the story so much and identified so much with the character of Mulan it was easy for me. I loved using my imagination. I felt like I was a little kid again, being silly with an imaginary sword and riding on an imaginary horse and <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> imaginary dragon. So it was a lot of fun for me." [...] In spite of the fact that, throughout the film, Mulan shares several intimate scenes with her guardian, a miniature Chinese dragon named Mushu who is voiced by American actor and comedian Eddie Murphy, Wen and her co-star never actually encountered each other while working on Mulan due to the fact that they recorded their respective dialogue at separate times in separate locations.|$|E
500|$|Homer {{sings the}} end of the theme song to Family Ties while <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> {{administrator}} at the annex center. Smithers's recollection of his marriage parodies the two plays Cat on a Hot Tin Roof and A Streetcar Named Desire, both written by American playwright Tennessee Williams. Homer's bedroom rant to Marge is a parody mishmash of four popular films: ...And Justice for All (1979), A Few Good Men (1992), Patton (1970), and Chinatown (1974). He says: [...] "Look Marge, you don't know what it's like. I'm the one out there every day putting his ass on the line. And I'm not out of order! You're out of order. The whole freaking system is out of order. You want the truth? You want the truth?! You can't handle the truth! 'Cause when you reach over and put your hand into a pile of goo that was your best friend's face, you'll know what to do! Forget it, Marge, it's Chinatown," [...] all of which are lines from those films.|$|E

500|$|In {{a review}} for The Providence Journal, Andy Smith remarked {{that the author}} was [...] "a master of atmosphere, if not character" [...] – a {{sentiment}} echoed by The Post and Couriers Dan Conover, who, although praising the novel's intelligence and contemporary relevance, felt that Gibson's underlying political pre-occupation and detached narration came {{at the expense of}} character development. Neil Drumming, of Entertainment Weekly, in awarding the novel a [...] "B" [...] rating concurred, complaining that the protagonists [...] "often just feel like higher-tech automatons with useful features" [...] whose actions are the product of manipulation by [...] "external forces and cagey operatives" [...] rather than conscious decisions. In The Daily Telegraph, Roger Perkins was more blunt, remarking that the [...] "relentless pace and breathless dislocation" [...] of the plot hid [...] "character development that's as deep as dental veneer but equally shiny". Matt Thorne summed up the issue in opining that [...] "The problem with a thriller which begins with a technology journalist <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> experimental artist is that, no matter how exciting the events later become, it's hard to care." ...|$|E
500|$|Las Meninas {{is set in}} Velázquez's {{studio in}} PhilipIV's Alcázar palace in Madrid. The high-ceilinged room is presented, {{in the words of}} Silvio Gaggi, as [...] "a simple box that could be divided into a {{perspective}} grid with a single vanishing point". In the centre of the foreground stands the Infanta Margaret Theresa(1). The five-year-old infanta, who later married Holy Roman Emperor LeopoldI, was at this point Philip and Mariana's only surviving child. She is attended by two ladies-in-waiting, or meninas: doña Isabel de Velasco(2), who is poised to curtsy to the princess, and doña María Agustina Sarmiento de Sotomayor(3), who kneels before Margaret Theresa, offering her a drink from a red cup, or bucaro, that she holds on a golden tray. To the right of the Infanta are two dwarfs: the achondroplastic German, Maribarbola (4) (Maria Barbola), and the Italian, Nicolas Pertusato(5), who playfully tries to rouse a sleepy mastiff with his foot. The dog is thought to be descended from two mastiffs from Lyme Hall in Cheshire, given to Phillip III in 1604 by James I of England. Behind them stands doña Marcela de Ulloa(6), the princess' chaperone, dressed in mourning and <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> unidentified bodyguard (or guardadamas)(7).|$|E
2500|$|These lackluster {{ratings were}} {{highlighted}} with Henry making {{jokes about the}} topic. For example, when <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> up-and-coming author in her first TV interview {{in an effort to}} reassure her he said [...] "Just imagine nobody is watching, it's perilously close to that anyway", and also when interviewing guests, occasionally thanking them for sharing their thoughts with the [...] "millions of people who watch this show", much to the amused response of his co-hosts. ABC1 program Q also poked fun at Breakfast's lack of viewers. As the panel was discussing how 1700 migrant workers had been allowed to work at Gina Rinehart's Roy Hill mining project, a tweet appeared {{on the bottom of the}} screen: [...] "You know who could use 1700 people, Channel ten Breakfast".|$|E

2500|$|Upon {{his return}} from a {{vacation}} in Europe, in early 1871, Creighton attended a lecture by art critic John Ruskin at the Sheldonian Theatre. [...] After the lecture, he noticed his friend, the future author Humphry Ward, <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> unfamiliar {{young woman who was}} wearing a yellow scarf. [...] Yellow was Creighton's favourite colour; the scarf aroused his interest enough for him to ask Ward about the woman, whose name was Louise von Glehn. [...] Soon Ward was inviting Creighton and von Glehn to a Valentine's Day lunch hosted in his rooms in Brasenose College. [...] In a few weeks, von Glenn found herself won over by Creighton's charm, and before she left Oxford {{at the end of the}} month, the two were engaged. [...] They had agreed to be married the following winter; however, as Christmas approached, it was still not certain whether Merton College would waive its requirement of celibacy for its teaching fellows. [...] On Christmas Eve, the college finally relented and elected four married fellows, one of whom was Creighton. [...] Von Glehn and Creighton were married on 8 January 1872 in her home town of Sydenham, Kent. [...] They spent a week [...] honeymooning in Paris before returning to Oxford for Creighton's new teaching term.|$|E
