Mackey and Acevada discover that Acevada’s mayoral campaign is being quietly backed by Mexican drug cartel intent on controlling Farmington though Mackey and Acevada's alliance quickly disintegrates. Mackey and Vendrell also agree {{to work together}} to start a gang war between the Armenians and the Mexicans to fight the cartel and to save Mackey’s family, though Mackey vows to Gardocki to kill Vendrell. After a botched attempt by Mackey and Gardocki to have Vendrell killed in a shoot-out between Mexican and Armenian gangs, Vendrell recruits a local criminal to make a hit on Gardocki, while Vendrell prepares to ambush and kill Mackey. The plot is exposed, and Vendrell goes on the run, along with his wife Mara and son Jackson. Dutch has problems of his own while dealing with a teenaged serial killer. Mackey tries to circumvent his forced retirement by working with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement by promising to take down a major cartel boss while Acevada also attempts to use ICE to guarantee his election. Mackey's ex-wife Corrine has learned of his many crimes and agrees to work with Dutch and Wyms to try to send him to prison. Gardocki is also implicated in the process. As part of an immunity deal engineered by ICE, Mackey admits to every crime the Strike Team has committed, beginning with his murder of Terry Crowley, and implicates Vendrell and Gardocki enough to send them to jail for life. After learning {{there is no way to}} escape prison, Vendrell poisons his pregnant wife and two-year-old son, and then commits suicide just as the police arrive. With Vendrell's death there is no longer any risk of Mackey's being sent to jail, but since Mackey already spilled everything to ICE it is now too late for Gardocki. Just when Gardocki thinks he is going to go free he is arrested by a disgusted Dutch in front of Mackey, at the Barn. Wyms reveals the <b>terminal</b> <b>status</b> of her illness to Dutch, who promises to stand by her as a friend. Desperate to escape Mackey, Corrine and the children are shown their new life in witness protection [...] Aceveda stands on the verge of being elected mayor. Meanwhile, Mackey is reassigned to a routine analysis desk job at ICE, where he is loathed by his co-workers, including Agent Olivia Murray (played by Laurie Holden) and ostracized by his fellow cops, who want nothing to do with him now that his many crimes have been exposed. The last moments of the saga depict Mackey retrieving his gun from his desk lock box and preparing to leave the ICE building, presumably following police sirens in the distance.

Despite this, student evaluations of professors are widely used in faculty promotion and tenure decisions. We exploit the random assignment of college students to professors in {{a large body of}} required coursework to examine how professor quality affects student achievement. Introductory course professors significantly affect student achievement in contemporaneous and follow-on related courses, but the effects are quite heterogeneous across subjects. Students of professors who as a group perform well in the initial mathematics course perform significantly worse in follow-on related math, science, and engineering courses. We find that the academic rank, teaching experience, and <b>terminal</b> degree <b>status</b> of mathematics and science professors are negatively correlated with contemporaneous student achievement, but positively related to follow-on course achievement. Across all subjects, student evaluations of professors are positive predictors of contemporaneous course achievement, but are poor predictors of follow-on course achievement. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Shoot {{cuttings}} were {{harvested from}} four-year-old, loblolly pine hedges in March and September of 1987, and placed {{into a series}} of factorial combinations of cutting length, diameter class, and the presence/absence of a terminal bud to assess effects on rooting and field performance. Average rooting in the March trial was 50 percent and only 20 percent for the September trial; however, the best treatment in March yielded 100 percent rooting. <b>Terminal</b> bud <b>status</b> did not appear to influence percent rooting. Shorter cuttings (5. 1 or 7. 6 cm) with an average diameter of 2 or 3 mm tended to root better and develop more roots. Field performance of the rooted cuttings through age five suggests that the original cutting does not require a terminal bud, but the best set of morphological traits differ depending on bud status. Considering both rooting ability and field growth with an original tip bud present, the best cutting dimensions were 5. 1 or 7. 6 cm long and 2 or 3 mm in diameter. Without a tip bud present, cutting dimensions were restricted to 7. 6 or 10. 2 cm long and 3 mm in diameter. Number of main roots was a weak predictor of tree height or dbh at age five...|$|R

40|$|In mobile {{telecommunications}} the network needs {{to monitor the}} <b>terminal</b> <b>status,</b> i. e., switched on, switched off, busy, idle.

However, periodic attachment requires access to the network database system, which might cause a bottleneck. In this paper the performance characteristics of periodic attachment and the induced signalling load are evaluated as influenced by the selection of the time-out period.

The model performed well in the development and validation databases (c statistics, 0. 70 and 0. 68, respectively). Risk-adjusted rates and rankings of facilities differed from unadjusted ratings. We conclude that judgments of facility performance depend on whether risk-adjusted or unadjusted decline rates are used.

40|$|LIM-domain-binding protein 1 (Ldb 1) and the LIM-Homeodomain factor (LIM-HD) Islet- 1 (Isl- 1) share {{a robust}} {{functional}} relationship in directing differentiation of developmental progenitor populations. However, their mechanistic role in terminally differentiated cells is uncharacterized. In the developing endocrine pancreas, conditional ablation of either Isl- 1 in the pancreatic epithelium or Ldb 1 in the Pax 6 + pancreatic endocrine progenitors suspended pancreatic endocrine differentiation. In {{light of their}} functional requirement in the developing endocrine pancreas, both factors remain ubiquitously enriched in the distinct, terminally differentiated endocrine cell-types that comprise the adult endocrine pancreas. To determine the requirement for Ldb 1 and Isl- 1 in the mature pancreatic β-cell, I combined physiological characterization of inducible, β-cell-specific loss-of-function mice with high-throughput cistromic and transcriptomic analyses. Ldb 1 and Isl- 1 were required for maintaining the glucose homeostatic role of the mature β-cell {{as well as the}} terminally differentiated status of the β-cell. Consistent with the established mechanistic relationship between Ldb 1 and Isl- 1 in progenitor populations, Ldb 1 and Isl- 1 were co-enriched throughout the β-cell genome. Comparison of our islet- and insulinoma-based cistromic data sets with the glucagonoma Isl- 1 cistrome revealed differential enrichment of Isl- 1 between the immortalized murine α- and β-cell lines; this differential enrichment may underlie the distinct terminal identities of α- and β-cells. Contextualized through the broader role of Ldb 1 -mediated complexes in directing cell fate decisions, my findings in the mature β-cell indicate that Ldb 1 -mediated complexes are likely responsible for directing and maintaining the <b>terminal</b> differentiation <b>status</b> of all pancreatic endocrine cell types. ...|$|R
40|$|In mobile {{telecommunications}} the network should monitor the <b>terminal</b> <b>status,</b> i. e., switched on, switched off, busy. Once a mobile terminal is switched on, it automatically informs the network about its status (attachment action). However, regarding {{the way that}} the network can identify that a terminal is switched off (detachment), there are three alternatives: (a) Periodic detachment scenario. The terminal (when switched on) periodically informs the network about its state. If the network detects that there is no contact with the terminal for more than the agreed time period, it detaches the terminal, (b) Detach on unsuccessful paging. At the instance of a call terminating to a mobile terminal and after a number of unanswered paging messages, the terminal is detached. (c) Detachment action scenario. The moment that the mobile terminal is switched off, it informs the network about its status. Scenarios (a) and (c) claim that paging signaling savings can be achieved when the network is early informed that a mobile terminal is switched off. However, these scenarios require access to the network database, which {{is expected to be a}} bottleneck. On the other hand, scenario (b) requires no access to the database but does not guarantee paging signaling savings. In this paper we model the behavior of a terminal so as to compare the above scenarios in terms of performance.

This new era of prices brings with it new challenges within agriculture for farmers and grain buyers within agriculture. This research explores the basis values of hard red winter wheat in Kansas and the elevator characteristics that provide a competitive advantage for elevators buying wheat in Kansas. This research explores hard red winter wheat basis values from elevators located around Kansas from 2002 to 2013. Two hundred twenty eight locations from around Kansas {{were used in the}} research. These locations provided the price data that was used for this research.

Five elevator characteristics were researched that may {{have a significant impact on}} an elevators basis. These characteristics are thought to provide a competitive advantage to the location in the form of stronger or narrower basis bids to the farmer, giving the farmer a higher price for his grain.

40|$|Initially rent asunder by the {{fortunes}} of the Second World War, the division of North and South Korea into two separate countries was solidified by the Korean War. North of the 38 th parallel, the Democratic People 2 ̆ 7 s Republic of Korea (2 ̆ 2 DPRK 2 ̆ 2) became a totalitarian dictatorship based on a command economy. South of the 38 th parallel, the Republic of Korea evolved into a liberal democracy with a market economy. For much of the last fifty years, these arrangements seemedto be almost as unchangeable and enduring as the Cold War itself. Yet, the disintegration of the Soviet Union, and the subsequent elimination of the rivalry between East and West, strongly suggest that the survival of the communist regime in the North can no longer be taken for granted. Similarly, just as the collapse of communism in East Germany was a necessary condition for the reunification of the two Germanys, the demise of communism in North Korea must now be considered a prerequisite for the reunification of the Korean peninsula.

40|$|Long-term catheterisation, {{such as in}} {{spinal cord}} injured patients, {{increases}} the risk of urinary tract infection (UTI). Urine culture, the standard UTI diagnostic test, limits the scope of detectable microorganisms, whereas molecular methods allow for the identification of culturable and unculturable microorganisms. This study followed a cohort of patients enrolled in a probiotic clinical trial to determine how the urinary tract microflora changed as a function of probiotic treatment and UTI <b>status.</b> <b>Terminal</b> Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (T-RFLP) and next-generation sequencing revealed that urinary catheter biofilms were diverse and differed significantly between individuals. For a given subject, the types and relative abundances of taxa within the microbiome were altered as a result of ingesting probiotics, with significant changes in community composition pre and post probiotic therapy. The onset of symptomatic UTI was also associated with significant fluctuations in the microbial community. Disturbances in the flora associated with probiotic therapy and infection were evident when examining a single individual across time, but less clear in a cohort of individuals. Likewise, grouping patients by UTI history did not reveal distinctions between those with recurrent symptomatic infection as opposed to the asymptomatic. High inter-patient variability may make patterns in the flora difficult to detect when examining multiple subjects. For a given patient, T-RFLP and sequencing generated similar patterns in community composition. However, dominant organisms isolated by urine culture did not match those identified by sequencing urinary catheter flora. Urine cultures revealed a narrower range of organisms, and at times no bacterial growth compared to corresponding sequence data from catheters. This suggests that T-RFLP and sequencing of biofilm dwelling bacteria should be incorporated into methods of investigating urinary tract infection. Longitudinal examination of the individual over time may {{be the best way to}} monitor changes in urinary tract flora. T-RFLP is a relatively cheap and rapid technique that can be used to examine changes to the patient's urinary tract flora, which may predict infection and can be used as a diagnostic tool for UTI management...|$|R
40|$|Tourism {{destination}} market is competitive {{due to the}} increase {{of the number of}} world-wide international arrivals and more holiday destination players. Maintaining repeated tourist numbers is as important as attracting potential first-timers. Previous research has suggested {{that the majority of the}} destination loyalty research follows the framework of general brand loyalty theories. These studies tend to be positivist employing quantitative research designs. Moreover, they focus on causal analyses amongst image, satisfaction and revisit intention, which perceive loyalty as an ultimate goal. However, the current study identifies that the conceptual definition of loyalty conflicts with the constructs of loyalty. Additionally, the study aims to explain the dynamic rotation of actual revisits and place endearment by integrating theories of place attachment, existential authenticity and development of destination loyalty. The current study employs interpretivism as research philosophy and interpretive as paradigm. It obtained data from focus groups and semi-structured interviews under the exploratory-purposed research design. The data is then analysed by means of the thematic analysis technique. Focus groups serve as the preliminary study; they allow examination of destination loyalty from real practices. Interviews generate information to fulfil the research aims by explaining the formation and development of destination loyalty with the integration of the theories of place attachment and existential authenticity. The current results indicate that intention is hardly actuality and tourists are behaviourally loyal to multiple holiday destinations. Destination features fulfil tourists’ physiological needs and bring satisfaction and excitement. However, they do not deepen tourists’ attachment to the holiday destination. They are longer residence experience, local involvement, and memory which make tourists feel the destination like home to them. They are taken in as members of the local community. In addition, travel experiences are self-learning process and tourists dialogue with themselves during their journeys and then they were promoted knowledgably and spiritually. Tourists gain sense of belongingness and self-actualisation from holiday experiences. This study suggests that destination loyalty is a dynamic process rather than a <b>terminal</b> <b>status</b> of behavioural consumption. With the integration of self-realisation, destination loyalty can be seen to be more than habitual and occasional revisits and fulfilments and satisfaction of physiological needs. This study unhooks the causal analyses on attributes; instead, it proposes a new perspective of explaining the development and enhancement of destination loyalty. The results can be beneficial for destination management and marketing research. Maintaining and branding are just the initial process. A tourist destination must utilise its characteristics to create more irreplaceable experiences for tourists, which enable tourists to build up profound emotional associations with the place.

40|$|Objetivo: determinar si la oportunidad y calidad de atención en pacientes con {{diabetes}} mellitus tipo 2 en el sistema de salud, incide en prevalencia e incidencia de enfermedad renal terminal y eventos de terapia dialítica en etapas tempranas. Diseño: estudio retrospectivo - descripción serie de casos Marco de referencia: hoy no existe evidencia certera de lo sucedido con la aplicación de normas y modelos de atención de EPS y ARS y hospitales públicos, en relación con enfermedades crónicas y degenerativas, como {{diabetes mellitus}} (DM). La tasa de crecimiento de pacientes en terapia dia­lítica por enfermedad renal crónica, alcanzó 15 % anual en la última década. La principal causa es la diabetes mellitus. Es crucial detectar tempranamente a pacientes con nefropatía y optimizar el tratamiento para retardar la progresión a falla renal, prever consecuencias y disminuir mortalidad cardiovascular asociada. Se plantea entonces un estudio que mediante análisis de datos existentes determine factores que han incidido en progresión de enfermedad renal crónica hacia estadio terminal en pacientes con DM. Participantes: pacientes renales con diagnóstico de diabetes mellitus tipo 2 que ingresaron entre 2002 y 2004, a clínicas renales; > 40 años y Objective: assessing if {{the opportunity and}} quality of care in patients with type II Diabetes Mellitus in the Health System has some influence in the prevalence and incidence of Terminal Renal Disease and in the events of dialysis therapy at early stages. Design: retrospective study - description of case series. Reference framework: today {{there is no evidence}} of what happens with the use of care standards and models of the "EPS" and "ARS" and Public Hospitals, in relationship with chronic and degenerative diseases, such as diabetes mellitus (DM). The growth rate of patients on dialysis therapy due to chronic renal disease reached 15 % a year in the last decade. The main cause is diabetes mellitus. It is of crucial importance to detect early on patients with nephropathies and optimize the treatment to delay progression of renal failure, foresee the consequences and decrease associated cardiovascular mortality. We are planning on a study that by means of the analysis of the different existing data, determines the factors that have had an incidence in the progression of chronic renal disease leading to <b>terminal</b> <b>status</b> in patients with DM. Participants: renal patients with diagnosis of type II DM that were admitted between 2002 and 2004 to renal clinics; > 40 years old and < 65 years, affiliated to an EPS or ARS, or taken care of by supply. Interventions: characterization of the care that the insurance companies provide to patients with Type II DM by means of collection information through surveys and records revision; description and comparison of ERC incidence in diabetic patients affiliated to insurance companies, and the relationship with appropriate and on time care in the early stages of the disease. Measurements: patient’s characteristics and care received before joining the dialysis therapy, participation in a DM program and access to the required services. Analysis of frequency of the variables; and comparison among the different regimes. New codification of variables according relevant criteria and implementation of the values scale according to positive results, in 17 of them, to explain the quality of care in each regime. Results: there is evidence of serious deficiencies in the quality and integrality of care of diabetic patients that were admitted in the dialysis therapy, with results that are matter of concern in all the variables that were analyzed and that were related to therapeutic activities considered to be indispensable in the international literature, for an adequate treatment. The time between the diagnosis of DM and the development of CRI is no more than 13 years. The literature says that the time before initial renal failure is between 20 and 30 years. Dialysis treatment starts only 0. 5 years after the diagnosis of renal disease is made and one could assume that this is a late diagnosis and that patients only have access to diagnosis when the deterioration and renal damage are irreversible and rapidly progressive. Conclusions and recommendations: given that this is a descriptive study, it provides information for stating a hypothesis: • There is a direct relationship between the affiliation regime and the quality of care that diabetic patients receive. • The diagnosis CRI in diabetic patients is made very late and the time that it takes to dialysis is very short. • The quality of care of the diabetic patient admitted to dialysis is different than that provided to those that do not require dialysis. • The programs for managing diabetes are weak and do not count on the elements to guarantee good results. • Diabetic patients are not sent to the nephrologists on a regular basis. Multiple studies have demonstrated that an appropriate control of diabetes and early diagnosis of alterations in glomerular filtration lead to take the necessary kidney protecting measures that delay or eliminate the progress of terminal renal disease. This is to call upon de attention of the Health General Social Security System Management, responsible of facing diabetes as a public health issue, taking into account a progressively more urban, sedentary and aging population, and the increased rate of CRI, as a consequence of not having integral and quality care for diabetic patients, with adverse results for the quality of life of the people and for the systems in terms of costs...|$|E
