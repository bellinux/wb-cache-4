5|$|The {{hypothesis}} of mitochondrial binary fission {{has relied on}} the visualization by fluorescence microscopy and conventional transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The resolution of fluorescence microscopy(~200nm) is insufficient <b>to</b> <b>distinguish</b> structural details, such as double mitochondrial membrane in mitochondrial division or even <b>to</b> <b>distinguish</b> individual mitochondria when several are close together. Conventional TEM has also some technical limitations in verifying mitochondrial division. Cryo-electron tomography was recently used to visualize mitochondrial division in frozen hydrated intact cells. It revealed that mitochondria divide by budding.|$|E

5|$|In certain regions, {{presence}} or absence of certain scales may be a quick way <b>to</b> <b>distinguish</b> non-venomous and venomous snakes, but used with care and knowledge of exceptions. For example, in Myanmar, the {{presence or}} absence of loreal scales can be used <b>to</b> <b>distinguish</b> between relatively harmless Colubrids and lethally venomous Elapids. The rule of hand for this region is that the absence of a loreal scale between the nasal scale and pre-ocular scale indicates that the snake is an Elapid and hence lethal. This rule-of-thumb cannot be used without care as it cannot be applied to vipers, which have a large number of small scales on the head. A careful check would also be needed to exclude known poisonous members of the Colubrid family such as Rhabdophis.|$|E
