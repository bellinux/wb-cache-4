The biofuel blend included components derived from algae and jatropha plants. The algae oil was provided by Sapphire Energy, and the jatropha oil by Terasol Energy.|$|E
5|$|In May 2003, the government's {{attempt to}} legislate Article 23 (National Security) of the Basic Law aroused strong {{suspicion}} among Hong Kong citizens. This Article would grant Hong Kong's police force {{right of access}} to private property on grounds of 'safeguarding national security', but without court warrants. Coupled with years of economic hardships and discontent of Tung's pro-Beijing stance, a mass demonstration broke out on 1 July 2003. <b>This</b> <b>demonstration</b> hastened the resignations of two government ministers and, eventually, that of Tung on 10 March 2005.|$|E
5|$|After <b>this</b> <b>demonstration</b> of power, AJ is {{promoted}} by his manager. A montage of AJ being promoted for doing absurd tasks follows. Soon, AJ {{is promoted}} to a rank {{with a private}} office. Danny and Morgan refuse to work for AJ further, finding him corrupt with power. AJ throws them out, and afterward he is promoted to CEO by a former officer—a decrepit man within a robotic business suit. AJ floats {{to the top of}} the suit, from which he spots a beach ball-destroying machine to the side. He hallucinates the beach balls as the heads of Morgan and Danny, who say that he has destroyed the spirit of summer. Realizing his mistake, AJ rejects the promotion. He returns to his friends outside, and together they plan the rest of their summer.|$|E

Finmeccanica says NATO is considering the system as a short- to mid-term solution for air-to-surface identification of friendly forces and thus avoid collateral damages due to friendly fire during close air support operations.|$|E

[...] No distinction seems to have been drawn in the criticism trumpeted in these demonstrations as Tariq Ramadan (see above) implies. [...] Some protests reflected a level of hysteria quite out of proportion to the text of the Pope's lecture. [...] Security was discreetly stepped up around and inside the Vatican City, because of concerns about the possibility of acts of violence. Thousands of people took part in many protests.|$|R

25|$|In 2003, the Vienna {{group also}} {{demonstrated}} the wave nature of tetraphenylporphyrin—a flat biodye with {{an extension of}} about 2nm and a mass of 614u.

In the same interferometer they also found interference fringes for C60F48., a fluorinated buckyball with a mass of about 1600 u, composed of 108 atoms. Large molecules are already so complex that they give experimental access to {{some aspects of the}} quantum-classical interface, i.e., to certain decoherence mechanisms. In 2011, the interference of molecules as heavy as 6910u could be demonstrated in a Kapitza–Dirac–Talbot–Lau interferometer.
