25|$|Many {{participants}} in BMX racing {{have left their}} mark. Most are pure racers while some promoted and sponsored races; others have created unique maneuvers and invented or helped design equipment as well have raced themselves. They have done it over the near 40-year history of the sport during distinct eras. <b>These</b> <b>are</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> few.|$|E
25|$|In contrast, {{members of}} the free {{software}} community maintain the vision that all software {{is a part of}} freedom of speech and that proprietary software is unethical and unjust. The free software movement openly champions this belief through talks that denounce proprietary software. As a whole the community refuses to support proprietary software. Further there are external motivations for these developers. One motivation is that, when a programmer fixes a bug or makes a program it benefits others in an open source environment. Another motivation is that a programmer can work on multiple projects that they find interesting and enjoyable. Programming in the open source world can also lead to commercial job offers or entrance into the venture capital community. <b>These</b> <b>are</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> few reasons why open source programmers continue to create and advance software.|$|E

500|$|Animals {{can also}} appear {{coloured}} due to structural colour, {{the result of}} coherent scattering perceived as iridescence. The structures themselves are colourless. [...] Light typically passes through multiple layers and is reflected more than once. The multiple reflections compound one another and intensify the colours. [...] Structural colour differs according to the observer's position whereas pigments appear the same regardless of the angle-of-view. Animals that show iridescence include mother of pearl seashells, fish, and peacocks. [...] <b>These</b> <b>are</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> few examples of animals with this quality, but it is most pronounced in the butterfly family.|$|E

Halimah Yacob, the Minister of State for the Ministry of Social and Family Development, said in the forum that a concern with income inequality is its impact on social mobility, as people need to have “a sense of hope and optimism that they can aspire to a better life”.

This article traces the emergence of perspectivism in the Australian curriculum context, especially as it relates to the study of Geography in schools.

5000|$|There were {{moves to}} set up a more joined up {{intelligence}} network, based on the police's National Intelligence Model, whose intention was to ensure [...] " [...] that information is fully researched, developed and analysed to provide intelligence which enables senior managers to provide strategic direction, make tactical resourcing decisions about operational matters and manage risk". It was planned to expand the use of fingerprinting and, for enforcement, there was a major change of direction with ambitious plans to train immigration officers to make use of their powers of arrest, give them more powers of search and make them less reliant on police resources. <b>These</b> <b>were</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> few items on a lengthy programme of changes, backed up by substantial promises of money and legislative time in Parliament. The document was a serious statement of intent and bore the hallmarks of a small organisation evolving into a larger and very much more professional organisation but, at its heart, was a central IT project that was intended to be the hub of all the administration of casework within the Croydon HQ.|$|R

25|$|Asha's {{sibling rivalry}} with Lata Mangeshkar is often talked about, {{in spite of}} their insistence that <b>these</b> <b>are</b> <b>just</b> tales. <b>As</b> young children, they were very close.

5000|$|Officials {{from both}} sides endeavoured {{to find ways to}} make the English and the French view each other more favourably. [...] The British Ambassador, Sir Eric Phipps, asked the Minister of Information (MOI) to provide the French press with details of the arrival of British forces to prove that Britain was {{resolved}} to contribute fully to the war effort. However, it created tensions with the War Office, which imposed censorship. As a result, nothing could be revealed about the British Army and the Royal Air Force in France. That led to absurd situations, as when an American correspondent asked for the text of a leaflet dropped by the Royal Air Force over Germany. The request was refused by the censors on the grounds that 'they were not allowed to disclose information which might be of value to the enemy'! In October 1939, the disparity in troop numbers became a cause for concern in France, which had mobilised 3.5 million men; yet a mere 158,000 British troops had been sent across the English Channel. The Ambassador reported to London and hoped that Britain would declare emphatically that <b>these</b> <b>were</b> <b>just</b> <b>an</b> advance guard and that reinforcements were being swiftly despatched.|$|R
