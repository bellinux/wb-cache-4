5|$|Hurricane Vince was {{an unusual}} {{hurricane}} that developed in the northeastern Atlantic basin.

5|$|A 2001 {{report by}} Newell et al. at Southampton University {{undertaken}} for Studio Sound in 2001 {{found that the}} NS-10 had excellent time-domain response at low frequencies – its ability to start and stop in response to signal input {{was found to be}} superior to that of most other nearfield monitors.

5|$|Another {{project of}} the Laboratory for Nuclear Science was a {{synchrotron}} particle accelerator, {{which was designed to}} accelerate electrons to an energy of 350MeV. The accelerator was funded by the Office of Naval Research and built under the supervision of Ivan A. Getting, who was a professor of electrical engineering and had worked at the Radiation Laboratory on <b>the</b> <b>extremely</b> successful SCR‑584 radar. Although its construction began in 1946, the accelerator had not begun to work by 1949. In response, Zacharias asked Sands to assist. This was Sands's introduction to accelerator physics, and with his help the machine became operational early in 1950.|$|E
5|$|Arafat's long {{personal}} and political survival was taken by most Western commentators {{as a sign of}} his mastery of asymmetric warfare and his skill as a tactician, given <b>the</b> <b>extremely</b> dangerous nature of politics of the Middle East and the frequency of assassinations. Some commentators believe his survival was largely due to Israel's fear that he could become a martyr for the Palestinian cause if he were assassinated or even arrested by Israel. Others believe that Israel refrained from taking action against Arafat because it feared Arafat less than Hamas and the other Islamist movements gaining support over Fatah. The complex and fragile web of relations between the US, Israel, Saudi Arabia, and other Arab states contributed also to Arafat's longevity {{as the leader of the}} Palestinians.|$|E

5|$|At {{the same}} time as these keeps were being built by <b>the</b> <b>extremely</b> wealthy, much smaller, keep-like {{structures}} called tower houses or peel towers were built across Ireland, Scotland, and northern England, often by relatively poorer local lords and landowners. It was originally argued that Irish tower houses were based on the Scottish design, but the pattern of development of such castles in Ireland does not support this hypothesis. A tower house would typically be a tall, square, stone-built, crenelated building; Scottish and Ulster tower houses were often also surrounded by a barmkyn or bawn wall. Most academics have concluded that tower houses should not be classified as keeps but rather as a form of fortified house.|$|E
5|$|Between 24 and 25° degrees {{southern}} latitude the Andean Dry Diagonal crosses the Andes. At this latitude, {{half of the}} precipitation falls in summer {{and the other half}} in winter. The formation of this dry diagonal is an effect both of the rainshadow effect of the Andes, air subsidence within South Pacific High, and the cold Humboldt Current off the Pacific coast. This is the reason why the Atacama Desert exists. <b>The</b> <b>extremely</b> arid climate at Llullaillaco is also a consequence of these climatic effects.|$|E
5|$|Caprioli's {{memorial}} {{was broken}} {{up in the}} nineteenth century, so only the Caprioli Adoration remains. A masterpiece of Cairano's, this was placed in 1841 by Rodolfo Vantini on the high altar of the St Francis of Assisi church. Cairano demonstrates a high technical mastery, not only in <b>the</b> <b>extremely</b> precise orientation of the boxes, {{but also in the}} choice of the monolithic block, which, in fact, is not strictly necessary for this kind of work. From Bernardino Faino and Francesco Paglia and other seventeenth and eighteenth century scholars, we know that the relief was placed by some architectural system. It {{was supposed to be a}} figurative piece, created perhaps by the same artist, but which has not been traced.|$|E
