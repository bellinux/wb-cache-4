40|$|Shrub legumes {{have been}} well {{established}} in Indonesia and some of which contain significant levels of tannin. Several methods of <b>tannin</b> <b>analysis</b> have been conducted and correlated with its biological property of tannin. Total phenolics and total tannin measured by Folin Ciocalteau have a high correlation with the biological assay of tannin using gas in vitro method. Tannin values measured by the above methods negatively correlated with protein digestibility. Several feeding experiments on tannin containing shrub legumes using Calliandra calothyrsus as a model plant have been conducted. Feeding in fresh condition or silage form {{is the best way}} of feeding tannin containing forages. Several methods were tested to deactivate tannin include PEG addition, soaking in water or alkaline solution. Starch addition is one of the alternatives to mask the effect of tannin as it improved the performance of sheep fed tannin-containing legumes. Cofeeding with other leguminous leaves is another technique to utilize tannin in shrub legumes as protein binding agent. Several experiments showed that tannin could reduce the worm burden in ruminant although its utilization as anthelminthic agent in Indonesia is still limited. In conclusion, tannin containing shrub legumes have several beneficial effects to improve small ruminant production. ...|$|E

Several small plant tannins have been considered: epigallocatechin-gallate (EGCG) from green tea {{and a set of}} oligomeric tannins from apples.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 1999 Polyphenolic tannin {{comprises}} {{a significant}} proportion of the leaves, needles, and barks of vascular plant tissues [...] -all major contributors to terrigenous organic matter cycling in aquatic systems. However, virtually nothing is known at the molecular level about tannin diagenesis despite the increased sensitivity and unambiguity of molecular characterizations vs. bulk techniques. Due to the analytical challenges in measuring tannin molecularly, there has been little crossover to ecology from the large body of research in natural products. This thesis presents {{the development of a new}} method for molecular-level condensed <b>tannin</b> <b>analysis,</b> a survey of source tissues, and a geochemical application focussed on mangrove leaf diagenesis in a tropical estuary. The developed method consists of acid hydrolysis (HCl) of samples in acetone, water, and phloroglucinol as a nucleophile for carbocation capture. Analytes are partitioned into ethyl acetate, dried, trimethylsilyl derivatized, and quantified by gas chromatography. The method reproducibly yields intact terminal units and phloroglucinol-adducted extender units, in addition to flavones, flavanones, triterpenoids, and carboxylic acids. Molecular tannin signatures were obtained from 117 source tissues, including leaves, needles, woods, and barks from tropical and temperate forests, coasts, and grasslands. Conifer needles were distinguished by high prodelphinidin content while dicotyledon leaves alone yielded both triterpenoids and flavones. Barks were distinguished by flavanones and tetracosanoic acid. Molecular tannin in a degradation sequence of mangrove leaves (Rhizophora mangle) revealed several important trends not evident by bulk techniques. Degree of polymerization (average chain length) highlighted early leaching processes and a subsequent shift toward abiotic or microbially-mediated chemical reactions. An increased degree of hydroxylation corresponded to increased degradation rate, a trend that may be indicative of changes in redox or pH conditions leading to quinone formation. The apparent inverse correlation between basic amino acids and molecular tannin might signal Schiff base reactions partially responsible for nitrogen immobilization. Measured molecular tannin was second in abundance only to carbohydrates in the senescent yellow leaves entering the estuarine system.

40|$|Graduation date: 1953 Presentation date: 1952 - 12 - 05 The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was to determine the nature of the extractives from red alder bark in an effort to discover the materials which cause the red stain in red alder wood. Samples of bark and wood were obtained and successively extracted with hexane, benzene, ether, ethanol, and hot water. The total extractive, content of the bark was 24. 01 percent, while that of the wood was 8. 60 percent. The hexane extract amounted to three percent of the dry weight of the bark. Sixty percent of this extract was a saponifiable fatty acid mixture with a neutral equivalent of 290 and a Hanus iodine number of 80. 3. Linoleic acid was shown to be present in this mixture. Saponified alcohols and other neutral materials composed 29. 1 percent of the hexane extract, and contained a phytosterol, the triterpene alcohol alnulin, and the triterpene ketone protalnulin. The ether extract amounted to. 8 percent of the bark. The unsaponifiable materials amounted to 23 percent of the extract and contained the same compounds present in this fraction of the hexane extract. The yield of alcohol soluble material was nine percent of the dry bark. A water insoluble phlobaphene composed 11. 7 percent of the alcohol extract. Paper partition chromatography showed that the remaining 88. 3 percent of the alcohol extract contained four materials. A standard <b>tannin</b> <b>analysis</b> with hide powder indicated that 28. 7 percent of the alcohol extract was a water soluble tannin fraction. Part of this tannin was obtained from the water solution of the alcohol extract by salting out with sodium chloride. It was shown to be a phlobatannin with a catechol nucleus. A reducing sugar analysis showed that 32. 7 percent of the alcohol extract was free sugars. Chromatography showed these sugars to be glucose and xylose. The remaining 26. 9 percent of the alcohol extract was found to be a phenolic xyloside with properties quite {{similar to those of the}} tannin fraction. This xyloside was best isolated by extracting the bark with ethyl acetate, pouring the extract into hexane, dissolving the precipitate in warm water, and adding lead acetate. The lead salts of the xyloside were then suspended in methanol and decomposed with hydrogen sulfide. Evaporating the filtered methanol solution to dryness left the xyloside as a light orange solid. It gave a green color with ferric chloride, a red precipitate when heated with acid, and an intense red color in a basic solution. Its methoxyl content was 3. 66 percent. About one-third of the xyloside was removed by acid hydrolysis and shown to be xylose. The infra-red absorption spectras of the phlobaphene, tannin, and xyloside were quite similar. The hot water extract was two percent of the dry bark. It contained an alcohol insoluble tannin-carbohydrate material. A crude carbohydrate fraction was isolated by treating the extract with hide powder, concentrating it to a small volume, and pouring it into a large volume of alcohol. The resultant reddish powder gave a maximum reducing sugar value of 54 percent after a six hour hydrolysis period. Chromatographic analysis showed the presence of glucose, arabinose and a trace of xylose. A pentosan determination showed the presence of 16. 93 pentosans. The materials present in the extractives from the bark of red alder which may cause the red stain in the wood are the tannin-like xyloside and the tannin fraction...|$|E
40|$|Commercial sorghum {{samples from}} the USA that had been graded as {{containing}} more than 3 % tannin sorghum were obtained for analysis. The samples included a red and a white pericarp sorghum. The kernels were subjected to a Clorox bleach test to determine the presence of tannin sorghum. Kernels that appeared dark were selected, sectioned and viewed using light microscopy {{to determine if a}} pigmented testa was present. Half kernels of normal and weathered/damaged representing false positive grains for tannin were viewed using scanning electron microscopy. It was shown that there was no testa in the suspected false positive samples. The weathered/damaged kernels in the bleached samples appeared dark but the darkness intensity was significantly less than in those with pigmented testas. The bleached white damaged kernels were less dark than damaged kernels from red sorghum. The damaged white and red sorghum had only trace levels of catechins, indicating that they did not contain condensed <b>tannins.</b> Total phenol <b>analysis</b> showed that the weathered kernels had significantly higher levels of phenols compared to normal kernels. The false positive results in the bleach test were mainly due to pigments that leached inside the endosperm and could not be removed by the bleaching procedure...|$|R
40|$|International audienceTropical {{rain forests}} {{generally}} have a complex structure {{and a high}} diversity of species in their canopy, but in some rain forests the upper canopy is dominated by a single species. The factors controlling this dominance are uncertain. In New Caledonia, Nothofagus species dominate the upper canopy of some rain forests on ultramafic soils. Here we investigate whether leaf-level nutrient-use efficiency (NUE) could explain dominance by Nothofagus. We {{found no evidence of}} a competitive advantage in Nothofagus in terms of leaf-level NUE: Nothofagus species did not have lower leaf macronutrient concentrations, nor did they resorb more nutrients than co-occurring species on average. They did, however, have lower foliar Ni concentrations on average. Leaf decay rate across all species in a glasshouse-based trial correlated positively with foliar P and negatively with cell wall content, lignin:P, C:P, lignin:N, leaf toughness and <b>tannin</b> activity. Multivariate <b>analysis</b> suggested that total cell wall concentration exerted the strongest independent effect on variation among species in decomposition rate. Slow decomposition of Nothofagus leaf litter may facilitate continued dominance of the upper canopy by suppressing establishment and growth of co-occurring species or by promoting disturbance through fire, since disturbance has been suggested as necessary for regeneration and maintenance of dominance by Nothofagus species. However, the biological mechanisms allowing Nothofagus to achieve initial dominance of these post-disturbance forests are uncertain, and may still include plant-level NUE...|$|R

A {{comparison}} of two strategies {{to modify the}} hydroxylation of condensed tannin polymers in Lotus corniculatus L. ? Phytochemistry, 66 (9), 991 - 999. Sponsorship: BBSRC; BBSRC-PMB 2 initiative; European Union Grant FAIR CT 98 - 4068 (Compounds And Genes for Enhanced protein assimilation and Digestibility of forage legumes) A full-length sense Antirrhinum majus dihydroflavonol reductase (DFR) sequence was introduced into birdsfoot trefoil (Lotus corniculatus L.) in experiments aimed at modifying condensed tannin content and polymer hydroxylation in a predictable manner. Analysis of transgenic plants indicated lines that showed enhanced tannin content in leaf and stem tissues. In contrast to previous data from root cultures, levels of propelargonidin units were not markedly elevated in lines with enhanced <b>tannin</b> content. RT-PCR <b>analysis</b> of four selected lines indicated a correlation between enhanced tannin content and expression of the introduced DFR transgene. Using a contrasting approach we introduced a flavonoid 3 ? 5 ? hydroxylase (F 3 ? 5 ?H) sequence derived from Eustoma grandiflorum into Lotus root cultures. Expression of the transgene was associated with increased levels of condensed tannins {{and in this case}} there was also no alteration in polymer hydroxylation. These results suggest that additional mechanisms may exist that control the hydroxylation state of condensed tannins in this model species. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Tannins are {{characterized}} by protein-binding affinity. They have astringent/bitter properties that act as deterrents, affecting diet selection. Two groups of salivary proteins, proline-rich proteins and histatins, are effective precipitators of tannin, decreasing levels of available tannins. The possibility of other salivary proteins having a co-adjuvant role on host defense mechanisms against tannins is unknown. In this work, we characterized and compared the protein profile of mice whole saliva from animals fed on three experimental diets: tannin-free diet, diet with the incorporation of 5 % hydrolyzable tannins (tannic acid), or diet with 5 % condensed <b>tannins</b> (quebracho). Protein <b>analysis</b> was performed by one-dimensional gel electrophoresis combined with Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization-Time of Flight mass spectrometry to allow the dynamic study of interactions between diet and saliva. Since abundant salivary proteins obscure the purification and identification of medium and low expressed salivary proteins, we used centrifugation to obtain saliva samples free from proteins that precipitate after tannin binding. Data from Peptide Mass Fingerprinting allowed us to identify ten different proteins, some of them showing more than one isoform. Tannin-enriched diets were observed to change the salivary protein profile. One isoform of Î±-amylase was overexpressed with both types of tannins. Aldehyde reductase was only identified in saliva of the quebracho group. Additionally, a hypertrophy of parotid salivary gland acini was observed by histology, along with a decrease in body mass in the first 4 days of the experimental period...|$|R
40|$|The use of plant-derived {{products}} in postharvest disease management {{may be a}} valid alternative to conventional chemical treatments (Pane et al., 2016). Unfavorable environmental conditions (such as salt and drought) increase production and accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Consequently, extremophile plants have developed adaptive responses including the synthesis of specific bioactive molecules used for medical and nutritional purposes (Ksouri et al., 2012). In that context, the main objective {{of the present study}} was the identification of effective plant extracts and essential oils from extremophile plants against the most important plant pathogens in Europe (in term of loss, treatment necessity and/or cost). The study began with the selection of four endemic medicinal species suspected to be antimicrobial due to their wealth of phenolic and terpene compounds, such as flavonoids, phenolic acids, and coumarins (Ksouri et al., 2012). Each of the aerial plant materials was grounded and macerated with solvent (methanol or chloroform) for 24 h. The solvent was then eliminated along rotavapor. The yield of plant extract varied between 1. 56 and 6. 7 %. Kinetics of growth of the 3 pathogens cultivable in liquid medium was determined before testing the impact of plant extracts and essential oils. Methanolic and chloroform plant extracts (EM 1, EM 2, EC 1 and EC 2) and essential oils (EO 1, EO 2) were compared for their antifungal potential. The chemical composition of the essential oils obtained by hydrodistillation from the aerial parts was analyzed by GC/MS. Yield of essential oil varied between 0. 7 and 1. 2 %. Therefore, antifungal activity of plant extracts and essential oils was evaluated using ELISA microplates with a blocked randomized design, as described previously (Parisi et al., 2013). The results obtained showed that EM 2 at 7 mg/ml has a very high fungistatic activity against Fusarium culmorum, F. oxysporum and Penicillium italicum. It was characterized with a high amount of polyphenols, flavonoids and condensed <b>tannins.</b> Statistical <b>analysis</b> showed that the efficiency of methanol extracts significantly differed from those of the chloroform extracts. In addition, essential oils significantly reduced spores germination in a dose-dependent manner. Their fungistatic activity reached 100 % at 6000 ppm. In conclusion, this work allowed us to open new perspectives on the application of extremophile plant extracts as novel biocontrol strategy against plant pathogens. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|A {{total of}} 10 Sorghum cultivar: two lines (CMSXS 114, T) and (CMSXS 165, WT), six hybrids (9953101,T; 9953130,T; BR 601, WT; BR 701, T; BR 700, T; and AG 2005, WT and two {{varieties}} (BR 501, WT; and BR 506, WT) with 8 replications were ensiled in PVC silos of 3 kg per silo for 60 {{days and then}} analyzed for condensed <b>tannins</b> (CT) (colorimetric <b>analysis</b> by the butanol-HCl method), CP, NDF, ADF, and in vitro (IVDMD- 24 and 48 hs) digestibilities. Condensed tannins (CT) from quebracho were purified using affinity chromatography with sephadex LH- 20 and used as a standard. Low concentrations of CT have been defined as 10 g kg- 1 DM or less and medium as 10 to 40 g kg- 1 DM, and levels exceeding 40 g kg- 1 DM as high. Hybrid 9953130 had the highest concentration of CT among the sorghum silages (P 0. 09). The highest CP content was noted for line CMSXS 165 (97. 4 gkg- 1; P < 0. 05). Concentrations of CP in CMSXS 114 (83. 2 g kg- 1), BR 700 (76. 4 g kg- 1), BR 701 (80. 5 g kg- 1), and AG 2005 (79. 2 g kg- 1) were above the overall mean (74. 0 g kg- 1). The in vitro digestibilities (24 and 48 hours) of the two isogenics lines CMSXS 114 (T) and CMSXS 165 (WT) were not different. We concluded that the CT level did not affect digestibility; however, relative CT concentrations were low. Therefore, we could not suggest significant effects of CT content on DM intake, digestibility levels or performance in cattle fed {{with any of these}} sorghum silages. 200...|$|R
40|$|Introduction Using agro-industrial {{by-products}} in ruminants feeding {{could help}} in semi arid climate condition throughout the year. Raisin by-product {{is produced in}} huge magnitude in Malayer city, Hamedan province. Local different raisin by-products which produced during machinery cleaning and sorting of sun dried treated grapevine cluster (Vitisvinifera L. cv. Sultana), are as: 1) some outer layer of flesh and skin and pedicle of berries; 2) rejected raisins mostly un-ripped berries with their pedicles and 3) peduncles and rachises with their lateral branches of clusters. They may have suitable nutritive value in ruminants. However, their nutrient profile and availability and anti nutrient factors such as lignin and tannin should be considered. Alfalfa hay is usually the important forage used in dairy cowâs diet. However, it has lower fiber digestibility and higher ruminal crude protein degradability. Increasing alfalfa hay fiber digestibility and decreasing ruminal crude protein degradability can help its feeding value. Raisin by-product may help to achieve those {{in the case of}} alfalfa hay. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the nutritional value of raisin by-product in ruminant feeding compared with late flower alfalfa hay and consideration of its effect on in vitro fermentation of alfalfa hay. Material and methods Based on completely randomized block design, two original samples (two blocks) for each of alfalfa hay and raisin by-product from local availabilities were collected. In first experiment, chemical and phenolic (total phenol and <b>tannin)</b> composition <b>analysis</b> was measured by two replicates for each block according to AOAC methods. In second experiment, in situ ruminal degradation kinetics of alfalfa hay and raisin by-product was measured using two fistulated Mehraban rams. For ruminal incubation times of 0, 3, 6, 16, 36, and 72 h respectively 2, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 filled nylon bags used which randomly assigned in animals. In situ trial was conducted in two runs. Nylon bag residuals from incubation time for each feed block within each run were pooled. In third experiment, gas production kinetics of alfalfa hay, raisin by product and their combination batches as 75 : 25, 50 : 50 and 25 : 75 in dry matter basis were measured at incubation times of 0, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 48 and 72 in two runs and with three vials per time of incubation. Orskov and Mcdonal model used to calculate the in situ and gas production parameters. Potential nutrient supply using 24 h cumulative and chemical compositions were measured. Data was analyzed based on completely randomized block design using proc mixed SAS (9. 2) which the effect of treatment was as fixed and the effects of block and run were considered as random. The LSD used to compare means differences and level of significant was Pâ¤ 0. 05. Results and discussion Chemical composition results showed that total phenol and tannin and organic matter content in raisin by-product were significantly higher and dry matter, crude protein, neutral detergent fiber, acid detergent fiber and ash were lower than alfalfa hay (...|$|R
40|$|The legume species {{sainfoin}} (Onobrychis viciifolia) {{has been}} shown to contain tannins of particularly beneficial composition for ruminant nutrition. This thesis describes effects of condensed tannins on protein degradation in general and in sainfoin specifically. Five studies are presented that investigate 1) effects of different ensiling treatments on sainfoin, 2) in vitro rumen protein degradation of sainfoin related to tannin content, 3) effects of molecular tannin structure on binding of tannins to proteins 4) modifications of the inoculum in an in vitro protein degradation assay. Results showed that sainfoin had promising ensiling characteristics using different levels of commercial silage acidifiers at dry matter levels ranging from 200 to 600 g/kg (Papers I and II). Buffer soluble nitrogen (BSN) content in silage was as low as 250 g/kg nitrogen when the protein sparing tannin effect was not inhibited by polyethylene glycol. With the addition of polyethylene glycol, BSN levels more than doubled. This protein sparing effect is based on the formation of insoluble tannin-protein complexes that cannot be digested by bacteria. However, these complexes may be unstable at low pH. Paper II showed that natural formation of acids during ensiling and treatment with acidic silage additives, resulting in pH as low as 3. 67, did not influence the protein sparing effect of sainfoin <b>tannins.</b> In vitro <b>analysis</b> (Paper IV) revealed that protein degradation was not correlated to tannin content according to the HCl/butanol or radial diffusion assays. Structural tannin characteristics such as degree of polymerization, ratio of cis to trans binding or ratio of procyanidins to prodelphinidins could not explain differences in protein precipitation (Paper V). Further, a promising in vitro protein degradation assay was successfully improved by defaunation of rumen fluid (Paper III). In conclusion, sainfoin tannins showed potential to increase protein utilization by ruminants. It was however also shown that assays employed to measure tannin content were not able to predict nutritional responses probably caused by not yet analyzed factors such as tannin linkage patterns. Future research has to address molecular structure-dependant binding of tannins to proteins before further nutritional research on tannin specific effects on proteins are performed...|$|R
