5|$|The {{concept of}} motive is also explored. When confronting Padgett, Mulder asks {{him why he}} is murdering his victims. Padgett, in turn, admits that he cannot answer the question. Kaner {{suggests}} that Padgett is representative of a version of Mulder, {{and that there is}} a direct parallel between being a criminal profiler—who must <b>think</b> <b>like</b> the criminal—and a writer—who must <b>think</b> <b>like</b> his characters. In the end, however, Padgett sacrifices his personal quest—his manuscript—in order to be free. This presents a distinct contrast to Mulder, who will never truly give up his obsession. Michelle Bush, in her book Myth-X, also notes that the episode sheds light on Scully's motive throughout the series: she wants to gain Mulder's attention, something she feels she does not have. Padgett eventually realizes this, and sacrifices himself for her love.|$|E

Eventually, she comes to identify a cipher based on her childhood name, Olive, that identifies Newton and the other slain shapeshifters, and one {{that has yet to}} be killed. Fringe begins to descend on his residence.|$|E
5|$|In April 1966, Feynman {{delivered}} {{an address}} to the National Science Teachers Association, in which he suggested how students could be made to <b>think</b> <b>like</b> scientists, be open-minded, curious, and especially, to doubt. In the course of the lecture, he gave a definition of science, which he said came about by several stages. The evolution of intelligent life on planet Earth—creatures such as cats that play and learn from experience. The evolution of humans, who came to use language to pass knowledge from one individual to the next, so that the knowledge was not lost when an individual died. Unfortunately, incorrect knowledge could be passed down as well as correct knowledge, so another step was needed. Galileo and others started doubting the truth of what was passed down and to investigate ab initio, from experience, what the true situation was—this was science.|$|E

25|$|The {{first major}} area of social {{influence}} is conformity. Conformity {{is defined as}} the tendency to act or <b>think</b> <b>like</b> other members of a group. The identity of members within a group, i.e. status, similarity, expertise, as well as cohesion, prior commitment, and accountability to the group help to determine the level of conformity of an individual. Individual variation among group members {{plays a key role in}} the dynamic of how willing people will be to conform. Conformity is usually viewed as a negative tendency in American culture, but a certain amount of conformity is adaptive in some situations, as is nonconformity in other situations.|$|E

25|$|Christie's {{experiments}} with first-person narration, especially in The Murder of Roger Ackroyd, saw her attempt {{to expand the}} formal resources of the detective novel. In And Then There Were None (1939), her most successful novel in which none of her detectives appear, her third-person narrative moves fluidly among the perspectives of all of her characters. This need to see different events from alternative perspectives (especially her suspects') indicates that Christie increasingly favoured third-person narration {{over the course of}} her career. In Sad Cypress, for example, the character of a woman on trial is made to <b>think</b> <b>like</b> a murderer when the narrative is written from her perspective: a significant red herring that is only possible due to the narrative method.|$|E
25|$|If {{enough people}} do not <b>think</b> <b>like</b> free-riders, the private and {{voluntary}} provision of public goods may be successful. For example, a free rider might come to a public park to enjoy its beauty, yet discard litter that makes it less enjoyable for others. More public-spirited individuals don't do this (they might even pick up existing litter) – why? There could be several reasons. Perhaps they have lived nearby for years and derive pleasure from helping their community, or at least would feel ashamed if their neighbors or friends saw them. Perhaps they are emotionally attached to the environment, or the park is a national treasure; littering it would offend their patriotism. To the extent that most people behave like this (for any reason), a public good is produced: everyone enjoys a clean park, without the government needing to spend tax money on maintenance crews.|$|E

Her home at Coole Park in County Galway served as an {{important}} meeting place for leading Revival figures, and her early work {{as a member of}} the board of the Abbey was at least as important as her creative writings for that theatre's development.

500|$|Rowland was {{the face}} of Diddy's women's {{fragrance}} Empress, the female counterpart to his men's fragrance I Am King. She was also the worldwide ambassador for watchmakers company TW Steel. Rowland's second compilation album, , was released on October 18, 2011, but failed to impact the charts. She also released her first fitness DVD entitled, Sexy Abs with Kelly Rowland. Later that year, {{it was confirmed that}} Rowland would replace Dannii Minogue as a judge for the eighth series of The X Factor UK alongside Louis Walsh, Gary Barlow and Tulisa Contostavlos. Due to a conflicting schedule, Rowland did not return for the ninth series in 2012 and was replaced by Nicole Scherzinger. During the Black Women in Music event held on February 8, 2012, Essence magazine honored Rowland and music executive Sylvia Rhone for their contributions to music. In April 2012, Rowland toured Australia alongside Ludacris, Chris Brown, Trey Songz, T-Pain, Ice Cube, Lupe Fiasco, and Big Sean for the urban festival, Supafest. That same month, she returned to the big screen playing the supporting role of Brenda in the romantic comedy <b>Think</b> <b>Like</b> a Man. The film, which also starred Michael Ealy, Jerry Ferrara, Meagan Good, Regina Hall, and Kevin Hart, topped the US box office and grossed $91.5 million.

500|$|David McNaughton argues that, {{even if the}} agent's {{commitment}} to his/her principles is not undermined, two-level utilitarianism does not succeed in its goal of showing, [...] "how, on utilitarian principles, {{it is a good}} idea to think and reason in a pluralist and non-consequentialist manner." [...] It is impossible, he claims, to compartmentalise one's thinking in the way the two-level account requires—to simultaneously <b>think</b> <b>like</b> a utilitarian and act in a non-utilitarian way. Hare's response to this type of criticism is that he does his own moral thinking in this way, therefore the challenge that this type of moral thinking is impossible must be false.|$|E

500|$|Once one has {{identified}} {{the different types}} of moral thinking, {{the next step is to}} identify when one ought to <b>think</b> <b>like</b> an archangel, and when like a prole. Hare identifies three types of situation where critical thinking is necessary. The first is when the intuitive general principles conflict in particular cases. The second is when, [...] "though there is no conflict between principles, there is something highly unusual about the case which prompts the question whether the general principles are really fitted to deal with it." [...] Thirdly, and most importantly, critical thinking is necessary in order to select the intuitive prima facie principles that will be used.|$|E
