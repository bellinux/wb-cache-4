5|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, as the Interstate Highway System was being built {{throughout}} the United States, east–west travel through western Maryland was difficult, as US40, the predecessor to I-68, was a two-lane country road with steep grades and hairpin turns. In Cumberland, the <b>traffic</b> <b>situation</b> was particularly problematic, as {{the usage of}} US40 exceeded {{the capacity of the}} city's narrow streets. Traffic following US40 through Cumberland entered through the Cumberland Narrows and followed Henderson Avenue to Baltimore Avenue. After the construction of I-68, this route through Cumberland became US40 Alternate (US40 Alt.).|$|E

Thirdly, the VTS provides traffic organization to ensure a safe and orderly operation of the traffic. The center can draw on data from the Automatic Identification System, local radar, meteorology, SafeSeaNet and video cameras.|$|E
40|$|To {{study the}} speed choice and mental {{workload}} of elderly cyclists on electrical assisted bicycles (e-bikes) in simple and complex <b>traffic</b> <b>situations</b> compared to these on conventional bicycles, a field experiment was conducted using two instrumented bicycles. These bicycles were identical {{except for the}} electric pedal support system. Two groups were compared: elderly cyclists (65 {{years of age and}} older) and a reference group of cyclists in middle adulthood (between 30 and 45 years of age). Participants rode a fixed route with a length of approximately 3. 5 km on both bicycles in counterbalanced order. The route consisted of secluded bicycle paths and roads in a residential area where cyclist have to share the road with motorized traffic. The straight sections on secluded bicycle paths were classified as simple <b>traffic</b> <b>situations</b> and the intersections in the residential area where participants had to turn left, as complex <b>traffic</b> <b>situations.</b> Speed and mental workload were measured. For the assessment of mental workload the peripheral detection task (PDT) was applied. In simple <b>traffic</b> <b>situations</b> the elderly cyclists rode an average 3. 6 km/h faster on the e-bike than on the conventional bicycle. However, in complex <b>traffic</b> <b>situations</b> they rode an average only 1. 7 km/h faster on the e-bike than on the conventional bicycle. Except {{for the fact that the}} cyclists in middle adulthood rode an average approximately 2. 6 km/h faster on both bicycle types and in both traffic conditions, their speed patterns were very similar. The speed of the elderly cyclists on an e-bike was approximately the speed of the cyclists in middle adulthood on a conventional bicycle. For the elderly cyclist and the cyclists in middle adulthood, mental workload did not differ between bicycle type. For both groups, the mental workload was higher in complex <b>traffic</b> <b>situations</b> than in simple <b>traffic</b> <b>situations.</b> Mental workload of the elderly cyclists was somewhat higher than the mental workload of the cyclists in middle adulthood. The relatively high speed of the elderly cyclists on e-bikes in complex <b>traffic</b> <b>situations</b> and their relatively high mental workload in these situations may increase the accident risk of elderly cyclist when they ride on an e-bike.

25|$|It {{is planned}} {{to build a}} new line, Line D (blue line), which will connect the city centre to {{southern}} parts of the city. According to current plans, the line will start in the center and will lead to Vršovice, Krč, Libuš and Písnice. There will be 10 stations: Náměstí Míru (transfer to line A), Náměstí bratří Synků, Pankrác (transfer to line C), Olbrachtova, Nádraží Krč, Nemocnice Krč, Nové Dvory, Libuš, Písnice and Depo Písnice. Metro D is very important for improving the <b>traffic</b> <b>situation</b> in the southern and southeastern part of the city. In the second stage it is planned to extend this line from Pankrác to Náměstí Míru (Peace square). The first part of Line D is planned to be built between 2019 and 2023.|$|E
25|$|Bangalore's {{rapid growth}} has created several {{problems}} relating to traffic congestion and infrastructural obsolescence that the Bangalore Mahanagara Palike has found challenging to address. The unplanned nature {{of growth in}} the city resulted in massive traffic gridlocks that the municipality attempted to ease by constructing a flyover system and by imposing one-way traffic systems. Some of the flyovers and one-ways mitigated the <b>traffic</b> <b>situation</b> moderately but were unable to adequately address the disproportionate growth of city traffic. A 2003 Battelle Environmental Evaluation System (BEES) evaluation of Bangalore's physical, biological and socioeconomic parameters indicated that Bangalore's water quality and terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems were close to ideal, while the city's socioeconomic parameters (traffic, quality of life) aire quality and noise pollution scored poorly. The BBMP works in conjunction with the Bangalore Development Authority (BDA) and the Agenda for Bangalore's Infrastructure and Development Task Force (ABIDe) to design and implement civic and infrastructural projects.|$|E

2500|$|Many Chinatown buses {{have their}} base of {{operation}} in New York City, {{and it has}} been proposed to build a Chinatown bus hub there. New York-to-Boston Chinatown buses generally use the Massachusetts Turnpike from Boston to I-84, and then follow I-84 to I-91 to I-95. [...] As I-95 approaches New York, several routings are possible depending on the <b>traffic</b> <b>situation.</b> Some drivers use the Throgs Neck Bridge to reach the Long Island Expressway, then to the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway, and then Manhattan Bridge to Canal Street. Other drivers use the Whitestone Bridge. [...] Most drivers use the Triborough Bridge when traffic is not congested, and reach the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway via Astoria Boulevard.|$|E
2500|$|A 2008 Boston Globe report {{asserted}} that waiting {{time for the}} majority of trips actually increased as a result of demand induced by the increased road capacity. Because more drivers were opting to use the new roads, traffic bottlenecks were only pushed outward from the city, not reduced or eliminated (although some trips are now faster). The report states, [...] "Ultimately, many motorists going to and from the suburbs at peak rush hours are spending more time stuck in traffic, not less." [...] The Globe also {{asserted that}} their analysis provides a fuller picture of the <b>traffic</b> <b>situation</b> than a state-commissioned study done two years earlier, in which the Big Dig was credited with helping to save at least $167 million a year by increasing economic productivity and decreasing motor vehicle operating costs. That study did not look at highways outside the Big Dig construction area and did not take into account new congestion elsewhere.|$|E
2500|$|During the 1950s, the <b>traffic</b> <b>situation</b> {{became part}} of the public debate, as NSB {{suggested}} to close traffic on the line. The issue was related to the choice of building the line via Grong instead of directly from Steinkjer. Southwards, which had most of the traffic, the railway was [...] longer than National Road 17, which runs via Beitstad. Through the 1950s, buses took most of the traffic from Namsos southwards, leaving only local traffic within Namdalen on the line. From the mid-1950s, an Skb 201 shunter, later designated Skd 206 after it received a diesel engine, was stationed at Namsos Station. From 1955 to 1960, only two daily train pairs were run, after which it was changed back to three until passenger transport ceased. In 1960, the steam locomotives were retired and all passenger services were taken over with multiple units. normally consisting of a single car. At first Class 87 units were used, but from 1962, the larger Class 86 units were put into service. Steam locomotives were retired from ordinary revenue use from 1965, although one Class 21e remained in reserve until 15 January 1971.|$|E
