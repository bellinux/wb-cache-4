In South America and Africa, juvenile white-faced whistling ducks are separable from fulvous by their dark crowns, barred flanks and chestnut breasts.|$|E

Most bovids exhibit sexual dimorphism, with males usually larger as well as heavier than females. Sexual dimorphism is more prominent in medium- to large-sized bovids. All bovids have four toes on each foot – they walk on the central two (the hooves), while the outer two (the dewclaws) are much smaller and rarely touch the ground.|$|E

A.cinereoconia also smells distinctly of chloride of lime. Another similar species is A.costaricensis, found only in Costa Rica. A.atkinsoniana, another North American species, has shorter warts that are spaced further apart than those of A.onusta, and the warts on the basal bulb are arranged in parallel rows.|$|E

5|$|Amylostereaceae {{species were}} {{for a long}} time {{classified}} in the genus Stereum, based primary on the layered structure of the fruit body and <b>the</b> <b>similar</b> physiological activity. Mycologist Jacques Boidin separated Amylosterum from Stereum in 1958, justifying this decision by explaining that microscopic differences such as amyloid spores and encrusted cystidia were sufficiently distinct to warrant recognition as a new genus. Although the type species of the genus (today called A.chailletii) was initially named Trichocarpus ambiguus, the name Trichocarpus had already been used for a genus in the flowering plant family Malvaceae. Boidin thus chose the genus name Amylostereum, referring to the amyloid spores.|$|E

This species also adapts well to captivity and is displayed in public aquaria in Europe, the United States, Okinawa, and Singapore, where they may become tame enough to be hand-fed.|$|E
