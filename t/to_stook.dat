Among her November 1940 submissions to the WAAC was A Knitting Party (approx. 1' 6" [...] x 1' 8": 46 x 51 cm: IWM), painted {{in the drawing room}} of the Dunbar house in Rochester and featuring some fifteen women, including Dunbar's mother Florence (the only hatless woman, surreptitiously looking at her watch), knitting blankets or comforters in service colours.|$|E
5000|$|During the war Dunbar {{continued}} {{painting and}} exhibiting privately. In {{the summer of}} 1942 she exhibited Kentish Landscape and Mrs Dunbar and the Snog at the Suffolk Street Galleries in London. The whereabouts of these paintings is currently unknown. More significantly, in 1943 she exhibited Joseph's Dreams (1' 6" [...] x 2' 6": 46 x 76 cm: Cambridgeshire County Council), a imaginative diptych illustrating the Genesis story of Joseph dreaming that eleven stooks of corn and eleven stars, representing his eleven brothers, paid homage to him. The corn stooks are strongly reminiscent of the stooks in Dunbar's earlier painting, Men Stooking and Girls Learning <b>to</b> <b>Stook.</b> In both scenes Joseph is wearing his coat of many colours, and the dream-background is of fertile fields and well-cared-for plantations: Dunbar's convictions of the synergy between man and Nature are expressed once again.|$|E
