5|$|Even {{within the}} King family, members {{disagree}} about his {{religious and political}} views about gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people.

However, his youngest child, Bernice King, has said publicly <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been opposed to gay marriage.|$|E
5|$|He {{also told}} reporters that {{he was certain that}} Conley was the actual murderer. Slaton privately told friends <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> issued a full pardon, if not for his belief that Frank would soon be able to prove his own innocence.|$|E
5|$|However, during Act V, {{there is}} no mention of Egeus, nor does he have a {{speaking}} role. It is logical, however, <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been in attendance since it is also his daughter Hermia's wedding that the group if there to celebrate.|$|E
50|$|King <b>had</b> stated <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> not <b>have</b> {{been willing}} to attend the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia, due to threats against the Games. <b>He</b> further stated <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> not <b>have</b> wanted his family to attend either.|$|R

5|$|In July 2014, Baker {{was criticized}} by Democrats {{for refusing to}} say whether he {{supported}} {{a provision in the}} new gun control law that gave police chiefs discretion to deny firearms identification cards, which are required to purchase shotguns and rifles. He later stated in a debate <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> signed the gun control bill as it was signed by Governor Patrick.|$|E
5|$|It was prophesied to {{the patriarch}} Abraham <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> {{a son and}} that his name should be Isaac. When Abraham became one hundred years old, this son was born {{to him by his}} first wife Sarah. Though this was Abraham's second son it was Sarah's first and only child.|$|E
5|$|Plans changed, and Tarleton {{appointed}} Captain James Thomson (or Thompson) {{to command}} of Prince of Wales, {{with the intent}} of sailing her on the Liverpool-Africa trade, i.e., as a slaver. James Thomson received a letter of marque on 4 September 1793. His letter indicated <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> a crew of 40 men.|$|E

5|$|After Olander, Williams, and Johnson had recovered, the six musicians {{set to work}} {{on their}} debut album. In doing so, Johnson soon {{discovered}} that the injuries to his hands had altered his dexterity on the mandolin, and threatened to walk away after Powell offhandedly remarked <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> Roe dub in his own tenor harmonies instead of having Johnson sing them. The band also had commitments to finish as the Tennessee River Boys, {{to the point that they}} occasionally had to promote themselves under both names in the same day.|$|E
5|$|As the Emperor's {{personal}} taster, Halotus would accompany Claudius {{to every}} banquet and dinner and as chief steward, {{he would have}} been with Claudius and his family {{for the majority of the}} time. Thus he could have formed a relationship with Agrippina the Younger, suggesting the possibility of their collaboration in poisoning Claudius. It also meant <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been aware of details such as the Emperor's food preferences, his meal times and his schedule, making it easier for him to commit the murder.|$|E
5|$|Beginning on the {{airplane}} to Berlin, flashbacks are interlaced throughout the episode, illustrating the tensions caused by Eli's frequent absence during Ziva's adolescence and the disintegration of Rivka (Weronika Rosati) and Eli David's marriage. Also while on the plane, Ziva explains her rationale for changing their destination: her father had told her to convert all funds to diamonds with a dealer in Berlin should she ever need to go into hiding. She assumes <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> given Bodnar, who he viewed as a son, the same advice.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{infusion}} of cash, the banks of New York were reluctant to make the short-term loans they typically provided to facilitate daily stock trades. Prices on the exchange began to crash, owing {{to the lack of}} funds to finance purchases. At 1:30p.m. Thursday, October 24, Ransom Thomas, the president of the New York Stock Exchange, rushed to Morgan's offices to tell him <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> to close the exchange early. Morgan was emphatic that an early close of the exchange would be catastrophic.|$|E
5|$|Following Scott's {{death the}} band briefly {{considered}} quitting, but {{encouraged by the}} insistence from Scott's parents <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> wanted them to go on, they eventually decided to continue and went about finding a new frontman. Various candidates were considered for his replacement, including: Buzz Shearman, ex-Moxy member, who {{was not able to}} join because of voice problems, ex-Back Street Crawler vocalist Terry Slesser and then Slade vocalist, Noddy Holder. The remaining AC/DC members finally decided on ex-Geordie singer Brian Johnson.|$|E
5|$|Following Suter's {{return from}} suspension, NHL Senior Vice President Brian Burke was {{supposed}} by Ducks Head Coach Pierre Pag√© {{to have said}} <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> given Suter a longer ban if the extent of Kariya's injuries were immediately known. Later in the season, prior to a game between the Blackhawks and Maple Leafs in April 1998, Suter received a death threat, presumably for his actions against Kariya, forcing the NHL to position added security at the Blackhawks bench for the contest. With Kariya away from the team for extended periods of time, the Ducks struggled and finished second-last in the West.|$|E
60|$|The cowboy {{tried to}} argue, but the Rovers and their chums would not listen, {{and in the}} end Jim Jones said <b>he</b> <b>would</b> accept twenty-five dollars and let it go at <b>that.</b> <b>He</b> said <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> the steer carted away before night.|$|R

5|$|In an {{interview}} with Aphrodite Jones, Patrick Treacy, a cosmetic surgeon who treated Jackson between July 2006 and early 2007, as well as shortly before his death, stated <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> known if Jackson would have been also treated by another physician and that he never saw any drugs in the house. He also said that Jackson did not have insomnia and never asked him for narcotics. Treacy stated Jackson was in good physical health; he said Jackson always insisted {{on the presence of}} an anesthetist when Propofol was administered.|$|E
5|$|In early January 2017, Judah {{announced}} <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> {{his first}} fight in over 3 years on January 21 when he fights journeyman Jorge Luis Munguia (12-7, 4 KOs) in a scheduled 10 round bout at Sun National Bank Center in Trenton, New Jersey. The bout was an Internet-only pay per view. As expected, Judah won the bout via 2nd-round TKO. Judah connected with power {{shots from the}} opening bell, landed a left hook {{to the head of}} Munguia in round 2 which dropped it on his back. The referee stopped the fight at 1 minute and 27 seconds of the round.|$|E
5|$|Keyes {{supports}} {{an amendment}} to the Constitution barring same-sex marriage. He stated he would not have gone to war in Iraq, but also said that the war was justified and defended President George W. Bush's decision in one of his 2004 debates. Keyes has stated that troops should stay in Iraq, but also said <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> turned over operations to the United Nations. However, Keyes has also stated that even while he was an ambassador there he was not a supporter of the United Nations.|$|E

5|$|Most modern {{historians have}} exonerated Robert Dudley from murder or a cover-up. Apart from {{alternatives}} for a murder plot as causes for Amy Robsart's death, his correspondence with Thomas Blount and William Cecil {{in the days}} following has been cited as proofs of his innocence; the letters, which show signs of an agitated mind, making clear his bewilderment and unpreparedness. It has also been judged as highly unlikely <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> orchestrated the death of his wife in a manner which laid him open to such a foreseeable scandal.|$|E
5|$|On October3, it was {{reported}} that he was retained by Boston under the reserve clause. When interviewed during the off-season, Stivetts claimed {{that he would like to}} quit pitching and play first, that is if a team would give him the opportunity. Selee, Boston's manager, disagreed and claimed that the team needed Stivetts in the pitching rotation instead. It was also likely <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> received less salary playing at first.|$|E
