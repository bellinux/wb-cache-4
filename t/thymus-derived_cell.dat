40|$|A {{population}} of thymus-derived lymphocytes {{has been identified}} that, upon activation by the nonspecific plant mitogen concanavalin A, suppresses the development of plaque-forming cell responses in fresh or 48 -h antigen-stimulated cultures of mouse spleen cells. Suppressor cells can inhibit both primary and secondary IgM and IgG responses in vitro.

40|$|Preculture {{treatment}} of normal spleen cells with antiserum against mouse kappa light chains and complement {{was found to}} inhibit in vitro responses of these cells to TNP and erythrocyte (carrier) antigens, primarily by elimination of a thymus-derived helper component required for the response.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{influenza}} virus infection on systemic antibacterial resistance was assessed in a mouse model.

Specific immunity to Listeria was measured using adoptive transfer of immune spleen cells. Preinfection of recipient mice with influenza virus reduced the level of adoptive immunity. Influenza virus preinfection of immune cell donors produced a similar decrease, which suggested that specific thymus-derived cell-mediated immunity was impaired in addition to macrophage function.

Either the lymph node-seeking subpopulation or the spleen-seeking subpopulation alone was markedly deficient {{in its ability to}} provide a GVH reaction when compared with the normal population from which it was derived. However, an appropriate mixture of the two had a reactivity characteristic of the parent population. Both subpopulations were sensitive to treatment with anti-θ antibody and complement in vitro. These results provide a convincing demonstration of the functional heterogeneity within the pool of <b>thymus-derived</b> <b>cells</b> present in a single normal lymphoid tissue.

40|$|Collaboration between thymus-derived lymphocytes, and nonthymus-derived antibody-forming cell {{precursors}} {{occurs during}} the immune response of mice to sheep erythrocytes (SRBC). The {{aim of the}} experiments reported here was to attempt to induce tolerance {{in each of the}} two cell populations to determine which cell type dictates the specificity of the response. Adult mice were rendered specifically tolerant to SRBC by treatment with one large dose of SRBC followed by cyclophosphamide. Attempts to restore to normal their anti-SRBC response by injecting lymphoid cells from various sources were unsuccessful. A slight increase in the response was, however, obtained in recipients of thymus or thoracic duct lymphocytes and a more substantial increase in recipients of spleen cells or of a mixture of thymus or thoracic duct cells and normal marrow or spleen cells from thymectomized donors. Thymus cells from tolerant mice were as effective as thymus cells from normal or cyclophosphamide-treated controls in enabling neonatally thymectomized recipients to respond to SRBC and in collaborating with normal marrow cells to allow a response to SRBC in irradiated mice. Tolerance was thus not achieved at the level of thelymphocyte population within the thymus, perhaps because of insufficient penetration of the thymus by the antigens concerned. By contrast, thoracic duct lymphocytes from tolerant mice failed to restore to normal the response of neonatally thymectomized recipients to SRBC. Tolerance is thus a property that can be linked specifically to <b>thymus-derived</b> <b>cells</b> as they exist in the mobile pool of recirculating lymphocytes outside the thymus. <b>Thymus-derived</b> <b>cells</b> are thus considered capable of recognizing and specifically reacting with antigenic determinants. Marrow cells from tolerant mice were as effective as marrow cells from cyclophosphamide-treated or normal controls in collaborating with normal thymus cells to allow a response to SRBC in irradiated recipients. When a mixture of thymus or thoracic duct cells and lymph node cells was given to irradiated mice, the response to SRBC was essentially the same whether the lymph node cells were derived from tolerant donors or from thymectomized irradiated, marrow-protected donors. Attempts to induce tolerance to SRBC in adult thymectomized, irradiated mice 3 – 4 wk after marrow protection, by treatment with SRBC and cyclophosphamide, were unsuccessful: after injection of thoracic duct cells, a vigorous response to SRBC occurred. The magnitude of the response was the same whether or not thymus cells had been given prior to the tolerization regime. The various experimental designs have thus failed to demonstrate specific tolerance in the nonthymus-derived lymphocyte population. Several alternative possibilities were discussed. Perhaps such a population does not contain cells capable of dictating the specificity of the response. This was considered unlikely. Alternatively, tolerance may have been achieved but soon masked by a rapid, thymus-independent, differentiation of marrow-derived lymphoid stem cells. On the other hand, tolerance may not have occurred simply because the induction of tolerance, like the induction of antibody formation, requires the collaboration of <b>thymus-derived</b> <b>cells.</b> Finally, tolerance in the nonthymus-derived cell population may never be achieved because the SRBC-cyclophosphamide regime specifically eliminates <b>thymus-derived</b> <b>cells</b> leaving the antibody-forming cell precursors intact but unable to react with antigen as there are no <b>thymus-derived</b> <b>cells</b> with which to interact...|$|R

The culture conditions, cellular manipulations, and antigen {{requirements for the}} optimal induction of helper cells with these purified cell populations is presented. The active helper cell generated in this culture system is a <b>thymus-derived</b> <b>cell</b> which requires macrophages for its induction and must be proliferate in vitro before the manifestation of helper-cell function. Helper cells generated in vitro stimulate both carrier-specific and nonspecific enhancement of splenic anti-hapten responses.

40|$|Mice {{exposed to}} live or beta-propiolactone-inactivated rabies virus {{generated}} a strong, specific cell-mediated cytotoxic response which was generally maximal 6 days after inoculation. Release of 51 Cr was apparently {{a function of}} immune thymus-derived lymphocytes (T cells) because it was abrogated by prior incubation of spleen cells with anti-thymus antiserum and complement but was undiminished by passage of spleen cells through nylon-wool columns. Cytotoxicity was always maximal for interactions in which thymus-derived cells and targets shared H- 2 genes but, unlike the situation found in other assays of this type, considerable lysis of allogeneic, virus-infected target cells may also occur. Perhaps the most significant finding from these experiments is that an inactivated virus {{has been shown to}} stimulate a potent cytotoxic <b>thymus-derived</b> <b>cell</b> response. Manipulation of this experimental model may allow analysis of the antigens required for stimulation of cell-mediated immunity.

40|$|It {{has been}} shown that <b>thymus-derived</b> <b>cells</b> play an {{important}} role during the development of a humoral immune response; thus, newborn thymectomized mice (1) or bone marrow chimeras (2, 3) responded normally to injected immunogens only after transfer of intact thymus cells. There is evidence, derived from transfer experiments with so-called "educated thymus cells " (4) and from experiments with "tolerant" thymus cells (5, 6), that the <b>thymus-derived</b> <b>cells</b> are antigen-sensitive, that they have to recognize the immunogen specifically to be able to assist the humoral immune response; nevertheless, most of the antibody-secreting cells do not develop from the thymus cell population as demonstrated by chromosomal analysis (7, 8) and histocompatabiUty antigen typing (1). It might be suggested that the thymusderived cells are the carrier-recognizing cells. Their number is crucial for the magnitude of the immune response (9), but little is known about their function, when they act during the onset and development of the immune response, and how they assist the triggering of the antibody precursor cells or the expansion of the antibody-secreting cell clones.

40|$|In {{this series}} of papers {{it has been shown}} that the immune {{response}} of mice to sheep erythrocytes requires the participation of two classes of lymphoid <b>cells.</b> <b>Thymus-derived</b> <b>cells</b> initially react with antigen and then interact with another class of cells, the antibody-forming cell precursors, to cause their differentiation to antibody-forming cells. Antilymphocyte globulin depressed the ability of mice to respond to sheep erythrocytes. This effect was more marked when the antigen was injected intraperitoneally than intravenously, and occurred only when the antilymphocyte globulin was given before or simultaneously with antigen. Injection of thymus cells restored to near normal the ability to respond to an intravenous injection of sheep erythrocytes. Spleen cells from antilymphocyte globulin-treated mice gave a weak adoptive immune response in irradiated recipients. The addition of thymus cells however enabled a response similar to that given by normal spleen cells. When thymectomized irradiated recipients were used, normal spleen cells continued to give a higher response to a challenge of sheep erythrocytes at 2 and 4 wk postirradiation than did spleen cells from ALG-treated donors. This result is more consistent with the notion that <b>thymus-derived</b> target <b>cells</b> are eliminated, rather than temporarily inactivated, by antilymphocyte globulin. These findings suggest that, in vivo, antilymphocyte globulin acts selectively on the <b>thymus-derived</b> antigen-reactive <b>cells...</b>|$|R
40|$|Thymopoietin is a {{thymic hormone}} that induces {{differentiation}} of thymocytes from precursor cells which arise in hemopoietic tissues. This paper describes a sensitive {{in vitro assay}} for the induction of Thy 1. 2 antigen on null lymphocytes from germ-free athymic (nu/nu) mice. The sensitivity and specificity of the bioassay were increased by adding high concentrations of ubiquitin (a nonspecific inducer) to the induction incubations.

40|$|The {{presence}} of the thymus in mice is essential for proper development, maintenance, and function of the lymphoid system (1, 2). Thymic function results from the interaction of peculiar cellular migration patterns {{to and from the}} thymus (3 - 10) and from the inductive or expanding capabilities of thymic stroma that include humoral factors (11, 12). In previous studies, we have shown that nonlymphoid thymomas induced restoration of immunological functions in neonatally thymectomized mice (13). When thymomas were grafted into allogeneic hosts, immunological restoration was mediated by lymphoid cells of host type (14). Thymomas and normal thymus were also capable of inducing restoration when enclosed in truly cell-impenetrable diffusion chambers (12). This evidence indicated that humoral inducing and/or expanding functions of thymus or thymomas mediate the restoration of the thymectomized hosts. Comparable results were obtained with free thymus grafts, and although restoration was mediated mainly by host-type cells, a <b>thymus-derived</b> <b>cell</b> population could be detected (6 - 10).

Lymphocytes from guinea pigs not presensitized to SPE responded nonspecifically to SPE types B and C. Guinea pig lymphocytes from SPE A-presensitized animals showed enhanced proliferation over controls when treated with SPE B, suggesting that a degree of cross-reactivity between SPE types may exist, though they are serologically distinct. Mouse splenic lymphocytes exhibited low-level responsiveness to all SPE types, as would be expected for an antigen-specific proliferative response. Unlike mouse splenic lymphocytes, rabbit spleen cells and human cord blood, lymphocytes responded nonspecifically to all SPE types. Although rabbit spleen cells and human cord blood lymphocytes responded nonspecifically, the maximum response occurred at day 4 or 5, comparable to an antigen-specific system rather than a day 2 or 3 such as that with the nonspecific <b>thymus-derived</b> <b>cell</b> mitogen, concanavalin A...|$|E
40|$|There is {{substantial}} {{evidence for a}} nonspecific mechanism of activation of thymus-independent bone marrow-derived precursors of immunocytes (B cells) in primary and secondary immune responses elicited in vitro (1 - 5) and in animals undergoing graft-versus-host reactions (6). <b>Thymus-derived</b> <b>cells</b> primed by immunogens other than the test antigens (not crossreacting {{at the level of}} antibody-forming cells) may be utilized in such a mechanism (7). The common feature of most reported experiments is that preexposure of lymphoid ceils to a priming antigen enhances the responsiveness of spleen cells to a second test antigen, provided that both immunogens are present {{at the time of the}} second immunization. It is generally presumed that the enhancing effect is due to proliferation of <b>thymus-derived</b> <b>cells</b> with helper function for antibody formation by B cells (including antigen-reactive cells and their activated progeny, i. e. inducer cells) (T cells) in response to the antigen administered first and to subsequent interaction of the activated thymic inducers with the subpopulations of B cells specific for the test antigens.

T cells, responding to mitogens, could be shown to be a subpopulation of RTLA-bearing cells and to have a relatively large volume. The size distribution of mitogen-responsive cells from different individuals showed some variation, but in general large spleen cells took up less thymidine per 10 (6) cells than did large cells from other lymphoid organs. Upon stimulation with concanavalin A (con A) small popliteal lymph node cells took up more thymidine per 10 (6) cells than did small thymus cells. The corresponding small cells of mesenteric lymph node and spleen took up intermediate quantities of thymidine. Thymus-derived cells that were resistant to complement-mediated cell kill with RTLA antiserum showed greater responsiveness to con A than did the original cell preparations. Non-adherent cells incorporated more thymidine when stimulated with phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) than when they were stimulated with con A. Lightly adherent cells were relatively more responsive to con A stimulation and firmly adherent cells were less responsive to both. The findings were discussed in terms of the density of RTLA on the membranes of T cells.

40|$|The {{presence}} of concanavalin A (Con A) inhibits the immune response of mouse spleen cell suspensions to erythrocyte antigens, stimulates {{the incorporation of}} tritiated thymidine, and increases cell recovery. Con A also restores the depressed response of cell preparations treated to remove thymus-derived cells. The dose-response curve for all four effects shows peak activity at 2 µg/ml. The depressed in vitro response of spleen cell suspensions from adult thymectomized, irradiated, bone marrow-restored mice is also restored by Con A. Here the dose-response curve is quite different with activity over a much wider range of concentration. The restoration of thymus-derived cell-depleted cultures by Con A is inhibited {{by the addition of}} untreated, unirradiated, mouse spleen cell suspensions, but is not inhibited by untreated, irradiated cells. Small numbers of spleen cells that have been preincubated with Con A and washed will inhibit the response of fresh, untreated cells to antigen.

Thymectomized mice that had not received thymus implants had twenty times less antibody-plaque-forming cells per million spleen cells than sham-thymectomized controls and failed to reject foreign skin. Some evidence of restoration of immune capacities was obtained in mice bearing for 1 to 2 weeks either normal thymus implants or thymus tissue irradiated in vitro with 500 R. By contrast, thymus tissue irradiated with 2000 R failed to influence neonatally thymectomized mice with respect to their immunological capacities.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that two distinct signals are required for the triggering of the precursors of antibody-forming bone marrow-derived cells (B cells) : (a) the binding of antigen or of a mitogen to the corresponding receptor sites on B-cell membranes and (b) the interaction of activated C 3 with the C 3 receptor of B lymphocytes. There is growing evidence that B-cell mitogens and T (<b>thymus-derived</b> <b>cell)</b> -independent antigens are capable of activating the alternate pathway of the complement system (bypass). Therefore, the effect of another potent bypass inducer was investigated with regard to B-cell activation {{and the role of}} C 3. Purified, pyrogen-free cobra venom factor was mitogenic for both T and B lymphocytes (cortisone-resistant mouse thymus cells and lymph node lymphocytes from congenitally athymic mice). Venom factor could substitute for T cells by restoring the potential of antibody formation to sheep red blood cells in mouse B-cell cultures supplemented with macrophages or 2 -mercaptoethanol. Venom factor may be capable of conferring activated C 3 to the C 3 receptor of B lymphocytes: preincubation of lymphoid cells with homologous serum or plasma, 10 mM EDTA, and sepharose-coupled venom factor converted with serum to an enzyme active against C 3, inhibited their capacity to subsequently form rosettes with sheep erythrocytes sensitized with amboceptor and C 5 -deficient mouse complement. In the absence of EDTA, preincubation of freshly prepared B-cell suspensions with C 3 -sufficient homologous serum also blocked their subsequent interaction with complement-sensitized erythrocytes {{and at the same time}} rendered them reactive to an otherwise T-cell-specific mitogen. Moreover, mitogen induced B-cell proliferation in lymph node (but not in spleen) cell cultures, appeared to depend on the availability of exogenous C 3 : zymosan-absorbed fetal bovine serum (only 8. 3 % site-forming units remaining) supported T-cell activation by phytohemagglutinin, concanavalin A, and venom factor, but failed to sustain B-cell stimulation by pokeweed mitogen, lipopolysaccharide, and venom factor. T-cell-dependent antibody formation in composite cultures containing T cells or T-cell-substituting B-cell mitogens, B cells, and macrophages, always required the presence of C 3 -sufficient serum...|$|E
40|$|A {{striking}} {{correlation between}} the capacity of an antigen to nonspecifically suppress humoral immune responses of subsequently administered antigens which are non-cross-reacting, i. e. to manifest antigenic competition and produce enlargement of spleen size through cell proliferation, was found. Increase in spleen size was always accompanied by {{a drop in the}} normal proportion of thymus-derived cells to non-thymus-derived cells. Various means of altering the immune response to the initial antigen, and hence, the capacity of that antigen to suppress in a model of antigenic competition were performed and correlated with changes in spleen size and in the proportion of θ-positive cells in the spleen. In all instances, when the experimental condition reduced or abolished antigenic competition, the increase in spleen size and reduction in the proportion of θ-positive cells in the spleen was reduced or abolished. Furthermore, under conditions in which the suppressive capacity of the initial antigen was unaltered, the increase in spleen size and reduction in θ-proportion occurred normally. Finally, the better the suppression in a model of antigenic competition, the greater the increase in spleen size and reduction in the proportion of θ-positive cells. On the basis of these observations, it appears that there is a relationship between spleen enlargement through clonally restricted cell proliferation and the expression of antigenic competition; one cannot have the latter without the former. It is postulated that the immunological lesion associated with antigenic competition resides at the level of interference with cell interaction between thymus-derived antigen-reactive cells and marrow-derived antibody-forming cells. This occurs {{as a result of a}} relative "diluting out" of cells of both populations carrying antigenic specificity differing from the one(s) which induced the dilution effect in the first place. The net effect of this is to decrease the chance of a "hit" or interaction between a marrow-derived and <b>thymus-derived</b> <b>cell</b> of the same specificities. This mechanism, which is compatible with theories of clonal selection, and which in fact is dependent upon them, supports the view that the term "antigenic competition" is a misnomer; there is no competition by the antigens for anything. The term "antigen-induced suppression" is suggested as a more suitable alternative...|$|E
40|$|Skeletal muscle fibres {{develop in}} {{cultures}} established from dissociated rat thymus glands. The properties of their acetylcholine receptors {{were compared with}} those on fibres in skeletal muscle cultures. Acetylcholine depolarized the <b>thymus-derived</b> muscle <b>cells</b> in a concentration-dependent manner. Under voltage clamp the reversal potential {{was determined to be}} - 0. 4 mV, which was not significantly different from the reversal potential of cells in the muscle cultures. In both types of cultures, sensitivity to ionophoretically applied acetylcholine decreased during the period when fibres were growing rapidly and then increased. The mean channel lifetime of acetylcholine-activated channels was similar in both types of muscle fibre (3 - 4 ms at - 40 mV), but the single channel conductance was significantly higher in the <b>thymus-derived</b> <b>cells</b> (70 - 75 pS compared to 55 - 60 pS). The cholinoceptors on both types of muscle fibre had nicotinic properties as judged by their preferential activation by acetylcholine rather than by acetyl-beta-methylcholine and oxotremorine and by the selective blockade by tubocurarine and erabutoxin b rather than by atropine...|$|R
40|$|Passive {{transfer}} of thymus cells from congenic donors to athymic mice reconstitutes the recipient's capacity to reject allogeneic skin grafts, provided the donor is immunologically mature {{and the number}} of thymus cells from the adult donor is high enough. Passive {{transfer of}} thymus cells from adult allogeneic donors induces a mild to severe graft-versus-host disease and the grafts are retained until death. These results are interpreted on the basis of recent findings on the endocrine conditions of congenitally athymic mice and on the previous data on the hormone dependence of thymus cells to acquire immunocompetence. It is proposed that a normal host environment is a prerequisite for the <b>thymus-derived</b> <b>cells</b> to perform in cell-mediated immune reactions...|$|R
