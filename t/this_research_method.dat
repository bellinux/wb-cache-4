50|$|The Descriptive Phenomenological Method {{involves}} neither deduction nor induction {{in order}} to find meaning, but instead asks the researcher to intuit what is essential to the phenomenon being studied. Intuition, in this sense (going along with the philosophy of phenomenology), simply means that an object (or state of affairs, structural whole, proposition etc.) becomes presented to consciousness in a certain mode of givenness. In the context of <b>this</b> <b>research</b> <b>method,</b> therefore, intuition is used {{in order to}} get a sense of the lived meaning of each description so as to relate them to what is known about the phenomenon of interest in general These types of generalities are not statistical probabilities nor universally posited, but are dependent upon the lived meaning of the descriptions and the meaning of the phenomenon being studied.|$|E
50|$|Unstructured {{interviews}} are a {{lot more}} time consuming in comparison to other research methods. This is due because there are typically no prearranged questions asked during an unstructured interview and if there are questions prepared, they are open ended questions which prioritize elaborated answers. These “open ended questions can require the interview to transcribe a lengthy statement”, making it difficult to determine and enforce a set time for the unstructured interview to be conducted within. As a result, the unstructured interview is sometimes expensive and only feasible with small samples. With {{the fact that it is}} difficult to interview a large sample, this affects the data's generalizability and representativeness. However, current research shows there is a need to take up the unstructured interview regardless of how <b>this</b> <b>research</b> <b>method</b> takes to address unbalanced minority powers in research methods.|$|E
5000|$|The need to {{understand}} the cultural meaning of online communities (e.g., Reddit; LinkedIn) has grown exponentially since the appraisal of Web 2.0 interfaces (i.e., user-generated content), along with other technological advances. One can no longer assume that people are isolating themselves from the physical world with technology, but rather view technology such as computer-mediated communication and digital information as a gateway that allows them to interact with familiar and, at times, anonymous users on a given occasion.

[...] When {{in front of a}} mirror, the patient is asked to name the object in front of them, identify the reflection, guess the age of the person in the reflection, and describe how the self and the reflection both appear that day. The researcher then holds an object behind the patient and moves it horizontally at ear level. The researcher asks the patient to grab the object, observing if the patient reaches into the mirror or turns around to take the object from the researcher’s hand. Lastly, a patient is asked to identify parts {{of his or her own}} body in the mirror. [...] While <b>this</b> <b>research</b> <b>method</b> is helpful to understand typical characteristics of the delusion, it can be particularly difficult to conduct a valid study in this way due to patients’ medical comorbidities and general extensive cognitive deterioration. [...] It is difficult to attribute particular symptoms to the mirrored-self misidentification delusion rather than to a separate feature of the patient’s general dementia. [...] As such, hypnosis of healthy patients is typically used to study the delusion because it can highlight the symptoms of the delusion while removing the influence of other comorbidities.|$|E
50|$|Experiments, {{conducted}} in laboratory settings, allow {{the testing of}} effects resulting from mere exposure to controlled stimuli. <b>This</b> <b>research</b> <b>method</b> is primarily used in psychological approaches to election campaign communication research. Experiments can, e.g., detect the effects election campaign commercials have on the electorate. By exposing subjects to particular election spots and varying specific details in the ad, the variables causing an effect can be revealed.June Woong Rhee, e.g., makes use of two kinds of experiments within in his study on framing effects in election campaign news coverage. To examine the influence of framing effects on voters’ interpretation of campaigns, a broadcast-print experiment and a broadcast-only experiment were conducted. As pretest, the participants of the study had {{to write a letter}} about the 1992 U.S. presidential election campaign. Afterwards the participants were confronted with print and broadcast news stories about the 1991 Philadelphia mayoral election campaign, which were created using a strategy or an issue frame and simulating the actual coverage. Conditions, e.g., within the broadcast-print experiment were strategy frames in broadcast and print news, issue frames in broadcast and print news, or a mixture, i.e., either an issue frame in printed news and a strategy frame in broadcasts, or strategy-framed broadcast and issue-framed print news. The participants of the experiments were “asked to read or watch the news stories for five days in their homes”. After the five days of exposure to the manipulated news, the participants met with the experimenter and, as a posttest, had to “write a letter about the Philadelphia mayoral campaign”. To interpret the results a content analysis was conducted by Rhee. The study revealed that “both strategy-framed and issue-framed print news stories are effective in influencing campaign interpretation“.|$|E
5000|$|Developmental {{psychologists have}} a number of methods to study changes in {{individuals}} over time. Common research methods include systematic observation, including naturalistic observation or structured observation; self-reports, which could be clinical interviews or structured interviews; clinical or case study method; and ethnography or participant observation. These methods differ in the extent of control researchers impose on study conditions, and how they construct ideas about which variables to study. Every developmental investigation can be characterized in terms of whether its underlying strategy involves the experimental, correlational, or case study approach. The experimental method involves [...] "actual manipulation of various treatments, circumstances, or events to which the participant or subject is exposed; the experimental design points to cause-and-effect relationships. This method allows for strong inferences to be made of causal relationships between the manipulation of one or more independent variables and subsequent behavior, as measured by the dependent variable. The advantage of using <b>this</b> <b>research</b> <b>method</b> is that it permits determination of cause-and-effect relationships among variables. On the other hand, the limitation is that data obtained in an artificial environment may lack generalizability. The correlational method explores the relationship between two or more events by gathering information about these variables without researcher intervention. The advantage of using a correlational design is that it estimates the strength and direction of relationships among variables in the natural environment; however, the limitation {{is that it does not}} permit determination of cause-and-effect relationships among variables. The case study approach allows investigations to obtain an in-depth understanding of an individual participant by collecting data based on interviews, structured questionnaires, observations, and test scores. Each of these methods have its strengths and weaknesses but the experimental method when appropriate is the preferred method of developmental scientists because it provides a controlled situation and conclusions to be drawn about cause-and-effect relationships.|$|E
