5|$|The Rance <b>Tidal</b> <b>Power</b> Station (240 MW) is the world's first <b>tidal</b> <b>power</b> station. The {{facility}} {{is located on}} the estuary of the Rance River, in Brittany, France.

5|$|Unlike {{wind and}} wave, <b>tidal</b> <b>power</b> is an {{inherently}} predictable source. However {{the technology is}} in its infancy and numerous devices are in the prototype stages. Today {{it is known that}} a tall tubular tower with three blades attached to it is the typical profile of a wind turbine, but twenty-five years ago there were a wide variety of different systems being tested. This is the current situation with regard to <b>tidal</b> <b>power.</b> Some systems capture energy from the tides in a vertical direction. The tide comes in and raises the water level in a basin. As the tide lowers the water in the basin is discharged through a turbine. Tidal stream power captures energy from the flow of tides, usually using underwater plant resembling a small wind turbine. An example is Marine Current Turbines SeaGen 1.2MW device at Strangford Lough in Northern Ireland, which is the largest tidal stream turbine in the world. To date the only two installed <b>tidal</b> <b>power</b> plants of notable size are the Sihwa Lake <b>Tidal</b> <b>Power</b> Station in Gyeonggi Province, South Korea and the Rance <b>Tidal</b> <b>Power</b> Station in Brittany, France, rated at 254 MW and 240 MW respectively. There are also many small scale projects throughout the world.|$|E
5|$|In 1924, the Petitcodiac <b>Tidal</b> <b>Power</b> Company {{proposed}} a <b>tidal</b> <b>power</b> project. This {{called for a}} dam to be built between Hopewell Cape and Fort Folly Point. The company sold shares {{to raise funds for}} the project and a series of on-site and airborne studies were conducted by the federal government, but the project fell through by 1928. As rail transport became more common, it displaced river transportation around the Great Depression. In addition, the Greater Moncton International Airport offered an airmail service from Moncton to Montreal by 29 December 1929. These factors further marginalised the Petitcodiac.|$|E

5|$|The sea {{offers a}} very large supply of energy carried by ocean waves, tides, {{salinity}} differences, and ocean temperature differences which can be harnessed to generate electricity.

5|$|Another {{approach}} {{was used by}} the LIMPET 500 (Land Installed Marine Power Energy Transformer) energy converter which was installed on the island of Islay by Wavegen Ltd. It was a shore-based unit and generated power when waves run up the beach, creating pressure inside an inclined oscillating water column. This in turn creates pneumatic power which drives the twin 250kW generators. Islay LIMPET was opened in 2001 and was the world's first commercial scale wave-energy device. In March 2013 Voith Hydro decided to close down Wavegen choosing to concentrate on <b>tidal</b> <b>power</b> projects.|$|E

30|$|There {{are many}} types of <b>tidal</b> current <b>power</b> {{generation}} devices, and {{it is necessary to}} make comprehensive evaluation of <b>tidal</b> current <b>power</b> generation devices in order to provide valuable reference for the improvement of their performance indexes. On the basis of the analysis of the <b>tidal</b> current <b>power</b> generation device performance indexes, the hierarchical model for comprehensive evaluation of device performance is given in this paper. By normalizing the membership matrix elements based on fuzzy comprehensive evaluation model, all the values of the matrix elements are restrained in the range of 0.0 to 1.0, hence the complexity of the calculations is reduced. Vector similarity is used to determine the expert weights which reflect the knowledge and experience of the experts. This paper presents an improved method for rank correlation analysis, and calculates the comprehensive weight value and the final evaluation results of <b>tidal</b> current <b>power</b> generation devices. The presented method improves the credibility of the evaluation. In the end, measured data of two units of <b>tidal</b> current <b>power</b> generation devices are evaluated in the paper, and the effectiveness of the presented method is verified.|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to an existing installed capacity of 1.3 Gigawatts (GW) of hydro-electric schemes, Scotland has an estimated potential of 36.5 GW of wind and 7.5 GW of <b>tidal</b> <b>power,</b> 25% of the estimated total capacity for the European Union and up to 14 GW of wave power potential, 10% of EU capacity. The renewable electricity generating capacity may be 60 GW or more, considerably greater than the existing capacity from all Scottish fuel sources of 10.3 GW. Scotland exceeded its renewable energy target, set in 2007, for 31% of total power generation coming from renewables by 2011. Scotland eyes 50% renewable energy by 2030.|$|E

They estimated that the offshore wind industry might create between 300–2,200 long-term jobs by 2020. With 20 GW of renewable energy projects in the pipeline, the sector {{has the potential to}} grow quickly in the years ahead creating more jobs in the region. Glasgow, Fife and Edinburgh are key centres of offshore wind power development, and the emerging wave power and <b>tidal</b> <b>power</b> industries are centred around the Highlands and Islands.

Hence, this paper investigates the possibility of <b>tidal</b> stream <b>power</b> generation system on damping inter-area oscillations, as a new contribution to earlier studies. As tidal farms are mostly installed far from conventional power plants, local signals do not include good quality to alleviate inter-area oscillations.

30|$|Along {{with the}} {{advancement}} {{of science and technology}} and the development of social industrialization, the problem of energy shortage {{is becoming more and more}} serious. One important way to settle the energy shortage is to develop new energy power generation technology. There are abundant energies in the ocean, including wave energy, tidal current energy, salinity energy and thermal energy. In order to promote the development of ocean energy, at least sixty countries had structured policies for their ocean industries [1, 2]. As a country of wide ocean areas, China has just begun to develop the technology for marine resources utilization. Wave and <b>tidal</b> current <b>power</b> generation technologies in China can only be applied to engineering prototype and demonstration experiment, and are not able to satisfy the demand of power generation on a large scale. At present, no testing site has been built to provide a platform for experiment, test, and evaluation of wave or <b>tidal</b> current <b>power</b> generation devices in China [3]. The ocean renewable energy project fund has supported a series of projects about offshore testing site construction of wave and tidal current energy utilization, which will carry forward the development of ocean energy generation technology in China [4]. Among them, the study on the comprehensive evaluation method for <b>tidal</b> current <b>power</b> generation device considered an important part of offshore testing site construction, offering valuable reference for improving the performance of <b>tidal</b> current <b>power</b> generation device.|$|R
40|$|A {{stochastic}} {{profit maximisation}} model for {{operation of a}} <b>tidal</b> lagoon <b>power</b> plant including production head effects, power market prices and start-up costs is developed. The model is formulated as a two-stage stochastic mixed integer programming problem with bidding decisions in the first stage, and plant operation and real-time sales in the second stage. The Swansea Bay Tidal Lagoon project is taken as case study and the analysis is performed including sales in the United Kingdom (UK) day-ahead (spot) and intraday market for different power price characteristics. The largest annual energy production is estimated to 317 GWh and operational income is estimated to 15 million Great British Pounds (GBP) for current price characteristics. Two optimal power generation schedules based on different power price characteristics are identified {{and the value of}} short-term flexibility is estimated. A <b>tidal</b> lagoon <b>power</b> plant is shown to benefit from limited short-term operational flexibility and the value of flexibility is seen to increase with power price variance. Further, the European power system model EMPIRE is extended to include <b>tidal</b> lagoon <b>power</b> resources. The extension comprise some flexibility in operational decisions by introducing a set of optional production schedules based on the findings in the above mentioned operational model. A tidal lagoon portfolio along the coast of Great Britain is used for a case study analysing the impact of developing and deploying tidal lagoon generation capacity in Great Britain.
