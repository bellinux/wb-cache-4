40|$|AbstractAt present, in {{our country}} the main deep {{drilling}} rigs are rotary disk drilling rig, spindle-type drilling rig and full hydraulic motor <b>head</b> <b>drive</b> drilling rig, and most of foreign drilling rig equipment are full hydraulic motor <b>head</b> <b>drive</b> drilling rigs. These rigs have many disadvantages; they cannot meet the demand of deep drilling. As the major breakthroughs {{were made in the}} development of high power permanent magnet frequency conversion motor, it is possible to develop the permanent-magnet motor direct drive top-driving drilling rig, so the efficiency of drilling can be improved. In this paper, the difficulties of deep drilling and existing problems of deep drilling rigs are analyzed, and direct drive permanent magnet motor top-driving drilling rig and its parameters and characteristics are introduced. The development of deep borehole permanent-magnet motor direct drive top-driving drilling rig accords with the requirements of drilling technology development and innovation concept, it is the development direction of deep core drill's renewal, will promote the development of geo-drilling technology...|$|R

5000|$|An Impact Sprinkler (sometimes {{called an}} [...] impulse sprinkler) {{is a type}} of {{irrigation}} sprinkler in which the sprinkler <b>head,</b> <b>driven</b> in a circular motion by the force of the outgoing water, pivots on a bearing on top of its threaded attachment nut.

50|$|Another {{significant}} {{development in}} digital puppetry in 1988 was Mike Normal, which Brad DeGraf and partner Michael Wahrman developed {{to show off}} the real-time capabilities of Silicon Graphics' then-new 4D series workstations. Unveiled at the 1988 SIGGRAPH convention, it was the first live performance of a digital character. Mike was a sophisticated talking <b>head</b> <b>driven</b> by a specially built controller that allowed a single puppeteer to control many parameters of the character's face, including mouth, eyes, expression, and head position.|$|R
50|$|This {{new company}} {{made use of}} a shaft sunk in 1873, which had been {{abandoned}} because the <b>heading</b> <b>driven</b> out from that shaft had struck a fault. The Point of Ayr Colliery Company decided to strike out in another direction, where they struck a seam in 1890. The original shaft, of 100 yd, was deepened to 215 yd, and a second shaft was sunk to the same depth - these became known as No. 1 and No. 2 shafts respectively.|$|R
5000|$|A common {{application}} of a torque motor would be the supply- and take-up reel motors in a tape drive. In this application, driven from a low voltage, the characteristics of these motors allow a relatively constant light tension {{to be applied to}} the tape whether or not the capstan is feeding tape past the tape <b>heads.</b> <b>Driven</b> from a higher voltage, (and so delivering a higher torque), the torque motors can also achieve fast-forward and rewind operation without requiring any additional mechanics such as gears or clutches.|$|R

50|$|The small {{removable}} disks store 35, 70, or 120 gigabytes and are hard-drive technology.

The removable disks contained the platter, spindle, and motor, while the <b>drive</b> <b>heads</b> and <b>drive</b> controller are contained within the REV drive. The drives allow for data transfer rates of about 25 megabytes per second.|$|R
