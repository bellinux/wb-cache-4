5|$|According to Keller's conjecture, any tiling of {{the plane}} by {{congruent}} squares must include two squares <b>that</b> <b>meet</b> edge-to-edge. None of the squares in the Pythagorean tiling meet edge-to-edge, but this fact does not violate Keller's conjecture because the tiles have different sizes, so they are not all congruent to each other.|$|E

Gameplay is similar to the single-player mode, but is absent of story-driven quests. The server keeps individual records of the players' progress, and they can resume their game on their next log on to this server. A persistent virtual galaxy is thus maintained for them.|$|E

5|$|A uniform tiling is a tiling {{in which}} each tile is a regular polygon and in which every vertex can be mapped to every other vertex by a {{symmetry}} of the tiling. Usually, uniform tilings additionally are required to have tiles <b>that</b> <b>meet</b> edge-to-edge, but if this requirement is relaxed then there are eight additional uniform tilings. Four are formed from infinite strips of squares or equilateral triangles, and three are formed from equilateral triangles and regular hexagons. The remaining one is the Pythagorean tiling.|$|E

For women, bikini or bikini-style underwear is underwear that is similar in size and form to a regular bikini. It can refer to virtually any undergarment that provides less coverage to the midriff than traditional underwear, panties or knickers, especially suited to clothing such as crop tops. For men, bikini briefs are undergarments that are smaller and more revealing than men's regular briefs. Men's bikini briefs can be low- or high-side that are usually lower than true waist, often at hips, and usually have no access pouch or flap, legs bands at tops of thighs. String bikini briefs have front and rear sections <b>that</b> <b>meet</b> in the crotch {{but not at the}} waistband, with no fabric {{on the side of the}} legs.|$|E
5|$|During the 1980s {{and early}} 1990s, Martin's novels had slowly {{earned him a}} {{reputation}} in science fiction circles, although he said to only have received a few fans' letters {{a year in the}} pre-internet days. The publication of A Game of Thrones caused Martin's following to grow, with fan sites springing up and a Trekkie-like society of followers evolving <b>that</b> <b>meet</b> regularly. Westeros.org, one of the main Ice and Fire fansites with about seventeen thousand registered members as of 2011, was established in 1999 by a Swedish-based fan of Cuban-American descent, Elio M. García, Jr., and his girlfriend; their involvement with Martin's work has now become semi-professional. The Brotherhood Without Banners, an unofficial fan club operating globally, was formed in 2001. Their founders and other longtime members are among Martin's good friends.|$|E
5|$|Kiger Mustangs {{are most}} often dun in color, {{although}} they are found in other solid colors. Compact and well-muscled in appearance, their coloration and phenotype make them {{some of the most}} desired by private buyers when horses are removed from the feral herds. The BLM rounds up the horses from the two herd management areas every three to four years, and auctions excess horses to the public, returning horses to public lands <b>that</b> <b>meet</b> the desired coloration and phenotype and sometimes exchanging horses between the two herds to maintain genetic diversity. Horses in private ownership may be registered in several breed associations, the largest and oldest being the Kiger Mesteño Association, established in 1988.|$|E

5|$|The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences {{has given}} Academy Awards to foreign {{language}} films since 1945. The Academy defines {{a foreign language}} film as a feature-length motion picture produced outside the United States that contains primarily non-English dialogue. Films <b>that</b> <b>meet</b> these criteria are eligible for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. They can be nominated for awards in categories other than Best Foreign Language Film provided {{that they have been}} commercially released in Los Angeles County and comply with the special rules governing those categories.

5|$|The {{combinatorial}} extension (CE) {{method is}} similar to DALI in that it too breaks each structure in the query set {{into a series of}} fragments that it then attempts to reassemble into a complete alignment. A series of pairwise combinations of fragments called aligned fragment pairs, or AFPs, are used to define a similarity matrix through which an optimal path is generated to identify the final alignment. Only AFPs <b>that</b> <b>meet</b> given criteria for local similarity are included in the matrix as a means of reducing the necessary search space and thereby increasing efficiency. A number of similarity metrics are possible; the original definition of the CE method included only structural superpositions and inter-residue distances but has since been expanded to include local environmental properties such as secondary structure, solvent exposure, hydrogen-bonding patterns, and dihedral angles.|$|E

5|$|The {{process of}} pumping {{water from the}} mines {{introduces}} oxygen via aeration, thereby oxidising the rock's pyrite. Pyrite contains sulfur, and one consequence of its oxidation is the introduction of significant amounts of sulphates into mine water. This has had {{a negative impact on}} water quality in five lakes in the Kurtna Lake District. In some lakes, sulphate levels have increased tens of times compared to the pre-mining period. Suspended mineral matter in the mine water pumped into these lakes has changed the composition of the lakes' sediments. However, it has been found that this disturbance diminishes over time; studies show that sulphates and iron in mining water decrease to levels <b>that</b> <b>meet</b> drinking water quality standards about five years after mine closure.|$|E
5|$|The {{studbook}} for the Poitevin {{is based}} in Niort, and the breed {{is the subject of}} a conservation breeding plan, the goal of which is to eventually revive the production of Poitou mules. The conservation plan includes an experimental infusion of blood from the Boulonnais, and is followed by 70 percent of breeders. L'association nationale des races mulassières du Poitou manages the studbook for the Poitevin horse, the Poitou donkey and the Poitou mule, and is recognized by the French Ministry of Agriculture. Its goals are to ensure the selection of breeding stock <b>that</b> <b>meet</b> the physical characteristics expected of the breeds, to maintain the studbooks, and to promote the breeds. There is a breed show held annually in the Poitou region.|$|E

As a Community College, it has expanded its range of vocational programmes, and has become an established part of the community. The college works with local employers to provide training programmes <b>that</b> <b>meet</b> the needs of both employers and employees.
