5|$|The 2003 Pacific typhoon {{season was}} a {{slightly}} below average yearlong period of tropical cyclogenesis exhibiting {{the development of}} 45 tropical depressions, of which 21 became named storms; of those, 14 became typhoons. <b>Though</b> <b>every</b> month {{with the exception of}} February and March featured tropical activity, most storms developed from May through October. During the season, tropical cyclones affected the Philippines, Japan, China, the Korean Peninsula, Indochina, and various islands in the western Pacific.|$|E
5|$|After {{arriving}} in New York, Häyhänen {{spent the next}} two years establishing his identity. During that time he received money from his superiors left in dead-letter boxes in the Bronx and Manhattan. It is known he occasionally drew attention to himself by indulging in heavy drinking sessions and heated arguments with his Finnish wife Hannah. For six months Häyhänen checked the thumbtack and no one had made contact. He also checked a dead-drop location he had memorized. There he found a hollowed-out nickel. However, prior to opening the coin Häyhänen had misplaced it, either buying a newspaper with it or using it as a subway token. For the next seven months the hollow nickel travelled around the New York City economy, unopened. The trail of the hollow nickel ended when a thirteen-year-old newsboy was collecting for his weekly deliveries. The newsboy accidentally dropped the nickel and it broke in half, revealing a microphotograph containing a series of numbers. The newsboy handed the nickel to a New York detective, who in turn forwarded it to the FBI. From 1953 to 1957, <b>though</b> <b>every</b> effort was made to decipher the microphotograph, the FBI was unable to solve the mystery.|$|E

But, when dioceses were divided into parishes, the tithes of each parish were allotted to its own particular minister; first by common consent, or the appointment of lords of manors, and afterwards by the written law of the land.|$|E
25|$|In Virginia, Kentucky and Missouri, {{there were}} both pro-Confederate and pro-Union governments. West Virginia {{was formed in}} 1862–63 after unionists from the northwestern {{counties}} of Virginia then occupied by the Union Army {{had set up a}} loyalist (“restored”) state government of Virginia. Lincoln recognized this government and allowed them to divide the state. <b>Though</b> <b>every</b> slave state except South Carolina contributed white battalions to both the Union and Confederate armies (South Carolina Unionists fought in units from other Union states), the split was most severe in these border states. Sometimes men from the same family fought on opposite sides. About 170,000 border state men (including African Americans) fought in the Union Army and 86,000 in the Confederate Army.|$|E
25|$|The vast {{majority}} of Afghan families were never exposed to this system, {{and many of these}} families were in opposition to these programs due to the belief that it diminishes the central role of the family and inculcates children with Soviet values. With the onset of civil war after the Soviet withdrawal, the number of kindergartens dropped rapidly. By 1995, only 88 functioning facilities serving 2,110 children survived, and the Taliban restrictions on female employment eliminated all of the remaining centers in areas under their control. In 2007, there were about 260 kindergarten/pre-school centers serving over 25,000 children. <b>Though</b> <b>every</b> government center is required to have an early childhood center, at present, no governmental policies deal with early childhood and no institutions have either the responsibility or the capacity to provide such services.|$|E

25|$|<b>Though</b> <b>every</b> {{government}} of the Weimar Republic had violated Part V of Versailles, in 1933 and 1934, the Nazi government had become more flagrant and open in violating Part V. In 1933, the Germans started to build their first U-boats since World War I, and in April 1935, launched their first U-boats. On 25 April 1935, the British Naval attaché to Germany, Captain Gerard Muirhead-Gould was officially informed by Captain Leopold Bürkner of the Reichsmarine that Germany had laid down twelve 250 ton U-boats at Kiel. On 29 April 1935, the Foreign Secretary Sir John Simon informed the British House of Commons that Germany was now building U-boats. On 2 May 1935, the Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald told the House of his government's intention to reach a naval pact to regulate the future growth of the German Navy.|$|E

25|$|As {{the walls}} {{carrying}} these vaults were also built in concrete with occasional bond courses of brick, the whole structure was homogeneous. One {{of the important}} ingredients of the mortar was a volcanic deposit found near Rome, known as pozzolana, which, when the concrete had set, not only made the concrete as solid as the rock itself, but {{to a certain extent}} neutralized the thrust of the vaults, which formed shells equivalent to that of a metal lid; the Romans, however, do not seem to have recognized the value of this pozzolana mixture, for they otherwise provided amply for the counteracting of any thrust which might exist by the erection of cross walls and buttresses. In the tepidaria of the Thermae and in the basilica of Constantine, in order to bring the thrust well within the walls, the main barrel vault of the hall was brought forward on each side and rested on detached columns, which constituted the principal architectural decoration. In cases where the cross vaults intersecting were not of the same span as those of the main vault, the arches were either stilted so that their soffits might be of the same height, or they formed smaller intersections in {{the lower part of the}} vault; in both of these cases, however, the intersections or groins were twisted, for which it was very difficult to form a centering, and, moreover, they were of disagreeable effect: <b>though</b> <b>every</b> attempt was made to mask this in the decoration of the vault by panels and reliefs modelled in stucco.|$|E

[...] Greg Daniels noted that during the filming of [...] "The Fire", {{the cast and crew}} kept being interrupted by the sound of helicopters. [...] The firemen in the scene were played by actual firemen. The crew of The Office had someone in Scranton take photographs of local firefighters' uniforms, so the costumes would be accurate.

To pass the time, Skinner plays his professed favourite film, a very low-budget, long-running, 1938 holiday film called The Christmas That Almost Wasn't, But Then Was, which Lisa notices has {{very little to do with}} Christmas. By the time the movie is finally over, it is already the end of the school day, and Skinner lets the kids go home--however, Skinner and the students quickly realize that over the course of the day, the snow has piled up tremendously, leaving them and Groundskeeper Willie trapped inside the school, much to the horror of the kids.|$|E

Additional drawings depict nests, feathers, and details of bird anatomy including feet, breastbones, and windpipes. Simon Holloway suggests that Fussell and the engravers Charles Thompson and sons probably made all the illustrations {{for the first three}} editions of Yarrell's Birds. Only in the fourth, rewritten edition of 1871–85 were illustrations by other artists (Charles Whymper, J. G. Keulemans, Edward Neale) added. Some of the bird figures, such as [...] "The Snowy Owl" [...] and [...] "Richard's Pipit" [...] in Volume 1, are signed [...] "A. FUSSEL DEL." [...] (A. Fussel drew this), but most are entirely unsigned. Some few, such as [...] "The Black Redstart" [...] and [...] "The Common Cuckoo", are signed [...] "THOMPSON DEL ET SC." [...] (Thompson drew and cut this), so in these cases Fussell was not involved.|$|E
500|$|In 1973, DEC {{commissioned}} {{the creation of}} a real-time, graphical version of Lunar Lander, which was intended to showcase the capabilities of their new DEC GT40 graphics terminals. The game, which was written by Jack Burness and named Moonlander, was distributed with DEC computers and displayed at trade shows. An arcade game version of the game concept was released as Lunar Lander in 1979 by Atari, which featured a fuel-for-money system allowing the player to purchase more fuel to continue their current game. Other versions of the graphical game were released for various systems, including Jupiter Lander for the Commodore 64, Retrofire for Atari 8-bit computers, and Apollo 11 for the ZX Spectrum. Critics have claimed that the text-based version of the game was the most popular computer game of its time, and so many versions of the graphical game exist that in 1981 Electronic Games claimed: [...] "sometimes it seems as <b>though</b> <b>every</b> company capable of copying a cassette is trying to sell a game on this theme." ...|$|E

[...] The shops closed for two weeks, as did the Royal Exchange, the Law Courts, and the docks. [...] Even gambling dens shut down {{on the day of}} her funeral, as a mark of respect. [...] Wrote The Times, [...] "It certainly does not belong to us to repine at the visitations of Providence... there is nothing impious in grieving for that as a calamity." [...] Mourning was so complete that the makers of ribbons and other fancy goods (which could not be worn during the period of mourning) petitioned the government to shorten the period, fearing they would otherwise go bankrupt. [...] A dissenting note was struck by poet Percy Bysshe Shelley, who in his An Address to the People on the Death of the Princess Charlotte, indicated that the execution of three men the day after the Princess's death for plotting to overthrow the government was a greater tragedy.|$|E
