5|$|As {{early as}} 1926, Meyer {{had written to}} Irène Joliot-Curie {{suggesting}} that Rona work with her to learn how his laboratory could make their own polonium samples. Once Hans Pettersson was able to secure funds to pay Rona's expenses, Joliot-Curie allowed her to come and study polonium separation at the Curie Institute in Paris. Rona developed an enhanced method of preparing polonium sources and producing alpha-emissions.(α-emission). Gaining recognition as {{an expert in the}} field, she took <b>those</b> <b>skills</b> back to the Radium Institute along with a small disc of polonium. This disc allowed Rona to create lab specimens of polonium, which were used in much of the Institute's subsequent research.|$|E

They associate and work directly with adults as partners, but the crew is led by elected youth officers who are given opportunities to learn and apply leadership skills. Venturers plan and participate in interdependent group experiences dependent on cooperation. An emphasis on high adventure provides opportunities for team-building and practical leadership applications. A series of awards provide opportunities for recognition and personal growth. Each award requires the Venturer to teach {{what they have learned}} to others returning the skill and knowledge back to the community and enabling the Venturer to master <b>those</b> <b>skills.</b>|$|E

The course work for the minor emphasizes the history and emergence of the non-profit sector as a national institution distinct from the private and public spheres. The practicum aspects of the minor couples with the traditional academic work encourages students to see the connection between the deeds of charitable service and the historic worth of citizens participation in the common public franchise.|$|E
25|$|Diver {{training}} {{can be divided}} into entry level training, which are <b>those</b> <b>skills</b> and knowledge considered essential for the diver to dive unsupervised at an acceptably low level of risk by the certifying agency, and further skills and knowledge which allow better performance and extend the environmental capacity of the diver. There is a significant variation in entry level training, with some training agencies requiring the bare minimum as specified by RSTC and ISO, and others requiring a greater level of competence with associated assumption of lower risk to the diver and dive buddy. Entry level training may include skills for assisting or rescue of another diver, but this is not always the case. Divers without rescue training are routinely assigned to dive as buddy pairs to follow organizational protocols. This is not generally a contravention of the training agencies' recommendations.|$|E
25|$|The Faculty of Pharmacy at the University of Toronto {{began in}} 1853, when the Ontario College of Pharmacy (now Pharmacists) who first {{operated}} {{at the school}} had merged into the school curriculum. By 1868, the pharmacy program consisted {{of only a few}} evenings of voluntary classes, with no practically prerequisite classes. However, the long, tradition apprenticeship of this professional field had pressed a strong emphasis onto the students. Today, the program has evolved into “a compulsory, four-year second-entry scientific and professional university course with a supervised period of professional practice.” The organization of this program has become significantly more structured. This change in focus strayed away from the predominant emphasis of the practice of training through an apprenticeship to today’s emphasis of a theoretical study and application of <b>those</b> <b>skills</b> in real-life situations. Students are better equipped with the skills which are required to meet the present needs of the profession. The University of Toronto was the only school in Ontario to offer a pharmacy education until the opening of the University of Waterloo School of Pharmacy in 2008.|$|E

Bánáthy contacted research psychologist Paul Hood, Task Leader of Task NCO (Non-commissioned Officer), and began a fruitful collaboration. A HumRRO publication titled, A Guide for the Infantry Squad Leader – What the Beginning Squad Leader Should Know About Human Relations defined a core set of leadership competencies.

Despite {{the fact that the}} breed is indigenous to the country, cavalry units of the Indian military make little use of the horses, although they are popular in the Jodhpur and Jaipur areas of Rajasthan, India. They are particularly suited to dressage, in part due to a natural tendency to perform. Marwaris are also used to play polo, sometimes playing against Thoroughbreds. Within the Marwari breed was a strain known as the Natchni, believed by local people to be [...] "born to dance". Decorated in silver, jewels, and bells, these horses were trained to perform complex prancing and leaping movements at many ceremonies, including weddings.

[...] When discussing her career, Anderson was quite clear about where her duties lay: [...] "When I was married, and writing at home (writing was my second job; my first was the house) ...
