5|$|Academic affairs are {{overseen by}} the Academic Council, which is formed of {{seventeen}} members: The rector, the general secretary, the vice-rectors for Academics, Administrative Affairs, Research, and University Welfare; the deans of the eight faculties; {{the directors of the}} two institutes and the offices of Planning and Regionalisation; two representatives for <b>the</b> <b>professors,</b> one representative for academic programs, and two representatives for the students.|$|E
5|$|Each {{academic}} division, either faculty or institute, has {{a directive}} council. These include the dean or director, the vice-deans or sub-directors of academics and research, {{the academic and}} administrative coordinators, the director of each school, department, or area; and a representative for <b>the</b> <b>professors</b> and for the students. Also, each division has an extension and communication office. The research centers or institutes affiliated to the academic divisions are independent organizations {{at the same level}} as the schools, departments, or areas.|$|E
5|$|In the 1850s, {{the student}} bodies of Rutgers College and the Seminary began to expand, {{overcrowding}} the space provided at the Queens Campus. The seminary professors realized that students renting rooms at boarding {{houses in the}} city were paying more for their housing than students at other seminaries—over double the costs of housing at New York City's Union Theological Seminary or at nearby Princeton Theological Seminary. <b>The</b> <b>professors</b> surmised {{that it would be}} cheaper to build a seminary building that provided both student housing and instruction space.|$|E

50|$|Ghote revisits Bedekar {{who claims}} {{that before the}} Raja was shot he {{discovered}} one of his racehorses was of good enough quality to win the next derby, which means he has no motive for the murder. By a process of elimination Ghote realises that Professor Rustom Engineer is the only suspect left. He visits <b>the</b> <b>professor's</b> home again and interviews <b>the</b> <b>professor's</b> brother. <b>The</b> <b>professor's</b> brother denies <b>the</b> <b>professor's</b> alibi but also undermines <b>the</b> <b>professor's</b> motive. <b>The</b> <b>professor's</b> research had gone down a blind alley decades ago and {{he was too old}} to start again, so secretly <b>the</b> <b>professor</b> welcomed <b>the</b> excuse to abandon his work.|$|R
50|$|Sister-in-law of <b>the</b> <b>Professor</b> (wife of <b>the</b> <b>Professor's</b> brother). Initially, she {{fired the}} Housekeeper for {{disregarding}} the employment contract rules (bringing her child into a client's home, staying past her assigned hours) and accused the Housekeeper's affection {{as an attempt}} to extort money from <b>the</b> <b>Professor.</b> However, after <b>the</b> <b>Professor</b> writes down Euler's formula during this confrontation, the Widow immediately comes to accept the Housekeeper and Root. She cannot walk well, which the Housekeeper later discovers was a result of her being in the same auto accident as <b>the</b> <b>Professor.</b> While browsing through <b>the</b> <b>Professor's</b> baseball card collection in the cookie tin, the Housekeeper discovers an old photograph of a younger Professor and his sister-in-law. It is hinted that perhaps long ago <b>the</b> <b>Professor</b> and his sister-in-law once had romantic feelings for each other.|$|R
5|$|Linnaeus {{entered the}} Växjö Katedralskola in 1724, {{where he studied}} mainly Greek, Hebrew, {{theology}} and mathematics, a curriculum designed for boys preparing for the priesthood. In the {{last year at the}} gymnasium, Linnaeus' father visited to ask <b>the</b> <b>professors</b> how his son's studies were progressing; to his dismay, most said that the boy would never become a scholar. Rothman believed otherwise, suggesting Linnaeus could have a future in medicine. The doctor offered to have Linnaeus live with his family in Växjö and to teach him physiology and botany. Nils accepted this offer.|$|E
5|$|The {{teaching}} {{center at}} the mosque also suffered. The once well stocked library at al-Azhar was neglected, and manuscripts of Fatimid teachings that were held at al-Azhar were destroyed. The Ayyubid dynasty promoted the teaching of Sunni theology in subsidized madrasas (schools) built throughout Cairo. Student funding was withdrawn, organized classes were no longer held at the mosque, and <b>the</b> <b>professors</b> that had prospered under the Fatimids were forced to find other means to earn their living.|$|E
5|$|Grassi's {{arguments}} and conclusions were criticised {{in a subsequent}} article, Discourse on Comets, published {{under the name of}} one of Galileo's disciples, a Florentine lawyer named Mario Guiducci, although it had been largely written by Galileo himself. Galileo and Guiducci offered no definitive theory of their own on the nature of comets although they did present some tentative conjectures that are now known to be mistaken. In its opening passage, Galileo and Guiducci's Discourse gratuitously insulted the Jesuit Christopher Scheiner, and various uncomplimentary remarks about <b>the</b> <b>professors</b> of the Collegio Romano were scattered throughout the work. The Jesuits were offended, and Grassi soon replied with a polemical tract of his own, The Astronomical and Philosophical Balance, under the pseudonym Lothario Sarsio Sigensano, purporting to be one of his own pupils.|$|E
50|$|The Professor/Simon Judeau (Mike Pollock): <b>The</b> <b>Professor</b> is {{a former}} member of the Huntik Foundation and the founder of the Organization. After a mission with Eathon Lambert, Lok's father, Simon, was cursed and his body mangled. <b>The</b> <b>Professor</b> is <b>the</b> only one who knew what {{happened}} to Eathon. Due to his time as a team with Eathon Lambert, <b>the</b> <b>Professor</b> named his dog Eathon after his old friend. During season 1, <b>the</b> <b>Professor</b> was <b>the</b> leader of <b>the</b> Organization. <b>The</b> <b>Professor</b> was defeated by the Huntik team.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>professor</b> seized <b>the</b> {{opportunity}} to do some work by packing books. <b>The</b> <b>professor,</b> though strict and harsh in attitude, treated him with interest as he offered some chewing gum. Young-min rejected (politely) and <b>the</b> <b>professor</b> went on to play some classical music. Young-min looked on and smiled before he proceed onto his work. Before he left, Young-min accidentally dropped <b>the</b> <b>Professor's</b> saxophone, and was being reprimanded.|$|R
50|$|In {{recent years}} a Queer reading of <b>The</b> <b>Professor’s</b> House has emerged. This reading centers on <b>the</b> <b>professor’s</b> {{relationship}} with Tom, {{as well as}} Tom’s relationship with his idolized friend Roddy. Through Tom’s youthful influence, <b>the</b> <b>professor</b> achieves a sort of procreation—his work comes forth more easily and fluidly. “Tom represents <b>the</b> <b>Professor’s</b> need to live with delight.” For <b>the</b> <b>professor,</b> Tom’s loss also represents <b>the</b> <b>professor’s</b> forgoing of homoerotic desire and along with it, a life “without delight... without joy, without passionate grief”. Tom and Roddy share a deeply intimate experience of discovery. Tom views Roddy’s selling of the find as a betrayal, and they experience a split with characteristics of a romantic rift.|$|R
5|$|In February 1952, Baxter became deputy-director of the university. He {{defeated}} Arthur Denning in {{an election}} for director in December, assuming the position on 1 January 1953. As Denning had argued for the retention of the university's links with the Public Service Board, it was widely seen as {{a victory for the}} proponents of autonomy, but with his industrial background Baxter had little in common with <b>the</b> <b>professors</b> who came from academia, and did not share their views on the role and organisation of a university. The university did receive autonomy on 1 July 1954, and when traditional university titles were adopted in 1955, Baxter became vice-chancellor.|$|E
5|$|Several other book {{collections}} {{were lost}} as well. Professor Mathias Anchersen {{made the mistake}} of bringing his possessions to safety in Trinitatis Church. Árni Magnússon lost all his books, notes and records, but did manage to rescue his valuable collection of handwritten Icelandic manuscripts. At Borchs Kollegium 3,150volumes burned along with its Museum Rarirorum containing collections of zoological and botanical oddities. The burned out observatory in Rundetårn had contained instruments and records by Tycho Brahe and Ole Rømer. <b>The</b> <b>professors</b> Horrebow, Steenbuch and the two Bartholins lost practically everything. And {{on top of all that}} a large part of the city archive of records burnt along with city hall.|$|E
5|$|The {{succeeding}} year, {{the only}} time since 1851, the school did not hold a commencement. Members of the senior class had decided {{to make fun of}} <b>the</b> <b>professors</b> in the Green Bag—City College's year book since 1896. When the school board was alerted of the matter, it attempted to censor the edition, passing a resolution requiring the Green Bag to be reviewed by Principal Francis A. Soper. However, the year book had already been printed, and the editors refused to have the edition censored and reprinted. The school board responded by withholding the diplomas of six of the editors of the Green Bag and the business manager, and by preventing the school from holding a commencement ceremony. One of the boys expelled, Clarence Keating Bowie, {{became a member of the}} school board in 1926.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>professor</b> {{proceeds}} to relate how he outsmarted and captured Woody. In a forest, he hears Woody pecking {{away at a}} tree. He gets up and catches Woody, who bops <b>the</b> <b>professor</b> {{with a mixture of}} Tabasco and chili powder. With a roar, <b>the</b> revived <b>professor</b> expels <b>the</b> mixture, which hits a tree and reduces it to ashes. <b>The</b> <b>professor</b> then employs various ways and means to capture Woody. He finally traps Woody in a cage, and we see both of them in the taxidermy shop, with Woody on <b>the</b> pedestal. <b>The</b> <b>professor</b> says, [...] "Right." [...] Woody's still alive and pecking away, this time at <b>the</b> <b>professor.</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Professor's</b> {{housekeeper}} and {{a single}} mother. She was hired by <b>the</b> <b>Professor's</b> sister-in-law through <b>the</b> housekeeping agency and is the tenth housekeeper <b>the</b> <b>Professor</b> has gone through. She initially feels frustration at <b>the</b> <b>Professor,</b> who shows interest only in mathematics, but through observing <b>the</b> <b>Professor's</b> kindness and his passion for mathematics, comes to feel respect and affection for him. She first manages to connect with <b>the</b> <b>Professor</b> when he discovers that her birthday is February 20 (220), which is an amicable number with the number 284, which is imprinted {{on the underside of}} his watch, which he received as the University President's Award for a thesis he wrote in university on transcendental number theory. She cannot pronounce the title of the Journal of Mathematics (to which <b>the</b> <b>Professor</b> submits contest entries) very well, so she refers to it as [...] "Jaanaru obu." [...] Towards {{the end of the novel}} and at a pivotal point in the story, she and Root give <b>the</b> <b>Professor</b> a rare baseball card of Yutaka Enatsu as a congratulatory present.|$|R
50|$|Young-min {{stood at}} the door, and walked forward. He waited until <b>the</b> <b>professor</b> {{finished}} his tune, before asking for permission to search for his wallet. <b>The</b> <b>professor,</b> seeing <b>the</b> situation, showed him the wallet. Young-min heaved {{a sigh of relief}} and thanked <b>the</b> <b>professor.</b>|$|R
5|$|At a {{young age}} he {{witnessed}} the Kraków revolution of 1846 and the 1848 siege of Kraków by the Austrians, the two events which ended {{the existence of the}} Free City of Kraków. His two older brothers served in these battles, under General Józef Bem; one died and the other was forced into exile. Matejko attended St. Ann's High School, but he dropped out in 1851 because of poor grades. From his earliest days Matejko showed artistic talent, but had great difficulty with other academic areas. He never mastered a foreign language. Despite that, and because of his exceptional skill, he studied at the School of Fine Arts in Kraków from 1852 to 1858. His teachers included Wojciech Korneli Stattler and Władysław Łuszczkiewicz. He selected historical painting as his specialization, and finished his first major work, Tsars Shuyski before Zygmunt III (Carowie Szujscy przed Zygmuntem III), in 1853 (he would return to this topic in a year before his death, in 1892). During this time, he began exhibiting historical paintings at the Kraków Society of Friends of Fine Arts (starting with 1855). His seminal project for his graduation in 1858 was Sigismund I the Old ennobles <b>the</b> <b>professors</b> of the Jagiellonian University (Zygmunt I nadaje szlachectwo profesorom Uniwersytetu Jagiellońskiego).|$|E
5|$|Heilmann's {{original}} {{articles were}} publicly ignored by Danish zoologists, but caused considerable unrest behind the scenes. Danish zoologist R.H. Stamm, for example, mocked Heilmann in private letters to Helms {{shortly after the}} publication of his first article. Other Danish zoologists openly expressed their disdain for Heilmann's work as well, including <b>the</b> <b>professors</b> of zoology in Copenhagen University J.E.V. Boas and Hector Jungersen. Despite this, Helms continued to steadfastly support Heilmann and his ideas, which eventually began to gain attention from abroad. In April 1913, the American expert in fossil birds R. W. Shufeldt came across Heilmann's first article by chance. Shufeldt, who was married to a Norwegian, could understand some Danish and was able to interpret Heilmann's work and initiated contact with him shortly thereafter. This opened up the opportunity for international correspondence with distinguished paleontologists for Heilmann, which was instrumental to the recognition of his work outside of Denmark.|$|E
5|$|In 1541 the Congregation elected Vermigli to the {{important}} post of prior of Basilica of San Frediano in Lucca. The prior at San Frediano exercised some episcopal authority {{over half the}} city, as well as control of the Lateran's religious houses. As at his earlier post in Spoleto, the monks of the San Frediano monastery {{as well as the}} clergy of Lucca were known for moral laxity, which led to an openness to the new Lutheran religion there. Vermigli saw his task as one of education as well as moral correction. He set up a college based on humanist principles of education and modeled on the newly founded St John's College, Cambridge, and Corpus Christi College, Oxford. Instruction was in Greek, Latin, and Hebrew. Among <b>the</b> <b>professors</b> were the humanists Immanuel Tremellius, Paolo Lacizi, Celio Secondo Curione, and Girolamo Zanchi, all of whom would later convert to Protestantism. The Congregation recognized Vermigli's work by appointing him to a disciplinary commission of seven canons in May 1542.|$|E

When his friend cannot be found (and is later revealed to have died), <b>the</b> <b>Professor</b> clumsily attempts {{to find his way}} around the town. He tries to engage with the qaouaji of the old cafe, but repeatedly and inadvertently insults him with his cultural aloofness. <b>The</b> <b>Professor</b> finally requests to buy some novelty camel-udder boxes. This offends the qaouaji but <b>the</b> <b>Professor</b> reasserts his position offering him money. The qaouaji leads <b>the</b> <b>Professor</b> through <b>the</b> desert night and ultimately {{into the hands of the}} Reguibat.At this point, the story takes a sharp narrative turn. <b>The</b> <b>Professor</b> is beaten badly and has his tongue cut out. He is turned into a toy of amusement for the Reguibat who cover him in metal and make him dance and mumble incoherently. The narration loses all of <b>the</b> <b>Professor's</b> perspective and gains all of the Reguibat people's. <b>The</b> <b>Professor</b> is deprived of human contact, language, or standard treatment for a year.In the final act, <b>the</b> <b>professor</b> is sold, refuses to perform for his new owner, and escapes after the new owner kills a Reguibat for cheating him.
