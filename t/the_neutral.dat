5|$|<b>The</b> <b>neutral</b> {{theory of}} {{molecular}} evolution proposed that most evolutionary changes {{are the result}} of the fixation of neutral mutations by genetic drift.

This form of <b>the</b> <b>neutral</b> theory is now largely abandoned, since {{it does not seem to}} fit the genetic variation seen in nature. However, a more recent and better-supported version of this model is the nearly neutral theory, where a mutation that would be effectively neutral in a small population is not necessarily neutral in a large population. Other alternative theories propose that genetic drift is dwarfed by other stochastic forces in evolution, such as genetic hitchhiking, also known as genetic draft.|$|E

Under the assumptions that <b>the</b> <b>neutrals</b> arise through sputtering by corotating torus ions, and that the ions move radially by centrifugally driven diffusion, {{it is found that}} the equilibrium state properties of the Io torus depend on two quantities: the sputtering yield, and Jupiter's ionospheric Pedersen conductance. For fixed values of these quantities, the torus equilibrium state is stable. When <b>the</b> torus <b>neutral</b> and ion densities deviate from the equilibrium state, the perturbations decay without oscillating, with a decay time near 1 day for <b>the</b> <b>neutrals</b> and near 60 days for the ions. The growths of <b>the</b> <b>neutrals</b> and ions from seed populations are computed. The torus evolves directly to its equilibrium state...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} method for {{generating}} cold neutral atoms via charge exchange reactions between trapped ions and Rydberg positronium.

When the original ions are cold <b>the</b> reaction produces <b>neutrals</b> that can be trapped or further manipulated with electromagnetic fields.

In this theory, the weak interaction acts only on left-handed particles (and right-handed antiparticles). Since the mirror reflection of a left-handed particle is right-handed, this explains the maximal violation of parity.
