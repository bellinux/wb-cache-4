5|$|<b>The</b> <b>neutral</b> {{theory of}} {{molecular}} evolution proposed that most evolutionary changes {{are the result}} of the fixation of neutral mutations by genetic drift.

This form of <b>the</b> <b>neutral</b> theory is now largely abandoned, since {{it does not seem to}} fit the genetic variation seen in nature. However, a more recent and better-supported version of this model is the nearly neutral theory, where a mutation that would be effectively neutral in a small population is not necessarily neutral in a large population. Other alternative theories propose that genetic drift is dwarfed by other stochastic forces in evolution, such as genetic hitchhiking, also known as genetic draft.|$|E

Under the assumptions that <b>the</b> <b>neutrals</b> arise through sputtering by corotating torus ions, and that the ions move radially by centrifugally driven diffusion, {{it is found that}} the equilibrium state properties of the Io torus depend on two quantities: the sputtering yield, and Jupiter's ionospheric Pedersen conductance. For fixed values of these quantities, the torus equilibrium state is stable. When <b>the</b> torus <b>neutral</b> and ion densities deviate from the equilibrium state, the perturbations decay without oscillating, with a decay time near 1 day for <b>the</b> <b>neutrals</b> and near 60 days for the ions. The growths of <b>the</b> <b>neutrals</b> and ions from seed populations are computed. The torus evolves directly to its equilibrium state...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} method for {{generating}} cold neutral atoms via charge exchange reactions between trapped ions and Rydberg positronium. The high charge exchange reaction cross section leads to efficient neutralisation of the ions and since the positronium-ion mass ratio is small, <b>the</b> <b>neutrals</b> do not gain appreciable kinetic energy in the process. When the original ions are cold <b>the</b> reaction produces <b>neutrals</b> that can be trapped or further manipulated with electromagnetic fields.

In this theory, the weak interaction acts only on left-handed particles (and right-handed antiparticles). Since the mirror reflection of a left-handed particle is right-handed, this explains the maximal violation of parity.
