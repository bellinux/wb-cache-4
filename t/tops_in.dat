Greinke was named American League(AL) Pitcher of the Month for April, his five wins, 0.50 ERA and 44 strikeouts all <b>tops</b> <b>in</b> the Majors.

5|$|An {{unexpected}} {{period of}} rapid deepening began early on September30 as a well-defined eye became clearly visible on satellite imagery. Ophelia intensified into a Category2 hurricane with winds of 100mph (155km/h) by 0600UTC {{and became the}} season's third major hurricane—a Category3 or higher on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale—twelve hours later. Cloud tops continued to cool in the system's eyewall late on October1, with cloud <b>tops</b> <b>in</b> {{the eye of the}} system warming. Ophelia intensified into a Category4 hurricane at 0000UTC on October2 and simultaneously attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 140mph (220km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 940mb (hPa; 27.76inHg) as it passed east of Bermuda. Weakening ensued the following day as the hurricane entered cooler sea surface temperatures and an environment characterized by significantly more stable air. Ophelia weakened below major hurricane intensity by 1800UTC and became a tropical storm for the final time by 0600UTC on October3. The system lost its tropical characteristics and was subsequently declared an extratropical cyclone four hours later while positioned just southwest of Newfoundland. The extratropical low was absorbed by a larger weather system by the afternoon hours of the following day.|$|E

5|$|Banding {{features}} and outflow continued to develop as {{a ring of}} convection formed around the center of Fabian, and on August 30, the storm intensified into a hurricane while gradually slowing its motion to the west-northwest. As banding {{features and}} outflow became better defined, an eye developed {{in the center of}} the deepest convection. Fabian quickly strengthened and attained major hurricane status late that day. Deep convection became very concentric around the 11.5mile (18.5km) wide eye, and the hurricane reached winds of 125mph (205km/h) early on August 31. At this time, the deepest convection near the eye degraded in appearance, and Fabian temporarily stopped its strengthening trend. Later that day, the eye became distinct again within a perfectly round area of deep convection. Outflow continued to expand in all directions, and Fabian intensified into a Category 4 hurricane late on August 31. Thunderstorm activity near the eyewall became more intense, and the cloud <b>tops</b> <b>in</b> the eyewall became much cooler; simultaneously, outflow away from the eye became much more symmetrical, both signs of an intensifying tropical cyclone. Fabian reached its peak intensity of 145mph (230km/h) on September 1 while located 345miles (555km) east of the northern Lesser Antilles.|$|E
5|$|For {{those who}} were not injured or killed {{outright}} by moving objects, there was little time to reach safety, especially for the men who were manning the guns on the main deck or fetching ammunition and supplies in the hold. The companionways that connected the decks with one another would have become bottlenecks for fleeing men, something indicated by the positioning of many of the skeletons recovered from the wreck. What turned the sinking into a major tragedy in terms of lives lost was the anti-boarding netting that covered the upper decks in the waist (the midsection of the ship) and the sterncastle. With the exception of the men who were stationed in the <b>tops</b> <b>in</b> the masts, most of those who managed to get up from below deck were trapped under the netting; they would have been in view of the surface, and their colleagues above, but with little or no chance to break through, and were dragged down with the ship.

5|$|There is archaeological {{evidence}} that Native Americans {{had been using}} the area for at least 8,500 years before present, and had been present at Cascade Pass for at least 9,600 years. Wild game was apparently utilized by Native Americans, and obsidian was exploited since at least 5,000 years before present. They used several routes that passed through the region, and may have used its natural resources during the summer. Some tribes personified the mountains and incorporated them into their religions. Many of these routes followed ridge <b>tops</b> <b>in</b> {{order to avoid the}} dense brush and avalanche chutes of the valley bottoms. Horses were also used in the eighteenth century. There was a trail used by Native Americans as a route between Lake Chelan and the Suiattle River valley. The trail apparently traversed Cloudy Pass, which is some distance east of the lake. It was later used by miners and shepherds in the early 1900s. Shepherding was banned on Miners Ridge in 1940, but the popularity of the area continued to grow. Due to the area's popularity, the surrounding meadows deteriorated as a result of livestock grazing and off-trail hiking. As a result, livestock were allocated to the nearby Lady Camp Basin and hardier plants were introduced to the area surrounding the lake.|$|E

25|$|Clouds of this {{structure}} have both cumuliform and stratiform characteristics {{in the form}} of rolls, ripples, or patches. They generally form as a result of limited convection in an otherwise mostly stable airmass topped by an inversion layer. If the inversion layer is absent or higher in the troposphere, increased convective activity may cause the cloud layers to develop <b>tops</b> <b>in</b> the form of turrets consisting of embedded cumuliform buildups. The stratocumuliform group is divided into cirrocumulus (high-level), altocumulus (mid-level), and stratocumulus (low-level).|$|E
