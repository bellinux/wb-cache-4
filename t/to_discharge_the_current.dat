40|$|Outcome of cardio-pulmonary {{resuscitation}} in post-operative cardiac {{children in}} ICU setup has changed markedly {{in the last}} 20  years. The {{purpose of the study}} is to look for the current causes, practice and outcome of CPR in post-operative children within PCICU setup. Methods: we conducted retrospective review study of all children who had cardio pulmonary arrest (CPA) after cardiac surgery in PCICU of KAMC during 2012 – 2013. We looked for the causes, circumstances, duration of resuscitation and time to return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) after arrest and outcome. Results: During this study, of the 758 post-operative children admitted to the PCICU. 15 patients (2 %) had 19 episodes of Cardio-Pulmonary Arrests. 9 / 19 (47 %) arrests were due to arrhythmia. The age of the patients ranged from 15 day to 14 years (median of 10 months). Cardiac arrest occurred during procedure in 5 cases (26 %). One Patient (7 %) had open cardiac message. Median arrests time occurred on the 5 th post-operative days. Of the 19 arrests episodes in 15 patients 16 / 19 (84 %) were successfully resuscitated to ROSC and 12 / 15 patients (80 %) survived to discharge from hospital with average follow up of 5. 8  ±  1. 25  months. Conclusions: The current outcome of cardio-pulmonary arrest in post-operative cardiac children has improved. Majority of cardiac arrest were successfully resuscitated with ROSC and 80 % survived <b>to</b> <b>discharge.</b> <b>The</b> <b>current</b> result reflects significant improvement in the reported outcome of children who had cardio-pulmonary arrest in post-operative cardiac children in PCICU setup...|$|E

The proposed oscillation model based on the experimental results demonstrated that the momentum transfer corresponding to a plasma fluctuation is crucial to achieving stability. Thus, the oscillation amplitude for various acceleration channel configurations — parallel and convergent — was measured, because channel configuration could affect the momentum transfer.

40|$|Three {{cylindrical}} applied-field magnetoplasmadynamic thrusters {{were tested}} with argon propellant over {{a broad range}} of operating conditions to establish empirical scaling laws for thruster performance. Argon flow rates, discharge currents, and applied-field strengths were varied between 0. 025 and 0. 14 g/s, 750 to 2000 A, and 0. 034 to 0. 20 T, respectively. The results showed that the thrust reached over five times the self-field value, and that thrust increased linearly with <b>the</b> product of <b>discharge</b> <b>current</b> and applied-field strength and quadratically with the anode radius. While increasing the propellant flow rate increased the thrust, it did not affect the rate of thrust increase with applied-field strength, and at low propellant flow rates the self-field thrust approached 30 percent of the measured thrust. The voltage increased linearly with applied-field strength but was insensitive <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>discharge</b> <b>current.</b> <b>The</b> rate of voltage increase with applied-field strength dependent on anode radius. Thruster efficiency increased monotonically with applied-field strength and propellant flow rate. Peak thruster efficiencies were insensitive to changes in anode radius.

The generated carriers then forward bias the source-base junction, and turns on the parasitic bipolar junction transistor to dissipate the ESD charge.

It begins with the preliminary work of several scientists during the last decades, making {{a detailed analysis of}} different approaches for modelling all the stages in a full <b>discharge.</b> <b>The</b> relations between these models are identified as well as the effect on the outcome when modifying some important input parameters. The general concept describing <b>the</b> <b>discharge</b> phenomenon usually includes three main elements: the streamer inception, the streamer-to-leader transition and the stable leader propagation.

The models are usually simplified by assigning experimentally determined values to physical constants pertinent to different stages of <b>the</b> full <b>discharge.</b> These constants are the potential gradient in the leader-corona region to sustain the leader propagation, the charge per unit length along the leader channel which depends on the atmospheric conditions and the voltage impulse wave shape; and the leader propagation velocity, which is closely related <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>discharge</b> <b>current.</b> <b>The</b> dissertation includes the results of laboratory work related the study of leaders in long gap discharges, electrical parameters and optical records.
