For the record, it's my least favorite quality and it doesn't lead anywhere. Nobody in life gets exactly what they thought <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get.</b> But if you work really hard and you're kind, amazing things will happen. I'm telling you, amazing things will happen.|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} in a new recording studio built in a warehouse in Northridge, California, named Studio 606 West {{in contrast to the}} original Studio 606 in Grohl's basement in Alexandria, Virginia. Development for In Your Honor took nine months with three and a half months installing equipment in the studio, and songs being written throughout 2004. While waiting for 606 to get finished, the band rehearsed on North Hollywood's Mates Rehearsal Studios, where [...] "we ended up with three or four different versions of about 30 songs", according to Raskulinecz who added that [...] "it {{got to the point where}} I didn't want them to play the rock songs anymore. I was afraid <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> stale." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{preparation}} for the 13 January 1945 attack on Foy, Belgium, E Company {{was attached to the}} 3rd Battalion, 506th PIR. Division Headquarters ordered the attack to begin at 0900 hours. During the assault, Dike led Easy Company forward and ordered 1st platoon to the left, then lost contact with the platoon. Dike ordered the remainder of the company to take cover after coming under fire. With the unit unable to proceed, his subordinates informed him <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> killed because they were [...] At the same time, Winters tried radioing him to tell him the same thing.|$|E
6000|$|In {{an instant}} the whole hideous, {{incredible}} truth flashed wildly across my bewildered brain. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> sacrifice Kea to this hateful god! <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> fling {{her into the}} mouth of the crater! <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> offer her up in marriage to the son of Pélé! ...|$|R

2500|$|Laura Morgan of All About Soap {{believed}} Amber {{was better}} suited to Daniel than Josh, as she had [...] "way better chemistry" [...] with him. Morgan said, [...] "from the minute she clapped eyes on Scott and Charlene's sexy son, it was clear <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> it on. It definitely didn't take them long either." [...] During {{a review of the}} year, Digital Spy's Daniel Kilkelly praised Phillipps for being [...] "a strong actor" [...] and said he deserved [...] "a chance to shine" [...] as Daniel in the new year. Kilkelly bemoaned the lack of challenging storylines for him and hoped he would be given something more to do that did not revolve around his relationship with Amber. When Daniel got stuck in the well, an Inside Soap columnist quipped [...] "What kind of idiot thinks that climbing down a well an hour before his wedding is a good idea? Neighbours' Daniel, that's who!" ...|$|E
2500|$|The tour {{agent was}} Ingrid Hart, who {{recalled}} that [...] " [...] {{wanted to be}} there with her boyfriend, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> some money together and get married". On 20 July 1969, Sweethearts on Parade were performing for about 75 US Marines at a Non-commissioned officer's club 7km (4mi) south-east of Da Nang in South Vietnam. At about 9:15p.m., Wayne had just finished a song and was still on stage to introduce her fellow performers when she was shot in the chest by a bullet fired from a [...]22 pistol, fitted with a silencer, which had been stolen at the base. Wayne died almost instantly as the bullet severed her aorta. In Entertaining Vietnam, a 2003 documentary directed and produced by Mara Wallis, Taylor was interviewed on the events of Wayne's death, footage of a Sweethearts on Parade performance with Wayne singing was shown (see screenshot at left). Taylor recalled that he was sitting about a metre (three feet) behind Wayne and that Cavanagh had stepped forward to cradle his fiancée when she slumped to the floor.|$|E
6000|$|... 'So, Violet, Fanshawe's {{appointment}} {{was a pretty}} little bit of patronage of yours; but the ladies of Wrangerton will never forgive you. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> up a subscription {{to give him a}} piece of plate.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why?" [...] {{said the}} old man, with a sudden burst of {{impotent}} passion. [...] "YOU ask me why! Because <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> the rendezvous again. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> seek him. Do you understand--to seek HIM--the Coyote!" ...|$|R
50|$|Triple Eight {{announced}} that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> run {{at least two}} cars in the 2011 Porsche Carrera Cup Great Britain and that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> enter the 2011 Ginetta GT Supercup season.

6000|$|... "They gave me to {{understand}} yesterday that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> run things to suit themselves. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> let us interfere in anything." ...|$|R
60|$|In {{their hearts}} they liked {{everything}} about the place except Olive, and they wondered how <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> along with such a glum young person, {{but they did not}} talk about her to Mrs. Easterfield; there was too much else.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. Are you {{the other}} man <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get?</b> That's why Lord Dreever went up to London, {{to see if he}} couldn't find somebody. The man who was going to play one of the parts {{had to go back to}} London on business." ...|$|E
60|$|And the {{conversation}} had started. They talked Nottingham and Nottingham people; it interested them both. Clara was still rather nervous; Mrs. Morel was still somewhat on her dignity.

6000|$|... "They said <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> pay you back. They {{all went}} armed; that is, all but me and Shular. Shular <b>was</b> burnt up. <b>They</b> said <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> shoot you down on sight, {{and then run}} the house to suit themselves. I said--oh, the pain.

6000|$|... "`What was {{the ghost}} like?' I asked; so {{he told me}} that it was a fearful creature--a mulish-looking sort of man, who was in the habit of terrifying the arrieros and peons who passed that way, but he said <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> a priest to put a cross up there, and so lay the ghost.|$|E
60|$|And we chuckled {{to think}} how wet <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get,</b> and came back and stirred the fire, and got our books, and {{arranged}} our specimens of seaweed and cockle shells. By twelve o’clock, with the sun pouring into the room, the heat became quite oppressive, and we wondered when those heavy showers and occasional thunderstorms were going to begin.|$|E
60|$|She {{ran against}} Madge in the morning, and invited herself to tea. Her father had {{returned}} to Liverpool, and her own rooms, for some reason, depressed her. Flossie was there with young Halliday. They were both off {{the next morning to}} his people's place in Devonshire, from where <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> married, and had come to say good-bye. Flossie put Sam in the passage and drew-to the door.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh Jack! I have {{a terrible}} dread that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> commit some of their cruel {{practices}} on these wretched men.

50|$|Every {{project manager}} should create a small {{core set of}} formal {{documents}} defining the project objectives, how <b>they</b> <b>are</b> to be achieved, who <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> achieve them, when <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> achieved, and how much <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> cost.

5000|$|The Nazis {{entered this}} war under the rather childish {{delusion}} that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> bomb everybody else, and nobody <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> bomb them. At Rotterdam, London, Warsaw, {{and half a}} hundred other places, they put that rather naïve theory into operation.

6000|$|... 'Goddesses may {{do as they}} like, {{but those}} Greek and Trojan women were poor-spirited things if they minded men who couldn't fight their own battles {{and had to be}} hustled off by Pallas, and Venus, and Juno, when <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> beaten. The idea of two armies {{stopping}} and sitting down while a pair of heroes flung stones at one another! I don't think much of your old Homer. Give me Napoleon or Grant for my hero.' ...|$|E
60|$|It was midnight {{when our}} train landed us at Oberau station; {{but the place}} was far more busy and {{stirring}} than on ordinary occasions it is at mid-day. Crowds of tourists and pilgrims thronged the little hotel, wondering, as also did the landlord, where they {{were all going to}} sleep; and wondering still more, though this latter consideration evidently did not trouble their host, how <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> up to Ober-Ammergau in the morning in time for the play, which always begins at 8 a.m.|$|E
6000|$|The day wore itself out. After {{dinner the}} two friends put in a long and harassing evening {{trying to decide what}} to do with the five {{thousand}} dollars reward which <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> when they should find One-Armed Pete, and catch him, and prove him to be the right person, and extradite him, and ship him to Tahlequah in the Indian Territory. But there were so many dazzling openings for ready cash that they found it impossible to make up their minds and keep them made up. Finally, Mrs. Sellers grew very weary of it all, and said: ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Yes,' said Edgar, a {{good deal}} reinvigorated by having {{something}} to tell; 'I suppose <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> tell him what is settled.

60|$|Electricity <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> light them, warm them, carry them, doctor them, {{cook for}} them, execute them, if necessary. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> weaned on electricity, rocked in their cradles by electricity, slapped by electricity, ruled and {{regulated}} and guided by electricity, buried by electricity. I may be wrong, but I rather think <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> hatched by electricity.|$|R
60|$|By {{this time}} toasts and speeches had given place to songs, the wheat subject being quite forgotten. Men were putting their heads {{together}} in twos and threes, telling good stories, with pantomimic laughter which reached convulsive grimace. Some {{were beginning to}} look as if they did not know how they had come there, what they had come for, or how <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> home again; and provisionally sat on with a dazed smile. Square-built men showed a tendency to become hunchbacks; men with a dignified presence lost it in a curious obliquity of figure, in which their features grew disarranged and one-sided, whilst the heads of a few who had dined with extreme thoroughness were somehow sinking into their shoulders, the corners of their mouth and eyes being bent upwards by the subsidence. Only Henchard did not conform to these flexuous changes; he remained stately and vertical, silently thinking.|$|E
6000|$|Also, in {{the first}} {{fortnight}} of his stay, he had called at every house, alike in Downhill and Uphill, to the great surprise {{of some of the}} families, who had not in the memory of man seen a parson cross their threshold. Some did not like it, such as old Dame Verdon, who, though she could hardly get out of bed, was very sore about the new school; and when her friends came to see her, told them wonderful stories which she had picked up--or Lizzie had from some hawker--that the gentlefolks thought there were too many children for the rates and taxes, and <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> them all into the school, and make an end of them. Sometimes she said it was by [...] "giving of them all the cowpox," [...] as Dame Spurrell called vaccination as the fashion was in those parts, sometimes it was by sending them all out to Botany Bay.|$|E

They pushed her close up to me, and then, before I knew what was happening, {{she put her hands}} on my shoulders, stood up on tiptoe, and kissed me. After which, burying her face in her apron, she ran off, followed by the second girl. The third girl opened the door for me, and so evidently expected me to go, that in my confusion I went, leaving my twenty marks behind me. I don't say I minded the kiss, though I did not particularly want it, while I did want the cushion. I don't like {{to go back to the}} shop. I cannot understand the thing at all." ...|$|E
