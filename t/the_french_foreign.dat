5|$|During this time, Khánh spread rumors in {{the capital}} that the French were behind a plan to install a pro-communist {{government}} that would implement de Gaulle's plans for the neutralization of Vietnam.

De Gaulle's attempt to cultivate relations with communist China was tied to his policy of calling on US troops to leave Vietnam.|$|E

5|$|French {{security}} forces were initially {{taken by surprise}} and were unable to organize an effective response to contain the uprising. By May 1947, however, the French military had begun to counter the nationalists' attacks. Five North African battalions arrived in Madagascar {{at the end of}} July 1947, enabling the French to take the initiative. However, French army strength remained modest with soldiers numbering 18,000 in April 1947. The number of troops increased to about 30,000 in 1948. The French forces now included paratroopers, soldiers of <b>the</b> <b>French</b> <b>Foreign</b> Legion, and tirailleurs (colonial infantry) brought in from the French territories of Comoros and Senegal.|$|E
5|$|In January 1954, Muong Khoua was re-occupied by Laotian forces, {{which were}} {{subsequently}} overrun once {{more by the}} 316th Division of the Viet Minh.

Battalions of <b>the</b> <b>French</b> <b>Foreign</b> Legion and Laotian forces suffered losses covering the retreat of garrison survivors. The area of Muong Khoua later became a critical supply route across Dien Bien Phu for the Viet Minh and by 1963 was the site of a construction project for the proposed Route 19.|$|E

Jay, Adams, and Franklin played the major part in the final negotiations. Overruling Franklin and distrustful of Vergennes, Jay and Adams decided not to consult with France; instead, they dealt directly with the British commissioners.|$|E

5|$|The Schießbefehl was, not surprisingly, very {{controversial}} in the West and was {{singled out for}} criticism by the West Germans. The GDR authorities occasionally suspended the Schießbefehl on occasions when {{it would have been}} politically inconvenient to have to explain dead refugees, such as during a visit to the GDR by <b>the</b> <b>French</b> <b>foreign</b> minister in 1985. It was also a problem for many of the East German guards and was the motivating factor behind a number of escapes, when guards facing a crisis of conscience defected because of their unwillingness to shoot fellow citizens.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from those}} who became generals, the best known member of the class is Louis A. Merrilat, who played college {{football}} with the Army Black Knights alongside Bradley and Eisenhower, and was selected as a first-team All-American in both 1913 and 1914. He was wounded in battle while serving in France during World War I, and later played in the National Football League for the Canton Bulldogs in the 1925 NFL season. He became a soldier of fortune, training Iran's Persian Guard, working with the Chinese Army in the 1930s, and serving in <b>the</b> <b>French</b> <b>Foreign</b> Legion. During World War II, he returned to active duty with the US Army, reaching the rank of colonel.|$|E

While in the service of <b>the</b> <b>French</b> <b>Foreign</b> Legion in World War I, he traverses thirty-seven miles round trip in just thirty minutes (a speed of about 148mph); all while carrying 2,000 pounds of food, water, and ammunition for his unit.

5|$|De Hauteclocque {{arrived in}} London on 25 July 1940, {{and met with}} de Gaulle, who {{announced}} that he was promoting him to Chef d'escadrons (major). He also encountered his cousin Pierre de Hauteclocque, Xavier's brother, who was serving with the 13e Demi-Brigade de Légion Étrangère (13e DBLE, an infantry regiment of <b>the</b> <b>French</b> <b>Foreign</b> Legion). This was the largest unit that had joined the Free French Forces. After participating in the Battles of Narvik, it had found itself in Britain when France surrendered. Formed after the war began, it contained many men who had fought for the Republican cause in the Spanish Civil War, and many refugees from Nazi and Fascist countries. De Hauteclocque then offered his own services to the unit, but its commander, Colonel Raoul Magrin-Vernerey, rejected his offer on the grounds that he was high-born, over-qualified and a cavalryman.|$|E
5|$|For {{the next}} two weeks, the outnumbered Berryforce {{attempted}} to retake the strategically important town in the Battle of Merdjayoun. His first attempt was a failure. After carrying out a personal reconnaissance on 18 June, Berryman tried again. This time his attack was halted by staunch defence by <b>the</b> <b>French</b> <b>Foreign</b> Legion and tanks. Berryman then tried a different approach. Instead of attempting to capture the town, he seized high ground overlooking the French supply lines. Faced with being cut off, the French withdrew from the town. Berryforce was then dissolved and Berryman returned to his role as commander of the 7th Division artillery.|$|E

He had lied about his age to enlist. He rediscovered his older brother, Céleste Ponticelli, who had joined the same regiment. According to Ponticelli, France had done much for him, and serving was his way of showing his gratitude. He served at Soissons in Picardy, northeast France, and at Douaumont, near Verdun. Ponticelli worked at digging burial pits and trenches. In keeping a promise to Céleste to always assist others, he rescued a German and a French soldier who were wounded in the arm and leg, respectively.|$|E

With C. A. Rosetti and Brătianu, he supported the transit of Russian troops and persuaded Carol to accept the Russian alliance, contrary to the initial advice of the Crown Council. He also sought advice on this matter from the French Third Republic, who was {{still one of the}} powers supervising Romania; Louis, duc Decazes, <b>the</b> <b>French</b> <b>Foreign</b> Minister, declined to give him a reassuring answer, and pointed that, were Romania to join up with Russia, the other powers would cease offering their protection. Making note of this, Kogălniceanu expressed his hope that France would still support his country at the decisive moment.|$|E
5|$|As king, Edward's main {{interests}} lay in {{the fields}} of foreign affairs and naval and military matters. Fluent in French and German, he reinvented royal diplomacy by numerous state visits across Europe. He took annual holidays in Biarritz and Marienbad. One of his most important foreign trips was an official visit to France in May 1903 as the guest of President Émile Loubet. Following a visit to the Pope in Rome, this trip helped create the atmosphere for the Anglo-French Entente Cordiale, an agreement delineating British and French colonies in North Africa, and ruling out any future war between the two countries. The Entente was negotiated in 1904 between <b>the</b> <b>French</b> <b>foreign</b> minister, Théophile Delcassé, and the British foreign secretary, Lord Lansdowne. It marked the end of centuries of Anglo-French rivalry and Britain's splendid isolation from Continental affairs, and attempted to counterbalance the growing dominance of the German Empire and its ally, Austria-Hungary.|$|E
5|$|Sometime {{prior to}} 1894 Eberhardt began {{corresponding}} with Eugène Letord, a French officer {{stationed in the}} Sahara who had placed a newspaper advertisement for a pen pal. Eberhardt asked him for every detail he could give her {{about life in the}} Sahara, also informing him of her dreams of escaping Geneva alongside her favourite sibling, Augustin. Letord encouraged the two of them to relocate to Bône, Algeria, where he could assist them in establishing a new life. In a series of circumstances that remain unclear though involved financial debts and ties to Russian revolutionist groups with which he was affiliated, Augustin fled Geneva in 1894. Eberhardt probably assisted him initially but was unable to keep track of his whereabouts despite making constant inquiries. In November 1894 Eberhardt was informed by a letter that Augustin had joined <b>the</b> <b>French</b> <b>Foreign</b> Legion and was assigned to Algeria. While at first furious with Augustin's decision, Eberhardt's anger did not last; she asked him to send her a detailed diary of what he saw in North Africa.|$|E
