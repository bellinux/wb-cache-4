5|$|In {{addition}} to their appearance in the film, Green Day recorded {{its own version of}} the Simpsons theme, and released it as a single. Zimmer turned the Spider-Pig song into a choral piece, which was a joke he never intended to be put into the film. Zimmer also had to write foreign-language lyrics for the 32 dubbed versions of the song when the film was released internationally. He found translating the song into Spanish <b>the</b> <b>hardest</b> <b>to</b> write. The same choir learned to sing the piece for each of the foreign-language dubs.|$|E
5|$|In the 2004–05 season, Humphreys helped Hartlepool {{once again}} make the {{play-off}}s. During the play-off semi-final against Tranmere, Humphreys had {{the task of}} taking a penalty for Hartlepool in sudden death. This {{was the first time}} Humphreys had taken a penalty since his crucial miss at Cheltenham. This time he scored and sent Hartlepool through to the play-off final against his old club Sheffield Wednesday at the Millennium Stadium. This helped to erase the memories of Cheltenham. However, Hartlepool lost the play-off final to Sheffield Wednesday. Humphreys believes that of all the play-off defeats he has suffered that the controversial loss to Wednesday was <b>the</b> <b>hardest</b> <b>to</b> take. Before {{the end of the season}} Humphreys extended his contract by a further two years.|$|E
5|$|Theophrastus {{describes}} {{the wood of}} different trees, the effects of climate on wood, of knots and 'coiling' in timber and other differences in quality. He discusses which woods to use for specific purposes such as for carpentry, shipbuilding and for building houses, {{and the making of}} charcoal. The most useful trees are said to be silver-fir and fir, and they have the best wood in the largest sizes; the silver-fir is softer than the fir, and its wood has layers like an onion, and is made entirely of these layers. The strongest and most attractive wood is smooth, without knots. In Syria, terebinth wood is dark and close-grained, Theophrastus reports, and used both for the handles of daggers and, turned on the lathe, for making cups. He claims that the hardest timber is of oak and holm oak, while elm warps the least, so it is used for the pivots and sockets of doors, which must be straight. The wood of palms is light and soft like cork-oak, but is tougher and less brittle, so it is good for carving images. Timber from the cedar, ebony, box, olive, oak and sweet chestnut keeps well and resists decay. He asserts that Tamarisk wood from Greece is weak, but from the Arabian island of Tylos it is as strong as kermes-oak. The wood of oak and the knotted parts of fir and silver-fir are described as <b>the</b> <b>hardest</b> <b>to</b> work. Ships are generally made of silver-fir, fir, and Syrian cedar; in Cyprus they use Aleppo pine which is better than the fir that grows there. Theophrastus records that in the lowlands of Italy (the country of the Latins) they grow bay, myrtle and excellent beech trees long enough for the whole length of a ship.|$|E

Combinations of crying with facial expressions, posture and movements, aided by physiological measurements, have been tested and found to be reliable indicators. A number of such observational scales have been published and verified Even with noticeable responses from an infant, the underlying problem may be hidden.

25|$|Goalkeeper is {{the most}} {{defensive}} position in football. The goalkeeper's main job is to stop the other team from scoring by catching, palming or punching the ball from shots, headers and crosses. Unlike their teammates, goalkeepers typically remain in and around their own penalty area {{for most of the}} game. As a result, goalkeepers have a better view of the pitch and often give advice to their defence when the other team is on the attack or during set pieces. Goalkeepers are the only players on the pitch who are allowed to handle the ball, but this is restricted to their own penalty area. Positioning is another important job and is one of <b>the</b> <b>hardest</b> <b>to</b> master as keeper.|$|E

25|$|The down-up {{is played}} by hitting the ball at the latest {{possible}} moment. This causes the ball to bounce sharply off the ground, ideally propelling {{the ball into the}} top corner of the net, preventing any fielders from making contact with the ball. This technique varies from outdoor cricket, where a batsman plays the ball in front of the body, hitting the ball for power and distance, rather than to hit the ball into the ground. The down-up is typically played as a forward attacking shot, in which the batsman steps forward with his front foot to hit the ball. The stroke is most commonly used to play full-pitched balls slightly outside off-stump, on the stumps, or slightly outside leg-stump. The leg-side down-up is <b>the</b> <b>hardest</b> <b>to</b> play, as it requires the batsman to play in front of his legs. Down-ups can also be played off the back foot for shorter pitched deliveries.|$|E
25|$|For its spiritual significance, Maya is {{primarily}} connected to intellectual misjudgments. But while errors on objective facts (such as {{the size of}} an object) can be relatively easily corrected, errors in valuation (such as considering rituals as ends in themselves) are much harder to correct, because they are connected to subjective desires. This second kind of misjudgment leads to false beliefs, which are taken as self-evident and are <b>the</b> <b>hardest</b> <b>to</b> eliminate. From {{the point of view of}} the awakening individual, however, Maya disappears completely as consciousness becomes free of its grasp. This awakening from Maya is also termed Mahapralaya, or the final annihilation of the world, since the world is the creation of Maya. This also stands in view of the statement: “The soul in its transcendental state is One, Formless, Eternal and Infinite, yet identifies itself with the phenomenal world of forms, which are many, finite and destructible. This is Maya or the cosmic illusion”.|$|E
25|$|Mehmet Osman was conceptualised by {{the creators}} of EastEnders, Tony Holland and Julia Smith. Mehmet, the brother of {{original}} character Ali Osman (Nejdet Salih), {{was part of a}} well-intentioned attempt to represent the proportion of Turkish Cypriots who had immigrated to England and settled in the East End of London. Holland and Smith knew that for the soap to succeed there needed to be a varied group of characters, so that several different sections of the audience had someone to identify with. Additionally, if the programme was to be realistic, it had to reflect the cross-section of society that actually existed in the real location. For these reasons, different sexes, ages, classes, religions and races were all included in the original character line-up. Both Holland and Smith had {{been at the forefront of}} the move towards 'integrated casting' in television and had encountered an array of ethnic diversities in the process. Even though the ethnic minority groups were deemed <b>the</b> <b>hardest</b> <b>to</b> research, Holland and Smith called upon their social contacts to relay information about their own origins and lifestyles, which they say allowed them to portray Walford's most recent immigrants more realistically.|$|E

500|$|Joseph's carol [...] "A Little Childe There is Ibore", is {{a setting}} of a 15th-century poem for three female voices and piano or strings.

[...] Written in alternate bars {{of five and}} seven beats, it was praised by Brian for its originality. It was eventually broadcast by the BBC on 21 December 1995. Brian was also an admirer of Joseph's many instructional piano pieces: [...] "pleasingly simple and unaffected". [...] These were published between 1920 and 1925; Gibbs writes that these pieces [...] "focus on technical aspects in tuneful and often modal contexts", with occasional excursions into other forms such as chaconne and rondo.|$|E

500|$|The nudity was {{optional}} for the performers. The French cast was [...] "the nudest" [...] of {{the foreign}} groups, while the London cast [...] "found nudity <b>the</b> <b>hardest</b> <b>to</b> achieve." [...] The Swedish cast was reluctant to disrobe, but in Copenhagen, the tribe thought the nudity too tame and decided to walk naked {{up and down the}} aisle during the show's prelude. In some early performances, the Germans played their scene behind a big sheet labeled [...] "CENSORED". Original Broadway cast member Natalie Mosco said, [...] "I was dead set against the nude scene at first, but I remembered my acting teacher having said that part of acting is being private in public. So I did it." [...] According to Melba Moore, [...] "It doesn't mean anything except what you want it to mean. We put so much value on clothing. .... It's like so much else people get uptight about." [...] Donna Summer, who was in the German production, said that [...] "it was not meant to be sexual. ... We stood naked to comment on the fact that society makes more of nudity than killing." [...] Rado said that [...] "being naked in front of an audience, you're baring your soul. [...] Not only the soul but the whole body was being exposed.

500|$|There {{were some}} improvised scenes. These {{included}} {{a scene in}} the beginning of the episode where Alan and Joanna are in a middle of a field and the scene begins with a low-angle shot. Later, when Alan is [...] "humping" [...] Joanna, the scene suddenly becomes a crane shot. This is because the crew at the time had a crane camera after they had finished filming the final scenes in series 2 where Alan, Joanna and Martin are teetering over the edge of a cliff in the stolen camper van. The camper van scenes were <b>the</b> <b>hardest</b> <b>to</b> shoot, especially the scene where the van explodes, as this had to be done in one take. Another problem was the smell of the van, which Pippa Haywood said, [...] "smelt of old dogs." [...] The van also suffered other problems such as bits of the steering wheel and gear stick coming off. Julian Rhind-Tutt commented that the scene where Alan and Boyce talk together for the last time was one of the most moving scenes in the whole of Green Wing. The wedding was shot at Hall of Bayham Abbey in Kent, where the crew had difficulty filming due to bad weather. The show also features a guest appearance from Jeremy Sheffield near the end of the episode as Sue's new boyfriend.|$|E

She stated that she was [...] "seriously upset" [...] writing the end of the book, although Goblet of Fire was <b>the</b> <b>hardest</b> <b>to</b> write.
