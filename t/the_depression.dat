5|$|Although {{thunderstorm}} {{activity was}} initially minimal around {{the center of}} circulation, convective band associated with <b>the</b> <b>depression</b> was becoming more organized. Late on September10, convection began to increase slightly near the center, though because Dvorak intensity T-numbers were between 2.0 and 2.5, <b>the</b> <b>depression</b> was not upgraded to a tropical storm. However, dry air briefly caused showers and thunderstorms to decrease later that day. Initially, it headed just north of due west around the southern periphery of a large subtropical ridge. However, by September11, <b>the</b> <b>depression</b> re-curved northwestward. Later that day, <b>the</b> <b>depression</b> began to regain deep convection. Geostationary satellite imagery and scatterometer data indicated that <b>the</b> <b>depression</b> strengthened into Tropical Storm Nadine at 0000UTC on September12.|$|E
5|$|By September 28, the {{organization}} of <b>the</b> <b>depression</b> deteriorated further due to strong vertical wind shear. The center of <b>the</b> <b>depression</b> again became difficult to location by infrared images early on September 29. Later that day, a few computer models indicated a decrease in wind shear over <b>the</b> <b>depression</b> within two days, thus, it was predicted to strengthen into a tropical storm. However, wind shear exposed the center of <b>the</b> <b>depression</b> again by early on September 30, though it was still forecast to intensify to tropical storm status. By late on October 1, satellite imagery noted that <b>the</b> <b>depression</b> dissipated, and the National Hurricane Center issued its final advisory on the system.|$|E
5|$|In the Caribbean, {{the trough}} caused <b>the</b> <b>depression</b> to slow to a westward drift, {{resulting}} in {{several days of}} heavy rainfall in the region, particularly Puerto Rico. One forecast on October 5 anticipated a continued westward track toward Jamaica. Instead, <b>the</b> <b>depression</b> turned to the north the next day {{under the influence of}} the upper-level westerlies. On October 7, <b>the</b> <b>depression</b> attained its lowest pressure of 1000 mbar (29.53 inHg), off the southern coast of Hispaniola. The next day, it made landfall in Peravia Province in the Dominican Republic. After crossing the country and exiting into the Atlantic Ocean, <b>the</b> <b>depression</b> accelerated to the northeast, followed by an eastward turn on October 10 before another turn to the northeast. By October 12, <b>the</b> <b>depression</b> could no longer be classified as a tropical cyclone, although satellite imagery indicated that its remnants continued northeastward. On October 15 the system turned to the west, suppressed by a strong high-pressure area to its north. It re-intensified while crossing through the Azores, attaining a pressure of 994 mbar. It turned to the northwest and was absorbed into the westerlies on October 20.|$|E

5|$|Katrina {{continued}} to track over Central America {{for most of}} October30 and began to accelerate. Roughly 24hours after landfall, <b>the</b> <b>depression</b> moved back over water, in the Gulf of Honduras; however, by this time, there was no convection remaining around the system. The acceleration of the storm was due to a regeneration of the low-level circulation northward. Due to unfavorable conditions, the weakened system failed to regenerate convection before moving back over land near the northern Belize-Mexico border. Around this time, forecasters reported that <b>the</b> <b>depression</b> would re-intensify once in the Gulf of Mexico before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone. Although situated over land, <b>the</b> <b>depression</b> began to regenerate convection, leading to increased rainfall over the Yucatan Peninsula. By the evening of November1, <b>the</b> <b>depression</b> weakened again and moved into the Gulf of Mexico; however, unlike previous forecasts, the circulation was absorbed by a cold front hours later.|$|E
5|$|Late on January 1, 2009, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) {{reported}} that {{an area of}} deep atmospheric convection had persisted for the last 48hours about 730km (455mi), to the southeast of Manila in the Philippines. Deep convection was developing over the northern quadrant of a weak low level circulation center. A subtropical ridge of pressure was helping to guide the disturbance and was providing good outflow as well as low to moderate vertical wind shear. However, as the disturbance was moving into {{a higher level of}} vertical wind shear <b>the</b> <b>depression</b> was not expected to develop into a significant tropical cyclone within 48 hours. During the next 48 hours the disturbance gradually developed, with the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) and the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) reporting early on January 3 that it had become the first tropical depression of the season, with the name Auring being assigned to <b>the</b> <b>depression</b> by PAGASA whilst it was located about 140km (85mi) east of Surigao City on the Philippine island of Mindanao. This came after the low level circulation center had started to consolidate as deep convection was being fueled by a poleward diffluence despite being in an area of strong vertical wind shear. Over {{the next couple of days}} as Auring moved towards the east, dry air started to wrap in to its low level circulation center which started to weaken <b>the</b> <b>depression</b> after it had peaked with winds of 45km/h, (30mph) 10-min sustained and a peak pressure of 1006 hPa/Mbar. As the baroclinic zone approached <b>the</b> <b>depression</b> late on January 5, PAGASA downgraded <b>the</b> <b>depression</b> to an area of low pressure as the baroclinic zone was approaching <b>the</b> <b>depression,</b> as vertical wind shear had increased and outflow became hindered. However the JMA continued to issue warnings on <b>the</b> <b>depression</b> until early the next morning when <b>the</b> <b>depression</b> was declared dissipated by the JTWC and the JMA.|$|E
5|$|Later on June18, {{forecast}} models {{indicated that}} the system might rapidly degenerate prior to landfall. However, the NHC continued to forecast that <b>the</b> <b>depression</b> would attain tropical storm-status before landfall. Shortly after, <b>the</b> <b>depression</b> became increasingly disorganized as convection separated {{from the center of}} circulation due to increasing wind shear. Stable air ahead of the system inhibited the possibility of rapid development as warm waters supported intensification. By the morning of June19, the center of circulation was situated along the southern edge of deep convection, indicating that <b>the</b> <b>depression</b> was beginning to degenerate. Despite this, the NHC continued to anticipate intensification prior to landfall. Embedded within an easterly flow ahead of a mid-level trough, the storm turned towards the north-northeast and accelerated slightly. At 11:00am PDT (1800UTC), <b>the</b> <b>depression</b> reached its peak intensity with winds of 35mph (55km/h) and a barometric pressure of 1003mbar (hPa; 29.62inHg). Operationally, <b>the</b> <b>depression</b> was considered to be slightly stronger, having a minimum pressure of 1001mbar (hPa; 29.56inHg). Later that day, <b>the</b> <b>depression</b> began to degenerate into an open trough as it was situated underneath cirrus clouds instead of cumulonimbus clouds. Visible satellite imagery showed that <b>the</b> <b>depression</b> became increasingly ill-defined and the NHC estimated that <b>the</b> <b>depression</b> degenerated into a trough of low pressure near the Islas Marías during the afternoon of June19. The remnants of <b>the</b> <b>depression</b> were monitored by the United States Naval Research Laboratory for several more hours until the system moved inland over Sinaloa.|$|E

5|$|On May31, Tropical Depression One {{developed}} in the western Caribbean Sea, a day {{before the start of}} the Atlantic hurricane season. <b>The</b> <b>depression</b> moved northeastward, passing just northwest of Isla de la Juventud before striking the Cuban mainland south of Havana.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>depression</b> began a {{movement}} to the northwest upon formation and {{on the night of}} October 31, <b>the</b> <b>depression</b> ran into a newly-forming upper-level low near the Yucatan Peninsula.
