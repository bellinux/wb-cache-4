5|$|As {{in other}} disciplines, the initial {{emphasis}} of feminist economists was to critique the established theory, methodology, and policy approaches. The critique began in microeconomics {{of the household}} and labor markets and spread to macroeconomics and international trade, ultimately extending to all areas of traditional economic analysis. Feminist economists pushed for and produced gender aware theory and analysis, broadened <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> economics and sought pluralism of methodology and research methods.|$|E

5|$|Before being {{acquired}} by the society, the Corstorphine hill site was a nursery, once owned by Thomas Blaikie, who planted many of the great French parks such as ‘La Bagatelle’. On this site two nurserymen raised the famous apple cultivars ‘John Downie’ and ‘James Grieve’. Today, the zoo {{has one of the}} most diverse tree collections in the Lothians with 120 species. The south-facing aspect allows bananas to be grown outside. Increasingly, horticulture is seen as a discipline in its own right, with <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> habitat creation within enclosures, food stuffs for the animals, and enrichment for both the animals and the visiting public.|$|E
5|$|By Vegas standards, the 75-seat {{restaurant}} is small, and the decor is understated, keeping <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> the food. No flowers are allowed nor are the staff permitted to wear perfumes to eliminate {{competition with the}} aromas of the cuisine. The {{restaurant is}} open Wednesday through Sunday and closed on Monday and Tuesday. It has been rated with two Michelin stars, ranked {{as one of the}} best 101 Hotel Restaurants, been voted Restaurant of the year, and in 2015 was ranked by Gayot in its Top 40 Restaurants.|$|E
5|$|During the {{streaming}} of the series, Silverman {{criticized the}} animation {{because of the}} low lighting levels that might {{make it hard to}} understand. Hiroko Yamamura from Japanator noted the series' high budget and praised the animation style and <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> details and technology. She was attracted by its premise and expected the quality to remain consistent across the entire series. Similarly, Jacob Hope Chapman from ANN praised the animation for its high quality. Episode 18, which is known for its flawed animation, was improved for the home media release of the series.|$|E

5|$|In 2007, Neighbours {{suffered}} a significant decline in ratings and plans {{were made to}} take the series into a 'back to basics' approach where storylines would become less controversial and return to <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> relationships and family dynamics. It {{was at this point}} that the character of Declan was created and actress Jane Hall would play his on-screen mother Rebecca Napier. The characters were to create a family unit for then, already existing character Oliver Barnes (David Hoflin).|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the conceptual framework several additional factors enabled the GWA studies. One was the advent of biobanks, which are repositories of human genetic material that greatly reduced the cost and difficulty of collecting sufficient numbers of biological specimens for study. Another was the International HapMap Project, which, from 2003 identified {{a majority of the}} common SNPs interrogated in a GWA study. The haploblock structure identified by HapMap project also allowed <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> the subset of SNPs that would describe most of the variation. Also the development of the methods to genotype all these SNPs using genotyping arrays was an important prerequisite.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s, {{prosperity}} {{became a}} primary focus in healing revivals. T. L. Osborn began emphasizing prosperity in the 1960s and became {{known for his}} often ostentatious displays of personal wealth. During that decade, Roberts and William Branham criticized other prosperity ministries, arguing that their fund-raising tactics unfairly pressured attendees. These tactics were prompted {{in part by the}} expense of developing nationwide radio networks and campaign schedules. At the same time, leaders of the Pentecostal Assemblies of God denomination often criticized <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> prosperity taken by independent healing evangelists.|$|E

50|$|The {{past four}} festivals were {{organised}} at Madurai, the city {{known as a}} seat of learning since the Sangam periods dating back to 4th century B.C, <b>The</b> first festival <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> poverty, from <b>the</b> perspective of water, environment, gender, education, health and culture. <b>The</b> second festival <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> Water and life. <b>The</b> third festival <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> 'Water and People'. <b>The</b> fourth festival <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> ‘Culture and Heritage’. <b>The</b> fifth festival <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> ‘Fight Poverty: Connect and Commit for MDGs’, which was held in Chennai.|$|R
5|$|It {{is often}} {{held that the}} Renown and Courageous classes were {{designed}} for Fisher's plan to land troops (possibly Russian) on the German Baltic coast. Specifically, they were designed with a reduced draught, which might be important in the shallow Baltic. This is not clear-cut evidence that the ships were designed for the Baltic: it was considered that earlier ships had too much draught and not enough freeboard under operational conditions. Roberts argues that <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> the Baltic was probably unimportant {{at the time the}} ships were designed, but was inflated later, after the disastrous Dardanelles Campaign.|$|E
5|$|It was a multi-target success, with an {{audience}} {{not limited to}} viewers in their forties as <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> 1980s nostalgia might have indicated. This countered a contemporary trend in series television to target a specific audience demographic. The plots include characters and situations for all ages, and the series' general tone is family-friendly. Although it includes a number of flashbacks, the scripts did not limit the actors to a 1980s viewpoint; according to consultant Mariela Mociulsky, the show reflects more modern realities (such as men showing their emotions and women having greater autonomy in their lives) than TV shows of the 1980s did.|$|E
5|$|Obesity and {{metabolic}} syndrome are both {{closely related to}} plasma triglyceride levels. Therefore, <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> an association between APOA5 and BMI or {{metabolic syndrome}} is understandable. Available studies show that minor APOA5 alleles could be associated with an enhanced risk of obesity or metabolic syndrome development. However, genome wide studies have failed to prove that APOA5 is a gene associated with BMI values and/or obesity, so the effect could be far from clinically significant or at least significantly context-dependent.|$|E

5|$|Reviewers {{recommended}} {{the book for}} public educators as {{an important contribution to}} liberal theory. Their common criticism was based around practical applications and the imposition of autonomy as a value, e.g., her contemporary examples of national civics education, how citizens who disagreed with <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> autonomy could be accommodated, and how a weak perfectionist state could defend marginalized group interests in a public school setting.|$|E
5|$|Rogen and Goldberg {{developed}} {{the idea for}} The Interview in the late 2000s, with Kim Jong-il as the original assassination target. In 2011, after Jong-il's death, Jong-un replaced him as the North Korean leader. Rogen and Goldberg re-{{developed the}} script with <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> Jong-un's character.

Itoi stated that an additional two years would have been required to finish the game, which was 30% complete at the time of cancellation. Iwata stated retrospectively that <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> 3D graphics made the project overly complex. Miyamoto also stated that the Mother franchise was not abandoned and that he was still interested in bringing the game to fruition.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> {{customization}} {{features in}} the game was designed by Naora {{to appeal to the}} American market. A trailer of the game was featured at the Los Angeles E3 in 2005, although Naora later commented that a North American release date was not yet set as there were concerns about competing with the soon-to-be-released PlayStation 3. While the gaming website RPGamer reported at one point a 2006 release in North America, the game was eventually released only in Japan.|$|E
5|$|The {{founding}} educational {{philosophy is}} still {{evident in the}} modern day curriculum in <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> learning by doing, teaching based on broad themes that cross subjects, an emphasis on collaborative projects, and a de-emphasis of textbooks.
