5|$|David Wallace {{comes to}} the Scranton branch and says <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>client</b> was so pleased with the {{discount}} that they {{decided to make the}} company their exclusive provider of office supplies. Grateful, David congratulates Dwight for the idea and after a moment's hesitation, Dwight accepts the credit. Michael is shocked and upset. The rest of the office, still angry at Michael for his near-disastrous idea, play along with Wallace's misunderstanding and congratulate Dwight. When David sets up a conference call with the marketing department so Dwight can explain his Golden Ticket promotion, Michael interrupts and goads Dwight into revealing the idea actually came from Michael. After much bickering between Michael and Dwight, a frustrated David leaves the office, appearing indifferent about the outcome.|$|E

25|$|REBT posits <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>client</b> {{must work}} hard to get better, and in therapy this {{normally}} includes {{a wide array of}} homework exercises in day-to-day life assigned by the therapist. The assignments may for example include desensitization tasks, i.e., by having the client confront the very thing he or she is afraid of. By doing so, the client is actively acting against the belief that often is contributing significantly to the disturbance.|$|E
25|$|Clients hold {{a margin}} account with the exchange, {{and every day}} the swings {{in the value of}} their {{positions}} is added to or deducted from their margin account. If the margin account gets too low, they have to replenish it. In this way it is highly unlikely <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>client</b> {{will not be able to}} fulfill his obligations arising from the contracts. As the clearing house is the counterparty to all their trades, they only have to have one margin account. This is in contrast with OTC derivatives, where issues such as margin accounts have to be negotiated with all counterparties.|$|E

25|$|Bustamante was a well-behaved {{teenager}} who suddenly {{at the age}} of 22 became a career criminal. His crimes included theft, breaking and entering, drug offenses, and robbery. In 1990 Bustamante was charged with a homicide. The defense team discovered <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>client</b> had suffered a head injury from a crowbar {{at the age of}} twenty. Bustamante’s behavior changed fundamentally after that, transforming him from a normal individual into an impulsive and emotionally labile criminal. The defense team had his client’s brain scanned, which revealed malfunctioning of the prefrontal cortex. At the end the jury believed that Bustamante’s brain was not normal and spared him from the death penalty.|$|E

500|$|A {{work unit}} is the protein data <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>client</b> {{is asked to}} process. Work units are a {{fraction}} of the simulation between the states in a Markov state model. After the work unit has been downloaded and completely processed by a volunteer's computer, it is returned to Folding@home servers, which then award the volunteer the credit points. [...] This cycle repeats automatically. All work units have associated deadlines, and if this deadline is exceeded, the user may not get credit and the unit will be automatically reissued to another participant. As protein folding occurs serially, and many work units are generated from their predecessors, this allows the overall simulation process to proceed normally if a work unit is not returned after a reasonable period of time. Due to these deadlines, the minimum system requirement for Folding@home is a Pentium3 450MHz CPU with Streaming SIMD Extensions (SSE). However, work units for high-performance clients have a much shorter deadline than those for the uniprocessor client, as {{a major part of the}} scientific benefit is dependent on rapidly completing simulations.|$|E

40|$|This study aims {{to examine}} the service “egna medel” {{provided}} by Swedish social services. A client using this service provides a mandate to the social services to manage their income and pay necessary outgoings in their place. This study aims to explore the underlying needs which makes <b>the</b> <b>client</b> require <b>the</b> service, what the service signifies in <b>the</b> <b>client’s</b> life and whether <b>the</b> <b>clients</b> using this service feel that “egna medel” provides them a possibility to live an independent life. The empirical data was collected by means of seven qualitative interviews with clients in Stockholm county. The results were analysed with a theoretical framework circuiting around the notions of independence and normalization. <b>The</b> results show <b>that</b> <b>the</b> service provides <b>the</b> <b>clients</b> {{with a sense of}} security and keeps them from falling back into mental illness or drug abuse. In addition <b>the</b> results show <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>clients</b> perceive themselves as independent despite having conceded the control over their economy to the social services. The results also show <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>clients</b> are constrained from living like others due to their low income, not due to the service “egna medel”. ...|$|R

2500|$|Aside {{from the}} use of herbs and divination, the Santería {{traditional}} healing is achieved through rituals that include animal sacrifice, offerings, altar building, music, dance, and possession trance. When the patient is a child, the Santero uses the curative system known as santiguo, which means [...] "to heal by blessing". Perceiving health problems, most Santeros recommend <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>client</b> seeks a medical doctor. Parallel to the medical treatment, the patient might be prescribed some herbal teas, cleansing baths, or a special diet from the traditional healing practice. Sometimes, a Santero might advise a client to receive omiero, whose efficacy is widely disputed by many in the medical community. An omiero is claimed by believers to be a sacred mixture that is made for specific Santería ceremonies and to embody the orichá ruler of herbs, Osaín. [...] Most clients who see Santeros would never be told to drink it.|$|E

2500|$|After {{two years}} he left the seminary to attend Teachers College, Columbia University, obtaining an MA in 1928 and a PhD in 1931. [...] While {{completing}} his doctoral work, he engaged in child study. In 1930, Rogers served {{as director of the}} Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children in Rochester, New York. From 1935 to 1940 he lectured at the University of Rochester and wrote The Clinical Treatment of the Problem Child (1939), based on his experience in working with troubled children. He was strongly influenced in constructing his client-centered approach by the post-Freudian psychotherapeutic practice of Otto Rank. In 1940 Rogers became professor of clinical psychology at Ohio State University, where he wrote his second book, Counseling and Psychotherapy (1942). [...] In it, Rogers suggested <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>client,</b> by establishing a relationship with an understanding, accepting therapist, can resolve difficulties and gain the insight necessary to restructure their life.|$|E

2500|$|In his dissent, Justice Powell {{pointed out}} that a lawyer's primary task, even in a [...] "routine" [...] divorce case, is one of {{diagnosis}} and advice: {{to point out to}} the client concerns of which he might not be aware, and ensure <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>client</b> addresses those concerns. Powell thought it difficult to enumerate a value for this aspect of legal representation, and hence for consumers to sense how much diagnosis and advice they could expect for a fixed, advertised price. Consequently, {{it is not possible to}} know whether Bates's and O'Steen's assertion that their fees were [...] "reasonable" [...] was an accurate one. [...] "Whether a fee is 'very reasonable' is a matter of opinion, and not a matter of verifiable fact as the Court suggests.

2500|$|On September 8, Lisa Foley's husband, Brian Foley, {{told the}} jury {{that his wife had}} signed a fictional {{contract}} with Rowland to create the impression that Rowland was working for a group of nursing homes Foley owned.

Despite the statement, Rowland's lawyers insisted <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>client</b> was a campaign volunteer and that he was paid for giving Foley advice on his healthcare business, not for being a political consultant. Shortly thereafter on September 16, first defense witness Bedard testified in accord with this line of defense. Bedard claims directly countered prosecutor's charges whereby he states that Rowland: [...] "“The healthcare and nursing home industry was changing and Brian hired him as a consultant to help us move forward,” Bedard testified: “ The healthcare and nursing home industry was changing and Brian [...] hired him [...] as a consultant to help us move forward. ... He knew the politics and practical ways to speed along Medicaid payments that were often delayed by between nine months to a year.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Some {{therapeutic}} approaches developed {{out of the}} European {{school of}} existential philosophy. Concerned mainly with the individual's ability to develop and preserve a sense of meaning and purpose throughout life, major contributors to the field (e.g., Irvin Yalom, Rollo May) and Europe (Viktor Frankl, Ludwig Binswanger, Medard Boss, R.D.Laing, Emmy van Deurzen) attempted to create therapies sensitive to common [...] "life crises" [...] springing from the essential bleakness of human self-awareness, previously accessible only through the complex writings of existential philosophers (e.g., Søren Kierkegaard, Jean-Paul Sartre, Gabriel Marcel, Martin Heidegger, Friedrich Nietzsche). The uniqueness of the patient-therapist relationship thus also forms a vehicle for therapeutic inquiry. A related body of thought in psychotherapy started in the 1950s with Carl Rogers. Based also on the works of Abraham Maslow and his hierarchy of human needs, Rogers brought person-centered psychotherapy into mainstream focus. The primary requirement was <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>client</b> be in receipt of three core [...] "conditions" [...] from his counselor or therapist: unconditional positive regard, sometimes described as [...] "prizing" [...] the client's humanity; congruence and empathic understanding. This type of interaction was thought to enable clients to fully experience and express themselves, and thus develop according to their innate potential. Others developed the approach, like Fritz and Laura Perls {{in the creation of}} Gestalt therapy, as well as Marshall Rosenberg, founder of Nonviolent Communication, and Eric Berne, founder of transactional analysis. Later these fields of psychotherapy would become what is known as humanistic psychotherapy today. Self-help groups and books became widespread.|$|E
