We are the band that made those records [...] so there's really no problem in that regard." [...] Guitarist Jeff Sahyoun said he did not even <b>think</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> Fake History when they were producing The Blackest Beautiful. However, as they progressed through it, there were elements that were not clicking, and the performances lacked the same bite in comparison to their Fake History demos. [...] Butler said that this [...] "almost sent the band crazy". He said he required a specific environment when he sings as his performance puts him in a vulnerable state.|$|E
500|$|Chris Robinson and Robb Buono, the film's {{production}} designer, {{decided that}} the script was composed of two distinct parts— {{the reality of the}} teens' lives and the time they spent at the skating rink. According to Buono, [...] "we wanted to look at it [...] through rose colored glasses, because when you <b>think</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> your memories of that time period— no matter what age you are— you see everything bigger. Our goal was to make that roller skating rink a character that grows as we keep coming back, and each time it’s more magical— a Saturday Night Fever-like contrast to the reality of life.” Robinson and Buono chose to shoot at the Cascade Family Skating Rink in Atlanta after visiting and witnessing the energy and excitement of the rink. However, the filmmakers felt Cascade's interior design was too bland and decided it should be redesigned.|$|E

Early in the book those are recollections of her immediate past in the camp. She had managed to tell Jakob, her lover, that she was pregnant, and later that she delivered a boy. In another recollection she <b>thinks</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> the evening spent in a closet hiding from Dr. Nietzsche: Jakob is a Jewish doctor who is surviving in the camp because he assists Nietzsche in his medical experiments on Jews, experiments involving sterilization, infection, and amputation. One evening, during a clandestine visit to Jakob, Nietzsche comes by and Marija is pushed into a closet, where she nearly passes out, but manages to hear Nietzsche explain to Jakob that the latter is to save the results of Nietzsche's experiments, especially his collection of Jewish skulls. As Marija listens, Jakob navigates between his disgust for Nietzsche and his need to collaborate in order to survive. After Nietzsche leaves, Marija leaves too but too noisily; as the guards run down the corridor she is pulled {{into a room and}} saved by Maks, whom she never sees but who has acquired mythical proportions.|$|R

50|$|The book in Bengali is {{a feminist}} {{analysis}} of women's status and condition in civilizations created by men.

In the work, Azad takes readers on a journey through the broad swathes of experience feminist writers in South Asia have gone through in their writings. Azad is critical of acclaimed figures, notably Rabindranath Tagore and Kazi Nazrul Islam, for what he considers their anti-feminist perceptions of life.|$|E

His self-satisfaction is evident as he remembers the complicated attack plan he helped draft, and as he <b>thinks</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> the struggles Johnston went through in bringing his army together for this decisive blow. The Confederate troops are inexperienced and noisy, and some of Johnston's generals believe the element of surprise has been lost. Johnston, however, insists on fighting whatever the conditions.|$|R
