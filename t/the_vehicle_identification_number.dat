Standard equipment included: Turbo-Hydramatic 400 transmission, power steering, power brakes with front discs, power windows, power seats, Deluxe steering wheel, electric clock and full wheel discs. Standard tire size was J78-15. Interiors were vinyl, cloth or leather.

The investigators traced the SUV's last registered owner, and the female college student who sold the suspect the Pathfinder. Law enforcement officials recovered the suspect's pre-paid disposable cell phone's number from the cell phone of the seller, and ran it through a number of databases. They determined that the disposable phone had been used for calls to and from a Pakistani telephone number which they knew to be associated with Faisal Shahzad. The phone had also been used to call a fireworks store in rural Pennsylvania. They collected his e-mail address from an email which he sent to the seller’s computer.|$|E

On April16, 1995, he drove to Oklahoma City with fellow conspirator Terry Nichols where he parked a getaway car several blocks away from the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building. The nearby Regency Towers Apartments' lobby security camera recorded images of Nichols' blue 1984 GMC pickup truck on April 16.

40|$|International audienceDynamic IPv 6 {{addressing}} and routing configuration in vehicular networks is {{an important}} challenge that has attracted {{a fair amount of}} attention recently. Early proposals adapted fixed-infrastructure and MANET models and thus inherited their latency and overhead. Later, researchers relaxed some of the often restrictive assumptions (e. g., Router Advertisement TTL extension) but still focused on certain limited scenarios. Very recently, {{in the wake of the}} emerging concept of Future Internet, a general questioning arose on whether one naming and addressing model suits every network topology. Along this line of research, the present article poses the terms of this problem in the IP-based vehicular communications area and aims at giving one solution space instance based on <b>the</b> <b>Vehicle</b> <b>Identification</b> <b>Numbers</b> (VIN) namespace. This article advances the state-of-the-art as follows: (1) It presents a comprehensive and detailed tutorial of the main dynamic IPv 6 auto-configuration approaches.

2500|$|Most {{validation}} stickers {{are either}} serialized (with {{the serial number}} recorded on the registration), or are printed by a special printer {{at the time of}} registration or renewal with the vehicle's license plate number on them to discourage fraudulent sticker use, as the sticker will be valid only for the plate for which it was intended.

5000|$|Of {{particular}} note is {{that the}} innovative aluminum Buick-built 215 in³ (3.5 L) V8 was optional in the Tempest in 1961 and 1962. (This also had {{first appeared in the}} LeSabre.) It is estimated that just 3,662 Tempests were ordered with the 215 engine, or about 1% of production. This motor produced, in its various incarnations, from [...] despite weighing just 330 lb installed. The Pontiac 215 blocks are distinct from other Buick 215 blocks because in addition to the factory Buick markings they were hand-stamped at the Pontiac plant with <b>the</b> <b>Vehicle</b> <b>Identification</b> <b>Numbers</b> of <b>the</b> individual cars they were installed in. Thus, in 1961 all Pontiac 215 blocks begin [...] "161P"; the 1962 cars, [...] "162P". Further code numbers told whether the car had an automatic or manual transmission. In 1961, this would have been either a three-speed column-shifted manual with a non-synchromesh first gear or a two-speed automatic controlled by a small lever on the dash {{to the right of the}} ignition. This automatic—called [...] "TempesTorque" [...] in company literature but unmarked on the unit itself until 1963—was a type of Powerglide similar to, but sharing very few parts with, the one in the Chevrolet Corvair. (The next year, a floor-mounted, fully synchronized four-speed manual was added.) At its introduction, the Tempest was only available as a four-door pillared sedan and as a Safari station wagon. A pair of two-door coupes, one of which was named LeMans, were added at the end of 1961, both in the 1961 body style.|$|R

Each AMC vehicle was inspected to confirm that the engine displacement (identified by numbers cast on the block under the engine mounts) corresponded to its corresponding engine code in <b>the</b> <b>vehicle</b> <b>identification</b> <b>number</b> (VIN).

40|$|It {{has become}} widely {{accepted}} that information technology (IT) {{has had a}} profound influence on market transactions, with lower search costs for buyers often considered the key to lower prices and higher consumer welfare.

In this study, we investigate how market characteristics, {{the length of time}} the seller searches the auction marketplace for a buyer, and seller search in other websites influence the final sale price in online auctions. The online auction market for used vehicles provides a valuable opportunity to observe search processes of sellers, as <b>the</b> unique <b>vehicle</b> <b>identification</b> <b>number</b> associated with each <b>vehicle</b> enables <b>the</b> tracking of an individual item across both subsequent auctions and across other websites.
