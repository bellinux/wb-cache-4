Then when Hov called he said, 'I'm gonna do it with you.' I was like, 'Dag, this is big.' But when I did it, I kept it me and kept it 'hood. At first I ain't think she was gonna like it but she called and said she loved it. From there it was a wrap. That's history.

25|$|During 1964 the Communist regime made {{an attempt}} to change the Muslim names of the Pomaks in Kochan with Slavic ones but the attempt failed and only those loyal to the regime had their names changed. On 23 April 1972 {{in the town of}} Sarnitsa an {{appointed}} Bulgarian policeman was killed by five native Pomaks because of a confiscated driving license. One of the ravishers surrendered immediately while the rest made {{an attempt to}} escape to Greece but were arrested in Kochan where they had received temporary shelter. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> moment for the regime to make a second attempt for a forced name change since the inhabitants of the village were shocked by the incident and the authorities charged them with complicity in the murder. Thus the name change went relatively smooth.|$|E

500|$|After {{calling a}} number of minor {{witnesses}} (including the cab driver {{and the owner of}} the building Williams and Seymour lived in), the prosecution called Edgar Power. Power testified that Williams had bragged about shooting Walls in response to Powers' chaffing him about being a poor shot. According to Power, Williams responded to the chaff by saying, [...] "Well, <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> shot anyhow," [...] referring to the shot that had killed Walls. Williams' barrister Hastings later described Power as [...] " [...] utterly contemptible human being I have ever met," [...] and during his cross-examination Hastings highlighted Power's betrayal of his close friends, Williams and Seymour.|$|E
500|$|Talk of {{a canopy}} or halo {{to protect the}} driver was {{accelerated}} by the fatal Formula One accident that killed Jules Bianchi in October 2014 and an incident where Justin Wilson was fatally struck {{in the head by}} debris during an IndyCar race in August 2015. In particular, following Wilson's death, Allmendinger stated that he would [...] "never again" [...] run open-wheel cars, adding [...] "The only way I would do it is if they put in a closed cockpit over the car and tested it and they thought <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> direction in safety then I might think about doing it again." [...] As a result, several major open-wheel series have implemented cockpit protection systems, with Formula One, Formula Two, and Formula Three all planning to introduce the halo for the 2018 motorsport season.|$|E
500|$|Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel {{grew up in}} the 1940s and 1950s in the {{predominantly}} Jewish neighborhood of Forest Hills in Queens, New York, just three blocks away from one another, and attended the same schools, Public School 164 in Flushing, Parsons Junior High School, and Forest Hills High School. Individually, when still young, they developed a fascination with music; both listened to the radio and were taken with rock and roll as it emerged, particularly the Everly Brothers. When Simon first noticed Garfunkel, he was singing in a fourth grade talent show, and Simon thought <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> way to attract girls; he hoped for a friendship which eventually started in 1953 when they were in the sixth grade and appeared on stage together in a school play adaptation of Alice in Wonderland. That first stage appearance was followed by the duo forming a street-corner doo-wop group, the Peptones, with three other friends, and learning to harmonize together. [...] They began performing {{for the first time as}} a duo at school dances.|$|E

500|$|After {{releasing}} the successful debut album Ooooooohhh... On the TLC Tip (1992), TLC {{began working on}} the their second release called CrazySexyCool in late 1993 and continued through till September 1994. One of the album's tracks, [...] "Creep", was based on member Tionne [...] "T-Boz" [...] Watkins' own experience. She recalled it for Billboard: [...] "You're with a guy and he's not showing you attention, so another guy comes along and you're like, 'Hey, if you were where {{you were supposed to}} be, he couldn't be showing me attention right now!' I {{was in the middle of}} this drama, because the other guy was [...] friend, and my boyfriend was just not getting it together." [...] Watkins then shared this to the group's long-time writer-producer Dallas Austin, who she had known and with whom she had shared many stories since the two were teenagers. [...] "We thought <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> relationship to talk about because a lot of people don't admit that's how they feel – that their man's playing on them and they want to be with him so they seek attention elsewhere, but they really want to be with their guy," [...] she added.|$|E
500|$|The game's central story {{theme is}} the [...] "pursuit of the almighty dollar". Missions {{follow the lead}} characters' efforts to plan and execute {{complicated}} heists to accrue wealth for themselves. The team focused on money as the central theme {{in response to the}} 2007–08 financial crisis, as its effects turn the main characters back to a life of crime. [...] "We wanted this post-crash feeling, because it works thematically in this game about bank robbers", Houser explained. The positive reaction to Grand Theft Auto IVs [...] "Three Leaf Clover" [...] missionin which an elaborate heist is coordinated and executed by lead protagonist Niko Bellic and accomplicesencouraged the team to develop the story around the heists. Houser said that while [...] "Three Leaf Clover" [...] was well-received, the team had not captured the thrill of the robbery to their best abilities and wanted Grand Theft Auto V to achieve it. He explained, [...] "We wanted to have a couple of really strong bank robberies...It felt like <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> device that we'd never used in the past. Repeating ourselves is a fear when we're doing games where part of the evolution is just technological".|$|E
500|$|Quinn's storyline {{received}} widely divergent commentary. Hankinson {{thought the}} writers had missed {{an opportunity to}} [...] "do something hugely daring" [...] and also {{reduce the size of}} the cast. Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal characterized their message as [...] "Move on, folks, nothing to see here", added that [...] "there wasn’t even a scratch on her face" [...] and concluded that it was [...] "nice to know that touches of irony haven’t left the show". Strecker called Quinn [...] "a walking wheeling PSA about texting dangers in general". Dodge said that one of his [...] "favorite scenes" [...] of the episode was [...] "when Artie tries to get Quinn to wheel herself up a steep ramp outside McKinley". VanDerWerff noted the pair's [...] "chemistry" [...] as friends, and Rolling Stone Erica Futterman described [...] "Quinn's kids-in-wheelchairs bonding scenes with Artie" [...] as the [...] "second best thing about the episode". Michael Slezak of TVLine expressed the wish that the extras in the scene in the skateboard park [...] "had actually gotten a chance to, um, speak like real humans, not just like props for a kicky musical number". VanDerWerff's summation was that the episode [...] "gave Dianna Agron more shades to play than she’s usually asked to, and <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> thing".|$|E

500|$|The Cassandra Cain {{version of}} Batgirl, {{depicted}} as a biracial character (Half White and half Chinese), is notable {{as one of the}} most prominent characters of Asian descent to appear in American comic books. Jeffrey A. Brown states that while her ethnicity is rarely mentioned in the comic books, Asian women have had a long history in comics of being portrayed as martial artists and are often exploited as sex objects. However, in the case of Batgirl, [...] "Cassandra's racial identity is treated more implicitly than explicitly. Her costume design actually conceals her entire body so that while in her guise as Batgirl her ethnicity is completely unapparent." [...] The fact that her sexuality is also understated represents a shift away from the typical portrayals of women, and Asian women in particular. The most controversial aspect of her character came about during the One Year Later event, when she is reintroduced as a villain. The abrupt shift in her character brought about negative criticism from readership. When questioned about the change in characterization, writer Adam Beechen stated: [...] "They didn't present me with a rationale as to why Cassandra was going to change, or a motivating factor. That was left for me to come up with and them to approve. And we did that. But as far as to why the editors and writers and whoever else made the decision decided <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> direction, I honestly couldn't answer." ...|$|E
2500|$|After this {{contract}} to make historical documentaries finished, Hill {{worked for a}} time in the mail room at Universal ("Somebody told me <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> way to meet people"). He then got into in the training program of the Directors Guild of America, which enabled him to work in television as an apprentice. He observed and worked for over a year on such shows as Gunsmoke, Wild Wild West, Bonanza and Warning Shot. [...] "I did a lot of shows for a couple of weeks, they would rotate you through," [...] he says.|$|E

From a practical point of view, I needed to go make some money so I could keep my family going. It was costly for us to join the Apollo program.

2500|$|There was a {{great deal}} of secrecy {{surrounding}} the developments of Lambert's automobile. Operational tests were conducted with the window blinds pulled at the farm implement showroom where he ran it. Outside road tests were conducted at night on roads that were not used. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> thing since many times there were long intervals between being able to get the automobile started again after it stopped. It turned out that the villagers didn't even know what Lambert was working on since it was such a new concept. They didn't realize the significance of Lambert's horseless carriage. Lambert is said to have had the first automobile accident. One time when he was testing his [...] "horseless carriage" [...] at night in a secret run he drove his vehicle into a tree stump and ran into a hitching post.|$|E
2500|$|The poem further tells that Hrothgar was [...] "given {{victory in}} war" [...] {{and so his}} kinsmen eagerly {{followed}} him. He is both honest and generous: [...] "He broke no oaths, dealt out rings, treasures at his table". When Beowulf leads his men to Denmark, he speaks of Hrothgar to both a coast-guard and to Hrothgar's herald: he calls Hrothgar a [...] "famed king", [...] "famed warrior", and [...] "protector of the Scyldings" [...] (the ruling clan), and describes him as [...] "old and good." [...] The poet emphasizes that the Danes [...] "did not find fault" [...] with Hrothgar, [...] "for <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> King". When Beowulf defeats Grendel, Hrothgar rewards Beowulf and his men with great treasures, showing his gratitude and open-handedness. The poet says that Hrothgar is so generous that [...] "no man could fault him, who wished to speak the truth." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{second album}} Wings of Tomorrow was {{released}} {{one year later}} and the single [...] "Open Your Heart" [...] got interest from CBS Records who offered them an international contract in 1985.

We became a better band and <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> period for the band." [...] Keyboardist Mic Michaeli was soon recruited to play in live concerts, and became an official member of the band shortly after. At the same time, Tony Reno was fired because of his lack of motivation and alleged slacking off on rehearsals. Bassist Peter Olsson also claims that Reno was replaced on the albums by a drum machine. His replacement was Ian Haugland.|$|E

2500|$|Howe was an ambidextrous player, {{one of just}} a few skaters able to use the {{straight}} sticks of his era to shoot either left- or right-handed. As a young teen Howe played bantam hockey with the King George Athletic Club in his hometown of Saskatoon, winning his first championship with them in the 1942 Saskatchewan Provincial Bantam Hockey Finals. He received his first taste of professional hockey at age 15 in 1943 when he was invited by the New York Rangers to their training camp held at [...] "The Amphitheatre" [...] in Winnipeg, Manitoba. He played well enough there that the Rangers wanted Howe to sign a [...] "C" [...] form which would have given that club his NHL rights and to play that year at Notre Dame, a Catholic school in Wilcox, Saskatchewan, that was known for turning out good hockey players. Howe did not feel <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> fit for him and wanted to go back home to play hockey with his friends, and declined the Rangers' offer and returned to Saskatoon.|$|E
2500|$|On {{that same}} episode of Raw Is War, Foley then reverted to his Mankind character, who began wearing an untucked {{shirt with a}} loose necktie and ended his feud with The Undertaker. At King of the Ring, the two competed in the second-ever Hell in a Cell match in June 1998 at the Pittsburgh Civic Arena. Before this match, Foley and Terry Funk were {{discussing}} the previous year's Hell in a Cell (which took place at Badd Blood in October) that featured the Undertaker backdropping and slamming Shawn Michaels onto the chain-link ceiling of the cage. Foley and Funk were brainstorming {{ideas about how to}} top that match when Funk said, laughing, [...] "Maybe you should let him throw you {{off the top of the}} cage", Foley replied: [...] "Yeah," [...] I shot back, [...] "then I could climb back up – and he could throw me off again." [...] Man, <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> one, and we were having a good time thinking completely ludicrous things to do inside, outside, and on top of the cage. After a while I got serious and said quietly to Terry, [...] "I think I can do it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Wentzel {{was often}} {{asked how he}} managed to put his {{subjects}} at such ease while photographing them. [...] He observed that he read as many ethnographic studies of a region as possible, to avoid making culturally insensitive errors. He also tried {{to pick up a}} few words of the local language, and be as courteous as possible. He said that he often made friends with the people he was photographing. [...] "After we got to be friends, I would just back up and take the picture. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> part of my technique," [...] he said. He also brought a small musical box along with him, which helped to ease suspicion and win friends (especially among children). His choice of equipment also influenced his style. Wentzel told an interviewer in 1999 that, while in Africa, he used only lightweight 35 mm film cameras such as a Nikon or an Olympus OM-2. For more formal portraits, however, he used an 85mm portrait lens and Kodachrome film. When printing his photographs, he preferred the Ilfochrome process (which turned photographic slides into prints) and the gelatin silver print process.|$|E
