5|$|Rival {{producers}} of Somali shillings emerged after 1991. These included the Na shilling, which failed to gain widespread acceptance, and the Balweyn I and II, which were forgeries of pre-1991 bank notes. A competition for seigniorage drove {{the value of}} the money down to about $0.04 per SoSh (1000) note, approximately <b>the</b> <b>commodity</b> cost. Consumers have refused to accept bills larger than the 1991 denominations, which has helped stop the devaluation from spiraling further. The pre-1991 notes and the subsequent forgeries are treated as the same currency. It takes large bundles to make cash purchases.|$|E

5|$|The Commercial Import Program, {{sometimes}} {{known as}} <b>the</b> <b>Commodity</b> Import Program (CIP), was an economic aid arrangement between South Vietnam {{and its main}} supporter, the United States. It lasted from January 1955 until the Fall of Saigon in 1975 and the dissolution of South Vietnam following the invasion by North Vietnam after US forces had withdrawn from the country due to the 1973 cease-fire agreement. The initiative was a trading plan {{that was designed to}} inject large amounts of American capital into the South Vietnamese economy to help fuel its industrialisation, growth and self-sufficiency, without incurring the high levels of inflation that would normally occur in such a drastic injection of money.|$|E

In the 1994 elections, the Republican Party won unified control of the Congress {{for the first time}} in 40 years. In 1996, Clinton became the first Democrat since Franklin D. Roosevelt to be elected to a second full term. Clinton passed welfare reform and the State Children's Health Insurance Program, as well as financial deregulation measures, including the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and <b>the</b> <b>Commodity</b> Futures Modernization Act of 2000. In 1998, Clinton was impeached by the House of Representatives for matters related to a scandal that involved White House employee Monica Lewinsky. Clinton was acquitted by the Senate in 1999 and proceeded to complete his term in office. Clinton is only the second U.S. president to ever be impeached. During the last three years of Clinton's presidency, the Congressional Budget Office reported a budget surplus, the first such surplus since 1969. In foreign policy, Clinton ordered U.S. military intervention in the Bosnian and Kosovo wars, signed the Iraq Liberation Act in opposition to Saddam Hussein, and participated in the 2000 Camp David Summit to advance the Israeli–Palestinian peace process.|$|E
5|$|Thơ also {{retained}} {{a degree of}} influence over domestic economic policies, which ran far behind Diệm's priorities of absolute control over the military and other apparatus through which he maintained his rule. Despite never having been trained in economic matters, Thơ had a prominent hand {{in the administration of}} <b>the</b> <b>Commodity</b> Import Program, an American initiative akin to the Marshall Plan, whereby aid was funnelled into the economy through importing licenses rather than money, in order to avoid inflation. However, Thơ's administration of the program led to {{the vast majority of the}} imports being consumer goods for the upper classes, rather than capital goods to develop South Vietnam's economic capacity. Under Thơ's watch, the foreign trade deficit hovered between 150 and 200%, and the gap between the urban elite and the peasant majority grew. American advisers thought Thơ and the Ngô brothers continually went against their counsel because they were either incompetent or simply distrustful and thus did the opposite of what was recommended.|$|E

The paper challenges this pessimistic „resource curse? argument and sets out the conceptual reasons arguing that the strengthening of linkages to <b>the</b> <b>commodities</b> sector is an important avenue for industrial development. It sets out a general model of linkages between industry and services and <b>the</b> <b>commodities</b> sector which distinguishes between win-win and win-lose outcomes.

25|$|Many items {{have been}} used as {{commodity}} money such as naturally scarce precious metals, conch shells, barley, beads etc., as well as many other things that are thought of as having value. Commodity money value comes from <b>the</b> <b>commodity</b> out of which it is made. <b>The</b> <b>commodity</b> itself constitutes the money, and the money is <b>the</b> <b>commodity.</b> Examples of commodities that {{have been used}} as mediums of exchange include gold, silver, copper, rice, Wampum, salt, peppercorns, large stones, decorated belts, shells, alcohol, cigarettes, cannabis, candy, etc. These items were sometimes used in a metric of perceived value in conjunction to one another, in various commodity valuation or price system economies. Use of commodity money is similar to barter, but a commodity money provides a simple and automatic unit of account for <b>the</b> <b>commodity</b> which is being used as money. Although some gold coins such as the Krugerrand are considered legal tender, there is no record of their face value {{on either side of the}} coin. The rationale for this is that emphasis is laid on their direct link to the prevailing value of their fine gold content.|$|E

Using a Vector Autoregressive Model (VAR), we were able to analyze the causation relationships between the variables and compare the effect on the different industries and sectors. In order to analyze the effects from the financial crisis we made use of two sample periods, one going from 1994 through June 2008 : (1) and the other from 1994 up until today: (2). What we found was that the correlations between the price of crude oil and <b>the</b> <b>commodities</b> were higher in (2) for all but natural gas and iron ore, which decreased severely through the financial crisis. We further found that leading up to the financial crisis most of <b>the</b> agricultural <b>commodities,</b> coal and gold all shared a delayed but significant causation relationship with the crude oil price. In (2) however, only soybeans and rubber of <b>the</b> agricultural <b>commodities</b> proved to have a significant causation relationship with the crude oil price whereas both the metal sector and the energy sector as well as salmon proved to have a significant causation relationship with the crude oil price.
