50|$|The {{time scale}} of the {{stochastic}} process may be calendar or clock time or some more operational measure of time progression, such as mileage of a car, accumulated {{wear and tear on}} a machine component or accumulated exposure to toxic fumes. In many applications, the stochastic process describing the system state is latent or unobservable and its properties must be inferred indirectly from censored time-to-event data and/or readings taken over time on correlated processes, such as marker processes. The word ‘regression’ in threshold regression refers to first-hitting-time models in which one or more regression structures are inserted into the model in order to connect model parameters to explanatory variables or covariates. The parameters given regression structures may be parameters of the stochastic process, the <b>threshold</b> <b>state</b> and/or the time scale itself.|$|E

50|$|First hitting {{times are}} central {{features}} of many families of stochastic processes, including Poisson processes, Wiener processes, gamma processes, and Markov chains, to name but a few. The {{state of the}} stochastic process may represent, for example, {{the strength of a}} physical system, the health of an individual, or the financial condition of a business firm. The system, individual or firm fails or experiences some other critical endpoint when the process reaches a <b>threshold</b> <b>state</b> for the first time. The critical event may be an adverse event (such as equipment failure, congested heart failure, or lung cancer) or a positive event (such as recovery from illness, discharge from hospital stay, child birth, or return to work after traumatic injury). The lapse of time until that critical event occurs is usually interpreted generically as a ‘survival time’. In some applications, the threshold is a set of multiple states so one considers competing first hitting times for reaching the first threshold in the set, as is the case when considering competing causes of failure in equipment or death for a patient.|$|E

The pattern of the strong features in the emission spectra is very different in the fragmentation of ND 3 and ND 2 H, with a much wider range of angular momentum states being observed from the photolysis of the predissociative ((A) over tilde) state of unsymmetrical parent ND 2 H ((A) over tilde). The analysis is based upon the earlier studies of the electronic spectrum of ND 2, and model calculation based upon the stretch-bender Renner-Teller Hamiltonian.

40|$|The {{mechanism}} of flow slides initiation and motion is investigated {{by means of}} a newly-developed ring shear apparatus. Results of the investigation show that there is a <b>threshold</b> <b>state</b> demarcating sands that contract from those that dilate. The <b>threshold</b> <b>state</b> which is characterized by the equality of shear resistance and generated pore pressure at failure is independent of both initial confining stress and grading of specimens. The possibility of specimens exhibiting either contractive or dilative behaviors seems to depend on whether or not the threshold pore pressure is exceeded. When exceeded, specimens tend to collapse and liquefy. When the contrary is the case, specimens show dilative behaviors. Analyses {{of the relationship between the}} friction angle at <b>threshold</b> <b>state,</b> friction angle at phase transformation, and friction angle at steady state, show that all friction angles at phase transformation state, <b>threshold</b> <b>state,</b> and steady state are almost equal and appear to be independent of grading.

First, the aim {{of this study is to}} underline the importance of the concept of Neutrosophy that was introduced by the professor Florentin Smarandache correlated with the concept of the liminality.

Rituals, myths or rites are representing indeed a form of communication, but on an unclear level, determined by the uncertainty.

We conclude that while isocomplexity and following state both provide excellent agreement the numerical data, the influence of <b>threshold</b> <b>states</b> – that {{is still the most}} commonly considered theory – can be excluded from our data. Predicting the dynamical behavior from static calculations is the holy grail of theoreticians in statistical physics. After all, this is precisely what statistical mechanics is about from the very beginning: we prefer to consider the static average over all configurations rather than the complex dynamics of all atoms. A particularly important case, both in classical and quantum thermodynamics, is given by the dynamics after very slow variations in an external parameter so that the system remains at equilibrium. Such changes are said to be ”adiabatic”. When a macroscopic system is in a given phase and if one tunes a parameter, say the temperature, or the external field, very slowly then all observables, such as the energy or the magnetization in a magnet, will be given by the equilibrium equation of state. Given a system at equilibrium in a well-defined phase, it is always possible to consider the adiabatic evolution: In the low...|$|R

The question of whether and how these two states are related has been a subject of some controversy since 2000. The size-biasing in our result arises as an instance of a Markov renewal theorem, and implies that the threshold and stationary distributions are not equal even in the s 0 → − ∞ limit.

40|$|Many {{researchers}} have investigated first hitting times {{as models for}} survival data. First hitting times arise naturally in many types of stochastic processes, ranging from Wiener processes to Markov chains. In a survival context, {{the state of the}} underlying process represents the strength of an item or the health of an individual. The item fails or the individual experiences a clinical endpoint when the process reaches an adverse <b>threshold</b> <b>state</b> for the first time. The time scale can be calendar time or some other operational measure of degradation or disease progression. In many applications, the process is latent (i. e., unobservable). Threshold regression refers to first-hitting-time models with regression structures that accommodate covariate data. The parameters of the process, <b>threshold</b> <b>state</b> and time scale may depend on the covariates. This paper reviews aspects of this topic and discusses fruitful avenues for future research.
