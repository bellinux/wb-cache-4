5|$|Following the goal, Independiente under {{instruction}} from their manager José Pastoriza, began <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>back</b> {{in their own}} half inviting Liverpool to attack them. Their plan worked as Liverpool were unable to break down their defence, while their strikers Percudani and Alejandro Barberón counter-attacked when Independiente received the ball. The second half saw Liverpool continue to attack the Independiente goal, but to no avail. Midfielders John Wark and Mølby {{tried to find a}} way through the Independiente defence was equal to their efforts. Wark's efforts trying to engineer an equalising goal resulted in him being substituted for Ronnie Whelan in the 76th minute, due to fatigue.|$|E
5|$|The opening {{passages}} {{of the match}} were tentative. Faced with a hostile atmosphere, Liverpool were content <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>back</b> and frustrate Roma. Despite this tactic, Liverpool {{took the lead in}} the 15th minute. Souness and Sammy Lee exchanged passes before passing to Craig Johnston on the right hand side of the pitch. Johnston played a high cross into the Roma penalty area, which was challenged for by Roma goalkeeper Franco Tancredi and Ronnie Whelan. The result was that Tancredi dropped the ball, Roma defenders tried to clear the ball, but Michele Nappi's attempted clearance bounced off Tancredi's back and fell to Liverpool defender Phil Neal who scored to give Liverpool a 1–0 lead. Two minutes later, Souness volleyed the ball into the Roma goal from close range, but his goal was disallowed for offside.|$|E
25|$|The land {{upon which}} the city was built, as well {{as much of the}} {{surrounding}} area, was obtained by Englishman Thomas Fenwick from the Native Americans. In 1869, businessman Isaac Coffin built the first beach-front cottage to receive paying guests. During those days, people arrived by stage coach and ferry. They came to fish off the shore, to enjoy the natural beauty of the Atlantic Ocean pounding against the long strip of sandy beach, to collect seashells, or just <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>back</b> and watch the rolling surf.|$|E

25|$|The {{trail that}} splits from the {{snowmobile}} route {{a mile from}} the Platte Clove trailhead curves back another mile or so to Huckleberry Point, a steep and ledgy area which, due to past fires, offers many places <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>back</b> and look down into the clove. Since the route is mostly level, and the roundtrip considerably shorter than that required for the whole mountain, it is popular with those who hike only occasionally. Care must be taken at the Point, however, since some of the ledges also sit above sharp drops.|$|E
25|$|Dispensability in a {{group is}} {{described}} by Price as employees who join a work group and quickly begin to measure up their skills with {{the people that they}} are assigned to work with. If they feel that their skills are inferior to those around them, people tend <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>back</b> and let the other more skilled workers carry the workload. Fairness {{in a group}} is when some group members feel that their voice is not heard in decision making because of their ethnicity, gender or other discriminatory factors. Instead of fighting for their voice to be heard many group members will decide to loaf in these circumstances.|$|E
25|$|During {{the late}} 1980s, Courtney {{was part of}} a {{movement}} within the UDA that became frustrated with the directions being taken by the UDA leadership. He argued that too little was being done by the movement in terms of killing republicans as the leaders were too happy <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>back</b> and become rich from extortion and racketeering. Courtney was soon involved in conspiracies to overthrow the UDA leadership. These however came to nothing as the fallout from the Stevens Inquiries saw the existing leadership swept aside. For his part, Courtney would go on {{to become part of the}} new leadership that emerged in the 1990s around Johnny Adair.|$|E

Incidents in which women were ordered by ultra-Orthodox men <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> at the <b>back</b> of buses and were abused when they refused, have been reported. As of 2013, Haredim surrounded and stoned buses after the drivers explained to passengers that women cannot be forced <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> in the <b>back,</b> breaking windows until they were arrested; a month later, a secular man punched, and pulled the beard of, a Haredi who {{tried to get a}} woman to move, then he escaped arrest.|$|R

25|$|The {{following}} year, Wang Jian was recalled to lead {{a second}} invasion with 600,000 men. High in morale after their victory in the previous year, the Chu forces were content <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>back</b> and defend against what they {{expected to be a}} siege of Chu. However, Wang Jian decided to weaken Chu's resolve and tricked the Chu army by appearing to be idle in his fortifications whilst secretly training his troops to fight in Chu territory. After a year, the Chu defenders decided to disband due to apparent lack of action from the Qin. Wang Jian invaded at that point, with full force, and overran Huaiyang and the remaining Chu forces. Chu lost the initiative and could only sustain local guerrilla-style resistance until it too was fully conquered with the destruction of Shouchun and the death of its last leader, Lord Changping, in 223 BC. At their peak, the combined armies of Chu and Qin are estimated to have ranged from hundreds of thousands to a million soldiers, more than those involved in the campaign of Changping between Qin and Zhao 35 years earlier.|$|E

500|$|Nutter said of {{the episode}} [...] "I really worked hard {{to make it a}} special show, because I thought it was special. It was Gillian's {{post-traumatic}} stress episode, because she had not really had the opportunity to vent her feelings about the whole Duane Barry situation. This was an opportunity <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>back</b> and let all that happen." [...] Carter particularly liked the scene where a clearly disturbed Scully hugs Mulder, claiming it was a [...] "tender moment" [...] between two characters that had not shown that much affection for each other.|$|E

[...] "I'm not one <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>back</b> and say, 'Oh, I feel bad for what happened to them I want the whole world to sing , to bring us together as a world, because a song is a mantra, something you repeat over and over.

500|$|By June 2002, {{the band}} had {{completed}} A Rush of Blood to the Head, but thought their output sounded [...] "rubbish" [...] and {{reached an agreement}} with the label to postpone the release of the album until they were completely satisfied. Subsequently, many songs were discarded because they sounded like they could have been on Parachutes. Martin has claimed {{that it would have been}} uninteresting: [...] "It would have shown that we're happy <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>back</b> on what we'd done, and we're not. For us, it was important to progress and try to improve upon our abilities as musicians." [...] Such ambitions put the band under strain: [...] "sometimes practice sessions ended abruptly with one or more members of Coldplay threatening to quit".|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} filmed {{only two weeks}} after filming wrapped on the pilot episode, which Schur said he regretted because, [...] "Normally, you'd {{like to have the}} usual three months or so <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>back,</b> look at what you made, draw conclusions, tinker, and rewrite." [...] During [...] "The Reporter," [...] Parks and Recreation editor Dean Holland {{developed}} an editing technique that would be used {{throughout the rest of the}} series. During the scene in which Leslie reacts to quotes read to her by the reporter, Amy Poehler improvised a number of jokes, many of which were not going to be used. Holland thought they were all funny, so he created a brief montage inter-cutting several of the lines into the same scene.|$|E
500|$|Many {{critics of}} the time and since have {{declared}} it Cagney's best film, drawing parallels between Cohan and Cagney; they both began their careers in vaudeville, struggled for years before reaching the peak of their profession, were surrounded with family and married early, and both had a wife who was happy <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>back</b> while he went on to stardom. The film was nominated for eight Academy Awards and won three, including Cagney's for Best Actor. In his acceptance speech, Cagney said, [...] "I've always maintained that in this business, you're {{only as good as the}} other fellow thinks you are.

500|$|Polls were {{released}} {{at the end}} of the first week of campaigning, and showed a nine-point swing against Labor. Whitlam's campaign did not believe it at first, but additional polling made it clear: the electorate was turning against the ALP. The Coalition attacked Labor for the economic conditions, and released television commercials [...] "The Three Dark Years" [...] showing images from the Whitlam government scandals. The ALP campaign, which had concentrated on the issue of Whitlam's dismissal, did not begin to address the economy until its final days. By that time Fraser, confident of victory, was content <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>back,</b> avoid specifics and make no mistakes. There was little violence in the campaign, but three letter bombs were placed in the post; one wounded two people in Bjelke-Petersen's office, while the other two, addressed to Kerr and Fraser, were intercepted and defused.|$|E
25|$|A djembe and dunun {{ensemble}} traditionally {{does not}} play music for people <b>to</b> simply <b>sit</b> <b>back</b> and listen <b>to.</b> Instead, the ensemble creates rhythm {{for people to}} dance, sing, clap, or work to. The western distinction between musicians and audience is inappropriate in a traditional context. A rhythm is rarely played as a performance, but is participatory: musicians, dancers, singers, and onlookers {{are all part of}} the ensemble and frequently change roles while the music is in progress.|$|R

500|$|Along {{with his}} estrangement from McCartney, Lennon always felt a musical {{competitiveness}} {{with him and}} kept an ear on his music. During his five-year career break he was content <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>back</b> as long as McCartney was producing what Lennon saw as mediocre material. Lennon took notice when McCartney released [...] "Coming Up" [...] in 1980, which was the year Lennon returned to the studio and {{the last year of}} his life. [...] "It's driving me crackers!" [...] he jokingly complained, because he could not get the tune out of his head. That same year, Lennon was asked whether the group were dreaded enemies or the best of friends, and he replied that they were neither, and that he had not seen any of them in a long time.

500|$|Polls {{from the}} first week of campaigning showed a nine-point swing against Labor, which would have {{decimated}} Labor if repeated in an election.

On election night, 13 December, the Coalition won the largest majority government in Australian history, winning 91 seats to Labor's 36. Labor suffered a 6.5 percent swing against it and its caucus was cut almost in half, suffering a 30-seat swing. Labor was left with five fewer seats than it had when Whitlam took the leadership. The Coalition also won a 37–25 majority in the Senate.|$|E
