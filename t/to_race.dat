5|$|Under James' grandson, Charles II, a keen racegoer and owner, and James' {{great-granddaughter}} Queen Anne, royal {{support was}} given <b>to</b> <b>racing</b> and the breeding of race horses. With royal support, horse racing became {{popular with the}} public, and by 1727, a newspaper devoted <b>to</b> <b>racing,</b> the Racing Calendar, was founded. Devoted exclusively to the sport, it recorded race results and advertised upcoming meets.|$|R
5|$|He stopped {{racing and}} opened a {{motorcycle}} dealership in Wichita Falls in 1966. The dealership is still open (as of 2008), {{and it is now}} the oldest Honda and Kawasaki dealership in Texas. He soon wanted <b>to</b> <b>race</b> again, so he built his own motorcycle and began racing as a 30-year-old. He raced in numerous types of motorcycle racing: cross country, drag racing, hare scramble, motocross, road racing, and short track. When Hill participated in a Daytona race in 1971, he had an opening lap at , which was faster than factory rider Gary Nixon. Hill continued <b>to</b> <b>race</b> motorcycles and in 1972 and won the Texas state road racing championship. Hill won over 100 trophies in his motorcycle career.|$|E
5|$|Hill was {{qualifying}} for a 1997 event at Sonoma when his car suffered severe vibration {{as he crossed}} the finish line. The car went out of control and was completely destroyed. Hill had two broken toes and a shoulder contusion, which were not serious injuries. The run had been fast enough to make Hill the fastest qualifier, and Hill wanted <b>to</b> <b>race</b> his backup car in the first round on the day after the accident. The NHRA had a rule that the car used for qualifying had {{to be used in the}} event, so the sanctioning body did not allow him to compete. The rule was changed after the event to allow racers <b>to</b> <b>race</b> on race day even if they do not use the same car.|$|E
5|$|Jenson Button was {{required}} {{to apply to the}} stewards to be allowed <b>to</b> <b>race,</b> because he did not post a lap time during the first part of qualifying. They gave him permission to start based on his satisfactory practice times.|$|E

5|$|There {{was almost}} a return to F1 for Andretti at the 1984 Detroit Grand Prix when the Renault team put Mario on standby to replace regular driver Patrick Tambay if the Frenchman had been unable <b>to</b> <b>race,</b> {{as was the case}} at the {{previous}} race in Canada.

5|$|After {{over an hour}} {{behind the}} safety car, the field was {{released}} <b>to</b> <b>race</b> one last time with only twelve minutes remaining. With no close contests between the competitors, the field continued to run at less than racing pace, {{in preparation for the}} finish. The No. 8 Peugeot of Sébastien Bourdais briefly went into the pits, before returning to the track. To ensure that the Peugeot finished the race, and did not break down before crossing the finishing line behind the winner, Bourdais stopped at the Ford Chicanes on the final lap. Once the No. 1 Audi had gone past to take the checkered flag, Bourdais restarted the Peugeot and finished as well. The No. 16 Pescarolo finished the race in third, the highest placed petrol car.|$|E

5|$|Although a {{competitor}} on paper in 1988, Coates {{was supposed to}} only be a coach and was forbidden to compete. The Australian Skating Union had refused to select him as they wanted to allow younger athletes an opportunity <b>to</b> <b>race.</b> However, the AOF officially listed Coates as {{a competitor}} {{so that he could}} train with the others on the ice, and because the artificially inflated athlete count would entitle the Australian team to take more support staff. However, Coates was informed that the registration was only for show and that he was not <b>to</b> <b>race.</b> However, {{when it was time for}} his event, he put on a uniform, defied team orders and skated his best time ever. Henke publicly excoriated Coates in front of the cameras, but stopped when he found out that Prime Minister Bob Hawke had sent Coates a congratulatory message. However, Coates' new Australian record was only good enough for 26th place and ended his sixth and final Olympic campaign. His speed skating teammates Michael Richmond and Danny Kah managed two top 15 finishes each, and Medhurst was the only other Australian to place in the top 20.|$|E
5|$|Although {{drivers were}} not listed, Tom Kristensen's {{injury in the}} opening round of the 2007 Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters season made his {{participation}} in the race questionable. As the driver with the most wins at Le Mans, he {{was intended to be}} part of Audi's factory team. Fellow Audi DTM driver Mattias Ekström was nominated as his possible replacement by Audi. However, on 11 June 2007 Kristensen was cleared by doctors <b>to</b> <b>race,</b> leaving Ekström's services unneeded.|$|E
5|$|Americus (foaled 1892, died 1910), was an American Thoroughbred racehorse who was {{exported}} to England. He {{had some success}} as a racehorse, but was more notable for his influence at stud. He was bred in California and won the 1895 Culver Stakes prior to his export. He continued <b>to</b> <b>race</b> in England, until he was nine years old, while also standing as a breeding stallion. He stood at stud in Italy, Ireland, Germany, and Belgium before dying in Germany in 1910. Americus' most famous descendant was his great-granddaughter Mumtaz Mahal.|$|E

5|$|Andretti had {{continued}} <b>to</b> <b>race,</b> and occasionally win, in the USAC National Championship {{during his time}} in the Formula One world championship. In 1979 a new organization, Championship Auto Racing Teams, had set up the Indycar world series as a rival to the USAC National Championships that Andretti had won three times in the 1960s. The new series had rapidly become the top open wheel racing series in North America.|$|E
5|$|Andretti {{was also}} {{considered}} as a replacement, again for Tambay who had been injured in Canada, at the 1986 Detroit Grand Prix, this time for the Carl Haas owned Haas Lola team. Mario declined however, but recommended his son Michael Andretti for the drive. Unfortunately for Michael {{he was unable to}} obtain the FIA Superlicense required to allow him <b>to</b> <b>race</b> in Formula One. Instead the drive went to Eddie Cheever.|$|E

In 1966 he won five times (Cumberland, Maryland, Oswego, New York, Rossburg, Ohio, Phoenix, Arizona, and his second win at the Joe James-Pat O'Connor Memorial at Salem Speedway), but finished behind Roger McCluskey in the season championship. In 1967 he won {{two of the three}} events that he entered.|$|E

Thus, in 1948 was transferred to Huracán forming part of a barter in which three players of el Globo passed <b>to</b> <b>Racing</b> and five of the club of Avellaneda to Huracán.
