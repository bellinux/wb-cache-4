25|$|A {{second group}} of four tea party {{chimpanzees}} had arrived in 1959 and by February 1963 the council conceded that the <b>tea</b> <b>parties</b> had become unsafe to continue.

25|$|Cambridge's main {{traditional}} theatre is the Arts Theatre, a venue with 666 {{seats in}} the town centre. The theatre often has touring shows, {{as well as those}} by local companies. The largest venue in the city to regular hold theatrical performances is the Cambridge Corn Exchange with a capacity of 1,800 standing or 1,200 seated. Housed within the city's 19th century former corn exchange building the venue was used for a variety of additional functions throughout the 20th century including <b>tea</b> <b>parties,</b> motor shows, sports matches and a music venue with temporary stage. The City Council renovated the building in the 1980s, turning it into a full-time arts venue, hosting theatre, dance and music performances.|$|E
25|$|Older {{officials}} soon {{noticed that}} the new queen consort was an assertive and ambitious woman, unlike other queens preceding her. She {{did not participate in}} lavish parties, rarely commissioned extravagant fashions from the royal ateliers, and almost never hosted afternoon <b>tea</b> <b>parties</b> with the various princesses of the royal family or powerful aristocratic ladies unless politics required her to do so. While she was expected to act as an icon for Korea's high society, the queen rejected this role. Instead, she devoted time to reading books generally reserved for men (such as Spring and Autumn Annals and its accompanying Zuo Zhuan,) and furthered her own education in history, science, politics, philosophy, and religion.|$|E

[...] AFP and the <b>Tea</b> <b>Party</b> share many of the same principles. In 2010, AFP was one of the most influential organizations in the <b>Tea</b> <b>Party</b> movement, and the largest in terms of membership and spending. According to Bloomberg News, with AFP the Koch brothers [...] "harnessed the <b>Tea</b> <b>Party's</b> energy in service of their own policy goals, including deregulation and lower taxes....As the <b>Tea</b> <b>Party</b> movement grew in the aftermath of Obama’s election, the Kochs positioned Americans for Prosperity as the <b>Tea</b> <b>Party's</b> staunchest ally".|$|R

25|$|Auckland Zoo {{opened in}} 1922 {{experiencing}} early difficulties mainly due to animal health issues. By 1930 a sizeable collection of animals had been assembled and a zoological society formed. The zoo consolidated during the Second World War {{and was at}} that time under the leadership of Lt. Col. Sawer. After the war the collection was expanded, and in the 1950s chimpanzees were acquired to provide <b>tea</b> <b>parties</b> for the public's entertainment, but this practice ceased in 1964. In 1973 the zoo expanded into the adjacent Western Springs park. From the late 1980s to the present day, many old exhibits were phased out and replaced by modern enclosures. In 2011 the zoo opened its largest development, Te Wao Nui, which exhibits native New Zealand flora and fauna.|$|E

Her mental condition grows worse too, and she doesn't even acknowledge a riot {{in one of her}} classes. After that, Kitty Pryde states that Paige is in no condition to teach and suggests removing her from the active staff. In a burst of fury, Paige decides to quit the school, considering Kitty was about to fire her. Then, Paige decides to take some time for herself, leaving the school and telling Toad she will eventually come back. She even assures him she is in no need of psychiatric help.|$|E
500|$|Gibbons {{maintained}} a wide circle of friends, who in her later years included Adams, the entertainer Barry Humphries and the novelist John Braine. From the mid-1970s she established {{a pattern of}} monthly literary <b>tea</b> <b>parties</b> in Oakshott Avenue at which, according to Neville, [...] "she was known to expel guests [...] if they were shrill, dramatic, or wrote tragic novels." [...] As her own productivity dwindled and finally ceased altogether, she kept a commonplace book {{in which she was}} recording her thoughts and opinions on literature as late as 1988.|$|E

[...] Salon, in reference to its backing successful candidates in Republican primaries, has called the <b>Tea</b> <b>Party</b> Express a [...] "kingmaker (and queenmaker)." [...] According to the New York Times the <b>Tea</b> <b>Party</b> Express is considered “one of the movement’s most successful players” of the national <b>tea</b> <b>party</b> organizations.

500|$|She {{joined the}} staff of the {{newspaper}} in 1915, originally as a society columnist writing about <b>tea</b> <b>parties</b> and society events, but news was so slow she later admitted to making up some of her stories: [...] "Somebody would say, 'Who's that Mrs. T.Y. Washrag you've got in your column?' And I would say, 'Oh, you know, I don't think she's been here very long'". When her father went on vacation {{less than a year after}} her appearance in Miami, he left her the responsibility of the editorial page. She developed a rivalry with an editor at The Miami Metropolis whose greater familiarity with the history of Miami gave her cause to make fun of Douglas in writing. Her father scolded her to check her facts better.|$|E
500|$|After leaving Oxford, Driberg lived precariously in London, {{attempting}} to establish {{himself as a}} poet while doing odd jobs and pawning his few valuables. Occasionally he had chance encounters with Oxford acquaintances; Evelyn Waugh's diary entry for 30 October 1927 records: [...] "I went to church in Margaret Street where I was discomposed to observe Tom Driberg's satanic face in the congregation". Driberg had maintained his contact with Edith Sitwell, and attended regular literary <b>tea</b> <b>parties</b> at her Bayswater flat. When Sitwell discovered her protégé's impoverished circumstances she arranged an interview for him with the Daily Express. After his submission of an article on London's nightlife, he was engaged in January 1928 for a six-week trial as a reporter; coincidentally, Waugh had undergone an unsuccessful trial with the same newspaper a few months earlier.|$|E
500|$|Helena {{was also}} {{active in the}} {{promotion}} of needlework, {{and became the first}} president of the newly established School of Art Needlework in 1872; in 1876, it acquired the [...] "royal" [...] prefix, becoming the Royal School of Needlework. In Helena's words, the objective of the school was: [...] "first, to revive a beautiful art which had been well-nigh lost; and secondly, through its revival, to provide employment for gentlewomen who were without means of a suitable livelihood." [...] As with her other organisations, she was an active president, and worked to keep the school on an even level with other schools. She personally wrote to Royal Commissioners requesting money; for example, in 1895, she requested and acquired £30,000 for erecting a building for the school in South Kensington. Her royal status helped its promotion, and she held Thursday afternoon <b>tea</b> <b>parties</b> at the school for society ladies, who wanted to be seen in the presence of royal personages such as Princess Helena. When the Christmas Bazaar was held, she acted as chief saleswoman, generating long queues of people anxious to be served personally by her.|$|E
40|$|<b>Tea</b> <b>Party</b> affects American {{politics}} since 2009 {{when she}} began {{under the name of}} former revolutionary movement to fight government interventions with massive demonstrations. There was often incorrect expectation concerning <b>Tea</b> <b>Party's</b> potential {{in the first years of}} her activity. <b>Tea</b> <b>Party</b> supporters cannot be easily characterized, since a very differentiated group of Americans identifies itself with the movement, they come from a broad scale of social groups from Religious Right to libertarians or radical populists, which makes <b>Tea</b> <b>Party</b> an easy subject of criticism. Such criticism is often related to accusations of racism and rigid approach to social issues, to which contributed also certain <b>Tea</b> <b>Party</b> candidates. Nationwide political radicalization, which <b>Tea</b> <b>Party</b> allegedly caused up to a great extent, cannot be confirmed, though, radicalization can be discerned rather within the ideologically differentiated Congress. Although the elections of 2010 and 2012 brought a group of <b>Tea</b> <b>Party</b> supporters into the Congress, it wasn't such a significant success, as many of her protagonists expected. <b>Tea</b> <b>Party</b> established the <b>Tea</b> <b>Party</b> Caucus as an organizational tool.

500|$|Faust was {{initially}} hired by Hasbro {{to create a}} pitch bible for the show, allowing her to get additional help with conceptualization. Faust said she was [...] "extremely skeptical" [...] about taking the job at first because she had always found shows based on girls' toys to be boring and unrelatable. My Little Pony {{was one of her}} favorite childhood toys, but she was disappointed that her imagination at the time was nothing like the animated shows, in which the characters, according to Faust, [...] "just had endless <b>tea</b> <b>parties,</b> giggled over nothing and defeated villains by either sharing with them or crying". With the chance to work on My Little Pony, she hoped to prove that [...] "cartoons for girls don't have to be a puddle of smooshy, cutesy-wootsy, goody-two-shoeness". To do this, she incorporated into the design of the characters and the show many elements that contradicted idealized stereotypes of girls, such as diverse personalities, the message that friends can be different and can get into arguments but still be friends, and the idea that girls should not be limited by what others say they can or cannot do. Elements of the characters' personalities and the show's settings were based on her own childhood imagination of the ponies' adventures, in part inspired by the animated shows that her brothers would watch while growing up, such as Transformers and she considered that she was making Friendship Is Magic [...] "for me as an eight-year-old". Faust still aimed for the characters to be [...] "relatable" [...] characters, using stereotypical [...] "icons of girliness" [...] (such as the waif or the bookworm) in order to broaden the appeal of the characters for the young female audience.|$|E

The first order of the new regime was Provisional Constitutional Act No. 1, signed by Minh, formally suspending the 1956 constitution created by Diệm. Minh was said to have preferred playing mah-jongg, playing tennis at the elite Cercle Sportif, tending to his garden and giving <b>tea</b> <b>parties</b> to fighting the Viet Cong or running the country. He was criticised for being lethargic and uninterested. Stanley Karnow said [...] "He was a model of lethargy, lacking both the skill and the inclination to govern".
