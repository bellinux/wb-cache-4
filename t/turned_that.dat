5|$|An earlier, longer, {{work-in-progress}} {{version of}} the film was rejected for competition by the Cannes Film Festival, which offered that cut of Mr. Nobody an out-of-competition berth. Producer Philippe Godeau <b>turned</b> <b>that</b> down. The decision by the Cannes Film Festival not to exhibit the film created a national controversy. Eventually, the studio held the film's world premiere at the 66th Venice International Film Festival on 12 September 2009. Six days later, Mr. Nobody screened as a special presentation during the 2009 Toronto International Film Festival. Additionally, the film was screened at the Sitges Film Festival and the Stockholm International Film Festival before its theatrical release. Mr. Nobody had its American premiere on 25 June 2011, at the Los Angeles Film Festival, nearly two years since its original debut. It was among more than 200 feature films, short projects, and music videos, from more than 30 countries, to be shown at the festival. The Consul General of Belgium, Geert Criel, held a second United States screening of Mr. Nobody on 21 December 2011, at the Aero Theatre in Santa Monica.|$|E
25|$|The North's most {{important}} war measure {{was perhaps the}} creation of a system of national banks that provided a sound currency for the industrial expansion. Even more important, the hundreds of new banks that were allowed to open were required to purchase government bonds. Thereby the nation monetized the potential wealth represented by farms, urban buildings, factories, and businesses, and immediately <b>turned</b> <b>that</b> money over to the Treasury for war needs.|$|E

25|$|With Lindros out indefinitely, the Flyers {{rallied to}} {{overcome}} the distractions and a 15-point deficit in the standings to win the Atlantic Division and the top seed in the East {{on the last day}} of the regular season. They easily defeated their first round opponent, Buffalo, in five games. Primeau's goal in the fifth overtime of Game 4 against the team's second-round opponent, Pittsburgh, <b>turned</b> <b>that</b> series in the Flyers' favor as they won in six games, coming back from a 2–0 series deficit. After dropping Game 1 to New Jersey in the Eastern Conference Finals, the Flyers peeled off three-straight wins to take a 3–1 series lead. But New Jersey refused to give up. After New Jersey won Game 5, Lindros returned to the lineup for the first time since March for Game 6 in another losing effort. Early in Game 7, Lindros was on the receiving end of a controversial hit by Scott Stevens, giving him another concussion and leaving the Philadelphia crowd deflated. Without Lindros, the Flyers lost the decisive game by a score of 2–1. It was the second time in franchise history the team lost a series after being up three games to one. New Jersey went on to win the Stanley Cup.|$|E
25|$|In {{the third}} quarter, after a Patriots punt, an 8-yard {{touchdown}} catch from Romo to wide receiver Patrick Crayton put the Patriots behind 24–21. However, the Patriots offense continued {{to move the}} ball too, with a 77-yard drive ending on a one-yard touchdown reception by Kyle Brady. Following a Cowboys punt that gave the Patriots the ball in Cowboys territory, the Patriots appeared to extend their lead on a 43-yard Moss touchdown catch, but the play was reversed as Moss was found not have caught the ball. A roughing the passer penalty was called on the play, though, setting up a 45-yard Gostkowski field goal to make the score 31–24. The Cowboys would punt {{early in the fourth}} quarter. Four plays later, Brady threw his fifth touchdown pass of the day, a franchise record. Stallworth's 69-yard catch gave the Patriots a 38–24 lead, but the Cowboys quickly responded with a 72-yard kickoff returnby Tyson Thompson. The Cowboys <b>turned</b> <b>that</b> return into three points on a 23-yard field goal by Folk. The Patriots then ate more clock, moving 61yards in just over six minutes, adding to their lead on a 22-yard Gostkowski field goal. Romo was intercepted by Seau on the next play, allowing the Patriots to run out more clock before Kyle Eckel ran in for a 1-yard touchdown. Romo then kneeled to end the game with a 48–27 final.|$|E

500|$|According to Taraborrelli, the {{defining}} moment of Madonna's childhood was the tragic and untimely {{death of her}} beloved mother. Psychiatrist Keith Ablow suggests her mother's death would have had an immeasurable impact on the young Madonna {{at a time when}} her personality was still forming. According to Ablow, the younger a child is at the time of a serious loss, the more profound the influence and the longer lasting the impact. He concludes that [...] "some people never reconcile themselves to such a loss at an early age, Madonna is not different than them." [...] Conversely, author Lucy O'Brien feels the impact of the rape she suffered is, in fact, the motivating factor behind everything Madonna has done, more important even than the death of her mother: [...] "It's not so much grief at her mother's death that drives her, as the sense of abandonment that left her unprotected. She encountered her own worst possible scenario, becoming a victim of male violence, and thereafter <b>turned</b> <b>that</b> full-tilt into her work, reversing the equation at every opportunity." ...|$|E

I want them to know that I'm down with it if they want me to, but I completely understand if it doesn't necessarily work ... They've got a lot of story lines going on there." [...] But in March 2012, Shonda Rhimes said that there are no plans at the moment for the character to return, [...] "I think it was really nice to hear her appreciating the show. At the same time we are on a track we have been planning. The idea of changing that track is not something we are interested in right now."

2500|$|According to comics {{historian}} Coulton Waugh, a 1947 poll {{of newspaper}} readers who claimed they ignored the comics page altogether revealed that many confessed {{to making a}} single exception: Li'l Abner. [...] "When Li'l Abner made its debut in 1934, {{the vast majority of}} comic strips were designed chiefly to amuse or thrill their readers. Capp <b>turned</b> <b>that</b> world upside-down by routinely injecting politics and social commentary into Li'l Abner.

The technique—as invigorating as it was unorthodox—was later adopted by cartoonists like Walt Kelly [...] and Garry Trudeau ," [...] wrote comic strip historian Rick Marschall. According to Marschall, Li'l Abner gradually evolved into a broad satire of human nature. In his book America's Great Comic Strip Artists (1989), Marschall's analysis revealed a decidedly misanthropic subtext.|$|E

Murray-Leach [...] "...turned the ship around, so it was drawn to look as if it were going one way but flew the other way. In fact, if you take the line of flow, the angles go with it {{to get a sense of}} speed, and we <b>turned</b> <b>that</b> around so the 'wings' all canted forwards, not backwards". Murray-Leach's role as designer of the ship proved to be contentious with the series' special effects designer, Ian Scoones.
