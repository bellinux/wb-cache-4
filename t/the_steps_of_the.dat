5|$|Privy Counsellors {{have the}} right to sit on <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sovereign's Throne in the Chamber of the House of Lords during debates, a {{privilege}} which was shared with heirs apparent of those hereditary peers who were to become members of the House of Lords before Labour's partial Reform of the Lords in 1999, diocesan bishops of the Church of England yet to be Lords Spiritual, retired bishops who formerly sat in the House of Lords, the Dean of Westminster, Peers of Ireland, the Clerk of the Crown in Chancery and the Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod. While Privy Counsellors {{have the right}} to sit on <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sovereign's Throne they do so only as observers and are not allowed to participate in any of the workings of the House of Lords. Nowadays this privilege is rarely exercised. A notable recent instance of the exercising of this privilege was used by the Prime Minister, Theresa May, who watched the opening of the debate of the European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Bill 2017 in the House of Lords.|$|E

When the black singer Marian Anderson was denied {{the use of}} Washington's Constitution Hall by the Daughters of the American Revolution in 1939, Eleanor resigned from the group in protest and helped arrange another concert on <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lincoln Memorial. Roosevelt later presented Anderson to the King and Queen of the United Kingdom after Anderson performed at a White House dinner. Roosevelt also arranged the appointment of African-American educator Mary McLeod Bethune, {{with whom she had}} struck up a friendship, as Director of the Division of Negro Affairs of the National Youth Administration. To avoid problems with the staff when Bethune would visit the White House, Eleanor would meet her at the gate, embrace her, and walk in with her arm-in-arm.|$|E
5|$|In {{the uniform}} cost model (suitable for {{analyzing}} {{the complexity of}} gcd calculation on numbers that fit into a single machine word), {{each step of the}} algorithm takes constant time, and Lamé's analysis implies that the total running time is also O(h). However, in a model of computation suitable for computation with larger numbers, the computational expense of a single remainder computation in the algorithm can be as large as O(h2). In this case the total time for all of <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> algorithm can be analyzed using a telescoping series, showing that it is also O(h2). Modern algorithmic techniques based on the Schönhage–Strassen algorithm for fast integer multiplication can be used to speed this up, leading to quasilinear algorithms for the GCD.|$|E

5|$|Life {{magazine}} {{decided to}} publish a photo story for their January 15, 1951 edition, which would document {{the results of the}} competition and feature a photograph of the protesters. Life initially wanted to photograph the painters on <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Metropolitan, with their paintings. They refused {{on the grounds that it}} would look like they were trying to enter the museum, but were being rebuffed. The magazine capitulated; art editor for Life, Dorothy Seiberling, sent photographer Nina Leen to photograph them at a studio on 44th Street. They assembled there on November 24. Only three of the original signatories were absent: Weldon Kees, Hans Hofmann, and Fritz Bultman. Pollock made a special trip with James Brooks for the session.|$|E
5|$|Oldham's Old Town Hall is a Grade II listed Georgian neo-classical {{town hall}} built in 1841, {{eight years before}} Oldham {{received}} its borough status. One of the last purpose-built town halls in northwest England, it has a tetrastyle Ionic portico, copied from the temple of Ceres, on the River Ilissos, near Athens. Winston Churchill made his inaugural acceptance speech from <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> town hall {{when he was first}} elected as a Conservative MP in 1900. A Blue Plaque on the exterior of the building commemorates the event. Long existing as the political centre of the town, complete with courtrooms, the structure has stood empty since the mid-1980s and has regularly been earmarked for redevelopment as part of regeneration project proposals, but none have been actioned.|$|E

They were met by his cabinet and staff on <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> state capitol building—which was festooned with greenery and a large welcome sign for the occasion—and they gave Stowe a round of loud and exuberant cheers.|$|E

5|$|Jesse Sage, {{associate}} director of the American Anti-slavery Group, and Jacobs persuaded Bok to move to Boston to work with the AASG. He was initially hesitant to leave his new friends in Ames, but according to Bok, the people at AASG were persistent. He arrived in Boston on May 14, 2000, AASG helped him find an apartment. A week after moving to Boston, he was invited to speak at a Baptist church in Roxbury and was interviewed by Charles A. Radin of The Boston Globe. Two days after his speech in Roxbury, Bok was asked to meet with supporters of AASG on <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> United States Capitol in Washington, D.C. He returned to Washington on September 28, 2000, and became the first escaped slave to speak before the United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations. Francis was invited to Washington again in 2002 for the signing of the Sudan Peace Act and met with President George W. Bush. It was during this trip to the White House that Bok became the first former slave to meet with a U.S. President since the 19th century.|$|E

In 1996, when Crowded House decided to break up, they organised a farewell concert as a charity event for the Sydney Children's Hospital on 24 November. They approached Powderfinger and fellow Australian acts Custard and You Am I to also appear on <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sydney Opera House. The charity event, which was recorded and later released as a live album titled Farewell to the World, was claimed to have the largest Australian live concert audience, with estimates of between 100,000 and 250,000 people. In {{the wake of the}} 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami, Powderfinger performed at the WaveAid fund-raising concert in Sydney in January 2005. The disaster killed more than 225,000 people from 11 countries in the area. The total profit from the funds raised from ticket sales and donations was A$2,300,000, however most of this money was spent in the administrative stream with little reaching those affected.|$|E

Following the confrontation, it is revealed that Bud has turned state's evidence and was wearing a wire to record his encounter with Gekko. He turns the wire tapes over to the authorities, who suggest that he may get a lighter sentence in exchange for helping them make a case against Gekko. Later on, Bud's parents drive him down FDR Drive towards the New York State Supreme Court Building downtown to answer for the crimes he committed under Gekko's influence.
