5|$|To be most {{effective}} at controlling a pest, a biological control agent requires a colonizing ability which allows it {{to keep pace with}} changes to the habitat in space and time. Control is greatest if the agent has temporal persistence, so that it can maintain its population even in the temporary absence of the <b>target</b> <b>species,</b> and if it is an opportunistic forager, enabling it to rapidly exploit a pest population.|$|E
5|$|Poisoned bait is {{a common}} method for {{controlling}} rats, mice, birds, slugs, snails, ants, cockroaches and other pests. The basic granules, or other formulation, contains a food attractant for the <b>target</b> <b>species</b> and a suitable poison. For ants, a slow-acting toxin is needed so that the workers have time to carry the substance back to the colony, and for flies, a quick-acting substance to prevent further egg-laying and nuisance. Baits for slugs and snails often contain the molluscide metaldehyde, dangerous to children and household pets.|$|E
25|$|Because the plasmid is the “vehicle” {{from which}} the {{immunogen}} is expressed, optimising vector design for maximal protein expression is essential. One way of enhancing protein expression is by optimising the codon usage of pathogenic mRNAs for eukaryotic cells. Pathogens often have different AT-contents than the <b>target</b> <b>species,</b> so altering the gene sequence of the immunogen to reflect the codons more commonly used in the <b>target</b> <b>species</b> may improve its expression.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Microbial cell – soluble species {{interactions}} {{can be part}} {{of technologies}} for the treatment of metal/metalloid and radionuclide bearing water streams in order to sequester the <b>targeted</b> <b>species.</b> Interactions of microbial cells and soluble <b>targeted</b> <b>species</b> include passive and active processes of metabolically inactive or active biomass, and result in the reduction of their mobility and toxicity. Different parts of the cell may sequester <b>targeted</b> <b>species</b> via processes such as complexation, chelation, coordination, ion exchange, precipitation and reduction. Collectively, these mechanisms have been referred to as sorption and the overall phenomenon as biosorption. The term biosorption is generally used to describe the passive interaction of microbial biomass with <b>targeted</b> <b>species.</b> The technologies based on these processes, lead to the set up of units, mainly in the form of packed bed reactors similar to the configuration of ion exchange resins reactors, placed {{at the end of a}} treatment process as a polishing stage. In order to maintain durability of the sorbent, the microbial cells harvested from different sources, are formulated into particles by way of immobilization – pelletization. In the early years of Biosorption, a significant effort was devoted to study the reusability of the sorbent by repeated sorption – desorption cycles, in order to reduce the operating cost of the technology. The availability of the biosorbent material, the reversibility of the desorptio...|$|R

5000|$|A Fishery is in EconMult {{defined as}} a unique Fleet/Targeted species combination. The total catch within each fishery may include all biomass units defined in the model. Each biomass unit vessel catch is {{computed}} by Cobb-Douglas production function, applying two input variables: Number of fishing days d) and Biomass unit x). In the matrix below each column represents a fleet group and each row a <b>targeted</b> <b>species</b> so each element in the matrix is a fishery and gives the vessel catch of the biomass units represented. The biomass units represent all the <b>targeted</b> <b>species.</b> Each catch is represented a Cobb-Douglas production equation {{as shown in the}} vessel yield matrix (Y): ...|$|R
25|$|Which of {{the various}} {{techniques}} an angler may choose is dictated mainly by the <b>target</b> <b>species</b> and by its habitat. Angling can be separated into two main categories: using either artificial or natural baits.|$|E
25|$|Despite their {{worldwide}} distribution and great abundance, {{there are few}} functioning fisheries for squat lobsters. Experimental fisheries have occurred in several countries, including Argentina, Mexico and New Zealand, but commercial exploitation is currently restricted to Latin America, and chiefly to Chile. The main <b>target</b> <b>species</b> are Pleuroncodes monodon, P.planipes and Cervimunida johni.|$|E
25|$|Interfering with insects' {{reproduction}} can {{be accomplished}} by sterilizing males of the <b>target</b> <b>species</b> and releasing them, so that they mate with females but do not produce offspring. This technique was first used on the screwworm fly in 1958 and has since been used with the medfly, the tsetse fly, and the gypsy moth. However, this can be a costly, time consuming approach that only works on some types of insects.|$|E
5000|$|EconMult is a {{discrete}} time simulation model where the fleet activity {{is controlled by}} two variables: Number of vessels (v) (within each fleet segment) and Number of fishing days d) (within each time interval). The biomass units (x) are exogenous variables. The model resolution is determined by four structural variables: Number of fleet groups j), Number of <b>targeted</b> <b>species</b> n), Number of biomass units i) (which {{may be more than}} one within each <b>targeted</b> <b>species)</b> and Period length (time step in the simulation). The number of vessels and fishing days therefore are presented in fleet (columns)-targeted species (rows) matrices, while the biomass units is presented in a column vector (X): ...|$|R

50|$|The fringefin {{trevally}} is not {{a commercially}} <b>targeted</b> <b>species,</b> but still makes up {{a small percentage of}} the northern Australian prawn trawls. They are occasionally taken by anglers on bait or small lures and considered to be mediocre table fish.|$|R
25|$|Pesticide use {{raises a}} number of {{environmental}} concerns. Over 98% of sprayed insecticides and 95% of herbicides reach a destination other than their <b>target</b> <b>species,</b> including non-target species, air, water and soil. Pesticide drift occurs when pesticides suspended {{in the air as}} particles are carried by wind to other areas, potentially contaminating them. Pesticides are one of the causes of water pollution, and some pesticides are persistent organic pollutants and contribute to soil contamination.|$|E
25|$|It {{may seem}} {{reasonable}} to assume that irradiating food might lead to radiation-tolerant strains, similar to the way that strains of bacteria have developed resistance to antibiotics. Bacteria develop a resistance to antibiotics after an individual uses antibiotics repeatedly. Much like pasteurization plants, products that pass through irradiation plants are processed once, and are not processed and reprocessed. Cycles of heat treatment have been shown to produce heat-tolerant bacteria, yet no problems have appeared so far in pasteurization plants. Furthermore, when the irradiation dose is chosen to target a specific species of microbe, it is calibrated to doses several times the value required to target the species. This ensures that the process randomly destroys all members of a <b>target</b> <b>species.</b> Therefore, the more irradiation-tolerant members of the <b>target</b> <b>species</b> are not given any evolutionary advantage. Without evolutionary advantage, selection does not occur. As to the irradiation process directly producing mutations that lead to more virulent, radiation-resistant strains, the European Commission's Scientific Committee on Food found that there is no evidence; on the contrary, irradiation has been found to cause loss of virulence and infectivity, as mutants are usually less competitive and less adapted.|$|E
25|$|Fishing {{techniques}} may {{be altered}} to minimize bycatch and reduce impacts on marine habitats. These techniques include using varied gear types depending on <b>target</b> <b>species</b> and habitat type. For example, a net with larger holes will allow undersized fish to avoid capture. A turtle excluder device (TED) allows sea turtles and other megafauna {{to escape from}} shrimp trawls. Avoiding fishing in spawning grounds may allow fish stocks to rebuild by giving adults a chance to reproduce.|$|E
50|$|TEDs {{were first}} {{developed}} in the 1970s by Wil Seidel, who worked for NOAA. Some resistance {{to the use of}} TEDs has arisen from the belief that the use of the devices actually causes fishermen to lose shrimp and other <b>targeted</b> <b>species.</b>|$|R

5000|$|This fish {{is caught}} for human {{consumption}} throughout most of its range but is not in general a <b>targeted</b> <b>species</b> due to its small size. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed its conservation status as being of [...] "least concern".|$|R
25|$|The {{combined}} nets {{are maintained}} {{more or less}} vertically in the usual way by floats on the floatline and weights on the groundline. They are set on the bottom. After a time depending on the <b>target</b> <b>species,</b> they are hauled on board. Traditional combined nets were hauled by hand, especially on smaller boats. Recent hydraulic driven net haulers are now common. The gilled, entangled and enmeshed fish are removed from the net by hand. Of some concern with this method is ghost fishing by lost nets and bycatch of diving seabirds. Nets combined in this way were first used in the Mediterranean.|$|E
25|$|DNA {{microarray}} {{analysis is}} currently being used in AM fungal research to simultaneously measure the expression of many genes from <b>target</b> <b>species</b> or experimental samples. The most common tool or method is to use functional gene array (FGA) technology, a specialized microarray that contains probes for genes that are functionally important in microbial processes such as carbon, nitrogen or phosphorus cycling. FGAs {{have the ability to}} simultaneously examine many functional genes. This technique is typically used for general analysis of functional microbial genes, but when complemented with genetic sequencing, inferences can be made about the connection between fungal community composition and microbial functionality.|$|E
25|$|In many places, {{managers}} have opted {{to regulate the}} harvest of kelp and/or the taking of kelp forest species by fisheries. While these may be effective in one sense, they do not necessarily protect {{the entirety of the}} ecosystem. Marine protected areas (MPAs) offer a unique solution that encompasses not only <b>target</b> <b>species</b> for harvesting, but also the interactions surrounding them and the local environment as a whole. Direct benefits of MPAs to fisheries (for example, spillover effects) have been well documented around the world. Indirect benefits have also been shown for several cases among species such as abalone and fishes in Central California. Most importantly, MPAs can be effective at protecting existing kelp forest ecosystems and may also allow for the regeneration of those that have been affected.|$|E
50|$|While the {{incredible}} increase in snapper density {{resulted from the}} immigration of adult fish into the reserve, rather than from within-reserve recruitment, these results suggests that partial fishing regulations, as implemented {{in the early years}} of the reserve, are ineffective for protecting <b>targeted</b> <b>species.</b>|$|R
50|$|From 2007 to 2011, the Seawatch SW {{survey was}} {{organised}} by Dr Russell Wynn {{with the aim}} of recording the numbers of <b>targeted</b> <b>species</b> from a designated location close to the cliff edge on Gwennap Head. The survey ran from 15 July to 15 October each year and most of the recording was by volunteers who spent up to twelve hours a day on seawatch. The main <b>targeted</b> <b>species</b> were Balearic shearwater (Puffinus mauretanicus) and basking shark, along with the ocean sunfish (or common mola). Marine mammals such as whales, dolphins and grey seal (Halichoerus grypus) were additional main targets. During a seawatch on 28 August 2015 a red-billed tropicbird (Phaethon aethereus) was seen over the Runnel Stone, a bird that usually frequents tropical areas.|$|R
50|$|From the 2000s onwards, the dorado {{has been}} {{increasingly}} {{recognized as a}} fly-fishing <b>targeted</b> <b>species.</b> Its aggressive behavior and initiative taking flies as an active predator, paired with great fight energy, frequently going airborne {{in the attempt to}} loosen itself from the hook, make this species a true gamefish.|$|R
25|$|The {{management}} of wildlife is restricted to, firstly, {{the protection of}} fauna from poaching, and, secondly, designation of some areas as wildlife sanctuaries where no extraction of forest produce is allowed and where the wildlife face few disturbances. Although the fauna of Bangladesh have diminished in recent times and the Sundarbans has not been spared from this decline, the mangrove forest retains several good wildlife habitats and their associated fauna. Of these, the tiger and dolphin are <b>target</b> <b>species</b> for planning wildlife management and tourism development. There are high profile and vulnerable mammals living in two contrasting environments, and their statuses and management are strong indicators of the general condition and {{management of}} wildlife. Some species are protected by legislation, notably by the Bangladesh Wildlife (Preservation) Order, 1973 (P.O. 23 of 1973).|$|E
25|$|Much of {{the catch}} is shrimp and sardines, with about three {{quarters}} exported to the United States. In 2002, the catch totaled 456,805 tons of seafood with a value of about 2,031 million pesos. In addition to what is caught at sea, there is active fish farming which raises mostly oysters and shrimp. Much of the commercial and sports fishing is essentially unregulated and has had a very pronounced impact on the Gulf of California, with commercially important species such as shrimp, groupers, snappers, corvinas, yellowtail, billfishes have been harvested well above sustainability. Two species which have been particularly hard hit are sharks and manta rays. In addition, shrimp trawling catches {{a large amount of}} non <b>target</b> <b>species,</b> which are discarded, and have destroyed large areas of the Gulf’s seafloor. All this has led to rapidly declining harvests.|$|E
25|$|Fly {{fishing is}} most renowned {{as a method}} for {{catching}} trout, grayling and salmon, {{but it is also}} used {{for a wide variety of}} species including pike, bass, panfish, and carp, as well as marine species, such as redfish, snook, tarpon, bonefish and striped bass. Many fly anglers catch unintended species such as chub, bream and rudd while fishing for 'main target' species such as trout. A growing population of anglers attempt to catch as many different species as possible with the fly. With the advancement of technology and development of stronger rods and reels, larger predatory saltwater species such as wahoo, tuna, marlin and sharks have become <b>target</b> <b>species</b> on fly. Realistically any fish can be targeted and captured on fly as long as the main food source is effectively replicated by the fly itself and suitable gear is used.|$|E
50|$|Lobsters {{are widely}} fished {{around the world}} for their meat. They are often hard to catch in large numbers, but their large size can make them a {{profitable}} catch.
