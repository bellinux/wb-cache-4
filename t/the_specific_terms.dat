5|$|In its {{broadest}} definition, mimicry {{can include}} non-living models. <b>The</b> <b>specific</b> <b>terms</b> masquerade and mimesis are sometimes used when the models are inanimate. For example, {{animals such as}} flower mantises, planthoppers and geometer moth caterpillars resemble twigs, bark, leaves or flowers. Many animals bear eyespots, which are hypothesized to resemble the eyes of larger animals. They may not resemble any specific organism's eyes, {{and whether or not}} animals respond to them as eyes is also unclear. Nonetheless, eyespots are the subject of a rich contemporary literature.|$|E

Bohemond {{had no choice but to}} accept, now that his disease-stricken army would no longer be able to defeat Alexios in battle. He admitted that he had violated the oath sworn in 1097, but refused to acknowledge that it had any bearing on the present circumstances, as Alexios, in Bohemond's eyes, had also violated the agreement by turning back from the siege of Antioch in 1098.

500|$|On no {{issue was}} Brownlee's {{relationship}} with the King government more critical {{than it was for}} the control of natural resources. [...] The terms under which Alberta, like Saskatchewan and Manitoba, entered Canada left control of its natural resources with the federal government; the British North America Act gave control of the older provinces' natural resources to their provincial governments. [...] While Alberta did receive compensation {{in the form of an}} annual grant, Brownlee, like his three immediate predecessors, felt that it was insufficient. [...] The federal government had been committed since 1920 to the principle of transferring resource control to the province; only <b>the</b> <b>specific</b> <b>terms</b> of the transfer remained to be established. [...] Alberta, though willing to give up the grant, felt that it was owed compensation for land grants and mineral leases that were made by the federal government, but which Alberta would be expected to honour after the resources were transferred.|$|E
500|$|Others, like {{journalist}} Nick Gillespie, see The Great Gatsby {{as a story}} [...] "underlying {{permanence of}} class differences; {{even in the face}} of a modern economy's attempt to assert that the class structure is based; not on status and inherited position; but, upon the innovation and the ability of literally anyone, to succeed by meeting the ever-changing demands and tastes of consumers' needs." [...] This interpretation asserts that The Great Gatsby captures the American experience because it is a story about change and those who resist it; whether the change comes in the form of a new wave of immigrants (Southern Europeans in the early 20th century, Latin Americans today), the nouveau riche, or successful minorities, Americans from the 1920s to modern day have plenty of experience with changing economic and social circumstances. As Gillespie states, [...] "While <b>the</b> <b>specific</b> <b>terms</b> of the equation are always changing, it's easy to see echoes of Gatsbys basic conflict between established sources of economic and cultural power and upstarts in virtually all aspects of American society." [...] Because this concept is particularly American and can be seen throughout American history, readers are able to relate to The Great Gatsby (which has lent the novel an enduring popularity).|$|E
