There are fifteen to twenty types of marine mammals, including whales, dolphins, seals, walruses, and polar bears.|$|E

5|$|While <b>the</b> <b>Arctic</b> tern {{is similar}} to the common and roseate terns, its colouring, profile, and call are {{slightly}} different. Compared to the common tern, it has a longer tail and mono-coloured bill, while the main differences from the roseate are its slightly darker colour and longer wings. <b>The</b> <b>Arctic</b> tern's call is more nasal and rasping than that of the common, and is easily distinguishable from that of the roseate.|$|E

5|$|Among animals, {{variable}} snow camouflage {{is a type}} {{of seasonal}} polyphenism with a distinct winter plumage or pelage. It is found in birds such as the rock ptarmigan, lagomorphs such as <b>the</b> <b>Arctic</b> hare, mustelids such as the stoat, and one canid, <b>the</b> <b>Arctic</b> fox. Since these have evolved separately, the similar appearance is due to convergent evolution. Some high Arctic species like the snowy owl and polar bear however remain white all year round.|$|E

5|$|Hall had {{no special}} {{academic}} background or sailing experience (he was a blacksmith, engraver, then {{owner of a}} Cincinnati newspaper), {{but he was a}} voracious reader with an obsession for <b>the</b> <b>Arctic.</b> After John Franklin's 1845 expedition was lost, Hall's focus was directed toward <b>the</b> <b>Arctic.</b> He was able to launch two expeditions in search of Franklin and his crew; one in 1860–63, and a second in 1864–69. These experiences established him as a seasoned Arctic explorer, and gave him valuable contacts among the Inuit people. The renown he gained eventually allowed him to convince the United States government to fund his third expedition, an attempt on the North Pole.|$|E
5|$|In 1893 Nansen {{had driven}} his ship Fram into <b>the</b> <b>Arctic</b> pack ice off the {{northern}} Siberian coast and {{allowed it to}} drift in the ice towards Greenland, hoping that this route would cross the North Pole. In the event, the drift did not approach the pole, and an attempt by Nansen and Hjalmar Johansen to reach it on foot was likewise unsuccessful. Nevertheless, Nansen's strategy became the basis of Amundsen's own Arctic plans. He reasoned that if he entered <b>the</b> <b>Arctic</b> Ocean via the Bering Strait, well {{to the east of}} Nansen's starting point, his ship would achieve a more northerly drift and pass near or through the pole.|$|E

5|$|Long term {{forecasts}} {{are made}} {{based on these}} effects.

5|$|On {{a longer}} timescale, animals like <b>the</b> <b>Arctic</b> hare, Arctic fox, stoat, and rock {{ptarmigan}} have snow camouflage, changing their coat colour (by moulting and growing new fur or feathers) from brown or grey {{in the summer}} to white in the winter; <b>the</b> <b>Arctic</b> fox is the only species in the dog family to do so. However, Arctic hares which live in the far north of Canada, where summer is very short, remain white year-round.|$|E
