5|$|Sol quickly {{falls for}} Naz when they meet, but his anger threatens their relationship. Sol {{has never met}} a girl like Naz before, and Cole said Naz {{probably}} has not met boys like Sol before either. Hussen said that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> Sol that attracts Naz. She is stronger than he is so Naz likes to take him in and teach him things. Cole explained that Sol is attracted to Naz because she is different from other girls and they are complete opposites. and Sol depends on him. Looking after Sol takes a toll on Asher, however. One of Cole's first scenes to film was a kiss between Sol and Naz. Cole found it tough and awkward as the actors had only just met, and would have preferred it to be filmed later on, but said that the scene was awkward anyway so {{he did not have}} to act much for it. Sol has also been described as shy, caring, sweet, thoughtful, soft, easily hurt and reserved.|$|E
500|$|The {{performances}} of the lead characters were generally praised, especially Basset's. In her review for The New York Times, Janet Maslin said that [...] "Mr. Fiennes gleefully captures Lenny's sleaziness while also showing <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> this schlockmeister that is worth saving, despite much evidence to the contrary. As for Ms. Bassett, she looks great and radiates inner strength even without the bone-crunching physical feats to which she is often assigned." [...] Similarly, Peter Travers of Rolling Stone called Strange Days Bigelow's [...] "magnum opus", and added, [...] "In a film of striking performances, Bassett's is the standout—she is fierce, funny and heart rending". In contrast, Sizemore and Lewis were considered miscast in their roles. At the 22nd Saturn Awards, Bassett won Best Actress and Bigelow {{became the first woman}} to win the Best Director award.|$|E
500|$|Film score {{composer}} James Newton Howard {{was approached}} by Shyamalan to work on Unbreakable immediately after scoring The Sixth Sense. [...] "He sat there and storyboarded the whole movie for me", Howard said. [...] "I've never had a director do that for me." [...] Shyamalan wanted a [...] "singularity" [...] tone for the music. [...] "He wanted something that was very different, very distinctive, that immediately evoked the movie when people heard it," [...] Howard explained. Howard and Shyamalan chose to simplify the score, and minimized the number of instruments (strings, trumpets and piano), with limited orchestrations. Some compositions were recorded in a converted church in London. [...] "You could have recorded the same music in a studio in Los Angeles, {{and it would have}} been great, but <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> the sound of that church studio," [...] Howard remarked. [...] "It's definitely more misterioso." ...|$|E

500|$|Although Sakura is {{the most}} {{recurring}} female character in Naruto, Masashi Kishimoto did not originally intend for Sakura to be the heroine of the series. Kishimoto attributes this to his being unable to draw good heroine characters and fashioned Sakura as a girl who cannot understand men, {{the best example of}} a heroine he could come up with. Sakura's creation is a result of Kishimoto's desire to make a somewhat irritating character who was well-intentioned. Despite these elements, Kishimoto is fond of Sakura, as he feels that many of her personality traits are common among all people, thus giving her a sense of real humanity. When asked in an interview if <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> Sakura's background that was never revealed, Kishimoto explains that he has never thought of Sakura as she is a [...] "normal girl." [...] Kishimoto has often been asked by readers about why he did not show Sakura's parents until the film [...] In response, he said this would not be entertaining as Sakura does not belong to any clan unlike other characters so her parents were civilians.|$|E
500|$|Naz {{believes}} that her new friends can {{take her away}} from her home life. She {{falls in love with}} Sol, which Hussen said leads to Naz having to make a difficult decision as Sol is [...] "the wrong person". Naz turns out to be not as strong as first expected, and she puts up a wall. Hussen said that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> Sol that attracts her, and as she is stronger than he is, she sees it as taking him in and teaching him. Sol falls for Naz very quickly, and Cole said they have never met people like each other before. Naz is a party girl who loves to have fun, but causes trouble and drama, such as when her argument with Fatboy in episode 1 leads to a fight between the [...] and 2. Hussen said that this was her favourite scene to film. Not everyone gets on with Naz straight away. She is confident and fiery, she has a strong power and people listen to what she has to say. Emer Kenny, who played ZsaZsa Carter in series 1 of EastEnders: E20 {{and was one of the}} writers, introducing the characters in the first episode, said that although Naz was her favourite character to write for, she found it a challenge as she is funny but not a [...] "clown" [...] like Fatboy. Kenny compared Naz to ZsaZsa, saying she is clever but cool, feisty, sassy and able to outwit Fatboy. Kenny also admired the character's costume and makeup, saying she looked perfect and was exactly as she imagined her to look.|$|E

2500|$|In the 7th century, the Tang dynasty {{established}} hegemony in China. Their second Emperor Taizong esteemed Wang Xizhi's calligraphic {{texts and}} this popularity influenced Japanese calligraphers. All {{of the original}} texts written by Wang Xizhi have been lost, and copies such as Gakki-ron [...] written by the Empress Kōmyō are highly regarded as important sources for Wang Xizhi's style. However Wang's influence can barely be overstated, in particular for the wayō [...] style unique to Japan: [...] "Even today, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> Japanese calligraphy that retains the unchanged flavour of Wang Xizhi's style".|$|E
2500|$|From {{the next}} room, {{the sound of}} the {{orchestra}} is heard and the guests move there to dance. After a series of severe coughs and almost fainting, Violetta begins to feel dizzy and asks her guests to go ahead and to leave her to rest until she recovers. While the guests dance in the next room, Violetta looks at her pale face in her mirror. Alfredo enters and expresses his concern for her fragile health, later declaring his love for her (Alfredo, Violetta: Un dì, felice, eterea – [...] "One day, happy and ethereal"). At first, she rejects him because his love means nothing to her, but <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> Alfredo that touches her heart. He is about to leave when she gives him a flower, telling him to return it when it has wilted, which will be the very next day.|$|E
2500|$|Common wisdom {{tells us}} that beauty {{is in the eye}} of the beholder. [...] Sircello’s {{philosophy}} runs counter to this maxim. [...] He maintained that beauty is objective in a very particular way. [...] His starting point is the recognition that when a judgment of beauty is made <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> the object that is thought to be beautiful. [...] For example, if an alpine sunset seen as beautiful, this is due to the quality of light expressed in the sunset, or perhaps because of the intense depth of the vista, or because of some other attribute of the scene that stands out as exceptional in some way. [...] Beauty resides for Sircello in the possession by objects, scenes, actions, and so on of qualities to a very high degree. [...] Qualities of lack, deficiency or defect are excluded from this because these qualities are not enjoyed qualities.|$|E

2500|$|Hanson {{repeatedly}} accused President Barack Obama {{of engaging}} in [...] "appeasement" [...] of Russia. Hanson argues that Vladimir Putin is the embodiment of [...] "eternal Russia", an aggressively expansionist and anti-Western nation whose people are innately anti-democratic. In a 2012 column titled [...] "History Never Quite Ends", Hanson wrote: [...] "From the czars to the Soviet Communists to Vladimir Putin's cronies, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> constitutional government and liberal rule that bothers Mother Russia. The more that progressive outsiders seek to lecture or reform Russians, {{the more likely they}} are to bristle and push back with left-wing or right-wing nationalist strongmen. At present, we do not know whether there will be a Czar Vladimir, Comrade Putin, or Putin Inc. in charge, but we fear it does not matter much". Hanson depicts modern Russia in unflattering terms as [...] "...a disaster of a declining population, corruption, authoritarianism, a warped economy, and a high rate of alcoholism." [...] Precisely because Russia is so weak, Hanson claims that Putin is driven to aggression against his neighbors with the overwhelmingly support of the Russian people out of a sense of hurt pride and a desire to make Russia great again. In 2014, Hanson called Putin [...] "evil", writing: [...] "Putin is almost Milton's Satan—as if, in his seductive evil, he yearns for clarity, perhaps even a smackdown, if not just for himself, for us as well. He is not the better man than Obama but, again like Milton's Satan, the more interesting, if only because he reminds of us of our own limitations." [...] In a 2015 column, Hanson wrote about what he views as the aims of Russian foreign policy that: [...] "Russian president Vladimir Putin thinks he can reconstitute the empire of the czars and the later Soviet Union. American [...] "reset" [...] diplomacy green-lighted his annexation of the Crimea and his occupation of areas of Ukraine. Should Putin wish to absorb Estonia or other Baltic States, NATO probably would not stop him." ...|$|E
