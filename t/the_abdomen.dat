5|$|<b>The</b> <b>abdomen</b> {{consists}} of ten segments, {{some of which}} may be obscured by a large pair of operculate gills, a thoracic shield (expanded part of the prothorax) or the developing wing pads. In most taxa up to seven pairs of gills arise from the top or sides of <b>the</b> <b>abdomen,</b> but in some species they are under <b>the</b> <b>abdomen,</b> and in a very few species the gills are instead located on the coxae of the legs, or the bases of the maxillae. <b>The</b> <b>abdomen</b> terminates in a pair of, or three, slender thread-like projections.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>abdomen</b> of all mantises {{consists}} of 10 tergites, with a corresponding set of nine sternites visible in males and seven visible in females. <b>The</b> <b>abdomen</b> {{tends to be}} slimmer in males than females, but ends {{in a pair of}} cerci in both sexes.|$|E
5|$|The {{exoskeleton}} of <b>the</b> <b>abdomen</b> {{is divided}} into plates called dorsal tergites and ventral sternites. Wax is secreted from glands on <b>the</b> <b>abdomen</b> and extruded between the sternites where it resembles flakes of dandruff. It is secreted by the queen when she starts a nest and by young workers. It is scraped from <b>the</b> <b>abdomen</b> by the legs, moulded until malleable and used {{in the construction of}} honeypots, to cover the eggs, to line empty cocoons for use as storage containers and sometimes to cover the exterior of the nest.|$|E

5|$|The {{thoracic}} segments {{have one}} ganglion on each side, which are connected into a pair, one pair per segment. This arrangement is also seen in <b>the</b> <b>abdomen</b> {{but only in}} the first eight segments. Many species of insects have reduced numbers of ganglia due to fusion or reduction. Some cockroaches have just six ganglia in <b>the</b> <b>abdomen,</b> whereas the wasp Vespa crabro has only two in the thorax and three in <b>the</b> <b>abdomen.</b> Some insects, like the house fly Musca domestica, have all the body ganglia fused into a single large thoracic ganglion.|$|E
5|$|The thorax {{has three}} {{segments}} and houses the powerful wing muscles. They have {{two pairs of}} membranous wings that may be hyaline, cloudy or pigmented. The wing venation varies between species and may help in identification. The middle thoracic segment has an operculum on the underside, which may extend posteriorly and obscure parts of <b>the</b> <b>abdomen.</b> <b>The</b> <b>abdomen</b> is segmented, with the hindermost segments housing the reproductive organs, and terminates in females with a large, saw-edged ovipositor. In males, <b>the</b> <b>abdomen</b> is largely hollow and used as a resonating chamber.|$|E
5|$|Adults {{are mostly}} white, but the front {{half of the}} rostrum, and the sides of <b>the</b> <b>abdomen,</b> are pink. Bright red bands extend across {{the base of the}} rostrum, the {{posterior}} edge of the carapace, the chelipeds, and each of the abdominal segments. The dorsal parts of <b>the</b> <b>abdomen</b> are brown, and there are two brown saddles on the dorsal carapace.|$|E

50|$|Oliver {{described}} the North Island snipe as being generally {{similar to other}} Coenocorypha snipes. He added that it differed from the South Island snipe in the “greater area of buffy white on chin and throat, the absence of bars on <b>the</b> lower <b>abdomen,</b> <b>the</b> crescent-shaped markings on <b>the</b> upper <b>abdomen</b> and <b>the</b> less rufous general coloration”.|$|R
5|$|Butterflies of the Parnassinae (family Papilionidae) {{and some}} Acraeini (family Nymphalidae) add a post-copulatory plug, called the sphragis, to <b>the</b> <b>abdomen</b> {{of the female}} after {{copulation}} preventing her from mating again.|$|E
5|$|In {{common with}} most crabs, <b>the</b> <b>abdomen</b> is folded under the thorax and shows clear sexual dimorphism: in males it is {{comparatively}} narrow, {{whereas in the}} female it is wider.|$|E
5|$|Monotrysian: Primitive {{groups have}} a single genital {{aperture}} {{near the end of}} <b>the</b> <b>abdomen</b> through which both copulation and egg laying occur. This character is used to designate the Monotrysia.|$|E
40|$|Centrosome amplification, however, {{does not}} {{necessarily}} leadcompromised {{in the presence of}} extra centrosomes, and larval brain cells with extra centrosomes can generate metastatic tumors when transplanted into <b>the</b> <b>abdomens</b> of wild-type hosts. Thus, centrosome amplification can initiate tumorigenesis in flies...|$|R
50|$|Breathe from <b>the</b> lower <b>abdomen.</b> As you exhale, <b>the</b> lower <b>abdomen</b> goes in; as you inhale <b>the</b> lower <b>abdomen</b> goes out. This {{breathing}} {{technique is}} almost the same throughout all different meditations with few exception. It is important {{to do this in}} a natural way, not tensing or forcing the stomach muscles. Before long, you will feel any stress related tension in your chest fall away as the fire energy descends and the water energy rises. This process is called suseunghwagang (水昇火降).|$|R
40|$|Adipose tissue {{located in}} the viscera is {{considered}} to be functionally and metabolically different from that found in the subcutaneous depot. However, subcutaneous adipose tissue in generalized regions {{is considered to be}} homogeneous in nature. Affymetrix GeneChip Human Exon 1. 0 ST Arrays were used to determine differential gene expression in four subcutaneous adipose depots (upper abdomen, lower abdomen, flank and hip) in normal weight women. A total of 2890 / 24, 409 transcripts were differentially expressed between all sites. When comparing the hip and flank to <b>the</b> lower <b>abdomen,</b> 248 and 83 genes were differentially expressed, respectively. When comparing the hip and flank to <b>the</b> upper <b>abdomen,</b> 2480 and 79 genes were differentially expressed, respectively. No genes were significantly different when <b>the</b> lower <b>abdomen</b> was compared to <b>the</b> upper <b>abdomen</b> and <b>the</b> hip to the flank. Genes involved in the complement and coagulation cascades and immune responses showed increased expression in <b>the</b> lower <b>abdomen</b> compared to <b>the</b> flank. In addition, two genes involved in the complement and coagulation cascade, CR 1 and C 7, were expressed more highly in <b>the</b> lower <b>abdomen</b> compared to <b>the</b> hip. Genes involved in basic biochemical metabolism including insulin signaling, the urea cycle, glutamate metabolism, arginine and proline metabolism and aminosugar metabolism had higher expression in <b>the</b> lower <b>abdomen</b> compared to <b>the</b> hip. These results in normal weight healthy women provide a new perspective on regional differences in subcutaneous adipose tissue biology that may have pathophysiologic implications when adiposity increases...|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>abdomen</b> is {{the section}} behind the metathorax, {{made up of}} a series of rings, each with a hole for {{breathing}} and respiration, called a spiracle, composing three different segmented sclerites: the tergum, pleura, and the sternum. The tergum in almost all species is membranous, or usually soft and concealed by the wings and elytra when not in flight. The pleura are usually small or hidden in some species, with each pleuron having a single spiracle. The sternum is the most widely visible part of <b>the</b> <b>abdomen,</b> being a more or less sclerotized segment. <b>The</b> <b>abdomen</b> itself does not have any appendages, but some (for example, Mordellidae) have articulating sternal lobes.|$|E
5|$|The {{females are}} iron blue, and have orange legs and black antennae. This is a notable {{distinction}} from Sirex juvencus, which has red antennae. The females also have yellowish wings. The ovipositor {{is below the}} tapering tip of <b>the</b> <b>abdomen.</b> The sting is connected with the mycetangia, which are special organs on <b>the</b> <b>abdomen,</b> where the female stores the oidiae (asexual fungus spores), from broken segments of hyphae. These spores are deposited, together with the eggs, in the host tree wood to germinate. Both larvae and adults have strong mandibles and can drill through lead plates.|$|E
5|$|The {{females of}} some moths have a scent-emitting organ {{located at the}} tip of <b>the</b> <b>abdomen.</b>|$|E
50|$|Adults {{live for}} about 10 days after {{eclosion}} {{and do not}} eat, but may drink if water is available. The mating system is polygamous; many females will only mate once, however. In mating, which takes several hours, <b>the</b> <b>abdomens</b> are placed end to end.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>abdomens</b> of M. quadrifasaciata queens swell with ovarian development, making older queens {{larger than}} workers which {{is typical of}} most social bees. Queens vary {{slightly}} in their coloring, having brown eyes and brown hair compared to the black eyes and hair of worker bees.|$|R
50|$|Zosteraeschna is the {{scientific}} {{name of a}} genus of dragonflies from the family Aeshnidae. These relatively large dragonflies are also known as hawkers. They are dark brown with yellow-green markings; On <b>the</b> <b>abdomens</b> of <b>the</b> males, much {{of the top of}} S2 and base of S3 are blue.|$|R
5|$|The {{fore and}} hind wings {{are similar in}} shape, being long and narrow, with {{numerous}} cross-veins, and somewhat resembling those of primitive insects such as mayflies. A few genera, however, have reduced wings, or have lost them altogether. <b>The</b> <b>abdomen</b> is cylindrical with eleven segments, {{the first of which}} is fused to the metathorax. The cerci consist of one or two segments. <b>The</b> <b>abdomen</b> typically curves upwards in the male, superficially resembling the tail of a scorpion, the tip containing an enlarged structure called the genital bulb.|$|E
5|$|The thorax {{is made up}} {{of twelve}} body {{segments}}, the last of which is fused to the first segment of <b>the</b> <b>abdomen.</b> There is no carapace, but each of the eleven free segments bears a pair of phyllopodia, which have a series of bristles pointing along the animal's midline. <b>The</b> <b>abdomen</b> consists of seven segments without appendages, and a slender telson which bears a pair of caudal rami.|$|E

2500|$|Final {{weight gain}} takes place, {{which is the}} most weight gain {{throughout}} the pregnancy. <b>The</b> woman's <b>abdomen</b> will transform in shape as it drops due to the fetus turning in a downward position ready for birth. During the second trimester, <b>the</b> woman's <b>abdomen</b> would have been upright, whereas in the third trimester it will drop down low. The fetus moves regularly, and is felt by the woman. Fetal movement can become strong and be disruptive to the woman. The woman's navel will sometimes become convex, [...] "popping" [...] out, due to <b>the</b> expanding <b>abdomen.</b>|$|R
50|$|Treatment using {{anakinra}} (Kineret) {{has been}} shown effective for FCAS, although this does mean daily injections of the immunosuppressant into an area such as <b>the</b> lower <b>abdomen.</b> <b>The</b> monoclonal antibody canakinumab (Ilaris) is also used.|$|R
5000|$|The female seahorse (hippocampus) {{deposits}} {{eggs into}} the pouch on <b>the</b> male's <b>abdomen.</b> <b>The</b> male releases sperm into the pouch, fertilizing the eggs. The embryos develop within the male's pouch, nourished by their individual yolk sacs.|$|R
5|$|A {{person with}} cholangitis may {{complain}} of abdominal pain (particularly {{in the right}} upper quadrant of <b>the</b> <b>abdomen),</b> fever, rigors (uncontrollable shaking) {{and a feeling of}} uneasiness (malaise).

5|$|Coconut crabs mate {{frequently}} and quickly {{on dry land}} in the period from May to September, especially between early June and late August. Male coconut crabs have spermatophores and deposit a mass of spermatophores on <b>the</b> <b>abdomen</b> of the female; <b>the</b> <b>abdomen</b> opens {{at the base of}} the third pereiopods, and fertilisation is thought to occur on the external surface of <b>the</b> <b>abdomen</b> as the eggs pass through the spermatophore mass. The extrusion of eggs occurs on land in crevices or burrows near the shore. Shortly thereafter, the female lays her eggs and glues them to the underside of her abdomen, carrying the fertilised eggs underneath her body for a few months. At the time of hatching, the female coconut crab releases the eggs into the ocean. This usually takes place on rocky shores at dusk, especially when this coincides with high tide. The empty egg cases remain on the female's body after the larvae have been released, and the female eats the egg cases within a few days.|$|E
5|$|Dragonflies (suborder Anisoptera) are heavy-bodied, strong-flying {{insects that}} hold their wings {{horizontally}} both in flight and at rest. By contrast, damselflies (suborder Zygoptera) have slender bodies and fly more weakly; most species fold their wings over <b>the</b> <b>abdomen</b> when stationary, {{and the eyes}} are well separated {{on the sides of}} the head.|$|E
50|$|In fashion, midriff is <b>the</b> human <b>abdomen.</b> <b>The</b> midriff {{is exposed}} when wearing a crop top or {{some forms of}} swimwear. The cholis worn by Indian women exposes a thin section of midriff, usually 3 to 4 inches.|$|R
