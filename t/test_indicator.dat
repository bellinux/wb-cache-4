50|$|Originally, {{universal}} measuring {{machines were}} created to fill a need to continuously measure geometric features in both an absolute and comparative capacity, rather than a point based coordinate measuring system. A CMM provides a rapid method for inspecting absolute points, but geometric relationships must be calculated rather than measured directly. In theory? By using an accurate spindle with an electronic <b>test</b> <b>indicator</b> rather than a probe, a universal measuring machine fills this need. The indicator can be accurately controlled and moved across a part, either along a linear axis or radially around the spindle, to continuously record profile and geometry. This gives the universal machine a very strong advantage over other measuring methods when profiling radii, contours, and holes, as the detail of the feature can be of any arbitrary resolution. The analog record generated by the machine can be fed directly into a compensator on computer numerical control (CNC) machine tools, correcting the machine on a per-job basis.|$|E

Because a centerless grinding line has typically three grinding machines the operator must be in complete control and must prevent blockages in transfers, grinding exits and packing areas, also size and quality must constantly be checked, so the operator is always alert while operating the line and checking for problems and quality issues.|$|E

Some sandstone samples were tested by using the linear rock cutting machine in the school of mining engineering, University of New South Wales (UNSW), Australia. The curves characteristics for the weight percent of the broken debris with the mesh size distribution were obtained through the screening statistics. Furthermore, the fractal dimension of the specimen broken debris was derived through theoretical calculations and statistical analysis. The results showed that the rock cutting fragmentation is of significant fractal features under the mechanical shock loads. The broken debris fractal dimension of the structural integrity specimens is bigger, the range of the fractal dimension is smaller and the broken debris size distribution is more even than that of the poor structural integrity specimens. The fractal dimension is the ideal <b>test</b> <b>indicator</b> to assess and analysis the rock-breaking degree...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Quality {{measures}} {{should be}} subjected to a testing protocol before being used in practice using key attributes such as acceptability, feasibility and reliability, as well as identifying issues derived from actual implementation and unintended consequences. We describe the methodologies and results of an <b>indicator</b> <b>testing</b> protocol (ITP) using data from proposed quality indicators for the United Kingdom Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF). Methods The <b>indicator</b> <b>testing</b> protocol involved a multi-step and methodological process: 1) The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method, to test clarity and necessity, 2) data extraction from patients' medical records, to test technical feasibility and reliability, 3) diaries, to test workload, 4) cost-effectiveness modelling, and 5) semi-structured interviews, to test acceptability, implementation issues and unintended consequences. Testing was conducted {{in a sample of}} representative family practices in England. These methods were combined into an overall recommendation for each <b>tested</b> <b>indicator.</b> Results Using an <b>indicator</b> <b>testing</b> protocol as part of piloting was seen as a valuable way of <b>testing</b> potential <b>indicators</b> in 'real world' settings. Pilot 1 (October 2009 -March 2010) involved thirteen indicators across six clinical domains and twelve indicators passed the <b>indicator</b> <b>testing</b> protocol. However, the <b>indicator</b> <b>testing</b> protocol identified a number of implementation issues and unintended consequences that can be rectified or removed prior to national roll out. A palliative care indicator is used as an exemplar of the value of piloting using a multiple attribute <b>indicator</b> <b>testing</b> protocol - while technically feasible and reliable, it was unacceptable to practice staff and raised concerns about potentially causing actual patient harm. Conclusions This <b>indicator</b> <b>testing</b> protocol is one example of a protocol that may be useful in assessing potential quality indicators when adapted to specific country health care settings and may be of use to policy-makers and researchers worldwide to test the likely effect of implementing indicators prior to roll out. It builds on and codifies existing literature and other testing protocols to create a field testing methodology {{that can be used to}} produce country specific quality indicators for pay-for-performance or quality improvement schemes. </p...|$|R

40|$|Background}: Among {{the main}} data-analytical {{advances}} of recent decades are Latent Growth Models (LGM) and Multilevel Models (MLM) {{for the analysis}} of longitudinal data. {Objective}: We discuss the relative advantages and disadvantages of the two analytical methods and offer some practical guidelines concerning the choice between LGM and MLM based on (a) completeness and balance of the data, (b) theoretical functional form of change examined, (c) examination of the error structure, (d) theoretical relations among differential level effects and differential change effects, and (e) role of timeinvariant covariates. {Methods}: To discuss LGM and MLM, we provide illustrations from applications to the Berlin Aging Study (BASE) and the Swiss Interdisciplinary Longitudinal Study on the Oldest Old (SWILSO-O). {Results}: As predicted by two-component theories of lifespan cognition, performance on a vocabulary <b>test</b> (<b>indicator</b> of broad crystallized intelligence) did not decline over time, while scores on a digit letter <b>test</b> (<b>indicator</b> of broad fluid intelligence) decreased over 6 years. Differential level effects were obtained on both variables, while average and differential change effects were obtained only for the digit letter test. In a second set of analyses, we tested the error-free effect that a broad fluid intelligence indicator exerted on the latent yearly change in a broad crystallized intelligence indicator, and vice versa. In both data sets we obtained strong evidence for a more reliable effect of the fluid indicator on the change in the crystallized indicator. This evidence provided support for the dedifferentiation hypothesis of cognitive abilities in very old age. {Conclusions}: New insights into cognitive aging phenomena can be gained with proper applications of LGM and MLM. We posit that the choice between LGM and MLM and their specification rests on theoretical and empirical motives to be defined a priori...|$|E

40|$|Two natural {{variants}} of the lantibiotic nisin that {{are produced by}} Lactococcus lactis are known. They have a similar structure but differ in a single amino acid residue at position 27 : histidine in nisin A and asparagine in nisin Z. The nisin variants were purified to apparent homogeneity, and their biological activities were compared. Identical MICs of nisin A and nisin Z were found with all <b>tested</b> <b>indicator</b> strains of six different species of gram-positive bacteria. However, at concentrations above the MICs, with nisin Z the inhibition zones obtained in agar diffusion assays were invariably larger than those obtained with nisin A. This was observed with all <b>tested</b> <b>indicator</b> strains. These results suggest that nisin Z has better diffusion properties than nisin A in agar. The distribution of the nisin variants in various lactococcal strains was determined by amplification of the nisin structural gene by polymerase chain reaction followed by direct sequencing of the amplification product. In this way, it was established that the nisZ gene for nisin Z production is widely distributed, having been found in 14 of the 26 L. lactis strains analyzed. ...|$|R
