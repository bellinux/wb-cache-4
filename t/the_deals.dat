As part of the agreement, the other team owners in the American League agreed to help the Yankees restock their system with prospects. One of <b>the</b> <b>deals</b> Ruppert and Huston negotiated was their purchase of Pipp. After the purchase was completed, all owners, {{with the exception of}} Frank Navin, the owner of the Tigers, broke their word. On February 4, 1915, the Tigers sold Pipp and outfielder Hugh High to the Yankees, receiving $5,000 for each player ($ in current dollar terms).|$|E

5|$|Darryl Sutter {{engineered}} a seven player {{trade at}} the end of January that sent Dion Phaneuf and Fredrik Sjostrom to the Toronto Maple Leafs in exchange for four players led by Matt Stajan, Ian White and Niklas Hagman. The deal ended weeks of speculation about the Calgary defenceman's future amid reports that Phaneuf had requested a trade – a claim he had denied. One day later, the Flames sent Olli Jokinen and Brandon Prust to the New York Rangers in exchange for Ales Kotalik and Chris Higgins. <b>The</b> <b>deals</b> resulted in the change of over one third of the roster in the period of a day, moves that were seen as a sign of panic as the Flames hovered around the final playoff spot. While rumours circulated that Phaneuf was dealt because he was a divisive influence in the locker room, Jokinen later blamed the fans in Calgary for the defenceman's departure. Jokinen admitted that he was traded because he failed to produce in Calgary, while in Kotalik, the Flames received a player who was having a similarly disappointing season in New York.|$|E
5|$|During the Second World War, {{the three}} major South American navies found {{themselves}} unable to acquire major warships; they were only {{able to do so}} again after the conflict, when the United States and United Kingdom had many unnecessary or surplus warships. The war had proved the obsolete status of battleships, so the South American navies were seeking cruisers, destroyers, and submarines, yet they ran into political difficulties in acquiring anything larger than s and s. They were only able to acquire them when the Red Scare began to strongly affect American and international politics. One of <b>the</b> <b>deals</b> reached under the Mutual Defense Assistance Act (1949) sold six American light cruisers to Argentina, Brazil, and Chile in January 1951. While this bolstered the navies of important South American allies of the United States, which would be treaty-bound to assist the United States in any war, naval historian Robert Scheina argues that the American government also used the opportunity to significantly affect the traditional naval rivalry among the three countries. The warships sold unilaterally changed the naval outlook of all three nations, leading them to accept parity (as opposed to the Argentine pre-war stipulation that its fleet be equal to Brazil's and Chile's combined).|$|E
5|$|In 1975, the Jones Beach Parkway Authority {{raised the}} {{toll on the}} Southern State Parkway from to 25cents, while the Loop Parkway {{retained}} its 25cent toll. The change faced immediate criticism from the New York State Legislature, and the Democratic members tried to rescind the toll hike. The power Robert Moses still had in {{a deal with the}} State of New York made sure that only his authority could choose when to raise and rollback tolls. However, <b>the</b> <b>deals</b> never prohibited the state from buying out the bonds the authority had themselves and thus take over the roads maintained by the Jones Beach Parkway Authority. Governor Hugh Carey had yet to craft the $12billion state budget for 1978, and he proposed a deal to forgo the $24 million (1978USD) debt that the agency had accumulated and eliminate the toll on the Loop Parkway by taking over the roads.|$|E
50|$|The main {{opposition}} party Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) which {{laid the groundwork}} for <b>the</b> <b>deal</b> criticized <b>the</b> <b>deal</b> saying that <b>the</b> <b>deal</b> in its present form was unacceptable to the BJP and wanted <b>the</b> <b>deal</b> renegotiated. <b>The</b> BJP had asked the government not to accept <b>the</b> <b>deal</b> without a vote in the parliament. However, the government remained steadfast on its commitment to <b>the</b> <b>deal</b> and has refused to back down on the agreement. Veteran BJP leader Lal Krishna Advani, in a statement to the Indian Express newspaper, seemed to indicate willingness to support the government provided some legislative measures. However his party refused to follow that line and stuck to its earlier stand.|$|R

5|$|In 1993, the Breeders {{released}} {{their second}} album, Last Splash. At this time, the group’s line-up consisted of sisters Kim and Kelley Deal on guitar and vocals, Josephine Wiggs on bass and vocals, and Jim Macpherson on drums. Last Splash went {{silver in the}} United Kingdom, gold in Canada, and platinum in the United States. The group toured extensively and participated in Lollapalooza 1994. In November 1994, Kelley Deal was arrested on drug-related charges, and in 1995, Wiggs decided to pursue other musical projects. Macpherson continued playing with Kim Deal in her side-project group, the Amps, {{and then in the}} 1996 incarnation of the Breeders, but quit the band in 1997. The Breeders' line-ups for their albums Title TK (2002) and Mountain Battles (2008) included the Deal sisters, Mando Lopez, and Jose Medeles. In 2013, Wiggs and Macpherson rejoined <b>the</b> <b>Deals</b> to tour the 20th anniversary of Last Splash—the LSXX Tour.|$|E
5|$|In October 1999, Chakrapong founded Royal Phnom Penh Airways. Chakrapong raised US$2 {{million from}} {{personal}} savings and bank loans, {{which he used}} to acquire one 52-seater Antonov-24 and another 100-seater Yakovlev Yak-42 airplanes. The airlines flew domestic routes within {{the first year of}} operations and most of its customers were Chinese, Taiwanese, and Japanese tourists. By May 2001, Royal Phnom Penh Airways secured three authorizations to fly between Phnom PenhBangkok, Phnom PenhHo Chi Minh City as well as Ho Chi Minh CitySiem Reap. The airlines attempted to secure two additional routes from the Cambodian government—Bangkok-Siem Reap in August 2001 and Siem Reap-Bangkok in August 2002—but lost both bids to other airlines. Chakrapong accused the government political bias in awarding <b>the</b> <b>deals</b> due to his political affiliations. In October 2003, the director of Battambang Airport, Prum Chantha, reported that Royal Phnom Penh Airways had accumulated $1million in unpaid taxes. Chakrapong suspended domestic flights between Phnom Penh and Battambang as foreign tourists opted for land transport options to provincial capitals which were cheaper than air transport. Royal Phnom Penh Airways had already become bankrupt by March 2006 when the government presented Chakrapong a bill of $1.36 million in unpaid taxes, navigation, and landing fees. When Chakrapong failed to repay the taxes to the government, Hun Sen issued a lawsuit in March 2007 against him.|$|E

5000|$|Depending on {{regional}} or house rules, a player may steal <b>the</b> <b>deal</b> from <b>the</b> opposing team.

If the opponent team notices, they must say something which indicates this, and <b>the</b> <b>deal</b> is returned to the player who would normally <b>deal</b> next in <b>the</b> rotation. Normally there is no penalty for attempting to steal <b>the</b> <b>deal,</b> successful or not, and the next hand is dealt by the player to left of the player who stole <b>the</b> <b>deal.</b> In some variations especially in Canada any player may steal <b>the</b> <b>deal</b> and only if the player who has had <b>the</b> <b>deal</b> stolen from them calls this ruse are the cards returned to them, usually <b>the</b> <b>deal</b> is considered [...] "stolen" [...] and cannot be returned once the card from the [...] "kitty" [...] has been flipped face up.
