5|$|Like most of {{this part}} of Borneo, this area was once {{under the control of the}} Bruneian Empire in the 15th century before being ceded to the Sultanate of Sulu between the 17th and 18th centuries as a gift for helping the Bruneian forces during a civil war in Brunei. The name Tawao was used on {{nautical}} charts by 1857, and there is evidence of a settlement by 1879. The East India Company had established a trading post in Borneo, though there was no significant activity by the Dutch on the east coast. In 1846, Netherlands signed a treaty with <b>the</b> <b>Sultan</b> of Bulungan, where the latter assured the Dutch control of the area. When the Dutch began to operate in 1867, <b>the</b> <b>Sultan</b> married his son to the daughter of <b>the</b> <b>Sultan</b> of Tarakan. Around this time, the Dutch sphere of influence reached Tawao. They controlled the area north of Tawao, overlapping an area controlled by <b>the</b> <b>Sultan</b> of Sulu.|$|E

The building was started in 1684 Javanese year (1758 AD). After finding out how large the complex was, Raden Rangga Prawirasentika realized that the cost would have been greater than the taxes. He resigned from the project and was replaced by Prince Natakusuma who continued the project to completion.|$|E

After the French army defeated the Moroccan cavalry at the Battle of Isly on 14 August 1844, Sultan Abd al-Rahman asked for peace with France, leading to the signing of the Treaty of Tangier on 10 September 1844. Morocco's defeat caused a revolt in Rabat; in Salé, the city's nobility, known as the Sharif, sent a letter to <b>the</b> <b>Sultan</b> complaining about the lack of weapons and ammunition in the city.|$|E

5|$|At {{a session}} of the Great Council on 7 July, Andronikos' offer was accepted. The council sent notices to the Venetian colonies in the Aegean Sea—Negroponte, Nauplia, Tinos and Mykonos, and the vassal Duke of Naxos—to prepare ships to take {{possession}} of the city, while the Republic's bailo at Constantinople was instructed to secure the assent of Emperor Manuel. A week later Santo Venier and Niccolo Giorgio were named provveditori (plenipotentiary envoys) and tasked with going to Greece and, if the Despot Andronikos were still willing, take over the city and arrange for its defence by hiring mercenaries. After that, Giorgio was to go before <b>the</b> <b>Sultan,</b> inform him of Venice's acquisition {{of the city and}} justify it as an expedient to prevent the city from being captured by other Christians, who might have been hostile to <b>the</b> <b>Sultan.</b> The envoys were also to arrange for peace both between <b>the</b> <b>Sultan</b> and the Republic, as well as between <b>the</b> <b>Sultan</b> and Emperor Manuel. Emperor Manuel evidently gave his assent to the proposal, for on 14 September 1423 six Venetian galleys, accompanied by one Byzantine galley, entered the harbour of Thessalonica. The Venetians were greeted by a jubilant population as saviours. For the Thessalonians, Venetian rule meant not only security from the Turks—some 5,000 Ottoman troops were besieging the city—but also a secure flow of supplies.|$|E
