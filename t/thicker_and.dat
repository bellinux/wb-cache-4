5|$|Monotype has {{released}} two separate digitisations named Bembo {{and more recently}} Bembo Book, {{as well as the}} more slender caps-only display font Bembo Titling and the alternate italic design Fairbank. Bembo Book is considered to be superior by being <b>thicker</b> <b>and</b> more suitable for body text, as well as for offering the alternate shorter R for better-spaced body text.|$|E
5|$|During childhood, Goebbels {{suffered}} from ill health, {{which included a}} long bout of inflammation of the lungs. He had a deformed right foot that turned inwards, due to a congenital deformity. It was <b>thicker</b> <b>and</b> shorter than his left foot. He underwent a failed operation to correct it just prior to starting grammar school. Goebbels wore a metal brace and special shoe because of his shortened leg, and walked with a limp. He was rejected for military service in World War I due to his deformity.|$|E
5|$|Each of {{the wings}} {{consists}} of a thin membrane supported by a system of veins. The membrane is formed by two layers of integument closely apposed, while the veins are formed where the two layers remain separate; sometimes the lower cuticle is <b>thicker</b> <b>and</b> more heavily sclerotized under a vein. Within each of the major veins there is a nerve and a trachea, and, since the cavities of the veins are connected with the hemocoel, hemolymph can flow into the wings.|$|E

5|$|Over the centuries, {{the tree}} grows <b>thicker</b> <b>and</b> taller as {{successive}} rings develop around its trunk and new buds grow on the branches. The tree {{becomes part of}} an old growth forest with a shaded and damp understory of broadleaf trees, shrubs, and ferns. In the canopy, a mat of dead needles and lichen accumulate on the wide upper branches. Exposed to light, air, and rain, the needles decompose and the mat becomes colonized by insects, fungus, and new plants.|$|E
5|$|In 1836, native Vermonter John Deere set {{out from}} Rutland, Vermont to Grand Detour, Illinois, founded by his friend and fellow Vermont native Leonard Andrus. The town lacked a local blacksmith, Deere's trade, and within two days Deere had a forge and new {{business}} established. In Vermont, Deere produced plows made from cast-iron and when he first arrived in Illinois he produced the same plows. Soil conditions in Illinois differ from those in Vermont. In Vermont the soil is sandy and falls easily away from the plow blade but in Illinois the soil is <b>thicker</b> <b>and</b> wetter; it stuck to the plow {{and had to be}} scraped off by the farmer as he plowed.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} of a juvenile specimen with a nearly complete hindlimb shows that the legs were relatively longer in juveniles, and the lower segments of the leg (shin and foot) were relatively longer than the thigh. These differences suggest that younger Allosaurus were faster and had different hunting strategies than adults, perhaps chasing small prey as juveniles, then becoming ambush hunters of large prey upon adulthood. The thigh bone became <b>thicker</b> <b>and</b> wider during growth, and the cross-section less circular, as muscle attachments shifted, muscles became shorter, {{and the growth of}} the leg slowed. These changes imply that juvenile legs has less predictable stresses compared with adults, which would have moved with more regular forward progression. Conversely, the skull bones appear to have generally grown isometrically, increasing in size without changing in proportion.|$|E
50|$|Typical {{workpiece}} sizes {{range from}} 0.25 in to 0.75 in <b>thick</b> <b>and</b> 0.5 in to 10 in long. It {{is possible to}} compact workpieces that are between 0.0625 in <b>and</b> 5 in <b>thick</b> <b>and</b> 0.0625 in to 40 in long.|$|R
5000|$|It {{grows to}} 10-20 cm tall. The leaves are oblong to rhombic, <b>thick,</b> <b>and</b> {{remotely}} toothed. The stem is single, stout <b>and</b> <b>thick,</b> <b>and</b> densely glandular. The flowers are produced in dense clusters, small and inconspicuous, with greenish to purplish petals.|$|R
40|$|In mining engineering, the <b>thick</b> <b>and</b> hard roof {{threatens the}} safe production. Based on Reissner plate theory and {{combined}} with weighted residual method, with four edges clamped as the boundary conditions, this paper deduces the theoretical formula {{of the first}} breaking span of <b>thick</b> <b>and</b> hard roof. Based on Vlasov plate theory, with four edges simply supported as the boundary conditions, this paper deduces the theoretical formula of the periodic breaking span of <b>thick</b> <b>and</b> hard roof. The two formulas are used to verify the breaking span of <b>thick</b> <b>and</b> hard roof of Tashan Coal Mine, proving that its accuracy is {{higher than that of}} traditional beam theory. This paper studies the distribution characteristics of strain energy density in front of the coal seam during the mining process by numerical simulation, which is compared with the results of field microseismic experiments. It is found that the strain energy density of the coal seam has a good correlation with the probability of microseismic events. This paper provides theoretical support for more precise calculation of breaking span of the <b>thick</b> <b>and</b> hard roof and technical support for the practical stability analysis of the surrounding rock under the <b>thick</b> <b>and</b> hard roof...|$|R
5|$|Elephants {{usually have}} 26 teeth: the incisors, {{known as the}} tusks, 12 {{deciduous}} premolars, and 12 molars. Unlike most mammals, which grow baby teeth and then replace them with a single permanent set of adult teeth, elephants are polyphyodonts that have cycles of tooth rotation throughout their lives. The chewing teeth are replaced six times in a typical elephant's lifetime. Teeth are not replaced by new ones emerging from the jaws vertically as in most mammals. Instead, new teeth grow in {{at the back of}} the mouth and move forward to push out the old ones. The first chewing tooth on each side of the jaw falls out when the elephant is two to three years old. The second set of chewing teeth falls out when the elephant is four to six years old. The third set is lost at 9–15 years of age, and set four lasts until 18–28 years of age. The fifth set of teeth lasts until the elephant is in its early 40s. The sixth (and usually final) set must last the elephant the rest of its life. Elephant teeth have loop-shaped dental ridges, which are <b>thicker</b> <b>and</b> more diamond-shaped in African elephants.|$|E
5|$|The {{members of}} Clamp had some {{difficulty}} adjusting from their typical style after deciding to publish with Weekly Shōnen Magazine. Because their typical thinner lines {{did not give}} the desired impact, Ohkawa expressed the group's desire to make their lines <b>thicker,</b> <b>and</b> to use simpler layouts similar to the other stories already present in Shōnen Magazine. She stated that they used their original artistic style to attract initial readers and then slowly transitioned to a new style. Sometime around when the story arc focused on the Country of Ōto took place, their art style had gradually been changing again; at this point they were thinking of returning to their original style. They were still adjusting to a weekly schedule; many of their previous works were on a monthly schedule. Sugawara expressed concerns about the strain on the artists of concurrently doing a weekly issue of Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle linked with xxxHolic, {{but in the end}} he whole-heartedly approved. In accordance with Ohkawa's desire for each to have a well-organized story, Clamp avoids putting references between the two stories too frequently. The main idea was connecting these two series was to have protagonists from two different manga with different personalities and designs. However, during the ending they would be stated to share the same existence, and had to go on different paths. As Tsubasa is connected with xxxHolic, the characters' designs are also meant to be similar; Like xxxHolic, the artwork is sometimes influenced by Ukiyo-e art style which leads to the characters have longer limbs. When asked if another series influenced Tsubasa in the concept of parallel worlds, Ohkawa replied that she was not a fan of sci-fi series and pointed that all worlds shown in the series were other works from Tsubasa. At the same time, she wanted to segregate Tsubasa from previous works. She also explained that while some characters are the same, their traits and personalities were modified due to different backstories.|$|E

25|$|This {{pattern is}} {{gradually}} lost with growth, as the shell becomes <b>thicker</b> <b>and</b> more elongate. At 10 to 15mm, this ornate colouration pattern begins to fade, with maroon and cream fields apparently blending {{to give a}} brown background. Blue and orange dots however persist on the ridges.|$|E

25|$|Fabric-D {{contained}} {{designs of}} slanted lines or semicircles in some, while most pots were plain. But Fabric-C pottery was <b>thicker</b> <b>and</b> stronger. Fabric-C was distinguished by violet tinge and fine polish, with designs in black; {{it is the}} best proto-Harappan pottery in finishing. Fabric-E was light colored and Fabric-F was grey.|$|E
25|$|Temperature and viscosity. As an {{ascending}} magma {{rises and}} cools, it becomes <b>thicker</b> <b>and</b> more viscous. This then restricts the magma from rising further because more energy {{is required to}} push it upwards. Conversely, thicker magma is also more efficient at forcing apart the wall rocks, creating volume which the magma may fill.|$|E
25|$|In Africa, {{there is}} a {{distinct}} difference in the tools made before and after 600,000 {{years ago with the}} older group being <b>thicker</b> <b>and</b> less symmetric and the younger being more extensively trimmed. This may be connected with the appearance of Homo heidelbergensis in the archaeological record at this time who may have contributed this more sophisticated approach.|$|E

25|$|Although mostly herbivorous, the jaw {{structure}} of Asian black bears {{is not as}} specialised for plant eating as that of pandas: Asian black bears have much narrower zygomatic arches, and the weight ratio of the two pterygoid muscles is also much smaller in Asian black bears. The lateral slips of the temporal muscles are <b>thicker</b> <b>and</b> stronger in black bears.|$|E
25|$|Just {{below the}} coronet, {{the walls are}} covered for about an inch by a cornified, opaque 'periople' material. In the palmar/plantar part of the hoof, the periople is <b>thicker</b> <b>and</b> more rubbery over the heels, and it merges with frog material. Not all horses have {{the same amount of}} periople. Dry feet tend to lack this substance, which can be {{substituted}} with a hoof dressing.|$|E
