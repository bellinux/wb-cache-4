5|$|On 24 March the French army retreated through Brussels. Dumouriez {{began calling}} in his {{detachments}} such as Harville's corps. At this point Dumouriez opened {{negotiations with the}} Austrians. He offered to evacuate Belgium if his armies were allowed an unmolested retreat. The terms were accepted and the French armies withdrew to camps behind the border. <b>The</b> <b>Army</b> <b>of</b> Holland was allowed to march through enemy lines and took position near Lille. <b>The</b> <b>Army</b> <b>of</b> the Ardennes was posted at Maulde, <b>the</b> <b>Army</b> <b>of</b> the North at Bruille-Saint-Amand, and <b>the</b> <b>Army</b> <b>of</b> Belgium at Condé-sur-l'Escaut and Valenciennes.

The army had three divisions plus an advance guard, a reserve, and an artillery park. The artillery park was {{under the command of}} Jean Ambroise Baston de Lariboisière and consisted of 33 cannons and 19 howitzers operated by 1,329 non-commissioned officers and cannoneers as well as 60 officers. There were approximately 25,000 members of the Army, the role of which was to invade southwestern Germany, precipitating the War of the Second Coalition.|$|E
5|$|The Imperial Roman {{army of the}} Principate (30 BC – 284 AD) {{underwent}} a significant transformation {{as a result of}} the chaotic 3rd century.

5|$|According to plan, Kléber {{made the}} first move, {{advancing}} south from Düsseldorf against Württemberg's wing of <b>the</b> <b>Army</b> <b>of</b> the Lower Rhine. On 1 June 1796, a division of Kléber's troops led by François Joseph Lefebvre seized a bridge over the Sieg from Michael von Kienmayer's Austrians at Siegburg. Meanwhile, a second French division under Claude-Sylvestre Colaud menaced the Austrian left flank. Württemberg retreated south to Uckerath but then fell back farther to a well-fortified position at Altenkirchen. On 4 June, Kléber defeated Württemberg in the Battle of Altenkirchen, capturing 1,500 Austrian soldiers, 12 artillery pieces and four colors. Archduke Charles withdrew the Austrian forces from the Rhine's west bank and gave <b>the</b> <b>Army</b> <b>of</b> the Upper Rhine the principle responsibility to defend Mainz. After this setback, Charles replaced Württemberg with Wilhelm von Wartensleben, much to Württemberg's annoyance: the Duke returned to Vienna and offered the Aulic Council his persistent criticism of Charles' decisions and advise on how they could run the war better from the capital. Jourdan's main body crossed the Rhine on 10 June at Neuwied to join Kléber and <b>the</b> <b>Army</b> <b>of</b> Sambre and Meuse advanced to the Lahn River.|$|E
5|$|After his recovery, d'Hautpoul {{was given}} {{command of the}} heavy cavalry of <b>the</b> <b>Army</b> <b>of</b> Sambre-et-Meuse under General Paul Grenier.

After the French loss at the Battle of Ostrach, his Cavalry reserve protected the French retreat from Pfullendorf. A few days later, after failing to lead a timely charge at the Battle of Stockach, he was suspended on orders of the Army commander, Jean-Baptiste Jourdan, who blamed d'Hautpoul for the defeat. Acquitted by a court-martial in Strasbourg, d'Hautpoul resumed his duties at the end of July 1799, having missed the critical actions at the First Battle of Zurich.|$|E

5|$|Although Artigas was {{defeated}} by the Luso-Brazilian armies, his allies Estanislao López and Francisco Ramírez continued hostilities against Buenos Aires for its inactivity against the invasion. Pueyrredón called <b>the</b> <b>Army</b> <b>of</b> the Andes and <b>the</b> <b>Army</b> <b>of</b> the North (led by Belgrano) to aid Buenos Aires in the conflict. Guido noted to San Martín that if both armies did that, the north of Argentina and Chile would be easily reconquered by the royalists. San Martín also knew {{that most of the}} soldiers of <b>the</b> <b>Army</b> <b>of</b> the Andes would not be willing to aid Buenos Aires in the civil war, as most were from other provinces or from Chile. San Martín had doubts as well about the projected arrival of a large military expedition from Spain, as the absolutist restoration of Ferdinand VII had met severe resistance in Spain. San Martín finally kept the Army in Chile when Belgrano's lieutenant Viamonte signed an armistice with López; he thought that the conflict had ended.|$|E
5|$|Around 1 p.m., from 150 to 170 Confederate guns {{began an}} {{artillery}} bombardment {{that was probably}} the largest of the war. In order to save valuable ammunition for the infantry attack that they knew would follow, <b>the</b> <b>Army</b> <b>of</b> the Potomac's artillery, under the command of Brig. Gen.

After waiting about 15 minutes, about 80 U.S. cannons added to the din. <b>The</b> <b>Army</b> <b>of</b> Northern Virginia was critically low on artillery ammunition, and the cannonade did not significantly affect the Union position.|$|E

The left wing of the 80,000-man Army of the Upper Rhine guarded the Rhine River from Mannheim to Switzerland under Anton Sztáray, Michael von Fröhlich and Louis Joseph, Prince of Condé while its right wing was on the west bank around Kaiserslautern. <b>The</b> <b>Army</b> <b>of</b> the Lower Rhine had a 20,000-strong right wing under Duke Ferdinand Frederick Augustus of Württemberg on the east bank observing the French bridgehead at Düsseldorf. The archduke's remaining 70,000 troops lay on the west bank along the Nahe River with powerful garrisons in Mainz and Ehrenbreitstein Fortress.|$|E

Simon Petlyura became commander of the Ukrainian Nationalist forces and these forces, as did the anti-Bolshevik White Russian troops, took to systematically massacring Jews. Between 1918 and 1921, when the Bolsheviks assumed control of the Ukraine, over 50,000 Jews were killed, a further 100,000 were permanently maimed or died of wounds and 200,000 Jewish children became orphans.Israel Zangwill wrote:It is as Bolsheviks that the Jews of South Russia have been massacred by <b>the</b> <b>armies</b> <b>of</b> Petlyura, though <b>the</b> <b>armies</b> <b>of</b> Sokolow have massacred them as partisans <b>of</b> Petlyura, <b>the</b> <b>armies</b> <b>of</b> Makhno as bourgeois capitalists, <b>the</b> <b>armies</b> <b>of</b> Grigoriev as Communists, and <b>the</b> <b>armies</b> <b>of</b> Denikin at once as Bolsheviks, capitalists and Ukrainian nationalists.|$|R
