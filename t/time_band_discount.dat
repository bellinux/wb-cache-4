40|$|Abstract: Timed {{specifications}} {{are often}} formalised at an absolute level of pre-cision, {{which does not}} reflect the real world that the specifications model, i. e., in the real world, inputs cannot be sampled with absolute precision and physical hard-ware cannot react instantaneously. As a result the developed specifications can often become unimplementable. In this paper, we consider the <b>time</b> <b>bands</b> model which allows time to be structured into several layers of abstraction and relationships be-tween bands to be formalised. This allows the timed specifications developed under idealised assumptions to be approximated using the <b>time</b> <b>band</b> in which the variables are sampled. We implement the approximated specifications using teleo-reactive programs embedded with <b>time</b> <b>bands...</b>|$|R
