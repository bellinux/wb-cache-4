5|$|Doppler {{redshift}} vs cosmological red-shift: Astronomersoften {{refer to}} <b>the</b> <b>cosmological</b> red-shift {{as a normal}} Doppler shift,which is a misconception. Although similar, <b>the</b> <b>cosmological</b> red-shift is not identical to the Doppler redshift. The Doppler redshift is based on special relativity, which does not consider the expansion of space. On the contrary, <b>the</b> <b>cosmological</b> red-shift is based on general relativity, in which the expansion of space is considered. Although they may appear identical for nearby galaxies, it may cause confusion if the behavior of distant galaxies is understood through the Doppler redshift.|$|E
5|$|If the {{large-scale}} universe appears isotropic as viewed from Earth, <b>the</b> <b>cosmological</b> principle {{can be derived}} from the simpler Copernican principle, which states that there is no preferred (or special) observer or vantage point.

40|$|The {{dependence}} of the luminosity distance on the redshift has a key importance in the cosmology. This dependence can well be given by standard functions for <b>the</b> zero <b>cosmological</b> constant. <b>The</b> {{purpose of this article}} is to present such a relation also for <b>the</b> non-zero <b>cosmological</b> constant, if <b>the</b> universe is spatially flat. A definite integral is used. The integration ends in the elliptic integral of the first kind.

5|$|Although the {{properties}} of gravity at short distances should be somewhat independent {{of the value of}} <b>the</b> <b>cosmological</b> constant, it is desirable to have a version of the AdS/CFT correspondence for positive cosmological constant. In 2001, Andrew Strominger introduced a version of the duality called the dS/CFT correspondence. This duality involves a model of spacetime called de Sitter space with a positive cosmological constant. Such a duality is interesting {{from the point of view}} of cosmology since many cosmologists believe that the very early universe was close to being de Sitter space. Our universe may also resemble de Sitter space in the distant future.|$|E
5|$|An HDF {{counterpart}} {{in the southern}} celestial hemisphere was created in 1998: the HDF-South. Created using a similar observing strategy, the HDF-S was very similar in appearance to the original HDF. This supports <b>the</b> <b>cosmological</b> principle that at its largest scale the Universe is homogeneous. The HDF-S survey used the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) and the Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer (NICMOS) instruments installed on the HST in 1997; the Hubble Deep Field has since been re-observed several times using WFPC2, {{as well as by}} the NICMOS and STIS instruments. Several supernova events were detected by comparing the first and second epoch observations of the HDF-N.|$|E
5|$|As the Universe expands, {{more distant}} objects recede from the Earth faster, {{in what is}} called the Hubble Flow. The light from very distant galaxies is {{significantly}} affected by <b>the</b> <b>cosmological</b> redshift. While quasars with high redshifts were known, very few galaxies with redshifts greater than one were known before the HDF images were produced. The HDF, however, contained many galaxies with redshifts as high as six, corresponding to distances of about 12 billion light-years. Due to redshift the most distant objects in the HDF (Lyman-break galaxies) are not actually visible in the Hubble images; they can only be detected in images of the HDF taken at longer wavelengths by ground-based telescopes.|$|E

5|$|In 1917, Einstein {{applied the}} {{general theory of}} {{relativity}} to the structure of the universe as a whole. He discovered that the general field equations predicted a universe that was dynamic, either contracting or expanding. As observational evidence for a dynamic universe was not known at the time, Einstein introduced a new term, <b>the</b> <b>cosmological</b> constant, to the field equations, in order to allow the theory to predict a static universe. The modified field equations predicted a static universe of closed curvature, in accordance with Einstein's understanding of Mach's principle in these years. This model became known as the Einstein World or Einstein's static universe.|$|E
5|$|In general, {{diffusion}} damping produces {{its effects}} independent of <b>the</b> <b>cosmological</b> model being studied, thereby masking {{the effects of}} other, model-dependent phenomena. This means that without an accurate model of diffusion damping, scientists cannot judge {{the relative merits of}} cosmological models, whose theoretical predictions cannot be compared with observational data, this data being obscured by damping effects. For example, the peaks in the power spectrum due to acoustic oscillations are decreased in amplitude by diffusion damping. This deamplification of the power spectrum hides features of the curve, features that would otherwise be more visible.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} part of the twentieth century, Slipher, Hubble and others made the first {{measurements}} of the redshifts and blueshifts of galaxies beyond the Milky Way. They initially interpreted these redshifts and blueshifts as due to random motions, but later Hubble discovered a rough correlation between the increasing redshifts and the increasing distance of galaxies. Theorists almost immediately realized that these observations could be explained by a mechanism for producing redshifts seen in certain cosmological solutions to Einstein's equations of general relativity. Hubble's law of the correlation between redshifts and distances is required by all such models that have a metric expansion of space. As a result, the wavelength of photons propagating through the expanding space is stretched, creating <b>the</b> <b>cosmological</b> redshift.|$|E
5|$|The {{observable}} Universe is isotropic on scales significantly {{larger than}} superclusters, {{meaning that the}} statistical properties of the Universe are the same in all directions as observed from Earth. The Universe is bathed in highly isotropic microwave radiation that corresponds to a thermal equilibrium blackbody spectrum of roughly 2.72548 kelvin. The hypothesis that the large-scale Universe is homogeneous and isotropic is known as <b>the</b> <b>cosmological</b> principle.

5|$|Throughout the universe, {{hydrogen}} is mostly {{found in the}} atomic and plasma states, with properties quite {{different from those of}} molecular hydrogen. As a plasma, hydrogen's electron and proton are not bound together, resulting in very high electrical conductivity and high emissivity (producing the light from the Sun and other stars). The charged particles are highly influenced by magnetic and electric fields. For example, in the solar wind they interact with the Earth's magnetosphere giving rise to Birkeland currents and the aurora. Hydrogen is found in the neutral atomic state in the interstellar medium. The large amount of neutral hydrogen found in the damped Lyman-alpha systems is thought to dominate <b>the</b> <b>cosmological</b> baryonic density of the Universe up to redshift z=4.|$|E
