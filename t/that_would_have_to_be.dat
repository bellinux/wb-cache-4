5|$|Macdonald also {{wished to}} secure the Colony of British Columbia. There was {{interest}} in the United States in bringing about the colony's annexation, and Macdonald wished to ensure his new nation had a Pacific outlet. The colony had an extremely large debt <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> assumed should it join Confederation. Negotiations were conducted in 1870, principally during Macdonald's illness and recuperation, with Cartier leading the Canadian delegation. Cartier offered British Columbia a railroad linking it to the eastern provinces within 10 years. The British Columbians, who privately had been prepared to accept far less generous terms, quickly agreed and joined Confederation in 1871. The Canadian Parliament ratified the terms after a debate over the high cost that cabinet member Alexander Morris described as the worst fight the Conservatives had had since Confederation.|$|E
5|$|The 22.5-foot (6.85m) James Caird was {{launched}} on 24 April 1916. The {{success of the}} voyage depended on the pin-point accuracy of Worsley's navigation, using observations <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> made in the most unfavourable of conditions. The prevailing wind was helpfully north-west, but the heavy sea conditions quickly soaked everything in icy water. Soon ice settled thickly on the boat, making her ride sluggishly. On 5 May a north-westerly gale almost caused the boat's destruction as it faced what Shackleton described as the largest waves {{he had seen in}} twenty-six years at sea. On 8 May South Georgia was sighted, after a 14-day battle with the elements that had driven the boat party to their physical limits. Two days later, after a prolonged struggle with heavy seas and hurricane-force winds to the south of the island, the party struggled ashore at King Haakon Bay.|$|E
5|$|To {{overcome}} elevator issues, {{the tower}} will use its {{large number of}} efficient elevators {{as well as its}} three sky lobbies, which allows transfers to be made between elevators serving a specific area with no elevator being overburdened. Much was learned from Burj Khalifa that helped with the design of Jeddah Tower not only structurally, but in methods for designing practical mechanical, electrical, and plumbing (MEP) systems, as well as adhering to local regulations and international building codes. Despite all the physical challenges, Adrian Smith states that practicality is still the greater challenge over structural durability, even in such super-tall designs, and that as with all buildings, Jeddah Tower's form was primarily derived respective of what the building's uses would be, then in accordance with the structural factors <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> considered to deliver it.|$|E

5|$|Little {{was known}} about {{building}} reactors in 1943. A group was created in Bacher's P Division, the P-7 (Water Boiler) Group, {{under the leadership of}} Donald Kerst, that included Charles P. Baker, Gerhart Friedlander, Lindsay Helmholtz, Marshall Holloway and Raemer Schreiber. Robert F. Christy from the T-1 Group provided support with the theoretical calculations, in particular, a calculation of the critical mass. He calculated that 600 grams of uranium-235 would form a critical mass in a tamper of infinite size. Initially it was planned to operate the Water Boiler at 10kW, but Fermi and Samuel K. Allison visited in September 1943, and went over the proposed design. They pointed out the danger of decomposition of the uranium salt, and recommended heavier shielding. It was also noted that radioactive fission products would be created <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> chemically removed. As a consequence, it was decided that the Water Boiler would only run at 1kW until more operating experience had been accumulated, and features needed for high power operation were shelved for the time being.|$|E

25|$|One design {{weakness}} of the two-fluid design is the necessity for a barrier wall between the core and the blanket region, a wall <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> replaced periodically because of fast neutron damage. Graphite was the material chosen by ORNL because of its low neutron absorption, compatibility with the molten salts, high temperature resistance, and sufficient strength and integrity to separate the fuel and blanket salts. The effect of neutron radiation on graphite is to slowly shrink and then swell the graphite to cause an increase in porosity and a deterioration in physical properties. Graphite pipes would change length, and may crack and leak. ORNL chose not to pursue the two-fluid design, and no examples of the two-fluid reactor were ever constructed.|$|E

25|$|In a {{study by}} Fischer and Born, 2009, {{previous}} knowledge of monetary reward and post-training sleep are proven to be significant predictors of overall finger sequence tapping performance. Subjects were presented with two different finger sequence tasks <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> replicated at a later time. The subjects were told {{that there would be}} a reward offered for improvement upon a specific finger tapping sequence task. A control group was not given any knowledge of a reward. The subjects were separated further by allowing a sleep period between initial training and final testing for one group while another group faced a wake retention interval. It was concluded that the group that received both information about reward as well as being able to sleep displayed the highest increase in performance on both finger tapping sequences. Knowledge of reward without sleep and sleep without knowledge of reward were both significant contributors to improved performance. In all cases sleep was determined to have an advantageous effect on overall performance when compared to groups that underwent a twelve-hour wake retention period.|$|E
25|$|Railroad {{locomotive}} {{engines in}} the United States have nearly always {{been built in}} and for United States railroads with very few imports, except in {{the earliest days of}} steam engines. This is due to the basic differences of markets in the United States which initially had many small markets located large distances apart, in contrast to Europe's higher density of markets. Locomotives that were cheap and rugged and could go large distances over cheaply built and maintained tracks were required. Once the manufacture of engines was established on a wide scale there was very little advantage to buying an engine from overseas <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> customised to fit the local requirements and track conditions. Improvements in engine design of both European and US origin were incorporated by manufacturers when they could be justified in a generally very conservative and slow-changing market. With the notable exception of the USRA standard locomotives built during World War I, in the United States, steam locomotive manufacture was always semi-customised. Railroads ordered locomotives tailored to their specific requirements, though some basic design features were always present. Railroads developed some specific characteristics; for example, the Pennsylvania Railroad and the Great Northern Railway had a preference for the Belpaire firebox. In the United States, large-scale manufacturers constructed locomotives for nearly all rail companies, although nearly all major railroads had shops capable of heavy repairs and some railroads (for example, the Norfolk and Western Railway and the Pennsylvania Railroad, which had two erecting shops) constructed locomotives entirely in their own shops. Companies manufacturing locomotives in the US included Baldwin Locomotive Works, American Locomotive Company (Alco), and Lima Locomotive Works. Altogether, between 1830 and 1950, over 160,000 steam locomotives were built in the United States, with Baldwin alone accounting for a majority, nearly 70,000.|$|E

500|$|Throughout society, {{circumcision}} {{is often}} considered for {{reasons other than}} medical need. Public health advocates of circumcision consider it to have a net benefit, and therefore feel that increasing the circumcision rate is an ethical imperative.

While studies show there is a modest epidemiological benefit to circumcision, critics argue that the number of circumcisions <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> performed would yield an overall negative public health outcome due to the resulting number of complications or other negative effects (such as pain). Pinto (2012) writes [...] "sober proponents and detractors of circumcision agree that there is no overwhelming medical evidence to support either side." [...] This type of cost-benefit analysis is highly dependent on the kinds and frequencies of health problems in the population under discussion and how circumcision affects those health problems.|$|E
