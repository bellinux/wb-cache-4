5|$|In What Starts Wars: Intentional Delusions Stratton {{presented}} nations, themselves {{collections of}} people, as triggering war from several delusions. Three of those delusions held by citizens were {{that their own}} country was a paragon of peace, that its arms were only to defend the land, and that when it fought, it fought only for what was right. Blaming the enemy rounded out this list justifying war. Stratton believed and stated people could be freed of these delusions {{and that there was}} no will to war integral to human nature. He saw both the need for and the ways to eliminate war in individuals and in their ways, and not in abstract or innate traits. Florence Finch Kelly, reviewing the book for the New York Times, saw Stratton's placing of both the blame and the responsibility on persons, of identifying the roots of war in the psyches of <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> his readers, as an action likely to discomfit those readers.|$|E
