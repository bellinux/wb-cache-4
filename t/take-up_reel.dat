25|$|A common {{application}} of a torque motor would be the supply- and <b>take-up</b> <b>reel</b> motors in a tape drive. In this application, driven from a low voltage, the characteristics of these motors allow a relatively constant light tension {{to be applied to}} the tape whether or not the capstan is feeding tape past the tape heads. Driven from a higher voltage, (and so delivering a higher torque), the torque motors can also achieve fast-forward and rewind operation without requiring any additional mechanics such as gears or clutches. In the computer gaming world, torque motors are used in force feedback steering wheels.|$|E

50|$|The EIAJ {{format is}} a {{standard}} half-inch format used by various manufacturers. EIAJ-1 is an open-reel format. EIAJ-2 uses a cartridge that contains a supply reel, but not the <b>take-up</b> <b>reel.</b> Since the <b>take-up</b> <b>reel</b> {{is part of the}} recorder, the tape has to be fully rewound before removing the cartridge, which is a relatively slow procedure.|$|E

50|$|The tape {{inside an}} LTO {{cartridge}} is wound around a single reel. The {{end of the}} tape {{is attached to a}} perpendicular leader pin that is used by an LTO drive to reliably grasp the end of the tape and mount it in a <b>take-up</b> <b>reel</b> inside the drive. Older single-reel tape technologies, such as 9 track tape and DLT, used different means to load tape onto a <b>take-up</b> <b>reel.</b>|$|E
50|$|The paper rolls were 120 ft long. A {{metal bar}} above the <b>take-up</b> <b>reel</b> allowed a {{finished}} plot {{to be torn}} off and removed. The drum would then be advanced using the manual controls and the fresh paper end taped to the <b>take-up</b> <b>reel.</b> The standard pen was a ball-point, but liquid ink pens were available, and typically used for higher quality plots intended for publication. Other paper stock could be taped to the drum if desired. A chart drive switch was provided {{to turn off the}} motorized paper supply and take-up reels for this purpose.|$|E
50|$|The main {{advantage}} of the RCA tape cartridge over reel-to-reel machines is convenience. The user {{is not required to}} handle unruly tape ends and thread the tape through the machine before use, making the medium of magnetic tape more friendly to casual users. In addition, since the cartridge carries both supply and <b>take-up</b> <b>reels,</b> the cartridge {{does not have to be}} rewound before the tape is removed from the machine and stored. Because of these conveniences, the RCA tape cartridge system did see some success in schools, particularly in student language learning labs.|$|R
50|$|Modern {{professional}} recorders usually use a three-motor scheme. One motor with {{a constant}} rotational speed drives the capstan. This, usually {{combined with a}} rubber pinch roller, ensures that the tape speed does not fluctuate. The other two motors, which are called Torque Motors, apply equal and opposite torques to the supply and take up reels during recording and play back functions and maintain the tape's tension. During fast winding operations the pinch roller is disengaged and the take up reel motor is supplied with a higher voltage than the supply motor. The cheapest models use a single motor for all required functions; the motor drives the capstan directly and the supply and <b>take-up</b> <b>reels</b> are loosely coupled to the capstan motor with slipping belts or clutches. There are also variants with two motors, in which one motor is used for rewinding only.|$|R
5000|$|Many nitrate {{films have}} been {{transferred}} in recent decades to safety stock, and original nitrate prints are generally stored separately to prevent a nitrate fire from destroying other non-nitrate films; the gas they give off also affects the emulsion of safety film. Usually nitrate collections are even split up into several different fireproof rooms to minimize damage to an entire collection should a fire occur in one part. It is normal for a theater today to pass rigorous safety standards and precautions before being certified to run nitrate films; this includes a fireproof projection booth, fire chambers surrounding the feed and <b>take-up</b> <b>reels,</b> and several fire extinguishers built into the projector and aimed at the projector's film gate in case a trigger piece of film fabric ignites. Nitrate film is classified as [...] "dangerous goods", which requires licenses for storage and transportation.|$|R

50|$|A {{different}} type of tape cartridge has a continuous loop of tape wound on a special reel that allows tape to be withdrawn {{from the center of}} the reel and then wrapped up around the edge.

50|$|Single-8 cartridges, {{without a}} press plate, {{are of a}} {{different}} design from a Super 8 cartridge, resembling a cassette-style design (supply and <b>take-up</b> <b>reels</b> side by side) as opposed to Super 8's coaxial cartridge design (one reel {{on top of the}} other). Therefore, Single-8 film cartridges can only be used in Single-8 cameras. However, the film loaded in a Single-8 cartridge has exactly the same dimensions as Super 8 (though it is made of a thinner and stronger polyester base, rather than the acetate base of Super 8 film), and can be viewed in any Super 8 projector after processing. However, Fuji recommended that only tape splices be used when combining Single-8 footage with Super-8, as cement would cause damage to the Single-8 footage. Also, when jammed, Single-8 footage had a tendency to stretch in the projector, unlike the acetate-based Super-8 film, which simply broke.|$|R
5000|$|The tape {{transport}} {{used on the}} LINC {{is essentially}} the same as the Type 555 transport, with the same interface signals and the same physical tape medium. The LINC and DEC controllers, however, are incompatible, and the positions of the supply and <b>take-up</b> <b>reels</b> were reversed between the LINC and DEC tape formats. While LINCtape supports high-speed bidirectional block search, it only supports actual data read and write operations in the forward direction. DECtape uses a significantly different mark track format to provide for the possibility of read and write operations in either direction, although not all DECtape controllers support reverse read.DEC applied for a patent on the enhanced features incorporated into DECtape in late 1964. [...] It is notable that the inventor listed on this patent, Thomas Stockebrand, is also an author of the paper on the TX-2 tape system from which the LINC tape was derived.|$|R
50|$|U-matic is an {{analogue}} recording videocassette format first shown by Sony in prototype in October 1969, and {{introduced to the}} market in September 1971. It {{was among the first}} video formats to contain the videotape inside a cassette, as opposed to the various reel-to-reel or open-reel formats of the time. Unlike most other cassette-based tape formats, the supply and <b>take-up</b> <b>reels</b> in the cassette turn in opposite directions during playback, fast-forward, and rewind: one reel would run clockwise while the other would run counter-clockwise. A locking mechanism integral to each cassette case secures the tape hubs during transportation to keep the tape wound tightly on the hubs. Once the cassette is taken off the case, the hubs are free to spin. A spring-loaded tape cover door protects the tape from damage; when the cassette is inserted into the VCR, the door is released and is opened, enabling the VCR mechanism to spool the tape around the spinning video drum. Accidental recording is prevented by the absence of a red plastic button fitted to a hole on the bottom surface of the tape; removal of the button disabled recording.|$|R

50|$|Like the 3590 and 3480 before it, {{this tape}} format has half inch tape spooled onto 4-by-5-by-1 inch data {{cartridges}} containing a single reel. A <b>take-up</b> <b>reel</b> is embedded inside the tape drive. Because of their speed, reliability, durability and low media cost, the 3592 tape drives {{are still in}} high demand. A hallmark of the genre is interchangeability. Tapes recorded with one tape drive are generally readable on another drive, even if the tape drives were built by different manufacturers.|$|E

50|$|Because {{the data}} rate was 5.8 million bits-per-second (5.8mbp/s), {{significant}} error detection and correction was required. A custom designed Reed-Solomon block code, was used with additional CRC characters for error correction. Interleaving of odd and even audio samples {{was performed to}} protect against burst errors. Just as in audio tape machines, transport problems with tension, guides, and supply and <b>take-up</b> <b>reels</b> could result in vertical or horizontal weave, and as bit sizes were only 14μm, precise timing and tracking was essential, thus the CDS system required installation of special projector modifications to smooth the film path travel and steady the take-up speed. It was found later, however, that modifications to the projectors were not needed and that the CDS systems sensitivity to improper film speed was due to a diode installed incorrectly in the CDS decoder module. Horizontal tracking was provided by a 76-MHz digital servo, while vertical timing was accomplished with an algorithm written into the data format itself. Rows of data were scanned horizontally, thus a self-clocking run-length-limited code was used for this error correction. A 6-to-8-bit mapping was performed upon encoding to ensure that each 8-bit word contained exactly four ones. This form of parity worked well in correcting errors upon decoding.|$|R

40|$|With climate change, over-population, and {{resource}} depletion in mind, I decided to explore what photography {{might look like}} in an apocalypse-like situation. High-end DSLR cameras have become ubiquitous in photography today {{but they are not}} the only means of producing photographs. In my honors project, I examine how images can be created with even the most limited technology. To simplify photography as much as possible, I researched pinhole photography, which was first used in the mid- 1800 s. By creating a small enough aperture with a tool such as a pin, an image could be projected onto a film plane. This was the perfect technique for my research, because pinhole cameras did not require a lens, viewfinder, or a shutter more complex than a piece of black tape. I could easily construct a pinhole camera even in the most limited conditions. I found containers in various locations and fashioned them into pinhole cameras using tools I either borrowed or previously owned, staying true to my apocalyptic theme. I purchased only 15 worth of new materials to construct the cameras. Even the books I used for research were either purchased secondhand or borrowed from the library. To record the images, I used 5 x 72 ̆ 2 sheets of semi-matte low contrast Arista. Edu darkroom paper as my negatives in the larger cameras. In the small camera, I used both 100 ISO 35 mm color and monochromatic film. Through my project, I identified exactly what tools were needed, at minimum, to make a camera that could produce a photograph. I also learned how to precisely measure the pinhole and focal length for the clearest focus. Beyond this, the process was not highly rigid. Many of the components could be improvised using items already in my home: black electric tape to make the camera light-tight, a magnet for an impromptu shutter, previously-used film canisters as <b>take-up</b> <b>reels.</b> Each pinhole camera had its own unique flaws, but they were relatively minor considering their makeshift quality. Shooting perfect images with the cameras, though, was nearly impossible. While virtually any container that could be made light-tight could be fashioned into a camera, they lacked the conveniences of modern cameras. Yet, each of these limitations tested my knowledge and ability as a photographer like never before...|$|R

As soon as the bobbins pass, the loom crisscrosses each pair of {{adjacent}} warp yarns to trap the filler yarn between them. This weaving process continues at a high speed as {{the lower end of}} the jacket is slowly drawn down through the loom, and the bobbins continue to wrap the filler yarns around the circumference of the jacket in a tight spiral.

50|$|The {{earliest}} {{video surveillance}} systems involved constant monitoring {{because there was}} no way to record and store information. The development of reel-to-reel media enabled the recording of surveillance footage. These systems required magnetic tapes to be changed manually, which was a time consuming, expensive and unreliable process, with the operator having to manually thread the tape from the tape reel through the recorder onto an empty <b>take-up</b> <b>reel.</b> Due to these shortcomings, video surveillance was not widespread. VCR technology became available in the 1970s, making it easier to record and erase information, and use of video surveillance became more common.|$|E
50|$|The way {{the film}} is fed from the platter to the {{projector}} is not unlike an eight-track audio cartridge. Film is unwound {{from the center of}} the platter through a mechanism called a payout unit which controls the speed of the platter's rotation so that it matches the speed of the film as it is fed to the projector. The film winds through a series of rollers from the platter stack to the projector, through the projector, through another series of rollers back to the platter stack, and then onto the platter serving as the <b>take-up</b> <b>reel.</b>|$|E
5000|$|DLT uses linear {{serpentine}} recording {{with multiple}} tracks on half-inch (12.7 mm) wide tape. The cartridges contain a single reel and {{the tape is}} {{pulled out of the}} cartridge by means of a leader tape attached to the <b>take-up</b> <b>reel</b> inside the drive. The drive leader tape is buckled to the cartridge leader during the load process. Tape speed and tension are controlled electronically via the reel motors; there is no [...] capstan. The tape is guided by 4 to 6 rollers that touch only {{the back side of the}} tape. Tape material is metal particle tape (MP/AMP).|$|E
50|$|Frippertronics (a term {{coined by}} poet Joanna Walton, Fripp's girlfriend {{in the late}} 1970s) is an analog delay system {{consisting}} of two side-by-side reel-to-reel tape recorders. The machines are configured so that the tape travels from the supply reel of the first machine to the <b>take-up</b> <b>reel</b> of the second, allowing sound recorded by the first machine to be played back later on the second. The audio of the second machine is routed back to the first, causing the delayed signal to repeat while new audio is mixed in with it. The amount of delay (usually three to five seconds) is controlled by increasing or reducing {{the distance between the}} machines.|$|E
50|$|The first VCR system sold {{directly}} to home users was 1963's Telcan from the UK, {{but this was}} not a commercial success. Sony's CV-2000 was a complete system based on commercial -inch tape on open reels, requiring the user to thread the tape around the helical scan heads. In order to conserve tape, the system recorded every other frame of the television signal, producing 200-line output. Similar models from Ampex and RCA followed that year. The number of open-reel VCRs continued to increase during the late 1960s, leading to the EIAJ-1 standard for -inch tape on a 7 inch reel. The follow-up EIAJ-2 built the <b>take-up</b> <b>reel</b> into the VCR body.|$|E
50|$|When EIAJ-1 was standardized, no Videocassette {{recorders}} had {{yet been}} introduced. One {{of the main}} drawbacks to the format was the need to carefully thread {{the end of the}} tape around the head drum, through a gap between the capstan and pinch roller, and around a variety of guides and tensioners. If the user made any errors in doing this, the machine would malfunction and the tape could become damaged. So, another version, EIAJ-2, was released later on that used a single-reel cartridge (with the <b>take-up</b> <b>reel</b> being built into the VTR) instead of an open take up reel. Otherwise, the recording specifications were exactly the same.|$|E
5000|$|The 3400 Series Magnetic Tape Units were {{introduced}} with the IBM System/370. The primary {{advantages of the}} 3400 system were the higher data density (6250 BPI) {{and support of the}} [...] "autoloader" [...] cartridge, first seen in the IBM 2420 model 7. Prior to the autoloader cartridge, tapes were sealed in a plastic [...] "tape seal belt" [...] that surrounded the reel and provided contamination protection and rack-hanging capability. The 3420's autoloader cartridge enabled the tape operator to mount the reel directly on the hub without having to remove the seal belt. This provided a significant time saving and reduced operator errors since the operator did not have to remove/replace the belt or thread the tape onto the <b>take-up</b> <b>reel.</b>|$|E
50|$|The tape {{motion in}} the UNISERVO I was {{controlled}} by a single capstan connected to a synchronous motor. Supply and <b>take-up</b> <b>reel</b> motion was buffered via a complex pulley-string-spring arrangement, as the design was prior to {{the invention of the}} vacuum column buffer. The tape drive contained a permanent leader, and each tape reel had a connector link to the leader. The nickel-plated phosphor bronze tapes were very abrasive, and to counter this problem a thin plastic wear tape was slowly moved over the recording head, between the head and the tape, preventing the recording head from quickly wearing out. The metal tapes also were dirty, and a slowly renewed felt wiper collected tape debris. The UNISERVO I had a high-speed rewind capability, and multiple drives on the UNIVAC I could rewind while others continued with data processing reads or writes.|$|E
50|$|To {{facilitate}} handling as {{the user}} threaded the wire across the recording head and affixed {{it to the}} take-up spool, some manufacturers attached a strip of plastic to {{each end of the}} wire. This was designed to press-fit snugly into either spool. To prevent the wire from piling up unevenly on the spool as it was recorded, played or rewound, on the majority of machines the head assembly slowly oscillates up and down or back and forth to distribute the wire evenly. On some machines, moving wire guides perform this function, like the mechanism that distributes line across a fishing reel. After recording or playback, the wire has to be rewound before any further use can be made of the machine. Unlike with reel-to-reel tape recorders, the <b>take-up</b> <b>reel</b> on most wire recorders is not removable.|$|E
5000|$|To load a tape, an {{operator}} would remove the protective ring (frequently called a [...] "tape seal belt" [...] because its {{purpose was to}} prevent humidity and dust on the media) from {{the outside of the}} tape reel and install the tape on the supply hub, then thread the tape leader through the various roller assemblies and onto the <b>take-up</b> <b>reel,</b> installing three or four winds of tape to provide enough friction for the take-up motor to be able to pull the tape. The operator then initiated an automatic sequence, often by a single press of a button, that would start the vacuum system, then move the tape forward until the beginning-of-tape (BOT) foil strip was detected by an optical sensor in the tape path. The control electronics would then indicate to the controlling computer that the unit was ready for operation.|$|E
