5000|$|The Chief Priest of the island's temple. Father to Kasumi, {{he appears}} as a {{harmless}} and unsuspecting man on the surface but soon reveals his dark and masochistic nature as he indulges in violent sex or rape {{with most of the}} female cast. In the first episode, it is revealed that he has a sadistic and violent relationship with Junko; one of the servers. He often performs the dark cult's religious right to rape young female sacrifices as witnessed through the seduction and sacrifice of Kasumi's lover; Misa. The reason for this is explained later on; the <b>tendons</b> <b>and</b> <b>sinews</b> of the victims used for the frightening mannequin's joints are always best after the victim reaches climax. He reveals in the third episode to Ryo that Hotaruku is her mother, rapes Ruka while implying that they have done this act countless times before and is consequently killed by the mannequins. He is voiced by Cliff Kirk in the English dub.|$|E
50|$|The Mi'kmaq {{lived in}} an annual cycle of {{seasonal}} movement between living in dispersed interior winter camps and larger coastal communities during the summer. The spawning runs of March began their movement to converge on smelt spawning streams. They next harvested spawning herring, gathered waterfowl eggs, and hunted geese. By May, the seashore offered abundant cod and shellfish, and coastal breezes brought relief from the biting black flies, stouts, midges and mosquitoes of the interior. Autumn frost killed the biting insects during the September harvest of spawning American eels. Smaller groups would disperse into the interior where they hunted moose and caribou. The most important animal hunted by the Mi'kmaq was the moose, which was used in every part: for example, the meat was processed for food, the skin for clothing, <b>tendons</b> <b>and</b> <b>sinew</b> for cordage, <b>and</b> bones for carving and tools. Other animals hunted/trapped included deer, caribou, bear, rabbit, beaver, porcupine and small animals.|$|R
5000|$|The basic {{purpose of}} Yijin Jing {{is to turn}} flaccid <b>and</b> frail <b>sinews</b> <b>and</b> <b>tendons</b> into strong <b>and</b> sturdy ones. The {{movements}} of Yijin Jing are at once vigorous and gentle. Their performance calls for a unity of will and strength, i.e. using one's will to direct the exertion of muscular strength. It is coordinated with breathing. Better muscles <b>and</b> <b>tendons</b> means better health and shape, more resistance, flexibility, and endurance. It is obtained as follows: ...|$|R

6000|$|On {{the morning}} in question, Mrs Roby, lying placidly in her neat white little bed, and gazing with a sweet {{contented}} face through one of her cabin windows at the bright blue sky, heard a sound as though a compound animal--hog and whale--had aroused itself and rolled over on its other side. A low whistling followed. Mrs Roby knew that the Captain was pleasantly engaged with his thoughts--planning out {{the proceedings of the}} day. Suddenly the whistling ceased and was followed by a sonorous [...] "how-ho!" [...] terminating in a gasp worthy of an express locomotive. The Captain had stretched himself and Mrs Roby smiled at her own thoughts, as well she might for they embraced the idea that a twentieth part of the force employed in that stretch would have rent in twain every <b>tendon,</b> muscle, <b>sinew,</b> <b>and</b> filament in her, Mrs Roby's, body. Next, there descended on the floor overhead a sixteen-stone cannon ball, which caused--not the neighbours, but the boards and rafters to complain. The Captain was up! and succeeding sounds proved that he had had another stretch, for there was a bump {{in the middle of it}} which showed that, forgetting his stature, the careless man had hit the ceiling with his head. That was evidently a matter of no consequence.|$|R

50|$|In the {{few months}} of summer, the people moved camp to the estuaries, because there {{it was easier to}} catch the favoured Arctic char, e.g. by using {{artificial}} weirs, and the eggs of seabirds. For the inland Inuit, the caribou was the most important resource; it provided meat, a hide for clothing, <b>and</b> <b>sinew</b> for rope. The coastal Inuit hunted mostly seals and walruses and, depending on the region, narwhals and belugas; of course also the occasional caribou. The seals were used for food for men and dogs. Their oil was used for the kudliks, and their skin <b>and</b> <b>sinews</b> for seal boots (kamik), kayak coverings, ropes (also drag ropes for dog sleds) and dog whips.|$|R

500|$|A {{composite}} bow is {{a traditional}} bow made from horn, wood, <b>and</b> <b>sinew</b> laminated together, cf., laminated bow. The horn is on the belly, facing the archer, <b>and</b> <b>sinew</b> on the outer side of a wooden core. When the bow is drawn, the sinew (stretched on the outside) and horn (compressed on the inside) store more energy than wood for the same length of bow. The strength can be made {{similar to that of}} all-wood [...] "self" [...] bows, with similar draw-length and therefore a similar amount of energy delivered to the arrow from a much shorter bow. However, making a composite bow requires more varieties of material than a self bow, its construction takes much more time, and the finished bow is more sensitive to moisture.|$|R
