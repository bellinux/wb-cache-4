500|$|Thornton {{brought in}} sound {{engineer}} J. D. Andrew {{to help with}} his 2007 album Beautiful Door. After jamming together, they started to record some of their material. Andrew had known Mike Butler [...] "for six or seven years" [...] and called on him to play guitar for them. According to Andrew, after the trio played together, they said [...] "Shoot, <b>this</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> band." [...] The three {{came up with the}} name [...] "Boxmasters" [...] after a piece of Southern slang, which they later described by saying [...] "remember the bad boy in high school who got all the girls and left a trail of broken hearts ... and more?" [...] Thornton had also briefly played in country star Porter Wagoner's similarly titled band 'The Wagonmasters', which he later said had brought chills down his spine.|$|E
500|$|The year 1968 {{marked the}} start of what Dylan himself later termed his [...] "amnesia", {{referring}} {{to a form of}} writer's block he experienced post-John Wesley Harding (1967), when painting had replaced songwriting as his preferred creative outlet. Well known for his unsophisticated musical approach, particularly in comparison to Harrison's broader [...] "harmonic palette", author Simon Leng suggests, Dylan was now eager to learn some more-advanced chords. Harrison began demonstrating various major seventh, diminished and augmented chord shapes – [...] "all these funny chords people showed me when I was a kid", as he later put it. While playing a G major 7 chord and taking the shape up the guitar neck to B major 7, Harrison realised, [...] "Ah, <b>this</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> tune here..." [...] Keen to break down the barriers that Dylan had imposed, Harrison came up with the song's opening lines: ...|$|E
500|$|The album {{features}} four guest artists; Rakim {{from the}} hip hop duo Eric B. & Rakim on [...] "Guilty All the Same", Page Hamilton from the American alternative metal band Helmet on [...] "All for Nothing", Daron Malakian from System of a Down for the song [...] "Rebellion" [...] and Tom Morello of Rage Against the Machine fame on the song [...] "Drawbar". Bennington commented on the collaborations, stating that [...] "We really felt like {{if we need to}} be inspired and move in another direction. I think when we got Page in, Mike had written this chorus and sang it, and his voice had this tone, and it was unlike anything I'd heard from him before. And I was like, [...] "Dude this is crazy, <b>this</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> Helmet song! It's cool!" [...] And we were like, [...] "Dude, why don't we {{see if we can get}} like Page in here?" [...] You know? And if that's why the song says it's feeling like it should be, then why don't we just go straight to the source".|$|E
50|$|I know <b>this</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> in-joke, but it's a sad truth.|$|R
60|$|<b>This</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> very bloodthirsty mode {{of showing}} one's gratitude; {{and as the}} old lady did not {{precisely}} understand {{the process by which}} such a result was to be attained, all her former horrors returned.|$|R

2500|$|Thursday, 4 August. There {{was a game}} on Coxheath Common between teams {{representing}} [...] "the Hill" [...] and [...] "the Valley". <b>This</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> similar idea to {{the early}} match at Chevening in the year 1610; {{and may have been}} commemorative.|$|E
2500|$|... {{but nobody}} else has used this {{name for the}} song. <b>This</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> misinterpretation, since there is a Child Ballad (number 73) called [...] "Lord Thomas and Fair Elleanor" [...] which {{involves}} a man killing a fair woman, but {{without any of the}} motivation of hunting for a swan.|$|E
2500|$|If {{they are}} not secured, the loops of a knitted course will come undone when their yarn is pulled; {{this is known as}} ripping out, {{unravelling}} knitting, or humorously, frogging (because you 'rip it', <b>this</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> frog croaking: 'rib-bit'). To secure a stitch, at least one new loop is passed through it. Although the new stitch is itself unsecured ("active" [...] or [...] "live"), it secures the stitch(es) suspended from it. A sequence of stitches in which each stitch is suspended from the next is called a wale. To secure the initial stitches of a knitted fabric, a method for casting on is used; to secure the final stitches in a wale, one uses a method of binding/casting off. During knitting, the active stitches are secured mechanically, either from individual hooks (in knitting machines) or from a knitting needle or frame in hand-knitting.|$|E
5000|$|The song is {{considered}} a novelty song, with lyrics mostly in English. In German, the word [...] "Geil" [...] originally meant [...] "horny" [...] but by the 1980s had come to also mean [...] "cool" [...] or [...] "awesome" [...] in slang. For the older generation <b>this</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> provocation, and {{it was meant to}} be one of course.|$|R
50|$|Full Dirty - The name says it all. You may do {{absolutely}} {{anything as}} long as it still touches your square only once. Players often hold the ball and advance it into other players squares before attempting to eliminate them. While <b>this</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> unfair advantage, other players can physically block entrance into their square or even steal the ball from another player's possession.|$|R

2500|$|In 2008, {{when it was}} {{announced}} that both Ricky and Bianca were being reintroduced, executive producer Diederick Santer described them as [...] "a hugely popular and well-loved partnership on the show". Other media sources branded them two of [...] "the most popular characters on the soap" [...] and an [...] "iconic couple". However, Hazel Davis of The Guardian was critical about their reintroduction. She commented, [...] "It's a no-brainer on the show's part. Last year, ratings for EastEnders were at an all-time low. But, just for once, wouldn't it be nice if a soap opera actually introduced new characters with verve and staying power rather than digging up the oldies?". Conversely, Mark Wright from The Stage said that the decision to bring these much-loved characters back [...] "is very welcome". He comments, [...] "Previous returns have been all about the numbers and not about the story, which is the cardinal sin in this game. While there is, of course, the resultant publicity that comes with any new or returning soap character being announced, the storyline possibilities for Ricky and Bianca arriving back in the Square are good. Bianca is turning up with a brood of kids in tow, all belonging to different fathers (how many of them can we expect to see {{over the next couple of}} years?). Like it! Ricky arrives with a glamorous WAG [...] on his arm. [...] I sense friction along the way, especially when Ricky realises he never got over Bianca (how could he?). All very well thought through and positive. <b>This</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> soap getting back in touch with its roots.".|$|E
6000|$|<b>This</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> serious statement. But {{what shall}} we say to a convert who plays with his newly-acquired belief in a future life, as Heine does in the very next page? He says to his reader: ...|$|E
6000|$|CURTIS--[Frowning.] I can't {{imagine it}} without her. You people can't {{have any idea}} what a help--a chum--she's been. You can't believe that a woman could be--so much that--in a life of that kind--how I've grown to depend on her. The {{thousand}} details--she attends to them all. She remembers everything. Why, I'd be lost. I wouldn't know how to start. [With a laugh.] I know <b>this</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> confession of weakness but it's true just the same. [Frowning again.] However, naturally my work must always be the first consideration. Yes, absolutely! [Then with glad relief.] But what's the use of rambling on this way? We can both go, thank heaven! ...|$|E
50|$|Musicologist K. J. McElrath {{wrote of}} the song:Gershwin was remarkably {{successful}} in his intent to have <b>this</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> folk song. <b>This</b> is reinforced by his extensive use of the pentatonic scale (C-D-E-G-A) {{in the context of}} the A minor tonality and a slow-moving harmonic progression that suggests a “blues”. Because of these factors, this tune has been a favorite of jazz performers for decades and can be done in a variety of tempos and styles.|$|R
6000|$|Is it {{possible}} to conceive any thing more provoking than this humble supplication of these remonstrators? Does not <b>this</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> demand of {{the repeal of the}} Test, at the peril of those, who dare refuse it? Is it not an application with a hat in one hand, and a sword in the other, and that too, in the style of a King of Ulster, to a King of Connaught, --"Repeal the Test, or if you don't........." ...|$|R
40|$|This {{first in}} a series of blogs posts on the theme of Why Sociology? is from Mira Buerger, an MSc student in the Department of Sociology at LSE. I study sociology. And I did and will work in the {{business}} world. For many people <b>this</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> oxymoron. But sociology provides me what is so often demanded by today’s recruiters: T shaped expertise. Both IBM and Ideo’s CEO Tim Brown called for the T-shaped employees already back in 2010...|$|R
60|$|My eldest boy is in {{business}} as an Eastern merchant in the City, {{and will do}} well if he can find continuous energy; otherwise not. My second boy is with the 42nd Highlanders in India. My third boy, a good steady fellow, is educating expressly for engineers or artillery. My fourth (<b>this</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> charade), a born little sailor, is a midshipman in H.M.S. Orlando, now at Bermuda, and will make his way anywhere. Remaining two at school, elder of said remaining two very bright and clever. Georgina and Mary keeping house for me; and Francis Jeffrey (I ought to have counted him as the third boy, so we'll take him in here as number two and a half) in my office at present. Now you have the family bill of fare.|$|E
60|$|Give me {{patience}} while I put {{the principle}} of machine labor before you, as clearly and in as short compass as possible; {{it is one that}} should be known at this juncture. Suppose a farming proprietor needs to employ a hundred men on his estate, and that the labor of these hundred men is enough, but not more than enough, to till all his land, and to raise from it food for his own family, and for the hundred laborers. He is obliged, under such circumstances, to maintain all the men in moderate comfort, and can only by economy accumulate much for himself. But, suppose he contrive a machine that will easily do the work of fifty men, with only one man to watch it. <b>This</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> great advance in civilization. The farmer of course gets his machine made, turns off the fifty men, who may starve or emigrate at their choice, and now he can keep half of the produce of his estate, which formerly went to feed them, all to himself. That is the essential and constant operation of machinery among us at this moment.|$|E

50|$|By merging {{the only}} two {{professional}} hockey clubs in China, the China Sharks essentially became the Chinese national team which would compete in the Asia League Ice Hockey and eventually in the Olympics. Since <b>this</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> truly unique experience to teach and spread the game of hockey into Asia while expanding into a new market, {{the parent company of}} the San Jose Sharks, Silicon Valley Sports and Entertainment, made a decision to send players and coaches to China prior to the 2007-08 season.|$|R
50|$|One {{more thing}} {{that one should}} mention is that <b>this</b> canto <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> kind of prayer or {{confession}} of the poet. This confession does not address God and therefore sounds very impersonal.|$|R
50|$|After this, Haines disbanded the Auteurs, only {{to bring}} them back {{together}} again for their fourth album How I Learned to Love the Bootboys. <b>This</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> amalgamation of Haines' previous styles: it is electronic, but has the same concern for pop hooks as his first two albums: on the other hand, the lyrics are brooding and obsessive, in a similar way to those on After Murder Park. From this point on, The Auteurs became merely a name for whatever musicians Haines chose to bring together for specific projects.|$|R

5000|$|In {{the fall}} of 1998, Shaw moved back to New York City, this time {{accompanied}} by Haines, Campbell, and Seligman. There they shared a loft in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn. During their two-year stay at the loft, Haines and Shaw were erstwhile roommates with future members of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Liars and TV on the Radio. In an interview with 91X FM radio, Shaw said that although <b>this</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> amazing place to live, they were broke and [...] "it was difficult for everyone involved".|$|R
6000|$|... "On {{the lips}} of <b>a</b> moralist <b>this</b> would <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> rebuke," [...] he said, half seriously; [...] "but I won't suspect you of being one. Moralists and I haven't been friends for many years." ...|$|R

5000|$|Bagge's {{signature}} elastic, kinetic art {{style is}} a product of his love for 1940s Warner Brothers cartoons (especially those directed by Bob Clampett). Bagge has said that he [...] "always wanted to capture that sense of movement and exaggeration in a static format. In retrospect <b>this</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> futile thing to attempt, but I think I wound up pulling it off better than I ever thought I would." ...|$|E
50|$|A {{methodology}} for designing experiments was proposed by Ronald A. Fisher, in his innovative book The Design of Experiments (1935) which {{also became a}} standard. As an example, he described how {{to test the hypothesis}} that a certain lady could distinguish by flavour alone whether the milk or the tea was first placed in the cup. While <b>this</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> frivolous application, it allowed him to illustrate the most important ideas of experimental design: see Lady tasting tea.|$|E
