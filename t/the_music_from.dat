5|$|Unlike <b>the</b> <b>music</b> <b>from</b> {{the main}} Final Fantasy series, no songs from Final Fantasy X-2 have been played {{at any of}} the {{numerous}} Final Fantasy concerts.

5|$|Berlioz's {{version is}} one of many which combine the Italian and French scores, {{although}} it is the most influential and well regarded. Since about 1870 three-act adaptations of the Berlioz score, translating it back into Italian and restoring much of <b>the</b> <b>music</b> <b>from</b> the 1774 French version which Berlioz had left out, were common. An 1889 edition for contralto, published by Ricordi, became the most popular. On occasion the role of Orfeo has even been transposed down an octave for a baritone to sing. Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau and Hermann Prey are two notable baritones who have performed the role in Germany. Fischer-Dieskau recorded the opera several times; his recordings are still available commercially.|$|E

5|$|In 2012, a Kickstarter {{campaign}} for OverClocked ReMix was funded at $153,633 {{for the creation}} of a multiple CD album of remixes of <b>the</b> <b>music</b> <b>from</b> Final Fantasy VI.

The album is free and available at the OverClocked ReMix website.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese {{version of}} Dirge of Cerberus {{included}} a multiplayer mode absent from other releases, which contained music tracks {{not used in}} the single-player game. Dirge of Cerberus: Final Fantasy VII Multiplayer Mode Original Sound Collections is a download-only soundtrack album for the multiplayer tracks released through the Japanese iTunes Store and the Square Enix Music Download website on August 22, 2006. It spans 1:07:07 over 27 tracks. The soundtrack includes all <b>the</b> <b>music</b> <b>from</b> the multiplayer mode and some music from the single-player game which did not appear on the previous soundtrack album, including two tracks composed by Ryo Yamazaki for the North American release of the game.|$|E
5|$|The only soundtrack album {{released}} for {{the game}} was Xenosaga III: Also Sprach Zarathustra Original Sound Best Tracks, an album of selections from the soundtrack rather {{than all of the}} tracks. The two-disc album has 40 tracks, and a total length of 1:51:46. It was published by Victor Entertainment on July 12, 2006. The album reached position #50 on the Japanese Oricon charts, and stayed on the charts for four weeks. In the liner notes for the album, sound producer Keiichi Nozaki explains that the album would have needed to be six discs long to hold all of <b>the</b> <b>music</b> <b>from</b> the game, so he asked Kajiura to select a sample that would only fill two discs.|$|E

5|$|The track lengths for {{a number}} of tracks on all three discs are {{different}} than the Original Sound Version release. On the first disc, tracks 24-27 are new arranged version tracks that were included as <b>the</b> <b>music</b> <b>from</b> those tracks corresponded to the video animated sequences that were added originally on the PlayStation version. The same applied to tracks 25-27 on the second disc and tracks 18-24 on the third disc.|$|E
5|$|A {{sequel to}} Nier, , was {{released}} in February 2017. Its music was again composed by Keiichi Okabe and the Monaca team, with Emi Evans and Nami Nakagawa on vocals, Takanori Goto on guitar, and additional contributions by several artists. A soundtrack album for the game was released worldwide by Square Enix on March 29, 2017. The three-disc, 3:33:43-long album contains all of <b>the</b> <b>music</b> <b>from</b> the game, as well as, like the original game's album, variations on the main theme in multiple languages. Unlike the original Nier, where all of the versions were written and sung by Emi Evans and had the same lyrical meanings, the versions in Automata were written and sung by multiple people: the English version by J'Nique Nicole, one in an invented French-derived language by Evans, and the Japanese written by Yoko Taro and sung by Marina Kawano.|$|E
5|$|As {{with nearly}} every Dragon Quest game, Koichi Sugiyama {{composed}} the musical score. As {{was done for}} Dragon Quest VI, the original sound version was bundled with the symphonic suite in a two-disc set called Dragon Quest VII: Eden no Senshitachi Symphonic Suite + OST. The entire first disc and the opening track of the second disc consists of the symphonic suite, {{while the rest of}} the second disc is the original sound version. The Symphonic Suite was released alone on Super Audio CD later that year, and re-released in 2009. A disc titled Dragon Quest VII: Eden no Senshitachi on Piano was also released, and contained 27 piano-arranged tracks. The Symphonic Suite was later re-recorded in 2006 along with the rest of <b>the</b> <b>music</b> <b>from</b> the series. An original soundtrack for the 3DS remake was released on March 19, 2014, and features the original recordings by the Tokyo Metropolitan Symphony Orchestra from the remake.|$|E

5|$|By March 2008, the duo had {{recruited}} SebRochford to play drums with Byrne in New York City. Later that month, multi-instrumentalist {{and previous}} Eno collaborator LeoAbrahams was enlisted to perform guitar, percussion instruments, and piano in his London home studio. Abrahams and Rochford would continue {{working on the}} tracks in Abrahams' studio through May and their work was e-mailed to other collaborators—Byrne attended one session to play guitar. Other musicians worked with Byrne in NewYorkCity and Eno in London, such as frequent Byrne collaborator MauroRefosco, Eno's daughters Darla and Irial, and JarvisCocker of Pulp, who added uncredited guitar in London. The duo attempted to record as much of <b>the</b> <b>music</b> <b>from</b> home studios as possible and played almost all instrumentation themselves, saving the drums and percussion for the studio. In addition to the tracks that were released, the musicians had some other instrumentals that Byrne did not complete.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{being well}} {{received}} by fans and critically acclaimed and nominated in 1983 for a BAFTA and Golden Globe as best original score, {{and the promise}} of a soundtrack album from Polydor Records in the end titles of the film, the release of the official soundtrack recording was delayed for over a decade. There are two official releases of <b>the</b> <b>music</b> <b>from</b> Blade Runner. In light of the lack of a release of an album, the New American Orchestra recorded an orchestral adaptation in 1982 which bore little resemblance to the original. Some of the film tracks would, in 1989, surface on the compilation Vangelis: Themes, but not until the 1992 release of the Director's Cut version would a substantial amount of the film's score see commercial release.|$|E
5|$|During {{the summer}} of 2015, Gočeva {{embarked}} on a small tour in which she promoted the two albums from the project Makedonsko Devojče. The concerts took place in Bitola at Heraclea Lyncestis on 23 July, in Ohrid at the Ancient Theatre of Ohrid on 24 July and in Dojran at a city park on 2 August. The singer also performed in Prilep at the Pivo Fest festival on 15 July 2016, where she sang numerous songs from the album. In 2015, Gočeva explained {{in an interview that}} performing at the concerts where she sang songs from Makedonsko Devojče 2 was a challenge for her due to the great vocal effort she had to put and the lack of background vocals during the live performances. She also revealed that a band of ten musicians was specifically assembled to perform <b>the</b> <b>music</b> <b>from</b> the album live; it consisted of several Macedonian music academics who accompanied her on-stage.|$|E
