5|$|Before marriage, women {{used to wear}} a Kirgi (sari) and Baju (blouse). The Kirgi is a {{piece of}} cloth not longer than four feet, and about three feet wide. It was wrapped around the body from the waist down. A jacket with long sleeves called a Baju, was used to cover {{the upper part of the}} body. This dress was a sign of the bride's virginity and was worn during the Ros ceremony. The Kirgi was wrapped around the waist, but the end of the sari is not <b>thrown</b> <b>over</b> the shoulder. To wear the sari with its end <b>thrown</b> <b>over</b> the shoulder, known as Worl, is the {{exclusive}} right of a married woman. Married women used to wear sarees the general way. The Salwar kameez is another form of popular dress for females. The Mangalorean Catholic bride's wedding sari is known as a Sado. It is usually a red-coloured Banarasi sari which is made of finely woven silk and is decorated with elaborate engravings. In olden days, the bride wore on her head a red cloth, three feet square. Gold ornaments were absent in those days: the bride went to the church dressed as a virgin girl. In modern times, the bride wears (in place of the Kirgi) a red sari, but the end of the sari is not <b>thrown</b> <b>over</b> the shoulder; it is wrapped around the waist. The bride wears a few gold ornaments, some rings on the fingers, earrings, and at least two of the Dantoni (golden combs). Other ornaments worn by the bride in the olden days included Kanti, Chakrasar, Kap, Karap, Mugud, Kanto, and Dantoni.|$|E
5|$|Mota {{has three}} {{different}} kinds of pitches: a fastball, a slider, and a circle changeup. The slider is the pitch he usually uses to get outs. Wildness {{has been a problem}} for him, though, and his fastball is easy to hit when <b>thrown</b> <b>over</b> the plate. In the past, he has thrown a splitter and a curveball.|$|E
5|$|A {{fathometer}} was {{not required}} under USCG regulations, and Fitzgerald lacked one, even though fathometers were {{available at the time}} of her sinking. Instead, a hand line was the only method Fitzgerald had to take depth soundings. The hand line consisted of a piece of line knotted at measured intervals with a lead weight on the end. The line was <b>thrown</b> <b>over</b> the bow of the ship and the count of the knots measured the water depth. The NTSB investigation concluded that a fathometer would have provided Fitzgerald additional navigational data and made her less dependent on Anderson for navigational assistance.|$|E

5|$|In {{relation}} {{to this group}} of works, the Commission express the opinion that an enemy {{will not attempt to}} enter Washington from this direction, and that we cannot (as a general rule) expect to be able to meet him with a line of troops. What is to be prevented is the seizure of these heights for the purpose of establishing batteries to destroy the navy-yard and arsenal. For this purpose the works should be self-sustaining, or relying only upon such aid as a small movable body of troops can furnish, and upon succor, which may be <b>thrown</b> <b>over</b> the Branch after an attack is developed.|$|E
5|$|Other risks {{associated}} with the crinoline were that it could get caught in other people's feet, carriage wheels or furniture, or be caught by sudden gusts of wind, blowing the wearer off their feet. In 1859, while participating in a paper chase, Louisa, Duchess of Manchester, caught her hoop while climbing over a stile, and was left with the entirety of her crinoline and skirts <b>thrown</b> <b>over</b> her head, revealing her scarlet drawers to the assembled company.|$|E
5|$|Pathogenic microbes, and toxins {{that they}} produce, have been {{developed}} as possible agents of warfare. Crude forms of biological warfare have been practiced since antiquity. In the 6th century BC, the Assyrians poisoned enemy wells with a fungus said to render the enemy delirious. In 1346, the bodies of Mongol warriors of the Golden Horde who had died of plague were <b>thrown</b> <b>over</b> {{the walls of the}} besieged Crimean city of Kaffa, possibly assisting the spread of the Black Death into Europe.|$|E

5|$|The first {{match at}} Victory Road to air live on PPV was a twenty-man Gauntlet match, {{consisting}} of wrestlers who compete in TNA's X Division. In this particular match, wrestlers were eliminated by being <b>thrown</b> <b>over</b> the top rope {{and down to}} the floor until there were two left in the ring. Those two men had a standard match until one was pinned or made to submit. The final two participants were Kazarian and HÃ©ctor Garza. Kazarian tried to pin Garza with a Cradle, but Garza countered the maneuver with a roll-up for the win.|$|E

General Manager Theodore Long {{informed}} the pair {{that they would}} instead be facing Kane and The Undertaker later that night in a match, which Kane and The Undertaker won. At the Royal Rumble, the Royal Rumble match was held, where the winner is the final person left in the ring after the other twenty nine wrestlers are eliminated by being <b>thrown</b> <b>over</b> the top ring rope. The Undertaker won the Royal Rumble match to earn a title shot at WrestleMania 23. At WrestleMania, he defeated Batista to win the World Heavyweight Championship and maintain his WrestleMania undefeated streak.|$|E
5|$|Salt is {{considered}} to be a very auspicious substance in Hinduism and is used in particular religious ceremonies like house-warmings and weddings. In Jainism, devotees lay an offering of raw rice with a pinch of salt before a deity to signify their devotion and salt is sprinkled on a person's cremated remains before the ashes are buried. Salt is believed to ward off evil spirits in Mahayana Buddhist tradition, and when returning home from a funeral, a pinch of salt is <b>thrown</b> <b>over</b> the left shoulder as this prevents evil spirits from entering the house. In Shinto, salt is used for ritual purification of locations and people (harae, specifically shubatsu), and small piles of salt are placed in dishes by the entrance of establishments for the two-fold purposes of warding off evil and attracting patrons.|$|E

50|$|Grady {{is known}} for being part of an unfortunate piece of {{baseball}} history. As a third baseman for the Giants in 1899, Grady committed four fielding errors on a single play. He misplayed a groundball for one error, <b>threw</b> <b>over</b> the first baseman's head for another, dropped the throw from the first baseman {{as he tried to}} gun down the runner at third, and <b>threw</b> <b>over</b> the catcher's head into the stands as the base runner broke for home.|$|R
5|$|The fox {{discovers the}} badger {{asleep in his}} bed, and {{originally}} plans to hit him, but decides against this due to the Badger's teeth. He decides to play a trick upon him involving a pail of water balanced on the overhead tester of the bed. Brock however is awake, escapes the trick, and makes tea for himself in the kitchen. Mr. Tod thinks the bucket has killed Tommy and decides to bury him in the tunnel the rabbits have dug, thinking Tommy dug it. When Mr. Tod discovers Tommy in the Kitchen and has tea <b>thrown</b> <b>over</b> him, a violent fight erupts that continues outdoors. The two roll away down the hill still fighting. Benjamin and Peter quickly gather the bunnies, and return home in triumph.|$|E
5|$|The {{mail pouch}} was a {{separate}} component to the saddle {{that made the}} Pony Express unique. Standard mail pouches for horses were never employed because of their size and shape, as it was time consuming detaching and attaching it from one saddle to the other, causing undue delay in changing mounts. With many stops to make, the delayed time at each station would accumulate to appreciable proportions. To get around this difficulty, a mochila, or covering of leather, was <b>thrown</b> <b>over</b> the saddle. The saddle horn and cantle projected through holes which were specially cut to size in the mochila. Attached to the broad leather skirt of the mochila were four cantinas, or box-shaped hard leather compartments, where letters were carried on the journey.|$|E
5|$|A {{civil war}} between Stephen and the Empress Matilda soon broke out and Gilbert took his chance to rise up against Stephen, seizing Ludlow Castle. Stephen responded by taking an army into the Welsh Marches, where he {{attempted}} to garner local support by marrying one of his knights, Joce de Dinan, to Sybil and granting the future ownership of the castle to them. Stephen took the castle after several attempts in 1139, famously rescuing his ally Prince Henry of Scotland when the latter was caught on a hook <b>thrown</b> <b>over</b> the walls by the garrison. Gilbert still maintained {{that he was the}} rightful owner of Ludlow, however, and a private war ensued between Joce and himself. Gilbert was ultimately successful and retook the castle around a few years {{before the end of the}} civil war in 1153. He ultimately left for the Levant, leaving Ludlow in the hands of firstly, his eldest son, Robert, and then, after Robert's death, his younger son, Hugh de Lacy.|$|E

He did not so much <b>throw</b> as jerk <b>over</b> Mrs. Scrymgeour, and she did not so much make a novel of it as upset a huge pailful of attenuated and adulterated female soul upon this occasion. My aunt did not appear in that, even remotely. So that it is doubtful if the lady knew the real causes of her abandonment. The Napoleonic hero was practically unmarried, and he <b>threw</b> <b>over</b> his lady as Napoleon <b>threw</b> <b>over</b> Josephine for a great alliance.|$|R

5|$|In 1986, Sue Ellen {{goes into}} {{business}} by buying a partnership {{interest in a}} lingerie company. She successfully lures J.R.'s latest mistress, Mandy Winger, away from J.R. by offering her a promising career as model and then as an actress. Sue Ellen and J.R. enjoy a brief reconciliation; however, J.R.'s desire to regain Ewing Oil by {{having an affair with}} Kimberly Cryder destroys what is left of their marriage. Sue Ellen decides to leave J.R. for good, but he manages to take John Ross away and put him into hiding in a boarding school. Sue Ellen and her new lover, Nicholas Pearce, confront J.R. at his penthouse and demand he tell them where he hid John Ross. A scuffle breaks out between J.R. and Nicholas, which results in Nicholas' being <b>thrown</b> <b>over</b> the balcony and killed. In response, Sue Ellen shoots J.R. three times; however, he lives and neither she nor J.R. is indicted for any crimes.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the live}} {{pay-per-view}} broadcast, Buck Quartermaine defeated The Brooklyn Brawler {{in a dark}} match. In the first televised match, Razor Ramon defended his WWF Intercontinental Championship against Jeff Jarrett, who was accompanied by The Roadie. Ramon used his strength to dominate {{the opening of the}} match. Jarrett gained the momentum with a series of dropkicks and then choked Ramon with a sleeper hold. Ramon ran at Jarrett but was <b>thrown</b> <b>over</b> the top rope. He hit his knee when he landed, and The Roadie then hit Ramon from behind in the knee. Ramon was unable to return to the ring, so Jarrett was awarded the match via countout. Because the championship cannot change hands on a countout, Jarrett challenged Ramon to continue the match. Ramon agreed and nearly pinned Jarrett twice. Jarrett applied the figure four leglock to apply pressure to Ramon's injured knee. Ramon escaped the hold and attempted to perform the Razor's Edge. He collapsed under Jarrett's weight, however, and Jarrett pinned him to win the title.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} of the broadcast, the Royal Rumble match, came next. For the first time, a {{stipulation}} was added that {{the winner of the}} match would receive a match for the WWF Championship at that year's WrestleMania (a provision that has remained since). The match began with two former WWF Champions, as Ric Flair and Bob Backlund entered the ring first. Every two minutes, one of the remaining twenty-eight contestants entered the match according to the number they drew prior to the event. Papa Shango was the third wrestler to enter but was <b>thrown</b> <b>over</b> the top rope and onto the arena floor by Ric Flair, causing Shango to be eliminated. Virgil entered sixth and immediately attacked Ted DiBiase because of their long-standing grudge. When Mr. Perfect entered in the number ten spot, he and Flair fought each other until Perfect eliminated Flair by performing a clothesline to knock Flair onto the floor. Virgil was eliminated by The Berzerker, while Perfect was thrown out of the ring by Jerry Lawler, Koko B. Ware, and Ted DiBiase.|$|E

5|$|The mutiny was memorialized {{most famously}} by Sergei Eisenstein in his 1925 silent film Battleship Potemkin, {{although}} the French silent film La RÃ©volution en Russe (Mutiny on a Man-of-War in Odessa or Revolution in Odessa, 1905), directed by Ferdinand Zecca or Lucien Nonguet (or both), {{was the first}} film to depict the mutiny, preceding Eisenstein's far more famous film by 20 years. Filmed shortly after the Bolshevik victory in the Russian Civil War of 1917â22, with the derelict battleship Dvenadsat Apostolov standing in for the broken-up Potemkin, Eisenstein recast the mutiny into a predecessor of the October Revolution of 1917 that swept the Bolsheviks to power. He emphasized their role, and implied that the mutiny failed because Matushenko and the other leaders were not better Bolsheviks. Eisenstein made other changes to dramatize the story, ignoring the major fire that swept through Odessa's dock area while Potemkin was anchored there, combining the many different incidents of rioters and soldiers fighting into a famous sequence on the steps (today known as Potemkin Stairs), and showing a tarpaulin <b>thrown</b> <b>over</b> the sailors to be executed.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{the one and}} a {{half months}} after the start of ground tests, HB1001, the first of two demonstrators, {{underwent}} tests in preparations for the first flight. Flight instrumentation was checked first, followed by a thorough shakedown of the aircraft. In early November, two semi-trailers were parked parallel to each other outside Building 82; a camouflage net was <b>thrown</b> <b>over</b> the top to cover the demonstrator during outdoor engine runs. During the engine tests, a local resident complained about the noise, but Have Blue retained its secrecy. HB1001 received a layer of iron-coat paint; during the weekend of 12â13 November, the aircraft received a camouflage scheme devised by Alan Brown, Have Blues chief technical engineer. The scheme, consisting of three colors, each with three tones, was used to deceive any casual onlooker from recognizing the design's characteristic faceting. The aircraft was disassembled and loaded onto a C-5â on 16November, the aircraft was flown from Burbank Airport (since renamed Bob Hope Airport) to Area 51 at Groom Lake, Nevada. Upon touchdown, the aircraft was reassembled before undergoing another round of testing prior to the first flight. After four taxi tests, HB1001 was ready for test flights.|$|E
5|$|Toward 12:30 pm Lannes {{moved the}} rest of his force to face Gottesheim in a hook shape, while Kaim {{attacked}} again, but this time against Victorâs wings. A LaufbrÃ¼cke (small bridge) was <b>thrown</b> <b>over</b> the Fontanone and supported by reserve artillery. GM Christoph von Lattermanâs grenadiers crossed to engage Olivier Macoux Rivaud de la RaffiniÃ¨reâs two demibrigades defending Marengo village, while Bellegarde and Frimontâs four squadrons split Watrin off. Although Rivaud retook the village, OâReilly had taken Stortiglione by 2:00 pm, and in the north, Ott prepared to send FML Joseph von Schellenbergâs column to support Gottesheim. After securing the Fontanone bridge, Pilattiâs cavalry crossed but were again charged and defeated by Kellermann. However, Victor could no longer hold his positions and withdrew southeast to the main vine belt (grape vines slung among mulberry trees), Lannes mirroring the move. The Marengo farm garrison was abandoned and at around 2:30 pm Melas led two cavalry squadrons to capture them.|$|E
