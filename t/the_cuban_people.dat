5|$|Castro became {{critical}} of the corruption and violence of Grau's regime, delivering a public speech on the subject in November 1946 that earned him {{a place on the}} front page of several newspapers. In contact with members of student leftist groups – including the Popular Socialist Party (Partido Socialista Popular – PSP), the Socialist Revolutionary Movement (Movimiento Socialista Revolucionaria – MSR) and the Insurrectional Revolutionary Union (Unión Insurrecional Revolucionaria – UIR) – he grew close to the UIR, although biographers are unsure whether he became a member. In 1947, Castro joined a new socialist group, the Party of <b>the</b> <b>Cuban</b> <b>People</b> (Partido Ortodoxo), founded by veteran politician Eduardo Chibás (1907–1951).

Though Chibás lost the election, Castro remained committed to working on his behalf. Student violence escalated after Grau employed gang leaders as police officers, and Castro soon received a death threat urging him to leave the university; he refused and began carrying a gun and surrounding himself with armed friends. In later years Castro was accused of attempting gang-related assassinations during this period, including that of UIR member Lionel Gómez, MSR leader Manolo Castro and university policeman Oscar Fernandez, but these charges remain unproven.|$|E

25|$|Rather than {{endorsing}} Batista's hand-picked successor Carlos Zayas, <b>the</b> <b>Cuban</b> <b>people</b> elected Ramón Grau San Martín in 1944. A populist physician, who had briefly {{held the}} presidency in the 1933 revolutionary process, Grau {{made a deal with}} labor unions to continue Batista's pro-labor policies. Grau's administration coincided with the end of World War II, and he presided over an economic boom as sugar production expanded and prices rose. He instituted programs of public works and school construction, increasing social security benefits and encouraging economic development and agricultural production. However, increased prosperity brought increased corruption, with nepotism and favoritism flourishing in the political establishment, and urban violence, a legacy of the early 1930s, reappearing on a large scale. The country was also steadily gaining a reputation as a base for organized crime, with the Havana Conference of 1946 seeing leading Mafia mobsters descend upon the city.|$|E

25|$|Operation Mongoose {{consisted}} of a program of covert action, including sabotage, psychological warfare, intelligence collection, {{and the creation of}} an internal revolution against the communist government. The U.S. still lacked the capability of effectively getting information to the majority of <b>the</b> <b>Cuban</b> <b>people.</b> They had a trade embargo, denial of bunkering facilities, increased port security, and control procedure on transshipment, technical data, and customs inspection. The U.S. also used diplomatic means to frustrate Cuban trade negotiations in Israel, Jordan, Iran, Greece, and possibly Japan. From the outset, Lansdale and fellow members of the SG-A identified internal support for an anti-Castro movement {{to be the most important}} aspect of the operation. American organization and support for anti-Castro forces in Cuba was seen as key, which expanded American involvement from what had mostly been economic and military assistance of rebel forces. Therefore, Lansdale hoped to organize an effort within the operation, led by the CIA, to covertly build support for a popular movement within Cuba. This was a major challenge. It was difficult to identify anti-Castro forces within Cuba and there lacked a groundswell of popular support that Cuban insurgents could tap into. Within the first few months, an internal review of Operation Mongoose cited the CIA's limited capabilities to gather hard intelligence and conduct covert operations in Cuba. By January 1962, the CIA had failed to recruit suitable Cuban operatives that could infiltrate the Castro regime. The CIA and Lansdale estimated that they required 30 Cuban operatives. Lansdale criticized the CIA effort to ramp up their activities to meet Operation Mongoose's expedient timelines. Robert McCone of the CIA complained that Lansdale's timeline was too accelerated and that it would be difficult to achieve the tasks demanded in such a short timeframe.|$|E

50|$|After {{appointing}} himself {{president of}} the National Institute of Agrarian Reform (Instituto Nacional de Reforma Agraria - INRA), on 17 May 1959, Castro signed into law the First Agrarian Reform, limiting landholdings to 993 acre per owner. He additionally forbade further foreign land-ownership. Large land-holdings were broken up and redistributed; an estimated 200,000 peasants received title deeds. To Castro, this was an important step that broke {{the control of the}} well-off landowning class over Cuba’s agriculture. Though popular among the working class, it alienated many middle-class supporters. Castro appointed himself {{president of the}} National Tourist Industry as well. He introduced unsuccessful measures to encourage African-American tourists to visit, advertising it as a tropical paradise free of racial discrimination. Changes to state wages were implemented; judges and politicians had their pay reduced while low-level civil servants saw theirs raised. In March 1959, Castro ordered rents for those who paid less than $100 a month halved, with measures implemented to increase <b>the</b> <b>Cuban</b> <b>people’s</b> purchasing powers. Productivity decreased, and the country’s financial reserves were drained within only two years.|$|R

For him “Cuba is {{the discovery of a}} single application of a socialist concept, but <b>the</b> <b>Cubans,</b> remarkable <b>people,</b> don’t deserve what they were to endure afterwards”. He is rebelling constantly against l’embargo (called blocus in Cuba) that U.S.A. established in years 1962, and still applied.|$|R
500|$|Following his retirement, Castro's health deteriorated; {{international}} press {{speculated that}} he had diverticulitis, but Cuba's government refused to corroborate this. He continued to interact with <b>the</b> <b>Cuban</b> <b>people,</b> published an opinion column titled [...] "Reflections" [...] in Granma, used a Twitter account, and gave occasional public lectures. In January 2009 Castro asked Cubans {{not to worry about}} his lack of recent news columns and failing health, and not to be disturbed by his future death. He continued meeting foreign leaders and dignitaries, and that month photographs were released of Castro's meeting with Argentine President Cristina Fernández.|$|E
500|$|The {{concert was}} {{suggested}} by lawyer Gregory Elias to Rolling Stones manager Joyce Smyth during {{a phone call}} on 13 November 2015. Elias suggested that the Stones play a free concert in Cuba, which he would {{cover the costs of}} - to which Smyth responded [...] "Well,that’scertainly a unique proposal". The concert was bankrolled by Elias' charitable organization, Fundashon Bon Intenshon. There was some speculation that the move on Elias' part was politically motivated, to which he responded in a statement that he only wanted to do something good for <b>the</b> <b>Cuban</b> <b>people</b> and did not have any business relations in the country.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, the {{doctrine}} of Manifest Destiny had become increasingly sectionalized as the decade progressed. While there were still Northerners who believed the United States should dominate the continent, most were opposed to Cuba's annexation, particularly as a slave state. Southern-backed filibusters, including Narciso López, had failed repeatedly since 1849 to 1851 to overthrow the colonial government despite considerable support among <b>the</b> <b>Cuban</b> <b>people</b> for independence, {{and a series of}} reforms on the island made Southerners apprehensive that slavery would be abolished. They believed that Cuba would be [...] "Africanized," [...] as {{the majority of the population}} were slaves, and they had seen the Republic of Haiti established by former slaves. The notion of a pro-slavery invasion by the U.S. was rejected in light of the controversy over the Kansas–Nebraska Act. During internal discussions, supporters of gaining Cuba decided that a purchase or intervention in the name of national security was the most acceptable method of acquisition.|$|E
