5|$|The Assemblies of God has {{roots in}} the Pentecostal revival in the early 20th century. The Pentecostal aspects of the revival were not {{generally}} welcomed by the established churches, and participants in the movement soon found themselves outside existing religious bodies. They were forced to seek their own places of worship, and soon <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> distinctly Pentecostal congregations.|$|E
5|$|Over land, the {{hurricane}} weakened to a tropical storm, although it re-intensified {{slightly in the}} Gulf of Mexico. On September25, it made a second landfall just south of Tampico, Tamaulipas with winds at around , and it quickly dissipated over land. Damage was heaviest there, estimated at $5million (1933USD) and <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> deaths. About 75% of the houses in Tampico were damaged, including about 50% of houses that had severe to total destruction to their roofs.

5|$|The oligarch {{theory of}} planet {{formation}} states that <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> planet-sized objects, known as oligarchs, {{in the early}} stages of the Solar System's evolution. In 2005, astronomer Eugene Chiang speculated that although some of these oligarchs became the planets we know today, most would have been flung outward by gravitational interactions. Some may have escaped the Solar System altogether to become free-floating planets, whereas others would be orbiting in a halo around the Solar System, with orbital periods of millions of years. This halo would lie at between 1,000 and 10,000AU from the Sun, or between a third and a thirtieth the distance to the Oort cloud.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the effects}} of the Livonian Crusade in the Baltic was the {{introduction}} of stone and brick fortifications. Although <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> wooden castles in Prussia and Livonia, the use of bricks and mortar was unknown in the region before the Crusaders. Until the 13th century and start of the 14th centuries, their design was heterogeneous, however this period saw the emergence of a standard plan in the region: a square plan, with four wings around a central courtyard. It was common for castles in the East to have arrowslits in the curtain wall at multiple levels; contemporary builders in Europe were wary of this as they believed it weakened the wall. Arrowslits did not compromise the wall's strength, but it was not until Edward I's programme of castle building that they were widely adopted in Europe.|$|E
5|$|There {{were over}} 1,000underground newspapers; {{among the most}} {{important}} were the Biuletyn Informacyjny of Armia Krajowa and Rzeczpospolita of the Government Delegation for Poland.

The highest recorded publication volume was an issue of Biuletyn Informacyjny printed in 43,000copies; average volume of larger publication was 1,000–5,000copies. The Polish underground also published booklets and leaflets from imaginary anti-Nazi German organizations aimed at spreading disinformation and lowering morale among the Germans. Books were also sometimes printed. Other items were also printed, such as patriotic posters or fake German administration posters, ordering the Germans to evacuate Poland or telling Poles to register household cats.|$|E

25|$|Throughout his text, Defoe/Johnson {{describes}} the punishments meted out on captured pirates.

Most of the existing larger building societies are the end result of the mergers of many smaller societies.|$|E
