It focuses on individual factors, which influence the formation of communication, and describes the communication-governing principles in the organizations. Herein, the internal firm communication is regarded in terms of the modern approach to the human resources management, which emphasizes the need of intensive <b>two-way</b> <b>simultaneous</b> <b>communication</b> both between the personnel and the management and also among the co-workers. This thesis underlines the significance of the communication for the processes proceeding at the organization and indicates continuity of the efficient communication functioning and the organization's success...|$|E

40|$|We {{introduce}} a new concept, which we call partition expanders. The basic idea is to study quantitative properties of graphs {{in a slightly different}} way {{than it is in the}} standard definition of expanders. While in the definition of expanders it is required that the number of edges between any pair of sufficiently large sets is close to the expected number, we consider partitions and require this condition only for most of the pairs of blocks. As a result, the blocks can be substantially smaller. We show that for some range of parameters, to be a partition expander a random graph needs exponentially smaller degree than any expander would require in order to achieve similar expanding properties. We apply the concept of partition expanders in communication complexity. First, we give a PRG for the SMP model of the optimal seed length, n+O(log k). Second, we compare the model of SMP to that of <b>Simultaneous</b> <b>Two-Way</b> <b>Communication,</b> and give a new separation that is stronger both qualitatively and quantitatively than the previously known ones...|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to evaluate the potential of <b>simultaneous</b> <b>communication</b> (sign and speech together) to support classroom learning by college students who use cochlear implants (CIs). Metacognitive awareness of learning also was evaluated. A within-subjects design involving 40 implant users indicated that the student participants learned significantly more when material was presented via <b>simultaneous</b> <b>communication</b> than spoken language overall, but a statistical interaction indicated that the difference held only with more difficult material. Learning in the speech-only condition was positively related to the students' spoken language skills, their confidence with spoken language, and their receptive <b>simultaneous</b> <b>communication</b> skills. Learning in that condition was negatively related to the age at which the participants learned to sign. Findings were interpreted to indicate that <b>simultaneous</b> <b>communication</b> can be beneficial for classroom learning by college students with CIs, at least with more complex material or when information redundancy is otherwise important.

We analyze the amount of <b>simultaneous</b> <b>communication</b> required for achieving an approximately efficient allocation. In particular, we consider two settings: combinatorial auctions with unit demand bidders (bipartite matching) and combinatorial auctions with subadditive bidders. For both settings we first show that non-interactive systems have enormous communication costs relative to interactive ones. On the other hand, we show that limited interaction enables us to find approximately efficient allocations...|$|R

Under <b>simultaneous</b> <b>communication,</b> all equilibria are shown to be partition equilibria, and the partitions of the two agents are intimately related: the interior partition points of the two agents have an alternating structure. In the most informative equilibrium, the agent with a smaller bias always has the sure option/veto power to determine which alternative is implemented and weakly more messages. <b>Simultaneous</b> <b>communication,</b> sequential communication and simple delegation are essentially all outcome equivalent.

40|$|Objectives: This study {{sought to}} {{evaluate}} the potential of using spoken language and signing together (<b>simultaneous</b> <b>communication,</b> SimCom, sign-supported speech) {{as a means of}} improving speech recognition, comprehension, and learning by cochlear implant (CI) users in noisy contexts. Methods: Forty eight college students who were active CI users, watched videos of three short presentations, the text versions of which were standardized at the 8 th-grade reading level. One passage was presented in spoken language only, one was presented in spoken language with multi-talker babble background noise, and one was presented via <b>simultaneous</b> <b>communication</b> with the same background noise. Following each passage, participants responded to 10 (standardized) open-ended questions designed to assess comprehension. Indicators of participants' spoken language and sign language skills were obtained via self-reports and objective assessments. Results: When spoken materials were accompanied by signs, scores were significantly higher than when materials were spoken in noise without signs. Participants' receptive spoken language skills significantly predicted scores in all three conditions; neither their receptive sign skills nor age of implantation predicted performance. Discussion: Students who are CI users typically rely solely on spoken language in the classroom. The present results, however, suggest that there are potential benefits of <b>simultaneous</b> <b>communication</b> for such learners in noisy settings. For those CI users who know sign language, the redundancy of speech and signs potentially can offset the reduced fidelity of spoken language in noise. Conclusion: Accompanying spoken language with signs can benefit learners who are CI users in noisy situations such as classroom settings. Factors associated with such benefits, such as receptive skills in signed and spoken modalities, classroom acoustics, and material difficulty need to be empirically examined...|$|R
