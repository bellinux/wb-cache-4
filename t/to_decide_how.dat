5|$|One {{criticism}} of the practice holds that the manager has enough to be preoccupied with during a game without playing. With specialized bullpens, extensive scouting reports, and increased media scrutiny, {{the job of a}} manager has become more complex. A player–manager needs <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> <b>how</b> much playing time to give himself. Don Kessinger, player–manager of the Chicago White Sox in 1979, believes he did not play himself enough. Additionally, Bill Terry felt he became isolated from his team when he became a player–manager.|$|E

As they try <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> <b>how</b> to deal with their hostage, they learn that Hardenberg was a radical himself during the 1960s. A leader of the Socialist German Student Union, he was a good friend of Rudi Dutschke before marrying, getting a good job and abandoning his ideals.|$|E
5|$|Bughouse can {{be played}} with three or more boards. The game is played {{in exactly the same}} way as normal bughouse with boards placed with {{alternating}} colours and two players and one clock per board. On capturing a piece however, the player has to decide which player of the team will get that piece. In three board bughouse chess the middle player is the key since he gets material from two boards, but has <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> <b>how</b> to divide the captured pieces. The middle board also commonly becomes very cramped due to having twice the number of pieces available.|$|E

When Hitler remonstrated, and said it was not for Speer <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> <b>how</b> his workers should be used, Speer simply ignored him. Among Speer's innovations were quick-reaction squads to construct roads or clear away debris; before long, these units would be used to clear bomb sites. As the war progressed, initially to great German success, Speer continued preliminary work on the Berlin and Nürnberg plans. Speer also oversaw the construction of buildings for the Wehrmacht and Luftwaffe.|$|E
5|$|The High Court {{agreed with}} the {{plaintiff}} that since the PSA had authority <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> <b>how</b> to allocate berths, it was also entrusted with the duty to exercise that discretion after taking various key factors into consideration, and would have acted unlawfully if it had abrogated its responsibility by taking orders from other public authorities such as the Gambling Suppression Branch or the Singapore Tourist Promotion Board unless it was under a statutory duty to do so. However, on {{the facts of the}} case, the decision to deny berths to the plaintiff's cruise ship had been taken by the PSA alone.|$|E
5|$|Illness forced Mason to absent {{himself from}} the Committee of Safety for several weeks in 1775, {{and he did not}} attend the fourth convention, held in December 1775 and January 1776. With {{independence}} from Britain widely accepted as necessary among prominent Virginians, the fifth convention, to meet in May 1776 at Williamsburg, would need <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> <b>how</b> Virginia would be administered henceforth, as the royal government was dead in all but name. Accordingly, the convention was seen as so important that Richard Henry Lee arranged for his temporary recall from Congress {{to be a part of}} the convention, and Jefferson tried but failed to arrange to leave Congress as well. Other notables elected to the convention were Henry, George Wythe, and a young delegate from Orange County, James Madison. Mason was elected for Fairfax County, though with great difficulty.|$|E

5|$|Returning to a {{previous}} setting offered the artists new {{challenges and opportunities}} to expand {{the scope of the}} city. Having the player walk through the streets at night inspired a film noir ambiance. Color shifts and a high degree of contrast pushed the game's look beyond what previous Halo games had offered, but the team had to make sure that even dark portions of the city were playable. The entire core development team looked at commissioned concept paintings <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> <b>how</b> lighting schemes would affect the gameplay. The genre also influenced the character names and archetypes. The player character, for example, fits the concept of a lone, hardboiled detective. To increase the depth of the surroundings, Bungie added touches such as advertisements, trash collectors, and civilian versions of previously seen military hardware.|$|E
5|$|His nephew and biographer (Ferdinand Brock Tupper) {{asserts that}} shortly after Brock joined the regiment, a {{professional}} dueller forced a match on him. As the one being challenged Brock had {{his choice of}} terms, and he insisted that they use pistols. His friends were shocked as Brock was a large target and his opponent an expert shot. Brock, however, refused to change his mind. When the duellist arrived at the field, he asked Brock <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> <b>how</b> many paces they would take. Brock insisted that the duel would take place not at the usual range, but at handkerchief distance (i.e., close range). The duellist declined and subsequently {{was forced to leave}} the regiment. This contributed to Brock's popularity and reputation among his fellow officers, as this duellist had a formidable reputation and was reportedly regarded as a bully in the regiment. During his time with this regiment, Brock served in the Caribbean, where he fell ill with fever and nearly died. He did not fully recover until after returning to England in 1793.|$|E
5|$|Okabe did {{not want}} to use {{traditional}} lyrics, as he felt they would clash with the design of the world in the game, and wanted to use a variety of languages to represent the open nature of the game's world. He also {{did not want}} easily recognizable lyrics to be sung in the background while the characters were speaking, and for any noticeable words to instead evoke emotions in the player. Evans only knew English, Japanese, and French when she began the project; she listened to the other languages on YouTube to learn the rhythms and sounds of the languages and then mixed and changed them. Okabe largely allowed Evans <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> <b>how</b> to integrate the lyrics with the early forms of the songs, and as he usually did not know where the songs would be used in the game gave her only light direction as to the emotional tone for the songs. The composers often would modify the songs in later revisions to follow how Evans had sung for that song.|$|E

Under the federal tax code 501(c)(4) the group will have tax-exempt status {{as long as it is}} not primarily involved in activity that could influence an election.

5|$|Sometimes criminals {{were beaten}} with the bastinado to gain confessions, but Han {{scholars}} argued that torture {{was not the}} best means of gaining confession, while court conferences were called into session <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> <b>how</b> many strokes should be given and what size the stick should be {{so as not to}} cause permanent injury. Imprisonment was an unheard of form of punishment during Han; common punishments were the death penalty by beheading, periods of forced hard labor for convicts, exile, or monetary fines. Mutilating punishments also existed in early Han, borrowed from previous practice in Qin. This included tattooing the face, cutting off the nose, castration, and amputation of one or both feet, yet by 167 BCE these were abolished in favor of lengthy floggings with the bastinado. Further reforms were implemented by the first year of Emperor Jing's (r. 154141 BCE) reign which decreased the amount of strokes a prisoner could receive from the bastinado. Starting in 195 BCE, those aged seventy and older were exempt from mutilating punishments. Further reforms exempted those aged seventy and older from harsh interrogation methods in cases other than false accusation and murder.|$|E
5|$|While {{watching}} a 1950s science fiction movie, Bart and Lisa see {{a commercial for}} a model rocket kit and Bart orders it by using Homer's credit card number. Homer helps Bart and Milhouse build it, but it blows up before launching. Jealous that Ned Flanders built a superior rocket, Homer enlists {{the help of his}} former nerdy college roommates, Gary, Doug, and Benjamin, to build a rocket piloted by the hamster Nibbles. The rocket lifts off successfully, but it develops complications and Nibbles bails out. However, Homer makes an attempt to shoot down the rocket with a 12 gauge shotgun, but the rocket crashes into the church. The church council meets up <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> <b>how</b> to come up with money to fund the repairs to the church, and with no other aid available they accept help from Mr. Burns and Lindsay Naegle who wish to run the church as a business.

25|$|In the United Kingdom, it {{has been}} {{suggested}} that if the court interprets a statute to impose a duty on a public authority, the resources available to the authority are irrelevant <b>to</b> <b>deciding</b> <b>how</b> the duty should be carried out.

Also, public authorities are not required to take into account people's fundamental rights arising under the Human Rights Act 1998 as relevant considerations before arriving at decisions. Their only responsibility is to ensure that the decision itself complies with the European Convention on Human Rights. At present, there are no Singapore cases on these issues.|$|R
