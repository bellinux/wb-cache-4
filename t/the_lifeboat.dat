5|$|Unwilling {{to leave}} the shipwrecked men at sea, but afraid of having his ship {{captured}} by the Germans, Centaurs master decided to take <b>the</b> <b>lifeboat</b> in tow, after allowing nine wounded men aboard. During the tow towards Carnarvon, Western Australia, <b>the</b> <b>lifeboat</b> was swamped and partially sunk by rough seas, so two of Centaurs lifeboats were lowered to carry the Germans. On arrival in Carnarvon, the Germans were relocated to the number one cargo hold, where {{they were joined by}} another hundred Kormoran survivors collected by other ships, plus forty Australian Army guards, which were then transported by Centaur to Fremantle.|$|E
5|$|A {{court of}} enquiry was held the {{following}} month in Liverpool by the Board of Trade, and focused particularly on {{the roles of the}} captains in the tragedy as well as the design of the Liverpool lifeboat. The court found that no-one was to blame for the loss of either Ellen Southard or the Liverpool lifeboat. Captain James Martin and his crew were praised for their gallantry in getting everyone off the ship, and absolved of any blame with respect to the capsizing of <b>the</b> <b>lifeboat.</b> <b>The</b> <b>lifeboat</b> was furthermore found to be of sound design and suitably adapted to her role, but debate continued for many years about the merits of the tubular design vs the self-righting one, as well as the requirement for lifeboats to be powered.|$|E

However, not much investigation has been done into the actual construction and equipment contained in <b>the</b> <b>lifeboats.</b> No known plans of <b>the</b> <b>lifeboats</b> exist. <b>The</b> reason may be that plans were not drawn for <b>the</b> <b>lifeboats.</b> Th...|$|R

25|$|As it did so, Topp {{directed}} his crewmen to continue firing, striking the Atwaters crewmen {{as they tried}} to man <b>the</b> <b>lifeboats.</b> When Captain Webster was hit, the crew abandoned attempts to launch <b>the</b> <b>lifeboats</b> and leapt into the sea.|$|R
5|$|In {{the early}} days of the service, {{lifeboat}} launch and recovery was usually undertaken by women. There were deeply-held views about women actually crewing the boats themselves – it was considered extremely bad luck. Along all parts part of the coastline, women supported their men on <b>the</b> <b>lifeboat</b> crews by working together to get <b>the</b> <b>lifeboat</b> afloat and then later recovering it from the water in readiness for when the next call came. While lifeboat crew are still predominantly male (92%), the first female (inshore) crew member was Elizabeth Hostvedt in 1969, and Frances Glody was the first woman crew member on an all-weather lifeboat, at Dunmore East Lifeboat Station, in 1981. Lauren McGuire, at the age of 27, became the RNLI's youngest station manager in 2011, at Clovelly, Devon.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Lifeboat</b> is the {{quarterly}} magazine for all members, containing {{regional and national}} news from the Institution, featured rescues, book reviews, lifeboat launch listings and an additional insert for Offshore members. The former Compass quarterly regional newsletter was discontinued in 2014, but back copies can be read on the RNLI website. Storm Force members have their own quarterly magazine.|$|E
5|$|The first Royal National Lifeboat {{was funded}} by the town of Cheltenham, and arrived in 1866. <b>The</b> <b>lifeboat</b> was removed in 1930 because of the {{difficulty}} in getting a full crew, and because the launching arrangements were not suitable for a powered boat. The current Burnham-on-Sea Lifeboat Station is the base for Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) search and rescue operations. The present station was opened in 2003. It operates two inshore lifeboats (ILBs), a B Class rigid-hulled boat and an inflatable D Class.|$|E
5000|$|On 6 June the British {{ocean liner}} [...] was {{attacked}} by U-151 about 400 {{miles east of the}} Bermudas. Twenty-two crewmen were lost, but the rest survived in <b>the</b> <b>lifeboats.</b> <b>The</b> U-boat remained in the area to use <b>the</b> <b>lifeboats</b> as bait for Allied ships. A few hours, later the auxiliary cruiser USS Von Steuben arrived and found <b>the</b> <b>lifeboats.</b> But before she reached, them a torpedo was spotted. Two guns opened fire, one on the incoming torpedo and the other on U-151s periscope. The cruiser also began evasive maneuvers and the torpedo missed her.|$|R
2500|$|... 1,512 {{people did}} not make it on to a {{lifeboat}} and were aboard Titanic when she sank {{to the bottom of the}} North Atlantic Ocean at 2:20a.m. on 15 April 1912. 712 people, mostly women and children, remained in <b>the</b> <b>lifeboats</b> until later that morning when they were rescued by RMS Carpathia. Those aboard <b>the</b> <b>lifeboats</b> were picked up by Carpathia over the course of 4 hours and 30 minutes, from about 4a.m. to 8:30a.m., and 13 of <b>the</b> <b>lifeboats</b> were also taken aboard. <b>The</b> <b>lifeboats</b> were returned to the White Star Line at New York Harbor, as they were the only items of value salvaged from the shipwreck, but subsequently vanished from history over time.|$|R

5|$|A monstrous, mutated Fifield {{returns to}} the Prometheus and kills several crew members before he is killed. The Prometheus captain, Janek, speculates that the {{structure}} was an Engineer military base that lost control of a virulent biological weapon, the dark liquid. He also determines that the structure houses a spacecraft. Weyland and a team return to the structure, accompanied by Shaw. David wakes the Engineer from stasis and speaks to him {{in an attempt to}} explain what Weyland wants. The Engineer responds by decapitating David and killing Weyland and his team, before reactivating the spacecraft. Shaw flees and warns Janek that the Engineer is planning to release the liquid on Earth, convincing him to stop the spacecraft. Janek and the remaining crew sacrifice themselves by ramming the Prometheus into the alien craft, ejecting <b>the</b> <b>lifeboat</b> in the process, while Vickers flees in an escape pod. The Engineer's disabled spacecraft crashes onto the ground, killing Vickers. Shaw goes to <b>the</b> <b>lifeboat</b> and finds her alien offspring is alive and has grown to gigantic size. David's still-active head warns Shaw that the Engineer is pursuing her. The Engineer forces open the lifeboat's airlock and attacks Shaw, who releases her alien offspring onto the Engineer; it thrusts an ovipositor down the Engineer's throat, subduing him. Shaw recovers David's remains, and with his help, launches another Engineer spacecraft. She intends to reach the Engineers' homeworld in an attempt to understand why they wanted to destroy humanity.|$|E
5|$|Despite this setback, the {{expedition}} continued with Wild in command while Hussey returned to England with Shackleton's body. On 22 January, Worsley suffered a serious accident. Under sail, the Quest had been rolling heavily and ropes securing a lifeboat snapped. <b>The</b> <b>lifeboat,</b> full of stores, swung against the wheelhouse and crushed Worsley against the bridge. He broke several ribs {{and had to}} rest for several days. By the end of March, after being briefly trapped in ice in the Weddell Sea, the ship reached Elephant Island. The expedition then returned to South Georgia, where Hussey was waiting. Shackleton's widow had directed that he be buried on South Georgia and Hussey {{had returned to the}} island in late February to fulfil her request.|$|E

5|$|In 1984, £1 {{million of}} damage was caused {{to the pier}} by {{drifting}} equipment during engineering work in Sand Bay, {{to the north of}} the pier. The damage was quickly repaired, despite fears that Birnbeck might become like nearby Clevedon Pier, which at the time was severed by a collapsed span. The pier was again badly damaged by storms in 1990 and was closed for safety reasons in 1994. Daily trips during the summer months to and from Cardiff, Clevedon, and Penarth were suspended indefinitely. Due to the decline, English Heritage has placed it on the Heritage at Risk register. In 1999, <b>the</b> <b>lifeboat</b> station installed a walkway across the pier to allow them safe access to the island, at a cost of £20,000.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to safety advice given in its publications, the RNLI offers safety advice to boat and beach users {{when the opportunity}} arises, and to at-risk groups such as anglers, divers and kayakers. The Institution runs sea and beach safety sessions for young people, particularly in inner-city areas; more than 6,000 children a week are spoken to by education volunteers about sea and beach safety, and over 800 children a week receive training. 500 children were taught to swim in 2014. In {{an effort to reduce}} the estimated 400,000 drownings a year worldwide, {{more than half of them}} children, the RNLI extends practical or strategic safety advice to lifesaver organisations overseas, in some cases providing training at <b>the</b> <b>Lifeboat</b> College.|$|E
5|$|In {{the centre}} of the town lies Weymouth Harbour; {{although}} it was the reason for the town's foundation, the harbour separates the two areas of Melcombe Regis (the main town centre) and Weymouth (the southern harbourside) from each other. Since the 18th century they have been linked by successive bridges over the narrowest part of the harbour. The present Town Bridge, built in 1930, is a lifting bascule bridge allowing boats to access the inner harbour. The Royal National Lifeboat Institution stationed a lifeboat at Weymouth {{for the first time on}} 26 January 1869. A boathouse was built with a slipway by the harbour and is still in use, although <b>the</b> <b>lifeboat</b> is now moored at a pontoon.|$|E
25|$|This {{stability}} issue {{became a}} focus of the investigation after the sinking, {{as it was a}} factor in both the capsizing and the crew's inability to lower <b>the</b> port-side <b>lifeboats.</b> <b>The</b> bulkheads of the watertight compartments extended only {{up to the top of}} A Deck, and a list greater than 20° allowed water from a flooded watertight compartment to pass over its top into adjacent compartments. In addition, the design parameters allowed the lowering of <b>the</b> <b>lifeboats</b> at a maximum 15° list. Beyond this, up to half of <b>the</b> <b>lifeboats</b> could not be deployed.|$|R
25|$|Lusitanias severe {{starboard}} list {{complicated the}} launch of her lifeboats. Ten minutes after the torpedoing, when she had slowed enough to start putting boats in <b>the</b> water, <b>the</b> <b>lifeboats</b> on <b>the</b> starboard side swung out too far to step aboard safely. While it was still possible to board <b>the</b> <b>lifeboats</b> on <b>the</b> port side, lowering them presented a different problem. As was typical for the period, the hull plates of Lusitania were riveted, and as <b>the</b> <b>lifeboats</b> were lowered they dragged on the inch high rivets, which threatened to seriously damage the boats before they landed in the water.|$|R

5|$|Sir William Hillary {{moved to}} the Isle of Man in 1808. Being aware of the treacherous nature of the Irish Sea, with many ships being wrecked around the Manx coast, he drew up plans for a {{national}} lifeboat service manned by trained crews. Initially he received little response from the Admiralty. However, on appealing to the more philanthropic members of London society, the plans were adopted and, {{with the help of}} Member of Parliament Thomas Wilson and former MP and merchant George Hibbert, the National Institution for the Preservation of Life from Shipwreck was founded in 1824. At the age of 60, Sir William took part in the 1830 rescue of the packet St George, which had foundered on Conister Rock at the entrance to Douglas Harbour. He commanded <b>the</b> <b>lifeboat</b> and was washed overboard with others of <b>the</b> <b>lifeboat</b> crew, yet finally everyone aboard the St George was rescued with no loss of life. It was this incident which prompted Sir William to set up a scheme to build The Tower of Refuge on Conister Rock – a project completed in 1832 which stands to this day at the entrance to Douglas Harbour. In 1854 the institution's name changed to the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (in 1849 Prince Albert had added his support to the Institution) and the first of the new lifeboats to be built was stationed at Douglas in recognition of the work of Sir William.|$|E
5|$|The {{ship was}} built at Sir W. G. Armstrong, Whitworth & Co., Ltd on Tyneside. She was laid down on 2 April 1906, and {{launched}} at 3 p.m. on 13 April 1907 by Lady Allendale. On 28 December 1907, while still fitting out, she {{was hit by}} the collier Oden, {{which resulted in the}} buckling of beams and frames in the hull and five bottom plates being stove in. She was officially completed on 16 March 1909. On 18 March, she sailed from the Tyne to Portsmouth, where she would be commissioned. On the way, she collided with the brigantine Mary Ann, and stood by until <b>the</b> <b>lifeboat</b> John Birch arrived from Yarmouth to take the brigantine in tow.|$|E
5|$|With Canadian {{industry}} reorganized {{to supply}} the British war effort, Howe decided he needed to journey to Britain to discuss matters with the customers. He embarked on the S.S. Western Prince in December 1940. This was an intensely dangerous trip; Germany was attempting to blockade Britain {{and there were many}} German submarines in the North Atlantic. One of those submarines sank the Western Prince on 14 December. Howe survived the sinking and eight hours in a lifeboat. Gordon Scott, his aide, was killed trying to climb from <b>the</b> <b>lifeboat</b> to the rescuing ship. Howe professed coolness in the incident, but later told the Manchester Guardian that he considered every hour that he lived from that day onwards to be borrowed time.|$|E

Later, Vickers Warwick bombers carried <b>the</b> Mark II <b>lifeboat.</b> <b>The</b> Fox boats successfully saved downed aircrew as well as glider infantrymen dropped in the water during Operation Market-Garden. <b>The</b> <b>lifeboats</b> carried emergency equipment, a radio, waterproof suits, rations and medical supplies.|$|R
5|$|Aboard the ship, {{passenger}} John Geiger hacks {{into the}} ship's computer system, {{and the following}} evening, he destroys the ship's communication systems and kills the captain. After remotely shutting down the ship's engines, Geiger calls the bridge to tell the first officer, Juliano, that the captain is dead and he is in charge. Juliano is ordered by Geiger to evacuate the ship. Geiger steals jewelry from the ship's vault. As passengers evacuate, Drew, a young deaf girl, becomes trapped in an elevator, {{and a group of}} people become trapped behind locked fire doors in a hallway filling with smoke. As Annie and Alex attempt to board the last lifeboat, Geiger programs the ship to continue sailing. The winch lowering <b>the</b> <b>lifeboat</b> jams. Alex jumps into the boat to rescue the passengers who are falling off, and Annie and Juliano use the ship's gangplank to get them back on deck.|$|E
5|$|General Lucius Fairchild, the United States consul at Liverpool, {{wrote to}} his {{government}} recommending that the gallantry of the Englishmen {{who were involved in}} the rescue effort be recognised. The Secretary of State supported his recommendation and the United States Congress moved to award the newly instituted Lifesaving Medal to <b>the</b> <b>lifeboat</b> men. However, a delay of 17 months followed during which a change in legislation had to be enacted to allow the medals to be issued to non-US nationals. Finally in 1877, the United States government awarded first-class Gold Lifesaving Medals to the twenty-seven men of the Mersey Docks and New Brighton RNLI lifeboat station who survived the incident, while the families of the three deceased lifeboat men were awarded a sum of $200.00 in gold in lieu of a medal. The medals were conferred in a public ceremony in Liverpool Town Hall on 27 February 1877.|$|E

Mainer {{performed with}} The Mountaineers on tracks such as Maple on the Hill, Seven and a Half and Johnson's Old Grey Mule. Also {{included on the}} compilation are Mainer's later collaboration Short Life and It's Trouble with Zeke Morris, his solo effort Riding on That Train 45 and a sample song Mitchell Blues from his band the Sons of the Mountaineers. Throughout his career, he was noted for his unique and innovative two-finger banjo fingerpicking style, which some view as a precursor to three finger bluegrass banjo styles. Mainer took jobs at local radio stations to increase the visibility of his relative's ensemble, recording classics such as Take Me in <b>the</b> <b>Lifeboat.</b> During this time, he appeared on many regional stations including WBT in Charlotte, WPTF in Raleigh, WNOX in Knoxville and WPAQ in Mount Airy.|$|E
