40|$|In {{this paper}} {{the effect of}} slope of the fluid bed with respect to various other fluid {{parameters}} such as visco elasticity, porosity, frequency of excitation and time on the behaviour of skin friction has been analyzed. When the angle of inclination is held constant and when 45 t ≥, it is noticed that, <b>the</b> skin <b>friction</b> increases and when 45 t < a reverse trend is observed. Also, when the frequency of excitation increases, <b>the</b> skin <b>friction</b> increases and when 25 σ ≤, the effect {{is found to be}} in the opposite direction. An interesting phenomenon is that, when the angle of inclination is increased, <b>the</b> skin <b>friction</b> remains constant till 045 α = and thereafter it decreases. Also, irrespective of the visco elasticity of the fluid, <b>the</b> skin <b>friction</b> increases linearly with respect to the angle of inclination of the plate.

5|$|Returning to Danes Island in {{the summer}} of 1897, the {{expedition}} found that the balloon hangar built the year before had weathered the winter storms well. The winds were more favorable, too. Andrée had strengthened his leadership by replacing the older and critical Ekholm, an authority in his field, with the 27-year-old enthusiast Knut Frænkel. On July 11, in a steady wind from the south-west, the top of the plank hangar was dismantled, the three explorers climbed into the already heavy basket, and Andrée dictated one last-minute telegram to King Oscar and another to the paper Aftonbladet, holder of press rights to the expedition. The large support team cut away the last ropes holding the balloon and it rose slowly. Moving out low over the water, it was pulled so far down by <b>the</b> <b>friction</b> of the several-hundred-meter-long drag ropes against the ground as to dip the basket into the water. <b>The</b> <b>friction</b> also twisted the ropes round, detaching them from their screw holds. These holds were a new safety feature that Andrée had reluctantly been persuaded to add, whereby ropes that got caught on the ground could be more easily dropped.|$|E

5|$|By the 16th century Ethiopian works {{began to}} discuss the {{profound}} impact of foreign peoples in their own regional history.

With the persuasion of Jesuits in his realm, emperor Susenyos I (r. 1607–1632) became the only Ethiopian ruler to convert from Orthodox Christianity to Catholicism, perhaps earlier than the accepted date of 1625, after which his attempts to convert his subjects and undermine the Orthodox church led to internal revolts. In 1593 the Ethiopian monk, historian, and ethnographer Bahrey published a work of ethnography that provided reasoning for the military success of the polytheistic Oromo people who fought against the Ethiopian Empire. Ethiopian histories of this period also included details of foreign Muslims, Jews, Christians (including those from Western Europe), Safavid Iranians, and even figures of the fallen Byzantine Empire.|$|E
5|$|Owing to {{the present}} state of {{continental}} drift, the Northern Hemisphere is now fairly equally divided between land and sea (a ratio of about 2:3) but the South is overwhelmingly oceanic (1:4.7). Salinity in the open ocean is generally in a narrow band around 3.5% by mass, although this can vary in more landlocked waters, near the mouths of large rivers, or at great depths. About 85% of the solids in the open sea are sodium chloride. Deep-sea currents are produced by differences in salinity and temperature. Surface currents are formed by <b>the</b> <b>friction</b> of waves produced by the wind and by tides, the changes in local sea level produced by the gravity of the Moon and Sun.

5|$|The surface {{friction}} tester {{is a small}} {{fifth wheel}} attached to a hydraulic system mounted on the rear axle of the vehicle, used to measure road slipperiness. The wheel, allowed to roll freely, is slightly turned relative to the ground so that it partially slides. Sensors attached to the axis of the wheel calculate <b>the</b> <b>friction</b> between the wheel and the pavement by measuring the torque produced by {{the rotation of the}} wheel. Surface friction testers are used at airports and on major roadways before ice formation or after snow removal. The vehicle can relay the surface friction data back to the control centre, allowing gritting and clearing to be planned so that the vehicles are deployed most efficiently. Surface friction testers often include a water spraying system, to simulate the effects of rain on the road surface before the rain occurs. The sensors are usually mounted to small compact or estate cars or to a small trailer, rather than the large trucks used for other winter service equipment, as the surface friction tester works best when attached to a lightweight vehicle.|$|E
5|$|During {{a couple}} of the Svea flights, Andrée tested and tried out the drag-rope {{steering}} technique which he had developed and wanted to use on his projected North Pole expedition. Drag ropes, which hang from the balloon basket and drag part of their length on the ground, are designed to counteract the tendency of lighter-than-air craft to travel at the same speed as the wind, a situation that makes steering by sails impossible. <b>The</b> <b>friction</b> of the ropes was intended to slow the balloon {{to the point where the}} sails would have an effect (beyond that of making the balloon rotate on its axis). Andrée reported, and presumably believed, that with drag rope/sails steering he had succeeded in deviating about ten degrees either way from the wind direction. This notion is rejected by modern balloonists; the Swedish Ballooning Association maintains that Andrée's belief that he had deviated from the wind was mistaken, being misled by inexpertise and a surfeit of enthusiasm in an environment of variable winds and poor visibility. Use of drag ropes (prone to snapping, falling off, or becoming entangled with each other or the ground, in addition to being ineffective) is not considered by any modern expert to be a useful steering technique.|$|E

5|$|Outflow {{became much}} better {{organized}} as Bertha became a tropical storm, and well-defined banding features persisted {{to the north}} of the storm. Though convection waned, forecasters predicted <b>the</b> <b>friction</b> between land and the warm atmosphere to redevelop more deep convection, potentially resulting in further strengthening. However, the storm failed to intensify, and Bertha made landfall near Boothville, Louisiana as a minimal tropical storm early on August 5. It slowly weakened over the swampy portions of southeastern Louisiana, and degenerated to a tropical depression later on the 5th after crossing Lake Ponchartrain. Initially it was expected that a ridge of high pressure to its north would keep Bertha moving to the west and result in it slowly dissipating. However, it turned to the southwest, and reached the Gulf of Mexico again on August 7. The circulation persisted over land, and Tropical Depression Bertha quickly redeveloped convection. Though the environment was not unfavorable, its proximity to land prevented re-strengthening to tropical storm status. Though the system showed periods of increased organization as it moved southwestward, Bertha remained a weak tropical depression until making landfall on south Texas to the east of Kingsville on August 9. Bertha weakened quickly over land, and dissipated over southern Texas ten hours after making landfall.|$|E
5|$|The meteoroid's {{absolute}} magnitude (the apparent magnitude {{it would have}} {{at an altitude of}} 100km at the observer's zenith) was approximately−6 and did not vary significantly during the few seconds of observation. It traveled a distance of 409km in 9.8seconds during the time it was observed. It moved at a speed of 41.74km per second, which did not change measurably during the flight. Jiří Borovička and Zdeněk Ceplecha from the Ondřejov Observatory in Czechoslovakia estimated that the deceleration caused by <b>the</b> <b>friction</b> of the atmosphere reached only 1.7m/s2 at the fireball's perigee (closest approach to Earth), and its velocity was reduced by only 0.012km per second (less than 0.03%). This corresponds well with computer simulations provided by D.W.Olson, R.L.Doescher and K.M. Watson at the Southwest Texas State University, who concluded that the deceleration was less than 0.5m/s2 except for a few seconds near perigee. This small loss of speed, 12m per second, corresponded to a loss of kinetic specific energy (in the earth's frame of reference) of 0.5 MJ/kg, which was converted to heat (and perhaps sound). The change in the object's velocity vector due to Earth's gravity during the hours it was in the earth's vicinity was on the order of kilometres per second (see Orbit).|$|E
