5|$|Also in 1957, Florida's {{response}} was mixed. Its legislature passed an Interposition Resolution denouncing {{the decision and}} declaring it null and void. But Florida Governor LeRoy Collins, though joining in the protest against the court decision, refused <b>to</b> <b>sign</b> <b>it,</b> arguing that the attempt to overturn the ruling must be done by legal methods.|$|E

5|$|Lewis and Audrey {{decide to}} go on holiday {{together}} and Lewis offers to pay for himself. Digital Spy's Daniel Kilkelly wrote that Lewis' renewed relationship with Audrey and their plans {{to go on a}} round-the-world cruise would cause a feud between her and David. Audrey's money is tied up in the salon, so she asks David <b>to</b> <b>sign</b> <b>it</b> back to her so she can pay for the holiday. However, David refuses to sign the salon back as he thinks Lewis might be planning another fraud. Kilkelly said Lewis tries to play peacemaker and suggests postponing the trip until he can save the money himself, but Audrey insists David will co-operate and she tears up their contract.|$|E
50|$|In 2015, it was {{revealed}} that Nightingale had been approached by the BBC <b>to</b> <b>sign</b> a letter warning Prime Minister David Cameron that his plans to reform the corporation would damage it. Nightingale, one of the letter's 29 signatories, revealed later on that she had not read the letter prior <b>to</b> <b>signing</b> <b>it.</b>|$|R
5|$|On January 9, 2017, Bevin signed two {{into law}} two bills restricting abortion, {{including}} one that banned abortions after the 20th week of pregnancy.

5|$|On November 21, 2006, Meader {{was awarded}} the title of honorary member of the American Geographical Society and was invited to sign her name on its Fliers' & Explorers' Globe. This {{was part of a}} {{tradition}} spanning back to the 1920s in which noted explorers are asked to place their signature on the Globe. Meader was the 79th to do so. Other signers of the globe include Charles Lindbergh, Amelia Earhart, Sir Edmund Hillary, Robert Peary, Richard Byrd, and the astronauts on Apollo 8. Meader was one of only three people <b>to</b> <b>sign</b> <b>it</b> twice; across East Africa and the Andes.|$|E
5|$|While in Congress, Ferraro focused {{much of her}} {{legislative}} {{attention on}} equity {{for women in the}} areas of wages, pensions, and retirement plans. She was a cosponsor of the 1981 Economic Equity Act. On the House Select Committee on Aging, she concentrated on the problems of elderly women. In 1984, she championed a pension equity law revision that would improve the benefits of people who left work for long periods and then returned, a typical case for women with families. The Reagan administration, at first lukewarm to the measure, decided <b>to</b> <b>sign</b> <b>it</b> to gain the benefits of its popular appeal.|$|E
5|$|Michael decides {{the workers}} are {{stressed}} because they are reluctant to express their feelings, so he organizes a comedic roast of himself in the warehouse. Dwight tricks most of the employees into signing his apology letter by pretending it is a sign-in sheet, but Phyllis (Phyllis Smith) catches on and refuses <b>to</b> <b>sign</b> <b>it.</b> Each {{of the office and}} warehouse workers gleefully take jabs at Michael, who initially seems to enjoy the jokes, but grows increasingly uncomfortable and offended. When it comes time for him to roast his employees, Michael ends up storming out of the warehouse, visibly upset. After the roast, Michael takes a personal day (much to the concern of his employees, who start to feel bad about the scathing jokes towards Michael) and spends time at a playground to reflect, feeding pigeons by tossing whole slices of bread on the ground and making bird noises, despite the lack of birds in the winter weather. Dwight tricks Phyllis into signing his apology letter by bribing a mailman to ask her to sign for a fake package. Michael returns to the office, where he roasts each of his co-workers with one-liners. Stanley laughs heartily when Michael roasts him, breaking the tension. Michael tells his employees that they are the reason he got into the paper business, and they applaud him.|$|E

5|$|The {{report found}} that the {{tendency}} of the evidence presented in the programme was to suggest the terrorists had been unlawfully killed, and {{that it did not}} explore alternative explanations in any depth. Nevertheless, Windlesham and Rampton believed that the programme presented evidence for one possible explanation, but sought to raise questions rather than reach a conclusion. In analysing the content of the programme, they found that it allowed the witnesses to give their accounts in their own words rather than presenting them as established fact. Thus, they found that the content did not infringe any requirement for neutrality. The report scrutinised in detail the statements of the eyewitnesses who spoke on camera, including the parts of the interviews that {{were not included in the}} broadcast version of the programme. It found, with two exceptions, that the witnesses' statements were fairly represented in the programme. The exceptions were that the programme suggested that Bullock had not heard a warning, when he was in no position to hear whether such a warning was given or not; and that the commentary implied that all four witnesses who appeared on the programme had seen no threatening movements from the IRA members, when only two had been asked whether they witnessed such movements. Windlesham and Rampton also considered Asquez's statement and the journalists' decision to incorporate it into the programme. The report considered that the journalists acted reasonably in using the statement, despite Asquez's refusal <b>to</b> <b>sign</b> <b>it,</b> on the grounds that Asquez had given two separate, near-identical statements (including one to a lawyer), and that they considered it unlikely that somebody would invent such a dramatic account. Nonetheless, the report criticised the programme for not informing viewers of Asquez's refusal to sign the statement.|$|E
25|$|That same day, the BBC news website {{created an}} online {{version of the}} {{petition}} to allow people from across the world <b>to</b> <b>sign</b> <b>it.</b> The petition closed {{a few days later}} on 5 April.

25|$|The Armistice of Mudanya was {{concluded}} on October 11, 1922. The Allies (Britain, France, Italy) retained control of eastern Thrace and the Bosporus. The Greeks were to evacuate these areas.

25|$|After a long discussion, the centre-left {{coalition}} {{released its}} official platform on 10 February 2006, and {{presented it to}} the public the next day. However, the Rose in the Fist refused <b>to</b> <b>sign</b> <b>it</b> in, because it did not explicitly include some issues, such as civil unions and LGBT rights. The platform has been criticised by the House of Freedoms because of its 281-page length.|$|E
25|$|During World War I, Rohmer was a German MD {{officer at}} the {{military}} hospital of Metz. Some of his famous Prussian colleagues asked him to sign the Manifesto of the Ninety-Three in 1914, but his pro-French feelings made him refuse <b>to</b> <b>sign</b> <b>it.</b> After the Allies victory in 1918, {{he became the first}} Professor of Pediatrics at the French Medicine College of Strasbourg, which became part of France again after the war.|$|E
25|$|With {{input from}} all {{involved}} parties, the Public Chamber drafted a ten-point social contract to regulate election conduct, which it opened up for signing from 13 till 18 November. On the first day, {{head of the}} Public Chamber Natela Akaba expressed her puzzlement {{that it had not}} yet been signed by any of the candidates or the heads of the election campaigns.

25|$|Like the President of the United States, the {{governor}} {{plays a major}} role in the legislative process. Every bill that is passed by both the Oklahoma Senate and Oklahoma House of Representatives, and every resolution requiring the assent of both chambers of the legislature, must, before it becomes a law, be presented to {{the governor}}. The governor may choose <b>to</b> <b>sign</b> <b>it</b> or veto it and send it back to the legislature. The governor’s veto can only be overridden by a two-thirds approval vote from each house.|$|E
25|$|In June 1944, Gustaf Mannerheim, {{to ensure}} German support while a major Soviet {{offensive}} was threatening Finland, thought {{it necessary to}} agree to the pact the German Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop demanded. But even then Mannerheim managed to distance himself from the pact, and it fell to President Risto Ryti <b>to</b> <b>sign</b> <b>it,</b> so it {{came to be known as}} the Ryti-Ribbentrop Agreement. This allowed Mannerheim to revoke the agreement upon the resignation of President Ryti at the start of August 1944. Mannerheim succeeded Ryti as president.|$|E
25|$|Heffer {{was opposed}} to the government's {{proposals}} for devolution to Scotland and Wales. He abstained in the vote on a guillotine motion on the Scotland and Wales Bill on 22 February 1977, {{which resulted in the}} defeat of the guillotine, the loss of the Bill and endangered the government. A pact was negotiated between the Labour Party and the Liberals to ensure a majority. Heffer was upset about the pact and started a motion to call a special meeting of the National Executive Committee (the Prime Minister, James Callaghan, forbade Ministers <b>to</b> <b>sign</b> <b>it).</b>|$|E

He had an outstanding {{time in his}} favoured leg slip position too, holding 36 catches. There were more problems in the Yorkshire dressing room, principally a petition started by certain players for the club committee to sack Billy Sutcliffe from the captaincy. Trueman refused <b>to</b> <b>sign</b> <b>it</b> but, in August, Sutcliffe decided to resign. Despite this, Yorkshire still managed to finish third, though a long way behind champions Surrey.|$|E
25|$|Among {{his first}} actions as president, Mesa promised a {{referendum}} on the gas issue and appointed several indigenous people to cabinet posts. On July 18, 2004, Mesa put the issue of gas nationalization to a referendum. On May 6, 2005, the Bolivian Congress passed a new law raising taxes from 18% to 32% on profits made by foreign companies on the extraction of oil and gas. Mesa failed to either sign or veto the law, so by law Senate President Hormando Vaca Diez was required <b>to</b> <b>sign</b> <b>it</b> into law on May 17. Many protesters felt this law was inadequate and demanded full nationalization of the gas and oil industry.|$|E
25|$|The {{constitution}} {{gives the}} President {{the power to}} return a bill unsigned but it circumscribes the power to send it back only once for reconsideration. If the Parliament sends back the bill with or without changes, the President is obliged <b>to</b> <b>sign</b> <b>it.</b> In mid-2006, President Dr.A. P. J. Abdul Kalam sent back a controversial bill regarding the exclusion of certain offices from the scope of 'offices of profit', the holding of which would disqualify a person from {{being a member of}} parliament. The combined opposition, the NDA, hailed the move. The UPA chose to send the bill back to the president without any changes and, after 17 days, Kalam gave his assent on 18 August 2006.|$|E
