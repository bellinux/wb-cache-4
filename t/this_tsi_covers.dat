40|$|Understanding human-human {{interaction}} {{is fundamental to}} the long-term pursuit of powerful and natural multimodal interfaces. Nonverbal communication, including body posture, gesture, facial expression, and eye gaze, is {{an important aspect of}} human-human interaction. We introduce a paradigm for studying multimodal and nonverbal communication in collaborative virtual environments (CVEs) called Transformed Social Interaction (TSI), in which a user’s visual representation is rendered in a way that strategically filters selected communication behaviors in order to change the nature of a social interaction. To achieve <b>this,</b> <b>TSI</b> must employ technology to detect, recognize, and manipulate behaviors of interest, such as facial expressions, gestures, and eye gaze. In [13] we presented a TSI experiment called non-zero-sum gaze (NZSG) to determine the effect of manipulated eye gaze on persuasion in a small group setting.

In auxiliary beam TSI suppression, the TSI in the main radar beam is estimated by a single or several auxiliary beams and is subtracted from the main beam channel. The signal to subtract is the auxiliary beam signals fed through {{an estimate of the}} ‘reflection system’, which describes scattering on the surface.

40|$|International audiencePara-water is an {{analogue}} of para-hydrogen, {{where the}} two proton spins are in a quantum state that is antisymmetric under permutation, also known as singlet state. The populations of the nuclear spin states in para-water {{are believed to have}} long lifetimes just like other Long-Lived States (LLSs). This hypothesis can be verified by measuring the relaxation of an excess or a deficiency of para-water, also known as a “Triplet–Singlet Imbalance” (TSI), i. e., a difference between the average population of the three triplet states T (that are symmetric under permutation) and the population of the singlet state S. In analogy with our recent findings on ethanol and fumarate, we propose to adapt the procedure for Dissolution Dynamic Nuclear Polarization (D-DNP) to prepare such a TSI in frozen water at very low temperatures in the vicinity of 1. 2 K. After rapid heating and dissolution using an aprotic solvent, the TSI should be largely preserved. To assess this hypothesis, we studied the lifetime of water as a molecular entity when diluted in various solvents. In neat liquid H 2 O, proton exchange rates have been characterized by spin-echo experiments on oxygen- 17 in natural abundance, with and without proton decoupling. One-dimensional exchange spectroscopy (EXSY) has been used to study proton exchange rates in H 2 O, HDO and D 2 O mixtures diluted in various aprotic solvents. In the case of 50 mM H 2 O in dioxane-d 8, the proton exchange lifetime is about 20 s. After dissolving, one can observe <b>this</b> <b>TSI</b> by monitoring intensities in oxygen- 17 spectra of H 2 O (if necessary using isotopically enriched samples) where the AX 2 system comprising a “spy” oxygen A and two protons X 2 gives rise to binomial multiplets only if the TSI vanishes. Alternatively, fast chemical addition to a suitable substrate (such as an activated aldehyde or ketone) can provide AX 2 systems where a carbon- 13 acts as a spy nucleus. Proton signals that relax to equilibrium with two distinct time constants can be considered as a hallmark of a TSI. We optimized several experimental procedures designed to preserve and reveal dilute para-water in bulk...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Brain biopsy {{remains an}} {{integral}} and necessary compo-nent {{in the diagnosis}} of brain lesions. We assessed the ability of turbo spectroscopic imaging (TSI) to provide a physiologically based target for tissue sampling. METHODS: TSI was performed in 26 anesthetized patients immediately before MR-guided brain biopsy. In 10 patients, single-voxel spectroscopy {{was performed on the}} TSI-indicated target and correlated with the TSI findings. Biopsy samples were taken from the imaging and spectroscopically defined target(s) under MR guidance, and pathologic findings were compared with preoperative spectra. RESULTS: TSI alone provided a definitive target based on a region of elevated choline in 17 of 21 patients in whom a neoplasm was confirmed. The remaining four neoplasms exhibited relatively low metabolic levels and were difficult to distinguish from the five cases of radiation necrosis seen in <b>this</b> study. <b>TSI</b> findings were in qualitative agreement with those obtained at single-voxel spectroscopy, although TSI spectra exhibited more contamination.

Further cross-wavelet analyses between our calcite δ 18 O and atmospheric 14 C show statistically strong coherence at three typical periodicities of ~ 80, 200 and 340 years, suggesting important roles of solar activities in modulating AM changes at those timescales.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{problems that}} are encountered when introducing and implementing total quality management (TQM), and why these problems will continue to persist unless a tailor-made or planned change approach to implementation is embarked on. A way to solve these problems is to see {{the totality of the}} organization or the area under probe, thereby giving proper meaning to TQM, and then to look for a holistic approach induced by critical systems thinking (CST). CST, apart from its critical awareness, can be seen to stand on complementarism, sociological awareness and the promotion of human well-being and emancipation. If used adequately, it complements the ‘customer focus, process improvement and employee involvement’ principles of TQM. The practical application of CST makes one realize that there are organizational and societal, and even political, pressures, which have led to some methodologies being more favourable than others. It seeks to develop the maximum potential of individuals in organizations and society. Being an approach to problem-solving, CST proposes that the most relevant approach to a situation be used, starting with the most critical problem. The operationalization of CST may be done through a meta-methodology called total systems intervention (<b>TSI).</b> <b>This</b> holistic approach should be seen as a possibility for reinforcing organizational excellence and it is believed {{to be one of the}} major paradigms of the 21 st Century...|$|R
40|$|Abstract only availableNon-Phototropic Hypocotyl 4 / Auxin Response Factor 7 (NPH 4 /ARF 7), {{a potent}} {{transcriptional}} activator {{that has an}} important function in tropic growth and development. Earlier {{research has shown that}} when there is a lesion in the NPH 4 /ARF 7 locus, there is a loss of phototropic and gravitropic responsiveness in the stem (Stowe-Evans et al., 1998; Harper et al., 2000). In addition to providing genetic support for the long held notion that tropic responses require the formation of, and response to, localized changes in auxin concentration, the dependence of tropic responses on NPH 4 /ARF 7 further suggest that auxin-dependent changes in gene expression are critical to these responses. Previous global expression studies have implicated a set of Tropic stimulus-responsive (TSI) genes that are potentially under the transcriptional control of NPH 4 /ARF 7 in tropically responsive plant stems (Esmon et al., 2006). We are further investigating the interaction between <b>this</b> set of <b>TSI</b> genes and NPH 4 /ARF 7 by using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays to determine if NPH 4 /ARF 7 is binding to the auxin response elements (AuxREs) located in the promoter regions of the TSI genes. We have also constructed RNA interference (RNAi) loss-of-function lines for each TSI gene and {{are in the process of}} screening for positive transformants. Our preliminary results from the ChIP assays suggest that NPH 4 /ARF 7 does bind to certain AuxREs in GH 3. 5 and DFL 1 /GH 3. 6 in a preferential manner under auxin and blue-light stimulations. We believe this to be the first direct evidence of targets under the influence of NPH 4 /ARF 7 transcriptional activation.

40|$|Because {{weather has}} the {{potential}} to confound or modify the pollution–mortality relationship, researchers have developed several approaches for controlling it in estimating the independent effect of air pollution on mortality. This report considers the consequences of using alternative approaches to controlling for weather and explores modification of air pollution effects by weather, as weather patterns could plausibly alter air pollution's effect on health. We analyzed 1973 – 1980 total mortality data for Philadelphia using four weather models and compared estimates of the effects of TSP and SO 2 on mortality using a Poisson regression model. Two synoptic categories developed by Kalkstein were selected—the Temporal Synoptic Index (TSI) and the Spatial Synoptic Classification (SSC) —and compared with (1) descriptive models developed by Schwartz and Dockery (S-D); and (2) LOESS, a nonparametric function of the previous day's temperature and dew point. We considered model fit using Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) and changes in the estimated effects of TSP and SO 2. In the full-year analysis, S-D is better than LOESS at prediciting mortality, and S-D and LOESS are better than TSI, as measured by AIC. When TSP or SO 2 was fit alone, the results were qualitatively similar, regardless of how weather was controlled; when TSP and SO 2 were fit simultaneously, the S-D and LOESS models give qualitatively different results than TSI, which attributes more of the pollution effect to SO 2 than to TSP. Model fit is substantially poorer with <b>TSI.</b> <b>This</b> pattern was repeated in analyses of summer and winter months, which included SSC. In summary, using synoptic weather categories in regression models does not meaningfully change the association between mortality and air pollution indexes.

The Effectiveness of Three Steps Interview (TSI) Technique {{towards the}} Students’ Speaking Ability at the Tenth Grade of MA Al Maarif Tulungagung. Thesis. English Education Program of State Islamic Institute of Tulungagung. Advisor: Dr. Erna Iftanti, M. Pd. Keyword: Effectiveness, TSI, students’ {{speaking}} ability Speaking as an interactive process becomes an important skill in English {{that should be}} mastered by the students. Speaking is an activity that involves a speaker and listener to {{interact with each other}} and to transfer information. Thus, the mastery of speaking is necessary to be improved so that the pupils can express their idea, opinions, and feeling and to give response towards the other people say. In fact, there are many students nowadays who cannot speak well. The teaching strategy used by the teachers {{is one of the reasons}} why the students have problem in speaking. This phenomenon happened in MA Al Ma’arif Tulungagung where most of the students of the seventh grade cannot speak fluently. Due to this matter, it is necessary to find out an alternative strategy which can help the students improve their speaking ability. Thus, the researcher intended to verify if the TSI is effective to improve the students’ speaking ability. The formulation of research problems are: 1) How is the students’ speaking ability before being taught by using TSI? 2) How is the students’ speaking ability after being taught by using TSI? 3) Is there any significant difference before and after being taught by using TSI towards the students’ speaking ability? The purposes of this study were: 1) To know the students’ speaking ability before being taught by using TSI. 2) To know the students’ speaking ability after being taught by using TSI. 3) To know the significant difference score before and after being taught by using TSI towards students’ speaking ability This study used a quantitative approach with pre-experimental design. The population was the entire students of the tenth grade of MA Al Ma’arif Tulungagung that consists of three classes. The sample of this study is a single group, that is X-A consisting of 20 students that is chosen by purposive sampling. Therefore, the researcher used one group pre test and post test design. The instrument used in pre test and post test is speaking test. In analyzing the data, the researcher uses SPSS calculation. According to the result of this study, the students’ mean score of pre test is 62. 50 and the mean score of post test is 73. 50. The significant level of statistical calculation is 0. 000 where it is lower than the significant value 0. 05 (0. 000 < 0. 05). This indicates that the alternative hypothesis stating that there is an effectiveness of using TSI towards the students’ speaking ability at the tenth grade of MA Al Ma’arif is accepted. In conclusion, TSI is effective to improve the students’ speaking ability not only in the level of Junior High School, but also in the level of Senior High School. It also works well in unmanageable class and in the lowest level group. In line with the result of <b>this</b> study, <b>TSI</b> can be chosen as an alternative strategy to be implemented in teaching speaking...|$|R
40|$|This thesis uses Critical Systems Thinking (CST) {{as a basic}} {{philosophy}} to explore {{how to create a}} critical process for evaluating methodology. CST is different from the other two mainstreams of systems thinking (Hard Systems Thinking and Soft Systems Thinking) in terms of its emphasis on methodological pluralism, critical awareness and emancipation. The study begins with an explanation of a widely used critical systems methodology, Total Systems Intervention (TSI). TSI offers a means for evaluating other methodologies, and the original aim of the thesis was to further develop this. However, the way the research progressed resulted in a break with the basic structure of TSI. Consequently, a new methodology was produced, which can either be used independently or within <b>TSI.</b> <b>This</b> is called Participative Methodology Evaluation (PME). PME is founded on the idea that a person's understanding of a methodology is influenced by his/her social ideology. Thus, the basic concern of the evaluation of methodology needs to be how methodology-users and organisational/environmental stakeholders can examine their ideological differences through processes of critique in order to make more informed choices. In particular, three perspectives (and subperspectives) need to be explored: the ideology implicit in the methodology being evaluated; the ideological assumptions of the methodology-user (consultant, researcher or manager); and the various ideological assumptions made by organisational and environmental stakeholders. PME embraces three stages: Surfacing, Triangulation and Recommendation. Surfacing aims to expose and explore the various assumptions about, and views on, the candidate ii methodology and the organisational situation. Triangulation compares and contrasts the various perspectives, and if possible an accommodation of views is sought. Recommendation provides practical suggestions to stakeholders as to the likely effects of using the methodology being evaluated, and where appropriate highlights possible modifications and/or alternatives. Finally, a practical case study is given of PME in action. PME was used to evaluate the advisability (or otherwise) of using the Viable System Model (VSM) to restructure Tainan City Council (in Taiwan). Reflections on the case study indicate that significant insights into the likely effects of using the VSM were generated through the PME process, resulting in a fundamental rethink about how the VSM should be applied. Early indications therefore suggest that PME could be a useful tool for organisations seeking to evaluate the likely effects of a methodology prior to application...|$|R
30|$|The {{idealized}} orbital forcing run {{examined in}} the previous section reproduces seasonal asymmetry in the Asian monsoon rainfall and circulation anomalies similar to the PMIP 3 model ensemble mean. However, these two (the PMIP 3 and orbital forcing run) also show distinct regional responses. The PMIP 3 model ensemble mean produces larger ML temperature and rainfall anomalies (warmer and wetter during the MWP than the LIA in both AMJ and ASO; Figs. 2, 3, 4, 5 a) than the orbital forcing run (Figs. 5 b, 6, 7, 8). Especially, the ML tropical tropospheric temperature anomaly is broadly negative (EQ– 20 °N) in the orbital forcing run (Fig. 7), resulting in a low-latitude circulation anomaly (e.g. westerly over northern India in AMJ) that is inconsistent with the PMIP 3 (Fig. 3). The Asian rainfall anomaly is less zonally uniform than the PMIP 3 estimates (Figs. 2, 6). These differences may be ascribed to less ML difference in the global-mean temperature between the MWP and LIA in the orbital forcing run than in the PMIP 3 case. Phipps et al. (2013) also showed that the ML warming anomaly in the last-millennium orbital forcing run is smaller than in all forcing runs. The PMIP 3 multimodel mean produces a larger global SST warming anomaly during the MWP than in the LIA, particularly over the middle and high latitudes (Fig. 5 a), in contrast to the tropical-wide negative SST anomaly that the orbital forcing run estimates (Fig. 5 b). This SST difference may make a substantial contribution to the difference in the mid-to-upper tropospheric temperatures, where we see a cooler troposphere in the orbital forcing run than the PMIP 3 as in Figs. 3 and 7 (Ueda et al. 2006; Kamae et al. 2015). In contrast to increased summer insolation (Fig. 1), winter insolation inversely decreases over the NH and SH, resulting in limited global-mean annual-mean insolation anomalies. This limited global-mean forcing cannot simply explain the globally-warmer climate during the MWP than in the LIA (Fig. 5 a). Under the PMIP 3 framework, GHGs, volcanic aerosols, <b>TSI,</b> and land <b>cover</b> all varied over time in the climate model simulations in addition to the orbital forcing. For example, the CO 2 concentration during the MWP is higher than in the LIA, especially after 1600  A.D. (Schmidt et al. 2011), contributing partly to global warming and the larger summertime tropospheric warming over the Eurasian continent than over the surrounding oceans as shown in Fig. 3 b (Kamae et al. 2014). In addition, TSI and large volcanic eruptions are also important factors in the ML climate anomaly (e.g., Schurer et al. 2014; Otto-Bliesner et al. 2016). Phipps et al. (2013) showed that the last-millennium temperature variation, in response to orbital forcing, is smaller than that in response to all forcing factors. Orbital forcing is substantially important for the seasonally asymmetric Asian monsoon response (Fig. 8) although it is a minor factor in the global ML climate anomaly (Fig. 5). The effect of volcanic eruptions on the SST anomaly is also discussed in the next subsection.|$|R
