5|$|In August 1979, {{after two}} warm-up shows in Copenhagen, Led Zeppelin headlined two concerts at the Knebworth Music Festival, playing {{to a crowd}} of {{approximately}} 104,000 on the first night. A brief, low-key European tour was undertaken in June and July 1980, featuring a stripped-down set without the usual lengthy jams and solos. On 27 June, at a show in Nuremberg, Germany, the concert came <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>abrupt</b> <b>halt</b> {{in the middle of}} the third song, when Bonham collapsed onstage and was rushed to hospital. Speculation in the press suggested that his collapse had been the result of excessive alcohol and drug use, but the band claimed that he had simply overeaten.|$|E
5|$|In January 2013, Jean-Claude Van Damme {{was rumored}} to be co-starring {{alongside}} Jaa; in reality, he was never available due to scheduling issues, and as a result, Lundgren was cast as an alternative. The film entered production in April 2013, but came <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>abrupt</b> <b>halt</b> {{after three months of}} filming. Sahamongkol Film International filed a $49–50 million lawsuit against Jaa, Universal Pictures, and United International Pictures, claiming Jaa was in breach of his contract by accepting a role in Fast and Furious 7. After two years of legal proceedings, Sahamongkol dropped the lawsuit in July 2015. Despite this, production of A Man Will Rise has not continued, and the film remains uncompleted.|$|E

5|$|The 2005–06 {{season began}} {{with the promise of}} several new signings: Júlio Baptista (€24million), Robinho (€30million) and Sergio Ramos (€27million). However, Real Madrid {{suffered}} from some poor results, including a 0–3 loss at the hands of Barcelona at the Santiago Bernabéu in November 2005. Madrid's coach Wanderley Luxemburgo was sacked the following month and his replacement was Juan Ramón López Caro. A brief return to form came <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>abrupt</b> <b>halt</b> after losing the first leg of the Copa del Rey quarterfinal, 6–1 to Real Zaragoza.

5|$|Soon {{after the}} Creangă's death, efforts began {{to collect his}} {{manuscript}} writings and the updated versions of his printed works. This project involved his son Constantin, alongside A. D. Xenopol, Grigore Alexandrescu and Eduard Gruber, the latter of whom obtained the works from Tinca Vartic. The first edition was published as two volumes, in 1890–1892, but the project came <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>abrupt</b> <b>halt</b> due to Gruber's insanity and death. Creangă's final known work, the fragment of Făt-frumos, fiul iepei, was published by Convorbiri Literare in 1898. The Gruber copies were sold to a Dr. Mendel, and {{only a part of}} them was recovered by exegetes, alongside various fragments accidentally discovered at Iași market, where they were being used for wrapping paper. The collection, structured into a whole by folklorist Gheorghe T. Kirileanu, was published by Editura Minerva in 1902 and 1906. In addition to being mentioned in the memoirs of several prominent Junimists, Creangă had his political career fictionalized and satirized by Iacob Negruzzi, who transformed him, as Popa Smântână, into a character of his satirical poems Electorale ("Electorals"). The same author referred to his counterpart in one of his epigrams.|$|E
5|$|After Maidan Castle, Wheeler {{turned his}} {{attention}} to France, where the archaeological investigation of Iron Age sites had lagged behind developments in Britain. There, he oversaw a series of surveys and excavations with the aid of Leslie Scott, beginning with a survey tour of Brittany in the winter of 1936–37. After this, Wheeler decided to excavate the oppidum at Camp d'Artus, near Huelgoat, Finistère. In addition to bringing many British archaeologists to work on the site, he hired six local Breton workmen to assist the project, coming to the belief that the oppidum had been erected by local Iron Age tribes to defend themselves from the Roman invasion led by Julius Caesar. Meanwhile, Scott had been placed in charge of an excavation at the smaller nearby hill fort of Kercaradec, near Quimper. In July 1939, the project focused its attention on Normandy, with excavations beginning at the Iron Age hill forts of Camp de Canada and Duclair. They were brought <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>abrupt</b> <b>halt</b> in September 1939 as the Second World War broke out in Europe, and the team evacuated back to Britain. Wheeler's excavation report, co-written with Katherine Richardson, was eventually published as Hill-forts of Northern France in 1957.|$|E

25|$|Of Courtneidge's two {{productions}} in 1913, Ivan Caryll's American musical Oh! Oh! Delphine {{received a}} strong reception, but The Pearl Girl {{was only a}} moderate success. In 1914 Cicely Courtneidge and Jack Hulbert starred in The Cinema Star, an adaptation by Hulbert and Harry Graham of Die Kino-Königin, a 1913 German comic opera by Jean Gilbert. It was a hit for Courtneidge and ran to full houses at the Shaftesbury Theatre until Britain and Germany went to war in August 1914; anti-German sentiment brought the run <b>to</b> <b>a</b> premature and <b>abrupt</b> <b>halt.</b> Courtneidge's next shows, My Lady Frayle, Oh, Caesar! and The Light Blues (all 1916, the last of which included a young Noël Coward in its cast) all failed, and the patriotic operetta Young England was only a modest success.|$|R
40|$|Prior to {{the late}} 19608, {{resource}} development in the Arctic had not gained any momentum and the demands for granular materials for community gravel airstrips, community nfrastructure projects, small isolated mining projects, and winter access roads were easily met. There were few competing needs for the granular resources in the Mackenzie River Valley and Delta areas. In the early 1970 s, with the pending world oil shortages, major resource development and transportation projects were conceived for the Mackenzie Valley and detailed feasibility investigations were undertaken. In view of the extremely disturbance sensitive permafrost errain in the Arctic, each of these industrial megaprojects required substantive quantities of granular materials to support major engineered facilities. Significant demands for granular materials were identified {{for oil and gas}} pipelines, oil and gas processing plants and related facilities, Beaufort Sea developments, the extension of the Mackenzie Highway system, deep seaports on the Beaufort coast, and extensive infrastructure upgrading in Mackenzie Valley communities. The demands for granular materials in the Mackenzie Valley came <b>to</b> <b>a</b> sudden and <b>abrupt</b> <b>halt</b> in the early to mid- 1980 s with the drop in world oil prices and postponement of megaproject activity in the region...|$|R
5|$|In 1976, the Dunstan Government {{stepped up}} its {{legislative}} efforts. Some bills, {{such as the one}} to remove the sodomy law and decriminalise male homosexuality, had been initially blocked by the Legislative Council. However, the bill to abolish capital punishment passed with ease, and the homosexuality law reforms eventually passed in September. Rape law was properly codified and defined as a crime within marriage {{for the first time in}} Australia. Shopping hours, previously the most restrictive in the nation, became the most open. Following a royal commission, Friday night shopping was introduced for the city and Thursday night shopping for the suburbs. The deposits on beverage containers was finally passed. The first signs of Monarto's eventual failure began to appear: birth rates started dropping significantly, immigration slowed and the economy was stagnant. South Australia's robust population growth, previously the highest per capita among the states, came <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>abrupt</b> <b>halt.</b> However, state money continued to be poured into the Monarto project, despite the fact that the Whitlam government cut funding to $600,000 in 1975, while his Liberal successor Malcolm Fraser gave nothing at all the following year. However, by the time Monarto was eventually scrapped after Dunstan's departure, no less than $20 million had been used to buy land, plant trees and formulate development plans, and the failed project is often seen as Dunstan's greatest failure. In addition, the federal government removed subsidies for shipbuilding at Whyalla, forcing the operations to be scaled down.|$|E

50|$|Loewen's work on {{religion}} runs from general {{discussions of the}} relationships between science and religion, reason and faith (2008 and 2012), to scholarly investigations into the hermeneutic dimensions of religious experience, and studies of William James, Heidegger, Weber and Durkheim (2009). His popular books have a distinctively Durkheimian tone. In What is God? Loewen asserts that it is the combination of human aspiration to be more than our mortality allows, along with the anxiety regarding that very same mortality that provides the subjective inclination for the religious life. The cultural necessity for religion is grounded in the need for human community. In On the Afterlife, he presents a new comparative and historical model of beliefs in the purposes and meanings of life after death which calls into operation his anthropological training. He suggests that all known societies are categorized by one of five patterns, either thinking that the soul returns unevaluated to the world, it returns evaluated, it is evaluated and does not return, or it remains unevaluated and does not return. The conception of nothingness is a peculiarly modern understanding, but Loewen argues that it does not hamper our ethical efforts while we are alive to imagine that mortality comes <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>abrupt</b> and final <b>halt.</b> He concludes that each of these five models are aiming to remind us of the same human condition, one that he sees historically as presenting each of us both a gift and a task. His notion of 'phenomemnemonics', the study of objects by which we use to remember other experiences, also has particular relevance to the links between biography and religious traditions.|$|R

Italian artists, with the odd exception like Girolamo da Treviso, {{seem to have had}} little attraction to Protestantism. In Germany, however, the leading figures such as Albrecht Dürer and his pupils, Lucas Cranach the Elder, Albrecht Altdorfer and the Danube school, and Hans Holbein the Younger all followed the Reformers.

His first real test was against 27th seed Roberto Bautista Agut, but the Spaniard proved no match for Murray who raced to another straight sets win in just over an hour and a half. Murray then defeated big serving Kevin Anderson, the 20th seed, to reach his seventh consecutive Wimbledon quarter-final. His defence then came <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>abrupt</b> <b>halt</b> as Grigor Dimitrov ended his 17 match winning-streak at Wimbledon with a straight sets win, meaning Murray failed to reach the semi-finals {{for the first time since}} 2008.|$|E
