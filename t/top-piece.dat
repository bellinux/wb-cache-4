60|$|As to the {{situation}} of this town, it lieth just between the two worlds; and the first founder and builder of it, so far as by {{the best and most}} authentic records I can gather, was one Shaddai; and he built it for his own delight. He made it the mirror and glory of all that he made, even the <b>top-piece,</b> beyond anything else that he did in that country. Yea, so goodly a town was Mansoul when first built, that it is said by some, the gods, at the setting up thereof, came down to see it, and sang for joy. And as he made it goodly to behold, so also mighty to have dominion over all the country round about. Yea, all were commanded to acknowledge Mansoul for their metropolitan, all were enjoined to do homage to it. Aye, the town itself had positive commission and power from her King to demand service of all, and also to subdue any that anyways denied to do it.|$|E
60|$|If righteousness, if {{the stamp}} of God, if divine authority, is not found upon that thing which I hold, let men never suffer for it under the notion of righteousness. If sin, if superstition, if idolatry, if {{derogation}} from the wisdom of Christ, and the authority and perfection of his Word, be not found in, nor joined to that thing that I disown in worship, let me never open my mouth against it. I had rather fall in with, and be an associate of a righteous man that has no true grace, than with a professor that has no righteousness. It is said of the young man, though he went away from Christ, that he looked upon him and loved him (Mark 10:17-22). But it is not said that ever he loved Judas. I know that the righteousness for which a good man suffereth, is not then embraced of the world, for that {{at such a time}} it is under a cloud. But yet there is righteousness also in the world, and wherever I see it, it is of a high esteem with me. David acknowledged some of his enemies to be more righteous than he acknowledged some of his servants to be (2 Sam 4:9-11; 3:31-35). It is a brave thing to have righteousness, as righteousness, to be the <b>top-piece</b> in mine affections. The reason why Christ was anointed with the oil of gladness above his fellows, was, because he loved righteousness, and hated iniquity more than they (Heb. 1:9). Love to righteousness flows from golden graces, and is that, and that only, that can make a man capable of suffering, in our sense, for righteousness' sake.|$|E
60|$|But if {{the petty}} {{annoyances}} that beset our {{friend in the}} fore part of that day may be styled harassing, those with which he was overwhelmed towards evening may be called exasperating. First of all he broke {{the top of his}} rod, a misfortune which broke his heart entirely. But recollecting suddenly that he had three spare <b>top-pieces</b> in the butt, his heart was cemented and bound up, so to speak, in a rough and ready manner. Next, he stepped into a hole, {{which turned out to be}} three feet deep, so that he was instantly soaked up to the waist. Being extremely hot, besides having grown quite reckless, Mr Sudberry did not mind this; it was pleasantly cooling. He was cheered, too, at the moment, by the re-appearance of the sun, which shone out as bright as ever, warming his heart, (poor, ignorant man!) and, all unknown to him, damaging his chance of catching any more fish at that time.|$|R
50|$|The {{traditional}} shoemaker would {{measure the}} feet {{and cut out}} upper leathers according to the required size. These parts were fitted and stitched together. The sole was next assembled, consisting {{of a pair of}} inner soles of soft leather, a pair of outer soles of firmer texture, a pair of welts or bands about one inch broad, of flexible leather, and lifts and <b>top-pieces</b> for the heels. The insole was then attached to a last made of wood, which was used to form the shoe. Some lasts were straight, while curved lasts came in pairs: one for left shoes, the other for right shoes. The 'lasting' procedure then secured the leather upper to the sole with tacks. The soles were then hammered into shape; the heel lifts were then attached with wooden pegs and the worn out-sole was nailed down to the lifts. The finishing operation included paring, rasping, scraping, smoothing, blacking, and burnishing the edges of soles and heels, scraping, sand-papering, and burnishing the soles, withdrawing the lasts, and cleaning out any pegs which may have pierced through the inner sole.|$|R
6000|$|... 1. It supposeth God's abhorrence of the soul. That {{which we}} abhor, that we cast from us, {{and put out}} of our favour and respect with disdain, and a loathing thereof. So when God teacheth Israel to loathe and abhor their idols, He bids them 'to cast away their very {{covering}} as a stinking and menstruous cloth, and to say unto it, 'Get you hence' (Isa 30:22), 'He shall gather the good into vessels, and cast the bad away' (Matt 13:48; 25:41). Cast them out of My presence. Well, but whither must they go? The answer is, Into hell, into utter darkness, into the fire that is prepared for the devil and his angels. Wherefore, to be cast away, to be cast away of God, it showeth unto us God's abhorrence of such souls, and how vile and loathsome such are in His divine eyes. And the similitude of Abigail's sling, mentioned before, doth yet further show us the greatness of this abhorrence--'The souls of thine enemies,' said she, 'God shall sling out as {{out of the middle}} of a sling.' When a man casts a stone away with a sling, then he casteth it furthest from him, for with a sling he can cast a stone further than by his hand. 'And he,' saith the text, 'shall cast them away as with a sling.' But that is not all, neither: for it is not only said that He shall sling away their souls, but that He shall sling them away as 'out of the middle of a sling.' When a stone is placed, to be cast away, {{in the middle of a}} sling, then doth the slinger cast it furthest of all. Now God is the slinger, abhorrence is His sling, the lost soul is the stone, and it is placed in the very middle of the sling, and is from thence cast away. And, therefore, it is said again, that 'such shall go into utter, outer darkness'--that is, furthest off of all. This therefore shows us how God abhors that man that for sin has lost himself. And well he may; for such an one has not only polluted and defiled himself with sin; and that is the most offensive thing to God under heaven; but he has abused the handiwork of God. The soul, as I said before, is the workmans hip of God, yea, the <b>top-piece</b> that He hath made in all the visible world; also He made it for to be delighted with it, and to admit it into communion with Himself. Now for man thus to abuse God; for a man to take his soul, which is God's, and prostrate it to sin, to the world, to the devil, and every beastly lust, flat against the command of God, and notwithstanding the soul was also His; this is horrible, and calls aloud upon that God whose soul this is to abhor, and to show, by all means possible, His abhorrence of such an one.|$|E
50|$|Classicism first {{abandoned}} {{the combination of}} the two framings, it next gave up the truss-frame, so that finally nothing remained of the former variety but the simple unadorned frame with or without a top piece. As regards the Louis XVI and Empire styles the simplifying of the frame was retained and ornamentation was limited almost exclusively to the <b>top-piece,</b> which was supported by consoles and adorned with garlands of fruit and other ornaments in imitation of the antique.|$|E
50|$|In 1751 a 100 ft high {{landmark}} {{and former}} inland lighthouse {{known as the}} Dunston Pillar had been erected {{less than a mile}} north of the station on Tower Road to aid travellers crossing the wild heathland south of Lincoln. As the tower was within the flying circuit of the new airfield 40 ft was removed from the tower's height and its <b>top-piece</b> statue of King George III was removed to Lincoln Castle, where it remains today.|$|E
50|$|The new {{monument}} was not {{to imitate}} the existing cairn as simply a marker for the site of Cook's landing, but was intended to symbolise that in landing at this place, the British first {{opened the door of}} opportunity in Queensland. A four-sided concrete portico in classical style was erected, with the words Doorway to Destiny on the <b>top-piece.</b> In 1975, the area surrounding the monument was gazetted as the Captain Cook Memorial and Park Reserve. The monument later developed concrete cancer, and was demolished in August 1994.|$|E
50|$|Not {{all high}} slim heels merit the {{description}} stiletto. The extremely slender original Italian-style stiletto {{heels of the}} late 1950s and very early 1960s {{were no more than}} 5 mm in diameter for much of their length, although the heel sometimes flared out a little at the <b>top-piece</b> (tip). After their demise in the mid-late 1960s, such slender heels were difficult to find until recently due to changes in the way heels were mass-produced. A real stiletto heel has a stem of solid steel or alloy. The more usual method of mass-producing high shoe heels, i.e. moulded plastic with an internal metal tube for reinforcement, does not achieve the true stiletto shape.|$|E
50|$|While {{the fashion}} for the turban was partly borne of {{necessity}} in Europe, it became chic {{when it appeared}} on the heads of Hollywood icons. The French milliner Madame Paulette (Pauline Adam de la Bruy√®re) is often credited with reviving the turban and {{claimed to have been}} inspired by the designs she saw on French girls cycling the streets of Paris during the war. She went on to create hats worn by Gloria Swanson, Marlene Dietrich and Greta Garbo. Later, she would also create designs for fashion houses such as Chanel and Ungaro Madame Agn√®s, who had trained under Caroline Reboux, was also designing turbans and a black fabric creation with ornate padded <b>top-piece</b> and scarf draping carried under the chin is part of the museum collection of the FIDM in Paris.|$|E
