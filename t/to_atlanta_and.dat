5|$|Perhaps {{because it}} was the lead cruiser in the U.S. formation, Atlanta was the target of fire and torpedoes from several Japanese ships—probably {{including}} Nagara, Inazuma, and Ikazuchi—in addition to Akatsuki. The gunfire caused heavy damage <b>to</b> <b>Atlanta,</b> <b>and</b> a type 93 torpedo strike cut all of her engineering power. The disabled cruiser drifted into the line of fire of SanFrancisco, which accidentally fired on her, causing even greater damage. Admiral Scott and many of the bridge crew were killed. Without power and unable to fire her guns, Atlanta drifted out of control and out of the battle as the Japanese ships passed her by. The lead U.S. destroyer, Cushing, was also caught in a crossfire between several Japanese destroyers and perhaps Nagara. She too was hit heavily and stopped dead in the water.|$|E

25|$|In June Sherman's forces {{continued}} maneuvers {{around the}} northern approaches <b>to</b> <b>Atlanta,</b> <b>and</b> a battle ensued at Kolb's Farm on June 22, followed by Sherman's first (and only) {{attempt at a}} massive frontal assault in the Battle of Kennesaw Mountain on June 27, which Johnston strongly repulsed. However, by this time Federal forces were within 17 miles of Atlanta, threatening the city from the west and north. Johnston had yielded over 110 miles of mountainous, and thus more easily defensible, territory in just two months, while the Confederate government became increasingly frustrated and alarmed. When Johnston retreated across the Chattahoochee River, the final major barrier before Atlanta, President Davis lost his patience.|$|E
25|$|The {{campaign}} {{opened with}} several battles in May and June 1864 as Sherman pressed Johnston southeast through mountainous terrain. Sherman avoided frontal assaults against most of Johnston's positions, instead maneuvering in flanking marches around the Confederate defenses. When Sherman flanked the defensive lines (almost exclusively around Johnston's left flank), Johnston would retreat to another prepared position. The Battle of Kennesaw Mountain (June 27) was a notable exception, in which Sherman attempted a frontal assault, against {{the advice of}} his subordinates, and suffered significant losses, losing 7,000 men versus 700 for Johnston. Both armies took advantage of the railroads as supply lines, with Johnston shortening his supply lines as he drew closer <b>to</b> <b>Atlanta,</b> <b>and</b> Sherman lengthening his own. However, Davis was becoming frustrated with Johnston, who he viewed was needlessly losing territory and was refusing to counterattack or even discuss his plans with Davis.|$|E
