5|$|As {{a part of}} Las Casas's defense by offense, he had {{to argue}} against Juan Ginés de Sepúlveda.

The book was deemed unsound for publication by the theologians of Salamanca and Alcalá for containing unsound doctrine, but the pro-encomendero faction seized on Sepúlveda as their intellectual champion.|$|E

Originally set to be released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360 and Xbox One, the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions of the game were cancelled due to hardware restrictions. A Linux port was also announced.|$|E

5|$|The {{founder effect}} is a special case of a {{population}} bottleneck, occurring when a small group in a population splinters off from the original population and forms a new one. The random sample of alleles in <b>the</b> <b>just</b> formed new colony is expected to grossly misrepresent the original population {{in at least some}} respects. It is even possible that the number of alleles for some genes in the original population is larger than the number of gene copies in the founders, making complete representation impossible. When a newly formed colony is small, its founders can strongly affect the population's genetic make-up far into the future.|$|E
5|$|Unable {{either to}} stay in France or to move to Germany, Marx decided to emigrate to Brussels in Belgium in February 1845.

In April 1845, Engels moved from Barmen in Germany to Brussels to join Marx and the growing cadre of members of the League of <b>the</b> <b>Just</b> now seeking home in Brussels. Later, Mary Burns, Engels' long-time companion, left Manchester, England to join Engels in Brussels.|$|E

5|$|Before he died, Bolesław III Wrymouth {{divided the}} country, {{in a limited}} sense, among four of his sons. He made complex {{arrangements}} intended to prevent fratricidal warfare and preserve the Polish state's formal unity, but after Bolesław's death, {{the implementation of the}} plan failed and a long period of fragmentation was ushered in. For nearly two centuries, the Piasts would spar with each other, the clergy, and the nobility for the control over the divided kingdom. The stability of the system was supposedly assured by the institution of the senior or high duke of Poland, based in Kraków and assigned to the special Seniorate Province that was not to be subdivided. Following his concept of seniorate, Bolesław divided the country into five principalities: Silesia, Greater Poland, Masovia, Sandomierz and Kraków. The first four provinces were given to his four sons, who became independent rulers. The fifth province, the Seniorate Province of Kraków, was {{to be added to the}} senior among the princes who, as the Grand Duke of Kraków, was the representative of the whole of Poland. This principle broke down already within the generation of Bolesław III's sons, when Władysław II the Exile, Bolesław IV the Curly, Mieszko III the Old and Casimir II <b>the</b> <b>Just</b> fought for power and territory in Poland, and in particular over the throne of Kraków.|$|E
5|$|During the Battle of Britain {{against the}} Royal Air Force (RAF) in mid-1940, Wick rose quickly in rank and in profile, {{both in the}} battle zone and as a public figure back in Germany. On 21 July 1940, <b>the</b> <b>just</b> {{promoted}} Oberleutnant (first lieutenant) also became leader of 3. Staffel, succeeding Major Henning Stümpell. Although the fighting in the air grew increasingly difficult, Wick kept adding victories to his tally. He recorded his 20th victory on 24 August and added two more fighters a day later. This achievement earned Wick a reference in the Wehrmachtbericht (his first of five in total), a bulletin issued by {{the headquarters of the}} Wehrmacht. Twenty aerial victories also made Wick eligible for the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross, a higher grade of the Iron Cross. Wick was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross on 27 August 1940 at Karinhall by Reichsmarschall (Empire's Marshal) Hermann Göring. He was also interviewed by an Adler (Eagle—the Luftwaffe weekly magazine) journalist prior to the presentation. Several articles about Wick appeared at the time. Wick was granted four days of leave, which he spent with his family in Berlin.|$|E
5|$|Egyptian texts take {{different}} views {{on whether the}} gods are responsible when humans suffer unjustly. Misfortune was often seen {{as a product of}} isfet, the cosmic disorder that was the opposite of maat, and therefore the gods were not guilty of causing evil events. Some deities who were closely connected with isfet, such as Set, could be blamed for disorder within the world without placing guilt on the other gods. But some writings do accuse the deities of causing human misery, while others give theodicies in the gods' defense. Beginning in the Middle Kingdom, several texts connected the issue of evil in the world with a myth in which the creator god fights a human rebellion against his rule and then withdraws from the earth. Because of this human misbehavior, the creator is distant from his creation, allowing suffering to exist. New Kingdom writings do not question <b>the</b> <b>just</b> nature of the gods as strongly as those of the Middle Kingdom. They emphasize humans' direct, personal relationships with deities and the gods' power to intervene in human events. People in this era put faith in specific gods who they hoped would help and protect them through their lives. As a result, upholding the ideals of maat grew less important than gaining the gods' favor as a way to guarantee a good life. Even the pharaohs were regarded as dependent on divine aid, and after the New Kingdom came to an end, government was increasingly influenced by oracles communicating the gods' will.|$|E

The Camel has a hump {{given to him by}} a djinn as punishment for the camel's refusing to work (the hump allows the camel to work longer between times of eating). The Leopard's spots were painted by an Ethiopian (after the Ethiopian painted himself black). The Kangaroo gets its powerful hind legs, long tail, and hopping gait after being chased all day by a dingo, sent by a minor god responding to the Kangaroo's request to be made different from all other animals.|$|E
5|$|The {{description}} {{provided by}} Blake to Humphrey {{explains that the}} work depicts the resurrection. The top of the work depicts Christ on the Throne of Judgement with Heaven opened up across the painting. Behind Christ are the heads of infants which represent creation coming from Jesus. Christ is surrounded by the four Zoas and seven angels that have vials filled with God's wrath. An image of a tabernacle with a cross inside is depicted above Christ. An image of baptism is to Christ's right and the Last Supper is to Christ's left with both representing eternal life. Further to Christ's right is the resurrection of <b>the</b> <b>just</b> {{and to the left}} is the resurrection and subsequent fall of the wicked. Adam and Eve are below Christ, and Abraham and Moses are nearby. Below Moses is Satan wrapped by the Serpent and in the centre is the book of death. At the top is the book of life, and the Christian Church is the figure of a woman on top of the moon.|$|E
25|$|In {{connection}} with the application of regular numbers to music theory, it is of interest to find pairs of regular numbers that differ by one. There are exactly ten such pairs (x, x+1) and each such pair defines a superparticular ratio (x + 1)/x that is meaningful as a musical interval. These intervals are 2/1 (the octave), 3/2 (the perfect fifth), 4/3 (the perfect fourth), 5/4 (<b>the</b> <b>just</b> major third), 6/5 (<b>the</b> <b>just</b> minor third), 9/8 (<b>the</b> <b>just</b> major tone), 10/9 (<b>the</b> <b>just</b> minor tone), 16/15 (<b>the</b> <b>just</b> diatonic semitone), 25/24 (<b>the</b> <b>just</b> chromatic semitone), and 81/80 (the syntonic comma).|$|E
