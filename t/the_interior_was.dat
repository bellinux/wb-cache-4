5|$|After the Department of <b>the</b> <b>Interior</b> <b>was</b> stopped from {{issuing a}} {{construction}} permit, the unincorporated TAPS consortium was reorganized {{into the new}} incorporated Alyeska Pipeline Service Company. Former Humble Oil manager Edward L.

5|$|The {{building}} had {{stained glass windows}} and <b>the</b> <b>interior</b> <b>was</b> decorated with glazed bricks, similar to other public buildings of this era in the city, such as the Victoria Baths. The similarities suggest the influence and adoption of a standard design by Henry Price's newly created City Architect's Department.|$|E

5000|$|Although {{from the}} outside the house appears to have three storeys, and {{although}} <b>the</b> <b>interior</b> <b>is</b> logically laid out, <b>the</b> <b>interior</b> <b>is</b> organized on numerous different levels [...] - [...] variously reported as ranging from 11 levels [...] {{to as many as}} 19.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>interior</b> surface <b>is</b> irregular, but {{sections}} {{have been}} resurfaced by basaltic lava.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>interior</b> <b>was</b> {{refurbished}} in 1955. The exterior {{had been}} cleaned {{every year since}} the fire station opened, {{and as a result}} was in pristine condition when the building celebrated its Golden Jubilee on 6 October 1956.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>interior</b> <b>was</b> to {{have been}} a riot of Burgesian excess but not a single room was {{completed}} to Burges's designs. Of the few interior features that were fully executed, much was altered or diluted by Heathcoat-Amory and his successors. However some of the interiors, such as the library, vaulted hall and the arched red drawing room, remain or have been re-instated.|$|E
5|$|With {{the postwar}} decline of variety and music hall and {{increased}} competition from cinema and television, the theatre went into decline and was closed on 31 January 1955. Following its closure {{it was used}} by Associated TeleVision as a studio until 1963. <b>The</b> <b>interior</b> <b>was</b> demolished in 1970, but the building remains intact and is now used as a shop and offices.|$|E

5|$|After {{meeting with}} Caine and Forte, White {{was taken to}} the grill {{restaurant}} at the Hyde Park Hotel. Forte was interested if White could transfer the Michelin stars from Harveys; White was open to this since Raymond Blanc had previously transferred two stars to Le Manoir aux Quat'Saisons when he moved his restaurant from Summertown, Oxford. Following the agreement of Michelin, White left Harveys in July 1993; The Restaurant was opened at the Hyde Park Hotel less than two months later, on 14 September. <b>The</b> <b>interior</b> <b>was</b> decorated with paintings from White's own collection.|$|E
5|$|From the exterior, the {{building}} appears austere, as was much of Mountfort's early work: a central tower dominates two flanking gabled wings in the Gothic revival style. However <b>the</b> <b>interior</b> <b>was</b> {{a riot of}} colour and medievalism as perceived through Victorian eyes; it included stained glass windows, and a large double-faced clock, thought {{to be one of}} only five around the globe. The chamber is decorated in a rich, almost Ruskinesque style, with carvings by a local sculptor William Brassington. Included in the carvings are representations of indigenous New Zealand species.|$|E
5|$|In 1872 or 1873, Yount {{was hired}} as a {{seasonal}} guide, wrangler and packer for geological survey expeditions with the aim of mapping broad swaths of the Rocky Mountains. The Hayden Survey, led by Ferdinand Vandeveer Hayden and funded by the Department of <b>the</b> <b>Interior,</b> <b>was</b> one of several regional survey projects that were combined to form the United States Geological Survey in 1879. Hayden {{had been one of the}} leading advocates for the creation of Yellowstone National Park, which President Ulysses S. Grant signed into law on March 1, 1872.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>interior</b> <b>is</b> {{divided into}} two {{connected}} rooms and a small bathroom. It still contains the original wood-finished ceilings, along with some original exposed brick walls. Other sections of <b>the</b> <b>interior</b> <b>are</b> finished with sheetrock. A paved entry trail and small garden are outside the building.|$|R
5|$|In 1875, the U.S. Department of <b>the</b> <b>Interior</b> <b>was</b> {{in serious}} {{disrepair}} due to corruption and incompetence. Interior Secretary Columbus Delano, discovered {{to have taken}} bribes for fraudulent land grants, {{was forced to resign}} from office on October 15, 1875. Delano had also given lucrative cartographical contracts to his son John Delano and Ulysses S. Grant's own brother, Orvil Grant. Neither John Delano nor Orvil Grant performed any work, nor were they qualified to hold such surveying positions.|$|E
5|$|In 1980 {{the fourth}} bell {{of the ring}} of six was recast, again by the Whitechapel Foundry. By the 1990s the {{internal}} design of the church was beginning to be considered impractical {{for the needs of}} the community, and <b>the</b> <b>interior</b> <b>was</b> remodelled to a design by Robert Potter, with the works carried out in 1999. The west gallery was restored to house the 1852 organ, together with a kitchen and toilet facility, and the north transept was converted into a vestry with a room above it. Underfloor heating was built below a new marble floor and the chancel step replaced by an ovoid raised marble dais. Meanwhile, Scott's pews were removed altogether and replaced by wooden chairs.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} design and decoration, Mavrodinov likens the church to the Church of St Pantaleon in Gorno Nerezi near Skopje, today in the Republic of Macedonia. It is also {{compared}} to the Church of St Theodore in nearby Boboshevo. The Church of St Nicholas features a multitude of two-stepped vaults on its outside walls. <b>The</b> <b>interior</b> <b>was</b> originally entirely covered with frescoes, though only fragments survive. It was enlisted as a monument of culture of national importance in 1968, with a publication in Bulgaria's newspaper of record, the State Gazette, issue 77.|$|E

50|$|Monsignor Battelli {{restored}} the castle, rebuilding a chapel {{and created a}} library. To the latter have been added papers and volumes from the Archbishopric. In the late 19th-century, <b>the</b> <b>interiors</b> <b>were</b> refurbished, creating a large hall, theater, and <b>the</b> <b>interiors</b> <b>were</b> decorated in 1895 by Enrico Mancini in a neoclassical style.|$|R
5|$|In the St. Joseph the Worker Chapel, Victorias, in the Philippines, Raymond {{worked with}} liturgical artist Ade Bethune, to produce mosaic murals and a lacquerware {{tabernacle}} inside the reinforced concrete church. <b>The</b> <b>interior</b> <b>was</b> adorned with colourful frescoes by Alfonso Ossorio. The church {{acted as a}} social centre for employees of the Ossorio sugar cane refinery. The church is {{regarded as one of}} the first examples of modern sacred architecture in the country.|$|E
5|$|Initially, as {{in some of}} the {{continental}} cathedrals, <b>the</b> <b>interior</b> <b>was</b> decorated with designs emphasizing the arch ribs and portal components. Even the brick was painted with red and white stripes. In the 15th century, frescos of figures in the Late Gothic style with decorative vine leaves were painted {{in various parts of the}} church. Traces of these have been found in the chancel and in the chapel which was originally dedicated to St Eric and St Olaf. Unfortunately, they have now been heavily restored. The frescos in the chancel were probably painted by Albertus Pictor's workshop.|$|E
5|$|The Church of St John the Baptist {{belonged to}} the {{northern}} fortifications of medieval Asenovgrad (then known in Greek as Stenimachos). It was in continuous operation until the late 18th or early 19th century, when it suffered significant damage, perhaps during Ottoman brigand raids. During the reconstruction works which were carried out soon thereafter, the roof and the upper parts of the church were modified. <b>The</b> <b>interior</b> <b>was</b> also repainted at the time.|$|E
5000|$|Of the two body {{configurations}} for low-floor buses, the Gillig Low Floor is a low-entry bus (the front â-Â¾ of <b>the</b> <b>interior</b> <b>is</b> low-floor) with a low-step entry (nearly curb height) {{and integrated}} wheelchair ramp while the rear part of <b>the</b> <b>interior</b> <b>is</b> raised to provide sufficient {{space for the}} powertrain.|$|R
50|$|Some {{parts of}} <b>the</b> {{original}} <b>interior</b> <b>are</b> in <b>the</b> Thurrock Museum, including a magnificent fireplace. Other parts of <b>the</b> <b>interior</b> <b>were</b> rescued when <b>the</b> house was demolished and are displayed at Valence House Museum, Dagenham.|$|R
50|$|The Protestant Church {{was built}} in 1781-82 by Hans Ulrich Haltiner. <b>The</b> <b>interior</b> <b>is</b> {{decorated}} in a Rococo style. <b>The</b> <b>interior</b> work <b>was</b> done in 1782, from the shop of Andreas and Peter Anton Mosbrugger.|$|R
5|$|The rooms {{above the}} {{clockwork}} mechanism {{were used by}} the city administration for various purposes up until the late 20th century, including as archives, storerooms, as a firehose magazine and even as an air raid shelter. <b>The</b> <b>interior</b> <b>was</b> frequently remodelled in a careless, even vandalistic fashion; for instance, all but three of the original wooden beams supporting the intermediate floors were destroyed. Since 1979, the tower's interior is empty again. It is only accessed for maintenance {{and in the course}} of regular guided tours.|$|E
5|$|The two Amtrak tracks {{share an}} island platform; the RTA tracks {{do not have}} any platforms. The {{structure}} has a porte-cochÃ¨re, which protects passengers from inclement weather. <b>The</b> <b>interior</b> <b>was</b> built with a similar design to that of the exterior, and features a central skylight. Shadows from its exposed trusses create different patterns on the brown brick floor, built in a basket-weaved pattern. Exposed ductwork is visible throughout the trusses, as are the light fixtures. All of the ceiling elements are painted white, which tend to recede and produce a sense of airiness which is further enhanced by the floor-to-ceiling windows. Banks of seats are located close to public telephones and a vending area.|$|E
5|$|The western {{entrance}} to the Middle Ward is now open, and a gateway leads north from the ward onto the North Terrace. The eastern exit from the ward is guarded by the Norman Gatehouse. This gatehouse, which, despite its name, dates from the 14th century, is heavily vaulted and decorated with carvings, including surviving medieval lion masks, traditional symbols of majesty, to form an impressive {{entrance to}} the Upper Ward. Wyatville redesigned {{the exterior of the}} gatehouse, and <b>the</b> <b>interior</b> <b>was</b> later heavily converted in the 19th century for residential use.|$|E
