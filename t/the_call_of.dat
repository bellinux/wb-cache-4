25|$|Mothers will {{communicate}} with their offspring though vocalization, and it has even been shown that a mother can discriminate between <b>the</b> <b>calls</b> <b>of</b> its offspring and the offspring of other females. They exhibit more maternal approach behaviors when hearing <b>the</b> <b>calls</b> <b>of</b> their own offspring, and more experienced mothers show more approach behavior as opposed to new mothers.
