5|$|Martello {{defended the}} growing rise of feminists in Wicca during the 1970s, criticizing what he {{deemed to be}} the continual {{repression}} of women within the Pagan movement. He also espoused the view that any Pagan {{who was involved in}} the U.S. government or military was a hypocrite. He was critical of Wiccans who espoused a division between white magic and black magic, commenting that it had racial overtones and <b>that</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> advocating such a view were racist.|$|E
5|$|Construction of {{the station}} was {{complicated}} {{by the need to}} keep the line open: trains ferrying materials were unable to stay on-site for long, and frequently had to switch from one track to the other, necessitating trips to nearby Montpelier railway station, where the nearest crossover points were located. The station finally opened on 12 April 1897. The first train was the 7am service: 94 tickets were issued to Clifton Down, and an estimated 550 passengers bought tickets from the station the same day. Some local writers were sceptical, claiming <b>that</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> first day passengers were not new passengers, but would previously have travelled from Montpelier or Clifton Down. Construction took nine months, and cost £2,000.|$|E

5|$|Dreamtime {{opens with}} the premise <b>that</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> accused of {{witchcraft}} in early modern Christendom had been undergoing visionary journeys {{with the aid of}} a hallucinogenic salve which was suppressed by the Christian authorities. Duerr argues that this salve had been a part of the nocturnal visionary traditions associated with the goddess Diana, and he attempts to trace their origins back to the ancient world, before looking at goddesses associated with the wilderness and arguing that in various goddess-centred cultures, the cave represented a symbolic vagina and was used for birth rituals.|$|E
5|$|Nearly 4,000 {{species of}} fungi, {{including}} lichen-forming {{species have been}} recorded from Malaysia. Of the two fungal groups with {{the largest number of}} species in Malaysia, the Ascomycota and their asexual states have been surveyed in some habitats (decaying wood, marine and freshwater ecosystems, as parasites of some plants, and as agents of biodegradation), but have not been or have been only poorly surveyed in other habitats (as endobionts, in soils, on dung, as human and animal pathogens); the Basidiomycota are only partly surveyed: bracket fungi, and mushrooms and toadstools have been studied, but Malaysian rust and smut fungi remain very poorly known. Without doubt, many more fungal species in Malaysia have not yet been recorded, and it is likely <b>that</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>those,</b> when found, will be new to science.|$|E
5|$|In February 1931, {{the woods}} were {{included}} in a sale by King's College to the urban district council. Park Wood was sold for £28,100, with Manor Farm and the old Post Office included {{as a gift to}} the people of Ruislip. King's had also wished to present the wood as a gift but was required by the University and College's Act to receive payment as it was the trustee of the land. Middlesex County Council contributed 75% of the cost, as the urban district council argued <b>that</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> who would make use of the land would be recreational day-trippers from outside the district. Under a 999-year lease, the council agreed to maintain the wood and ensure no new building was constructed without the permission of the county council.

5|$|In {{response}} to the revolt, the Aćimović administration encouraged 545 or 546 prominent and influential Serbs to sign the Appeal to the Serbian Nation, {{which was published in}} the German-authorised Belgrade daily newspaper Novo vreme on 13 and 14 August. Those that signed included three Serbian Orthodox bishops, four archpriests, and at least 81 professors from the University of Belgrade, although according to the historian Stevan K. Pavlowitch, many of the signatories were placed under pressure to sign, and Professor Jozo Tomasevich notes <b>that</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> who signed it were known for their leftist views. The appeal called upon the Serbian population to help the authorities in every way in their struggle against the communist rebels, and called for loyalty to the Nazis, condemning the Partisan-led resistance as unpatriotic. The Serbian Bar Association unanimously supported the Appeal. The Aćimović administration also appealed for rebels {{to return to their homes}} and announced bounties for the killing of rebels and their leaders. Aćimović also gave orders that the wives of communists and their sons older than 16 years of age be arrested and held, and the Germans burned their houses and imposed curfews.|$|E
5|$|Manor Farm and {{the local}} woods {{eventually}} avoided demolition in January 1930, after the visit {{by a member of}} the Royal Society of Arts to choose the buildings that should be conserved. The Great Barn and Little Barn were singled out from the site, together with the old post office, the Old Bell public house and the Priest's House of the local church.

5|$|The {{protection}} of Manor Farm {{and the local}} woods from redevelopment was eventually confirmed in January 1930, after a visit {{by a member of}} the Royal Society of Arts to choose buildings that should be conserved. The Great Barn and Little Barn were selected, along with the old Post Office, the Old Bell public house and the Priest's House of the local church. The woods, part of the centre of the manor of Ruislip along with Ruislip village square, were included when King's College sold the land to the district in February 1931.

60|$|The {{history of}} the Cheyennes is <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> {{wandering}} tribes <b>of</b> the prairies. They were the remnant of a once powerful people called the Shaways, inhabiting {{a branch of the}} Red River which flows into Lake Winnipeg. Every Indian tribe has some rival tribe with which it wages implacable hostility. The deadly enemies of the Shaways were the Sioux, who, after a long course of warfare, proved too powerful for them, and drove them across the Missouri. They again took root near the Warricanne Creek, and established themselves there in a fortified village.|$|R

25|$|To {{what extent}} the various {{individuals}} were involved with Soviet intelligence is a topic of dispute.

25|$|Trepanation {{is perhaps}} the oldest {{surgical}} procedure {{for which there is}} archaeological evidence, and in some areas may have been quite widespread.

Many prehistoric and premodern patients had signs of their skull structure healing, suggesting <b>that</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> subjected to the surgery survived. Another skull with a trepanation hole was found at burial site Chalaghantepe (Agdam Rayon, Azerbaijan) dated to the 5th millennium BC.|$|E

From here, they were raiding not only foreign lands but were also attacking Norway itself. He {{organised}} a fleet {{and was able to}} subdue the rebels, and in doing so brought the independent Jarls under his control, many of the rebels having fled to Iceland. He found himself ruling not only Norway, but the Isles, Man and parts of Scotland.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{striking}} aspects of the organization of the Inquisition was its form of financing: devoid of its own budget, the Inquisition depended exclusively on the confiscation of the goods of the denounced. It is not surprising, therefore, <b>that</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> prosecuted were rich men. That the situation was open to abuse is evident, as stands out in the memorial that a converso from Toledo directed to Charles I: Your Majesty must provide, before all else, that the expenses of the Holy Office do not come from the properties of the condemned, because if that is the case, if they do not burn they do not eat.|$|E

25|$|According to Andrew Beveridge, a Professor of Sociology at Queens College, between 2000 and 2005, {{young women}} in their twenties earned more than their male {{counterparts}} in some large urban centers, including Dallas (120%), New York (117%), Chicago, Boston, and Minneapolis. A major {{reason for this is that}} women have been graduating from college in larger numbers than men, and <b>that</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> women seem to be gravitating toward major urban areas. In 2005, 53% of women in their 20s working in New York were college graduates, compared with only 38% of men of that age. Nationwide, the wages of that group of women averaged 89% of the average full-time pay for men between 2000 and 2005.|$|E

People were also asked about their nationality, including Faroese. Children under 15 were not asked about their nationality. 97% said that they were ethnic Faroese, which means <b>that</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> who were born in either Denmark or Greenland consider themselves as ethnic Faroese.
