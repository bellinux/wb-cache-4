25|$|According to Pamela Lutgin-Sandvik, {{the lack}} of unifying {{language}} to name the phenomenon of workplace bullying is a problem because without a unifying term or phrase, individuals have difficulty naming their experiences of abuse, and therefore have trouble pursuing justice against <b>the</b> <b>bully.</b> Unlike sexual harassment, which named a specific problem and is now recognized in law of many countries (including U.S.), workplace bullying is still being established as a relevant social problem and {{is in need of}} a specific vernacular.|$|E

One woman had been listed as a political opponent on a pro-trans website due to misunderstandings and alternating views, which resulted in targeted messages and harassment. The listed person in question did not actually have any reservations against the trans community, and so they ended up being <b>the</b> <b>bullied</b> person.
