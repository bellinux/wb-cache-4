5|$|Before Tiberius, {{the heirs}} of Augustus were {{the sons of}} Marcus Agrippa, Gaius and Lucius Caesar, whom he adopted and made heir. They {{advanced}} through their careers at <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>pace</b> {{and were going to}} rule together; however, they died young, forcing Augustus to draw another line of succession. In AD 4, Augustus adopted Tiberius on condition that Tiberius adopt Germanicus. This made Tiberius the heir of Augustus, and Germanicus the heir of Tiberius. Like the sons of Agrippa, it was the intention of Augustus that Germanicus and Drusus would rule together.|$|E
5|$|Just as Agrippa's sons were, Drusus {{was about}} the same age as Germanicus, and both of them also {{followed}} parallel careers. Drusus and Germanicus held all their offices at the same age, and progressed through the cursus honorum at <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>pace.</b> Both held the office of quaestor at the same age, both were exempted from holding the praetorship, they held their first and second consulships at the same age, and both were given proconsular imperium maius when they were sent to govern Germania and Illyricum respectively.|$|E
5|$|Following his {{break-out}} season, the Predators and Hamhuis {{agreed to}} a four-year, $8 million contract on September 21, 2006. He earned $1.5 million {{in his first year}} of the deal, gradually increasing to $2.5 million in his fourth. His offensive production dipped to a career-low 20 points in the season following the signing. In 2007–08, he recorded four goals and 27 points over 80 games. Hamhuis scored his first Stanley Cup playoff goal in game four of the opening round against the Detroit Red Wings, a 3–2 win. However, Nashville lost the next two games and were eliminated. Hamhuis continued scoring at <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>pace</b> in the following two seasons, recording 26 and 24 points in 2008–09 and 2009–10, respectively.|$|E

5|$|In New Zealand, Neighbours is {{broadcast}} on TV2 at 6:30 pm weekdays. In October 2010, it began airing episodes at <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>pace</b> as Australia. The show was initially broadcast by TVNZ in 1988, but by 1996 it {{was removed from}} the schedule. TV4 (now C4) picked the show up and began broadcasting it from 1997. They dropped it in 2000 and it returned to TV2 in 2002. Repeats of the previous day's episode of Neighbours were formerly shown at 2:30 pm weekdays and are now shown at 11.00 am weekdays. The show moved to 5:25 pm weeknights on TV One in late 2007. After a couple of months, the show moved to 3:50 pm weekdays. The show eventually moved back to TV2. The TV2 website offers viewers the chance to watch episodes online with its OnDemand service.|$|E
5|$|Arcidiacono {{attended}} Neshaminy High School, {{where he}} was coached by Jerry Devine. Arcidiacono led the team to a PIAA Class AAAA tournament as a sophomore. In a playoff game against Bartram High School, he tallied a triple-double of 26 points, 10 rebounds, and 10 assists. He averaged 18 points per game and {{was named to the}} Class AAAA second team. At the end of his sophomore season, Arcidiacono travelled with his AAU team, the PA Playaz, to North Carolina for the Bob Gibbons Tournament of Champions. In {{the first game of the}} tournament, he crashed into the floor face-first, an injury that required eight stitches. Despite the advice of doctors, he decided to play in the following game, and responded with 35 points. He continued to score at <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>pace</b> for the remainder of the tournament, and major college programs took notice. Arcidiacono received recruiting offers from Syracuse, Florida, Texas, and Villanova, among others. In October 2010, after attending Villanova's Hoops Mania event, he committed to play for the Villanova Wildcats.|$|E
5|$|For {{the three}} {{sections}} of the ride where wrap-around projection is used, each robotic arm continues its steady movement on the track but is met by its own individual parabolic projection screen and projector traveling at exactly <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>pace.</b> Each projection section uses a huge turntable with six of these enormous screens mounted facing outwards - one for each robotic arm as they pass by - and each screen is large enough that when {{in front of each}} ride bench its edges cannot be seen. The screens appear and disappear behind the edges of the physical sets. The robotic arms can then freely dive, turn and pivot each ride bench within the curved area, giving the illusion of extreme movement when synchronized with the projection, whilst the base of the arm on the track simply follows the slow circular path that each screen takes as it revolves. This is why each projection section of the ride is approximately the same length, as each ride arm must follow each identically-sized projection screen turntable for a set period of time.|$|E

Glenn Erickson of DVD Talk wrote, [...] "As interpreted here, the revue format has <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>pacing</b> problems that a stack of music videos would have if there were not enough variety. Many of the songs are amusing or emotional, {{but after a while}} too many seem similar - a plaintive half-melody that slowly rises in intensity and volume, until the singer is practically screaming. The elaborate scene changes don't help the fact that we're not seeing live performances - the frantic singers are mouthing to playback, which robs the material of its stage immediacy." ...|$|R

5|$|The Red Army's 3rd Tank Army {{began to}} engage German units south of Kharkov, {{performing}} a holding action while Manstein's offensive continued. By 24 February, the Wehrmacht had pulled the Großdeutschland Division off the line, leaving the 167th and 320th infantry divisions, a regiment from the Totenkopf division and elements from the Leibstandarte division {{to defend the}} Western edge of the bulge created by the Soviet offensive. Between 24–27 February, the 3rd Tank Army and 69th Army continued to attack {{this portion of the}} German line, but without much success. With supporting Soviet units stretched thin, the attack began to falter. On 25 February, Rokossovky's Central Front launched their offensive between the German Second and Third Panzer Armies, with encouraging results along the German flanks, but struggling to keep <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>pace</b> {{in the center of the}} attack. As the offensive progressed, the attack on the German right flank also began to stagnate in the face of increased resistance, while the attack on the left began to over-extend itself.|$|E
5|$|The {{race was}} resumed on lap 13 and Button, who had changed to {{intermediate}} tyres before the safety car period, {{was given a}} drive-through penalty for speeding behind the safety car, emerging in 15th place. Vettel began to enlarge his lead over Alonso and Massa in second and third. Alonso and the Mercedes pitted for intermediate tyres, leaving Massa in second and Kobayashi in third by lap 17. Barrichello, who switched for intermediates as the safety car came in, began setting times at <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>pace</b> as the leaders, and gained 15th position as the drivers in front changed tyres. On lap 19, a rain storm arrived at the circuit, forcing the drivers on intermediate tyres to switch back to full wets. Alonso and Button, who were in fifth and eighth respectively, fell to ninth and eleventh, while the drivers on the full wet tyres began pitting for fresh wet tyres. The safety car was brought out on lap 20 due to {{the intensity of the}} rain, and Vettel, Webber, Massa and Buemi, who had not changed tyres, went to the pitlane for fresh full wets. After six laps under the safety car, the conditions were getting worse, and the race was suspended.|$|E

The novel proves again - if any doubters still remain - that women can write about physical functions just as frankly and, when the genes move them, as raunchily as men. It strikes a blow for the picara by putting a heroine through <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>paces</b> that once animated a Tom Jones or a Holden Caulfield.

40|$|The {{issue of}} {{excessive}} vibration of footbridges due to pedestrian loading is now well documented. Bridge vibrations produced from {{a crowd of}} pedestrians have been estimated by modifying the effect caused by a single pedestrian by an enhancement factor to take crowd synchronization into account. In this paper this approach is extended {{to account for the}} fact that all pedestrians will not have <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>pacing</b> frequencies, and <b>the</b> effects of distributions of pacing frequency and other parameters on the enhancement factor are investigated. It is shown that this more faithful representation of pedestrian crowd walking behaviour gives reduced vibration response compared to the fully homogenous crowd case. Based on these results, enhancement factors for predicting the response due to a crowd from the predicted accelerations of a single pedestrian are proposed. Further, the results are compared with published test results to indicate that the model is reasonable...|$|R

He was seconded by his devoted disciple and godson, the endocrinologist Ștefan Milcu (he eventually left Rainer's team in 1932, after developing an allergy to formaldehyde). Other important presences among Rainer's students and collaborators were George Emil Palade and Vintilă Ciocâlteu, distinguished for their work in the United States.
