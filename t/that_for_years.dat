5|$|The {{release of}} Invincible {{was preceded by}} a dispute between Jackson and his record label, Sony Music Entertainment. Jackson had {{expected}} the licenses to the masters of his albums to revert to him {{some time in the}} early 2000s, after which {{he would be able to}} promote the material however he pleased and keep the profits; however, clauses in the contract set the revert date years into the future. Jackson discovered that the attorney who had represented him in the deal had also been representing Sony. He was also concerned <b>that</b> <b>for</b> <b>years</b> Sony had been pressuring him to sell his share in its music catalog venture; he feared that Sony might have had a conflict of interest, since if Jackson's career failed, he would have had to sell his share of the catalog at a low price. Jackson sought an early exit from his contract.|$|E

The Mavericks made a strong playoff push following the trade, but despite a 51–31 record, they were only able to secure the seventh seed in the highly competitive Western Conference.

500|$|According {{to music}} {{journalist}} Richie Unterberger, Tommy was hailed by contemporary critics as the Who's breakthrough, but its critical standing diminished {{slightly in the}} subsequent decades, because of its occasionally pretentious concept and flimsy songs that functioned as devices to [...] "advance the rather sketchy plot." [...] Christgau wrote in 1983, [...] "Tommys operatic pretensions were so transparent <b>that</b> <b>for</b> <b>years</b> it seemed safe to guess that Townshend's musical ideas would never catch up with his lyrics." [...] In his review for AllMusic, Unterberger said that, despite its slight flaws, the album has [...] "many excellent songs" [...] permeated with [...] "a suitably powerful grace", while Townshend's ability to devise a lengthy narrative introduced [...] "new possibilities to rock music." [...] Uncut wrote that the album [...] "doesn't quite realise its ambitions, though it achieves {{a lot on the}} way", and felt it was not as well developed as their later album, Quadrophenia. Mark Kemp, writing in The Rolling Stone Album Guide (2004), felt that [...] "in retrospect, Tommy isn't quite the masterpiece it was originally hyped to be", suggesting The Who Sell Out was better, though because of Townshend, it produced several [...] "bona fide classic songs".|$|E

Hanneman and his family had apparently been unaware of the extent of condition until shortly before his death. King has announced his desire for the band to continue, but Araya was more uncertain, stating, [...] "After 30 years, it would literally be like starting over," [...] and expressing doubts that Slayer's fanbase would approve of such a change. In March 2015, Araya revealed that the band had recorded one song prior to Hanneman's passing, and that the song would appear on the album. The result was the song [...] "Piano Wire". Araya explained that Hanneman would be a part on the album when King later dismissed the claim saying, [...] "Jeff Hanneman isn't physically playing on this record. Somebody reported some bullshit. People say shit when they don't know what's actually going on. Even though Jeff's song, [...] "Piano Wire", was recorded during the last album cycle, I played all the guitar.

500|$|With Hollywood's {{wholesale}} {{adoption of}} the talkies, the competition between the two fundamental approaches to sound-film production was soon resolved. Over the course of 1930–31, the only major players using sound-on-disc, Warner Bros. and First National, changed over to sound-on-film recording. Vitaphone's dominating presence in sound-equipped theaters, however, meant <b>that</b> <b>for</b> <b>years</b> to come all of the Hollywood studios pressed and distributed sound-on-disc versions of their films alongside the sound-on-film prints. Fox Movietone soon followed Vitaphone into disuse as a recording and reproduction method, leaving two major American systems: the variable-area RCA Photophone and Western Electric's own variable-density process, a substantial improvement on the cross-licensed Movietone. Under RCA's instigation, the two parent companies made their projection equipment compatible, meaning films shot with one system could be screened in theaters equipped for the other. This left one big issue—the Tobis-Klangfilm challenge. In May 1930, Western Electric won an Austrian lawsuit that voided protection for certain Tri-Ergon patents, helping bring Tobis-Klangfilm to the negotiating table. The following month an accord was reached on patent cross-licensing, full playback compatibility, and {{the division of the}} world into three parts for the provision of equipment.

500|$|Walton's first {{work for}} full orchestra, Portsmouth Point (1925), {{inspired}} by a Rowlandson print of the same name, depicts a rumbustious dockside scene (in Kennedy's phrase, [...] "the sailors of H.M.S. Pinafore have had {{a night on the}} tiles") in a fast moving score full of syncopation and cross-rhythm <b>that</b> <b>for</b> <b>years</b> proved hazardous for conductors and orchestras alike. Throughout his career, Walton wrote works in this pattern, such as the lively Comedy Overture Scapino, a virtuoso piece commissioned by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, described by The Musical Times as [...] "an ingenious blending of fragments in exhilarating profusion." [...] Walton's post-war works in this genre are the Johannesburg Festival Overture (1956), the [...] "diverting but hard-edged Capriccio burlesco" [...] (1968), and the longer Partita (1957), written for the Cleveland Orchestra, described by Grove as [...] "an impressively concentrated score with a high-spirited finale [...] steely counterpoint and orchestral virtuosity". Walton's shorter pieces also include two tributes to musical colleagues, Variations on a Theme by Hindemith (1963) and the Improvisations on an Impromptu of Benjamin Britten (1969), in both of which the source material is gradually transformed as Walton's own voice becomes more prominent. The critic Hugh Ottaway commented that in both pieces [...] "the interaction of two musical personalities is... fascinating".|$|E

[...] According to Newsinger, although Orwell [...] "was always critical of the 1945–51 Labour government's moderation, his support for it began to pull him to the right politically. This did not lead him to embrace conservatism, imperialism or reaction, but to defend, albeit critically, Labour reformism." [...] Between 1945 and 1947, with A. J.

2500|$|On 15 July 1971, 17 UN members, led by Albania, {{requested}} that {{a question of}} the [...] "Restoration of the lawful rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations" [...] be placed on the provisional agenda of the twenty-sixth session of the UN General Assembly. In an explanatory memorandum accompanying their request, the 17 UN members observed <b>that</b> <b>for</b> <b>years</b> they had protested against the hostile and discriminatory policy followed by several governments with regard to the lawful government of China, the sole genuine representative of the Chinese people. The existence of the People's Republic of China, they declared, was a reality which could not be changed to suit the myth of a so-called [...] "Republic of China" [...] fabricated out of a portion of Chinese territory. In the view of the 17 UN members the unlawful authorities installed in the island of Taiwan claiming to represent China, remained there only because of the permanent presence of United States armed forces. No important international problems, they added, could be solved without the participation of the People's Republic of China. It was in the fundamental interests, they concluded, of the United Nations to restore promptly to the People's Republic of China its seat in the organization thus putting an end to a grave injustice and dangerous situation which had been perpetuated in order to fulfill a policy that had been increasingly repudiated. This meant the immediate expulsion of the representatives of the Chiang Kai-shek regime from the seat which it unlawfully holds in the United Nations.|$|E
