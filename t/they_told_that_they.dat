Yashoda wondered how to find Tuljabai and how to exchange the kids, for which Vrajlal said that since they cannot find Tuljabai, it's better to forget about that and raise up the kid as their son. So Yashoda told Vrajlal that she will wait for Tuljabai her whole life. So Yashoda raised up Taljabai's son as Krish.|$|E

They used most of the concepts of scientific practices, but 3 groups mentioned curiosity and 4 groups included the component of asking questions in the concept map they made in addition to the concepts in BRH. One group used the concept of argumentation in the concept map they made.

30|$|When hiring credits {{target the}} disadvantaged, “stigmatization” of those {{eligible}} for the credits can reduce their impact. In particular, eligibility of workers for targeted hiring credits can provide information to employers {{that they have been}} unsuccessful in the labor market, which can lead employers to regard eligible workers as risky or as less productive, offsetting the potential impact of the hiring credit (Dickert-Conlin and Holtz-Eakin, 2000; Katz, 1998). There is evidence suggesting that narrow targeting of hiring credits stigmatizes the intended beneficiaries, dissipating the effects of the credits. A striking example is an experimental program for welfare recipients in Dayton, Ohio, under the Targeted Jobs Tax Credit (TJTC) (Burtless, 1985). One group received vouchers that they could present to employers for direct cash rebate subsidies, a second group received vouchers that let employers claim hiring credits under one of two existing programs, and a third group was {{eligible for the}} same credits, but neither received vouchers to give to employers nor were <b>they</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were eligible. The third group had the most success in finding employment. Given that assignment to groups was random, so that the only difference was the information given to employers and workers, it is plausible to interpret the worse outcomes for those with vouchers as indicating adverse stigma effects that reduced the effect of the hiring credits.|$|E
40|$|Background and purpose: Training {{in basic}} {{clinical}} and procedural skills {{is considered an}} important part of the core medical undergraduate curriculum. There are some reasons to assume that junior doctors are not adequately trained in these skills. Due to the lack of enough information on skills competence of our students, this study was designed in 3 medical schools in southern Iran to evaluate whether students expectations of current training programs are fulfilled. Method: The subjects of this study were 7 th year medical students at Shiraz, Jahrom and Fassa Medical Schools in southern Iran. Through a questionnaire the students were asked to rate the necessity of each procedure (importance rating) and the quality of preparation based on a Likert’s scale (from 1 as not at all important or prepared to 5 as very important or well prepared) and also the frequency of doing such procedures during their education. Results: In spite of the fact that the students found such procedures as chest tube insertion, IV cannulation, splinting, joint aspiration, cardiopulmonary cerebral resuscitation, pleural and peritoneal fluid aspiration, pelvic examination, pap smear, phlebotomy, urinary catheterization and supra pubic aspiration very important, <b>they</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> had not been well prepared to do them. Procedural skills that at least 50 % of the respondents performed less than 2 times were: chest tube insertion, IV cannulation, splinting, joint aspiration, pleural and peritoneal fluid aspiration, pelvic examination, pap smear, cardio pulmonary cerebral resuscitation and supra pubic aspiration. Conclusion: Training in procedural skills needs to be given more attention and improved in the medical curriculum. Keywords: CLINICAL SKILLS, COMPETENCY, SKILL TRAINING...|$|E
