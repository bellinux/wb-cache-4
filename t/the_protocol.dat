5|$|In most countries, <b>the</b> <b>protocol</b> of {{the head}} of state comes before all others; however, in the EU the Parliament is listed as the first institution, and hence <b>the</b> <b>protocol</b> of its President comes before any other European, or national, protocol.

In 1985 a new edition of <b>the</b> <b>Protocols</b> was printed and widely distributed by the Islamic Propagation Organization, International Relations Department, in Tehran. The Astan Quds Razavi Foundation in Mashhad, Iran, one of the wealthiest institutions in Iran, financed publication of <b>the</b> <b>Protocols</b> in 1994. Parts of <b>the</b> <b>Protocols</b> were published by the daily Jomhouri-e Eslami in 1994, under the heading The Smell of Blood, Zionist Schemes.

5|$|Notably, {{during the}} 1960s, the Soviet General Secretary Nikita Khrushchev asked the {{communist}} leader of Albania Enver Hoxha about giving autonomy to the minority, but this initiative was without any result. The autonomy question {{remains one of}} the main issues on the diplomatic agenda in Albanian-Greek relations, {{after the collapse of the}} communist regime in Albania (1991). Moreover, a certain degree of autonomy, based on the terms of <b>the</b> <b>Protocol</b> of Corfu, is the main objective of the organization Omonoia, as well as the Unity for Human Rights Party, which represents the Greek minority in the Albanian government. Such proposals were rejected in 1991 by the Albanian government, thus spurring Omonoia's radical wing to call for Union with Greece. In another incident, in 1993, Omonoia’s chairman was immediately arrested by the Albanian police, after explaining in public that the goal of the Greek minority was autonomy inside the Albanian borders, based on the terms of <b>the</b> <b>Protocol.</b>|$|E

In this paper, we use multiprotocol strand spaces ([27], cf. [28]) to prove that two cryptographic protocols are independent if they use encryption in non-overlapping ways. This theorem (Proposition 7. 2) applies even if <b>the</b> <b>protocols</b> share public key certificates and secret key “tickets. ” We use the method of [8, 7] to study penetrator paths, namely sequences of penetrator actions connecting regular nodes (message transmissions or receptions) in <b>the</b> two <b>protocols.</b> Of special interest are inbound linking paths, which lead from a message transmission in <b>the</b> secondary <b>protocol</b> to a message reception in <b>the</b> primary <b>protocol.</b> We show that bundles can be modified to remove all inbound linking paths, if encryption does not overlap in <b>the</b> two <b>protocols.</b> <b>The</b> resulting bundle {{does not depend on}} any activity of <b>the</b> secondary <b>protocol.</b> We illustrate this method using <b>the</b> Neuman-Stubblebine <b>protocol</b> as an example [21, 27]. ...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a {{light-weight}} provably-secure authentication <b>protocol</b> called <b>the</b> NLHB <b>protocol,</b> {{which is a}} variant of <b>the</b> HB <b>protocol.</b> <b>The</b> HB <b>protocol</b> uses <b>the</b> complexity of decoding linear codes for security against passive attacks. In contrast, security for <b>the</b> NLHB <b>protocol</b> is proved by reducing passive attacks {{to the problem of}} decoding a class of non-linear codes that are provably hard. We demonstrate that the existing passive attacks on <b>the</b> HB <b>protocol</b> family, which have contributed to considerable reduction in its effective key-size, are ineffective against <b>the</b> NLHB <b>protocol.</b> From <b>the</b> evidence, we conclude that smaller-key sizes are sufficient for <b>the</b> NLHB <b>protocol</b> to achieve <b>the</b> same level of passive attack security as <b>the</b> HB <b>Protocol.</b> Further, for this choice of parameters, we provide an implementation instance for <b>the</b> NLHB <b>protocol</b> for which <b>the</b> Prover/Verifier complexity is lower than <b>the</b> HB <b>protocol,</b> enabling authentication on very low-cost devices like RFID tags.

40|$|We present {{protocols}} {{for speeding}} up fixed-base exponentiation and variable-base exponentiation using an untrusted computation resource. In <b>the</b> fixed-base <b>protocols,</b> <b>the</b> base and exponent may be blinded. If the exponent is fixed, the base may be blinded in <b>the</b> variable-base exponentiation <b>protocols.</b> <b>The</b> <b>protocols</b> are <b>the</b> first ones for accelerating exponentiation {{with the aid}} of an untrusted resource in arbitrary cyclic groups. We also describe how to use <b>the</b> <b>protocols</b> to construct protocols that do, {{with the aid of}} an untrusted resource, exponentiation modular an integer where the modulus is the product of primes with single multiplicity.
