5|$|Coandă was {{interested}} in achieving reactive propelled flight as early as 1905, conducting tests of rockets attached to model aircraft at the Romanian Army arsenal in Bucharest. In secret, at Spandau in Germany, Coandă successfully <b>tested</b> <b>a</b> flying machine equipped with a single tractor propeller, and two counter-rotating propellers providing lift, powered by a 50-horsepower (37kW) Antoinette engine. Positioned along the fuselage centreline, the smaller rear lift propeller was mounted vertically, while the larger front one was inclined slightly forwards at 17degrees. According to later claims, Coandă tested the aircraft at Cassel, witnessed by the Chancellor of the German Empire Bernhard von Bülow. It was around this time that Coandă's interest in jet propulsion began, claiming that the aircraft and a jet-propelled model were displayed in December 1907 at the Sporthalle indoor sports arena in Berlin.|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: We {{evaluated}} {{pelvic floor}} muscle (PFM) behavior during Valsalva leak point pressure (VLPP) measurement in {{males and females}} affected by stress urinary incontinence and investigated whether VLPP results are influenced by PFM contraction. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 25 females and 14 males underwent surface electromyographic (EMG) recording of PFM activity while performing VLPP. We investigated 2 conditions, VLPP during spontaneous strain (<b>test</b> <b>A),</b> and with simultaneous relaxation of the pelvic floor (test B). We analyzed average EMG activity (microV) at rest and during VLPP in <b>tests</b> <b>A</b> and B, the increasing EMG activity during <b>tests</b> <b>A</b> and B (the difference between average EMG activity during <b>tests</b> <b>A</b> and B and at rest), and the mean duration (seconds) of EMG activity during <b>tests</b> <b>A</b> and B. RESULTS: We detected {{a significant increase in}} EMG activity during <b>tests</b> <b>A</b> and B as compared to activity at rest (p < 0. 0001). Increasing EMG activity during test B was significantly reduced in females (p < 0. 05) but not in males. During <b>test</b> <b>A</b> patients reporting urinary incontinence showed a significantly lower EMG activity than that of continent patients (p < 0. 05). A significant reduction in maximum abdominal pressure was detected in test B compared to <b>test</b> <b>A,</b> but {{there was no difference in}} VLPP values between <b>tests</b> <b>A</b> and B. CONCLUSIONS: PFM activity significantly increases during VLPP measurement. Eliminating muscular contraction of the pelvic floor does not significantly alter VLPP results...|$|R

As the ship's stability and manoeuvrability were being <b>tested,</b> <b>a</b> flaw in her design was discovered. When attempting to steer the ship solely through altering propeller revolutions, the crew learned that Bismarck could be kept on course only with great difficulty. Even with the outboard screws running at full power in opposite directions, they generated only a slight turning ability. Bismarcks main battery guns were first test-fired in late November. The tests proved she was a very stable gun platform. Trials lasted until December; Bismarck returned to Hamburg, arriving on 9 December, for minor alterations and the completion of the fitting-out process.|$|E
5|$|Osteogenesis imperfecta, {{known as}} brittle bone disease, is an incurable genetic bone {{disorder}} {{which can be}} lethal. Those with the disease are unable to make functional connective bone tissue. This is most commonly due to a mutation in Type-I collagen, which fulfills a variety of structural roles and is the most abundant protein in mammals. The mutation causes a deformation in collagen's triple helix structure, which if not naturally destroyed, leads to abnormal and weakened bone tissue. In 2005, Folding@home <b>tested</b> <b>a</b> new quantum mechanical method that improved upon prior simulation methods, and which may be useful for future computing studies of collagen.

5|$|Renault had {{introduced}} turbocharged engines to Formula One in 1977. Brabham had <b>tested</b> <b>a</b> BMW four-cylinder M12 turbocharged engine {{in the summer}} of 1981. For the 1982 season the team designed a new car, the BT50, around the BMW engine which, like the Repco engine 16 years before, was based on a road car engine block, the BMW M10. Brabham continued to run the Cosworth-powered BT49D {{in the early part of}} the season while reliability and driveability issues with the BMW units were resolved. The relationship came close to ending, with the German manufacturer insisting that Brabham use their engine. The turbo car took its first win at the Canadian Grand Prix. In the Constructors' Championship, the team finished fifth, the drivers Riccardo Patrese, who scored the last win of the Brabham-Ford combination in the Monaco Grand Prix, 10th and World Champion Piquet a mere 11th in the Drivers' Championship. In the 1983 season, Piquet took the championship lead from Renault's Alain Prost at the last race of the year, the South African Grand Prix to become the first driver to win the Formula One Drivers' World Championship with a turbo-powered car. The team did not win the Constructors' Championship in either 1981 or 1983, despite Piquet's success. Riccardo Patrese was the only driver other than Piquet to win a race for Brabham in this period—the drivers in the second car contributed only a fraction of the team's points in each of these championship seasons.
