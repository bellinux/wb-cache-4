50|$|There are {{two types}} of {{catalytic}} <b>converter,</b> a <b>two-way</b> and a three-way <b>converter.</b> <b>Two-way</b> <b>converters</b> were common until the 1980s, when three-way converters replaced them on most automobile engines. See the catalytic converter article for further details.|$|R
5000|$|The first {{widespread}} {{introduction of}} catalytic converters {{was in the}} United States automobile market. To comply with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's stricter regulation of exhaust emissions, most gasoline-powered vehicles starting with the 1975 model year must be equipped with catalytic converters. These [...] "two-way" [...] converters combined oxygen with carbon monoxide (CO) and unburned hydrocarbons (HC) to produce carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O). In 1981, <b>two-way</b> catalytic <b>converters</b> were rendered obsolete by [...] "three-way" [...] converters that also reduce oxides of nitrogen (NOx); however, <b>two-way</b> <b>converters</b> are still used for lean-burn engines. This is because three-way-converters require either rich or stoichiometric combustion to successfully reduce NOx.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{three-way}} {{catalytic converter}} systems have air injection systems with the air injected between the first (NOx reduction) and second (HC and CO oxidation) stages of the <b>converter.</b> As in <b>two-way</b> <b>converters,</b> this injected air provides oxygen for the oxidation reactions. An upstream air injection point, ahead of the catalytic converter, is also sometimes present to provide additional oxygen only during the engine warm up period. This causes unburned fuel to ignite in the exhaust tract, thereby preventing it reaching the catalytic converter at all. This technique reduces the engine runtime needed for the catalytic converter to reach its [...] "light-off" [...] or operating temperature.|$|R
40|$|Abstract We {{study the}} {{strategic}} choice of compatibility between two initially incompatible network goods in a two‐stage game played by an incumbent and an entrant firm. Compatibility may {{be achieved by}} means of a converter. We derive a number of results under different assumptions {{about the nature of the}} converter (one‐way vs two‐way), the existence of property rights and the possibility of side payments. With incompatibility, entry deterrence occurs for sufficiently strong network effects. In the case of a <b>two‐way</b> <b>converter,</b> which can only be supplied by the incumbent, incompatibility will result in equilibrium unless side payments are allowed and the network externalities are sufficiently low. When both firms can build a one‐way converter and there are no property rights on the necessary technical specifications, the unique equilibrium involves full compatibility. Finally, when each firm has property rights on its technical specifications, full incompatibility is observed at the equilibrium with no side payments; when these are allowed the entrant sells access to its network to the incumbent which refuses to do the same and asymmetric one‐way compatibility results in equilibrium.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an effort launched in 2006 by the OpenECG network, {{led by the}} Graz University of Technology and supported by IEEE 1073, ISO 11073 and CEN TC 251 to create a <b>two-way</b> <b>converter</b> in C++ between the SCP-ECG and the HL 7 aECG standards. In the conversion, GDF, the BioSig internal data format, {{was used as an}} intermediate structure. This design approach allowed people with different expertise {{to be involved in the}} implementation of the converter. ECG data sets from the OpenECG portal were used to test the converter. However, some data mapping problems were identified. In fact, the SCP-ECG standard includes clinical data of the patient such as blood pressure, weight, and height, etc, which are not part of the HL 7 aECG standard. Moreover, the annotations of HL 7 aECG can be translated to GDF events, but, currently the only way SCP-ECG might support HL 7 aECG annotations or GDF events is by using custom tags or sections. The first version of the converter has been released in open source to be tested by the BioSig and OpenECG communities. Some data mapping issues remain open in this first release. However, it is the expectation of the OpenECG community that they will be addressed in the collaboration among the relevant Standard Developing Organizations as a critical step towards the improvement of interoperability in electrocardiography. 1...|$|E
40|$|In many {{high-tech}} industries, {{the emergence}} of new digital technologies allows companies to develop converters to overcome technology incompatibility. In this paper, we analyze the effects of converter introduction on the adoption process of competing, incompatible technologies in the presence of network externalities. Converter introduction may accelerate, extend or reverse the technology lock-in process. We determine which conversion options are profitable for weak as well as for dominant incumbents, depending on the timing of converter introduction and the degrees of conversion. We find that the optimal strategy for weak incumbents is to introduce full one-way converters early. For dominant incumbents, the optimal conversion option is to provide <b>two-way</b> <b>converters</b> with partial compatibility for the users of the competing network at a later introduction time. We illustrate our analytical results with numerical examples. compatibility, consumer choice, converter, network externality, standards war, technology adoption,...|$|R

50|$|Temperature sensors {{are used}} for two purposes. The first is as a warning system, {{typically}} on <b>two-way</b> catalytic <b>converters</b> such as are still sometimes used on LPG forklifts. The function of the sensor is to warn of catalytic converter temperature above the safe limit of 750 C. More-recent catalytic-converter designs are not as susceptible to temperature damage and can withstand sustained temperatures of 900 C. Temperature sensors are also used to monitor catalyst functioning: usually two sensors will be fitted, with one before the catalyst and one after to monitor the temperature rise over the catalytic-converter core.|$|R

A <b>two-way</b> catalytic <b>converter</b> and an air pump to reduce hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions was incorporated into the exhaust system.
