5|$|After a {{training}} camp near Nice in southern France Simpson rode in the one-day Kuurne–Brussels–Kuurne in Belgium, finishing second to 's Arthur Decabooter.

In Paris–Nice, his tyre punctured during stage four, losing five minutes and used the rest of the race for training.|$|E
5|$|Capodacqua of La Repubblica {{believed}} that the route favored a rider that could defend well {{and put in a}} good time during the uphill time trial. La Stampa writer Gianni Ranieri felt the two non-uphill time trials would favor Gianni Bugno, while the up-hill time trial could be a place where Claudio Chiappucci could gain time on the field. Pedro Delgado believed <b>the</b> <b>race</b> <b>to</b> be tougher than the Tour de France that same year. The Cima Coppi – the highest point in altitude the race reached – was scheduled to be the Passo dello Stelvio, but the pass was scrapped from the race and the Passo Pordoi – the next highest mountain – became the new Cima Coppi.|$|E

Vickers (Johnson's teammate) was determined the race winner by NASCAR and was later criticized since the crash lowered Johnson in the points standings.|$|E
5|$|Four-time world {{champion}} Vettel however {{was unable to}} overtake the Williams of Valtteri Bottas for fourth. The other Williams of Felipe Massa had applied the undercut well {{in the early part}} of <b>the</b> <b>race</b> <b>to</b> recover from his pit lane-start to eighth position, but when his tyres started to degrade he was passed by both Sergio Pérez and Daniil Kvyat and finished tenth, taking one point. The race ended spectacularly when the Red Bull of Daniel Ricciardo suffered an engine blow-up on the final straight, just being able to coast his car over the finish line.|$|E

Michael Schumacher managed to close the gap to his title rival by lap 31 and passed Häkkinen during the second round of pit stops. This allowed him to maintain a 1.9-second gap between himself and Häkkinen towards the end of <b>the</b> <b>race</b> <b>to</b> secure his eighth victory of the season.|$|E

5|$|In {{the weeks}} leading up to the event, the Société de Transport de la Communauté Urbaine De Montréal (STCUM) {{announced}} that they would held strikes over pension fund contributions during the Grand Prix weekend. STCUM chose those dates due to the event's high-profile status as public transport was classified as an essential service over the weekend. It would also result in the road leading to the circuit being blocked off to spectators. STCUM appeared before Essential Services Council on 9 June to discuss producing a contingency plan to ensure spectators would attend the Grand Prix with full services running. An agreement was reached on 13 June with 60% of transport workers voting in favour of improved pay and pension, allowing <b>the</b> <b>race</b> <b>to</b> go unaffected.|$|E

5|$|Micheletto won {{the opening}} stage of <b>the</b> <b>race</b> <b>to</b> give Atala-Dunlop the first {{lead in the}} race. Despite two {{consecutive}} stage wins by Legnano riders, Atala-Dunlop still retained the lead going into the fourth stage. The fourth leg was held in rainy conditions that caused some rivers to overflow on the course and riders to take the wrong roads for extensive distances; {{this led to the}} cancellation of the stage and addition of a ninth leg that drew some of its route from the Giro di Lombardia. An Atala-Dunlop rider won the fifth stage, but the team lost the lead to Peugeot for one stage. Following the stage, Atala-Dunlop regained the lead and held that to the race's finish in Bergamo.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Amiens {{was a major}} {{turning point}} in the tempo of the war. The Germans had started the war with the Schlieffen Plan before <b>the</b> <b>Race</b> <b>to</b> the Sea slowed {{movement}} on the Western Front and the war devolved into trench warfare. The German Spring Offensive earlier that year had once again given Germany the offensive edge on the Western Front. Armoured support helped the Allies tear a hole through trench lines, weakening once impregnable trench positions. The British Third Army with no armoured support had almost no effect on the line while the Fourth, with fewer than a thousand tanks, broke deep into German territory. Australian commander John Monash was knighted by King George V in the days following the battle.|$|E

In September 2011, the Detroit City Council approved plans for <b>the</b> <b>race</b> <b>to</b> be held on the weekend of June 1–3, 2012.
