50|$|Radiocommunication is sub-divided {{into space}} and <b>terrestrial</b> <b>{{radiocommunication}}.</b> Space radiocommunication {{is defined in}} RR Article 1 as “any radiocommunication involving the use {{of one or more}} space stations or the use of one or more reflecting satellites or other objects in space”. <b>Terrestrial</b> <b>radiocommunication</b> is defined as “any radiocommunication other than space radiocommunication or radio astronomy”.|$|E
50|$|Some {{services}} are a sub-set of another service. For example, the {{land mobile service}} {{can be thought of}} as a branch of the mobile service which encompasses the land, maritime and aeronautical mobile services. For many <b>terrestrial</b> <b>radiocommunication</b> communication services, there is a parallel space radiocommunication service e.g., the broadcasting service and the broadcasting-satellite service.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{analyzes}} the electromagnetic (EM) radiofrequency (RF) radiation hazards onboard a ship arising from shipboard radiocommunication and navigation equipment. EM field effect on personnel and equipment can be harmful if field levels exceed the threshold values. These fields {{need to be}} controlled for proper protection. Ships are equipped with lots of EM RF radiation sources with different frequencies and output power levels. Typical shipboard EM RF radiation sources include: <b>terrestrial</b> <b>radiocommunication</b> transmitters, navigational radars and satellite ship earth stations (SES). Examples of these sources are analyzed in the paper. EM field estimation using simple worst-case calculation is given for a typical HF transmitter, X-band navigational radar and the Inmarsat SES A, B, C, F and M. The estimation problems are discussed. The calculation results are compared with international civil and military standards. The results show that potential hazards exist and that {{a reasonable amount of}} caution is needed...|$|E
