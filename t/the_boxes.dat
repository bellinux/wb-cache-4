5|$|BoxBoy! is {{a puzzle}} {{platform}} video {{game in which}} players control a square-shaped character named Qbby. The goal {{of the game is}} to guide Qbby through a series of obstacle-filled stages that are divided into sets called worlds. Each world is focussed on a particular gameplay theme; for example one world introduces stages that contain deadly lasers, and another introduces cranes for transporting Qbby around. The central gameplay mechanic is Qbby's ability to create boxes and make use of them to clear the obstacles. Boxes are created one at a time as a connected string and the maximum number of boxes in a string varies between each stage. Qbby can detach the string of boxes then push it to different positions. <b>The</b> <b>boxes</b> can be used to overcome obstacles, such as creating a bridge to pass bottomless pits or building staircases to reach higher platforms. Additionally, Qbby can keep the string of boxes attached to his body. He may then use <b>the</b> <b>boxes</b> as a shield to block hazards such as deadly lasers. He is also able to grapple onto ledges and pull himself up by retracting through <b>the</b> <b>boxes.</b> Creating a new string of boxes causes the previous string to disappear. If Qbby dies, he will respawn at a nearby checkpoint.|$|E
5|$|Opposite the Main and Preece Stands are 25 {{executive}} boxes, {{which have}} an attached net to catch balls directed {{over them and}} a total capacity of 209.

If one team throws a washer under <b>the</b> <b>box</b> and <b>the</b> other team throws a leaner, the team under <b>the</b> <b>box</b> scores (under beats leaner). However, any throw in <b>the</b> <b>box</b> or pipe cancels ALL {{opposing}} washers outside <b>the</b> <b>box,</b> whether they are within 12 inches, leaning, or under <b>the</b> <b>box.</b>|$|R

The console supports regional lockout (software purchased in a region can be only played on that region's hardware).|$|E
5|$|To {{the right}} of the Main Stand is the 3,229-seater Kenilworth Stand, which backs onto Kenilworth Road.

In the corner between the Kenilworth Stand and <b>the</b> <b>boxes</b> is the stadium clock.|$|E
5|$|A and C Squadrons {{supported}} a costly, abortive 15 July attack on Ruweisat Ridge and the regiment retreated as the division dug in at <b>the</b> <b>boxes.</b> Two troops were dispatched {{to join the}} 18th Battalion on 22 July, encountering an Axis pocket and losing a troop commander. The regiment was incorporated into the New Zealand Divisional box; A and C Squadrons dug in, and B Squadron patrolled south. On 17 and 18 August, A and C Squadrons were relieved by the Buffs and Royal West Kents and moved out.|$|E
50|$|Comedy Central {{launched}} on 30 April 2007, replacing former channel <b>The</b> <b>Box</b> Comedy. <b>The</b> <b>Box</b> was originally a Dutch music channel, which allowed viewers {{to vote on}} music videos. The channel later mainly broadcast comedy series. In June 2004, <b>The</b> <b>Box</b> was acquired by MTV Networks Benelux of Viacom. On December 1, 2006 <b>The</b> <b>Box's</b> airtime was shortened, coinciding with Nickelodeon's move from the channel Talpa (now RTL 8) to <b>The</b> <b>Box's</b> channel. <b>The</b> <b>Box</b> was renamed <b>The</b> <b>Box</b> Comedy. On 30 April 2007 the channel was renamed Comedy Central. Between 2007 and 2010 Comedy Central aired between 20:00 pm until 5:00 am. The programming began after the programming of Nickelodeon.|$|R

5|$|Although not {{licensed}} to practise {{medicine in the}} United States, he began testing <b>the</b> <b>boxes</b> on human beings diagnosed with cancer and schizophrenia. In one case the test had to be stopped prematurely because the subject heard a rumour that Reich was insane; there were stories, which were false, {{that he had been}} hospitalized in the Utica State Mental Hospital. In another case the father of an eight-year-old girl with cancer approached him for help, then complained to the American Medical Association that he was practising without a licence. He asked his supporters to stick with him through the criticism, believing that he had developed a grand unified theory of physical and mental health.|$|E
5|$|Berlin {{surrendered}} on 2 May. Records in the Soviet archives obtained {{after the}} fall of the Soviet Union state that the remains of Hitler, Braun, Joseph and Magda Goebbels, the six Goebbels children, General Hans Krebs, and Hitler's dogs were repeatedly buried and exhumed. On 4 April 1970, a Soviet KGB team used detailed burial charts to exhume five wooden boxes at the SMERSH facility in Magdeburg. The remains from <b>the</b> <b>boxes</b> were burned, crushed, and scattered into the Biederitz river, a tributary of the Elbe. According to Kershaw, the corpses of Braun and Hitler were fully burned when the Red Army found them, and only a lower jaw with dental work could be identified as Hitler's remains.|$|E
5|$|Caprioli's {{memorial}} {{was broken}} {{up in the}} nineteenth century, so only the Caprioli Adoration remains. A masterpiece of Cairano's, this was placed in 1841 by Rodolfo Vantini on the high altar of the St Francis of Assisi church. Cairano demonstrates a high technical mastery, {{not only in the}} extremely precise orientation of <b>the</b> <b>boxes,</b> but also in the choice of the monolithic block, which, in fact, is not strictly necessary for this kind of work. From Bernardino Faino and Francesco Paglia and other seventeenth and eighteenth century scholars, we know that the relief was placed by some architectural system. It {{was supposed to be a}} figurative piece, created perhaps by the same artist, but which has not been traced.|$|E

5|$|In 1982, {{the club}} {{decided that it}} would build a new 2,400-seat stand on the eastern long side. A low {{construction}} cost was secured because the construction industry {{was going through a}} slump. The costs were covered by NOK2.5 million in national lottery grants and NOK2 million in loan, which was planned to be repaid through increased sponsor and ticket revenues from increased attendance. The upgrade also included a reconstruction of the club house to facilitate luxury boxes. They were made available for sponsors, who were allowed to bring guests. <b>The</b> <b>boxes</b> and the vestibule became an important informal meeting area for the town's political and business elite.|$|E

On top of <b>the</b> <b>boxes</b> was a printed email to Murray's boyfriend indicating trouble in their relationship. Around 3:30 pm, she drove off the campus in her black 1996 Saturn sedan; classes at the university had been canceled that day due to a snowstorm.|$|E

Raul's amputated forearm is {{examined}} and discovered to be radioactive, leading Walter to conclude these are after effects of using the technology to pass through walls. Olivia and Peter go to a bar to find out information about Raul {{from one of his}} old friends, who says Raul has spent much of his time at the VA. While there, Peter realizes the numbers of the stolen safe deposit boxes match numbers Walter continually spouts off at night. When they confront him, Walter says it is the Fibonacci sequence, and he then realizes that the safe deposit boxes are his. Walter tries to remember what he put in <b>the</b> <b>boxes</b> and where the next two are. Meanwhile, Broyles discovers the VA that Raul went to was in Washington, D.C., leading Olivia to find out Raul and three other patients were in a chess club together. The FBI discovers these men bought a plane ticket to Providence, and Walter remembers which bank he would've used to store something. But when Olivia and Charlie arrive at the bank, the safe deposit box has already been stolen. When they are fleeing, Olivia is able to wound and capture one of the men.|$|E

5|$|A {{music video}} was issued in November 2003 {{to promote the}} single. The video shows Sebastian on a TV set as it is being {{prepared}} for a show. He is dressed casually in jeans and windcheater. He sits on boxes as he begins to sing with a camera crew starting to film him. An image {{of a young woman}} is shown as he continues. Various personnel walk around him and adjust the set. Sebastian stands and the image of the female is seen again, she wears white feathers. Later, Sebastian is dressed more formally in a white suit as he performs the song. On this set are plasma screens depicting the same young woman. The video ends with Sebastian in his casual gear again, sitting on <b>the</b> <b>boxes.</b> The video was produced by Australian Idols Stephen Tate and directed by the show's musical director, John Foreman.

5|$|Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) orders Darryl to hire {{replacements}} for the warehouse staff, but Darryl is wallowing in his depression and neglects to {{even look at}} the applications. With an order due out for one of Phyllis Vance's (Phyllis Smith) most important clients, Andy asks for volunteers to step in {{for the day and}} make sure that the order is shipped out. Jim, Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper), Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson), and Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) take over the process, (however, in a talking-head interview, Kevin states that he will deliberately do a poor job because he did not volunteer and was merely suggested for the job because of his large size), but {{do not know how to}} use the heavy-lifting equipment and balk at the notion of carrying all the heavy boxes by hand. Upon Kevin's suggestion, they create an oil luge to slide <b>the</b> <b>boxes</b> across the floor resulting in a lot of damaged inventory. They retool Kevin's idea throughout the day, resulting in still more damaged inventory, and Phyllis ultimately loses the client.|$|E
5|$|Originally, a {{redevelopment}} of Nadderud was proposed, but in 1999 Stabæk players {{launched the}} idea of building a new stadium at Fornebu, which became subject to an urban redevelopment project after the 1998 closing of Oslo Airport, Fornebu. The initial proposal was named Blue Dream Arena, would have seating for 25,000 spectators, blue artificial turf and a retractable roof. Other proposed amenities were movable seating which would also allow the stadium to both host athletics and be configured as an intimate football stadium. The idea called for Bruce Springsteen to hold a concert before the first match, which would be played against Barcelona. Several of the initial concepts of the stadium were never materialized. International rules disallowed blue artificial turf; instead, the flooring in <b>the</b> <b>boxes</b> were made in a blue, artificial turf-inspired material. Also {{the idea of}} having a retractable roof was discarded, both because of technical difficulties and cost issues.|$|E
5|$|The only area {{in which}} Keela and Eddie gave alerts was {{apartment}} 5A. Both dogs alerted behind the sofa in the living room, and on and under the veranda in the bedroom Madeleine's parents had used. The Polícia Judiciária obtained search warrants to search the house the McCanns had rented on Rua das Flores, and the silver Renault Scénic the couple had hired 24 days after Madeleine went missing. The house and grounds were searched on 2 August. The only alert was from Eddie when he encountered Cuddle Cat, which was lying in the living room; Keela did not give an alert. The police left with boxes of the McCanns' clothes, Cuddle Cat, a pair of latex gloves, suitcases, a notepad, two diaries, including one that Kate had started after the disappearance, and a friend's Bible she had borrowed. A passage the Bible's owner had marked from 2 Samuel, {{about the death of}} a child, was copied into the police case file along with a Portuguese translation. The items were taken to another location, where Eddie alerted to one of <b>the</b> <b>boxes</b> of clothes.|$|E
