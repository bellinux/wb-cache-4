40|$|In Kenya, {{trade policy}} reforms in <b>the</b> <b>cereals</b> <b>sector</b> were {{initiated}} {{as a key}} component of the economy-wide structural adjustment programmes (SAPs) during the mid 1980 s. The SAPs were later strengthened and made irreversible by Kenya’s commitments at the multilateral trade negotiations. However, the welfare effects of these trade policy reforms remain controversial. This paper to quantifies the market and welfare impacts of trade liberalization in Kenya’s maize sector using a partial equilibrium model with market interrelationships at the farm, wholesale and retail levels. The model is calibrated to simulate a 24 percent reduction in maize import tariffs and a complete abolition of tariffs. The simulations results suggest that tariff reductions yield price decreases across the three market levels. The declining prices increase maize consumption but reduce domestic production. Consequently, consumer surplus increases while producer surplus decreases. However, the gain in consumer surplus is not sufficient to compensate the loss in producer surplus. Thus, the implementation of the multilateral agricultural trade agreement is likely to leave Kenya’s maize sector worse off and cannot be considered as a viable policy based on the compensation principle.

40|$|On {{the basis}} of {{information}} available in September 2002 this update seeks to incorporate the anticipated effects of the US Farm Bill {{on the development of}} agricultural markets in the EU, Eastern Europe and internationally for meat, cereals (including rice) and dairy products. The market situation for EU cereals is projected to continue to be favourable, with the exception of rye and barley. Severe drops in production levels - mainly driven by unfavourable climatic conditions in North America and Australia - have triggered a strong rally in market prices in <b>the</b> <b>cereals</b> <b>sector.</b> The impact of this however will be short term. An expansion of EU production of common wheat, durum wheat and maize is projected, with increased yields more than off-setting the decline in area under cereals. EU cereal production is expected to reach 224. 7 million tonnes in 2009 (up from 213. 3 million tonnes in 2000 and a peak of 180 million tonnes in the pre CAP reform period). EU cereal exports are expected to rise above 30 million tonnes by 2005, reaching 32. 5 million tonnes in 2009. This export level will exceed the annual limit on subsidised exports {{largely as a result of}} unsubsidised exports of both durum wheat and common wheat. EU wheat exports in 2009 are expected to be around 33 % higher than in 2000 (19. 6 million tonnes compared to 14. 3 million tonnes). A steady growth in domestic and international demand for both common wheat and durum wheat is anticipated over the next seven years, with the EU market situation therefore remaining tight. The EU's expansion of cereals production will largely be taken up by the domestic animal-feed industry. With reference to the impact of the US Farm Bill the potentially negative impact on wheat prices will, it is felt, be off-set in the medium term by more favourable market conditions than previously expected, although the price-depressing impact will be more marked for maize. A continued imbalance in the rice sector is anticipated, with the situation becoming critical after 2006. Comment: The figures contained in the report clearly show the extent to which CAP reform in <b>the</b> <b>cereals</b> <b>sector</b> is allowing an expansion of EU production and a resurgence in EU exports. It also shows the extent to which cereals-sector reform is enhancing the competitiveness of those meat-product exports which make extensive use of cereal-based animal feed. For example poultry exports are projected to peak and remain at around 1 million tonnes throughout the period from 2003 to 2009, a sharp increase from around 400, 000 tonnes in the pre-cereal-sector reform period. This highlights how the move to 'less trade-distorting' forms of support is having some rather strange trade effects. On {{the basis of}} information available in September [...] ...|$|E
40|$|In {{addressing}} the National Union of Farmers in the UK on February 18 th 2003, Commissioner Fischler raised directly a major apparent contradiction in EU policy, namely 'how can EU agriculture simultaneously be competitive {{on the world}} markets, competing at lower prices, while producing at higher costs and meeting our high environmental, food quality, or animal welfare standards?' Commissioner Fischler maintained that the proposed trajectory for reform offered the vehicle for reconciling these seemingly contradictory objectives, since it would {{bridge the gap between}} EU and world market prices by shifting support from products to producers. He cited developments in <b>the</b> <b>cereals</b> <b>sector</b> as an excellent example of what could be achieved, pointing out that Europe's interest lay in selling food products rather than basic raw materials. He admitted that this constituted the key interface with the WTO negotiations, and that unfortunately the current Harbinson proposals (see above) were not consistent with EU objectives. Comment: Implicit in Commissioner Fischler's presentation to the NFU was that the shift to decoupled support would cover both the income losses arising from price reductions and the extra costs associated with meeting the higher standards which the EU was now setting for its food products. Ensuring a WTO agreement which allows decoupled support programmes to carry these costs is a key objective of the EU in the current agricultural negotiations.

40|$|This study {{evaluates the}} welfare {{implications}} of tariff reforms in <b>the</b> <b>cereals</b> <b>sector</b> of the SADC region. Applying the global simulation model (GSIM), a multi-country partial equilibrium model, to the cereals industries of thirteen SADC countries, the study computes price and welfare effects of tariff reforms on different economic groups in each coun try, and evaluates responsiveness to external supply shocks. Results indicate that on net, elimination of intra-regional tariffs is welfare reducing {{for the region}} - a robust result as ind icated by the sensitivity tests. South Africa emerges as the sole beneficiary of intra-regional tariff elimination, with positive net welfare gains attained through higher producer surplus; whereas the rest of SACU experiences losses in consum er surplus, {{and the rest of}} SADC experiences losses in produ cer surplus. Imports {{from the rest of the}} world drop for most netimporter SADC countries, whereas trade with the SADC region generally increases, indicating that both trade diversion and trade creation result from these tariff reforms. The negative net welfare effects suggest that the trade diversion effects exceed the trade creation effects for most of SADC. Larger, positive welfare effects are expected for all of SADC, except South Africa and Zimbabwe, when countries implement indiscriminate reform of MFN tariff rates, although gains come at major costs to regional producers. Imports from both the region and the world are also expected to increase. Tariff reforms also seem to serve the purpose of spreading price and quantity risk, albeit meagerly, from supply shocks generated within the region, making it less intense in countries of origin, and more intense for the rest of SADC.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to explore the links that exist between the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) of the European Communities (EC) and the EC budget. In particular, the thesis {{examines}} {{the impact on the}} budget of reforming the CAP. It shows that the nature of support offered under the CAP up to the 1992 MacSharry reforms has a strong historical precedent in French and German history. It then goes on to examine in greater detail the support mechanisms of the cereals and oilseeds sectors. <b>The</b> <b>cereals</b> <b>sector</b> is focused on because of its importance in agricultural output and in total agricultural support expenditure by the EC. Oilseeds is considered for its policy linkages with cereals in both production and consumption. The detailed nature of expenditures on these sectors is examined in detail, with particular emphasis placed on costs and policy problems arising out of intervention storage. In forecasting future expenditures under different policy scenarios, cereals production and consumption are considered separately. Imports, exports and intervention behaviour are also considered, to permit the examination of all aspects of the cereals market that affect expenditure. The impact of the 1992 MacSharry reforms is compared to a strict continuation of the 1988 stabiliser reforms and a price freeze at 1992 levels for the forecast period to 1999. It is shown that the impact of the 1992 reforms is to reduce the extent of the market imbalances by 1999 as compared with the base scenarios, but unless the level of compensatory payment is cut, then by 1999, the EC faces a support bill that is higher under the new policy than would have been the case had the 1988 reforms been retained...|$|E
40|$|Another USDA paper {{identifies}} {{three important}} effects of EU export subsidies: they lower {{prices in the}} importing country resulting in a 'decrease in local production, meaning the artificially low price pushes domestic producers out of the market, leaving them unemployed'; they reduce the income of those who continue to produce 'which can be devastating to their livelihoods'; they can 'inhibit market development of infant industries, particularly in developing countries'. The paper reviews {{the situation in the}} dairy sector and notes that skimmed-milk powder is the EU's largest export product to developing and least developed countries. Some 95 % of subsidised skimmed milk powder exports from the EU went to developing countries and some 11 % to LDCs. The paper notes that 'many developing and least developed countries have become dependent on low-priced SMP and other dairy imports from the EU as a primary protein source'. The low cost of imports has displaced local dairy farmers in countries as diverse as South Africa and Sri Lanka. In the rice sector, some 50 % of EU milled-rice exports goes to developing countries, with around 14 % going to LDCs. The report also briefly looks at the impact of export subsidies in the cereals and sugar sectors. Comment: While criticising the export subsidies paid by the EU this USDA paper makes no reference to the impact that CAP reform is having on the need for export subsidies. In <b>the</b> <b>cereals</b> <b>sector,</b> where reform is most advanced, the need for export subsidies had been reduced by around 95 % until the recent increase {{in the value of the}} euro against the US dollar (which saw a fivefold increase in cereals-sector export refunds in the 2004 EU budget).

40|$|Commissioner Fischler {{reiterated the}} EU's {{approach}} to reform {{at a meeting}} on March 11 th 2002 with Stuart Harbinson, the new Chair of the agricultural negotiations in the WTO. He {{pointed out that the}} EU would say 'yes' to more market opening, provided it is done in a way which enables everyone to benefit from new market opportunities and protects geographical indications such as 'Roquefort' cheese or 'Parma' ham against usurpation of names; 'yes' to reductions in forms of export assistance, which is already subject to WTO disciplines, provided other forms of export subsidies are similarly disciplined and reduced; and 'yes' to reductions in trade distorting support, provided that WTO members remain free to ensure that their farmers can continue to meet the wider goals and expectations of society, such as environment or food safety. Comment: The EU's approach to WTO negotiations is conditional upon progress in related areas and an acceptance of new ways of promoting wider agricultural and rural development objectives. The EU rightly points out how, prior to the initiation of CAP reform (in the 1989 - 91 period), EU farm expenditure for price support and export refunds accounted for 90. 7 % of the farm budget, and how, {{as a consequence of the}} process of CAP reform, these trade distorting forms of assistance will have fallen to only 21. 3 % of the CAP budget by 2006, with 78. 7 % of the budget going to less trade distorting or non-trade distorting forms of assistance. However it needs to be borne in mind that the notion of less trade distorting is a relative concept. In <b>the</b> <b>cereals</b> <b>sector</b> these less trade distorting forms of aid have nevertheless allowed EU production to increase 26 % in response to a 50 % decline in average cereal prices. This is not a normal supply side response to price declines. Thus it can be seen that even less trade distorting forms of aid have profound effects on production decisions in the EU.

For <b>the</b> <b>cereal</b> <b>sector,</b> <b>the</b> presence of ergot creates a high toxicity risk for animals and humans because of its alkaloid content.

In addition, a correlation higher than 0. 94 was obtained between the predicted values obtained by NIR hyperspectral imaging and those supplied by the stereo-microscopic method which is the reference method.

40|$|The European Commission {{released}} its {{review of the}} 'Prospects for Agricultural Markets in the European Union 2003 - 2010 ' in June 2003. In <b>the</b> <b>cereals</b> <b>sector</b> the report projected a 'relatively fragile' situation. The recent rise in cereal imports and domestic EU production, combined with a lower than expected expansion of cereal exports (in part {{accounted for by the}} rising value of the Euro against the US $) will lead to a significant growth in cereals stocks over the 2002 / 2003 period. Stocks are then likely to remain high as production expands and demand remains constrained by only a moderate expansion of EU animal production Increases in yields will more than off-set the decline in the area under cereals. EU exports are expected to average around 30 million tonnes over the medium term (with a projection of exports at 31. 3 million tonnes in 2010 as opposed to 19. 9 million tonnes in 2001). The EU- 15 wheat sector is expected to show strong gains, with production up from 103. 3 million tonnes in 2002 to 113. 9 million tonnes in 2010 and exports up from 16. 5 million in 2002 to 18. 8 million in 2010. While most of this increased production will be absorbed within the domestic EU market, a steady growth in exports at world market prices is expected. Comment: The increased exports of wheat at world market prices (i. e. without any WTO constraints) is potentially the most serious development that is of concern to ACP countries, since it is also likely to fuel exports of competitively priced EU wheat-based products. It should be borne in mind, however, that these are projections and not projects, with considerable uncertainty arising from exchange-rate variations; the export capacity of newly emerging exporting regions (Black Sea countries and Brazil); the level of global economic recovery; the outcome of the Doha Development Round; and the final impact of the CAP compromise agreement.

40|$|Addressing {{a conference}} in Paris {{on the future of}} European Agriculture, EU Trade Commissioner Lamy argued that 'farming is not an {{industry}} that can be abandoned to the tender mercies of market capitalism', since profit maximisation can have 'consequences that are unacceptable to our communities'. What is more, as Commissioner Lamy acknowledged, 'if farming has to go by the principle of the international division of labour, five million of Europe's six million farmers would go to the wall'. For Europe 'that is not acceptable'. As a consequence, according to Commissioner Lamy, the CAP should aim to compensate farmers for the services they provide which are not rewarded through the market. Overall the challenge faced is seen to be one of 'adjusting the policy mix to the desired outcomes and constraints'. One of the desired outcomes is to 'support incomes without artificially stimulating production'. This can be achieved through 'paying farmers direct income support 'de-coupled' from [...] production levels or reference prices. ' The Commissioner however warned that such a system had two main draw backs: by de-linking income from production it could lead producers to neglect quality considerations; it could lock in existing patterns of production. A further important policy objective according to Commissioner Lamy is ensuring maintenance of farm incomes without stifling farming initiative. In order to address this issue the CAP needs to reward quality - hence the introduction of cross compliance. A further policy challenge outlined by Commissioner Lamy is to avoid over-regulation, given the competing objectives being pursued. He also emphasised the challenge of finding a policy framework which accommodates the diversity of European agriculture, which he felt was a challenge which should not be underestimated. Against this background the mid-term review proposals were simply an extension of the ongoing trajectory for CAP reform and by no means represented a revolutionary change. Turning to the external dimension Commissioner Lamy highlighted how reform, although driven by internal considerations, could nevertheless earn the EU negotiating credit in international fora, by making agricultural trade liberalisation easier to implement. Comment: Ironically while Commissioner Lamy argues that farming can not be abandoned to the tender mercies of the market, this is precisely what the Trade Directorate is trying to promote for developing countries. In the case of the EU-South Africa Trade, Development and Co-operation agreement the EU secured the elimination of tariffs on 83 % of current EU agricultural exports, a development which has serious implications for four ACP members - Botswana, Namibia, Lesotho and Swaziland. In addition while Commissioner Lamy claims that the emerging system of de-coupled payments will not artificially stimulate production, the experience in <b>the</b> <b>cereals</b> <b>sector</b> suggests {{that this is not the}} case, with EU cereals production having expanded 18 % under the impetus of reform.

40|$|EU {{agricultural}} {{trade with}} China has remained deficit since 1990. The unsteady exports {{were responsible for}} the deficit. Oilseeds, oilseed oils, cereals, dairy products, and meat products are the staple products that the EU have exported to China in 1990 s. EU export of oilseeds jumped to the first position in 1999 because EU exports of vegetable oils (mostly oilseed oils) have declined gradually since the middle of the 1990 s. The cause is China's policy shift towards domestic crushing of oilseeds with the aim of retaining the value-added activity in China. As a result, China is able to produce more value-added vegetable oils {{at the expense of the}} decrease in the imports of oilseed oils. In <b>the</b> <b>cereals</b> <b>sector,</b> EU export of wheat products in value shrank over 99 % in 1999 compared to 1995 due to harsh competition and slowing demand in the Chinese market. Meanwhile, EU export of barley has performed increasingly well in China's market due to the growing demand for brewing and decreasing domestic production in China. EU agricultural imports have been steadily growing throughout the period. Labour-intensive products have become the dominant products that the EU imported from China due to the cheap labour cost in China. Netherlands, France, and Germany are the three major players in the agricultural trade with China. Under the framework of the WTO, China has committed to make vast reforms on its agricultural trade policy. China agreed to improve market access, eliminate non-tariff barriers, and also not to maintain or introduce any export subsidies on agricultural products. The impact of these reforms on EU agricultural trade with China will be significant, affecting mostly EU agricultural exports to China. Barley and rapeseed oil are likely to benefit the most from the reduction in tariff. Considerable tariff cuts will also further lower the price of EU dairy products and meat products in the Chinese market. Freer trade for oilseeds and oilseed oils will further stimulate China's domestic demand for imports. Consequently, EU exports of rapeseed and rapeseed oil are expected to grow strongly in the next few years. The increasing participation of private companies into Chinese agricultural trade will increase EU opportunities to export more of these products. The reason is that China will not be able to use state trading enterprises (STEs) as a policy instrument to limit imports in order to support domestic production. These findings imply that changes in China's agricultural policy as a member of the WTO will have a favourable impact on EU agricultural exports to China in the next few years. Furthermore, EU's export of barley, rapeseeds and rapeseed oil will expand more rapidly compared to the other agricultural products. vokMTT Taloustutkimu...|$|E
40|$|The {{decoupling}} {{of support}} for crops under the reform of the CAP has led to concern within the UK as to whether its <b>cereal</b> <b>sector</b> can remain competitive when exposed to unprotected international commodity prices. This paper reports on a Global Benchmarking and Competitive Analysis of <b>the</b> UK <b>Cereals</b> <b>Sector.</b> <b>The</b> UK <b>cereals</b> <b>sector</b> was broken down into: Animal Feed Manufacture; Malting, Brewing and Distilling; Flour Milling and Baking; Industrial Applications Starch, Bio-Fuels, Pharmaceutical. Four panels of UK experts were assembled. Each panel identified six main competitor countries to the UK for each supply chain and {{compiled a list of}} key factors affecting competitiveness. A total of 1500 questionnaires were distributed. Assurance, traceability, enforcement of regulation, and quality control procedures are regarded as strong in the UK. Supply chains have a good size structure providing a stable supply of raw material, well-located for usage outlets. However {{there appears to be a}} lack of co-operation, integration and trust within the supply chains. Specific training and education is required and there is a problem of recruiting and retaining skilled staff. There is a lack of benchmarking and sharing of good practice. There is concern that productivity improvement is threatened by the erosion of the UK research base. Overall a lack of confidence in the future of the sector is impeding entrepreneurship and innovative strategic investment.

40|$|This chapter {{discusses}} {{the application of}} life cycle assessment methodologies to rice, wheat, corn {{and some of their}} derived products. Cereal product systems are vital for the production of commodities of worldwide importance that entail particular environmental hot spots originating from their widespread use and from their particular nature. It is thus important for tools such as life cycle assessment (LCA) to be tailored to such cereal systems in order {{to be used as a}} means of identifying the negative environmental effects of cereal products and highlighting possible pathways to overall environmental improvement in such systems. Following a brief introduction to <b>the</b> <b>cereal</b> <b>sector</b> and supply chain, this chapter reviews some of the current cereal-based life cycle thinking literature, with a particular emphasis on LCA. Next, an analysis of the LCA methodological issues emerging from the literature review is carried out. The following section of the chapter discusses some practices and approaches that should be considered when performing cereal-based LCAs in order to achieve the best possible results. Conclusions are drawn in the final part of the chapter and some indications are given of the main hot spots in <b>the</b> <b>cereal</b> supply chain...|$|R
