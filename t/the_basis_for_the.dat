5|$|Adventure {{received}} mostly positive reviews at {{the time}} of its release and has continued to be viewed positively in the decades since, often named as one of the industry's influential titles. It is considered the first action-adventure and console fantasy game, and inspired other titles in the genres. More than one million cartridges of Adventure were sold, and the game has been included in numerous Atari 2600 game collections for modern computer hardware. The game's prototype code was used as <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> 1979 Superman game, and a planned sequel eventually formed <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Swordquest games. The Easter egg concept pioneered by the game has transcended video games and entered popular culture.|$|E

In 1944 it became <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> BM-31-12 truck-mounted launcher.|$|E
