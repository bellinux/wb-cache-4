25|$|It {{was said}} that Nottingham could not support a tramway company; that there was this, <b>that,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> special reason why {{it would be all}} moonshine in Nottingham. It was said again that the uneven roads would necessitate the {{employment}} of too many extra horses to make the company pay; but these prognosticators did not know that uneven roads create traffic; that people are ever ready to jump into a car, and even pay a full fare to simply ride {{to the top of a}} hill. Now it happens that these prophets are without honour in their native land. The tramways company is a great success in the town, as we shall see very soon. The first section was opened on September the 18th last year, the running being to and from the Railway Stations, the Trent Bridge , and St. Peter's Church. On that first day 2,277 persons were carried in four inside cars, which were worked by 27 horse, the fare being twopence all the way. But here is something rather good. In the week ending October the 5th (Goose Fair week mind) no fewer than 32,619 persons were carried in five cars; and this result was said by experienced men to be unparalleled in the history of tramways.|$|E
25|$|In December 1861, Union General Thomas W. Sherman {{occupied}} Otter Island, Tybee Island, and St. Helena Sound. Naval commander Samuel F. Du Pont ordered Commander Percival Drayton {{to assist}} the army in taking Otter Island. On a reconnaissance trip in St. Helena Sound, Drayton anchored between Otter Island and Edisto Island in St. Helena Sound. While there, he met {{with a number of}} slaves, who provided information on rebel actions. Over the coming weeks, Drayton would discover that rebels had attacked and burned slave houses, and the refugees moved Drayton to help establish a colony of over 100 former slaves on Otter Island in December 1861, which would be supervised by Lieutenant James W. Nicholson. The contrabands, as the former slaves were called, were active in their own support as well. For instance, on December 10, contrabands assisted Nicholson in obtaining provisions. While Nicholson was aggressive in defending the camp, Union officials were aware of the threat to the former slaves posed by nearby rebel forces. In mid-December, Drayton made a reconnaissance up the Edisto with the Pawnee, Vixen and Seneca and spied fortifications on Edisto Island. He fired upon the fort but received no reply. He then landed at the fort, which was deserted with the guns. Soon after, Drayton led a party to investigate reports of rebels burning cotton houses and outbuildings and encamped near Rockville. When they arrived at the camp, the Confederates had fled, and African Americans were there pillaging. When Drayton returned to his boat, the Pawnee, 150 African Americans had collected on <b>that</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> boats. Drayton decided to send them to the point of Edisto Island, and they set up a camp in a belt of woods along the seacoast of North Edisto Island, where they were protected from Confederate attacks by a marsh. Drayton left Lieutenant Thomas A. Budd of the Penguin in charge. By December 29, 1861, Lieutenant Daniel Ammen of the Seneca reported that between 700 and 900 African Americans had gathered on Botany Bay Island on the Atlantic side of Edisto Island, although they still faced threats from Confederates who had been seen on North Edisto Island. Ammen and the Seneca had shelled a rebel headquarters and woods on White Point. Ammen wrote to Du Pont on January 21, 1862 that the colony then numbered 1,200 and if Union forces did not occupy Edisto Island, may be unable to defend itself from rebels when collecting food over the country. Ammen also suggested hiring contraband to collect unginned cotton on the island for compensation, and reported that the colony's African-American superintendent wanted to land a force of contrabands at Rockville and drive off the Confederates, who had returned to the camp.|$|E

2500|$|The English poet John Masefield, {{following}} in the footsteps of peers like Rudyard Kipling, seized upon shanties as a nostalgic literary device, and included them along with much older, non-shanty sea songs in his 1906 collection A Sailor's Garland. Though Masefield had sea experience (1891–95), he was not an expert on shanties and the versions he gave of songs cannot be assumed entirely authentic. For example, he admits to never having heard a pumping shanty, and yet he goes on to present one without citing its source. In one of his earlier articles, his shanties are set to melodies taken verbatim from Davis and Tozer's earlier work, and he mentions having utilized <b>that</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> widely available collection (L.A. Smith, 1888) as resources. Masefield desired to connect shanties with much older English traditions and literature, and his characterization of individual items as such would prove attractive to later enthusiasts. So for example, Masefield implied that the shanty [...] "A-roving" [...] (which he titled [...] "The Maid of Amsterdam") was derived from Thomas Heywood's The Tragedy of the Rape of Lucrece (1608). Lyrics and ideas from Masefield's collection became among the most quoted or plagiarized in later shanty collections, and by their sheer ubiquity these contributed to 20th century audiences' perceptions of the genre.|$|E
2500|$|Spurrier {{spoke about}} his NFL {{coaching}} experience during SEC Media Days in 2014. [...] "When I left Florida after 12 years, I thought I {{was going to}} coach in the NFL {{five or six years}} and retire to the beach, and play golf a bunch, and travel around, this, <b>that</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>other.</b> But that was a bad plan. It was. Later you found out that was not a real good idea. But that's the way I was thinking back then.". [...] After retiring from coaching, Spurrier further reflected on his NFL stint in several interviews. In a 2016 appearance on the Paul Finebaum Show, Spurrier reflected that the Redskins might not have been the best choice for his jump to the NFL. [...] "I went to the team that offered the most money instead of the best situation", he said. And in 2015, he told David Feherty that, [...] "The owner and the personnel guys, they picked the team. I couldn’t even pick the quarterback the second year. So I knew it wasn’t going to work, but that's ok. I probably didn’t do a very good job, and the situation wasn’t what I was looking for, so {{it was time to move}} on." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1908, Editura Minerva {{published}} {{a volume of}} Izabela Sadoveanu's critical essays, Impresii literare ("Literary Impressions"). The book earned the attention of critics, and was reviewed in the national press. In Luceafărul, a tribune of the Romanians in Austria-Hungary, fellow writer Ion Duma contrasted Impresii literare with another work of [...] "impressionistic" [...] criticism, that of traditionalist journalist Ilarie Chendi: while Sadoveanu's text demanded didacticism and morality in literature, Chendi, a Sămănătorul dissident, was writing in favor of art for art's sake. As noted by Duma, Sadoveanu's pronouncements defended writers for their moral mission, even {{to the detriment of}} art, equally praising Sofia Nădejde and novelist Constantin Sandu-Aldea for their sense of [...] "pity [...] for those less fortunate". The same reviewer also claimed that Sadoveanu, [...] "a womanly character", lacked an understanding of extrovert and [...] "combative" [...] traditionalists like Sandu-Aldea and Luceafărul poet Octavian Goga. Another Luceafărul chronicler, academic Gheorghe Bogdan-Duică, contrarily asserted that Sadoveanu was [...] "rather the warrior", but described Impresii... as inconsistent: [...] "Yes and no; neither here nor there; this, <b>that</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>other.</b> And yet it carries a note that ought to be signaled." [...] From his traditionalist standpoint, Bogdan-Duică argued that Sadoveanu erred in reaching beyond [...] "impressions" [...] to consider herself a professional critic, and to advocate the [...] "primacy of the senses" [...] in art: [...] "Ms. Sadoveanu-Evan has a philosophy, even though she is a woman." [...] Reviewing the echoes of Sadoveanu's contributions in 2002, publisher and literary historian Cornelia Ștefănescu argued: [...] " [...] sparked bitter polemics and denials more than appreciations, even though N. Iorga and G. Ibrăileanu, objectively or not, had a privileged view of her".|$|E
