Terry Anderson and Donald Leal <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> recycling programmes should be privately operated, and therefore would only operate {{if the money}} saved by recycling exceeds its costs.

I was able to do that in front of millions of viewers. That was a remarkable experience—and it continues to resonate. The downside of that is also that it continues to resonate, and threatens to eclipse all else in one's long career if one does not up the ante and stay at it, in a way that may not ordinarily be necessary. I have to work at changing and constantly reinventing myself in a way that probably would not have happened had Star Trek not come along. I knew that going in, and I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> of the perks attached to this journey have been really inexpressively great. So the negatives are small.|$|E

He criticised the French Football Federation (FFF) for their lack of support {{in the aftermath of the}} controversy.

2500|$|The Rabbis {{interpreted}} {{the words of}} [...] "These are the statutes and the ordinances, which you shall observe {{to do in the}} land [...] [...] [...] all the days that you live upon the earth," [...] in a Baraita. They read [...] "the statutes" [...] to refer to the Rabbinic interpretations of the text. They read [...] "the ordinances" [...] to refer to monetary, civil laws. They read [...] "which you shall observe" [...] to refer study. They read [...] "to do" [...] to refer to actual practice. Reading [...] "in the land," [...] one might <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> precepts are binding only in the Land of Israel; therefore [...] states, [...] "all the days that you live upon the earth" [...] to teach that the laws bind one wherever one lives. Reading [...] "all the days," [...] one might <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> precepts are binding {{both inside and outside the}} Land of Israel; therefore [...] states, [...] "in the land." [...] The Rabbis taught that one could thus learn from the next verse, [...] "You shall utterly destroy all the places, wherein the nations served their God," [...] that just as the destruction of idolatry is a personal duty, and is binding both inside and outside the Land of Israel, so everything that is a personal duty is binding both inside and outside the Land of Israel. And conversely, laws that are connected to the land are binding only in the Land of Israel.|$|E

2500|$|An {{unauthorised}} sequel {{was written}} by Miodrag Bulatović in 1966: Godo je došao (Godot Arrived). It was translated from the Serbian into German (Godot ist gekommen) and French. The playwright presents Godot as a baker who ends up being condemned to death by the four main characters. Since {{it turns out he}} is indestructible, Lucky declares him non-existent. Although Beckett was noted for disallowing productions that took even slight liberties with his plays, he let this pass without incident but not without comment. Ruby Cohn writes: [...] "On the flyleaf of my edition of the Bulatović play, Beckett is quoted: 'I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> {{that has nothing to do}} with me.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Lesbian {{women who}} have {{identified}} themselves as [...] "political lesbians" [...] include Ti-Grace Atkinson, Julie Bindel, Charlotte Bunch, Yvonne Rainer, Sheila Jeffreys.

The pamphlet stated, [...] "We do <b>think...</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> feminists can and should be lesbians. Our definition of a political lesbian is a woman-identified woman who does not fuck men. It does not mean compulsory sexual activity with women." ...|$|E

He further argued it was not a civil war, but rather [...] "from the start an international conflict, because Serbia, according to its own constitution, became an independent state on 28 September 1990, ie more than a year before Slovenia's and Croatia's own proclamations of independence on 8 October 1991".|$|E

[...] She continued, [...] "We've got to allow the free market to dictate what's most efficient and economical for our nation's economy. No, at this time, our country can't afford the subsidies.

[...] In response to Bill O'Reilly's questions concerning the possibility that the woman might have fabricated the allegations, Sharpton said, [...] "First of all, the authorities have charged there was a crime. ... When the prosecutors went forward, they clearly have said this girl is the victim, so why would we be trying the victim?" [...] When O'Reilly mentioned recent news reports that DNA testing had failed to match any of the defendants, Sharpton said, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> of the facts that you have laid out the DA had — and I know this DA is probably not one that is crazy. He would not have proceeded if he did not feel that he could convict." [...] Sharpton continued that the case parallels [...] "Abner Louima, who was raped and sodomized in a bathroom."

2500|$|Our Rabbis {{asked in}} a Baraita why [...] says, [...] "You shall set the blessing upon Mount Gerizim and the curse upon mount Ebal." [...] cannot say so merely to teach where the Israelites were to say the blessings and curses, as [...] already says, [...] "These shall stand upon Mount Gerizim to bless the people [...] [...] [...] and these shall stand upon Mount Ebal for the curse." [...] Rather, the Rabbis taught {{that the purpose of}} [...] was to {{indicate}} that the blessings must precede the curses. It is possible to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> the blessings must precede all the curses; therefore the text states [...] "blessing" [...] and [...] "curse" [...] in the singular, and thus teaches that one blessing precedes one curse, alternating blessings and curses, and all the blessings do not precede all the curses. A further purpose of [...] is to draw a comparison between blessings and curses: As the curse was pronounced by the Levites, so the blessing had to be pronounced by the Levites. As the curse was uttered in a loud voice, so the blessing had to be uttered in a loud voice. As the curse was said in Hebrew, so the blessing had to be said in Hebrew. As the curses were in general and particular terms, so the blessings had to be in general and particular terms. And as with the curse both parties responded [...] "Amen," [...] so with the blessing both parties responded [...] "Amen.". Brooklyn: Mesorah Publications, 2000[...]|$|E
2500|$|I met Henry James {{the other}} night at Emerson's, at an Alcottian conversation, at which, however, Alcott did not talk much, being {{disturbed}} by James's opposition. [...] The latter is a hearty man enough, with whom you can differ very satisfactorily, both {{on account of his}} doctrines and his good temper. [...] He utters quasi-philanthropic dogmas in a metaphysic dress; but they are, for all practical purposes, very crude. [...] He charges society with all the crime committed, and praises the criminal for committing it. [...] But I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> the remedies he suggests out of his head—for he goes no farther, hearty as he is—would leave us about where we are now. [...] For, of course, it is not by a gift of turkeys on Thanksgiving Day that he proposes to convert the criminal, but by a true sympathy with each one,—with him, among the rest, who lying tells the world from the gallows that he has never been treated kindly by a single mortal since he was born. [...] But it is not so easy a thing to sympathize with another, though you may have the best disposition to do it. [...] There is Dobson over the hill. [...] Have not you and I and all the world been trying to sympathize with him since he was born (as doubtless he with us), and yet we have got no further than to send him to the House of Correction once at least; and he, on the other hand, has sent us to another place several times. [...] This is the real state of things as I understand it, at least so far as James's remedies. [...] We are now, alas! exercising what charity we actually have, and new laws would not give us any more. [...] But perchance, we might make some improvements in the House of Correction.
