5|$|Most {{outbound}} O-Bahn bus routes {{travel through}} the Adelaide city centre along Grenfell Street, left onto East Terrace, right onto Rundle Road through the Adelaide park lands {{to the north of}} Rymill Park, then left onto Dequetteville Terrace, which changes name to Hackney Road at the next major intersection.
