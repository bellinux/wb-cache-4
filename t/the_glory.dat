5|$|McBreen's debut for <b>the</b> <b>Glory</b> {{came when}} he entered a 6–2 away loss to Melbourne Victory as a 38th-minute {{substitute}} for Chris Coyne on 16 January 2010. He started and scored in the next match three days later, a 3–2 away win over Adelaide United, with the winning goal in the 77th minute. This marked {{the start of a}} run of five goals from four matches, helping <b>the</b> <b>Glory</b> finish fifth in the 2009–10 A-League table and thus qualify for the finals series. McBreen played in their 4–2 penalty shoot-out defeat to Wellington Phoenix in the fourth v fifth semi-final on 21 February 2010, which followed a 1–1 draw after extra time. He had scored five goals in seven appearances for <b>the</b> <b>Glory,</b> and with eight goals altogether he was the 2009–10 A-League's eighth highest scorer. His good form was rewarded with his first call-up for the Australia national team.|$|E
5|$|On 27 April 2010, it was {{announced}} that Fowler had agreed to become part of Glory's squad for the 2010–11 A-League season. Fowler reportedly ignored offers from Middle East clubs as well as Sydney FC to play in Perth. He joined <b>the</b> <b>Glory</b> for pre-season training in mid-June, following World Cup sponsorship commitments. Fowler scored his first goal for Perth on 29 August, a penalty against Melbourne Heart. He followed this up with a headed goal the following week against the Wellington Phoenix. In the following match, Fowler's hat-trick gave <b>the</b> <b>Glory</b> a 3–1 victory against Melbourne Victory at the Dairy Famers Stadium in Townsville. Fowler ended the year as top scorer for the club.|$|E
5|$|The {{civilian}} posse {{arrived at}} the battleground as the fighting finished.

5|$|Although {{the founders}} of the Tang related to <b>the</b> <b>glory</b> of the earlier Han dynasty (3rd century–3rd century), the basis for much of their {{administrative}} organization was very similar to the previous Northern and Southern dynasties. The Northern Zhou (6th century) fubing system of divisional militia was continued by the Tang, along with farmer-soldiers serving in rotation from the capital or frontier in order to receive appropriated farmland. The equal-field system of the Northern Wei (4th–6th centuries) was also kept, although there were a few modifications.|$|E
5|$|Compositions in the haridasa {{literature}} are sub-divided into four types: kirthane, suladi, ugabhoga and mundige. Kirthanes are devotional musical compositions with refrains based on raga and tala and celebrate <b>the</b> <b>glory</b> of god. The suladi are tala based, the ugabhoga are melody based while the mundige {{are in the}} form of riddles. Compositions were also modelled on jogula (lullaby songs) and sobane (marriage songs). A common feature of haridasa compositions are influences from the Hindu epics, the Ramayana, the Mahabharata and Bhagavata.|$|E

5|$|Considered washed-up, the 34-year-old Tittle {{was traded}} to the Giants {{following}} the 1960 season. Over the next four seasons, he won multiple NFL MVP awards, twice set the league single-season record for touchdown passes, and led the Giants to three straight NFL championship games. Although he was never able to deliver a championship to the team, Tittle's time in New York is regarded among <b>the</b> <b>glory</b> years of the franchise.|$|E
5|$|He is {{believed}} {{by many to}} be a reincarnation of Valmiki.

5|$|When World War I {{forced the}} closure of all European opera houses, Paoli made his living as a {{professional}} boxer. Unfortunately, he also lost his singing voice during this period.

5|$|After the Suez Crisis and the Six-Day War, {{the army}} came to arm the most {{important}} place. For technical reasons (distance of communication with bases) and because new places of historical interest were accessible, the top brass debated whether to transfer the postings of new recruits at Massada to a more appropriate place. It was Latrun that was finally chosen. In the 1980s, a commemorative site and a museum {{was built on the}} old police site. The complex has a wall listing all the names of the fallen soldiers since the War Of Independence, and a monument to <b>the</b> <b>glory</b> of the heroes and another for reverence. The museum has nearly 200 tanks and other armoured vehicles of many kinds.|$|E
5|$|Another account {{recalled}} how Marseille once ignored {{an order to}} turn back from a fight when outnumbered by two to one, but seeing an Allied aircraft closing on his wing leader, Marseille broke formation and shot the attacking aircraft down. Expecting congratulations when he landed, his commander was critical of his actions, receiving three days of confinement for failing to carry out an order. Days later, Marseille was passed over for promotion and was now the sole Fähnrich in the Geschwader. This was a humiliation for him, suspecting that his abilities were being suppressed so the squadron leaders could take all <b>the</b> <b>glory</b> in the air.|$|E

5|$|Back at Rome, Tiberius instituted the Sodales Augustales, a priesthood of {{the cult}} of Augustus which Germanicus became a member of. When news arrived of his raid, Tiberius commemorated his {{services}} in the Senate with elaborate, but insincere praise: the proceedings gave him joy that the mutiny had been suppressed, but anxiety at <b>the</b> <b>glory</b> and popularity afforded to Germanicus. The Senate, in absence of Germanicus, voted {{that he should be}} given a triumph. Ovid's Fasti dates the Senate vote of Germanicus' triumph to 1 January AD 15.|$|E
5|$|Christodorus of Coptus, an Egyptian {{poet and}} writer wrote a lengthy (416 lines long) hexameter piece of poetry {{inspired}} by <b>the</b> <b>glory</b> of the statues housed within {{the halls of}} the Baths of Zeuxippus. This poem actually consisted of a number of short epigrams (six in total), each focusing on one or a small group of statues within the Baths, designed to combine to form one work. While {{it has been suggested that}} the epigrams of Christodorus of Coptus may actually have been inscribed on the (bases) of the statues themselves, this is unlikely because of his use of the ekphrastic medium, and the presence of the past tense in the text.|$|E
5|$|Due to its {{criticism}} of Albrecht and the event it portrayed, the painting often {{is seen as}} strongly anti-Prussian. While it appears to glorify Poland, it is also critical of the country. Matejko went beyond portraying <b>the</b> <b>glory</b> of a historical event and attempted to convey hints of how the country's history would play out in the future. This event was merely a hollow victory that failed to secure Poland's future. Matejko shows that the homage was an empty gesture {{and that it was}} Prussia that exploited it rather than Poland. Nobody in the painting is smiling except a lady of the court who is engaged in idle gossip.|$|E
