Structural equation modelling showed that attitudes towards counterfeiting were the strongest predictors of WBCG. In addition, material values predicted both WBCG directly and indirectly through attitudes towards counterfeiting.

There were no sex differences in WBCG once participants' age and conscientiousness had been taken into account.

40|$|While at {{one time}} {{counterfeit}} products were largely restricted to watches, designer apparel, and movies, today counterfeiting {{is a major problem}} in such diverse product categories as pharmaceuticals, automotive parts, and computer software. There are four distinct <b>types</b> <b>of</b> counterfeits: knockoffs, <b>counterfeits</b> that are reverse engineered from genuine goods, goods produced by outsourced suppliers on "third shifts," and goods that do not meet a manufacturer's standards but are not properly labeled as seconds or destroyed. The quality <b>of</b> some <b>counterfeits</b> is so good that some major retailers have unknowingly purchased counterfeits. But while there are new forms <b>of</b> <b>counterfeit</b> goods, there are also new strategies for combating counterfeiting. This article describes how to detect and reduce counterfeiting activity, via a plan which consists of four steps: (1) developing early warning signals of counterfeiting; (2) budgeting to monitor, deter, and remove counterfeits; (3) using demand-side strategies to deter counterfeiting; and (4) using supply-side strategies to deter counterfeiting. ...|$|R
40|$|As {{integration}} scales to the 20 nm {{regime and}} below, the integrated circuit (IC) design hasseen the billion transistor counts. For instance, the latest Pascal GPU using 16 nm FinFETtechnology from Nvidia has 150 billion transistors. As a result, {{it becomes very}} challengingto verify those billion-transistor chips {{and there is an}} urgent need to develop advancedand parallel simulation technique. On the other hand, the counterfeit ICs have becomea major security threat for commercial and mission-critical systems. In addition to thehuge economic impacts, they post significant security and safety threats on those systems. The objective of this thesis is to develop new techniques to address above two tough issuesencountered in VLSI research: new fast parallel circuit simulation and potential solutionsto mitigate the counterfeit IC problem. To accelerate the circuit simulation, we study several important linear algebraoperations in simulation steps, such as sparse matrix-vector multiplication (SpMV), directlinear LU factorization and iterative general minimum residual linear solver. Parallel computing such as general purpose GPU programs are good solutions for improving performance of these operations. We apply GPU for these tasks and attain impressive speedup over traditional or CPU methods. All algorithms and implementations are demonstrated withrepresentative numerical experiments and thorough comparisons among different methodsand platforms. For various <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>counterfeit</b> ICs - recycled, remarked, cloned, out-of-spec, andover-produced, we propose a multi-functional on-chip sensor and post-authentication policyfor detecting and preventing them. Especially for recycled ICs, we propose two kindsof aging sensors, which are based on electromigration (EM) -induced aging effects and ring oscillator (RO) -based frequency aging effects. These two aging sensors can effectively detectchip usage time for both short and long periods. Simulated results show the advantage of theproposed multi-purpose sensor against the existing on-chip sensors in terms of functionality,detection coverage and usage time estimation range and accuracy...|$|R

This would be an important evidence of robustness to crease, as crease is a very natural source of variation of banknotes. While the EU 5 sample only contains genuine holograms, for the other <b>types,</b> a number <b>of</b> <b>counterfeited</b> holograms were acquired, i.e., 16 examples for EU 20, 23 examples for EU 50, 14 examples for EU 100, and 9 examples for EU 500.|$|R

40|$|Since {{the late}} eighties, {{when it was}} first mentioned, the {{worldwide}} phenomenon <b>of</b> pharmaceutical <b>counterfeiting</b> is growing. Belgian customs often encounter presumed counterfeited medical products in Belgian airports and ports because of their central position in Europe and their importance in the transit of goods. Further and deeper analyses are required to assess the <b>counterfeit</b> character <b>of</b> these goods and to provide a scientific basis for the eventual legal procedure. As reference laboratory for the federal agency for medicines and health products (FAMHP), the Scientific Institute of Public Health (IPH) frequently analyses illegal and counterfeit pharmaceutical preparations. The present research project was started with the objective of evaluating several existing methods and developing new analytical methods to detect counterfeit erectile dysfunction drugs. This thesis is focused on the analysis of illegal samples <b>of</b> phosphodiesterase <b>type</b> 5 inhibitors (PDE 5 -i) containing drugs because these are the most counterfeited pharmaceutical specialities in Belgium. The research was divided into a spectroscopic and a chromatographic part: Infrared based spectroscopies have already demonstrated their ability to detect counterfeit drugs. The first part of the study evaluates the capacity of each technique (mid-infrared (mid-IR), near-infrared (NIR) and Raman spectroscopy) separately and their combinations to discriminate genuine from illegal tablets. Then, the Classification And Regression Trees (CART) algorithm has been used to classify the different samples following the classification system of the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM). The second spectroscopic approach used Raman microspectroscopy mapping to detect counterfeited Viagra®. This technique allows the detection of different compounds according to their Raman spectrum but also the study of the distribution of a selected ingredient among the core of a tablet. The chromatographic part consists of the development and validation of a new Ultra High Pressure Liquid Chromatography method coupled with a UV diode array detector (UHPLC-DAD) and compatible with mass spectrometry (MS) to detect and quantify the three authorised phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (sildenafil, tadalafil and vardenafil) and five of their analogues in illegal pharmaceutical preparations. This method has been validated between +/- 5 % acceptance limits using the total error approach and has been compared to the official Viagra® assay method. The ability of HPLC-UV impurity fingerprints to detect illegal samples and to predict whether a new unknown sample is genuine has also been evaluated. The developed analytical methods may be included in a general approach to detect counterfeit drugs containing PDE 5 -i. This generic approach may also be used to detect other <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>counterfeited</b> drugs but should therefore be adapted for each <b>type</b> <b>of</b> medicine...|$|R
