40|$|There are {{two basic}} ways of {{surgical}} treatment of femoral neck fracture - <b>total</b> <b>endoprosthesis</b> or a special metal screw in the bone. In case of a dense enough bone the screws are preferred. But for a too parse bone, the screw may cut through the femoral head, which results in further surgical operations. We present a novel method for femoral head density measurement, which serves as another hint for the doctor's decision, whether to apply a screw or <b>total</b> <b>endoprosthesis.</b> Our approach is based on semi-automatical femoral head segmentation from CT dataset based on finding optimal path through polar coordinates on axial slices. The cost function {{is based on a}} combination of corticallis properties, mostly the directional behavior of 3 D gradients and their size in 2 D slices, where they form typical "channels". The final volume is computed using filling and morphological algorithms and its properties are further measured.

40|$|The article {{represents}} a comparative roent¬gen¬morphometric analysis of hip joint deformation development in femoral head aseptic necrosis (FHAN) {{that was done}} to identify criteria which determine {{the selection of the}} acetabular component of the <b>total</b> hip joint <b>endoprosthesis.</b> There were analysed 234 hip joint radiograms of patients with FHAN performed in anterior-posterior plane. Radiograms were subdivided into 3 groups concerning staging of the process: stage II – 18 radiograms, stage III – 84 radiograms, stage IV – 132 radiograms. Analyzing the acetabular retraction (AR) following indices were assessed: sphe¬ricity coefficient α (α = r/d), proportionality coefficient β (β = n/r), compliance coefficient γ (γ = h/r), where r – radius of the acetabulum, n – thickness of the acetabular bottom, h – height of the “Napoleon’s hat”. In addition, there was assessed presense of the major trabecular structures of the supra-acetabular area (A,B,C). Score assessment system, based on the identified indices of changing tendencies in FHAN was offered. There were determined the first level criteria, characterizing the acetabular and supra-acetabular area state. Besides, individual factors of the patient (sex, age) which substantially determine endoprosthesis stability in the remote postoperative period were related to second level criteria. Basing on the assessment of the first and second level criteria algorithm of choice of the <b>total</b> hip <b>endoprosthesis</b> component was developed.

The innovation is the non-cemented fixation together {{with the use of a}} navigation system. Scope and Methods: Sixty patients with gonarthrosis were included consecutively in this study. In all cases, the cementless Columbus <b>total</b> knee <b>endoprosthesis</b> with a coating out of pure titanium was implanted, using a navigation system. The Knee Society Score showed a statistically significant increase from 75 (± 21. 26) before surgery to 180 (± 16. 15) after a mean follow-up of 5. 6 (± 0. 25) years. The last radiological examination revealed no osteolysis. No radiolucent lines were seen at any time in the area of the femoral prosthetic components. In the tibial area, radiolucent lines were seen in 24. 4 % of the cases, mostly in the distal uncoated part of the stem. During follow-up, no prosthesis had to be replaced because of aseptic loosening while in 2 cases revision surgery was necessary due to septic loosening and in 1 case due to unexplainable pain.

40|$|Purpose Oncologic resections or {{complications}} of segmental femoral prostheses {{can result in}} severe bone loss of the femur for which a total femoral prosthesis (TFP) is required. This study assesses whether the loss of stability and function caused {{by the loss of}} muscle attachments can be improved by using a push-through <b>total</b> femoral <b>endoprosthesis</b> (PTTF), because it saves parts of the femur and its muscle attachments. Methods In this retrospective case series, ten patients aged 25 - 77 (mean 54) who received a PTTF between 2005 and 2014 were included for baseline, complications and survival analysis with a mean follow-up of 5. 3 (1. 1 - 9. 6) years. Functional outcome was assessed in six patients using the Musculoskeletal Tumor Society (MSTS) score, WHO performance scale, Toronto Extremity Salvage Score (TESS), SF 36, EQ- 5 D, NRS pain score, fatigue score and satisfaction score. Results The mean MSTS score was 64 %(23 - 93 %). Five patients had a WHO performance scale of 1, one patient of 3. Mean TESS was 69 % (13 - 90 %). SF 36 was most notably limited by physical functioning (mean 48), vitality (68) and general health (67). NRS score was 1. 9, 1. 8 and 8. 3 for pain, fatigue and satisfaction, respectively. There were four failures: two infections (one resulting in amputation and one in a minor revision) and two mechanical failures (which required one revision to a TFP and one minor revision). Patient survival was 100 %, limb survival 90 %, and prosthesis survival 80 %.

40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{focuses on}} the differences in nursing care of patients after TEP (<b>total</b> <b>endoprosthesis)</b> and after CCEP (cervical-capital endoprosthesis). The reason that led me {{to deal with this}} subject was the fact that I consider the knowledge of this matter as well as observing its principles by nurses for necessary. The objective of the thesis was to find out whether nurses know the difference in the nursing care of patients after TEP and CCEP, and whether they observe the differences in the nursing care. These objectives were fulfilled in the bachelor thesis. Two hypotheses were laid down. Hypothesis 1 : Nurses know the difference in nursing care of patients after TEP and CCEP. Hypothesis 2 : Nurses observe the difference in nursing care of patients after TEP and CCEP. The hypotheses were confirmed. The theoretical part of the thesis is focused on the anatomy and physiology of the hip bone and the historical development of endoprostheses. Further, the subject of the TEP and CCEP is dealt with here. It contains descriptions of the differences in the nursery care that nurses should put a lot of emphasis on and observe them. In the research part, the quantitative investigation by means of the questioning method, {{in the form of a}} questionnaire, and the qualitative research by means of the method of participating hidden observation, were chosen to verify the hypotheses. In practice, this thesis may be used in seminars, in which even the results of investigations may be dealt with, thus increasing the quality of the nursing care of patients after TEP (<b>total</b> <b>endoprosthesis)</b> and CCEP (cervical-capital endoprosthesis) ...|$|E
40|$|Basic {{theoretical}} background: Because {{this thesis}} mainly {{deals with the}} awareness of clients, it was necessary in the beginning to mention {{the importance of the}} communication in a medical environment. Communication takes place between two or more people. During communication, people communicate necessary information, feelings, attitudes, talking about relationships and moods. There are several communication rules that one should follow, however, it depends on the individual, whether follow it or not. Communication skills can be developed gradually for they are important to us and in our personal lives. If a person loses the ability to communicate, it can lead to danger to his relationships with others. For healthcare professionals, it is very important social skill (Mikuláštík 2003). Main aim of the thesis: To verify the information rate of clients in preoperative phase of total hip arthroplasty and in postoperative care. Discover also whether patients after <b>total</b> <b>endoprosthesis</b> have possibility of aftercare (rehabilitation, spa treatment). From these targets were developed following questions : In what areas are the clients in preoperative stage informed? How are clients reporting in a post-operative care ? What options of aftercare patients after <b>total</b> <b>endoprosthesis</b> have? Methodology: For the research was used the qualitative survey data collection. A qualitative investigation was approved by head nurse of the hospital, where the research has been done. The interviews was realized at home of clients. Survey was conducted through semi-structured interviews, interviews were anonymous. The data were collected in March 2015 in the set of seven respondents. Despite the fact that interviews were realized in the clients' home, we needed approval for the research from the head nurse. Especially because the subsequent care for patients after total prosthesis was also investigated. It was therefore important to identify initially the applicable patients in the hospital and up to a certain time after the surgery to interview them...|$|E

40|$|The main {{aim of this}} {{bachelor}} {{study is}} concentrated on an after- total- knee- joint endoprosthesis physiotherapy from the surgical solution point of view. The <b>total</b> <b>endoprosthesis</b> is used as the very last possible option of an invasive means of therapy that is possible to take an advantage of when there is extensive damage of biomechanics of a knee joint. When speaking about the frequency of this operation, it is very high, and it is becoming a more and more common way of surgery that is nowadays being practised. The only more frequent orthopaedic surgery these days is a total hip endoprosthesis implantation. As a result of longer durability of the endoprostheses as well as better joint stability and owing to the great technological development {{it is possible to}} use various materials for making endoprostheses. However, there are appropriate demands on both the competence of the operational and consequently the rehabilitative staff working with a complicated structure of the prostheses. The study is divided into the theoretical and practical part. First, in the theoretical part there you can find analysed anatomy and biomechanics of a knee joint. Secondly, there are described indications and contra- indications of the <b>total</b> <b>endoprosthesis</b> implantation, types of total endoprostheses as well as the possibility of consequent physiotherapy. In addition, a method of qualitative research was used in the practical part of the study. There were two groups of patients under the reseach- including two women aged between 61 and 70 in each group. A different means of surgery for the <b>total</b> <b>endoprosthesis</b> of the knee joint was applied in each of the groups. There was also {{the same amount of time}} for the research of both groups. An entry kinesiological analysis was taken the sixth day after the surgery. Consequently the output kinesiological analysis was done after the second orthopaedical check- up (approximately the third month after the surgery), when a hundred per cent tread on the operated limb was permitted. The research itself took place in a hospital, afterwards it continued in domestic surrounding at home using available aids. Providing anamneses of all patients a goniometrical, anthropometrical and palpational check- ups of the knee joint were done. Furthermore, according to Janda, a muscle test and a check- up of shortened muscle groups related to the knee- joint were done as well. A functional check- up of a knee- joint muscles and an endoprosthesis itself was included in the output kinesiological analysis. All the patients were offered the same exercise unit to make better evaluation of the research. The frequency of regular exercise was set to a four-time period per week. An anthropometric check up showed that a post surgical swelling was more significant with the patients after the lateral parapatelar cut, that slows down patients' active joining the short- period kinesiotherapeutic schedule. The range of the movement in the operated knee joint was one of the main observing aspects that much differed already at the entry kinesiological check- up. The aim of the therapy was to achieve the minimum of 90 degree- active flexion of the knee joint at the end of the research. Both the patients after the medial parapatelar cut achieved the given point a few days earlier because the patients after the lateral parapatelar cut were provided with a motorial splint. This motorial splint enabled the patients to extend the range of movement in the joint. The power of muscles did not fundamentally differ comparing the output check- ups of both the groups, however the patients after the medial parapatelar cut achieved the muscle power degree 5. In addition, after the third month from the surgery, permitting 100 per cent tread on the operated limb, a functional check- up of muscles and the endoprosthesis of the operated knee joint was taken. It revealed stronger stability of the patients after the lateral parapatelar cu...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{contains}} {{the results of}} the stress and reliability analyses of the <b>total</b> hip joint <b>endoprosthesis</b> ceramic head. The modelled system consists of the two parts: ceramic head and steel stem. The ordering of mentioned system is according the norm ISO 7206 - 5. The model production inaccuracies of the contact taper of the head and the stem are considered. The head stresses are obtained from the FEM solution and the head reliability is based on the Weibull weakest link theory...|$|R
40|$|The primary {{stability}} of cementless <b>total</b> hip <b>endoprosthesis</b> is of vital importance for proximate, long-term osteointegration. The extent of micromotions between implant and acetabulum is {{an indicator of}} primary stability. Based on this hypothesis, different cementless hip joint endoprosthesis were studied {{with regard to their}} micromotions. The primary {{stability of}} nine different cementless threaded acetabular cups was studied in an experimental setup with blocks of rigid foam. The micromotions between implant and implant bearing were therefore evaluated under cyclic, sinusoidal exposure. The blocks of polymer foam were prepared according to the Paprosky defect classifications. The micromotions increased with the increasing degree of the defect with all acetabuli tested. Occasionally coefficients of over 200 mu m were measured. From a defect degree of 3 b according to Paprosky, the implants could no longer be appropriately placed. The exterior form of the spherical implants tended to exhibit better coefficients than the conical/parabolic implants. ...|$|R

As no appropriate endoprosthesis was available due to the war in Croatia and war priority, the problem was managed by femur osteosynthesis and implantation of a partial Austin Moore hip endoprosthesis. The endoprosthesis is still functioning well (for 20 years). To the best of the author′s knowledge, nobody has ever treated problem like this using this alternative, an unconventional method, with an Austin Moore endoprosthesis...|$|R
