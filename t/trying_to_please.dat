5|$|In September 2010, Howling Bells started {{recording}} The Loudest Engine at the Killers-owned Battle Born Studios in Las Vegas. It {{was produced}} by bassist Mark Stoermer, whom the group had met while it toured with The Killers. The relationship between Stoermer and Howling Bells strengthened after the band disembarked from its flight to Las Vegas. The flight had been delayed by more than 12 hours, but he had nonetheless waited for them at the airport. Howling Bells were impressed by his style of work. Rather than overproducing, he kept the amount of takes to a minimum and allowed the band just to play, which kept the sessions very natural. The band members became less conscious of <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>please</b> other people, made the record that they wanted, and hoped that it would change people's attitudes toward the band.|$|E

25|$|In Eclipse, Bella {{agrees to}} marry Edward on the {{condition}} he will make love to her while she is still human. Edward eventually relents and agrees, on the stipulation it will only occur after they are married. The plot {{is driven by the}} machinations of the vampire Victoria, who, seeking revenge for the death of her mate James, is hunting Bella and creating new vampires to build an army. A grudging truce is made between the Cullens and the Native-American werewolf pack led by Sam Uley and Jacob Black, a friend of Bella's who was there for her when Edward broke her heart. However, the truce is endangered when Bella realizes Jacob means more to her than she thought. Ultimately, Edward accepts that Bella cares for Jacob and successfully destroys Victoria, and Bella acknowledges that Edward is {{the most important person in}} her life. Edward tells Bella that they may attempt making love before they get married, as he realizes that she spends too much of her life <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>please</b> other people. However, she refuses his offer and agrees to doing things the way Edward initially wanted: marriage, making love, and then becoming a vampire.|$|E
500|$|Oates {{was one of}} the NHL's great playmakers, a {{style that}} he credits his father as encouraging: [...] "It was just kind of our family talks: 'If you can be unselfish, your {{teammates}} will always like you.' And it just kind of became my role, where I was obviously <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>please</b> my dad, growing up and becoming a playmaker out of that." [...] Oates' father, a British immigrant, idolized Stanley Matthews, considered one of the greatest soccer players of all time and hoped that his son would adopt a pass-first mentality similar to Matthews.|$|E
500|$|Dick Adler of the Los Angeles Times {{gave the}} {{documentary}} a positive review, writing: [...] "'The Lord of the Universe' doesn't really take sides, which doesn't mean it's a bland hour <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>please</b> everybody. [...] Its considerable bite comes first from the material TVTV so carefully gathered and {{there from the}} artfully wise frame in which it chose to present it." [...] Deirdre Boyle wrote in Art Journal that the piece was [...] "the zenith of TVTV's guerrilla-TV style". According to Boyle's Subject to Change: Guerrilla Television Revisited, as in all TVTV tapes, everyone in the documentary comes across as foolish, describing the production's sarcasm as the [...] "ultimate leveler" [...] using equal irony [...] "both with the mighty and the lowly".|$|E

500|$|Alan Richardson, {{a scholar}} of 18th-century education, points out that if Wollstonecraft had not written A Vindication of the Rights of Men (1790) and A Vindication of the Rights of Woman, it is {{unlikely}} that Thoughts would have been considered progressive or even worthy of notice. One critic has even said that the text reads as if it were simply <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>please</b> the public. Although some scholars have argued that there are glimmers of Wollstonecraft's radicalism in this text, they admit that the [...] "potential for critique remains largely latent". Thoughts is therefore usually interpreted either teleologically, as a first step towards the more radical Rights of Woman, or dismissed as a [...] "politically naïve potboiler" [...] written prior to Wollstonecraft's conversion to radicalism while she was writing the Rights of Men.|$|E
500|$|The real Abagnale {{never saw}} his father again after he ran away from home. Spielberg [...] "wanted to {{continue}} to have that connection where Frank kept <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>please</b> his father; by making him proud of him; by seeing him in the uniform, the Pan-American uniform". However, Abagnale praised the idea. [...] "Even though I didn't see my dad again, every night after living a brilliant day and meeting many women, and making much money, I'd come back alone to a hotel room and I would just think of {{my mom and dad}} and fantasize about getting them back together again, and cry. It's the justification of a fantasy." [...] Carl Hanratty (portrayed by Tom Hanks) is based on FBI agent Joseph Shea. In the shooting script the character was referred to as Joseph Shea, but was changed to Carl Hanratty for unknown reasons.|$|E
500|$|In this story, Homer is Odysseus, and {{delivers}} the King of Troy (Ned Flanders) a Trojan horse. He and his crew, including Apu, Lenny, Moe, Professor Frink and Carl, kill all of Troy's citizens and win. However, {{he refuses to}} sacrifice a sheep, angering the gods, Zeus (Mayor Quimby), Dionysus (Barney), and Poseidon (Captain Horatio McCallister). Dionysus tries to destroy Odysseus with a lightning bolt, but misses and instead destroys the island of Atlantis. Poseidon literally blows Odysseus and his crew to the Sirens (Patty and Selma) and visit Circe (Lindsey Naegle), who turns his crew into pigs, whom Odysseus eats. Circe orders Odysseus to go through Hades, crossing the River Styx (which has the Styx song [...] "Lady" [...] playing during the crossing), {{in order to go}} home so he can see Penelope (Marge) and Telemachus (Bart). When he arrives back to Ithaca, he spears all of the suitors (Krusty the Klown, Kirk Van Houten, Groundskeeper Willie, Mr. Burns, and Sideshow Mel) <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>please</b> Penelope. Penelope decides to take him back, though he leaves to go to Moe's (even though Moe is killed and eaten by Odysseus earlier in the episode).|$|E

500|$|Her {{departure}} from the guitar-driven rock of her previous works stemmed from the feeling that it was outdated, arguing that [...] "as soon as any form becomes traditional, like the guitar, bass and drums, then people start to behave traditionally," [...] and that [...] "it's really {{difficult to get a}} band to stay on the edge using typical bass, guitar and drums set-up because it tends to lapse into a predictable form." [...] Being a fan of dance music {{since the early days of}} acid house, she thus used it as the framework for her songs. However, in a Rolling Stone interview she also stated that [...] " [...] was more influenced by ambient music than what you'd call dance music, and by things that were happening way back in Chicago and Detroit that were sensual and daring and groundbreaking in their time;" [...] also adding: [...] "Ninety-five percent of the dance music you hear today is crap. It's only that experimental five percent that I'm into—the records that get played in clubs after 7 o'clock in the morning, when the DJs are playing stuff for themselves, rather than <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>please</b> people." [...] Björk's embracement of England's dance culture also extended to her looks, with her style at the time now considered a representative of 1990s acid house fashion.|$|E
500|$|The {{office workers}} are stuck working {{overtime}} {{on a major}} assignment. After asking Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) to confirm {{that he has not}} made any plans for the evening in anticipation of the overtime assignment, Michael Scott (Steve Carell) calls corporate and declares that he is releasing the workers from overtime. Michael then proceeds to invite Jim and his girlfriend Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer) to join him and his girlfriend Jan Levinson (Melora Hardin) for dinner at his condominium after Jim had previously turned him down nine times. When Jim begins to formulate an excuse, Michael reminds him that he just said he hadn't made any plans. Jim begins to suspect that Michael fabricated the overtime assignment and the call to corporate just to maneuver him and Pam into coming to dinner. Michael also invites Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) and Angela Martin (Angela Kinsey), but excludes Angela's former boyfriend Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson), much to Dwight's dismay. On a tour of the condominium, Jan shows the workspace from which she runs her candle-making home business. Jan's dominance in the relationship is apparent from the living arrangements; Michael sleeps on a small bench due to Jan's [...] "space issues", and his sole comfort is a very small [...] "plasma TV," [...] which he bought for $200. It is also later revealed that Michael underwent three vasectomies in the course of <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>please</b> Jan. Throughout the evening, Jan plays a song by her former assistant, Hunter. Titled [...] "That One Night", the lyrics of the song strongly suggest an intimate encounter once occurred between Jan and Hunter.|$|E
500|$|After weak {{sales in}} 2009 of several {{titles in the}} Guitar Hero series, Activision {{proceeded}} to make several changes with their internal development teams. The company dissolved RedOctane, bringing {{in some of the}} staff directly into Activision. Activision further shuttered Neversoft's Guitar Hero division, pending the completion of Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock, with further development in the series to be created by some former Neversoft members and Vicarious Visions. Brian Bright, former Neversoft member and current project lead, noted that part of the poor sales of Guitar Hero in 2009 was a result of a loss of focus with Guitar Hero 5, stating that [...] "we were <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>please</b> everyone out there and I think in the end you end up not pleasing any one person a lot". With Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock, Bright wanted to bring the game back to please the fans of the earlier Guitar Hero games, specifically the highly successful [...] To that end, the team developed a soundtrack [...] "more focused on rock 'n' roll" [...] than the variety of genres within Guitar Hero 5. The songs are more guitar-centric, as proven to be the most popular instrument choice based on Guitar Hero 5. Bright noted they used player statistics from previous games to shape Warriors of Rock; for example, according to Bright, within a month of release, 40% of the players of Guitar Hero 5 were playing on Expert mode, and felt this was the audience they needed to cater to. Bright also stated that the aim of Warriors of Rock was to create a game with [...] "its own identity" [...] from both previous Guitar Hero titles and other rhythm games; [...] "Rather than go head-to-head with our own games and our competitors, we decided we wanted to make something different." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{situation}} {{became so}} tense that {{war with the}} United States seemed imminent. On April 22, 1914, on the initiative of Felix A.

2500|$|Dennis Harvey of Variety {{believed}} that the film lacked {{in comparison to the}} 1972 original in almost every aspect. Harvey felt like the film spent more time <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>please</b> current horror conventions than create an effective update to Craven's film. Harvey criticized the choice of changing a [...] "credibly ordinary family" [...] into [...] "typical modern movie-fantasy clan". He also noted that Dillahunt's portrayal of Krug is no match for David Hess. Michael Rechtshaffen, from The Hollywood Reporter, felt that the remake followed close to the original—something fans of the 1972 film would appreciate—but that the film lacked the timing of the Craven's film. Craven was responding to the graphic images being sent back during the Vietnam War and allowed his film [...] "sociological context", while Iliadis's 2009 film comes across as [...] "exploitative". Although Rechtshaffen points out that the parents lack the training and skill of Liam Neeson's character in Taken, the performances from all of the actors are [...] "uniformly sturdy".|$|E
2500|$|Slav Kandyba of Music Is My Oxygen {{also gave}} a {{positive}} review: [...] "Nipsey's superior delivery and energy is established early with [...] "U See Us" [...] and doesn't stop {{until well into}} the end of the tape’s last track [...] "Crenshaw and Slauson," [...] a 12-minute composition with hidden track following a spoken-word outro. Crenshaws best attribute isn't beat selection or the actual lyrics; it's Nipsey Hussle's persona. He's larger than life and relatable at the same time, not just rhyming but relating to listeners in the same fashion that Tony Robbins speaks at his seminars. Even though drug and gang references are still frequent, the value of Crenshaw as motivational music can't be discounted." [...] Max Weinstein XXL also gave the mixtape a positive review saying, [...] "Crenshaw has its moments, but it ultimately reflects the process of a rapper stretching styles and seeing what he’s most comfortable with. The exercise might not yield many immediate results, but it’s a necessary workout for an artist <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>please</b> loyal fans and potential newcomers." ...|$|E
2500|$|Some prisons provide {{educational}} programs for inmates that can include basic literacy, secondary education, or even college education. Prisoners seek education {{for a variety}} of reasons, including the development of skills for after release, personal enrichment and curiosity, finding something to fill their time, or <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>please</b> prison staff (which can often secure early release for good behavior). However, the educational needs of prisoners often come into conflict with the security concerns of prison staff and with a public that wants to be [...] "tough on crime" [...] (and thus supports denying prisoners access to education). Whatever their reasons for participating in {{educational programs}}, prison populations tend to have very low literacy rates and lack of basic mathematical skills, and many have not completed secondary education. This lack of basic education severely limits their employment opportunities outside of prison, leading to high rates of recidivism, and research has shown that prison education can {{play a significant role in}} helping prisoners reorient their lives and become successful after reentry.|$|E
