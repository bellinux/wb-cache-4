Premiere Performance, a prime <b>time</b> <b>block</b> of Twentieth Century-Fox films, aired from 1957–1959. Other film blocks included TV Hour of Stars and The Big Night (both 1958–1959).|$|E
2500|$|General Martin Dempsey, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said in January 2012 that Iran [...] "has {{invested}} in capabilities that could, in fact, {{for a period}} of <b>time</b> <b>block</b> the Strait of Hormuz."

2500|$|In the NHL, if the non-{{offending}} team scores a goal in {{a delayed}} penalty situation, {{then it is}} treated as if a goal was scored during that penalty. Thus, if the delayed penalty is a minor, the penalty is waved off. If the delayed penalty is a double-minor, only the first two-minute block is waved off, and the offending player must still serve the second <b>time</b> <b>block.</b> These rules {{used to be in}} college hockey as well, until the 2010-2011 season, when it was changed so that the penalty would still be imposed even if a goal was scored. [...] Major penalties and match penalties, which are not affected by goals, are enforced in the usual manner, in both college hockey and the NHL, whether or not a goal is scored.|$|E
50|$|The 1987 bidding cycle gave Coestrellas 4 1/2 {{hours of}} weekly programming, but the allotted <b>time</b> <b>blocks</b> were not choice cuts.

2500|$|In January 1953, Block was {{suspended}} for two weeks because the sponsor objected {{to one of his}} comments during the show. Steve Allen, at the time an up-and-coming comedian whose appearances on What's My Line? would springboard his career, took Block's place on the panel during the suspension. While Block vacationed in Miami {{for the duration of the}} suspension, the network was deluged with letters from his fans demanding his return. Years later, in recollecting these days of What's My Line?, Bennett Cerf argued that by this <b>time</b> <b>Block</b> was no longer essential to the show. [...] According to Cerf, since he had begun to introduce his own jokes and puns into the show, he now had the more important role and Block had [...] "became second banana." [...] Amidst this turmoil, on February 5, 1953, winners for television's Emmy Awards were announced and What's My Line? won the Emmy for [...] "Best Audience Participation, Quiz or Panel Program".|$|E
2500|$|Between March 2, 1997 and May 29, 2000, St.GIGA {{frequently}} {{broadcast a}} ported {{version of the}} original Super Famicom [...] (called [...] in Japan). Unlike the BS Zelda broadcasts and Inishie no Sekiban, the Satellaview version of Kamigami no Triforce was not a SoundLink game, did not feature the BS-X avatars as main characters (but rather used Link as in the original), {{and it was not}} divided into Episodes. More importantly, it was not limited to play-through during a 1-hour block of [...] "Zelda Time" [...] but could instead be downloaded and played at the payer's convenience. Whereas the BS Zelda games and Inishie no Sekiban were strictly limited to this 1-hour block and would be rendered unplayable after the <b>time</b> <b>block</b> had expired, the Satellaview version of Kamigami no Triforce (like a large number of other non-SoundLink titles for the Satellaview) instead utilized an internal play-through counter that would tick down from 5 to 0 for each time the game was played. On reaching 0, the game would be locked and would need to be re-downloaded in order to continue playing.|$|E
60|$|We hear it said, both of Tennyson {{and another}} current leading {{literary}} illustrator of Great Britain, Carlyle--as of Victor Hugo in France--that {{not one of}} them is personally friendly or admirant toward America; indeed, quite the reverse. N'importe. That they (and more good minds than theirs) cannot span the vast revolutionary arch thrown by the United States over the centuries, fixed in the present, launched to the endless future; that they cannot stomach the high-life-below-stairs coloring all our poetic and genteel social status so far--the measureless viciousness of the great radical Republic, with its ruffianly nominations and elections; its loud, ill-pitched voice, utterly regardless whether the verb agrees with the nominative; its fights, errors, eructations, repulsions, dishonesties, audacities; those fearful and varied and long-continued storm and stress stages (so offensive to the well-regulated college-bred mind) wherewith Nature, history, and <b>time</b> <b>block</b> out nationalities more powerful than the past, and to upturn it and press on to the future;--that they cannot understand and fathom all this, I say, is it to be wondered at? Fortunately, the gestation of our thirty-eight empires (and plenty more to come) proceeds on its course, on scales of area and velocity immense and absolute as the globe, and, like the globe itself, quite oblivious even of great poets and thinkers. But we can by no means afford to be oblivious of them.|$|E

5000|$|As per DSM / UI procedure, the {{incentives}} and penalty to the grid participants are charged {{based on the}} average grid frequency in a <b>time</b> <b>block</b> of 15 minutes duration. During a <b>time</b> <b>block,</b> it is normal that frequency goes above rated 50 Hz frequency and comes down below rated frequency {{as the number of}} frequency excursions above 50 Hz are more than 100 in a day. Thus the average frequency in a <b>time</b> <b>block</b> remains close to the 50 Hz without giving much benefit in the applicable UI tariff for a Discom who is consuming the surplus power available in the grid or generators with valid scheduling who is reducing the generation when frequency is above 50 Hz. Similarly, the generators and Discoms who are not adhering to grid discipline are not penalised with UI tariff in excess of normal tariff when average grid frequency in a <b>time</b> <b>block</b> is used for fixing UI/DSM charges. Each <b>time</b> <b>block</b> is further needs to be separated into two parts for application of UI charges. One for the duration the frequency is more than 50 Hz whose average frequency is considered for fixing UI/ DSM charges to consume the excess power in the grid or reduce excess power generation. Another for the duration the frequency is less than 50 Hz whose average frequency is considered for fixing UI/DSM charges to reduce over drawl and encourage additional power generation.|$|E
