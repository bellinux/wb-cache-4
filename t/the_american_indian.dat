In his writings he mentions that <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>Indians</b> (Red man) was merely rightfully fighting for the land that they (the Chippewas) deserve and have lived on far longer than the white man. George R.

5|$|The United States also observes tribal {{sovereignty}} of <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>Indian</b> nations {{to a limited}} degree, as it does with the states' sovereignty.

5|$|Although often {{assumed to}} be a debate of recent origins, local Washington, D.C. {{newspapers}} have published news items on the controversy many times since at least 1971, all in response to Native American individuals or organizations asking for the name to be changed. National protests began in 1988, after the team's Super Bowl XXII victory, prompting numerous Native Americans to write letters to Redskins owner Jack Kent Cooke; others boycotted Redskins products and protested, but Cooke rejected the possibility of change. There was a protest of about 2,000 people at the 1992 Super Bowl between the Redskins and the Buffalo Bills; <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>Indian</b> Movement's (AIM) Vernon Bellecourt {{was one of the main}} organizers of the protest.|$|E

5|$|Churchill {{has been}} active since at least 1984 as the co-director of the Denver-based American Indian Movement of Colorado, now an {{autonomous}} chapter of <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>Indian</b> Movement. In 1993, he and other local AIM leaders, including Russell Means, Glenn T. Morris, Robert Robideau, and David Hill, broke with the national AIM leadership, including Dennis Banks and the brothers Vernon and Clyde Bellecourt, claiming that all AIM chapters are autonomous. The AIM Grand Governing Council is based in Minneapolis and retains {{the name of the}} national group. It says that the schism arose when Means, Churchill, Glenn T. Morris and others openly supported the Miskito Indian group Misurasata, who were allied with the anti-revolutionary, CIA-backed Contras.|$|E
5|$|In 1993, a {{group of}} {{professional}} artists established the Montana Artists Refuge in Basin.

The organization sponsored annual art events including <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>Indian</b> Artists Symposium and the Basin City Jazz Art Experience, held in the Basin Community Hall. All types of artists, including potters, painters, musicians, dancers, singers, weavers, and writers, had residencies in Basin. The refuge closed in October 2011.|$|E
5|$|In many early western {{films and}} literature, Native Americans were often portrayed as savages; having {{conflicts}} and battles against gunfighters and white settlements. According to the U.S. Bureau of the Census (1894), {{an estimate of}} 19,000 white men, {{women and children were}} killed while the Indians killed numbered between 30,000 and 45,000 casualties during <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>Indian</b> Wars. Gunfighters in history did fight Native Americans. Among them was civilian Billy Dixon, who made one of the longest recorded sniper kills, by shooting an Indian off his horse almost a mile away with his Sharps rifle, during a standoff in the Second Battle of Adobe Walls.|$|E

5|$|Several of {{the founders}} of <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>Indian</b> Movement, {{including}} Clyde Bellecourt, Vernon Bellecourt, Dennis Banks and Russel Means, {{were among the first to}} protest names and mascots such as the Washington Redskins and Chief Wahoo. Vernon Bellecourt also founded the National Coalition Against Racism in Sports and Media (NCARSM) in 1989. Cornel Pewewardy (Comanche-Kiowa), Professor and Director of Indigenous Nations Studies at Portland State University, cites indigenous mascots as an example of dysconscious racism which, by placing images of Native American or First Nations people into an invented media context, continues to maintain the superiority of the dominant culture. Such practices can be seen as a form of cultural imperialism or neocolonialism.|$|E
5|$|The Redskins {{controversy}} began receiving {{more attention}} in 2013, {{starting with a}} symposium in February on the topic at the Smithsonian's National Museum of <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>Indian</b> in Washington, D.C. Subsequently, the Oneida Indian Nation of New York sponsored a series of radio ads in each city to coincide with games of the 2013 season, each featuring a targeted message. A broader range of persons spoke in favor of change or open discussion, including local government leaders, members of Congress, and President Barack Obama. Statements {{in support of a}} name change by civil rights and religious organizations were added to those that Native American groups have been making for decades.|$|E
5|$|When the country's {{fortunes}} turned {{during the}} Great Depression, the violent Teamsters Strike of 1934 resulted in laws acknowledging workers' rights. A lifelong {{civil rights activist}} and union supporter, mayor Hubert Humphrey helped the city establish fair employment practices and a human relations council that interceded on behalf of minorities by 1946. In the 1950s, about 1.6% {{of the population of}} Minneapolis was nonwhite.

5|$|The {{image of}} a Wild West filled with countless gunfights was a myth {{generated}} primarily by dime-novel authors in the late 19th century. An estimate of 20,000 men in the American West were killed by gunshot between 1866 and 1900, and over 21,586 total casualties during <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>Indian</b> Wars from 1850 to 1890. The most notable and well-known {{took place in the}} states/territories of Arizona, New Mexico, Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas. Actual gunfights in the Old West were very rare, very few and far between, but when gunfights did occur, the cause for each varied. Some were simply the result of the heat of the moment, while others were longstanding feuds, or between bandits and lawmen. Lawless violence such as range wars like the Lincoln County War and clashes with Indians were also a cause. Some of these shootouts became famous, while others faded into history with only a few accounts surviving. To prevent gunfights from happening, many cities in the American frontier, such as Dodge City and Tombstone, put up a local ordinance to prohibit firearms in the area.|$|E
5|$|There are ten wars {{involving}} the United States {{for which the}} Medal of Honor has been bestowed upon a USMA alumnus. More {{than half of the}} alumni who received the distinction were thereby recognized for actions in either the American Civil War or <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>Indian</b> Wars; twenty-five alumni were awarded the medal in connection with the Civil War and twenty-one in connection with the Indian Wars. Four alumni were recognized for their contributions to the Spanish–American War, nine for the Philippine–American War, two for the Boxer Rebellion, and one for the Banana Wars. While only one alumnus received the Medal of Honor for actions in World War I, ten alumni were so recognized for actions in World War II. The final two conflicts for which the Medal of Honor was given to USMA alumni are the Korean War, for which two alumni were recognized, and the Vietnam War, for which eight alumni were recognized.|$|E
5|$|With no {{resources}} available from either Congress or the Continental Army, Irvine gave permission for volunteers to organize their own offensive. Detroit {{was too far}} and too strong for a small-scale operation, but militiamen such as David Williamson believed that an expedition against <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>Indian</b> towns on the Sandusky River was feasible. It {{was to be a}} low-budget campaign. Each volunteer had to provide at his expense a horse, rifle, ammunition, rations, and other equipment. Their only payment would be an exemption from two months of militia duty, plus whatever plunder might be taken from the Indians. Because of ongoing Indian raids—the wife and children of a Baptist minister were killed and scalped in western Pennsylvania on May 12, 1782—there was no shortage of men willing to volunteer.|$|E
