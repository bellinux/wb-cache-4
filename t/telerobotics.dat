40|$|<b>Telerobotic</b> systems plays {{important}} role in hazardous environment applications. In the past, the design of controllers for <b>telerobotic</b> systems {{and the performance of}} the operators have been treated as separated issues. In the controller design, most of researches focus on the stability or transparency of the <b>telerobotic</b> systems. For the aspect of operators, researches have been concentrated on evaluation of the performance of the operators. However, the efficiency and safety of a <b>telerobotic</b> system directly depend on the real-time integration and interactions of the controllers and operators. This paper proposes a concept named Quality of Teleoperator (QoT) to represent the confidence and quality of the decisions and commands generated by a teleoperator. The value of QoT is generated by a set of quantities describing the mental statuses of the teleoperator, which can be measured in real-time based on the operator's electroencephalography (EEG) signals. The controller of the <b>telerobotic</b> system will adjust its parameters based on the QoT in real-time to adapt the confidence and quality of the operator in order to achieve an optimal system performance. Based on QoT, an adaptation scheme for the control system is designed to enhance the efficiency and safety of the <b>telerobotic</b> system. In the paper, the analysis and design methods for QoT based controllers will be discussed. The theoretical analysis and experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed methods. Link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} an {{environment for the}} design, simulation and control of Internetbased force-reflecting <b>telerobotic</b> systems. We define these systems as using {{a segment of the}} computer network to connect the master to the slave. Computer networks introduce a time-delay that is best described by a time-varying random process. Thus, known techniques for controlling time-delay telerobots are not directly applicable, and an environment for iterative design-and-test is necessary. The underlying software architecture supports tools for modeling the delay of the computer network, designing a stable controller, simulating the performance of a <b>telerobotic</b> system, and testing the control algorithms using a force-reflecting input device. Furthermore, this set-up provides data about including Internet into more general <b>telerobotic</b> control architectures.

50|$|With the {{exception}} of the Apollo program, most space exploration has been conducted with <b>telerobotic</b> space probes. Most space-based astronomy, for example, has been conducted with <b>telerobotic</b> telescopes. The Russian Lunokhod-1 mission, for example, put a remotely driven rover on the moon, which was driven in real time (with a 2.5-second lightspeed time delay) by human operators on the ground. Robotic planetary exploration programs use spacecraft that are programmed by humans at ground stations, essentially achieving a long-time-delay form of <b>telerobotic</b> operation. Recent noteworthy examples include the Mars exploration rovers (MER) and the Curiosity rover. In the case of the MER mission, the spacecraft and the rover operated on stored programs, with the rover drivers on the ground programming each day's operation. The International Space Station (ISS) uses a two-armed telemanipulator called Dextre. More recently, a humanoid robot Robonaut has been added to the space station for <b>telerobotic</b> experiments.|$|R
