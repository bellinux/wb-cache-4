Like my life, there's no escape. I feel the responsibility of this film. I cannot talk about Evita and her life without defending myself... Dear God, what have I gotten myself into? What is happening to me? Today we went to shoot a music video for my next song. But I kept forgetting the lyrics, and felt like crying each and every <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> it. It was so frustrating. It's my own song!" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{title track}} was a {{time-consuming}} project; Lindstrøm {{called it a}} [...] "nightmare to finish." [...] The song comprised over 70 layers of sound and spanned almost 30 minutes. Around half the sound consisted of live performances, which Lindstrøm found difficult to merge with the electronic portions. After changing the music, he would usually listen to the entire song and evaluate the change. The repeated listens took a toll: [...] "I needed to listen to 30 minutes of music every <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> something," [...] said Lindstrom [...] "So I'll never gonna [...] do it again." [...] Despite this, he enjoyed working with extended songs because it allowed them to evolve and move at a slow pace.|$|E

500|$|In Stage one (obedience and {{punishment}} driven), individuals {{focus on the}} direct {{consequences of their actions}} on themselves. For example, an action is perceived as morally wrong because the perpetrator is punished. [...] "The last <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> that I got spanked, so I will not do it again." [...] The worse the punishment for the act is, the more [...] "bad" [...] the act is perceived to be. This can give rise to an inference that even innocent victims are guilty in proportion to their suffering. It is [...] "egocentric", lacking recognition that others' points of view are different from one's own. There is [...] "deference to superior power or prestige".|$|E
500|$|One of Paul's main storylines {{culminated in}} him having his leg amputated after an accident. The storyline has {{received}} some criticism as Paul was shown on different occasions not limping with his false leg. Dennis explained {{during an interview}} how the production team helped ensure to make his limp appear more effectively, stating [...] "They made me a splint which actually makes me sort of limp, but keeps my foot rigid {{so it looks like}} I actually do have a non-moving piece. One <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> change my leg, as in I swapped it over and limped on the other one to see if anyone noticed."

On his casting, he commented, [...] "It's a great privilege to be working with such great actors and on such an established show. It's an amazing opportunity and I'm really enjoying tackling a character like Leon who has so much going on," [...] He prepared for the role by attending a gym, as the character has a lot of topless scenes. He said: [...] "As soon as I heard that I was straight down the gym. Lots of crunches. Everyone said don't worry about it, but every <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> one of those scenes I had to watch it back and see how it looked because there will be 10 million people watching it.

[...] "Back then, [...] was a different culture", Rodriguez said. [...] "It was very loose. I was young, I was stupid, I was naïve.

2500|$|A {{year after}} his dismissal, in July 1991, Adler {{filed a lawsuit against}} his former Guns N' Roses band mates, contending that he was fired because the opiate-blocking drug he had been taking to aid his detox {{interfered}} with his concentration. He also alleged that the contract he had been made to sign took away his financial interest in the band, stating, [...] "I was told that every <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> heroin, the band would fine me $2,000. ... What these contracts actually said was that the band were paying me $2,000 to leave. They were taking my royalties, all my writing credits. They didn't like me any more and just wanted me gone." [...] The case was settled out of court in 1993; Adler received a back-payment check of $2,250,000 and was granted 15% of the royalties for everything he recorded prior to his departure.|$|E

2500|$|White founded Third Man Records in 2001. However, it was {{not until}} after he moved to Nashville that White {{purchased}} a space in 2009 to house his label. He explained, [...] "For the longest <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not want to have my own studio gear, mostly because with the White Stripes I wanted to have the constriction of going into a studio and having a set time of 10 days or two weeks to finish an album, and using whatever gear they happen to have there.

2500|$|In 2004, Santos took on {{the lead}} role in Joel Lamangan's drama Sabel. Based in part on Joanne Woodward's The Three Faces of Eve, the film, under the {{manuscript}} of Ricky Lee, stars Santos as the titular lead who suffers from Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID) formerly known as multiple personality disorder—eventually charged with murder. Gigi Javier-Alfonso of The Philippine Daily Tribune noted, [...] "Santos is superior in her performance in this brave new film [...] quite sympathetic and certainly not painted as villain", whilst Lito B. Zulueta of The Philippine Daily Inquirer remarked [...] "It [...] is absorbing to watch because of its assay at the riddle of sexuality {{as well as the}} performance of Santos". Asked about her significant career milestone, Santos stated [...] " [...] I feel that this is my transition film because this is the first <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> a film like this. I'm already 26 years old and I think it is hightime that I do films like this."

2500|$|The Herald {{published}} {{a story on}} May 3 that Hart had spent Friday night and most of Saturday with {{a young woman in}} his Washington, D.C. townhouse. On that same day, in an interview with E. J. Dionne that appeared in the New York Times, Hart, responding to the rumors of his womanizing, said: [...] "Follow me around. I don't care. I'm serious. If anybody wants to put a tail on me, go ahead. They'll be very bored." [...] The Heralds reporters at some point learned that the New York Times was planning to feature the story with the quote on Sunday, incorporated it into their story, and the two articles appearing on the same day ignited a political firestorm. On Sunday, Hart's campaign denied any scandal and condemned the Heralds reporters for intrusive reporting. [...] Hart later noted that his [...] "follow me around" [...] comment was not [...] "challenging the press with a taunt", but, made in frustration, was only intended to invite the media to observe his public behavior, and [...] never intended to invite reporters to be [...] "skulking around in the shadows" [...] of his home. [...] '“He did not {{think of it as a}} challenge,” Dionne would recall many years later. “And at the <b>time,</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not think of it as a challenge.”' [...] Nor did Hart's comment influence the Miami Herald to pursue the story.|$|E
2500|$|Following the Iranian Revolution, the Carter {{administration}} {{continued to}} see Iran as a bulwark against Iraq and the Soviet Union, and therefore attempted {{to forge a}} strategic partnership with the new Interim Government of Iran under Prime Minister Mehdi Bazargan. [...] "Acting head of the U.S. embassy in Tehran" [...] Bruce Laingen realized that Iranian officials were acutely interested in U.S. intelligence on Iraq, and convinced Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs Harold H. Saunders to approve an intelligence-sharing liaison with the Iranian government, culminating in an October 15, 1979 meeting between longtime Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) officer George Cave and the Iranian Deputy Prime Minister Abbas Amir-Entezam and Foreign Minister Ebrahim Yazdi. Cave told Mark J. Gasiorowski that he briefed Entezam and Yazdi on Iraqi military preparations and covert operations seemingly designed to facilitate a large-scale invasion of Iran, although no final decision had been made. (The content of Cave's briefing was corroborated by Laingen, Yazdi, Entezam, and Bazargan.) In particular, echoing a March 1979 warning from Pentagon analyst Howard Teicher regarding Iraqi designs on Iran's oil-rich Khuzestan Province, Cave pointed out that Iraq had created a front organization that could instigate unrest among Khuzestan's majority–Arab inhabitants—yet Cave emphasized that war could still be avoided if the strength of Iran's armed forces did not continue its post-revolutionary decline. Furthermore, Cave urged his Iranian interlocutors to monitor the movement of Iraqi troops with [...] "the IBEX listening posts the CIA had constructed in northern Iran" [...] under the Shah. Although Teicher and Cave's predictions proved accurate, they were the product of circumstantial evidence disputed internally within the U.S. government, and the significance of Cave's briefing has been debated. For example, according to Bureau of Intelligence and Research analyst Wayne White, who {{was not aware of}} the intelligence that informed Cave's briefing: [...] "The Iraqi army was doing little more than continuing its well-known annual schedule of primarily battalion and brigade-level training exercises... Very little of the Iraqi military was anywhere near the Iraqi-Iranian frontier." [...] Similarly, the head of the Iran desk at the State Department, Henry Precht, stated: [...] "I had no impression at the time that anyone believed Iraq was planning a major attack although we thought that [...] Saddam [...] might be stirring up the Kurds. At the <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not think he would take on his larger and still probably more potent neighbor." [...] On the other hand, Gasiorowski contended that [...] "If Iran's leaders had acted on the information provided in Cave's briefings... the brutal eight–year [...] might never have occurred." ...|$|E
