5|$|Just as the Black Codes, enacted {{after the}} Civil War to {{restrict}} <b>the</b> <b>free</b> <b>exercise</b> of those rights, were substitutes for the slave system, so {{the exclusion of}} Negroes from white communities became {{a substitute for the}} Black Codes. And when racial discrimination herds men into ghettos and makes their ability to buy property turn on the color of their skin, then it too is a relic of slavery.|$|E

5|$|The First Amendment (Amendment I) to the United States Constitution {{prevents}} Congress {{from making}} any law respecting an establishment of religion, prohibiting <b>the</b> <b>free</b> <b>exercise</b> of religion, or abridging {{the freedom of}} speech, {{the freedom of the}} press, the right to peaceably assemble, or to petition for a governmental redress of grievances. It was adopted on December 15, 1791, as one of the ten amendments that constitute the Bill of Rights.|$|E
5|$|The First Amendment {{prohibits the}} making of any law {{respecting}} an establishment of religion, impeding <b>the</b> <b>free</b> <b>exercise</b> of religion, abridging the freedom of speech, infringing on {{the freedom of the}} press, interfering with the right to peaceably assemble or prohibiting the petitioning for a governmental redress of grievances. Initially, the First Amendment applied only to laws enacted by Congress, and many of its provisions were interpreted more narrowly than they are today.|$|E
5|$|Section116 of the Constitution of Australia precludes the Commonwealth of Australia (i.e., {{the federal}} parliament) from making laws for {{establishing}} any religion, imposing any religious observance, or prohibiting <b>the</b> <b>free</b> <b>exercise</b> of any religion. Section116 also provides that no religious test shall be required as a qualification for any office or public trust under the Commonwealth. The {{product of a}} compromise in the pre-Federation constitutional conventions, Section116 is based on similar provisions in the United States Constitution. However, Section116 is more narrowly drafted than its US counterpart, and does not preclude the states of Australia from making such laws.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} §14 of Article IV forbade {{the incorporation}} of churches, though the Virginia Commission on Constitutional Revision, in its 1969 report, had recognized that the prohibition was probably invalid. The federal district court for the Western District of Virginia ruled in April 2002 that this provision of the Virginia Constitution was in fact unconstitutional, because it violates the federal constitutional right to <b>the</b> <b>free</b> <b>exercise</b> of religion. The court found that it is unconstitutional to deny a church the option to incorporate under state law when other groups can incorporate. An amendment striking the ban on church incorporation was approved by Virginia voters in November 2006.|$|E

40|$|Religion {{has always}} {{played a major}} role in American society, both {{politically}} and socially. Its influence on the Constitution is expressed in <b>the</b> Establishment and <b>Free</b> <b>Exercise</b> Clauses. Why is religion given special treatment by the Constitution? In this Article, Professor Jane Rutherford makes a structural argument for religious liberty. Rutherford posits that religion is treated differently not because of the content of its views, but because of the various other functions it serves, such as providing voices for outsiders and advancing non-market values. Rutherford concludes that we should return to more serious enforcement of <b>the</b> Establishment and <b>Free</b> <b>Exercise</b> Clauses in order to give a more principled basis for preserving important liberties...|$|R
