5|$|A {{major feature}} in the early {{development}} of Modern English was the codification of explicit norms for standard usage, and their dissemination through official media such as public education and state sponsored publications. In 1755 Samuel Johnson published his A Dictionary of <b>the</b> <b>English</b> <b>Language</b> which introduced a standard set of spelling conventions and usage norms. In 1828, Noah Webster published the American Dictionary of <b>the</b> <b>English</b> <b>language</b> {{in an effort to}} establish a norm for speaking and writing American English that was independent from the British standard. Within Britain, non-standard or lower class dialect features were increasingly stigmatised, leading to the quick spread of the prestige varieties among the middle classes.|$|E
