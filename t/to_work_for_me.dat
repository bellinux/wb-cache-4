2500|$|In {{the early}} 1950s, instead of {{attending}} university as he wished, Clyde Packer heeded his father's directive [...] "You go <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> ... You'll learn far {{more in the}} school of hard knocks". He joined Australian Consolidated Press (ACP) as a journalist and sub-editor of its flagship, The Daily Telegraph. For sixmonths he worked at the Daily Mail in London. In 1954 ACP launched a magazine, Weekend, with Donald Horne as editor and Packer on staff. By 1956 Packer was a director at ACP, Frank purchased the rights to Sydney TV station TCN-9 – the first Australian station to begin regular broadcasting. By 1957 Weekend employed Lillian Roxon as a journalist and later a sub-editor. When Queensland authorities wanted to ban the magazine Packer and Horne successfully fought the injunction in court.|$|E
2500|$|Maddux was {{renowned for}} {{focusing}} on the outside corner. This approach was emphasized under former Atlanta Braves pitching coach Leo Mazzone. He would begin by throwing strikes with his fastball down and away, then expand the strike zone with his changeup—sometimes obtaining borderline strike calls from umpires simply {{on the strength of}} his reputation. In complement with this strategy, Maddux popularized a tactic of throwing his two-seam fastball off the plate inside to left-handed hitters, only to have the ball break back over the inside corner for a strike. Maddux said of that pitch, [...] "That was just my normal fastball that did that. ... I always had it. The pitch really started <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> when I ... learned how to throw a cutter, it made that pitch more effective." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2005, Wales {{described}} himself {{simply as the}} founder of Wikipedia; however, according to Brian Bergstein of the Associated Press, [...] "Sanger has long been cited as a co-founder." [...] There is evidence that Sanger was called co-founder, along with Wales, as early as 2001, and he {{is referred to as}} such in early Wikipedia press releases and Wikipedia articles and in a September 2001 New York Times article for which both were interviewed. In 2006, Wales said, [...] "He used <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> [...] I don't agree with calling him a co-founder, but he likes the title"; nonetheless, before January 2004, Wales did not dispute Sanger's status as co-founder and, indeed, identified himself as [...] "co-founder" [...] as late as August 2002. In Sanger's introductory message to the Nupedia mailing list, he said that [...] "Jimmy Wales contacted me and asked me to apply as editor-in-chief of Nupedia. Apparently, Bomis, Inc. (which owns Nupedia)... who could manage this sort of long-term project, he thought I would be perfect for the job. This is indeed my dream job". Sanger said [...] "He [...] had had the idea for Nupedia since at least last fall".|$|E

[...] Hughes later confirmed that Bonham's departure was permanent, explaining that, [...] "his other commitments were {{getting in the way of}} his California Breed schedule.

40|$|In this {{creative}} project I explored carving in wax {{and casting}} in the lost wax method to create rings with characteristics from ancient Egypt, Greece, Rome, medieval Europe, {{as well as}} contemporary designs. It was important <b>to</b> my <b>work</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> understand the history and significance of symbolic rings, and how they have changed over time in design. After studying these time periods, I made numerous sketches of the rings. These designs were finalized, carved in wax, and then cast in metal. Measurements of the metal needed to cast each ring were taken and recorded. Experimenting with various tools I achieved a method that produced quality and satisfying results in the carving of the wax. Other traditional metal smith techniques were used, such as prong settings and post settings for stones in {{the completion of the}} rings.

50|$|After the {{collapse}} of his marriage, Cohl moved <b>to</b> London <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>for</b> Pick <b>Me</b> Up, a humor magazine that specialized in French artists (he left his long-standing second job as a philatelist at this time). He returned to Paris in June 1896 and married Suzanne Delpy, the daughter of one of André Gill's followers. Their son André Jean was born on November 8, 1899. By this time, Cohl had moved away from caricature, sending humorous drawings to bicycle magazines, family magazines, and children's magazines. He also wrote articles on French history, stamps, and fishing. In July 1898 he started contributing to L'Illustré National. This would be the origin of Cohl's comic strips. At the same time, Cohl's art moved from scene-setting to story-telling, and from the Gill fantoche style to Impressionism. Other interests during this period included puzzles, toys (he invented a few new ones), and drawings of figures made from wax matches. In the political arena, he submitted anti-Dreyfus illustrations to La Libre Parole Illustrée.|$|R

60|$|He {{says that}} the primary rule of {{business}} success is loyalty to your employer. That's all right--as a theory. What is the matter with loyalty to yourself?

The employer should be the worried man, and the employee the happy one. And why not? He gets the salary. My plan is to get another man <b>to</b> do the <b>work</b> <b>for</b> <b>me.</b> In that there's more repose. What I want is repose first, last, and all the time.|$|R

40|$|Some of {{the best}} moments I have had working with clients on futures {{projects}} as a consultant and a facilitator have been during scenarios workshops. By 'best', I mean those moments when a different insight emerges in the room, or {{a new way of}} interpreting the world. Even in the more everyday futures work I've never had the sense that I've been "hashing and haranguing " my way through it. Without appearing to brag, clients generally seem to feel that they have benefited. So reading Graham Molitor's piece, my first reaction was one of sadness, that such a distinguished futurist has come to find such rich work so wearisome. His article, however, raises important questions about why, in our futures practice, we use sce-narios methods at all. There are many futures techniques, after all. So what is it in scenarios meth-ods that contributes depth or breadth <b>to</b> futures <b>work?</b> <b>For</b> <b>me</b> the answer <b>to</b> that question lies {{in the way in which}} organisations relate to their external environment and understand it, and how groups learn. Futures work can be thought of as a device for 'disturbing the present', to adapt Gaston Berger's famous phrase. The question is whether scenarios do this well or not.
