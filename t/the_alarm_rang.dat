The vault also featured a guard named Ed (voiced by Joseph Kearns) who had been on post down below before, apparently, the end of the Civil War, the end of the Revolutionary War, the founding of Los Angeles, on Jack's 38th birthday, and even the beginning of humanity. In one appearance, Ed asked Benny, [...] "By the way, Mr. Benny...what's it like on the outside?" [...] Benny responded, [...] "...winter is nearly here, and the leaves are falling." [...] Ed responded, [...] "Hey, that must be exciting," [...] to which Benny replied (in a stunningly risqué joke for the period), [...] "Oh, no—people are wearing clothes now." [...] In one episode of the Benny radio show, Ed the Guard actually agreed when Jack invited him {{to take a break and}} come back to the surface world, only to discover that modern conveniences and transportation, which hadn't been around the last time he'd been to the surface, terrorized and confused him. (Poor Ed thought a crosstown bus was [...] "a red and yellow dragon".) Finally, Ed decides to return to his post fathoms below and stay there. The basement vault gag was also used in the cartoon The Mouse that Jack Built and an episode of The Lucy Show.|$|E
60|$|However, {{it became}} {{necessary}} to wash down, make {{ready for a}} new fire in the furnace of the engine, roll Ninety-four and her tender to their respective places on the floor, adjust the harness, start the clock once more (for it had been stopped by the weight set free when the first stroke of <b>the</b> <b>alarm</b> <b>rang</b> out), and replace the weight which fastened the horses in their stalls.|$|E
60|$|The royal party huddled at {{that window}} of the Louvre heard {{it at the same}} moment, and heard, as if in {{immediate}} answer, shots of arquebus and pistol, cries and screams near at hand, and then, gradually swelling from a murmur, the baying of the fierce multitude. Other bells gave tongue, until from every steeple in Paris <b>the</b> <b>alarm</b> <b>rang</b> out. The red glow from thousands of torches flushed the heavens with a rosy tint as of dawn, the air grew heavy with the smell of pitch and resin.|$|E
50|$|Klaus got a task {{from the}} phone booth. The housemates got a packet. In the packet is an <b>alarm</b> clock. <b>The</b> housemates had to pass the packet until it rings. The one, where <b>the</b> <b>alarm</b> clock <b>rings</b> gets a punishment. The housemate, who passes the packet to the one, where <b>the</b> <b>alarm</b> clock <b>rings,</b> gets a reward. But Klaus {{misunderstood}} the rules. He thought, {{that they have to}} pass the packet, when <b>the</b> <b>alarm</b> clock <b>rings.</b> And so he did.|$|R
50|$|At {{a nearby}} fire department, <b>the</b> <b>alarm</b> <b>rings.</b> <b>The</b> lead fireman, who {{is none other}} than Kiko the Kangaroo, leaps out of bed, and slides down the pole. He then heads his fellow firefighters toward the blazing building.|$|R

50|$|As {{they left}} the building, a teacher pulled the fire alarm, {{but it did not}} ring. Several minutes later, after leaving her {{students}} in the church, she returned to the school and attempted to activate the alarm again. This time, <b>the</b> <b>alarm</b> <b>rang</b> inside the school, but it was not automatically connected to the fire department. By this time, however, the students and teachers in the north wing classrooms on the second floor were essentially trapped, whether they knew about the fire or not.|$|E
5000|$|On Friday, November 9, 1962, {{shortly after}} 1pm, a fire {{began on the}} roof of the Rotunda. The fire started as workers were {{waterproofing}} the building in preparation for that year’s Winter Spectacular. <b>The</b> <b>alarm</b> <b>rang</b> at 1:12pm and, despite efforts of the entire Dearborn fire brigade, the walls of the Rotunda collapsed at 1:55pm.

After a while, someone knocks at her door {{claiming}} to be a police officer and that someone had reported seeing a prowler. Kay does not realize that le loup garou is fluent in English, and she opens the door. She then realizes that she is under attack. During the struggle, Kay throws a bottle of formalin onto the loup garou's face, which temporarily blinds him.|$|R

50|$|In {{the summer}} of 1578, a Spanish ambassador, Francisco de Eraso, arrived to Sweden. John III wished to make an {{alliance}} with Spain to prevent Denmark and Poland {{to interfere with the}} Swedish war against Russia. He also wished Spanish assistance to secure the Italian lands which he had the right to after his mother-in-law Bona Sforza. John III suggested that Cecilia, being a Catholic, could be made governor in one of the Spanish lands in Europe, preferably Luxembourg. Cecilia invited Eraso to Arboga and issued her own negotiations with him. She supported the plans of making her Spanish governor and offered her own pirate fleet to serve in the Spanish war in the Netherlands. This caused a conflict with her Protestant brother Charles, who begun to attack her fleet with his own. According to Eraso's reports, Cecilia acted as a valuable informer to Spain. When John's negotiations with Spain failed, he became suspicious of Cecilia's dealings with Eraso. John had Eraso placed in house arrest and banned him from any contact with Cecilia. In the night of 17-18 June 1579, however, Cecilia bribed her way in to Stockholm in secret and attempted to see Eraso. <b>The</b> <b>alarm</b> <b>rang,</b> and Cecilia and her retinue was captured by the guard and brought to John, which caused a great scene between the siblings. Shortly after, Cecilia returned to Germany, followed by the exiled Francisco de Eraso.|$|E

40|$|Over {{the last}} 20 years, the {{high-speed}} rail system in Europe {{has undergone a}} major development due to reduced travel times, increased train frequencies and improved quality of service. However, {{the construction of a}} new railway infrastructure requires a huge mobilization of resources, has a very long useful life and there are few alternatives of use for the investment made. Consequently, it is not a surprise that any investment of this size is always preceded by a detailed study in order to ensure the best possible result and analyze the profitability of such investment. Nevertheless, <b>the</b> <b>alarm</b> <b>rings</b> when one realizes that the appraisal of large-scale transport projects is less than reliable: the EU Cohesion Fund program revealed that one project in four costs more than 20...|$|R

50|$|O'Neill got up {{from her}} desk and began lining up her {{students}} to evacuate the building. When she {{opened the front door}} of the classroom moments later to enter the hallway, the intensity of the smoke caused O'Neill to deem it too dangerous to attempt escape down the stairs leading to Avers Avenue on the west side of the building.

Rather, the persistence of budgetary shortfalls during {{a long period of}} peace, when governments traditionally pay off debts and save for the future, should set <b>the</b> <b>alarm</b> bells <b>ringing.</b> Furthermore, projected increases in the cost of government programs, as populations age and economic growth lags, give cause for further concern. ...|$|R
