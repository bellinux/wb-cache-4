40|$|Scholars {{increasingly}} {{suggest that}} coalition governments produce more extreme foreign policies than single-party governments. Extremity is especially likely when governments include <b>radical</b> <b>parties</b> that take extreme positions {{on foreign policy}} issues and are “critical” to the government’s survival, as the <b>radical</b> <b>parties</b> push the centrist ones toward the extremes. A look at Italy’s Second Republic provides an important counterpoint to the extremity hypothesis. In three high-profile cases of military operations—Albania 1997, Kosovo 1999, and Afghanistan 2006 – 08 —Italy had a center-left government that depended on <b>radical</b> <b>parties</b> for its survival. In all cases, the <b>radical</b> <b>parties</b> opposed military operations but did not prevent the government from acting by forcing the government’s fall. Our article seeks to explain the limits of leftist <b>radical</b> <b>parties</b> in Italy’s Second Republic. We argue first that <b>radical</b> <b>parties</b> are reluctant to threaten or force government collapse as {{this can lead to}} an opposition coalition coming to office and voters’ being blamed for the outcome. Second, we claim that foreign policy has been less important to <b>radical</b> <b>parties</b> than domestic issues. Finally, we argue that <b>radical</b> <b>parties</b> have appealed to their voters through theatrical politics and have affected the implementation of military operations...|$|R
