Examples include: windowing systems, web browsers, email clients, office suites and so forth. In general, the project {{itself does not}} develop this software, only the framework to allow these programs to be installed, which {{is known as the}} Ports collection. Applications may either be compiled from source ("ports"), provided their licensing terms allow this, or downloaded as pre-compiled binaries ("packages"). The Ports collection supports <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>and</b> stable branches of FreeBSD.

5|$|Gas {{tungsten}} {{arc welding}} uses a constant current power source, meaning that <b>the</b> <b>current</b> (<b>and</b> thus the heat) remains relatively constant, {{even if the}} arc distance and voltage change. This is important because most applications of GTAW are manual or semiautomatic, requiring that an operator hold the torch. Maintaining a suitably steady arc distance is difficult if a constant voltage power source is used instead, since it can cause dramatic heat variations and make welding more difficult.|$|E

5|$|The larvae {{of other}} species of caddisfly make nets rather than cases. These are silken webs {{stretching}} between aquatic vegetation and over stones. These net-making larvae usually live in running water, different species occupying different habitats with varying water speeds.

5|$|The {{power supply}} used in SMAW has {{constant}} current output, ensuring that <b>the</b> <b>current</b> (<b>and</b> thus the heat) remains relatively constant, {{even if the}} arc distance and voltage change. This is important because most applications of SMAW are manual, requiring that an operator hold the torch. Maintaining a suitably steady arc distance is difficult if a constant voltage power source is used instead, since it can cause dramatic heat variations and make welding more difficult. However, because the current is not maintained absolutely constant, skilled welders performing complicated welds can vary the arc length to cause minor fluctuations in the current.|$|E
5|$|The {{waters in}} which Kimberella dwelt were {{occasionally}} disturbed by sandy currents, caused when sediments were whipped up by storms or meltwater discharge, and washed over the creatures.

Some organisms survived <b>the</b> <b>current,</b> <b>and</b> attempted to burrow {{out of the sand}} that had been deposited above them; some unsuccessful attempts can be seen where juveniles were fossilised {{at the end of a}} burrow a few centimetres long.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The sensorless {{drive of}} a {{brushless}} motor involves the position {{estimation of the}} rotor, without Hall sensors to generate the switching signal. For this reason we need to detect the commutation points. We are studied <b>the</b> <b>currents</b> <b>and</b> phase-to-phase voltages for a small brushless motor. <b>The</b> <b>currents</b> are sensed with current sensors (LEM). A virtual instrument developed in Lab View visualisates <b>the</b> <b>currents</b> <b>and</b> voltages and determinate the commutation points. This is connected to an other VI witch generate the switching signal. In our case the small BLDC is drive in frequency control mode, that means <b>the</b> <b>current</b> impulse has constant Ton/T ratio and variable frequency. The mean value of <b>the</b> <b>current</b> depends on frequency. The developed VIs are able to drive the small BLCD motor...|$|R
5|$|When {{the great}} bell rings out every full hour, {{struck by a}} large clockwork-operated hammer, passers-by see a gilded figure in full harness moving its arm to strike it. The larger-than-life figure of bearded Chronos, the Greek {{personification}} of time, is traditionally nicknamed Hans von Thann by the Bernese. The wooden bell-striker, which has been replaced several times, has been a fixture of the Zytglogge since the renewal of the astronomical clock in 1530, whose clockwork also controls the figure's motions. The original wooden Chronos might have been created by master craftsman Albrecht von Nürnberg, while <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>and</b> most recent Hans is a 1930 reconstruction of a Baroque original. The bell-striker has been gilded, just like the bells, since 1770.|$|E

5|$|In 1872, at {{the urging}} of many of his friends, {{including}} Darwin, Philip Sclater, and Alfred Newton, Wallace began research for a general review of the geographic distribution of animals. He was unable to make much progress initially, in part because classification systems for many types of animals were in flux at the time. He resumed the work in earnest in 1874 after the publication of a number of new works on classification. Extending the system developed by Sclater for birds—which divided the earth into six separate geographic regions for describing species distribution—to cover mammals, reptiles and insects as well, Wallace created the basis for the zoogeographic regions still in use today. He discussed all of the factors then known to influence <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>and</b> past geographic distribution of animals within each geographical region. These included the effects of the appearance and disappearance of land bridges (such as the one currently connecting North America and South America) and the effects of periods of increased glaciation. He provided maps that displayed factors, such as elevation of mountains, depths of oceans, and the character of regional vegetation, that affected the distribution of animals. He also summarised all the known families and genera of the higher animals and listed their known geographic distributions. The text was organised so that it would be easy for a traveller to learn what animals could be found in a particular location. The resulting two-volume work, The Geographical Distribution of Animals, was published in 1876 and would serve as the definitive text on zoogeography for the next 80 years.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} years of the Meiji era, the main Nanbu line was ennobled with the title of count (hakushaku) in the new peerage system. The Nanbu of Hachinohe and Shichinohe were also ennobled with the title of viscount (shishaku). Count Toshinaga Nanbu, the 42nd {{generation}} Nanbu clan chieftain, was an officer of the Imperial Japanese Army, he died in battle during the Russo-Japanese War. He was succeeded by his brother Nanbu Toshiatsu; Toshiatsu was a proponent of the arts and studied painting under Kuroda Seiki. As Toshiatsu's presumptive heir Toshisada died at age 18, Toshiatsu adopted Toshihide Ichijō, his son-in-law, as his heir. Toshihide was the son of Duke Ichijō Saneteru, who was a former court noble. Upon adoption, Toshihide assumed the Nanbu name, and after Toshiatsu's death, became 44th generation Nanbu clan chieftain. His wife was Mizuko Nanbu, a prominent figure in the Girl Scouts of Japan. After Toshihide's death in 1980, his son Toshiaki became 45th clan chieftain. From 2004 through 2009, Toshaiki served as the chief priest of Yasukuni Shrine. <b>The</b> <b>current</b> <b>and</b> 46th clan chieftain is Toshifumi Nanbu, born in 1970.|$|E
5|$|Members of <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>and</b> {{previous}} Worldcon {{are eligible}} to nominate new writers for the Campbell Award under the same procedures as the Hugo Awards.

Voting on the ballot of five nominations is performed roughly in April through July, subject to change depending on when that year's Worldcon is held. Writers become eligible once they have a work published anywhere in the world which was sold for more than a nominal amount. While final decisions on eligibility are decided by the WSFS, the given criteria for an author to be eligible are specifically defined as someone who has had a written work in a publication which had more than 10,000 readers and which paid the writer at least 3 cents per word and a total of at least 50 US dollars.|$|E
