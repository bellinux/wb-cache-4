Typically, a forward is dominant throwing with one hand or <b>the</b> <b>other,</b> and will primarily play {{on that side of}} the floor. Some players, known as creasemen, do not focus on one side or <b>the</b> <b>other.</b> These players instead focus their offensive attention near the crease area in front of the goaltender.|$|E

In such proceedings, the fact that for seven years or more <b>the</b> <b>other</b> party to the marriage has been continually absent from the applicant, and the applicant has {{no reason to believe that}} <b>the</b> <b>other</b> party has been living within that time, is evidence that the missing person is dead until the contrary is proved.|$|E

40|$|The {{author of}} this thesis applies the {{theoretical}} perspectives of postcolonialism and black feminism {{to be able to}} see how the picture of <b>the</b> <b>others</b> has been created. Through the creation of <b>the</b> <b>others,</b> <b>the</b> colonising, and developed, world have been able to have a significant influence on the developing world, by grouping the people of the developing world together into the oppressed group of <b>the</b> <b>others.</b> By examining investigation reports of how the situations are at sweatshops, and by examining how the corporations have formulated their Codes of Conduct, as a part of their work with CSR, the author have used discourse analysis to extract the vagueness in the Codes of Conduct. As <b>the</b> <b>others</b> are considered as backwards and primitive, the women who are put into the group of <b>the</b> <b>others</b> are considered even more so, opening for the use of women as cheap labour, and who will not protest when their work conditions are bad. This belief have also created a picture of the developed world as the more civilised, who take advantage of the peril of <b>the</b> <b>others,</b> and justify it with that <b>the</b> <b>others</b> are in need of developed world influence...|$|R
