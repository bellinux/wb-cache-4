500|$|... "Fragments" [...] {{was written}} {{to be in}} real time format.

[...] The idea behind [...] "Next Tuesday" [...] came when Kindler and Wood noticed a rescue helicopter that was available for rent, prompting the two {{to come up with}} a [...] "helicopter story." [...] The episode also introduces a next level in Will and Magnus' friendship; arguments, which would create a [...] "far more realistic thread of tension" [...] between the two characters who [...] "obviously love each other," [...] and [...] "obviously get along," [...] which Kindler felt made a [...] "cool character layer." [...] This was also based on the producers themselves, who despite being good friends, often argue while producing the series.|$|E

500|$|While {{the music}} of Henry Cow was highly orchestrated and structured, Frith also began to {{experiment}} with unstructured music, using prepared instruments and chance composition. In June 1974, {{after the release of}} Henry Cow's second album, Virgin Records (Henry Cow's record label) commissioned a solo record from Frith. They were impressed with his musical ability and gave him free rein to record whatever he wanted. In a 2001 radio interview, Frith said he used the opportunity as a challenge: [...] "I said to myself ... in two weeks time I'm going to go into the studio and I have no idea what I'm going to do and I'm going <b>to</b> <b>kind</b> of reinvent the instrument for myself." [...] Frith spent four days in July 1974 recording at the Kaleidophon Studios in London, and the resulting experimentation and the process of galvanisation and pressure led to the [...] "radical approach to the guitar" [...] on the album. In October 1974, Virgin released the album as Guitar Solos on their budget label, Caroline Records.|$|E
500|$|The {{band has}} said the idea of wearing masks stemmed from a clown mask that Crahan took to rehearsals when the band first started. Crahan later became known for his clown masks, {{adopting}} the pseudonym [...] "Shawn the Clown". The concept developed; by late 1997, the band decided every band member would wear a unique mask and matching jumpsuit. Taylor said in 2002, [...] "it's our way of becoming more intimate with the music. It's a {{way for us to}} become unconscious of who we are and what we do outside of music. It's a way for us <b>to</b> <b>kind</b> of crawl inside it and be able to use it." [...] The concept of wearing matching jumpsuits {{has been described as a}} response to commercialism in the music industry and led to the idea of assigning the band members numerical aliases. According to Taylor, [...] "Originally, we were just going to wear the jumpsuits...we figured we might as well take that further and number ourselves...We were basically saying, 'Hey, we're a product!'".|$|E

500|$|Fantasy Black Channels track listing and UK CD {{release date}} of 11 August 2008 were {{confirmed}} on 11 June. Faley has claimed that [...] "the album {{fell into place}} itself, like the songs basically told us where {{they wanted to go}} on the album". Late of the Pier picked the record's name at random after first contemplating using Peggy Patch and Her Sequenced Dress. The cover art was designed by a friend of the band members from Brighton, Jon Bergman. A final EP containing material already released in 2007 and 2008, Echoclistel Lambietroy, was released in July 2008 as part of the marketing campaign for the forthcoming album. Potter has summed the record's conception by concluding, [...] "I think in the three years to build up to the album, we never actually thought of a track list, and we never really kind of considered the fact that it should sound like an album. I think we recorded all the songs and then they were there and it was like, 'Oh, we have <b>to</b> <b>kind</b> of stitch this together and make it sound like one piece.'" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{special effects}} were simple and {{limited by the}} budget. The {{on-screen}} blood was real in some cases, such as the scene in which Leatherface feeds [...] "Grandpa". The crew had difficulty getting the stage blood {{to come out of}} its tube, so instead Burns's index finger was cut with a razor. Burns's costume was so drenched with stage blood that it was [...] "virtually solid" [...] by the last day of shooting. The scene in which Leatherface decapitates Kirk with a chainsaw worried actor William Vail (Kirk). After telling Vail to stay still lest he really be killed, Hansen brought the running chainsaw to within [...] of Vail's face. A real hammer was used for the climactic scene at the end, with some takes also featuring a mock-up. However, the actor playing Grandpa was aiming for the floor rather than his victim's head. Still, the shoot was somewhat dangerous, with Hooper noting at the wrap party that all cast members had obtained some level of injury. He stated that [...] "everyone hated me {{by the end of the}} production" [...] and that [...] "it just took years for them <b>to</b> <b>kind</b> of cool off." ...|$|E

The lyrics to the song {{have been described as}} being from the perspective of God, although the members of Third Day have described them differently; David Carr, the drummer for Third Day, described the lyrics as [...] "crying out to God and calling out his name", while Mac Powell described them as [...] "kind of a prayer. It's about when people are going through hard times and going through struggles that we've gotta call out to someone, and for us as people of faith it's calling out to God and hearing his voice... and for someone else it could be a friend or a family member that you've gotta reach out <b>to</b> <b>kind</b> of help share those burdens you go through". Carr also described the drum part on [...] "Call My Name" [...] as [...] "basic", and the song itself has been described as [...] "pop rock", [...] "AC-friendly", and [...] "pop".|$|E
