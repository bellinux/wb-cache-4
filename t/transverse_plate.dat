40|$|ObjectivesSternal {{instability}} after {{cardiac surgery}} occurs infrequently {{but can be}} challenging to manage. The most common treatment of mechanical sternal instability is operative rewiring. Transverse rib-to-rib stabilization with titanium plates designed for sternal fixation is a recent option. We evaluated the clinical utility of the <b>transverse</b> <b>plating</b> system in a cardiothoracic practice. MethodsWe retrospectively reviewed our experience with <b>transverse</b> sternal <b>plating</b> using the Synthes titanium sternal plate system (Synthes CMF, Paoli, Pa) from June 2004 to June 2007. ResultsThere were 15 sternal reconstruction procedures performed in 14 patients using the <b>transverse</b> sternal <b>plates.</b> One patient required reoperation for sternal plate fracture. Indications for sternal plating were chronic sternal dehiscence in 9 procedures, acute sternal dehiscence in 3 procedures, previous mediastinitis and sternectomy in 2 procedures, and sternal plate fracture in 1 procedure. The initial cardiac operation was isolated coronary artery bypass in all patients. The mean age was 59 years (range, 51 – 68 years), all patients were men, 12 patients had a body mass index of greater than 30 kg/m 2 (range, 22 – 40 kg/m 2), 9 patients were diabetic, 8 patients were active smokers, and 7 patients had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The mean follow-up period was 15. 5 months (range, 3 – 33 months). All patients achieved sternal stability with minimal postoperative pain. Complications included infection requiring explantation in 1 patient, plate fracture in 1 patient, and seroma formation in 1 patient. ConclusionThe <b>transverse</b> sternal <b>plating</b> system successfully achieved stability in all cases and is valuable in complex sternal reconstructions.

40|$|During {{fabrication}} of multi-piece steel bridge assemblies, markings are often {{made on the}} steel surface to identify/track individual pieces or to provide reference for fabrication layout or later erection. Automated marking methods such as computer numerically controlled (CNC) pin-dot marking offer fabrication efficiencies; however, for marked steel sections subjected to frequent or repeated loading (i. e. bridge girders) many code specifications require experimental testing to verify any marking effects on fatigue capacity. In this study, the effects of automated pin-dot markings on the fatigue capacity of A 709 -Gr 50 bridge steel are experimentally investigated from 13 specimens considering 2 marking frequencies (corresponding to marking speeds of 50 in. /min and 10 in. /min), 2 applied stress ranges (35 ksi and 45 ksi), and 2 material orientations (both longitudinal and <b>transverse</b> <b>plate</b> rolling directions).

Cruciform specimens consisting of a single tension pull <b>plate</b> with <b>transverse</b> fillet-welded <b>plates</b> attached at midspan are tested in this study.

Accurate stress intensity factor values are difficult to obtain because of the small, nonuniform crack growth conditions at the weld toe. Finite-element method analysis for welded geometries capturing stress fields at the weld toe of stiffener details is performed, and numerical results are incorporated into an existing analytical stress intensity factor framework.

40|$|The current {{view is that}} {{migrating}} {{bars are}} the result of morphodynamic instability in straight or mildly-sinuous alluvial channels and are therefore an inevitable feature of alluvial river beds. Steady bars, instead, require some external forcing or specific morphodynamic conditions to develop. Yet, recent numerical tests showed that steady bars may develop as a result of spontaneous morphodynamic instability, just like migrating bars, without meeting the specific conditions. We investigated this possibility in the laboratory, following the temporal evolution of alternate bars in a straight flume with mobile bed. The experiment was run with a constant discharge for about 10 weeks. Initially, the bed topography was dominated by the presence of fast growing migrating bars. After three weeks, however, slowly growing, larger, steady bars emerged. These bars had the same wavelength as the ones that formed in another experimental test in which the flow was perturbed by the presence of a <b>transverse</b> <b>plate.</b> The experiment confirms the recent numerical results. Considering that the presence of steady alternate bars is a prerequisite for initiation of meandering, this is now shown to be an inherent feature of alluvial rivers.

Pathognomonic lesions include well-defined cysts dispersed through the lung tissue (maximum diameter 40 mm) containing adult and larval parasites in a dense matrix. Transmission involves a molluscan intermediate host, as indicated by experimental infections in the slug Deroceras reticulatum. The parasite is apparently restricted in its geographic distribution and has been found only in a population of muskoxen northwest of Coppermine, N. W. T. This may be indicative of a relictual host-parasite assemblage that has existed since the Pleistocene.

This energy is evaluated in a structural volume having a radius equal to 0. 28 mm or 0. 12 mm for welded joints made of structural steel or aluminium, respectively.

40|$|AbstractWhile {{the recent}} high demand for high rising {{buildings}} {{has led to}} the development of high-performance and highstrength steels, the requirements for structural-performance steel for building have been raised as engineers recognize the potential damage that an earthquake can wreak on a tall building. Many studies on high-strength steels have explored such need, but in case of hollow section, there are not enough experimental data. Appropriate design equations in CHS are needed because the design equations limit the maximum yield strength and yield ratio up to 360 MPa and 80 % in AISC and Canadian codes, and the design code of KBC 2009. This study was carried out the experiment test on strength of tube-gusset connection. Connections were formed by CHS chord with <b>transverse</b> <b>plate</b> (WH type) and longitudinal plate (LH type), and lateral force was applied on it.

As the results of FEA using ABAQUS, analytical values almost reached the same results. This study analyzed tubegusset connection and compared experimental values with analytical values for evaluating the applicability of current design equations.

40|$|In this thesis, two {{material}} {{models were}} studied, and the simulation results {{were compared to}} experimental data. The experiments were material tests (uniaxial tension and compression) and component tests (<b>transverse</b> <b>plate</b> deformation) of HDPE and PVC. The material models were the simple elasto-plasticmaterial model MAT 24 and the new constitutive material model intended for thermoplastics developed atNTNU, both implemented in the finite element code LS-DYNA. The main intention was to study the differences between these models, and investigate {{the possibility of using}} the simple MAT 24 instead of morecomplex and specialized material models, like the NTNU material model, without sacrificing too much accuracy. Using MAT 24 in the simulations performed in this thesis produces good results, compared to both theexperiments and the NTNU material model. The behavior is easily controllable, and the parameters are easilyidentified. Both MAT 24 and the NTNU material model has their advantages and disadvantages, but whenincluding time and user-control as important factors in an industrial perspective, the MAT 24 material model stands out as a viable option for simulations of thermoplastic components. However, understanding the deformation field in the component is vital for obtaining satisfactory results. The most important features of the mechanical behaviour of thermoplastics is the large strain rate sensitivity of yield stress, the yield stress differences in tension and compression, and the plastic dilatation. MAT 24 is by definition not able to capture the last two features, but the strain rate sensitivity of increasing yield stress with increasing strain rate was found to be captured well by an additive method through the VP option. The NTNU material model, however, captures all mentioned features, but predicts dilatation also in compression. </p...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Median {{sternotomy}} {{infection and}} bony nonunion are two commonly described complications which occur in 0. 4 - 5. 1 % of cardiac procedures. Although relatively infrequent, these complications {{can lead to}} significant morbidity and mortality. The aim of this retrospective study is to evaluate the initial experience of a <b>transverse</b> <b>plate</b> fixation system following wound complications associated with sternal dehiscence with or without infection following cardiac surgery. Methods A retrospective chart review of 40 consecutive patients who required sternal wound reconstruction post sternotomy was performed. Soft tissue debridement with removal of all compromised tissue was performed. Sternal debridement was carried using ronguers to healthy bleeding bone. All patients underwent sternal fixation using three rib plates combined with a single manubrial plate (Titanium Sternal Fixation System ®, Synthes). Incisions were closed in a layered fashion with the pectoral muscles being advanced to the midline. Data were expressed as mean ± SD, Median (range) or number (%). Statistical analyses were made by using Excel 2003 for Windows (Microsoft, Redmond, WA, USA). Results There were 40 consecutive patients, 31 males and 9 females. Twenty two patients (55 %) were diagnosed with sternal dehiscence alone and 18 patients (45 %) with associated wound discharge. Thirty eight patients went on to heal their wounds. Two patients developed recurrent wound infection and required VAC therapy. Both were immunocompromised. Median post-op ICU stay was one day with the median hospital stay of 18 days after plating.

40|$|Migrating {{alternate}} bars form in alluvial channels as {{a result}} of morphodynamic instability. Extensive literature can be found on their origin and short-term development, but their long-term evolution has been poorly studied so far. In particular, {{it is not clear whether}} they eventually reach an equilibrium shape, since short-term experiments show that they may tend to elongate with time. We studied the long-term evolution of alternate bars by performing two independent long-duration laboratory experiments. In a straight flume, we carried out two tests, characterized by the same hydrodynamic conditions. In the first test (duration 3 weeks), a <b>transverse</b> <b>plate</b> created a permanent disturbance at the upstream boundary, forcing the formation of steady bars. In this case, both migrating and steady bars formed, but steady bars rapidly dominated the scene. In the second test (duration 10 weeks), the incoming flow was uniform, without any external disturbance. Migrating bars initially dominated the bed topography, but steady bars slowly developed from upstream, locally suppressing migrating bars. In both tests, migrating bars showed a periodic behavior, characterized by vanishing and reappearing at intervals of one or more weeks. Recurrent bar vanishing occurred also in another long-term experiment carried out in an annular flume, this time at intervals of 6 - 8 days. Migrating bar vanishing appears related to progressive steepening of the bar fronts. Without any external forcing, steady bar development seems to be caused by the presence of migrating bars, which may operate as forcing factors. Steady alternate bars are found to act similarly to point bars in sinuous channels, in their ability to locally suppress migrating bars. In conclusion, in the performed experiments migrating bars appear as a transitional phenomenon of alluvial channels having a cyclic character, whereas the bed topography is eventually dominated by steady bars.
