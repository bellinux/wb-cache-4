5|$|Cockatoos {{maintain}} their plumage with frequent preening throughout the day. They remove dirt {{and oil and}} realign feather barbs by nibbling their feathers. They also preen other birds' feathers that are otherwise hard to get at. Cockatoos produce preen-oil from a gland on <b>their</b> <b>lower</b> back and apply it by wiping their plumage with their heads or already oiled feathers. Powder-down is produced by specialised feathers in the lumbar region and distributed by the preening cockatoo all over the plumage.|$|E
5|$|Flow-dominated eruptions are {{long-lived}} {{events that}} build up extensive, compound lava flows. The extent of these flows makes them a major terrain type on Io. In {{this style of}} eruption, magma emerges onto the surface from vents {{on the floor of}} paterae, vents surrounding paterae, or from fissures on the plains, producing inflated, compound lava flows similar to those seen at Kīlauea in Hawaii. Images from the Galileo spacecraft revealed that many of Io's major flows, like those at Prometheus and Amirani, are produced by the build-up of small breakouts of lava on top of older flows. Flow-dominated eruptions differ from explosion-dominated eruptions by their longevity and <b>their</b> <b>lower</b> energy output per unit of time. Lava erupts at a generally steady rate, and flow-dominated eruptions can last for years or decades.|$|E
5|$|On February 29, 2000, Boeing {{launched}} its next-generation twinjet program, initially called 777-X, and began issuing offers to airlines. Development was slowed by an industry downturn {{during the early}} 2000s. The first model {{to emerge from the}} program, the 777-300ER, was launched with an order for ten aircraft from Air France, along with additional commitments. On February 24, 2003, the -300ER made its first flight, and the FAA and EASA (European Aviation Safety Agency, successor to the JAA) certified the model on March 16, 2004. The first delivery to Air France took place on April 29, 2004. The -300ER, which combined the -300's added capacity with the -200ER's range, became the top-selling 777 variant in the late 2000s, benefitting as airlines replaced comparable four-engine models with twinjets for <b>their</b> <b>lower</b> operating costs.|$|E

5|$|Special {{behavioral}} {{features of}} the dromedary include snapping at others without biting them and showing displeasure by stamping their feet. They are generally non-aggressive, {{with the exception of}} rutting males. They appear to remember their homes; females in particular remember the places they first gave birth or suckled their offspring. Males become aggressive in the mating season, and sometimes wrestle. A 1980 study showed androgen levels in males influences their behaviour. Between January and April when these levels are high during the rut, they become difficult to manage, blow out the palate from the mouth, vocalise and throw urine over their backs. Camels scratch parts of their bodies with their legs or with <b>their</b> <b>lower</b> incisors. They may also rub against tree bark and roll in sand.|$|E
5|$|Thallium is {{the first}} element in group 13 where the {{reduction}} of the +3 oxidation state to the +1 oxidation state is spontaneous under standard conditions. Since bond energies decrease down the group, by thallium, the energy released in forming two additional bonds and attaining the +3 state is not always enough to outweigh the energy needed to involve the 6s-electrons. Accordingly, thallium(I) oxide and hydroxide are more basic and thallium(III) oxide and hydroxide are more acidic, showing that thallium conforms to the general rule of elements being more electropositive in <b>their</b> <b>lower</b> oxidation states.|$|E

The need to save weight meant that compromises were made in {{some aspects of the}} design. The boiler size was constrained by the SECR’s axle-loading restrictions, with the result that the design’s full steaming potential was not realised.

5|$|The {{suborder}} Cryptobranchoidea {{contains the}} primitive salamanders. A number of fossil cryptobranchids have been found, {{but there are}} only three living species, the Chinese giant salamander (Andrias davidianus), the Japanese giant salamander (Andrias japonicus) and the hellbender (Cryptobranchus alleganiensis) from North America. These large amphibians retain several larval characteristics in their adult state; gills slits are present and the eyes are unlidded. A unique feature is their ability to feed by suction, depressing either the left side of <b>their</b> <b>lower</b> jaw or the right. The males excavate nests, persuade females to lay their egg strings inside them, and guard them. As well as breathing with lungs, they respire through the many folds in their thin skin, which has capillaries close to the surface.|$|E
5|$|The {{teeth of}} V.salvadorii do not {{resemble}} those of other monitor species, which are typically blunt, peglike, and face slightly rearward.

In the wild, V. salvadorii is the top predator in New Guinea, feeding on birds, eggs, small mammals, and carrion. Natives have reported that it can take down pigs, deer, and hunting dogs, and hauls its prey into the canopy to consume it. Captive specimens {{have been known to}} eat fish, frogs, rodents, chickens, and dog food.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Approximately 50 % of hypertensives {{can learn}} to <b>lower</b> <b>their</b> blood {{pressure}} (BP), as measured in the clinic, using biofeedback training. Such reports do not demonstrate whether the treatment effects generalize outside the clinic. The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine the relationship between those who <b>lowered</b> <b>their</b> clinic BP and those who <b>lowered</b> <b>their</b> ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) after biofeedback-assisted relaxation training. Methods: Fifty-four adults (17 male and 37 female; 36 white, 15 black, and 3 other races) with hypertension were studied. Biofeedback-assisted relaxation training was provided using thermal, electromyography (EMG), and respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) biofeedback using Procomp+ / Multitrace biofeedback system (STENS Corp, Oakland, CA), coupled with deep breathing, autogenics, and progressive muscle relaxation. ABP was measured over 24 hours using an ambulatory BP monitor (Spacelabs Medical, Inc, Redmond, WA). Clinic BP was measured using the same instrument in the manual mode. Improvement was defined as being able to decrease BP 5 mm Hg or more. Results: For the entire sample (n= 54), 50 %, 44 %, and 39 % reduced their clinic SBP, DBP and MAP, respectively; 33 %, 29 % and 27 % reduced their daytime ambulatory SBP, DBP and MAP respectively. For unmedicated subjects (n= 12), 67 %, 50 %, and 42 % reduced their clinic SBP, DBP and MAP, respectively; 50 %, 33 % and 33 % reduced their daytime ambulatory SBP, DBP and MAP, respectively. Forty-four percent of those who <b>lowered</b> <b>their</b> clinic SBP, also <b>lowered</b> <b>their</b> ambulatory SBP; 45 % of those who <b>lowered</b> <b>their</b> clinic DBP, also <b>lowered</b> <b>their</b> ambulatory DBP; 42 % of those who <b>lowered</b> <b>their</b> clinic MAP, also <b>lowered</b> <b>their</b> ambulatory MAP. Discussion: Approximately 50 % of hypertensives <b>lowered</b> <b>their</b> clinic BP using biofeedback- assisted relaxation training. This BP lowering effect generalized to an ambulatory setting for less than half of the participants...|$|R

Although it is clear that equites cohortales did not match equites alares (ala cavalrymen) in quality (hence <b>their</b> <b>lower</b> pay), the evidence is that they fought as cavalry {{in the same way as}} the alares and often alongside them.

The plan was for two obsolete cruisers— and —to be expended in blocking the canal which emptied at Ostend. These ships would be stripped to essential fittings and <b>their</b> <b>lower</b> holds and ballast filled with rubble and concrete.

5|$|Unlike {{many other}} dinosaurs, psittacosaurs had akinetic skulls: {{that is to}} say, {{the upper and lower}} jaws each behaved as a single unit, without {{internal}} joints. The only joint was the jaw joint itself, and psittacosaurs could slide <b>their</b> <b>lower</b> jaws forward and backward on the joint, permitting a shearing action. Unlike most ceratopsians, their beaks did not form curved tips, but were instead rounded and flattened. If the jaws were aligned, the beaks could be used to crop objects, but if the lower jaw was retracted so that the lower beak was inside the upper beak, the jaws may have served a nutcracking function. A nut- or seed-rich diet would also match well with the gastroliths often seen in well-preserved psittacosaur skeletons.|$|E
5|$|A {{detailed}} re-assessment of the taphonomy by palaeontologist Martin Sander of the University of Bonn, Germany, {{found that}} the mud-miring hypothesis first suggested by Fraas is true: animals above a certain body weight sank into the mud, which was further liquefied by their attempts to free themselves. Sander's scenario, similar to that proposed for the famous Rancho La Brea Tar Pits, {{is the only one}} explaining all taphonomic data. The degree of completeness of the carcasses was not influenced by transport, which is obvious from the lack of indications for transport before burial, but rather by how much the dead animals were scavenged. Juveniles of Plateosaurus and other taxa of herbivores were too light to sink into the mud or managed to extract themselves, and were thus not preserved. Similarly, scavenging theropods were not trapped due to <b>their</b> <b>lower</b> body weights, combined with proportionally larger feet. There is no indication of herding, or of catastrophic burial of such a herd, or catastrophic accumulation of animals that previously died isolated elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with all}} {{elements}} having atomic weights {{higher than that}} of iron, it is only naturally formed in supernovae. Primordial thorium and uranium are only produced in the r-process (rapid neutron capture), because the s-process (slow neutron capture) is too slow and cannot pass the gap of instability after bismuth. Besides the two extant primordial uranium isotopes, 235U and 238U, the r-process also produced significant quantities of 236U, which has a shorter half-life and has long since decayed completely to 232Th, which was itself enriched by the decay of 244Pu, accounting for the observed higher-than-expected abundance of thorium and lower-than-expected abundance of uranium. While the natural abundance of uranium has been supplemented by the decay of extinct 242Pu (half-life 0.375millionyears) and 247Cm (half-life 16millionyears), producing 238U and 235U respectively, this occurred to an almost negligible extent due to the shorter half-lives of these parents and <b>their</b> <b>lower</b> production than 236U and 244Pu, the parents of thorium: the 247Cm:235U ratio at the formation of the Solar System was (7.0 ± 1.6) × 10−5.|$|E
