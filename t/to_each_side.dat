5|$|The main {{structure}} of the station and the shops <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>side</b> was designed {{with the intention of}} taking upward development on its roof, though this did not come until around 1960 when three storeys of office building were added.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{both sides}} {{unleashed}} diplomatic offensives. The Knights dispatched {{letters to the}} monarchs of Europe, preaching their usual crusade against the heathens; Władysław countered with his own letters to the monarchs, accusing the Order of planning to conquer the whole world. Such appeals successfully recruited many foreign knights <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>side.</b> Wenceslas IV of Bohemia signed a defensive treaty with the Poles against the Teutonic Order; his brother, Sigismund of Luxembourg, allied himself with the Order and declared war against Poland on 12 July, though his Hungarian vassals refused his call to arms.|$|E
5|$|Rossia {{returned}} to Kronstadt, arriving on 8 April 1906, {{where she was}} given a lengthy refit that was finished in 1909. Her engines and boilers were reconditioned, her mainmast was removed and she received additional six-inch guns. Six more guns in lightly armored casemates were added on the upper deck, positioned on each side in the intervals between the main-deck six-inch guns. In addition the bow gun {{was moved to the}} upper deck to allow it to fire <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>side.</b> This increased the ship's broadside by four guns.|$|E
50|$|When Macmillan-Bloedel workers {{arrived at}} Meares Island in 1984, they {{encountered}} a bigger blockade that included {{members of the}} Nuu-chah-nulth tribe, local environmental groups, and other supporters of their cause. Throughout the 1980 aAnimosity continued between these groups due <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>side's</b> respective injunctions, which were in contradiction with one another {{over the use of}} the land.|$|R

5|$|The amnesty {{was passed}} by the Chamber of Deputies by a vote of 125–23. Under the threat of having a veto overridden, Fonseca signed the amnesty. The rebels {{returned}} on 26 November after a short period of consternation—additional demands, such as an increase in salary, had yet to be proposed in Congress, much less passed—with their ships in formation, Minas Geraes leading São Paulo, with Bahia and Deodoro <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>side.</b> By 7pm, the mutineers officially accepted the amnesty provisions.|$|E
5|$|The {{upper level}} {{contains}} {{a mix of}} seating options. At one end are eight tables, four <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>side,</b> each seating four passengers. In the center is a lounge area with a wet bar and several groups of seats. The stairs to the lower level are located here as well. At the other end are swivel chairs. The lower level contains a bathroom, additional tables, and a snack bar. As built, the lounges had seating for 73. The cars were built with an electric piano in the lower level, which has since been removed.|$|E
5|$|This {{same general}} {{area of the}} {{property}} was used also for the drying of the varnished fabric. This consisted of twenty foot high clothes line-type poles that were 100 feet apart and further protected by wind-break fences of canvas. Between the poles were strung wires for laying the wet varnished fabric onto for drying. After drying the fabric was then rewound onto rollers and varnished {{over and over again}} several more times <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>side</b> and thoroughly dried each time. Each application of new varnish added a thin layer.|$|E

5|$|Wood Lane {{station was}} {{modified}} and extended {{to accommodate the}} northward extension tracks linking to the E The existing platforms on the loop were retained, continuing {{to be used by}} trains that were turning back to central London, and two new platforms for trains running to or from Ealing were constructed at a lower level on the new tracks, which connected <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>side</b> of the loop. Ealing Broadway station was modified to provide additional platforms for CLR use between the existing but separate sets of platforms used by the GWR and the DR.|$|E
5|$|The interclavicle is a {{large plate}} with a smooth upper surface and a {{prominent}} groove on the bottom surface. It also bears a small, pointed projection at its back end. The scapulae have prominent shelves on each side (diagnostic of leptocleidids and polycotylids, but not strongly differentiated in elasmosaurids), and their glenoids are clearly concave, with roughened attachments for cartilage. The two coracoids curve outwards {{in the middle and}} contact at their ends, forming a hole in the middle, although the exact morphology of this hole is uncertain. The regions where the coracoids contact is vaulted and thickened to form a weak, ridge-like projection, comparable to but probably convergently acquired from elasmosaurids. The pubes form a somewhat rectangular dish, with a convex front edge and concave outer edge, while the ischia are flat, triangular, and plate-like. The edges of the pubes where they meet the ischia curve inwards from the midline <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>side.</b> The corresponding edges of the ischia are similarly-shaped, with the curved edges of the bones collectively forming two rounded fenestrae that are connected in the center by a small rhombus-shaped opening, as also seen in Futabasaurus. The ilia are rod-shaped and bent, with blunt projections halfway along their outer rims; at the top end, they are flattened into a fan-like shape.|$|E
5|$|The {{main feature}} {{of the game is}} focused on a map of Europe and western Russia, which {{displays}} accurate terrain such as mountain ranges, major cities, borders and all military forces belonging <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>side.</b> The game also features an arcade sequence which involves shooting down enemy units in order to secure combat bonuses; this gameplay mode, however, can be ignored by changing the game's settings. If the arcade sequences are turned on, the player will be notified to choose a battle on the map. Depending on the area chosen, an illustration of a battle commencing in countryside or a city is presented with various forms of military equipment including aeroplanes, helicopters and tanks. The player must shoot down and destroy enemy units using their cursor, in similar style to Missile Command. The outcome of the arcade sequence will affect the game; performing poorly will result in severe losses throughout that round.|$|E
25|$|The {{catchment}} {{areas of the}} eight existing teams were changed {{to account for the}} two new teams. Catchment areas are nominated areas <b>to</b> help <b>each</b> <b>side</b> select their local players. Each team must select four players from their area.|$|R

5|$|The French {{offensive}} at Stonne was {{of vital}} importance. The town remained a base situated on high ground overlooking Sedan. The French {{could use it}} as a base from which to launch long-term attacks on Sedan. On 15 May, the battle began. The French committed the 3d Company, 49th Tank Battalion; 1st Company, 45th Tank Battalion; and the 2d Company, 4th Tank Battalion; the 1st Battalion, 67th Infantry Regiment; and the 1st Company, 51st Infantry Regiment. The French infantry were slow in their advance, which meant the armour outran them. Alone, the tanks tried to attack and failed. At this time, Stonne was held only by the 1st Battalion Großdeutschland supported by only nine of the Regiments 12 anti-tank artillery guns. As the French pressed forward, the weak German defence struggled to hold its ground. However, when one German platoon managed to knock out three French Char B1s the French tank crews panicked, and drove away to the south. It was a psychological victory for the Germans which encouraged their continued defence of the position. In the next attacks, they held their positions and fought. The town would fall <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>side</b> over the next 48 hours, as offensive followed counter-attack. The 10th Panzer sent its 1st Battalion, 69th Infantry Regiment to support the hard-pressed Großdeutschland. The Germans retook the town at 17:00 on 17 May, for the fourth time in nine hours.|$|E

25|$|Points {{are awarded}} as follows: 10 points for a win, 5 points <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>side</b> for a tie (scores level), 0 points for a loss, 5 points <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>side</b> for {{abandonment}} (no play), and 5 points <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>side</b> for an abandonment (with play, no win achieved). For all results, bar an abandonment with no play, teams can gain an added maximum of five bonus batting points and five bonus bowling points. Batting points are awarded as 1 point for scoring 125 runs, {{with an extra}} 1 point for every further 25 runs (to a maximum of 5 points), and bowling points are awarded as 1 point for every 2 wickets taken. As thus, {{the maximum amount of}} points that can be gained from a game is 20.|$|E

25|$|An open (non-locking or {{otherwise}} traction-aided) differential always supplies close to equal torque <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>side.</b> To illustrate how this can limit torque {{applied to the}} driving wheels, imagine a simple rear-wheel drive vehicle, with one rear roadwheel on asphalt with good grip, {{and the other on}} a patch of slippery ice. It takes very little torque to spin the side on slippery ice, and because a differential splits torque equally <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>side,</b> the torque that is applied to the side that is on asphalt is limited to this amount.|$|E

25|$|Negotiation {{can take}} {{a wide variety of}} forms, from a trained {{negotiator}} acting on behalf of a particular organization or position in a formal setting to an informal negotiation between friends. Negotiation can be contrasted with mediation, where a neutral third party listens <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>side's</b> arguments and attempts to help craft an agreement between the parties. It can also be compared with arbitration, which resembles a legal proceeding. In arbitration, both sides make an argument as to the merits of their case and the arbitrator decides the outcome. This negotiation is also sometimes called positional or hard-bargaining negotiation.|$|R
