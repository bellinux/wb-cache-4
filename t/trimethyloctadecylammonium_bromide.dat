40|$|There is {{a growing}} concern on the {{relationship}} between anthropogenic carbon dioxide and climate changes. A promising approach is the adsorption technology using mesoporous MCM- 41 materials that can be easily synthesized to depict structures adequate to the flow of gas. The aim {{of this study was to}} improve the synthesis of MCM- 41 using cationic surfactant mixtures and apply the resulting materials to CO 2 adsorption. To that end, the simplex-centroid design was applied to optimize CO 2 adsorption from seven mesoporous MCM- 41 materials synthesized by the hydrothermal method using surfactants from hydrophobic chains of different sizes. The cationic surfactants used were tetradecyltrimetylammonium bromide, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide, <b>trimethyloctadecylammonium</b> <b>bromide</b> and their mixture at ratios of 1 : 1 and 1 : 1 : 1. The CO 2 adsorption was investigated using thegravimetric method at 298 K and pressures up to 40 bar. The resulting materials, labelled C 17, C 19, C 21, C 17 C 19, C 19 C 21, C 17 C 21 and C 17 C 19 C 21, were characterized by XRD, FTIR, TG and SEM and showed significant differences in structure as well as in the mass of CO 2 adsorption. The response models showed that the best combination of the surfactants resulted from C 17 C 19 sample, which presented synergistic interactions reaching the highest value of CO 2 adsorption (0. 62 g CO 2 /g adsorbent), compared to other samples...|$|E
