5|$|Later works—The Chronology of Ancient Kingdoms Amended (1728) and Observations Upon <b>the</b> <b>Prophecies</b> of Daniel and the Apocalypse of St. John (1733)—were {{published}} {{after his}} death. He also devoted {{a great deal}} of time to alchemy (see above).|$|E
5|$|Alexander was a {{supporter}} of Gilbert of Sempringham's new monastic order of the Gilbertines, {{and he was also}} known as a patron of literature. He commissioned Geoffrey of Monmouth to compose <b>the</b> <b>Prophecies</b> of Merlin, which Geoffrey dedicated to him. Alexander was a patron of the medieval chronicler Henry of Huntingdon, and requested that Henry write his historical work.|$|E

5|$|Along {{with his}} {{scientific}} fame, Newton's {{studies of the}} Bible and of the early Church Fathers were also noteworthy. Newton wrote works on textual criticism, most notably An Historical Account of Two Notable Corruptions of Scripture and Observations upon <b>the</b> <b>Prophecies</b> of Daniel, and the Apocalypse of St. John. He placed the crucifixion of Jesus Christ at 3 April, AD 33, which agrees with one traditionally accepted date.|$|E
5|$|To defy <b>the</b> <b>prophecies,</b> Oleg {{sent the}} horse away. Many {{years later he}} asked where his horse was, and was told it had died. He asked to see the remains and {{was taken to the}} place where the bones lay. When he touched the horse's skull with his boot a snake slithered from the skull and bit him. Oleg died, thus {{fulfilling}} the prophecy.|$|E
5|$|As a {{spin-off}} {{from the}} Rudolphine Tables {{and the related}} Ephemerides, Kepler published astrological calendars, which were very popular and helped offset the costs of producing his other work—especially when support from the Imperial treasury was withheld. In his calendars—six between 1617 and 1624—Kepler forecast planetary positions and weather {{as well as political}} events; the latter were often cannily accurate, thanks to his keen grasp of contemporary political and theological tensions. By 1624, however, the escalation of those tensions and the ambiguity of <b>the</b> <b>prophecies</b> meant political trouble for Kepler himself; his final calendar was publicly burned in Graz.|$|E

50|$|At World Title Classic, <b>The</b> <b>Prophecy</b> and <b>the</b> Second City Saints {{fought against}} each other, {{as well as}} against the Briscoe Brothers and Generation Next, in ROH's first Ultimate Endurance match. The match was an {{elimination}} match, and after a team was eliminated the rules changed, essentially making it three matches in one. The first match, a submission match, ended with the elimination of Generation Next by <b>The</b> <b>Prophecy.</b> <b>The</b> second match, a scramble tag match, ended with {{the elimination of the}} Briscoe Brothers, again by <b>The</b> <b>Prophecy.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Prophecy</b> and <b>the</b> Saints then fought in a falls count anywhere match. The two teams fought all over the arena and used weapons such as chairs and tables to hurt each other. <b>The</b> <b>Prophecy</b> won after Maff gave Colt Cabana a Burning Hammer off the top rope, through a table. After the match, Dan Maff, knowing that Christopher Daniels won't return to Ring of Honor, convinced BJ Whitmer that they should drop <b>The</b> <b>Prophecy</b> name and go out on their own. Whitmer agreed and the two walked away from <b>The</b> <b>Prophecy,</b> as well as Allison Danger. <b>The</b> <b>Prophecy</b> was now officially ended.|$|R

5|$|Branham {{claimed to}} have had a prophetic revelation in June, 1933 that {{comprised}} seven major events that would occur before the Second Coming of Christ. He believed that five of the seven predictions, relating to world politics, science, and the moral condition of the world, had been fulfilled. The final two visions, one related to the Roman Catholic Church gaining power in the United States and the second detailing the destruction of the United States, would be fulfilled by 1977, subsequent to which Christ would return. A comparison of Branham's descriptions of <b>the</b> <b>prophecies</b> reveals his tendency to exaggerate and embellish his actual predictions.|$|E
5|$|In late 1916 Fisher {{and another}} {{prominent}} Bible Student at the Brooklyn headquarters, Clayton J. Woodworth, sought the Executive Committee's approval {{to produce a}} book about <b>the</b> <b>prophecies</b> of the books of Revelation and Ezekiel based primarily on Russell's writings. Work on the book, The Finished Mystery, proceeded without {{the knowledge of the}} full Board of Directors and Editorial Committee and was released by Rutherford to headquarters staff on July 17, 1917, the day he announced the appointment of the four replacement directors.|$|E
5|$|Torn's primary {{narrative}} {{revolved around}} a wandering protagonist character, cursed to bring pain and misfortune wherever {{he or she}} traveled, and to whomever he or she traveled with. A misguided king, later revealed to be the game's ultimate antagonist, would have acted as the player's benefactor, assigning them various quests in order to discover the truth about a series of apparently conflicting prophecies. It would eventually have been revealed that all <b>the</b> <b>prophecies,</b> and even the protangonist character's mysterious curse, could be rationalized, and were in fact related to the protagonist character, effectively granting the player control over which interpretation of the future was realized.|$|E

5|$|Cosades inducts {{the player}} into the Blades on the Emperor's orders, {{and sets the}} player on various quests to uncover the mysterious disappearances and revelations that the {{citizens}} of Vvardenfell have experienced, particularly the Sixth House and the Ashlander prophecies of the Nerevarine. It is later revealed that the induction under Cosades, and the player's release from prison, {{was due to the}} Emperor's suspicion that the player might be the Nerevarine – a reincarnation of the legendary Dunmer hero Indoril Nerevar – or at least someone would make a convincing imposter to use for political gain. The PC is tasked with uncovering <b>the</b> <b>prophecies</b> regarding the Nerevarine, and to fulfil them in order to finally defeat Dagoth Ur and his Sixth House cult.|$|E
5|$|The quatrains, {{published}} in a book titled Les Propheties (<b>The</b> <b>Prophecies),</b> received a mixed reaction when they were published. Some people thought Nostradamus was a servant of evil, a fake, or insane, {{while many of the}} elite evidently thought otherwise. Catherine de' Medici, wife of King Henry II of France, was one of Nostradamus's greatest admirers. After reading his almanacs for 1555, which hinted at unnamed threats to the royal family, she summoned him to Paris to explain them and to draw up horoscopes for her children. At the time, he feared that he would be beheaded, but by {{the time of his death}} in 1566, Queen Catherine had made him Counselor and Physician-in-Ordinary to her son, the young King Charles IX of France.|$|E
5|$|The game's opening sees Ringford {{holding the}} Cauldron and its {{controlling}} ring Titrel, having been given Titrel by Ingway {{as part of}} his vengeance against Odin. Elfaria is ultimately killed by Odin, who takes Titrel from her. Velvet steals it in turn and gives it to the dragon Wagner, hoping that this would prevent the Cauldron being used. Her lover Cornelius is meanwhile changed into a Pooka by Ingway and thrown into the Netherworld, escaping with the aid of his grandfather Gallon. He learns that the people of Valentine share his curse, and is embroiled in both the Pookas' efforts to collect wish-granting coins to reverse their condition and his attempts to save Velvet from danger. The Three Wise Men are attempting to fulfill <b>the</b> <b>prophecies</b> of the Armageddon — all but one Wise Man are killed {{during the course of the}} story, while the third Beldor is afflicted with the Pooka's curse and gains subsequent immortality. Cornelius rescues Velvet from their clutches, and despite his fears she reaffirms her love for him in his new form. Several characters also encounter King Valentine, who continues to be tormented by memories of murdering Velvet's mother in a rage — {{as part of his}} scheme to trigger the Armageddon, he hatches the dragon Leventhan.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>prophecy</b> is {{probably}} <b>the</b> earliest {{example in the}} Hebrew Bible of a representation of a heavenly throne room. It {{is not clear whether}} <b>the</b> <b>prophecy</b> represents Micaiah's own belief or a depiction of the beliefs of Ahab's prophets such as Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah, who struck him after <b>the</b> <b>prophecy</b> (1 Kings 22:24).|$|R
2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>Prophecy</b> of Berchán, an 11th-century verse {{history of}} Scots and Irish kings {{presented}} as a prophecy, is a notably difficult source. As <b>the</b> <b>Prophecy</b> refers to kings by epithets, but never by name, linking it to other materials is not straightforward. <b>The</b> <b>Prophecy</b> is believed to refer to Giric by the epithet Mac Rath, [...] "the Son of Fortune".|$|R
50|$|Although {{the legend}} of Perseus opens with <b>the</b> <b>prophecy</b> that he will kill his {{grandfather}} Acrisius, and his abandonment with his mother Danaë, <b>the</b> <b>prophecy</b> is only self-fulfilling in some variants. In some, he accidentally spears his grandfather at a competition—an act {{that could have happened}} regardless of Acrisius' response to <b>the</b> <b>prophecy.</b> In other variants, his presence at the games is explained by his hearing of <b>the</b> <b>prophecy,</b> so that his attempt to evade it does cause <b>the</b> <b>prophecy</b> to be fulfilled. In still others, Acrisius is one of the wedding guests when Polydectes tried to force Danaë to marry him, and when Perseus turns them to stone with the Gorgon's head; as Polydectes fell in love with Danaë because Acrisius abandoned her at sea, and Perseus killed the Gorgon as a consequence of Polydectes' attempt to get rid of Danaë's son so that he could marry her, <b>the</b> <b>prophecy</b> fulfilled itself in these variants.|$|R

5|$|Dominican missionaries {{were active}} in Verapaz and the {{southern}} Petén from the late 16th century through the 17th century, attempting non-violent conversion with limited success. In the 17th century the Franciscans {{came to the conclusion}} that the pacification and Christian conversion of the Maya would not be possible as long as the Itza held out at Lake Petén Itzá. The constant flow of escapees fleeing the Spanish-held territories to find refuge with the Itza was a drain on the encomiendas. Fray Bartolomé de Fuensalida visited Nojpetén in 1618 and 1619. The Franciscan missionaries attempted to use their own reinterpretation of the k'atun prophecies when they visited Nojpetén at this time, to convince the current Aj Kan Ek' and his Maya priesthood that the time for conversion had come. But the Itza priesthood interpreted <b>the</b> <b>prophecies</b> differently, and the missionaries were fortunate to escape with their lives. In 1695 the colonial authorities decided to connect the province of Guatemala with Yucatán, and Guatemalan soldiers conquered a number of Ch'ol communities, the most important being Sakb'ajlan on the Lacantún River in eastern Chiapas, now in Mexico, which was renamed as Nuestra Señora de Dolores, or Dolores del Lakandon. The Franciscan friar Andrés de Avendaño oversaw a second attempt to overcome the Itza in 1695, convincing the Itza king that the K'atun 8 Ajaw, a twenty-year Maya calendrical cycle beginning in 1696 or 1697, was the right time for the Itza to finally embrace Christianity and to accept the king of Spain as overlord. However the Itza had local Maya enemies who resisted this conversion, and in 1696 Avendaño was fortunate to escape with his life. The Itza's continued resistance had become a major embarrassment for the Spanish colonial authorities, and soldiers were despatched from Campeche to take Nojpetén once and for all.|$|E

50|$|During this time, <b>The</b> <b>Prophecy</b> {{began to}} feud with the Second City Saints over {{the attack on}} Lucy. CM Punk, seeing <b>The</b> <b>Prophecy</b> as their biggest rival (and vice versa) figured {{they had to be}} behind the attack in order to {{maintain}} their spot as the most dominant faction in Ring of Honor. Punk continuously confronted and called out the members of <b>The</b> <b>Prophecy.</b> At <b>The</b> Conclusion Punk confronted Dan Maff about the attack, who swore on his father's grave that <b>The</b> <b>Prophecy</b> was not behind it. The following night, Punk called out Daniels and demanded to know if <b>The</b> <b>Prophecy</b> was behind <b>the</b> attack. Daniels said they were not, but Punk did not believe him. Punk attacked Daniels and hit him with his own signature move, the Angel's Wings. At Final Battle 2003 Punk had enough and called out <b>The</b> <b>Prophecy.</b> They came out but were soon attacked by the Saints. As Colt Cabana tied Daniels up in the ropes, Punk wrapped a towel around Allison Danger's throat and threatened to kill her if Daniels didn't admit to the attack. B.J. Whitmer, whom Punk had knocked out in their first match and subsequently often insulted on commentary, ran out and attacked Colt Cabana with a chair, freeing Daniels. Daniels chased Punk out of the ring and announced that <b>The</b> <b>Prophecy</b> was behind <b>the</b> attack, but he did not do it. Instead, <b>The</b> <b>Prophecy's</b> newest member BJ Whitmer had been the one who attacked Lucy. Maff, who swore on his father's grave <b>The</b> <b>Prophecy</b> wasn't behind <b>the</b> attack, was shocked and upset by this news, but stayed in the group. Later that night, Daniels and Maff wrestled the Great Muta and Arashi in an interpromotional match between Ring of Honor and All Japan Pro Wrestling. After defeating <b>The</b> <b>Prophecy,</b> <b>the</b> Great Muta offered to shake Daniels' hand, who once again refused. Instead, Daniels, Maff and Allison Danger bowed in a sign of respect.|$|R
