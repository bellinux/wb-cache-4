From Villers-sur-Mer <b>the</b> <b>line</b> rises to an altitude of 130 m to reach the closed station of Gonneville-Saint-Vaast. <b>The</b> <b>line</b> then observes a downward grade in the Drochon valley towards Houlgate.

5|$|A {{number of}} former rail lines in Melbourne and {{regional}} Victoria have {{been converted into}} rail trails, for walking, cycling and horse riding.

Some sections of the track are specially leased to neighbouring farmers for stock grazing. This reduces maintenance costs.|$|E
5|$|After some desperate {{fighting}} in close action, pressure eased somewhat and some lost ground was recovered, but the Ottoman force began to outflank the mounted brigade to the west.
