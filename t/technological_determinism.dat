40|$|Most of the {{academic}} research on the developments of EU Justice and Home Affairs (EU JHA) tends to overlook {{the role played by}} technologies in their relations with classical ‘human’ and institutional actors. This is particularly problematic because in official discourses, technologies are requested, designed, and built as cornerstones of European security and its external dimension. Still, apart from ‘technicalities’, their use and design are generally assumed as politics-free. On the contrary, this contribution brings technologies to the forefront of the research and reframes them in terms of socio-technical assemblages. From this perspective, it analyses the role of the 2011 EU Passenger Name Record project in the making of European security and its external dimension. The lesson learned is that human institutions are neither the only players nor the passive victims of <b>technological</b> <b>determinisms.</b> Rather, focusing on a socio-technical assemblage means to inquire the effective participation of different actors and thus critically discuss the making of European security in terms of politics...|$|R

40|$|An {{interdisciplinary}} reappraisal of Lynn White, Jr. ’s “The Historical Roots of Our Ecologic Crisis” reopens several issues, {{including the}} suggestion by Peter Harrison that White’s thesis was historical {{and that it}} is a mistake to regard it as theological. It also facilitates a comparison between “Roots” and White’s earlier book Medieval Technology and Social Change. In “Roots,” White discarded or de-emphasized numerous qualifications and nuances present in his earlier work so as to heighten the effect of certain rhetorical aphorisms and to generalize their scope and bearing well beyond what the evidence could bear. The meaning of Genesis and other biblical books proves to be just as important in White’s thesis as their historical reception. In “Roots,” White presents, alongside other contentions, the claims that Christian doctrines have all along been both anthropocentric and despotic, especially in the West, and that this is where the real roots of the problems are to be found. These claims, however, conflict with most of the relevant evidence. An adequate reappraisal of White’s work needs to recognize that there is a cultural determinism parallel to the <b>technological</b> <b>determinisms</b> alleged by R. H. Hilton and P. H. Sawyer, to endorse Elspeth Whitney’s “single-cause” critique of links between religion and technological change in the Middle Ages, and to treat sympathetically Whitney’s claim that White and some of his eco-theological critics (despite their disagreements) have in common both their valorizing of individual beliefs and values and their neglect of economic and institutional factors. Nevertheless, our ecological problems need to be understood through explanations turning on beliefs and values as well as on economics and institutions...|$|R
25|$|Scholars, such as Lister et al. (2003), have {{highlighted}} both {{the positive and}} negative potential and actual implications of new media technologies, suggesting that some of the early work into new media studies was guilty of <b>technological</b> <b>determinism</b> whereby the effects of media were determined by the technology themselves, rather than through tracing the complex social networks which governed the development, funding, implementation and future development of any technology.|$|E

25|$|In 2013 Holden {{published}} a novel, Mr. Big Maus, a caper centering on contemporary corporate culture run amok and one iconoclast's mission to rebalance an unjust world. Mr. Big Maus is {{a blend of}} late-modern, contemporary, and post-modern sensibilities, with a plot that is linear and integrated, which eschews mysticism, and provides action that is sudden, direct and rational. This is countered by a narrative that is ironic, characters who are self-reflexive yet irrational, and spiced with the nuance of metafiction. Its protagonist is flawed, disempowered, contending with alienation, and questing to discover identity. The plot presents universal themes within the context of everyday life and features evolution in its character’s lives. It offers the audience a moral resolution. Substantively, the book spotlights history and memory, celebrates intellect and speech, and is optimistic and ultimately uplifting. Among its key themes is discourse about: time, consciousness and human practices. This is seen, above all, through the constant presence, use, and dependence on technology (i.e. the emerging present and looming future), in contrast to the protagonist's constant nostalgia for a reliance on products of cinema, music, television and literature (i.e. the recent and distant past). A second theme is the changing America landscape—reflected in its ubiquitous immigrants—as well as the clash of generational and institutional values. A final theme, built from strands of the previous two, is the ways that innovation, invention, commercialization and business influence and are influenced by the poles of <b>technological</b> <b>determinism</b> and independent creative expression.|$|E

40|$|This paper explores how interorganizational net-works coevolve with {{technology}} in the modern flight simulation industry. Since industries characterized by complex technologies, like flight simulation, rely on cooperative groups such as technical committees, task forces and standards bodies to adjudicate the process of technological evolution, we focus on these groups and term them 'cooperative technical organizations' (CTOs). Focusing on CTOs enables a multi-level examination of interorganizational networks, as individuals represent their employing organizations in CTOs, mapping into overlapping membership patterns which generate community-wide networks. We develop a set of propositions on the emergence, growth and re-formation of CTO networks, and explore how the evolution of these networks both shapes and is constrained & by technological outcomes in the flight simulation industry. We argue that varying levels <- * of technological uncertainty between eras of ferment (high uncertainty) and eras of incremental change (low uncertainty) engender fundamentally different modes of 2 network evolution: social construction during eras of ferment, and <b>technological</b> * <b>determinism</b> during eras of incremental change.

40|$|Organizational change {{related to}} {{information}} and communication technologies (ICT) has been a well-discussed topic over the last few decades. Both positivist approaches, such as <b>technological</b> or organizational <b>determinism,</b> and socio-economic and socio-technical approaches have been prevalent as research approaches in ICT change literature. Within the interpretative realm embodied in the social approaches, the concept of emergent change – that is, change as emerging or enacted over time – has been paramount. This paper provides an overview of the development of emergent change approaches and theories, with the body of the review focusing on the primary lines of approach developed and used in the last decade. It goes on to review research studies performed in the current environment, and assesses how they correspond to the approaches and questions raised therein.

40|$|In {{the last}} decade or so, the major {{development}} agencies have explicitly turned the spotlights on ‘knowledge for development’, ‘ICT for development’, or the ‘knowledge economy’ as new panacea to prompt development. This article argues, ﬁrst, that knowledge and technology have always been integrally part of the very idea of ‘development’ since its emergence during Enlightenment. Recent appeals to knowledge or technology for development should be placed in an age-long genealogy of similar rationales. Second, the article elucidates that discourses about the roles of knowledge and technology in development have always varied widely, with deterministic and less deterministic interpretations often existing along each other. In this article, the many diﬀerent interpretations are unravelled. Even today, very opposing roles are ascribed to knowledge and technology in development. Whereas strong versions of <b>technological</b> and epistemic <b>determinism</b> still reverberate in some present-day development discourses, they are simultaneously countered by discourses focusing on ‘capacity building’...|$|R
40|$|The {{recognition}} that information systems comprise both technical and social elements {{has not been}} matched {{by the emergence of}} a coherent theoretical understanding of the nature of, and relationship between, these elements.

40|$|Drawing on {{the fields}} of {{organisational}} theory, information systems and human-computer interaction, this paper proposes a novel perspective for studying information systems usage by individuals in organisations – in this case, in the back office of a major US-based accounting firm. By conceptualising usage as a holistic user experience – a situated and temporally emergent inseparable mesh of behaviour, bodily movements, perception, cognition and affect – the researcher can avoid misleading reductionism and the overly simplistic reasoning of <b>technological</b> or social <b>determinism.</b> To demonstrate empirically {{the value of this}} perspective, the paper focuses on the intertwining of two aspects commonly ignored in prior information systems literature – the affective and the material. Building on Pickering’s (1993) “mangle of practice”, and on the literatures on moods (Bless and Fiedler, 2006), identity (Ashforth and Mael, 1989) and sociomateriality (Orlikowski, 2010), the entanglement of human identity, affective states and enterprise systems materiality is examined, based on observational and interview data.

The paper proposes an integration of their key positions to generate a more rounded and complete account of the role of e-democracy in practice. It suggests that Giddens's Structuration Theory provides a starting point in this direction. A structuration perspective is able to integrate many of the diverse perspectives whilst simultaneously avoiding <b>technological</b> and social <b>determinism</b> by focusing attention on the interplay of social structures and agency in e-democracy practices. This perspective assists in illuminating the underlying institutional arrangements and structures in which e-democracy practices are embedded, as well as the strategies employed by human actors. It focuses attention on structures of signification, domination and legitimation that surround e-democracy practices and also how individuals are both enabled and constrained in these practices. It is argued that more complete and balanced accounts which emerge from such an integrated perspective could assist in developing a more effective e-democracy policy...|$|R

40|$|The {{nature of}} the {{relationship}} between information technology (IT) and organizations has been a long-standing debate in the Information Systems literature. Does IT shape organizations, or do people in organisations control how IT is used? To formulate the question a little differently: does agency (the capacity to make a difference) lie predominantly with machines (computer systems) or humans (organisational actors) ? Many proposals for a middle way between the extremes of <b>technological</b> and social <b>determinism</b> have been put advanced; in recent years researchers oriented towards social theories have focused on structuration theory and (lately) actor network theory. These two theories, however, adopt different and incompatible views of agency. Thus, structuration theory sees agency as exclusively a property of humans, whereas the principle of general symmetry in actor network theory implies that machines may also be agents. Drawing on critiques of both structuration theory and actor network theory, this paper develops a theoretical account of the interaction between human and machine agency: the double dance of agency. The account seeks to contribute to theorisation of the relationship between technology and organisation by recognizing both the different character of human and machine agency, and the emergent properties of their interplay...|$|R
40|$|Seen {{through the}} lens of {{contemporary}} cultural theory, the relation between text and technology is still too often conceived in dichotomous terms. Either technological materialities effect decisive, irreversible changes in the content of communication or the socio-cultural articulation under investigation transcends the particularities of the technological infrastructure and regimes of circulation. This tendency towards <b>technological</b> or textual <b>determinism</b> has been particularly acute in new media research which focuses either on the geo-political form of informational networks or the located practices of the ethnographer's text: form/content; global/local; theoretical/empirical; production/consumption.

40|$|A long-standing {{debate in}} the IS {{literature}} concerns the relationship between technology and organization. Is it technology that acts on organizations, or humans that determine how technology is used? Proposals for a middle way between the extremes of <b>technological</b> and social <b>determinism</b> have been put forward based on Giddens’ structuration theory, and, more recently, from actor network theory. The two theories, however, may be seen to adopt rather different, and potentially incompatible, views of agency (action). Thus, structuration theory sees agency as a uniquely human property, whereas the principle of general symmetry in actor network theory implies that machines may also be actors (agents). This rather fundamental disagreement may be characterized as the problem of agency. At the empirical level the problem of agency was played out in a Canadian telecoms company adopting an ERP system. Was it the mangers and unions (the human agents) that were determining the trajectory of the organization, or did the ERP system also play a role? This paper argues that neither structuration theory or actor network theory offers a particularly convincing account of the interplay of human and machine agency in this case. Since they cannot easily be combined, IS researchers need to develop more convincing theories which are focused on organization and IT. Some guidelines for this development are offered...|$|R
