5|$|In mid January 2013, Japan's {{central bank}} {{signaled}} {{the intention to}} launch an open ended bond buying programme which would likely devalue <b>the</b> <b>yen.</b> This resulted in short lived but intense period of alarm {{about the risk of}} a possible fresh round of currency war.|$|E
5|$|In late 1929, {{the party}} was {{weakened}} by an internal split. Under increasing French pressure, the VNQDD leadership switched tack, replacing a strategy of isolated clandestine attacks against individuals {{with a plan to}} expel the French in a single blow with a large-scale popular uprising. After stockpiling home-made weapons, the VNQDD launched <b>the</b> <b>Yên</b> Bái mutiny on February 10, 1930 with the aim of sparking a widespread revolt. VNQDD forces combined with disaffected Vietnamese troops, who mutinied against the French colonial army. The mutiny was quickly put down, with heavy French retribution. Học and other leading figures were captured and executed and the VNQDD never regained its political strength in the country.|$|E
5|$|Numerous senior central {{bankers and}} finance ministers issued public warnings, the first being Alexei Ulyukayev, the first deputy {{chairman}} at Russia's central bank. He was later joined by many others including Park Jae-wan, the finance minister for South Korea, and by Jens Weidmann, {{president of the}} Bundesbank. Weidmann held the view that interventions during the 2009–11 period were not intense enough to count as competitive devaluation, but that a genuine currency war is now a real possibility. Japan's economy minister Akira Amari {{has said that the}} Bank of Japan's bond buying programme is intended to combat deflation, and not to weaken <b>the</b> <b>yen.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Japanese {{military}} yen (Chinese and Japanese: 日本軍用手票, also 日本軍票 in short), commonly abbreviated as JMY, was the :currency {{issued to}} the soldiers of the Imperial Japanese Army and the Imperial Japanese Navy as a salary. The Imperial Japanese government first started issuing <b>the</b> military <b>yen</b> during <b>the</b> Russo-Japanese War in 1904. <b>The</b> military <b>yen</b> reached its peak during the Pacific War period, when the Japanese government excessively issued it to all of its occupied territories. In Hong Kong, <b>the</b> military <b>yen</b> was forced upon the local population as the sole official currency of the territory. [...] Since <b>the</b> military <b>yen</b> was not backed by gold, {{and did not have}} a specific place of issuance, <b>the</b> military <b>yen</b> could not be exchanged for <b>the</b> Japanese <b>yen.</b> Forcing local populations to use <b>the</b> military <b>yen</b> officially was one of the ways the Japanese government could dominate the local economies.|$|R

5|$|Shortly {{after midnight}} on 10 February, about 50 Vietnamese {{soldiers}} (Tirailleurs indochinois) of the 4th Regiment of Tonkinese Rifles within <b>the</b> <b>Yen</b> Bay garrison turned on their French officers with assistance from about sixty civilian VNQDDĐ members who invaded the camp from the outside. The mutiny failed within 24 hours when {{the majority of}} the Vietnamese soldiers in the garrison refused to participate and remained loyal to the colonial army. Further sporadic attacks occurred across the Delta region, with little impact. French retribution to the attack was swift and decisive. The main leaders of the VNQDD were arrested, tried and put to death, effectively ending the military threat of what was previously the leading Vietnamese nationalist revolutionary organisation.|$|E
5|$|The battle {{concluded}} as {{the worst}} day for the United States Air Force in Vietnam since 2 December 1966, when they had lost five aircraft over the skies of North Vietnam in a single day. Consequently, the actions of 23 August became known as ‘Black Wednesday’ amongst U.S. pilots who participated in air operations over Hanoi on that particular day. The USAF officially confirmed the loss of three F-4D fighters during the raid against <b>the</b> <b>Yen</b> Vien rail yard, {{which resulted in the}} deaths of Weapon Systems Officers Captain Ronald N. Sittner (66-0238, 8th TFW) and First Lieutenant Charles Lane (66-00247, 8th TFW). Major Charles R. Tyler, Captain Larry E. Carrigan, Major Robert R. Sawhill and First Lieutenant Gerald L. Gerndt ejected safely from their aircraft, but they were captured alive and became prisoners of war. Major C.B. Demarque and his Weapons System Officer, First Lieutenant J.M. Piet were rescued shortly after they ejected from their malfunctioned aircraft over Thai airspace.|$|E
5|$|In response, the Seventh Air Force {{launched}} repeated {{strikes on}} <b>the</b> <b>Yen</b> Vien rail yard and other infrastructures which linked Hanoi with the China buffer zone. On 21 August 1967, a formation of twenty F-105 Thunderchiefs and eight F-4 Phantoms raided Yen Vien, which contained about 150 boxcars. The Americans {{claimed to have}} damaged {{more than half of}} the boxcars and trapped the remainder in the rail yard, so they returned two days later to destroy the rest. On the afternoon of 23 August 1967, a flight of sixteen F-4s from the 8th Tactical Fighter Wing escorted a formation of thirty-six F-105 strike aircraft from the 355th and 388th Tactical Fighter Wings based in Thailand, for the second attack on Yen Vien. The 555th Tactical Fighter Squadron provided two flights of F-4 Phantoms, ‘Ford’ flight and ‘Falcon’ flight. The mission was led by Colonel Nicholas J. Donelson with Olds, who spearheaded Operation Bolo back in January, as the leader of the escort formation. At 1:45pm on 23 August, North Vietnamese radars detected a flight of 40 U.S aircraft approaching Hanoi from Sam Neua, in neighboring Laos.|$|E

25|$|Despite intervention, market {{pressures}} caused <b>the</b> <b>yen</b> {{to continue}} climbing in value, peaking temporarily {{at an average}} of ¥271 per US$1 in 1973, before the impact of the 1973 oil crisis was felt. The increased costs of imported oil caused <b>the</b> <b>yen</b> to depreciate to a range of ¥290 to ¥300 between 1974 and 1976. The re-emergence of trade surpluses drove <b>the</b> <b>yen</b> back up to ¥211 in 1978. This currency strengthening was again reversed by the second oil shock in 1979, with <b>the</b> <b>yen</b> dropping to ¥227 by 1980.|$|E
25|$|Following World War II <b>the</b> <b>yen</b> {{lost much}} of its prewar value. To {{stabilize}} the Japanese economy the exchange rate of <b>the</b> <b>yen</b> was fixed at ¥360 per $1 as part of the Bretton Woods system. When that system was abandoned in 1971, <b>the</b> <b>yen</b> became undervalued and was allowed to float. <b>The</b> <b>yen</b> had appreciated to a peak of ¥271 per $1 in 1973, then underwent periods of depreciation and appreciation due to the 1973 oil crisis, arriving at a value of ¥227 per $1 by 1980.|$|E
25|$|The {{relative}} value of <b>the</b> <b>yen</b> is determined in foreign exchange markets {{by the economic}} forces of supply and demand. The supply of <b>the</b> <b>yen</b> in the market is governed by the desire of yen holders to exchange their yen for other currencies to purchase goods, services, or assets. The demand for <b>the</b> <b>yen</b> is governed by the desire of foreigners to buy goods and services in Japan and by their interest in investing in Japan (buying yen-denominated real and financial assets).|$|E

50|$|After <b>the</b> B <b>yen</b> was demonetised {{rather than}} being incinerated (as is usual with {{obsolete}} banknotes), <b>the</b> B <b>yen</b> banknotes were placed into large concrete containers indelible red dye, which were buried at sea at unrecoverable depths.|$|R
50|$|When <b>the</b> {{military}} <b>yen</b> {{was first}} introduced on 26 December 1941, the exchange rate between the Hong Kong dollar and <b>the</b> military <b>yen</b> was 2 to 1. However, by October 1942, the rate was changed to 4 to 1.|$|R
25|$|Following {{the silver}} {{devaluation}} of 1873, <b>the</b> <b>yen</b> devalued against the U.S. dollar and the Canadian dollar (since those two countries adhered to a gold standard), {{and by the}} year 1897, <b>the</b> <b>yen</b> was worth only about US$0.50. In that year, Japan adopted a gold exchange standard and hence froze the value of <b>the</b> <b>yen</b> at $0.50. This exchange rate remained in place until Japan left the gold standard in December 1931, after which <b>the</b> <b>yen</b> fell to $0.30 by July 1932 and to $0.20 by 1933. It remained steady at around $0.30 until {{the start of the}} Second World War on December 7, 1941, at which time it fell to $0.23.|$|E
25|$|In 1985, a {{dramatic}} change began. Finance officials from major nations signed an agreement (the Plaza Accord) affirming that the dollar was overvalued (and, therefore, <b>the</b> <b>yen</b> undervalued). This agreement, and shifting supply and demand pressures in the markets, led to a rapid rise {{in the value of}} <b>the</b> <b>yen.</b> From its average of ¥239 per US$1 in 1985, <b>the</b> <b>yen</b> rose to a peak of ¥128 in 1988, virtually doubling its value relative to the dollar. After declining somewhat in 1989 and 1990, it reached a new high of ¥123 to US$1 in December 1992. In April 1995, <b>the</b> <b>yen</b> hit a peak of under 80 yen per dollar, temporarily making Japan's economy nearly the size of the US.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>yen</b> {{declined}} {{during the}} Japanese {{asset price bubble}} and continued to do so afterwards, reaching a low of ¥134 to US$1 in February 2002. The Bank of Japan's policy of zero interest rates has discouraged yen investments, with the carry trade of investors borrowing yen and investing in better-paying currencies (thus further pushing down <b>the</b> <b>yen)</b> estimated to be as large as $1 trillion. In February 2007, The Economist estimated that <b>the</b> <b>yen</b> was 15% undervalued against the dollar, {{and as much as}} 40% undervalued against the euro.|$|E
5000|$|There was a B-Series {{version of}} <b>the</b> one <b>yen</b> bill. It {{featured}} {{a portrait of}} Ninomiya Sontoku (二宮 尊徳). Due {{to the production of}} <b>the</b> one <b>yen</b> aluminum coin in 1955, there wasn't a need to circulate the bills.|$|R

40|$|In 1987, gems were {{discovered}} in <b>the</b> Luc <b>Yen</b> area of Vietnam's Yen Bai province. Ruby, sapphire, and spinel from primary and secondary deposits are the most valuable of these; tourmaline, gem-quality feldspar, pargasite, and humite are also mined there. As {{a result of this}} discovery, <b>the</b> Luc <b>Yen</b> district has become Vietnam's most important gemstone-trading center over the past 30 years. <b>The</b> markets of <b>Yen</b> <b>The,</b> the capital of Luc Yen, offer an additional assortment of natural gems from Vietnam and elsewhere (including peridot, beryl, aquamarine, topaz, and quartz); synthetic gems are also found in these markets...|$|R
25|$|In the 1970s, Japanese {{government}} and business people were very concerned that {{a rise in the}} value of <b>the</b> <b>yen</b> would hurt export growth by making Japanese products less competitive and would damage the industrial base. The government therefore continued to intervene heavily in foreign-exchange marketing (buying or selling dollars), even after the 1973 decision, to allow <b>the</b> <b>yen</b> to float.|$|E
25|$|No true {{exchange}} rate existed for <b>the</b> <b>yen</b> between December 7, 1941, and April 25, 1949; wartime inflation reduced <b>the</b> <b>yen</b> to {{a fraction of}} its pre-war value. After a period of instability, on April 25, 1949, the U.S. occupation government fixed the value of <b>the</b> <b>yen</b> at ¥360 per US$1 through a United States plan, {{which was part of}} the Bretton Woods System, to stabilize prices in the Japanese economy. That {{exchange rate}} was maintained until 1971, when the United States abandoned the gold standard, which had been a key element of the Bretton Woods System, and imposed a 10 percent surcharge on imports, setting in motion changes that eventually led to floating exchange rates in 1973.|$|E

40|$|The US dollar {{has kept}} as a {{position}} of key currency {{in the global economy}} in the changing international monetary system where the euro was introduced to some states of the EU in 1999. It is an evidence of inertia of the US dollar as a key currency. Our previous study (Ogawa and Muto, 2017 b) conducted empirical analysis to investigate effects of several events on inertia of the US dollar. One of our findings was that the introduction of the euro increased utility of euro while utility of US dollar was kept unchanged. This paper examines the effects of the global financial crisis and the euro zone crisis as well as the introduction of the euro on the utility of <b>the</b> Japanese <b>yen.</b> <b>The</b> introduction of the euro significantly decreased the utility of <b>the</b> Japanese <b>yen.</b> It indicates that the introduction of the euro increased the utility of the euro while reducing the utility of <b>the</b> Japanese <b>yen</b> rather than <b>the</b> utility of the US dollar. The utility of <b>the</b> Japanese <b>yen</b> has significantly decreased while the global financial crisis and the euro zone crisis occurred. <b>The</b> Japanese <b>yen</b> has a declining trend in terms of its utility over time in the changing international monetary system...|$|R

25|$|By 1971, <b>the</b> <b>yen</b> {{had become}} undervalued. Japanese exports were costing too little in {{international}} markets, and imports from abroad were costing the Japanese too much. This undervaluation {{was reflected in}} the current account balance, which had risen from the deficits of the early 1960s, to a then-large surplus of US$5.8 billion in 1971. The belief that <b>the</b> <b>yen,</b> and several other major currencies, were undervalued motivated the United States' actions in 1971.|$|E

25|$|In {{the decades}} {{following}} World War II, Japan implemented stringent tariffs and policies {{to encourage the}} people to save their income.
