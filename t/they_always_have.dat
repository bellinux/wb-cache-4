5|$|Females and juveniles, {{especially}} of the pale eastern subspecies, E. c. erythrogenys, may be confused with pine buntings, but <b>they</b> <b>always</b> <b>have</b> a yellow tint to their plumage, a paler rufous rump and more uniform upperparts than that species. Young and female yellowhammers can be distinguished from cirl buntings by the grey-brown rump of the latter species. Male hybrids with pine bunting are typically white-faced and have some yellow on the head, underparts or flight feathers, but females are usually indistinguishable from yellowhammers.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{consequences}} of the development of the entertainment industry has been the creation of new types of employment. While jobs such as writer, musician and composer exist as <b>they</b> <b>always</b> <b>have,</b> people doing this work are likely to be employed by a company rather than a patron as they once would have been. New jobs have appeared, such as gaffer or special effects supervisor in the film industry, and attendants in an amusement park.|$|E
50|$|Another notable {{feature of}} the strip was the names of Police Inspectors who came to clean {{up at the end}} of the strip; <b>they</b> <b>always</b> <b>had</b> very apt Hindi-English words.|$|R
50|$|Prior to the attack, the yacht's {{crew had}} been very careful when {{travelling}} up the river and back down again; <b>they</b> <b>always</b> <b>had</b> crew members on watch. Only upon return to Macapa did they relax their guard.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{assured that}} they are inseparable since the work was begun. <b>They</b> <b>always</b> <b>had</b> a leaning to each other, and now I hear they pass their time between {{the steps of the}} Carlton and Reform Clubs." ...|$|R
5|$|Although the heme {{proteins}} are {{the most}} important class of iron-containing proteins, the iron-sulfur proteins are also very important, being involved in electron transfer, which is possible since iron can exist stably in either the +2 or +3 oxidation states. These have one, two, four, or eight iron atoms that are each approximately tetrahedrally coordinated to four sulfur atoms; because of this tetrahedral coordination, <b>they</b> <b>always</b> <b>have</b> high-spin iron. The simplest of such compounds is rubredoxin, which has only one iron atom coordinated to four sulfur atoms from cysteine residues in the surrounding peptide chains. Another important class of iron-sulfur proteins is the ferredoxins, which have multiple iron atoms. Transferrin does not belong to either of these classes.|$|E

25|$|Although most {{governments in}} the world are, as <b>they</b> <b>always</b> <b>have</b> been, autocracies {{of one kind or}} another, no idea hold greater sway in the mind of educated Americans than the belief that it is {{possible}} to democratize governments, anytime, anywhere, under any circumstances... (But) decades, if not centuries, are normally required for people to acquire the necessary disciplines and habits.|$|E
6000|$|... "So he was, {{but then}} <b>they</b> <b>always</b> <b>had</b> a great affection for him, {{although}} he had so many eccentricities. You remember that when the weather was the least cold, {{he would try to}} come into the house." ...|$|R
50|$|<b>They</b> <b>have</b> <b>always</b> <b>had</b> a {{rivalry with}} Peterhead but as Peterhead got {{promoted}} into the Scottish league the rivalry has wavered somewhat.|$|R
50|$|When {{ephemeris}} time was first adopted, time scales were still based on astronomical observation, as <b>they</b> <b>always</b> <b>had</b> been. The accuracy was {{limited by the}} accuracy of optical observation, and corrections of clocks and time signals were published in arrear.|$|R
25|$|In {{the lower}} middle school pupils start school at 8:00 AM and finish at 2:00PM (Although {{they can start}} later, <b>they</b> <b>always</b> <b>have</b> to attend school {{for at least five}} hours, with some {{differences}} based on the days they attend), while for high school, depending on the school, they attend school 5 to 7 hours a day based {{on the day of the}} week and the exact choice of school.|$|E
25|$|Geophilomorph centipedes {{have been}} used to argue for the {{developmental}} constraint of evolution; that the evolvability of a trait, the number of segments in the case of geophilomorph centipedes, was constrained by the mode of development. The geophilomorph centipedes have variable segment numbers within species, yet as with all centipedes, <b>they</b> <b>always</b> <b>have</b> an odd number of pairs of legs. In this taxon, the number of segments ranges from 27 to 191, but is never an even number.|$|E
25|$|People are slotted into {{functions}} {{insofar as}} they have characteristics which are at least compatible with the functions. <b>They</b> <b>always</b> <b>have</b> a choice in how they perform their role and how they act it out, {{but they have no}} choice about taking it on. If they succeed in their role, they can advance their position or career, but if they fail to live up to it, they are demoted or fired. Human individuality is then conceptualized in terms of the relationship between buyer and seller.|$|E
30|$|Gina: I’ve {{never seen}} so many women with {{sleeveless}} dresses until she [Michelle Obama] put that out there. It seemed like women <b>always</b> <b>had</b> sleeveless dresses on, but <b>they</b> <b>always</b> <b>had</b> a cover over it. Now, everybody’s baring their shoulders from young to old… and you just never saw that before.|$|R
60|$|One {{afternoon}} {{before the}} early supper <b>they</b> <b>always</b> <b>had,</b> Dale and Helen were watching Bo teasing the bear. She {{was in her}} most vixenish mood, full of life and fight. Tom lay his long length on the grass, watching with narrow, gleaming eyes.|$|R
6000|$|... "Indeed they are!" [...] {{declared}} Spouter. [...] "I {{heard my}} father say he wouldn't take four {{hundred dollars for}} Blackbird. And the other animals must be worth {{at least a hundred}} and fifty dollars apiece. You know <b>they</b> <b>always</b> <b>had</b> pretty good horses on this ranch." ...|$|R
25|$|The {{leaves are}} usually {{alternate}} and compound. Most {{often they are}} even- or odd-pinnately compound (e.g. Caragana and Robinia respectively), often trifoliate (e.g. Trifolium, Medicago) and rarely palmately compound (e.g. Lupinus), in the Mimosoideae and the Caesalpinioideae commonly bipinnate (e.g. Acacia, Mimosa). <b>They</b> <b>always</b> <b>have</b> stipules, which can be leaf-like (e.g. Pisum), thorn-like (e.g. Robinia) or be rather inconspicuous. Leaf margins are entire or, occasionally, serrate. Both the leaves and the leaflets often have wrinkled pulvini to permit nastic movements. In some species, leaflets have evolved into tendrils (e.g. Vicia).|$|E
25|$|Modern prisoners {{occupy the}} lowest rungs {{on the social}} class ladder, and <b>they</b> <b>always</b> <b>have.</b> The modern prison system (along with local jails) is a {{collection}} of ghettos or poorhouses reserved primarily for the unskilled, the uneducated, and the powerless. In increasing numbers this system is being reserved for racial minorities, especially blacks, which is why we are calling it the New American Apartheid. This is the same segment of American society that has experienced some of the most drastic reductions in income and they have been targeted for their involvement in drugs and the subsequent violence that extends from the lack of legitimate means of goal attainment.|$|E
25|$|Measures {{other than}} {{drainage}} {{have been implemented}} to contain flooding in the city. In 1950, dikes were built to confine storm runoff. Rivers that run through the city were encapsulated in 1950 and 1951. Rivers such as the Consulado River, Churubusco River and the Remedio River are encased in concrete tunnels which take their waters directly to the drainage system to leave the Valley. Two other rivers, the San Javier and the Tlalnepantla, which used to feed the old lake system, are diverted {{before they reach the}} city and their waters now flow directly into the Grand Canal. None of water from these rivers is allowed to sink into the ground to recharge the aquifer. While the rivers and streams that flow down from the mountain peaks still begin the way <b>they</b> <b>always</b> <b>have,</b> their passage through the shantytowns lacking city sanitation schemes that surround Mexico City turns them into open combined sewers. Therefore, their final stages are frequently culverted or added to the existing major culverted rivers to keep this water from contaminating the aquifer.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, thank you," [...] breathed the artist. [...] "I didn't know. And I did {{hate to see}} {{the thick}} peeling go; it seemed such a waste. But I thought <b>they</b> <b>always</b> <b>had</b> to be peeled. When you've got only {{potatoes}} to eat, the peelings count, you know." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You see," [...] said Emmeline, [...] "though {{they did}} only <b>have</b> {{potatoes}} before, <b>they</b> <b>always</b> <b>had</b> them quite warm; and though {{a dinner of}} potatoes seems very poor, they did have it altogether, in their own houses, you know; and I think the very cooking it was some comfort to them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Nonsense, my love. And as to your bonnets, <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>always</b> {{been nice}} bonnets, for <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>always</b> become you--or {{you have become}} them; perhaps it was that--at every age.' ...|$|R
500|$|I {{have faith}} in my fans. I believe they will come through for me, because <b>they</b> <b>always</b> <b>have.</b> My house is not {{complete}} without an American Moonman, and I would say 'Touch My Body' deserves one. Brett Ratner directed it, I have a unicorn in there, I have [...] in there — who else has that?" ...|$|E
500|$|The scenes {{featuring}} the Indian airport were filmed at a cruise line terminal in Long Beach, California. Ilt Jones, the location {{manager for the}} series, felt that the [...] "dated feel" [...] of the terminal added to the scene. He noted, [...] "if you look at newsreel footage of India, <b>they</b> <b>always</b> <b>have</b> old English cars from the sixties, the cruise line terminal in Long Beach was perfect." ...|$|E
500|$|... "'Soldier' {{might not}} carry {{with it the}} shock of the new, but it's still a nice little single... The women of Destiny's Child don't sound the {{slightest}} bit convincing singing about how they need thug boyfriends, but they wind their voices around a gorgeous hook exactly as well as <b>they</b> <b>always</b> <b>have.</b> T.I. and Lil Wayne stop by, not saying anything but sounding cool and tough and unflappable doing it. It's pretty good, but don't expect it to set your world on fire." ...|$|E
50|$|In the 1930s, the Tar Hollow {{region was}} {{purchased}} for conservation purposes under a New Deal program, the Ross-Hocking Land Utilization Project. People {{were given a}} new financial start in life and were encouraged {{to move to the}} cities. Most, however, bought more poor ground outside the park and continued to live as <b>they</b> <b>always</b> <b>had.</b>|$|R
50|$|Travel {{during the}} Edo period was {{demanding}} and unsettling for many female samurai (because of heavy restrictions). <b>They</b> <b>always</b> <b>had</b> {{to be accompanied}} by a man, since they were not allowed to travel by themselves. Additionally, they had to possess specific permits, establishing their business and motives. Samurai women also received much harassment from officials who manned inspection checkpoints.|$|R
5000|$|Historians consent that as {{the capital}} ceased to exist, the temples at Angkor {{remained}} as central for the nation as <b>they</b> <b>always</b> <b>had</b> been. David P. Chandler: [...] "The 1747 inscription is the last extensive one at Angkor Wat and reveals {{the importance of the}} temple in Cambodian religious life barely a century before it was [...] "discovered" [...] by the French." ...|$|R
2500|$|Organizationally, we were {{committed}} to a few basic principles: Treat everyone with as much respect as he deserves (and no more), Avoid people who appeal to our vanity or ambition (<b>they</b> <b>always</b> <b>have</b> an angle), Operate {{as much as possible}} apart from the [...] "music scene" [...] (which was never our stomping ground), and Take no shit from anyone in the process.|$|E
2500|$|Characteristic adjectives, which {{refer to}} {{inherent}} states, may {{be derived from}} adjectives which refer to [...] "incidental or temporary states". Characteristic adjectives always use both hands, even if the source adjective only uses one, and <b>they</b> <b>always</b> <b>have</b> repeated, circular movement. Additionally, if the source adjective was one-handed, the derived adjective has alternating movement. [...] "Trilling" [...] may also be used productively to derive adjectives with an [...] "ish" [...] meaning, e.g. BLUE becomes BLUISH.|$|E
2500|$|Water. It's {{necessary}} to sustain life, {{but to many}} Casual Dining restaurant chains it contributes to a dull dining experience for the customer. Many customers choose tap water not because they enjoy it, {{but because it is}} what <b>they</b> <b>always</b> <b>have</b> drunk in the past. In response, some restaurant chains are implementing programs to help train crews to sell alternative choices to tap water, like soft drinks and non-carbonated beverages, with the goal of increasing overall guest satisfaction.|$|E
5000|$|In most episodes, the Dino Babies {{put their}} own imaginative spin on a classic tale, from [...] "Dak and the Beanstalk" [...] to [...] "The Abominable Snowbaby". As fun as these flights of fancy were, <b>they</b> <b>always</b> <b>had</b> {{something}} important {{to say about the}} dinosaurs themselves and the world around them. By acting out classic tales, the dinosaurs learned valuable moral lessons.|$|R
60|$|The jays took no part {{in these}} struggles. Occasionally they cried out a sharp warning as Cheplahgan came {{plunging}} {{down out of the}} blue, over the head of Ismaques; but they seemed to know perfectly how the unequal contest must end, and <b>they</b> <b>always</b> <b>had</b> a deal of jabber among themselves over it, the meaning of which I could never make out.|$|R
50|$|Excepting William Wallace and John de Soulis, {{it seemed}} that all would be forgiven after {{some of the more}} famous leaders were exiled from Scotland for various periods. Forfeited estates could be {{recovered}} by payment of fines levied in amounts deemed appropriate for each individual’s betrayal. Inheritances would continue as <b>they</b> <b>always</b> <b>had,</b> allowing the landed nobility to pass on titles and properties as normal.|$|R
