40|$|AbstractThe Northeastern U. S. has {{the ideal}} {{location}} and {{unique opportunity to}} be a leader in cold water marine finfish aquaculture. However, problems and regulations on environmental issues, mandatory stocking of 100 % native North American salmon, and disease have impacted economic viability of the U. S. salmon industry. In response to these problems, the USDA ARS developed the National Cold Water Marine Aquaculture Center (NCWMAC) in Franklin, Maine. The NCWMAC is adjacent to the University of Maine Center for Cooperative Aquaculture Research on the shore of Taunton Bay and shares essential infrastructure to maximize efficiency. Facilities are used to conduct research on Atlantic salmon and other cold water marine finfish species. The initial research focus for the Franklin location is to develop a comprehensive Atlantic salmon breeding program from native North American fish stocks leading to the development and release of genetically improved salmon to commercial producers. The Franklin location has unique ground water resources to supply freshwater, brackish water, salt water or filtered seawater to fish culture tanks. Research facilities include office space, primary and secondary hygiene rooms, and research <b>tank</b> <b>bays</b> for culturing 200 + Atlantic salmon families with incubation, parr, smolt, on-grow, and broodstock tanks. Tank sizes are 0. 14 m 3 for parr, 9 m 3 for smolts, and 36, 46 and 90 m 3 for subadults and broodfish. Culture tanks are equipped with recirculating systems utilizing biological (fluidized sand) filtration, carbon dioxide stripping, supplemental oxygenation and ozonation, and ultraviolet sterilization. Water from the research facility discharges into a wastewater treatment building and passes through micro-screen drum filtration, an inclined traveling belt screen to exclude all eggs or fish from the discharge, and UV irradiation to disinfect the water. The facility was completed in June 2007, and all water used in the facility has been from groundwater sources. Mean facility discharge has been approximately 0. 50 m 3 /min (130 gpm). The facility was designed for stocking densities of 20 – 47 kg/m 3 and a maximum biomass of 26, 000 kg. The maximum system density obtained from June 2007 through January 2008 has approached 40 kg/m 3, maximum facility biomass was 11, 021 kg, water exchange rates have typically been 2 – 3 % of the recirculating system flow rate, and tank temperatures have ranged from a high of 15. 4 °C in July to a low of 6. 6 °C in January 2008 without supplemental heating or cooling...|$|R

40|$|An area in float {{design that}} has gained {{interest}} {{is the ability to}} transport large payloads in an efficient and persistent manner, on the orders of one ton over a period of many months. Traditional thrusters are unable to perform this mission for a long duration because of their high continuous energy usage. Additionally, the large scientific measurement payloads are traditionally repositioned using a ship. The project 2 ̆ 7 s proposed solution is to design, build and test a variable buoyancy system integrated onto a float whose purpose is to use the oceans currents as its main transport mechanism. ^ The buoyancy system was based on a closed pump-bladder configuration, where hydraulic fluid is pumped from a flexible bladder to rigid pressure tanks to control its buoyancy. After design and construction, initial bench testing was conducted, followed by tank testing in the OCE Acoustics tank and a final bay test in the west passage of Narragansett Bay. Performance characteristics of the float were found to draw an average of 4. 6 W over a 12 hour submergence-surfacing cycle and was able to change its buoyancy by 25 lbs over a 15 minute period. The float was also able to travel approximately 5 nautical miles during the bay test over one ebb tidal cycle. The <b>tank</b> and <b>bay</b> test were successful in proving the concept of the design, though additional work is needed to for the float to overcome its current problems and failures as well as to achieve its longer term goals of obstacle avoidance, persistent operation, and global communications. ...|$|R

5000|$|War Office, 23rd November, 1944.The KING {{has been}} graciously pleased {{to approve the}} posthumous award of the VICTORIA CROSS to: -No. 5057916 Lance-Sergeant John Daniel Baskeyfield, The South Staffordshire- Regiment (1st Airborne Division) (Stoke-on-Trent).On 20 September 1944, {{during the battle of}} Arnhem, Lance-Sergeant Baskeyfield was the N.C.O. in charge of a 6-pounder {{anti-tank}} gun at Oosterbeek. The enemy developed a major attack on this sector with infantry, tanks and self-propelled guns with the obvious intent to break into and overrun the Battalion position. During the early stage of the action the crew commanded by this N.C.O. was responsible for the destruction of two Tiger tanks and at least one self propelled gun, thanks to the coolness and daring of this N.C.O., who, with complete disregard for his own safety, allowed each tank to come well within 100 yards of his gun before opening fire.In the course of this preliminary engagement Lance-Sergeant Baskeyfield was badly wounded in the leg and the remainder of his crew were either killed or badly wounded. During the brief respite after this engagement Lance-Sergeant Baskeyfield refused to be carried to the Regimental Aid Post and spent his time attending to his gun and shouting encouragement to his comrades in neighbouring trenches.After a short interval the enemy renewed the attack with even greater ferocity than before, under cover of intense mortar and shell fire. Manning his gun quite alone Lance-Sergeant Baskeyfield continued to fire round after round at the enemy until his gun was put out of action. By this time his activity was the main factor in keeping the enemy <b>tanks</b> at <b>bay.</b> The fact that the surviving men in his vicinity were held together and kept in action was undoubtedly due to his magnificent example and outstanding courage. Time after time enemy attacks were launched and driven off. Finally, when his gun was knocked out, Lance-Sergeant Baskeyfield crawled under intense enemy fire to another 6-pounder gun nearby, the crew of which had been killed, and proceeded to man it single-handed. With this gun he engaged an enemy self propelled gun which was approaching to attack. Another soldier crawled across the open ground to assist him but was killed almost at once. Lance-Sergeant Baskeyfield succeeded in firing two rounds at the self propelled gun, scoring one direct hit which rendered it ineffective. Whilst preparing to fire a third shot, however, he was killed by a shell from a supporting enemy tank.The superb gallantry of this N.C.O. is beyond praise. During the remaining days at Arnhem stories of his valour were a constant inspiration to all ranks. He spurned danger, ignored pain and, by his supreme fighting spirit, infected all who witnessed his conduct with the same aggressiveness and dogged devotion to duty which characterised his actions throughout.|$|R
