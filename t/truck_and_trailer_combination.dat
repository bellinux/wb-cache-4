50|$|However, {{longer and}} heavier {{combinations}} are regularly seen on public roads; special permits are issued for special cargo. The mining company Boliden AB have a standing special permit for 80 tonne combinations on select routes between mines in the inland and the processing plant in Boliden, taking a 50 tonne load of ore. Volvo {{has a special}} permit for a 32 m, steering B-trailer-trailer combination carrying two 40 ft containers to and from Gothenburg harbour and the Volvo Trucks factory, all {{on the island of}} Hisingen. Another example is the ongoing project En Trave Till (lit. One more pile/stack) started in December 2008. It will allow even longer vehicles to further rationalize the logging transports. As the name of the project points out, {{it will be able to}} carry four stacks of timber, instead of the usual three. The test is limited to Norrbotten county and the European route E4 between the timber terminal in Överkalix and the sawmill in Munksund (outside Piteå). The vehicle is a 30 m long truck trailer combination with a gross weight exceeding 90 tonnes. It is estimated that this will give a 20% lower cost and 20-25% CO2 emissions reduction compared to the regular 60 tonne truck combinations. As the combinations spreads its weight over more axles, braking distance, road wear and traffic safety is believed to be either the same or improved with the 90 tonne truck-trailer. In the same program two types of 74 tonne combinations will be tested in Dalsland and Bohuslän counties in western Sweden: an enhanced <b>truck</b> <b>and</b> <b>trailer</b> <b>combination</b> for use in the forest and a b-double for plain highway transportation to the mill in Skoghall. In 2012, the Northland Mining company received permission for 90 tonne combinations with normal axle load (an extra dolly) for use on the 150 km Kaunisvaara-Svappavaara route, carrying iron ore.|$|E
40|$|The {{challenge}} of designing stability control functions for trucks is to guarantee robustness for all variations in <b>truck</b> <b>and</b> <b>trailer</b> <b>combinations.</b> The method proposed {{in this study}} {{can be used to}} quickly narrow down the number of <b>truck</b> <b>and</b> <b>trailer</b> <b>combinations</b> to a critical set to be evaluated with complex nonlinear simulation software or full-scale tests. To reach this goal, equations of motion are derived for single track linear vehicle models to understand the fundamental differences between the dynamic yaw performance of the <b>truck</b> <b>and</b> <b>trailer</b> <b>combinations.</b> The Hurwitz criterion is used to determine approximate analytical stability boundaries. It is shown that stability does not provide discrimination between combinations as most combinations are stable during normal driving conditions. In contrast, rearward amplification is a discriminatory performance measure. A frequency domain approach is used to study the fundamental differences between vehicle combinations. A comparison with complex nonlinear simulation model results indicates that the proposed method can be used to select critical vehicle combinations and to study the effect of parameter changes. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC...|$|R

40|$|The {{challenge}} of designing stability control function for trucks is to guarantee robustness for {{the variations in}} <b>truck</b> <b>and</b> <b>trailer</b> <b>combinations.</b> The fundamental differences on the dynamic yaw performance of articulated vehicles are studied using the equations of motion. Most truck combinations appear to be mathematically stable during normal driving conditions. Rearward amplification is a more suitable measure to judge the dynamic performance. A frequency domain definition for rearward amplification enables to identify the critical steering frequency input and it better shows the differences in dynamic performance of vehicle combination lay-outs than the conventional lane change approach. It is recommended to use this frequency domain approach to identify critical vehicle combinations when evaluating stability control functions...|$|R
40|$|Many of the {{analytical}} techniques {{that are currently}} available are not capable of analyzing the offtracking of truck and trailer combinations or the path of load overhangs {{through a set of}} curves that are commonly found on forest roads. Advances in the processing speed of microcomputers have made it possible to simulate how a <b>truck</b> <b>and</b> <b>trailer</b> <b>combination</b> negotiate a road. A microcomputer program, OFETRACK, was developed to simulate the offiracking of six different vehicle configurations. The program will enable road designers to predict offtracking through a complex set of road geometrics, including compound and reverse curves. The program will also analyze the path of load overhangs on a vehicle such as a yarder tower on a lowboy or rubber tired undercarriage, Test results of the program compare favorably with several field studies and a scale model simulator. Outputs of the computer simulation are in the form of road widths required left and right of centerline, total width, and curve widening, A plot of the paths of the wheels and load overhang can be viewed on the screen or sent to a drum plotte...|$|E

40|$|Increasing {{volumes of}} road freight {{transport}} necessitate the {{development and use of}} fuel-ecient and economic transport vehicles and solutions. The transition from standard tractor-semitrailer <b>combinations</b> to <b>truck</b> <b>and</b> <b>trailer</b> <b>combinations</b> of gross combination weights upto 74 tons and extending upto 34 metres in length is in eect {{at the time of this}} research. Also, there is growing impetus for hybridisation and complete electrication of medium and heavy duty long haul trucks. Yet, the pertinent problem is the study of the economic and technical feasibility of such hybridisation for longer combinations where there can be several potential axles that can be electrically propelled. The problem is further compounded by the challenges and costs faced in using currently-expensive and heavy batteries and a variety of electric motors. In this thesis, a generic physical modelling of long truck <b>trailer</b> <b>combinations</b> coupled with an energy management algorithm is developed. The energy management is made predictive in nature with prior knowledge of the mission route in order to optimise the use of the electric batteries. The propulsion is 'distributed' so as to allow each trailing unit to be independent, complete with its own battery and axle power distribution management. Thereafter, an object-oriented programming architecture is constructed to implement the vehicle model. The A-Double combination is instantiated and validated against a physical test vehicle performing transport missions along Malmo and Goteborg in south-western Sweden. Independently, a genetic algorithm is implemented on the same platform as the vehicle model. The genotype structures corresponding to each long vehicle combination to be evaluated are developed and custom cross-over and mutation schemes are described and implemented. The algorithm is validated for standard benchmarking functions in two variables and for simple arithmetic functions involving the categorical variables representing the truck-trailer combinations. Several objective functions for the long vehicle combinations are evaluated and a prot maximisation objective is chosen and mathematically formulated. The function parameters are varied to evaluate function sensitivity to each. The genetic algorithm is then used to derive the optimal axle propulsion conguration, battery size and motor rating for the mission specied above, with varying gross combination weights so as to maximise the chosen objective function. Trends in vehicle productivity are calculated over 15 following years from 2015 to 2030 and optimal long combination congurations are derived in intervals of 5 years. Principal contributing factors in each optimal conguration are identied and discussed...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a closed-loop dynamic simulation-based design method for articulated heavy vehicles (AHVs) with active trailer steering (ATS) systems. AHVs have poor manoeuvrability at low speeds and exhibit low lateral stability at high speeds. From the design point of view, {{there exists a}} trade-off relationship between AHVs’ manoeuvrability and stability. For example, fewer articulation points and longer wheelbases will improve high-speed lateral stability, but they will degrade low-speed manoeuvrability. To tackle this conflicting design problem, a systematic method is proposed {{for the design of}} AHVs with ATS systems. In order to evaluate vehicle performance measures under a well-defined testing manoeuvre, a driver model is introduced and it ‘drivers’ the vehicle model to follow a prescribed route at a given speed. Considering the interactions between the mechanical <b>trailer</b> <b>and</b> the ATS system, the proposed design method simultaneously optimises the active design variables of the controllers and passive design variables of the trailer in a single design loop (SDL). Through the design optimisation of an ATS system for an AHV with a <b>truck</b> <b>and</b> a drawbar <b>trailer</b> <b>combination,</b> this SDL method is compared against a published two design loop method. The benchmark investigation shows that the former can determine better trade-off design solutions than those derived by the latter. This SDL method provides an effective approach to automatically implement the design synthesis of AHVs with ATS systems...|$|R
