25|$|ISO/IEC 6937:2001, Information {{technology}} — Coded {{graphic character}} set for <b>text</b> <b>communication</b> — Latin alphabet, is a multibyte extension of ASCII, or rather of ISO/IEC 646-IRV. It {{was developed in}} common with ITU-T (then CCITT) for telematic services {{under the name of}} T.51, and first became an ISO standard in 1983. Certain byte codes are used as lead bytes for letters with diacritics (accents). The value of the lead byte often indicates which diacritic that the letter has, and the follow byte then has the ASCII-value for the letter that the diacritic is on. Only certain combinations of lead byte and follow byte are allowed, and there are some exceptions to the lead byte interpretation for some follow bytes. However, that no combining characters at all are encoded in ISO/IEC 6937. But one can represent some free-standing diacritics, often by letting the follow byte have the code for ASCII space.|$|E

40|$|The <b>text</b> message <b>communication</b> {{system is}} one modern {{electronic}} medium of communication that is systematically transforming written communication. It has both {{the positive and}} the negative sides just {{like that of the}} electricity current. The positive side of the <b>text</b> message <b>communication</b> simply refers to its pros, that is, its advantages, merits or benefits. The negative side of the <b>text</b> message <b>communication</b> refers to its cons, that is, its disadvantages, demerits or shortcomings. This paper explores the pros of <b>text</b> message <b>communication</b> by analysing how it saves time, reduces cost, aids articulate feedback, ensures convenient response, serves as legal evidence, encourages bold reply, functions as a forensic tool, represents a more health-friendly medium and guarantees confidentiality. The paper equally examines the cons of <b>text</b> message <b>communication</b> by explicating how it can aid crime, be used to defraud, implicate message sender when not deleted, be vague/ambiguous because of its abbreviated language, be delivered late when events have overtaken message sent, be reduced in length and rendered incomplete when message is lengthy, be limited in use to literate people only, be used to perpetrate examination malpractices and be responded to late when the receiver has a busy or tight schedule...|$|R

Both a questionnaire, interviews and document analysis was used at a “Samordningsförbund” where the study was performed.

50|$|Even today, the {{negative}} social {{effects of a}} technological utopia can be seen. Mediated communication such as phone calls, instant messaging and text messaging are steps towards a utopian world in which one can easily contact another regardless of time or location. However, mediated communication removes many aspects that are helpful in transferring messages. As it stands today, most text, email, and instant messages offer fewer nonverbal cues about the speaker’s feelings than do face-to-face encounters. This makes it so that mediated communication can easily be misconstrued and the intended message is not properly conveyed. With the absence of tone, body language, and environmental context, {{the chance of a}} misunderstanding is much higher, rendering the communication ineffective. In fact, mediated technology can be seen from a dystopian view because it can be detrimental to effective interpersonal communication. These criticisms would only apply to messages that are prone to misinterpretation as not every <b>text</b> based <b>communication</b> requires contextual cues. The limitations of lacking tone and body language in <b>text</b> based <b>communication</b> are likely to be mitigated by video and augmented reality versions of digital communication technologies.|$|R
