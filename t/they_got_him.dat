500|$|During {{the initial}} {{recording}} sessions, D'Angelo {{also worked with}} personal trainer Mark Jenkins, who was hired {{to help him get}} into shape. As Questlove recounted, [...] "Money was definitely overweight by '96, so <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>him</b> a drill sergeant physical trainer Mark Jenkins. This guy didn't take no shit. I cannot see D running in Central Park, but he did [...] Push-ups, weight room, sparring every day for three hours. He wouldn't take no shit." ...|$|E
500|$|The judge heard out the owners; after expressing initial reluctance, he {{took the}} job for seven years at a salary of $50,000, on {{condition}} he could remain on the federal bench. During Landis's time serving as both judge and commissioner, he allowed a $7,500 reduction in his salary as commissioner, to reflect his pay as judge. The appointment of Landis was met with acclaim in the press. [...] A tentative agreement was signed by the parties a month later—an agreement which itemized Landis's powers over baseball, and which was drafted by the judge. [...] The owners were {{still reeling from the}} perception that baseball was crooked, and accepted the agreement virtually without dissent. [...] Under the terms of the contract, Landis could not be dismissed by the team owners, have his pay reduced, or even be criticized by them in public. He also had nearly unlimited authority over every person employed in the major or minor leagues, from owners to batboys. [...] The owners waived any recourse to the courts to contest Landis's will. Humorist Will Rogers stated, [...] "on't kid yourself that that old judicial bird isn't going to make those baseball birds walk the chalkline". [...] Player and manager Leo Durocher later stated, [...] "The legend has been spread that the owners hired the Judge off the federal bench. Don't you believe it. <b>They</b> <b>got</b> <b>him</b> right out of Dickens." ...|$|E
500|$|One {{kilometre}} {{from the}} summit, Simpson fell off his bike. Taylor and Hall {{arrived in the}} team car to help him. Hall tried to persuade Simpson to stop when he fell, saying, [...] "Come on Tom, that's it, that's your Tour finished." [...] But Simpson {{said he wanted to}} go on. Taylor was informed and said, [...] "If Tom, wants to go on, he goes." [...] Noticing that his toe straps were still undone, Simpson said, [...] "Me straps, Harry, me straps!" [...] <b>They</b> <b>got</b> <b>him</b> on his bike and pushed him off. Simpson's last words, as remembered by Hall, were 'On, on, on.' The words 'Put me back on my bike!' were invented by Sid Saltmarsh, covering the event for The Sun and Cycling– now Cycling Weekly. Saltmarsh was not there at the time and was in a reception black-spot for live accounts on Radio Tour. Simpson managed to ride a further [...] before he began to wobble. He was held upright by three spectators who then helped him to the ground on side of the road. He was unconscious with his hands locked to the handlebars. Hall shouted for the other mechanic, Ken Ryall, to pry them loose and the pair laid the lifeless Simpson beside the road. Hall and a nurse from the Tour's medical team took turns giving Simpson mouth-to-mouth resuscitation before Dumas came with an oxygen mask.|$|E

500|$|As {{the race}} reached the lower slopes of Ventoux, Simpson's team {{mechanic}} Harry Hall, witnessed Simpson, still ill, putting the lid {{back on his}} water bottle as he exited a building. Race commissaire (official), Jacques Lohmuller, later confirmed to Hall that he also saw the incident and that Simpson was putting brandy in his bottle. Near the summit of Ventoux, the peloton began to fracture. Simpson was in the front group before slipping back {{to a group of}} chasers about a minute behind. He then began losing control of his bike, zig-zagging across the road. A kilometre from the summit, Simpson fell off his bike. Team manager Alec Taylor and Hall arrived in the team car to help him. Hall tried to persuade Simpson to stop, saying: [...] "Come on Tom, that's it, that's your Tour finished", but Simpson said he wanted to continue. Taylor said, [...] "If Tom wants to go on, he goes". Noticing his toe straps were still undone, Simpson said, [...] "Me straps, Harry, me straps!" [...] <b>They</b> <b>got</b> <b>him</b> on his bike and pushed him off. Simpson's last words, as remembered by Hall, were [...] "On, on, on." [...] Hall estimated Simpson rode a further [...] before he began to wobble, and was held upright by spectators; he was unconscious, with his hands locked on the handlebars. Hall and a nurse from the Tour's medical team took turns giving Simpson mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, before Dumas arrived with an oxygen mask. Approximately forty minutes after his collapse, a police helicopter took Simpson to nearby Avignon hospital, where he was pronounced dead at 5:40p.m. Two empty tubes and a half-full one of amphetamines, one of which was labelled [...] "Tonedron", were found in the rear pocket of his jersey. The official cause of death was [...] "heart failure caused by exhaustion." ...|$|E
