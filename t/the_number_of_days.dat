5|$|The {{point at}} which Mars's geocentric {{longitude}} is 180° different from the Sun's is known as opposition, which is near the time of closest approach to Earth. The time of opposition can occur as much as 8.5 days away from the closest approach.

The undetected destruction of a couple of the sticks in the Natchez Grand Village derailed the count, although the reason for the lost sticks differed in each historian's account.

40|$|An electrophoretically pure {{preparation}} of natural human interleukin- 1 (IL- 1) {{was shown to}} stimulate in vitro colony formation in human bone marrow cultures. Day 4 myeloid cluster-forming cells (CFC), as well as early (day 7) and late (day 10) granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming units (CFU-GM) were stimulated in a dose-dependent fashion. At optimal concentrations <b>of</b> IL- 1, <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>day</b> 4 CFC reached 72 %, <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>day</b> 7 CFU-GM reached 32 %, and <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>day</b> 10 CFU-GM reached 80 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> respective <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> colonies obtained by addition of crude leukocyte-conditioned medium (LCM). The IL- 1 -induced stimulatory effect on CFU-GM growth could be completely neutralized by a rabbit anti-IL- 1 antiserum. Colony growth was abrogated by depleting the marrow cell suspensions of phagocytic cells prior to IL- 1 addition. Conversely, the effect could be reintroduced by addition of marrow-derived adherent cells to bone marrow cell suspensions that had been depleted of both phagocytic and E rosetting T cells. Furthermore, media conditioned by bone marrow-derived adherent cells or by peripheral blood mononuclear phagocytes in the presence {{but not in the}} absence of IL- 1, stimulated in vitro colony growth of phagocyte-depleted bone marrow cell suspensions.

25|$|In {{the late}} 1830s, the U.S. Navy sought wind and current {{information}} for {{areas of the}} oceans outside the trade routes regularly traveled by merchant ships. The principal mariners who ventured away from the main trade routes were whalers. One of the U.S.'s first oceanographers, Naval Captain Matthew Fontaine Maury, entered into an agreement with deal with the American pelagic whalers. If they provided him with their logbooks, from which he could extract wind and current information, he would in return prepare maps for them showing where whales were most concentrated. Between 1840 and 1843, Maury and his staff processed over 2,000 whaling logbooks and produced not only the famous Wind and Current Charts used by mariners for over a century, but also a series of Whale Charts. The most detailed showed by month and 5° of latitude and longitude: (a) <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>days</b> on which whaling ships were in that sector; (b) <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>days</b> on which they saw right whales; and (c) <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>days</b> on which the saw sperm whales. In the North Pacific, these charts summarize more than 8,000 days on which the whalers encountered right whales and the searching effort by month and sector. The maps thus provide a crude measure of the relative abundance of right whales by geographic sector and month, controlled for the very non-random searching effort of the whalers.|$|E
