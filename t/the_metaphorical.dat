5|$|The museum {{enjoyed a}} {{successful}} first year, {{with an initial}} target of 300,000visitors surpassed after six months, with over 100,000visitors {{in the first six}} weeks; by the museum's first anniversary on 5 July 2003 some 470,000visitors had been received. The museum won the Building Award in the 2003 British Construction Industry Awards, and was shortlisted for the 2004 Stirling Prize. The museum received a largely positive critical reception, with reviewers remarking on <b>the</b> <b>metaphorical</b> power of the building, the complementary effects of the museum's main exhibition with its internal architecture, and the economy with which the museum was built. In August 2005 Imperial War Museum North received its millionth visitor. The museum was, however, criticised in 2008 by The Guardian for poor energy efficiency, as part of a report into the carbon dioxide emissions of UK public buildings.|$|E
5|$|Hurt by Whatsername's departure, Johnny {{longs for}} better days ahead, Tunny longs for home, and Will longs {{for all the}} things he's lost ("Wake Me Up When September Ends"). St. Jimmy appears and makes one last attempt to get Johnny's attention, but that part of Johnny has died, {{resulting}} in <b>the</b> <b>metaphorical</b> suicide of St. Jimmy ("The Death of St. Jimmy"). Johnny cleans up and gets a desk job but soon realizes {{there is no place}} for him in the city ("East 12th Street"). Will, all alone with his television, bemoans his outcast state ("Nobody Likes You"). As he finally gets up off the couch, Heather appears with her new show-off rockstar boyfriend ("Rock and Roll Girlfriend"). Will heads to the 7-Eleven to get away from them and, surprisingly, finds Johnny there. Johnny had sold his guitar for a bus ticket home. Tunny returns from the war zone (as an amputee) with the Extraordinary Girl. As Tunny introduces his friends to the Extraordinary Girl, Johnny becomes furious with him for leaving the group, but quickly forgives him and the three friends embrace. Heather and her boyfriend arrive. In an uneasy truce, she gives the baby to Will. Other friends show up to greet the three men they haven't seen in a year ("We're Coming Home Again"). One year later, Johnny laments that he lost the love of his life, but he accepts that he can live inside the struggle between rage and love that has defined his life. With this acceptance comes the possibility of hope ("Whatsername").|$|E

5|$|Tychus J. Findlay is {{a marine}} and past {{associate}} of Raynor's who becomes {{affiliated with the}} Raiders. He appears in the novel Heaven's Devil and in Wings of Liberty {{as one of the}} main characters. Findlay is known for his charisma and toughness, and by his friendship with James Raynor. He is voiced by Neil Kaplan. Findlay is introduced in the cinematic trailer for StarCraft II, in which he is shown being encased into powered combat armour. According to Blizzard's Nick Carpenter, the marine in the trailer lacked any identity but eventually evolved into Findlay, allowing the cinematic team to flesh out the trailer with the character's personality. Findlay is surrounded by rumours regarding his reputation; on the one hand, he is held as a loyal soldier who risks his life to save his comrades, while on the other, he is regarded as an amoral scoundrel. Findlay and Raynor fought together for the Confederacy several years prior to the events of StarCraft before becoming outlaws; Findlay was eventually captured and incarcerated. By Wings of Liberty, Findlay escapes from prison, tracks down Raynor, and recruits him to work for the secretive Moebius Foundation, where, according to Metzen, Findlay acts as <b>the</b> <b>metaphorical</b> devil on Raynor's shoulder.|$|E

25|$|Jehovah's Witnesses {{hold that}} the soul ceases to exist {{when the person}} dies and {{therefore}} that Hell (Sheol or Hades) {{is a state of}} non-existence. In their theology, Gehenna differs from Sheol or Hades in that it holds no hope of a resurrection. Tartarus is held to be <b>the</b> <b>metaphorical</b> state of debasement of the fallen angels between the time of their moral fall (Genesis chapter 6) until their post-millennial destruction along with Satan (Revelation chapter 20).|$|E
25|$|Beginning of the End made Bert I. Gordon {{famous for}} his giant monster films. Critics and film historians {{point out that the}} film {{is only one of many}} which drew heavily on most Americans' fear about atomic weapons, open-air nuclear tests, and the {{possibility}} of nuclear war. However, Beginning of the End had very little of <b>the</b> <b>metaphorical</b> creativity of films such as Godzilla or Them! A more recent assessment, however, concludes that the film taps more deeply into 1950s Americans' worries over invasive species and growing unease over pesticides (like DDT).|$|E

25|$|Updike is {{a master}} of {{effortless}} motion—between third and first person, from <b>the</b> <b>metaphorical</b> density of literary prose to the demotic, from specific detail to wide generalisation, from the actual to the numinous, from the scary to the comic. For his own particular purposes, Updike devised for himself a style of narration, an intense, present tense, free indirect style, that can leap up, whenever it wants, to a God's-eye view of Harry, or the view of his put-upon wife, Janice, or victimised son, Nelson. This carefully crafted artifice permits here assumptions about evolutionary theory, which are more Updike than Harry, and comically sweeping notions of Jewry, which are more Harry than Updike.|$|E
500|$|In Hinduism, {{the shape}} of the bird in flight was thought to {{resemble}} a bow, with the long bill as an arrow.

500|$|The final four-part chorale, [...] "" [...] (Come, o death, {{brother of}} sleep), with the {{orchestra}} doubling the vocal parts, {{is regarded as}} an inspired masterpiece.

500|$|Banks {{describes}} the track as genre-specific, citing pop-crossover and UK garage. On the song's lyrical content, she explained, [...] "It's about the journey, the breakup {{is a part}} of it, but it's really about the journey". She went on to describe how the song fits into a larger puzzle of the album in which the album's opening track, [...] "Idle Deliah", is <b>the</b> <b>metaphorical</b> morning, and later tracks on the album, including [...] "Chasing Time" [...] are representative of later in the evening.|$|E

The Sunday Times covered the Red Star article {{the next day and}} Thatcher embraced the [...] a week later; in a speech to Finchley Conservatives she compared it to the Duke of Wellington's nickname [...] "The Iron Duke". <b>The</b> <b>metaphorical</b> sobriquet followed her throughout her political career, and has since become a generic descriptor for strong-willed female politicians.|$|E

500|$|Steve Lowe {{called the}} song [...] "penetrating surgery on pseudo-meaningful corporations' lifestyles" [...] with [...] "a repugnance for {{prevailing}} yuppified social values".

[...] Sam Steele called the lyrics [...] "a stream of received imagery: scraps of media information, interspersed with lifestyle ad slogans and private prayers for a healthier existence.

500|$|Bono {{stated that}} the setlist was divided into two acts and a coda.

[...] The remix version of [...] "I'll Go Crazy If I Don't Go Crazy Tonight" [...] was created by the music team Fish out of Water as a mashup of previous remixes by Redanka and Dirty South. [...] The [...] "I'll Go Crazy" [...] remix is intended to disorient the audience as the band moves into the second act, [...] "Sunday Bloody Sunday" [...] to the encore, which focuses more on the political aspect of Bono's persona, where he [...] " [...] with the problems of the wider world."

500|$|Many of {{the images}} connect back to his earlier works. The images of life as boat adrift with a leak {{is similar to the}} [...] "Death by Water" [...] section of The Waste Land.

Men are supposed to progress, but they aren't supposed to focus on what they can gain in the future. The prayer to the Virgin Mary is intended to help guide the journey which would end with understanding eternity and the Annunciation. It is Mary who will guide <b>the</b> <b>metaphorical</b> sailors to their proper harbour.
