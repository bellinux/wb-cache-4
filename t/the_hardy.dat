While Jeff and Nitro continued battling over the Intercontinental Championship on Raw, Matt and Mercury feuded on SmackDown!. Mercury and Nitro tried injuring both Hardys' faces as payback for what happened at Armageddon, claiming that <b>The</b> <b>Hardys</b> had ruined Mercury's 'Hollywood good looks'. <b>The</b> <b>Hardys</b> settled their feud with MNM at the Royal Rumble when they defeated them for the second time.
