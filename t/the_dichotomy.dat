The rain-heavy clouds swirling ominously around each celestial entity are separated by a gulf of calmness, intensifying the contrast and infusing the heavens with an unearthly glow. Light from the sky spills onto the landscape: while the western continent and the Nile are bathed in the sun's light, the east and the Tower of Babel are cloaked in shadow.|$|E
5|$|Christianity {{led to the}} {{development}} of a few phenomena characteristic of Byzantium. Namely, the intimate connection between Church and State, a legacy of Roman cultus. Also, the creation of a Christian philosophy that guided Byzantine Greeks in their everyday lives. And finally, <b>the</b> <b>dichotomy</b> between the Christian ideals of the Bible and classical Greek paideia which could not be left out, however, since so much of Christian scholarship and philosophy depended on it. These shaped Byzantine Greek character and the perceptions of themselves and others.|$|E
40|$|It is {{the purpose}} of this thesis to examine {{systematically}} the theories of selected sociologists and anthropologists with the end in view of determining whether or not or to what degree <b>the</b> various <b>dichotomies</b> are valid and useful. In addition to specific criticisms of doctrines peculiar to individual theorists, an attempt will be made to answer the following questions: What are the theoretical sources from which <b>the</b> <b>dichotomies</b> of types of social life in modern sociological and anthropological theory are derived? Are <b>the</b> <b>dichotomies</b> based upon legitimate contrasts which can be demonstrated empirically? To what extent do the value orientations of the theorists bias their results? How valuable are <b>the</b> <b>dichotomies</b> as guides to empirical investigation? To what extent do the dichotomous theories contribute {{to an understanding of the}} causes and directions of social change...|$|R
40|$|<b>The</b> three <b>dichotomies</b> model, first {{proposed}} in Hunt (1976), restricts marketing science {{to the positive}} half of <b>the</b> positive-normative <b>dichotomy.</b> We argue that the "necessity challenge " of <b>the</b> positive-normative <b>dichotomy</b> in Robin (1977) stands, and that the positive half of <b>the</b> positive-normative <b>dichotomy</b> is virtually empty {{if all of the}} normative terms are removed. Thus marketing, as currently conceived, is not a positive science...|$|R

5|$|The head {{offering}} {{and subsequent}} {{restoration of the}} head signify immortality. <b>The</b> <b>dichotomy</b> of temporality and immortality is alluded to by the blood stream drunk by Chhinnamasta's head– interpreted as amrita and the serpent, which sheds its skin without dying. The skull and severed head garlands signify her victory over Time and fear of Death. Chhinnamasta's black complexion denotes destruction; her depiction as red or orange denotes life. By drinking the blood, she appears as the Saviour, who drinks the negativity {{of the world and}} transforms it to benevolent energies; in this interpretation, the blood is seen in negative light rather than amrita.|$|E
5|$|The {{programme}} {{of urban}} renewal under Augustus, {{and the growth}} of Rome's population to as many as 1 million people, was accompanied by a nostalgia for rural life expressed in the arts. Poetry praised the idealized lives of farmers and shepherds. The interiors of houses were often decorated with painted gardens, fountains, landscapes, vegetative ornament, and animals, especially birds and marine life, rendered accurately enough that modern scholars can sometimes identify them by species. The Augustan poet Horace gently satirized <b>the</b> <b>dichotomy</b> of urban and rural values in his fable of the city mouse and the country mouse, which has often been retold as a children's story.|$|E

50|$|Jacques Derrida (1930-2004) {{developed}} deconstruction as {{a response}} to structuralism. Deconstruction takes a text, examines binary oppositions within it from several different interpreting standpoints, and then attempts to show them to be dependent upon one another, unstable, ambiguous and historically and culturally defined. Through showing the fluidity of <b>the</b> <b>dichotomies,</b> deconstruction shows <b>the</b> fluidity of the text. Derrida maintained that no meaning is stable, not even <b>the</b> <b>dichotomies</b> classical philosophers took for granted. Through an internal logic, the text deconstructs itself and hence allows highly original interpretations.|$|R
25|$|This {{argument}} is called <b>the</b> <b>Dichotomy</b> {{because it involves}} repeatedly splitting a distance into two parts. It contains {{some of the same}} elements as the Achilles and the Tortoise paradox, but with a more apparent conclusion of motionlessness. It is also known as the Race Course paradox. Some, like Aristotle, regard <b>the</b> <b>Dichotomy</b> as really just another version of Achilles and the Tortoise.|$|E

50|$|The {{last chapter}} proposes dialogics as an {{instrument}} to free the colonized, {{through the use of}} cooperation, unity, organization and cultural synthesis (overcoming problems in society to liberate human beings). This is in contrast to antidialogics which use conquest, manipulation, cultural invasion, and the concept of divide and rule. Freire suggests that populist dialogue is a necessity to revolution; that impeding dialogue dehumanizes and supports the status quo. This is but one example of <b>the</b> <b>dichotomies</b> Freire identifies in the book. Others include <b>the</b> student-teacher <b>dichotomy</b> and <b>the</b> colonizer-colonized <b>dichotomy.</b>|$|R

40|$|The paper {{focuses on}} H.

25|$|There are two {{versions}} of <b>the</b> <b>dichotomy</b> paradox. In the other version, before Homer could {{reach the end of}} the path, he must reach half of the distance to it. Before reaching the last half, he must complete the next quarter of the distance. Reaching the next quarter, he must then cover the next eighth of the distance, then the next sixteenth, and so on. There are thus an infinite number of steps that must first be accomplished before he could reach the end of the path. Expressed this way, <b>the</b> <b>dichotomy</b> paradox is very much analogous to that of Achilles and the tortoise.|$|E
