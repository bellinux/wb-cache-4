The special, which starred Lauren Conrad, took a look back at the events that happened on The Hills and also focused on what Conrad was doing now. It aired on MTV on August 2, 2016.|$|E
5|$|The {{same basic}} {{procedure}} {{was used by}} all of the above-mentioned psychologists. A participant makes a judgment about some particular issue. At a later time, they judge the same problem again but with information of how certain groups or prestigious people have evaluated the same problem. If the subject changes his judgment {{in the same direction as}} the evaluations of these groups of people or prestigious people, <b>then</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> considered a degree of influence that they have exerted on the participant's judgment.|$|E

In television, two episodes of Route 66 were shot in Minneapolis in 1963 (and broadcast in 1963 and 1964). The 1970s CBS situation comedy fictionally based in Minneapolis, The Mary Tyler Moore Show, won three Golden Globes and 31 Emmy Awards.|$|E
5|$|Hinton {{followed}} the advice {{given to her}} and wrote her second novel, That Was <b>Then,</b> <b>This</b> <b>Is</b> Now in 1971. Following that, she wrote her shortest novel, Rumble Fish; {{it was published in}} 1975 after she had published a short story version in a 1968 edition of University of Tulsa's Alumni Magazine. Four years later in 1979, Tex was published and would be Hinton's last book for nine years as she devoted her time to raise her child. Hinton's next novel Taming the Star Runner was her first book that wasn't written in first-person point of view. Seven years after Taming the Star Runner, Hinton released her first children's book, Big David, Little David, which followed with the release of The Puppy Sister in 1995. In 2004, Hawkes Harbor, Hinton's first adult novel, was released. Hinton's most recent book, Some of Tim's Stories, was published in 2007 and is Hinton's third children's book. Overall, Hinton has written nine published books.|$|E

25|$|A forced {{marriage}} {{qualifies as a}} form of human trafficking in certain situations. If a woman is sent abroad, forced into the marriage and then repeatedly compelled to engage in sexual conduct with her new husband, then her experience is that of sex trafficking.
