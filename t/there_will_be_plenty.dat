25|$|The {{ruling is}} controversial. Representatives of the US ethanol {{industry}} complained that this rule overstates the {{environmental effects of}} corn ethanol, and also criticized the inclusion of indirect effects of land-use changes as an unfair penalty to home-made corn ethanol because deforestation {{in the developing world}} is being tied to US ethanol production. The initial reference value set for 2011 for LCFS means that Mid-west corn ethanol will not meet the California standard unless current carbon intensity is reduced. Oil industry representatives complained that there is a cost associated to the new standard, as the LCFS will limit the use of corn ethanol blended in gasoline, thus leaving oil refiners with few available and viable options, such as sugarcane ethanol from Brazil, but this option means paying costly U.S. import tariffs. CARB officials and environmentalists reject such scenario because they think <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>plenty</b> of time and economic incentive to developed inexpensive biofuels, hydrogen-based fuels, even ethanol from such cellulosic materials, or new ways to make ethanol out of corn with a smaller carbon footprint.|$|E

At the SF Site, Steven H Silver observed that the book's parodying of action films is [...] "masterful", and commended Pratchett for how [...] "fresh" [...] the humor was—while conceding that [...] "reader(s) may not laugh out loud ... but <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>plenty</b> of internal chuckling".|$|E

2500|$|Wyndham's {{performance}} was praised, {{and the play}} must have generated considerable interest: [...] On 24 December, the drama critic of The Illustrated London News had not yet seen the play, but had heard that the play was [...] "brilliantly successful, and will probably have a very long run; so <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>plenty</b> of time to criticise it at leisure after the feverish pantomimic Boxing-Night week.

2500|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began on}} May 18, 2015, shooting on locations in Bulgaria. The Bulgaria location {{was used for}} budgetary reasons, as Millennium Films had a studio in the area. To accommodate the 1960s era in which the film is set, cars modeled after that of the period {{were sent to the}} filming areas. Sites were also chosen for an aesthetic of wild, open fields and scrubs that resemble the Texas landscape. Seth M. Sherwood likened the film's visual style to that of an art film, comparing it to [...] "Badlands with gore". In addition to the brutal murders in the screenplay, additional kills were inserted by directors Bustillo and Maury during filming, with the creation of Leatherface's first flesh-mask cited by Sherwood as his personal favourite. Practical effects were primarily used to bring the killings, corpses, and gore to life; much of the budget was spent on building a realistic cow carcass. The crew utilised computer-generated imagery as necessary, albeit to a much lesser extent. Leatherface was made intentionally graphic in response to fan criticisms of Texas Chainsaw 3D lacking sufficient violence. Lati Globman said on the matter, [...] "Gore is not always the point in horror movies, although <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>plenty,</b> it needs to be psychologically challenging and twisted." [...] While five of the TCM franchise's seven films have been shot in Texas, one in California and one in Louisiana, Bulgarian filming marks the first time one was been shot outside the United States. Filming continued through June 2015, lasting a sum of twenty-seven days.|$|E

Ten years ago I started writing about my theory that, wittingly or unwittingly, the Fed has become the quartermaster general of the coming deflation and depression.

My argument {{had to do with the}} contention that the open market operations of the Fed make bond speculation risk-free, which explains the perpetual bull market in bonds. Bond speculators, knowing that the Fed must needs buy bonds in order to keep the money supply growing, front-run (or, to use the old-fashioned term: pre-empt) the Fed’s open market operations. They buy the bonds beforehand, and pocket risk-free profits when they sell them to the Fed. Speculators will allow the bond price to fall only so much.

40|$|People with {{dementia}} are {{often described as}} 'hard to reach' by service providers and practitioners, {{as well as people}} in the research community, who {{do not know how to}} go about engaging them. Recently, people {{with dementia}} themselves have started speaking up through groups like DEEP (the Dementia Engagement and Empowerment Project) and demonstrating that, far from being hard to reach, many people with dementia want to be heard.

As people with dementia are occupying an increasing proportion of the social care caseload - how can social workers overcome communication barriers (perceived and experienced) and support people with dementia to play an active role in their own care planning, as well as wider service development and improvement?

In the autobiographical Palm Sunday, author Kurt Vonnegut reports being invited to preach on Palm Sunday in 1980, and chooses for his text the Gospel of John's version of the anointing.

I felt it impolite to have the least appearance of pocketing a slight; the times had been too difficult, and were still too doubtful; and Queen Victoria's son was bound to maintain the honour of his house. Karaiti was accordingly summoned that evening to the Ricks, where Mrs. Rick fell foul of him in words, and Queen Victoria's son assailed him with indignant looks. I was the ass with the lion's skin; I could not roar {{in the language of the}} Gilbert Islands; but I could stare. Karaiti declared he had meant no offence; apologised in a sound, hearty, gentlemanly manner; and became at once at his ease. He had in a dagger to examine, and announced he would come to price it on the morrow, to-day being Sunday; this nicety in a heathen with eight wives surprised me. The dagger was [...] "good for killing fish," [...] he said roguishly; and was supposed to have his eye upon fish upon two legs. It is at least odd that in Eastern Polynesia fish was the accepted euphemism for the human sacrifice. Asked as to the population of his island, Karaiti called out to his vassals who sat waiting him outside the door, and they put it at four hundred and fifty; but (added Karaiti jovially) <b>there</b> <b>will</b> soon <b>be</b> <b>plenty</b> more, for all the women are in the family way. Long before we separated I had quite forgotten his offence. He, however, still bore it in mind; and with a very courteous inspiration returned early on the next day, paid us a long visit, and punctiliously said farewell when he departed.|$|R
