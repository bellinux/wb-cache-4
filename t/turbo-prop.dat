5|$|As the new {{residential}} area suffered from aircraft noise, residents {{joined in the}} demand that the airport be relocated. Despite this, the number of flights to the airport increased as the newly formed Israel Airports Authority strived to reduce congestion at Ben Gurion Airport by shifting all domestic <b>turbo-prop</b> flights to Sde Dov. Once again, the only feasible alternative proposed at this point was to build a runway in the sea and again, {{the high cost of}} this project meant that it never happened. This was a large issue in the area during the whole of the 1980s.|$|E
25|$|The city {{is served}} by Red Deer Regional Airport, which serves mostly general aviation, but also a small {{commuter}} airline, along with Air Canada Express. Scheduled <b>turbo-prop</b> service is available to Calgary, Kelowna, Edmonton, Grande Prairie and Fort McMurray.|$|E
25|$|From 1993 to 2002, {{the company}} solely {{operated}} Fokker F-50 <b>turbo-prop</b> aircraft {{primarily as a}} commuter airline, having a total fleet of six in 2002. The company ceased all F-50 operations {{at the end of}} 2003 in order to focus on the Boeing 737-300 jet operations and sold the last three of the Fokker F-50 in early 2004.|$|E
50|$|Latin Carga was a Venezuelan cargo airline. Most of the airline's {{aircraft}} {{were small}} <b>turbo-props,</b> however, it obtained 2 used Convair CV-880 airliners, {{including the one}} that crashed on this incident and which had begun its commercial airline career flying for Delta Air Lines.|$|R
5000|$|Capitan de Corbeta Carlos A. Curbelo International Airport {{can handle}} many {{different}} types of jets including wide-bodies, although usually, mid-size jets like the Boeing 737 and Airbus 320, and <b>turbo-props</b> like the ATR-42 are used in this airport, which complements a [...] "department" [...] airport also located around Punta del Este.|$|R

25|$|While the {{designed}} {{empty weight}} of the aircraft is around 4,125kg, the first prototype weighed in around 5,118kg. This issue is sought {{to be addressed by}} including composite wings and tail by the third prototype. The airframe of Saras-PT2 was built with lighter composites to reduce its overall weight by about 400kg from its first prototype, which was overweight by about 900kg. The aircraft is powered by two Canadian Pratt & Whitney <b>turbo-prop</b> engines mounted in the pusher configuration.|$|E
25|$|The week of 1 April 1957 a Lockheed C-130 Hercules {{from the}} Air Force Operational Test Center at Eglin Air Force Base {{became the first}} <b>turbo-prop</b> {{aircraft}} to carry U.S. mail across the Atlantic. The C-130 {{was on its way}} to Evreux, France, where it was to be put through another phase of Employment and Suitability Testing by AFOTC. Stopping at Dover, Delaware, on the first leg of the Atlantic crossing, the Hercules took on 4,800 pounds of mail for servicemen overseas.|$|E
50|$|This {{airport is}} mainly {{operated}} by general aviation aircraft, Flight Training Organizations and flying clubs. Due to the runway length and surrounding buildings {{it is only}} possible to operate helicopters, piston engine aircraft, medium size <b>turbo-props</b> and small business jets. Also, {{due to the lack}} of IFR facilities, but an old NDB (CVT), it is only possible to operate VFR flights. Nevertheless, it is the headquarters airport of several FTOs, including some of the major Spanish ones as Gestair Flying Academy, Aerotec, Aerofan and others.|$|R
50|$|A {{joint venture}} with Qantas followed, and then Solomon Airlines entered the jet age by leasing a Boeing 737 from Air Pacific. Solomon Airlines and Air Pacific soon also made a joint venture, but when Air Pacific {{announced}} in 1989 it was planning to substitute its Boeing 737 with a Boeing 767 to upgrade international services, Solomon Airlines was forced to lease one from another company, and so it decided on leasing a 737 owned by International Lease Finance Corporation. Since then, the airline has operated with leased 737s alongside its own <b>turbo-props.</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{compares the}} {{regional}} airline industry in Europe and North America {{and through a}} combination of data analysis and case-studies investigates some of the current changes that are taking place. North American regionals are shown to have longer stage lengths, lower unit costs and higher load factors than their European counterparts. <b>Turbo-props</b> remain popular in Europe but 50 seat jets dominate in the United States. The bankruptcy of most US legacy carriers has led to renegotiation of contracts for regional flying, with prices being driven down. European regionals face different problems with rail competition, capacity constraints at hub airports and incursion by low-cost airlines. The differences in the cost structures of BA Connect, British Airways' former regional arm and flybe, operating a new hybrid format, are interpreted and it is shown that flybe has much lower labour costs. A number of alternative business models are then discussed. In the US the most popular is the sale of capacity to the majors, whereas in Europe many operate on a quasi-independent franchise basis. It is concluded that European regionals require more action to reduce costs while US regionals will increasingly have to take more of the risk from their major carrier partners. A renewed enthusiasm for <b>turbo-props</b> on short sectors is becoming apparent, while the European markets in particular are likely to see a shift to larger aircraft at lower frequency. This puts at risk the schedule convenience and network connections valued by business passengers...|$|R
25|$|In July 2002, AirAsia began {{flying from}} KLIA, and in 2004, AirAsia {{considered}} utilising the airport {{as a primary}} hub in Malaysia. However, the plan was rejected and the Malaysian government now plans to turn the airport into an international conference centre. Since Firefly started operations in the airport, AirAsia has been lobbying the government to allow AirAsia to use Subang Airport. As of December 2007, the government still maintains its policy of only allowing general aviation and <b>turbo-prop</b> flights out of Subang Airport.|$|E
25|$|While STOL {{was not yet}} {{operating}}, Voyageur Airways had quietly begun operating {{scheduled service}} between the island and North Bay, Ontario using 19-seat <b>turbo-prop</b> airplanes in November 1980. In September 1981, Voyageur began offering scheduled service to Sudbury, Ontario. The 1981 year saw an increase in traffic at the airport, recording 213,795 takeoffs and landings, the highest number since 1969. The number was attributed {{to an increase in}} local traffic, including that of flight training, accounting for 153,141 of the total, and an increase in medical flights at 615. The airport continued to run a deficit, of $223,000 of the $746,000 cost of operating the airport. The Government of Canada paid the deficit.|$|E
25|$|On 7 August, Ken McGonigle, aged 50, {{a former}} member of the RUC, saved the life of one of the most senior US {{officers}} in Afghanistan when he was killed. He was working in Musa Qal’eh, Helmand province with private security company New Century, when he exchanged fire with two escaped Taliban prisoners who were taking aim with a grenade launcher at a US special forces helicopter leaving a base. The 50-year-old Co Londonderry father of four was shot dead and two US Marines were subsequently killed in the fight. But the MV-22B Osprey aircraft, which can operate as both a helicopter and a <b>turbo-prop</b> aeroplane, escaped. It later emerged that vice admiral Robert Harward, a three-star US Navy SEAL who has been nominated to take over as deputy commander of US forces in Afghanistan, was in the aircraft. His actions later merited the award of the Queens Gallantry Medal.|$|E
40|$|The {{coupling}} of a vibrating finite elastic cylinder and {{its interior}} cavity, closed with rigid end caps, is examined. Results are presented for {{several types of}} excitation including a point force, a single external acoustic monopole, {{and an array of}} external monopoles. Modal spectra are examined for a frequency range typical of the harmonic noise produced by advanced <b>turbo-props.</b> The effect of frequency and source distribution on modal content is presented. Significant interface modal filtering, which would have a beneficial impact on an active system for reducing interior noise, was found to occur for all cases. Some preliminary experimental data for a stiffened, composite cylinder are presented and discussed...|$|R
50|$|The Navy’s first {{long range}} Maritime Reconnaissance {{squadron}} was commissioned with five ex IAF Super Constellation aircraft on 8 November 1976. Cdr R D Dhir was the commissioning Squadron Commander. The squadron was originally based at INS Hansa, Goa. The Super Constellation aircraft were phased out in 1983. On 16 April 1988, Tupolev 142M aircraft were commissioned into the squadron by the then Defence Minister KC Pant, at INS Hansa. The Albatross, {{due to their}} phenomenal Maritime Reconnaissance (MR) capabilities have been spearheading the Navy’s MR effort ever since and are among the finest aircraft of their kind {{in the world in}} addition to being the fastest <b>turbo-props.</b> With continuous equipment upgrades and integration of new technologies, the Albatross have remained the lead aircraft for long range reconnaissance, ASW and ESM/ EW missions in the Indian Navy. The squadron was shifted to INS Rajali, Arakkonam by April 1992, and has been based there ever since. The first TU142M landed at Rajali on 7 March 1992.|$|R
50|$|In a zero-bypass (turbojet) engine {{the high}} {{temperature}} and high pressure exhaust gas is accelerated by expansion through a propelling nozzle and produces all the thrust. The compressor absorbs all the mechanical power {{produced by the}} turbine. In a bypass design extra turbines drive a ducted fan that accelerates air rearward {{from the front of}} the engine. In a high-bypass design, the ducted fan and nozzle produce most of the thrust. Turbofans are closely related to turboprops in principle because both transfer some of the gas turbine's gas power, using extra machinery, to a bypass stream leaving less for the hot nozzle to convert to kinetic energy. Turbofans represent an intermediate stage between turbojets, which derive all their thrust from exhaust gases, and <b>turbo-props</b> which derive minimal thrust from exhaust gases (typically 10% or less). Extracting shaft power and transferring it to a bypass stream introduces extra losses which are more than made up by the improved propulsive efficiency. The turboprop at its best flight speed gave significant fuel savings over a turbojet even though an extra turbine, a gearbox and a propeller were added to the turbojet's low-loss propelling nozzle. The turbofan has additional losses from its extra turbines, fan, bypass duct and extra propelling nozzle compared to the turbojet's single nozzle.|$|R
25|$|In September 2014 typical {{commercial}} {{passenger traffic}} included Airbus A319/A320s, Boeing 737s, Embraer 170s, MD-80s, Boeing 717s, CRJ 900s, CRJ700s, CRJ 200s, and Embraer 145s models on about 128 take offs or landings daily. The dominant mainline aircraft was the Boeing 737 due to Southwest Airlines and Delta Air Lines service. Delta also uses the Airbus A319/A320 and MD-88 on its mainline flights. American Eagle (Republic Airlines) and Delta Connection (Compass Airlines) uses the Embraer 170. The CRJ700/900 family {{was the most}} common regional aircraft, being used by American Eagle, Delta Connection, and United Express. The Canadair Regional Jets and ERJ 145 shared the second spot for regional jets, being utilized by the airlines above as well as American Eagle. Southern Airways Express operates on demand charter flights to select cities on the Cessna 208 Caravan aircraft (the only scheduled passenger service to BHM on <b>turbo-prop</b> aircraft). Mountain Air Cargo also operates daily flights to Memphis using the ATR-72 twin-turboprop aircraft on behalf of FedEx Express. Unique regularly scheduled aircraft included a Boeing 727-200 and Boeing 757-200 operated by FedEx as well as the Airbus A300-600 and Boeing 767-300F (seasonal) operated by UPS, the only wide body aircraft to routinely use the airport. Numerous other aircraft are used for frequent charter flights. Birmingham–Shuttlesworth International Airport is also a primary diversion airport for both Memphis International Airport and Atlanta Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport due to its 12,007ft runway, which frequently brings brief but unique visitors.|$|E

40|$|This {{article was}} {{published}} in the journal, Journal of Transport Geography [© Elsevier], and the definitive version is available at: [URL] jets, normally defined as jet aircraft introduced since 1993 with less than 100 seats, have been thought to have significant impacts on air services at airports, for example, in improving service frequency, allowing airlines to exploit niche markets and to feed hubs. Previous studies have focused on regional jet deployment strategy and the overall situation and they suggest that deployment was generally to larger cities first and, in addition, to locations east of the Mississippi. It has also been suggested that smaller airports might lose service when regional jets replace <b>turbo-props</b> and that carrier competition would increase, to the benefit of the consumer. This paper aims to throw more light on these issues from the individual airports’ point of view. Data on changes in schedules from the Official Airline Guide (OAG) at a series of case study airports from 1994 to 2002 is used to examine, the impacts on new route development, market dynamics, carrier competition and concentration and deployment status. In particular, the impact on smaller airports is examined. It is concluded, subject to the usual caveats on sample size, that there is little evidence of a uniform impact on routes or airports. The aggregate picture often described by the industry and government is shown to be a combination of highly dissimilar cases. A spectrum of effects is identified across different types of airports and routes but some of the anticipated trends, such as hub bypassing, are not observed. Some airports reaped significant benefits in terms of improved frequency and services to new destinations, whilst others gained little...|$|R
