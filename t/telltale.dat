5|$|Although the game's {{development}} {{appeared to}} be proceeding towards completion without difficulty, LucasArts abruptly canceled production of Freelance Police in March 2004, citing economic and market conditions. The game's cancellation was received poorly by fans of the series, Steve Purcell, and the video game industry media. Many journalists viewed this move as a culmination in {{the decline of the}} adventure game genre. LucasArts later terminated its adventure game development, and many of the Freelance Police design team left to create <b>Telltale</b> Games and continue development of such adventure games. Steve Purcell moved the Sam & Max franchise to <b>Telltale</b> Games in 2005, prompting a revival of Sam & Max video games.|$|E
5|$|Sam & Max Save the World is {{a graphic}} {{adventure}} video game developed by <b>Telltale</b> Games. The game was originally released as Sam & Max: Season One before being renamed in early 2009. Save the World {{was developed in}} episodic fashion, comprising six episodes that were released for Microsoft Windows {{over the course of}} late 2006 and early 2007. The episodes were initially distributed online by GameTap and <b>Telltale</b> Games themselves, although the later retail releases of the game were published by The Adventure Company and JoWooD Productions in North America and Europe respectively. A Wii port of the game was published in late 2008, and an Xbox Live Arcade version was released in mid-2009.|$|E

5|$|After LucasArts' license with Steve Purcell {{expired in}} 2005, the Sam & Max {{franchise}} moved to <b>Telltale</b> Games, {{a company of}} former LucasArts employees who had worked {{on a number of}} LucasArts adventure games, including on the development of Freelance Police. Under <b>Telltale</b> Games, a new episodic series of Sam & Max video games was announced. Like both Sam & Max Hit the Road and Freelance Police, Sam & Max Save the World was in a point-and-click graphic adventure game format, although it lacked the original voice actors for the characters. The first season ran for six episodes, each with a self-contained storyline but with an overall story arc running through the series. The first episode was released on GameTap in October 2006, with episodes following regularly until April 2007, and a special compilation on the Wii released in October 2008. A second season, Sam & Max Beyond Time and Space, began in November 2007 and ended in April 2008. This was also released as a compilation on the Wii. Originally expected to be released in 2009, a third season, , began in April 2010.|$|E
5|$|In February 2009, <b>Telltale</b> Games {{renamed the}} game from its initial release title of Sam & Max: Season One to Sam & Max Save the World. Telltale's public {{relations}} spokeswoman, Emily Morganti, explained that while Season One was thought to communicate the game's episodic nature to potential consumers, the company {{felt that it was}} nondescript in relation to the game's story. The message accompanied the announcement of an Xbox Live Arcade version of the game, which had been subject to media speculation since February 2007. Both Windows and Wii versions of the game are to be republished using the new title.|$|E

5|$|A {{second season}} of episodic video games {{developed}} by <b>Telltale</b> Games {{was announced in}} July 2007. Sam & Max Beyond Time and Space followed the same overall format as Save the World, with each episode having a contained storyline with an overarching storyline involving laundering of {{the souls of the}} dead. As with Save the World, episodes were originally published on GameTap before being made available for general release. The season consisted of five episodes and ran from November 2007 to April 2008. Nowlin and Kasten both returned to reprise their voice roles. In addition to the main games, a twenty-minute machinima video was produced, taking the form of a Sam & Max Christmas special.|$|E
5|$|Disruptive {{patterns}} use strongly contrasting, non-repeating markings such as spots or stripes {{to break}} up the outlines of an animal or military vehicle, or to conceal <b>telltale</b> features, especially the eyes, as in the common frog. Disruptive patterns may use more than one method to defeat visual systems such as edge detection. Predators like the leopard use disruptive camouflage to help them approach prey, while potential prey like the Egyptian nightjar use it to avoid detection by predators. Disruptive patterning is common in military usage, both for uniforms and for military vehicles. Disruptive patterning, however, does not always achieve crypsis on its own, as an animal or a military target may be given away by factors like shape, shine, and shadow.|$|E
5|$|One CMPC {{shooting}} {{location was}} on family property near Boulder Creek, California where Middleton's father {{had established a}} timber holding {{now known as the}} Middleton Tract. Other filming locations included undeveloped portions of Sonoma, Santa Cruz and Marin counties. In San Rafael, the studio boasted a large glass-walled and -roofed building that let in light but not wind so that shooting for indoor scenes could take place in full light without the <b>telltale</b> flapping of tablecloths and clothing blown by gusts. Considered expensive at the time, the company used a 1,250 Bell & Howell movie camera, worth about $ in current value. The camera held two reels of film so that two negatives were made of each scene. A second $700 camera provided a third reel of the same scene, from another perspective.|$|E

Complaints {{focused primarily on}} the perceived erratic quality of the game's puzzle design, a weak supporting cast in the early chapters, and the game's control system.

5|$|A more {{coherent}} Walter explains that, {{according to}} the Observer September, the Observers made the Earth uninhabitable by 2609, and so traveled {{back in time to}} take over the planet themselves. As forces corner the three, Walter sets up an antimatter device to wipe out the Massive Dynamic building and their pursuers. Walter is able to lead Simon and Etta to where Peter Bishop (Joshua Jackson), Astrid Farnsworth (Jasika Nicole) and William Bell have been encased in amber. They are able to free Astrid, but as Fringe forces approach they find the equipment to free the others has malfunctioned. Simon sacrifices himself to the amber in order to push Peter free, while Walter severs Bell's hand for an unknown purpose. They escape the area as Broyles and his team arrive, though Broyles finds a piece of licorice, a <b>telltale</b> sign of Walter's presence. As the group travels away from the city, Walter, in an ominous manner, reminds Astrid of what Bell did to Olivia (Anna Torv). Peter then comes to recognize Etta as his daughter, Henrietta, wearing a fired bullet as a necklace.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, in 1980, {{geologist}} Walter Alvarez and his father, Nobel Prize-winning scientist Luis Walter Alvarez, put forth his hypothesis {{that a large}} extraterrestrial body had struck Earth. In 1981, unaware of Penfield's discovery, University of Arizona graduate student Alan R. Hildebrand and faculty adviser William V. Boynton published a draft Earth-impact theory and sought a candidate crater. Their evidence included greenish-brown clay with surplus iridium containing shocked quartz grains and small weathered glass beads that looked to be tektites. Thick, jumbled deposits of coarse rock fragments were also present, {{thought to have been}} scoured from one place and deposited elsewhere by a megatsunami resulting from an Earth impact. Such deposits occur in many locations but seem concentrated in the Caribbean basin at the K–Pg boundary. So when Haitian professor Florentine Morás discovered what he thought to be evidence of an ancient volcano on Haiti, Hildebrand suggested it could be a <b>telltale</b> feature of a nearby impact. Tests on samples retrieved from the K–Pg boundary revealed more tektite glass, formed only in the heat of asteroid impacts and high-yield nuclear detonations.|$|E
5|$|Dr. Taub, {{using his}} {{experience}} as a plastic surgeon, gains Kenny's and his father's trust and frequently clashes with House on the diagnosis. House believes Kenny is suffering juvenile rheumatoid arthritis while Taub believes it is merely the side effects of increased intracranial pressure. By persuading Kenny's father not to follow House's treatment and by attempting to kick him off the case, House fires Taub, only to have his decision reversed by Cuddy. Ultimately both House and Taub are proven wrong when Thirteen realizes Kenny is suffering Lyme disease, with the <b>telltale</b> rash hidden by his hair. Incensed by Taub's actions, House begins to dig into his life, and gets him to confess that he resigned his old position as a plastic surgeon because he was discovered having a secret affair with his nurse. He signed a non-compete agreement with his former partners in exchange for their keeping quiet about the affair, effectively blackballing him out of his area of expertise.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Telltale's</b> games {{reportedly}} {{suffer from}} an abnormally {{high rate of}} bugs and other technical flaws, pervasive enough to pose a significant risk of impeding players' ability to progress through a given title. A 2015 article by Kotaku noted that [...] "their games, wonderful in many ways as they may be, have been accompanied by an undercurrent of fan anger" [...] over widespread bugs and glitches. The article concluded that <b>Telltale's</b> support forums [...] "paint {{a portrait of a}} publisher that is constantly releasing buggy and even outright broken games", seemingly lacking the resources to fix or even monitor most of them.|$|R

50|$|Most of <b>Telltale's</b> {{products}} are adventure games based on licensed properties from film, comics, television, and other video games. Their initial games followed more traditional adventure game approaches with the player solving puzzles to progress. Their critical breakout title, The Walking Dead {{based on the}} comic book series of the same name, introduced a more narrative-directed approach, featuring decisions that are made by the player that created determinants that affect how future events in the game or its sequels can play out, effectively allowing players to craft their own personalized take on the offered story; all of <b>Telltale's</b> games since have featured this player choice-driven approach.|$|R
5|$|The prime universe's Peter succumbs to {{his illness}} and dies, and Walter {{and his wife}} Elizabeth (Orla Brady) mourn their loss, {{supported}} by Walter and William's friend, Nina Sharp (Blair Brown) and Walter's lab assistant, Carla Warren (Jenni Blong). Walter, through his window, shows Elizabeth the other Peter, and asserts they should be happy knowing another Peter exists. Later, Walter watches Walternate explore other cures. Walternate is distracted {{by the arrival of}} an Observer, September (Michael Cerveris), and fails to see the <b>telltale</b> color change indicating a cure. Walter is able to recreate and stabilize Walternate's cure, and then decides to use untested equipment to cross over to give the cure to Peter. Carla tries to stop Walter, knowing the technology could damage the fabric of space-time, and contacts Nina for help. Separately, September informs his fellow Observers that he may have made a mistake and assures them he will correct it.|$|E
25|$|The {{first series}} proved successful, leading <b>Telltale</b> to begin {{development}} of a second episodic season. The first episode of the second season was released in late 2013. According to Connors, <b>Telltale</b> incorporates what players liked best from the previous seasons, while considering how and by what means they will continue the story, and include the possibility of tying in more of the characters from the television show.|$|E
25|$|In {{previous}} series {{developed by}} <b>Telltale</b> for multiple platforms, {{they had had}} difficulty in timing releases to reach all players at the same time. One aspect of {{this was due to}} issues encountered on the Xbox Live Arcade service for the Xbox 360; for small publishers, like <b>Telltale</b> at the time, they had to arrange with larger publishers to allocate a slot within the Arcade's release schedule several months in advance, making it difficult to coordinate with releases on other platforms. After the success of the Back to the Future and Jurassic Park games, however, <b>Telltale</b> were able to officially achieve a publisher status on Xbox Live, giving them more control of the release schedule. Furthermore, they had designed the game such that the second through fifth episodes would be treated as downloadable content, allowing them to bypass slot scheduling and assuring same-day release on both PCs and consoles.|$|E
25|$|<b>Telltale's</b> art director, Derek Sakai, led the {{creation}} of the characters and their expressions. Sakai was told to not use symmetric expressions to help create more human-like expressions and help improve the realism of the game. Sakai drew inspiration from his own daughter to develop the character of Clementine.|$|R
50|$|While Tales was {{critically}} well-received, {{the title}} had not met management's expectations for financial returns compared to its other properties like The Walking Dead. According to co-director Nick Herman, {{about halfway through}} the series' release, <b>Telltale's</b> management considered pulling the series {{so that they could}} reassign the staff to more lucrative projects, but the project leads worked out a deal to retain a skeleton staff to see the game out through its final episodes. Eurogamers Jeffrey Matulef noted that the last episodes of the series seemed to be the best work that <b>Telltale's</b> done, likely as a result of those most committed to the project staying on as the skeleton staff. Because of the poor financial performance, Herman does not anticipate there will be a sequel to the series.|$|R
50|$|Minecraft: Story Mode {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics.

It is available for Android, iOS, Kindle Fire HDX, Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, PlayStation 3, PlayStation Vita, Xbox 360, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

25|$|<b>Telltale</b> later {{announced}} that they would provide a disc-based release of the complete game for these platforms on December 11, 2012, {{after the release of}} the fifth episode. Exclusive to GameStop stores in North America is the Collector's Edition, which includes new artwork by Charlie Adlard and The Walking Dead: Compendium One, a comic book that embody the first 48 issues of the series by Robert Kirkman. Following the retail release, some Xbox 360 owners without large storage options reported stuttering issues with the disc-based game; <b>Telltale</b> compensated these users with free codes to download the full series digitally.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Telltale's</b> {{breakthrough}} success {{came with}} the licenses of the comic book series The Walking Dead and Fables in association with Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment in 2011. Allison anticipated that The Walking Dead series could be a $20 to $30 million franchise. Their The Walking Dead video game presented an alteration of <b>Telltale's</b> approach, as rather than a traditional adventure game where players would need to solve puzzles, The Walking Dead was more focused on providing a cinematic experience but presenting choices to the player, either through dialog trees or through quick time events, that would create [...] "determinants" [...] that would feed into latter parts of the episode and into future episodes; one example would be deciding which of one of two characters to save from a zombie attack at {{the spur of the}} moment. This was designed to allow each player to have a more personalized story around what they wrote. This format provided highly successful: the game sold one million copies in 20 days, exceeded 8.5 million episode purchases by 2013, and has led to two additional 5-episode seasons plus a 3-episode mini-season to date. The Walking Dead is considered to have revitalized the waning adventure game genre due to this more emotionally-driven focus. Since The Walking Dead, nearly all of <b>Telltale's</b> games have used a similar approach of being built around the impacts of the player's choices as determinants in later episodes and seasons.|$|R
