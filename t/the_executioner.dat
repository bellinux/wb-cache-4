5|$|Chief Constable Dewar sent a {{telegraph}} {{detailing the}} circumstances of the crime to the London Metropolitan Police, which was investigating the crimes attributed to Jack the Ripper. Detectives from London did not consider Bury a realistic suspect in their investigation into the Ripper murders, but Inspector Frederick Abberline did interview witnesses in Whitechapel connected to Bury, including William's former employer James Martin and landlords Elizabeth Haynes and William Smith. According to <b>the</b> <b>executioner</b> James Berry and crime reporter Norman Hastings, Scotland Yard sent two detectives to interview Bury, but there is no surviving record of the visit in the police archive.|$|E
5|$|Forty {{years earlier}} than de Tournefort, de Thévenot {{described}} {{much the same}} process, adding that it was seldom used because it was regarded as too cruel. Some 80 years prior to de Thevenot, in 1579, Hans Jacob Breuning von Buchenbach witnessed {{a variant of the}} gaunching ritual. A large iron hook was fixed on the horizontal cross-bar of the gallows and the individual was forced upon this hook, piercing him from the abdomen through his back, so that he hung from it, hands, feet and head downward. On top of the cross bar, <b>the</b> <b>executioner</b> situated himself and performed various torture on the impaled man below him.|$|E

5|$|In the Holy Roman Empire (and {{elsewhere}} in Central/Eastern Europe), women who killed their newborn could be {{liable to be}} placed in an open grave, and have a stake hammered into their heart. A detailed description of an execution in this manner comes from 17th century Košice (then in Hungary, now in eastern Slovakia). A woman to be executed for infanticide involved an executioner and two assistants to help him. First, a grave some one-and-a-half ell deep was dug. The woman was placed within it, her hands and feet secured by driving nails through them. <b>The</b> <b>executioner</b> placed a small thorn bush upon her face. He then placed, and held vertically, a wooden stave at her heart to mark its location, while his assistants piled earth on the woman, keeping her head free of earth {{at the behest of the}} clerics, however, as to do otherwise would have quickened the death process. Once the earth had been piled upon her, <b>the</b> <b>executioner</b> grabbed with a pair of tongs a rod made of iron, which had been made red hot. He positioned the glowing iron rod beside the wooden stave, and as one of his assistants hammered the rod in, the other assistant emptied a trough of earth upon the woman's head. It is said that a scream was heard, and that the earth actually moved upwards for a moment, before all was over.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>executioner</b> was masked and disguised, {{and there}} is debate over his identity. The commissioners {{approached}} Richard Brandon, the common hangman of London, but he refused, at least at first, despite being offered £200. It is possible he relented and undertook the commission after being threatened with death, {{but there are others}} who have been named as potential candidates, including George Joyce, William Hulet and Hugh Peters. The clean strike, confirmed by an examination of the king's body at Windsor in 1813, suggests that the execution was carried out by an experienced headsman.|$|E
5|$|U.S. President Caldwell assigns Fisher, his {{colleague}} Charlie Cole, CIA agent Isaac Briggs and Anna Grímsdóttir to Fourth Echelon, a new special-ops and counter-terrorism unit. Charged with stopping the Engineers, the group uses the cargo plane Paladin as its command center. Fourth Echelon first aims to secure Andriy Kobin, a CIA hostage believed to possess {{information on the}} Engineers. Fisher extracts him from a safe house in Benghazi, and learns that his associates have ties to the Engineers. Infiltrating an insurgent stronghold, he finds an executed U.S. soldier and learns from a video recording that <b>the</b> <b>executioner</b> is Majid Sadiq; a former MI6 agent, Sadiq demands the Fourth Echelon to stop interfering.|$|E

5|$|The Countess {{was left}} rich under Leicester's will; yet the {{discharge}} of his overwhelming debts diminished her wealth. In 1604–1605 she successfully defended her widow's rights in court when her possessions and her good name were threatened by the Earl's illegitimate son, Robert Dudley, who claimed that he was his father's legitimate heir, thus implicitly declaring her marriage bigamous. Lettice Knollys was always close to her large family circle. Helpless at the political eclipse of her eldest son, the second Earl of Essex, she lost both him and her third husband to <b>the</b> <b>executioner</b> in 1601. From the 1590s she lived chiefly in the Staffordshire countryside, where, in reasonably good health until the end, she died at age 91 on Christmas Day 1634.|$|E
5|$|In 1323, Roger Mortimer, who {{had been}} held in captivity in the Tower of London, escaped and fled to France. Two years later, Queen Isabella {{travelled}} to Paris on an embassy to the French king. Here, Isabella and Mortimer developed a plan to invade England and replace Edward II on the throne with his son, the young Prince Edward, {{who was in the}} company of Isabella. Isabella and Mortimer landed in England on 24 September 1326, and due to the virulent resentment against the Despenser regime, few came to the king's aid. Arundel initially escaped the invading force in the company of the king, but was later dispatched to his estates in Shropshire to gather troops. At Shrewsbury he was captured by his old enemy John Charlton of Powys, and brought to Queen Isabella at Hereford. On 17 November– the day after Edward II had been taken captive– Arundel was executed, allegedly on the instigation of Mortimer. According to a chronicle account, the use of a blunt sword was ordered, and <b>the</b> <b>executioner</b> needed 22 strokes to sever the earl's head from his body.|$|E
5|$|The killings were methodical. After the {{condemned}} individual's personal information was checked and approved, he was handcuffed {{and led to}} a cell insulated with stacks of sandbags along the walls, and a heavy, felt-lined door. The victim was told to kneel {{in the middle of the}} cell, and was then approached from behind by <b>the</b> <b>executioner</b> and immediately shot in the back of the head or neck. The body was carried out through the opposite door and laid in one of the five or six waiting trucks, whereupon the next condemned was taken inside and subjected to the same fate. In addition to muffling by the rough insulation in the execution cell, the pistol gunshots were also masked by the operation of loud machines (perhaps fans) throughout the night. Some post-1991 revelations suggest that prisoners were also executed in the same manner at the NKVD headquarters in Smolensk, though judging by the way that the corpses were stacked, some captives may have been shot while standing on the edge of the mass graves. This procedure went on every night, except for the public May Day holiday.|$|E

5|$|The Knave {{informs the}} Red Queen that Alice threatens her reign, and the {{soldiers}} and Bayard the Bloodhound are ordered to find Alice immediately. Meanwhile, the Cheshire Cat guides Alice to Thackery Earwicket the March Hare and Tarrant Hightopp the Mad Hatter. The Hatter helps Alice avoid capture by allowing himself to be seized instead. Later, Alice is found by Bayard the Bloodhound; but Alice insists upon helping the Hatter. At the Red Queen's citadel and palace (which is named Salazan Grum), the Red Queen is unaware of Alice's true identity and therefore welcomes her as a guest, named Um from Umbridge. Alice learns that the Vorpal Sword, the only weapon capable of killing the , is locked inside the den of the Bandersnatch. The Knave attempts to seduce Alice, but she rebuffs him, causing a jealous Red Queen to order that Alice be beheaded. Alice obtains the sword and befriends the Bandersnatch by returning its eye. She then escapes {{on the back of}} the grateful Bandersnatch and delivers the sword to the White Queen. The Cheshire Cat saves the Hatter from <b>the</b> <b>executioner,</b> and the Hatter calls for rebellion against the Red Queen. The rebellion is quickly put down by the Jubjub bird, but the resistance flees to the White Queen's castle, and both armies prepare for battle. Former caterpillar Absolem advises Alice to fight the Jabberwocky just before completing his transformation into a pupa.|$|E

25|$|A {{variant of}} the legend says that Miaoshan allowed herself to die at the hand of <b>the</b> <b>executioner.</b> According to this legend, as <b>the</b> <b>executioner</b> tried to carry out her father's orders, his axe {{shattered}} into a thousand pieces.

25|$|Finally {{in desperation}} {{he used his}} hands. Miaoshan, {{realising}} the fate that <b>the</b> <b>executioner</b> would meet at her father's hand should she fail to let herself die, forgave <b>the</b> <b>executioner</b> for attempting to kill her. It is said that she voluntarily took on the massive karmic guilt <b>the</b> <b>executioner</b> generated for killing her, thus leaving him guiltless. It is because of this that she descended into the Hell-like realms. While there, she witnessed first-hand the suffering and horrors that the beings there must endure, and was overwhelmed with grief. Filled with compassion, she released all the good karma she had accumulated through her many lifetimes, thus freeing many suffering souls back into Heaven and Earth. In the process, that Hell-like realm became a paradise. It is said that Yama, the ruler of hell, sent her back to Earth to prevent the utter destruction of his realm, and that upon her return she appeared on Fragrant Mountain.|$|E
