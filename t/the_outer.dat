5|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, {{the state of}} New York {{submitted}} a proposal to the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials that would substantially alter how <b>the</b> <b>Outer</b> Loop was numbered.

Most of the proposed changes took effect on March18, 1980, when NY47 was eliminated; however, I-390 was modified to end at its junction with I-490.
