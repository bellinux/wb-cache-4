25|$|I {{had watched}} Ken Barrington – a great Test batsman – {{as a boy}} and when I broke into the England side in the late Seventies he became a father figure. In fact, he was a mentor {{to a lot of}} us then – myself, David Gower, Ian Botham, Mike Gatting. Ken was an England {{selector}} and assistant manager on the West Indies tour of 1981. There were no official coach in those days but it was to Ken that most of us turned. Unlike many retired pros, he never used the words, 'In my day...' On the first night of the Test, he suffered a heart attack in our hotel. I was woken the next morning at around 8am by tour manager Alan Smith and captain Ian Botham. I knew something was wrong, because Both was never up before then. <b>They</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> the news. I had tears in my eyes when we went out on to the pitch for the minute's silence and again when I was batting in the second innings. We needed over 500 to win and it soon became apparent that we weren't going to get them. But I kept thinking of him and managed to make a hundred. Kenny was a counsellor, a friend and an inspiration.|$|E

After the song was announced as the third single from the album, American radio stations were unsure about playing the track due to its double entendre in the chorus.
