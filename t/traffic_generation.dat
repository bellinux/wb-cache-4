40|$|This paper {{starts with}} a {{presentation}} of the three generation of Ports within increasing emphasis to the two latest practical models (1960 - 1980 and 1981 – today). The third generation of ports maintained of course the traditional services, but had to offer different administrative and commercial ones, new services towards the protection of environment and distribution services. Successful ports had to understand their new role in the logistics chain, including information flow. The old model where ports were monopolies/ points in space due to the exclusive dual combination of sea-port-sea changed radically as logistics’ idea and network, emerged, investing also on other means of transport. Then we dealt with the Port of Piraeus (PP) case, with a historical analysis, its deregulation in 1999, and its traffic. Then I have examined in detail per service offered, the port’s impact on local employment and on number of enterprises. The employment provided is round the 33. 000 persons in 2100 companies but on an historical diminishing fashion. Something happened also internationally in all the third generation ports (ports handling containers). The underlying idea however is that container traffic and container terminals are the least in helping employment in the local economy. Finally, I run certain regression {{to find out the}} correlation between country’s population, GDP, Seaborne GDP, economic active population and port of Piraeus <b>traffic.</b> <b>Generations</b> of ports, port activities, employment impacts...|$|R

50|$|Travel demand {{theory was}} {{introduced}} in the appendix on <b>traffic</b> <b>generation.</b> The core of the field is the set of models developed following work by Stan Warner in 1962 (Strategic Choice of Mode in Urban Travel: A Study of Binary Choice). Using data from the CATS, Warner investigated classification techniques using models from biology and psychology. Building from Warner and other early investigators, disaggregate demand models emerged. Analysis is disaggregate in that individuals are the basic units of observation, yet aggregate because models yield a single set of parameters describing the choice behavior of the population. Behavior enters because the theory made use of consumer behavior concepts from economics and parts of choice behavior concepts from psychology. Researchers at the University of California, Berkeley (especially Daniel McFadden, who won a Nobel Prize in Economics for his efforts) and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (Moshe Ben-Akiva) (and in MIT associated consulting firms, especially Cambridge Systematics) developed what has become known as choice models, direct demand models (DDM), Random Utility Models (RUM) or, in its most used form, the multinomial logit model (MNL).|$|E

40|$|The actin {{cytoskeleton}} {{is central}} to many cell processes including membrane <b>trafficking</b> and <b>generation</b> of cell polarity. We have identified a role for actin in cell death and in promoting longevity of the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Aging in yeast appears to occur via an apoptotic-like pathway with changes including DNA fragmentation, loss of mitochondrial membrane permeability, increase in levels of ROS (reactive oxygen species) and exposure of phosphatidylserine in the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane. This pathway can be induced by alterations in actin dynamics, such that reduced dynamics correlates with increased levels of ROS and decreased viability. Conversely, increased actin dynamics correlates with low ROS levels and increased survival.
