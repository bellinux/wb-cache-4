5|$|In 1975 and 1976, <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>African</b> <b>government</b> {{conducted}} delicate {{negotiations with}} neighbouring states: the South Africans wanted to encourage those states to maintain economic relations with South Africa and Rhodesia while limiting {{the activities of}} the ANC, ZANU and ZAPU.

5|$|Burger's Daughter details a {{group of}} white anti-apartheid activists in South Africa seeking to {{overthrow}} <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>African</b> <b>government.</b> It {{is set in the}} mid-1970s, and follows the life of Rosa, the title character, as she comes to terms with her father Lionel Burger's legacy as an activist in the South African Communist Party (SACP). The perspective shifts between Rosa's internal monologue (often directed towards her father or her lover Conrad), and the omniscient narrator. The novel is rooted {{in the history of the}} anti-apartheid struggle and references to actual events and people from that period, including Nelson Mandela and the 1976 Soweto uprising.|$|E
5|$|Jack Abramoff {{wrote and}} co-produced the film Red Scorpion {{with his brother}} Robert in 1989. In the film, Dolph Lundgren plays Nikolai, a Soviet agent sent to assassinate an African revolutionary in a fictional country modeled on Angola. <b>The</b> <b>South</b> <b>African</b> <b>government</b> financed the film through the International Freedom Foundation, a front-group chaired by Abramoff, {{as part of its}} efforts to {{undermine}} international sympathy for the African National Congress. While working in Hollywood, Abramoff was convicted for fraud and other offenses that he had committed during his concurrent career as a lobbyist.|$|E
5|$|UNITA forces {{attacked}} Camabatela in Cuanza Norte province on 8 February 1986.

Savimbi proposed a truce regarding the Benguela railway on 26 March, saying MPLA trains could pass through {{as long as}} an international inspection group monitored trains to prevent their use for counter-insurgency activity. The government did not respond. In April 1987, Fidel Castro sent Cuba's Fiftieth Brigade to southern Angola, {{increasing the number of}} Cuban troops from 12,000 to 15,000.

5|$|Fearing {{that the}} guerrilla war would spread south, <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>African</b> <b>government</b> {{pressured}} Rhodesia {{to advance the}} process of détente with the politically moderate black governments of Zambia and Tanzania. As part of these negotiations, Smith's government agreed to release a number of black revolutionaries who had been indefinitely detained. After almost eleven years of imprisonment, Mugabe was released in November 1974. He moved in with his sister Sabina {{at her home in}} Highfield township. He was intent on joining the ZANU forces and taking part in the guerrilla war, recognising that to secure dominance of ZANU he would have to take command of ZANLA. This was complicated by internal violence within the paramilitary group, predominantly between members of the Manyika and Karange groups of Shona.|$|E
5|$|Nigeria's {{foreign policy}} was {{tested in the}} 1970s after the country emerged united from its own civil war. It {{supported}} movements against white minority governments in the Southern Africa sub-region. Nigeria backed the African National Congress (ANC) by taking a committed tough line with regard to <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>African</b> <b>government</b> and their military actions in southern Africa. Nigeria was also {{a founding member of}} the Organisation for African Unity (now the African Union), and has tremendous influence in West Africa and Africa on the whole. Nigeria has additionally founded regional cooperative efforts in West Africa, functioning as standard-bearer for the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and ECOMOG, economic and military organizations, respectively.|$|E

Through his efforts, the Natal Commission for Indian Education was appointed on 17 November 1927. With Sastri's support and encouragement, dissidents of the Transvaal British Indian Association (TBIA) founded the Transvaal Indian Congress (TIC) on 18 December 1927. The TBIA later {{merged with the}} South African Indian Congress. Section 104 of the Liquor Bill prohibiting Indians from entering licensed premises was withdrawn. The Thornton Committee was established in 1928 to investigate the sanitary conditions of Indians in and around Durban.|$|E

Representatives from the governments of Angola, Cuba, and South Africa signed the New York Accords, granting independence to Namibia and ending the direct involvement of foreign troops in the civil war, in New York City on 22 December 1988. The United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 626 later that day, creating the United Nations Angola Verification Mission (UNAVEM), a peacekeeping force. UNAVEM troops began arriving in Angola in January 1989.|$|E
5|$|The United States House of Representatives voted 236 to 185 {{to repeal}} the Clark Amendment on 11 July 1985. The MPLA {{government}} began attacking UNITA later that month from Luena towards Cazombo along the Benguela Railway in a military operation named Congresso II, taking Cazombo on 18 September. The MPLA government tried unsuccessfully to take UNITA's supply depot in Mavinga from Menongue. While the attack failed, very different interpretations of the attack emerged. UNITA claimed Portuguese-speaking Soviet officers led FAPLA troops while the government said UNITA relied on South African paratroopers to defeat the MPLA attack. <b>The</b> <b>South</b> <b>African</b> <b>government</b> admitted to fighting in the area, but said its troops fought SWAPO militants.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} of Zimbabwe {{declared a state}} of emergency in three provinces. Nearby Botswana donated 15 million litres of fuel to the country to help with their recovery. Although Botswana was affected by the floods, their government was able to provide food and relief to the storm victims. In South Africa, families were forced to keep corpses in their houses due to the ongoing flooding. The country's government authorized R7.1 million (ZAR, $1.1 million USD) to pay for emergency assistance. Limpopo Province was declared a disaster area. <b>The</b> <b>South</b> <b>African</b> <b>government</b> issued a warning on March 1, stating they flood refugees from Mozambique would be deported if they entered illegally.

5|$|According to {{the terms}} agreed in December 1974, the talks between the Rhodesian {{government}} and the UANC were to take place within Rhodesia, but in the event the black nationalist leaders were loath to attend a conference on ground they perceived as not neutral. The Rhodesians, however, were keen {{to adhere to the}} accord and meet at a Rhodesian venue. In an effort to placate both sides, Kaunda and Vorster relaxed the terms so that the two sides would instead meet aboard a train provided by <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>African</b> <b>government,</b> placed halfway across the Victoria Falls Bridge, on the Rhodesian–Zambian border. The Rhodesian delegates could therefore take their seats in Rhodesia and the nationalists, {{on the opposite side of}} the carriage, would be able to attend without leaving Zambia. As part of the détente policy, Kaunda and Vorster would act as mediators in the conference, which was set for 26 August 1975.|$|E
5|$|As {{world opinion}} {{hardened}} against South Africa during the 1960s because of apartheid, international governing bodies in various sports introduced boycotts of South African teams and athletes. Until 1976, non-whites were legally {{barred from the}} South Africa cricket team, and, as the law required matches to be racially homogenous, this also applied to visiting squads. <b>The</b> <b>South</b> <b>African</b> <b>government</b> provoked overseas ire in 1968 when it refused entry to the England cricket team because its proposed tour party included Basil D'Oliveira, a Cape Coloured. Amid the ensuing scandal, Marylebone Cricket Club (which then governed English cricket) called off the tour. Two years later, a tour of England by the South Africa cricket team was cancelled by the English Test and County Cricket Board (TCCB) at a week's notice following public protests and immense pressure from the UK government. South Africa did not play another official international cricket match until 1991.|$|E
5|$|During the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) tour of South Africa during 1948–49, {{the first}} under apartheid, the BBC {{commentator}} John Arlott was horrified {{when he saw}} a black man assaulted for no reason. This prompted him to visit several townships where he found black people living in very poor conditions. He contrasted this unfavourably with the luxury of the homes where he was entertained by white families. Billy Griffith, one of the touring team, accompanied him on one visit to a township, and was similarly appalled, but did not speak out against it. Arlott later condemned apartheid, during a 1950 BBC broadcast, and refused to commentate during future tours to the country. His example was followed by the England batsman and clergyman David Sheppard, who declined to tour South Africa, refused to play the team in 1960, and spoke out publicly against the policies of <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>African</b> <b>government</b> despite efforts by the MCC to silence him. Otherwise, there was little protest in England against South African cricket during the 1950s.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the storm}} in South Africa, workers {{restored}} the original {{course of the}} Umfolozi River after it had moved. Officials later purchased a new dredge to remove sediment from Lake St. Lucia, and the canal connecting the lake to the Umfolozi River was later finished. Local governments coordinated relief efforts in the country, including delivering food and providing shelter for those who lost their homes. The South African Red Cross provided food to storm victims, {{many of whom were}} beneficiaries of the food program during the extended drought. <b>The</b> <b>South</b> <b>African</b> <b>government</b> declared KwaZulu Natal as a disaster areas. The country's military provided 25helicopters to rescue flood victims and donated 3,000tents. The government later authorized $85million to fund repairing damaged rails and roads. The American government donated $100,000 to the country, mostly to purchase supplies. West Germany also donated about $231,000, mostly for the feeding program.|$|E
5|$|In 1962 Gibb & Partners {{was one of}} two firms chosen (with Coyne et Bellier) by <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>African</b> <b>government</b> {{to build}} two dams on the Orange River. The first to be {{constructed}} was the Hendrik Verwoerd Dam which was officially opened in March 1972. The second, the P.K. Le Roux Dam, was finished in 1977. Following the success of this project Paton was retained to build a third, smaller dam, the Spioenkop Dam, which was finished in 1972. Paton was also involved with the tunnelling and underground powerhouse for the Drakensberg Pumped Storage Scheme. Paton was retained by the World Bank once more in 1967 to supervise the construction of the Tarbela Dam in Pakistan, which was completed in 1976. He also worked on the modernisation of the Royal Mint which involved the move from its 600-year home at Tower Hill to Llantrisant in Wales in time for decimalisation in 1971.|$|E
5|$|In 1966, {{before a}} tour by the New Zealand rugby team, <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>African</b> <b>government</b> asked New Zealand to field an all-white team (thereby {{excluding}} Māori players); the New Zealand Rugby Football Union refused and cancelled the tour. As rugby was very popular among white South Africans, this caused concern in that community. The England cricket team was in New Zealand at the time, and Billy Griffith, {{by then the}} secretary of the MCC, when questioned said that the MCC would also cancel in similar circumstances. Despite these events in other world sports, South Africa continued to play international cricket. Efforts to put pressure on the International Cricket Conference (ICC) failed, and even when South Africa withdrew from the Commonwealth in 1961 (theoretically forfeiting the national team's Test status), their traditional opponents continued to play official Tests against them despite opposition from India, Pakistan and the West Indies.|$|E
