5|$|An atom can be ionized by {{removing}} {{one of its}} electrons. The electric charge causes the <b>trajectory</b> <b>of</b> an atom to bend when it passes through a magnetic field. The radius by which the <b>trajectory</b> <b>of</b> a moving ion is turned by the magnetic field {{is determined by the}} mass of the atom. The mass spectrometer uses this principle to measure the mass-to-charge ratio of ions. If a sample contains multiple isotopes, the mass spectrometer can determine the proportion of each isotope in the sample by measuring the intensity of the different beams of ions. Techniques to vaporize atoms include inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, both of which use a plasma to vaporize samples for analysis.|$|E

He understood the parabola, {{both in terms of}} conic sections {{and in terms of the}} ordinate (y) varying as the square of the abscissa (x). Galilei further asserted that the parabola was the theoretically ideal <b>trajectory</b> <b>of</b> a uniformly accelerated projectile in the absence of air resistance or other disturbances. He conceded that there are limits to the validity of this theory, noting on theoretical grounds that a projectile <b>trajectory</b> <b>of</b> a size comparable to that of the Earth could not possibly be a parabola, but he nevertheless maintained that for distances up to the range of the artillery of his day, the deviation of a projectile's trajectory from a parabola would be only very slight.|$|E

40|$|The goal of {{the present}} study was to extend our current {{understanding}} of the female-specific manifestations, developmental course, and outcomes of hyperactive-impulsive and inattentive (HIA) behaviors. This study modeled the developmental <b>trajectories</b> <b>of</b> hyperactive-impulsive and inattentive behavior in a population-based study of girls followed from kindergarten to fifth grade. Four <b>trajectories</b> <b>of</b> both hyperactive-impulsive and inattentive behavior were identified. Joint trajectory analyses revealed an association between the highest <b>trajectories</b> <b>of</b> hyperactive-impulsive behavior and inattentive behavior. Similarly, the lowest level <b>trajectories</b> <b>of</b> both hyperactive-impulsive and inattentive behaviors showed a high degree of association. Contrary to expectations and descriptions of ADHD in girls, the number of girls assigned to both the highest <b>trajectories</b> <b>of</b> inattentive behavior and the lowest <b>trajectories</b> <b>of</b> hyperactive-impulsive behavior was extremely low. Teacher- and self-reported measures of child functioning varied by trajectory group membership across all models, suggesting that sub-clinical levels of HIA behavior are associated with adjustment difficulties in girls...|$|R

5|$|Conversely, {{one might}} expect that {{inertial}} motions, once identified by observing the actual motions of bodies and making allowances for the external forces (such as electromagnetism or friction), {{can be used to}} define the geometry of space, as well as a time coordinate. However, there is an ambiguity once gravity comes into play. According to Newton's law of gravity, and independently verified by experiments such as that of Eötvös and its successors (see Eötvös experiment), there is a universality of free fall (also known as the weak equivalence principle, or the universal equality of inertial and passive-gravitational mass): the <b>trajectory</b> <b>of</b> a test body in free fall depends only on its position and initial speed, but not on any of its material properties. A simplified version of this is embodied in Einstein's elevator experiment, illustrated in the figure on the right: for an observer in a small enclosed room, it is impossible to decide, by mapping the <b>trajectory</b> <b>of</b> bodies such as a dropped ball, whether the room is at rest in a gravitational field, or in free space aboard a rocket that is accelerating at a rate equal to that of the gravitational field.|$|E

Late on February4, the JTWC discontinued advisories, and the MFR classified Elita as an extratropical cyclone on the next day. For the next week, the remnants of Elita meandered to the southeast of Madagascar. On February11, the residual circulation tracked southwestward, only to accelerate southeastward away from the region on February13, when the MFR ceased monitoring the system.|$|E

They demonstrated that the swing by the earth significantly altered the meteoroid's orbit. Its aphelion (the farthest it travels from the Sun) and orbital period were lowered to almost half of their original values. The object was initially in a highly inclined orbit (71°) and ended in an orbit with a slightly higher inclination (74°).|$|E
5|$|From one {{settlement}} in year 1, the Han Dynasty's {{involvement in the}} Minyue region grew into several counties. There were many Chinese counties in the area by the 4th century AD. The Minyue had been culturally assimilated {{by the time the}} Han Dynasty collapsed, and Chinese civilization was undergoing a transition to the Three Kingdoms period of Cao Wei, Shu Han, and Eastern Wu. Political upheaval in the north, such as Wang Mang's usurpation, had caused Han migrants to resettle in the south. The Han Dynasty's military expansion widened its commercial ties in addition acquiring large amounts of new territories. The empire's conquest of Minyue and Nanyue spoke of its vast size that it bordered the ancient kingdoms of Southeast Asia. Economic ties with the Han and subsequent dynasties affected the <b>trajectory</b> <b>of</b> maritime trade of Southeast Asia, where goods have been excavated made in styles resembling that of the ancient Han Chinese.

The trebuchet, which probably evolved from the petraria in the 13thcentury, was the most effective siege weapon before the development of cannons. These weapons were vulnerable to fire from the castle as they had a short range and were large machines. Conversely, weapons such as trebuchets could be fired from within the castle due to the high <b>trajectory</b> <b>of</b> its projectile, and would be protected from direct fire by the curtain walls.|$|E

It also found that dome shape and size was strongly correlated with growth, and that growth was allometric (in contrast to isometric) from flat to domed, supporting Ornatotholus as a juvenile Stegoceras. They also hypothesized that this model of dome growth, with dramatic changes from juvenile to adult, was the common developmental <b>trajectory</b> <b>of</b> pachycephalosaurs. These researchers noted that though Williamson and Carr's observation that the supratemporal fenestrae closed with age was generally correct, there was still a high degree of individual variation in the size of these fenestrae, regardless {{of the size of the}} frontoparietal, and this feature may therefore have been independent of ontogeny.|$|E
5|$|Like the Battles of Marathon and Thermopylae, Salamis {{has gained}} {{something}} of a 'legendary' status (unlike, for instance, the more decisive Battle of Plataea), {{perhaps because of the}} desperate circumstances and the unlikely odds. A significant number of historians have stated that Salamis {{is one of the most}} significant battles in human history (though the same is often stated of Marathon). In a more extreme form of this argument, some historians argue that if the Greeks had lost at Salamis, the ensuing conquest of Greece by the Persians would have effectively stifled the growth of Western Civilization as we know it. This view is based on the premise that much of modern Western society, such as philosophy, science, personal freedom and democracy are rooted in the legacy of Ancient Greece. Thus, this school of thought argues that, given the domination of much of modern history by Western Civilization, Persian domination of Greece might have changed the whole <b>trajectory</b> <b>of</b> human history. It is also worth mentioning that the celebrated blossoming of hugely influential Athenian culture occurred only after the Persian wars were won.|$|E

We used Growth Mixture Modeling to analyze different <b>trajectories</b> <b>of</b> depressive symptoms {{in a sample of}} 1, 072 Chilean adolescents (12 - 15 years old, 54 % female).
