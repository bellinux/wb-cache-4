Since then, he has started a daily therapeutic routine aimed at preventing future injuries, to which he is apparently susceptible after his first back injury. His hobbies include relaxing at the beach and playing basketball. Galvis married his wife, Anna, in 2013, and {{is the father of}} two girls named Anastasia and Nicole.|$|E
5|$|Most Noodles & Company {{restaurants}} are {{owned and operated}} by Noodles & Company Incorporated, but some are operated in a franchise model. Franchise locations are operated by an independent franchisee that is trained by Noodles & Company and uses the same menu, pricing and branding as corporate-owned stores. As of 2010, the average Noodles & Company store generated more than $1 million in annual revenue, with a profit of 21 percent. <b>Takeout</b> orders account for approximately 25 percent of revenues. According to Inc. Magazine, Noodles & Company is more selective in franchise partners than other franchise-based restaurants, and has a higher ratio of corporate-owned stores than most franchising restaurants.|$|E
5|$|The evening draw saw Team North America {{extending}} {{their lead}} by one point. Heath McCormick and Tom Brewster played a relatively quick game, with McCormick winning on a {{draw in the}} final end. Kevin Martin scored a huge four-point end against Thomas Ulsrud and commanded {{the rest of the}} match to secure Team North America's second win. Glenn Howard came short in winning his match versus Niklas Edin, however, when a failed in-off shot in the sixth end led to a steal by Edin. Edin secured Team World's only full point in the draw with a double <b>takeout.</b> At the end of the day, Team North America led Team World 19½–10½.|$|E
5000|$|There are, [...] "many 423 tricks." [...] For example, {{the plain}} 423, <b>Takeouts,</b> the Fake Mess, the W (or 423 columns), and Burke's barrage. In Burke's barrage the 3 is a carry, in <b>Takeouts</b> the 4 is a carry.|$|R
50|$|Two-suited <b>takeouts</b> (unusual notrump or Michaels cuebids, for example) {{are used}} in {{standard}} bidding with either weak or strong hands. Standard bidding counsels to overcall and rebid in the second suit with an intermediate two-suited hand. In EHAA, the weak hands are overcalled with a two-bid, and so two-suited <b>takeouts</b> should be used only with strong five loser / 15 HCP hands.|$|R

5|$|The Trinity is {{a popular}} {{whitewater}} rafting and kayaking river. Dam releases for fish restoration have incidentally increased {{the amount of water}} available for boating year-round. The river has three main whitewater runs, all known for their scenery and wildlife. The Pigeon Point section, alongside Highway 299, contains Class II-III (beginner to intermediate) rapids. Below the <b>takeout</b> at Cedar Flat, the Trinity flows through the extremely hazardous Class V Burnt Ranch Gorge, which was first run in 1971 by three kayakers, one of whom {{died of a heart attack}} soon after finishing the run, due to the arduous work of portaging many rapids. This gave the area a bad reputation for many years; it was not until 1983 when commercial trips began on this section of the river. The lower Trinity, much of which flows through the Hoopa Valley Reservation, is a Class II river with gentler and lower gradient despite having a greater volume of water flow.|$|E

25|$|In Canada, Japanese cuisine {{has become}} quite popular. Sushi, sashimi, and instant ramen are highly popular at {{opposite}} ends of the income scale, with instant ramen being a common low-budget meal. Sushi and sashimi <b>takeout</b> began in Vancouver and Toronto, and is now common throughout Canada. The largest supermarket chains all carry basic sushi and sashimi, and Japanese ingredients and instant ramen are readily available in most supermarkets. Most mid-sized mall food courts feature fast-food teppan cooking. Izakaya restaurants have surged in popularity.|$|E

25|$|Bryn Mawr {{has signed}} the American College and University President's Climate Commitment, {{and in doing}} so, the school agreed to make all new {{buildings}} comply with a LEED silver standard or higher; to purchase Energy Star products whenever possible; and to provide and {{encourage the use of}} public transportation. The school's dining halls strive to be environmentally sustainable by working to expand their local and organic offerings, recycling in all dining areas, and recycling used fry oil as bio-diesel fuel. The dining halls previously offered biodegradable <b>takeout</b> containers, but reverted to Styrofoam in the 2009/10 academic year. Additionally, all leftover food is donated to a local food bank. On the College Sustainability Report Card 2009, published by the Sustainable Endowments Institute, Bryn Mawr received a C+. The school's highest category score was an A in Investment Priorities, since Bryn Mawr invests in renewable energy funds, but the score was brought down by lower grades in categories like Green Building (in which the school earned a D, since the campus currently features no green buildings).|$|E

500|$|Auerbach {{was known}} for his love for cigar smoking. Because Red made his victory cigars a cult in the 1960s, Boston {{restaurants}} would often say [...] "no cigar or pipe smoking, except for Red Auerbach". In addition, Auerbach was well known for his love of Chinese food. In an interview shortly before his death, he explained that since the 1950s, Chinese <b>takeout</b> was the most convenient nutrition: back then, NBA teams travelled on regular flights and had a tight time schedule, so filling up the stomach with heavier non-Chinese food meant wasting time and risking travel-sickness. Over the years, Auerbach became so fond of this food that he even became a part-owner of a Chinese restaurant in Boston. Despite a heart operation, he remained active in his 80s, playing racquetball and making frequent public appearances.|$|E

50|$|Accordingly, {{partnership}} {{priority is}} to find an eight card or better major suit fit when jointly holding sufficient values for a game contract. 5-3 and 6-2 fits are easy to find in basic methods as responder can bid 3 or 3 over 1NT, and opener will not normally have a 5 card major to bid 1NT. However, finding 4-4 fits presents a problem. The 2 and 2 bids cannot be used for this as they are weak <b>takeouts,</b> a sign-off bid.|$|R
500|$|For {{the fall}} of 2007, the Litchfield Tower dining {{facilities}} were completely remodeled. [...] The newly renovated dining hall has been named [...] "Market Central", and contains six new all-you-can-eat venues and two <b>takeout</b> areas ("Market-To-Go" [...] and [...] "Quick Zone"). Often referred to as just [...] "Market" [...] by campus residents, Market Central's venues offer {{a great deal of}} variety. The Flying S-T-A-R Diner, for example, offers around-the-clock breakfast while Magellan's serves up food from around the world such as eggrolls and other ethnic specialties. Upon entering, students present their campus IDs to gain access to all six venues for their entire duration in the facility. Meal passes or dining dollars can be used for admittance.

500|$|The {{basic model}} for KFC in the United States, not {{necessarily}} duplicated elsewhere, is {{a focus on}} low prices, a limited menu (29 items on average) and an emphasis on <b>takeout.</b> A [...] "very strong percentage" [...] of sales come from African American customers. Many KFC locations are co-located with either Taco Bell or Pizza Hut, or other Yum! restaurants. When Yum! owned Long John Silver's and A Restaurants, these brands were often co-branded with KFC as well. Often these locations behave like a single restaurant, offering one menu with food items from both restaurant brands. In 2003, there were 354 KFC-Taco Bell combines, offering the full KFC menu and Taco Bell items, and 13 units offering the full KFC menu and {{a limited number of}} Pizza Hut items. The concept originated in 1991, when a KFC-Taco Bell combination opened in Virginia. Some locations were also opened as combinations of KFC, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut, but this failed to catch on, and Yum! CEO David Novak blamed a lack of franchisee commitment for its lack of success.|$|E

5000|$|In curling, {{the lead}} {{is the person}} who {{delivers}} the first two stones of the end for their team. On most teams, where the lead does not act as skip or vice, the lead will sweep for each of his teammates. Because of the free-guard rule, which prevents leads from removing most of an opponents stones, leads are usually proficient at throwing guards and other draws, and throw few <b>takeouts</b> or other power shots. In some regions, such as Eastern Ontario and the Eastern United States, the lead is responsible for determining who has hammer, using random selection, such as flipping a coin. However, in most regions, this {{is the responsibility of the}} third.|$|R
5000|$|The passive receive array {{consisted}} of ten strings of hydrophones mounted on 200 eighty-foot towers {{laid down the}} side of Plantagenet Bank in Bermuda. The strings were laid {{on the side of the}} bank using the U.S. Navy large covered lighter YFNB-12, reconfigured with a long overhead boom to handle the towers. Each cable had special <b>takeouts</b> built into it at intervals from which wires to the hydrophones were connected. Each tower was clamped onto the special cable with <b>takeouts.</b> At the upper end of the approximately 4 in cable a wire rope was attached and led to an explosively embedded anchor shot into the flat coral top of Plantagenet Bank. Tension of more than 40,000 lb was applied to the wire rope and cable to lay it {{down the side of}} the bank in the straightest line possible. At one point all further construction ceased while a stopper was placed on the special cable because most of the connection to the wire rope had broken and the string was being held by a few strands of wire on the double drum winch on YFNB-12. The YFNB-12 was held in place with four Murray and Tregurtha Diesel outboard engines placed on the corners and capable of 360 degree rotation, developing tremendous thrust in any direction. The cables led to Argus Island tower, from which the signal was conducted to the United States listening post located at Tudor Hill, Southampton, Bermuda (...) that had opened on June 1, 1955. At the time the post was classified top secret. Tudor Hill Naval Facility Bermuda was closed in 1995. The facility shares a short road with the Pompano Beach Club.|$|R

40|$|The {{detection}} of bedrock relief {{under the sea}} bottom is of great importance for the excavation works in port construction {{as well as for}} the foundation of various installations. Marine resistivity tomography profiles, properly positioned to cover the area under investigation and to avoid various obstacles, can provide this information. Precise knowledge of bathymetry is required in order to give reliable results. Well data for reference are valuable in defining and verifying the sudden changes of resistivity values in the sections. The Schlumberger electrode configuration is preferred with its more efficient signal-to-noise ratio. Pole-Pole can give information which is less accurate in horizontal layering but offers deeper detection. The RMS error in interpretation takes higher values when the sea bottom is deeper.
