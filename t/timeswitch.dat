50|$|Other local {{employers}} {{from that}} era were, the Shannon typewriter company at Shannon Corner, and the Venner <b>timeswitch</b> company nearby, maker of Britain's first parking meters. Also close to Shannon Corner were Carter's Tested Seeds and Bradbury Wilkinson, a security printing company, maker of banknotes {{for many of}} the world's smaller countries. The modern Tesco hypermarket occupies the former Bradbury Wilkinson site.|$|E
5000|$|This button, {{or input}} {{terminals}} connected to an external <b>timeswitch,</b> will sound the notification appliances briefly {{in a different}} cadence. It is used to signify class change / lesson breaks in schools, and allows the fire alarm system to be used instead of a separate class bell system. This ensures pupils {{are familiar with the}} sound of the alarm and means the notification appliance circuits are tested several times a day.|$|E
5000|$|The GTD-5 EAX ran on a Time-Space-Time (TST) topology. Each TCU {{contained}} two timeswitches (TSWs) with a {{total capacity}} of 1544 timeslots: 772 in the originating time switch and 772 in the terminating time switch. Four FIUs of 193 timeslots each were connected to the TSW. Trunking FIUs connected 192 timeslots of facility (eight DS1 carriers or 192 individual analog trunks). The original Analog Line FIU had a 768 line capacity with one codec per line. The digital output of the 768 codecs was concentrated to 192 timeslots before presentation to the <b>timeswitch,</b> a 4:1 concentration. In the later 1980s, higher capacity line frames of 1172 and 1536 lines became available, allowing for higher concentration ratios of 6:1 and 8:1.|$|E
40|$|This study {{considers}} {{the problem of}} beamforming optimisation in an amplify-and-forward relaying cooperative network, in which the relay node harvests the energy from the radio-frequency signal. Based on the self-energy recycling relay protocol, the authors study the beamforming optimisation problem. The formulated problem aims to maximise the achievable rate subject to the available transmitted power at the relay node. The authors develop a semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation method to solve the proposed problem. They also use SDP and the full search to solve the beamforming optimisation based on a time-switching relaying protocol as a benchmark. The simulation results are presented to verify that the self-energy recycling protocol achieves a significant rate gain compared with the <b>timeswitching</b> relaying protocol and the power-splitting relaying protocol...|$|R
50|$|An old {{method of}} {{powering}} free flight models is Alphonse PÃ©naud's elastic motor, essentially a long rubber band that is wound up prior to flight. It {{is the most}} widely used powerplant for model aircraft, found on everything from children's toys to serious competition models. The elastic motor offers extreme simplicity and survivability, but suffers from limited running time, {{and the fact that the}} initial high torque of a fully wound motor drops sharply before 'plateauing' to a more steady output, until finally declining as the final turns unwind. Using this torque curve efficiently is one of the challenges of competitive free-flight rubber flying, and variable-pitch propellers, differential wing and tailplane incidence and rudder settings, controlled by an on-board <b>timeswitch,</b> are among the means of managing this varying torque and there is usually a motor weight restriction in contest classes. Even so, a competitive model can achieve flights of nearly 1 hour.|$|E
5000|$|When flown competitively, {{the usual}} aim is maximum flight duration. In {{the case of}} models flown outdoors, the modeler {{attempts}} to launch the model into rising column of air, a thermal. These outdoor free flight models tend to be designed for two very different flying modes: climbing rapidly under power or tow, and gliding slowly while circling with minimum fall rate. Much of the challenge in designing and flying these models is to maintain aerodynamic stability in both modes {{and to make a}} smooth transition between them. Modern models use mechanical or electronic timers to move control surfaces at preset times. Detecting the thermal into which to launch is vital and can involve several methods, ranging from radio telemetered temperature and windspeed measurements plotted on a chart recorder to Mylar streamers or soap bubbles to visualize the rising air.Because competitions normally involve up to seven rounds during the day, each flown to a maximum flight time hard to achieve without thermal assistance; an automatic on-board <b>timeswitch</b> upsets the trim of the aircraft when the [...] "max" [...] is achieved, to bring the aircraft down safely and quickly. Locating and recovering the aircraft for further flights {{is an important part of}} free-flight. Many aircraft carry radio location beacons, and flyers will use GPS, binoculars, a compass and a directionally sensitive radio tracking receiver to assist them. A day's flying and retrieval may well involve 20 mi or so on foot or on bike, depending on wind strength.|$|E
