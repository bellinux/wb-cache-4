5|$|In 1967, Warner Bros.-Seven Arts {{producers}} Kenneth Hyman and Phil Feldman {{were interested}} in having Sam Peckinpah rewrite and direct an adventure film called The Diamond Story. A professional outcast due to the production difficulties of his previous film Major Dundee (1965) and his firing from the set of The Cincinnati Kid (1965), Peckinpah's stock had improved following his critically acclaimed work on the television film Noon Wine (1966). An alternative screenplay available at the studio was The Wild Bunch, written by Roy Sickner and Walon Green. At the time, William Goldman's screenplay Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid had recently been purchased by 20th Century Fox. It was quickly decided that The Wild Bunch, which had several similarities to Goldman's work, would be produced in order to beat Butch Cassidy to <b>the</b> <b>theaters.</b>|$|E
5|$|Katzenberg, Schneider, and Roy Disney {{set about}} {{changing}} {{the culture of the}} studio, increasing staffing and production so that a new animated feature would be released every year instead of every two to four. The first of the releases on the accelerated production schedule was Oliver & Company (1988), which featured an all-star cast including Billy Joel and Bette Midler and an emphasis on a modern pop soundtrack. Oliver & Company opened in <b>the</b> <b>theaters</b> on the same day as another Bluth/Amblin/Universal animated film, The Land Before Time; however, Oliver outgrossed Time and {{went on to become the}} most successful animated feature to that date.|$|E

5|$|Seattle {{was also}} the home base of {{impresario}} Alexander Pantages who, starting in 1902, opened a number of theaters in the city exhibiting vaudeville acts and silent movies. His activities soon expanded, and the thrifty Greek went on {{and became one of}} America's greatest theater and movie tycoons. Between Pantages and his rival John Considine, Seattle was for a while the western United States' vaudeville mecca. B. Marcus Priteca, the Scottish-born and Seattle-based architect, built several theaters for Pantages, including some in Seattle. <b>The</b> <b>theaters</b> he built for Pantages in Seattle have been either demolished or converted to other uses, but many other theaters survive in other cities of the U.S., often retaining the Pantages name; Seattle's surviving Paramount Theatre, on which he collaborated, was not a Pantages theater.|$|E
5|$|With the {{censorship}} of Polish theater (and the virtual {{end of the}} Polish radio and film industry), underground theaters were created, primarily in Warsaw and Kraków, with shows presented in various underground venues. Beginning in 1940 <b>the</b> <b>theaters</b> were coordinated by the Secret Theatrical Council. Four large companies and more than 40smaller groups were active throughout the war, even in the Gestapo's Pawiak prison in Warsaw and in Auschwitz; underground acting schools were also created. Underground actors, many of whom officially worked mundane jobs, included Karol Adwentowicz, Elżbieta Barszczewska, Henryk Borowski, Wojciech Brydziński, Władysław Hańcza, Stefan Jaracz, Tadeusz Kantor, Mieczysław Kotlarczyk, Bohdan Korzeniowski, Jan Kreczmar, Adam Mularczyk, Andrzej Pronaszko, Leon Schiller, Arnold Szyfman, Stanisława Umińska, Edmund Wierciński, Maria Wiercińska, Karol Wojtyła (who later became Pope John Paul II), Marian Wyrzykowski, Jerzy Zawieyski and others. Theater was also active in the Jewish ghettos and in the camps for Polish war prisoners.|$|E
5|$|Murphy was lent to MGM at {{a salary}} of $25,000 {{to appear in the}} 1951 The Red Badge of Courage {{directed}} by John Huston and adapted from the Stephen Crane novel. At the urging of Spec McClure and celebrity columnist Hedda Hopper, over the misgivings of producer Gottfried Reinhardt and studio executives Louis B. Mayer and Dore Schary, director Huston cast Murphy in the lead of The Youth (Henry Fleming in the novel). The preview screening audiences were not enthusiastic, causing Schary to re-edit Huston's work, eliminating several scenes and adding narration by James Whitmore. MGM trimmed advertising efforts on what they believed was an unprofitable film. What eventually hit <b>the</b> <b>theaters</b> was not a commercial success, and it was also not the film both Murphy and Huston believed they had made. Murphy unsuccessfully tried to buy the rights to the film in 1955 in an attempt to re-edit and re-release it. Huston tried to buy it in 1957, but was told the original negative of what he had filmed was destroyed.|$|E

5|$|Starting in 2000, {{the first}} of several {{renovation}} plans was announced for the mall. The initial plan called for the addition of a new, three-story wing with an eighteen-screen movie theater complex, as well as several upscale tenants. Under this proposal, the existing Sears store would have been converted to mall space, and a new Sears store built immediately behind it. These expansion plans never came to fruition. By 2002, General Cinemas had sold the mall's theater complex to AMC Theatres. One year later, Pyramid made a failed attempt to evict <b>the</b> <b>theaters</b> for a Best Buy store, although Best Buy opened a store at the mall next to Sears in 2006. AMC closed the mall's theaters in 2004 and only four days after closing, the theater complex was acquired and reopened by Regal Entertainment Group. The JCPenney Home Store closed in 2002. Kaufmann's was one of several former May Co. brands to be acquired and renamed by Macy's in 2005, and while the main Kaufmann's store was converted to Macy's, the Home Store was shuttered. Also in 2006, The Bon-Ton closed.|$|E
5|$|The single reel drama, 957 feet long, was {{released}} on May 13, 1910. Whether the film is 957 feet or 950 feet long is subject to debate. Bowers notes that some sources state the film is 950 feet long, one such example is the advertising for the film which lists it as being approximately this length. Advertising for the film recognized negativity of Friday the 13th {{and used it to}} promote the film to redefine the date to instead bring joy. The film was shown across the United States, advertisements for the showing included theaters in Kansas, Texas, and Pennsylvania. Identifying <b>the</b> <b>theaters</b> showing this work is complicated by the identically named The Best Man Wins by Vitagraph. The silent western produced in 1909 was still being shown and advertised in theaters {{at the time of the}} release of Thanhouser's film. An ambiguous advertisement, but most likely Vitagraph reference, is seen in The Hawaiian Star of Hawaii was published on the same day of the Thanhouser release.|$|E
