40|$|This bachelor’s thesis {{deals with}} the design of an adapter for the {{modification}} of a test device, where the automatic tensioners (dampers) of automotive belts are tested. The proposed adapter allows to test the functionality of the valve <b>tappet</b> <b>assembly.</b> The design of a simple test methodology is {{also a part of}} the solution. The first part of the thesis {{deals with the}} overview of the given issue. Subsequently, the design variants of the adapter and the loading methodology of the tested component are proposed. The main part describes the design of the adapter, the method of lubrication of the tested component, the measuring equipment used in the experimental test and the design of the test methodology. The complete drawing documentation of the adapter is the output of this work...|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} into the cause of leucoderma among four <b>tappet</b> <b>assembly</b> workers revealed the presence of 4 -tertiary butyl catechol (TBC) in the assembly oil. This substance was able to depigment black guinea pig skin in 5 % and 10 % concentrations {{in a variety of}} vehicles. The TBC is an irritant to guinea pig, rabbit, and human skin in concentrations of 0. 5 % or greater. Three of the four affected workers had positive patch tests to 0. 1 % TBC in acetone, and one developed depigmentation at the patch test site, which persisted during two months of observation. Attempts to sensitize ten albino guinea pigs to TBC were unsuccessful. The non-specific irritant effect of the carrier assembly oil blend was demonstrated. It is not possible at this time to relate the presence of depigmentation from TBC in exposed workers to the observed allergic contact dermatitis. Most likely these are unrelated phenomena...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper was}} {{published}} as Surface Engineering, 2005, 21, (1), pp. 67 - 71. It {{is available from}} [URL] Doi: 10. 1179 / 174329405 X 30039 Diamond like carbon (DLC) coatings have been investigated for application in the automotive valve train and, in particular, the camshaft drive assembly. The drive assembly can have various force transfer devices, such as an overhead bucket <b>tappet</b> <b>assembly</b> or a cam follower assembly. Force transfer devices operate in severe tribological contact situations with maximum Hertzian stresses approaching 1 GN m− 2 and temperatures in the range 100 – 150 °C. Lubrication is often partially starved and, therefore, the thermochemical properties and surface finish of the components are critical to their successful operation. For motor sport applications, DLC offers improved wear resistance over steel alone; and for passenger vehicles, the high hardness and commensurately lower friction coefficient that DLC gives against steel counterfaces offers improvements in fuel economy and lower wear. This paper presents the results from {{an investigation of the}} wear of DLC coated shims against standard production camshafts. DLC offers benefits in terms of reducing shim wear, but increases the wear of the camshaft. The wear mechanism observed for DLC is dependent on the oil type, but generally it is a pitting type mechanism. The cam wear occurs by plastic ratchetting. The consequences of the results are discussed in terms of the implementation of such coatings in standard valve train applications...|$|E
