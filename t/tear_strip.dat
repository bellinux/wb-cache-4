Only 2000 copies were pressed, and the records included yellow highlighter-colored, streaked 180-g vinyl, heavy-cardboard casing (reminiscent of pre-digital era releases), and a foil-stamped, die-cut <b>tear</b> <b>strip.</b>|$|E
50|$|Heat {{activated}} tape {{is usually}} tack-free {{until it is}} activated by a heat source. It is sometimes used in packaging, for example, a <b>tear</b> <b>strip</b> tape for cigarette packs. Conversely, thermal release tape, such as REVALPHA by Nitto Denko, loses its tack and fully releases when heated to a certain temperature. This type of tape is used often in the semiconductor industry.|$|E

Later, Rocco was {{introduced}} to Slydini by Bill and Rocco took lessons with Slydini as well. In 1988, he invented a gable-top milk carton that could be more easily collapsed for disposal by removing a <b>tear</b> <b>strip</b> {{at the bottom of}} the carton.|$|E

40|$|CONTEXT: Mucoadhesive {{nanoparticles}} {{were compared}} with non-aggregated constituent polymers for effect on pre-corneal residence of dexamethasone phosphate (DP) or met-enkephalin (ME), administered by eye-drops to rabbits. OBJECTIVE: Deepening the knowledge of ophthalmic nanoparticulate systems in terms of ability to prolong pre-corneal residence. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medicated nanoparticles resulted from gelation of quaternary ammonium-chitosan conjugate or its thiolated derivative with hyaluronan {{in the presence of}} drug. Particles were analyzed by light scattering. Dialysis removed non-encapsulated drug, dynamic dialysis measured drug-polymer interactions, and lyophilization-stabilized product. Dispersions were regenerated from lyophilized products. Also solutions of non-thiolated or thiolated chitosan derivative were administered. Mean drug residence time (MRT) in tears was determined by collecting samples from lower marginal <b>tear</b> <b>strip</b> of albino rabbits using capillaries. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Nanoparticle size of regenerated dispersions was 400 - 430 nm (DP-systems), 360 - 370 nm (ME-systems); the drug content was 2. 5 mg/mL (DP) or 0. 3 mg/mL (ME). The MRT for DP nanoparticles from non-thiolated derivative was higher than that for non-aggregated polymer, due to stronger concurrent interactions of positively charged nanoparticles with ocular surface and drug. Thiolated polymer nanoparticles and non-aggregated parent polymer, both interacting weakly with DP, showed similar MRT values. The MRT of ME could only be enhanced by protecting drug from enzymatic hydrolysis. This was done by nanoparticle systems, whereas non-aggregated polymers were ineffective. CONCLUSION: Developing a nanoparticle system rather than a solution of mucoadhesive polymer, for prolonging pre-corneal residence, is convenient, provided nanoparticles interact strongly with both ocular surface and drug, or protect drug from metabolic degradation...|$|E

40|$|Using commercially {{available}} reagents we developed an {{enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay}} to measure lactoferrin in normal human tears. Tears obtained from 38 normal human subjects contained a mean lactoferrin content of 2. 2 mg/ml (g/l). No differences in the mean level of lactoferrin were found when tears were collected by either Schirmer <b>tear</b> <b>strips</b> or by glass capillaries after short tear gas stimulation. Tear lactoferrin levels were not influenced by age or sex of the subjects investigated in this study. We found that lactoferrin represents approximately 25 % by weight of the total tear proteins...|$|R

Most of the galley slaves were far too exhausted by their long row, and too indifferent to aught but their own sufferings, to pay any attention to the newcomers. Two or three, however, came up to them and offered to assist in bandaging their wounds. Their doublets had already been taken by their captors; but they now <b>tore</b> <b>strips</b> off their shirts, and with these staunched the bleeding of their wounds.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare two methods of tear {{sampling}} for protein quantification. Tear samples were collected from 29 healthy dogs (58 eyes) using Schirmer <b>tear</b> test (STT) <b>strip</b> and microcapillary tubes. The samples were frozen at - 80 ºC and analyzed by the Bradford method. Results were analyzed by Student's t test. The average protein concentration and standard deviation from tears collected with microcapillary tube were 4. 45 mg/mL ± 0. 35 and 4, 52 mg/mL ± 0. 29 for right and left eyes respectively. The average protein concentration and standard deviation from tears collected with Schirmer <b>Tear</b> Test (STT) <b>strip</b> were and 54. 5 mg/mL ± 0. 63 and 54. 15 mg/mL ± 0. 65 to right and left eyes respectively. Statistically significant differences (p< 0. 001) were found between the methods. In the conditions in which this study was conducted, the average protein concentration obtained with the Bradford test from tear samples obtained by Schirmer <b>Tear</b> Test (STT) <b>strip</b> showed values higher than those obtained with microcapillary tube. It is important that concentration of tear protein pattern values should be analyzed according the method used to collect tear samples...|$|R
