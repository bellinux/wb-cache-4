5|$|Belgium {{has seen}} two talented waves since 1980, from which several players in {{defensive}} positions gained international fame. In the 1980s {{and the early}} 1990s, goalkeepers Jean-Marie Pfaff and Michel Preud'homme were elected best custodians at FIFA World Cups, while FIFA recognised midfielders Jan Ceulemans and Enzo Scifo as the propelling forces of Belgium's 1986 FIFA World Cup squad. In 2002, after all players of <b>this</b> <b>generation</b> had retired, Marc Wilmots became Belgium's top scorer at the World Cup with five goals.|$|E
5|$|Foster's {{flair for}} musical melodrama inspires Madonna {{to turn in}} what is easily her most assured and {{full-bodied}} vocal performance to date. Amid a swirl of strings and Spanish guitars, she spews the song's declaration of romantic independence with a theatrical verve that perfectly matches the stagey, potentially overpowering tone of Foster's arrangement without flying {{over the heads of}} her youthful top 40 following. A stunning effort that could easily become the 'I Will Survive' of <b>this</b> <b>generation.</b>|$|E
5|$|Nokia revived its N-Gage {{platform}} {{in the form}} of a service for selected S60 devices. This new service launched on April 3, 2008.

5|$|On {{the other}} hand a guitar revival took place and raised a new {{generation}} of alternative guitar bands often described as post-punk revival or garage rock revival. Prominent US bands of <b>this</b> <b>generation</b> are White Stripes, The Strokes, and The Killers. New Weird America or sometimes called Freak Folk is a new movement emphasizing the artistic individuality of genre crossing artists such as Antony and the Johnsons, Joanna Newsom, The Dodos, Animal Collective and Cat Power.|$|E
5|$|Absolutely. There's a {{song called}} 'Army of Me,' {{which is sort of}} a 'Fighter 2.0.' There is a new {{generation}} of fans from a younger demographic that might not have been with me all the way but that watch me on the show now. I feel like every generation should be able to enjoy and have their piece of 'Fighter' within. This time, the way it musically came together it just felt right for this time and <b>this</b> <b>generation.</b> There's {{always going to be a}} fighter in me getting through some obstacle and some hurdle. All these 6-year-olds who know me from pushing my button and turning around in a big red chair who weren't around for the actual 'Fighter,' this is my chance to recharge it, rejuvenate it and do something modernized for them.|$|E
5|$|Dissension {{resulting}} from inadequate government attention to Army needs was restrained under {{the generation of}} officers who had begun their careers during the 1820s. These officers were loyal to the monarchy, believed the military should be under civilian control, and abhorred the caudillism (Hispanic-American dictatorships) against which they had fought. But by the early 1880s, <b>this</b> <b>generation</b> (including commanders such as the Duke of Caxias, the Count of Porto Alegre, and the Marquis of Erval) had died, were retired, or no longer exercised direct command.|$|E

5|$|During the 12 {{years in}} which Belgium failed to qualify for major tournaments, another golden {{generation}} matured, most of whom later featured in foreign top football leagues; as of July 2013, 12 Belgian national team players would play the next season in the English Premier League. Five players of <b>this</b> <b>generation</b> gained both prime individual and team awards in foreign top competitions or European club competitions: defenders Vincent Kompany and Jan Vertonghen, wingers Eden Hazard and Kevin De Bruyne, and forward Kevin Mirallas. However, as of November 2016 {{none of them were}} regarded by FIFA or UEFA to be the best at their position in any major international tournament yet.|$|E
5|$|The Brezhnev generation— {{the people}} who lived and worked during the Brezhnev Era— owed their rise to {{prominence}} to Joseph Stalin's Great Purge in the late 1930s. In the purge, Stalin ordered the execution or exile of nearly all Soviet bureaucrats over the age of 35, thereby opening up posts and offices for a younger generation of Soviets. <b>This</b> <b>generation</b> would rule the country from the aftermath of Stalin's purge up to Mikhail Gorbachev's rise to power in 1985. The majority of these appointees were of either peasant or working class origin. Mikhail Suslov, Alexei Kosygin, and Brezhnev are prime examples of men appointed in the aftermath of Stalin's Great Purge.|$|E
5|$|The early 20th {{century is}} also {{marked by the}} {{presence}} of a group of composers called the generazione dell'ottanta (generation of 1880), including Franco Alfano, Alfredo Casella, Gian Francesco Malipiero, Ildebrando Pizzetti, and Ottorino Respighi. These composers usually concentrated on writing instrumental works, rather than opera. Members of <b>this</b> <b>generation</b> were the dominant figures in Italian music after Puccini's death in 1924. New organizations arose to promote Italian music, such as the Venice Festival of Contemporary Music and the Maggio Musicale Fiorentino. Guido Gatti's founding of the periodical il Piano and then La rassegna musicale also helped to promote a broader view of music than the political and social climate allowed. Most Italians, however, preferred more traditional pieces and established standards, and only a small audience sought new styles of experimental classical music.|$|E

5|$|By {{the early}} 1980s, Real Madrid {{had lost its}} grasp on the Liga title until a new cohort of {{home-grown}} stars brought domestic success back to the club. Spanish sport journalist Julio César Iglesias gave to <b>this</b> <b>generation</b> the name La Quinta del Buitre ("Vulture's Cohort"), which {{was derived from the}} nickname given to one of its members, Emilio Butragueño. The other four members were Manuel Sanchís, Martín Vázquez, Míchel and Miguel Pardeza; all five footballers were graduates of Real Madrid's youth academy. With La Quinta del Buitre (reduced to four members when Pardeza left for Zaragoza in 1986) and notable players like goalkeeper Francisco Buyo, right-back Miguel Porlán Chendo and Mexican striker Hugo Sánchez, Real Madrid had one of the best teams in Spain and Europe {{during the second half of}} the 1980s, winning two UEFA Cups, five Spanish championships in a row, one Spanish cup and three Spanish Super Cups. In the early 1990s, La Quinta del Buitre split up after Martín Vázquez, Emilio Butragueño and Míchel left the club.|$|E
5|$|The only {{surviving}} Hellenistic epic, the Argonautica of Apollonius of Rhodes (epic poet, scholar, {{and director}} of the Library of Alexandria) tells the myth of the voyage of Jason and the Argonauts to retrieve the Golden Fleece from the mythical land of Colchis. In the Argonautica, Jason is impelled on his quest by king Pelias, who receives a prophecy that a man with one sandal would be his nemesis. Jason loses a sandal in a river, arrives at the court of Pelias, and the epic is set in motion. Nearly every member of the next generation of heroes, as well as Heracles, went with Jason in the ship Argo to fetch the Golden Fleece. <b>This</b> <b>generation</b> also included Theseus, who went to Crete to slay the Minotaur; Atalanta, the female heroine, and Meleager, who once had an epic cycle of his own to rival the Iliad and Odyssey. Pindar, Apollonius and the Bibliotheca endeavor to give full lists of the Argonauts.|$|E
