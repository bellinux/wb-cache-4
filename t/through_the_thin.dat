5|$|Bats also {{possess a}} system of {{sphincter}} valves on the arterial side of the vascular network that runs {{along the edge of}} their wings. In the fully open state, these allow oxygenated blood to flow through the capillary network across the wing membrane, but when contracted, they shunt flow directly to the veins, bypassing the wing capillaries. This allows bats to control the amount of heat exchanged <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>thin</b> flight membrane, allowing them to release heat during flight. Many other mammals use the capillary network in oversized ears for the same purpose.|$|E
5|$|The Portland Basin {{is being}} pulled slowly apart between faults in the Tualatin Mountains (West Hills) {{on the west}} side of Portland, the East Bank fault along the east side of the Willamette River, and other fault systems near Gresham further east. About 3million years ago, many small volcanoes and cinder cones erupted <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>thin,</b> {{stretched}} crust of the basin and in the Cascade foothills to the southeast. Ash, cinders, and debris from these Boring Lava Field volcanoes added another layer of sediment to the Troutdale formation.|$|E

In a few cases, surgery was required to remove the Artecoll.|$|E
25|$|Grant had decided, however, {{that there}} was a more {{efficient}} way to get at Richmond and Lee. A few miles to the south, the city of Petersburg contained crucial rail links supplying the capital. If the Union Army could seize it, Richmond would be taken. However, Benjamin Butler had failed to capture it earlier and then indecisive advances by Grant's subordinates also failed to break <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>thin</b> lines manned by P.G.T.

50|$|The Apollo {{missions}} {{marked the}} first event where humans traveled <b>through</b> <b>the</b> Van Allen belts, {{which was one of}} several radiation hazards known by mission planners.

There was immediate, serious concern that the riverbed would crumble and reduce St. Anthony Falls to a long set of rapids. One witness remembered,Proprietors of stores hastened to the falls, taking their clerks with them; bakers deserted their ovens, lumbermen were ordered from the mills, barbers left their customers unshorn; mechanics dropped their tools; lawyers shut up their books or stopped pleading in the courts; physicians abandoned their offices.

25|$|Collecting oceanographic and hydrographic data en route, Seadragon transited the Barrow Strait, Viscount Melville Sound, and McClure Strait. On 21 August, she {{completed}} the first submarine transit of the Northwest Passage, entered the Beaufort Sea, {{and headed for}} the North Pole, which she reached on 25 August. The ship surfaced <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>thin</b> ice becoming the third submarine to surface at the pole. Members of the crew laid out a softball diamond with the pitcher's box at the pole where the captain claimed he hit a fly ball at 4:00pm on Wednesday and it wasn't caught until 4:00am on Thursday. From the pole, Seadragon (having no other choice) turned south, and after conducting experiments in cooperation with scientists on ice island T-3, headed for the Chukchi Sea and Bering Strait. On 5 September, she reached Nome, Alaska, and, nine days later, she arrived at her home port, Pearl Harbor. She was awarded the Navy Unit Commendation for her transit of the Northwest Passage via Parry Channel.|$|E

25|$|Mars Pathfinder {{directly}} entered Mars {{atmosphere in}} a retrograde direction from a hyperbolic trajectory at 6.1km/s using an atmospheric entry aeroshell (capsule) that {{was derived from}} the original Viking Mars lander design. The aeroshell consisted of a back shell and a specially designed ablative heatshield to slow to 370m/s (830mph) where a supersonic disk-gap-band parachute was inflated to slow its descent <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>thin</b> Martian atmosphere to 68m/s (about 160mph). The lander's on-board computer used redundant on-board accelerometers to determine the timing of the parachute inflation. Twenty seconds later the heatshield was pyrotechnically released. Another twenty seconds later the lander was separated and lowered from the backshell on a 20m bridle (tether). When the lander reached 1.6km above the surface, a radar was used by the on-board computer to determine altitude and descent velocity. This information was used by the computer to determine the precise timing of the landing events that followed.|$|E
25|$|During {{construction}} of the tunnel, on October 5, 1869, the river broke <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>thin</b> layer of limestone separating the river's bed from the tunnel. The rushing river scoured the tunnel, caving in parts of Hennepin Island and causing the earth supporting St. Anthony Falls to collapse upstream. There was serious concern that the riverbed would crumble and reduce St. Anthony Falls to a long set of rapids. Within a few weeks, dams were built to divert the river and stop St. Anthony Falls from being washed away. The fix was temporary as the 1870 spring floods damaged {{some of the new}} dams and swept away more of Hennepin Island. By late 1870, the riverbed and banks were stabilized and a wooden apron capped St. Anthony Falls to stop the upstream progression of the collapsing falls. As {{a direct result of the}} collapse of the Hennepin Island tunnel, St. Anthony Falls ultimately received a sloping concrete apron to create an artificial falls that are held out as the only major waterfall on the Mississippi River.|$|E

500|$|All the geysers {{observed}} {{were located}} between 50° and 57°S, {{the part of}} Triton's surface close to the subsolar point. This indicates that solar heating, although very weak at Triton's great distance from the Sun, plays a crucial role. It is thought that the surface of Triton probably consists of a translucent layer of frozen nitrogen overlying a darker substrate, which creates a kind of [...] "solid greenhouse effect". Solar radiation passes <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>thin</b> surface ice sheet, slowly heating and vaporizing subsurface nitrogen until enough gas pressure accumulates for it to erupt through the crust. A temperature increase of just 4K above the ambient surface temperature of 37K could drive eruptions to the heights observed. Although commonly termed [...] "cryovolcanic", this nitrogen plume activity is distinct from Triton's larger scale cryovolcanic eruptions, as well as volcanic processes on other worlds, which are powered by the internal heat {{of the body in}} question. Analogous CO2 geysers on Mars are thought to erupt from its south polar cap each spring.|$|E
500|$|Construction of both ships {{began in}} 1920, but the 1922 Washington Naval Treaty intervened, mandating the {{cancellation}} of all capital ships being built.

After being stricken on 1 April 1924, Tosas incomplete hull {{was used to test}} her armor scheme against long-range naval gunfire, aerial bombs, mines, and torpedoes. Two of the shells fired at her fell short, but deeply penetrated her hull <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>thin</b> armor of the torpedo bulge below the waterline armor belt. This sparked an interest in optimizing underwater performance of Japanese shells that culminated in production of the Type 91 armor-piercing shell. Conversely, the IJN took measures to defend against shells of this type when reconstructing its existing battleships during the 1930s, {{as well as in the}} designs of the s and the heavy cruisers of the Mogami and es. Tosas torpedo defense system proved able to defeat [...] torpedo warheads, but not larger [...] ones.
