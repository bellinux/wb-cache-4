5|$|Most pre-game {{media and}} popular {{coverage}} of the 2008 Orange Bowl focused on <b>the</b> <b>matchup</b> between Kansas's No.2 scoring offense and Virginia Tech's No.2 scoring defense. Outside factors, such as coaching, previous experience, and fan support were also considered in pre-game analysis of <b>the</b> <b>matchup.</b> Outside story lines included Virginia Tech's recovery from the Virginia Tech Massacre, recovery from late-season losses suffered by each team (against Missouri for Kansas and against Boston College for Virginia Tech).|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>matchup</b> of No.21 Indiana and No.22 Virginia Tech was {{the first}} matchup of ranked teams in Independence Bowl history. Despite that fact, the bowl had {{difficulty}} selling tickets for the game. Slightly more than 33,000tickets were sold by {{the day of the}} game, far less than the stadium's 50,459-seat capacity. In exchange for their participation in the game, each team received $700,000, the minimum payout required by the NCAA at that time. Spread bettors favored Virginia Tech to win by three points. <b>The</b> <b>matchup</b> was Indiana's first time playing Virginia Tech, and {{was the first}} time Virginia Tech played any team from the Big Ten.|$|E

5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1986, the Metro Atlanta Chamber of Commerce (MACOC) took over the Peach Bowl. The bowl {{executive}} director {{at the time was}} Dick Bestwick, and he encouraged the Chamber to step up its support of the game over what had been provided by the Lions Club. In 1986, the Peach Bowl had no contractual obligations with college football conferences, as its successor, the Chick-fil-A Bowl, does today. Team selections were made by the Peach Bowl committee, a board of Atlanta community members, business leaders, and organizers of the Peach Bowl. To form one half of <b>the</b> <b>matchup,</b> the committee selected second-place Atlantic Coast Conference team NC State, which accepted the bowl bid on November 22, 1986, the day of their final regular-season game. The other half of <b>the</b> <b>matchup</b> was Virginia Tech, a football independent that had finished with nine wins, one loss, and one tie during the regular season and received its invitation one week after the regular season concluded.|$|E
5|$|Miami Dolphins owner Joe Robbie {{canceled}} the yearly preseason matchup in Tampa, {{claiming that the}} Buccaneers approached <b>the</b> <b>matchup</b> with excessive intensity, resulting in Dolphin injuries. A dispute with Buccaneers owner Hugh Culverhouse was also a factor, as Culverhouse was promoting a proposed rule to ban NFL owners and their families from holding controlling interest in other sports teams.

5|$|Ryan {{was known}} for a notorious {{incident}} at a Carolina Hurricanes game, as he attended <b>the</b> <b>matchup</b> with the Florida Panthers sporting a throwback Philadelphia Flyers jersey on. Upon being recognized by the fans at the arena, the team's cheerleaders approached him with a Hurricanes alternate jersey sported by the team. The incident was noted as he was seen taking off the jersey and baring his chest for the crowd to see.|$|E
5|$|The {{other half}} of <b>the</b> <b>matchup</b> would consist of either Notre Dame or the first {{selection}} from the Big East Conference after that conference's automatic BCS bid. Because Notre Dame was selected {{to play in the}} 2006 Fiesta Bowl, a BCS game, the Gator Bowl Association was required to select the Big East's Louisville Cardinals, which, like Virginia Tech, finished second in their conference.|$|E
5|$|Blount {{started off}} the 2011 season with only 5 carries for 15 yards against the Detroit Lions. The next week Blount {{reestablished}} his strong running ability with 13 carries for 71 {{yards and two}} touchdowns against the Minnesota Vikings. This includes the game-winning touchdown with 30 seconds left to play. In a Week 5 against the 49ers, Blount injured his knee after accumulating only 15 yards rushing and was forced to miss weeks 6 and 7. Blount would ultimately return for <b>the</b> <b>matchup</b> with the New Orleans Saints. On November 20, 2011, Blount broke free from eight Green Bay Packers tacklers and scored on a 54-yard touchdown run.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{defeating}} the Maroons, the PCHA champions were not eliminated. Rather, the Tigers earned a bye into the finals, while Vancouver met the Montreal Canadiens in the semi-final. The blue, blanc et rouge swept Vancouver in two games, setting <b>the</b> <b>matchup</b> for the 1924 Stanley Cup Finals where the Canadiens easily handled the Tigers. In the first game, played at Mount Royal Arena in Montreal, Canadiens rookie Howie Morenz recorded a hat trick as Montreal won 6–1. Due to poor ice conditions, {{the second game}} {{was moved to the}} Ottawa Auditorium in Ottawa. Led by goaltender Georges Vezina, Montreal won 3–0 to sweep the series, and claim the Cup.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{proximity}} of the two schools, the 2009 Chick-fil-A Bowl was only their eighth football meeting. Tennessee held a 5-2 advantage in the series, but before 1994, the last meeting between them was in 1937. The 1994 meeting was in the 1994 Gator Bowl, which the Volunteers won 45-23. Each school rapidly sold its allotment of 17,000 tickets, and publicly available tickets were sold out before <b>the</b> <b>matchup</b> was announced. This gave the Chick-fil-A Bowl its 13th consecutive sellout.|$|E
5|$|Game three {{was also}} {{held at the}} Polo Grounds. With each team having won one game, {{it was time for}} a matchup between the two teams' ace {{pitchers}}. Sal Maglie was on the mound for New York, while Brooklyn called on Don Newcombe; both pitchers had winning records against the opposing team heading into <b>the</b> <b>matchup.</b> After Maglie walked two batters in the top of the first inning, Jackie Robinson singled, scoring the game's first run when Pee Wee Reese crossed home plate. No further hits were allowed until the bottom of the second, when Whitey Lockman and Bobby Thomson singled; neither scored, and it remained 1–0 through two innings.|$|E

5|$|Georgia Tech had {{an intense}} rivalry with the University of Alabama which ended during Bobby Dodd's tenure as head {{football}} coach. Until that time, <b>the</b> <b>matchup</b> between the Crimson Tide and the Yellow Jackets was a fall football classic. The two teams have {{met on the}} gridiron a total of 52 times with Georgia Tech coming away victorious in 21 of those matchups, with 3 ties. Bobby Dodd's football teams won 7 of 17 games played against Alabama. The contests were annual events until Georgia Tech withdrew from the SEC.|$|E
5|$|In the 2008 World Series, which {{featured}} the Philadelphia Phillies and Tampa Bay Rays, Culbreth worked behind home plate for Game 3.

In Game 3 of the 2012 World Series, Culbreth umpired behind the plate for <b>the</b> <b>matchup</b> between the Detroit Tigers and the San Francisco Giants. The Giants shut out the Tigers, 2–0. San Francisco won the World Series in the next game.|$|E
5|$|In {{the days}} {{immediately}} following the announcement of <b>the</b> <b>matchup,</b> ticket sales diverged. By December 12, Cincinnati sold about 9,000 tickets. This total increased to approximately 13,000 tickets by December 20, and the school prepared multiple tour buses for a student convoy to the game. At Virginia Tech, meanwhile, sales lagged. In an effort to spur sales, Tech administrators had head football coach Frank Beamer star in a video asking Hokies fans to buy tickets to the game. Owing to limited demand for tickets, prices in the secondary market plunged.|$|E

5|$|Virginia Tech was {{selected}} {{to participate in the}} 2011 Orange Bowl after an 11-2 regular season that culminated with a 44-33 win in the 2010 ACC Championship Game, clinching the Atlantic Coast Conference championship and an automatic BCS bid. Stanford was picked as the other half of <b>the</b> <b>matchup</b> following an 11-1 campaign that included the school's best-ever regular-season record. That performance earned the Cardinal a No. 4 ranking in the BCS Poll and the automatic bid to a BCS game that accompanies that status. In the weeks before the game, media attention focused on both teams' turnarounds from historical difficulties and the performance of Stanford quarterback Andrew Luck.|$|E
