After maintaining peak winds for about five days, <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> weakened, by which time it curved to the northeast. On September20, it moved ashore in Taylor County, Florida and later crossed the state. <b>The</b> <b>storm</b> dissipated on September21 just off the Georgia coast.|$|E
5|$|Ahead of <b>the</b> <b>storm,</b> the Guam National Weather Service {{issued a}} typhoon watch for Agrihan, Pagan, and Alamagan, {{as well as}} a high surf {{advisory}} for Guam. The watch was later upgraded to a warning, and was canceled after the typhoon exited the region. Flights were delayed or canceled to the region due to <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> and problems with the local aircraft communication system. During <b>the</b> <b>storm,</b> there were minor power outages on Saipan in two villages that were quickly restored. On Alamagan where <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> struck, six people rode out <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> in a concrete bunker.|$|E
5|$|Although a {{powerful}} cyclone over water, <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> had relatively little impact over land. In the Valsad district, two coastal communities lost a combined 200 homes due to large swells produced by <b>the</b> <b>storm.</b> However, the losses were more extensive offshore. Between 120 and 900 fishermen were listed as missing after contact was lost with their vessels during <b>the</b> <b>storm.</b>|$|E

5|$|Around 0000UTC on September25, the {{disturbance}} was sufficiently organized to be declared a tropical depression. Shortly after, the NHC issued their first advisory {{on the system}} as it intensified into a tropical storm, assigning it the name Kyle. The center of <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> was slightly elongated but moderate wind shear continued to impact the circulation. Kyle track northward {{in response to an}} area of high pressure east of Bermuda and an area of low pressure along the eastern United States. The sheared structure of <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> led to problems with recording the intensity of <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> throughout the day. Hurricane Hunters continuously flew into <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> to record information; however, their estimates were considered too high as <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> was disorganized.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} September 13, {{residents}} were made {{aware that a}} storm might strike parts of Ireland with hurricane-force winds. Two days later, forecasters believed <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> would take a more southerly course towards France. This forecast was later withdrawn as <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> failed to turn eastward. Consequently, gale warnings were issued for much of western Ireland {{on the morning of}} September 16, hours before the brunt of <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> arrived. Fearing building collapses, officials in County Galway closed markets for the duration of <b>the</b> <b>storm.</b>|$|E
5|$|Brazilian meteorologists named <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> Catarina for its {{proximity}} to (and eventual landfall near) the state of Santa Catarina, although government forecasters initially denied that <b>the</b> <b>storm,</b> which clearly had an open eye and various other tropical morphologies, was a hurricane at all.

5|$|Early on August 27, <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> {{weakened}} below {{tropical storm}} status and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone while moving over cooler waters.

In Jacksonville, Florida, <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> produced 0.47 in (11.9 mm) of rain on August 25.

At least 60people perished and 2,000 others were injured across the country. Offshore, 150 fishermen went missing during <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> and were feared dead.

5|$|Offshore Virginia, swells {{generated}} by <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> stranded a tugboat and injured two people. Waves {{along the coast}} also caused beach erosion, especially in Virginia and North Carolina. Inland, effects were minor and generally limited to mostly light rainfall. More than 100campers on the Outer Banks of North Carolina were forced to evacuate due to flooding on North Carolina Highway 12. Although near-hurricane-force wind gusts pelted coastal areas of Virginia and North Carolina, wind damage from <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> was minimal. The remnants of <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> brought rainfall to portions of New England, especially to Connecticut, where precipitation from <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> peaked at 4.62in (117mm). Damage from <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> was unknown, but presumed to be minimal.|$|E

5|$|Physically, the {{cyclonic}} {{circulation of}} <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> advects environmental air poleward east of center and equatorial west of center.

The combined flow of these gyres acts to advect <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> slowly poleward and westward. This effect occurs {{even if there}} is zero environmental flow.|$|E
5|$|The China Meteorological Administration {{released}} {{a press release}} after <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> and gave four reasons for the extensive damage. First, <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> decelerated after landfall and maintained its identity for 120hours while moving south of due west. Secondly, <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> was asymmetric and rainfall concentrated in the southern semicircle. Also, <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> interacted with the active monsoon over the South China Sea, and the Hong Kong Observatory reported a 1-hour rainfall total of 115.1mm (4.5inches), a new record. Finally, previous rainfall had made the area wetter than normal and more prone to flooding.|$|E
