2500|$|Erratics {{are formed}} by glacial ice erosion {{resulting}} from the movement of ice. Glaciers erode by multiple processes: abrasion/scouring, plucking, ice thrusting and glacially-induced spalling.

In an abrasion process, debris in the basal ice scrapes along the bed, polishing and gouging the underlying rocks, similar <b>to</b> <b>sandpaper</b> on wood, producing smaller glacial till. [...] In ice thrusting, the glacier freezes to its bed, then as it surges forward, it moves large sheets of frozen sediment at the base along with the glacier. Glacially-induced spalling occurs when ice lens formation with the rocks below the glacier spall off layers of rock, providing smaller debris which is ground into the glacial basal material to become till.|$|E

50|$|The {{most notable}} {{advantage}} of the scary sharp system is speed and cost. Anyone with access <b>to</b> <b>sandpaper</b> and a reasonably flat surface can sharpen any cutting tool, often with good results. Unlike traditional stones, no maintenance {{is required for the}} scary-sharp set-up, since the sharpening surface does not form a hollow with repeated, uneven usage. A hollowed surface is undesirable in most sharpening situations, an example being the flat surface required in the back (as opposed to the beveled surface) of most woodworking plane irons. Compared to stones, sandpaper is lower in cost as well. A fresh sheet of sandpaper often cuts significantly faster than a bench sharpening stone. For this reason, coarse-grit papers can be used to dress damaged cutting edge quickly, removing chips along the edge and preparing it for the next stage/grit of edge refinement.|$|E

50|$|Glaciers erode {{predominantly}} {{by three}} different processes: abrasion/scouring, plucking, and ice thrusting. In an abrasion process, debris in the basal ice scrapes along the bed, polishing and gouging the underlying rocks, similar <b>to</b> <b>sandpaper</b> on wood. Scientists have shown that, {{in addition to}} the role of temperature played in valley-deepening, other glaciological processes, such as erosion also control cross-valley variations. In a homogeneous bedrock erosion pattern, curved channel cross section beneath the ice is created. Though the glacier continues to incise vertically, the shape of the channel beneath the ice eventually remain constant, reaching a U-shaped parabolic steady-state shape as we now see in glaciated valleys. Scientists also provide numerical estimate of the time required for the ultimate formation of a steady-shaped U-shaped valley - approximately 100,000 years. In a weak bedrock (containing material more erodible than the surrounding rocks) erosion pattern, on the contrary, the amount of overdeepening is limited because ice velocities and erosion rates are reduced.|$|E
50|$|Development {{of these}} growths occurs when skin is {{constantly}} {{exposed to the}} sun over time. They usually appear as thick, scaly, or crusty areas that often feel dry or rough. In fact, AKs are often felt before they are seen, and the texture is often compared <b>to</b> <b>sandpaper.</b> They may be dark, light, tan, pink, red, {{a combination of all}} these, or have the same color as the surrounding skin. An actinic keratosis lesion commonly ranges between 2 and 6 millimeters in size but can grow to be a few centimeters in diameter. They often appear on sun-exposed areas of the skin, such as the face, ears, neck, scalp, chest, backs of hands, forearms, or lips. Because they are related to sun-damage on the skin, most people who have an AK have more than one. Often, large areas of sun-exposed skin are diagnosed with a continuum of multiple clinically visible AKs of different sizes and severities, typically accompanied by subclinical lesions that become apparent only in biopsies. This concept of a skin area showing multiple AKs is termed field cancerization.|$|E

40|$|Enhancing the {{hydrophobicity}} {{of organic}} coatings retards their interaction {{with water and}} often leads to better protectiveness over metal corrosion. In this study, a soft lithography method was used to prepare epoxy coatings which showed surface microstructures in high replication <b>to</b> <b>sandpapers.</b> The effect of microstructures on coating’s hydrophobicity and barrier property was investigated. Compared to flat coatings, the microstructured coatings showed much higher water contact angles, which further increased with finer sandpapers. Determined by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), the flat coating exhibited a higher anticorrosive performance than the microstructured coatings. With the use of finer sandpaper, the groove size of the corresponding microstructured coating was reduced. And a lower anticorrosive performance was observed since more defects might be formed in a given area of coating during the imprinting process. As the groove size of the coatings was further decreased to 5. 7 [*]µm, the microstructures became too small for water to easily penetrate through. Therefore, trapped air acted as an additional barrier and contributed to an increased anticorrosive performance compared to other microstructured coatings...|$|R

40|$|Mobile {{computing}} devices (e. g., smartphones and tablets) {{that have}} low-friction surfaces require well-directed fingertip forces of sufficient and precise magnitudes for proper use. Although general impairments in manual dexterity are well-documented in older adults, {{it is unclear}} how these sensorimotor impairments influence the ability of older adults to dexterously manipulate fixed, low-friction surfaces in particular. 21 young and 18 older (65 + yrs) adults produced maximal voluntary contractions (MVCs) and steady submaximal forces (2. 5 and 10 % MVC) with the fingertip of the index finger. A Teflon covered custom-molded splint was placed on the fingertip. A three-axis force sensor was covered with either Teflon or sandpaper to create low- and high-friction surfaces, respectively. Maximal downward forces (F(z)) were similar (p =. 135) for young and older adults, and decreased by 15 % (p<. 001) while pressing on Teflon compared <b>to</b> <b>sandpaper.</b> Fluctuations in F(z) during the submaximal force-matching tasks were 2. 45 × greater (p<. 001) for older adults than in young adults, and reached a maximum when older adults pressed against the Teflon surface while receiving visual feedback. These age-associated changes in motor performance are explained, in part, by altered muscle activity from three hand muscles and out-of-plane forces. Quantifying the ability to produce steady fingertip forces against low-friction surfaces may be a better indicator of impairment and disability than the current practice of evaluating maximal forces with pinch meters. These age-associated impairments in dexterity while interacting with low-friction surfaces may limit the use of the current generation of computing interfaces by older adults...|$|E

Methods. The Self-Adjusting File (ReDent-Nova, Raanana, Israel) is a new system of cleaning, shaping and irrigation in the root canals treatment. The SAF is the first hollow file cylindrical, made of a nickel-titanium lattice with a rough external surface, compressible, that adapts itself to the shape of the canal. The SAF is used as a single instrument to achieve complete 3 D root canal cleaning and shaping in a minimally invasive way. Its hollow shape allows for the continuous flow of irrigant through its lumen to achieve superior disinfection. The SAF compresses to adapt to the root canal anatomy. Its attempt to re-expand shapes the canal by applying light continuous pressure along the entire circumference of the root canal wall. Thanks to a vibration in the vertical direction associated with a rotation without torque allows us to obtain uniform removal of a layer of dentine from the surface of canal. The SAF’s abrasive surface acts similarly <b>to</b> <b>sandpaper</b> by scrubbing uniformly and gradually enlarging the root canal circumferentially. The SAF is extremely flexible and compressible. It does not impose its shape on the canal, but rather adapts to the canal’s original shape. This is true both circumferentially and longitudinally, thus keeping the long axis of the canal in its original position. In our study we selected elements of the series deciduous and permanent with a wide open apex. In all cases, the elements presented periapical lesion.

40|$|Weed {{communities}} in agronomic fields {{are dominated by}} annual species. Summer annuals initiate growth each spring from seeds found in the upper soil profile (Figure 1). In most fields, {{a small percentage of}} the emerging plants survive and contribute new seeds to the soil seedbank. Historically, most research of the annual weed life cycle has focused on seed dormancy and emergence (A), effect of control tactics on weed survival (B), and weed seed production (C). The fate of seeds between the time of maturation on the plant and entering the seedbank (D) has largely been ignored. However, current research at Iowa State University and other organizations has shown that significant seed losses routinely occur in agronomic fields, and these losses may influence the effectiveness of weed management programs. This article will provide a brief summary of some of the current research in this area and the potential importance of seed predation to weed management. seedlings.
