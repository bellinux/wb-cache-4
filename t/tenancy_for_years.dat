50|$|After discussing, {{in their}} logical order, other {{freehold}} interests in land, he passes to interests in land that were called by later writers interests less than freehold - namely, <b>tenancies</b> <b>for</b> terms of <b>years</b> and tenancies at will. With {{the exception of}} tenancy from year to year, now so familiar to us, but which was a judicial creation of a date later than the time of Littleton, the first book is a complete statement {{of the principles of}} the common law, as they, for the most part, existed until 1925, governing and regulating interests in lands. The first book concludes with a very interesting chapter on copyhold tenures, which marks the exact point at which the tenant—by-copy-of-court-roll, the successor of the villein, who, in his turn, represented the freeman reduced to villeinage by the growth of the manorial system, acquired security of tenure.|$|R

50|$|A <b>tenancy</b> <b>for</b> <b>years</b> is {{a simple}} {{illustration}} of a reversion interest {{in the context of}} leasing arrangements. An owner of real-property becomes a lessor by transferring a bundle of rights - including a right of entry - to the leasee for a certain period of time. The lessor typically retains a reversion interest in the property which will mature after the lease expires. A common example of this transaction is the leasing of an apartment to a tenant for a one-year period. When the lease expires, the rights of the leasee are terminated and exclusive ownership of the property returns to the lessor.|$|E
50|$|A {{tenant farmer}} {{is one who}} resides on land owned by a landlord. Tenant farming is an {{agricultural}} production system in which landowners contribute their land and often a measure of operating capital and management; while tenant farmers contribute their labor along with at times varying amounts of capital and management. Depending on the contract, tenants can make payments to the owner either of a fixed portion of the product, in cash or in a combination. The rights the tenant has over the land, the form, and measure of the payment varies across systems (geographically and chronologically). In some systems, the tenant could be evicted at whim (tenancy at will); in others, the landowner and tenant sign a contract for a fixed number of years (<b>tenancy</b> <b>for</b> <b>years</b> or indenture). In most developed countries today, at least some restrictions are placed {{on the rights of}} landlords to evict tenants under normal circumstances.|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} to banning smoking in multi-unit housing residences such as apartment buildings and condos, smoke-free housing laws usually change terms of <b>tenancy</b> <b>for</b> rental units, {{making it a}} lease violation to smoke in a nonsmoking unit. These lease changes are automatic for new leases and upon renewal for existing leases. Declaring secondhand smoke as a nuisance is another option for city and county governments.|$|R

40|$|This {{literature}} review focuses on recent and contemporary tenancy structures in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. <b>Tenancy</b> <b>for</b> {{purposes of this}} review is broadly defined to include different leasing arrangements such sharecropping, labor tenancy, fixed cash rentals, and reverse leasing.

The purpose of this {{literature review}} {{is to provide a}} basis for evaluation of the desirability, feasibility, and potential content of regulatory guidelines for lease agreements that might permit the land-lease market to operate effectively. The works discussed herein are both theoretical and empirical. We have attempted to locate the most recent literature on <b>tenancy</b> <b>for</b> Asia, Africa, and Latin America.

5000|$|A {{proposal}} to abolish secure tenancies {{and replace them}} with fixed term tenancies lasting between two and five years. However, following an amendment, this was later extended to tenancies of up to 10 years with the possibility of <b>for</b> longer <b>tenancies</b> <b>for</b> families with children. The Act requires where there is a succession to the tenancy that unless they are a spouse or civil partner the new tenancy has to be fixed term rather than secure.
