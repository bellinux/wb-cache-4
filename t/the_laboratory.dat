40|$|The {{end of the}} Cold War {{has called}} into {{question}} the activities of <b>the</b> national <b>laboratories</b> and, more generally, the level of support now given to federal intramural research in the United States. This paper seeks to analyze the potential role of <b>the</b> <b>laboratories,</b> with {{particular attention to the}} possibility, on the one hand, of integrating private technology development into <b>the</b> <b>laboratory’s</b> menu of activities and, on the other hand, of outsourcing traditional mission activities. We review the economic efficiency arguments for intramural research and the political conditions that are likely to constrain the activities of <b>the</b> <b>laboratories,</b> and analyze <b>the</b> early history of programs intended to promote new technology via cooperative agreements between <b>the</b> <b>laboratories</b> and private industry.

5|$|Bradbury {{took charge}} at Los Alamos at a {{difficult}} time. Staff were leaving in droves, living conditions were poor {{and there was}} a possibility that <b>the</b> <b>laboratory</b> would close. He managed to persuade enough staff to stay, and got the University of California to renew the contract to manage <b>the</b> <b>laboratory.</b> He pushed continued development of nuclear weapons, transforming them from laboratory devices to production models. Numerous improvements made them safer, more reliable and easier to store and handle, and made more efficient use of scarce fissionable materiel.|$|E

5|$|Francium was {{discovered}} by Marguerite Perey in France (from which the element takes its name) in 1939. It was the last element first discovered in nature, rather than by synthesis. Outside <b>the</b> <b>laboratory,</b> francium is extremely rare, with trace amounts found in uranium and thorium ores, where the isotope francium-223 continually forms and decays. As little as 20–30g (one ounce) exists {{at any given time}} throughout the Earth's crust; the other isotopes (except for francium-221) are entirely synthetic. The largest amount produced in <b>the</b> <b>laboratory</b> was a cluster of more than 300,000 atoms.|$|E
5|$|In early 2001, Boisselier {{promised the}} cloning {{of a human}} child within a year, drawing further {{attention}} to her work. A prosecutor in New York began investigating her compliance with local medical laws. Boisselier said that the Food and Drug Administration also surreptitiously investigated her, and Raël claimed that U.S. President George W. Bush was concerned about Clonaid's work. The caretaker of <b>the</b> <b>laboratory</b> that Hunt had rented grew suspicious about their work and contacted law enforcement. They spoke with the FDA, who searched the site and persuaded Boisselier to suspend her cloning work pending legal clarification. After Hunt {{was asked by the}} laboratory's caretaker to shut down the cloning operation, he broke with Boisselier and criticized her for seeking media attention. The caretaker also spoke publicly, saying that Boisselier was seldom at <b>the</b> <b>laboratory.</b> Boisselier then announced that she was moving her cloning operations overseas.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} {{similarities and differences}} between students’ experience in the research-based and traditional <b>laboratory.</b> <b>The</b> goal was to determine if <b>the</b> students’ <b>laboratory</b> experience influenced their {{understanding of the nature of}} experiments and experimental design. The data suggest that the students’ experiences differed between <b>the</b> <b>laboratories,</b> which resulted in students reporting different learning gains. The data support the idea that <b>the</b> research-based <b>laboratory</b> is more cognitively challenging compared to <b>the</b> traditional <b>laboratory.</b> <b>The</b> research-based <b>laboratory</b> required <b>the</b> students to develop hypotheses and investigations to explore their hypotheses. This process is missing from <b>the</b> traditional <b>laboratory.</b> In addition to being a cognitively challenging experience, <b>the</b> research-based <b>laboratory</b> also affords students the opportunity to use creativity which helped to enhance students’ understanding of the use of creativity by scientists. Neither laboratory was superior to the other for the facilitation of students’ understanding of hypotheses. In addition, students in both groups showed similar experimental design abilities. ...|$|R

Following Gates' resignation in 1918, the school ceased to offer its summer beekeeping school, many of its state extension services, and the college went through several different professors before hiring Frank R.

40|$|The {{development}} of university biological laboratories Between 1850 and 1880 every Dutch university was furnished with a botanical and zoological <b>laboratory.</b> <b>The</b> new institutions owed their existence to initiatives of the professors concerned. <b>The</b> <b>laboratories</b> were {{first of all}} intended to satisfy the growing demand for practical instruction.
