40|$|The {{following}} {{article is}} {{an analysis of}} designed processes {{of the life cycle}} of the most popular fuel for Diesel engines: diesel oil. This fuel is produced from petroleum, which is a non-renewable source of energy.

The life cycle of diesel was divided into five unit processes: petroleum extraction, transport of petroleum to the refinery, refining petroleum to <b>diesel,</b> <b>transport</b> of <b>diesel</b> to the recipient and utilization of delivered fuel by transport company. For every process the energy consumption and emission of carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides and sulphursulphur oxides was calculated, with assumption of probable data, that could occur in real processes.

30|$|Traffic and {{particularly}} road traffic had early {{been identified as}} one of the main GHG emission sources (see above). However, since heavy-duty vehicles (trucks) are propelled by diesel engines with hardly any alternative (despite busses and local heavy-duty traffic), the automobile sector has been identified early as the sector in which a technology shift from gasoline to diesel engines may ensure significant GHG savings. GHG emitted by automobiles are expressed in CO 2 equivalents, which are usually quantified by summarizing the three GHG CO 2, CH 4 and N 2 O emitted by fuel provision and combustion. However, CH 4 - plus N 2 O-related CO 2 equivalents amount to less than 2 % of CO 2 emissions[21]. The European Environmental Agency (EEA) considers only one parameter of both CH 4 and N 2 O in calculating the CO 2 equivalents of road <b>transport</b> <b>diesel</b> oil and gasoline fuel, respectively, resulting in only around 1 % deviation of CO 2 emissions[22]. Direct CO 2 passenger-car emissions may thus be considered here since they equal GHG emissions with a low error rate.|$|E
30|$|In the LCT scenario, {{the energy}} demand is {{decreased}} and switched from fossil fuels to biofuels {{as well as}} electricity. In the passenger transport, the main fuels are gasoline and gasohol in the base year whereas biofuels will be the major fuel consumed in the long run. CH 4 and N 2 O emissions from biofuel combustion are {{higher than that of}} fossil fuels. Although the contribution of these emissions are minor when compared to CO 2 emission, the drastic increase of biofuels utilization in passenger transport in the LCT scenario results in the increase of N 2 O emissions, which show an average annual growth rate of 4.40  %. In the freight <b>transport,</b> <b>diesel</b> and CNG are mainly used in the base year and they will be switched to biofuels, but not significantly. The average increasing N 2 O emission from effective freight actions is 2.86  % per year during 2005 – 2050. The reduction of LPG and CNG in the LCT scenario strongly affects CH 4 emissions. CH 4 emission from smart passenger actions increases from 3.26 kt-CO 2 eq in 2005 to 4.59 kt-CO 2 eq whereas the reduction on LPG and CNG in effective freight actions results in the decrease of CH 4 emissions from 1.23 kt-CO 2 eq in 2005 to 1.00 kt-CO 2 eq in 2050.|$|E

40|$|Standalone diesel {{systems have}} been widely used on Malaysian islands due to the {{isolated}} locations of the islands. Nevertheless, the high diesel prices and the high cost of <b>transporting</b> <b>diesel</b> to islands cause the use of standalone diesel systems to be uneconomical. This study analyzes the feasibility of implementing PV (photovoltaic) systems as alternatives to standalone diesel systems by considering the effects of annual real interest rates, diesel prices and load sizes, using the HOMER (hybrid optimization of multiple energy resources) software. The results indicate that, at the ordinary diesel price of $ 0. 61 /L, low interest rates (0 - 3 %) are desirable for the implementation of hybrid PV/diesel with battery systems over standalone diesel systems, regardless of the load sizes. Although different load sizes may affect the decisions on the implementation of PV systems at higher interest rates (6 - 9 %), these effects become less pronounced as the price of diesel increases to $ 1. 22 /L or higher. Also, under high diesel prices, the choice of optimal system configurations obtained for small load sizes should be applicable for larger load sizes, albeit with different component ratings. Although the current study is intended for Malaysian islands, the findings can be generalized for other places with similar solar radiation levels...|$|R
