500|$|Early plans {{called for}} a tunnel running from before the McLean station to beyond the Spring Hill station, with all four {{stations}} in between being below ground. When the contractor hired to design the Silver Line– a consortium of Bechtel and Washington Group International– found the costs to be too high, the design was changed to use a short tunnel, running only between the Tysons Corner and Greensboro stations (underneath higher ground) with all four stations being at or above ground. In March 2006, the contractor was ordered to examine an alternative [...] "large bore" [...] <b>tunnel</b> <b>digging</b> technique (successfully used in Europe) {{with the potential to}} lower costs of a tunnel through the entire Tysons section. The contractor found that there would not be a significant cost reduction and proposed staying with the short tunnel option.|$|E

5000|$|The first {{project was}} the {{construction}} of a [...] "warehouse", which acted as a disguise for a US Army ELINT station. The warehouse, in the Neukölln/Rudow district of the American Sector of Berlin, had an unconventionally deep basement at 7 m to serve as the staging area for the <b>tunnel.</b> <b>Digging</b> the initial vertical shaft for the tunnel began on 2 September, 1954 and was completed on 25 February the following year.|$|E

Most of the work on the <b>tunnel</b> <b>digging</b> was done by hand and provided by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930s. Little machinery was used with the intention of creating manual labor in depressed economic times. They did have for tunneling truck-mounted water-cooled compressed air drills called [...] "Jumbos." [...] After the initial holes were drilled into the substrata, dynamite was used for blasting away the rock.|$|E
50|$|Canadian {{authorities}} did not tip off the POWs and detected {{signs of}} <b>tunnel</b> <b>digging</b> at Camp 30. All prisoners except one were arrested {{at the time}} of their escape attempt; the sole inmate who managed to escape travelled all the way to Pointe de Maisonette undetected, likely travelling onboard Canadian National Railway passenger trains to the Bathurst area. This POW was apprehended by military police and RCMP on the beach in front of the lighthouse on the night of the planned U-boat extraction.|$|E
50|$|The {{technical}} {{difficulties of the}} work were remarkable. It is necessary to consider that {{at an altitude of}} 2,882 meters the snow cover is present for about eight months a year, therefore the working times were necessarily concentrated on the summer, but when violent meteorological events may occur. In addition to that at that time the explosive devices, which were considered fundamental to the excavation of galleries, were totally unknown; Moreover, since techniques that enabled accurate topographical relief were not known, the attack on the <b>tunnel</b> <b>digging</b> was carried forward, probably from one end, at great expense to the execution speed.Finally, the small section of the one yard allowed a very limited use of manpower, with a maximum of two or three men in the advancement front.|$|E

5000|$|The initial {{location}} for {{the north end of}} the tunnel was near Lyons Station Stagecoach Stop, which was abandoned due to frequent cave-ins caused by oil soaked rock. The north end was moved a little further west towards the present town of Newhall, California. The north end of the tunnel excavation commenced in June 1875. Water was a constant problem during construction and pumps were utilized to keep the tunnel from flooding. Workers digging from both the north and south ends of the tunnel came face to face on July 14, 1876. The bores from each end were only a half inch out of line with dimensions of 22 ft high, 16.5 ft wide at the bottom and over 18 ft at the shoulders. [...] Track was laid in place during the <b>tunnel</b> <b>dig</b> and was used to remove dirt and rock by horse pulled cars. The first train passed through the tunnel on August 12, 1876. On September 4 Charles Crocker notified Southern Pacific that the track had been completed on the route between San Francisco and Los Angeles.|$|R
