40|$|The seed {{systems of}} RTB (root, tuber, and banana) crops are unique {{because they are}} {{propagated}} from vegetative parts of the plant, not from <b>true</b> <b>seed.</b> RTB seed is thus bulkier, more perishable, and more subject to the attacks of pests and diseases than is <b>true</b> <b>seed.</b> Because of this, {{there is often a}} gap between potential and real crop yields, which seed interventions seek to narrow. Seed systems are formal or informal networks of people and organizations that produce, plant, and distribute seed. Informal systems may deliver low quality seed, but not always.

Nested-PCR worked well for Xam detection from naturally infected seeds. This technique was specific, sensitive, and rapid for detecting Xam in cassava <b>true</b> <b>seeds.</b> The highest detection level found was 1 2 viable cells per reaction.

Overall sensitivity of the dot-blot method was about 103 CFU per reaction. The dot-blot hybridization technique can be easily used for culture indexing.

40|$|Compared {{to other}} major food crops, {{progress}} in potato yield {{as the result}} of breeding efforts is very slow. Genetic gains cannot be fixed in potato due to obligatory out-breeding. Overcoming inbreeding depression using diploid self-compatible clones should enable to replace the current method of out-breeding and clonal propagation into an F 1 hybrid system with <b>true</b> <b>seeds.</b> This idea is not new, but has long been considered unrealistic. Severe inbreeding depression and self-incompatibility in diploid germplasm have hitherto blocked the development of inbred lines. Back-crossing with a homozygous progenitor with the Sli gene which inhibits gametophytic self-incompatibility gave self-compatible offspring from elite material from our diploid breeding programme. We demonstrate that homozygous fixation of donor alleles is possible, with simultaneous improvement of tuber shape and tuber size grading of the recipient inbred line. These results provide proof of principle for F 1 hybrid potato breeding. The technical and economic perspectives are unprecedented as these will enable the development of new products with combinations of useful traits for all stakeholders in the potato chain.

DNA constructs containing the uid reporter gene coding for b-glucuronidase (GUS) driven by a 35 S promoter or a tCUP promoter were introduced into alfalfa via Agrobacterium-mediated genetic transformation. Somatic embryos were subsequently induced from transgenic alfalfa plants via in vitro technology.

40|$|Use of somatic or {{synthetic}} seed is {{of potential}} interest as a micropropagation tool for superior conifer genotypes. However, whether naked or encapsulated, {{the most important}} criterion is that the asexual embryo or somatic seed {{must be able to}} simulate the zygotic embryo or <b>true</b> <b>seed.</b> This study attempted a comparison of the somatic embryo of Norway spruce (Picea abies) with its zygotic counterpart. A major finding was that the percentage germination of fresh or somatic embryos partially desiccated at relative humidities of 97 % and 63 % to moisture contents approaching those of the seed, was substantially lower. It further declined rapidly with either cold storage and/or encapsulation. This sensitivity to drying suggests that the somatic embryo/seed may behave either as an orthodox seed with limited ability to withstand desiccation or as a recalcitrant seed that cannot survive drying below a moisture content that is relatively high. As the megagametophyte contains > 80 % of the seed’s total lipid and protein reserves, the carbon and amino acid pools available to the zygotic embryo far exceed those accessible to the somatic embryo. The conclusions are: (1) in Norway spruce the somatic seed, lacking a suitable artificial megagametophyte, does not simulate the <b>true</b> <b>seed,</b> and (2) the somatic embryo, if it behaves like an isolated zygotic embryo cultured in vitro, does so with greatly reduced physiological vigour...|$|R
