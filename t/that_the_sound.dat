5|$|Right before Van Halen's guitar solo begins, a {{noise is}} heard {{that sounds like}} {{somebody}} knocking at a door. It is reported that the knock was a person walking into Eddie's recording studio. Another story has claimed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> was simply the musician knocking on his own guitar.|$|E
5|$|Having now gained {{experience}} with the Super Famicom sound chip, Uematsu felt <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> quality of the soundtrack for the next game in the series, Final Fantasy V (1992), was much better than that of IV. He named this as the primary reason that the soundtrack album was two CDs long, a first for the series. Like IV, the discography of Final Fantasy V included an arranged and a piano album {{in addition to the}} main soundtrack album.|$|E
5|$|To address {{concerns}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of the Hammond was {{not rich}} enough to accurately mimic a pipe organ, the model BC was introduced in December 1936. It included a chorus generator, in which a second tonewheel system added slightly sharp or flat tones to the overall sound of each note. The cabinet was made deeper to accommodate this. Production of the old Model A cases stopped, but the older model continued to be available as the AB until October 1938.|$|E
5000|$|If scribes {{very often}} confuse two letters, this implies <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> denoted by <b>the</b> two letters were <b>the</b> same: <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> have merged. This {{happened}} early with [...] A little later, it happened with , , and [...] Later still, [...] was {{confused with the}} already merged [...]|$|R
5|$|When {{fin whale}} sounds were first {{recorded}} by US biologists, {{they did not}} realize that these unusually loud, long, pure and regular sounds were being made by whales. They first investigated <b>the</b> possibilities <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> were due to equipment malfunction, geophysical phenomena, or even part of a Soviet Union scheme for detecting enemy submarines. Eventually, biologists demonstrated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> were <b>the</b> vocalizations of fin whales.|$|R
60|$|Suddenly {{they were}} arrested by what seemed to them a faint cry or wail. Listening intently, they {{perceived}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> were musical.|$|R
5|$|Queen conch shells {{were used}} by Native Americans and Caribbean Indians {{in a wide variety}} of ways. South Florida bands (such as the Tequesta), the Carib, the Arawak and Ta√≠no used conch shells to {{fabricate}} tools (such as knives, axe heads and chisels), jewelry, cookware and used them as blowing horns. In Mesoamerican history, Aztecs used the shell as part of jewelry mosaics such as the double-headed serpent. The Aztecs also believed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of trumpets made from queen conch shells represented divine manifestations, and used them in religious ceremonies. In central Mexico, during rain ceremonies dedicated to Tlaloc, the Maya used conch shells as hand protectors (in a manner similar to boxing gloves) during combat. Ancient middens of L. gigas shells bearing round holes are considered an evidence that pre-Columbian Lucayan Indians in the Bahamas used the queen conch as a food source.|$|E
5|$|Soule was {{promptly}} given the task by Square to score Secret of Evermore. The finished game features an untraditional score incorporating ambient background sounds (like wind blowing and ocean waves) {{into the music}} and utilizing a more mellow orchestral sound. Part {{of the reason for}} this was <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> program used in Evermore was not up to the technical challenge of what Soule wanted to do with it, forcing him to work creatively within his limitations. When Ron Gilbert of LucasArts left to form his own company, Humongous Entertainment, and Square moved from Seattle to Los Angeles, Soule quit Square to score Gilbert's children's adventure game series, Putt-Putt; he was the company's third employee. Soule composed the soundtracks to 11 children's games over the next three years, with multiple titles in the Putt-Putt, Pajama Sam, Freddi Fish and Spy Fox series.|$|E
5|$|Uematsu had {{originally}} {{calculated that the}} game would require more than 100 pieces of music, but managed {{to reduce the number}} to 56. He has stated that he developed the ideas for the music by first reading through the script and creating the titles for all of the tracks, then composing melodies to match the themes of the story and titles. Uematsu felt <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> quality of the soundtrack for Final Fantasy V was much better than that of Final Fantasy IV. He also claimed that this resulted in the soundtrack release requiring two CDs as opposed to the one CD required for the Final Fantasy IV soundtrack. Uematsu has stated that he would have preferred to keep the soundtrack to one CD, {{in order to keep the}} price of the album low.|$|E
60|$|The {{superintendent}} {{was surprised}} by the information brought, and insisted, as had <b>the</b> miners, <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> could not have been made by a human being.|$|R
50|$|James stated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> on Selected Ambient Works Volume II were {{inspired}} by lucid dreams, and that upon awaking, he would attempt to re-create <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> and record them. He claimed to have natural synaesthesia, which contributed to this album.|$|R
50|$|Takemitsu {{reported}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> natural <b>sounds,</b> such as {{birds and}} wind, at first disturbed his concentration. When he began {{listening to them}} more carefully, he came to view these sounds as not different from his own music. Later, when listening to November Steps while working in Africa, the cultural anthropologist Junzo Kawada commented <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> of nature did {{not interfere with the}} enjoyment of Takemitsus composition.|$|R
5|$|When {{mechanical}} engineer Robert Fulton {{went to see}} the machine, he noticed that the machine was unsteady as if someone would have powered it manually and irregularly with a crank. Fulton also detected <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> was uneven, uncharacteristic of a machine's motions. He announced the machine was a fraud, and challenged Redheffer exclaiming he would expose the secret power source, otherwise he would pay for all the damage he would cause. Redheffer agreed, so Fulton removed some boards from the wall alongside the machine and exposed a catgut cord that led to the upper floor. Upstairs he found an old man who was turning a hand-crank with one hand and eating bread with the other. Spectators realized they had been duped and destroyed the machine; Redheffer fled the city.|$|E
5|$|While the {{individual}} diver cannot predict exactly at what depth {{the onset of}} narcosis will occur on a given day, the first symptoms of narcosis for any given diver are often more predictable and personal. For example, one diver may have trouble with eye focus (close accommodation for middle-aged divers), another may experience feelings of euphoria, and another feelings of claustrophobia. Some divers report that they have hearing changes, and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> their exhaled bubbles make becomes different. Specialist training may help divers to identify these personal onset signs, which may then {{be used as a}} signal to ascend to avoid the narcosis, although severe narcosis may interfere with the judgement necessary to take preventive action.|$|E
5|$|Mr. Krabs {{is about}} to give SpongeBob and Patrick the job, but he hits his foot on a rock, {{dropping}} the paint and says all 13 swear words while complaining about his foot being injured. When SpongeBob and Patrick hear all the swear words, they run to Mama Krabs' house to tattle on him. When they all reach her house, they all explain what happened at once, saying the same swear words in the process. This makes her faint, but shortly after Mr. Krabs scolds SpongeBob and Patrick for saying all those bad words {{in front of her}} she regains consciousness. Mama Krabs states that all three of them should be ashamed for saying all those words. She then gives all three of them the task of painting her house with a fresh coat of paint as punishment. Later on, she leaves the three alarmed when she appears to be saying a 14th swear word after stubbing her toe on a rock; she claims <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> came from Old Man Jenkins, who is driving by in his jalopy, which produces an identical sound and everyone laughs.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> {{research}} found <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> chosen by {{liberals and conservatives}} varied as well. Liberals [...] "favor birth names with 'softer, feminine' sounds while conservatives favor names with 'harder, masculine' phonemes." ...|$|R
50|$|<b>That</b> <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> {{are taken}} from <b>the</b> set of <b>sounds</b> already known to the speaker is {{confirmed}} by others. Felicitas Goodman, a psychological anthropologist and linguist, also found <b>that</b> <b>the</b> speech of glossolalists reflected the patterns of speech of the speaker's native language.|$|R

25|$|During the World Cup events many {{competitors}} have criticised and {{complained about the}} noise caused by the vuvuzela horns, including France's Patrice Evra who blamed the horns for the team's poor performance. He also claimed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of the vuvuzelas away from the stadiums hampered {{the ability of the}} players to get their rest. Other critics include Lionel Messi who complained <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of the vuvuzelas hampered communication among players on the pitch, and broadcasting companies, which complained that commentators' voices were being drowned out by the sound. Cristiano Ronaldo went on record to state <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of the vuvuzelas disturbed the teams' concentration.|$|E

60|$|They listened again, {{and were}} overjoyed to note <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> were {{gradually}} coming nearer. Then they stepped {{out behind the}} boxsled, and presently discerned a large two-seated sleigh, drawn by a powerful pair of horses, approaching.|$|R
60|$|At last {{he made up}} {{his mind}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> came from some wild animal that was wounded, and {{plucking}} up courage he moved forward again, but with his rifle before him, ready to shoot at the slightest provocation.|$|R
2500|$|Speech agnosia, or {{auditory}} verbal agnosia, {{refers to}} [...] "an inability to comprehend spoken words despite intact hearing, speech production and reading ability".

25|$|One {{problem with}} {{acoustic}} stethoscopes was <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> level was extremely low. This problem was surmounted in 1999 with {{the invention of}} the stratified continuous (inner) lumen, and the kinetic acoustic mechanism in 2002.|$|E
25|$|In 2003, ABC News aired {{the results}} of its {{investigation}} on a program called Peter Jennings Reporting: The Kennedy Assassination: Beyond Conspiracy. Based on computer diagrams and recreations done by Dale K. Myers, it concluded <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> recordings on the Dictabelt could not have come from Dealey Plaza, and that Dallas Police Officer H.B. McLain was correct in his assertions {{that he had not}} yet entered Dealey Plaza {{at the time of the}} assassination.|$|E
25|$|The 2010 finals amplified {{international}} {{public awareness}} of the vuvuzela, a long horn blown by fans throughout matches. Many World Cup competitors complained about the noise caused by the vuvuzela horns, including France's Patrice Evra, who blamed the horns for the team's poor performance.

25|$|One {{interesting}} {{difference between}} a woodwind instrument and a brass instrument is that woodwind instruments are non-directional. This means <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> produced propagates in all directions with approximately equal volume. Brass instruments, on the other hand, are highly directional, {{with most of the}} sound produced traveling straight outward from the bell. This difference makes it significantly more difficult to record a brass instrument accurately. It also {{plays a major role in}} some performance situations, such as in marching bands.|$|E
25|$|Microphones ("mics") {{are used}} with drums {{to pick up}} the sound of the drums and cymbals for a sound {{recording}} and/or {{to pick up the}} sound of the drum kit {{so that it can be}} amplified through a PA system or sound reinforcement system. While most drummers use microphones and amplification in live shows in the 2010s, so <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> engineer can adjust and balance the levels of the drums and cymbals, some bands that play in quieter genres of music and that play in small venues such as coffeehouses play acoustically, without mics or PA amplification. Small jazz groups such as jazz quartets or organ trios that are playing in a small bar will often just use acoustic drums. Of course if the same small jazz groups play on the mainstage of a big jazz festival, the drums will be mic'ed so that they can be adjusted in the sound system mix. A middle-ground approach is used by some bands that play in small venues; they do not mic every drum and cymbal, but rather mic only the instruments <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> engineer wants to be able to control in the mix, such as the bass drum and the snare.|$|E
25|$|The {{disadvantage}} {{with tape}} leaders was <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> recording or playback {{did not start}} {{at the beginning of the}} tape, forcing the user to cue forward to the start of the magnetic section. For certain applications, such as dictation, special cassettes containing leaderless tapes were made, typically with stronger material and for use in machines that had more sophisticated end-of-tape prediction. Home computers that made use of cassettes prior to the advent of floppy discs (i.e. Apple II, Commodore PET) were designed to not start writing or reading data until leaders had spooled past.|$|E
