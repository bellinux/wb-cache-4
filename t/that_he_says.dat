Because a significant portion of his income is derived from selling his original artwork, he is reluctant to learn how to produce his work digitally.|$|E

Thus, having fulfilled Prospero's tasks, and Prospero himself now being free to leave the island, Ariel is set free.|$|E

25|$|Bob Odenkirk as Saul Goodman (recurring season 2, main cast season 3–5)– {{a crooked}} strip mall lawyer who {{represents}} Walt and Jesse. Odenkirk drew inspiration for Goodman from film producer Robert Evans. I thought about Robert Evans because I've listened to The Kid Stays in the Picture on CD. He's constantly switching up his cadence and his delivery. He emphasizes interesting words. He has loads of attitude {{in almost every}} line <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>says.</b> So when I rehearse the scenes alone I do my impersonation of Robert Evans to find those moments and turns. Then I go out and I do Saul.|$|E

Having obtained through {{the offices of the}} U.S. Embassy in Kabul a new passport as well as money to apply for a visa to India, Idema insisted that his belongings be returned and that a pet dog previously owned by Bennett be allowed to travel with him.|$|E
25|$|As {{a refugee}} {{he was sent}} to South Africa and landed in Durban. From there he went by train to Johannesburg. He disembarked at the Braamfontein railway station because it was feared that the Ossewabrandwag would have a {{demonstration}} at the central station. The Ossewabrandwag blamed Jan Smuts for bringing the vuilgoed (rubbish) of Europe to South Africa. The local Greek community helped integrate him into society. Bizos did not immediately go to school because he could not speak English or Afrikaans but by 1948—the year that the National Party was voted into power—Bizos had managed to gain entry into the law faculty at the University of the Witwatersrand. It was here <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>says</b> he first became politically active.|$|E

The original prints of Doppelgänger position Ian Hendry before Roy Thinnes in the opening credits; in the Journey to the Far Side of the Sun format, Thinnes is billed before Hendry. Certain UK prints alter the final scene featuring the old Jason Webb {{with the addition of}} a short voice-over from Thinnes in character as Ross, who is heard speaking a line <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>says</b> to Webb earlier in the film: [...] "Jason, we were right.

500|$|Homer's chants and his {{nickname}} [...] "Dancin' Homer" [...] is {{a reference to}} American baseball fan Wild Bill Hagy, who earned the nickname [...] "The Roar from Thirty-Four" [...] for his chants during the 1970s in section thirty-four at Baltimore's Memorial Stadium. Homer spells out Springfield just like Hagy spelled O-R-I-O-L-E-S with his arms. A drunk Homer performs his first dance to the 1961 tune [...] "Baby Elephant Walk" [...] written by Henry Mancini. Bleeding Gums Murphy makes a 26-minute-long performance of the [...] "Star-Spangled Banner" [...] at the game where Homer performs his first dance. Homer's line, [...] "Today, as I leave for Capital City, I consider myself the luckiest mascot {{on the face of}} the earth" [...] <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>says</b> in his farewell speech to the Springfield fans, is a reference to Lou Gehrig's farewell speech in the 1942 baseball film The Pride of the Yankees.

Lois asks whether there is any hope, to which Peter replies that if all these shows are canceled they might have a chance, the joke being all these shows had indeed already been canceled by Fox. The New York Times reported that, during the first Family Guy Live! performance, [...] "...the longer [...] went, the louder the laughs from the Town Hall crowd [...] ".|$|E
500|$|Hal Erickson of AllMovie {{called the}} episode [...] "refreshingly {{free of the}} patronization which usually {{attended}} 'racially sensitive' TV episodes of the period." [...] In his book about Bewitched, critic Walter Metz writes that [...] "Sisters at Heart" [...] exemplifies the liberalism endorsed by the series, which he argues is excessively sentimental and simplistic. He praises Asher for his [...] "skillful understanding of film aesthetics", calling particular attention to Asher's choice of camera angles in the scene in which Mr. Brockway first meets Lisa. Metz argues that the Stephens' foyer is an important location in the series, and that this importance is exemplified in the episode both by the scene of Mr. Brockway's first encounter with Lisa {{as well as in}} the epilogue when Mr. Brockway revisits the house and apologizes for his prior racism. Metz criticizes Mr. Brockway's [...] "magically found soft-heartedness" [...] as a [...] "paternalistic approach to liberal racial tolerance [...] implies that only white patriarchs have the cultural authority to declare that racism is wrong." [...] Metz further argues that the episode problematically figures Samantha as the protector and provider for black people, a role <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>says</b> Samantha also fills in [...] "Samantha at the Keyboard", another Bewitched episode.|$|E
