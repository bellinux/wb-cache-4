25|$|This {{work was}} {{primarily}} incited by David Strauss's The Old and New Faith (Vom alten und neuen Glauben, 1872) and Paul de Lagarde's 'On the Relationship of the German State to Theology, Church, and Religion' ('Über das Verhältnis des deutschen Staates zu Theologie, Kirche und Religion', 1873). Both authors attempted <b>to</b> <b>shape</b> <b>a</b> modern Christian religion {{with the help}} of theological scholarship. Overbeck regarded this project as impossible and fundamentally in error. In his afterword for the second edition in 1903, he renewed this critique against theologian Adolf von Harnack and his work 'The Essence of Christianity' ('Das Wesen des Christentums', 1900).|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} of hangar 7 for the ATAIU, and of Eagle Farm as an aircraft assembly depot and aerodrome, {{is a result}} of a shift in Australian foreign policy in December 1941, when Prime Minister Curtin announced that Australia now looked to America free of the United Kingdom <b>to</b> <b>shape</b> <b>a</b> plan with the United States as its cornerstone. As a result, the RAAF was placed under the control of General Douglas MacArthur in April 1942. This contrasts with the previous role of Eagle Farm as part of an RAAF Elementary Flying Training School from 1940 which serviced the Empire Air Training Scheme to provide airmen for the defence of Britain.|$|E

Lucretia Mott moved {{the adoption of the}} Seneca Falls Declaration of Sentiments, which was read to the convention, debated, then referred to a committee to draft a new declaration.

In 2005, an expert workshop of the Physiome was held as part of the Functional Imaging and Modelling of the Heart Conference in Barcelona where a white paper entitled Towards Virtual Physiological Human: Multilevel modelling and simulation of the human anatomy and physiology was presented.

25|$|In 1955 Krätschmer {{published}} the book Rtterkreuzträger der Waffen-SS. Featuring a foreword by Paul Hausser, formerly {{one of the}} highest ranking commanders of the Waffen-SS, Krätschmer's work was one of the earliest attempts <b>to</b> <b>shape</b> <b>a</b> positive image of the Waffen-SS after the war. Historians note that Krätschmer uncitically presented perpetrators like Erich von dem Bach-Zelewski, Oskar Dirlewanger, Theodor Eicke, Curt von Gottberg and Bruno Streckenbach as honest soldiers and claimed that war criminals like Walter Reder, Fritz Knöchlein, Bernhard Siebken and Jochen Peiper were victims of victor's justice. On persons who had been actively and decisively involved in the planning and execution of the Nazi policy of extermination, like Friedrich Jeckeln, Friedrich Wilhelm Krüger, Streckenbach and Dirlewanger, only basic biographical data were given. Jens Westemeier points to erroneous claims by Krätschmer about Jochen Peiper's career, by which Peiper's involvement with Heinrich Himmler was minimized, and to Krätschmer's denial of war crimes.|$|E
25|$|As Titor gained {{significant}} attention, {{there also}} emerged analysis and discussion concerning {{the veracity of}} his claims about his origins and mission, and the future events he talked about. No John Titor or Titor family is known to exist, meaning that who posted as Titor used a pseudonym. The story has been called inconsistent as contradictions between statements at different times have been observed. Holding the many-worlds interpretation as correct, Titor claimed that his mission as a time traveler was <b>to</b> <b>shape</b> <b>a</b> timeline in which many chaotic events of his time, including World War III and {{the civil war in}} the US, never happened. In some supposed Titor's appearances in the internet and other media segments prior to his main posts (notably in faxes to the radio talk show Coast to Coast AM in 1998), he stated that {{he was not able to}} change the future despite his efforts, suggesting one of the possible contradictions. Nevertheless, none of the specific events he predicted to a near future, chaotic or not, have come to happen (see below).|$|E

2500|$|In {{his essay}} on the sociobiological {{backgrounds}} of Butler's Xenogenesis trilogy, J. Adam Johns describes how Butler's narratives counteract the death drive behind the hierarchical impulse with an innate love of life (biophilia), particularly different, strange life. Specifically, Butler's stories feature gene manipulation, interbreeding, miscegenation, symbiosis, mutation, alien contact, non-consensual sex, contamination, {{and other forms of}} hybridity as the means to correct the sociobiological causes of hierarchical violence. As De Witt Douglas Kilgore and Ranu Samantrai note, [...] "n [...] narratives the undoing of the human body is both literal and metaphorical, for it signifies the profound changes necessary <b>to</b> <b>shape</b> <b>a</b> world not organized by hierarchical violence." [...] The evolutionary maturity achieved by the bioengineered hybrid protagonist {{at the end of the}} story, then, signals the possible evolution of the dominant community in terms of tolerance, acceptance of diversity, and a desire to wield power responsibly.|$|E
