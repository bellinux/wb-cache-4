40|$|Strain gauges are an {{important}} tool in measuring techniques applied to determine loads and detect dam-ages. Due to their high signal-resolving power, they are also suitable for stress analysis in building con-structions. Without specific encapsulation, they are, however, suitable only for short-term measurements. Therefore, a completely new encapsulation type was developed at PTB. The strain gauges were placed in a sensor housing which protects the sensitive technology- similar to common force transducers- and is fitted into a small measurement borehole of the structure. These applied investigations {{were part of the}} work of a collaborative research center of the German Research Foundation. Based on these investigations, the measurement uncertainty of the sensor will be analyzed and the final design for commercial production and calibration of this new sensor type presented.

Sodium bisulfite and sodium carbonate are fed in parallel into a flask in 40 to 60 minutes and with a mole ratio of 4 : 1. Thereafter, the prepared powder is characterized. The result of X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) shows that the powder consists of CuCl with well crystallization. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images indicate that the morphology of the samples exhibits a regular 2 D flake structure. In addition, results of BET and BJH methods show that the CuCl powder has a larger surface area.

40|$|Objective To {{study the}} change of the {{contractile}} response of human umbilical artery smooth muscle cells (HUASMCs) during the heat stress, and explore {{the effect of the}} antioxidant on the changes. Methods HUASMCs were randomly divided into control group, heat stress group, antioxidant preprocessing group. Cells were stimulated by norepinephrine (NE) at a low concentration (0. 05 mg/L) and at a normal concentration (1. 0 mg/L) and cultured in the <b>thermostatic</b> <b>water</b> <b>bath</b> (41 ℃) for 0. 5, 1, 1. 5 or 2 h, respectively. After stimulated by NE, proportion of the cell surface area contraction was measured to reflect the contractile response of each group. Results Compared with control group, regardless of the NE concentration: in heat stress group, contractile response at 1 h increased significantly (P 0. 05), but in the antioxidant preprocessing group, the contractile response was more significant to the normal NE concentration than to the low NE concentration (P< 0. 05 or 0. 01). Regardless of the NE concentration, the contractile response was lower in the antioxidant preprocessing group than in the heat stress group. Conclusions In the course of heat stress, the contractile response of HUASMCs presents as time- related change. The usage of antioxidant may correct the over-response of HUASMCs to NE in the early heat stress stage, but cannot correct the reduction of the contractile response in the middle and advanced stage.
