500|$|As Pausch {{walked into}} the {{standing}} ovation, he {{tried to stop the}} applause, get the audience to sit down, and begin the speech by commenting [...] "make me earn it", to which one member of the audience responded [...] "you did". He then commented on the irony of his [...] "last lecture" [...] in a series that used to be the [...] "Last Lecture" [...] series, but was renamed [...] "Journeys": [...] "It's wonderful to be here. What Indira didn’t <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> this lecture series used to be called the 'Last Lecture'. If you had one last lecture to give before you died, what would it be? I thought, damn, I finally nailed the venue and they renamed it." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{most recent}} {{meeting between the}} two clubs was in the FA Cup semi-finals; the tie was decided by a replay as the initial game {{finished}} goalless. The match was settled in extra time when Giggs {{ran the length of}} the pitch and evaded several Arsenal players to score the winning goal. In the close season, Anelka was involved in a protracted transfer saga and vowed to never play for Arsenal again. He cited the media in England as a reason for wanting to leave the club: [...] "The one thing I can <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> I can't stand the English Press, who cause me enormous problems on a personal level," [...] but it was implied that his [...] "gold-digging brothers" [...] wanted Anelka to move abroad to make more money – they served as his agents.|$|E
500|$|.....of [...] that I have read, the {{negative}} ones often {{say something to}} the effect that the book is just like the game, so why read it? What those readers may not realize is that I was hired to novelize the game. That means taking the game and turning it into a book [...] or, put another way, I did what I was hired to do. ...there must be some folks who feel that I wrote the Chief out of character. That's news to me. All I can <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the Bungie folks, who care deeply about the character and the universe never raised that issue, and approved the book as written. However, there's no doubt that every author is different, and will approach characters differently. So if Nylund's rendition of the Chief is different from my own in subtle ways that would be understandable.|$|E

6000|$|She {{caught at}} his hand again. [...] "No, it wasn't; only you looked so worried that I thought--I--" [...] Her voice broke, and she began again freshly. [...] "What I wanted to <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> we're {{planning}} a trip across the bay to Oakland, next Saturday, for a tramp in the hills." ...|$|R
60|$|And yet no two quarrels {{can be more}} distinct. Riches--so {{far from}} being {{necessary}} to noblesse--are adverse to it. So utterly adverse, that the first character of all the Nobilities which have founded great dynasties {{in the world is}} to be poor;--often poor by oath--always poor by generosity. And of every true knight in the chivalric ages, the first thing history <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> he never kept treasure for himself.|$|R
2500|$|All I can <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it {{completely}} and utterly changed my life. I {{was a white}} hippie boy and then I saw exit wounds from M1 rifles out of the backs of two people I knew.|$|E
2500|$|June: Taliban {{commander}} Mullah Akhtar Mohammad Osmani tells Pakistani GEO News {{that bin}} Laden and Mullah Mohammed Omar are both alive. He does not reveal anything about bin Laden's location, stating [...] "All I can <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Osama Bin Laden {{is alive and}} well." ...|$|E
2500|$|Shodhan also {{hinted at}} the same : [...] "All I can <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> no youngster could hope to play for long at that time {{because he had to}} ally himself to one camp or the other. One had to know how to survive. What did I know about the {{politics}} ? The captain Vijay Hazare was not a strong personality and the truth is, Vinoo Mankad was. He always had his way... I would have loved to play on. But then Hazare called quits and Mankad became captain. I made myself unavailable for the tour to Pakistan in 1954/55. It is unlikely that I would have been chosen".|$|E
6000|$|... "Did he {{have much}} money?" [...] asked Sam. [...] "Tell me all you know. I {{might as well}} <b>tell</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you,</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> my brother, and he is sick in his head, so that he doesn't know just what he is doing." ...|$|R
5000|$|Davis was {{initially}} the front runner in the contest, {{but after a}} poorly received speech at that year's Conservative Party Conference his campaign was seen to lose momentum. However, referring to a Conference speech by the party's former leader, Campaign Manager Andrew Mitchell said: [...] "William Hague made a great speech which many people will judge {{to be better than}} all the other leadership candidates put together. What <b>that</b> <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> being absolutely brilliant at being able to make a speech at conference is not the be-all-and-end-all of leadership. There are other things as well." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Softly, softly, {{my young}} master. <b>You</b> need to <b>be</b> told {{something}} <b>that</b> your eyes would not <b>tell</b> <b>you,</b> and <b>that</b> <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> the poor lass is betrothed already to {{a son of}} old King Ranald the Ostman, of Waterford, son of old King Sigtryg, who ruled there when I was a boy." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I do," [...] said Bessie. [...] "The trouble is, I don't {{know how}} I feel. But if I ever do, Molly, I'll <b>tell</b> <b>you!</b> <b>Is</b> <b>that</b> fair?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You {{provoking}} girl,' said Ethel. 'All I <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> you are {{twenty-three years}} old, and I won't tell you anything, nor assist your unwholesome {{desire to be}} second fiddle.' ...|$|E
60|$|THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. Nothing {{seems to}} make sense here. All I can <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{she was the most}} impenetrably stupid woman I have ever met in the whole course of my life.|$|E
6000|$|Wife. But no makee {{kill you}} yet; then he <b>tell</b> <b>you,</b> may <b>be,</b> <b>that</b> he no makee you kill, so you make de bargain with him, you do bad ting, he no <b>be</b> angry at <b>you,</b> when he <b>be</b> angry at other mans? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well; if you've got to know, I'll <b>tell</b> <b>you.</b> I <b>was</b> {{thinking}} <b>that</b> in {{some way}} that Ward Porton looked something like Dave." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> I <b>was</b> <b>that</b> upset--I didn't {{think what}} I was doing. I never stopped-not even to fill my pockets. I {{went over the}} fence like a shot, and ran like one o'clock for the trap, cussing and {{swearing}} as I went. I WAS in a state....|$|R
60|$|THE HE-ANCIENT. Life is {{not meant}} to be easy, my child; but take courage: it can be delightful. What I wanted to <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> ever since men existed, {{children}} have played with dolls.|$|E
60|$|THE LADY. I {{never read}} the Radical papers. All I can <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> what we women admire in you {{is not the}} politician, but the man of action, the heroic warrior, the beau sabreur.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm not so {{sure that}} follows," [...] said the lawyer. [...] "All I can <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the bills have been sent to me for {{collection}} and unless they are met I shall reluctantly be forced to--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Never {{mind the}} yarn now, Shadow," [...] said Ben. [...] "I've got {{something}} to <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> more interesting than a story. It's about Nat Poole's uncle." ...|$|R
6000|$|Well, but the {{greatest}} thing of all <b>was</b> the turkey <b>that</b> they had. It [...] was a gobbler, I <b>tell</b> <b>you,</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> nearly {{as big as a}} giraffe.|$|R
6000|$|... "'Honest fellow,' sayst thou, clown?" [...] quoth {{one of the}} men [...] "Why, I <b>tell</b> <b>thee</b> <b>that</b> this <b>is</b> <b>that</b> same rogue {{that men}} call Robin Hood." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It was {{scarcely}} {{to be expected}} that you should," [...] Mr. Philip Burr admitted. [...] "All I can <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> in cases like yours, I really prefer not to know with whom I have to deal." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will tell}} you," [...] said Holmes, [...] "and {{the reason why}} I <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> I hope frankness may beget frankness. What my next step may be will depend entirely upon the nature of your own defence." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You're not at {{all like}} Caliban, because you're sophisticated, and Caliban was not. But I'm not talking about {{imaginary}} characters; I'm talking about Isabel. Isabel's intensely real. What I wish to <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> I find her fearfully changed." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No!" [...] and the sternness of {{his face}} <b>was</b> such <b>that</b> it <b>was</b> dreadful to look on it. [...] "I will <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> nothing <b>that</b> <b>is</b> false." ...|$|R
60|$|CAESAR. Theodotus: I am {{an author}} myself; and I <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> it <b>is</b> better <b>that</b> the Egyptians should {{live their lives}} than dream them away {{with the help of}} books.|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> it <b>is</b> that,--you! <b>That</b> punch, I say <b>that</b> punch <b>was</b> {{no better}} than paw--aw-oison." [...] And here the Count's head sank back, and he fell to snore.|$|R
6000|$|BURGE-LUBIN. You {{can do as}} you please. All I can <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> I don't {{believe your}} eyes if they cant see any {{difference}} between a live archbishop and two dead ones. [The apparatus rings, he holds the button down]. Yes? ...|$|E
6000|$|Miss Fosbrook kissed her, saying, [...] "My dear little girl, I cannot tell. All I can {{certainly}} <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> He hears {{the prayers of}} good children, and if it be better for her and for you He will give her back to you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's {{what you}} have to find out!" [...] Balbus gaily replied. [...] "All I <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it is oblong in shape--just half a yard longer than its width--and that a gravel-walk, one yard wide, begins at one corner and runs all round it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No it isn't that," [...] {{she said}} at last. [...] "You're not a {{conceited}} boy by nature, and so I can safely <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> it <b>is</b> not <b>that.</b> It's deeper." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{only the}} rats," [...] {{answered}} Miriam cheerfully, [...] "no one ever comes up here. I <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> it not for Marcus I could weep with joy." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “He’s {{the very}} man we want,” {{continued}} the Editor. “Excuse my excitement. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> the very man, Renouard. Didn’t <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> me that your assistant called himself Walter? Yes? Thought so. But here’s that old woman—the butler’s wife—listen to this. She writes: All I can <b>tell</b> <b>you,</b> Miss, <b>is</b> <b>that</b> my poor husband directed his {{letters to the}} name of H. Walter.” ...|$|R
