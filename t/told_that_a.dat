5|$|Filming was {{supposed}} to start on 26 November 2011, but the first schedule began in January 2012, and lasted for 35 days. At Linking Road in Bandra, Mumbai, Vijay acted and operated the camera himself for one scene with cinematographer Santosh Sivan's assistance, {{which had to be}} filmed quickly with the unaware public. Sivan commented that it was shot perfectly and decided to retain it in the film. Sivan further <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> major part of the film was being shot in real locations with hidden cameras. He shot Thuppakki with an Arri Alexa camera, as opposed to traditional 35 mm film.|$|E
5|$|Four {{days after}} he left Maracaibo, Morgan returned. He was <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> Spanish defence squadron, the Armada de Barlovento, {{was waiting for him}} at the narrow passage between the Caribbean and Lake Maracaibo, where the San Carlos de la Barra Fortress was sited. The forces, under the command of Don Alonso del Campo y Espinosa, had 126 cannon with which to attack Morgan, and had re-armed San Carlos de la Barra Fortress. The Spaniards had orders to end piracy in the Caribbean, and {{negotiations}} between Morgan and Espinosa continued for a week. The final offer put by the Spanish commander was for Morgan to leave all their spoils and slave and to return to Jamaica unmolested, but no agreement was reached that would allow Morgan and his men to pass the fleet with their spoils but without attack. Morgan put the Spaniards' offers to his men, who voted instead to fight their way out. As they were heavily outgunned, one privateer suggested that a fire ship aimed at Espinosa's flagship, Magdalen would work.|$|E
5|$|Morrow {{opened his}} {{practice}} in Lexington. He established his reputation {{in one of}} his first casesthe trial of William Moseby, a black man accused of murder. Moseby's first trial had ended in a hung jury, but because the evidence against him included a confession (which he later recanted), most observers believed he would be convicted in his second trial. Unable to find a defense lawyer for Moseby, the judge in the case turned to Morrow, who as a young lawyer was eager for work. Morrow proved that his client's testimony had been extorted; he had been <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> lynch mob waited outside the jail for him, but no such mob had ever existed. Morrow further showed that other testimony against his client was false. Moseby was acquitted September 21, 1902.|$|E

5|$|One night {{towards the}} end of 1942, Gröning and his comrades in their SS barracks on the {{outskirts}} of Birkenau were awakened by an alarm. They were <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> number of Jews who were being taken to the gas chambers had escaped and hidden in the woods. They were ordered to take pistols and search the woods. When his group arrived at the extermination area of the camp they saw a farmhouse, in front of which were SS men and the bodies of seven or eight prisoners who had been caught and shot. The SS men told Gröning and his comrades that they could go home but they decided to hang around {{in the shadows of the}} woods.|$|E

Once Mar Ukba sent his son to deliver the 400 zuz. His son came back and reported that the poor man did not need Mar Ukba's help. When Mar Ukba asked his son what he had seen, his son replied that they were sprinkling aged wine before the poor man to improve the aroma in the room. Mar Ukba said that if the poor man was that delicate, then Mar Ukba would double the amount of his gift and send it back to the poor man.|$|E
25|$|Bladel, {{a disgruntled}} former employee, {{had been arrested}} three months later in Indiana and extradited to Michigan. He had agreed {{to talk to the}} police without counsel. At his {{arraignment}} he requested that counsel be appointed for him because he was indigent. The detective in charge of the investigation was present at the arraignment. A notice of appointment was then mailed to a law firm, but before the law firm received the notice, two police officers interviewed Bladel in the county jail and obtained a confession from him. Prior to that questioning, the officers had advised Bladel of his Miranda rights. Although Bladel had inquired about his representation several times since the arraignment, he was not <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> law firm had been appointed to represent him.|$|E
25|$|The Kingdom of Jerusalem {{lasted until}} 1291; however, Jerusalem itself was recaptured by Saladin in 1187 (see Siege of Jerusalem (1187)), who {{permitted}} worship of all religions. According to Rabbi Elijah of Chelm, German Jews lived in Jerusalem during the 11th century. The story is <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> German-speaking Jew saved {{the life of}} a young German man surnamed Dolberger. Thus when the knights of the First Crusade came to besiege Jerusalem, one of Dolberger's family members rescued Jews in Palestine and carried them back to the German city of Worms to repay the favor. Further evidence of German communities in the holy city {{comes in the form of}} halakic questions sent from Germany to Jerusalem during the second half of the 11th century.|$|E

Advertisements seeking mercenaries were seen in Nigeria {{with at least one}} female Nigerian pro-Gaddafi sniper being caught in late August outside Tripoli. One group of mercenaries from Niger, who had been {{allegedly}} recruited from the streets with promises of money, included a soldier of just 13 years old. The Daily Telegraph studied the case of a 16-year-old captured Chadian child soldier in Bayda.

25|$|On October 10, 1934 the three-man {{communist}} leadership {{issued an}} order to retreat; on October 16 the Chinese Red Army begun what was later known as the Long March, leaving the CSR. Seventeen days after the main communist force left its base, the nationalists realized they had escaped {{when they reached the}} abandoned city of Ruijin on November 5. The original destination was He Long's communist base in Hubei; the final destination (Yan'an) was not chosen until later, after the rise of Mao Zedong. To avoid panic, the goal was kept secret from most people (including Mao Zedong); the public was <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> portion of the Chinese Red Army would be engaged in mobile warfare with the nationalist forces, and this part of the army was renamed the “Field Army”.|$|E
25|$|Next summer a Norwegian ship, led by Fritz Mack from Tromsø, left Norway {{to rescue}} the {{stranded}} men. Outside the house they found five dead bodies wrapped in a tarpaulin. On the door, which was locked from the inside, there was a sign with a warning not to enter. Inside there were dead bodies scattered in chairs, on beds and on the floor. All together the expedition found fifteen bodies, which were taken out and buried in their beds. Two more bodies were discovered {{by a group of}} researchers a few years later. One of the sealers, Karl Albertsen, had kept a diary during his stay in the house. The diary <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> man named Hans Hansen had been the first to die, in November. By Christmas everyone in the house was ill. The last diary entry was written on 19 April. It is assumed that Albertsen was the penultimate man to die.|$|E
50|$|Aggravating {{factors for}} {{unemployment}} are the rapidly increasing quantity of international graduates competing for an inadequate number of suitable jobs, schools not keeping their curriculums {{relevant to the}} job market, the growing pressure on schools to increase access to education (which usually requires a reduction in educational quality), and students being constantly <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>an</b> academic degree is the only route to a secure future.|$|R

25|$|Say we are <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> {{woman has}} two children. If we ask whether {{either of them}} is a girl, and are told yes, what is the {{probability}} that the other child is also a girl? Considering this new child independently, one might expect the probability that the other child is female is ½ (50%). But by building a probability space (illustrating all possible outcomes), we see that the probability is actually only ⅓ (33%). This is because the possibility space illustrates 4 ways of having these two children: boy-boy, girl-boy, boy-girl, and girl-girl. But we were given more information. Once we are told that one of the children is a female, we use this new information to eliminate the boy-boy scenario. Thus the probability space reveals that there are still 3 ways to have two children where one is a female: boy-girl, girl-boy, girl-girl. Only ⅓ of these scenarios would have the other child also be a girl. Using a probability space, we are less likely to miss one of the possible scenarios, or to neglect the importance of new information. For further information, see Boy or girl paradox.|$|E
