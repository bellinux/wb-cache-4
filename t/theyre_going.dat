gambling every penny they have and losing it on horses yes because a woman whatever she does she knows where to stop sure they wouldnt be in the world at all only for us they dont know what it is to be a woman and a mother how could they where would they all of them be if they hadnt all a mother to look after them what I never had thats why I suppose hes running wild now out at night away from

5000|$|The {{character}} {{was featured in}} various other storylines, including a feud with Grant Mitchell (Ross Kemp); a tug-of-love for Rickys affections with his first wife Sam Mitchell (Danniella Westbrook); a one-night stand with Lenny Wallace (Des Coleman), causing a sexually transmitted disease scare; {{and the death of}} her best friend Tiffany Mitchell (Martine McCutcheon). In November 1998, the BBC announced that Patsy Palmer had decided to leave EastEnders {{to spend more time with}} her family. The BBC said that Bianca would not be killed off, and a spokesman commented: [...] "Bianca has always been an amazingly powerful character and the door is open to her if she wants to return in the future. She has been fantastic in the years she has been in EastEnders and we will miss her." [...] Palmer was one of several high-profile EastEnders stars to announce their departures that year; McCutcheon and Kemp also decided to leave, and Gillian Taylforth left the serial in 1998 after 13 years playing Kathy Beale. The BBC said, [...] "no-one is bigger than the show, which is doing extremely well at the moment. We will send her off with all our very best wishes." [...] Richard Stokes, EastEnders series editor and producer of Palmers exit storyline commented, [...] "you dont expect people to stay here for ever. But its a double-edged sword. Yes, its a shame when a well-loved character announces <b>theyre</b> <b>going,</b> but the flipside is that it provides us with the space to do the best possible story. If someone is going, you can up the stakes. The whole of Biancas story was developed once we knew she was going to go." ...|$|E
5000|$|Reviewing {{the first}} episodes in The Guardian Sam Wollaston noted its jumble of {{characters}} and events: [...] "Tony Jordan {{has taken a}} whole bunch of Dickens characters from their novels and put them into something else. …. Its like EastEnders meets A Christmas Carol meets Great Expectations meets Oliver Twist meets Bleak House meets Our Mutual Friend, and Ive certainly missed some out. Meets Agatha Christie, too, because heres another body - Marleys this time - coshed over the head and left lying in the snow". He added, [...] "The set is beautiful, and there are showy Dickensian performances from a starry cast. Its clever, certainly, and must have been a labour of love, unpicking all these people from their works, weaving them into something else." [...] But he had a problem [...] "with the whole exercise - starting with the characters, someone elses, and then figuring out what <b>theyre</b> <b>going</b> to be doing. Are things not better if they grow together, as one, characters, stories, style, themes etc? And the problem with these particular characters is that the new thing is never going {{to be as good as}} the thing they came from". He concluded, [...] "And Im having real problems figuring out what the bleedin ell is going on. Its clear like the fog down by the dock where Fagin lives. It - the fog - does lift a bit; by the end of the second episode (of 20! that’s a big ask), Im a bit less fuddled. And it begins to pick up momentum of its own. But I wonder how many of the viewers who set off will get this far".|$|E
5000|$|A {{distinguished}} female contract {{killer in}} the world of assassins, and a former acquaintance of John. About the character of Ms. Perkins, Palicki said, [...] "Ms. Perkins is what you think the quintessential assassin would be. She’s cold, heartless, conniving, badass and I think that she has fun with what she does. She enjoys it. I think that she’d clearly do it for a dollar. Ultimately in the film she’s doing it for four million, so its a little different." [...] Originally the character of Perkins was envisioned as a man, but the decision was reversed during a brainstorming session and the desire to create [...] "an authentic female action character." [...] Leitch stated, [...] "You believe this woman could come in and give John Wick a run for his money," [...] so Stahelski, Leitch and Iwanyk changed it and offered the role to Palicki. Palicki spoke most highly of working with Reeves and the inclusion of stunt work on her part, to which she stated, [...] "Chad wanted to make sure I would be willing to do my own stuff in the huge fight sequence that I have with Keanu—and I was all game." [...] Palicki spent months of training learning Judo and Jujutsu. After the films release Palicki revealed background information, [...] "I also think we talked about a backstory. Its likely Perkins and Wick had a history as well, before his marriage. She may have a personal vendetta as well as the money. I think theres an enjoyment on multiple levels." [...] On what she hopes for with regard to the fan response, [...] "Its a lot of fun. <b>Theyre</b> <b>going</b> to want to see what happens next. Most importantly, I hope they’re rooting for John Wick the way that I did when I read the script." ...|$|E
5000|$|... 1. The Fabulous Five in Trouble - During {{the school}} year, {{each of the}} girls is meeting new people and is {{involved}} in different activities. This lends itself to them {{not being able to}} spend as much time as they would like with each other. But when they do get time to be together, all they do is argue. Jana feels as if they are going in different directions, them all having separate interests from each other, and wonders if they still want to be friends and collectively be [...] "The Fabulous Five". Katie is thinking the same thing and decides to invite them all to a sleepover, where she hopes they can discuss things and work through whatever <b>theyre</b> <b>going</b> through. Everyone accepts, but once everyone gets there, its awkward, and quite simply, they have forgotten how to relate with each other because it has been awhile since they have really done so. After a fierce argument, they go to sleep. Each of them has a dream where they are another in the group, and have to deal with their issues. For instance, Christie is Beth, Beth is Jana, Jana is Katie, Katie is Melanie, and Melanie is Christie. The dream lasts about a week and each girl is able to view the stressors in the other girls life from a different perspective, and realize certain things about each girl. They each get a chance to step into each others shoes and live their lives. Once they wake up, they calmly discuss this and although they are separate people with different interests, they realize that having those differences is a special part of each of them, and that it combines to so much more when they are all together.|$|E

Brooke then has a change of heart and told the boys to meet him at the neighborhood recreation center, first thing in the morning.|$|E
