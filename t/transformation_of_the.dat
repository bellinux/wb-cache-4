40|$|In this paper, three {{methods for}} {{describing}} <b>the</b> conformal <b>transformations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> S-matrix in {{quantum field theory}} are proposed. They are illustrated by applying the algebraic renormalization procedure to the quantum scalar field theory, defined by the LSZ reduction mechanism in the BPHZ renormalization scheme. Central results are shown to be independent of scheme choices and derived to all orders in loop expansions. Firstly, the local Callan-Symanzik equation is constructed, in which <b>the</b> insertion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trace <b>of</b> <b>the</b> energy-momentum tensor {{is related to the}} beta function and the anomalous dimension. With this result, the Ward identities for <b>the</b> conformal <b>transformations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Green functions are derived. Then <b>the</b> conformal <b>transformations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> S-matrix defined by the LSZ reduction procedure are calculated. Secondly, <b>the</b> conformal <b>transformations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> S-matrix in the functional formalism are related to charge constructions. The commutators between the charges and the S-matrix operator are in a compact way to represent <b>the</b> conformal <b>transformations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> S-matrix. Lastly, the massive scalar field theory with local coupling is introduced in order to control breaking <b>of</b> <b>the</b> conformal invariance further. <b>The</b> conformal <b>transformations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> S-matrix with local coupling are calculated...|$|R

5|$|Although {{absolute}} {{in theory}} and in principle, the sultan's powers were limited in practice. Political decisions had {{to take into account}} the opinions and attitudes of important members of the dynasty, the bureaucratic and military establishments, as well as religious leaders. Beginning in the last decades of the sixteenth century, the role of the Ottoman sultans in the government of the empire began to decrease, in a period known as the <b>Transformation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ottoman Empire. Despite being barred from inheriting the throne, women of the Imperial Harem—especially the reigning sultan's mother, known as the Valide Sultan—also played an important behind-the-scenes political role, effectively ruling the empire during the period known as the Sultanate of Women.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the third}} week of development, the embryo is a three-layered disc, covered with ectoderm, {{mesoderm}} and endoderm. A tube-like formation develops in the midline, called the notochord. The notochord releases extracellular molecules that affect the <b>transformation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> overlying ectoderm into nervous tissue. The neural tube, forming from the ectoderm, contains CSF prior {{to the development of the}} choroid plexuses.

Because the revival occurred {{at the same time as}} the <b>transformation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Highlands into a crofting society, Evangelicalism was often linked to popular protest against patronage and the clearances, while the Moderates became identified with the interests of the landholding classes. It laid the ground for the Great Disruption in the mid-nineteenth century, leading to the Evangelicals taking control of the General Assembly and those in the Highlands joining the Free Church of Scotland in large numbers.|$|E
5|$|Holden began {{assembling}} the compact HA series Vauxhall Viva in 1964. This was superseded by the Holden Torana in 1967, a {{development of the}} Viva ending Vauxhall production in Australia. Holden offered the LC, a Torana with new styling, in 1969 with the availability of Holden's six-cylinder engine. In the development days, the six-cylinder Torana was reserved for motor racing, but research had shown {{that there was a}} business case for such a model. The LC Torana was the first application of Holden's new three-speed Tri-Matic automatic transmission.

5|$|III. Menuetto: Allegro – Trio. This is {{a somber}} movement, quite {{distinct}} from the typical atmosphere of dance movements. It is relatively conservative in its key scheme, moving to the relative major key {{and back to the}} tonic. In the B section, a sequence of hemiolas is interrupted by a dramatic interpolation in A-flat major, referencing the departure to this key in the opening of the Allegro with the added minor 6th. The second A section is a <b>transformation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first, interrupted every four bars by a silent bar, creating a mysterious atmosphere. The trio is in A-flat major, ternary form, with a B section beginning in E-flat major colored by its own minor 6th, and modulating to G-flat major via the parallel minor.|$|E

5|$|Swarming {{behaviour}} is {{a response}} to overcrowding. Increased tactile stimulation of the hind legs causes an increase in levels of serotonin. This causes the locust to change colour, eat much more, and breed much more easily. The <b>transformation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> locust to the swarming form is induced by several contacts per minute over a four-hour period. A large swarm can consist of billions of locusts spread out over an area of thousands of square kilometres, with a population of up to 80 million individuals per square kilometre (200 million per square mile). When desert locusts meet, their nervous systems release serotonin, which causes them to become mutually attracted, a prerequisite for swarming.|$|E
