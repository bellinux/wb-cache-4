40|$|Objective—Understanding the {{mechanisms}} regulating normal and pathological angiogenesis {{is of great}} scientific and clinical interest. In this report, we show that mutations in 2 different aminoacyl-transfer RNA synthetases, threonyl tRNA synthetase (<b>tarsy</b> 58) or isoleucyl tRNA synthetase (iarsy 68), lead to similar increased branching angiogenesis in developing zebrafish. Approach and Results—The unfolded protein response pathway is activated by aminoacyl-transfer RNA synthetase deficiencies, and we show that unfolded protein response genes atf 4, atf 6, and xbp 1, {{as well as the}} key proangiogenic ligand vascular endothelial growth factor (vegfaa), are all upregulated in <b>tarsy</b> 58 and iarsy 68 mutants. Finally, we show that the protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase–activating transcription factor 4 arm of the unfolded protein response pathway is necessary for both the elevated vegfaa levels and increased angiogenesis observed in <b>tarsy</b> 58 mutants. Conclusions—Our results suggest that endoplasmic reticulum stress acts as a proangiogenic signal via unfolded protein response pathway–dependent upregulation of vegfaa. Daniel Castranova, Andrew E.

2500|$|In early August 2007, {{complaints}} about the Anti-Defamation League's refusal to acknowledge the Armenian Genocide led to Watertown, Massachusetts's, unanimous town council decision to end its participation in the ADL's [...] "No Place for Hate" [...] campaign.

Also in August 2007, an editorial in The Boston Globe criticized the ADL by saying that, [...] "as an organization concerned about human rights, it ought to acknowledge the genocide against the Armenian people during World War I, and criticize Turkish attempts to repress the memory of this historical reality". Then on August 17, 2007, the ADL fired its regional New England director, Andrew H. <b>Tarsy,</b> for breaking ranks with the main organization and for saying that the ADL should recognize the genocide.

40|$|Research into tardive dyskinesia, an {{involuntary}} movement disorder secondary to chronic neuroleptic treatment, {{has so far}} produced conflicting results with no clear clinical applications. Heterogeneous diagnostic criteria, research designs, and rating scales, plus an emphasis on single-drug trials, are probably responsible. A strategy of devel-oping pharmacological response profiles for patients participating in tardive dyskinesia research is suggested as one way to produce meaningful data, which may delin-eate pharmacological and clinical subtypes that would respond to different treatment approaches. Further suggestions are made about future trends {{in this area of}} research. Despite the large and expanding literature on clinical investigations of tardive dyskinesia, the treatment and prevention of this serious neuroleptic-induced movement dis-order remains nebulous and uncertain. A wide variety of drugs with many modes of action have been reported to improve tardive dyskinesia symptoms (<b>Tarsy</b> and Baldessarini 1976), but contradictory reports on the same drugs quickly follow, resulting in a continuous state of skepticism. For example, according to the current neurophar-macological hypothesis of tardive dyskinesia (dopaminergic-receptor hypersensirivity and dopaminergic-cholinergic imbalance), antidopamin-ergic and cholinergic drugs should improve tardive dyskinesia, whereas dopaminergic and anticholinergic drugs should make it worse (Gerlach, Reisby, and Randrup 1974). There is mounting evidence suggesting that this hypothesized response is not found in all patients and the opposite response occurs i...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY The {{effect of}} sodium valproate 1200 mg daily on the {{disability}} of Parkinsonism and on levodopa-induced dyskinesias was assessed in a double-blind crossover trial with matched placebo in 12 patients with Parkinson's disease. No objective {{change in the}} severity of Parkinsonism or dyskinesias was noted. However, six out of nine patients who completed the trial noted a slight to moderate improvement in their dyskinesias with no change in their Parkinsonism. Excess salivation improved in four subjects on sodium valproate. The amino acid gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is widespread throughout the nervous system where it generally functions as an in-hibitory neurotransmitter (Roberts, 1974). The importance of GABA in the motor system of man is not known, although the highest concentration of GABA in animals and man {{is found in the}} basal ganglia (Bird, 1976). The concentration of GABA and its synthesising enzyme 1 -glutamic acid decarboxylase is reduced by half in patients dying of Parkinson's disease (McGeer et al., 1973). In mammals, there is a GABAminergic path-way descending from the neostriatum to the sub-stantia nigra (Kim et al., 1971) which mediates an inhibitory effect on ascending nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathways (<b>Tarsy</b> et al., 1975). Thus, manipulation of GABA levels in the basal ganglia might be useful for the treatment of Parkinson's disease or affect the side effects of antiparkinsonism medication. Linnoila et al. (1976) have reported that sodium valproate (Epilim, Reckitt-Labaz), which raises brain GABA levels, improves the features of chronic tardive dyskinesias. We have investigated the action of sodium valproate in people with Parkinson's disease to determine whether this drug alters any aspect of disability in this disorder as well as to determine the action on levodopa-induced dyskinesias...|$|R
