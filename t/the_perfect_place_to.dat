This left the {{producers}} to film in a heavily populated area. Kenworthy noted [...] "Early on, we {{toyed with the idea}} of building a huge exterior set. That way we would have more control, because we were worried about having Roberts and Grant on public streets where we could get thousands of onlookers." [...] In the end they decided to film in the streets. Michell was worried [...] "that Hugh and Julia were going to turn up on the first day of shooting on Portobello Road, and there would be gridlock and we would be surrounded by thousands of people and paparazzi photographers who would prevent us from shooting". The location team, and security personnel prevented this, as well as preventing problems the presence of a film crew may have caused the residents of Notting Hill, who Michell believes were [...] "genuinely excited" [...] about the film. The location manager Sue Quinn, described finding locations and getting permission to film as [...] "a mammoth task". Quinn and the rest of her team had to write to thousands of people in the area, promising to donate to each person's favourite charity, resulting in 200 charities receiving money.|$|E

500|$|The plot of Monsters University details Mike and Sulley's first meeting, {{but this}} created a {{continuity}} error {{from the first}} film in which Mike tells Sulley [...] "You've been jealous of my good looks since the fourth grade." [...] Director Dan Scanlon {{said he had a}} dilemma with this line during pre-production, but he believed it was best if Mike and Sulley meet in college because, [...] "we wanted to see their relationship develop when they were adults. And we also felt like college is so much about self-discovery and figuring out who you are." [...] He added, [...] "It felt like <b>the</b> <b>perfect</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> do this, but we had that line. So we tried versions where they met young and then we skipped ahead to college. And we knew we didn't want to make Monsters Elementary." [...] Scanlon said during pre-production that, [...] "Pete Docter, the original director, and John Lasseter…finally said to me, 'it's great that you're honoring that, but you have to do what's right for the story.' So we made a tough decision to just have them be in college and put that line aside." [...] Scanlon later retconned the line from the first film as [...] "an old monster expression", saying that [...] "it's what monsters always say to each other." ...|$|E
500|$|When Willow and Tara {{first met}} in the fourth season, the writers did not intend the {{relationship}} to be romantic but the actors had such chemistry that, two episodes later, Whedon and the writing team took Alyson Hannigan and Amber Benson aside to inform them where it would go. For {{the rest of the}} season, the sexual relationship between Willow and Tara was represented metaphorically by witchcraft, and none of the WB executives realized it. In the end, Whedon praised the way the WB handled the display of affection in [...] "The Body", saying [...] "They raised an eyebrow, but they've been great. I give the WB props {{when it came to the}} [...] kiss. What I want to show is real affection, and 'The Body' turned out to be <b>the</b> <b>perfect</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> put it in. To the network's credit, they not only aired it, but they did not advertise it. I thought that was pretty classy." [...] Stephen Tropiano in Prime Time Closet: A History of Gays and Lesbians on TV writes that this approach was [...] "truly groundbreaking"; no long speech, no huge discovery: [...] "Like Willow, we're made to feel as if her love for Tara is the most natural thing in the world". Tropiano calls it [...] "A simple kiss. A quiet, simple moment. Two lovers kissing. Just like lovers do." ...|$|E

In The Anime Encyclopedia: A Guide to Japanese Animation Since 1917, Jonathan Clements and Helen McCarthy praises the series' complex plot and felt that animation designers' Shingo Araki and Michi Himeno had worked [...] "magic" [...] with both the anime series and the films. They also praised the grand soundtrack and director Shigeyasu Yamauchi's ability to stretch out the tension and chose <b>the</b> <b>perfect</b> <b>places</b> <b>to</b> stop an episode to keep audiences waiting for the next one. Clements and McCarthy did, however, find the series disturbing in that its main emotional impact comes from the audience seeing [...] "older boys and men fighting brave but naive teenagers" [...] and through victories earning more weapons.

40|$|Provincial {{historical}} archives (AHP for its Spanish acronym) {{have always been}} the memory of official power in the peripheries. But in a context in which archives and archivists no longer conceive ourselves as merely passive papers' recipients, but rather as actors in the collective memory's construction, it is necessary to consider whether this classical function can be maintained today. Some relatively recent elements are coming up to question the role and even the very existence of AHPs: the management of electronic documents and the "unique electronic archive"; The opening of the notion of archiving to areas such as art or literature; The experiences of approaching small personal and family archives [...] . For this purpose, two approaches are proposed. On the one hand, to assume decidedly and without complexes that AHPs are, above all, places of culture. Although the archivist profession currently seems to be involved in "document management", in its more technical and administrative sense, the fact remains that citizens continue to perceive archives as cultural elements. And this {{does not have to be}} negative, as demonstrated by the huge public projection of the great "historical" archives. On the other hand, it is necessary to collect documents produced outside the power that are kept away from the archives (from personal funds to records seized from criminal groups) and which form a clearly alternative and complementary memory to the official memory. The AHPs, which already have the memory of power, have the minimum means to guarantee professional treatment of these documents, and at the same time they are not as remote (geographically and psychologically) as the large archives. They are, therefore, <b>the</b> <b>perfect</b> <b>places</b> <b>to</b> preserve this alternative memory...|$|R
