40|$|Abstract Background The {{nature of}} the {{relationship}} between a clinical investigator and a research subject has generated considerable debate because <b>the</b> <b>investigator</b> occupies two distinct roles: clinician and scientist. As a clinician, <b>the</b> <b>investigator</b> has duties to provide the patient with optimal care and undivided loyalty. As a scientist, <b>the</b> <b>investigator</b> has duties to follow the rules, procedures and methods described in the protocol. Results and conclusion In this article, I present a contextual approach to the investigator-subject relationship. The extent of <b>the</b> <b>investigator's</b> duty to provide the patient/subject with clinical care can vary from one situation to the next, as a function of several factors, including: the research design, benefits and risks of the research; the subject's reasonable expectations, motivations, and vulnerabilities; <b>the</b> <b>investigator's</b> ability to benefit the subject; and <b>the</b> <b>investigator's</b> prior relationship with the subject. These and other factors need to be considered when determining <b>the</b> clinical <b>investigator's</b> obligations to provide clinical care to human research subjects. In some research contexts, <b>the</b> <b>investigator</b> has extensive clinical obligations to the patient/subject; in others, <b>the</b> <b>investigator</b> has minimal ones. </p...|$|R
30|$|<b>The</b> <b>investigator</b> {{typically}} assigns {{an interpretation}} to each fire pattern {{as to how}} {{it may have been}} created, which in turn assists <b>the</b> <b>investigator</b> in determining how the fire spread. This process has significant potential for uncertainty, as the initial conditions are generally unknown to <b>the</b> <b>investigator.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> animal cruelty <b>investigator</b> must file a {{claim to}} the {{magistrate}} to seize an animal.

5|$|The {{extent of}} the damage meant it was not {{possible}} to determine the exact source of ignition, but possibilities include an emergency generator and the depot's fire pump system. <b>The</b> <b>investigators</b> did not believe that it was caused either by the driver of a fuel tanker, as had been speculated, or by anyone using a mobile phone. It was felt unlikely that the explosion had a widespread effect on air quality at ground level.|$|E
40|$|Investigation itself puts its {{professional}} {{print on}} <b>the</b> <b>investigator's</b> psychology, developing his abilities, skills, interest and even other features, which shape {{the profile of}} a forensic <b>investigator.</b> <b>The</b> <b>investigator</b> is different from any other specialist, firstly because he is faced daily, with a lot of scenarios, people with different personalities, activities, the reasons of these activities, their consequences and their causes. <b>The</b> <b>investigator</b> is obliged to focus, relatively with ease and fastness in many situations and problems, focusing on them, analyze them deeply and objectively. The facts above mentioned allow <b>the</b> <b>investigator</b> to fast develop his skills within this main link and, based on them, to manage to discover the course of actions. This develops in him, the observation capacity, intuition, attention to details, a good memory, logical thinking and analysis. Throughout this paper, we shall present a few important aspects related to <b>the</b> <b>investigator's</b> psychology, subject of the criminal act, where we shall focus our attention of <b>the</b> <b>investigator's</b> psychology, psychology during the interrogation of <b>the</b> defendant, <b>the</b> <b>investigator's</b> psychology while interrogating the witness, but also <b>the</b> <b>investigator</b> self-control and its role in performing an investigation, all these seen through the critical eye of the professional. In the end, we shall present a few conclusions and recommendations for a complete and objective investigation...|$|R

5|$|Engines and {{propellers}} numbers 1 to 3 suffered substantial {{damage in}} the crash, but engine and propeller number 4 suffered much less damage. <b>The</b> <b>investigators</b> determined {{that at the time}} of impact, propellers 1, 2 and 3 were turning normally and their engines were producing power but propeller number 4 was feathered and its engine was not operating. There was also some evidence that action was taken by the crew to unfeather propeller number 4 in the moments before impact. None of the engines contained evidence of any internal failure prior to impact. All the magnetos were tested and the results indicated normal ignition was available to all engines up to the time of impact.|$|E

For this he was spared execution and was given 15 years of hard labor. His confession was full of absurdities, and thus he was not used as a Soviet prosecution witness during the Nuremberg trials.

5|$|On February 21, 2007, NASA and Nature {{released}} {{news that}} HD 209458 b {{was one of}} the first two extrasolar planets to have their spectra directly observed, the other one being HD 189733 b. This was long seen as the first mechanism by which extrasolar but non-sentient life forms could be searched for, by way of influence on a planet's atmosphere. A group of investigators led by Jeremy Richardson of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center spectrally measured HD 209458 b's atmosphere in the range of 7.5 to 13.2 micrometres. The results defied theoretical expectations in several ways. The spectrum had been predicted to have a peak at 10 micrometres which would have indicated water vapor in the atmosphere, but such a peak was absent, indicating no detectable water vapor. Another unpredicted peak was observed at 9.65 micrometres, which <b>the</b> <b>investigators</b> attributed to clouds of silicate dust, a phenomenon not previously observed. Another unpredicted peak occurred at 7.78 micrometres, for which <b>the</b> <b>investigators</b> did not have an explanation. A separate team led by Mark Swain of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory reanalyzed the Richardson et al. data, and had not yet published their results when the Richardson et al. article came out, but made similar findings.|$|E

However, it is typically up to each community and/or its legislature to enact a smoking ban. <b>The</b> <b>investigator</b> can be expected to lack the political power to cause precisely those communities in the randomly selected treatment group to pass a smoking ban.

5|$|The case baffles Colton, as {{the only}} common {{elements}} in the murders are the lack of entry points and the apparent removal of the victims' livers with bare hands.

At the crime scene, Mulder notices an elongated fingerprint on the air vent, which he also finds {{to be similar to}} some documented in the X-Files. He concludes that because five murders occurred during the earlier sprees, <b>the</b> <b>investigators</b> should expect two more.|$|E

5|$|As the {{aircraft}} flew eastwards over the outer suburbs of Perth numerous witnesses observed {{that it was}} flying at a lower altitude than usual for the daily Skymaster services, {{and at least one}} of the engines was running roughly and backfiring at regular intervals. In the minutes before it crashed, witnesses heard a number of different engine noises – sometimes operating normally, sometimes all engine noise ceased, only to be replaced by a very loud, high-pitched scream. When the wrecked engines were examined many weeks after the accident a significant amount of corrosion product was found in the fuel system within two of the engines. After a preliminary investigation, Investigators from the Department of Civil Aviation believed the water responsible for the corrosion was also responsible for rough running of at least one engine, and ultimately temporary loss of power from all engines on at least one occasion. <b>The</b> <b>Investigators</b> did not find a likely source for the water.|$|E
