5|$|The album's working {{title was}} {{originally}} announced as Magic's in the Makeup in May 1998 {{and later as}} Saturn Returns in November 1999.

5|$|After {{reporting}} {{appearances of}} a tall woman in black who vanishes, and her teacher recommending {{that she was not}} herself, her mother took her to a physician.

At the request of her family, she was informed by the hospital chaplain, Joseph Brennan, a newly ordained Catholic priest, <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to die. Though the illness was painful, she remained cheerful, meekly accepted her fate, and offered up her suffering to God. Brennan was deeply impressed by her faith and visited her daily. While dying, Richard prayed for other individuals to be healed or to be converted to Catholicism. The Director of Pediatrics at the hospital, Theresita Crowley, a nun, also witnessed her calm acceptance of suffering and prayers for others.

Deborah told Sorkin <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to Guantanamo Bay to defend a group of Marines who came close to killing a fellow Marine in a hazing ordered by a superior officer. Sorkin took that information and wrote much of his story on cocktail napkins while bartending at the Palace Theatre. He and his roommates had purchased a Macintosh 512K so when he returned home he would empty his pockets of the cocktail napkins and type them into the computer, forming a basis from which he wrote many drafts for A Few Good Men.|$|E
5|$|For {{eight months}} over 1875–76, the Prince of Wales was absent from Britain {{on a tour}} of India, but to her dismay Alexandra was left behind. The prince had planned an all-male group and {{intended}} to spend much of the time hunting and shooting. During the prince's tour, one of his friends who was travelling with him, Lord Aylesford, was told by his wife <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to leave him for another man: Lord Blandford, who was himself married. Aylesford was appalled and decided to seek a divorce. Meanwhile, Lord Blandford's brother, Lord Randolph Churchill, persuaded the lovers against an elopement. Now concerned by the threat of divorce, Lady Aylesford sought to dissuade her husband from proceeding but Lord Aylesford was adamant and refused to reconsider. In an attempt to pressure Lord Aylesford to drop his divorce suit, Lady Aylesford and Lord Randolph Churchill called on Alexandra and told her that if the divorce was to proceed they would subpoena her husband as a witness and implicate him in the scandal. Distressed at their threats, and following the advice of Sir William Knollys and the Duchess of Teck, Alexandra informed the queen, who then wrote to the Prince of Wales. The prince was incensed. Eventually, the Blandfords and the Aylesfords both separated privately. Although Lord Randolph Churchill later apologised, for years afterwards the Prince of Wales refused to speak to or see him.|$|E
