The effects of transverse normal stress and <b>transverse</b> <b>flexibility</b> of layers are considered {{in the development of}} the proposed formulation. In order to increase the computational accuracy, all kinematic and stress continuity conditions are satisfied at layer interfaces. Moreover, for the first time, both the electrically induced strain components and the <b>transverse</b> <b>flexibility</b> are taken into account in the proposed formulation. Despite the fact that the number of unknown mechanical parameters in this theory is only one degree higher than the first order shear deformation theory, the accuracy is surprisingly more pronounced for the thicker beams...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: A new {{equivalent}} three-degree-of-freedom (TDOF) spring–mass– damper (SMD) {{model has}} proposed {{to predict the}} low-velocity impact response of composite sandwich panels with transversely flexible core. Impacts are assumed to occur normally over the top face-sheet with the arbitrary different impactor masses and initial velocities. The interaction between the impactor and the panel is modeled {{with the help of}} a new proposed system having TDOF consisting of springs, damper, and masses. An analytical procedure that includes the <b>transverse</b> <b>flexibility</b> and structural damping of the core has not yet been dealt with. In the present model, the effects of <b>transverse</b> <b>flexibility</b> of the core and structural damping of the panel are considered analytically. The analysis yields analytic functions describing the history of contact force, displacements of the impactor and the panel in the transverse direction etc. The effects of some physical and geometrical parameters such as initial potential energy of the impactor, the aspect ratio of the panel, location of the impacted point on the panel and the material density of the core on dynamic response of composite sandwich panels have been discussed...|$|E

40|$|A good {{understanding}} of the steady state dynamic behavior of a geared system is {{required in order to}} design reliable and quiet transmissions. This study focuses on a system containing a spur gear pair with backlash and periodically time-varying mesh stiffness, and rolling element bearings with clearance type non-linearities. A dynamic finite element model of the linear time-invariant (LTI) system is developed. Effects of several system parameters, such as torsional and <b>transverse</b> <b>flexibilities</b> of the shafts and prime mover/load inertias, on free and force vibration characteristics are investigated. Several reduced order LTI models are developed and validated by comparing their eigen solution with the finite element model results. Several key system parameters such as mean load and damping ratio are identified and their effects on the non-linear frequency response are evaluated quantitatively. Other fundamental issues such as the dynamic coupling between non-linear modes, dynamic interactions between component non-linearities and time-varying mesh stiffness, and the existence of subharmonic and chaotic solutions including routes to chaos have also been examined in depth...|$|R

The opposite behavior occurs in the postbuckling/postcritical range.

The character of in-plane boundary conditions is a determinant of both increasing/decreasing buckling loads and increasing/decreasing vibratory frequencies...|$|R

The transverse displacement within the element is approximated by a quintic polynomial; the bending strains thus vary cubically within the element. <b>Transverse</b> shear <b>flexibility</b> is {{taken into account in}} the stiffness formulation.

40|$|The {{study of}} {{composite}} beams is characterised by {{the connection between}} the two components: the concrete slab and the steel girder. In this thesis, two different problems, related to this connection were studied: the problem of partial interaction in composite beams of long spans with low degrees of shear connection, and the problem of <b>transverse</b> <b>flexibility</b> of the stud connection 'joint' between the concrete slab and the steel beam as part of a discrete inverted U-frame. This thesis is therefore divided into two separate parts. The study of beams with partial shear connection and solid slabs or slabs with metal decking is considered in the first part. Such beams, with a uniform stud spacing over each shear span, with spans longer than 10 m - generally propped during construction, and with low degrees of shear connection, could fail prematurely and suddenly in shear rather than gradually in bending, due to the limited slip deformation capacity of the studs in shear. In order to investigate the behaviour of simply supported and continuous composite beams with different degrees of shear connection, different geometry and different shear spans under design ultimate loading conditions, a numerical computer simulation program was written. The program takes account of the relative displacement between the slab and the beam and the non-linear behaviour of steel, concrete and stud connectors. A data bank of maximum slip results for different beams is obtained for ultimate beam loads designed to the interpolation method in Eurocode 4. The computer simulation gives a conservative but safe assessment of the suitability of the degree of interaction for a specific design ultimate load. The results were used to formulate a tentative design method for composite beams with solid slabs and partial shear connection. Discrete inverted U-frame action exists between composite bridge beams with intermittent vertical web stiffeners which provide lateral restraint to the bottom flange in the hogging bending region near the internal supports. The design method in BS 5400 :Part 3 for discrete U-frame action gives values for the <b>transverse</b> <b>flexibility</b> of a number of standard structural steel connections which are used in the calculation of the effective buckling length and the lateral deflection of the compression flange. To obtain similar values for steel-concrete joints, tests were done to scale 1 : 1 on six flange-slab connections with different stud configurations, but constant conservative dimensions for the steel flange and the concrete slab. Their crack patterns can be predicted by using a truss analogy. All test specimens either failed in shear or by puffing out of the studs, and shear cracking and shear failure criteria for concrete beams can be used to predict the cracking and failure loads. The transverse elastic flexibiities of the joints in these tests only represent the behaviour of the same joints in a complete structure up {{to the point where the}} shear cracks propagated over the full width of the specimens. Based on these few test results, a limited tentative design equation is proposed for the <b>transverse</b> <b>flexibility</b> of these type of stud connections, although further research is required into the influence of the increased flexibility on the buckling mode and the variation of the flexibility with variables other than the stud configurations...|$|E

In the present paper, an accurate finite element model is presented for bending analysis of soft-core rectangular sandwich plates. The sandwich plate is composed of three layers: top and bottom skins and core layer. The core is assumed as a soft orthotropic material and skins are assumed generally unequal laminated composites. Finite element model of {{the problem has been}} constructed in the ANSYS 11. 0 standard code area. Continuity conditions of transverse shear stresses at the interfaces are satisfied as well as the conditions of zero transverse shear stresses on the upper and lower surfaces of plate. Also <b>transverse</b> <b>flexibility</b> and transverse normal strain and stress of core are considered. The effect of geometrical parameters of the sandwich plate are studied. Comparison of the present results with those of plate theories confirms the accuracy of the proposed model...|$|E
40|$|Three-dimensional bending {{and stress}} {{analyses}} of the rotating two-directional functionally graded annular/circular plates or disks have not been accomplished so far. This task is performed in the present paper, employing a finite element formulation with a C 1 -continuity. Therefore, both transversely graded and radially-graded plates may be analyzed as special cases of the present research. Distribution of the transverse loads as well as coefficients of the elastic foundation may be non-uniform. Mixed stress-based and displacement-based edge conditions are considered to cover many practical applications. Compatible Hermitian elements are employed to develop a consistent formulation and avoid jumps in the stress components at the elements interfaces. In contrast to the very limited works presented for the rotating functionally graded circular plates so far, the <b>transverse</b> <b>flexibility</b> and the transverse stress components are also considered in the present research. Finally, influences of the material properties distribution, angular speed, geometric parameters, and the elastic foundation on distributions of the stress and displacement components are investigated {{for a variety of}} edge and boundary conditions and some design criteria are extracted...|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn this paper, an {{analytical}} procedure for free vibrations of shear-deformable two-layer beams with interlayer slip is developed. The effect of <b>transverse</b> shear <b>flexibility</b> of two layers is {{taken into account}} in a general way by assuming that each layer behaves as a Timoshenko beam element. Therefore, the layers have independent shear strains that depend indeed on their own shear modulus. This is the main improvement of the proposed model compared to existing models where the <b>transverse</b> shear <b>flexibility</b> is ignored or {{taken into account in}} a simplified way in which the shear strains of both layers are assumed to be equal whatever the shear modulus of the layers. In the proposed model, the two layers are connected continuously and the partial interaction is considered by assuming a continuous relationship between the interface shear flow and the corresponding slip. Based on these key assumptions, the governing differential equation of the problem is derived using Hamilton's principle and is analytically solved. The solutions for the eigenfrequencies and eigenmodes of four single span two-layer beams with classical Euler boundary conditions, i. e. pinned-pinned, clamped-clamped, clamped-pinned and clamped-free, are presented. Next, some numerical applications dealing with these four beams are carried out in order to compare the eigenfrequencies obtained with the proposed model against two existing models which consider different kinematic assumptions. Finally, a parametric study is conducted with the aim to investigate the influence of varying material and geometric parameters on the eigenfrequencies, such as shear stiffness of the connectors, span-to-depth ratios, flexural-to-shear moduli ratios and layer shear moduli ratios...|$|R

I- and A-bands were clearly observed, and thick filaments were resolved along {{the periphery of the}} myofibril. Interfilament spacings correlated well with estimates from previous x-ray diffraction studies. Transverse stiffness was measured by using a blunt tip to indent a small section of the myofibrillar surface in the region of myofilament overlap. At 10 nm indention, the effective transverse stiffness (K(perpendicular)) of myofibrils in rigor solution (ATP-free, pCa 4. 5) was 10. 3 +/- 5. 0 pN nm(- 1) (mean +/- SEM, n = 8); in activating solution (pCa 4. 5), 5. 9 +/- 3. 1 pN nm(- 1); and in relaxing solution (pCa 8), 4. 4 +/- 2. 0 pN nm(- 1). The apparent transverse Young's modulus (E(perpendicular)) was 94 +/- 41 kPa in the rigor state and 40 +/- 17 kPa in the relaxed state. The value of E(perpendicular) for calcium-activated myofibrils (55 +/- 29 kPa) was approximately a tenth that of Young's modulus in the longitudinal direction, a difference that at least partly reflects the <b>transverse</b> <b>flexibility</b> of the myosin molecule...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{problem of}} {{transverse}} low-velocity {{impact on a}} linearly in-plane prestressed sandwich panel has been considered in this article. The panel may be subjected to initial in-plane biaxial normal and shear stresses {{along the edges of}} the panel. Impact is assumed to occur normally over the top or the bottom face-sheets, at arbitrary location. The boundary conditions of the top and the bottom face-sheets are independent. The interaction between the impactor and the panel is modeled {{with the help of the}} system having three-degrees-of-freedom (TDOF) consisting of springs–masses–dashpot (SMD) or springs–masses (SM). The effects of initial biaxial stresses and <b>transverse</b> <b>flexibility</b> of the core are considered analytically. In order to determine all components of the displacements, stresses and strains in the face-sheets and the core, a numerical procedure based on improved higher-order sandwich plate theory (IHSAPT) and Galerkin’s method, are employed. The deflections and the corresponding stresses in the panel with higher initial stresses are smaller than those with lower initial stresses. The effects of in-plane initial shear stresses on impact response are slightly greater than that of the other in-plane normal loading states...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} is {{concerned}} with an analysis of load and frequency interaction effects in the dynamic buckling of sandwich plates and shells with a soft, transversely flexible core. The analysis is based of a general geometrically nonlinear soft-core sandwich model presented and a corresponding extended Galerkin solution strategy presented earlier. In the present study, the formalism is adopted and transformed into an eigenvalue problem. Assuming large transverse average displacements but small amplitudes for the vibration problem, a partially decoupled problem is obtained where in a first step the static buckling and face wrinkling problems can be addressed without consideration of the dynamic problem. In a second step, the dynamic eigenvalue problem can be solved, using the static solution as input parameters. The model is applied in parametric studies on the vibration response of plane and doubly curved sandwich panels with rectangular projection. In all cases, strong interaction effects between the external static preload and the natural frequencies are observed.

40|$|Under driving conditions, {{a typical}} geared {{system may be}} {{subjected}} to large dynamic loads. Also, the vibration level of the geared system {{is directly related to}} the noise radiated from the gear box. The steady state dynamic behavior of the system is examined in order to design reliable and quiet transmissions. The scope is limited to a system containing a spur gear pair with backlash and periodically time varying mesh stiffness, and rolling element bearings with clearance type nonlinearities. The internal static transmission error at the gear mesh, which is of importance from high frequency noise and vibration control view point, is considered in the formulation in sinusoidal or periodic form. A dynamic finite element model of the linear time invariant (LTI) system is developed. Effects of several system parameters, such as torsional and <b>transverse</b> <b>flexibilities</b> of the shafts and prime mover/load inertias, on free and forced vibration characteristics are investigated. Several reduced order LTI models are developed and validated by comparing their eigen solutions with the finite element model results. Using the reduced order formulations, a three degree of freedom dynamic model is developed which includes nonlinearities associated with radical clearances in the radial rolling element bearings, backlash between a spur gear pair and periodically varying gear mesh stiffness. As a limiting case, a single degree of freedom model of the spur gear pair with backlash is considered and mathematical conditions for tooth separation and back collision are defined. Both digital simulation technique and analytical models such as method of harmonic balance and the method of multiple scales were used to develop the steady state frequency response characteristics for various nonlinear and/or time varying cases...|$|R

The originating problem is associated with preliminary studies for the ‘‘Global Range Transport’ ’ envisaged by the ‘‘New World Vistas’ ’ program of the United States Air Force. The modeling and analysis is conducted using a high-order sandwich theory formulation in which the elastic response of each face laminate is accounted for, including bending-stretching coupling and transverse shear deformations, and where the <b>transverse</b> <b>flexibility</b> of the core is included.

40|$|Composite (steel-concrete) ladder-decks {{represent}} one of {{the most}} common solutions in road bridges nowadays. In these structures the Serviceability Limit State (SLS) of vibrations is traditionally ignored or roughly addressed by means of simple static deflection-based approaches, inherently assuming that the vibrations are controlled by the fundamental longitudinal mode. This work demonstrates that a wide range of high-order vibrational modes, involving the transverse flexure of the slab between longitudinal girders, govern the accelerations recorded in the deck and inside the vehicles. In addition, a new methodology for analysing the Vehicle–Bridge Interaction is proposed, including the approaching platforms, the transition slabs, and the bridge joints. The results suggest that the riding comfort for vehicle users is specially affected by direct effects on the wheels, like the road roughness and possible construction misalignments at the bridge joints, as well as low-frequency vibrations coming from the deck in short or slender bridges. The filtering effects resulting from the average of the response in time and in space when calculating the root mean square acceleration are also explored, and new design parameters are provided. In addition, several structural features (such as the depth and spacing of the longitudinal and transverse steel beams, the thickness of the concrete slab, and the stiffness of the cantilever cross beams at the diaphragm sections) have been studied, and a set of new design criteria has been established. It has been demonstrated that the <b>transverse</b> <b>flexibility</b> of the deck (specially influenced by the support conditions and the slab thickness) is critically important for the users’ (pedestrians and vehicle passengers) comfort, as it controls the aforementioned high-order vibrational modes which govern the dynamic response...|$|E
40|$|Equivalent single- and multi-degree-of-freedom {{models have}} been {{developed}} for a flexible cam-follower mechanism. Both transverse and axial flexibility of the follower and return spring, as well as transverse and torsional flexibility of the camshaft have been included. In the multi-degree-of-freedom model, the camshaft is assigned two rotational degrees of freedom, one at the cam and the other at the flywheel. The follower mass has a degree of freedom in the axial as well as the transverse direction of the follower rod. The analytical models take into account the fluctuating camshaft angular speed as the input excitation. The governing equations of motion, with time-periodic coefficients, have been systematically developed. The return spring was believed to influence the follower response in ways previously not understood, necessitating a closer examination of its kinematics of deformation. An analytic expression for the transverse stiffness of a closed-coiled helical spring with an axial, transverse and end moment, has been derived. A closed-form expression is obtained when the ends are constrained to remain parallel. Such constraints, and the varying <b>transverse</b> <b>flexibility</b> of the return spring with axial deflection led to a newly described phenomenon of moment stiffening. A sideways tracking of the follower roller on the cam surface is observed, in an experimental cam-follower mechanism, for both the rise and return motions of the follower. It results from the camshaft deflection, causing the cam to exert a thrust load on the follower roller. The tracking gives rise to erroneous experimental cam rise and return profiles. Follower mass responses for Rise-Return-Rise and Rise-Dwell-Return-Dwell follower motion event types, and simple harmonic and polynomial cam rise and return profiles, have been investigated. The multi-degree-of-freedom model, unlike the single-degree-of-freedom model, uniformly predicts the experimental follower mass response accurately for both follower motion events. The overall frequency and amplitude contents of the analytical and experimental responses, noticeably during the top and bottom dwell periods, compare very favorably. Parametric stability charts are presented for both follower motion event types as well as the two cam rise and return profiles considered. ...|$|E

40|$|Since {{their first}} {{observation}} in 1991, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have attracted {{a lot of}} attention owing to their exceptional properties. Their excellent electrical and thermal conducting performances combined with their high toughness and <b>transverse</b> <b>flexibility</b> allow their use in a large range of varied applications. Offering {{at the same time a}} high aspect ratio (length-to-diameter) and a low density, carbon nanotubes show strong application potential in reinforced composite materials. Unfortunately, CNTs have the strong tendency to form bundles very difficult to dissociate and disperse in a majority of polymer matrices. Without efficient CNTs dispersion, nanocomposites can not present optimal mechanical, thermal and electrical properties. To overcome this drawback, one solution consists to graft polymer chains on the carbon nanotubes surface in order to disaggregate bundles and, in few cases, to improve interaction between the polymer matrix and nanotubes. The thesis work can be divided into three parts. The first is the one-step amination of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) via an original microwave plasma process. The MWNTs, placed in the post-discharge chamber in presence of H 2, are subjected to a reactive flow of atomic nitrogen produced by the plasma. The results give evidence for efficient covalent grafting of primary amine groups along the sidewalls of MWNTs, avoiding any structural damage and alteration of properties. The so-grafted amine groups have been further consider as initiation sites for promoting the ring opening polymerization of lactone monomers yielding polyester-grafted MWNT nanohybrids. Finally, these nanohybrids have been used as highly filled masterbatches to be dispersed in the molten state within several polymer matrices, such as polycaprolactone (PCL) and high density polyethylene (HDPE), to obtain nanocomposites with largely improved properties. For instance, electrical measurements and morphological characterizations showed that the polyester surface-grafting allows for improving the dispersion state of the nanotubes in the different polymer matrices leading to enhanced electrical properties as well as thermal and mechanical performances.

40|$|The dynamic {{analysis}} of highway bridges is very complex {{because of the}} interaction between the moving vehicle load and the bridge response. Analytical methods such as beam theory and orthotropic plate theory are applicable only to simple structures and highly simplified moving vehicle load models. The beam theory is applicable only to long and narrow bridges since it neglects the effect of <b>transverse</b> <b>flexibility</b> of the bridge. The orthotropic plate theory is only applicable to slab bridges under simple vehicle load models as complex vehicle models render the differential equation of equilibrium difficult or impossible to solve. The finite element method is a very powerful and versatile technique which can be applied to deal with any specific configuration of bridge structure, supports and vehicle load models. However, the efficiency of the method needs to be improved because the finite element solutions usually require too much computer time, too large core storage and too much data input. In addition to these deficiencies, in order to simulate the local of the moving concentrated wheel loads the finite element mesh should be refined in both directions. The finite strip method has already proven to be the most efficient numerical technique for the static analysis of bridges. In fact the method is even more efficient for {{dynamic analysis}} of bridges. The structure can be divided into a number of finite strips. In each strip the displacement components at any point are expressed in terms of the displacement parameters of nodal lines by means of simple polynomials in the transverse direction and a continuously differentiable smooth series in the longitudinal direction. Thus, the number of dimensions of the analysis is reduced by one. The minimum number of degrees of freedom along a nodal line in the finite strip method is equal to twice times the number of terms used in the series and this is normally much less than that for finite element method, which requires a minimum of three times the number of nodes along the same line. Hence the size and the bandwidth of the matrices are greatly reduced, and consequently it can be handled by personal computers and solved in much shorter time. In this study the finite strip method is applied to dynamic analysis of simply supported single span slab bridges, slab-on girder bridges, box girder bridges and multi-span bridges by using various vehicle load models. Harmonic analysis of beams is covered in Chapter Two as an introduction for the finite strip method.

Characteristic curves indicating the average longitudinal direct stress resultant {{as a function of the}} applied displacements are calculated based on four different theories: Classical von Karman, first-order shear deformation, higher-order shear deformation, and three-dimensional flexibility. Present results indicate that the three-dimensional flexibility theory gives the lowest and therefore, most accurate results. The higher-order shear deformation theory has fewer unknowns than the three-dimensional flexibility but is not as accurate. The figures presented show that small differences occur in the maximum stress resultants and the transverse displacements calculated when the effects of transverse shear are included...|$|R

40|$|Innovative {{composite}} materials are frequently used in designing aerospace, naval and automotive components. In the typical structure of composites, multiple layers are stacked {{together with a}} particular sequence {{in order to give}} specific mechanical properties. Layers are organized with different angles, different sequences and different technological process to obtain a new and innovative material. From the standpoint of engineering designer it is useful to consider the single layer of composite as macroscopically homogeneous material. However, composites are non homogeneous bodies. Moreover, layers are not often perfectly bonded together and delamination often occurs. Other violations of lamination theory hypotheses, such as plane stress and thin material, are not unusual and in many cases the <b>transverse</b> shear <b>flexibility</b> and the thickness-normal stiffness should be considered. Therefore the real behaviour of {{composite materials}} {{is quite different from the}} predictions coming from the traditional lamination theory. Due to the increasing structural performance required to innovative composites, the knowledge of the mechanical properties for different loading cases is a fundamental source of concern. Experimental characterization of materials and structures in different environmental conditions is extremely important to understand the mechanical behaviour of these new materials. The purpose of the present work is to characterize a composite material developed for aerospace applications and produced by means of the resin film infusion process (RFI). Different tests have been carried out: tensile, open-hole and filled-hole tensile, compressive, openhole and filled-hole compressive. The experimental campaign has the aim to define mechanical characteristics of this RFI composite material in different conditions: environmental temperature, Hot/Wet and Cold...|$|R
40|$|The optimal {{vibration}} {{control of a}} rotating, composite, pretwisted, single-celled box beam, exhibiting <b>transverse</b> shear <b>flexibility</b> and restrained warping, is analyzed. A higher-order shear deformation theory (HSDT) enabling satisfaction of traction-free boundary conditions is employed. An orthotropic host with Circumferentially Uniform Stiffness ply angle configuration and transversely isotropic sensors-actuator pairs that are surface embedded along the span are considered. The total output from sensors {{is fed to a}} controller and then uniformly applied to actuators. The extended Galerkin method, along with either instantaneous or classical LQR methods, is used. Instantaneous LQR provides greater response attenuation in case of sustained external forcing. Results are obtained for a linear spanwise variation of pretwist. Compared to the unshearable and first-order shearable (FSDT) models, the HSDT appears most sensitive to pretwist and - when a saturation constraint is considered - it predicts the lowest settling time. The HSDT predicts significant attenuation in response and power required as compared to the FSDT, the differences being especially pronounced for constrained input control. Parametric studies involving the ply angle, pretwist, and patch length are performed. An optimum pretwist that yields lowest response, power, and settling time is obtained. Its value differs when the saturation constraint is used. Tailoring provides greater attenuation at the expense of an increase in settling time. Using constrained input control, an order-of-magnitude reduction in power requirement is possible via tailoring. The results underscore the importance of shear strain variation across the beam wall, and also of synthesizing active control with tailoring, for achieving efficient control...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MTech (Mechanical Engineering)) [...] Peninsula Technikon, 1998 However, {{studies were}} also {{conducted}} for the buckling of composite laminates involving temperature distribution. Chen and Chen (1991) studied thermal buckling of laminated plates under uniform and nonuniform temperature distribution using the eight-node Serendipity finite element. Mathew, Singh and Rao (1992) investigated thermal buckling of antisymmetric cross-ply composite laminates with a onedimensional furite element having two nodes and six degrees of freedom. Chandrashekhara (1992) accounted for <b>transverse</b> shear <b>flexibility</b> by using the thermo-elastic version of the first-order shear deformation theory. This will also {{be the case in}} this report. Literature on buckling and laminated composites abounds. Brush and Aimroth (1975) published a book on Buckling of Bars, Plates, and Shells, while Bushnell (1985) surveyed the Methods and Modes of Behaviour in Static Collapse. The foundation for the study of composite materials was based on the references [8], [10], [15] and [18]. The use of the Finite Element Method to analyse the buckling behaviour of laminated structures comes from references [I], [4]. [I 2]. [16], [24] and [32]. Reference [14] provided the basis for the formulation of the variation of the governing equations. Most of the ideas in this report are based on these publications and references. Chapter I of this report introduces the concept of a composite. the formation of a composite and a brief overview of the elements of a composite material. This chapter also presents the concept of buckling that will form the basis of the development of this project. At the end of this chapter the choice of the element that is used in this study is justified. Chapter 2 provides the fundamentals of elasticity that relate to the deformation of a loaded body. In this Chapter the stresses and strains are defined and the temperature terms are introduced. In Chapter 3 the Mindlin plate theory is presented with a view to laying the foundation for the analysis of laminated plates, and as a starting point in the formulation of thermal buckling behaviour of laminated plates. In Chapter 4 the elements of a composite material are discussed and the constitutive equations of a laminated composite plate are built. Also the idea of lamination is introduced and the various simplifications that can be introduced as a result of lamination are discussed. The non-linear equilibrium equations and the stability analysis of a composite plate are formulated in Chapter 5 using the conventional anal} 1 ical method. The resulting equations justify the use of the Finite Element Method as introduced in Chapter 6 and it is the method by which the governing equations will be solved in ABAQUS computer analysis. The results for various computer runs are presented for a normal plate, a plate with a square hole, and the plate ""ith a circular cut-out in Chapter 7. Also in chapter 7 a comparison is made between the laminate "ith a central hole and a normal plate to study the effect of a cut-out on a critical buckling temperature. Appendices A deals the transverse shear in plates, and Appendix B deals with the transformation of the laminate elastic constants form the principal material direction to the general Cartesian co-ordinates. Also in Appendix B the laminate stiffness matrices and these matrices are briefly evaluated analytically. Appendix C is about the governing equations of laminated composites, while Appendix D gives a full representation of the abbreviated finite element equations of Chapter 6. Appendix E presents the list of ABAQUS input files that were used in the computer simulation of Chapter 7...|$|R
