40|$|Twenty-seven {{kindergarten}} {{children were}} trained cn two different double classification matrix tasks {{in an attempt}} to determine whether <b>the</b> <b>tasks</b> were hierarchically related.

40|$|This {{study is}} mainly {{intended}} {{to find out}} the extent to which tasks in English work books are designed to develop the students’ communicative competence. The objective {{of this study is to}} describe how <b>the</b> <b>tasks</b> in Edukatif work books are designed to develop students’ discourse competence, linguistic competence, actional competence, sociolinguistic competence, and strategic competence. This study is a qualitative research which involves content analysis approach. The data are <b>the</b> <b>tasks</b> in Edukatif work books used by eight grade students of the first and second semester. In collecting the data, the writer uses documentation method. The data analysis used Huberman and Miles’ concept which involves data reduction, data display and verification. The findings show that among the five competences and its components of communicative com- petence, some components are not well developed in the work books. <b>The</b> <b>tasks</b> develop all components of discourse competence except one aspect in linguistic competence, that is, phonology. <b>The</b> <b>tasks</b> develop all components of actional competence except the speech act. <b>The</b> <b>tasks</b> develop components of sociolinguistic competence except the cultural and non-verbal communicative factor. <b>The</b> <b>tasks</b> develop only one component of strategic competence, that is, time gaining strategy. The conclusion is that <b>the</b> <b>tasks</b> in Edukatif work books are sufficient to develop the students’ discourse, linguistic, and actional competence. <b>The</b> <b>tasks,</b> however, are not sufficient to develop students’ sociolinguistic and strategic competence...|$|R
