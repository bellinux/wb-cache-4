40|$|Abstract. AC 4 C cast {{aluminum}} alloy and zinc-coated steel were friction stir lap welded, and the microstructures and mechanical properties of <b>the</b> <b>joints</b> were examined and analyzed. Experimental {{results show that}} the welding speeds {{have a significant effect on}} the tensile properties and fracture locations of <b>the</b> <b>joints</b> at a rotational speed of 1500 rpm. When the welding speed is higher than 60 mm/min, <b>the</b> <b>joints</b> fracture in <b>the</b> zinc-coated steel base material and the tensile strength is equal to that of the zinc-coated steel; when the welding speed is lower than 60 mm/min, <b>the</b> <b>joints</b> fracture in <b>the</b> interface and the shear strength is about 50 MPa. The change of the fracture locations is attributed to the presence of large quantity intermetallic compounds adjacent to the interface of <b>the</b> <b>joints.</b> <b>The</b> composition and formation mechanism of the intermetallic compounds and its effect on the mechanical properties of <b>the</b> <b>joints</b> were discussed...|$|R
40|$|The work aims to {{investigate}} the nonlinear behavior of pultruded <b>joints</b> and <b>the</b> related dissipation capacity through a three-dimensional FE progressive failure analysis of different GFRP beam-column and column-base bolted connections.

5|$|As he had as {{governor}} of Kentucky, Ford gave attention to improving the efficiency of government. While serving on <b>the</b> <b>Joint</b> Committee on Printing during the One Hundred First and One Hundred Third Congresses, he saved the government {{millions of dollars in}} printing costs by printing in volume and using recycled paper. In 1998, Virginia senator John Warner sponsored the Wendell H. Ford Government Publications Reform Act of 1998; Ford signed on as a co-sponsor. The bill would have eliminated <b>the</b> <b>Joint</b> Committee on Printing, distributing its authority and functions among the Senate Rules Committee, the House Oversight Committee, and the administrator of the Government Printing Office. It would also have centralized government printing services and penalized government agencies who did not make their documents available to the printing office to be printed. Opponents of the bill cited the broad powers granted to the printing office and concerns about the erosion of copyright protection. The bill was reported favorably out of committee, but was squeezed from the legislative calendar by issues related to the impending impeachment of Bill Clinton. Warner did not return to his chairmanship of <b>the</b> <b>Joint</b> Committee on Printing in the next congress, Ford retired from the Senate, and the bill was not re-introduced.|$|E

5|$|At the Pacific Military Conference in March 1943, <b>the</b> <b>Joint</b> Chiefs of Staff {{approved}} {{the latest version}} of General MacArthur's Elkton plan for an advance on Rabaul.

30|$|This {{numerical}} {{study investigated}} the effects of different reinforcing details in beam-column <b>joints</b> on <b>the</b> blast resistance of <b>the</b> <b>joints.</b> Due to increasing manmade and/or natural high rate accidents such as impacts and blasts, the resistance of critical civil and military infrastructure or buildings should be sufficiently obtained under those high rate catastrophic loads. <b>The</b> beam-column <b>joint</b> in buildings is one of critical parts influencing on the resistance of those buildings under extreme events such as earthquakes, impacts and blasts. Thus, the details of reinforcements in <b>the</b> <b>joints</b> should be well designed for enhancing the resistance of <b>the</b> <b>joints</b> under <b>the</b> events. Parameters numerically investigated in this study include diagonal, flexural, and shear reinforcing steel bars. The failure mechanism of <b>the</b> <b>joints</b> could be controlled by the level of tensile stress of reinforcing steel bars. Among various reinforcing details in <b>the</b> <b>joints,</b> diagonal reinforcement in <b>the</b> <b>joints</b> {{was found to be}} most effective for enhancing the resistance under blast loads. In addition, shear reinforcements also produced favourable effects on the blast resistance of beam-column joints.|$|R
40|$|Beam-column joints are {{recognized}} as the critical and vulnerable zone of a Reinforced Concrete (RC) moment resisting structure subjected to seismic loads. During an earthquake, the global response of the structure is mainly governed by the behaviour of <b>the</b> <b>joints.</b> If <b>the</b> <b>joints</b> behave in a ductile manner, the global behaviour generally will be ductile, whereas if <b>the</b> <b>joints</b> behave in a brittle fashion then the structure will display a brittle behaviour. <b>The</b> <b>joints</b> of old and non-seismically detailed structures are more vulnerable and behave poorly under the earthquakes compared to <b>the</b> <b>joints</b> of new and seismically detailed structures. Therefore, more often than not, <b>the</b> <b>joints</b> of such old structures require retrofitting in order to deliver better performance during earthquakes. Various researchers have proposed different methods to retrofit <b>the</b> beam-column <b>joints</b> of existing RC structures. This paper reports a few experimental investigations carried out for seismic retrofitting of RC beam-column joints using different techniques. The concepts behind each of them and their practical usefulness have been brought out...|$|R

30|$|These {{characteristic}} responses {{arise from}} the nonlinear load–slip relationships and the cyclic stiffness degradation of <b>the</b> nailed <b>joints</b> [2, 3]. That is, the cyclic decrease of the responsive accelerations and/or the cyclic increase of the responsive slips cause the gradual decline of the equivalent linear stiffness. This transition of the equivalent linear stiffness gradually decreases the resonant frequencies of <b>the</b> <b>joints</b> as indicated in Figs.  4 and 8. During the early phase of the dynamic response, <b>the</b> <b>joints</b> respond once sensitively to higher frequencies when the transitional resonant frequencies of <b>the</b> <b>joints</b> synchronize with those frequencies. After this early phase, however, the cyclic degradation of the equivalent stiffness decreases the resonant frequencies of <b>the</b> <b>joints,</b> which results in a dull response to the higher frequencies. The cyclic degradation of the equivalent stiffness, on the other hand, brings gradually the resonant frequencies of <b>the</b> <b>joints</b> close to <b>the</b> lower frequencies, which causes their critical failures.|$|R
