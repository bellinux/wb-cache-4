5|$|Comics {{historian}} Peter Sanderson {{compares the}} 1960s DC {{to a large}} Hollywood studio, and argues that after having reinvented the superhero archetype, DC by {{the latter part of}} the decade was suffering from a creative drought.

5|$|Albert Benjamin Chandler {{was born}} in the farming {{community}} of Corydon, Kentucky in 1898. He was the eldest child of Joseph Sephus and Callie (Saunders) Chandler. Chandler's father allegedly rescued his mother from an orphanage and married her when she was fifteen, though no record of their marriage has ever been found. In 1899, Chandler's brother Robert was born. Two years later, their mother, still in her <b>teens</b> <b>and</b> unable to cope with raising two young children, abandoned the family. She fled the state and left her sons with their father. In his autobiography, Chandler said his mother leaving them was his earliest memory. Years later, he sought his mother and found her living in Jacksonville, Florida. She had married again and he had three half-siblings. His full brother, Robert Chandler, died when he fell from a cherry tree when he was 13 years old.|$|E

He grew up pitching in the county league, and was both a right fielder and pitcher for the Chippewa Indians. After pitching for Chippewa in 1941, he was offered a contract for the 1942 season by the Pittsburgh Pirates.

In 26 games, he pitched in 203 innings, had a 16–10 win–loss record and a 3.59 ERA.|$|E

5|$|In North America, several {{volumes of}} the manga have ranked within the weekly Nielsen BookScan graphic novels list, {{including}} volume five at both sixth and ninth in October 2004, volume six at sixth in February 2005, and volume seven at seventh in June 2005. In 2004, the Yu Yu Hakusho manga serialization sparked a controversy when a Florida grade school teacher issued a complaint about material found in an issue of the American Shonen Jump magazine purchased by a fifth-grade student at a Scholastic Book Fair. The complaint centered around portions of the manga containing violence, mild profanity, a character wearing a swastika, and another character smoking a cigarette. About 18,000 copies of the publication (out of 120,000) were returned from the fairs {{as a result of}} the matter. A Viz spokesperson defended the manga, clarifying that it is intended for older <b>teens</b> <b>and</b> that the alleged swastika is actually a Buddhist manji.|$|E
5|$|In his youth, Morris {{excelled at}} rugby union {{as well as}} cricket, being {{selected}} for the state schoolboys' team in both sports. Originally trained in spin bowling, Morris developed as a batsman during his <b>teens</b> <b>and</b> during the 1940–41 season became the first {{player in the world}} to score two centuries on his first-class debut. His career was interrupted by the Second World War, during which he served in the Australian Army and gained selection in its rugby union team. Upon the resumption of cricket in 1946, Morris made his Test debut against England and quickly made himself a core member of the team. He made a century in his third match and scored twin centuries in the following Test, becoming only the second Australian to do so in an Ashes Test. His rise was such that he was made a selector during the Invincibles tour after only 18 months in the team.|$|E

5|$|Tokyopop's {{localized}} volumes {{appeared on}} ICv2's monthly top one-hundred selling graphic novels. The Rozen Maiden manga has received generally positive reviews. Anime News Network praised Peach-Pit's works as always {{being able to}} evoke excitement or laughter from its readers but was critical about Rozen Maidens lack of plot and criticized how the dialogue or layout can be vague. Comic Book Bin wrote that while Rozen Maiden was not a splendid manga, its emphasis on psychology and emotion was something American comics should follow to expand their readership. Active Anime praised several aspects of the series: the combination of mystery, comedy, and cuteness with a balance of fantasy and drama; the visual esthetics of the images and characters; and a broadness that extends towards <b>teens</b> <b>and</b> adults. Initially, Anime Land praised the balance between comedic daily life and the underlying {{dark side of the}} plot. In later volumes though, Anime Land criticized the story's pacing and the abrupt ending. In their review of the sequel, Anime Land wrote they were surprised by the dark tone and how the plot was confusing even with knowledge from the first series. Manga-News also praised the story's alteration between moments of peace and conflict but panned the latter volumes for being rushed and losing the story's complexity. In their review of the sequel, Manga-News praised the introduction for being interesting and accessible to new readers.|$|E
5|$|Pericoronitis is {{inflammation}} of the soft tissues surrounding the crown of a partially erupted tooth. The lower wisdom tooth is the last tooth to erupt into the mouth, and is, therefore, more frequently impacted, or stuck, against the other teeth. This leaves the tooth partially erupted into the mouth, and there frequently is a flap of gum (an operculum), overlying the tooth. Bacteria and food debris accumulate beneath the operculum, which {{is an area that}} is difficult to keep clean because it is hidden and far back in the mouth. The opposing upper wisdom tooth also tends to have sharp cusps and over-erupt because it has no opposing tooth to bite into, and instead traumatizes the operculum further. Periodontitis and dental caries may develop on either the third or second molars, and chronic inflammation develops in the soft tissues. Chronic pericoronitis may not cause any pain, but an acute pericoronitis episode is often associated with pericoronal abscess formation. Typical signs and symptoms of a pericoronal abscess include severe, throbbing pain, which may radiate to adjacent areas in the head and neck, redness, swelling and tenderness of the gum over the tooth. There may be trismus (difficulty opening the mouth), facial swelling, and rubor (flushing) of the cheek that overlies the angle of the jaw. Persons typically develop pericoronitis in their late <b>teens</b> <b>and</b> early 20s, as this is the age that the wisdom teeth are erupting. Treatment for acute conditions includes cleaning the area under the operculum with an antiseptic solution, painkillers, and antibiotics if indicated. After the acute episode has been controlled, the definitive treatment is usually by tooth extraction or, less commonly, the soft tissue is removed (operculectomy). If the tooth is kept, good oral hygiene is required to keep the area free of debris to prevent recurrence of the infection.|$|E

40|$|This study {{uses the}} 1970 state {{abortion}} reforms {{to estimate the}} effect of <b>teen</b> <b>and</b> out-of-wedlock childbearing on the schooling and labor market outcomes of mothers observed in 1980 and 1990 Census microdata. Reduced-form estimates suggest that state abortion reforms had {{a negative impact on}} teen marriage, <b>teen</b> fertility, <b>and</b> <b>teen</b> out- of-wedlock childbearing. The teen marriage effects are largest and most precisely estimated for white women while the <b>teen</b> fertility <b>and</b> out-of-wedlock childbearing effects are largest and most precisely estimated for black women. The relatively modest fertility and marriage consequences of abortion reform for white women do not appear to have changed schooling or labor market outcomes. In contrast, black women who were exposed to abortion reforms experienced large reductions in <b>teen</b> fertility <b>and</b> <b>teen</b> out-of-wedlock fertility that appear to have led to increased schooling and employment rates. Instrumental variables estimates of the effects of <b>teen</b> <b>and</b> out-of- wedlock childbearing on the schooling and employment status of black women, using measures of exposure to abortion reform as instruments, are marginally significant and larger than the corresponding OLS estimates. ...|$|R
