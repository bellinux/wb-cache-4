25|$|The final {{match to}} decide {{the fate of the}} legendary Ashes urn finally began, and <b>the</b> <b>proverbial</b> first blood was drawn by England as Michael Vaughan won his third toss of the series (much to the delight of the Brit Oval crowd). Vaughan elected to have his English side to bat first, and the English first innings got underway. Marcus Trescothick and Andrew Strauss added 82 for the first wicket, as England's batsmen looked to take on the Australians, but subtle spin {{variations}} bowled from Shane Warne yielded three wickets as England went to lunch on 115 for 3.|$|E

During {{the first year of}} the war the inhabitants of Birmingham apprehended all messengers and suspected persons; frequently attacked and reduced small parties of the Royalists, whom they sent prisoners to the fortified city of Coventry (the origin of <b>the</b> <b>proverbial</b> expression, send him to Coventry).|$|E
25|$|Don Eleuterio despises the Puerto Rican culture, but is {{a direct}} product of it. His {{commentary}} on Puerto Rican culture is affected by his personal experiences as a native of Puerto Rico and as a World War II veteran (in the character's beginnings, more recently the Korean War is used as {{to keep up with}} time). However, he has never set a foot outside Puerto Rico. His experience with true American culture is limited to the time he was stationed at a local United States Army camp near his home during the war. As a consequence of this, he considers <b>the</b> <b>proverbial</b> destination of most recent Puerto Rican émigrés, Orlando, Florida, to be the statehooders' equivalent of Mecca, with the giant Mickey Mouse-eared water tank near the entrance of Walt Disney World as the Kaabah.|$|E

25|$|In 1998, a {{study by}} Dietz, {{conducted}} at the University of Central Florida, found that of thirty-three games sampled, 41% did not feature female characters, 28% sexually objectified women, 21% depicted violence against women, and 30% did not represent the female population at all. Furthermore, characterizations of women tended to be stereotypical: highly sexualized ("visions of beauty with large breasts and hips"), dependent ("victim or as <b>the</b> <b>proverbial</b> Damsel in Distress"), opponents ("evil or as obstacles {{to the goal of}} the game"), and trivial ("females depicted in fairly non-significant roles"). However, the study is criticized for not including a wide range of video games for study and for including old games published up to twenty years ago which do not represent current industry standards, for example, an increased presence of strong female characters.|$|E
25|$|The {{reason for}} {{choosing}} Partridge for this role is unclear. Although he was, by then, {{one of the}} more eminent British surgeons, he never achieved the fame of his colleague, Sir William Fergusson. The Royal College of Surgeons' biography characterises him as 'a painstaking but not a brilliant surgeon; minute in detail and hesitating in execution'. More importantly, he had no experience with gunshot injuries. The contemporary medical press attacked the mission for its serious breach in medical etiquette in presuming to consult on a patient without having been invited to do so by the attending medical practitioners. It amounted to patient stealing, and was an affront to the dignity of the profession (newly self-regulating since the creation of the General Medical Council in 1858). The Lancet was also scathing about the 'new manifestation of <b>the</b> <b>proverbial</b> insular pride which is ever insisting upon the immense superiority of everything British'.|$|E
25|$|Although {{initially}} {{put off by}} Mrs Burton-Cox's attitude, Mrs Oliver {{decides to}} resolve the issue after consulting with Celia about her parents' death, and invites her friend Hercule Poirot to solve the disquieting puzzle. Together, they conduct interviews with several elderly witnesses associated with the case, whom they term “elephants”, based on the assumption that, like <b>the</b> <b>proverbial</b> elephants, they may have long memories. Each individual witness recalls a different set of circumstances, but Poirot notes two items of significance - the first being that Margaret Ravenscroft was seriously bitten by the otherwise devoted family dog a few days before her death, and that she had four wigs in her possession {{at the time of her}} death. Further investigation by himself and Mrs Oliver soon reveals that her maiden name was Preston-Grey, and that she had an identical twin sister called Dorothea. While Margaret led a fairly ordinary life, her sister spent protracted periods of her life in psychiatric nursing homes, after she was strongly suspected of being involved in two violent incidents: the first occurred in India when, following the death of her husband, Major Jarrow, Dorothea drowned their infant son and blamed it on an Indian ayah; the second occurred in Malaya when she was with the Ravenscrofts, in which she attacked the child of a neighbor of theirs. She soon joined them at their home in Overcliffe, whereupon she apparently sleep-walked off a cliff one evening and died; the deaths of Alistair and Margaret occurred less than a month after this.|$|E

25|$|In his decade-long {{pursuit of}} an elusive title, Mike Thibault {{found himself in}} <b>the</b> <b>proverbial</b> hot seat to {{engineer}} a deep run. But an absence of urgency {{was reflected in the}} team's free agency approach – making small waves to pry Thompson and Cash from their respective teams – to solely ink rugged forward Mistie Mims in relief of Charles. Sticking with the status quo meant the roster was set {{so much so that the}} Sun drafted an unheralded Malian prospect. Going into the season, Thibault had assembled a deep roster that necessitated only a couple minor moves to cap the off-season process. The coach's patience paid dividends when his burgeoning core bolted to a 6–1 start highlighted by a chafed Montgomery turning the starting reins over to Hightower. Leading into the 1-month Olympic hiatus, the Sun strung together a five-win streak to improve to a league-best 15–4 mark. Following the ill-timed Games, which saw the club's Jones-Charles tandem help capture gold for Team USA, Connecticut continued to perform superbly while short-handed. They finished the season 25–9, with a better road record (13–4) than as hosts. The Sun fended off late Liberty rallies to sweep their way into a joust with the Fever in what was the team's first Conference finals since 2010's radical facelift. In the series, the Sun took themselves to the doorstep of a Finals berth after notching a decisive Game 1 rout. But building on a stirring two-point Game 2 win and a rally cry after losing Douglas, Indiana derailed the Sun's seemingly predestined trip in a 71–87 home romp, a defeat that essentially cost longtime coach Thibault his job. The lion's share of the season's fortunes came from the talented triumvirate of Lawson, Jones and league MVP Tina Charles flanked by Mims and sixth woman Montgomery carving a niche as an energy duo off the pines. Though failure was what came to mind in taking stock of the team's decade season; the Fever capturing the year's title being emblematic of that.|$|E

[...] <b>The</b> saying became <b>proverbial</b> and was noticed as connected with the fable by Erasmus in his Adagia. The earliest English version of such a proverb, emerging in the 16th century, echoes the comment on the fable: “Home is home, though it’s never so homely”.
