After Orton broke the hold, he crawled across to the cage door to escape, but <b>Triple</b> H grabbed him back inside. But, on the way back in, Orton managed to grab a steel chair that was on the ring floor. Orton tried to hit <b>Triple</b> H with the chair, but <b>Triple</b> H managed to avoid being hit. <b>Triple</b> H grabbed the chair to hit Orton with it, but Orton hit him in the groin. Orton followed this with a chair shot to <b>Triple</b> H's back and performed a DDT. Throughout the match, Orton tried escaping from the cage, but was not in successful in doing so, as <b>Triple</b> H dragged him back in each time. The match came to an end when Orton tried to execute a running punt on <b>Triple</b> H's head, however, <b>Triple</b> H grabbed the chair and hit Orton with it. <b>Triple</b> H followed up by executing a pedigree. <b>Triple</b> H covered Orton for the pinfall victory, and thus retaining his title.|$|E

In 2003, Orton spent much of his time helping <b>Triple</b> H overcome challenges for the World Heavyweight Championship. Orton joined <b>Triple</b> H in a six-man Elimination Chamber match for the World Heavyweight Championship at SummerSlam, involved primarily to secure <b>Triple</b> H's title defense, and was eliminated by Goldberg, but the stable managed to fulfill its purpose and <b>Triple</b> H went on to eliminate Goldberg and thus retain his title.|$|E

Later that month at Backlash, <b>Triple</b> H was involved in another WWE Championship match, fighting Edge and Cena in a <b>triple</b> threat match, where he lost again. Angered at his loss, a bloodied <b>Triple</b> H used his sledgehammer to attack both Edge and Cena and then performed a number of DX crotch chops. <b>Triple</b> H unsuccessfully attempted to win the WWE title from Cena on numerous occasions, blaming his shortcomings on Vince McMahon, which eventually led to a feud between the McMahons and <b>Triple</b> H.|$|E

He lost the title after 280 days in September 2003 at Unforgiven to Bill Goldberg, in a match with the stipulation that had Goldberg lost, {{he would have to}} retire. After a failed attempt to win back the title from Goldberg in a rematch at the Survivor Series, he finally regained the championship against Goldberg in a <b>triple</b> threat match at Armageddon which also involved Kane. At the 2004 Royal Rumble, <b>Triple</b> H and Shawn Michaels fought in a Last Man Standing match to a double countout, so <b>Triple</b> H retained the title as a result. <b>Triple</b> H dropped the title to Chris Benoit at WrestleMania XX. <b>Triple</b> H was drafted to the SmackDown! brand on March 22 episode of Raw and failed to capture the WWE Championship from Eddie Guerrero. <b>Triple</b> H was drafted back to Raw without competing on SmackDown! and unsuccessfully tried to reclaim the World Heavyweight title from Chris Benoit in subsequent rematches, including a rematch from WrestleMania between <b>Triple</b> H, Benoit, and Shawn Michaels at Backlash, but came out unsuccessful.|$|E

In the weeks preceding the match, <b>Triple</b> H claimed that, several years earlier, Kane had an unrequited relationship with a woman named Katie Vick. He went on to claim that, after Vick {{was killed in a}} car crash, Kane (the driver) raped her corpse. <b>Triple</b> H later threatened to show video footage of Kane committing the act in question; however, the footage that finally aired showed <b>Triple</b> H (dressed as Kane) simulating necrophilia with a mannequin in a casket; Kane's tag team partner The Hurricane responded the following week by showing a video of <b>Triple</b> H (rather, someone wearing a <b>Triple</b> H series of masks) getting an enema. The angle was very unpopular with fans, and was de-emphasized before the title match. <b>Triple</b> H went on to defeat Kane at No Mercy, unifying the two titles.|$|E

Bryan refused to submit to <b>Triple</b> H's submission holds of the crossface chickenwing and a regular crossface, instead reversing to his signature Yes!

After that, Flair bit <b>Triple</b> H's head, bloodying him from his forehead, this often results when a wrestler is trapped, either {{in a corner of}} the ring or in a submission hold, as a desperation move.
