The two-story {{entrance}} loggia consisted of seven arched bays, with a three-bay wing to the northeast and a two-bay wing to the southwest, and acted as a transition point between {{the street and the}} station interior. The first floor (at <b>track</b> <b>level)</b> featured a large waiting room occupying the entire center block, with vault lights providing natural illumination and a fountain set into the western wall. Restrooms, a kitchen, and a cafe occupied the wings.|$|E
5|$|The District {{found an}} {{investor}} {{to finance the}} upgrade in 1901, American Charles Yerkes. On 15 July 1901, Yerkes established the Metropolitan District Electric Traction Company with himself as managing director and raised £1million {{to carry out the}} electrification, including construction of the generating station and supplying the new rolling stock. Yerkes soon had control of the District Railway and his experiences in the United States led him to favour DC with a <b>track</b> <b>level</b> conductor rail similar to that in use on the City & South London Railway and Central London Railway. After arbitration by the Board of Trade, the DC system was adopted.|$|E
5|$|Vestgrensa {{was part}} of Holmenkolbanen's {{operating}} network until 1975, when the municipality of Oslo bought all the company's stock. In the early 1990s, the stations on the Sognsvann Line were upgraded to metro standard, which involved a heightening and lengthening of the platforms, and installation of a third rail power supply and a new signaling system. The electrified third rail {{made it impossible for}} passengers to cross at <b>track</b> <b>level,</b> and under- or overpasses had to be built at all stations.|$|E

40|$|This {{contribution}} {{describes an}} extensively tested approach to threedimensional tracking of a known polyhedral object at {{two levels of}} visual robot control, a position-based <b>tracking</b> <b>level</b> and a velocity-based <b>tracking</b> <b>level.</b> At the higher position-based level, an iterated extended Kalman-Filter is used to track a workpiece at a control-cycle of about two hundred milliseconds. This slower cycle operates {{on top of the}} video-rate tracking-loop of the velocity-based <b>tracking</b> <b>level.</b> While features such as vertices, edges, and ellipses extracted from gray-value images are used to adjust the 3 D pose-estimate at the higher level of control, optical flow is used to initialise the velocity parameters of the upper level and to locally update poses at the lower level...|$|R
5000|$|Many {{secondary}} schools now base <b>track</b> <b>levels</b> on course difficulty, with tracks such as basic, honors, or college-prep. [...] Public schools might track {{in terms of}} high, average, or lower ability. As noted by Oakes and Martin, [...] "school policies determine three structural qualities of the tracking system: extensiveness (the number of subjects tracked {{and the type of}} distinct curricula offered); specificity (the number of <b>track</b> <b>levels</b> offered); and flexibility (whether students move from one track to another)". [...] Although, in theory, track assignment is based on academic ability, other factors often influence placement.|$|R
25|$|For {{many years}} after the wooden station {{building}} was demolished, Wolverton Railway Station was a 'temporary' shed in the car park (at <b>track</b> <b>level).</b> A new brick building to replace it was finally (and formally) opened on 21 June 2012.

40|$|Classroom {{variables}} and student <b>track</b> <b>levels</b> were studied {{to determine the}} impact of tracking. and the resulting differences in student educational experiences. A secondary analysis oC nationwide data collected for "A Study of Schooling " was used {{in an analysis of}} the classroom experiences of students in 297 secondary school English and mathematics classes. The investigation focused on how <b>track</b> <b>levels</b> differed in three major aspects of daily classroom life (curricular content, instructional practice, social relationships and interactions) and in selected student attitudes. Tracked classes were compared with heterogeneous classes on the same dimensions. An uneven racial distribution was found among tracks, particularly in schools where minority students were poor. The data analysis indicated that education in the schools studied was not available to all on an equal basis. Low track students were leas...|$|R

Overnight service is provided by buses and streetcars operating above ground. These overnight routes are issued numbers in the 300 series and are referred to as Blue Night routes, indicated by a typical TTC bus stop sign with a blue band added.|$|E
25|$|Until summer 2018 {{there will}} be major track, {{signalling}} and station remodelling works at London Bridge station {{as part of the}} Masterplan project (some works within the station building started during Key Output 1). A grade-separated junction is being created at Bermondsey. New permanent way (<b>track</b> <b>level,</b> in this case including both plain rail and junctions) and overhead line equipment will be laid out in the new Canal Tunnels just north of St Pancras between the Thameslink route and the East Coast Main Line, thereby opening up the Thameslink network to new destinations north of London. An overhead conductor rail replaced the traditional Mk3b solid wire between the former King's Cross Thameslink station to St Pancras International station.|$|E

25|$|Other {{high-level}} mechanisms may read in {{and process}} larger parts or the complete FAT on startup or on demand when needed and dynamically build up in-memory tree {{representations of the}} volume's file structures different from the on-disk structures. This may, on volumes with many free clusters, occupy even less memory than {{an image of the}} FAT itself. In particular on highly fragmented or filled volumes, seeks become much faster than with linear scans over the actual FAT, even if an image of the FAT would be stored in memory. Also, operating on the logically high level of files and cluster-chains instead of on sector or <b>track</b> <b>level,</b> it becomes possible to avoid some degree of file fragmentation in the first place or to carry out local file defragmentation and reordering of directory entries based on their names or access patterns in the background.|$|E
25|$|The {{lower level}} {{contains}} tracks 22–29, which {{are served by}} low-level platforms at the <b>track</b> <b>level.</b> These platforms are served by all VRE trains, all Amtrak long-distance trains that serve the station except for the Capitol Limited, and some Amtrak Northeast Regional trains that are continuing south to Virginia. Unlike the tracks on the upper level, the lower level tracks run through under the station building and Capitol Hill via the First Street tunnel. Electrification ends at the station, and all trains continuing south through the tunnel must have their electric engines swapped out for diesel locomotives. For example, when a southbound Northeast Regional train arrives on a lower level platform {{on its way to}} Newport News, Virginia, its Siemens ACS-64 engine is removed and set aside. A GE Genesis engine that was earlier removed from a northbound train is coupled {{to the front of the}} southbound, and it continues through the tunnel toward Virginia. The electric engine is now placed on a northbound train, which then departs north towards Baltimore, Philadelphia, New York, and eventually Boston.|$|E
