5|$|Amy is a playable {{character}} in Sonic Advance 1, 2 and 3, platformers for the Game Boy Advance. With Sonic, Tails, Knuckles and (in the latter 2 games) Cream, she frees animals from inside Eggman's robots {{to keep him}} from building an empire. Although in Sonic Advance Amy's attacking power was restricted by her inability to spin while jumping (unlike those of <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>characters),</b> this was changed in the latter two games.|$|E
5|$|At the {{conclusion}} of Brood War, Kerrigan and her Zerg forces became the dominant faction in the Koprulu Sector, having annihilated the United Earth Directorate's Expeditionary Force, defeated the Terran Dominion, and invaded the Protoss homeworld of Aiur. However, after {{the conclusion}} of Brood War, Kerrigan retreats to Char, despite having more than enough power to crush all remaining resistance in the Koprulu Sector. In the four {{years leading up to}} the events of StarCraft II, she has not been seen or heard from by any of <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>characters.</b>|$|E

5|$|Because {{she is a}} whale {{and most}} other {{characters}} are small tide pool organisms, Pearl is depicted as extraordinarily tall and heavy. Her size compared to <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>characters</b> is often used for visual gags; for example, {{she is able to}} shake the entire Krusty Krab when she jumps and can fill the entire building with tears when she cries. The floors of the Krabs' residence are equipped with drain plugs so the house can be emptied after Pearl cries or spouts water from her blowhole.|$|E
5|$|Cartman {{is usually}} {{depicted}} wearing winter attire {{which consists of}} a red coat, brown pants, yellow gloves/mittens, and a yellow-brimmed turquoise knit cap tapered with a yellow pom-pom. He has parted brown hair, and he is seen without his hat more often than <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>characters</b> with distinctive headwear. As he is overweight, his body is wider, his hands noticeably larger and his head is a more elliptical shape {{in contrast to the}} circular heads of the other children. An additional curved line on his lower face represents a double chin.|$|E
5|$|Each {{character}} {{has their own}} unique abilities. Verne has the strength to push and carry large items and can retract into his shell {{in order to avoid}} detection, but cannot jump as high or run as swift as <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>characters.</b> RJ has average strength and agility. He can climb, lift items and also throw Verne. Hammy is the most agile of the three, running swifter and jumping higher. This enables him to circumvent security more easily.|$|E

5|$|Fielding's sixteenth play, The Mock Doctor: or The Dumb Lady Cur'd, {{replaced}} The Covent Garden Tragedy as {{the companion}} play to The Old Debauchees. The play is an Anglicised adaptation of Molière's Le Medecin malgre Lui. It first ran on 23 June 1732 {{and was later}} revised in 1732; both versions were very successful. The plot deals with a young girl pretending to be mute {{to avoid having to}} marry a man she does not like while her doctor is really a man pretending to be a doctor to con <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>characters.</b>|$|E
5|$|I {{was playing}} the nice girl. It's really hard to play. All <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>characters</b> came from {{somebody}} and I said to Mike , 'Where do I come from?' And he said, 'You were the fantasy girl.' I {{found it hard to}} make anything of that. In the end I felt the only thing I could do was to make it as hyper real as I could. I'm not a natural comedienne.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of Guys and Dollss success, Feuer and Martin were interested in adapting John Steinbeck's 1945 novel Cannery Row into a musical. They felt {{that some of the}} characters, such as marine biologist Doc, would work well in a musical, but that many of <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>characters</b> would not. Steinbeck suggested that he write a sequel to Cannery Row that would feature the characters attractive to Feuer and Martin. Based on suggestions for the story line by Feuer and Martin, Steinbeck began to write Sweet Thursday.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1945 film Detour Tom Neal's {{character}} calls another <b>character</b> a four-flusher. (<b>The</b> <b>other</b> <b>character</b> {{is named}} Charlie Haskell Jr., echoing {{the name of}} the Oklahoma governor mentioned above.) ...|$|R

5|$|McCarthy's first group, pornographic parodies, {{includes}} 1976's Tintin en Suisse ("Tintin in Switzerland") and Jan Bucquoy's 1992 work La Vie Sexuelle de Tintin ("Tintin's Sex Life"), featuring Tintin and <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>characters</b> {{engaged in}} sexual acts. Another such example was Tintin in Thailand, in which Tintin, Haddock, and Calculus {{travel to the}} East Asian country for a sex holiday. The book began circulating in December 1999, but in 2001, Belgian police arrested those responsible and confiscated 650 copies for copyright violation.|$|E
5|$|Patricia's {{secret is}} slowly {{revealed}} to <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>characters.</b> Pablo learns her true {{identity in the}} series finale, and they stay together. Andrés and Maria Laura leave the city; Victoria has a son with Tuca; Elías and Dana open a knish shop and Gabriela marries her neighbor, Marito (Alan Sabbagh). The series ends with a party hosted by the school for the 1989 graduates, similar to the graduation party in the first episode.|$|E
5|$|Support: The Support-class {{characters}} provide backup to <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>characters.</b> They {{are equipped}} with a damage dealing weapon, such as a laser cutter, or a shield {{that can be used}} to protect other Hunters. They also have the ability to provide temporary shields for nearby allies. In Stage 2, they gain the ability to charge the shields of their companions hunters.|$|E

50|$|The musical, as {{presented}} on stage, is a two-person show, with no <b>other</b> actors besides <b>the</b> ones playing Jamie and Cathy. Additionally, it consists almost exclusively of solo numbers; Jamie and Cathy alternate songs, {{do not share}} <b>the</b> <b>other's</b> time frame, almost never sing together and frequently are not even present while <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>character</b> unburdens themselves. This gives each character space to present {{their side of the}} story, biases and all. In adapting for film, LaGravanese made the decision to have <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>character</b> present for each monologue, but no music was altered. Additionally, a number of other actors appear in other parts, though Jordan and Kendrick still provide the bulk of the dialogue and all singing.|$|R
25|$|By 1824, when Hazlitt {{reviewed}} {{the history of}} his relationship with Southey, his anger had considerably subsided. As with <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>character</b> sketches in <b>The</b> Spirit of the Age, he did his best to treat his subject impartially.|$|R
5|$|The game's {{story begins}} on {{the outset of}} summer vacation. Hazumu's {{homeroom}} teacher Namiko Tsuki suggests Hazumu and her friends take a one-week trip to a small mountain village with a hot spring resort. Hazumu's grandparents reside in this town, and are two new characters introduced to the story. Three other female characters are introduced as possible love interests for Hazumu; two are {{the same age as}} her, and the third is the older landlady of the resort. The goal of the game is to pair Hazumu up with one of the five female cast of characters. The gameplay's main system comes from Hazumu's indecisive personality. If the player shows more interest in a particular character, <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>characters</b> get annoyed that Hazumu is ignoring them, which is displayed in a tension meter. The more Hazumu ignores a particular character, the higher the tension between that character becomes. This ensures Hazumu stays good friends with the possible love interests. In order to view the ending of a particular character, a certain amount of tension will have to be between <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>characters,</b> but this cannot be too great or the ending will not show.|$|E
5|$|Alex George {{published}} a new taxonomic arrangement of Banksia {{in his classic}} 1981 monograph The genus Banksia L.f. (Proteaceae). Endlicher's Eubanksia became B.subgenus Banksia, and was divided into three sections. George placed Banksia coccinea in its own series—Banksia series Coccineae—within the section B.section Banksia on account of a unique combination of characters, namely the vertical arrangement of flowers on the spike, combined with the branched open habit, broad leaves and very small follicles. Members of the series Quercinae and five species within the series Spicigerae share the vertically aligned flowers, but do not wholly exhibit <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>characters.</b>|$|E
5|$|Amy rescues Sonic from {{imprisonment}} {{and asks}} him {{to marry her}} but yet again Sonic refuses to in Sonic Adventure 2. When she looks for Sonic (to save him again), she finds Shadow the Hedgehog after mistaking him for Sonic. Eggman attacks her with his mecha and Tails defends her; she then spends much of the remaining game searching for Chaos Emeralds with Tails and Knuckles. At the game's climax, Amy pleads with Shadow to help her and <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>characters</b> neutralize a catastrophic energy buildup at the space colony ARK. She reminds him of Maria Robotnik, his friend on the ARK before her death, and he agrees to help.|$|E

50|$|The {{character}} {{was created by}} the show's co-creators and writers John Hugginson and John Banas. A notable storyline for Matt saw him discover the truth about his mother's disappearance. During the second season, Matt took on a supporting role to <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>character's</b> personal problems.|$|R
5000|$|The Mortal is vulnerable, codependent, and has one True Love {{who they}} are chasing after. When they have sex <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>character</b> becomes their darkest self, and their darkest self {{involves}} them thinking everyone wants them gone - and refusing to let that happen.|$|R
5|$|Another Green Wing {{series of}} running jokes is about hair. One {{of the more}} notable was various cracks about Mac's untidy hair, with Sue lending him a hair tie and hair clips before he goes in for an interview. Another was the {{character}} Karen getting her hair trapped in a printer in the first episode. Mac was {{often referred to as}} a Ginger by <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>characters.</b> Guy's hair becomes gradually curlier as the series goes on and Rachel dyes her hair from blonde to brunette after the first series. Other recurring jokes include Boyce's practical jokes, the bizarre games played by the human resources staff and surgery scenes where Caroline, Guy and Mac mess around while performing operations.|$|E
5|$|Aqua's {{character}} has received mixed response from video game publications, with initial comments {{focused on her}} brief appearance in Kingdom Hearts II. Writing for GamesRadar, Chris Antista commented {{that he did not}} understand the importance of Aqua and <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>characters</b> being briefly featured in Kingdom Hearts II; only later was their importance explored at the end of Birth by Sleep. Prior to Aqua's appearance in Birth by Sleeps trailers, 1UP.com's Jeremy Parish stated that fans speculated the character would be male. Having played a demo from Birth by Sleep as Aqua in the E3 2010, Ryan Clements from IGN enjoyed her character due to her gameplay mechanics.|$|E
5|$|As with {{equipped}} items, Garment Grids {{often provide}} characters {{with a variety}} of enhancements and extra abilities. The game features diverse Garment Grids and dresspheres which can be discovered as the game progresses. While normal dresspheres can be used by all three playable characters, each character can acquire a dressphere that only they can use. These dresspheres can only be activated after a character has changed into all of the classes designated to her Garment Grid in a single battle. When a character activates one of these dresspheres, <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>characters</b> are replaced by two controllable support units.|$|E
