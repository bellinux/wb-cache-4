5|$|This work {{maintains}} a heavy {{importance in the}} Art History world, as {{it is widely believed}} to be the first painting, since the fall of Rome (ca. 476 AD), to use Scientific Linear One Point Perspective, or, all the orthogonals point to one vanishing point, in this case, Christ. Also, it is one of the first paintings that does away with the use of a head-cluster. A technique employed by earlier Proto-Renaissance artists, such as Giotto or Duccio. If you were <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> painting, you could walk around Jesus Christ, in the semicircle created, and back out the painting again with ease.|$|E
500|$|Although the 16th century works {{improved}} Gibraltar's defences significantly, {{they still}} had major shortcomings. Fernandez del Portillo noted in 1610 that while Gibraltar was [...] "girt by quite a good wall with bastions at corners", there still remained {{work to be done}} to complete the fortification plans that had been drawn up in the previous century. He felt that [...] "perhaps what does exist is enough to withstand an assault and more." [...] The biggest weakness was the lack of an effective sea wall to resist naval bombardments, and in 1618 Philip III of Spain authorised works to create a new mole for a deep-water harbour, protected by a newly constructed gun platform and the Torre del Tuerto fort. Philip IV subsequently ordered a major modernisation of Gibraltar's fortifications due to hostile activity in the Strait by the Protestant powers of northern Europe – particularly England and the Dutch Republic. On visiting Gibraltar in 1624, the king found that his carriage could not fit through the Landport Gate. He had <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> town instead and expressed his displeasure, to which Gibraltar's military governor is said to have retorted: [...] "Sir, the Gate was not made for the passage of carriages, but for the exclusion of enemies." ...|$|E
2500|$|His {{relationship}} with Charlie was apparently somewhat strained even before their mother's death, as Don is stunned {{to learn that}} his little brother has enough security clearance to work with both the CDC and the NSA ("Vector"). [...] He is even more {{surprised to discover that}} Charlie doesn't seem to know that his clearance will allow him <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> L.A. Office whenever he wishes, rather than obtaining a visitor's pass every time and being restricted in what he can do there. [...] Upon resolving Charlie's status, Don now apparently calls Charlie in on most of his cases.|$|E

50|$|A harpy {{is usually}} chaotic evil and usually solitary, though will {{sometimes}} take flight in small groups. A harpy's song captivates nearby creatures, causing them <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> directly <b>into</b> <b>the</b> harpy's clutches.|$|R

2500|$|At [...] 10 Kite Balloon Section RFC, sent up its balloon, which {{stayed up}} all night. The balloon {{observers}} {{were able to see}} the German bombardment and keep HQ informed as the bombardment intensified at [...] and track the barrage as it crept forward in front of the German infantry. When the German barrage lifted off the British front line at [...] a mine exploded close to Royal Ave and the German attack began. The German left flank (British right flank) advanced on Royal Ave, short of which was Broadmarsh Crater, to the north-west of a new crater which had been captured by the British on the night of 18/19 May and the German right flank (British left) attacked towards Momber Crater. In the smoke and dust the German infantry got half-way across no man's land before the British could see them, moving in skirmish lines, the men [...] apart. Behind the foremost line, the British could see men carrying barbed wire, wood and machine-guns. The Germans were able <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> sector of the 140th Brigade, where the survivors of the bombardment were stunned and their weapons smashed or buried. The 47th Divisional artillery was unable to help as communications had been cut and was short of ammunition. Many men of the 1/7th and 1/8th London were caught in their shelters and captured, except for a few who fought hand to hand.|$|E

50|$|Footnote 5 on page 135 in Richard Neely's How Courts Govern America {{recounts the}} author's brief {{experience}} {{living in the}} Governor's palace.

6000|$|... "This must be {{the work}} of Merwell and Jasniff," [...] he thought. [...] "They simply hired the doctor to get me here. There is nothing in the story of documents, letters, and photographs. What a fool I was <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> trap!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I wondered," [...] he said, [...] "if you'd like <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> {{country with}} me: {{it is such}} a nice day. I thought you might have gone out already. But here you are in bed like a woman who's had a baby.--You're all right, are you?" ...|$|E
50|$|Seven new entrances were completed: Claremont Road, Hancock Museum, St Thomas’ Churchyard, Ridley Place, Shieldfield Green, Crawhall Road, and Ouse Street. At Ouse Street it was {{possible}} <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> straight <b>into</b> <b>the</b> tunnel, but the other access points looked like subway entrances and involved walking down a steep corridor.|$|R

50|$|Barepot is {{a village}} in Cumbria, England. As Workington and Seaton grew, Barepot and also Seaton became districts of Workington. Barepot has about 70 houses and is {{situated}} on the River Derwent. There are no transport links (e.g. Workington Circulars), but Barepot is only a 5- <b>to</b> 10-minute <b>walk</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> centre of Workington.|$|R
60|$|Vaguely {{he thought}} of flight, but Mme. de Pompadour would not let him off quite so easily. With her own jewelled hand she pushed aside the curtain which masked the doorway, and with a nod of her dainty head she hinted to Gaston <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> boudoir.|$|E
60|$|One the whole, he was {{satisfied}} with his evening's work: the young actress had well supported him, and had played her part so far with marvellous sang-froid and skill.

60|$|Harry {{shook hands}} with his visitor, and invited him <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> house; but after Mr. Martin had {{dismounted}} and fastened his horse, {{he thought that the}} seat under the catalpa-tree looked so cool and inviting, that he proposed that they should sit down there and have a little chat.|$|E
5000|$|The {{video for}} [...] "Tribulations" [...] was first aired in August 2005. It was {{directed}} by Dougal Wilson and produced by Colonel Blimp. It features James Murphy walking around through various screens, sometimes walking out of a screen <b>into</b> <b>the</b> real setting, just <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> back <b>into</b> <b>the</b> next screen.|$|R
50|$|Earlier shows {{found the}} band {{performing}} {{on the floor}} with the audience, instead of the stage, giving Ragsdale <b>the</b> ability <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> out <b>into</b> <b>the</b> crowd whilst playing guitar. However, later performances saw the role of guitarist given solely to Miller, whilst Ragsdale takes control of the computer and electronic elements.|$|R
50|$|Żukotyński {{was said}} <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> out <b>into</b> <b>the</b> country <b>to</b> study scenery so his {{paintings}} {{would be in}} harmony with local nature.

60|$|I was {{presently}} so far advanced {{as to be}} able to sit up in a great {{chair and}} even giddily <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> adjoining room, leaning on Charley. The mirror was gone from its usual place in that room too, but what I had to bear was none the harder to bear for that.|$|E
60|$|Kells was {{in better}} shape than at noon of the {{preceding}} day. Still, he had to be lifted off his horse. Joan heard all the men talking at once. They crowded round Pearce, each lending a hand. However, Kells appeared able <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> cabin. It was Bate Wood who led Joan inside.|$|E

50|$|The {{adventure}} layer {{allows the}} player {{to move about}} short distances, whether inside structures (e.g. the Arrakeen palace, or a sietch) or <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> out <b>into</b> <b>the</b> desert.

60|$|It {{was twenty}} minutes to eight {{when we arrived}} at Mellborough, and, as we had not sent word on, there was no {{carriage}} to meet us, nor, as it happened, any spare vehicle.

6000|$|... "I {{could never}} dare <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> back office of my paper and face old McArdle," [...] said I.

Besides, so far as I can see it is not worth discussing, since we can't get down, even if we wanted." ...|$|E
60|$|For {{the next}} few days he alternated between hope and fear. There were moments when he almost {{expected}} Mr. Podgers <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> room, and yet at other times he felt that Fate could not be so unjust to him. Twice he went to the cheiromantist's address in West Moon Street, but he could not bring himself to ring the bell. He longed for certainty, and was afraid of it.|$|E
60|$|Gavin {{arranged}} her pillows as {{she liked}} them, {{and when he}} next stole into the room in his stocking soles to look at her, {{he thought she was}} asleep. But she was not. I dare say she saw at that moment Gavin in his first frock, and Gavin in knickerbockers, and Gavin as he used <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Glasgow room from college, all still as real to her as the Gavin who had a kirk.|$|E
6000|$|... "There's {{your back}} up again; I don't mean to offend you, I tell you; however, if you {{remember}} what I have said to you, it may prevent much trouble <b>to</b> you:"--and Ussher <b>walked</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> house.|$|R
5000|$|In November 1960, Loughnan (not the driver), Heffernan, Barry Stanton, and Ray Hoff were {{rounding}} a bend on a Victorian road, and a tyre blew out.

Loughnan claimed: [...] "I remember having nightmares for years after that. I just hated it." ...|$|R
6000|$|Adam, too angry <b>to</b> speak, <b>walked</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> workshop.
