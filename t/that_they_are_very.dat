5|$|Captain Benjamin Sisko (Avery Brooks) notifies Lieutenant Commander Jadzia Dax (Terry Farrell) that a {{group of}} Trill {{scientists}} will be arriving soon at Deep Space Nine to perform experiments related to wormhole physics. The Trill are a species formed of both a humanoid host and a symbiont, which are implanted into them. The symbionts live far longer than the hosts, and are moved into a new host when the old one dies. Jadzia is the eighth host of the Dax symbiont. Sisko tells Dax that the head scientist is Lenara Kahn (Susanna Thompson), and offers to grant Dax a leave of absence while the Trill scientists are aboard, but she turns it down. Upon Dax and Kahn's first meeting, Major Kira Nerys (Nana Visitor) notices <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> familiar with each other; Dax tells her that Kahn used to be her wife. Dr. Julian Bashir (Alexander Siddig) later informs Kira about the non-association rules that Trill follow regarding the family and friends of former hosts, and says that hosts of the Dax and Kahn symbionts have previously been married to each other.|$|E
25|$|Although a {{large number}} of symbols are known, most {{artifacts}} contain so few symbols <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> unlikely to represent a complete text. Possibly the only exception is the Sitovo inscription in Bulgaria, the dating of which is disputed; regardless, even that inscription has only around 50 symbols. It is unknown which language used the symbols, or indeed whether they stand for a language at all.|$|E
25|$|In split path {{vehicles}} (Toyota, Ford, GM, Chrysler) {{there are}} two electrical machines, one of which functions as a motor primarily, and the other functions as a generator primarily. One of the primary requirements of these machines is <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> efficient, as the electrical portion of the energy must be converted from the engine to the generator, through two inverters, through the motor again {{and then to the}} wheels.|$|E

25|$|Unfortunately, TNOs are so {{far from}} the Sun <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> cold, hence {{producing}} black-body radiation around 60 micrometres in wavelength. This wavelength of light is impossible to observe on the Earth's surface, but only from space using, e.g. the Spitzer Space Telescope. For ground-based observations, astronomers observe the tail of the black-body radiation in the far infrared. This far infrared radiation is so dim that the thermal method is only applicable to the largest KBOs.|$|E
25|$|Buffett faults the {{incentives}} in the United States medical industry, that payers reimburse doctors for procedures (fee-for-service) leading to unnecessary care (overutilization), {{instead of paying}} for results. He cited Atul Gawande's 2009 article in the New Yorker as a useful consideration of US health care, with its documentation of unwarranted variation in Medicare expenditures between McAllen, Texas and El Paso, Texas. Buffett raised the problem of lobbying by the medical industry, saying <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> focused on maintaining their income.|$|E
25|$|In a 2007 survey, 53% of American Muslims {{reported}} {{that it was more}} difficult to be a Muslim after the 9/11 attacks. Asked to name the most important problem facing them, the options named by more than ten percent of American Muslims were discrimination (19%), being viewed as a terrorist (15%), public's ignorance about Islam (13%), and stereotyping (12%). 54% believe that the U.S. government's anti-terrorism activities single out Muslims. 76% of surveyed Muslim Americans stated <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> or somewhat concerned about the rise of Islamic extremism around the world, while 61% express a similar concern about the possibility of Islamic extremism in the United States.|$|E

25|$|One {{advantage}} of squat toilets is <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> easy to clean. They are also cheaper to make, they consume less water per flush than Western toilets, and, {{due to the}} lack of direct contact with the seat, some people claim that they are more hygienic. However, seat contact is not a real health risk and squat toilets allow splatter on one's own legs and feet. The waterless trough minimizes the risk of splash-back of water during defecation. However, because the products of excretion sit exposed to the open air until flushed away, they commonly produce much stronger odors than they would when submerged as in a Western toilet, an effect that is often quite noticeable in or anywhere near a Japanese restroom.|$|E
25|$|DNA vaccination– an alternative, {{experimental}} {{approach to}} vaccination called DNA vaccination, created from an infectious agent's DNA, is under development. The proposed mechanism is the insertion (and expression, {{enhanced by the}} use of electroporation, triggering immune system recognition) of viral or bacterial DNA into human or animal cells. Some cells of the immune system that recognize the proteins expressed will mount an attack against these proteins and cells expressing them. Because these cells live for a very long time, if the pathogen that normally expresses these proteins is encountered at a later time, they will be attacked instantly by the immune system. One potential advantage of DNA vaccines is <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> easy to produce and store. As of 2015, DNA vaccination is still experimental and is not approved for human use.|$|E
25|$|In response, AET {{once again}} criticsed OFSTED, {{saying that the}} Ofsted judgements were unfairly {{negative}} and that many of its schools {{had a history of}} poor performance and would require time to turn round. Ian Comfort the CEO also directly queried the professionalism of OFSTED by claiming that OFSTED had unfairly turned the 'generally positive oral feedback' given at the time of inspections, into 'far more negative statements' in the final OFSTED letter which criticised standards at AET. In comments to the Parliamentary Select Committee Ian Comfort also queried the appropriateness of having both OFSTED and the DfE involved in inspecting school standards as it put 'unnecessary pressure' on AET schools. In contrast to Ian Comfort other CEO's of Multi Academy Trusts, such as Dame Rachel de Souza have publicly stated <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> happy with how the DfE and OFSTED work together to hold schools accountable.|$|E

500|$|Journalists have {{described}} [...] "Two Cars in Every Garage and Three Eyes on Every Fish" [...] as a satire on American politics. Joanne Ostrow, a reviewer for The Denver Post, said only a cartoon {{could get away}} with [...] "such pointed satire" [...] of American political campaigning and advertising that is featured in the episode. She compared it to the [...] "counter-cultural posture" [...] television shows such as Second City Television and Saturday Night Live took in the mid-1970s: [...] "In those days, this sort of alternative viewpoint was kept out of prime time. , it's still relegated to the (distant) fourth network, but at least the time is prime." [...] Jeremy Kleinman of DVD Talk wrote: [...] "The writers of The Simpsons have often come across as unabashedly liberal and this episode is no exception as political/social commentary takes a step closer to the foreground during this episode." [...] Al Jean, current show runner of The Simpsons, has himself admitted in an interview that the show is of a [...] "liberal bent". In the DVD commentaries, creator Matt Groening and the majority of people who work on the show state several times <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> liberal, but some, such as John Swartzwelder (one of the writers of this and many other The Simpsons episodes), are libertarian. The show portrays government and large corporations as callous entities that take advantage of the common worker. Thus, the writers often portray authority figures in an unflattering or negative light. In The Simpsons, politicians are corrupt, ministers such as Reverend Lovejoy are indifferent to churchgoers, and the local police force is incompetent.|$|E
500|$|Fink {{does not}} know how long her {{character}} will be featured on Glee. When asked about what she likes about her character, Fink said: [...] "I think what I love about Lauren is she's so strong and so confident and she knows what she wants and I feel very blessed to play a role model for people who have ever felt other or different. I remember how I used to feel watching TV and seeing Sara Rue on Popular because she was an inspiration to me. It's funny because what I love about Lauren is that she's unapologetic and she's confident and she's making Puck work for it and she's not just looking for a roll in the hay. I think <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> sweet together, there is this vulnerability when they are both such bad asses and you put them together and I think there is something really special there. What I appreciate about Lauren is that she's like I don't need to give it to you, you're going to work for it, and I think that's a great message to send to young girls. I think that he is smitten and she is probably a little smitten too but I think she has enough self esteem not to give everything up for the charming cute boy that's kind of after her." [...] Kevin Fallon, a writer for The Atlantic, reacted favorably to the casting of Fink: [...] "Glee hit the trifecta this year with its three major cast additions. First there were Darren Criss—who's exploded with popularity—and Chord Overstreet. Now there's Ashley Fink's Lauren. And while the tough-only-on-the-outside Lauren can deliciously out-sass Santana Lopez, it's her straight-talking that really has me sold." ...|$|E

In the DVD commentaries, creator Matt Groening and the majority of people who work on the show state several times <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> liberal, but some, such as John Swartzwelder (the writer of this and many other The Simpsons episodes), are conservative. In his book The Really Inconvenient Truths: Seven Environmental Catastrophes Liberals Don't Want You to Know About- Because They Helped Cause Them, Iain Murray described [...] "The Frying Game" [...] as [...] "subversively conservative", and wrote that it shows [...] "The best popular explanation of the liberal environmentalist model for endangered species." [...] In the episode, Homer buys a koi pond for Marge, only to find a screamapillar has taken residence in their garden. When Homer tries to squash it, an EPA official tells him that allowing an endangered species to die is a federal offense, under the [...] "Reversal of Freedoms Act of 1994." [...] Homer is forced to coddle the screamapillar, and when he accidentally squashes it, Homer is found guilty of [...] "attempted insecticide and aggravated buggery." [...] The [...] "Reversal of Freedoms Act" [...] is a reference to the Endangered Species Act, an environmental law that Murray opined had [...] "indeed become the Reversal of Freedoms Act." [...] He continued, [...] "Landowners who happened to have threatened or endangered species on their lands or who simply have habitat that might be used by endangered species are routinely prevented from using their lands or property. They are stopped from undertaking such activities as harvesting their trees, grazing their cattle, irrigating their fields, clearing brush along fence lines, disking firebreaks around their homes and barns, or building new homes.|$|E

The limited size and offering of L'OCCITANE's stores {{is too small to}} be considered a specialty store. However, a concept store goes beyond merely selling products, and instead offers an immersive customer experience built around the way that a brand fits with the customer's lifestyle.

[...] In addition, children also experience cognitive symptoms like fear of dying, feelings of being detached from oneself, feelings of losing control or going crazy, but {{they are unable to}} vocalize these higher order manifestations of fear. [...] They simply know that something is going wrong and <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> afraid. Children can only describe the physical symptoms. They have not yet developed the constructs to put these symptoms together and label them as fear. Parents often feel helpless when they watch a child suffer. [...] They can help children give a name to their experience, and empower them to overcome the fear they are experiencing ...|$|E
2500|$|Other {{accounts}} place a {{group of}} [...] "Arabs" [...] driven to Ajaj as being identified with the Mechagra mentioned by Erwin von Bary, among whom a few Jews are said still to dwell there. Victor J. Horowitz also speaks of many free tribes in the desert regions who are Jews by origin, but who have gradually thrown off Jewish customs and have apparently accepted Islam. Among these tribes, he says, are the Daggatun, numbering several thousands and scattered over several oases in the Sahara, even {{as far as the}} River Dialiva (Djoliba?) or Niger. He says, also, <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> warlike and in constant conflict with the Tuareg. According to Horowitz, the Mechagra mentioned above are also to be reckoned as one of these Jewish tribes. Horowitz had never been to Africa, but relied mainly on rumours spread in the European Jewish community.|$|E
2500|$|Accounts on {{the quality}} of the black bear's fur vary. According to Natural History of the Mammalia of India and Ceylon, [...] "Their skins are always poor and mangy, and {{generally}} so greasy <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> difficult to keep until you can make them over to the dresser", which is corroborated by The great and small game of India, Burma, and Tibet, which states [...] "... the skins are never of any particular value, and in autumn, owing to the masses of yellow fat that are accumulated beneath them, are absolutely useless." [...] The first part of volume II of Mammals of the Soviet Union on the other hand states that Asian black bears yield fur, meat and fat of greater quality than those of brown bears. In British India, grease was the only practical use for black bear carcasses. Bears living near villages were considered the most ideal, as they were almost invariably fatter than their forest dwelling counterparts.|$|E
