5|$|The family disapproves of {{his first}} few inventions, {{including}} a make-up shotgun, electric hammer, alarm that never stops beeping, and reclining chair with a built-in toilet, making Homer more depressed. However, they like one particular invention, a chair with two hinged legs on the back, {{making it impossible to}} <b>tip</b> <b>over</b> backwards. Homer is encouraged until he notices his poster of Edison shows him sitting in the same type of chair. Bart points out that the chair is not featured on a list of Edison's inventions, meaning he never told anyone of this invention.|$|E
5|$|With unarticulated wheels, {{climbing}} obstacles {{will cause}} {{the body of a}} vehicle to tilt. If the vehicle's center of mass moves outside of the wheelbase or axle track, the vehicle will become statically unstable, and will tend to <b>tip</b> <b>over.</b> At speed, a vehicle can become dynamically unstable, meaning that it can be tipped over by an obstacle smaller than its static stability limit, or by excessive acceleration or tight turning. Without articulation, this can be an impossible position from which to recover.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{began in}} early 1847, but {{relationships}} between the LB and SER broke down quickly. The SER were unhappy about the proposed line from Rye to Hastings via , which they viewed as too expensive compared to the alternative route via Whatlington. The LB objected to this route as it was longer, and consequently the SER dropped their proposals in November 1847. The land over Romney Marsh was unstable, and test trains were seen to <b>tip</b> <b>over</b> in heavy winds. The line was originally proposed to be single-track, though this was changed to double-track in June 1850.|$|E

5|$|Water clocks, or clepsydrae, were {{commonly}} used in Ancient Greece following their introduction by Plato, who also invented a water-based alarm clock. One account of Plato's alarm clock describes it as depending on the nightly overflow of a vessel containing lead balls, which floated in a columnar vat. The vat held a steadily increasing amount of water, supplied by a cistern. By morning, the vessel would have floated high enough to <b>tip</b> <b>over,</b> causing the lead balls to cascade onto a copper platter. The resultant clangor would then awaken Plato's students at the Academy. Another possibility is that it comprised two jars, connected by a siphon. Water emptied until it reached the siphon, which transported the water to the other jar. There, the rising water would force air through a whistle, sounding an alarm. The Greeks and Chaldeans regularly maintained timekeeping records as {{an essential part of}} their astronomical observations.|$|E
25|$|After further ocean landing tests, {{the first}} stage of the CRS-5 launch vehicle {{attempted}} to land on a floating platform, the autonomous spaceport drone ship, in January 2015. The rocket guided itself to the ship successfully but landed too hard for survival. The first stage of the CRS-6 mission managed a soft landing on the platform; however, excess lateral velocity caused it to quickly <b>tip</b> <b>over</b> and explode. SpaceX CEO Elon Musk indicated that a throttle valve for the engine was stuck and did not respond quickly enough to achieve a smooth landing.|$|E

And in the take, he leaned back and hit the rented dental {{machinery}} {{with the back of his}} leg and it started to <b>tip</b> <b>over.</b> Roger didn't even call cut.

500|$|Although {{he agrees}} {{that it would}} take a force of about 3,000 newtons to push over a {{standing}} cow, biologist Steven Vogel thinks that the study by Lillie and Boechler overestimates the pushing ability of an individual human. Using data from Cotterell and Kamminga, who estimated that humans exert a pushing force of 280 newtons, Vogel suggests that someone applying force at the requisite height to topple a cow might generate a maximum push of no more than 300 newtons. By this calculation, at least 10 people would be needed to <b>tip</b> <b>over</b> a non-reacting cow. However, this combined force requirement, he says, might not be the greatest impediment to such a prank. Standing cows are not asleep and like other animals have ever-vigilant reflexes. [...] "If the cow does no more than modestly widen its stance without an overall shift of its center of gravity", he says, [...] "about 4,000 newtons or 14 pushers would be needed—quite a challenge to deploy without angering the cow." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} European {{version of}} the music video for [...] "Trouble" [...] was directed by British director Sophie Muller. The video footage was shot in a Newhall, California ranch. A Wild West-themed video, it features Martin as a prisoner in a dark warehouse, tied with ropes to a chair, being circled by cars in the freezing cold. The {{other members of the}} band are seen on the upper floor in a slow motion sequence where Buckland and Champion struggle with bass guitarist Guy Berryman, tying him to another chair and forcing him to look in front. At this point, Martin's struggling causes his chair to <b>tip</b> <b>over,</b> and he hits the ground on his side. He sings the final line of the song ("They spun a web for me..."), before the darkness abruptly turns to daylight. [...] A beautiful sunrise is then revealed, but as the camera pans out, it is revealed to be fake and part of a large theater backdrop, with Martin still lying on his side, tied to the chair.|$|E

She singled out writer Phil Ford for considerable praise feeling that he wrote the episode true to the characters [...] "while filling in backstory we {{had no way of}} imagining" [...] and delivered [...] "drama, action, and laughs". Brad Trechak of AOL TV felt the more comic episode was a welcome respite from darker episodes. He praised the episode for being [...] "light and fluffy yet it furthered things along with regard to the Torchwood universe and its characters". Reviewing the episode Brigid Cherry of Total Sci-Fi felt that [...] "contrary to expectation– it’s hilarious". She praised the comedy provided from Eve Myles, Gareth David-Lloyd and Nerys Hughes in particular as well as the [...] "terrifying moments that threaten to <b>tip</b> <b>over</b> into gross-out horror-comedy." [...] She felt overall the [...] "offbeat self-parody" [...] made a welcome change from the show's more serious episodes and rated it eight out of ten.

2500|$|Most thermal {{stations}} use coal as {{the main}} fuel. Raw coal is transported from coal mines to a power station site by trucks, barges, bulk cargo ships or railway cars. Generally, when shipped by railways, the coal cars are sent as a full train of cars. The coal received at site may be of different sizes. The railway cars are unloaded at site by rotary dumpers or side tilt dumpers to <b>tip</b> <b>over</b> onto conveyor belts below. The coal is generally conveyed to crushers which crush the coal to about [...] size. The crushed coal is then sent by belt conveyors to a storage pile. Normally, the crushed coal is compacted by bulldozers, as compacting of highly volatile coal avoids spontaneous ignition.|$|E

2500|$|A high {{center of}} gravity makes a vehicle more prone to {{rollover}} accidents than lower vehicles, especially if the vehicle leaves the road, or if the driver makes a sharp directional adjustment during emergency maneuvers. Figures from the [...] show that most passenger cars have about a 10% chance of rollover if involved in a single-vehicle crash, while SUVs have between 14% and 23% (varying {{from a low of}} 14% for the all-wheel-drive (AWD) Ford Edge to a high of 23% for the front-wheel-drive (FWD) Ford Escape). Many modern SUVs are equipped with electronic stability control (ESC) to prevent rollovers on flat surfaces, but 95% of rollovers are [...] "tripped", meaning that the vehicle strikes something low, such as a curb or shallow ditch, causing it to <b>tip</b> <b>over.</b>|$|E
