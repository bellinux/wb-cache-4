On October 27, 2008, he officially announced his candidacy for Governor of Alabama in an interview with CNN, stating that he planned to run in the 2014 election cycle, but he began <b>to</b> <b>back</b> <b>off</b> the idea in a November 24, 2009 interview on The Jay Leno Show. In 2010, he confirmed that he was not running in 2014. In 2016, Barkley once more turned Republican, when he endorsed John Kasich for the office of President in the 2016 election.|$|E
5|$|Low {{challenged}} the Prime Minister over the Suez issue, {{accusing him of}} sending a threatening telegram that caused British Prime Minister Anthony Eden <b>to</b> <b>back</b> <b>off</b> the invasion and so gave the Soviets {{the opportunity for a}} military buildup in Egypt. St. Laurent angrily denied the charge and offered to open his correspondence to any of the fifty privy councillors who could then announce whether St. Laurent was telling the truth. Low took St. Laurent up on his challenge, and selected the only living former Prime Minister, Tory Arthur Meighen, but the matter was not resolved before the election, and Meighen was not called upon to examine the correspondence in the election's aftermath.|$|E

25|$|Following {{the church}} shooting, many {{commentators}} questioned the continued {{display of the}} flag at the memorial on the State House grounds. The flag had first been erected in 1962 by the state's Democratic governor in a protest against desegregation. Opposition and attempts to remove the flag began almost immediately. In 1996, then-governor David Beasley pushed to have it removed from the Capitol dome, only <b>to</b> <b>back</b> <b>off</b> and then be driven from office two years later in the political blowback.|$|E
25|$|In July, Strauss {{told the}} FBI that he {{believed}} eight of the Institute’s thirteen trustees were ready to dismiss Oppenheimer – but he decided to postpone {{a vote on the}} matter until Autumn so that it would not appear that Strauss as chairman was acting out of personal vindictiveness. This proved to be a miscalculation, because the delay gave members of the faculty time to organize an open letter in support of Oppenheimer… Strauss was forced <b>to</b> <b>back</b> <b>off,</b> and later that Autumn the trustees voted to keep Oppie as director.|$|E

25|$|Provenzano {{proposed}} a new, less violent Mafia strategy {{instead of the}} terrorist bombing campaign in 1993 against the state to get them <b>to</b> <b>back</b> <b>off</b> in their crackdown against the Mafia after the murders of prosecutors Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino. Following the months after Riina's arrest, there were a series of bombings by the Corleonesi against several tourist spots on the Italian mainland: the Via dei Georgofili in Florence, Via Palestro in Milan and the Piazza San Giovanni in Laterano and Via San Teodoro in Rome, which left 10 people dead and 93 injured, as well as severe damage to centres of cultural heritage such as the Uffizi Gallery.|$|E

Howard stated that although his preference was to remain in Orlando, he did not feel the Magic organization was doing enough to build a championship contender. He would later meet with Magic officials and agree <b>to</b> <b>back</b> <b>off</b> his trade demands, but stated that he also felt the team needed to make changes to the roster if they wanted to contend for a championship.|$|E
25|$|In 1951, the {{organization}} acquired its current name when Henry Kaiser unilaterally directed the {{trustees of the}} health plans, hospital foundations, and medical groups to add his name before Permanente. However, the physicians in the Permanente Medical Group deeply resented the implication that they were directly controlled by Kaiser, and successfully forced him <b>to</b> <b>back</b> <b>off</b> {{with respect to their}} part of {{the organization}}. That same year, Kaiser Permanente also began experiments with large-scale multiphasic screening to identify unknown conditions and to facilitate treatment of known ones. Simultaneously, although no one questioned his medical competence, Garfield's deficiencies as an executive were becoming apparent as the organization expanded far beyond his ability to manage it properly.|$|E
50|$|Manual <b>back</b> <b>offs</b> are {{the least}} {{preferred}} technique for removing free pipe from the hole since {{there is very little}} control. When performing a manual <b>back</b> <b>off</b> you take the desired <b>back</b> <b>off</b> depth(ft.) and multiply it by the weight of one foot of pipe. This will give you a rough estimate of the neutral weight of the pipe at the desired depth. By setting the pipe at neutral weight at the desired depth you are reducing any tension on the threads at the desired depth, thereby increasing your odds of the pipe unscrewing there. The driller will pickup the string <b>to</b> the <b>back</b> <b>off</b> neutral weight, and then left hand torque is applied until the pipe unscrews. There is no guarantee that the pipe will unscrew at the desired point making the manual <b>back</b> <b>off</b> the last resort for <b>backing</b> <b>off</b> pipe.|$|R

25|$|In qualifying, McLaren took 1–2 {{ahead of}} the Williamses and the Benettons with Senna ahead of Berger, Mansell, Patrese, Piquet and Schumacher. At the start, in {{extremely}} torrential wet conditions, Patrese lost time and was quickly behind Piquet and Alesi had also got by him and Schumacher. Senna led from Berger, Mansell, Piquet, Alesi and Patrese. On lap 3, Berger went wide allowing Mansell to be second and thus go after Senna. He was close enough on lap 5 and was {{side by side with}} Senna on the next lap but saw yellow flags because of Nicola Larini's crash. Thus he was forced <b>to</b> <b>back</b> <b>off</b> and Senna retained the lead. Alesi spun off immediately and was followed there by Schumacher. Both were out.|$|E

In fact, during the months after Riina's arrest, there {{was a series of}} bombings by the Corleonesi against several tourist spots on the Italian mainland, resulting in the deaths of ten people, including an entire family. Brusca also quoted Riina as declaring that the children of informants were legitimate targets. Brusca subsequently tortured and killed Giuseppe Di Matteo, the 11-year-old son of Santo Di Matteo, an informant in a failed attempt to silence the boy's father, who had been giving testimony against Riina.|$|E
25|$|In 1991, United States Attorney General Dick Thornburgh {{resigned}} {{to run for}} a Senate seat in Pennsylvania, one made vacant by John Heinz's death in a helicopter crash. Rove's company worked for the campaign, but it ended with an upset loss to Democrat Harris Wofford. Rove subsequently sued Thornburgh alleging non-payment for services rendered. The Republican National Committee, worried that the suit would {{make it hard to}} recruit good candidates, urged Rove <b>to</b> <b>back</b> <b>off.</b> When Rove refused, the RNC hired Kenneth Starr to write an amicus brief on Thornburgh's behalf. After a trial in Austin, Rove prevailed. Karl Rove & Co. v. Thornburgh was heard by U.S. Federal Judge Sam Sparks (who had been appointed by George H.W. Bush in 1991).|$|E

However, Marissa manages to get Jack and Erica to come to Bianca's aid, where Jack forces them <b>to</b> <b>back</b> <b>off</b> and leave. Bianca thanks Marissa and apologizes for doubting her. Bianca is subjected to even further turmoil when she discovers that Reese is indeed trying to obtain full custody of both Miranda and Gabby.|$|E
25|$|Silas {{returns to}} Hollyoaks in January 2016 as he visits Trevor Royle (Greg Wood) in prison {{under the name}} Mr. E Mann (Mystery Man). It is {{revealed}} that Silas had been writing to Trevor as he heard about the Gloved Hand Killer who had murdered seven residents throughout 2015. As Silas asks Trevor disturbing questions, Trevor tells Silas <b>to</b> <b>back</b> <b>off</b> and never contact him again. Silas leaves but has a feeling that Trevor is innocent and is determined {{to find out who}} the real killer is. Silas returns to Hollyoaks again in February, this time for an appointment with Tegan Lomax (Jessica Ellis), a nurse at Dee Valley Hospital. During the appointment, Silas tells Tegan he believes that the killer is one of the nurses or doctors who work at the hospital as medical equipment mysteriously disappeared {{during the time of the}} murders. Silas's interrogation about the murders makes Tegan uncomfortable and she leaves briefly, and once she returns Silas has already left. Silas visits Dee Valley Hospital again a few weeks later, this time imitating a human resources officer while visiting Lindsey Roscoe (Sophie Austin) in her office. After she confides in him about her feelings on her sister Kim Butterfield's (Daisy Wood-Davis) arrest for the murders, he leaves with the chilling parting words that he is a keen admirer of her good work and to keep it up, implying that he knows she is the real killer.|$|E
