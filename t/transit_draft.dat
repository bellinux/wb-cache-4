25|$|There {{are plans}} to build an {{additional}} line to the southeast from the city centre. Calgary <b>Transit</b> has <b>drafted</b> {{a plan for a}} transit-only right-of-way, known as the SETWAY (South East Transit Way) for the interim. A second, northern line is to be planned beyond 2023 but the alignment is still pending.|$|R
50|$|Throughout 2009 CMTA {{intends to}} work on {{expanding}} the use of car-sharing in Greater Baltimore; conduct a marketing analysis of current and potential <b>transit</b> riders; <b>draft</b> a report detailing the current and potential economic impact of mass transit on the regionâ€™s economy, and work with MTA to advance a number of system enhancements.|$|R
500|$|In 2015, Kitsap <b>Transit</b> <b>drafted</b> a {{business}} plan for a [...] "fast ferry" [...] system serving Bremerton, Kingston, and Southworth from Seattle, funded by a local sales tax and fares. The Kitsap Transit board voted in April 2016 to place a 0.3 percent sales tax on the November 2016 ballot that would fund a three-route passenger-only ferry system to begin operation in 2017. The ballot measure, the third overall on passenger-only ferries in Kitsap County, was approved by 51.7 percent of voters on November 8, 2016, with the collection of sales taxes to begin the following April. In June 2017, Kitsap Transit finalized its operating plans, including a revision to initially operate the system itself as it continues to negotiate an operating contract with the King County Department of Transportation, and announced that service will begin on July 10, 2017.|$|R
5000|$|A Panamax {{cargo ship}} would {{typically}} have a DWT of 65,000-80,000 tonnes, but its maximum cargo {{would be about}} 52,500 tonnes during a <b>transit</b> due to <b>draft</b> limitations in the canal. New Panamax ships can carry 120,000 DWT. Panamax container ships can carry with [...] for New Panamax vessels.|$|R
50|$|The {{line would}} be 22 miles or 35 {{kilometers}} long from Canton to Elizabeth, where riders could transfer to Cobb Community <b>Transit</b> buses. The <b>draft</b> study estimates about 300 people per day would initially ride {{if it were}} already in place (600 if it went to Atlanta), and about 1700 would ride in 20 years.|$|R
500|$|On 13 December 1988, Texas {{was pulled}} from her berth with great {{difficulty}} {{over the course of}} six hours by six large tugboats to begin the [...] trip from her berth to Todd Shipyards in Galveston, Texas. Once under tow in the Houston Ship Channel she started taking on water, with a serious breach just forward of the engine rooms. The crew had three [...] pumps and two [...] pumps in continuous service to combat the flooding. During the nine-plus hour <b>transit,</b> the ship's <b>draft</b> increased [...] in the stern.|$|R
2500|$|The canal allows {{passage of}} ships up to [...] draft or 240,000 {{deadweight}} tons {{and up to}} a height of [...] above water level and a maximum beam of [...] under certain conditions. The canal can handle more traffic and larger ships than the Panama Canal, as Suezmax dimensions are greater than both Panamax and New Panamax. Some supertankers are too large to traverse the canal. Others can offload part of their cargo onto a canal-owned boat to reduce their <b>draft,</b> <b>transit,</b> and reload {{at the other end}} of the canal.|$|R
5000|$|On 13 December 1988, Texas {{was pulled}} from her berth with great {{difficulty}} {{over the course of}} six hours by six large tugboats to begin the [...] trip from her berth to Todd Shipyards in Galveston, Texas. Once under tow in the Houston Ship Channel she started taking on water, with a serious breach just forward of the engine rooms.

5000|$|After a {{stopover}} for {{the dedication}} of the Montgomery Point Lock and Dam on 16 July, her transit was delayed by the United States Army Corps of Engineers over safety concerns. At the time of <b>transit,</b> she was <b>drafting</b> 11.5 ft at her bow and at nearly 15 ft at her stern, while some portions of the Arkansas River were less than 9 ft deep. A pair of barges were used as pontoons to lift the submarine a few feet to clear the river bottom while remaining low enough to pass under the bridges along her route, just as [...] had 32 years earlier.|$|R
