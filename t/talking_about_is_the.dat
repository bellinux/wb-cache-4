Coincidence I just {{happened}} to be in the Kildare street museum 890 today, shortly prior to our meeting if I can so call it, and I was just looking at those antique statues there. The splendid proportions of hips, bosom. You simply don't knock against those kind of women here. An exception here and there. Handsome yes, pretty in a way you find but what I'm <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> female form. Besides they have so little taste in dress, most of them, which greatly enhances a woman's natural beauty, no matter what you say. Rumpled stockings, it may be, possibly is, a foible of mine but still it's a thing I simply hate to see.|$|E

5000|$|Awake was {{released}} on October 4, 1994 through East West Records. LaBrie considered the album's title to be [...] "the perfect word to describe the album's lyrics. What we're basically <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> awareness of your existence - becoming closer and {{more in touch with}} yourself and ultimately discovering what works best for you as an individual as you try to get through life." [...] Portnoy dedicated the album to his biggest inspiration, Frank Zappa, who died in 1993.|$|E
5000|$|According to McGuinn, the song's lyrics were {{an attempt}} to explain Einstein's theory of {{relativity}} and were directly inspired by the book 1-2-3-4, More, More, More, More by Don Landis. [...] In a 1966 interview with Hit Parader magazine the guitarist stated [...] "It's sort of weird but...what I'm <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> whole universe, the fifth dimension, which is height, width, depth, time and something else. But there definitely are more dimensions than five. It's infinite. The fifth dimension is the threshold of scientific knowledge." [...] Talking to Michael Ross of Creem magazine in 1970, McGuinn further explained the song's meaning: [...] "'5D' was an ethereal trip into metaphysics, into an almost Moslem submission to an Allah, an almighty spirit, free-floating, the fifth dimension being the 'mesh' which Einstein theorized about. He proved theoretically - but I choose to believe it." ...|$|E

5000|$|When {{confronted with}} these criticisms, Gillibrand responded, [...] "What {{the mayor and}} the {{governor}} are <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> Medicare reimbursement rates... I've been fighting on this issue for over six months. What it is, Erroll, is when it comes to funding formulas in the Senate, there are more small states than big states, and so the funding formulas tend to help small states. And that's something Senator Schumer and I have to push back on every single time, because {{the fact of the matter}} is, for every dollar New York sends to Washington, we only get 79 cents back, and that's largely due to these formulas. We win on the formula debate on the House. So what I've been trying to do is fight for the House version of the bill when we are in conference... If we are successful we can close the $1 billion gap." ...|$|E

And if they're making a phone call in the United States, it seems like to me we want to know why.This is a - I repeat to you, even though you hear words, [...] "domestic spying," [...] these are not phone calls within the United States. It's a phone call of an al Qaeda, known al Qaeda suspect, making a phone call into the United States ... I told you it's a different kind of war with a different kind of enemy. If they're making phone calls into the United States, we need to know why - to protect you.|$|E
5000|$|The {{publishers}} were {{troubled by}} the novel's villain, a retired history professor crazed by racism, who plans to atone {{for a lifetime of}} [...] "hypocritical" [...] liberalism by blowing up the Brooklyn apartment building he owns, taking his own life and the lives of his black tenants. His opposite numbers are a white private detective, who has two days to stop him, and the detective's black girlfriend, who lives in the building. It is a terrific psychological suspense story, and well-written, as Ellin's books characteristically are.... At the bottom of the controversy is that Ellin has supplied his bigot with reasons for his actions, reasons that some critics apparently have found compelling enough to be called [...] "justifications." [...] That's not what they are, says Ellin. [...] "One of the things everyone avoids <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> feeling of whites watching a world ending.... It's not justification, but there is a reason for every act, including the maddest." [...] Ellin, 67, is in a rare position to make such distinctions. He has lived in the same Brooklyn block for 42 years, refusing to join the whites who fled as the neighborhood became 95 percent black.|$|E

5000|$|Nathan Cirillo was my boyfriend. I {{loved him}} deeply, as {{did all of}} the family and friends who knew him and we all still mourn him every day. That being said, I feel I should weigh in on this ridiculous [...] "was he a hero or was he not" [...] debate. My {{response}} is:"we should be <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> dismal state of mental healthcare in our country. What that deeply disturbed man killing my boyfriend should make Canadians focus on is how we can prevent another event like this through more accessible and effective mental health treatment programs that target the real source of this tragedy. Stop tearing apart the honour and love bestowed upon a wonderful man who deserves every bit of it and start taking a good hard look at the awful, dysfunctional systems in our nation that this has shown us need to change....I am a very proud Canadian, but the fact that this hero/not business is what the media here and the general public has chosen to talk about, I must say I am very disappointed. We can do, and are, better than this, Canada.....I feel as though this is an important discussion that needs to continue happening. Andrea Polko ...|$|E
40|$|One of the {{canons of}} writing {{that is often}} {{repeated}} {{is that if you}} write, you should write about something you know about. I will apply that belief to my comments today. I will talk about something that I know (at least a little) about. For the past twenty plus years I have been studying the linkage between science and public policy making. The science I am talking about is science as defined by the scientific method, which posits that we should follow such tenets as causation, empiricism, objectivity, and replication. The public policy I am <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> policies that are determined through our democratic process, highlighted by its construction by our governing bodies, implementation by our executives, and interpretation by our courts...|$|E

Sometimes bad emotions can be misleading because of the reaction often causing conflict. To conclude based on Straker's theory, you can use emotions for good or bad.

40|$|The {{poems in}} this {{collection}} are in search of. They are digging through the debris of memory, of memory blurred by trauma or degraded by time or worn thin from retrieval, from repeated examination—an ongoing attempt to apprehend. They are poems of internalized violence, addiction, domestic upheaval, sexual abuse, assault, abandonment, separation. They are also poems of adoption, of the overlap between stories, of roots and more roots, of tangled histories, of the point of rupture being the point of origination. As such, they are unsure of how to proceed, how to present themselves: they are self-conscious poems, anxious to communicate yet at times unable to break free of their own spiraling repetitions: the ritualized performance of pain as both an attempt to speak back to suffering as well as unintended proliferation of such. Compulsion. Depression. Suicidal ideation. Of course what we are <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> longevity of grief, its many mutations. How we learn to recognize {{it for what it}} is. What we can do with it...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{synthetically}} analyzed essential {{features of}} various support methods in engineering geological soft rock, proposed a scheme that organically combines active support(like anchor bolt support) with passive support (like U-shaped steel bracket support), analyzed fundamentals of this combined support scheme, and forecasted support {{effect of this}} support scheme. It provides roadway support design with fresh ideas. U-shaped steel bracket can be translated into special anchor plate {{with the help of}} a section of simple steel channel beam, so effect of anchor bolt can be ensured; U-shaped steel bracket, this extremely long curved beam,will be divided into several sections of short beams, so its bearing ability will be several times improved. Cost of this combined support scheme is low, its process is simple and its application prospect is wide. 1 Engineering geological features of soft rock At present, soft rock that scholars are <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> “engineering soft rock”, that is, the engineering rock which will have a significant plastic deformation under the actions of engineering forces. Engineering soft rock is divided into four categories: expansive soft rock (or low-pressure soft rock), high-stress soft rock, fractured soft rock and composite soft rock...|$|E
