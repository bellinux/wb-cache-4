40|$|OFDMA is {{the access}} scheme {{used in the}} third and fourth {{generation}} wireless cellular networks. Proper allocation of bandwidth and power is essential for ensuring the optimal performance and utilization of the resources in the OFDMA based cellular networks. The resource allocation in uplink direction and downlink directional will need different approaches. In uplink direction, different categories of algorithms like static, dynamic, centralized, distributed, instantaneous, stochastic, single cell, multi-cell, optimal, suboptimal algorithms are followed. In case of downlink direction, margin adaptive and rate adaptive algorithms are followed. In this paper, resource allocation and scheduling schemes in both uplink and downlink of OFDMA are considered.

This article seeks to bring a consensus in sorting out these practical problems so that a systematic way of approach could be arrived at in managing such fragile patients. The last decade has seen an evolution and ongoing refinement of a disease-oriented approach to CKD. Since the average GFR tends to decrease with age, CKD becomes increasingly prevalent with advancing age, and thus, disproportionately elderly patients meet the criteria for CKD...|$|R

40|$|Since {{the lack}} of {{explicit}} modeling of the system dynamics of an UAV limits {{the efficiency of the}} control system, a method for time domain parameter identification of a miniature rotorcraft based UAV is presented. A linear state space model improvised by nonlinear extensions is proposed. Exclusive attention is given to the execution of special flight test maneuvers to expose the subtleties of the complex dynamics inherent to rotorcrafts. State of the art instrumentation, avionics and sensor fusion packages are implemented to increase data reliability. After checking for Kinematic Consistency the recorded data is analyzed to estimate model parameters with a Maximum Likelihood Output Error estimation method through a time-domain matching algorithm.

The scheme is proposed to model the tempo-spatial behavior and data quality rating to select participants for participatory sensing campaign. Based on this, the recruitment is formulated as a linear programming problem by considering tempo-spatial coverage, data quality, and budget. The scheme enables one to check and adjust the recruitment strategy adaptively according to application scenarios. The evaluations show that our scheme provides efficient sensing performance as stability, low-cost, tempo-spatial correlation and self-adaptiveness...|$|R

Over 60 years of British colonial rule, education in the Northern Region had lagged far behind that of the two southern regions.

Only two Nigerians — Dr. Iya Abubakar (Mathematics) and Adamu Baikie (Education) — were among the earliest round of faculty appointments.
