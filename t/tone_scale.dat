5|$|The ninth nocturne, {{dedicated}} to Cortot's wife, Clotilde Bréal, {{is the first}} of three that share a directness and sparseness in contrast with the more elaborate structures and textures of their predecessors. The left-hand accompaniment to the melodic line is simple and generally unvaried, and the harmony looks forward to later composers of the 20th century, using a whole <b>tone</b> <b>scale.</b> Most of the piece is inward-looking and pensive, presaging the style of Fauré's final works, although it ends optimistically in a major key.|$|E
25|$|The {{second set}} of Préludes for piano (1913) {{features}} Debussy at his most avant-garde, where he uses dissonant harmonies to evoke specific moods and images. He consciously gives titles to each prelude which amplify the preludes' tonal ambiguity and dissonance. He uses scales such as the whole <b>tone</b> <b>scale,</b> musical modes, and the octatonic scale in his preludes which exaggerate this tonal ambiguity, making the key of each prelude almost indistinguishable at times. The second book of Préludes for piano represents his strong interest in the indefinite and esoteric.|$|E
25|$|In this scene, Mussorgsky is hailed to {{be ahead}} of his time musically. His use of the whole <b>tone</b> <b>scale,</b> which uses only whole steps, made the Coronation scene stand out. This {{technique}} was replicated by impressionistic composers about 20 years later who noted his success. Mussorgsky also combined different two-beat and three-beat meters to create a unique sound for his composition called polymeters. These techniques were uncommon during this era and were believed to be almost too overwhelming for the public. This led to his rejection on two different occasions by the Imperial Opera before they decided to perform.|$|E

25|$|Mannette is {{credited}} with several innovations which {{have proven to be}} essential for the evolution of steel pan. He was the first to use a 55-gallon oil barrel instead of biscuit tins or soap boxes. Furthermore, Mannette was the person to sink the top of the drum into a concave shape, thus having more space to place notes as well as achieving a better isolation between the different pitches. Ellie Mannette has developed many instruments of the steel pan family. His use of the whole <b>tone</b> <b>scale</b> on two resonance bodies has become a widely common standard.|$|E
500|$|Rimsky-Korsakov {{was open}} about the {{influences}} in his music, telling Vasily Yastrebtsev, [...] "Study Liszt and Balakirev more closely, and you'll {{see that a}} great deal in me is not mine". He followed Balakirev in his use of the whole <b>tone</b> <b>scale,</b> treatment of folk songs and musical orientalism and Liszt for harmonic adventurousness. (The violin melody used to portray Scheherazade is very closely related to its counterpart in Balakirev's symphonic poem Tamara, while the Russian Easter Overtures follows the design and plan of Balakirev's Second Overture on Russian Themes.) Nevertheless, while he took Glinka and Liszt as his harmonic models, his use of whole tone and octatonic scales do demonstrate his originality. He developed both these compositional devices for the [...] "fantastic" [...] sections of his operas, which depicted magical or supernatural characters and events.|$|E
500|$|Harmony {{could be}} a {{potential}} trap for Tchaikovsky, according to Brown, since Russian creativity {{tended to focus on}} inertia and self-enclosed tableaux, while Western harmony worked against this to propel the music onward and, on a larger scale, shape it. Modulation, the shifting from one key to another, was a driving principle in both harmony and sonata form, the primary Western large-scale musical structure since the middle of the 18th century. Modulation maintained harmonic interest over an extended time-scale, provided a clear contrast between musical themes and showed how those themes were related to each other. One point in Tchaikovsky's favor was [...] "a flair for harmony" [...] that [...] "astonished" [...] Rudolph Kündinger, Tchaikovsky's music tutor during his time at the School of Jurisprudence. Added to what he learned at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory studies, this talent allowed Tchaikovsky to employ a varied range of harmony in his music, from the Western harmonic and textural practices of his first two string quartets {{to the use of the}} whole <b>tone</b> <b>scale</b> in the center of the finale of the Second Symphony, a practice more typically used by The Five.|$|E

2500|$|Debussy's harmonies and chord progressions {{frequently}} exploit dissonances {{without any}} formal resolution. Unlike in his earlier work, {{he no longer}} hides discords in lush harmonies, and the forms are far more irregular and fragmented. These chords that seemingly had no resolution were described by Debussy himself as [...] "floating chords", and were used to set tone and mood in many of his works. The whole <b>tone</b> <b>scale</b> dominates much of his late music.|$|E
2500|$|In 1968, Berio {{completed}} O King, a work {{dedicated to}} the memory of Martin Luther King [...] This movement exists in two versions: one for voice, flute, clarinet, violin, cello and piano, the other for eight voices and orchestra. The orchestral version of O King was, shortly after its completion, integrated into Sinfonia. It uses a fair amount of whole <b>tone</b> <b>scale</b> motives (which also appears in the quote from Le Sacre du Printemps in the third movement).|$|E
2500|$|Although Bartók {{claimed in}} his {{writings}} that his music was always tonal, he rarely uses the chords or scales of tonality, and so the descriptive resources of tonal theory are of limited use. George [...] and Elliott [...] focus on alternative methods of signaling tonal centers, via axes of inversional symmetry. Others view Bartók's axes of symmetry in terms of atonal analytic protocols. Richard [...] argues that inversional symmetry is often a byproduct of another atonal procedure, the formation of chords from transpositionally related dyads. Atonal pitch-class theory also furnishes the resources for exploring polymodal chromaticism, projected sets, privileged patterns, and large set types used as source sets such as the equal tempered twelve tone aggregate, octatonic scale (and alpha chord), the diatonic and heptatonia secunda seven-note scales, and less often the whole <b>tone</b> <b>scale</b> and the primary pentatonic collection [...]|$|E
50|$|In {{the first}} and second scale, B and D are exactly the {{inversion}} of each other. This is not true for the third one. This is the reason why these two scales are regarded as symmetric (although the removal of G makes all 12 <b>tone</b> <b>scales,</b> including those produced with any other tuning system, slightly asymmetric).|$|R
50|$|A {{variety of}} musical scales {{are used in}} {{traditional}} Japanese music. While a twelve-tone (dodecaphonic) Chinese scale has influenced Japanese music since the Heian period, in practice Japanese traditional music is often based on pentatonic (five tone) or heptatonic (seven <b>tone)</b> <b>scales.</b> In some instances, harmonic minor, like in the famous piece Sakura Sakura, is used, while the melodic minor is virtually unused.|$|R
50|$|A Carnatic raga {{consists}} of an ascending and descending scale pattern (known as aarohana and avarohana respectively). Both ascent and descent {{should have at least}} five tones, although rarer ragas contain fewer <b>tones.</b> <b>Scales</b> establish rules for all performers to adhere to in melodic performance, and provide a tonal boundary. Typical scale features also act to help listeners identify ragas.|$|R
2500|$|The gamelan {{has been}} {{appreciated}} by several western composers of classical music, most famously Claude Debussy who heard a Javanese gamelan in {{the premiere of}} Louis-Albert Bourgault-Ducoudray's Rhapsodie Cambodgienne at the Paris Exposition of 1889 (World's Fair). The work had been written seven years earlier in 1882, but received its premiere only in 1889. The gamelan Debussy heard in {{it was in the}} slendro scale and was played by Central Javanese musicians. Despite his enthusiasm, direct citations of gamelan scales, melodies, rhythms, or ensemble textures have not been located in any of Debussy's own compositions. However, the equal-tempered whole <b>tone</b> <b>scale</b> appears in his music of this time and afterward, and a Javanese gamelan-like heterophonic texture is emulated on occasion, particularly in [...] "Pagodes", from Estampes (solo piano, 1903), in which the great gong's cyclic punctuation is symbolized by a prominent perfect fifth.|$|E
50|$|The {{composer}} Olivier Messiaen {{called the}} whole <b>tone</b> <b>scale</b> his first mode of limited transposition. The composer and music theorist George Perle calls the whole <b>tone</b> <b>scale</b> interval cycle 2, or C2. Since {{there are only}} two possible whole <b>tone</b> <b>scale</b> positions (that is, the whole <b>tone</b> <b>scale</b> can be transposed only once), it is either C20 or C21. For this reason, the whole <b>tone</b> <b>scale</b> is also maximally even and may be considered a generated collection.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>tone</b> <b>scale</b> is a {{gradient}} {{chart that}} describes rational or pro-survival behavior on an individual.

Chapter 18 of this book describes the <b>tone</b> <b>scale</b> as it applies to second dynamic:"At the highest MEST point of the <b>Tone</b> <b>Scale,</b> 4.0, one finds monogamy, constancy, a high enjoyment level and very moral reaction towards sex." ...|$|E
50|$|Like Julian Carrillo, he {{explored}} {{the potential of}} a lot microtonal scales either widespread (1/4 tone, 1/3rd tone, 1/6tone) or less known (1/7th tone, 1/5th tone). One of his techniques was to use polytempered music, {{that is to say}} music exploiting the simultaneous use of several different microtonal scales. This concept suggested by Carillo. In Tombeau de Carillo he exploited 1/2, 1/3rd, 1/5th and 1/6 <b>tone</b> <b>scales</b> simultaneously.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{establish}} {{reliability of}} the <b>Tone</b> Assessment <b>Scale</b> and modified Ashworth scale in acute stroke patients. SETTING: A North Liverpool university hospital. PATIENTS: Eighteen men and 14 women admitted with acute stroke and still in hospital at the study start date (median age, 74 yrs; median Barthel score, 8). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The modified Ashworth <b>scale</b> and the <b>Tone</b> Assessment <b>Scale.</b> STUDY DESIGN: The 32 patients were examined with both scales on the same occasion by two raters (interrater comparison) and on two occasions by one rater (intrarater comparison). RESULTS: The {{reliability of the}} modified Ashworth scale was very good (kappa =. 84 for interrater and. 83 for intrarater comparisons). The reliability of the <b>Tone</b> Assessment <b>Scale</b> was {{not as strong as}} the modified Ashworth scale, with marked variability in the assessment of posture (kappa =. 22 to. 50 for interrater and. 29 to. 55 for intrarater comparisons) and associated reaction (kappa/kappaW = -. 05 to. 79 for interrater and. 19 to. 83 for intrarater comparisons). However, those aspects of the <b>Tone</b> Assessment <b>Scale</b> that addressed response to passive movement and that are scored similarly to the modified Ashworth scale showed good to very good interrater reliability (kappaW =. 79 to. 92) and good to very good intrarater reliability (kappaW =. 72 to. 86), except for the question related to movement at the ankle where agreement was only moderate (kappaW =. 59). CONCLUSIONS: The modified Ashworth scale is reliable. The section of the <b>Tone</b> Assessment <b>Scale</b> relating to response to passive movement is reliable at various joints, except the ankle. It may assist in studies on the prevalence of spasticity after stroke and the relationship between tone and function. Further development of a measure of spasticity at the ankle is required.

The present study aimed to examine the utility of a new measure for cancer prevention research, the Skin <b>Tone</b> Rating <b>Scale.</b> Australian undergraduate women (N[*]=[*] 156) completed an online questionnaire measuring skin tone dissatisfaction, peer and media norms surrounding tanning, internalisation of a tanned ideal, appearance reasons for tanning, and self-reported tanning behaviour. The two-item Skin <b>Tone</b> Rating <b>Scale</b> provided a short and easy-to-administer measure of skin tone dissatisfaction that correlated with self-reported tanning behaviour. The Skin <b>Tone</b> Rating <b>Scale</b> was also moderately related to appearance reasons for tanning and internalisation of a tanned ideal, demonstrating concurrent validity. Socio-cultural influences (from peers and media) were positively correlated with skin tone dissatisfaction, and this relationship was partially mediated by internalisation of a tanned ideal.
