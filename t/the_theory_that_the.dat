5|$|In his 1778 work Epochs of Nature Georges Buffon {{referred}} to fossils, {{in particular the}} discovery of fossils of tropical species such as elephants and rhinoceros in northern Europe, as evidence for <b>the</b> <b>theory</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> earth had started out much warmer than it currently was and had been gradually cooling.|$|E
5|$|The {{evidence}} of the wreck refutes Goodall's theory of a torpedo explosion, while the eyewitness {{evidence of}} venting from the 4-inch magazine prior to the main explosion conflicts with <b>the</b> <b>theory</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Hood was blown up by her own guns. The other theories listed above remain valid possibilities.|$|E
5|$|Hitler later {{blamed the}} failure of his {{invasion}} of the Soviet Union, {{which had to be}} delayed, on Mussolini's failed conquest of Greece. <b>The</b> <b>theory</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Battle of Greece delayed the invasion of the Soviet Union has been refuted by the majority of historians, who have accused Hitler of trying to deflect blame from himself to his ally, Italy. It nevertheless had serious consequences for the Axis war effort in the North African theatre. Enno von Rintelen, who was the military attaché in Rome, emphasizes from the German point of view, the strategic mistake of not taking Malta.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>theories</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> ringfort either pre- or post-dates the Early Middle Ages in Ireland, {{are both}} based on {{essentially}} the same premise, as is highlighted here by Tadhg O'Keefe {{in relation to the}} latter argument.|$|R

25|$|Cultural {{determinism}} {{or social}} determinism is <b>the</b> nurture-focused <b>theory</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{culture in which}} we are raised determines who we are.|$|R
5|$|In 1922, the Estonian {{astronomer}} Ernst Öpik gave {{a distance}} determination that supported <b>the</b> <b>theory</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Andromeda Nebula {{is indeed a}} distant extra-galactic object. Using the new 100inch Mt. Wilson telescope, Edwin Hubble was able to resolve the outer parts of some spiral nebulae as collections of individual stars and identified some Cepheid variables, thus allowing him to estimate {{the distance to the}} nebulae: they were far too distant {{to be part of the}} Milky Way. In 1936 Hubble produced a classification of galactic morphology that is used to this day.|$|E
5|$|In 1984, the French {{government}} made an official investigation, concluding {{that it was}} possible that the aircraft had reached Newfoundland. In 1989, the NBC television series Unsolved Mysteries advanced <b>the</b> <b>theory</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> two aviators made it across the ocean, but crashed and perished in the woods of Maine. One of Nungesser's relatives, William Nungesser, made several trips to Maine to search, focusing his energies around the north slope of Round Lake Hills in Washington County, Maine, as well as the area around Lake Winnipesaukee.|$|E
5|$|Invalided out {{of service}} in June 1941, Bradman spent months recuperating, unable even to shave himself or comb his hair due {{to the extent of}} the muscular pain he suffered. He resumed {{stockbroking}} during 1942. In his biography of Bradman, Charles Williams expounded <b>the</b> <b>theory</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> physical problems were psychosomatic, induced by stress and possibly depression; Bradman read the book's manuscript and did not disagree. Had any cricket been played at this time, he would not have been available. Although he found some relief in 1945 when referred to the Melbourne masseur Ern Saunders, Bradman permanently lost the feeling in the thumb and index finger of his (dominant) right hand.|$|E
5000|$|In 1984, Armer {{compiled}} {{a series of}} his lectures into a volume entitled A Comprehensive Approach to the Piano, in which he discusses his method of playing the instrument. Central to this are <b>the</b> <b>theories</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> keys should be moved using the hand's natural [...] "grasping" [...] motion, and that music-making should be a largely mental phenomenon and pianists should therefore do much of their practicing in their heads.|$|R

5|$|It {{states that}} {{the theory of the}} Arab hijackers was created by the CIA, and that these Arabs may not even have been aware that the planes were going to crash. Seven of the alleged hijackers are claimed in the book to have been found alive and well after the attacks. The book explores the {{possibility}} that the various aircraft could have been remote-controlled. It cites observations in support of <b>the</b> <b>theory</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> collapse of the World Trade Center might have been due to explosives. Von Bülow does not believe that Osama bin Laden and al-Qaeda are responsible for the 9/11 attacks.|$|E
5|$|Most of the city's monumental {{projects}} were {{built on the}} wadi's northern bank. Among them is the Temple of Bel, on a tell which {{was the site of}} an earlier temple (known as the Hellenistic temple). However, excavation supports <b>the</b> <b>theory</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> tell was originally located on the southern bank, and the wadi was diverted south of the tell to incorporate the temple into Palmyra's late first and early second century urban organization on the north bank.|$|E
5|$|Ram Shankar Bhattacharya, an Indologist, dates the Pune {{version of}} a {{manuscript}} of the text to about the 13th or 14th century CE, and notes that {{this version of the}} Yoga Yajnavalkya quotes verses from Hatha Yoga texts. He also points out that Gargi is mentioned as the wife of Yajnavalkya in the manuscript. However, no other text affirms that Gargi was the wife of Yajnavalkya; rather, Maitreyi and Katyayani are listed as his two wives, leading to <b>the</b> <b>theory</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Pune manuscript is a corrupted and more modern edition of the original text.|$|E

5|$|The US federal {{government}} intervened, obtaining an injunction against the strike on <b>the</b> <b>theory</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> strikers had obstructed the US Mail, carried on Pullman cars, {{by refusing to}} show up for work. President Grover Cleveland, who Debs had supported in all three of his presidential campaigns, sent the United States Army to enforce the injunction. The entrance of the Army was enough to break the strike. Overall, 30 strikers were killed in the strike, 13 of them in Chicago, and thousands were blacklisted. An estimated $80 million worth of property was damaged, and Debs was found guilty of contempt of court for violating the injunction and sent to federal prison.|$|E
5|$|The World Organization to Investigate the Persecution of Falun Gong further called {{attention}} to portrayals of Wang Jindong on state-run television, claiming {{that the man who}} self-immolated on the square was not the same person who appeared in subsequent interviews with CCTV. It pointed to a voice analysis conducted by the Speech Processing Laboratory at National Taiwan University, which concluded that the voices did not match, and also noted that the hairline and facial proportions appeared to be different. These observations were used to advance <b>the</b> <b>theory</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> self-immolators were actors.|$|E
5|$|The {{species is}} Eurasian in origin, {{and may have}} evolved from either Vulpes alopecoides or the related Chinese V.chikushanensis, both of which lived during the Middle Villafranchian. The {{earliest}} fossil specimens of V.vulpes were uncovered in Baranya, Hungary dating from 3.4-1.8million years ago. The ancestral species was likely smaller than the current one, as the earliest red fox fossils are smaller than modern populations. The earliest fossil remains of the modern species {{date back to the}} mid-Pleistocene in association with the refuse of early human settlements. This has led to <b>the</b> <b>theory</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> red fox was hunted by primitive humans as both a source of food and pelts.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>theory</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Sun is {{the center}} around which the planets orbit was first {{proposed}} by the ancient Greek Aristarchus of Samos in the 3rd century BC, and later adopted by Seleucus of Seleucia (see Heliocentrism). This view was developed in a more detailed mathematical model of a heliocentric system in the 16th century by Nicolaus Copernicus.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>theory</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> song {{refers to}} the burying, perhaps alive, of {{children}} in the foundations of the bridge was first advanced by Alice Bertha Gomme (later Lady Gomme) in The Traditional Games of England, Scotland and Ireland (1894–1898) and perpetuated by the usually sceptical Iona and Peter Opie. This was based around the idea that a bridge would collapse unless the body of a human sacrifice were buried in its foundations and that the watchman is actually a human sacrifice, who will then watch over the bridge. However, there is no archaeological evidence for any human remains in the foundations of London Bridge.|$|E
5|$|At {{the head}} of Macedonia's {{government}} was the king (basileus). From at least the reign of Philip II the king was assisted by the royal pages (basilikoi paides), bodyguards (somatophylakes), companions (hetairoi), friends (philoi), an assembly that included members of the military, and magistrates during the Hellenistic period. Evidence is lacking for {{the extent to which}} each of these groups shared authority with the king or if their existence had a basis in a formal constitutional framework. Before the reign of Philip II, the only institution supported by textual evidence is the monarchy. In 1931, Friedrich Granier was the first to propose that by the time of Philip II's reign, Macedonia had a constitutional government with laws that delegated rights and customary privileges to certain groups, especially to its citizen soldiers, although the majority of evidence for the army's alleged right to appoint a new king and judge cases of treason stems from the reign of Alexander III of Macedon. Pietro de Francisci was the first to refute these ideas and advance <b>the</b> <b>theory</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Macedonian government was an autocracy ruled by the whim of the monarch, although this issue of kingship and governance is still unresolved in academia.|$|E
40|$|<b>The</b> <b>theory</b> {{of phase}} {{ordering}} kinetics for the O(2) model using the gaussian auxiliary field approach is reexamined from two points of view. The effects of fluctuations about the ordering field are included and we organize <b>the</b> <b>theory</b> such <b>that</b> <b>the</b> auxiliary field correlation function is analytic in the short-scaled distance (x) expansion. These two points are connected {{and we find}} in <b>the</b> refined <b>theory</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> divergence at the origin in the defect-defect correlation function ˜g(x) obtained in <b>the</b> original <b>theory</b> is removed. Modifications to the order-parameter autocorrelation exponent λ are computed...|$|R

50|$|<b>The</b> 19th-century <b>theory</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Sambre was the {{location}} of Julius Caesar's battle against a Belgic confederation (57 BC), was discarded a long time ago, but is still repeated.|$|R
5|$|Danish author Steen Steensen Blicher, {{an amateur}} {{archaeologist}} {{and one of}} the first to visit the site, made the first literary reference to the Haraldskær Woman. In 1836, he published his novella Gravhøjen which was a parody about a mistaken archaeological find. However, by 1841 Blicher seemed to have changed his mind about the Haraldskær Woman's identity when he wrote the poem Dronning Gunhild, a lament for the dead queen in the bog. In 1846, the Danish playwright Jens Christian Hostrup wrote his comedy, A Sparrow Doing a Crane Dance, (En Spurv i Tranedans), in which the ghost of Queen Gunnhild gives a magical ring to a scheming tailor and makes everyone blind to his actions. Hostrup's play indirectly satirized <b>the</b> <b>theory</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Haraldskær Woman was Queen Gunnhild, and became the first major public endorsement of Worsaae’s hypothesis.|$|E
5|$|Little {{can be said}} of the {{evolutionary}} history of the genus, mainly because remains of other Neogene New World vultures are usually younger or even more fragmentary. The teratorns held sway over the ecological niche of the extant group especially in North America. The Kern vulture seems to slightly precede the main bout of the Great American Interchange, and it is notable that the living diversity of New World vultures seems to have originated in Central America. The Kern vulture would therefore represent a northwards divergence possibly sister to the S. fisheri – S. papa lineage. The fossil record, though scant, supports <b>the</b> <b>theory</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> ancestral king vultures and South American condors separated at least some 5 mya.|$|E
5|$|Murray {{also became}} closely {{involved}} in the first-wave feminist movement, joining the Women's Social and Political Union and devoting much time to improving women's status at UCL. Unable to return to Egypt due to the First World War, she focused her research on the witch-cult hypothesis, <b>the</b> <b>theory</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> witch trials of Early Modern Christendom were an attempt to extinguish a surviving pre-Christian, pagan religion devoted to a Horned God. Although later academically discredited, the theory gained widespread attention and proved a significant influence on the emerging new religious movement of Wicca. From 1921 to 1931 Murray undertook excavations of prehistoric sites on Malta and Menorca and developed her interest in folkloristics. Awarded an honorary doctorate in 1927, she was appointed assistant professor in 1928 and retired from UCL in 1935. That year she visited Palestine to aid Petrie's excavation of Tall al-Ajjul and in 1937 she led a small excavation at Petra in Jordan. Taking on {{the presidency of the}} Folklore Society in later life, she lectured at such institutions as the University of Cambridge and City Literary Institute, and continued to publish in an independent capacity until her death.|$|E
