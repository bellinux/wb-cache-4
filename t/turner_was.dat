5|$|In 1990, media mogul Ted Turner {{announced}} he would begin colourising black-and-white motion pictures {{to make them more}} pleasing to audiences watching his cable networks.

5|$|Jaekle {{kicked off}} to the Maryland 30-yard line where it was {{returned}} by Green for two yards. A fresh Da'Rel Scott then made his first appearance in the game. He carried the ball four times in succession {{to advance to the}} Nevada 46-yard line. On third down with nine yards to go, <b>Turner</b> <b>was</b> sacked by defensive lineman Kevin Basped and the ball was knocked loose. It was picked up by Wolf Pack linebacker Brandon Marshall who then also fumbled. Maryland offensive lineman Scott Burley recovered it on the Nevada 45-yard line. The alternating changes in possession gave Maryland a first down, and Turner then connected with Darrius Heyward-Bey on an 11-yard pass for another first down. Scott rushed twice to pick up a first down at the Nevada 23-yard line. After a rush by Meggett, <b>Turner</b> <b>was</b> sacked by defensive end Dontay Moch and again fumbled. This time, Nevada recovered the ball and retained possession. Kaepernick then passed to wide receiver Mike McCoy for 38yards to the Maryland 27-yard line. Vai Taua picked up seven yards on a rush attempt, and the quarter came to an end with Maryland leading, 28–21.|$|E
5|$|The 1985 Rajneeshee {{assassination}} {{plot was}} a conspiracy {{by a group of}} high-ranking followers of Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh (later known as Osho) to assassinate Charles Turner, the then-United States Attorney for the District of Oregon. Rajneesh's personal secretary and second-in-command, Ma Anand Sheela (Sheela Silverman), assembled the group after <b>Turner</b> <b>was</b> appointed to investigate illegal activity at Rajneeshpuram.

5|$|The current {{head coach}} for the Chargers is Anthony Lynn, who {{replaced}} Mike McCoy after he was fired {{at the end of}} the 2016 season. In 2007, Norv Turner had led the team to a win in the playoffs for the first time since Bobby Ross in 1992. <b>Turner</b> <b>was</b> fired on December 31, 2012, after six seasons in charge of the franchise. Marty Schottenheimer, the head coach before Turner, led the team into the playoffs in 2004 and 2006, but they were unsuccessful both times. Six coaches—Gillman, Don Coryell, Ross, Schottenheimer, Turner and McCoy—have led the Chargers into the playoffs.|$|E
5|$|The win was not {{followed}} with more {{success and the}} team performed badly in the following seasons. At the AGM in October 1982, {{it was revealed that}} the club were in £1.6million of debt, mainly due to escalating wages and building costs, including the construction of the North Stand. At the end of November Ron and Donald Bendall resigned from the board to be replaced by Doug Ellis, who bought Ron Bendall's 42% shareholding. In January 1983, Villa beat Barcelona 31 on aggregate to win the 1982 UEFA Super Cup. Barton remained in charge for two seasons after the European Cup triumph, but was sacked {{at the end of the}} 198384 season despite Villa finishing tenth in the First Division and reaching the semi-finals of the League Cup. Shrewsbury Town manager Graham <b>Turner</b> <b>was</b> brought in as his successor. <b>Turner</b> <b>was</b> unable to reverse the decline, and in 1986 Villa narrowly avoided relegation to the Second Division. A lacklustre start to the following season saw Turner sacked halfway through September. Billy McNeill was hired in his place, but was unable to save Villa from relegation. They were relegated to the Second Division just five years after winning the European Cup. McNeill handed in his notice and moved to Celtic when the season ended. Chairman Ellis persuaded Watford manager Graham Taylor to take over the reins and set about rebuilding the team.|$|E
5|$|<b>Turner</b> <b>was</b> {{discovered}} in 1936 at the Top Hat Malt Shop in Hollywood, California. At {{the age of}} 16, she was signed to a personal contract by Warner Bros. director Mervyn LeRoy, who took her {{with him when he}} moved to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in 1938. Turner attracted attention in her first film, LeRoy's They Won't Forget (1937), and she later starred in featured roles, often as an ingenue. Her auburn hair was bleached blonde for a 1939 film at MGM, and she remained blonde {{for the rest of her}} life, except for a few film roles.|$|E

5|$|<b>Turner</b> <b>was</b> {{introduced}} to Nichiren Shoshu Buddhism in 1973 {{by a friend}} of Ike's named Valerie Bishop. Turner wrote in her autobiography I, Tina that after Valerie taught her to recite the Buddhist chant Nam Myoho Renge Kyo, Tina observed that Ike, instead of hitting her for singing supposed wrong notes during recording sessions, would give her money to go shopping, something she regarded as a benefit of her newfound spiritual practice.|$|E

5|$|A lifelong heavy smoker, <b>Turner</b> <b>was</b> {{diagnosed}} with throat cancer in May 1992. At {{the urging of}} her daughter, Turner underwent radiation therapy to treat the cancer, and in February 1993, announced {{that she was in}} remission. Despite treatment, the cancer returned in July 1994. In September 1994, she made her final public appearance at the San Sebastián International Film Festival in Spain to accept a Lifetime Achievement Award, and was bound to a wheelchair for much of the event. Turner died nine months later at the age of 74 on June 29, 1995, of complications from the cancer at her home in Century City, Los Angeles, California.

5|$|At Chaminade, {{he led a}} pass-oriented offense and, {{during his}} senior year, {{accumulated}} 139 completions on 265 attempts, 2,047 yards, 16 touchdowns, and 11 interceptions. He {{was named to the}} All-California Interscholastic Federation (CIF) second team as a senior and the All-Mission League team as both a junior and senior. SuperPrep picked him as a Far West all-region selection and PrepStar as an all-region selection. <b>Turner</b> <b>was</b> assessed as a Rivals.com three-star and Scout.com two-star recruit. He received scholarship offers from Boise State, Illinois, Louisville, Maryland, Oregon, Utah, and UTEP. Maryland offered him after another Californian recruit, Josh Portis, chose Florida instead—although Portis later transferred to Maryland and served as a backup alongside Turner. Turner ultimately chose Maryland, which is located just outside Washington, D.C., partly due to his interest in politics.|$|E
5|$|In 1954, she {{was then}} {{cast in the}} epic The Prodigal (1955), {{followed}} by the John Wayne adventure film The Sea Chase (1955), which Turner shot in Hawaii. After starring in the period drama Diane (1956), MGM opted not to renew Turner's contract. This was a difficult time for Hollywood's major studios because a recent court decision forced them to divest themselves of their movie theaters. In addition, television had caught on in a big way; the public was staying home. <b>Turner</b> <b>was</b> just one of MGM's star roster to be let go. Her career recovered briefly after she appeared in the hugely successful big-screen adaptation of Grace Metalious's best-selling novel, Peyton Place (1957), for which she was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress. Another few box-office failures followed (Another Time, Another Place, for example) when the 1958 scandal surrounding her daughter's killing of Johnny Stompanato threatened to derail her career completely.|$|E
5|$|On February 28, 1985, Congressman James H.

The assassination plot was uncovered by federal law enforcement {{as a result of the}} ensuing investigation into activities at Rajneeshpuram. <b>Turner</b> <b>was</b> never physically harmed, and had retired by 1995.|$|E
