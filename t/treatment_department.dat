The decision to establish the university was an idea developed by a number of doctors at Amin Hospital in 1939. Eventually, the board of directors of the hospital approved a plan to establish Isfahan Higher Medical Institute in 1946. In September of the same year, an ad signed by lecturer Dr. Jelveh, then caretaker of Isfahan Province Health and Medical <b>Treatment</b> <b>Department,</b> was published in local newspapers calling on prospective students to enroll in the new institute. The first classes were held at Sadi High School (now Soureh Institute). Many more students enrolled in subsequent years; therefore, the institute had to find a larger campus to accommodate the growing number of new students. On October 29, 1950, the first series of classes were held at the University of Isfahan. Other colleges such as the Medical University, the newly established College of Medicine and Literature College on Shahzadeh Ebrahim street also joined the University of Isfahan and were relocated in the main campus in subsequent years. The university later offered programs in human sciences, engineering and medical sciences. Related programs of medical sciences were then separated from the University of Isfahan and became an independent university in 1985, named medical university of Isfahan.|$|E
