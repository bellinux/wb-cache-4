5|$|Born in Santa Fe, New Mexico, Petry had {{an active}} youth, {{and joined the}} Army after high school. Completing the Ranger Indoctrination Program, he was {{deployed}} several times to both Iraq and Afghanistan {{as a member of}} the 2nd Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment. On May 26, 2008 during his seventh deployment, Petry was a member of a team on a mission to capture a Taliban target in Paktia Province. Despite being wounded in both legs by gunfire, Petry continued to fight and give orders. When a grenade landed between him and two other soldiers, Petry grabbed it and attempted to <b>throw</b> <b>it</b> <b>away</b> from them. He saved the soldiers' lives but the grenade exploded, severing his right hand.|$|E
25|$|Is {{he going}} to <b>throw</b> <b>it</b> <b>away?</b> Is {{he going to}} beat him with it? Or even kill him with it? Beckett’s plays often have a certain open-endedness and this sketch is no different. Perhaps because it has taken so little time to build up to this climax it lacks the {{resonance}} of Endgame’s concluding scene where we never know if Clov ever leaves Hamm or the close of Happy Days where the audience is left wondering if Willie is reaching for the gun or for Winnie.|$|E
25|$|P. snelleni {{exists in}} {{temperate}} locations, where cold and hot weather conditions can arise. When the temperature becomes hot, as it often does in Japan {{during the summer}} months when the P. snelleni nests are in existence, the paper wasps need to take measures to cool down the nest. Water transport to the nest occurs after the appearance of larvae, and once it starts, it occurs about 10-15 times in succession. Water drops are carried by the wasps and put on the concave nest roof. This aids in cooling the nest. When there is shade over the nest, the wasps move the water and <b>throw</b> <b>it</b> <b>away.</b>|$|E

25|$|The use of guns in Noten's work {{came about}} by chance. In the past Noten had felt {{uneasy about the}} large number of people in his {{neighbourhood}} that carried guns. Whenever he could he would ask people to give him their gun or he would buy it from them. He would then <b>throw</b> <b>it</b> <b>away</b> or keep it in store without any particular purpose for it. After a while he had quite a collection and he thought he might just as well use these guns in his works of art. It also gave him the idea of a project he called Design Against Crime in which he collaborated with the authorities to persuade people to give up their guns in return for a work of art.|$|E
25|$|Lisa shows Homer {{her school}} science project, a robot named Linguo, who corrects grammar. Homer breaks it by pouring beer down its throat, and Lisa runs upstairs frustrated. Meanwhile, Marge accidentally severs Homer's thumb {{as she is}} cutting brownies. They drive to the hospital, but Dr. Hibbert claims that the {{insurance}} will not cover the cost, so they instead drive off for Dr. Nick's clinic. Since Homer's thumb is starting to shrivel up, he stops by at Moe's, where he gets a pickle brine solution. He gets distracted when Moe offers him a beer. Homer rushes {{out the door and}} sees Marge is gone. He hitchhikes with Cletus who drives him to Dr. Nick's, but they discover the clinic is on fire. Homer asks Cletus to drive him to Shelbyville Hospital, but his truck gets stolen and Homer leaves for the hospital on foot. His thumb is almost completely shrivelled up now, and he is just about to <b>throw</b> <b>it</b> <b>away</b> when an explosion sends Linguo's severed head flying up into the air and it lands next to him.|$|E
25|$|September: Aldershot {{continued}} their early unbeaten {{run with a}} third consecutive 1–1 draw at home to Northampton, though the Shots needed a Ben Harding volley in the 5th minute of injury time to salvage a point. The next game - away to promotion-chasing Port Vale - promised {{to be a tough}} test, and this was proved right as the club suffered its first loss of the season, Gary Roberts scoring the only goal of the game. On 16 September the management brought in winger Marlon Jackson on loan from Bristol City, a player who assistant manager Gary Owers believed would help the team in the attacking third. Wycombe were the next visitors to the Recreation Ground, which meant a return for former Shots' boss Gary Waddock, who led the club to the Football Conference championship in the 2007–08 season. The match {{failed to live up to}} expectations, ending in a dull goalless draw. This fifth low-scoring draw of the season encouraged fears that the side were not good enough up front, and were not converting the few chances being presented to them. The squad responded by taking a 2–0 lead away to Stockport in their next game, only to <b>throw</b> <b>it</b> <b>away</b> in the final minutes to draw yet again. A win did come before the end of the month, however, Morgan again netting in the final ten minutes to snatch all three points away to Torquay.|$|E

At dawn September 3, A Company attacked {{to gain the}} high ground {{which was part of}} the designated Marine line of departure. The company fought its way up the slope to within [...] of the top, which was held by the firmly entrenched North Koreans. At this point the company commander caught a North Korean-thrown grenade and was wounded by its fragments as he tried to <b>throw</b> <b>it</b> <b>away</b> from his men. The company with help from Marine tank fire eventually gained its objective, but this early morning battle for the line of departure delayed the planned attack.|$|E

She was considered too short and the role went to actress Nia Long. Jada and Will became friends, and began dating in 1995. On December 31, 1997, about 100 guests attended their wedding at The Cloisters, near her hometown of Baltimore, Maryland. Regarding her marriage, Jada said that they are [...] "private people" [...] and told one interviewer, [...] "I will throw my career away before I let it break up our marriage.

Phil Simms threw four interceptions but coach Bill Parcells denied he was struggling, [...] "ou'd like not to take a sack in the scoring zone, but sometimes it's hard {{to know when to}} <b>throw</b> <b>it</b> <b>away.</b> Two of Phil's interceptions were rebounds {{that had nothing to do}} with the quarterback. On the interception on fourth and 14 at the end, he was trying to make a play. I think I would have thrown there, too. The other interception was his mistake. I don't think he's in a slump." ...|$|E

500|$|Simkins, {{a son of}} Edgefield, while {{recognizing}} faults in Tillman's racial policies, stated that [...] "no South Carolinian, with the single exception of Calhoun, has ever made a profounder impression on his generation than Tillman." [...] The late senator's supporters and protégés remained long in South Carolina, encouraging a view of Tillman as a great man in state and national history. James F. Byrnes, for example, repeated Tillman's themes of race war {{on the floor of}} the House of Representatives in 1919. In 1940, Byrnes, by then a senator and soon to sit on the U.S. Supreme Court, dedicated a statue of Tillman outside the South Carolina State House and called him the state's [...] "first New Dealer". Others who knew and at one time admired Tillman included Strom Thurmond, son of Tillman's Edgefield attorney, who saw and was inspired by Tillman's campaigning style as a boy. Other southerners were highly negative: Lyndon B. Johnson said of Tillman, [...] "He might have been president. I'd like to sit down with him and ask how it was to <b>throw</b> <b>it</b> <b>away</b> for the sake of hating." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} days of street newspapers, people were often {{reluctant}} to buy from homeless vendors for fear that they were being scammed. Furthermore, many of the more activist papers fail to sell well because their writing and production are perceived to be unprofessional and lackluster. [...] Topics covered are sometimes seen as lacking newsworthy content, and of little relevance or interest to [...] the general public or the homeless community." [...] have traditionally been long on personal essays and short on hard news". [...] Organizations in Montreal and San Francisco have responded to these criticisms by offering workshops in writing and journalism for homeless contributors. Papers such as StreetWise have in the past been criticized as [...] "grim" [...] and for having vendors that are too loud and intrusive. Some newspapers sell well but may not be widely read, as many people will donate to vendors without buying, or buy the newspaper and then <b>throw</b> <b>it</b> <b>away.</b> Howley has described readers' hesitance or unwillingness to read the papers as [...] "compassion fatigue". On the other hand, those papers that do sell well and are widely read, such as The Big Issue, are often targets of criticism for being too [...] "mainstream" [...] or commercial.|$|E
500|$|Pound taught Hemingway {{to write}} sparingly. Pound wrote {{to him that}} [...] "anything put {{on top of the}} subject is BAD... The subject is always {{interesting}} enough without blankets." [...] Hemingway would write in A Moveable Feast (published posthumously in 1964), [...] "If I started to write elaborately, like someone presenting or introducing something, I found that I could cut that scrollwork or ornament out and <b>throw</b> <b>it</b> <b>away</b> and start with the first true simple declarative sentence I had written." [...] In Our Time was written during the author's experimentation phase, his first attempts towards a minimalist style. The prose in [...] "Indian Camp" [...] and [...] "Big Two-Hearted River" [...] is sharper and more abstract than in other stories, and by employing simple sentences and diction– techniques he learned writing for newspapers– the prose is timeless with an almost mythic quality, explains Benson. The tightly compressed sentence structure emulates and reflects Pound's imagist style, bringing to prose narrative the stripped-down style Pound famously established in 1913 with poems such as [...] "In a Station of the Metro". Thomas Strychacz compares Hemingway's prose to Pound's poetry, writing, [...] "Hemingway's terse, tight-lipped, tightly wound fragments are equally extraordinary in their dramatic intensity." ...|$|E

500|$|Roger advises Lane {{about how}} to ensnare a client at dinner. Roger informs Lane to find the man's source of regret, and make it {{relatable}} to himself, forming a [...] "conspiracy" [...] of feeling between the pair. Pryce's dinner does not go smoothly; the Jaguar representative appears to have no regrets in his life, and Lane is forced to plan another lunch to try again at confirming the new business. Upon hearing of this failure, Pete tactfully tells Lane to maintain a friendly relationship with the target, and to let Accounts take the business from there. Roger compliments Pete's letting Lane down softly and taking the task off his hands, forming a renewed alliance with Pete. At the dinner meeting, Edwin, the Jaguar representative, assures Don, Roger, and Pete they have his business, {{but he wants to}} have some fun. The executives quickly learn what kind of fun Edwin has in mind and they visit a local brothel, where Edwin, Roger, and Pete all cheat on their wives, leaving Don at the bar. Don later shares a cab with Pete on the way home in which the latter, drunk, criticizes Don as hypocritical for judging Pete's adulterous actions. Don explains he is not judging; he merely didn't know Pete was miserable. Pete replies sarcastically that he has everything, and Don warns him not to <b>throw</b> <b>it</b> <b>away.</b>|$|E
2500|$|This exhibit - so beloved of the Leeds populace {{that when}} the curators wanted to <b>throw</b> <b>it</b> <b>away,</b> the Yorkshire Post {{newspaper}} held a campaign to retain it - has a strange history. [...] It was a tigerskin rug when presented to the Museum in the 19th century. [...] Museum records {{give the impression that}} the tiger had been shot for spending too much time near a village in India. [...] The pelt was then combined with one or more other tigerskins, and instead of being mounted properly it was stuffed with straw. [...] For over a century it has sagged somewhat, {{as can be seen in}} the photograph. [...] Meanwhile, the story of a tiger shot for its mere presence at the edge of a village became a legend of the killer of one man, then of two people, then the serial killer of forty. [...] However the pelt may now be dangerous after all, in a sense, as the Victorians may have preserved it with arsenical soap.|$|E
2500|$|In his 2009 book [...] "Parkour", David Belle {{stressed}} {{that the most important}} aspect of parkour is not the physical movements, but rather the practitioner's mentality and understanding of its principles. [...] "When young trainees come to see me and give me videos telling me to check out what they are doing, I just take the tape and <b>throw</b> <b>it</b> <b>away.</b> What I'm interested in is what the guy's got in his head, if he has self-confidence, if he masters the technique, if he has understood the principles of parkour. I just can't deal with guys who do Parkour because they saw videos on the Internet and thought it was kinda cool and want to do even better." [...] Further, he states the importance of traceurs being aware of their abilities and limitations, and developing in their own way. [...] "When a young person asks me: 'Can you show me how to do this?' I simply answer: [...] "No, I am going to show you how I do it. Then, you'll have to learn with your own technique, your own way of moving, your style, your abilities and your limitations. You are going to learn to be yourself, not someone else." ...|$|E

2500|$|Featuring the {{portrait}} of an individual on a coin, which became legal in 44 BC, caused the coin {{to be viewed as}} embodying the attributes of the individual portrayed. Dio wrote that following the death of Caligula the Senate demonetized his coinage, and ordered that they be melted. Regardless of whether or not this actually occurred, it demonstrates the importance and meaning that was attached to the imagery on a coin. The philosopher Epictetus jokingly wrote: [...] "Whose image does this sestertius carry? Trajan's? Give it to me. Nero's? <b>Throw</b> <b>it</b> <b>away,</b> it is unacceptable, it is rotten." [...] Although the writer did not seriously expect people to get rid of their coins, this quotation demonstrates that the Romans attached a moral value to the images on their coins. Unlike the obverse, which during the imperial period almost always featured a portrait, the reverse was far more varied in its depiction. During the late Republic there were often political messages to the imagery, especially during the periods of civil war. However, {{by the middle of the}} Empire, although there were types that made important statements, and some that were overtly political or propagandistic in nature, the majority of the types were stock images of personifications or deities. While some images can be related to the policy or actions of a particular emperor, many of the choices seem arbitrary and the personifications and deities were so prosaic that their names were often omitted, as they were readily recognizable by their appearance and attributes alone.|$|E
2500|$|Cardinals pitcher Jeff Weaver (an ex-Tiger) was {{cruising}} {{into the}} fourth inning, and {{he appeared to}} be nowhere near trouble with a lead-off groundout, followed by a routine popup by Magglio Ordóñez. This popup turned out to be much more troublesome than it first appeared: right fielder Chris Duncan dropped the ball, apparently distracted by center fielder Jim Edmonds who was also going after the ball. With Ordóñez on via the error, the very next pitch of the game was hit by Sean Casey into the right-field seats just inside the foul pole for a two-run homer that gave Detroit the lead, 2–1. The Cardinals would threaten immediately {{in the bottom of the}} inning, however, with Yadier Molina and So Taguchi each singling to put runners at first and second with one out. Pitcher Jeff Weaver then came up and attempted to bunt the runners over to second and third. The bunt was fielded cleanly by the pitcher Justin Verlander, but he attempted to force out the lead runner at third and threw the ball into the left-field foul area. This allowed Molina to score to tie it up, with Taguchi and Weaver arriving safely at third and second. Later, Verlander said [...] "I picked it up and said, Don't <b>throw</b> <b>it</b> <b>away,</b> instead of just throwing it. [...] I got tentative." [...] The throwing error by Verlander was the fifth error by Detroit pitchers in the World Series, having committed one per game, setting a new World Series record. (A placard held by a Cardinals fan in the stands read [...] "HIT IT TO THE PITCHER"). [...] The next batter, David Eckstein, grounded out to score the runner from third, and St. Louis secured their lead, 3–2.|$|E
