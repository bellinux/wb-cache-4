5000|$|The GHz {{energy gap}} between the energy levels of a superconducting qubit is {{intentionally}} designed to be compatible with available electronic equipment, due to the terahertz gap - lack of equipment in the higher frequency band. In addition, the superconductor energy gap implies a <b>top</b> <b>limit</b> of operation below ~1THz (beyond it, the Cooper pairs break). On the other hand, the energy level separation cannot be too small due to cooling considerations: a temperature of 1K implies energy fluctuations of 20 GHz. Temperatures of tens of mili-Kelvin achieved in dilution refrigerators allow qubit operation at a ~5 GHz energy level separation. The qubit energy level separation may often be adjusted by means of controlling a dedicated bias current line, providing a [...] "knob" [...] to fine tune the qubit parameters.|$|E

30|$|The {{collision}} {{force is}} considered {{to act in the}} ‘X’ direction, i.e., the traffic direction. The effect of bearings and the partial fixity offered by the resistance of the bearings are accommodated by applying lateral spring elements capable of resisting the displacement at the <b>top,</b> <b>limited</b> to the frictional resistance offered by the bearings. More precision modeling of bearings has little effect (El-[Tawil 2004]; El-Tawil et al. [2005]). The mass-inertia effects of the superstructure and the pier are built in the algorithm. The impact force is applied eccentrically on wall piers to simulate the actual accident, which may be rarely concentric.|$|R

Sulfuric acid has a higher density than water, which causes the acid formed at the plates during charging to flow downward and collect {{at the bottom of}} the battery.
