5|$|The {{number of}} subplots {{on the show}} grew as more cast members were added. Regular subplots since the 1980s included: Howard and Marina trying to have an affair without Howard's wife finding out (a {{variation}} of the Wainwright-Partridge subplot of the 1970s), <b>the</b> <b>older</b> <b>women</b> meeting for tea and discussing their theories about men and life, Auntie Wainwright trying to sell unwanted merchandise to unsuspecting customers, Smiler {{trying to find a}} woman, Barry trying to better himself (at the insistence of Glenda), and Tom trying to stay {{one step ahead of the}} repo man.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>older</b> <b>women</b> in the {{compound}} or community look after women in their postpartum period and assist with cleaning the baby and massage. Mothers receive postpartum teaching from <b>the</b> <b>older</b> <b>women</b> in the community. In the early postpartum period, there is great emphasis placed on {{the health and well-being}} of the mother and infant. Breastfeeding and postpartum abstinence is mandatory. Both mother and baby receive massages using shea-butter, palm kernel oil, and other oils. During this time, different colored and sized beads are tied around the wrist, waist, and ankles to monitor the growth of the infant. Older women will also keep a brass bowl full of herbs, mixtures, white clay, soft sponge, and charcoal. These items are believed to prevent health problems for the infant and mother.|$|E
25|$|Most, but not all, of the {{participants}} are post-menopausal women and <b>the</b> <b>older</b> <b>women</b> are {{the leaders of the}} most challenging behaviors. Post-menopausal women are of key importance because they are believed not to be vulnerable to witchcraft which may take away their fertility, because they have esteem in their communities, and because they have more time for activities.|$|E

25|$|The Svans, the {{indigenous}} population of Svanetia, are ethnic subgroup of the Georgians. Until the 1930s, Mingrelians and Svans had their own census grouping, but were classified under the broader category of Georgian thereafter. They are Georgian Orthodox Christians, and were Christianized in the 4th-6th centuries. However, some remnants of old paganism have been maintained. Saint George (known as Jgëræg to the locals), a patron saint of Georgia, is the most respected saint. The Svans have retained many of their old traditions, including blood revenge. Their families are small, and the husband {{is the head of}} his family. The Svan really respect <b>the</b> <b>older</b> <b>women</b> in families.|$|E
25|$|In general these {{gathering}}s {{would involve}} older women, usually post-menopausal, gathering together {{in order to}} punish individuals of the community for offense such as being accused of witchcraft, falsely accusing others of witchcraft, physically abusing family members or pregnant women, incest, or committing other offenses. In the precolonial situation, these practices were very local, never extended outside of a single ethnic community, and established clear remedies for the individuals targeted (typically begging for forgiveness from the women, paying a fine, and being ritually cleansed). <b>The</b> <b>older</b> <b>women</b> gather {{at the house of}} the individual being targeted, sing and chant, and behave in ways which are typically against decorum (including stripping, defecating and urinating on the person’s property, sexual harassment and puns directed at passersby, dressing in male attire, etc.) in order to express the severity of the offense. In Kedjom Keku communities, the women would be led by comedians (called vugweys) who would lead the group in making vulgar jokes and puns at those passing by and the individual being shamed. In Kom communities, the women would be led by the oldest women in the community, called na-anlu (mother of anlu) {{for the duration of the}} shaming, who was in charge of organizing the various efforts.|$|E
500|$|For research, Ní Mhaoldhomhnaigh visited {{museums and}} art galleries, and also read Austen's letters and novels.

While she recognised that 1795 [...] "marked the beginning" [...] of the empire waistline trend, Ní Mhaoldhomhnaigh also understood this fashion would have barely been introduced to Austen's circle in the country; rather, the film displayed many costume designs from the early 1790s. She explained, [...] "We wanted to show that transition especially for the women. The look in London {{is very different from}} the look in the countryside. For the country ball the fashion for <b>the</b> <b>older</b> <b>women</b> is more of the old style but for the younger women we show the introduction of the Empire line." ...|$|E

[...] She soon progressed into the Somerset county side, making her debut that same year, aged 13 against Lancashire. [...] She played four of Somerset's five Women's County Championship matches in 2001, and claimed her first wicket for the side in the third of these, trapping Derbyshire's Jane Morris leg before wicket during an economical spell in which she conceded only five runs off four overs.|$|E
500|$|Throughout {{her career}} Wilkinson was an {{opponent}} of imperialism. In February 1927 she attended the Founding Congress of the League Against Imperialism in Brussels, where she met and befriended the Indian nationalist leader Jawaharlal Nehru. In 1927 she {{was elected to the}} Labour Party's National Executive, which gave her a voice in the formulation of party policy. Her advance was noted with approval by Beatrice Webb, who saw in her a future candidate for high office—ahead of more senior Labour women such as Margaret Bondfield and Susan Lawrence. A tireless campaigner for women's equality, she challenged the caricature of voteless younger women as 'flappers'. On 29 March 1928 Wilkinson voted in the House of Commons for the bill that became the Representation of the People (Equal Franchise) Act 1928, granting the vote to all women aged 21 or over. During the debate she said: [...] "e are doing at last a great act of justice to the women of the country... just as we have [...] opened the door to <b>the</b> <b>older</b> <b>women,</b> tonight we are opening it to those who are just entering on the threshold of life and in whose hands is the new life of the future country {{that we are going to}} build".|$|E

2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>older</b> <b>women</b> {{become the}} more {{satisfied}} with their body image {{they are likely to}} become because of the relief of stress from societal pressures.

The biker feels uncomfortable, but does not dare to interrupt. The black man stays quiet for the entire film, until the tram controller arrives: when <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>woman</b> produces her ticket, he grabs and swallows it. When <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>woman</b> accuses <b>the</b> black man of eating her ticket, he coolly shows his valid ticket to the controller; the latter nods at him and arrests <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>woman.</b> <b>The</b> punch line is that both the black man and <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>woman</b> are [...] "Schwarzfahrer" [...] now: the black man who rides a train, is a non-offensive [...] "black rider", while <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>woman</b> now is a real law-breaking Schwarzfahrer (i.e. fare dodger).

2500|$|According {{to media}} reports from late 2014 the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) was selling Yazidi and Christian women as slaves. According to Haleh Esfandiari of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, after ISIL militants have {{captured}} an area [...] "hey usually take <b>the</b> <b>older</b> <b>women</b> to a makeshift slave market {{and try to}} sell them." [...] In mid-October 2014, the UN estimated that 5,000 to 7,000 Yazidi {{women and children were}} abducted by ISIL and sold into slavery. In the digital magazine Dabiq, ISIL claimed religious justification for enslaving Yazidi women whom they consider to be from a heretical sect. ISIL claimed that the Yazidi are idol worshipers and their enslavement is part of the old shariah practice of spoils of war. According to The Wall Street Journal, ISIL appeals to apocalyptic beliefs and claims [...] "justification by a Hadith that they interpret as portraying the revival of slavery as a precursor {{to the end of the}} world".|$|E
2500|$|Quality of {{the eggs}} (oocytes) may also be {{impaired}} as a 1989 study by Scott et al. of 758 in vitro fertilisation (IVF) cycles showed a dramatic decline in implantation rates between high (> 25 mIU/mL) and low day three FSH (<15 mIU/mL) women even though {{the ages of the}} women were equivalent between the two groups (mean age 35 years). However, other studies show no association with elevated FSH levels and genetic quality of embryos after adjusting for age. [...] The decline in quality was age related, not FSH related as the younger women with high day three FSH levels had higher live birth rates than <b>the</b> <b>older</b> <b>women</b> with high FSH. There {{was no significant difference in}} genetic embryo quality between same aged women regardless of FSH levels. [...] A 2008 study concluded that diminished reserve did not affect the quality of oocytes and any reduction in quality in diminished reserve women was age related. One expert concluded: in young women with poor reserve when eggs are obtained they have near normal rates of implantation and pregnancy rates, but they are at high risk for IVF cancellation; if eggs are obtained, pregnancy rates are typically better than in older woman with normal reserve. [...] However, if the FSH level is extremely elevated these conclusions are likely not applicable.|$|E
