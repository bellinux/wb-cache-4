40|$|During {{exercise}} the cardiovascular {{system has to}} warrant substrate supply to working muscle. The main function of <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> in exercise is the transport of O 2 from the lungs to the tissues and the delivery of metabolically produced CO 2 to the lungs for expiration. Hemoglobin also contributes to the blood’s buffering capacity, and ATP and NO release from <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> contributes to vasodilation and improved blood flow to working muscle. These functions require adequate amounts of <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> in circulation. Trained athletes, particularly in endurance sports, have a decreased hematocrit, which is sometimes called sports anemia. This is not anemia in a clinical sense because athletes have in fact an increased <b>total</b> mass of <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> and hemoglobin in circulation relative to sedentary individuals. The slight decrease in hematocrit by training is brought about by an increased plasma volume. The mechanisms that increase <b>total</b> <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> mass by training are not understood fully. Despite stimulated erythropoiesis, exercise can decrease the <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> mass by intravascular hemolysis mainly of senescent <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cells,</b> which is caused by mechanical rupture when <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> pass through capillaries in contracting muscles, and by compression of red cells e. g. in foot soles during running or in hand palms in weightlifters.

Chickens of three different ecotypes (Large Beladi, Betwil and Bare Neck) were reared in the experimental units of the Faculty of Animal Production, University of Khartoum. Sixty chickens (10 males and 10 females) from the three different ecotypes were tested at mature ages ranging from 1. 5 - 2. 0 years to evaluate the haematological parameters and plasma biochemical blood profile. <b>Total</b> <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> count (RBC), packed cell volume (PCV), haemoglobin concentration (Hb), total white blood cells (WBC), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular haemoglobin (MCH) and {{mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration}} (MCHC) were assessed. Haemoglobin concentration ranged from 17. 35 to 18. 7 g/dl, WBC number was 2. 23 - 2. 35 × 106 /mm 3, MCH ranged from 66. 44 to 92. 53 pg and PCV from 39. 95 % to 44. 4 %. They were all not significantly different among the three ecotypes. RBC number (2. 67 - 2. 14 × 106 /mm 3), MCV (169. 75 - 249. 34 fl) and MCH (66. 44 - 92. 53 pg) were significantly (P< 0. 05) different among the three ecotypes. Plasma total protein, albumin, cholesterol, uric acid, calcium, phosphorus, sodium and potassium were also evaluated. The values of plasma total protein, inorganic phosphorus, uric acid, sodium and potassium ranged from 3. 69 to 4. 86 mg/dl, 3. 22 to 3. 74 mg/dl, 4. 38 to 11. 63 mg/dl, 170. 1 to 195. 15 mg/dl and 3. 54 to 4. 04 mg/dl, respectively, they were significantly (P< 0. 05) different among the three ecotypes.

40|$|One {{hundred and}} sixty male broiler chicks were fed at one day of age {{aflatoxin}} (AF) {{at a rate of}} 3. 5 mg/kg alone, or with groups injected with Eimeria tenella sporulated oocysts (40000) at 14 days of age. Adsorbent (Mycofix® plus 3. 0) was incorporated at a rate of 0. 25 % in the above mentioned groups from one day of age till the end of the experiment. The study was conducted to reveal the effect of a aforementioned different diets and treatments on live body weight, feed consumption, feed conversion ratio, blood parameters (<b>total</b> <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cells,</b> hemoglobin, packed cell volume), biochemical profile of serum (alkaline phosphatase and β-carotin), liver weights, bursal and thymus indexes, caecal lesion scores and mortalities. The results indicated that AF was responsible for a significant (P< 0. 05) reduction. in body weigh gain (BWG), feed consumption, and an increase in feed conversion ratio. Afllatoxin was also responsible for reduction in blood parameters, β-Carotin, bursal and thymus indexes. While relative liver weight and alkaline phosphatase level were significantly (P< 0. 05) increased. Groups that fed AF at a rate of 3. 5 mg/kg feed and exposed to sporulated oocysts of Eimeria tenella show a high significant (P< 0. 05) reduction in BWG, feed consumption and an increase in feed conversion ratio. Aflatoxin was also responsible for significant blood parameter, β-carotin, and also a significant (P< 0. 05) increase in caecal lesion scores, mortality, alkaline phosphatase level and relative liver weight, while they showed significant (P< 0. 05) decrease in bursal and thymus indexes in comparison with injected groups with E-tenella sporulated oocysts alone. The study approved that the groups maintained on mycofix plus 3. 0 (0. 25 %) and contaminated with aflatoxin 3. 5 mg/kg, revealed a positive noticeable effects in amelioration on BWG, feed consumption and feed conversion, blood parameter, β-carotin, alkaline phosphatase level, relative liver weight, bursal and thymus indexes in comparison with group fed aflatoxin alone. On the other hand, the groups fed on aflatoxin with mycofix plus 3. 0 (1 %) and injected with Eimeria tenella sporulated oocystes, showed some improvement in BWG, feed consumption, feed conversion, blood parameter, β-carotin, ALKP, bursal and thymus indexes, when compared with those fed AF and injected with doses of sporulated oocysts. It was concluded that the addition of mycofix plus 3. 0 to broiler feeds had an alleviating effects in reducing the severity of coccidiosis during aflatoxicosis...|$|E
40|$|Quantification of intramyocardial {{hemorrhage}} {{was performed}} in 69 pigs submitted to various protocols of coronary artery occlusion and reperfusion. The study groups include 1) permanent occlusion; 2) reperfusion after periods of coronary occlusion of 30, 45, 60, 90, and 120 minutes; 3) reperfusion with diltiazem and with 4) methoxamine after a 60 -minute occlusion period; and 5) permanent reocclusion after a 30 -minute period of reperfusion. Red <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> counts were directly assessed by visual examination of histologic slices of myocardium and in a subgroup of animals by counts of <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> labeled with 99 m-technetium pertechnetate. Hemorrhage occurs in infarcts reperfused after a duration of 45 minutes or more of coronary occlusion and {{after a period of}} reperfusion maintained for at least 30 minutes. Red <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> counts were maximal in the mid portions of transmural sections of the infarcts, with decreasing values toward epicardium and endocardium.
