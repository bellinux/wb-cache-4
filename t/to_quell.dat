Such an approach would require mutual respect and understanding between labor and management.|$|E

In addition, the Song was greatly disadvantaged by the fact their neighbors had taken advantage of the era of chaos following the collapse of the Tang to advance into Northern China unimpeded. The Song also lost the horse-producing regions which made their cavalry extremely inferior.|$|R
