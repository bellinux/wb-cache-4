25|$|Of {{currently}} existing independent countries, New Zealand was {{the first}} to acknowledge women's right to vote in 1893 when it was a self-governing British colony. Unrestricted women's suffrage in terms of voting rights (women were not initially permitted to stand for election) was adopted in New Zealand in 1893. Following a successful movement led by Kate Sheppard, the women's suffrage bill was adopted weeks before the general election of that year. The women of the British protectorate of Cook Islands obtained the same right soon after and beat New Zealand's women <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>polls</b> <b>in</b> 1893.|$|E
25|$|Nationwide, Ivo Josipović {{achieved}} 1,339,385 votes, or 60.26%, while Milan Bandić won 883,222 votes, or 39.74%. Most polls {{before the}} election were showing Josipović with a hefty double-digit lead, but never as much as 20 percentage points as he achieved during the election. The {{difference between the two}} candidates came as a surprise to many pundits and analysts for two reasons: the polls usually favor the more liberal candidate since left-leaning voters tend to participate in opinion polls more than conservative voters; and the fact that most polls {{before the election}} didn't include the votes from the citizens living abroad, which was expected to be a strong boost for Bandić come Election Day. Nevertheless, the final result is similar to the result of the last several polls when only the certain voters were taken into account, which may indicate that few undecided voters actually went <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>polls</b> <b>in</b> the second round.|$|E

2500|$|Nevertheless, the {{campaign}} of 1856 was waged almost exclusively on the slavery issue—pitted as a struggle between democracy and aristocracy—focusing {{on the question of}} Kansas. The Republicans condemned the Kansas–Nebraska Act and the expansion of slavery, but they advanced a program of internal improvements combining the idealism of anti-slavery with the economic aspirations of the North. The new party rapidly developed a powerful partisan culture, and energetic activists drove voters <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>polls</b> <b>in</b> unprecedented numbers. People reacted with fervor. Young Republicans organized the [...] "Wide Awake" [...] clubs and chanted [...] "Free Soil, Free Labor, Free Men, Frémont!"

2500|$|Voters went <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>polls</b> <b>in</b> 1982 as {{the economy}} started slipping, with falling prices for wheat, oil, potash and uranium. The NDP was routed after a dozen years in power, {{dropping}} from 45 seats to 9 while the Progressive Conservative Party took all the other 55 seats. The new premier was 37-year-old economist Grant Devine (1944– [...] ), who won with a simple populist message: the people should share in {{the wealth of the}} province rather than watch it contribute to the expansion of the 24 Crown corporations. The new government ended the 20% tax on gasoline and lower interest rates on mortgages. It was reelected in 1986 and began selling off crown corporations. The government said the companies would operate more profitably as private businesses. The opposition NDP warned that the sales would result in loss of control over the province's key economic sectors.|$|E

The trust confided to you will be one of watchfulness and labor; but we hope the glory of having contributed to the overthrow of the corrupt powers that now control our beloved country will be a sufficient reward for the time and labor you will devote to it. Our Whig brethren throughout the Union have met in convention, and after due deliberation and mutual concessions have elected candidates for the Presidency and Vice-Presidency not only worthy of our cause, but worthy of the support of every true patriot who would have our country redeemed, and her institutions honestly and faithfully administered. To overthrow the trained bands that are opposed to us whose salaried officers are ever on the watch, and whose misguided followers are ever ready to obey their smallest commands, every Whig must not only know his duty, but must firmly resolve, whatever of time and labor it may cost, boldly and faithfully to do it. Our intention is to organize the whole State, so that every Whig can be brought <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>polls</b> <b>in</b> the coming Presidential contest. We cannot do this, however, without your co-operation; and as we do our duty, so we shall expect you to do yours.
