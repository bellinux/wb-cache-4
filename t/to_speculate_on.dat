5|$|Corrupt {{politicians}} are already beginning <b>to</b> <b>speculate</b> <b>on</b> them as possible capital for their schemes and {{to fill their}} poor heads {{with all sorts of}} vagaries. Florida is the State into which they have, more than anywhere else, been pouring. Emigration is positively and decidedly setting that way; but as yet it is mere worldly emigration, with the hope of making money, nothing more.|$|E
5|$|In November 2008, the {{government}} of Zimbabwe spent US$7.3 million donated by the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. A representative of the organisation declined <b>to</b> <b>speculate</b> <b>on</b> how the money was spent, {{except that it was}} not for the intended purpose, and {{the government}} has failed to honour requests to return the money.|$|E
5|$|The Fasti Ostienses, the Ostian Calendar, {{records that}} {{the same day the}} Senate proclaimed Marcus Cocceius Nerva emperor. Despite his {{political}} experience, this was a remarkable choice. Nerva was old and childless, and had spent much of his career out of the public light, prompting both ancient and modern authors <b>to</b> <b>speculate</b> <b>on</b> his involvement in Domitian's assassination.|$|E
5000|$|Because {{the film}} in fact ends with Bobby {{successfully}} evading his stepfather forever, viewers (including Ebert himself) have taken <b>to</b> <b>speculating</b> <b>on</b> the [...] "true" [...] ending, assuming that the one presented {{was a case of}} an unreliable narrator.|$|R

5|$|American anime {{newspaper}} Anime News Network {{reported on}} August 31, 2015 that the production studio Production I.G may be planning {{a remake of}} the popular series after announcing their purchase of the rights to FLCL from production company Gainax. This led many <b>to</b> <b>speculate</b> <b>on</b> the potential of a remake or possible continuation of the series. The IGN web series Anime Club discussed the potential of a remake {{with most of the}} participants expressing reservations towards the idea comparing it to Rebuild of Evangelion and Ghost in the Shell 2.0.|$|E
5|$|Feeling {{uncomfortable with}} their arrangement, Rowe asked Jackson for a divorce, which he granted on October 8, 1999. Rowe {{received}} around $10million in a settlement, which started with an immediate payment of $1.5million. With the divorce, Rowe gave Jackson full custody rights to her children. At the time, both Rowe and Jackson requested privacy {{and asked the}} public not <b>to</b> <b>speculate</b> <b>on</b> {{the reasons for their}} divorce. They concluded that despite coming to the end of married life, they would continue to remain friends.|$|E
5|$|On 18 September, 96, Domitian {{was assassinated}} in a palace {{conspiracy}} organised by court officials. The Fasti Ostienses, the Ostian Calendar, records that {{the same day the}} Senate proclaimed Marcus Cocceius Nerva emperor. Despite his political experience, this was a remarkable choice. Nerva was old and childless, and had spent much of his career out of the public light, prompting both ancient and modern authors <b>to</b> <b>speculate</b> <b>on</b> his involvement in Domitian's assassination.|$|E
50|$|James Bellamy {{returns from}} America with renewed enthusiasm {{for life and}} hope for his future. He has taken <b>to</b> <b>speculating</b> <b>on</b> the New York Stock Exchange and is {{making a lot of}} money. After bestowing lavish gifts on Virginia and Georgina, James proposes to pay for Georgina's wedding and even {{suggests}} moving to a bigger house {{as a direct result of}} his increasing wealth. He even manages to persuade Rose to invest her entire inheritance, from the estate of her deceased fiance Gregory, but sadly this is just before the Wall Street Crash of 1929. James loses everything, as does Rose.|$|R
50|$|From {{his early}} {{interest}} in Greek and Latin, he soon proceeded to master Hebrew, Chaldaic, Arabic and other oriental languages. In 1780 he also prepared an interesting set of lectures on Natural Philosophy covering Newtonian astronomy and earth science, {{in which he}} <b>speculated</b> <b>on</b> the possibility of multiple peopled worlds and {{the origin of the}} Indians. These lectures seem to have stimulated his students Solomon Spaulding and Ethan Smith <b>to</b> further <b>speculate</b> <b>on</b> the later subject.|$|R
6000|$|I {{saw many}} {{extraordinary}} cases in this Glasgow Refuge, {{some of whom}} had come there through sheer misfortune. One had been a medical man who, unfortunately, was left money and took <b>to</b> <b>speculating</b> <b>on</b> the Stock Exchange. He was a very large holder of shares in a South African mine, which he bought at 1s. 6d. These shares now stand at £7; but, unhappily for him, his brokers dissolved partnership, and neither of them would carry over his account. So it was closed down just at the wrong time, with the result that he lost everything, and finally came to the streets. He never drank or did anything wrong; it was, as he said, 'simply a matter of sheer bad luck.' ...|$|R
5|$|During {{a welcome}} dinner at Barton Park, Sir John {{introduces}} the Dashwoods to his wife, Lady Middleton (Rosanna Lavelle); her mother, Mrs. Jennings (Linda Bassett); {{and their family}} friend, Colonel Brandon (David Morrissey). Brandon instantly {{falls in love with}} Marianne, but she believes he is too old for her. While out walking with Margaret, Marianne falls and twists her ankle. She is rescued by a young man, who carries her back to the cottage. He introduces himself as John Willoughby (Dominic Cooper), and states that he will return to check on Marianne the following day. Brandon also comes to visit, but upon seeing Willoughby, he quickly departs. Willoughby and Marianne grow close through their mutual love of poetry, and he later takes a lock of her hair. Mrs. Dashwood and Elinor begin <b>to</b> <b>speculate</b> <b>on</b> whether they have become secretly engaged.|$|E
5|$|In 1806 Jennings {{headed west}} to Jeffersonville in the Indiana Territory, but stayed only briefly. He moved to Vincennes, {{the capital of}} the Indiana Territory, in early 1807 to open his own law {{practice}} and was admitted to the bar in April. Jennings had difficulty earning an income as a lawyer, finding there were too few clients in the territory to keep him busy. In July 1807 Nathaniel Ewing, the federal land receiver at Vincennes and a friend from Pennsylvania, invited Jennings to take a job as assistant to John Badollet, the registrar at the federal land office in Vincennes. Along with Badollet, Jennings engaged in land speculation. He obtained significant land holdings and made substantial profits. In 1807 Jennings became an assistant to the clerk of the territorial legislature and continued <b>to</b> <b>speculate</b> <b>on</b> the sale of public lands.|$|E
5|$|The impenetrable Venusian {{cloud cover}} gave science fiction writers free rein <b>to</b> <b>speculate</b> <b>on</b> {{conditions}} at its surface; {{all the more}} so when early observations showed that not only was it similar in size to Earth, it possessed a substantial atmosphere. Closer to the Sun than Earth, the planet was frequently depicted as warmer, but still habitable by humans. The genre reached its peak between the 1930s and 1950s, at a time when science had revealed some aspects of Venus, but not yet the harsh reality of its surface conditions. Findings from the first missions to Venus showed the reality to be quite different, and brought this particular genre to an end. As scientific knowledge of Venus advanced, so science fiction authors tried to keep pace, particularly by conjecturing human attempts to terraform Venus.|$|E

60|$|An hour later, Cuthfert put a pan {{of bread}} into the oven, and fell <b>to</b> <b>speculating</b> <b>on</b> what the {{surgeons}} could do with his feet when he got back. Home did not seem so very far away now. Weatherbee was rummaging in the cache. Of a sudden, he raised a whirlwind of blasphemy, which in turn ceased with startling abruptness. The other man had robbed his sugar-sack. Still, things might have happened differently, had not the two dead men come {{out from under the}} stones and hushed the hot words in his throat. They led him quite gently from the cache, which he forgot to close. That consummation was reached; that something they had whispered to him in his dreams was about to happen. They guided him gently, very gently, to the woodpile, where they put the axe in his hands.|$|R
50|$|Hoe {{lived with}} his wife, Mary, and {{children}} on a vast 53 acre estate, called Brightside, in the Morrisania/Hunt's Point section of the Bronx. His family sold the estate in 1904 <b>to</b> developers <b>speculating</b> <b>on</b> the subway extension into the Bronx. Printers Park {{is located at the}} former site of his mansion, at the corner on Aldus Street and Hoe Avenue in the Bronx. The newly reconstructed park re-opened in April 2011, equipped with a play structure inspired by the rotary printing press.|$|R
5|$|The {{receiver}} {{offered the}} barn to Hillingdon Council and English Heritage for £1, but both refused the offer. Instead, a Gibraltar-based company calling itself Harmondsworth Barn Ltd bought the barn. The company {{had no other}} assets and {{it was reported that}} it was seeking <b>to</b> <b>speculate</b> <b>on</b> obtaining compensation from a proposed expansion of Heathrow Airport. Such compensation would be paid should the land be required and the property demolished, although the barn fell just slightly outside the area required for a new runway. The new owners made no effort to maintain the barn, which fell into disrepair and was closed to the public apart from an annual one-day opening in conjunction with the Open House Weekend each September.|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} to allowing investors to achieve high distribution returns, especially {{during periods of}} low interest rates, royalty trusts allow investors <b>to</b> <b>speculate</b> directly <b>on</b> commodities such as gas, oil, or iron ore without having to buy futures contracts, or use the other investment vehicles traditionally associated with commodities—since the trusts trade like stocks. During times when a commodity price is rising, the share value {{as well as the}} dividend return of a trust engaging in production of that commodity will rise as well.|$|R
50|$|Liar's Poker: The Great Powers, Yugoslavia and the Wars of the Future {{is a book}} by Michel Collon. It was {{originally}} written in French, and was later translated <b>to</b> English. It <b>speculates</b> <b>on</b> the long-term goals of the United States and other great powers, and accuses {{the government and the}} media of conducting a campaign of organised disinformation.|$|R
5000|$|It {{can also}} be thought to exist [...] "inside the heads" [...] of the {{characters}} present. It is a subjective world, taking and manipulating history, picking apart some events and mashing others together to better compare them. The characters are all plagued by some form of guilt or another, particularly {{in reference to the}} atomic bomb, and they are trapped in this world, doomed <b>to</b> forever <b>speculate</b> <b>on</b> that evening in Copenhagen in 1941 to determine how the world might have been changed. These are all traits of the artistic style known as Expressionism.|$|R
25|$|Due to the {{increasing}} violence the United Kingdom gradually started to backtrack from the original idea of a Jewish state and <b>to</b> <b>speculate</b> <b>on</b> a binational solution or an Arab state {{that would have a}} Jewish minority.|$|E
25|$|The Quinn Group {{took action}} {{to counter the}} moves by the Financial Regulator {{including}} the mobilisation of its employees into street protests., The Group furthermore rejected press speculation that the Group needs €700m of financing. Instead the Group estimates that a cash injection of between €100m and €150m is required. refusing <b>to</b> <b>speculate</b> <b>on</b> {{the need for a}} €550 million payment to bondholders, it noted that a re-financing, if it occurred, would not necessarily increase the overall debts of the Group.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the initial}} plans, collectivization, {{accompanied}} by the bad harvest of 19321933, did {{not live up to}} expectations. Between 1929 and 1932 there was a massive fall in agricultural production resulting in famine in the countryside. Stalin and the CPSU blamed the prosperous peasants, referred to as 'kulaks' (Russian: fist), who were organizing resistance to collectivization. Allegedly, many kulaks had been hoarding grain in order <b>to</b> <b>speculate</b> <b>on</b> higher prices, thereby sabotaging grain collection. Stalin resolved to eliminate them as a class.|$|E
30|$|The method {{originates}} from a {{gas rate}} equation {{essential for the}} rigorous proof of λ and β rescaling. Therefore, it is reasonable <b>to</b> <b>speculate,</b> based <b>on</b> the results discussed in the preceding section, that dual-porosity systems should satisfy a similar equation at the second decline stage, in which case λ̅_m would replace λ̅. In such a case, the same steps for G i prediction for a single-porosity system utilizing Eq.  31 {{would need to be}} taken except for replacing λ̅ with λ̅_m. Steps are detailed in Zhang and Ayala (2014 b).|$|R
50|$|H.R. 992 {{would allow}} certain {{financial}} firms {{to retain their}} financial portfolios containing swaps while remaining eligible for assistance from the Federal Reserve and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). A swap is a contract between two parties to exchange payments based {{on the price of}} an underlying asset or change in interest, exchange, or other reference rate. Swaps can be used to hedge or mitigate certain risks associated with a firm’s traditional activities, such as interest rate risk, or <b>to</b> <b>speculate</b> based <b>on</b> expected changes in prices and rates.|$|R
50|$|The Canadian Crude Oil Index (CCI) {{serves as}} a {{benchmark}} for oil produced in Canada. It allows investors to track the price, risk and volatility of the Canadian commodity. The CCI was launched by Auspice Capital Advisors in 2014. The Index moved from a day end posting to live in January 2016. The CCI {{can be used to}} identify opportunities <b>to</b> <b>speculate</b> outright <b>on</b> the price of Canadian crude oil or in conjunction with West Texas Intermediate (WTI) to put on a spread trade which could represent the differential between the two.|$|R
25|$|For {{this video}} work, Andreyev uses audio and visual {{representations}} of her canine companion Tom <b>to</b> <b>speculate</b> <b>on</b> his subjective and emotional experience traveling {{in a car}} by examining {{the notion that a}} canine's sense of smell is a locus for heightened sensitivity and empirical intelligence. The visuals refer to a psychedelic experience, metaphorically representing Tom's experience. The visuals are accompanied by a soundscape constructed from studio recordings of Tom's voice and car engine sounds to create connotative rhythmic and harmonic modes.|$|E
25|$|Geoists (Georgists and geolibertarians) {{state that}} {{taxation}} should primarily collect economic rent, {{in particular the}} value of land, for both reasons of economic efficiency as well as morality. The efficiency of using economic rent for taxation is (as economists agree) {{due to the fact}} that such taxation cannot be passed on and does not create any dead-weight loss, and that it removes the incentive <b>to</b> <b>speculate</b> <b>on</b> land. Its morality is based on the Geoist premise that private property is justified for products of labour but not for land and natural resources.|$|E
25|$|Loss of steamboats by collision, fire, or river {{obstacles}} (snags) {{was well}} understood, but boiler explosions seemed arbitrary and mysterious. Immediately {{after the loss}} of the Lucy Walker, many newspapers began <b>to</b> <b>speculate</b> <b>on</b> the cause or causes of the explosion. One paper opined that a faulty force pump and low water level in the boiler was the cause. Another newspaper reported qualms about reckless behavior of the boat's officers or shoddy construction of the boilers. Later there was speculation that steamboat racing might have contributed to the disaster.|$|E
5000|$|The {{next day}} in the barber shop, Floyd and Goober have heard of Helen's trip <b>to</b> Richmond and <b>speculate</b> <b>on</b> her future {{financial}} prospects as a well paid authoress.

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a {{statistic}} to measure investor sentiment. It is a usual phenomenon that an asymmetric volatility (referred {{to as the}} leverage effect) is observed in financial time series and is more sensitive to bad news rather than good news. In a bubble state, investors tend <b>to</b> continuously <b>speculate</b> <b>on</b> financial instruments because of optimism about the future; subsequently, prices tend to abnormally increase for a long time. Estimators of the transformation parameter and the skewness based on Yeo-Johnson transformed GARCH models are employed to check whether a bubble or abnormality exist. W...|$|R
40|$|The {{description}} of a digital ecosystem as a “loosely coupled, demand-driven, domain clustered, agent-based, self organised, collaborative environment where agents form temporary coalitions for a specific purpose or goal, and each is proactive and responsive for its own benefit” has intriguing similarities with the definition of an ecosystem in ecology. Perhaps the similarities suggest that {{a deeper understanding of}} ecology may benefit the further development of ICT, and any differences may therefore represent cautionary tales. In this presentation, I describe characteristics of some ecological systems at several levels-from species <b>to</b> ecosystem-and <b>speculate</b> <b>on</b> the potential of these examples to catalyse innovation in ICT...|$|R
