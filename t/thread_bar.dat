In the case of the linearised stability and if the force is close to the elastic critical load, the natural frequency limits to zero. Taking into account the nonlinear theory and the real boundary conditions and for the force near the elastic critical load, the natural frequency is infinitesimal value. This phenomenon has been proved by an experiment. The special new equipment has been used for the experimental verification.

40|$|Abstract – Modern {{building}} technologies (for example {{prestressed concrete}} to produce beams, floors, bridges, or installation, testing and monitoring of ground anchors) {{require the use}} of accurate force machines (hydraulic jacks). One component of successful building works is a correct and accurate calibration procedure of hydraulic jack for tensioning cables or anchors. This article analyzes two different calibration methods: By means of hollow load cell and <b>thread</b> <b>bar</b> and calibration in the closed frame. We analyze these methods using different accessories and their influence on the uncertainty of calibration results. As {{a very important part of}} calibration procedure is a correct choice of the calibration mathematical model (interpolation curve force-hydraulic pressure and hydraulic pressureforce), there is a need to use a special software. Such is the developed software FORCE- 401 -S which permits to communicate the measurement line “load cell-amplifiercomputer”; to choose the correct interpolation polynom; enable to compute the errors and uncertainty values and build the table of calibration results. The calibration procedure is performed according to the standard ISO 7500 - 1 "Verification of static uniaxial testing machines- Part 1 : Tension/compression testing machines- Verification and calibration of the forcemeasuring system". We recommend to widen the definitions of this standard and to include calibration of non-force units scaled devices (as an example pressure gauges) ...|$|E

The study was motivated by the needs of the conservation project in progress on the Parthenon Temple of the Acropolis of Athens. A realistic numerical model was created taking into account the exact geometry of the <b>threaded</b> <b>bars</b> as well as the exact mechanical properties of the materials involved. The architrave was considered as a prismatic beam of rectangular cross section, centrally fractured and restored with one <b>threaded</b> titanium <b>bar.</b> The bar was inserted in a hole of slightly greater diameter drilled in the member and filled with suitable cementitious material. In this way, a sequence of three materials appears (marble-cement-titanium) giving birth to two interfaces (marble-cement and cement-titanium).

5000|$|Prestressed {{concrete}} {{is a form}} {{of concrete}} used in construction which is [...] "pre-stressed" [...] by being placed under compression prior to supporting any loads beyond its own dead weight. [...] This compression is produced by the tensioning of high-strength [...] "tendons" [...] located within or adjacent to the concrete volume, and is done to improve the performance of the concrete in service. Tendons may consist of single wires, multi-wire strands or <b>threaded</b> <b>bars,</b> and are most commonly made from high-tensile steels, carbon fibre or aramid fibre. The essence of prestressed concrete is that once the initial compression has been applied, the resulting material has the characteristics of high-strength concrete when subject to any subsequent compression forces, and of ductile high-strength steel when subject to tension forces. This can result in improved structural capacity and/or serviceability compared to conventionally reinforced concrete in many situations.|$|R
