While changing his clothes, Mulder receives a <b>telephone</b> <b>call</b> from Smoodge, who explains that the military has surveyed {{the wreckage of the}} craft from the night before, finding one of the human pilots merged into a rock but still alive. Another soldier, Captain Robert McDonough, had switched bodies with an elderly Hopi woman, as evident from McDonough's aberrant behavior.|$|E

5|$|The log {{discusses}} a <b>telephone</b> <b>call</b> made at 3:26am on 7 August to Chelmsford police station. According to the prosecution, {{this is the}} <b>telephone</b> <b>call</b> {{known to}} have been made by Bamber, the same call that is entered in the event log. There was only one call that night to the police station about the shooting, the prosecution says, and it was made by Bamber at or just before 3:26am. Bamber's defence team argues otherwise. They say that the radio log is not a duplicate log of Bamber's call, but that it shows Nevill also telephoned the police that night.|$|E

5|$|Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) and {{her mother}} visit her brother Bill and his {{pregnant}} wife Tara around Christmas time. Scully answers the phone, and {{the person on the}} other line, who sounds just like her dead sister Melissa, tells her that someone needs her help. Scully traces the call to a nearby home in San Diego where a group of cops are investigating the suicide of a woman, Roberta Sim. The lead detective, Kresge, tells Scully that it was impossible for Roberta to have dialed, as she died before the <b>telephone</b> <b>call</b> was made. That night after dinner Scully reveals to her mother that due to her abduction and cancer she is unable to bear children. Scully flashes back to when as a child, she hid her pet rabbit from her brother in a lunchbox, only for it to suffocate and die. Scully receives another <b>telephone</b> <b>call</b> from the same person on her cell phone, which was once again made from the Sim home. Roberta's husband, Marshall, is meeting with two dark-suited men inside his house and has no desire to listen to and help Scully figure out what is going on.|$|E

40|$|Telephone triage is an {{essential}} component of today’s oncology practice, and it has grown in importance as the care of patients with cancer has transitioned from the inpatient to the outpatient setting in the last 20 years. Just as the face-to-face care of cancer patients in the office and outpatient setting has become increasingly complex, so too has the management of <b>telephone</b> <b>calls</b> from patients with cancer. Oncology practices today must have systems in place to expedite the telephone triage process and ensure that patients receive timely and appropriate responses to their <b>telephone</b> <b>calls.</b> In this issue of Journal of Oncology Practice, Flannery et al 1 report an interesting single-site study of <b>telephone</b> <b>calls</b> in ambulatory oncology.
