Shows featured a variety of sexual messages, including characters <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>when</b> they wanted to have sex {{and how to use}} sex to keep a relationship alive. Some researchers believe that adolescents can use these messages as well as the sexual actions they see on TV in their own sexual lives.|$|E
25|$|There is no {{evidence}} that I can find in Being and Event that the author really understands what he is <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>when</b> he invokes (as he constantly does) Georg Cantor's theory of transfinite cardinals, the axioms of set theory, Gödel's incompleteness proof or Paul Cohen's proof of the independence of the continuum hypothesis. When these things appear in Badiou's texts it is always allusively, with fragments of symbolism detached from the context that endows them with sense, and often with free variables and bound variables colliding randomly. No proof is clearly stated or examined, and the jargon of set theory is waved like a magician's wand, to give authority to bursts of all but unintelligible metaphysics.|$|E

In an interview, Bray said, [...] "She [...] was very much in love. It was obvious if she's in love she'll write love songs. If she's not in love she definitely won't be writing love songs." [...] In 2015, Madonna said that [...] "True Blue" [...] is [...] "a song about true love. I didn't know what I was <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>when</b> I wrote it." ...|$|E

Stack described the episode as a [...] "monumental television event,"; however, he also expressed his lingering sense of [...] "slight disappointment." [...] While he enjoyed the episode overall, Stack wrote that Spears' songs felt forced into the storyline, and that the episode was neither as iconic nor as exhilarating as Glee Madonna tribute. The Parents Television Council slammed the episode, accusing the presentation of Spears as a [...] "symbol of empowerment and self-esteem" [...] problematic, observing that the young audience [...] "basically witnessed an endorsement of narcotics abuse, public masturbation, and school-sanctioned burlesque." ...|$|E

He portrayed an emergency physician applying for a medical fellowship. He commented on the inherent difficulties in portraying a physician on television: [...] "Playing a doctor is a strange experience. Pretending you know what you're <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>when</b> you don't is very bizarre but there are advisers on set who are fantastic at taking you through procedures and giving you the confidence to stand there and look like you know what you're doing."

2500|$|BevMo! employs Wilfred Wong, {{an expert}} taster and wine {{competition}} judge, who assigns bottles a wine rating {{based on his}} own version of Robert M. Parker, Jr.'s 50–100-point system. Wong, a veteran industry analyst and wine writer who has written regular columns for Vineyard & Winery Management magazine and Beverage Industry News, tastes some 8,000 bottles a year for BevMo!, and may taste 40 wines a day. A San Francisco native and resident who grew up working in his family's upscale grocery store in the Haight-Ashbury neighborhood, Wong was hired to work for BevMo! in 1995, when they had six stores. He told a New York Times reporter in 2006 that it can be tricky working as a wine critic inside a large retail chain that sells wine—there can be conflicts between appropriate scoring for a wine and business plans for that wine. He reported that he has, upon occasion, been encouraged by company management to give a high score to a wine, especially one that did not receive a high rating from other reviewers, or one that was purchased by BevMo! at a good price. Wong said, [...] "we have fights all the time." [...] Wong made assurances that he does not treat a wine to a good score based on company founders' wishes. Executive VP David Richards agrees: [...] "If we were to impinge on Wilfred's credibility, it would be very bad for our brand." [...] Wong reports only to Richards, to keep him from being influenced by wine sellers or BevMo!'s own buyers. Richards said, [...] "we have to give him independence within the organization." [...] Alder Yarrow, publisher of the wine blog Vinography.com, said of Wong, [...] "he is not a shill... He knows what he is <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>when</b> it comes to wine." [...] Professor Emeritus Robert Smiley, Director of Wine Studies, Graduate School of Management, University of California, Davis, said about Wong's ratings: [...] "I {{think this is a good}} innovation and he's helpful to the consumer. It brings more people to BevMo and it probably moves them up in price because typically, the higher-price wines get the better scores." [...] Smiley said that shoppers were too smart to be fooled: [...] "If Wilfred and BevMo fix the ratings, people will catch on and go elsewhere." ...|$|E

6000|$|A {{considerable}} correspondence is {{here from}} the learned Bishop Stubbs (1888) {{on the character of}} Bishop Fisher of Rochester, the fellow-sufferer of More; on the Convocation Act of 1531 and the other Convocation Acts of Elizabeth; on Father Walsh’s letters, and other matters of the sixteenth century. In fact, it is safe to assume that Mr. Gladstone has always some ecclesiastical, historical, theological controversy running alongside of the political and party business of the day. Nobody that ever lived tried to ride so many horses abreast. Another prelate puts a point that is worth remembering by every English school of foreign policy. “In 1879,” writes Bishop Creighton (Feb. 15, 1887), “when foreign affairs were much before the public, I suggested to a publisher a series of books dealing quite shortly and clearly with the political history and constitution of the chief states of Europe from 1815. I designed them for popular instruction, thinking it of great importance that people in general should know what they were <b>talking</b> <b>about,</b> <b>when</b> they spoke of France or Russia.... The result of my attempt was to convince me that our ignorance of the last sixty years is colossal.” ...|$|E
