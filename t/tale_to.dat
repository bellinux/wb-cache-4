5|$|Today, modern re-tellings of the Lalaurie legend {{often use}} deLavigne and Smith's {{versions}} of the <b>tale</b> <b>to</b> found claims of explicit tortures, and to place the number of slaves who died under Lalaurie's care at {{as many as one}} hundred.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the great}} success of the Troilus, the love story was popular as a free {{standing}} <b>tale</b> <b>to</b> be retold by English-language writers throughout the 15th and 16th centuries and into the 17th century. The theme was treated either seriously or in burlesque. For many authors, true Troilus, false Cresseid and pandering Pandarus became ideal types eventually {{to be referred to}} together as such in Shakespeare.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his service}} in the Mexican–American War, Washington joined the Charles Town Mining Company and {{traveled}} to California in 1849 as a Forty-niner in the California Gold Rush with his brother Benjamin Franklin Washington; however, there are no existing records of Washington finding gold during his pursuit. While in California, Washington authored the novel, A <b>Tale</b> <b>to</b> be Told Some Fifty Years Hence, {{which was published in}} 1853.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} full (and primary religious) {{account of}} Nandanar's life {{is found in}} the Tamil Periya Puranam by Sekkizhar (12th century), which is a hagiography of the 63 Nayanars, but it was the Nandanar Charitram by the Tamil poet Gopalakrishna Bharati (1810–1896) brought Nandanar's <b>tale</b> <b>to</b> public attention. The Nandanar Charitam (printed in 1861), the magnum opus of Bharati, added new elements to Sekkizhar's tale. Though it is unknown when he lived exactly, generally he is dated to 7th or 8th century CE.|$|E
5|$|After Peach's castle is {{sent back}} to the ground and Mario defeats Bowser, he recounts his <b>tale</b> <b>to</b> Luigi, who had {{remained}} at home while Mario went on the adventure. Peach throws a huge party to honor Mario and his allies for saving the entire kingdom, which is then followed by a parade during the credits. In the end, Mario and Peach exit their parade float and gaze up the sky, seeing fireworks. This part will not end until the player turns off the console. When restarted, the file will restart from the last save.|$|E
5|$|Following the Mexican–American War, Washington {{traveled}} to California in 1849 as a Forty-niner in the California Gold Rush and authored the novel, A <b>Tale</b> <b>to</b> be Told Some Fifty Years Hence. Washington then relocated east to Missouri in the 1850s, where he remained {{for a few}} years and fought as a Border Ruffian during the Bleeding Kansas confrontations over slavery along the border between Kansas Territory and Missouri. While under the command of Captain Henry Clay Pate, Washington was present at the June 1856 Free-Stater attack known as Battle of Black Jack, where he sustained minor injuries. Washington died by drowning after falling overboard from a steamboat on the Missouri River in September 1856. His family's descendants claim Washington was murdered by Jayhawkers.|$|E

5|$|M. Daphne Kutzer, Professor of English at the State University of New York at Plattsburgh {{and author}} of Beatrix Potter: Writing in Code (2003), detects some {{similarities}} to The Tale of Squirrel Nutkin (1903). Both tales have touches of the pourquoi story in their explanations of why squirrels collect nuts, and both incorporate rhymes and riddles in their narratives. However, there is a crucial difference that diminishes the artistry of Timmy Tiptoes: the rhymes and riddles in Squirrel Nutkin shed light on Nutkin's character and create a guessing game for the reader while those in Timmy Tiptoes are bland devices that simply move the characters to reunions with their wives and the <b>tale</b> <b>to</b> its conclusion.|$|E
5|$|On October20, 1944, General Douglas MacArthur's forces {{landed on}} Leyte, {{paving the way}} for the liberation of the Philippines. Several months later, as the Americans {{consolidated}} their forces to prepare for the main invasion of Luzon, nearly 150Americans were executed by their Japanese captors on December14, 1944 at the Puerto Princesa Prison Camp on the island of Palawan. These Americans were herded into air-raid shelters, sealed in, doused with gasoline, and burned alive. One of the survivors, PFC Eugene Nielsen, recounted his <b>tale</b> <b>to</b> U.S. Army Intelligence on January7, 1945. Two days later, MacArthur's forces landed on Luzon and began a rapid advance towards the capital, Manila.|$|E
5|$|The Ramayana further adds: Kabandha {{spent his}} days near the hermitage of the sage Matanga in the Krauncha forest. There, he spent his time scaring sages. Once, Kabandha {{attacked}} the sage Stulashira, who cursed him to remain in his hideous form for eternity. Upon Kabandha's pleading, the sage reduced his curse and said that Kabandha would be freed of his form, once Rama and Lakshmana sever his arms. So Kabandha waited in that forest for Rama's arrival. Growse suspected the <b>tale</b> <b>to</b> be a later interpolation arguing {{that it does not}} appear in all versions/translations of the original Ramayana.|$|E

5|$|Shakespeare {{is known}} for {{borrowing}} plots and characters from other stories, but the source of A Midsummer Night's Dream has proved difficult to trace. There is no clear parallel to its plot {{in the literature of}} his time. However, many of its characters' names and relationships are borrowed from Chaucer's Canterbury Tales and Philostrate is no exception. His name is the pseudonym adopted by Arcite upon covertly returning to Athens in The Knight's <b>Tale</b> <b>to</b> work for Theseus. (A Knight's Tale was dramatised nearly twenty years later by Shakespeare and Fletcher as The Two Noble Kinsmen.) Chaucer himself took the name Philostrate from Boccaccio's poem Il Filostrato, a story about Troilus and Criseyde. Because Chaucer's Arcite adopts this identity to become a servant at Theseus' court, {{it is possible that the}} Midsummer Night's Dream character is meant to be the same person in a continuation of the story. However, the two characters have little else in common. Another candidate for the source of Philostrate's character is Philostratus the Elder, the author of Comus, a play which has similarities to Midsummer Night's Dream.|$|E
5|$|After {{navigating}} {{the palace of}} Azad and reaching the hourglass of the Sands in the Tower of Dawn, the Prince hesitates when following Farah's instructions on containing the Sands, unsure of whether to trust her. The Vizier ambushes them and they barely escape with the Dagger, ending up in a tomb beneath the city. Eventually finding shelter in a mysterious bathhouse, the two rest and consummate their growing feelings for each other. When the Prince wakes up back in the palace, Farah has gone with the Dagger, leaving him her amulet. He follows her and only just manages to catch her as she is driven over a ledge above the hourglass by monsters. To save the Prince, Farah allows herself to fall to her death. As the Prince mourns over her, the Vizier offers him eternal life {{in exchange for the}} Dagger. The Prince refuses and stabs the hourglass with the Dagger. Time rewinds to before the attack on the Maharaja's palace, and the Prince, still in possession of the Dagger and his memories, runs ahead to warn Farah of the Vizier's treachery. It is now revealed that the Prince has been recounting his <b>tale</b> <b>to</b> Farah, and as he finishes, the Vizier enters to kill him. The Prince kills the Vizier and returns the Dagger to Farah, who believes his narrative was just a story. In parting, the Prince mentions a private word she told him during their time in the tomb, leaving her amazed.|$|E

25|$|This episode's {{original}} ending {{involved the}} Doctor, following {{the final scene}} where he is alone in the TARDIS, being alerted to something on the monitor and as he checks two Cybermen rise up behind him. This was supposed to lead directly into The Next Doctor, but Davies was convinced by Benjamin Cook (who was corresponding with Davies for the book Doctor Who: The Writer's <b>Tale)</b> <b>to</b> drop the scene, as he felt that a cliffhanger was not appropriate after such a sad ending.|$|E
25|$|The Time Ships, by Stephen Baxter, first {{published}} in 1995. This sequel was officially authorised by the Wells estate to mark the centenary of the original's publication. In its wide-ranging narrative, the Traveller's desire to return and rescue Weena is thwarted {{by the fact that}} he has changed history (by telling his <b>tale</b> <b>to</b> his friends, one of whom published the account). With a Morlock (in the new history, the Morlocks are intelligent and cultured), he travels through the multiverse as increasingly complicated timelines unravel around him, eventually meeting mankind's far future descendants, whose ambition is to travel back to the birth of the universe, and modify the way the multiverse will unfold. This sequel includes many nods to the prehistory of Wells's story in the names of characters and chapters.|$|E
25|$|After hearing their screams for help, {{a man and}} his son {{who were}} fishing in a nearby cove {{discovered}} the victims and summoned help by contacting park rangers. Napa County Sheriff's deputies Dave Collins and Ray Land were the first law enforcement officers to arrive at the crime scene. Cecelia Shepard was conscious when Collins arrived, providing him with {{a detailed description of the}} attacker. Hartnell and Shepard were taken to Queen of the Valley Hospital in Napa by ambulance. Shepard lapsed into a coma during transport to the hospital and never regained consciousness. She died two days later, but Hartnell survived to recount his <b>tale</b> <b>to</b> the press. Napa County Sheriff Detective Ken Narlow, who was assigned to the case from the outset, worked on solving the crime until his retirement from the department in 1987.|$|E

25|$|Domestic kobolds {{are linked}} to a {{specific}} household. Some legends claim that every house has a resident kobold, regardless of its owners' desires or needs. The means by which a kobold enters a new home vary from <b>tale</b> <b>to</b> tale. One tradition claims that the kobold enters the household by announcing itself at night by strewing wood chips about the house and putting dirt or cow manure in the milk cans. If {{the master of the}} house leaves the wood chips and drinks the soiled milk, the kobold takes up residence. The kobold Heinzelmann of Hundermühlen Castle arrived in 1584 and announced himself by knocking and making other sounds. Should someone take pity on a kobold {{in the form of a}} cold, wet creature and take it inside to warm it, the spirit takes up residence there. A tradition from Perleberg in northern Germany says that a homeowner must follow specific instructions to lure a kobold to his house. He must go on St John's Day between noon and one o'clock, into the forest. When he finds an anthill with a bird on it, he must say a certain phrase, which causes the bird to transform into a small person. The figure then leaps into a bag carried by the homeowner, and he can then transfer the kobold to his home. Even if servants come and go, the kobold stays.|$|E
500|$|Andersen biographer Alison Prince {{believes}} the <b>tale</b> <b>to</b> be a parable representing {{the different kinds}} of love. When the Snowman asks the dog why a young man and woman stroll about the wintry garden hand-in-hand, the disillusioned old dog tells him the two are engaged and will soon be moving into [...] "the same kennel together and sharing each other's bones". The Snowman has a different idea of love, being enamored of the stove. Prince considers the image of the poker found within the Snowman's remains [...] "a homoerotic image of such potency that a failure to spot it seems inconceiveable." ...|$|E
