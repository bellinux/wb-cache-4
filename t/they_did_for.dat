5|$|Following {{the release}} of Terminator 3 in 2003, {{producers}} Andrew G. Vajna and Mario Kassar contracted Nick Stahl and Claire Danes to return as John Connor and Kate Brewster in another film. Director Jonathan Mostow helped develop the script, written by John Brancato and Michael Ferris, and was set to begin production in 2005 after completing another film. It was known by then that Arnold Schwarzenegger's role would be limited, as he had assumed office as Governor of California. The producers sought to have Warner Bros. finance the picture as <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>for</b> Terminator 3. In 2005, Stahl said John and Kate would be recast as the story jumped forward in time. By 2006, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (a successor to Orion Pictures and current owners of the Hemdale Film Corporation library, distributor and producer of the original film, respectively) was set to distribute the fourth film {{as part of the}} new CEO Harry Sloan's scheme to make the studio a viable Hollywood player.|$|E
5|$|Seaborg {{remained}} at the University of California, Berkeley, for post-doctoral research. He followed Frederick Soddy's work investigating isotopes {{and contributed to the}} discovery of more than 100 isotopes of elements. Using one of Lawrence's advanced cyclotrons, John Livingood, Fred Fairbrother, and Seaborg created a new isotope of iron, iron-59 (Fe-59) in 1937. Iron-59 was useful in the studies of the hemoglobin in human blood. In 1938, Livingood and Seaborg collaborated (as <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>for</b> five years) to create an important isotope of iodine, iodine-131 (I-131), which is still used to treat thyroid disease. (Many years later, it was credited with prolonging the life of Seaborg's mother.) As a result of these and other contributions, Seaborg is regarded as a pioneer in nuclear medicine and is one of its most prolific discoverers of isotopes.|$|E
5|$|Ross {{took over}} an {{improved}} team. He had recently signed three players, Milt Schmidt, Bobby Bauer and Woody Dumart, who all {{grew up together}} in Kitchener, Ontario, and had them play on the same line, soon nicknamed the Kraut Line {{in reference to the}} German heritage of all three. Along with them, Ross had acquired a new goaltender in 1938, Frank Brimsek; after Brimsek earned six shutouts in his first eight games, the Bruins traded away Tiny Thompson to allow Brimsek to play. With these players the Bruins finished first in the league in 1937–38; Ross was named as the second best coach in the league, selected for the end of season All-Star Second Team. The next season the Bruins won 36 of 48 games, and won the Stanley Cup in the playoffs; Ross was named to the First All-Star Team as the best coach in the league for the season and the team only tied two games, which is tied for the second fewest in a season. He hired the recently retired Cooney Weiland to coach the Bruins for the 1939–40 NHL season. The Bruins would win the Cup again in 1941, and tied their record of only four away losses all season. Ross once again took over as coach of the team before the 1941–42 season began, as Weiland became coach of the Hershey Bears of the American Hockey League, and led the team to 25 wins in 48 games, which was enough to earn third place in the league. By this time the Second World War had caused several Bruins players, including the entire Kraut Line and goaltender Brimsek, to enlist in their respective armed forces. The Bruins finished second in the NHL during the 1942–43 season with 24 wins in 50 games and Ross was again named in the Second NHL All-Star Team as second best coach in the league. The Bruins missed the playoffs in 1943–44, the first time in ten years they failed to qualify, but returned to the playoffs the next season, something <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>for</b> five straight years.|$|E

25|$|In Ibn Fadlan's {{eyewitness}} {{account of a}} Viking funeral, there is {{a description of a}} slave girl who was to be sacrificed and who had to undergo several sexual rites. When the chieftain had been put in the ship, she went from tent to tent where she visited warriors and traders. Every man told her that they did what <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>for</b> their love to the dead chieftain. Lastly, she entered a tent that had been raised on the ship, and in it six men had intercourse with her before she was strangled and stabbed. The sexual rites with the slave girl show that she was considered to be a vessel for the transmission of life force to the deceased chieftain.|$|E

This {{despite the fact that}} forward Brent Demerais set a single season team record that still stands today with 66 goals. His total represents 26.7% of the total goals the team scored that season. In fact, Demerais' point total of 124 was good enough for third overall in the BCJHL, but it was the lone bright spot in a season with very few.|$|E

25|$|Detail {{notes from}} {{visitors}} to the Constantia estate in the 18th century give evidence of the Dutch influence on South African winemaking. As <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>for</b> the French centuries earlier, the Dutch introduced the technique of adding sulphur to halt fermentation before all the residual sugar has been completely converted into alcohol. This allowed the wine to maintain its sweetness without increasing the alcohol level, similar to adding brandy {{in the production of}} fortified sweet wines; another technique pioneered by the Dutch. To {{keep an eye on the}} ongoing process of fermentation, Cape winemakers would listen near the bunghole of the wine barrel for noise and irritation in the barrel, described as sounding like the barrel was full of crabs. When the barrel was completely quiet and no longer making crab-like noises the wine would finally be racked for clarification and stabilization.|$|E
25|$|The {{weight of}} the hull could {{generally}} be reduced by using higher grades of steel that were lighter and thinner for the same strength, reducing dimensions, particularly length, or using advanced construction techniques like welding that saved weight over the conventional riveting. The Japanese used the same high tensile steel for the Hatsuharu class as <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>for</b> the older destroyers and chose not to increase {{the power of the}} turbines and boilers to achieve the desired high speed, but lengthened the hull to offset the reduced power of the light-weight machinery. The beam was increased to counter some of the extra top-weight, but the draft was reduced to reduce hull resistance, which also reduced stability by lessening the area of the hull beneath the waterline in comparison to the area above it, which was subject to pressure from the wind. Electric welding was extensively used to reduce weight although it was at an early stage of development in Japan and was still problematic.|$|E
500|$|Ibn Khaldun {{reported}} {{the use of}} cannon as siege machines by the Marinid sultan Abu Yaqub Yusuf at the siege of Sijilmasa in 1274. The passage by Ibn Khaldun on the Marinid Siege of Sijilmassa in 1274 occurs as follows: [...] " [...] installed siege engines … and gunpowder engines …, which project small balls of iron.

[...] However this passage and its interpretation has been rejected as anachronistic by most historians, who urge caution regarding claims of Islamic firearms use in the 1204-1324 period as late medieval Arabic texts used the same word for gunpowder, naft, as <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>for</b> an earlier incendiary, naphtha.|$|E

500|$|In October 2000, Wembley Stadium, the final's {{traditional}} venue, {{was closed}} {{in anticipation of}} major redevelopment. Having considered alternative venues such as Twickenham, Murrayfield and Villa Park, the FA announced in January 2001 that the next three Cup finals would be staged at Cardiff's Millennium Stadium. This therefore {{marked the first time}} the showpiece event was held outside England. In the lead-up to the final, FA chief executive Adam Crozier acknowledged concerns over transport {{and the quality of the}} pitch, saying, [...] "We've done a lot of work with Cardiff and hopefully it will be a great occasion, but we'll take a view about how it's worked after the final and decide whether to still hold the match there." [...] A new pitch was re-laid in May, and the police made attempts to ease traffic on the M4 by opening three more turn-offs than <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>for</b> the League Cup final.|$|E
500|$|Starr sang lead vocals {{for a song}} {{on most of the}} Beatles' studio albums as part of {{an attempt}} to {{establish}} a vocal personality for each band member.

500|$|Final Symphony II {{features}} long arrangements {{like the}} Final Symphony concerts, from different games: {{while the first}} concert was based on Final Fantasy VI, VII, and X, the second uses pieces from Final Fantasy V, VIII, IX, and XIII. Like the first concert, all of the arrangements are new, and not based on any previous work. The majority of the music was originally composed by Nobuo Uematsu, while the Final Fantasy XIII suite was originally composed by Masashi Hamauzu. The arrangers from the first concert reprised their roles for the second: Valtonen created the arrangements for the Final Fantasy V section, Wanamo worked on the VIII and IX portions, and Hamauzu, with assistance from Valtonen, arranged Hamauzu's own compositions from XIII with orchestration by Valtonen. Like <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>for</b> the previous concert, when Merregnon Studios first began the project, Böcker, Valtonen, and Wanamo took {{a few months to}} play through the games, watch playthrough videos, and read reviews and analyses of the games, {{in order to understand the}} structure and progression of the main themes of the music in each game. An introductory fanfare, [...] "In a Roundabout Way", was composed by Valtonen for the concert. Unlike Final Symphony, which featured three styles of orchestral performances—a piano concerto, a symphonic poem, and a three-movement symphony—all four arrangements are single-section arrangements, with the IX portion as a piano concerto.|$|E

The reviewer also considered Formby [...] "our first authentic and strictly indigenous film comedian". After completing filming, the Formbys undertook a further ENSA tour. Although Dean personally disliked the Formbys, he greatly admired the tireless work <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>for</b> the organisation.

500|$|Using the {{orchestra}} enabled a greater expression of emotion, {{which meant that}} they used it when creating scores for environments, cinematic scenes, and emotional moments within the story. Conversely, the team were given less freedom to adjust tracks {{as they had been}} able to with synthesized tracks. Something new <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>for</b> Skyward Sword was producing unique themes for specific characters such as Link and Zelda. They also added people singing songs, another element new to the series. One notable element was the game's main theme [...] "Ballad of the Goddess", which was actually a reversed version of the recurring tune [...] "Zelda's Lullaby". Due to the use of an orchestra and the sheer amount of extra work going into the sound design, the music team doubled in size from the standard five-person group, and became the largest sound team at the time to have worked on a Nintendo game.
