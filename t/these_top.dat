Overall, 36 out of 46 departments rated gained the top two ratings of 5 or 5*, and 76% of all the academic staff working in departments scored <b>these</b> <b>top</b> two levels. In terms of teaching strength, Bristol had an average Teaching Quality Assessment score of 22.05/24 before the TQA was abolished.

Transfers, freshmen, and medical red-shirts were not eligible for this preseason list, but were evaluated and considered for both the Midseason Top 30 list and the National Ballot. The Big Ten was represented by Purdue's Hummel, Wisconsin's Landry and Michigan State's Morgan.|$|E
5|$|The {{domestic}} cat is {{a significant}} predator of birds. UK assessments indicate they may be accountable for an estimated 64.8million bird deaths each year. A 2012 study suggests feral cats may kill several billion birds {{each year in the}} United States. Certain species appear more susceptible than others; for example, 30% of house sparrow mortality is linked to the domestic cat. In the recovery of ringed robins (Erithacus rubecula) and dunnocks (Prunella modularis), 31% of deaths were a result of cat predation. In parts of North America, the presence of larger carnivores such as coyotes which prey on cats and other small predators reduces the effect of predation by cats and other small predators such as opossums and raccoons on bird numbers and variety. The proposal that cat populations will increase when the numbers of <b>these</b> <b>top</b> predators decline is called the mesopredator release hypothesis.|$|E

Descending south west from the summit are High Pen (1,558ft), Low Pen (1,427ft), Godworth (1,197ft) and Kelton Fell (1,020ft). Beyond lie the Croasdale road and the West Cumberland plain. Standing aloof from <b>these</b> <b>tops,</b> but still within Blake Fell's orbit, is Knock Murton (1,467ft). This is a steep sided fell, forested on the western flank and with sufficient prominence that it is only barely excluded from the list of Marilyns in its own right.

5|$|<b>These</b> <b>top</b> {{stories are}} very narrow with low, sloped ceilings, and are useful only for holding {{radio-broadcasting}} and other mechanical and electrical equipment. Television station WCBS-TV (Channel 2) originally transmitted {{from the top}} of the Chrysler starting in 1938. The installation continued through the early 1950s, when it moved to the Empire State Building due to competition from RCA's transmitter at the latter tower. For many years, WPAT-FM and WTFM (now WKTU) also used the Chrysler Building as a transmission site, but they also moved to the Empire State Building by the 1970s. Since then, there have not been any commercial broadcast stations located at the Chrysler Building.|$|E

25|$|While the BCS {{routinely}} involved {{controversy about}} which two teams {{are the top}} teams, in rare instances there was a clear-cut top two; the BCS ensured <b>these</b> <b>top</b> two would play {{each other for the}} championship. For example, USC and Texas in 2005 were the only undefeated teams; both teams were only tested a couple of times all season and mauled every other opponent they faced by large margins. Had this scenario occurred before the inception of the BCS, the teams would have been unable to play each other due to contractual obligations with the major bowls and there would have been dual national champions. Under the BCS system however, these two teams got to play for the championship.|$|E
