5|$|During the 18th century, <b>the</b> <b>street</b> {{began to}} be popular with the bourgeoisie living around Mayfair. Shop owners let out their upper storeys for {{residential}} purposes, attracting lodgers such as Jonathan Swift, George Selwyn, William Pitt the Elder and Laurence Sterne. In 1784, Georgiana Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire, an active socialite, demanded that people boycott Covent Garden as its residents had voted against Whig member of parliament Charles James Fox. This had caused him to lose his seat in parliament, leading to {{the dissolution of the}} Fox–North Coalition. She insisted people should look for nearer shopping streets, and encouraged people to go to Bond Street. Consequently, <b>the</b> <b>street</b> became a retail area for people living in Mayfair. By the end of the century, an upper-class social group known as the Bond Street Loungers had appeared, wearing expensive wigs and parading up and down <b>the</b> <b>street</b> in a pretentious manner.|$|E

5|$|In 1711, by {{the order}} of then-Governor of Kiev, the route between the Zamkova and Andriyivskyy {{mountains}} were expanded, thus allowing traffic to become more suitable for horses and wagon carriages. The Andriyivskyy Descent was renamed in 1920 in honor of young revolutionary Georgiy Liver. In 1944, {{it was decided to}} return <b>the</b> <b>street</b> to its prior name; in 1957, <b>the</b> <b>street</b> was renamed back to Andreevsky Spusk—the Russian variant of Andriyivskyy Descent. In the 1980s, the Andriyivskyy Descent received a thorough reconstruction after years of disrepair.|$|E
5|$|It {{is first}} {{recorded}} in local records as Osborne Street in 1877, and given its present name in 1882. According to education historian Alison Wheatley, <b>the</b> <b>street</b> is possibly {{named after a}} James Turner who taught at King Edward's School in Birmingham, and the name may have been suggested by a former pupil, who became a town planner, {{as a way of}} honouring Turner's legacy. However, the Birmingham historian Carl Chinn believes <b>the</b> <b>street</b> was named for a local businessman and partner in the firm Hammond, Turner & Sons, a manufacturer of buttons.|$|E
5|$|Many {{residents}} {{moved away}} from Bow Street after the theatre {{was established in the}} early 18th century. Life in <b>the</b> <b>street</b> declined and became known for pornography and prostitution. The publisher Edmund Curll lived at No.2 during this time, and by 1740 <b>the</b> <b>street</b> held 8 pubs, concealing a number of brothels. In 1833, the Commissioners of Woods, Forest and Land Revenues were looking to buy land on and around Bow Street, and discovered that James Robinson, lessee to the Duke of Bedford, was running a brothel there. In the following legal dispute, Robinson's legal team accused the Commissioner's surveyor of being prejudiced against prostitution. The building was demolished, but made little difference to the area's reputation. In 1844, a resident suggested <b>the</b> <b>street</b> should be renamed as a continuation of Wellington Street to distance itself from the reputation Bow Street had acquired.|$|E

5|$|Oxford Street changed {{character}} from residential to retail {{towards the end}} of the 19th century. Drapers, cobblers and furniture stores began to appear on <b>the</b> <b>street,</b> and were later expanded into the first department stores. Street vendors began to sell tourist souvenirs on <b>the</b> <b>street</b> during this time. A plan of Oxford Street in Tallis's London Street Views, published in the late 1830s, remarks that almost all <b>the</b> <b>street,</b> save for the far western end, was primarily retail. John Lewis started in 1864 as a small shop at No.132, while Selfridges opened on 15 March 1909 at No.400. Most of the southern side of Oxford Street west of Davies Street was completely rebuilt between 1865 and 1890, allowing a more uniform freehold ownership. By the 1930s, <b>the</b> <b>street</b> was almost entirely retail, a position that remains today. However, unlike nearby streets such as Bond Street and Park Lane, there remained a seedy element including street traders and prostitutes. Aside from a number of fixed places on <b>the</b> <b>street,</b> there are no provisions for selling licensed goods on Oxford Street. The advent of closed-circuit television has reduced the attraction of the area to scam artists and illegal street traders.|$|E
