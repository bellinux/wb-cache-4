25|$|In 1847, {{two ships}} from Cuba transported workers to Havana {{to work in}} the sugar cane fields from the port of Xiamen, one of the five Chinese treaty ports opened to the British by the Treaty of Nanking in 1842. The trade soon spread to other ports in Guangdong, and demand became {{particularly}} strong in Peru for workers in the silver mines and the guano collecting industry. Australia began importing workers in 1848, and the United States began using them in 1865 on the First Transcontinental Railroad construction. These workers were deceived about their <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> to a much greater extent than their Indian counterparts, and consequently, there was a much higher level of Chinese emigration during this period.|$|E
25|$|According to the OECD, Finland's {{job market}} is the least {{flexible}} of the Nordic countries. Finland increased job market regulation in the 1970s to provide stability to manufacturers. In contrast, during the 1990s, Denmark liberalised its job market, Sweden moved to more decentralised contracts, whereas Finnish trade unions blocked many reforms. Many professions have legally recognized industry-wide contracts that lay down common <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> including seniority levels, holiday entitlements, and salary levels, usually {{as part of a}} Comprehensive Income Policy Agreement. Those who favor less centralized labor market policies consider these agreements bureaucratic, inflexible, and along with tax rates, a key contributor to unemployment and distorted prices. Centralized agreements may hinder structural change as there are fewer incentives to acquire better skills, although Finland already enjoys one of the highest skill-levels in the world.|$|E
25|$|The Commissioners had {{employed}} {{teams of}} gaulters throughout the 19th and early 20th century, who got their {{name from the}} use of an impervious type of clay called gault, which was obtained from Roswell Pits at Ely, and used to repair the banks of the rivers and the cross dyke. The teams consisted of three men, who managed a train of five boats between them, each capable of holding 8 tons of gault. The boats were owned by the Commissioners, but the men were responsible for the provision of a horse, shovels and barrows. In 1886, new <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> were negotiated by the Commissioners, as they felt that the wages earned by the men were excessive. In 1920, the Ouse Drainage Board was established, and responsibility for the maintenance of the river banks passed to them, so the Commissioners laid off the men and sold the boats.|$|E

500|$|Despite the Mayo Foundation's {{arguments}} otherwise, the Court {{ruled that}} [...] "student" [...] was a sufficiently ambiguous term {{to state that}} Congress has specifically addressed the issue. The Court also noted that Congress in the past had specifically singled out medical residents when making exemptions available, which in the Court's eyes made the Mayo Foundation's arguments about unambiguity unreasonable. Therefore, according to Chevron, {{the role of the}} courts should solely be to determine whether the Treasury Department made a reasonable decision—and the Court concluded that the Treasury did just that. In writing for the Court, Roberts stated that [...] "The [...] department certainly did not act irrationally in concluding that these doctors – 'who work long hours, serve as high [...] skilled professionals, and typically share {{some or all of the}} <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> of career employees' – are the kind of workers that Congress intended to both contribute and benefit from the Social Security system".|$|E

However, in March 1931, Ramsay MacDonald asked Trenchard to take the post of Metropolitan Police Commissioner, which after initially declining, Trenchard eventually accepted in October 1931. [...] Trenchard served as head of the Metropolitan Police until 1935 and during his tenure he instigated several changes. These included limiting membership of the Police Federation, introducing limited <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> and the creation of separate career paths for the lower and higher ranks akin to the military system of officer and non-commissioned career streams. [...] Perhaps Trenchard's most well known achievement during his time as Commissioner was the establishment of the Hendon Police College which originally was the institution from which Trenchard's junior inspectors graduated before following a career in the higher ranks. Trenchard retired in November 1935 and in his final few months as Police Commissioner, he was made a Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order.|$|E

40|$|This essay {{offers some}} {{reflections}} for {{the theory and}} practice of research supervision drawn from the field <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> relations. It argues that rethinking supervision in <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> the <b>employment</b> relationship can advance dialogue and debate about supervision. This is twofold. (1) Reframing supervision in <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> the <b>employment</b> relationship can illuminate our understanding of supervision as an institutionally prescribed power relationship. (2) Normative scholarship on the employment relationship can illuminate what may constitute ‘good’ supervision as well as inspire a benchmark against which supervision can be evaluated and managed. The essay concludes by suggesting some possible implications for supervisory practice...|$|R
