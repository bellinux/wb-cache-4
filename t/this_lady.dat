He is kept from doing so externally by her uncle, Sir Positive Trap, by the workings of her aunt, and internally by themselves. Against her uncles wishes, Helena and Merital elope. Although Trap is angered by <b>this,</b> <b>Lady</b> Matchless steps in and defends the marriage by saying that she too will marry like her cousin. The play ends with a song about beauty, virtue, and lovers.|$|E

H. P. R.

On that basis, a number of relatives have been proposed for Ælfgifu, including a sister called Æthelflæd, a brother called Eadmær, and a grandmother called Brihtwyn.|$|E

500|$|Reverend Samuel Bishop (1731–95) was a poet, {{headmaster}} of Merchant Taylors' {{school and}} rector of Ditton. His posthumously published book entitled Poems (1796) was much admired and several times reprinted. Not everyone was complimentary about Bishop and his verses: [...] "the character of Bishop's countenance {{is not very}} intellectual, {{and there is a}} timid, and almost mean expression about the mouth. He looks but little qualified to insist upon the discipline necessary to be observed at Merchant Tailor's (sic) school, or to wield the weapons of Dr. Busby. But, we suppose, he did both occasionally, besides writing his epigrams, and composing verses to his wife, — [...] "To Mrs. Bishop."

500|$|According to Zhu Yu's book Pingzhou Table Talks ( [...] ; Pingzhou Ketan) of 1119, Shen Kuo had two marriages; {{the second}} wife was the {{daughter}} of Zhang Chu (...) , who came from Huainan. Lady Zhang was said to be overbearing and fierce, often abusive to Shen Kuo, even attempting at one time to pull off his beard. Shen Kuo's children were often upset over this, and prostrated themselves to Lady Zhang to quit this behavior. Despite <b>this,</b> <b>Lady</b> Zhang went as far as to drive out Shen Kuo's son from his first marriage, expelling him from the household. However, after Lady Zhang died, Shen Kuo fell into a deep depression and even attempted to jump into the Yangtze River to drown himself. Although this suicide attempt failed, he would die a year later.|$|E
500|$|At her death, Barbauld was lauded in the Newcastle Magazine as [...] "unquestionably {{the first}} [...] of our female poets, {{and one of}} the most eloquent and {{powerful}} of our prose writers" [...] and the Imperial Magazine declared [...] "so long as letters shall be cultivated in Britain, or wherever the English language shall be known, so long will the name of <b>this</b> <b>lady</b> be respected." [...] She was favourably compared to both Joseph Addison and Samuel Johnson, no mean feat for a woman writer in the eighteenth century. By 1925 she was remembered only as a moralising writer for children, if that. It was not until the advent of feminist literary criticism within the academy in the 1970s and 1980s that Barbauld finally began to be included in literary history.|$|E
500|$|Lady Saigō was {{the ancestral}} {{mother to the}} line of shoguns that began with the second Edo period shogun, Tokugawa Hidetada, and ended with the seventh, Tokugawa Ietsugu (1709–1716). [...] Aside from <b>this,</b> <b>Lady</b> Saigō also became {{connected}} to the Imperial line. [...] In 1620, Hidetada's daughter, Tokugawa Masako (1607–1678), married Emperor Go-Mizunoo and entered the Imperial palace. [...] As empress consort, Masako helped maintain the Imperial Court, supported the arts, and significantly influenced the next three monarchs: the first was her daughter, and the two that followed, Emperors Go-Kōmyō and Go-Sai, were sons of Emperor Go-Mizunoo by different concubines. [...] The daughter of Masako, and thus great-granddaughter of Lady Saigō, was Princess Okiko (1624–1696), who acceded to the Chrysanthemum Throne in 1629 as Empress Meishō. [...] She reigned for fifteen years as the 109thmonarch of Japan, the seventh of only eight empresses regnant in the history of Japan, until she abdicated in 1643.|$|E

500|$|The term [...] "hoochie coochie", with {{variations}} in the spelling, is used in different contexts. [...] Appearing in the late 19th century, the hoochie coochie was a sexually provocative dance. [...] Don Wilmeth identifies it as [...] "a precursor of the striptease... from the belly dance but punctuated with bumps and grinds and a combination of exposure, erotic movements, and teasing." [...] By one account, it first appeared at the Philadelphia Centennial Exhibition in 1876 and was a popular attraction at the 1893 Chicago World's Fair. [...] The dance is associated with entertainers Little Egypt and Sophie Tucker, but by the 1910s it declined in popularity. [...] "Hoochie coochie" [...] {{is also used to}} refer to a sexually attractive person or a practitioner of hoodoo. [...] In his autobiography, I Am the Blues, Dixon included [...] "hoochie coochie man" [...] in his examples of a seer or a clairvoyant with a connection to folklore of the American South: [...] "This guy is a hoodoo man, <b>this</b> <b>lady</b> is a witch, this other guy's a hoochie coochie man, she's some kind of voodoo person".|$|E
500|$|Louisiana Tech {{knocked off}} N.C. State in their {{semifinal}} match, 84–65, making {{the national championship}} a match-up between the two teams that started the season ranked first and second. The game was not close. Seven {{and a half minutes}} through the first half, the Lady Vols were up by fifteen, and by halftime the score was 55–32. The 55 points was a record for most points in a half in a national championship game. Tech was not able to make a run until late in the second half, when they were able to cut the lead down to eighteen, only to see Kellie Jolly hit back-to-back three pointers. The final score was 93 to 75. Three different Lady Vols scored twenty or more points: Holdsclaw (25), Catchings (27), and Jolly (20). Holdsclaw, who was named the Final Four MVP, her second consecutive, also won her seventh straight title (3 NCAA, 4 State). After the game, Louisiana Tech head coach Leon Balmore proclaimed <b>this</b> <b>Lady</b> Vols squad to be the [...] "best ever", something Old Dominion Hall of Famer Nancy Lieberman has stated back in February. However, not everyone was positive, as ESPN analyst Mimi Griffin stated that Tennessee's dominance was becoming a detriment to the women's game.|$|E
500|$|They co-starred in Unforgiven, {{and had a}} daughter, Francesca Eastwood (born Francesca Fisher-Eastwood; August 7, 1993). The {{birth of}} Francesca {{marked the first time}} Eastwood was present for one of his {{children}} being born. Eastwood and Fisher ended their relationship in early 1995, after which Fisher said it took two years to complete what she called the grieving process for her shattered dreams. Before she had moved out of Eastwood's home, he was said to already be dating Dina Ruiz, a television news anchor 35 years his junior whom he had first met when she interviewed him in April 1993. They married on March 31, 1996, when Eastwood surprised her with a private ceremony at a home on the Shadow Creek Golf Course in Las Vegas. The marriage was noted for {{the fact that it was}} only Eastwood's second legal union in spite of his many long-term romances over the decades. Eastwood said of his bride, [...] "I'm proud to make <b>this</b> <b>lady</b> my wife. She's the one I've been waiting for." [...] Ruiz commented, [...] "The fact that I'm only the second woman he has married really touches me." [...] The couple has one daughter, Morgan Eastwood (born December 12, 1996). Ruiz made cameos in two of Eastwood's films, Blood Work and True Crime (in which Fisher even appeared). In the summer of 2012, Dina, Morgan and Francesca starred with the band Overtone in the E! reality-television show Mrs. Eastwood & Company, on which Clint appeared infrequently.|$|E

500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{surviving}} synopsis was published in The Moving Picture World on June 25, 1910. It states: [...] "Thelma is a simple Norwegian maiden living alone with her father {{in the land of}} the midnight sun. Her father is one of the few remaining Vikings, famous in history. As such he is held in great reverence by his servants, who consider him somewhat in the nature of a king, and his daughter a princess. Outside of the years spent at school, Thelma has spent nearly all her time alone, her mother having died when she was a baby. When on a visit to her mother's grave, Thelma meets Sir Philip Errington, a distinguished young Englishman, who is touring Norway in his private yacht. Sir Philip is instantly attracted to her and, obtaining information as to where she lives, presents himself to Olaf, the Viking, and is finally admitted to his friendship and that of his daughter. Sir Philip woos and wins the fair Thelma for his bride, and with her sails back to England. In London, Thelma at once creates a favorable impression and is cordially welcomed by all of Sir Philip's friends, who comprise the nobility and aristocracy of the metropolis. Lady Clara, alone, of all Sir Philip's old friends, wishes Thelma harm. She has long felt an affection for Sir Phillip, and resents the fact that he spurned her love and chose his bride in far-off Norway. This wicked and designing woman determines to wreck Thelma's happiness, and force her to leave England. This she contrives to do, in making Thelma believe that Sir Philip no longer loves her, but that in truth his heart belongs to Lady Clara. As proof of her statement she shows Thelma a letter written to her by Sir Philip in which he pleads the cause of his friend, who is in love with Lady Clara, and wishes her to become his wife. <b>This</b> <b>Lady</b> Clara claims is a love letter written by Sir Philip to her. Thelma, heartbroken, believing she has lost her husband's love, returns to Norway, just as her father, the Viking, breathes his last. She, with his faithful followers, complies with his last wishes, which are that he shall be buried as his forefathers were before him – sent out to sea in his burning ship. This form of burial had been that accorded to all Vikings for centuries past. After straining her eyes for a final look at the departing ship, Thelma retraces her steps to her mother's grave, and there, feeling that she is absolutely alone, prays for the strength to live. Here in a rocky dell before the tomb of her mother, where first she met the man who won her heart, Sir Philip again finds Thelma. A few words suffice to show her how she has been tricked, and a fervent protestation of his love convinces her that she still has a place in his heart. In Sir Philip's arms she finds comfort for the loss of her father; she starts out bravely to again face the world, now sure of his unending love." ...|$|E
