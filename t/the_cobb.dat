5|$|Despite limited {{information}} about its service routes and construction, the Nathan F. Cobb {{was the subject}} of two separate New York Times articles during its short career. One article reported the wreck the day after it occurred, the other article came from 20 June 1892 and chronicled a disturbance between mates. <b>The</b> <b>Cobb</b> was still in tow only three miles outside Mobile Bay, beginning its route from Mobile, Alabama to New York, when mate Henry Shaffer jumped over board to avoid a beating. Another mate, J. Trott had already used a belaying pin to half kill another seaman on the schooner and Shaffer was fearful for his life. Shaffer began swimming towards a nearby light house and was picked up nearly five miles from where he jumped over board. The captain of the towboat reported that Captain Cookson of <b>the</b> <b>Cobb,</b> mentioned incidentally they had lost a crewman. Both Cookson and Trott already had pending charges against them for cruelty and marooning of sailors, stemming from an incident in May 1891 at Calcasieu Pass, Louisiana.|$|E

5|$|A {{significant}} {{influx of}} population and economic activity occurred around the 1850s goldrushes, particularly the Kiandra rush of 1859–60. The goldrushes prompted {{the establishment of}} communication between Sydney and the region by way of <b>the</b> <b>Cobb</b> & Co coaches, which transported mail and passengers. The first post offices opened in Ginninderra in 1859 and at Lanyon the following year. Bushranger activity continued with the goldrushes: Australian-born bandits Ben Hall and the Clarke brothers were active in the area, targeting mail coaches and gold transportation.|$|E
5|$|The Nathan F. Cobb was a three-masted {{schooner}} {{named after}} the shipbuilder and founder of Cobb’s Salvaging Company whose many rescues of stranded ships help lead {{to the formation of}} the United States Life-Saving Service. Despite its namesake's history of shipwreck rescues, the Nathan F. Cobb capsized in heavy seas on 1 December 1896 en route from Brunswick, Georgia to New York with a cargo of timber and cross ties. The cook and a shipmate drowned when they were swept overboard in violent seas. The crew righted the vessel by removing the three masts and they drifted for four days until they became grounded on a sandbar off Ormond Beach, Florida. Rescue attempts led to the drowning of volunteer Ferd Waterhouse, whose body was never recovered, but no other crew members were lost. A plaque commemorates Ferd Waterhouse’s rescue efforts. <b>The</b> <b>Cobb</b> Cottage, a structure built using materials salvaged from the ship, is part of Ormond Beach’s Historic Trail.|$|E
25|$|In 1948 <b>the</b> <b>Cobb</b> County Board of Education {{established}} <b>the</b> <b>Cobb</b> County library, {{taking advantage}} of state matching funds {{in order to secure}} monies for books to support a future county library system. During this same time, and into the early 1950s J. Dennis Kemp became concerned about the lack of library resources in unincorporated areas of Cobb County and went to the county commissioner to see if library outreach could be afforded to these communities. A county-appointed study committee, created in 1956 began to explore the possibilities of joining <b>the</b> <b>Cobb</b> County library collection with the existing Clarke Library. The next year the committee finalized a merger creating <b>the</b> <b>Cobb</b> County-Marietta Public Library Board, and two years later in 1959 they combined and brought the Clarke and Fort Hill libraries to the system. Prior to this acquisition the Fort Hill branch was, for many decades, the only library where blacks could go. At its inception this county library system consisted of 25,000 books with a budget of $10,500 split equally into thirds by the city school system, county school system, and the county government.|$|E

It is thought that mortar {{was used in the}} Cobb's construction {{for the first time in}} this rebuilding. It was reconstructed in 1820 using Portland Admiralty Roach, a type of Portland stone.

40|$|Background Over a {{lifetime}} of having radiographs, a patient with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) can be cumulatively exposed to high doses of ionizing radiation. Therefore, radiation-free, effective, and low-cost methods to screen and diagnose scoliosis have been sought for years. Purpose This study aims to investigate the correlation between <b>the</b> <b>Cobb's</b> angle and <b>the</b> spinous process angle (SPA) and to study the feasibility of using clinical ultrasound images to estimate <b>the</b> <b>Cobb's</b> angle by measuring the SPA. Study Design This manuscript includes a retrospective and a prospective study. Methods In the retrospective study, radiographs from 43 subjects with AIS were used to investigate the correlation between <b>the</b> <b>Cobb's</b> angle and <b>the</b> SPA at the pre-brace and in-brace stages. Following this study, a prospective clinical ultrasound study was conducted on 33 subjects with AIS at the pre-brace stage to measure the SPA. Results High intra-rater and inter-rater reliabilities of radiograph measurements were found (ICC[3, 3] = 0. 97, ICC[2, 3] = 0. 91, p <. 05). The clinical ultrasound measurements were also found to be highly reliable (ICC[3, 3] = 0. 91, p <. 05). There was a significant correlation (r = 0. 80 at the pre-brace stage and r = 0. 87 at the in-brace stage, p <. 05) between <b>the</b> <b>Cobb's</b> angle and <b>the</b> SPA measured from the radiograph measurements, whereas the SPA measured from ultrasound images were found highly correlated with that measured from the radiographs at the pre-brace stage (r = 0. 90, p <. 01). Conclusions The {{findings of this study}} could support the new parameter (SPA) in the estimation of <b>the</b> <b>Cobb's</b> angle of a scoliotic curve in the coronal plane, and clinical ultrasound imaging could be developed and applied to assess scoliosis in a fast and noninvasive fashion.

50|$|Deaf {{education}} in the United States began during the early 1800s, when <b>the</b> <b>Cobbs</b> School (an oral school) was established by William Bolling and John Braidwood and the Connecticut Asylum for the Deaf and Dumb (a manual school) was established by Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet and Laurent Clerc. When <b>the</b> <b>Cobbs</b> School closed in 1816, the manual method (which used American Sign Language) became common in deaf schools {{for most of the}} rest of the century. During the late 1800s schools began using the oral method, which only allowed the use of speech (in contrast to the manual method previously in place). The oral method was used for many years, until sign-language instruction gradually returned to deaf education.|$|R
5000|$|Frank Cobbs {{attended}} {{prep school}} at the University of Notre Dame, later attended the Michigan Military Academy, then obtained a degree from Olivet College in 1894. [...] He returned to Cadillac to work at Cobbs & Mitchell, and in 1895 organized the Cadillac State Bank. However, soon after, his father Jonathon Cobbs became ill. As the only son, Frank Cobbs took over his father's place at <b>Cobbs</b> & Mitchell; <b>the</b> elder <b>Cobbs</b> eventually died in 1898.

500|$|Nathan F. Cobb {{was named}} after a ship builder, born in 1797 from Eastham, Massachusetts on Cape Cod. Cobb and his family moved from Eastham to Northampton County, Virginia before {{purchasing}} Sand Shoal Island, which later became Cobb Island. It was on Cobb Island, in 1839, that Nathan founded Cobb's Salvaging Company with his sons. They specialized in wrecking and salvaging stranded vessels along the shallow Mid-Atlantic coastline. <b>The</b> <b>Cobbs</b> had a remarkable record; not one person drowned {{in any of the}} rescue efforts for the 37 or more ships stranded off their island. The success of the salvaging company earned them the sobriquet [...] "Rothschilds among the toilers of the sea". Despite the company's notable prosperity, <b>the</b> <b>Cobbs</b> were often praised for their humanity and general regard for human life, [...] "Often a crew of ten or twenty would be landed on the island from stranded vessels without a penny, and they were tenderly cared for as though they were millionaires." [...] This practice was a rare creed among wreckers in the 19th century. <b>The</b> <b>Cobbs</b> and others like them transformed the act of salvaging which led way to the forming of the United States Life-Saving Service; this later merged into what is now the United States Coast Guard.|$|R
