Before the year was out following that camp, he went to Colorado and participated in a skiing camp specifically for people who use monoskis. During the following Australian ski season, he participated in a learn to ski race camp at Thredbo.|$|E
5|$|Without Graham, the Browns floundered in 1956. Injuries to two Browns quarterbacks left {{relative}} unknown Tommy O'Connell as the starter, and Cleveland {{finished with}} a 5–7 record, its first losing season. Dante Lavelli and Frank Gatski retired {{at the end of}} the season, leaving Groza as the only original Browns player still on the team. While the Browns' on-field play in 1956 was uninspiring, off-the-field drama developed after a Cleveland-based inventor let Brown test a helmet with a radio transmitter inside. After <b>trying</b> <b>it</b> out in training camp, Brown used the helmet to call plays during the pre-season with long-time backup George Ratterman behind center. The device allowed the coach to direct his quarterback on the fly, giving him an advantage over franchises who had to use messenger players to relay instructions. The Browns used the device off and on into the regular season, and other teams began to experiment with their own radio helmets. Bert Bell, the NFL commissioner, banned the device in October 1956. Today, however, all NFL teams use in-helmet radios to communicate with players.|$|E

25|$|Tilt-A-Whirl is an {{amusement}} ride {{that consists of}} seven freely spinning cars, each holding three or four passengers, attached at fixed pivot points on a rotating platform. Designed for commercial use at amusement parks, fairs and carnivals {{in which it is}} commonly found, the Tilt-A-Whirl is commonly known for making riders experience nausea. The Tilt-A-Whirl was invented in 1926 by Herbert Sellner, who first operated it at {{an amusement}} park in White Bear Lake, Minnesota. More than likely, Sellner discovered its unpredictable dynamics not through mathematical analysis but by building one and <b>trying</b> <b>it</b> out.|$|E

25|$|<b>Trying</b> <b>it</b> out for {{the first}} time on 21 February 1940, it {{immediately}} began producing 400W of 10cm (3GHz) microwaves. Within days they noticed that it was causing fluorescent tubes to light up across the room. Quick calculations showed this meant the tube was creating about 500W, already beating the klystrons. They pushed this over 1,000W within weeks. The main Birmingham team gave up on the klystron and began work on this new cavity magnetron, and by the summer had examples producing 15kW. In April, GEC was told of their work and asked if they could further improve the design.|$|E
25|$|The caged rats (Groups CC and PC) {{took to the}} {{morphine}} instantly, {{even with}} relatively little sweetener, with the caged males drinking 19 times more morphine than the Rat Park males {{in one of the}} experimental conditions. The rats in Rat Park resisted the morphine water. They would try it occasionallywith the females <b>trying</b> <b>it</b> more often than the malesbut they showed a statistically significant preference for the plain water. He writes that the most interesting group was Group CP, the rats who were brought up in cages but moved to Rat Park before the experiment began. These animals rejected the morphine solution when it was stronger, but as it became sweeter and more dilute, they began to drink almost as much as the rats that had lived in cages throughout the experiment. They wanted the sweet water, he concluded, so long as it did not disrupt their normal social behavior. Even more significant, he writes, was that when he added a drug called Naloxone, which negates the effects of opioids, to the morphine-laced water, the Rat Park rats began to drink it.|$|E
25|$|In another {{episode that}} focused on myths {{surrounding}} electronic security devices, there was a segment on defeating biometric fingerprint readers using various methods. One of these techniques involved creating a fake 3D fingerprint from a 2D image of the authorized print. After some trial and error, the team successfully cast a viable ballistics gel reproduction using a copper-coated circuit board, {{a picture of the}} fingerprint printed on acetate, and a photochemical acid etching process. After the reproduction was shown to defeat both fingerprint scanners, and although the chemicals used during the etching process are never identified, the narrator still hints at an important step having been edited out and discourages viewers from <b>trying</b> <b>it</b> themselves. None of the other techniques that successfully defeated the fingerprint scanners or the other security devices tested in the episode were censored or obfuscated, perhaps because the rest were all fairly simple and straightforward methods, such as holding up a bedsheet or moving extremely slowly to hide from ultrasonic motion detectors or holding up a pane of glass to defeat thermal motion detectors.|$|E

500|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave a mixed review, {{giving the}} film {{three out of}} four stars despite {{complaining}} that the film [...] "recycles a plot that was already old when Tracy and Hepburn were <b>trying</b> <b>it</b> out". Peter Travers of Rolling Stone was very critical of the film, calling it insipid. He wrote, [...] "Anne Fletcher directs Peter Chiarelli's script like a manufacturer of hard plastic that is guaranteed to ward off intrusion from all recognizable human emotion." [...] New York Times writer Manohla Dargis felt that Bullock's character was awkward in comparison to her previous work. She continued: [...] "She’s always been better in fundamentally independent roles that allow her to grab the wheel [...] and take the spotlight , an independence that persists {{all the way through the}} last-act coupling. She can smile as brightly at a man as well as the next leading lady, though, like all genuinely big female stars, she’s really more of a solo act." [...] The Telegraph Tim Robey expressed disappointment towards the film, giving it a two out of five stars.|$|E

[...] In 1933, Victor had assigned {{the recording of}} the song to Ted Weems and his Orchestra, and wanted it recorded quickly. [...] Weems and his band had time for only one rehearsal before recording the song. [...] Initially, Weems {{did not like the}} song; he decided to omit the lyrics by way of having Tanner whistle instead. [...] While running through the song at rehearsal, someone thought of <b>trying</b> <b>it</b> with a speedier tempo than initially written. It was not a large seller, and the master was filed away. In 1938, Weems was now working with Decca Records and was preparing to make another record. [...] When someone had forgotten to assign a song for the [...] "B" [...] side of the record, Weems and Tanner made another recording of [...] "Heartaches"; the Decca version was not any more successful than the Victor one had been five years earlier.|$|E
500|$|Turnage, who had {{previously}} composed one full-length opera, Greek, worked on the musical version of Twice between 1994 and 1996. It was commissioned by the John S. Cohen Foundation. He had learnt of Kay's original work after he was shown {{a copy of the}} BBC video by poet and artistic director Maura Dooley. It was a difficult development with Turnage at one point abandoning the work in favour of other pieces. Composer and librettist had started out with the intention of developing a full-length opera including both soprano and baritone narrators. (The original television script had included poems for the judge {{as well as for the}} woman.) However, the creators felt that their attempts at redeveloping and expanding the original work [...] "water down its impact" [...] and they eventually cut everything apart from the woman's words. Both text and setting also underwent repeated changes in detail. Kay changed some of the wording to make it easier to sing. Similarly, Turnage revised the music after <b>trying</b> <b>it</b> out with Sally Burgess who was to give the first performance. He had become Composer in Association with English National Opera (ENO) in 1995 and was able to thoroughly workshop Twice and its companion piece with ENO's Contemporary Opera Studio before arriving at their respective final versions.|$|E
