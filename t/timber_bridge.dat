5|$|Monmouth {{had been}} a {{significant}} border settlement since the Roman occupation of Britain, when it {{was the site of}} the fort of Blestium. The River Wye may have been bridged at this time but the Monnow, being easily fordable, appears not to have had a crossing until after the Norman Conquest. According to the local tradition, construction of Monnow Bridge began in 1272 to replace a 12th-century Norman <b>timber</b> <b>bridge.</b> Through the medieval era, the English Civil War, and the Chartist uprising, the bridge played a significant, if ineffectual, role in defending Monmouth. It also served as a gaol, a munitions store, a lodge, an advertising hoarding, a focus for celebrations and, most significantly, as a toll gate. Much of the medieval development of Monmouth was funded by the taxes and tolls the borough was entitled to raise through Royal Charter. The tolls were collected through control of the points of entry to the town, including the gatehouse on Monnow Bridge.|$|E

40|$|Over {{the past}} years the United States Department of Agriculture - Forest Products Laboratory and the Federal Highway Administration have {{supported}} several research programs. This thesis {{is a result}} of a study sponsored by the Forest Products Laboratory, with the objective of determining how truckloads are distributed to the structural members of glued-laminated <b>timber</b> <b>bridges.</b> Glued-laminated <b>timber</b> girder <b>bridges</b> with glued-laminated <b>timber</b> deck panels and longitudinal glued-laminated <b>timber</b> deck <b>bridges</b> were the focus of this paper.

25|$|At Ongaroto {{the company}} built a large <b>timber</b> <b>bridge</b> of locally sourced totara, {{designed}} by Public Works Department engineer Frederick Furkert. In later years this <b>timber</b> <b>bridge</b> deteriorated and was condemned, {{but the company}} {{could not afford to}} replace it immediately because its sawmill had burned down in 1928. In the last few years of service, trains arriving at the bridge would stop and the passengers and fireman would walk across while the driver gently opened the throttle and then jumped off. The train would slowly ease across the bridge before being stopped on the other side by the fireman, where everyone would reboard the train. This bridge was replaced in 1931 by a steel truss bridge with a central pier.|$|E

The Baltimore and Liberty Turnpike ran {{from the city of}} Baltimore west to the Patapsco River. This turnpike was surveyed and reconstructed in 1861, at which time the turnpike's original bridge over Gwynns Falls was repaired.

25|$|As well as tunnels, {{bridgework}} was a {{major element}} of the construction work on the second section. The total length of steel required to complete the bridgework was around 800 feet (244m). The steel work was all cut, fitted and partly riveted by Walkers Ltd of Maryborough. In 2011 the steel bridges between Redlynch and Kuranda included: six with lattice girders; plus Bridge 42 (1890), where fishbelly plate cross- girders have been reused as main span members; Bridge 50 over Mervyn Creek (which replaced an earlier <b>timber</b> <b>bridge</b> in the 1920s); and Jumrum Creek Bridge (Bridge 51), which although mainly timber has a steel central span (the bridge was reconstructed in 1962). There were also five very short steel bridges by 2011. About 1.5km past Kuranda is Crooked Creek Bridge, which in about 1900 reused (shortened) plate girders from the 1867 Bridge 51 on the Main Range. The bridge has been strengthened with new steel piers {{either side of the}} concrete pier, and its replacement steel cross girders also originally came from Bridge 51 on the Main Range.|$|E
25|$|One {{feature of}} {{interest}} {{near the beginning of}} section two is Horseshoe Bend, located after the third <b>timber</b> <b>bridge</b> from Redlynch. In December 1888 the embankment at the bend was described as 51 feet (15.5m) high, 15 feet (4.6m) wide at the top, and 170 feet (51.8m) wide at the base, and was sown with Couch grass (Cynodon dactylon) on the sides. The embankment has since been widened using landslide material. Section two used Horseshoe Bend to gain height, followed by the line ascending to the top of Barron Falls. The section then followed the Barron River to Kuranda, terminating at Myola, almost 3km past Kuranda. Nineteen tunnels had been originally planned between Horseshoe Bend and Barron Falls Station, but four (two between Stoney Creek and Tunnel 14 and two at Red Bluff) were subsequently replaced by cuttings. Sand from the bed of the Barron River was used as the base material for concrete work on the second section; all the tunnels were concrete lined, and culverts and drains were also built in concrete.|$|E
25|$|MD 290's <b>timber</b> <b>bridge</b> {{across the}} Chester River had been {{proposed}} for replacement {{as early as}} 1942, and Queen Anne's County requested funds for the 3-year post-war construction program {{be applied to the}} replacement bridge. The new steel beam and concrete bridge at Crumpton was built in 1951 and 1952. The highway from MD 300 to the new Crumpton bridge was reconstructed, widened, and surfaced with bituminous concrete in 1956 and 1957. As part of the relocation and reconstruction of MD 313 at Irelands Corner in 1956 and 1957, the portion of MD 290 between Irelands Corner Road (which became MD 801) and modern MD 313 was constructed. The portion of MD 290 between the Chester River and Irelands Corner Roadexcept for the MD 291 concurrency, which had been reconstructed in 1962 and 1963was resurfaced with bituminous concrete in 1971. MD 290's two interchanges with the Blue Star Memorial Highway (originally MD 71 and now US 301) were both built in 1954 and 1955. In both cases, a single bridge was built at each interchange, as the highway was originally built as one carriageway of an ultimate divided highway. The southbound bridge was built at the Kent County interchange in 1962 and 1963 and at the Queen Anne's County junction in 1966 and 1967.|$|E

25|$|From Redlynch Station, {{the railway}} line heads south past Jungara to Horseshoe Bend, before heading {{north along the}} eastern side of the Lamb Range and turning west into Stoney Creek Gorge. Between Redlynch and Stoney Creek Station there are 13 tunnels and 16 bridges. The first bridge (deck type) is located at a {{distance}} of 12.06km from Cairns. It uses timber girders on timber trestles (some trestle piles and headstocks have already been replaced with steel); this is the form used by the majority of timber bridges on the section, although some use single-span timber girders between concrete abutments. A second <b>timber</b> <b>bridge,</b> with a concrete pier, exists at 13.05km. The site of Jungara Station is passed at 13.82km, with a timber trestle bridge at 14.77km, just before Horseshoe Bend, a 5 chain curve with a large earth embankment. There are two more timber trestle bridges at 15.31km and 16.55km, plus a single span timber girder bridge between concrete abutments at 16.95km, before reaching the first tunnel at 17.12km. Tunnel 1 is concrete lined (as are all the tunnels), straight and 66m long. Tunnel 2, located at 18.42km, is straight with a left curve at the uphill end and 76m long; while Tunnel 3 is at 19.11km (curve left, then straight, 109m).|$|E

500|$|The castle sits roughly in {{the middle}} of the moat.

The island in the moat is called the Octagon, and excavations on it have uncovered a garderobe (toilet), suggesting that there may have been a guard on the island, although it is unclear to what extent it was fortified.

The use of non-destructive testing methods and structural health monitoring is highlighted with regard to collecting useful information for maintenance decisions.
