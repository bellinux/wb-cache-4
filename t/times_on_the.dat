40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with spatial effects of <b>time</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> market for residential property and time varying relationships using a dataset of properties from the Adelaide metropolitan area, Australia, during the period 2002 – 2011. The analysis firstly considers the spatial dependence in <b>time</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> market and secondly extends the analysis to a space-time model using 2 SLS regression. The findings demonstrate the complexity in spatial analysis with results indicating a random distribution of <b>time</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> market in 86 % of observations a pattern that is consistent over time. Spatial autocorrelation is shown to increase <b>time</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> market in the subject property while spatial error decreases <b>time</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> market in the subject property suggesting {{a high level of}} market transparency and improved liquidity. The compensating or nullifying effects of both types of spatial association is shown to contribute to the random distribution observed in <b>time</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> market. A strong explanatory capacity of the business cycle suggests that economic drivers are leading <b>time</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> market rather than prices...|$|R

Furthermore, seller <b>time</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> market and homes visited are much more sensitive to demand growth than its level, consistent with sellers responding to demand with a lag.
