The colonist observes the creation of the very first soul, known as the Universal Migrator. It is from this soul that all others are formed, through a division of the original soul.

2500|$|At {{the urging}} of Charles Cathers' parents, {{the family moved to}} Nebraska in 1883 when Willa was nine years old. The rich, flat {{farmland}} appealed to Charles' father, and the family wished to escape the tuberculosis outbreaks that were rampant in Virginia. Willa's father tried his hand at farming for eighteen months; then he moved the family into the town of Red Cloud, where he opened a real estate and insurance business, and the children attended school for the first time. Some of the earliest work produced by Cather was first published in the Red Cloud Chief, the city's local paper. Cather's time in the western state, still on the frontier, was a deeply formative experience for her. She was intensely moved by the dramatic environment and weather, the vastness of the Nebraska prairie, and the various cultures of the European-American, immigrant and Native American families in the area. Like Jim Burden in My Antonia, the young Willa Cather saw the Nebraska frontier as a [...] "place where <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>but</b> land: not a country at all, but the materials out of which countries were made...Between that earth and that sky I felt erased, blotted out".|$|E
2500|$|LaGrange County's initial {{settlers}} were Yankee immigrants, {{that is to}} {{say they}} were from New England and were descended from the English Puritans who settled that region in the colonial era. [...] They were part of a wave of New England settlers moving west into what was then the Northwest Territory after the completion of the Erie Canal. [...] The original settlers in LaPorte County specifically hailed from the Massachusetts counties of Worcester County, Suffolk County and Berkshire County; the Connecticut counties of Hartford County and Windham County as well as the Connecticut towns of Sherman, Lebanon and Fairfield; and from the Vermont towns of Burlington, Brookfield, Huntington and Grand Isle. [...] They were mainly members of the Congregational Church, but {{as a result of the}} Second Great Awakening many became Baptists and many also converted to Pentecostalism and Methodism. [...] When they arrived in what is now LaGrange County, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>but</b> virgin forest and wild prairie, the New England settlers cleared roads, built farms, constructed churches, erected government buildings, and established post routes. [...] As a result of this migration, LaGrange County was culturally continuous with early New England culture for many years.|$|E
2500|$|After {{the final}} AP Poll, Michigan {{went on to}} beat USC in the 1948 Rose Bowl, a greater margin that by which Notre Dame had beaten USC (38-7). Michigan's 490 victory was the largest margin of victory ever against a USC team and the most points scored in Rose Bowl history.

While for the most part hedging from a comparison of Michigan with Notre Dame, the consensus of the scribes was that the offensive-minded Ann Arbor squad deserved no less than a co-rating with the Irish as America's Number One Collegiate eleven." [...] Grantland Rice, the dean of the nation's sports writers, wrote of Michigan: [...] "It is the best all-around college football team I've seen this year.

2500|$|Before the {{existence}} of the Universe, Roog existed by itself. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>but</b> silence and darkness. The Serer notion of balance and perfection illustrates the creation of the higher spiritual order and corresponds to the motif of chaos. Its creation was the union of male and female principles, with Roog, the supreme transcendental principle entity, becoming the embodiment of an androgynous Godfather and Godmother. However, it is from the female component of the supreme being: [...] "Noo tiig tew" [...] ("out of a female womb" [...] - ex utero), that the divine brought forth the ancestors of modern humans, with a female, being the first to be created. There was a mythical speech − the first word uttered by the supreme being. All the competing versions [...] attest to that. This myth is the general consensus and represents the absolute truth in Serer primordial time. A major competing myth, also based on chaos, postulates that, there was originally a series of explosions. However, it agrees pretty much with the accepted view that trees and animals were the first to be created. Explosion first arose in the vegetable kingdom and the first tree Somb, according to this myth, bursted, which the seeds of all the plant species in the world sprang out (from its trunk) covering Planet Earth with life. In all versions, Roog appears as both the creator and demiurge.|$|E

Although hired in August to set up a southern bureau for CBS in New Orleans, Rather had only recently moved from Dallas to New Orleans in November [...] and would not have been in Dallas except for the need to get film to Dallas CBS affiliate KRLD-TV (now KDFW) to feed to New York. Although he had no assigned reporting role in Dallas, Rather says he happened to be [...] "on {{the other side of the}} railroad tracks, beyond the triple underpass, thirty yards from a grassy knoll that would later figure in so many conspiracy theories." [...] His job was to fetch a film drop from a camera truck at that location and take it to the station for editing. He did not witness or hear the shooting, he said. He heard nothing of what may have caused the commotion until he reached KRLD, running all the way through Dealey Plaza, [...] "The moment I cleared the railroad tracks I saw a scene I will never forget.

2500|$|The Greek {{historian}} Herodotus instead depicts Khufu as a heretic {{and cruel}} tyrant.

But after him Khéops became king over them and brought them to every kind of suffering: He closed all the temples; after this he kept the priests from sacrificing there and then he forced all the Egyptians to work for him. So some were ordered to draw stones from the stone quarries in the Arabian mountains to the Nile, and others he forced to receive the stones after they had been carried over the river in boats, and to draw them to those called the Libyan mountains. And they worked by 100,000men at a time, for each three months continually. Of this oppression there passed ten years while the causeway was made by which they drew the stones, which causeway they built, {{and it is a}} work not much less, as it appears to me, than the pyramid. For the length of it is 5furlongs and the breadth 10fathoms and the height, where it is highest, 8fathoms, and it is made of polished stone and with figures carved upon it. For this, they said, 10years were spent, and for the underground chambers on the hill upon which the pyramids stand, which he caused to be made as sepulchral chambers for himself in an island, having conducted thither a channel from the Nile.|$|E

2500|$|More {{orders were}} {{received}} at 3pm {{to move to}} Varesnes on the south bank of the River Oise but whilst en-route they were countermanded with surprise orders to counter attack and retake a village called Babouef. Therefore, the war worn Brigade who had been fighting and marching for four punishing days solid were about faced and moved off to the attack with an enthusiasm that {{is nothing short of}} incredible. By rights, the Brigade should have been incapable of the action yet those quoted as being there remark that it was the most memorable event of the entire rearguard action. At 5pm, with the Fusiliers on the right, the Bedfords on the left and the Northamptons in reserve, the Brigade formed up with the Babouef to Compeigne road on their right and the southern edge of the woods above Babouef to their left. The Germans had not expected a British counter attack, thinking <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>but</b> ragged French units in their area, so were surprised at the arrival of three small but determined British battalions. They put little fight up and many Germans fell in the hand to hand fighting that lasted for around [...] before the village was secured and the remaining enemy – that could get away – fled. Ten machine guns and [...] prisoners were taken with very light casualties recorded by the Brigade; an incredible feat whatever way you view it. They dug in on the German side of the village amongst the cornfields and settled in for the night.

Unfortunately, their rest did not last long.|$|E
