5|$|Two of <b>the</b> <b>Mole</b> {{sides are}} sloped whilst the {{south-east}} face is vertically walled.

The former hoist brick-faced plinths are still present (2017) around the north-west and east faces as are those {{on the rest of}} the two docks. In the twilight years of tanker unloading for the William Cory (Powell Duffryn) oilworks, short footbridges were provided from <b>the</b> <b>Mole</b> for works staff to access the brick plinths for the purpose of handling the flexible tanker oil discharge piping and supports and it was not unknown for rail tank wagons to be in use on the siding serving the north-west Mole face.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> Detached <b>Mole</b> was {{constructed}} of concrete blocks, each weighing 28 tons. The wall was built upon {{a foundation of}} rubble stone that was first deposited by barges and then leveled by divers before {{the placement of the}} concrete blocks. <b>The</b> Detached <b>Mole</b> was begun before 1888 and completed in 1901. It is of more recent vintage than <b>the</b> South <b>Mole</b> which was first constructed in the early seventeenth century (1620) as <b>the</b> New <b>Mole,</b> to distinguish it from <b>the</b> Old <b>Mole.</b> <b>The</b> North <b>Mole,</b> formerly known as <b>the</b> Commercial <b>Mole,</b> was a {{late nineteenth and early twentieth}} century extension of <b>the</b> Old <b>Mole</b> (begun in 1618) and its extension, the Devil's Tonque (constructed 1779-1783).|$|R

5|$|Reality TV was {{a popular}} genre of {{television}} programming in the UK in 2002. The third series of the UK version of Big Brother—which was showing while Russian's con took place—attracted audience figures of approximately 5.8million.

For example, the 2000 series Jailbreak challenged a group to escape from a mock prison, while the 2001 series <b>The</b> <b>Mole</b> gave the contestants the task of discovering which of them was sabotaging their attempts to win money.

5|$|A. macrodactylum is {{a member}} of the Ambystomatidae, also known as <b>the</b> <b>mole</b> salamanders. The Ambystomatidae {{originated}} approximately 81 million years ago (late Cretaceous) from its sister taxon Dicamptodontidae. The Ambystomatidae are also members of suborder Salamandroidea, which includes all the salamanders capable of internal fertilization. The sister species to A.macrodactylum is A. laterale, distributed in eastern North America. However, the species-level phylogeny for Ambystomatidae is tentative and in need of further testing.|$|E
5|$|After her {{overhaul}} {{was completed}} in June 1944, the ship resumed her former duties in the Skagerrak, although the repairs required after another boiler room fire in August necessitated lengthy repairs in Oslo. She was damaged after colliding with <b>the</b> <b>mole</b> in Frederikshavn, Denmark, on 18 November and became operational again on 7 January 1945. Theodor Riedel remained in Southern Norway and Denmark until the ships there were ordered into the Baltic {{to assist with the}} evacuation of the Hel Peninsula on 5 May. After unloading the refugees in Copenhagen, she made another voyage to Hela and returned to Copenhagen on 7 May. The crew surrendered in Kiel three days later.|$|E
