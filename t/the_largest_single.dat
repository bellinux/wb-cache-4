40|$|The soybean {{chloroplast}} psb A gene (photosystem II thylakoid {{membrane protein}} of Mr 32 000, lysine-free) and the trn H gene (tRNAHisGUG), which both map in <b>the</b> <b>large</b> <b>single</b> copy region adjacent {{to one of}} the inverted repeat structures (IR 1), have been sequenced including flanking regions. The psb A gene shows in its structural part 92 % sequence homology with the corresponding genes of spinach and N. debneyi and contains also an open reading frame for 353 aminoacids. The aminoacid sequence of a potential primary translation product (calculated Mr, 38 904, no lysine) diverges from that of spinach and N. debneyi in only two positions in the C-terminal part. The trn H gene has the same polarity as the psb A gene and the coding region is located {{at the very end of}} <b>the</b> <b>large</b> <b>single</b> copy region. <b>The</b> deduced sequence of the soybean chloroplast tRNAHisGUG is identical with that of Zea mays chloroplasts.

5|$|A {{few of the}} {{closely related}} mites also infest humans, some causing intense itching by their bites and others by {{burrowing}} into the skin.

Mites cause several forms of allergic diseases, including hay fever, asthma and eczema, and they aggravate atopic dermatitis. Mites are also significant crop pests, although predatory mites {{may be useful in}} controlling some of these.|$|E

The Federal Reserve Bank of New York organized a bailout of US$3.625billion by the hedge fund's major creditors to avoid a wider collapse in the financial markets.

In the aftermath of the LTCM collapse, Mathis Cabiallavetta resigned as chairman of UBS, along with three other executives.|$|E
5|$|By far <b>the</b> <b>largest</b> <b>single</b> {{cost was}} the {{purchase}} of the ship Terra Nova, for £12,500. Terra Nova had been in Antarctica before, as part of the second Discovery relief operation. Scott wanted to sail her as a Naval vessel under the White Ensign; to enable this, he obtained membership of the Royal Yacht Squadron for the sum of £100. He was thus able to impose Naval discipline on the expedition, and as a registered yacht of the Squadron, Terra Nova became exempt from Board of Trade regulations which might otherwise have deemed her unfit to sail.|$|E
