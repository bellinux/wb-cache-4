5|$|Before {{joining the}} Football League, Arsenal played briefly on Plumstead Common, {{then at the}} Manor Ground in Plumstead, then spent three years between 1890 and 1893 at the nearby Invicta Ground. Upon joining the Football League in 1893, the club {{returned}} to the Manor Ground and installed stands and terracing, upgrading it from just a field. Arsenal continued to play their home games there for <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>twenty</b> <b>years</b> (with two exceptions in the 1894–95 season), until the move to north London in 1913.|$|E

40|$|UrbanLab is a {{computer}} system supporting urban and regional design. The papers outlines two leading aspects of this large research project, aimed respectively to make explicit the dynamic of the design in its time and geographic dimensions, and to interactively represent the interplay of some, explicitly, recognised factors, for instance {{the role of a}} multitude of different (local) actors in the design process. UrbanLab has been applied to several projects at different scales. We consider the applications to dynamically and interactively generating models of an Alpine valley.

5|$|The African {{art museum}} took a {{scholarly}} direction over <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>twenty</b> <b>years,</b> with less social programming. It collected traditional and contemporary works of historical importance. Exhibitions include works {{both internal and}} borrowed, and have ranged from solo artist to broad, survey shows. The museum hosts two to three temporary exhibitions and ten special events annually. Reviewers criticized the National Mall building's architecture, particularly its lack of natural light. The museum is scheduled for remodeling {{as part of the}} Smithsonian's upcoming South Mall project.|$|E
5|$|The Democrats' success {{continued}} down the ballot. Meehan {{did not run}} for re-election, and the race for county sheriff pitted two incumbent city councilmen against {{each other for the}} job: Democrat William M. Lennox and Republican Cornelius S. Deegan, Jr. The office of sheriff was another holdover county office. The sheriff, whose job differed from that of the chief of police, was the chief law enforcement officer of the court. Lennox came out ahead, and would hold the job for <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>twenty</b> <b>years.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{first showing}} of {{films in the}} Dutch East Indies was in 1900, and over <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>twenty</b> <b>years</b> foreign productions– {{generally}} from the United States– were imported and shown throughout the country.

5|$|As {{noted by}} a {{historical}} marker {{on the large}} hill in Central Campus, the site occupied by the school's first buildings once held fortifications built to protect Atlanta during the Atlanta Campaign of the American Civil War. The surrender of the city {{took place on the}} southwestern boundary of the modern Georgia Tech campus in 1864. <b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>twenty</b> <b>years</b> were a time of rapid industrial expansion; during this period, Georgia's manufacturing capital, railroad track mileage, and property values would each increase by a factor of three to four.|$|E
5|$|The next year, Dow met {{his future}} wife, Maria Cornelia Maynard, the {{daughter}} of a Massachusetts merchant. They married on January 20, 1830. Over <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>twenty</b> <b>years,</b> they had nine children, five of whom (two sons and three daughters) survived infancy. Maria Cornelia was a Congregationalist, and Dow attended services with her at Second Parish Church regularly, although he never became a member. Their home, built at 714 Congress Street in Portland in 1829, still stands and is now a museum memorializing Dow's life and administered by the local chapter of the Women's Christian Temperance Union.|$|E
5|$|During the war Vaughan Williams stopped writing music, {{and after}} {{returning}} to civilian life he took some time before feeling ready to compose new works. He revised some earlier pieces, and {{turned his attention to}} other musical activities. In 1919 he accepted an invitation from Hugh Allen, who had succeeded Parry as director, to teach composition at the RCM; he remained on the faculty of the college for <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>twenty</b> <b>years.</b> In 1921 he succeeded Allen as conductor of the Bach Choir, London. It was not until 1922 that he produced a major new composition, A Pastoral Symphony; the work was given its first performance in London in May conducted by Adrian Boult and its American premiere in New York in December conducted by the composer.|$|E

5|$|Feth-i Bülend saw action {{during the}} Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878, where she battled the Russian steamer Vesta in an {{inconclusive}} engagement. The Ottoman fleet was laid up {{for most of}} <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>twenty</b> <b>years,</b> and Feth-i Bülend saw no activity during this period. Modernized in 1890, she was nevertheless still not in condition for active service at {{the outbreak of the}} Greco-Turkish War in 1897. She was therefore heavily rebuilt in Germany between 1903 and 1907. At the start of the First Balkan War in 1912, the ship was stationed in Thessaloniki; the ship was disarmed so the guns could be used to strengthen the port's fortifications. On the night of 31 October, a Greek torpedo boat slipped into the harbor and sank Feth-i Bülend, killing seven of her crew.|$|E
5|$|The elder Roddenberry {{became a}} patrolman, and held that rank for <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>twenty</b> <b>years.</b> The family {{expanded}} {{with the birth}} of Robert Leon Roddenberry in 1924, and Doris Willodean Roddenberry in 1925. During this time, the Roddenberrys bought their first home at 3243 Drew Street. During Gene's early years, he was saved by a quick thinking milkman who noticed that the house was on fire. He pounded on the door until Glen awoke and rushed out of the house with the children in tow. Roddenberry's father kept rabbits, and the children sold them outside the house. It was these animals that became the subject of Roddenberry's first published work in his school's twice-yearly newspaper, The Ace. During his childhood, Roddenberry was interested in reading, especially pulp magazines, and was a fan of stories such as John Carter of Mars, Tarzan, and the Skylark series by E. E. Smith.|$|E
5|$|The ships {{remained}} in the Austro-Hungarian fleet for <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>twenty</b> <b>years,</b> but severely reduced naval budgets owing to Hungarian disinterest in naval matters led to an uneventful career. In 1870, Habsburg was used {{in a show of}} force to try to prevent the Italian annexation of Rome while the city's protector, France, was distracted with the Franco-Prussian War, though the Italians took the city regardless. They were rearmed with newer guns in 1874 and again in 1882. Both ships were converted for secondary duties in 1886, Erzherzog Ferdinand Max becoming a tender to the gunnery training school from 1889 to 1908, while Habsburg was employed as a guard ship and a barracks ship in Pola until 1898, when she was stricken from the naval register and sold for scrap. Erzherzog Ferdinand Max {{remained in}} the inventory until 1916 when she too was broken up for scrap.|$|E
50|$|He {{subsequently}} {{served in}} the Central Tibetan Administration in numerous capacities. He was the longest serving representative of the Dalai Lama, being first appointed in Nepal, in May 1986and remaining in office for <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>twenty</b> one <b>years</b> until his formal retirement from public service in 2007. During that period Chope Paljor Tsering represented the Dalai Lama in Eastern Europe, Australasia and East Asia.|$|R

50|$|The Riksdag of 1738 was to mark a turning-point in Swedish history, the Hats carried {{everything}} before them, and {{the aged}} Horn was finally compelled {{to retire from}} a scene where, for thirty-three years, he had played a leading part. For <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>twenty</b> five <b>years</b> <b>the</b> Hats did dominate government, with disastrous results where the country was plunged into two costly and ill-advised wars.|$|R
5|$|It {{was at this}} battle, {{regardless}} of exactly when and where this occurred, that a defining moment of Epaminondas's early life would happen. Epaminondas saved the life of his fellow Theban Pelopidas; Pelopidas, after receiving seven wounds in front, sank down upon a great heap of friends and enemies who lay dead together; but Epaminondas, although he thought him lifeless, stood forth to defend his body and his arms, and fought desperately, single-handed against many, determined to die rather than leave Pelopidas lying there. And now he too was in a sorry plight, having been wounded in the breast with a spear and in the arm with a sword, when Agesipolis the Spartan king came to his aid from the other wing, and when all hope was lost, saved them both. Plutarch says that this incident firmly cemented their friendship, and Pelopidas would be Epaminondas's partner in politics for <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>twenty</b> <b>years.</b>|$|E
5|$|The continual warring {{with the}} Cholas {{exhausted}} both empires, giving their subordinates {{the opportunity to}} rebel. In the decades after Vikramaditya VI's death in 1126, the empire steadily decreased in size as their powerful feudatories expanded in autonomy and territorial command. The time period between 1150 and 1200 saw many hard fought battles between the Chalukyas and their feudatories who were also at war with each other. By the time of Jagadhekamalla II, the Chalukyas had lost control of Vengi and his successor, Tailapa III, was defeated by the Kakatiya king Prola in 1149. Tailapa III was taken captive and later released bringing down {{the prestige of the}} Western Chalukyas. Seeing decadence and uncertainty seeping into Chalukya rule, the Hoysalas and Seunas also encroached upon the empire. Hoysala Narasimha I defeated and killed Tailapa III but was unable to overcome the Kalachuris who were vying for control of the same region. In 1157 the Kalachuris of Kalyanis under Bijjala II captured Kalyani and occupied it for <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>twenty</b> <b>years,</b> forcing the Chalukyas to move their capital to Annigeri in the present day Dharwad district.|$|E
5|$|These fashions {{permeated}} noble households, where resident musicians were employed, including viol and lute players. As {{elsewhere in}} Europe, musical ability {{became one of}} the major achievements expected of a nobleman or woman. Musicians were clearly employed as teachers for the children of the household, both male and female. There is evidence for the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries of lessons being given in a variety of instruments and singing, and of the purchase of sheet music and instruments (including the virginals and harpsichords). In the Highlands clan chiefs continued to employ harpists, and increasingly, pipers as fili and bards, whose prowess and ability to glorify their ancestors was a key element in underlying a clan's status and heritage into the seventeenth century. The earliest printed collection of secular music in Scotland was by publisher John Forbes in Aberdeen in 1662. Songs and Fancies: to Thre, Foure, or Five Partes, both Apt for Voices and Viols, known as Forbes' Cantus, was printed three times in <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>twenty</b> <b>years.</b> It contained 77 songs, of which 25 were of Scottish origin.|$|E
40|$|A {{prediction}} of <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>twenty</b> <b>year</b> under a re-elected Barack Obama: an Obama victory {{has the potential}} to inspire increased community involvement and shift some policy making. It comes {{with a great deal of}} individual and collective exertion and no small amount of luck. These institutional forces can create, at best, moderately positive outcomes. The alternative to an Obama victory is a future barely worth contemplation. However, there are problematic aspects to Obama 2 ̆ 7 s leadership. These aspects will continue to work at the disadvantage for the vast majority of Americans as well as global powers. Aggressive foreign policy and the curtailing of individual freedom is the disastrous hallmark of the American presidency, and it is not limited to Obama. Rather, the current power structure and economic drives reinforce institutional and global inequalities. Never trust a person who has an intimate knowledge of policy development and still wants to go into politics...|$|R
