Vibrational entropies of alloying and alloy formation were calculated for 32 binary alloys and intermetallic compounds using phonon DOS curves taken from the literature. The vibrational entropies of formation span a wide range from - 0. 64 to + 0. 55 kB/atom, and the vibrational entropies of alloying ranged from - 0. 39 to + 1. 0 kB/atom. This range exceeds the range of configurational entropy of a binary alloy, which reaches a maximum value of + 0. 69 kB/atom and a minimum value of 0 k B /atom. <b>The</b> <b>vibrational</b> <b>entropy</b> <b>of</b> the NiTi martensitic transition was measured using low-temperature calorimetry and inelastic neutron-scattering. The high-temperature B 2 phase of NiTi has a vibrational entropy 0. 5 k B /atom larger than the low-temperature martensitic phase. The difference in vibrational entropy accounts for the total entropy of the austenitic-martensitic phase transition. Inelastic neutron scattering was used to show that the phonon DOS of V is unchanged between 20 and 1000 °C, inconsistent with the phonon softening expected from thermal expansion. It is found that the effects of volume expansion and rising temperature exert equal and opposite shifts on the phonon DOS.

40|$|Introduction Approaches to protein {{structure}} prediction {{are based on}} the thermodynamic hypothesis, which postulates that the native state of a protein is the state of lowest free energy under physiological conditions. Normally, this state corresponds to the lowest basin of the effective energy surface. The term `effective energy' or `potential of mean force' refers to the free energy of the system (protein plus solvent) for a fixed protein conformation; that is, it consists of the intramolecular energy of the protein plus the solvation free energy [1, 2]. Although <b>the</b> <b>vibrational</b> <b>entropy</b> <b>of</b> the folded state is large [3], it is approximately equal to that of a single unfolded conformer [4, 5]. The large stabilizing entropy of the unfolded `state' arises from the multitude of conformers of similar energy that contributes to it. It has been suggested that the native state is surrounded by an ensemble of similar conformations [6]. This appears to be true for a protein like a-lactalbumin, w...|$|E
40|$|The segregation, thermodynamic, and {{structural}} properties of [001] twist boundaries in Cu [...] -Ni alloys {{have been examined}} within {{a wide range of}} misorientations and temperatures. Cu always segregates to the boundary. The concentration of the first layer adjacent to the boundary increases monotonically with misorientation and no obvious cusps are observed. All other thermodynamic properties vary smoothly with the misorientation, with the exception of <b>the</b> <b>vibrational</b> <b>entropy</b> <b>of</b> the boundaries without segregation. The unsegregated vibrational entropy shows a large peak at the misorientation corresponding to the [Sigma] 17 boundary and two minima around the [Sigma] 13 and [Sigma] 5 boundary orientations. The concentration distribution within the plane of the grain boundaries can be described by the same structural unit model established for [001] twist boundaries in pure materials. Regions of large tensile stress show greater segregation than do regions of compressive stress. Regions of large shear stress tend to show reduced segragation compared with regions of small shear stress...|$|E
40|$|High-temperature advance-reactor {{design and}} {{operation}} require knowledge of in-reactor materials properties {{far from the}} thermal ground state. Temperature-dependence due {{to the effects of}} lattice vibrations is important to the understanding and formulation of atomic processes involved in irradiation-damage accumulation. In this paper, we concentrate on the formation of He-V complex. The free-energy change in this regard is derived via thermodynamic integration from the phase-space trajectories generated from MD simulations based on the quantum fluctuation-dissipation relation. The change of frequency distribution of vibration modes during the complex formation is properly accounted for, and the corresponding entropy change avoids the classical ln(T) divergence that violates the third law. <b>The</b> <b>vibrational</b> enthalpy and <b>entropy</b> <b>of</b> formation calculated this way have significant effects on the He kinetics during irradiation.

40|$|Inelastic neutron-scattering spectra were {{measured}} {{to obtain the}} phonon density of states (DOS) of nanocrystalline fcc Ni 3 Fe. The materials were prepared by mechanical alloying, and were also subjected to heat treatments to alter their crystallite sizes and internal strains. In comparison to material with large crystallites, the nanocrystalline material shows two distinct differences in its phonon DOS. The nanocrystalline DOS was {{more than twice as}} large at energies below 15 meV. This increase was approximately proportional to the density of grain boundaries in the material. Second, features in the nanocrystalline DOS are broadened substantially. This broadening did not depend in a simple way on the crystallite size of the sample, suggesting that it has a different physical origin than the enhancement in phonon DOS at energies below 15 meV. A damped harmonic oscillator model for the phonons provides a quality factor Qu, as low as 7 for phonons in the nanocrystalline material. <b>The</b> difference in <b>vibrational</b> <b>entropy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bulk and nanocrystalline Ni 3 Fe was small, owing to competing changes in the nanocrystalline phonon DOS at low and high energies...|$|R
40|$|The {{phase diagram}} of model {{anisotropic}} particles with four attractive patches in a tetrahedral arrangement has been computed at two different {{values for the}} range of the potential, with the aim of investigating the conditions under which a diamond crystal can be formed. We find that the diamond phase is never stable for our longer-ranged potential. At low temperatures and pressures, the fluid freezes into a body-centred-cubic solid that can be viewed as two interpenetrating diamond lattices with a weak interaction between the two sublattices. Upon compression, an orientationally ordered face-centred-cubic crystal becomes more stable than the body-centred-cubic crystal, and at higher temperatures a plastic face-centered-cubic phase is stabilized by the increased entropy due to orientational disorder. A similar phase diagram is found for the shorter-ranged potential, but at low temperatures and pressures, we also find a region over which the diamond phase is thermodynamically favored over the body-centred-cubic phase. <b>The</b> higher <b>vibrational</b> <b>entropy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> diamond structure with respect to the body-centred-cubic solid explains why it is stable even though the enthalpy of the latter phase is lower. Some preliminary studies on the growth of the diamond structure starting from a crystal seed were performed. Even though the diamond phase is never thermodynamically stable for the longer-ranged model, direct coexistence simulations of the interface between the fluid and the body-centred-cubic crystal and between the fluid and the diamond crystal show that, at sufficiently low pressures, it is quite probable that in both cases the solid grows into a diamond crystal, albeit involving some defects. These results highlight the importance of kinetic effects in the formation of diamond crystals in systems of patchy particles. Comment: 15 pages, 13 figure...|$|R
