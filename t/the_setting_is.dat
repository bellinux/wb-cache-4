5|$|The ride is themed {{around a}} series of unexplainable occurrences in the Town of Gold Rush which {{date back to the}} late 1800s. <b>The</b> <b>setting</b> <b>is</b> based on {{encounters}} with the ghost of one Jack Darke, who was killed by a buzz saw at a sawmill built after the gold rush ended.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>setting</b> <b>is</b> {{the home}} of several iconic {{characters}} popularized by authors, including Elminster the wizard, who has appeared in several series of novels created by Greenwood himself, and Drizzt Do'Urden, the highly popular Drow, or dark elf, ranger created by R. A. Salvatore.|$|E
5|$|The third Tom Swift series {{differs from}} the first two in that <b>the</b> <b>setting</b> <b>is</b> {{primarily}} outer space, although Swift Enterprises (located now in New Mexico) is occasionally mentioned. Tom Swift explores the universe in the starship Exedra, using a faster-than-light drive he has reverse-engineered from an alien space probe. He is aided by Benjamin Franklin Walking Eagle, a Native American who is Tom's co-pilot, best friend, and an expert computer technician, and Anita Thorwald, a former rival of Tom's who now works with him as a technician and whose right leg has been rebuilt to contain a miniature computer.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> {{infusion}} <b>set</b> must <b>be</b> replaced regularly, usually every 2-3 days. Insulin absorption {{becomes less}} effective <b>the</b> longer <b>the</b> <b>set</b> <b>is</b> left in place, leading to poorer control of blood glucose. For this reason, {{the site of}} <b>the</b> infusion <b>set</b> <b>is</b> moved when <b>the</b> <b>set</b> <b>is</b> changed. Often a number of favorite sites for <b>the</b> infusion <b>set</b> <b>are</b> used on a rotation basis.|$|R
50|$|For {{the first}} seven seasons <b>the</b> <b>set</b> <b>was</b> in Bordeaux and from season 8 onward <b>the</b> <b>set</b> <b>is</b> in Nice.|$|R
50|$|GEC and British Rail Engineering Limited {{were awarded}} the {{design-build}} contract, and <b>the</b> <b>sets</b> <b>were</b> assembled at York in 1976. Throughout 1978 <b>the</b> <b>sets</b> <b>were</b> delivered to Taiwan for testing and acceptance.|$|R
5|$|Despite the game's {{expanded}} memory resources, reviewers {{felt that the}} game's visuals were only marginally—if at all—better than for contemporary games, such as the previous year's Banjo-Kazooie. In fact, IGN felt that Donkey Kong 64 was not as pretty as Banjo-Kazooie, especially in its water and backgrounds, though it still ranked among the console's prettiest games. <b>The</b> <b>setting</b> <b>is</b> barren and nondescript at first, and only later introduces lighting effects and richer textures. IGN hoped for more from Rare, and while its reviewer praised the game's particle effects (e.g., in the desert wind), he considered the game's dynamic lighting overused. N64 Magazine said that the enhanced effects were most often used for decoration, though they also played some role in puzzles based on illuminating paths. Reviewers noted graphical difficulties even with the extra memory, such as frame rate slowdowns and distant features not appearing in any detail, though overall they considered the added graphical flourishes commendable. GameSpot also saw a lack of variety in the game's environment.|$|E
25|$|Since Ubuntu 16.04, <b>the</b> <b>setting</b> <b>is</b> off by default.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>setting</b> <b>is</b> {{shifted from}} the 1960s to the 1930s, in {{accordance}} with the other episodes in the series.|$|E
40|$|We {{present an}} {{efficient}} parameterized algorithm solving <b>the</b> <b>Set</b> Packing problem, {{in which we}} assume that the size of <b>the</b> <b>sets</b> <b>is</b> bounded by m. In particular, if the size m of <b>the</b> <b>sets</b> <b>is</b> bounded by a constant, then our algorithm is fixed-parameter tractable. For example, if the size of <b>the</b> <b>sets</b> <b>is</b> bounded by 3, then our algorithm runs in time O((5. 7 k) kn).

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>sets</b> <b>were</b> {{formed from}} three basic types of car: motor car, kitchen car and parlour car. The cars were {{permanently}} coupled and hermetically sealed for {{maintenance of the}} air-conditioning settings. <b>The</b> <b>sets</b> <b>were</b> symmetrical with a motor car at each end, and two kitchen cars serving their respective halves of the train. In an emergency, the buffers {{on the front of}} <b>the</b> <b>sets</b> <b>were</b> used in conjunction with a normally concealed coupling hook.|$|R
50|$|Every {{candidate}} inside <b>the</b> <b>set</b> <b>is</b> pairwise unbeatable by {{any other}} candidate outside <b>the</b> <b>set</b> (i.e., ties <b>are</b> allowed).|$|R
25|$|The play {{takes place}} on a single day in August 1912, from around 8:30a.m. to midnight. <b>The</b> <b>setting</b> <b>is</b> the seaside Connecticut home of the Tyrones' Monte Cristo Cottage. The four main {{characters}} are the semi-autobiographical representations of O'Neill himself, his older brother, and their parents.|$|E
25|$|The present {{purpose is}} to show semi-rigorously how {{formally}} one may apply the Minkowski metric to two vectors and obtain a real number, i.e. to display the rôle of the differentials, and how they disappear in a calculation. <b>The</b> <b>setting</b> <b>is</b> that of smooth manifold theory, and concepts such as convector fields and exterior derivatives are introduced.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>setting</b> <b>is</b> {{strongly}} influenced by Tanith Lee's Tales from the Flat Earth, Michael Moorcock's Hawkmoon, Lord Dunsany's The Gods of Pegana and Yoshiaki Kawajiri's Ninja Scroll. Other influences include Glen Cook's The Black Company; Sean Stewart's Resurrection Man, The Night Watch, and Galveston; Homer's Odyssey, the Bible, and Wu Cheng'en's Journey to the West.|$|E
50|$|Virtually all {{articles}} on autocatalytic sets leave open whether <b>the</b> <b>sets</b> areto <b>be</b> considered autonomous or not. Often, autonomy of <b>the</b> <b>sets</b> <b>is</b> silentlyassumed.|$|R
5000|$|Considered as {{a subset}} of the real number line (or more {{generally}} any topological space), <b>the</b> empty <b>set</b> <b>is</b> both closed and open; it {{is an example of a}} [...] "clopen" [...] set. All its boundary points (of which there are none) <b>are</b> in <b>the</b> empty <b>set,</b> and <b>the</b> <b>set</b> <b>is</b> therefore closed; while for every one of its points (of which there are again none), there is an open neighbourhood in <b>the</b> empty <b>set,</b> and <b>the</b> <b>set</b> <b>is</b> therefore open. Moreover, <b>the</b> empty <b>set</b> <b>is</b> a compact <b>set</b> by <b>the</b> fact that every finite <b>set</b> <b>is</b> compact.|$|R
25|$|The anime episodes {{are being}} {{released}} on Japanese Blu-ray and DVD sets that contain twelve episodes each. <b>The</b> first <b>set</b> <b>was</b> released on December 2, 2015. <b>The</b> second <b>set</b> <b>was</b> released on March 2, 2016. <b>The</b> third <b>set</b> <b>was</b> released on July 2, 2016. <b>The</b> fourth <b>set</b> <b>was</b> released on October 10, 2016.|$|R
25|$|Tuten's {{most recent}} novel, The Green Hour (2002), {{is in many}} ways a {{departure}} from the others. <b>The</b> <b>setting</b> <b>is</b> the present day, and the characters are not borrowed from history. Further, it lacks much of the impertinent humor and ethereal feel of his previous works. The story recounts the 30-year love affair between an academic and a spiritual vagabond.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>setting</b> <b>is</b> {{always a}} mise-en-scène echoing with {{fractured}} French. They include Paris in the springtime, the Sahara, the Matterhorn, or the little village of N'est-ce Pas in the French Alps. The exotic locales, such as Algiers, {{are drawn from}} the Pepé Le Moko story. Settings associated in popular culture with romance, such as the Champs-Élysées or the Eiffel Tower, are sometimes present.|$|E
25|$|It is now {{ten years}} after the events at the Paris Opera House and <b>the</b> <b>setting</b> <b>is</b> Phantasma on Coney Island in New York. An excited group of vacationers arrive, {{overwhelmed}} at all that Phantasma has to offer. They speculate about the park's reclusive, masked owner and creator, a wealthy tycoon known only as Mr. Y ("Heaven by the Sea").|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>set</b> <b>is</b> four {{compact discs}} long; a bonus disc, An Evening with The Supremes, {{contained}} mostly unreleased live recordings and {{was included in}} <b>the</b> first 25,000 <b>sets.</b> Included in <b>the</b> <b>set</b> <b>is</b> a 70-page booklet with extensive essays, track annotations, and a full discography.|$|R

50|$|The {{designers}} of <b>the</b> <b>set</b> <b>were</b> Aaron Forsythe (lead designer), Mark Rosewater, Paul Sottosanti, Brady Dommermuth, Nate Heiss, and Andrew Finch; the developers of <b>the</b> <b>set</b> <b>were</b> Devin Low (lead developer), Bill Rose, Matt Place, Henry Stern, Mike Turian, and Doug Beyer.|$|R
25|$|The {{memories}} of an unnamed elderly tailor form a parable from the distant year {{he worked as}} a village schoolteacher and met his fiancée Eva, a nanny. <b>The</b> <b>setting</b> <b>is</b> the fictitious Protestant village of Eichwald, Northern Germany, from July 1913 to 9 August 1914, where the local pastor, the doctor and the baron rule the roost over the area's women, children and peasant farmers.|$|E
25|$|A {{new form}} of the image, which from the rare early {{versions}} {{seems to have been}} formulated in 6th-century Palestine, was to set the essential form of Eastern Orthodox images down to the present day. <b>The</b> <b>setting</b> <b>is</b> now a cave - or rather the specific Cave of the Nativity in Bethlehem, already underneath the Church of the Nativity, and well-established as a place of pilgrimage, with the approval of the Church.|$|E
25|$|The Railway, {{widely known}} as The Gare Saint-Lazare, was painted in 1873. <b>The</b> <b>setting</b> <b>is</b> the urban {{landscape}} of Paris {{in the late}} 19th century. Using his favorite model in his last painting of her, a fellow painter, Victorine Meurent, also the model for Olympia and the Luncheon on the Grass, sits before an iron fence holding a sleeping puppy and an open book in her lap. Next to her is a little girl {{with her back to}} the painter, watching a train pass beneath them.|$|E
50|$|There {{will be two}} depot and {{maintenance}} yards on the line (one at each end) where <b>the</b> <b>sets</b> <b>are</b> planned to be stocked. But as the constructions <b>were</b> delayed, <b>the</b> <b>sets</b> <b>are</b> temporarily kept at the historical Haydarpaşa, Sirkeci and Edirne yards.|$|R
50|$|GEC and BREL {{were awarded}} the {{design-build}} contract, and <b>the</b> <b>sets</b> <b>were</b> assembled by BREL at York in 1976; the carriages are closely {{based on the}} British Rail Mark 2 design.

25|$|The {{archaeological site}} of Mada’in Saleh is {{situated}} 20km (12.4mi) {{north of the}} town of Al-`Ula, 400km (248.5mi) north-west of Medina, and 500km (310.7mi) south-east of Petra, Jordan. The site is on a plain, {{at the foot of a}} basalt plateau, which forms a portion of the Hijaz mountains. The western and north-western portions of the site contain a water table that can be reached at a depth of 20m (65.6ft). <b>The</b> <b>setting</b> <b>is</b> notable for its desert landscape, marked by sandstone outcrops of various sizes and heights.|$|E
25|$|The Incorporated Knight series {{comprises}} some 1970s {{short stories}} by de Camp and two novels written {{in collaboration with}} Catherine Crook de Camp, The Incorporated Knight (1988) and The Pixilated Peeress (1991). The early short stories were incorporated into the first of these. The sequence {{is set in the}} medieval era of another alternate world sharing the geography of our own, but in which a Neapolitan empire filled the role of Rome and no universal religion like Christianity ever arose, leaving its nations split among competing pagan sects. <b>The</b> <b>setting</b> <b>is</b> borrowed in part from Mandeville's Travels.|$|E
25|$|The resort was {{designed}} to provide a vacation spot for the US service members and their families. It is a retreat for military personnel of all ranks, their families and their guests. The resort offers discounted prices for hotel rooms and discounts on theme park tickets. The resort's motto is Serving Those Who Serve. Specific eligibility must be met before making a reservation. As guests enter Shades of Green, there are five service flags framing an immense rock formation with five waterfalls, each a tribute to the five branches of military service. Rising above <b>the</b> <b>setting</b> <b>is</b> a larger American flag and a smaller POW/MIA flag.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> DVD <b>set</b> <b>is</b> {{packaged}} in two double-disc thin packs. The booklet planned for <b>the</b> <b>set</b> <b>was</b> omitted due to time constraints, as no further delays were wanted.|$|R
