25|$|Although the {{direction}} of reading has been determined, {{the point where the}} text starts has not. Philippi's line numbers were arbitrary, but kept by Barthel. The main asymmetry is that line 12 (Fischer's line 1) is 90cm long, running three quarters the length of the Staff. The space occupied by lines 12 and 13 is 30mm wide at the <b>thick</b> <b>end</b> of the staff (at the end of line 12 and beginning of line 13), but only 17mm wide at the tapered end (at the end of line 13). Past the cut-off point (the beginning) of line 12, the baseline of line 13 shifts upward, and the glyphs widen to fill in the gap. From that point on, 13 is parallel with line 11 rather than antiparallel as is normally the case for adjacent lines.|$|E
25|$|Eggs {{are laid}} {{throughout}} the year, {{but there is}} a peak that enables the birds to make use of periods that food is plenty, such as between August and December in South Sudan and between March and May in eastern Africa. Three or four eggs are laid in a roofed nest, that is suspended from a thin branch an in ant-gall acacia (Vachellia drepanolobium), or another spined and ant-housing acacia. The nest consists of grass straws, and during breeding and feeding the nestlings has one downward-facing opening. Eggs are approximately 19mm long and 14mm in diameter, greenish, bluish or white, unadorned or with fine black or olive colored specks, more dense at <b>thick</b> <b>end,</b> or so heavily blotched that the overall color seems olive-brown or ash-grey. Both parents share breeding duty but the female about twice as often as the male, until after thirteen or fourteen days, the eggs hatch.|$|E
2500|$|This beautifully carved, 126-cm long {{staff is}} entirely covered with glyphs running along its length. It is round in cross-section, 5.7cm in {{diameter}} {{at one end}} and 6.4cm at the other (per Fischer; length 126.6cm and circumferences at extremities of 17.1 and 20.0cm per Bettocchi), and made of unknown wood. It is in good condition, but with some splitting, and it is battered {{on one side of the}} <b>thick</b> <b>end,</b> evidently from resting diagonally on the ground when held. There is some pitting just below the start of line 12 (Fischer's line 1), which Fischer believes may be due to corrosion from the sebum of the bearer's thumb.|$|E

5|$|The <b>thicker</b> <b>end</b> of the log, the {{end that}} was nearest to the tree's roots, may have a special significance. In Montenegro {{it is called the}} head of the badnjak; the main log is laid on the fire with its head {{pointing}} east. In central Serbia the badnjak is laid with its <b>thicker</b> <b>end</b> sticking out from the ognjište. The household's shepherds would kiss over it to ensure an abundance of lambs in the coming year. In Gruža it is coated with honey which is then licked by children. At the side of ognjište where the <b>thicker</b> <b>end</b> is situated, the family may place a plowshare, a round loaf of bread, a glove filled with wheat, sugar, or a sieve containing grain, honey, cakes, wine, salt, prunes, walnuts, and apples. The cut surface of the <b>thicker</b> <b>end</b> is in Čečava kissed by all the family members after the badnjak is laid on the fire.|$|R
2500|$|Fischer {{takes the}} short line 12 {{to be the}} {{beginning}} of the text, reasoning {{that it would have been}} easier to indent the first line than to estimate how long the last line would be when fitting it in, and that the large glyphs in line 13 past the end of line 12 were written that way to fill in the gap. However, he does note that there are remnants of pre-inscription tracings that would have enabled such an estimate. Horley (2011) makes a case that 12 was the last line: That the text starts at line 11, wraps around (in descending order) to 13, and that 12 was fit into the gap between the slightly skew lines 11 and 13. The way lines 12 and 13 squeeze together (the glyphs are 12–14mm high at the <b>thick</b> <b>end</b> of the staff, but only 8–10mm high at the end of line 12 where 13 takes over) is consistent with these being the last lines engraved.|$|E
2500|$|American Northwest coast {{native peoples}} {{traditionally}} used adzes for both functional construction (from bowls to canoes) and art (from masks to totem poles). [...] Northwest coast adzes take two forms: hafted and D-handle. [...] The hafted form {{is similar in}} form to a European adze with the haft constructed from a natural crooked branch which approximately forms a 60% angle. [...] The thin end is used as the handle and the <b>thick</b> <b>end</b> is flattened and notched such that an adze iron can be lashed to it. Modern hafts are sometimes constructed from a sawed blank with a dowel added for strength at the crook. [...] The second form is the D-handle adze which is basically an adze iron with a directly attached handle. [...] The D-handle therefore provides no mechanical leverage. [...] Northwest coast adzes are often classified by size and iron shape vs. role. [...] As with European adzes, iron shapes include straight, gutter and lipped. [...] Where larger Northwest adzes are similar in size to their European counterparts, the smaller sizes are typically much lighter such {{that they can be}} used for the detailed smoothing, shaping and surface texturing required for figure carving. [...] Final surfacing is sometimes performed with a crooked knife.|$|E

50|$|In graph theory, {{a branch}} of mathematics, Halin's grid theorem states that the {{infinite}} graphs with <b>thick</b> <b>ends</b> are exactly the graphs containing subdivisions of the hexagonal tiling of the plane.

6000|$|The work-hours were over; the [...] "hands" [...] were gone. The {{machinery}} was at rest, {{the mill}} shut up. Malone walked round it.

5000|$|Typically bainite manifests as aggregates, termed sheaves, of ferrite plates (sub-units) {{separated}} by retained austenite, martensite or cementite. While the sub-units appear separate when viewed on a 2-dimensional section {{they are in}} fact interconnected in 3-dimensions and usually take on a lenticular plate or lath morphology.

50|$|The {{headboard}} is a {{piece of}} furniture that attaches to the head of a bed. Historically, they served to isolate sleepers from drafts and cold in less insulated buildings, and thus were made of wood, which is less thermally conductive than stone or brick. Constructed to create space from the wall (via <b>thicker</b> <b>end</b> pillars) they allowed falling colder air to sink to the floor rather than onto the bed.|$|R
60|$|So saying, {{he began}} {{to cut through the}} stem again at about six yards from the <b>thick</b> <b>end.</b> This done, he cut three strong, short poles or levers from the stout branches, with which to roll the log down the beach into the sea; for, as it was nearly two feet thick at the large end, we could not move it without such helps. With the levers, however, we rolled it slowly into the sea.|$|E
6000|$|She is a good, all-round sportswoman, is {{the pretty}} {{girl in the}} picture. The only thing I have to say against her is that she makes one {{dissatisfied}} with the girl out of the picture--the girl who mistakes a punt for a teetotum, so that you land feeling {{as if you had}} had a day in the Bay of Biscay; and who, every now and again, stuns you with the <b>thick</b> <b>end</b> of the pole: the girl who does not skate with her hands in her muff; but who, throwing them up to heaven, says, [...] "I'm going," [...] and who goes, taking care that you go with her: the girl who, as you brush her down, and try to comfort her, explains to you indignantly that the horse took the corner too sharply and never noticed the mile-stone; the girl whose hair sea water does NOT improve.|$|E

Meanwhile George King seized an axe and cut away the rigging that {{held on to the}} wrecked masts, and fair-haired Charlie laboured like a hero to clear the pumps. The rays of the cabin lights did not reach the deck, so that much of the work had to be done in what may be styled {{darkness}} visible, while the little vessel kicked about like a wild thing in the raging sea, and the torn canvas flapped with a horrible noise. Pitiless wind, laden with sleet, howled over them as if thirsting impatiently for the fishermen's lives. At last they succeeded in clearing the pumps, and worked them with untiring energy for hours, but could not tell how many, for the <b>thick</b> <b>end</b> of a marline-spike had been driven through the clock-face and stopped it.|$|E
50|$|The {{traditional}} tenkara {{line has}} a loop of braided line at its <b>thicker</b> <b>end.</b> This braided line {{is used to}} tie the tenkara line directly {{to the tip of}} the rod by using a cow hitch (aka: girth hitch) knot. The line at the rod's tip needs to have a stopper knot, which will hold the cow hitch in place. It is a very secure method to attach the line.|$|R
50|$|Two {{to three}} eggs are laid at one day intervals, and are {{incubated}} by the female for 14 to 19 days.

60|$|Then he got up, lazily, {{laughing}} and showing his ugly teeth, {{and stood in}} front of his bath with his heavy wooden club in his hand. He whirled it round his head insultingly, but Theseus was quicker than he, and again, as when he slew the Pine-Bender, he did not strike, for striking is slow compared to thrusting, but like a flash he lunged forward and drove the <b>thick</b> <b>end</b> of his iron club into the breast of Sciron. He staggered, and, as he reeled, Theseus dealt him a blow across the thigh, and he fell. Theseus seized the club which dropped from the hand of Sciron, and threw it over the cliff; it seemed long before the sound came up from the rocks on which it struck. 'A deep drop into a stony way, Sciron,' said Theseus, 'now wash my feet! Stand up, and turn your back to me, and be ready when I tell you.' Sciron rose, slowly and sulkily, and stood as Theseus bade him do.|$|E

I sat on the stoep and listened to all the talk in the sitkammer. The window has never been mended, baas, since the Quabies broke it. God in Heaven! what a talk that was. I never knew that white people could have so much to say about a simple matter. You want to marry the Baas Marais's daughter; the baas wants her to marry another man who can pay more cattle. Well, among us it would soon have been settled, for the father would have taken a stick and beaten you out of the hut with the <b>thick</b> <b>end.</b> Then he would have beaten the girl with the thin end until she promised to take the other man, and all would have been settled nicely. But you Whites, you talk and talk, and nothing is settled. You still mean to marry the daughter, and the daughter still means not to marry the man of many cows. Moreover, the father has really gained nothing except a sick heart and much bad luck to come." ...|$|E
60|$|Delighted {{with this}} success, he {{immediately}} cut with his knife, {{a branch of}} one of the hardest trees he could find, and formed it into an axe-handle. Some of Pauline's cord he tied round the middle of this, and then split it at one end, using his flint for the purpose, and a stone for a hammer. The split extended only as far as the cord, and he forced it open by means of little stones as wedges until it was wide enough to admit the <b>thick</b> <b>end</b> of his flint axe-head. Using a piece of soft stone as a pencil, he now marked the form of the flint, where it touched the wood, exactly, and worked at this with his knife, as patiently as a Chinaman, for several hours, until the wood fitted the irregularities and indentations of the flint to a nicety. This of itself caused the wood to hold the flint-head very firmly. Then the wedges were removed, and when the handle was bound all round the split part with cord, and the flint-head enveloped in the same, the whole thing became like a solid mass.|$|E

This produced a gun that had the typical weakness of a wrought iron gun, the breech being unable to withstand the transverse forces of the charge.

60|$|Dec. 26th.--Fine {{view of the}} {{mountains}} of Bouru, which we have now approached considerably. Our crew seem rather a clumsy lot. They do not walk the deck with the easy swing of English sailors, but hesitate and stagger like landsmen. In the night the lower boom of our mainsail broke, {{and they were all}} the morning repairing it. It consisted of two bamboos lashed together, <b>thick</b> <b>end</b> to thin, and was about seventy feet long. The rigging and arrangement of these praus contrasts strangely with that of European vessels, in which the various ropes and spars, though much more numerous, are placed so as not to interfere with each other's action. Here the case is quite different; for though there are no shrouds or stays to complicate the matter, yet scarcely anything can be done without first clearing something else out of the way. The large sails cannot be shifted round to go on the other tack without first hauling down the jibs, and the booms of the fore and aft sails have to be lowered and completely detached to perform the same operation. Then there are always a lot of ropes foul of each other, and all the sails can never be set (though they are so few) without a good part of their surface having the wind kept out of them by others. Yet praus are much liked even by those who have had European vessels, because of their cheapness both in first cost and in keeping up; almost all repairs can be done by the crew, and very few European stores are required.|$|E
60|$|This {{was soon}} done; but it cost some trouble, for the stem was very high, and as Peterkin usually pulled nuts from the younger trees, {{he was not}} much {{accustomed}} to climbing the high ones. The leaf or branch was a very large one, and we were surprised at its size and strength. Viewed from a little distance, the cocoa-nut tree {{seems to be a}} tall, straight stem, without a single branch except at the top, where there is a tuft of feathery-looking leaves that seem to wave like soft plumes in the wind. But when we saw one of these leaves or branches at our feet, we found it to be a strong stalk, about fifteen feet long, with a number of narrow, pointed leaflets ranged alternately on each side. But what seemed to us the most wonderful thing about it was a curious substance resembling cloth, which was wrapped round the <b>thick</b> <b>end</b> of the stalk where it had been cut from the tree. Peterkin told us that he had the greatest difficulty in separating the branch from the stem on account of this substance, as it was wrapped quite round the tree, and, he observed, round all the other branches, thus forming a strong support to the large leaves while exposed to high winds. When I call this substance cloth I do not exaggerate. Indeed, with regard to all the things I saw during my eventful career in the South Seas, I have been exceedingly careful not to exaggerate, or in any way to mislead or deceive my readers. This cloth, I say, was remarkably like to coarse brown cotton cloth. It had a seam or fibre down the centre of it, from which diverged other fibres, {{about the size of a}} bristle. There were two layers of these fibres, very long and tough, the one layer crossing the other obliquely, and the whole was cemented together with a still finer fibrous and adhesive substance. When we regarded it attentively, we could with difficulty believe that it had not been woven by human hands. This remarkable piece of cloth we stripped carefully off, and found it to be above two feet long by a foot broad, and we carried it home with us as a great prize.|$|E

The favourite {{article is a}} [...] "dudheen," [...] a well culotté clay, used and worn till the bowl touches the nose. The poor are driven to a [...] "Kondukwe," [...] a yard of plantain leaf, hollowed with a wire, and charged at the thicker end. The [...] "holy herb" [...] would of course grow in the country, and grow well, but it is imported from the States without trouble, and perhaps with less expense. Some tribes make a decent snuff of the common trade article, but I never saw either sex chew--perhaps the most wholesome, and certainly the most efficacious form. The smoking of Lyámbá, called Dyámbá in the southern regions, is confined to debauchees. M. du Chaillu asserts that this Cannabis sativa is not found wild, and the people confirm his statement; possibly it has extended from Hindostan to Zanzibar, and thence across the continent. Intoxicating hemp is now grown everywhere, especially in the Nkommi country, and little packages, neatly bound with banana leaves, sell on the river for ten sous each. It is smoked either in the [...] "Kondukwe" [...] or in the Ojo. The latter, literally meaning a torch, is a polished cow-horn, closed at the <b>thick</b> <b>end</b> with wood, and banded with metal; a wooden stem, projecting from the upper or concave side, bears a neat [...] "chillam" [...] (bowl), either of clay or of brown steatite brought from the upper Gaboon River. This rude hookah is half filled with water; the dried hemp in the bowl is covered with what Syrians call a [...] "Kurs," [...] a bit of metal {{about the size of}} half-a-crown, and upon it rests the fire. I at once recognized the implement in the Brazil, where many slave- holders simply supposed it to be a servile and African form of tobacco-pipe. After a few puffs the eyes redden, a violent cough is caused by the acrid fumes tickling the throat; the brain, whirls with a pleasant swimming, like that of chloroform, and the smoker finds himself in gloriâ. My Spanish friends at Po tried but did not like it. I can answer for the hemp being stronger than the Egyptian hashísh or the bhang of Hindostan; it rather resembled the Fasúkh of Northern Africa, the Dakha and Motukwane of the southern regions, and the wild variety called in Sind [...] "Bang i Jabalí." ...|$|E
