40|$|Investigation {{about the}} cold-soaking {{treatment}} {{has been conducted}} on five wood species (i. e. keruing, nyatoh, melur, pulai and meranti merah) for housing purposes. The penetrating preservative for this case was CCB (copper-chrome-boron) chemicals. Before being treated. the wood specimens measuring 3 - 5 cm (in length) by 3 - 5 cm (in width) were prepared {{from each of the}} five species. Such specimens could not be treated by implementing the conventionally prescribed treating schedule. because the measurement of preservative retention at such schedule should follow the revised standard/schedule which differed from the conventional one. Hence, in cold-soaking treatment using CCB preservative, the specimens of wood species for such purpose had to be modified in their sizes/shapes. Three different sizes/shapes were prepared, i. e. beam, truss, and rafters; and then were allowed to reach their air-dry moisture contents. Afterwards. they underwent cold-soaking treatment using CCB preservative in two different concentrations (i. e. 5 percent and 10 percent). Meanwhile. the soaking durations implemented for each concentration were consecutively 3, 5 and 7 days. The results revealed that all the wood species in all three sizes/shapes (i. e. beam. <b>truss.</b> and <b>rafters)</b> could be treated using the revised schedule.

40|$|This article {{covers the}} history of Moscow Manege, a {{masterpiece}} of engineering science and architecture. It was designated for the accommodation of the military parade in commemoration of the 5 th anniversary of the great victory over Napoleon. It was solemnly opened for visitors in 1817 to become a majestic monument commemorating Russia's triumph in the Patriotic war of 1812. Agustin de Betancourt, an ingenious Spanish engineer, was the designer of Manege. Having completed his excellent education in Madrid, Paris, and London {{by the end of}} 1790, {{he became one of the}} most well-known engineers not only in Spain, but also in Europe. In 1808, the engineer moved to Russia following a personal invitation extended by Emperor Alexander I. Betancourt proposed an exclusively original design of Manege overlapping. It was made of wooden <b>trussed</b> <b>rafters.</b> The arena had no internal column; therefore, rafters that were 44. 86 meters long, were spanned all over the space. Back then, this engineering structure was unique. Now we know that foreign engineers made special visits to Moscow to study Betancourt's wooden roof. The Manege was also remarkable from the architectural point of view: a high rustic socle emphasized the massiveness of the building; a vigorous rhythm of columns, enchasing the walls to assure special solemnity; skillfully interspersed ornaments representing military stories were to identify the purpose of the premises.

40|$|Steel {{buildings}} constructed using {{thin and}} high strength cold-formed steel roof sheeting and battens often suffer from roof failures during severe wind {{events such as}} storms, tornadoes and cyclones. Premature roof connection failures {{have been identified as}} the main reason for such roof failures. Among them, the screw connection between roof batten and <b>truss</b> or <b>rafter</b> suffers from a localised pull-through failure that can lead to the removal of the entire roof structure by high wind events. Therefore suitable design rules are urgently needed to ensure the structural safety of these roof batten screw fastener connections under high wind uplift loads.

5000|$|Architectural historians in Louisiana use {{the term}} [...] "Norman roof" [...] {{to refer to a}} steeply pitched roof; it is {{supported}} by what they call a [...] "Norman truss" [...] which is similar to a king post truss. This is a through-purlin truss consisting of a tie beam and paired truss blades, with a central king post to support the roof ridge. The name derives from a belief that this system of construction was introduced to North America by settlers from Normandy in northern France, but it is really a misnomer as the system was more widely used than that. The difference between a Norman truss and a king post truss is the tie beam in a Norman truss is technically a collar beam (a beam between the rafters above the rafter feet) where the king post <b>truss</b> the <b>rafters</b> land on top of a tie beam.|$|R

40|$|Today it {{is common}} in, in particular, Stockholm to rebuild the attics in old centenary {{buildings}} to apartment floors {{as a work of}} densifying the city. During these renovations, {{it is common}} that the architect wants to change the roof truss for example to get a better sense of space. Roof trusses that are common in residential buildings are pillar roof, roof truss with verticals on the <b>rafter,</b> <b>trussed</b> <b>rafter</b> and Swedish rafter. This study focuses on the Swedish rafter that is completely dominant in residential buildings and comes in several different variations in houses from the 1800 's and 1900 's in Sweden. This type of truss has a design which allows for furnishing the attic. The purpose of this studie is that by using two reference objects from Östermalm in Stockholm (the block Tallen and the block Adlern) investigate what happens if the rafter changes and this is done in terms of standards BABS 1946 and Eurocode. This in order to simultaneously make a comparison between these two standards. The theory has examined how the load and sizing calculations are made in terms of ultimate limit {{on the basis of the}} studied standards. A total of three different changes of the roof truss per reference object where either the collar beam was removed or any of the supporting legs. The results have shown that a roof truss with a small roof pitch is more likely to rupture when a change is made. At the same time the risk of rupture depends on the asymmetry of the the roof truss where the elements on the side with minimum roof pitch is most vulnerable except when the support leg is removed on the side of the roof truss with the steepest roof pitch. The comparison between BABS 1946 and Eurocode showed that the major difference in the load calculation is that the snow load according to Eurocode is approximately 50 % greater than for BABS 1946. However, results showed that it is ultimately not much difference when the outcome was basically the same. This despite the fact that the loads and strength calculations differ between the standards, but when calculated they give similar results. Validerat; 20120817 (anonymous...|$|R

40|$|Windstorms {{are one of}} {{the major}} causes of severe damage to houses and other infrastructure. An {{assessment}} of previous studies on damage to timber framed houses shows that the roof is the most vulnerable part of a house, and that failures take place at inter component connections (i. e. cladding to batten, batten to truss connection and <b>truss</b> or <b>rafter</b> to top plate connection). The failure of roof structures during extreme windstorms emphasises the need to study their response. The stability of the roof structure mainly depends on their inter-component connection response to wind loading. The roof to wall connection is an important inter-component connection for the structural stability of a house during strong winds, by providing a continuous load path from the roof to the foundation. The aim {{of this study is to}} assess the loading effects on roof to wall connections of a typical brick veneer contemporary house. A numerical model of the representative house was developed and the result shows the load sharing and the structural response. This result also shows that the structural system stability will improve with elements such as ceiling and ceiling cornice sharing the load...|$|R
