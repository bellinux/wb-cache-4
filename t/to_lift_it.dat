5|$|Bolstered by {{the fresh}} troops, the Spartans and their Macedonian allies {{prepared}} themselves for Pyrrhus' next assault against the trench. The presence of more adversaries intensified Pyrrhus' determination {{to capture the}} city and he ordered another attack on the trenches. He was unable to accomplish anything and suffered further losses. The failure of this attack convinced Pyrrhus about the futility of persevering with the siege and he decided <b>to</b> <b>lift</b> <b>it</b> and withdraw.|$|E
5|$|The game {{takes place}} {{immediately}} after the events of Wonder Boy in Monster Land, which Wonder Boy has been cursed by the Mecha Dragon and must locate the Salamander Cross <b>to</b> <b>lift</b> <b>it.</b> The game is nonlinear and features varying landscapes in which players must navigate. Players find items and clues needed to access different parts of Monster Land, and they can transform into other forms and gain different abilities.|$|E
5|$|The BT46 was an {{aluminium}} alloy monocoque featuring the trapezoidal cross section common {{to many of}} Gordon Murray’s 1970s designs. It featured inbuilt pneumatic jacks fed from an external supply of compressed air <b>to</b> <b>lift</b> <b>it</b> off the ground for tyre changes during practice. It employed a very early version of the carbon brakes that were in universal use by the mid-1980s—a concept taken from the aircraft industry. The system, which Brabham had been developing since 1976, combined carbon composite brake pads with a steel disc faced with carbon composite 'pucks'.|$|E

5|$|Thor {{lands in}} New Mexico, where {{astrophysicist}} Dr. Jane Foster, her assistant Darcy Lewis, and mentor Dr. Erik Selvig, find him. The local populace finds Mjolnir, which S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Phil Coulson soon commandeers before forcibly acquiring Jane's {{data about the}} wormhole that delivered Thor to Earth. Thor, having discovered Mjolnir's nearby location, seeks to retrieve it from the facility that S.H.I.E.L.D. quickly constructed but he finds himself unable <b>to</b> <b>lift</b> <b>it,</b> and is captured. With Selvig's help, he is freed and resigns himself to exile on Earth as he develops a romance with Jane.|$|E
5|$|Flights from Earth {{to other}} planets in the Solar System {{have a high}} energy cost. It {{requires}} almost {{the same amount of}} energy for a spacecraft to reach Jupiter from Earth's orbit as it does <b>to</b> <b>lift</b> <b>it</b> into orbit in the first place. In astrodynamics, this energy expenditure is defined by the net change in the spacecraft's velocity, or delta-v. The energy needed to reach Jupiter from an Earth orbit requires a delta-v of about 9km/s, compared to the 9.0–9.5km/s to reach a low Earth orbit from the ground. Gravity assists through planetary flybys (such as by Earth or Venus) can be used to reduce the energetic requirement (i.e. the fuel) at launch, at the cost of a significantly longer flight duration to reach a target such as Jupiter when compared to the direct trajectory. Ion thrusters capable of a delta-v of more than 10 kilometers/s were used on the Dawn spacecraft. This is more than enough delta-v to do a Jupiter fly-by mission from a solar orbit of the same radius as that of Earth without gravity assist.|$|E
5|$|South Slavic legends about Kraljević Marko or Krali Marko are {{primarily}} based on myths {{much older than}} the historical Marko Mrnjavčević. He differs in legend from the folk poems; in some areas he was imagined as a giant who walked stepping on hilltops, his head touching the clouds. He {{was said to have}} helped God shape the earth, and created the river gorge in Demir Kapija ("Iron Gate") with a stroke of his sabre. This drained the sea covering the regions of Bitola, Mariovo and Tikveš in Macedonia, making them habitable. After the earth was shaped, Marko arrogantly showed off his strength. God took it away by leaving a bag as heavy as the earth on a road; when Marko tried <b>to</b> <b>lift</b> <b>it,</b> he lost his strength and became an ordinary man.|$|E

5|$|The {{story of}} the video was meant to {{illustrate}} the lyrics of the song. It depicts the sexual fantasies of a rich and bored housewife played by Beyoncé who tries to seduce her man while having breakfast at her house wearing a white robe. The video opens with various shots of a big mansion in which the singer is seen {{in one of the}} rooms. She tries to get her man's attention while he reads a newspaper. As he does not notice her, she throws a napkin on the floor and her female servant comes <b>to</b> <b>lift</b> <b>it.</b> The clip transitions to scenes of Beyoncé dressed in a Victorian jeweled outfit with a mask in her hands, lip-syncing the lyrics and dancing to the rhythm of the song. Afterwards, she is seen entering a limousine in which Jay-Z is already inside. Scenes of Beyoncé with a black coat and lingerie walking in front of the car are also intertwined throughout.|$|E
25|$|The Ministry of Defence soon ran out {{of money}} for the {{operation}} and gave the job to a private company. They too pumped air into the hull <b>to</b> <b>lift</b> <b>it</b> and pulled wires under the ship <b>to</b> <b>lift</b> <b>it.</b> After ten days, on August 5, 1926, the ship surfaced and floated with the aid of pontoons.|$|E

25|$|Barack Obama {{discussed}} {{easing the}} embargo during his 2008 {{campaign for president}} of the U.S., though he promised to maintain it. In December 2014, he called the embargo a failure, asking the U.S. Congress to enact legislation <b>to</b> <b>lift</b> <b>it</b> entirely.|$|E
25|$|On 23 May 1874, James Shopland of the Swindon Brick and Tyle Company {{reported}} to Professor Richard Owen that their clay pit, the Swindon Great Quarry below Old Swindon Hill at Swindon in Wiltshire, had again produced a fossil skeleton. Owen sent out William Davies {{to secure the}} specimen, which proved to be encased in an eight feet high clay nodule. During an attempt <b>to</b> <b>lift</b> <b>it</b> in its entirety, the loam clump crumbled into several pieces. These were eventually transported to London in crates with a total weight of three tonnes. The bones were subsequently partially uncovered by Owen's preparator, the mason Caleb Barlow.|$|E
25|$|One of Maradona's {{trademark}} moves was dribbling full-speed on {{the right}} wing, and on reaching the opponent's goal line, delivering accurate passes to his teammates. Another trademark was the rabona, a reverse-cross pass shot behind the leg that holds all the weight. This maneuver led to several assists, such as the cross for Ramón Díaz's header against Switzerland in 1980. He was also a dangerous free kick and penalty kick taker. His free kick technique, which often saw him raise his knee {{at a very high}} angle when striking the ball, thus enabling him <b>to</b> <b>lift</b> <b>it</b> high over the wall, allowed him to score free kicks even from close range, within 22 to 17 yards (20 to 16 metres) from the goal, or even just outside the penalty area.|$|E
50|$|In 1959 Vertol Aircraft, who had {{acquired}} Piasecki, {{came up with}} a concept for heavy lift over short distances where between two and six H-21Bs would be linked by beams <b>to</b> <b>lift</b> heavy loads. <b>It</b> was considered to be unsafe, because if one helicopter had mechanical problems during the <b>lift</b> <b>it</b> could cause an unbalanced situation and cause all helicopters to crash.|$|R

25|$|Embrittlement is a {{risk for}} many human remains, {{and as a result}} {{handling}} should be limited. When possible, artifacts should be lifted by their storage container or tray. To avoid transfer of oils to the remains, nitrile or latex gloves should be worn during their handling. If a body is <b>to</b> be <b>lifted,</b> <b>it</b> must be supported under all of its appendages.|$|R
25|$|In {{relation}} to this interpretation, William Empson suggests that Katherina was originally performed {{by an adult}} male actor rather than a young boy. He argues that the play indicates on several occasions that Katherina is physically strong, and even capable of over-powering Petruchio. For example, this is demonstrated off-stage when the horse falls on her as she is riding to Petruchio's home, and she is able <b>to</b> <b>lift</b> <b>it</b> off herself, and later when she throws Petruchio off a servant he is beating. Empson argues that {{the point is not}} that Katherina is, as a woman, weak, but that she is not well cast in the role in life which she finds herself having to play. The end of the play then offers blatant irony when a strong male actor, dressed as a woman, lectures women on how to play their parts.|$|E
25|$|The caisson lock can however be powered, and the caisson lifted, by {{buoyancy}} alone. Pumping {{ballast water}} {{in and out}} of the caisson is enough to float it up or down the lock chamber. The weight of ballast water is approximately that of the canal barge being lifted. The boat lift though needs a mechanical lift system. In most vertical lift systems, this must also lift or lower the weight of the caisson and its water contents as well. This is substantially more than the barge alone, and the power <b>to</b> <b>lift</b> <b>it</b> is supplied mechanically. At the time of their development, the steam engine was in its infancy. Steam engines had been developed as water pumps, but not yet for the supply of mechanical power (see rotative steam engine). Given the engineering constraints of the time, lifting an enclosed caisson by buoyancy was more practical than driving a boat lift.|$|E
25|$|Salvage efforts began immediately, and divers {{were sent}} {{down from a}} salvage tug that arrived from Coco Solo. By 10:00am, {{they were on the}} bottom {{examining}} the wreck. To search for trapped personnel, they hammered on the hull near the aft end of the ship and worked forward. Upon reaching the torpedo room, they heard answering hammer blows from inside the boat. In 1923 the only way the salvage crew could get the men out of the submarine was <b>to</b> <b>lift</b> <b>it</b> physically from the mud using cranes or pontoons. One of the largest crane barges in the world, Ajax, built specifically for handling the gates of the canal locks, was in the Canal Zone. However, there had been a landslide at the famous Gaillard Cut and Ajax {{was on the other side}} of the slide, assisting in clearing the Canal. The excavation shifted into high gear and by 2:00pm on the afternoon of the sinking, the crane barge Ajax squeezed through and was on its way to the O-5 site.|$|E

50|$|Proper snow {{throwing}} technique minimizes strains {{and back}} injuries.

25|$|Ore {{was brought}} to the surface up a winding shaft outside the coe. The miners' {{equipment}} included picks, hammers and wedges to split the rock, wiskets or baskets to contain it, corves or sledges to drag it to the shaft bottom, and windlasses or stows, <b>to</b> <b>lift</b> <b>it</b> to the surface. In later years underground transport was improved by replacing corves by wagons, often running on wooden or metal rails. A good example of an 18th-century wooden railway {{can be found in the}} Merry Tom mine, near Via Gellia. The miners avoided the need to excavate hard rock whenever they could and where it was unavoidable sometimes resorted to fire-setting. A fire was built against the rock face after mining had finished for the day and allowed to burn through the night. Fragmentation of the heated rock was increased by throwing water on to it. The rule about fire-setting only after the end of the day's work was important because in the confined mines the smoke was deadly. Fire-setting was a skilled technique and was used sparingly for that reason as well as because of the disruption caused by the smoke and the danger from splintering rock.|$|E
25|$|A classic number 10, Zico usually {{played as}} an attacking midfielder, and is {{regarded}} as one of the greatest footballers of all time. A diminutive playmaker, with a small, slender physique, he was a two-footed player, known for his flair, exceptional technique, ball control, and dribbling skills, as well as his use of tricks and feints to beat opponents with the ball. Although he was not physically imposing, Zico was a highly creative player, with excellent vision, who is considered to be one of the best passers of all time, and was known for his trademark no-look passes. In addition to being a creator of goalscoring opportunities, Zico was also a prolific goalscorer himself, and an excellent finisher, due to his accurate striking ability; he was also a set-piece specialist, who was renowned for his ability to bend the ball and score from dead ball situations, and is considered to be one of the greatest free kick takers of all time. Zico's unique free kick technique, which often saw him raise his knee at a very high angle when striking the ball, thus enabling him <b>to</b> <b>lift</b> <b>it</b> high over the wall, allowed him to score free kicks even from close range, within 20 to 16 metres from the goal, or even from just outside the penalty area. In addition to his footballing skills, Zico was also known for his leadership and determination, as well as his stamina, dedication, and for having an outstanding work-ethic.|$|E
25|$|Daniel sells one of {{the houses}} from the estate, and Paul gives him a job as a salesman. Imogen voices her {{concerns}} about Daniel's changing behaviour, after he convinces Nate to buy a house knowing that certain amenities will not be built. Imogen tells Nate the truth and she and Daniel break up. Daniel also falls out with Paul when he admits to leaking Paul's files to the media. Daniel sees Paul receiving a loan from Dimato for Paul's new business venture. Paul tells Daniel to leave town, which he does without revealing what he knows. He returns with a new hair cut and wants to work at Lassiter's again. Julie Quill agrees to employ him. Daniel and Imogen eventually get back together, but when he works extra hours, she becomes dissatisfied and develops feelings for Tyler. She admits this to Daniel, who decides they {{take a break and be}} free to date other people, despite Imogen insisting she would never have acted on her attraction to Tyler. Josh tries to convince Daniel to reconsider the break-up, but Daniel responds by criticising him for his failures as a father, before the hotel boiler explodes, trapping them both under a column. Despite knowing the column is the only thing keeping him from haemorrhaging to death, Josh asks Karl <b>to</b> <b>lift</b> <b>it</b> to save Daniel. Imogen later tells Daniel that Josh died to save him, and they reunite. Daniel is discharged after undergoing surgery. Imogen receives a job offer in Los Angeles and she accepts.
