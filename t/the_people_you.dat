[...] Cranston additionally added, [...] "I wouldn't be here if it was just, 'Look out, this monster is crushing everything!' Instead of trying to humanize the beast what this film does - and, I think, rightfully so - is humanize <b>the</b> <b>people.</b> <b>You</b> root for them and sympathize with their plight". Cranston also joined the film because he has been a fan of Godzilla since childhood, stating, [...] "Godzilla was always my favorite monster when I was young. He was unapologetic." [...] Cranston had to wear a wig for his scenes due to finishing Breaking Bad days before filming Godzilla. Cranston was initially ready to decline the offer after being approached, assuming the film was going to be [...] "silly", however, director Edwards' passion for the film and his previous film Monsters impressed Cranston enough to read the script and join the film.

Having reached all {{of them on the}} road, the battalion led by Ushakov captured only the Russian fugitives, while the other 300 peoples were brutally executed, leaving no single one of them alive, as they were Muslims, despite the fact that all of them were basically walking dead, being injured and unarmed.
