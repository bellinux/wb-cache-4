We have found that <b>state</b> <b>ownership</b> concentration increases turnovers from new or significantly improved products. But since we have also found that <b>state</b> <b>ownership</b> concentration increases R&D investment, the question emerges concerning whether <b>state</b> <b>ownership</b> concentration increases or decreases the effectiveness of a firm in converting any given input of R&D expenditure into innovation output. To test whether <b>state</b> <b>ownership</b> concentration improves the effectiveness of the firm in generating innovation, we add R&D intensity to the set of controls. Model 2 in Table  6 shows that state stock concentration is still positive and significant after we control for R&D intensity, implying <b>state</b> <b>ownership</b> concentration increases the effectiveness of firms in generating innovation.|$|R

He stressed {{that it was not}} [...] "standard public ownership", as the banks would return to private investors [...] "at the right time".

Royal Bank of Scotland said it intended to raise £20 billion ($34 billion) capital with the government's aid; its chief executive Fred Goodwin resigned.

Thus, it intended to raise £15 billion (€18.9 billion, $25.8 billion) from investors, to be underwritten by the government. The State would pay £5 billion for RBS, while Barclays Bank raised £6.5 billion from private sector investors, with no government help.

40|$|China {{has been}} the most {{successful}} developing country in this modern era of globalization. Since initiating economic reform after 1978, its economy has expanded at a steady rate over 8 percent per capita, fueling historically unprecedented poverty reduction (the poverty rate declined from over 60 percent to 7 percent in 2007). Other developing countries struggling to grow and reduce poverty are naturally interested in what {{has been the}} source of this impressive growth and what, if any, lessons they can take from China. This paper focuses on four features of modern China that have changed significantly between the pre-reform period and today. The Chinese themselves call their reform program Gai Ge Kai Feng,"change the system, open the door. ""Change the system"means altering incentives and ownership, that is, shifting the economy from near <b>total</b> <b>state</b> <b>ownership</b> to one in which private enterprise is dominant. "Open the door"means exactly what it says, liberalizing trade and direct investment. A third lesson is the development of high-quality infrastructure: China's good roads, reliable power, world-class ports, and excellent cell phone coverage throughout the country are apparent to any visitor. What is less well known is that most of this infrastructure has been developed through a policy of"cost recovery"that prices infrastructure services at levels sufficient to finance the capital cost as well as operations and maintenance. A fourth important lesson is China's careful attention to agriculture and rural development, complemented by rural-urban migration.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to examine the role of <b>state</b> <b>ownership</b> in corporate governance and firm performance. We employed ordinary least squares and two-stage least squares regressions to analyze the effects of <b>state</b> <b>ownership</b> on firm performance.

Such <b>state</b> <b>ownership</b> can be classified as profit-oriented and non-profit-oriented, in which the former consider return on investment to be the primary investment objective, whereas the latter prioritizes socio-economic development. We found that profit-oriented <b>state</b> <b>ownership</b> is an effective corporate governance mechanism and provides political patronage to the firm in the form of firm’s specific resources and credit financing. Although nonprofit-oriented <b>state</b> <b>ownership</b> firms also receive similar political patronage, they tend to be associated with inefficiencies such as the free-rider problems, bureaucracies and political intervention in firm management.

40|$|We {{question}} {{previous research}} assuming that privatizing firm performance generally benefits from decreasing <b>state</b> <b>ownership</b> and {{the passage of}} time, both of which purportedly align principal-agent incentives promoting organizational decision-making that increases shareholder value. When <b>state</b> <b>ownership</b> shifts from majority and controlling to minority and non-controlling the performance impact may be positive in the short-run, particularly where there is instability in the local investment policy environment. Consistent with this proposition, we develop and test hypotheses derived from a minority and non-controlling or “residual ” <b>state</b> <b>ownership</b> framework, grounded in credible privatization and institutional theory. We propose that: 1) residual <b>state</b> <b>ownership</b> positively affects shareholder returns after strategic decisions by privatizing firms because it signals state support for managerial initiatives; 2) {{the passage of time}} since initial privatization negatively affects shareholder returns after strategic decisions by privatizing firms because initial undertakings in support of the privatizing firm are reversed; and 3) home-country investment policy stability moderates these two effects –greater stability obviates the need for residual <b>state</b> <b>ownership</b> and slows policy reversals over time.

The negative effects of <b>state</b> <b>ownership</b> are larger when the public stations are regulated by a Ministry as opposed to a more independent regulatory body.
