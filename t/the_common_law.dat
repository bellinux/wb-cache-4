5|$|Alternative views {{have been}} {{expressed}} that the amendments were not seeking to replace <b>the</b> <b>common</b> <b>law</b> of judicial review. Instead, they borrowed from <b>the</b> <b>common</b> <b>law</b> {{by turning the}} clock back, and merely clarified the limits of judicial power {{in relation to the}} ISA. It has also been noted that the amendments do not compel the application of Lee Mau Seng, a High Court decision. If Lee Mau Seng is wrong, the Court of Appeal can still overrule it now.|$|E

5|$|During the 15th century, <b>the</b> <b>common</b> <b>law</b> {{courts were}} {{challenged}} by the civil law and equity found in the Chancery and similar courts. These courts and legal methods were much faster than <b>the</b> <b>common</b> <b>law</b> courts, so lawyers and claimants flocked to them. This was perceived {{as a threat to}} <b>the</b> <b>common</b> <b>law</b> courts, for good reason; between 1460 and 1540, the business of <b>the</b> <b>common</b> <b>law</b> courts significantly dropped, while the Chancery's cases rose massively in number. In reaction to this, the Court of King's Bench developed its own, faster system, intent on winning cases back, and through procedures such as the Writ of Quominus and Bill of Middlesex acquired a wider jurisdiction. While this succeeded in forming an equilibrium between the old common law courts and the new courts, it was viewed with suspicion by the Common Pleas, who became highly reactionary to the changes the King's Bench attempted to introduce. When the King's Bench attempted to use the Bill of Middlesex to widen its jurisdiction, the Common Pleas became increasingly conservative in its attempts to avoid ceding cases. This was limited {{by the fact that the}} three Common Pleas prothonotaries could not agree on how to cut costs, leaving the court both expensive and of limited malleability while the King's Bench became faster, cheaper and more varied in its jurisdiction.|$|E

5000|$|In {{cases of}} negligence, <b>the</b> Australian <b>common</b> <b>law</b> has, since 2002, used a {{criterion}} of 'salient features' {{to determine whether}} a duty of care should be imposed on the defendant. In contrast, <b>the</b> UK <b>common</b> <b>law</b> uses a three-stage test.|$|R
5|$|After the Chancery Regulation Act 1862 {{had gone}} some way toward {{procedural}} reform, in February 1867, Roundell Palmer again brought {{the problem of}} having two separate court systems to Parliament's attention, and in March 1870 Lord Hatherley introduced a bill to create a single, unified High Court of Justice. The bill was a weak one, not containing any provision addressing which court would deal with <b>the</b> <b>common</b> <b>law</b> and which with equity, and was also silent {{on the structure of}} the court, as Hatherley believed the difference between <b>the</b> <b>common</b> <b>law</b> and equity was one of procedure, not substance. As a result, the bill was heavily opposed from two sides: those who opposed fusion, and those who supported fusion but felt the provisions were too weak and vague to be of any use. As a result, the bill was eventually withdrawn.|$|E
5|$|Article 14(2)(a) of the Constitution {{provides}} that Parliament may restrict {{the right to}} {{freedom of speech and}} expression to provide against contempt of court. One of the more prominent uses of the court's contempt power has been for the Attorney-General to charge persons with <b>the</b> <b>common</b> <b>law</b> offence of scandalizing the court.|$|E
5|$|Coke's meaning {{has been}} disputed over the years; some {{interpret}} his judgment as referring to {{judicial review of}} statutes to correct misunderstandings which would render them unfair, while others argue he meant that <b>the</b> <b>common</b> <b>law</b> courts {{have the power to}} completely strike down those statutes they deem to be repugnant.|$|E

5|$|From {{the reign}} of King James I, the {{beginnings}} of a legal profession began to develop and the administration of criminal and civil justice was centralised. The growing activity of the parliament and the centralisation of administration in Scotland called for the better dissemination of Acts of the parliament to the courts and other enforcers of the law. Throughout the late fifteenth century, unsuccessful attempts were made to form commissions of experts to codify, update or define Scots law. The legal uncertainty that this situation created prompted increased reliance on <b>the</b> <b>common</b> <b>law</b> found in Canon law, {{and there are a number}} of examples of statutes from this period that clearly drew from Roman law. The general practice during this period, as evidenced from records of cases, seems to have been to defer to specific Scottish laws on a matter when available and to fill in any gaps with provisions from <b>the</b> <b>common</b> <b>law</b> embodied in Civil and Canon law, which had the advantage of being written.|$|E
5|$|Hale's posthumous {{legacy is}} his written work. He wrote {{a variety of}} texts, treatises and manuscripts, the most major of which are A History and Analysis of <b>the</b> <b>Common</b> <b>Law</b> of England, {{published}} in 1713, and the Historia Placitorum Coronæ, or The History of the Pleas of the Crown, published in 1736.|$|E
5|$|He {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{publicly}} known judges thanks to his report on the Profumo Affair. He was noted for his bold judgments running counter to the law at the time. During his 38-year career as a judge he made large changes to <b>the</b> <b>common</b> <b>law,</b> particularly while in the Court of Appeal, and although many of his decisions were overturned by the House of Lords several of them were confirmed by Parliament, which passed statutes in line with his judgments. Although appreciated for his role as 'the people's judge' and his support for the individual, Denning was also controversial for his campaign against <b>the</b> <b>common</b> <b>law</b> principle of precedent, and for comments he made regarding the Birmingham Six and Guildford Four, and also as Master of the Rolls for his conflict with the House of Lords.|$|E

5|$|In all, the New Court heard 77 cases {{during the}} Old Court – New Court controversy. In the April 1829 case of Hildreth's Heirs v. McIntire's Devisees, the reconstituted Court of Appeals {{declared}} {{all of these}} decisions void. In 1935, in Smith v. Overstreet's Adm'r, the court formally ruled that the decisions {{were not part of}} <b>the</b> <b>common</b> <b>law</b> of Kentucky.|$|E
5|$|The Chancery came to {{prominence}} after {{the decline of}} the Exchequer, dealing with the law of equity, something more fluid and adaptable than <b>the</b> <b>common</b> <b>law.</b> The early Court of Chancery dealt with verbal contracts, matters of land law and matters of trusts, and had a very liberal view when setting aside complaints; poverty, for example, was an acceptable reason to cancel a contract or obligation. Complaints were normally brought via a bill or petition, which had to show that <b>the</b> <b>common</b> <b>law</b> did not provide a remedy for the problem. The Chancery writs were in French, and later English, rather than the Latin used for common law bills. In the reign of Edward III, the Court found a fixed home at Westminster Hall, where it sat almost continually until its dissolution. Before this, justice was difficult to dispose because the Lord Chancellor had to travel with the King wherever he went.|$|E
5|$|The Marshall Court also issued {{important}} opinions regarding criminal procedure. Although the Court did {{not explicitly}} cite or quote constitutional provisions, its opinions remain influential {{in interpreting the}} Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment and venue provision of Article Three. The Court also laid down <b>the</b> <b>common</b> <b>law</b> rules of evidence in federal courts, including the hearsay exception for party admissions and the narrowing of the best evidence rule.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of {{reforming}} actions such as the Bill of Middlesex, the Common Pleas became increasingly conservative and resistant to King's Bench changes because of the impact they had on {{the business of the}} Common Pleas. This was best emphasised by Slade's Case, a struggle between the old and new forms of suing for breach of contract; although an equilibrium between <b>the</b> <b>common</b> <b>law</b> courts was finally reached, it eventually led to their dissolution with the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1873, and merger into a single High Court of Justice.|$|E
5|$|Denning made {{sweeping}} changes to <b>the</b> <b>Common</b> <b>Law,</b> with {{the resurrection of}} equitable estoppel and his reform of divorce law. A common misconception {{is that most of}} his judgments were overturned in the House of Lords; many were, including the expansion to the doctrine of fundamental breach he set out in Photo Production Ltd v Securicor Transport Ltd, but they let many judgments stand and on occasion agreed with his judgment in situations where he dissented, such as in his final case George Mitchell (Chesterhall) Ltd v Finney Lock Seeds Ltd in 1983.|$|E
5|$|In his High Court appeal Dietrich was {{represented}} by David Grace, QC. The main argument advanced on Dietrich's behalf was that his trial was a miscarriage of justice, since {{he did not have}} legal representation. He argued that he should have been provided with counsel at public expense, given the seriousness of the crime with which he was charged. Alternatively, he argued that the judge should have stayed or adjourned the trial until he was able to obtain counsel himself. His argument was based on <b>the</b> <b>common</b> <b>law</b> tradition that an accused is entitled to a fair trial.|$|E
40|$|In 1972 the Supreme Court in Illinois v. City of Milwaukee {{established}} <b>the</b> federal <b>common</b> <b>law</b> {{of public}} nuisance for the abatement {{of air and}} water pollution.
