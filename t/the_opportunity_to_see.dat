50|$|Subsequent dives will {{be planned}} {{to carry a}} human pilot {{to the bottom of}} the Arctic, Southern and Indian oceans. Less than 3% of the {{seafloor}} has been explored, and none of the deepest points of the planet's oceans have ever been explored beyond a brief visit <b>to</b> one. <b>The</b> <b>opportunities</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> and learn from such dives are viewed as monumental.|$|R
50|$|The Garvellachs are {{particularly}} {{well known to}} divers, with boats from Oban also taking groups down to the area. Increasingly many divers are basing their activities from Craobh Haven itself. The waters, though somewhat devoid of fish, offer some very clear waters and an extensive array of corals, seastars, anemone, shellfish and underwater topographical features. The trips out to the dive sites also offer <b>the</b> <b>opportunities</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> golden eagles, sea eagles and porpoises. Due to the fast flowing waters in the Firth of Lorne minke whales may also be viewed occasionally.|$|R

50|$|Quarrying at {{the site}} ceased in the early 20th century when a new quarry was opened nearby. Some caves were then used to {{cultivate}} mushrooms and others were used to dump waste from the new quarry. Guided tours of the caves are now run from spring to autumn. The caves provide a haven for hibernating bats in winter. The presence of the bats, along with <b>the</b> <b>opportunities</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> geological profiles that quarry faces allow, caused {{the old and new}} quarries to be declared a Site of Special Scientific Interest. The very rare Bechstein's bat and the greater and lesser horseshoe bats along with five other bat species are all found in the caves.|$|R
25|$|Although he {{petitioned the}} Soviet {{government}} {{for many years}} to be allowed to visit his mother, he was not allowed to do so until 1987, when his mother was dying and Mikhail Gorbachev consented to the visit. In 1989, he was invited to dance the role of James in La Sylphide with the Mariinsky Ballet at the Mariinsky Theatre in St. Petersburg.

25|$|The {{course is}} {{designed}} to give marketers <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> things {{from the point of}} view of their agency - learning through doing - which often gives them a completely new perspective on that relationship. It's also renowned throughout the industry for incredibly late nights and much drunken bonding, giving clients and agencies an insight into each other's worlds. It's even been known to influence real-world client/agency relationships, with one story speculating that many years ago, Guinness switched its multimillion-pound advertising account to J. Walter Thompson as a result of one such seminar.|$|E
25|$|Every November Fredericton {{hosts the}} Silver Wave Film Festival. Originally called the Tidal Wave Film Festival, {{it has been}} running since 2001.

25|$|The current Manchester airport {{began to}} take shape as a joint civil-military {{facility}} in the 1960s. The first major development at MHT was {{the construction of a new}} civilian terminal, and the first modern air traffic control tower in New Hampshire, in 1961. Roscoe A. Ammon, a successful businessman, donated $500,000 for the construction of the new civilian air terminal. Unfortunately, Roscoe Ammon died of cancer less than two weeks before the terminal was opened, and thus missed <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the product of his generous donation. A new passenger terminal was later built in 1994. In 1966, the Air Force removed its remaining forces and closed Grenier AFB, leaving the airport open for expansion. In 1978 the airfield was renamed Manchester Airport.|$|E

25|$|Tibullus's {{first book}} {{consists}} of poems written {{at various times}} between 30 and 26. His first love, the subject of book i., is called Delia in the poems, but Apuleius (Apol. 10) reveals that her real name was Plania. As regards her station, it should be noticed {{that she was not}} entitled to wear the stola, the dress of Roman matrons (i. 6, 68). Her husband is mentioned as absent (i. 2, 67 seq.). She eludes the custodes placed over her (i. 2, 15 and 6, 7). Tibullus's suit was favoured by Delia's mother, of whom he speaks in very affectionate terms (i. 6, 57 seq.). For Tibullus's illness at Corcyra, see i. 3, I seq., 55 seq. The fifth elegy was written during estrangement (discidium), and the sixth after the return of the husband and during Delia's double infidelity. It is impossible to give an exact account of the intimacy. The poems which refer to her are arranged in no chronological order. Sometimes she appears as single, sometimes as married; but we hear nothing either of her marriage or of her husband's death. Yet it is clear that it was the absence of her husband on military service in Cilicia which gave Tibullus <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> her, and he continued to do so when the husband returned. Delia was clever in deception—too clever, as Tibullus saw when he found that he was not the only lover. His entreaties and appeals were of no avail; and after the first book no more is heard of Delia. In addition, several elegies in Book I concern themselves with Tibullus's love for a boy, who is named Marathus.|$|E
25|$|Some {{believe that}} those who have a high degree of {{cognitive}} impairment, such as an intellectual disability, are unable to process the loss of those around them, but this is untrue, those with cognitive impairments such as an intellectual disability are able to process grief in a similar manner to those without cognitive impairment. One of the main differences between those with an intellectual disability and those without, is typically the ability to verbalize their feelings about the loss, which is why non-verbal cues and changes in behavior become so important, because these are usually signs of distress and expression of grief among this population. It is important when working with individuals with these such impairments that caregivers and family members meet them where their level of functioning is and allow them to process the loss and grief with assistance given where needed, and not to ignore the grief that these individuals undergo. An important aspect of treatment of grief for those with an intellectual disability is family involvement where possible, this can be a biological family or a family created in a group home or clinical setting. By having the family involved in an open and supporting dialogue with the individual it helps them to process. However, if the family is not properly educated on how these individuals handle loss, their involvement may not be as beneficial than those who are educated. The importance of the family unit is very crucial in a soci-cognitive approach to bereavement counseling. In this approach the individual with intellectual disability has <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> how those around them handle the loss and have the opportunity to act accordingly by modeling behavior. This approach also helps the individual know that their emotions are ok and normal.|$|E
500|$|Angel Heart was {{released}} on VHS on September 24, 1987 by International Video Entertainment (IVE). The releases included the R-rated theatrical cut, and an uncut version which restored the ten seconds of sexual content that was removed to satisfy the MPAA. Ralph King, {{senior vice president of}} IVE, said, [...] "The scene cut from Angel Heart is both provocative and shocking, but {{it is by no means}} pornographic.

[...] Tap dancing's popularity was nearing a new peak as well, with three major American cities (Houston, Texas; Portland, Oregon; Washington, D.C.) hosting tap-dance festivals. In movie theaters, the dance drama Tap was introducing Sims's footwork (and that of his former student Gregory Hines) to audiences who had never had <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> him perform before.|$|E
500|$|According to {{contemporary}} sportswriter Grantland Rice, only two sports {{figures of the}} 1920s approached Ruth in popularity—boxer Jack Dempsey and racehorse Man o' War. One {{of the factors that}} contributed to Ruth's broad appeal was the uncertainty about his family and early life. Ruth appeared to exemplify the American success story, that even an uneducated, unsophisticated youth, without any family wealth or connections, can do something better {{than anyone else in the}} world. Montville noted that [...] "the fog [...] will make him forever accessible, universal. He will be the patron saint of American possibility." [...] Similarly, the fact that Ruth played in the pre-television era, when a relatively small portion of his fans had <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> him play allowed his legend to grow through word of mouth and the hyperbole of sports reporters. Reisler noted that recent sluggers who surpassed Ruth's 60-home run mark, such as Mark McGwire and Barry Bonds, generated much less excitement than when Ruth repeatedly broke the single-season home run record in the 1920s. Ruth dominated a relatively small sports world, while Americans of the present era have many sports available to watch.|$|E
500|$|Ahead of {{the start}} of the 2011–12 season, Ferguson {{confirmed}} that Pogba would feature with the senior team during the season, stating, [...] "I mean if we hold Pogba back, what's going to happen?

So we have to give him <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> how he can do in the first-team and he's got great ability." [...] Pogba was promoted to the club's reserve team permanently for the 2011–12 season and made his first appearance of the season on 15 August 2011 in the team's opening Premier Reserve League match against Arsenal. On 25 August, in the team's second league match against Swansea City reserves, Pogba scored the second goal in a 6–0 rout. On 19 September, he was named to the first team to participate in their Football League Cup tie against Leeds United the following day, with Ferguson proclaiming, [...] "I intend to play him [...] against Leeds United." [...] Pogba appeared as a half-time substitute to make his professional debut as Manchester United won the match 3–0. Pogba made his second appearance against Aldershot Town in the Fourth Round of the League Cup on 25 October 2011.|$|E

5000|$|Lawson {{was invited}} to {{contribute}} three paintings to the landmark Armory Show of 1913. Like many American artists at the time, he {{was not prepared to}} abandon representational art for the new paths suggested by Cubism, Fauvism, and Futurism, but he was open to learning more about Post-Impressionism (which he had first been exposed to in Europe), and in New York <b>the</b> <b>opportunities</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> Post-Impressionists increased considerably after the Armory Show. [...] "Acquaintance with Cézanne's painting convinced Lawson that Impressionism had lost contact with form in its insistence upon surface light, and in his later works he made an obvious attempt to recapture solidity. Although he never completely assimilated Cézanne's structural methods, Lawson managed to introduce a measure of form into his art and some resemblance to the Aix master...as he dropped the coloristic haze and the pastel prettiness inherited from Twachtman." ...|$|R
