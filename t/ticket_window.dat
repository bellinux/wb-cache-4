25|$|Although the Uptown Theater {{has been}} demolished, the {{exterior}} of the building remains largely unmodified. The theater's lobby is now the dining room of a Qdoba restaurant, but the old <b>ticket</b> <b>window</b> can still be recognized as part of the storefront.|$|E
25|$|A second platform, for an {{extension}} of the siding, or a full-blown second track, was originally planned for the station. The pedestrian bridge is wide enough for this extra construction, and the bridge's stairway {{on the far side of}} the station has a landing on the same level as the unbuilt outbound platform, symmetrical with the landing on the other side which is part of the existing platform. A <b>ticket</b> <b>window</b> was proposed to be established but it has yet to occur.|$|E

50|$|Most TRA {{stations}} feature staffed ticket offices, {{supplemented by}} ticket vending machines (TVMs) at busy locations. Unreserved single or day-return tickets must be purchased {{on the day}} of travel (to prevent ticket reuse), leading to ticket queues at peak commuter periods. Passengers purchasing advance tickets can delay entire queues, causing imminent train departures to be missed. To maximize passenger throughput, separate <b>ticket</b> <b>windows</b> provide train information, today's tickets, and advance or commutation tickets. Some daily <b>ticket</b> <b>windows</b> only accept cash, further decreasing transaction times. <b>Ticket</b> <b>windows</b> at busy stations can be dynamically switched between different functions, minimizing daily ticket queues.|$|R
25|$|Many {{locomotives}} and freight {{and passenger}} cars are on display. Some have open cabs and compartments that visitors can climb in and walk through, including a mail car, railroad executives' passenger car (with dining room and sleeping / lounge areas), a boxcar, two cabooses, and a recreated DL station with <b>ticket</b> <b>window.</b> A steam locomotive with cutaway sections helps visitors understand steam power. Part {{of one of the}} 1865 roundhouse inspection pits uncovered in archaeological excavations is also preserved in situ, under glass.|$|E
25|$|A {{boy with}} a ruffled collar stands {{performing}} {{in front of the}} platform {{at the top of the}} central stairs. Despite appearances, the door behind him is on a different plane from the <b>ticket</b> <b>window.</b> The rectangular structure behind the trombonist (to the right), defines the edge of the platform and shows the admission price. Above the poster is the gas pipe support beam. The trombonist stands shadowed on a pedestal (left of the central stairs) several meters in front of the platform, illuminated from the rear. While the tuba player is faceless, the red faces of the clarinetist and cornet players show that they stand on the gaslit platform.|$|E
25|$|Ivan Allen Jr. Braves Museum and Hall of Fame: Located {{along the}} {{northwest}} side at Aisle 134 {{and served as}} the franchise's main museum. Admission to the museum and hall of fame could be purchased at the Braves <b>ticket</b> <b>window.</b> It was open year-round, and served as the starting and ending point for stadium tours, which were offered to the public on dates when the stadium was dormant and on mornings preceding night games. While the stadium was in use, the museum was featured as a Scout's Alley attraction, and was open to game ticket holders for an additional fee (paid in Scouts Alley tokens).|$|E

25|$|The {{entrance}} of the circus tent consists of <b>ticket</b> <b>window</b> and doors {{at the center of}} a platform atop six steps. On both sides of the doors (here painted green), musicians and acrobats perform a sideshow on the balustraded platform to entice passersby. Those interested in purchasing tickets from the ticket seller—the man and woman toward the bottom right of the painting—climb the central stairs. Ticket holders queue parallel to the sideshow stage. The diagonal line behind the trombonist is the handrail for the subsidiary stairs. A woman with a young girl is buying a ticket on the platform to the right of the ringmaster. Just as the musicians toward the left, they are immersed in the orange glow of nine gas jets (each possessing a perceptible blue-violet aura) that illuminate the platform. Five yellow-white globes of interior lamps are visible through the ticket windows. The conspicuous tree to the left bares the presence of a human figure.|$|E
25|$|Inside, {{the walls}} are single skinned. The {{south-west}} end of the building contains the office and the former goods room, with a small walled cubicle at the south-west (goods room) end. The partition wall between the office and the goods room has been removed. There are two windows (one casement and one with timber louvres) at the south-west end of the space, along with a door to the platform and a casement window to the south-east (Kamerunga Road) elevation. The office space, which retains some timber counters, has a casement window and a modern sliding window on the south-east side, two sash windows on the north-west elevation, and a stable door and <b>ticket</b> <b>window</b> on the north-east side, through to the waiting shed. The waiting shed retains its bench seating, and has a glass-louvre window to the south-east elevation and a timber double folding door to the platform. North-east of the waiting shed is the ladies toilet, with a doorway to the platform and a small glass louvre window to the south-east. The remains of gardens, with concrete retaining walls to Kamerunga Road, are located south- west of the station building.|$|E
25|$|The wide stairs {{leading from}} the subway land in the {{southern}} third of the building at a ticket hall and waiting area, which is open on both sides. A painted steel mid-rail runs the length of these stairs. Opposite the stair void the gaps between the piers are filled with screens made with a metal frame and grill panel bolted to the brick surrounds and resting on low brick walls. The internal faces of the piers are rendered and painted. The ticket windows are directly opposite the stair landing. Only the western one is currently in use, the other now hidden behind a freestanding automatic ticket machine. A number of timetable wall-boxes line the available wall space, one being an early timber example. One of the original chrome-plated ticket rails {{in front of the}} operating <b>ticket</b> <b>window</b> remains. The floor is lined with a chequered pattern of black and white terrazzo tiles, while the ceiling is made with fibrous cement sheeting. A stainless steel downpipe marks {{the top of the stairs}} and the endpoint of the middle handrail. There were four downpipes in the original design, one next to what had been the telephone box on the south-eastern facade, another between the office and store and another between the toilet and waiting area. How many still exist is unknown as three were enclosed in various walls along the centreline of the building and cannot be viewed. It is likely that some if not all remain.|$|E

500|$|Unlike other Nazi {{concentration}} camps across German-occupied Europe, in which prisoners {{were used as}} forced labour for the German war effort, death camps (Vernichtungslager) like Treblinka, Bełżec, and Sobibór had only one function: to kill those sent there. To prevent incoming victims from realising its nature, Treblinka II was disguised as a transit camp for deportations further east, complete with made-up train schedules, a fake train-station clock with hands painted on it, names of destinations, a fake <b>ticket</b> <b>window,</b> and the sign [...] "Ober Majdan", a code word for Treblinka commonly used to deceive passengers departing from Western Europe. Majdan was a prewar landed estate [...] away from the camp.|$|E
500|$|A small {{train station}} officially named Minnehaha Depot but {{also known as}} [...] "the Princess Depot" [...] was built around 1875; it was {{a stop on the}} Milwaukee Road {{railroad}} and provided easy access to the park from Fort Snelling and Minneapolis. The depot handled as many as 39 round trips per day. The interior is complete and well-preserved, containing an iron heating stove, waiting room benches and a <b>ticket</b> <b>window.</b> [...] In 1964, the title was transferred to the Minnesota Historical Society. The Minnesota Transportation Museum assisted in the restoration of the building, and today provides historic interpretation. [...] The depot is open in the summer on Sundays from 1:30 to 4:30. The 50th Street / Minnehaha Park light rail station of the METRO Blue Line currently serves the park.|$|E
500|$|The Room {{played in}} the Laemmle Fairfax and Fallbrook {{for the next two}} weeks, {{grossing}} a total of [...] before it was pulled from circulation. Toward the end of its run, the Laemmle Fallbrook theatre displayed two signs {{on the inside of the}} <b>ticket</b> <b>window</b> in relation to the film: one that read [...] "NO REFUNDS" [...] and another citing a blurb from an early review: [...] "This film is like being stabbed in the head." [...] During one showing in the second week of its run, one of the few audience members in attendance was 5-Second Films' Michael Rousselet, who found unintentional humor in the film's poor dialogue and production values. After treating the screening as his [...] "own private Mystery Science Theater", Rousselet began encouraging friends to join him for future showings to mock the film, starting a word-of-mouth campaign that resulted in about 100 attending the film's final screening. Rousselet and his friends saw the film [...] "four times in three days," [...] and it was in these initial screenings that many of The Room traditions were born, such as the throwing of spoons and footballs during the film.|$|E

500|$|Meanwhile, the {{original}} location of that wall is outlined by bricks {{extending from the}} left-center field wall across Roberto Clemente Drive and into the sidewalk. A plaque embedded in the sidewalk marks the spot where Mazeroski's home run cleared the wall. The left-center and center field brick wall with [...] "457 FT" [...] and [...] "436 FT" [...] painted on it still stands at its original location, along with the stadium's flagpole, adjacent to the University of Pittsburgh's Mervis and Posvar Halls. Despite not technically being the correct section of wall where Mazeroski's famous home run cleared, it is often locally referred to as [...] "Mazeroski's Wall." [...] This portion of the wall remained after Forbes Field was torn down, and was refurbished in 2006 {{in time for the}} All-Star Game hosted in Pittsburgh. In addition, a wooden replica of an entrance to the stadium, including a <b>ticket</b> <b>window</b> and players entrance, was constructed and placed near the remaining wall in 2006. [...] The home plate used in the stadium's final game remains preserved in the University of Pittsburgh's Posvar Hall. However, its location has been altered; author John McCollister wrote, [...] "Had architects placed home plate in its precise spot about half of the Pirates fans could not view it. The reason: {{it would have to be}} on display in the fifth stall of the ladies' restroom." [...] However, {{the original}} location of the home plate has been more recently determined by others to be approximately 81 feet away from its current display, just inside the GSPIA/Economics Library, and not in a restroom as has been popularly believed.|$|E
2500|$|Itinerant fairs {{housed in}} {{temporary}} {{structures such as}} the Circus Corvi [...] made seasonal appearances along the boulevards of Paris. Seurat's interest in these fairs produced several studies in anticipation of Parade de cirque, including a series of cafe-concert performances, performing saltimbanques or acrobats. The name Fernand Corvi appears on Seurat's small sketch for the <b>ticket</b> <b>window.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Major {{renovation}} of the third station took place in 1910, which included the installation of a [...] "huge electric sign" [...] placed {{at the corner of}} Franklin and Fayette streets. The company spent several hundred dollars in order to widen the Fayette Street entrance [...] and add concrete steps. Additionally, three [...] "good sized" [...] private offices were converted into a large waiting room with new maple floors, decorations, steel ceilings and comfortable seating. A hole was cut through the back partition for a <b>ticket</b> <b>window</b> and plate glass windows were installed in the main waiting room and an [...] "electric light sign" [...] was placed in the corner. A lavatory for women was added just off the waiting room and the room formerly used for a waiting room in the back corner was converted for storage purposes. The third depot was demolished in 1936.|$|E
2500|$|Promoting {{itself as}} Madison's family {{vaudeville}} house, the Majestic was immediately popular. Only months after opening contractor John H. Findorff {{was hired to}} add a balcony and theater boxes, raising capacity to nearly 500, plus a second <b>ticket</b> <b>window</b> to accommodate the many patrons. Performers were hired through the United Booking Agency and Klaw and Erlanger, and later the Western Vaudeville Managers' Association. Before celebrating their first year the Biederstadt brothers were already seeking to acquire theaters in La Crosse, Winona and Minneapolis, as well as making an offer on Madison's Fuller Opera House. The Biederstaedts took on a partner and incorporated with $50,000 capital as the Majestic Amusement Company. They rented out the Majestic as meeting space, hosting a convention of Wisconsin fire chiefs in 1909. They also began showing their first [...] "moving pictures" [...] in 1908. Three years later, the Biederstaedts' fortunes had changed. Edward's [...] "nervous" [...] wife shot herself in the head [...] {{on the eve of}} the opening of a competing vaudeville theater, the New Orpheum. He himself would die four months later.|$|E
2500|$|Sunol Depot This one-story Stick style depot {{was built}} to Southern Pacific {{standard}} design No. 7 in 1884. Railroads such as the SPRR created standard depot designs to serve the many towns along its lines and represents an early application of standard architectural designs on a large scale. More than economical, this standardization created a predictable experience for employees and customers, {{and contributed to the}} company’s branding. A “combination depot” such as this housed facilities for a company agent, freight and passengers in one building and were designed to serve small towns such as Sunol. Out of at least eleven No. 7 depots built by the railroad, Sunol is the last one remaining. [...] It is 19 feet wide and 67 feet long. The roof is divided into two parts with a gable roof over the east end, and an elevated hip roof over the freight room to the west. Decorative scroll cut brackets supported the eaves and similar bargeboards adorn the east gable end. The depot is divided into a series of rooms to serve a variety of functions. Starting from the east, the first room is the passenger waiting room. The agents office is next to the west and features a five-window bay on the track side from which the company’s agent would conduct business related to train operations. This room also contained a public counter at which business could be conducted with shippers, and a small <b>ticket</b> <b>window</b> connects this office with the passenger waiting room. The next room was the baggage room and is currently used for storage. Finally, the freight room takes {{up the rest of the}} building and is set about forty inches above grade so that its floor would be level with the floor of freight cars and teamsters’ wagons. This room is now used for exhibits and meetings. The freight room had been surrounded on three sides by a freight platform to facilitate the loading and unloading of freight from rail cars that would have been positioned next to this platform. A track had been located north of the building between the platform and the mainline for this purpose.|$|E
