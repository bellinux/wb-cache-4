At 20 years old he was the youngest player in the majors and came close to picking up the win, but the team's closer, Jeremy Affeldt, gave up the lead with two outs in <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ninth</b> inning.|$|E
5|$|Red Sox closer Foulke came in {{to pitch}} <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ninth.</b> Pujols led off the inning by hitting a single through Foulke's legs and into center field. After Foulke induced Rolen into a fly out and struck out Edmonds, Pujols took second base, but no stolen base due to fielder's indifference. Édgar Rentería then hit a ground ball that bounced back to Foulke on the mound. Foulke threw it underhand to Doug Mientkiewicz at first base to end the game, and secure the series.|$|E

5|$|After his {{retirement}} from baseball, Grove {{continued to work}} with his uncle. His legacy lived on in his nephew, Wayne Grove. While playing for the Bellwood Lions of the Chicago Little League, Wayne pitched a no-hitter and struck out 15, and narrowly missed a perfect game when a runner got on base with two outs in <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ninth</b> inning. Despite an unimpressive Major League career, Grove earned a few votes for induction into the Hall of Fame, receiving five votes in the 1958 balloting (1.9% of the required votes needed) and seven in the 1960 balloting (2.6% of the required votes needed).|$|E
5|$|Evers {{rejoined the}} Braves as a scout. As Braves owner Emil Fuchs sold manager Rogers Hornsby to the Cubs and assumed {{managerial}} duties {{himself for the}} 1929 season, Fuchs hired Evers as a coach. Fuchs had no experience as a field manager, and so Evers became captain of the Braves, directing the team during the game and dealing with umpires. Evers and fellow coach Hank Gowdy played in one game in the 1929 season, coming into <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ninth</b> inning on October 6, 1929. In the process, Evers became the oldest {{player in the league}} for the year.|$|E

With Bob Rush on the mound for Chicago, Roberts managed a walk and was replaced on base by Caballero, who promptly took second base on a hit and run groundout by first baseman Eddie Waitkus. A single to center field by Richie Ashburn allowed the speedy Caballero to score from second and completed the doubleheader sweep for Philadelphia—Bubba Church having pitched a three-hit shutout {{in the first game}} earlier in the day.|$|E

5|$|Cards' player-manager Rogers Hornsby chose Alexander {{to start}} Game6, and used him in relief to close out Game7. Behind Alexander, the Cardinals won {{the final two}} games of the series, {{and with it the}} world championship. In Game7, the Yankees, {{trailing}} 3–2 in <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ninth</b> inning and down to their last out, Ruth walked, bringing up Bob Meusel. Ruth, successful in half of his stolen base attempts in his career, took off for second base on the first pitch. Meusel swung and missed, and catcher Bob O'Farrell threw to second baseman Hornsby who tagged Ruth out, ending Game 7 and thereby crowning his Cardinals World Series champions for the first time. The 1926 World Series is the only Series to date which ended with a baserunner being caught stealing.|$|E
5|$|Chad Durbin {{relieved}} Happ {{in the top}} of the seventh. He walked Johnny Damon, {{who then}} stole second base. Rodriguez was then hit by a pitch, and Damon scored on a single by Jorge Posada. Joba Chamberlain relieved Pettitte in the bottom of the seventh and retired the side in order. Brett Myers retired the first two batters {{in the top of}} the eighth, but Hideki Matsui then hit a solo home run pinch hitting for Chamberlain. Phil Hughes pitched a third of an inning in <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ninth</b> and allowed a solo home run to Carlos Ruiz before being relieved by Mariano Rivera. Rivera closed out the game, throwing just five pitches to record the final two outs. This game was Pettitte's 17th career postseason win, extending his MLB record.|$|E
5|$|In the 2014 National League Championship Series, Ishikawa batted 5-for-13 (.385) with 7 RBIs. He {{recorded}} the game-winning RBI in Game 1 {{and drove in}} three runs via a bases-loaded double in Game 3. In Game 5, with the Giants leading the series three games to one, Ishikawa hit a 3-run walk-off home run in <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ninth</b> inning off of St. Louis Cardinals pitcher Michael Wacha to clinch the pennant for the Giants and their third World Series appearance {{in the past five}} seasons. Ishikawa's home run was the first to send a National League team to the World Series since Bobby Thomson's Shot Heard 'Round the World in 1951. Ishikawa's home run was the first ever to end an NLCS and the fourth to end any LCS, after Chris Chambliss (1976 ALCS), Aaron Boone (2003 ALCS), and Magglio Ordonez (2006 ALCS).|$|E

5|$|On April 16, 1981, the New York Yankees made {{a stop in}} Nashville to play an {{exhibition}} game against the Sounds. The 10–1 Yankees victory was played {{in front of a}} standing-room only crowd of 17,318spectators. Some Yankees present at the game included owner George Steinbrenner, coach Yogi Berra, and players Reggie Jackson, Bucky Dent, Lou Piniella, Bobby Murcer, Goose Gossage, Tommy John, and Johnny Oates. The Yankees returned for another game against the Sounds on April 28, 1983. Former Sound Don Mattingly, as well as Yankees manager Billy Martin and pitcher Goose Gossage were in attendance. The Sounds, who trailed the Yankees, 4–0, going into <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ninth</b> inning, scored five runs to beat the Yankees, 5–4, before a crowd of 13,641.|$|E
5|$|On September 28, 1938, the {{two teams}} met for the second game of the series, where Hartnett {{experienced}} the highlight of his career. With darkness descending on the lightless Wrigley Field and the score tied at 5 runs apiece, the umpires ruled that the ninth inning {{would be the last}} to be played. The entire game would have to be replayed the following day if the score remained tied. Hartnett came to bat with two out in <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ninth</b> inning. With a count of 0 balls and 2 strikes, Hartnett connected on a Mace Brown pitch, launching the ball into the darkness, before it eventually landed in the left-center field bleachers. The stadium erupted into pandemonium as players and fans stormed the field to escort Hartnett around the bases. Hartnett's walk-off home run became immortalized as the Homer in the Gloamin'.|$|E
5|$|After {{the game}} resumed, Labine scored on {{back-to-back}} singles by Reese and Snider. The Giants then {{came up to}} bat, failing to earn a hit as the score became 6–0 after six innings. To start the seventh inning, Al Corwin replaced Bill Rigney for the Giants, who had pinch hit for Spencer. Andy Pafko {{hit a home run}} to start the inning, and Hodges walked; he later scored on the fifth and final error made by the Giants to make the score 8–0. The bottom of the seventh and the eighth inning passed without a hit. In the ninth inning, Walker hit a home run, the fourth of the game, to make the score 10–0. The Giants failed to get a hit in <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ninth,</b> ending the game. Labine pitched a six-hit shutout, not allowing a hit in the final four innings as the series went to a deciding third game.|$|E

5|$|Hartnett was an {{all-around}} player, performing well both offensively and defensively. Known for {{his strong}} and accurate throwing arm, he routinely led the National League's catchers in caught stealing percentage {{and was the}} first major league catcher to hit more than 20 home runs in a season. During the course of his career, he took part {{of some of the most}} memorable events in Major League Baseball history including; Babe Ruth's Called Shot during the 1932 World Series, Carl Hubbell's strike-out performance in the 1934 All-Star Game and Dizzy Dean's career-altering injury during the 1937 All-Star Game. But the greatest moment of Hartnett's career came with one week left in the 1938 season, when he hit a game-winning home run in <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ninth</b> inning to put the Cubs in first place.

5|$|In Game 6 of the 2011 World Series, {{with the}} Texas Rangers leading the game 7–5, and leading the series by 3 games to 2, Freese came to bat in <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ninth</b> with two out {{and two men}} on base. With a count of one ball and two strikes, Freese hit a two-run triple off Neftalí Feliz {{just out of the}} reach of Nelson Cruz to tie the game and send it to extra innings. In the 11th inning, again with two strikes, Freese hit a game-winning lead-off, walk-off, solo home-run to deep center field (420feet), to send the World Series to its first Game 7 since 2002. Freese joined Jim Edmonds, the man he was traded for, as the only players in Cardinals history to hit an extra-inning walk-off home run in the postseason. He joined Aaron Boone (2003), David Ortiz (2004) and Hall of Famers Carlton Fisk (1975) and Kirby Puckett (1991) as the only players to hit an extra-inning walk-off home run when their team was facing postseason elimination.|$|E
5|$|In a game {{versus the}} Reds on June9, {{the score was}} tied 5–5in <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ninth</b> inning when Stivetts {{connected}} for a pinch-hit, walk-off solo home run. This was his second career walk off home run, his third as a pinch hitter, and the last home run of his career. It was reported on July22 that a deal had been agreed upon to trade Stivetts to the St. Louis Browns of the NL for Kid Carsey and cash. The deal was contingent upon the acceptance of Stivetts. In early August, the Boston manager Selee sent Stivetts home, commenting that the team did not have use of his services any longer. Tim Hurst, now managing St. Louis, planned on using Stivetts in center field. Stivetts {{refused to accept the}} move to St. Louis, and a sale was officially conducted on August14 that sent him to St. Louis for $2000 and an unnamed player. True to his word, Stivetts did not report, or play a single game for St. Louis that season. Due to his objection to being sold to St. Louis, he claimed that he would remain in Ashland and return to coal mining.|$|E

In {{a game against the}} Chicago Cubs on September 23, Tenney could not play due to an attack of lumbago; it was the only game he did not play in during the season. Rookie Fred Merkle took his spot at first base. The game was at a 1–1 tie in <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ninth.</b> Merkle, after hitting a single, was at first, and Moose McCormick was at third, with two outs. Al Bridwell singled to center field, but Hank O'Day called Merkle out because Merkle had not touched second base. O'Day ruled the game a 1–1 tie due to darkness.

5|$|In {{the ninth}} inning, Sad Sam Jones, a 22-year veteran in the American League, {{replaced}} Dutch Ruether, who had replaced pitcher Shawkey. Jones gave up an inside-the-park home run to Thevenow. Thevenow {{had only two}} other home runs in his career, {{both of which were}} inside-the-park and during the 1926 regular season. Jones then walked Douthit and Hornsby and gave up a single to Southworth.

The Yankees led 10–4 and did not get any more runs or hits in the eighth or ninth inning. The Cardinals came up to bat in <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ninth</b> inning with Hoyt trying {{to hold on to}} his six-run lead. Hornsby singled to right field and advanced to second base on the following play. He then ran home to score a run on a Les Bell single to center field. Hafey then popped up in foul territory, and Severeid made the catch. The game ended with a 10–5 score. Waite Hoyt pitched a complete game, allowing two earned runs on 14 hits while striking out eight batters. The Cardinals' five pitchers combined to give up 10 Yankee runs and 14 hits.
