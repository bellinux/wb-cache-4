40|$|This article aims {{to retrace}} the <b>technology</b> <b>watch</b> {{strategy}} proposed to the Moroccan institute {{of scientific and}} technical information (IMIST) to serve the small and middle-sized exporters industries (SMI) of the food sector and of the textile, clothing and leather sector, situated {{in the region of}} the Big Casablanca. To elaborate this strategy, it was necessary to study the practice of the technological watch in the studied SMI and their needs of the scientific, technical and technological information (STTI). It was also useful to study some successful international experiences of <b>technology</b> <b>watch</b> and to analyze the literature produced in the same field. To reach our objectives, we have used the descriptive method used to study the needs of information. The research instrument used for the collection of data on the practice of the technological watch and on the needs in STTI was the questionnaire administrated directly to the industrials of the two sectors studied. A second questionnaire was sent to some international famous organisms of the <b>technology</b> <b>watch.</b> Visits were done to the institute of the scientific and technical information (INIST) and the agency of broadcasting of technological information (ADIT) in France. For the sectors studied, the investigation revealed that the SMI exporters studied suffer from conjectural and structural problems which hinder their development and affect their competitiveness. Although the SMI is conscious of the necessity to innovate, it asserts a lack of encouragement and assistance of the state so as to shift to the liberal economy. The study reveals that the <b>technology</b> <b>watch</b> practiced by the SMI consists essentially on sporadic and isolated actions done to resolve crises and to face rapid changes operated in its environment. All the SMI agree on the urgent need to receive the pertinent and reliable information in order to take right decisions...|$|E

40|$|Many {{decisions}} {{taken by}} mankind are rational {{only to a}} limited extent. This holds for individual travel behaviour, but also for long-range strategic decisions on transport systems or transport technology. In any decision problem, coping with uncertainty is the most critical element. The introduction of new transport technology is surrounded by uncertainty. For example, there is uncertainty about the pace and extent of adoption of new technology and there is uncertainty {{about the impact of}} new technology in terms of increased sustainability or increased efficiency. This article maps uncertainty surrounding new transport technology and identifies ways in which to deal with uncertainty in policy making. The findings will be illustrated with electric vehicles, particularly with two specific strategies to deal with uncertainty: interactive <b>technology</b> <b>watching</b> and experimentation in a market niche. The paper concludes with a discussion of success factors that influence the outcomes of such strategies...|$|R
40|$|As {{part of the}} PASR 2006 {{supporting}} activity STACCATO {{an investigation}} into a European ¿Technology Watch¿ for security was conducted using amongst other means an expert workshop. This activity was run in parallel to the competence mapping of the security industry and academia of Europe {{which resulted in a}} database and separate report (STACCATO Deliverable 2. 1. 1). Primary tasks for the <b>technology</b> <b>watch</b> could be 1 : policy support: i. e. identifying security areas/topics in need of greater European focus and feedback on outcome of enacted policy; 2 : ¿technology warning¿, monitoring emerging technologies for possible side effects detrimental to societal security; 3. technology transfer support, particularly for SME¿s since they are generally not capable of fielding their own <b>technology</b> <b>watch</b> efforts. A <b>Technology</b> <b>watch</b> effort should be based on one or more already existing stakeholder networks of established European actors in the security arena ¿ a ¿club of the willing¿, containing at least 10 actors from both industry and academia. Such an organisation would need to be relied upon to be neutral and impartial, thus the work process must be fully transparent and open to scrutiny, i. e. with all conclusions traceable to their individual sources. The organisation and supporting processes need to promote speed and flexibility, in particular in order to help accelerate the standardisation process of emerging technologies and solutions. JRC.
