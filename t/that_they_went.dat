5|$|Chicago Bears quarterback Jim McMahon, on {{the active}} roster {{for the first}} time in the season, came off the bench in the third quarter to rally the Bears past the Buccaneers. He scored a {{touchdown}} on a quarterback sneak with six minutes to go, and tied the game with a touchdown pass to Neal Anderson with 1:28 to go. The Buccaneers allowed seven sacks, but led for most of the game. The Bears were aided by the Buccaneers' poor clock management and their reliance on a conservative offense in the fourth quarter. Perkins denied accusations <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>went</b> to a prevent defense and a three-man rush, but admitted that they played too conservatively on defense at the end. Steve DeBerg threw touchdown passes to Calvin Magee and Jeff Smith on the Buccaneers' first two possessions. On the Bears' next possession, Ron Holmes' hit on Mike Tomczak forced a fumble that was recovered in the end zone by Winston Moss to give the Buccaneers a 20–0 lead. The Bears scored two quick touchdowns in the second quarter, but the Buccaneers extended their lead with two Donald Igwebuike field goals. With the Bears struggling on offense, McMahon was inserted into the game. McMahon was 12 of 14 for 144yards and led the Bears to 156yards of offense in the last two drives, compared with 142 in the first 50minutes of the game. A win would have tied the Buccaneers with the Bears for first place in the NFC Central.|$|E
5|$|His first {{appearance}} outside Final Fantasy VII {{was as a}} selectable character in the fighting game Ehrgeiz. A redesigned Sephiroth also appears in the North American and European versions of Kingdom Hearts as an optional boss character in Olympus Coliseum. Lance Bass voiced Sephiroth in this game, while in subsequent titles he was replaced by George Newbern. In the Japanese re-release of the game, Final Mix, an additional scene was added in which Sephiroth fights Cloud, although {{the result of the}} fight is not revealed. Sephiroth {{was not included in the}} sequel , as director Tetsuya Nomura could not give him a storyline related to Cloud, and he feared negative fan response if Sephiroth did not have a notable role in the story. His third appearance outside Final Fantasy VII is as another optional boss in Kingdom Hearts II, where he is first encountered by the series' protagonist, Sora, and then Cloud, who is pursuing him. When Sephiroth battles Cloud, both of them disappear, with Sora believing <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>went</b> somewhere else to continue their fight. Nomura said that in this game, Sephiroth represents Cloud's dark side, in contrast to Tifa Lockhart, who represents his light side. Although Sephiroth does not appear in the prequel Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep, he is mentioned as a hero that Zack Fair aspires to be. The staff, however, did not know if they would portray him as a being of darkness as shown in other titles. Sephiroth's fourth outside appearance is in the Itadaki Street games Special and Portable, where he appears as an unlockable playable character. Due to Sephiroth's many appearances as a boss in the Kingdom Hearts series, Square Enix is not sure whether he will return in Kingdom Hearts III as it would be redundant.|$|E

25|$|In {{contrast}} to expulsions from other nations or states, {{the expulsion of}} the Germans from Hungary was dictated from outside Hungary.

Three percent of the German pre-war population (about 20,000 people) had been evacuated by the Volksbund before <b>that.</b> <b>They</b> <b>went</b> to Austria, but many had returned.

The land was well-suited to the Turks—dry and inhospitable for their enemy, it was open, with plenty of space for their cavalry units.

25|$|Rob Bub, {{the chief}} detective at Van Nuys, began letting his senior officers, {{all the way}} up to Chief William Bratton, know of the case along with senior {{prosecutors}} from the Los Angeles County District Attorney's office. It was transferred to RHD, which handled many of the department's high-profile cases, including the art theft bureau where Lazarus herself worked. Her arrest was planned carefully. On the day of the arrest dozens of officers arose before dawn. After being briefed on a search warrant they were told would be executed outside the city, but with few details beyond <b>that,</b> <b>they</b> <b>went</b> to wait near Lazarus' home in Simi Valley and that city's Metrolink station, where Lazarus commuted to the city.|$|E
25|$|In Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit film trilogies, {{three of}} the Istari are {{featured}} as characters: Saruman (portrayed by Christopher Lee), Gandalf (played by Ian McKellen), and Radagast (portrayed by Sylvester McCoy). Gandalf mentions the two Blue Wizards in , but comments that he cannot recall their names; this is {{a reference to the}} fact <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>went</b> unnamed in both The Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings. In The Hobbit films, it is Radagast who first discovers the presence of the Necromancer at Dol Guldur, and alerts Gandalf who in turn informs the White Council, including Saruman. Gandalf is quick to deduce the Necromancer's true identity, but Saruman is reluctant to accept that Sauron could have returned. At the behest of Galadriel, Gandalf and Radagast meet at the tomb of the Nine Kings of Men, and then travel to Dol Guldur. Radagast is then sent to take word to the White Council while Gandalf enters Dol Guldur alone, where he confronts and is captured by Sauron. The White Council arrived in force to rescue him, with Saruman, Elrond, and Galadriel confronting the evil there while Radagast took Gandalf to safety. Saruman later forbade pursuit of Sauron, feeling that their foe {{would never be able to}} rise again, while Gandalf and Radagast later took part in The Battle of the Five Armies.|$|E

25|$|After {{two weeks}} of preparation, the tour went awry for the Australians. They fell to a 170-run loss in the First Test in Cape Town, with Lawry giving finger {{gestures}} to the crowd and continuously arguing with the umpires. The Australian skipper managed only 2 in the first innings as the hosts took a 218-run lead that set up the match. Lawry scored 83 in the second innings, {{which was to be}} the highest Australian score for the series, an indication of his team's lack of batting form. At the end of match, angered by officiating that he considered to be unacceptable, Lawry refused to accept a presentation by the two umpires. The series moved on to Kingsmead at Durban. Host captain Ali Bacher outwitted Lawry by persuading the Australian skipper to toss long before the start of play. Bacher won the toss and decided—against conventional wisdom—to bat first on a green pitch that would normally offer assistance to the bowlers. Immediately after, ground staff ran onto the field and cut off all the grass, making it ideal for batting, thereby giving the South Africans the advantage. Knowing the rules in greater detail, Bacher had tricked Lawry. The laws of cricket allowed for the wicket to be mown up to half an hour before the start of play, so Bacher had talked Lawry in tossing early so that he could change the pitch condition to advantage his team. South Africa amassed 9/622 declared and Australia fell to its first innings defeat in four years, folding for 157 and 336. Lawry could not see off the hosts' opening bowlers, falling for 15 and 14, as South Africa took a 2–0 lead. The last two Tests brought no respite, as South Africa registered two large victories by 307 and 323 runs respectively. Lawry only managed 79 runs in the last two Tests, and passed 20 only once. Bacher's side, which was {{regarded as one of the}} finest in Test history, had inflicted what remains the heaviest Test series defeat in Australian cricket history. Lawry's men did not win any of the three matches against provincial sides after the start of the Tests, meaning <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>went</b> eight matches without victory.|$|E

Originally, the writers for the episode {{contacted}} Garry Shandling {{to play the}} part of Fletcher.
