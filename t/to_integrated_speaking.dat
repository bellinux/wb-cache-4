In this paper we argue that spoken dialogue technology have the poten-tial to greatly enrichen the user’s experience in future computer games. We also present some requirements {{that have to be}} fulfilled <b>to</b> successfully <b>integrate</b> <b>spoken</b> dialogue technology with a computer game application. Finally, we briefly describe an implemented system that has provided computer game char-acters with some conversational abilities that kids have interacted with in studies. ...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} how well 5 -, 6 -, 10 -year-olds and adults <b>integrated</b> information from <b>spoken</b> discourse with cohesive {{use of space}} in gesture, in comprehension. In Experiment 1, participants were presented {{with a combination of}} spoken discourse and a sequence of cohesive gestures, which consistently located each of the two protagonists in two distinct locations in gesture space. Participants were asked to select an interpretation of the final sentence that best matched the preceding spoken and gestural contexts. Adults and 10 -year-olds performed better than 5 -year-olds, who were at chance level. In Experiment 2, another group of 5 -year-olds was presented with the same stimuli as in Experiment 1, except that the actor showed hand-held pictures, instead of producing cohesive gestures. Unlike cohesive gestures, one set of pictures was self-explanatory and did not require integration with the concurrent speech to derive the referent. With these pictures, 5 -year-olds performed nearly perfectly and their performance in the identifiable pictures was significantly better than those in the unidentifiable pictures. These results suggest that young children failed <b>to</b> <b>integrate</b> <b>spoken</b> discourse and cohesive use of space in gestures, because they cannot derive a referent of cohesive gestures from the local speech context...|$|R

Additionally, the integrated tasks were more alike with respect to reported strategy use than were the independent and integrated tasks. Overall, we found no relationship between the total number of reported strategic behaviors and total test scores, regardless of task type. Our finding that the more skills involved in a task, the greater the reported strategy use supports the inclusion of integrated tasks in oral proficiency tests.

40|$|A major {{challenge}} for the realization of intelligent robots is to supply them with cognitive abilities {{in order to allow}} ordinary users to program them easily and intuitively. One way of such programming is teaching work tasks by interactive demonstration. To make this effective and convenient for the user, the machine must be capable to establish a common focus of attention and be able <b>to</b> use and <b>integrate</b> <b>spoken</b> instructions, visual perceptions, and non-verbal clues like gestural commands. We report progress in building a hybrid architecture that combines statistical methods, neural networks, and finite state machines into an integrated system for instructing grasping tasks by man-machine interaction. The system combines the GRAVIS-robot for visual attention and gestural instruction with an intelligent interface for speech recognition and linguistic interpretation, and an modality fusion module to allow multi-modal task-oriented man-machine communication with respect to dextrous robot manipulation of objects. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{recent advances}} {{we have made}} towards the goal of empowering end users to automatically expand the knowledge base of a dialogue system through spoken interaction, in order to personalize it to their individual needs. We describe techniques used to incrementally reconfigure a preloaded trained natural language grammar, {{as well as the}} lexicon and language models for the speech recognition system. We also report on advances in the technology <b>to</b> <b>integrate</b> a <b>spoken</b> pronunciation with a spoken spelling, in order to improve spelling accuracy. While the original algorithm was designed for a “speak and spell ” input mode, we have shown here that the same methods can be applied to separately uttered spoken and spelled forms of the word. By concatenating the two waveforms, we {{can take advantage of the}} mutual constraints realized in an integrated composite FST. Using an OGI corpus of separately spoken and spelled names, we have demonstrated letter error rates of under 6 % for in-vocabulary words and under 11 % for words not contained in the training lexicon, a 44 % reduction in error rate over that achieved without use of the spoken form. We anticipate applying this technique to unknown words embedded in a larger context, followed by solicited spellings. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{amount of}} {{multimedia}} content increases at a tremendous speed every day [...] enabled by ever simpler production and processing techniques. Content based Multimedia Information Retrieval should help the user find information in these growing collections. However, the retrieval performance often prohibits real life application. The {{reason is the}} mismatch between the user's information need and the available low-level features. A lot of research aims to detect more meaningful representations of the multimedia objects, such as the occurrences of concepts or spoken words. However, the detection results are still far from being perfect. On the other hand, for most detectors {{it is possible to}} obtain a probability distribution over the possible representations of the object. This paper proposes the Expected Probability of Relevance Ranking Framework. A relationship between the objects representation and relevance is established by the probability of relevance given the representation, abstracting from the uncertain knowledge of this representation. The objects are then ranked by these probabilities weighted by the probability that the object has this representation, the expected probability of relevance. After introducing the framework we present previous work which estimates the probability of relevance given the binary occurrences of concepts as a reperesentation without prior relevance information. Then, following extensions are proposed: (1) a way <b>to</b> <b>integrate</b> the <b>spoken</b> content in the representation, (2) ways to improve the knowledge over the representation of individual shots and (3) a way to simulate detectors of a given performance to see what detector quality is needed...|$|R

It centres in particular on ways of delivering the curriculum to classes containing immigrant and local children, a growing issue in Hong Kong where the number of non-Chinese speaking school-age children has doubled since the year 2000. The Hong Kong Equal Opportunities Commission has ex-pressed concern about the impact on the indigenous local students of steps taken <b>to</b> <b>integrate</b> their non-Chinese <b>speaking</b> immigrant peers into Hong Kong’s schools. This paper considers a number of intervention strategies, including streaming by ability, grouping students according to their mother tongue, providing differentiated instructional materials and learning objectives and deploying resources specifically designed for linguistically disadvantaged students. Shortcomings in provision are discussed as well as problems faced by children who speak a “foreign” language in school and go home to envi-ronments in which only their mother tongue is spoken. Comment is directed at opportunities for non-Chinese speaking students to learn their mother tongue in school and at steps taken by schools to engi-neer multicultural environments. published_or_final_versio...|$|R
40|$|Theory and Practice, {{sets out}} {{to bridge the gap}} the authors believe exists in {{theoretical}} work on how technology can function within the context of second language instruction, and how instructors can use technology to enliven and engage their students. They believe one of the primary reasons the gap exists is because instructors may feel intimidated by changes in technology, or more accurately, that instructors are unable {{to keep up with the}} changes in technology as quickly as their students can, and thus are not comfortable integrating as wide a range of technologies into their lessons (e. g., YouTube videos or audio recording and editing programs). To this end, the book functions more as a how-to guide for instructors who are not accustomed to using technology in their classrooms than it does as a reference guide for research about Computer Assisted Language Learning (CALL). The majority of the book’s twelve chapters are structured the same, with each addressing a different topic of language learning.

The study was conducted at grade eleven in SMA Negeri 1 Kalasan. The subjects of this study were the English language teacher and 117 students. This study was essentially qualitative with complementary quantitative data. The qualitative data were collected from the classroom observation and interview. In the classroom observation used to get the data about the implementation of integrated-skills teaching in the classroom. The interviews were about teachers’ understanding, opinion, actions, and obstacles in applying integrated-skills teaching. The data were analyzed using Miles & Huberman’s model that consists of data reduction, data display, and verification. The data were reduced based on the implementation of integrating language skills. They were displayed in the form of questions and answers. Finally, the data were verified with teachers’ documents that had already been collected. The quantitative data were taken from the questionnaire. The data were analyzed by using non-parametric statistics used to measure the mean score of students’ responses in the questionnaire. The study shows some results as follows. 1) The teacher understands integrated-skills teaching as the combination of two or more skills in teaching. 2) The teacher applies various ways of integrated-skills teaching, she was integrating reading with vocabulary, integrating reading with writing, <b>integrating</b> reading with <b>speaking,</b> <b>integrating</b> <b>speaking</b> with reading, <b>integrating</b> <b>speaking</b> with writing, <b>integrating</b> writing with vocabulary, integrating listening with vocabulary, integrating listening with grammar, integrating listening with writing, <b>integrating</b> listening with <b>speaking,</b> and <b>integrating</b> listening with reading. 3) The obstacles of integrated-skills teaching and learning are (a) the student’s low interest and motivation in learning English, (b) they are not responsible to do their homework, and (c) the teacher has not used various teaching techniques. The teacher overcomes the obstacles by giving motivation and adding knowledge about implementation of integrated-skills teaching.

40|$|The {{number of}} studies on {{comprehension}} of gestures and speech has increased recently. However, it is not understood at what age children can integrate information from speech and gesture at the discourse level. Thus, this study examined how well 5 -, 6 -, 10 -year-olds and adults <b>integrated</b> information from <b>spoken</b> discourse and the cohesive use of space in gesture, in comprehension. In Experiment 1, participants were presented {{with a combination of}} spoken discourse and a sequence of gestures, and selected an interpretation of the final sentence that best matched the preceding spoken and gestural contexts. The final sentence was ambiguous, but it was disambiguated by the cohesive use of space in gesture. We found that adult listeners could successfully <b>integrate</b> <b>spoken</b> and gestural contexts to derive the correct interpretation, but it was difficult for 5 -year-olds to do so. This suggests that children aged six and over can use the location information assigned by gesture to disambiguate a semantically underspecified sentence, and <b>integrate</b> information from <b>spoken</b> discourse and cohesive gestures. In Experiment 2, only 5 -year-olds participated. They were presented with a combination of spoken discourse and a sequence of paper dolls, instead of gestures, {{in the same manner as}} Experiment 1. The result showed that 5 -year-olds could successfully <b>integrate</b> the <b>spoken</b> and paper doll contexts. This indicates that 5 -year-olds can associate the referent with the location indicated by the concrete visual image, and integrate information from the visual image and that from speech to disambiguate a semantically underspecified sentence. However, they could not do so when the visual stimulus provided an extremely schematic representation, namely a gesture indicating a location in gesture space. From these results, we concluded that speech-gesture integration gradually develops in early childhoo...|$|R
