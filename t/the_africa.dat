5|$|Already in the 1880s, Muller had {{dabbled in}} {{ethnography}} and writing. On {{the basis of}} materials gathered on his journey to East Africa and South Africa in 1882/’83, he had held public lectures throughout the Netherlands and Belgium. He also published articles on his trip in Dutch magazines and newspapers, and collated these publications into a book titled Zuid-Afrika. It made him somewhat of a celebrity, {{and an expert on}} South Africa and East Africa. During his journey Muller had also collected a large number of ethnographic objects and artefacts, on which he published a richly illustrated study in 1892, together with Joh. F.

5|$|Bridgewater {{remained}} on the China Station until 1935, when she joined <b>the</b> <b>Africa</b> Station (later known as the South Atlantic Station). The ship returned to Devonport Dockyard on 1 September 1936 for a month's refit {{and then returned to}} Simonstown. Bridgewater had her second high-angle four-inch gun installed during a refit there. It was interrupted by the Munich Crisis of September 1938 when she was ordered to Freetown, Sierra Leone. The ship later resumed her refit and remained in South Africa until she returned to Devonport for another refit on 13 April 1939. It was completed on 17 May when Bridgewater began a leisurely cruise back to South Africa and arrived there in August.|$|E
5|$|Charles Ssekyaaya participated on Uganda's behalf in the men's 62 {{kilogram}} weightlifting discipline. He was 18 {{years old}} and had not participated in any previous Olympic Games. Ssekyaaya qualified for the Games after receiving a wildcard from the International Weightlifting Federation after achieving a 28th-place finish in <b>the</b> <b>Africa</b> Olympic Qualifiers. His event took place on 31 July, and included 14 athletes in total. During the event's snatch phase, Ssekyaaya was given three attempts. He successfully attempted to lift over 90 kilograms of weight in his first two attempts, but did not achieve this objective on the third attempt. Ssekyaaya then attempted 130 kilograms during the clean and jerk phrase of the event, successfully lifting it on his first attempt. He did not succeed in lifting 135 kilograms on his second attempt, or 140 on his third. Overall, the combination of Ssekyaaya's highest scores in snatch (105) and clean and jerk (130) yielded a score of 235 points. He ranked 13th in the event, ahead of Stevick Patris from Palau (234 points) and behind Tuau Lapua Lapua of Tuvalu (243 points). Ssekyaaya was 92 points behind the gold medallist Kim Un-guk from North Korea.|$|E
5|$|Drogba {{continued}} scoring goals but {{suffered an}} injury at the training ground {{and decided to}} have an operation on his knee. He was unable to play for four weeks and missed key games against Valencia, Arsenal and Liverpool. Drogba returned from injury to play in an FA Cup third round match against Queens Park Rangers and wore the captain's armband for the last 30 minutes {{he was on the}} pitch, but that was his last performance for Chelsea before international duty at <b>the</b> <b>Africa</b> Cup of Nations. Upon his return, Drogba scored a goal in the 2008 League Cup Final, making him the all-time leading scorer in League Cup Finals with four goals, but could not help prevent Chelsea fall to a 2–1 defeat at the hands of Tottenham Hotspur. Drogba also became the first player to score in three League Cup finals and the first to score in three consecutive English domestic cup finals. He scored both goals in a key 2–1 victory against Arsenal on 23 March 2008, bringing Chelsea equal on points with leaders Manchester United.|$|E

5|$|HMS Bridgewater (L01) was {{the lead}} ship of her class of sloops built for the Royal Navy in the 1920s.

Positions were filled by three teams from the Americas, one from Asia, one from Africa, three from Europe and two from Oceania. Another two places were allocated for repechage. The first repechage place was determined by a match between the runners-up from <b>the</b> <b>Africa</b> and Europe qualifying tournaments, with that winner then playing the Americas runner-up to determine the place.

5|$|More {{sympathetic}} authors {{point out}} complex situations that Rommel had to face. Brian Hanley, from USNI's Editorial Board of Directors, comments that Rommel was beaten {{the moment he}} arrived in Africa, considering the Allied troops outnumbered the Afrika Korps and they worked under a much more straightforward chain of command, while orders sent from Berlin to North Africa were rarely kept confidential. Hanley sees Rommel turning German and Italian military authorities against each other as turning liabilities into advantages and that he repeatedly created operational miracles that made a strategic investment in <b>the</b> <b>Africa</b> theatre attractive in 1942. Also, according to Hanley, if Rommel stood still, his enemy's strength would accumulate while his own, depending on an uncertain supply line, would diminish, thus he needed the British stocks of supply {{to deal with his}} logistical problems.|$|E

5|$|More than 1,000 {{shots of}} Wolverine have visual effects in them, which {{required}} three effects supervisors and seventeen different companies {{to work on}} the film. The most prominent was Hydraulx, who had also worked in the X-Men trilogy and was responsible for the battle in Three Mile Island and Gambit's powers. Many elements were totally generated through computer-generated imagery, such as the adamantium injection machine, the scene with Gambit's plane and Wolverine tearing through a door with his newly enhanced claws. CG bone claws were also created for some scenes because the props did not look good in close-ups. Extensive usage of matte paintings was also made, with Matte World Digital creating five different mattes for the final scene of the film—a pullback depicting the destroyed Three Mile Island—and Gavin Hood handing company Hatch Productions pictures of favelas as reference for <b>the</b> <b>Africa</b> scenes.|$|E
5|$|On {{behalf of}} Somersett, it was argued that while colonial laws might permit slavery, neither {{the common law}} of England, nor any law made by Parliament {{recognised}} the existence of slavery, and slavery was therefore illegal. Moreover, English contract law did not allow for any person to enslave himself, nor could any contract be binding without the person's consent. The arguments thus focused on legal details rather than humanitarian principles. A law passed in 1765 said that all lands, forts and slaves owned by <b>the</b> <b>Africa</b> Company were a property of the Crown, which could be interpreted to mean that the Crown accepted slavery. When the two lawyers for Charles Stewart put their case, they argued that a contract {{for the sale of}} a slave was recognised in England, and therefore the existence of slaves must be legally valid.|$|E
5|$|Around 38 AD, Vespasian married Domitilla the Elder, the {{daughter}} of an equestrian from Ferentium. They had two sons, Titus Flavius Vespasianus (born in 39) and Titus Flavius Domitianus (born in 51), and a daughter, Domitilla (born in 45). Domitilla the Elder died before Vespasian became emperor. Thereafter his mistress Caenis was his wife in all but name until she died in 74. The political career of Vespasian included the offices of quaestor, aedile and praetor, and culminated with a consulship in 51, the year Domitian was born. As a military commander, he gained early renown by participating in the Roman invasion of Britain in 43. Nevertheless, ancient sources allege poverty for the Flavian family at the time of Domitian's upbringing, even claiming Vespasian had fallen into disrepute under the emperors Caligula (3741) and Nero (5468). Modern history has refuted these claims, suggesting these stories were later circulated under Flavian rule as part of a propaganda campaign to diminish success under the less reputable Emperors of the Julio-Claudian dynasty, and maximize achievements under Emperor Claudius (4154) and his son Britannicus. By all appearances, imperial favour for the Flavians was high throughout the 40s and 60s. While Titus received a court education in the company of Britannicus, Vespasian pursued a successful political and military career. Following a prolonged period of retirement during the 50s, he returned to public office under Nero, serving as proconsul of <b>the</b> <b>Africa</b> province in 63, and accompanying the emperor during an official tour of Greece in 66.|$|E
