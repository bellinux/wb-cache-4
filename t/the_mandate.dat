According to UN mission head Johan Verbeke, about 60,000 ethnic Georgians in Abkhazia became vulnerable after the mission's end.|$|E
5|$|The British were {{formally}} awarded <b>the</b> <b>mandate</b> {{to govern}} the region in 1922. The non-Jewish Palestinians revolted in 1920, 1929, and 1936. In 1947, following World War II and The Holocaust, the British Government announced its desire to terminate <b>the</b> <b>Mandate,</b> and the United Nations General Assembly adopted in November 1947 a Resolution 181(II) recommending partition into an Arab state, a Jewish state and the Special International Regime for the City of Jerusalem. The Jewish leadership accepted the proposal, but the Arab Higher Committee rejected it; a civil war began immediately after the Resolution's adoption. The State of Israel was declared in May 1948.|$|E

5|$|The {{employer}} mandate requires employers meeting certain {{criteria to}} provide health insurance to their workers. <b>The</b> <b>mandate</b> applies to employers with more than 50 employees that do not offer health insurance to their full-time workers. Critics claimed that <b>the</b> <b>mandate</b> created a perverse incentive for business to keep their full-time headcount below 50 and to hire part-time workers instead. Between March 2010 and 2014 the number of part-time jobs declined by 230,000, {{while the number of}} full-time jobs increased by 2 million. In the public sector full-time jobs turned into part-time jobs much more than in the private sector. A 2016 study found only limited evidence that ACA had increased part-time employment.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>mandate</b> was {{dissolved}} in 1946 {{because of a}} British ultimatum to France, and Syria became an independent country on 17 April 1946. The same elite that had governed Syria during <b>the</b> <b>mandate</b> continued in power and they governed in the same manner. The failure in the 1948 Arabâ€“Israeli War led to {{the downfall of the}} traditional elite {{and the rise of the}} military in politics. Husni al-Za'im became the first military dictator of Syria in 1949, but in 1950, military officer Adib Shishakli gained power behind the scenes, and by 1953 had established another military dictatorship. The military's introduction to the Syrian political scene destroyed the oligarchy enabling the middle class to participate in Syrian politics. However, while their powers were weakened, the traditional elite retained the majority of the wealth produced.|$|E
5|$|The {{purpose of}} <b>the</b> <b>mandate</b> was {{to prevent the}} {{healthcare}} system from succumbing to adverse selection, which would result in high premiums for the insured and little coverage (and thus more illness and medical bankruptcy) for the uninsured.

5|$|Upon {{his return}} to Palestine in 1918, al-Hajj Muhammad {{supervised}} his family's land possessions and entered the trade business.

The 1920 Nebi Musa riots, unrest in 1923 and the 1929 Palestine riots all extended into Tulkarm and al-Hajj Muhammad was angered at the coercive manner in which the British authorities quelled the Palestinian Arab participants. His business eventually went bankrupt after <b>the</b> <b>Mandate</b> adopted new economic policies that saw the import of cheaper, foreign wheat at the expense of local produce. His disaffection of British economic policies partly motivated his future participation in the Palestinian Arab revolt in 1936.|$|E
5|$|After the {{adoption}} of the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine in November 1947, a civil war erupted in the British Mandate of Palestine. The Jews living in Jerusalem constituted one of the weak points of the Yishuv and a main cause for concern to its leaders.

5|$|Despite his pessimism {{expressed}} to the Dutch government and <b>the</b> <b>mandate</b> {{he had been}} given to surrender the Army, General Winkelman awaited the outcome of events, avoiding actually capitulating until it was absolutely necessary.
