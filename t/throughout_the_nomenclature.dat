40|$|Obesity is a {{major health}} issue <b>throughout</b> <b>the</b> world. Modern <b>nomenclature</b> has {{replaced}} <b>the</b> word obesity with bariatric-related terminology. A bariatric person is defined as one who has health limitations due to their physical size, lack of mobility and environmental access. Obese people are often characterised by society as being lazy and unattractive, and this perception is prevalent among healthcare professionals also. This paper describes an innovative approach to obesity management in a large Australian health district in Queensland...|$|R

5000|$|<b>Throughout</b> <b>the</b> 19th century <b>nomenclatures</b> and classifications {{of cloud}} types were developed, {{followed}} {{late in the}} century by cloud atlases. <b>The</b> first <b>nomenclature</b> ("naming", also [...] "numbering") of clouds in English, by Luke Howard, was published in 1802. [...] It followed a similar effort in French by Jean-Baptiste Lamarck in 1801. Howard's nomenclature defined four fundamental types of clouds: cirrus or thread-cloud, cumulus or heap-cloud, stratus or flat cloud (level sheet), and nimbus or rain-cloud (see Classification of clouds). There followed {{a long period of}} development of the field of meteorology and the classification of clouds, leading up to 1896, the International Year of Clouds. The history of this period {{is the subject of a}} popular book, The Invention of Clouds. [...] During that time, the Englishmen Rev. Clement Ley and Hon. Ralph Abercromby, were influential. Both men died before the classification was settled, however. Ley wrote a book, Cloudland, that is well known to meteorologists. Abercromby contributed a number of papers on the subject, stressing the most important (and then novel) fact that clouds are the same everywhere in the world. He also wrote in collaboration with Hugo Hildebrand Hildebrandsson a detailed classification of clouds. This was adopted in Hildebrandsson's 1890 Cloud Atlas.|$|R

Application of <b>the</b> <b>nomenclature</b> recommendations is illustrated using examples covering a wide range of structure types of macromolecular rotaxanes and pseudorotaxanes.
