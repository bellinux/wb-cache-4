40|$|Matrix {{converters}} (MCs) {{are essentially}} forced commutated cycloconverters with inherent four quadrant operation {{consisting of a}} matrix of bidirectional switches such {{that there is a}} switch for each possible connection between the input and output lines. Matrix converter directly converts the AC input voltage at any given frequency to AC output voltage with arbitrary amplitude at any unrestricted frequency without the need for a dc link capacitor storage element at the input side. The introduction of bidirectional switches using power transistors and IGBTs made easy realization of the matrix converter. The real development of the matrix converter starts with the work of Venturini and Alesina who proposed a mathematical analysis and introduced the Low-Frequency Modulation Matrix concept to describe the low frequency behavior of the matrix converter [1 - 3]. In this, the output voltages are obtained by multiplication of the modulation matrix or transfer matrix with the input voltages. One of the essential requirements for switching <b>three</b> <b>phase</b> AC to <b>three</b> <b>phase</b> AC MC is that two or more bidirectional switches connected to any one output phase should NOT be closed simultaneously, as this will cause dangerously high short circuit current. Similarly any one bidirectional switch connected to each output phase should remain closed to provide a current path with inductive load. This thesis mainly provides an account of the <b>three</b> <b>phase</b> AC to <b>three</b> <b>phase</b> AC MC modelling concept with SIMULINK software using fundamental Venturini and Optimum Venturini modulation algorithm [1 - 8], advanced modulation algorithm such as that proposed by Sunter-Clare [11 - 12] and by Ned Mohan [13 - 14, 16 - 17], application of these algorithms for the Vector control of <b>three</b> <b>phase</b> Induction Motor (IM) drive [15], real time hardware in the loop simulation [51, 54 - 55] for a <b>three</b> <b>phase</b> AC to single <b>phase</b> AC MC, <b>three</b> <b>phase</b> AC to <b>three</b> <b>phase</b> AC Multilevel MC (MMC) with three [18 - 19] and six flying capacitors per output phase using PSCAD software (as SIMULINK started shooting trouble), Indirect (ISVM) [25 - 30] and Direct (DASVM, DSSVM, CZASVM) [31 - 38] Space Vector Modulation, newly discovered dual programmable AC to DC rectifier concept using <b>three</b> <b>phase</b> AC to <b>three</b> <b>phase</b> AC MC [43 - 45], Delta-Sigma Modulated MC [46 - 49] and single <b>phase</b> AC to <b>three</b> <b>phase</b> AC MC [50].
