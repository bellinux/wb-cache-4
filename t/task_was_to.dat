5|$|As the Allied {{offensive}} gained steam, Whitehead's main <b>task</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> shift his aircraft forward, {{advancing the}} bomb line incrementally towards Japan. When the P-38 Lightning {{arrived in the}} theater in late 1942, Whitehead at last received a fighter that could match the Japanese A6M Zero. To speed up the Allied advance, the Fifth Air Force developed a number of technical and tactical innovations that extended the range of its aircraft, thus increasing the distance of each Allied advance, which was dependent on the range of Whitehead's aircraft.|$|E

40|$|Usually, task {{coordination}} systems distinguish {{several aspects}} [11] of task execution: the functional aspect is concerned by what <b>tasks</b> <b>are</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{performed by the}} system. The behavioral aspect concerns when particular <b>tasks</b> <b>are</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> executed. The technological aspect concerns how <b>tasks</b> <b>are</b> actually performed. Coordination systems generally do not provide any tools to support the technological aspect; instead, they are open systems which can (or have the ambition to) interoperate with various other systems and platforms which implement the actual actions. Abstracting the "how" part of activities from the "what" and "when" make coordination particularly amenable to the declarative kind of specifications offered by rule-based frameworks...|$|R
