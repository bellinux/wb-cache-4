Jenner admits {{he is the only}} researcher <b>that</b> <b>stayed</b> behind, many of the others having left for their families or committed suicide. A drunk Shane approaches Lori Grimes (Sarah Wayne Callies) about her callous attitude towards him with Rick's return and attempts to rape her, but backs off when she scratches his neck.|$|E
5|$|The {{final day}} started poorly for England, with Compton being caught off Johnston {{from the second}} ball of the day. Yardley and Dollery took the score to 133 before Toshack took two wickets in the same over. Eight runs later, Dollery was bowled from a Lindwall bouncer <b>that</b> <b>stayed</b> low. Lindwall bowled Laker for a duck later in the same over to leave England at 141/8. England were bowled out for 186, ceding a 409-run victory.

5|$|The royalist armies <b>that</b> <b>stayed</b> in the Peruvian {{countryside}} {{headed to}} Lima, led by Canterac. In a confusing episode, {{there was no}} battle, as neither one attacked. Canterac changed his path to El Callao, took resources from it, {{and returned to his}} base. There was no battle during their return either. Without resources, El Callao surrendered in a few days. Both armies took inadvisable actions: San Martín allowed Canterac to receive reinforcements, and Canterac left a key military objective incapable to resist. There is no known documentation that provides a reasonable explanation of those events.|$|E

25|$|The term {{substrate}} {{with reference}} to Proto-Germanic refers to lexical items and phonological elements that {{do not appear to}} be descended from Proto-Indo-European.

The theory of a non-Indo-European substrate was first proposed by Sigmund Feist, who estimated that about a third of all Proto-Germanic lexical items came from the substrate.|$|E
