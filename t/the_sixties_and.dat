25|$|The {{purse for}} the first running in 1867 was $1,500 added, meaning the purse was {{supplemented}} by nomination and entry fees. This made the total purse $2,500, with the winner receiving $1,850. The purse increased sharply in the Roaring Twenties, from Man O'War's earnings of $7,950 in 1920 to Gallant Fox's take of $66,040 in 1930. Purses declined {{as a result of}} the Great Depression, with War Admiral earning only $28,020 in 1937, then began to recover. Throughout <b>the</b> <b>sixties</b> <b>and</b> early seventies, the value to the winner was roughly $100,000, depending on the added money generated by entry fees (larger fields thus leading to higher prize money). The purse was repeatedly raised in the eighties and nineties, reaching $500,000 added, with the winner receiving roughly $400,000. In 1998, the purse was changed to $1,000,000 guaranteed, with the winner receiving $600,000. In 2014, the purse was raised to $1,500,000.|$|E
25|$|Before the Hatlestad Slide, Norway {{maintained}} a liberal policy {{when it came}} to housing construction on hills. The area of the afflicted housing units were therefore not surveyed for landslide risk before construction was commenced in <b>the</b> <b>sixties,</b> <b>and</b> the risk of landslides did not become known until later. After construction was finished, there were several incidents of rocks dislodging from the cliff and hitting the road. The rocks did not cause material damage or personal injury, and the municipality took no action besides setting up a warning sign by the road. Despite repeated complaints from Hatlestad's residents about this problem and the general risk of landslides, the municipality did not secure the area, stating that securing land against landslides {{is the responsibility of the}} property owner. However, an order given to the property owners to secure the hill were never responded to, and the case was never resolved.|$|E

25|$|Canadian painter Jean-Paul Riopelle (1923–2002), {{a member}} of the Montreal-based surrealist-inspired group Les Automatistes, helped {{introduce}} a related style of abstract impressionism to the Parisian art world from 1949. Michel Tapié's groundbreaking book, Un Art Autre (1952), was also enormously influential in this regard. Tapié was also a curator and exhibition organizer who promoted the works of Pollock and Hans Hofmann in Europe. By the 1960s, the movement's initial affect had been assimilated, yet its methods and proponents remained highly influential in art, affecting profoundly the work of many artists who followed. Abstract expressionism preceded Tachisme, Color Field painting, Lyrical Abstraction, Fluxus, Pop Art, Minimalism, Postminimalism, Neo-expressionism, and the other movements of <b>the</b> <b>sixties</b> <b>and</b> seventies and it influenced all those later movements that evolved. Movements which were direct responses to, and rebellions against abstract expressionism began with Hard-edge painting (Frank Stella, Robert Indiana and others) and Pop artists, notably Andy Warhol, Claes Oldenburg and Roy Lichtenstein who achieved prominence in the US, accompanied by Richard Hamilton in Britain. Robert Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns in the US formed a bridge between abstract expressionism and Pop art. Minimalism was exemplified by artists such as Donald Judd, Robert Mangold and Agnes Martin.|$|E

500|$|For Joel, [...] "the {{original}} music, as {{with other}} elements of the movie, had to echo the retro sounds of <b>the</b> <b>Sixties</b> <b>and</b> early Seventies". Music defines each character. For example, [...] "Tumbling Tumbleweeds" [...] by Bob Nolan was chosen for the Stranger at the time the Coens wrote the screenplay, as was [...] "Lujon" [...] by Henry Mancini for Jackie Treehorn. [...] "The German nihilists are accompanied by techno-pop and Jeff Bridges by Creedence. So there's a musical signature for each of them", remarked Ethan in an interview.|$|E

500|$|Weiner {{said that}} the episode is [...] "about the {{children}}. It's about {{who is going to}} take care of the children. Youth is a big part of our lives in general. Now and then. But when you think of <b>the</b> <b>sixties</b> <b>and</b> the youth culture and the way it sort of takes over. What you're looking at is Don's fear of the children being cut loose. At the same time, the children come back and eat you." [...] Weiner commented that the Michael Ginsberg character was [...] "of the next wave" [...] as a youthful employee who is [...] "unfamiliar with social rules", with Weiner also declaring that [...] "there is no reason that the concerns of older people are different than younger people".|$|E

[...] Also borrowing elements from downbeat and electronic music she discovered on recent trips to Europe, her vision of the album eventually resulted in a mixture that Knowles has described as a [...] "'60s/70s vintage soul record with hints of electronica." [...] In an interview with Billboard magazine, Geffen Records chairman Ron Fair said of the album prior to release, [...] "Her record is totally bananas ... It's not what people would expect from her. The music is more electric and international. She's in her own lane." ...|$|E
500|$|Many Native American men wore {{long hair}} {{before the arrival}} of western {{influences}} on their culture. (In Cherokee legends, for example, males said to be handsome were often described as having [...] "long hair almost to the ground" [...] or similar formulas.). Both men and women of these cultures have frequently struggled to maintain their tradition but have faced heavy opposition. Many consider it a sign of giving in to western influences to have their hair cut. Early American settlers saw long-haired, native men as rebelling against their civilized society. Mountain men and trappers who adopted the customs were also considered amoral, and often identified by their long hair. Since the cultural movements of <b>the</b> <b>Sixties</b> <b>and</b> Seventies, however, Native Americans have felt less pressure to have short hair, as different movements have defended their cultural rights. For example, several states have loosened prison regulations, allowing Native Americans to wear long hair during incarceration, along with other cultural allowances. There has been resistance to these changes, however, as long hair is sometimes used to hide drugs, as well as to identify with a gang.|$|E

500|$|PolyGram and Working Title Films, who had funded Fargo, backed The Big Lebowski with {{a budget}} of $15million. In casting the film, Joel remarked, [...] "we tend to write both for people we know and have worked with, and some parts without knowing who's {{going to play the}} role. In The Big Lebowski we did write for John [...] and Steve , but we didn't know who was getting the Jeff Bridges role." [...] In {{preparation}} for his role, Bridges met Dowd but actually [...] "drew on myself a lot from back in <b>the</b> <b>Sixties</b> <b>and</b> Seventies. I lived in a little place like that and did drugs, although I think I was a little more creative than the Dude." [...] The actor went into his own closet with the film's wardrobe person and picked out clothes that he had thought the Dude might wear. He wore his character's clothes home because most of them were his own. The actor also adopted the same physicality as Dowd, including the slouching and his ample belly. Originally, Goodman wanted a different kind of beard for Walter but the Coen brothers insisted on the [...] "Gladiator" [...] or what they called the [...] "Chin Strap" [...] and he thought it would go well with his flattop haircut.|$|E
