In the following scene, Lo is seen at a tea party with four other women and <b>the</b> <b>waitresses,</b> where they drink champagne amongst an array of cakes and cupcakes. As the video flashes white, it shows {{a glimpse of the}} other women's fantasies. Then, Lo becomes drunk, takes her shirt off, smears cake on her face, pours champagne on herself and starts to dance with her guests and <b>the</b> <b>waitresses.</b> In the following scene, she makes out with the man she was drinking with. The visual ends with the singer being at home while vomiting into a sink. Scenes interspersed through the main plot portray Lo in a dark room, with mascara dripping from her eyes while doing activities such as blowing bubble gum, eating melting ice cream, and smoking a cigarette.|$|E
25|$|Though Paules {{highlights}} the positive consequences of emotional labor {{for a specific}} population of waitresses, other scholars have also found negative consequences of emotional labor within the waitressing industry. Through eighteen months of participant observation research, Bayard De Volo (2003) found that casino waitresses are highly monitored and monetarily bribed to perform emotional labor in the workplace. Specifically, Bayard De Volo (2003) argues that through a sexualized environment and a generous tipping system, both casino owners and customers control waitresses' behavior and appearance for their own benefit and pleasure. Even though <b>the</b> <b>waitresses</b> have their own forms of individual and collective resistance mechanisms, intense and consistent monitoring of their actions by casino management {{makes it difficult to}} change the power dynamics of the casino workplace.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>waitresses</b> were a major {{attraction}} for the saloons and were nicknamed the pretty waiter girls, {{though they were}} not always attractive or young. They were scantily clothed in gaudy outfits while they sold drinks and danced with customers for money. The saloons hired women to exploit the men, instructed to pick customers' pockets and then give half that money back to the management. The pretty waiter girls earned about $20 per week plus a commission on any drinks and dances that they sold. Small grog houses and deadfalls hired only handful of pretty waiter girls, but the larger dance halls and concert saloons employed up to fifty women. However some of the concert saloons, like the Eureka and Bella Union, {{made an effort to}} have notable Barbary Coast performers appear in their shows and actually had attractive women for their pretty waiter girls.|$|E

25|$|Entertaining the miners, entrepreneurs, {{and sailors}} {{would be a}} huge {{business}} and resulted in varied, inventive, and occasionally bizarre forms of entertainment. Except for a couple of restaurants, that three block stretch of Pacific Street was almost wall to wall with drinking establishments. They included dance halls, concert saloons which had entertainment and dancing, melodeons, cheap groggeries, and deadfalls which were dismal beer and wine dens. Initially the melodeons had mechanical reed organs which played music, however they quickly transformed into a kind of cabaret which had theatrical entertainment but no dance floor. The only women allowed in the melodeons were <b>the</b> <b>waitresses</b> and performers. Their shows usually contained songs, bawdy skits, and often featured can-can dancers. The deadfalls were the lowest of the establishments and had hard benches, damp sawdust on the floors, the bar was rough boards laid atop of barrels, had no entertainment, and their wine was often raw alcohol with an added coloring.|$|E

500|$|... "A Benihana Christmas" [...] was {{directed}} by Harold Ramis and written by Jennifer Celotta. It was produced by Stephen Merchant, Ricky Gervais, Greg Daniels, Howard Klein, and Ben Silverman. The episode was shot in a real Benihana restaurant. According to the show's prop master, different actresses were used because Andy and Michael failed {{to pick up the}} original waitresses, and settled for [...] "less attractive ones". At Paley Fest 2007, Greg Daniels admitted that the joke failed due to poor casting. <b>The</b> <b>waitresses</b> that come to the office were supposed to be unattractive. Daniels stated that the actresses they hired for the role were [...] "too good-looking". During filming, John Krasinski threw a shrimp across the table at Rainn Wilson. It bounced off Dwight's glasses and landed in the glass of water he was about to drink. The producers chose not to use the footage because it looked so improbable as to be unbelievable.|$|E
500|$|Docter {{noted that}} the film {{reflects}} his friendships with Disney veterans Frank Thomas, Ollie Johnston, and Joe Grant (who all died before the film's release and thus the film was dedicated to them). Grant gave the script his approval {{as well as some}} advice before his death in 2005. Docter recalled that Grant would remind him that the audience needed an [...] "emotional bedrock" [...] because of how wacky the adventure would become; here it is Carl mourning for his wife. Docter felt that Grant's personality influenced Carl's deceased wife Ellie more than the grouchy main character, and Carl was primarily based on Spencer Tracy, Walter Matthau, James Whitmore, and their own grandparents, because there was [...] "something sweet about these grumpy old guys". Docter and Jonas Rivera noted Carl's charming nature in spite of his grumpiness derives from the elderly [...] "hav this charm and almost this 'old man license' to say things that other people couldn't get away with [...] It's like how we would go to eat with Joe Grant and he would call <b>the</b> <b>waitresses</b> 'honey'.

[...] Iyall used to find the comparison annoying, but eventually warmed to it: [...] "When people said I sounded like her, I'd [...] say, 'Oh yeah, thanks a lot.' But this year, I've {{fallen in love with}} [...] Learning To Crawl so now I don't care if [...] people want to make comparisons." [...] After a live show in 1982, [...] Niester contended that she was the weakest part of the group and had the [...] "vocal range of an automobile horn".

The pediatric oncology scenes were filmed at the Children's Hospital Los Angeles' Center for Cancer and Blood Diseases, where eleven real patients performed alongside Morrison and Lynch. Bailey, the pediatric ward nurse, was played by guest-star Charlene Amoia, {{who had worked for}} the series' sound department during the first season. In June 2011, she deemed her [...] "Comeback" [...] appearance her favorite guest role in any series, due to working alongside the children, whom she was [...] "so touched by".

2500|$|In her 1991 {{study of}} waitresses in Philadelphia, Paules {{examines}} how these workers assert control and protect their self identity during interactions with customers. In restaurant work, Paules argues, workers' subordination to customers is reinforced through [...] "cultural symbols that originate from deeply rooted assumptions about service work." [...] Because <b>the</b> <b>waitresses</b> were not strictly regulated by their employers, waitresses' interactions with customers were controlled by <b>the</b> <b>waitresses</b> themselves. Although they are stigmatized by the stereotypes and assumptions of servitude surrounding restaurant work, <b>the</b> <b>waitresses</b> studied were not negatively affected by {{their interactions with}} customers. To the contrary, they viewed their ability to manage their emotions as a valuable skill {{that could be used}} to gain control over customers. Thus, the Philadelphia waitresses took advantage of the lack of employer-regulated emotional labor in order to avoid the potentially negative consequences of emotional labor.|$|E
