In the ports, duty was collected on inland goods, before being exported, and on overseas goods {{meant for the}} local markets, which were stamped with the official seal before being allowed into the country. The volume of trade in the port cities was high enough to warrant a large workforce to monitor and assess the goods. The state issued licenses to liquor shops, which were required to fly the license flag outside their premises. Flags were used by foreign merchants too, to indicate the nature of goods they were selling. The state also kept records of the weights and counts of all the goods sold by merchants.

5000|$|His {{ideas of}} the 1930s went against the humanistic, {{literary}} approach to librarianship (the [...] "scholar librarian" [...] of old) {{as well as the}} technical, procedure-based approach of [...] "library economy" [...] (the common term for library science of the time). <b>The</b> <b>significant</b> <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> the GLS approach were that it employed quantitative, scientific research methods, and that it aimed to examine librarianship as a social system of communication. Librarianship, according to Butler's new definition, was the [...] "transmission of the accumulated experience of society through the instrumentality of the book." [...] Thus, the problems his new [...] "library science" [...] was intended to address were social problems of information exchange and communication in society, where library economy had been confined to addressing the practical problems of the administration of libraries. While not everyone welcomed Butler's new approach, most especially C. Seymour Thompson, it has had a permanent influence on the research agenda of the field, and the new term [...] "library science" [...] became the generally adopted name for the academic study of librarianship.|$|E
