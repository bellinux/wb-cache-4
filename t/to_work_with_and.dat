5|$|After an {{unsuccessful}} interview at Liverpool, Shankly moved to manage Grimsby Town in June 1951. He {{said in his}} autobiography that there was greater potential at Grimsby than at Carlisle. His main problems were that Grimsby had been relegated twice in recent seasons, dropping from the First to the Third Division, and some good players had been transferred before he arrived. But Shankly believed he still had good players <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> <b>and</b> {{was able to buy}} some additional players on the transfer market for low fees.|$|E
5|$|Asian {{elephants}} perform {{tasks such}} as hauling loads into remote areas, moving logs to rivers and roads, transporting tourists around national parks, pulling wagons, and leading religious processions. In northern Thailand, the animals are used to digest coffee beans for Black Ivory coffee. They are valued over mechanised tools because they can work in relatively deep water, require relatively little maintenance, need only vegetation and water as fuel and can be trained to memorise specific tasks. Elephants can be trained to respond to over 30 commands. Musth bulls can be difficult and dangerous <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> <b>and</b> are chained and semi-starved until the condition passes. In India, many working elephants are alleged to {{have been subject to}} abuse. They and other captive elephants are thus protected under The Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act of 1960.|$|E

5|$|At the time, {{the public}} {{strongly}} identified Leigh with {{her second husband}} Laurence Olivier, who was her spouse from 1940 to 1960. Leigh and Olivier starred together in many stage productions, with Olivier often directing, and in three films. She earned {{a reputation for being}} difficult <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>with,</b> <b>and</b> for much of her adult life she suffered from bipolar disorder as well as recurrent bouts of chronic tuberculosis, which was first diagnosed in the mid-1940s and ultimately claimed her life at the age of 53. Although her career had periods of inactivity, in 1999 the American Film Institute ranked Leigh as the 16th greatest female movie star of classic Hollywood cinema.|$|E
5|$|The State President of the South African Republic, Paul Kruger, {{was not an}} easy man <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>with,</b> <b>and</b> in {{some circles}} it was {{predicted}} that Reitz would quickly find himself subordinated to Kruger. This was not the case, however. On occasion the two men clashed on matters of policy, but Reitz remained true to his own convictions, gaining some influence over Kruger in the process. Originally praised by the British for his diplomatic courtesy, their attitude quickly changed when they understood that Reitz was a protagonist of Transvaal independence. Reitz was sometimes rather brazen in his political statements, so when he – incorrectly – claimed the South African Republic to be a fully sovereign state, the British jumped on him.|$|E
5|$|As {{parliament}} {{is usually}} in recess {{during the summer}} months, Fingleton's political journalism did not often interfere with his cricket radio commentary for the ABC or his cricket writing, except during tours of England in the Australian winter. Fingleton mainly freelanced for overseas newspapers as he regarded Australian editors as being difficult <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>with,</b> <b>and</b> because the pay was lower. In 1946–47, England toured Australia for the first full Test series since the war. Fingleton criticised Bradman for not walking after hitting a disputed catch to Jack Ikin. Fingleton and most in the press box thought that the catch was clean but the umpire ruled in favour of Bradman. At the time Bradman had been making a comeback from ill health and had been struggling, and {{it was thought that}} he would retire if he could not discover his old form. After the dispute catch however, Bradman began timing the ball and went on to score 187. Fingleton openly criticised the decision to give Bradman not out in his writing. Later in the series, he decried Bradman's tactics of having his pacemen bowl frequent bouncers at the English batsmen, pointing out that it was hypocritical for the Australian captain to vociferously condemn Jardine's tactics years earlier. As Fingleton {{was one of the few}} who were forthright enough to question the actions of national hero Bradman, many sources within the Australian cricket community chose to confide in him, most notably all-rounder Keith Miller, whose cavalier attitude brought him into conflict with Bradman's ruthless approach to victory. The following season, during the Indian team's tour of Australia, Fingleton began his association with The Hindu.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Imoen and Irenicus {{have been}} removed to an asylum called Spellhold, which is {{situated}} on an island. But Irenicus soon breaks his bonds and prepares to experiment on Imoen. Back in Athkatla, the party raises the money necessary and receives assistance from whichever organization it has decided <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>with,</b> <b>and</b> gains passage to the island on a ship sailed by Saemon Havarian. The heroes then manage to get inside Spellhold, but are there captured by Irenicus, who has taken control of the prison and had planned all along to bring the protagonist there. Irenicus subjects the protagonist to a ritual which takes the protagonist's soul. Imoen, who is revealed to also be a Child of Bhaal, has already been subjected to Irenicus's ritual, and her soul has gone to Irenicus's sister Bodhi. Bodhi then abandons the party to the maze beneath Spellhold so she may hunt them. When they face her, the now soulless protagonist loses self-control and transforms into a creature called the Slayer, one of the avatar forms of Bhaal, which scares off Bodhi. The hero returns to their normal self, and the party battles Irenicus, forcing him to retreat. The party follows, and reaches the surface via the Underdark.|$|E

Also, it requires one fewer processing step, so it is appealing to those favoring the purest form of product available. However, it is very sticky and, therefore, messier <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> <b>and</b> has a shorter shelf life, and some feel the results are just as good with DME.|$|E
