40|$|Aerodynamic and {{acoustic}} {{characteristics are}} presented for a cowl-mounted, model <b>cascade</b> <b>thrust</b> <b>reverser</b> suitable for short-haul aircraft. <b>Thrust</b> <b>reverser</b> efficiency {{and the influence}} on fan performance were determined from isolated fan-driven models under static and forward velocity conditions. <b>Cascade</b> <b>reverser</b> noise characteristics were determined statically in an isolated pipe-flow test, while aerodynamic installation effects were determined with a wind-tunnel, fan-powered airplane model. Application of test results to short-haul aircraft calculations demonstrate that such a <b>cascade</b> <b>thrust</b> <b>reverser</b> {{may be able to}} meet both the performance and noise requirements for short-haul aircraft operation. However, aircraft installation effects can be quite significant...|$|R
40|$|The NASA Langley Configuration Aerodynamics Branch has {{conducted}} an experimental investigation {{to study the}} static performance of innovative <b>thrust</b> <b>reverser</b> concepts applicable to high-bypass-ratio turbofan engines. Testing was conducted on a conventional separate-flow exhaust system configuration, a conventional <b>cascade</b> <b>thrust</b> <b>reverser</b> configuration, and six innovative <b>thrust</b> <b>reverser</b> configurations. The innovative <b>thrust</b> <b>reverser</b> configurations consisted of a <b>cascade</b> <b>thrust</b> <b>reverser</b> with porous fan-duct blocker, a blockerless <b>thrust</b> <b>reverser,</b> two core-mounted target thrust reversers, a multi-door crocodile <b>thrust</b> <b>reverser,</b> and a wing-mounted <b>thrust</b> <b>reverser.</b> Each of the innovative <b>thrust</b> <b>reverser</b> concepts offer potential weight savings and/or design simplifications over a conventional <b>cascade</b> <b>thrust</b> <b>reverser</b> design. Testing was conducted in the Jet-Exit Test Facility at NASA Langley Research Center using a 7. 9 %-scale exhaust system model with a fan-to-core bypass ratio of approximately 9. 0. All tests were conducted with no external flow and cold, high-pressure air was used to simulate core and fan exhaust flows. Results show that the innovative <b>thrust</b> <b>reverser</b> concepts achieved <b>thrust</b> <b>reverser</b> performance levels which, when {{taking into account the}} potential for system simplification and reduced weight, may make them competitive with, or potentially more cost effective than current state-of-the-art <b>thrust</b> <b>reverser</b> systems.

40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>thrust</b> <b>reversing</b> on stability, control and {{vertical}} tail loads of advanced fighter aircraft are reviewed. Several static test stand and wind tunnel investigations of nonaxisymmetric nozzles with integral thrust reversers are presented, {{and it is}} found that base drag on the aft face of reverser panels of blockers provides a significant contribution to in-flight <b>thrust</b> <b>reverser</b> performance. The location of tail surfaces relative to the <b>thrust</b> <b>reverser</b> has significant impact on control surface effectiveness, and depending on <b>thrust</b> <b>reverser</b> location, large vertical tail side force can result from the use of in-flight thrust reversers. It is concluded that highly effective nonaxisymmetric nozzle reversers can be designed to achieve a 50 % static <b>reverse</b> <b>thrust...</b>|$|R

5000|$|Target-type thrust reversal, {{particularly}} this design, {{was invented}} in 1968. This invention is stated to be an improvement to previous design. As early as 1963, an invention called [...] "two part thrust reversal" [...] appeared with a similar deflector door design. However, in two part <b>thrust</b> <b>reverser,</b> the mechanism for door deployment and location of deflector doors are significantly {{different from those of}} target-type <b>thrust</b> <b>reverser.</b> The inventors (one also as inventor of target-type) states that the design can increase the <b>reverse</b> <b>thrust</b> to 50% of the original thrust. In an earlier development in 1954 called [...] "locks for jet thrust reversers", the design for thrust reversal also contain a flap device to help decelerate and the main purpose of the <b>thrust</b> <b>reverser</b> was to block airflow rather than provide <b>reverse</b> <b>thrust.</b> Dated back to 1945, the first invented thrust reversal device intended to [...] "provide a deflecting device", which can be identified as the first concept for target-type <b>thrust</b> <b>reverser.</b>|$|R

50|$|The Fokker 100 {{aircraft}} {{incorporates a}} safety system {{to deal with}} an accidental deployment of a <b>thrust</b> <b>reverser</b> on take-off or when in flight; the system automatically moves the thrust control of the affected Rolls-Royce Tay 650-15 engine to reduce power, the aeroplane then being capable of climbing out safely on the full power of the one unaffected engine, or of maintaining normal flight at reduced power. In addition, a micro-switch, activated by the aircraft's main landing gear leaving the ground, disables the <b>thrust</b> <b>reverser</b> operating circuitry, preventing inadvertent operation of the <b>thrust</b> <b>reverser</b> in flight.|$|R
