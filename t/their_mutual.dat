5|$|Almirante Latorres genesis can {{be traced}} to the {{numerous}} naval arms races between Chile and Argentina, which in turn were spawned by territorial disputes over <b>their</b> <b>mutual</b> borders in Patagonia and Puna de Atacama, along with control of the Beagle Channel.

5|$|The IUCN {{currently}} recognizes {{only one}} species of giraffe with nine subspecies. In 2001, a two-species taxonomy was proposed.

The study deduced from genetic differences in nuclear and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) that giraffes from these populations are reproductively isolated and rarely interbreed, though no natural obstacles block <b>their</b> <b>mutual</b> access. This includes adjacent populations of Rothschild's, reticulated, and Masai giraffes. The Masai giraffe was also suggested to consist of possibly two species separated by the Rift Valley.|$|E
