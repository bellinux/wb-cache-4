He received the most publicity for his tenure as independent counsel while Bill Clinton was U.S.president. Starr was initially appointed to investigate the suicide death of deputy White House counsel Vince Foster and the Whitewater real estate investments of Bill Clinton. The three-judge panel charged with administering the Independent Counsel Act later expanded the inquiry into numerous areas including an extramarital affair <b>that</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> had with Monica Lewinsky.

500|$|Bill Oakley, who was {{a writer}} on The Simpsons at the time, {{came up with the}} idea for [...] "Two Bad Neighbors" [...] two years before {{production}} began. Oakley got the inspiration for the episode after the feud between the Bushes and the Simpson family, and two years later when he and Josh Weinstein became showrunners of The Simpsons, they assigned Ken Keeler to write it. Oakley said <b>that</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> had been President of the United States for two years at the point when the episode went into production, so the feud had [...] "faded off into oblivion". The staff therefore thought it would be funny if the two parties encountered each other again.|$|E
500|$|Clinton {{received}} sustained {{national attention}} {{for the first}} time when her husband became a candidate for the 1992 Democratic presidential nomination. Before the New Hampshire primary, tabloid publications printed assertions <b>that</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> had engaged in an extramarital affair with Gennifer Flowers. In response, the Clintons appeared together on 60 Minutes, where Bill denied the affair, but acknowledged [...] "causing pain in my marriage". This joint appearance was credited with rescuing his campaign. During the campaign, Hillary made culturally disparaging remarks about Tammy Wynette's outlook on marriage as described in her classic song [...] "Stand by Your Man", and later in the campaign about how she could have chosen to be like women staying home and baking cookies and having teas, but wanted to pursue her career instead. The remarks were widely criticized, particularly by those who were, or defended, stay-at-home mothers and in retrospect, were ill-considered by her own admission. Bill said that in electing him, the nation would [...] "get two for the price of one", referring to the prominent role his wife would assume. Beginning with Daniel Wattenberg's August 1992 The American Spectator article [...] "The Lady Macbeth of Little Rock", Hillary's own past ideological and ethical record came under attack from conservatives. At least twenty other articles in major publications also drew comparisons between her and Lady Macbeth.|$|E

Nonetheless, he praised a 2007 Supreme Court decision upholding a 2003 ban on the procedure, saying that this was because the 2003 law had included [...] "more scientific language protecting the life of the mother." [...] However, Media Matters disputed Giuliani's contention that more scientific language had been inserted into the 2003 bill.|$|E
2500|$|Before the caucus, {{comments}} made by Obama concerning former Republican president Ronald Reagan attracted rebuke from rivals and dissection from all sections of the media. Obama had stated in an interview that: [...] "Ronald Reagan changed the trajectory of America {{in a way that}} Richard Nixon did not and in a way <b>that</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> did not." [...] According to the New York Times, Hillary Clinton [...] "ridiculed the idea that the Republicans were the party of ideas, suggesting Mr. Obama had said that the Republicans had 'better' ideas". MSNBC noted that Senator John Edwards [...] "criticized Obama specifically for referring to Ronald Reagan as an agent of change [...] in a newspaper interview [...] 'I would never use Ronald Reagan as an example of change.'" ...|$|E

[...] The soccer mom was described in the article as [...] "the overburdened middle income working mother who ferries her kids from soccer practice to scouts to school."

Castellanos was later quoted in The Wall Street Journal as saying [...] "She's the key swing consumer in the marketplace, and the key swing voter who will decide the election." ...|$|E

Lynch was criticized for her involvement in the meeting and was called on by some critics to recuse herself from involvement in the FBI's investigation of the email case.

During later testimony, he stated that President Clinton did have a comprehensive plan on dealing with terrorism. As summarized by the Toledo Blade, [...] "In his August 2002 briefing, Mr. Clarke told reporters (1) that the Clinton administration had no overall plan on al-Qaeda to pass on to the Bush Administration; (2) that just days after his inauguration, Mr. Bush said he wanted a new, more comprehensive anti-terror strategy; (3) that Mr. Bush ordered implementation of anti-terror measures that had been kicking around since 1998, and (4) that before Sept. 11, Mr. Bush had increased fivefold the funding for CIA covert action programs against al-Qaeda. ... It's reasonable enough to argue that Mr. Bush could have done more to guard against terror, though it isn't clear what. What is incredible is to argue—as Mr. Clarke did before the 9/11 Commission—that President Clinton was more concerned about al-Qaeda than Mr. Bush was." ...|$|E
