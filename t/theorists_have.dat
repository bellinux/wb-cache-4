5|$|Following Maldacena's insight in 1997, <b>theorists</b> <b>have</b> {{discovered}} {{many different}} realizations of the AdS/CFT correspondence. These relate various conformal field theories to compactifications of string theory and M-theory in various numbers of dimensions. The theories involved {{are generally not}} viable models of the real world, but they have certain features, such as their particle content or high degree of symmetry, which make them useful for solving problems in quantum field theory and quantum gravity.|$|E

5|$|Many music <b>theorists</b> <b>have</b> used Parsifal {{to explore}} {{difficulties}} {{in analyzing the}} chromaticism of late 19th century music. Theorists such as David Lewin and Richard Cohn have explored the importance of certain pitches and harmonic progressions both in structuring and symbolizing the work. The unusual harmonic progressions in the leitmotifs which structure the piece, {{as well as the}} heavy chromaticism of act 2, make it a difficult work to parse musically.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, the (2,0)-theory {{has proven}} to be {{important}} for studying the general properties of quantum field theories. Indeed, this theory subsumes many mathematically interesting effective quantum field theories and points to new dualities relating these theories. For example, Luis Alday, Davide Gaiotto, and Yuji Tachikawa showed that by compactifying this theory on a surface, one obtains a four-dimensional quantum field theory, and there is a duality known as the AGT correspondence which relates the physics of this theory to certain physical concepts associated with the surface itself. More recently, <b>theorists</b> <b>have</b> extended these ideas to study the theories obtained by compactifying down to three dimensions.|$|E
5|$|A few {{theoretical}} physicists {{have argued}} that classical physics is intrinsically incapable of explaining the holistic aspects of consciousness, but that quantum theory may provide the missing ingredients. Several <b>theorists</b> <b>have</b> therefore proposed quantum mind (QM) theories of consciousness. Notable theories falling into this category include the holonomic brain theory of Karl Pribram and David Bohm, and the Orch-OR theory formulated by Stuart Hameroff and Roger Penrose. Some of these QM theories offer descriptions of phenomenal consciousness, as well as QM interpretations of access consciousness. None of the quantum mechanical theories has been confirmed by experiment. Recent publications by G. Guerreshi, J. Cia, S. Popescu, and H. Briegel could falsify proposals {{such as those of}} Hameroff, which rely on quantum entanglement in protein. At the present time many scientists and philosophers consider the arguments for an important role of quantum phenomena to be unconvincing.|$|E

5|$|Kiarostami's films often {{reflect upon}} {{immaterial}} {{concepts such as}} the soul and afterlife. At times, however, {{the very concept of}} the spiritual seems to be contradicted by the medium itself, given that it has no inherent means to confer the metaphysical. Some film <b>theorists</b> <b>have</b> argued that The Wind Will Carry Us provides a template by which a filmmaker can communicate metaphysical reality. The limits of the frame and the representation through dialogue with another that is not represented, physically become metaphors for the relationship between this world and those that may exist apart from it. By limiting the space of the mise en scène, Kiarostami expands the space of the art.|$|E
5|$|<b>Theorists</b> <b>have</b> {{worked to}} {{understand}} these response patterns by constructing mathematical models of neurons and neural networks, which can be simulated using computers. Some useful models are abstract, focusing on the conceptual structure of neural algorithms rather than {{the details of how}} they are implemented in the brain; other models attempt to incorporate data about the biophysical properties of real neurons. No model on any level is yet considered to be a fully valid description of brain function, though. The essential difficulty is that sophisticated computation by neural networks requires distributed processing in which hundreds or thousands of neurons work cooperatively—current methods of brain activity recording are only capable of isolating action potentials from a few dozen neurons at a time.|$|E
5|$|While domain-specific {{accounts}} of word learning argue for innate constraints that limit infants' hypotheses about word meanings, domain-general perspectives argue that word learning can {{be accounted for}} by general cognitive processes, such as learning and memory, which are not specific to language. Yet other <b>theorists</b> <b>have</b> proposed social pragmatic accounts, which stress the role of caregivers in guiding infants through the word learning process. According to some research, however, children are active participants in their own word learning, although caregivers may still {{play an important role in}} this process. Recently, an emergentist coalition model has also been proposed to suggest that word learning cannot be fully attributed to a single factor. Instead, a variety of cues, including salient and social cues, may be utilized by infants at different points in their vocabulary development.|$|E

5|$|The Turn of the Screw (also {{known as}} Ghost Story: The Turn of the Screw) is a British {{television}} film based on Henry James's 1898 ghost {{story of the}} same name. Commissioned and produced by the BBC, it was first broadcast on 30 December 2009, on BBC One. The novella was adapted for the screen by Sandy Welch, and the film was directed by Tim Fywell. Although generally true to the tone and story of James's work, the film {{is set in the}} 1920s—in contrast to the original 1840s setting—and accentuates sexual elements that some <b>theorists</b> <b>have</b> identified in the novella. The film's story is told in flashbacks during consultations between the institutionalised Ann (Michelle Dockery) and Dr Fisher (Dan Stevens). Ann tells how she was hired by an aristocrat (Mark Umbers) to care for the orphans Miles (Josef Lindsay) and Flora (Eva Sayer). She is met at the children's home, Bly, by Mrs Grose (Sue Johnston), the housekeeper. Ann soon begins to see unknown figures around the manor, and seeks an explanation.|$|E
5|$|The film is an {{adaptation}} of Henry James's 1898 novella The Turn of the Screw. As one of his more popular stories {{it had already been}} adapted for films and television many times, although not previously by the BBC. The adaptation was screenwritten by Sandy Welch, who set the film in the early 1920s, in contrast to the novella's 1840s setting. This allowed the introduction of the Freudian psychiatrist interviewing the main character; this framing device is not used by James, but both the novella and the film share a first-person narrator. The updated setting also allowed the First World War to account for the lack of male staff at the house. The Freudian and libidinous elements some literary <b>theorists</b> <b>have</b> seen in James's story are particularly prevalent in the film, with Ann's repressed sexual feelings for the Master resulting in a number of highly sexual sequences. Further, Welch added a theological element not present in James's story; Ann's father is a preacher, although Ann herself is unsure of her faith. The psychiatrist, by contrast, is an atheist. When he asks Ann about her faith, she replies that she believes in the Devil.|$|E

40|$|I {{argue that}} {{consideration}} of certain cases of severe depression reveals {{a problem for}} desire-based theories of welfare. I first show that depression {{can result in a}} person losing her desires and then identify a case wherein it seems right to think that, as a result of very severe depression, the individuals described no longer have any desires whatsoever. I argue that the state these people are in is a state of profound ill-being: their lives are going very poorly for them. Yet desire theories get this case wrong. Because no desires are being frustrated, the desire <b>theorist</b> <b>has</b> no grounds for ascribing ill-being; indeed, because the individuals described seem utterly without desire, the desire <b>theorist</b> <b>has</b> no grounds for treating these people as subjects of welfare ascription at all. I argue that these results are unacceptable; therefore, we should reject desire-based theories of well-being and ill-being...|$|R
