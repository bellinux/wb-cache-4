The song was {{produced}} by Timbaland, Timberlake and Harmon while Jones provided additional production. It was recorded the Larrabee Studios in North Hollywood, Los Angeles. Timberlake arranged and produced his vocals. Harmon provided keyboards for the song, while Ives played the guitar. The track was engineered by Chris Godbey and mixed by Jimmy Douglass, Godbey and Timberlake; for the process they were assisted by Alejandro Baima. The keyboards were provided by Harmon. It was sent to country radio in the United States on November 23, 2015, as the fourth and final single from The 20/20 Experience – 2 of 2 (2013). Regarding the single release, Sony Music Nashville executive vice president, promotion/artist development Steve Hodges stated, [...] "we received several requests from key programmers {{and we decided to}} get them a shortened version [...] so they didn't have to air the longer cut from the album," [...] adding [...] "our promotion staffs will not be actively working the single, we simply wanted to make the song easily accessible for country radio. Now <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>it</b> and can play it if they'd like" [...] in an interview for Billboard.|$|E

500|$|While imprisoned, Kemper {{has participated}} {{in a number of}} interviews, {{including}} a segment in the 1982 documentary The Killing of America, as well as an appearance in the 1984 documentary Murder: No Apparent Motive. His interviews are notable for their contribution to understanding the mind of serial killers, with FBI profiler John E. Douglas describing Kemper as [...] "among the brightest prison inmates" [...] he ever interviewed and capable of [...] "rare insight for a violent criminal." [...] Kemper is also forthcoming about the nature of his crimes and has said that he participated in the interviews to save others like himself from killing; stating {{at the end of his}} Murder: No Apparent Motive interview: [...] "There's somebody out there that is watching this and hasn't done that – hasn't killed people, and wants to, and rages inside and struggles with that feeling, or is so sure <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>it</b> under control. They need to talk to somebody about it. Trust somebody enough to sit down and talk about something that isn't a crime; thinking that way isn't a crime. Doing it isn't just a crime, it's a horrible thing, it doesn't know when to quit and it can't be stopped easily once it starts." [...] He also conducted an interview with French writer Stéphane Bourgoin in 1991.|$|E

2500|$|Along the way, {{she created}} a {{television}} dynasty and reached several [...] "firsts". Ball {{was the first}} woman in television to be head of a production company: Desilu, the company that Arnaz and she formed. After their divorce, Ball bought out Arnaz's share of the studio, and she proceeded to function as a very active studio head. Desilu and I Love Lucy pioneered a number of methods still in use in television production today such as filming before a live studio audience with a number of cameras, and distinct sets adjacent to each other. During this time, Ball taught a 32-week comedy workshop at the Brandeis-Bardin Institute. Ball was quoted as saying, [...] "You cannot teach someone comedy; either <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>it</b> or they don't." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{field of}} play is 110 by 60 yards (100 by 55 meters). The goals are 6 ft by [...] and are [...] apart. Each goal sits inside a {{circular}} [...] "crease", measuring [...] in diameter. The goalie has special privileges within the crease to avoid opponents' stick checks. Offensive players or their sticks may not {{enter into the}} crease at any time. The mid-field line separates the field into an offensive and defensive zone for each team. Each team must keep four players in its defensive zone and three players in its offesive zone at all times. It does not matter which positional players satisfy the requirement. A team that violates this rule is offsides and either loses possesion of the ball it <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>it</b> or incurs a technical foul if they do not.|$|E
2500|$|The lords' {{failure to}} {{understand}} {{the need for an}} impartial and functioning judiciary is echoed in the rebellion; [...] "The virulent ambition and hostility to law that characterised the barons equally characterise the workmen," [...] suggesting there is no difference between the old order and the new. This is evident in Cade's speech after ordering the execution of Lord Saye; [...] "The proudest peer in the realm shall not wear a head on his shoulders unless he pay me tribute. There shall not a maid be married but she shall pay to me her maidenhead ere <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>it.</b> Men shall hold of me in capite. And we charge and command that their wives be as free as heart can wish or tongue can tell" [...] (4.7.112–117). In this proposed new world order, Cade envisions establishing an autocracy where all will pay fealty to him, and where his laws, which he can make arbitrarily, stand for everyone. As such, in this political system, as in the old, law and justice seem to have little relevance.|$|E

2500|$|In {{a rather}} {{different}} notice written in 1350, Ludolph of Sudheim, a parish priest from Westphalia, correctly {{refers to the}} Pyramids as sepulchers, and says [...] "these tombs are called by the natives Pharaoh's granaries." [...] Some twenty years earlier the German Dominican William of Boldensele had traveled about Egypt and left (1336) a very critical account of the notion: [...] "the simple people of the country say that these were Pharaoh's barns and granaries in which Joseph had the wheat kept {{in the time of}} the great famine mentioned in the Bible ... But this cannot be true at all, for no place for putting in the wheat can be found there, and there is in inside these columns no empty space where anything can be placed. [...] For from top to bottom they are closed and made entirely of huge stones well joined to one another—except that there is a very small door quite high above the ground and a very narrow and very dark little passage through which one descends there for a certain distance, but it is not all wide enough to put grain in, as those of the country say and believe." [...] The German knight's memoir would provide the framework, and many of the details, {{for one of the most}} popular books of the late Middle Ages, the Travels of John Mandeville (1356). [...] The supposed author most likely did not visit the locales in his narrative, and in the case of his account of the Pyramids, he actually reverses the conclusions and reasoning of William: [...] "these are Joseph’s Granaries, which he had made to store the wheat for hard times ... Some say that they are tombs of the great lords of antiquity, but that is not true, for the common word through the whole country near and far is that they are Joseph's Granaries, and <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>it</b> written thus in their chronicles. [...] On the other hand, if they were tombs, they would not be empty inside, nor would they have entrances for going inside, nor are tombs ever made of such a large size and such a height—which is why it is not to be believed that they are tombs." ...|$|E
