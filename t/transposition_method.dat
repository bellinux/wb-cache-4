40|$|Abstract — Cryptography {{has been}} through {{numerous}} phases of evolution. Early ciphers in cryptography were designed to allow encryption and decryption to take place by hand, while those which are developed and used today are only possible due to the high computational performance of modern machines [1]. Conceptually cryptographic technique divided into two categories substitution and <b>transposition</b> <b>methods.</b> <b>Transposition</b> Ciphers are a bit different to Substitution Ciphers. Whereas Substitution ciphers replace each letter with a different letter or symbol to produce the cipher text, in a Transposition cipher, the letters are just moved around. There are numerous number of algorithms are proposed in both techniques. But combination of these techniques rare in the cryptographic trends. So this paper is providing combination of caesar cipher and railfence cipher are proposed. Also the caesar cipher key generation new way to proposed using automatic key generation techniques. Our algorithm supports security for the data containing alphabets with case sensitive, numbers and special characters.

40|$|The {{conceptual}} rainfall-runoff model Hysim is used {{to estimate}} the flow in ungauged catchments in Scotland by Scottish Water. However, there are non-quantified uncertainties associated with the outcomes of the modelling strategy used. In order to identify and quantify these uncertainties {{it was necessary to}} use the framework of proxy-basin validation in order to evaluate the performance of different modelling strategies.    The proxy-basin validation test requires hydrologically analogous catchments for the evaluation of models, a Region Of Influence regionalisation method was used in order group selected catchments by Q 95 (%MF). Four groups of four catchments were established, which covered Q 95 (%MF) 5 - 7 %, 7 - 9 %, 9 - 11 % and 11 - 13 %.    The allocation of “donor catchment” and “target catchment” for each Q 95 (%MF) group was accomplished through discussion with Scottish Water with respect to existing Scottish Water modelled catchments. A single donor catchment and three target catchments were therefore indicated for each group.    Two modelling strategies were developed by the study; the first full <b>transposition</b> <b>method</b> used the entire optimised parameter-set from the donor catchment {{with the exception of the}} target catchment’s “catchment area” parameter. The second partial <b>transposition</b> <b>method</b> used the entire optimal parameter-set with the exception of the target catchment’s “interception storage”, “time to peak”, “rooting depth” and “catchment area” parameters.     It was found that the full <b>transposition</b> <b>method</b> had the least uncertainty associated its use for flow estimation when the parameter-set was derived from a donor catchment calibration that was excellent. Contrarily, it was found that the partial transposition model method had the least uncertainty associated with flow estimation for parameter-sets that were derived from a relatively poor donor catchment calibration.    Encouraged by this testing framework, this study has suggested the use of catalogue of donor parameter-sets that can be used to estimate flow for catchments that are hydrologically similar. This strategy of hydrological modelling has been recommended to improve existing Scottish Water Hysim methodology...|$|E

However, the full potential of iBACS as vectors can only be realised after thorough genetic characterisation, including identification of those genetic locations that are non-essential for virus replication.

40|$|Staphylococcus aureus {{produces}} biofilm {{and this}} mode of colonization facilitates infections that are often difficult to treat and engender high morbidity and mortality. We have exploited bacteriophage Mu <b>transposition</b> <b>methods</b> to create an insertional mutant library in a highly biofilm-forming S. aureus clinical isolate. Our screen identified 38 insertions in 23 distinct genes together with one intergenic region that significantly reduced biofilm formation. Nineteen insertions were mapped in loci not previously known to affect biofilm in this organism. These include insertions in codY, srrA, mgrA, and fmtA, a putative DEAD-box helicase, {{two members of the}} zinc-metallo-beta lactamase/beta-CASP family, and a hypothetical protein with a GGDEF motif. Fifteen insertions occurred in the icaADBC operon, which produces intercellular adhesion antigen (PIA) and is important for biofilm formation in many strains of S. aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Obtaining a high proportion of independent Em-Mu disruptions in icaADBC demonstrated both the importance of PIA for biofilm formation in this clinical strain and the strong validation of the screening procedure that concomitantly uncovered additional mutants. All non-ica mutants were further analyzed by immunoblotting and biochemical fractionation for perturbation of PIA and wall teichoic acid. PIA levels were diminished in the majority of non-ica insertional mutants. Three mutant strains were chosen and were functionally complemented for restored biofilm formation by transformation with plasmids carrying the cloned wild-type gene under the control of a xylose-inducible promoter. This is a comprehensive collection of biofilm-defective mutants that underscores the multifactorial genetic program underlying the establishment of biofilm in this insidious pathogen...|$|R

40|$|Background Surgical {{approaches}} to the jugular foramen are often complex and lengthy procedures associated with significant morbidity based on the anatomic and tumor characteristics. In addition {{to the risk of}} intra-operative hemorrhage from vascular tumors, lower cranial nerves deficits are frequently increased after intra-operative manipulation. Accordingly, modifications in the surgical techniques have been developed to minimize these risks. Preoperative embolization and intra-operative ligation of the external carotid artery have decreased the intraoperative blood loss. Accurate identification and exposure of the cranial nerves extracranially allows for their preservation during tumor resection. The modification of facial nerve mobilization provides widened infratemporal exposure with less postoperative facial weakness. The ideal approach should enable complete, one stage tumor resection with excellent infratemporal and posterior fossa exposure and would not aggravate or cause neurologic deficit. The aim {{of this study is to}} present our experience in handling jugular foramen lesions (mainly glomus jugulare) without the need for anterior facial nerve <b>transposition.</b> <b>Methods</b> In this series we present our experience in Kasr ElEini University hospital (Cairo–-Egypt) in handling 36 patients with jugular foramen lesions over a period of 20 years where the previously mentioned preoperative and operative rules were followed. The clinical status, operative technique and postoperative care and outcome are detailed and analyzed in relation to the outcome. Results Complete cure without complications was achieved in four cases of congenital cholesteatoma and four cases with class B glomus. In advanced cases of glomus jugulare (28 patients) (C and D stages) complete cure was achieved in 21 of them (75 %). The operative complications were also related to this group of 28 patients, in the form of facial paralysis in 20 of them (55. 6 %) and symptomatic vagal paralysis in 18 of them (50 %). Conclusions Total anterior rerouting of the facial nerve carries a high risk of facial paralysis. So it should be reserved for cases where the lesion extends beyond the vertical ICA. Otherwise, for less extensive lesions and less aggressive pathologies, less aggressive approaches could be adopted with less hazards...|$|R

Computing string or {{sequence}} alignments is {{a classical}} method of comparing strings and has applications {{in many areas}} of computing, such as signal processing and bioinformatics.

In this paper, we show that there is a close connection between semi-local string alignment and a certain class of traditional comparison networks known as transposition networks. The transposition network approach can be used to represent different string comparison algorithms in a unified form, and in some cases provides generalisations or improvements on existing algorithms. This approach allows us to obtain new algorithms for sparse semi-local string comparison and for comparison of highly similar and highly dissimilar strings, as well as of run-length compressed strings.
