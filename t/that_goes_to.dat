An example is ferroelectric materials, where the change from a paraelectric to a ferroelectric state occurs at the Curie temperature and is related to a change from the high-symmetry paraelectric state to the lower symmetry ferroelectric state, accompanied by a so-called soft phonon mode, a vibrational lattice mode <b>that</b> <b>goes</b> <b>to</b> zero frequency at the transition.|$|E

Items dropped by some enemies will raise the number of uses if it is below the starting value.

25|$|Such {{a stance}} of {{dividing}} blood into major components and minor fractions rather than either accepting all blood or requiring all blood components {{to be poured}} out onto the ground has led to criticism from {{organizations such as the}} Associated Jehovah's Witnesses for Reform on Blood. Witnesses respond that blood as the fluid per se is not the real issue. They say the real issue is respect and obedience regarding blood, which they perceive as being God's personal property. Members are allowed to eat meat that still contains small traces of blood remaining. Once blood is drained from an animal, the respect has been shown to God and then a person can eat the meat. Jehovah's Witnesses view of meat and blood is therefore different from the Jewish view <b>that</b> <b>goes</b> <b>to</b> great lengths to remove even minor traces of blood.|$|E

500|$|To {{meet the}} Port Authority's {{requirement}} to build 10million square feet (930,000m²) of office space, the buildings would each {{need to be}} 110 stories tall. A major limiting factor in building heights is elevators; the taller the building, the more elevators are needed to service the building, requiring more space-consuming elevator banks. Yamasaki and the engineers decided to use a new system that included sky lobbies, which are floors where people can switch from a large-capacity express elevator, which goes only to the sky lobbies, to a local elevator <b>that</b> <b>goes</b> <b>to</b> each floor in a section (the local elevators can be stacked within the same elevator shaft). Located on the 44th and 78th floors of each tower, the sky lobbies enabled the elevators to be used efficiently, while also {{increasing the amount of}} usable space on each floor from 62 to 75 percent by reducing the number of required elevator shafts. [...] The World Trade Center towers were the second supertall buildings to use sky lobbies, after the John Hancock Center in Chicago. [...] This system was inspired by the New York City Subway system, whose lines include local stations where local trains stop and express stations where all trains stop.|$|E

Each [...] "quadrant" [...] housed two rooms for the residents with additional rooms in the ell and the third floor has four additional bedrooms with the dormer windows. The third floor of the ell was used as attic storage space. At the time of nomination to the National Register of Historic Places, the alterations that had been made to the house were described as [...] "minor and inconspicuous, consisting mainly of alterations to windows and dormers to provide egress to necessary fire-escapes." [...] The porch is believed {{to be a part of}} the original design, but it was noted that if it was a later addition it would likely have been done before 1920.
