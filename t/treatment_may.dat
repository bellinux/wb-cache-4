5|$|Left untreated, Wilson's disease {{tends to}} become {{progressively}} worse and is eventually fatal.

5|$|The {{majority}} of discharges from hospice {{are due to}} the death of the patient, although hospice <b>treatment</b> <b>may</b> not end then as care also provides for a period of bereavement counseling for the family afterward. However, there are several other scenarios when a patient may be discharged from hospice.|$|E
5|$|Three stages may be distinguished: {{an initial}} stage {{in which the}} {{individual}} with PD has already developed some disability requiring pharmacological treatment, a second stage associated with the development of complications related to levodopa usage, and a third stage when symptoms unrelated to dopamine deficiency or levodopa <b>treatment</b> <b>may</b> predominate.|$|E
5|$|Thrombolysis, stenting {{and surgery}} {{are not used}} as widely as anticoagulation or {{antiplatelet}} drugs. These treatments are invasive or more risky, and are typically reserved for situations where symptoms worsen despite medical treatment, or where medical <b>treatment</b> <b>may</b> be unsafe (e.g. an unacceptable bleeding tendency).|$|E

50|$|Cancer <b>treatments</b> <b>may</b> vary {{depending}} on what type of cancer is being targeted, but one challenge remains in all of them: it is incredibly difficult to target without killing good cells. Cancer drugs and therapies all have very low selective toxicity. However, {{with the help of}} nanotechnology and RNA silencing, new and better <b>treatments</b> <b>may</b> be on the horizon for certain forms of cancer.|$|R
5|$|Treatment of {{the thyroid}} disease usually leads to {{resolution}} of the paralytic attacks. Depending {{on the nature of}} the disease, the <b>treatment</b> <b>may</b> consist of thyrostatics (drugs that reduce production of thyroid hormone), radioiodine, or occasionally thyroid surgery.|$|E
5|$|A {{clinical}} exam {{is often}} used {{as a means to}} diagnose CSF leaks. Improved patient response to conservative <b>treatment</b> <b>may</b> further define a positive diagnosis. The lack of clinician awareness of the signs -symptoms and ailments- of a CSF leak is the greatest challenge to proper diagnosis and treatment, in particular: the loss of the orthostatic characteristic of headache and that every chronic CSF leaker will have a unique symptom set that as a whole contributes to the underlying condition, and diagnosis of, a CSF leak.|$|E
5|$|Another {{leading cause}} of {{blindness}} is Canine glaucoma. This {{is an increase in}} the pressure of the fluid in the eye which, if left untreated, can cause visual impairment and eventual loss of sight. The condition can be inherited (Primary glaucoma) or a secondary condition to a variety of other eye issues including tumors or lens luxation. Both breeds are affected by juvenile cataracts which can occur at up to four years of age. Symptoms can include discoloring of the pupil, and <b>treatment</b> <b>may</b> include surgery to remove the cataract.|$|E
50|$|There is {{no known}} cure for AD, {{although}} <b>treatments</b> <b>may</b> reduce the severity {{and frequency of}} flares.|$|R

5|$|Cancer {{changes over}} time, and pain {{management}} needs to reflect this. Several {{different types of}} <b>treatment</b> <b>may</b> be required as the disease progresses. Pain managers should clearly explain to the patient {{the cause of the}} pain and the various treatment possibilities, and should consider, as well as drug therapy, directly modifying the underlying disease, raising the pain threshold, interrupting, destroying or stimulating pain pathways, and suggesting lifestyle modification. The relief of psychological, social and spiritual distress is a key element in effective pain management.|$|E
5|$|Evidence of {{worsening}} kidney damage {{would normally}} prompt a kidney biopsy. <b>Treatment</b> <b>may</b> be indicated {{on the basis}} of the appearance of the biopsy sample; various treatments may be used, ranging from oral steroids to a combination of intravenous methylprednisolone (steroid), cyclophosphamide and dipyridamole followed by prednisone. Other regimens include steroids/azathioprine, and steroids/cyclophosphamide (with or without heparin and warfarin). Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is occasionally used.|$|E
5|$|Four {{subspecies}} are recognised; {{there are}} zones with intermediate forms between the ranges of each subspecies, contrasting with the well-defined borders between M. lamberti {{and the other}} chestnut-shouldered wrens. However, molecular analysis may shed more light on relationships and the current taxonomic <b>treatment</b> <b>may</b> change. The purple-backed- and lavender-flanked fairywrens were considered distinct species in the past.|$|E

5|$|Linezolid {{was quite}} {{expensive}} in 2009; {{a course of}} <b>treatment</b> <b>may</b> cost one or two thousand U.S. dollars for the drug alone, not to mention other costs (such as those associated with hospital stay). With the medication becoming generic the price has decreased such that in United States the wholesale cost of a course of treatment as of 2016 is about US$137.90. In India as of 2015 a month of linezolid, as {{would be used to}} treat tuberculosis cost about USS$60.|$|E
5|$|Physiotherapy and {{occupational}} therapy are beneficial {{for patients with}} the neurologic form of the disease. The copper chelating <b>treatment</b> <b>may</b> take {{up to six months}} to start working, and these therapies can assist in coping with ataxia, dystonia, and tremors, as well as preventing the development of contractures that can result from dystonia.|$|E
5|$|The {{primary goal}} in {{treatment}} of IIH is {{the prevention of}} visual loss and blindness, as well as symptom control. IIH is treated mainly through the reduction of CSF pressure and, where applicable, weight loss. IIH may resolve after initial <b>treatment,</b> <b>may</b> go into spontaneous remission (although it can still relapse at a later stage), or may continue chronically.|$|E

5|$|Care may be {{provided}} in a patient's {{home or in}} a designated facility, such as a nursing home, hospital unit or freestanding hospice, with level of care and sometimes location based upon frequent evaluation of the patient's needs. The four primary levels of care provided by hospice are routine home care, continuous care, general inpatient, and respite care. Patients undergoing hospice <b>treatment</b> <b>may</b> be discharged {{for a number of}} reasons, including improvement of their condition and refusal to cooperate with providers, but may return to hospice care as their circumstances change. Providers are required by Medicare to provide to patients notice of pending discharge, which they may appeal.|$|E
5|$|For the dentist, {{the goal}} of {{treatment}} generally is to relieve the pain, and wherever possible to preserve or restore function. The treatment depends on {{the cause of the}} toothache, and frequently a clinical decision regarding the current state and long-term prognosis of the affected tooth, as well as the individual's wishes and ability to cope with dental treatment, will influence the treatment choice. Often, administration of an intra-oral local anesthetic such as lidocaine and epinephrine is indicated in order to carry out pain-free treatment. <b>Treatment</b> <b>may</b> range from simple advice, removal of dental decay with a dental drill and subsequent placement of a filling, to root canal treatment, tooth extraction, or debridement.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{greatest}} potential dangers {{of faith in the}} Bates method is that a believer may be disinclined to seek medical advice regarding what could be a sight-threatening condition requiring prompt treatment, such as glaucoma. Also, children with vision problems may require early attention by a professional in order to successfully prevent lazy eye. Such <b>treatment</b> <b>may</b> include exercises, but which are different from those associated with the Bates method, and parents who subscribe to Bates' ideas may delay seeking conventional care until it is too late. It may further be necessary for a child at risk of developing lazy eye to wear the proper correction.|$|E
