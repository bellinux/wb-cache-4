40|$|The {{role of the}} non maxwellian {{nitrogen}} {{atoms in}} the odd nitrogen thermospheric chemistry is investigated with a numerical model. This one-dimensional model solves the continuity equation, including molecular and turbulent transport for the coupled NO-N([SUP] 4 [/SUP]S) system. It is shown that the very fast reaction between hot N([SUP] 4 [/SUP]S) atoms and O[SUB] 2 [/SUB] provides an additional source of nitric oxide. At equatorial latitudes, <b>this</b> <b>contribution</b> <b>amounts</b> <b>to</b> 6 - 30 % of the other classical production sources of NO for solar minimum activity conditions. The cross section for elastic collisions with ambient gas introduces the largest uncertainty on this estimate.

40|$|International audienceWood is {{a natural}} {{composite}} material with a complex multi-scale structure. Its stiffness is mainly due to crystalline cellulose fibrils reinforcing the cell walls. In order to quantify the contribution of cellulose to wood elastic properties in both tension and compression, the change in cellulose (004) lattice spacing (cellulose crystal strain) was measured by X-ray diffraction during a bending test on poplar specimens. A detailed methodology is presented to accurately quantify this cellulose crystal strain. Results show that during elastic loading, cellulose crystal strain is roughly proportional to wood strain. The strain ratio (cellulose crystal strain / wood strain) was close to 0. 75, and {{did not differ significantly}} in tension and compression. Interpretation of the strain ratio with respect to cellulose orientation shows that part of the wood strain occurs without inducing cellulose crystal strain. <b>This</b> <b>contribution</b> <b>amounts</b> <b>to</b> 10 - 15 % of wood strain, and its possible origin at different levels of wood ultra-structure is discussed...|$|R
40|$|The energy {{distribution}} of translationally hot nitrogen {{atoms in the}} thermosphere has been calculated using a nonequilibrium kinetic model. Dissociation by solar EUV photons and photoelectrons is found to provide {{an important source of}} non-Maxwellian high energy N(4 S) atoms. It is shown that quenching of metastable N(2 D) atoms by atomic oxygen also produces significant amounts of hot N(4 S) atoms. The fraction of hot N atoms reacting with O 2 is found to be about 15 percent of the production rate of atomic nitrogen by N 2 dissociation by photon and photoelectron impact and quenching of N(2 D) metastable atoms by atomic oxygen. The very fast reaction between hot N(4 S) atoms and O 2 is shown to provide an additional source of nitric oxide.

40|$|The {{reliance}} on volunteers for the delivery and administration of sport within the United Kingdom is gaining increasing attention. For example, {{two out of}} the eleven priorities in Sportscotland’s strategic plan relate to the importance and development of volunteers (Sport Scotland, 2003). Similarly, Sport England identifies the enormous contribution made by volunteers. A recent report (Taylor et al, 2003) states that nearly 6 million people volunteer in sport related activities each year. <b>This</b> <b>contribution</b> <b>amounts</b> <b>to</b> over 1. 2 billion hours and {{is estimated to be}} worth over £ 14 billion. Despite this recognition, research within the UK has been inclined to focus more on how many people volunteer rather than why they choose to do so. If sport is to continue to be dependant on the actions of volunteers, then it is vital that there is some understanding of the characteristics of such people, and the motivations that underpin their involvement in sport. Therefore, the focus of this research was to examine how the motivation of the volunteer changes over the course of their involvement in sport...|$|R

40|$|Understanding how {{information}} {{flowing in}} neuronal networks is encoded by populations of neurons {{is a fundamental}} problem in neuroscience. Brains and neuronal networksmustatthesametimestoreinformation about the world and react to information in the world. We used simulations of neocortical columns to measure how {{the activity of the}} network alters information flow and related this to experimental data from animal models of epilepsy and schizophrenia. In our simulations, we found that networks with greater internal connectivity reduced information flow from inputs to outputs, measured by normalized transfer entropy [1]. With no internal connectivity, the feed-forward network transformed inputs through nonlinear summation and thresholding. With greater connectivity strength, the recurrent network translated activity and information due to contribution of activity from intrinsic network dynamics. <b>This</b> dynamic <b>contribution</b> <b>amounted</b> <b>to</b> added information coming from the network. Gradual reduction in information flow-through with increased internal weight was asymptotic. At one extreme, the highly interconnected network was epileptic and any input ignited a seizure [2]. Such networks no longer accepted external information and no longer coordinated well with other brain areas. These types of networks also had more stereotyped activity patterns, with lesser information content present in the network and minimal information communicated from outside. EEG data from an animal model of epilepsy showed a similar reduction in entropy, which was also accompanied with a decrease in coordination between different brain areas. At a lower level of dynamic pathology, abnormalities in power and coordination in gamma bands were seen...|$|R
