It won the award for Video of the Year at the first YouTube Music Awards in 2013, which generated much attention for beating other popular nominees like Justin Bieber and Psy despite <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> group was considered lesser-known to the Western audience at the time.|$|E

5|$|A third species, L. consors, was {{established}} by Marsh in 1894 for YPM 1882, which consists of most of one articulated skeleton and part {{of at least one}} other individual. The skull was only partially preserved, and <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> vertebrae were represented only by centra suggests a partially grown individual. Galton (1983) notes that much of the current mounted skeleton was restored in plaster, or had paint applied.|$|E
5|$|Alarmed at {{the popular}} appeal of Paine's Rights of Man, the king issued a {{proclamation}} against seditious writings in May 1792. Booksellers and printers bore {{the brunt of}} this law, the effects of which {{came to a head}} in the 1794 Treason Trials. Johnson testified, publicly distancing himself from Paine and Barlow, despite <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> defendants were received sympathetically by the juries.|$|E
5|$|Alsos teams {{rounded up}} German {{scientists}} including Kurt Diebner, Otto Hahn, Walther Gerlach, Werner Heisenberg, and Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker, who {{were taken to}} England where they were interned at Farm Hall, a bugged house in Godmanchester.

5|$|Another {{purpose for}} issuing the edict {{might have been}} related to <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{periphery}} of the empire was now becoming central to its existence, and the granting of citizenship may have been simply a logical outcome of Rome's continued expansion of citizenship rights.|$|E
5|$|Despite <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Russos' {{studies found}} similar risk rates between virgin and {{pregnancy}} interrupted rats, their research {{would be used}} to support the contention that abortion created a greater risk of breast cancer for the next twenty years. However, because rats do not exhibit naturally occurring breast cancer, the extrapolation of these results to human abortion and breast cancer is viewed as dubious.|$|E

The television performance scene also contains a visual pun on the group's name, with photos of beetles visible {{on the wall behind}} the dancers.|$|E
5|$|During {{the second}} half of the 16th century, Europeans' {{interest}} in the New World revolved around gold and silver and not tobacco. The European lack of interest in tobacco was due to <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Amerindians controlled the tobacco industry; as long as the Amerindians controlled the supply there was no need for the incorporation in European commercial capitalism.|$|E
