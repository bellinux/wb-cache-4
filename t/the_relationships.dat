40|$|Internet {{pornography}} {{has many}} adverse effects, especially to <b>the</b> <b>relationship</b> commitment. <b>The</b> use of pornography directly correlates to {{a decrease in}} sexual intimacy. Hence, this might lead to weakening of <b>the</b> <b>relationship</b> of their partner. To find out {{the relevance of the}} claim, the researchers aimed to explore <b>the</b> <b>relationship</b> of Internet pornography consumption to <b>the</b> <b>relationship</b> commitment of married individuals in the Philippines. Different factors such as level of satisfaction, investment, quality of alternatives, relationship stability and viewing habits were also considered in determining <b>the</b> <b>relationship</b> of watching online pornography and <b>the</b> <b>relationship</b> commitment of Filipino married individuals. The study used the descriptive-correlational design. A self-administered survey was distributed to 400. It is revealed that Internet pornography consumption has an adverse effect on <b>the</b> <b>relationship</b> commitment of married Filipino couples. Furthermore, watching porn online weakened <b>the</b> <b>relationship</b> commitment that leads to an unstable relationship. This investigation found out that internet pornography consumption has a nominal negative effect on <b>the</b> <b>relationship</b> commitment of Filipino married individuals. It is proven on this study that internet pornography consumption can weaken <b>the</b> <b>relationship</b> commitment of married individuals thus, it promotes knowledge about numerous effect of it, negatively and even positively. This paper also contributes to pornography related researches on the country which can give further awareness about the said area. ...|$|R
