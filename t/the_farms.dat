5|$|Historically, two {{paths of}} the native {{indigenous}} peoples ran along parts of White Deer Hole Creek. Settlers arrived by 1770, but fled in 1778 during the American Revolutionary War. They returned and the creek served as the southern boundary of Lycoming County when it was formed on April 13, 1795. A logging railroad ran along the creek from 1901 to 1904 for timber clearcutting, and small-scale lumbering continues. During World War II a Trinitrotoluene (TNT) plant, which became a federal prison in 1952, {{was built in the}} watershed. Most development is in the eastern end of the valley, with two unincorporated villages, a hamlet, and most of <b>the</b> <b>farms</b> (many Amish).|$|E

5|$|After {{the death}} of the Member {{intestate}} in 1820, the estate was inherited by his younger brother George Ferguson (1748–1820), who died shortly after inheriting the estate. He was succeeded by his illegitimate son George Ferguson who, despite incurring severe debts, continued to develop the estate by adding a stable block, race course, an observation tower and other follies. He had huge gambling debts, and although the estate had been valued at £300,000 when he inherited it, he sold off many of <b>the</b> <b>farms</b> {{and other parts of the}} estate to raise funds. Despite these injections of funds, when he died the estate was mortgaged to the extent of £250,000. It was further decimated by his son, George Arthur Ferguson (1835–1924). George Arthur was sequestrated, and what remained of the estate was marketed in 1909. It was eventually sold in mid-1926, and the mansion house was knocked down.|$|E
5|$|Following {{two decades}} of uneasy peace, Britain and France {{declared}} war against one another in 1689. Despite the 1669 Treaty of Whitehall, in which European forces agreed that Continental conflicts would not disrupt colonial peace and neutrality, the war was fought primarily by proxy in New France and New England. The British of New York prompted local Iroquois warriors to attack New France's undefended settlements. While the British were preparing to engage in acts of warfare, the inhabitants of New France were ill-prepared to defend against the Indian attacks” due to the isolation of <b>the</b> <b>farms</b> and villages. Denonville {{was quoted as saying}} “If we have a war, nothing can save the country but a miracle of God,”.|$|E
5|$|In Mier, the {{spillway}} of the Las Blancas Dam was overtopped, {{causing a}} river bridge {{to be destroyed}} and electric power to be lost, as well.

In Altamira, 200families were evacuated as well, and relocated to seven shelters. Also, in the municipalities of Burgos, Cruillas, and Méndez there was flooding in collective farms and family dwellings.

5|$|In {{his spare}} time, Wright {{developed}} a fruit farm {{on the property}} with over a thousand fruit trees and bushes that he ordered from Jens Jensen in 1912. It is unknown exactly how many were planted, because part of the order was destroyed during a railroad strike. Wright requested two hundred and eighty-five apple trees planted, including one hundred McIntosh, fifty Wealthy, fifty Golden Russet, and fifty Fameuse. Among the bushes were three hundred gooseberry, two hundred blackberry, and two hundred raspberry. The property also grew pears, asparagus, rhubarb, and plums. The fruit and vegetable plants were placed along the contour of the estate, {{which may have been}} done to mimic <b>the</b> <b>farms</b> he saw while in Italy. Wright also dammed a creek on the property to create an artificial lake, which was stocked with fish and aquatic fowl. This water garden, probably inspired by the ones he saw in Japan, created a natural gateway to the property.|$|E
5|$|Malvern's rapid {{urbanisation}} {{during the}} latter half of the 19th century spread eastwards and northwards from Great Malvern, the traditional town centre on the steep flank of the Worcestershire Beacon, and engulfed the manors and farms in the immediate area.

5|$|Parts of Varanasi are {{contaminated}} with industrial chemicals including toxic heavy metal. Studies of wastewater from Varanasi's sewage treatment plants identify that water's contamination with metals and the reuse of this water for irrigation {{as a way}} that the toxic metals come to be in the plants that people grow for food. One studied example is palak, a popular leafy vegetable which takes up heavy metal when it is in the soil, and which people then eat. Some of the polluting sludge contains minerals which are fertiliser, which could make polluted water attractive to use. Pesticides used in local farming are persistent enough to be spread through the water, to sewer treatment, then back to <b>the</b> <b>farms</b> as wastewater.|$|E

5|$|The {{other two}} major {{settlements}} in the county are Dorchester, {{which has been the}} county town since at least 1305, and Weymouth, a major seaside resort since the 18th century.

Beaminster and Bridport are situated in the west of the county; Verwood and the historic Saxon market towns of Wareham and Wimborne Minster are located to the east. Lyme Regis and Swanage are small coastal towns popular with tourists. Under construction on the western edge of Dorchester is the experimental new town of Poundbury commissioned and co-designed by Prince Charles.
