5|$|A {{railroad}} {{was being}} built {{and the population}} of Quorn hoped that it would go through the village {{on its way to}} Sioux City, Iowa. However, <b>the</b> <b>railroad</b> did not go through Quorn. One of the many ideas about why <b>the</b> <b>railroad</b> took a different route was due to a disagreement between the Chicago and North Western Transportation Company and the Close brothers. The actual reason is still unknown. Due to <b>the</b> <b>railroad</b> being the main mode of transportation of goods, the villagers {{had no choice but to}} relocate to a new area. Every business except for a mill was moved to a new area during 1883.|$|E

5|$|Andrew Kepple, {{one of the}} {{original}} Altoona & Wopsononock directors, was elected president of the newly organized company. The board remained largely unchanged, although Shellenberger finally severed his association with <b>the</b> <b>railroad.</b> It remained unprofitable, and Davis, in turn, sold the line to Sigmund Morris, of Altoona. Morris had incorporated the Altoona Northern Railroad on November 7, 1912 to acquire the line, and the Altoona, Juniata and Northern was merged into it on January 16, 1913. Morris planned to convert <b>the</b> <b>railroad</b> to , electrify it to make it an interurban, and extend it to connect with the Beech Creek Railroad (a subsidiary of the New York Central Railroad) at Patton. However, Morris was unable to execute these plans. A group of New York City investors took over <b>the</b> <b>railroad</b> about 1916. They converted <b>the</b> <b>railroad</b> to standard gauge, operating initially with ex-Pennsylvania Railroad 2-6-0s, but replacing them with Heislers when the 2-6-0s were found to be unsuitable for the track.|$|E

50|$|American Express was one {{of several}} {{independent}} express companies that leased facilities from <b>the</b> <b>railroads.</b> <b>The</b> <b>railroads</b> also carried and serviced their cars for another fee.

5|$|By 1872, <b>the</b> <b>railroad</b> had {{extended}} from Portland to Roseburg. Along the way, it created growth in Willamette Valley {{towns such as}} Canby, Aurora, and Harrisburg, which emerged as freight and passenger stations, and provided a commercial lifeline to {{the part of the}} river valley above Harrisburg where steamships were rarely able to travel. As <b>the</b> <b>railroad</b> made its way into the Umpqua Valley, new townsites such as Drain, Oakland, and Yoncalla were laid out.|$|E
5|$|By 1942, <b>the</b> <b>railroad</b> {{was already}} seeing signs of {{decreased}} ridership: there were 600 daily riders on the Yonkers branch, down from 2,000 daily riders sixteen years prior. The Interstate Commerce Commission gave New York Central Railroad permission {{to abandon the}} branch on November 12, 1942. Subsequently, riders filed a lawsuit to keep the line open, and the federal lawsuit was heard by the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, who {{ruled in favor of}} <b>the</b> <b>railroad</b> on June 21, 1943. Nine days later, <b>the</b> <b>railroad</b> abandoned the line. By December 1944, the rails were being removed. The main line also saw fewer riders as the years passed, and on March B, 1958, with daily ridership numbering between 400 and 500 commuters, the New York State Public Service Commission gave its approval for <b>the</b> <b>railroad</b> to stop passenger service on the line. The last day of service was June 1, 1958, and the station was abandoned, the line now only being used for freight.|$|E
5|$|Construction resumed in 1901 on {{a portion}} of the {{southern}} route, to build a spur line to service coal mines on the Wasatch Plateau. <b>The</b> <b>railroad</b> branched from an existing line at Salina and traveled east up Salina Canyon.

50|$|<b>The</b> East Pennsylvania <b>Railroad</b> {{opened on}} May 11, 1859, {{connecting}} Allentown and Reading. As a result, <b>the</b> Allentown <b>Railroad</b> project was abandoned as traffic could move between Allentown and Reading on <b>the</b> East Pennsylvania <b>Railroad</b> and north to Auburn along <b>the</b> Reading <b>Railroad</b> mainine. In <b>the</b> early 1870s, <b>the</b> Reading <b>Railroad</b> laid track along the grade of <b>the</b> Allentown <b>Railroad</b> between Kutztown and <b>the</b> East Pennsylvania <b>Railroad</b> in Topton. <b>The</b> Allentown <b>Railroad</b> was formally merged into <b>the</b> Reading <b>Railroad</b> on December 31, 1945. Following the bankruptcy and consolidation of <b>the</b> Reading <b>Railroad</b> into Conrail, <b>the</b> Kutztown Transportation Authority {{took over the}} line. <b>The</b> East Penn <b>Railroad</b> later operated freight service on the line between Kutztown and Topton.|$|R

5|$|Details of the railroad's {{rolling stock}} are obscure. In 1891, it owned five {{passenger}} and three freight cars. In {{addition to the}} coaches that supported passenger runs to Wopsononock and Dougherty (fourteen trains per day during the 1899 season), <b>the</b> <b>railroad</b> {{had at least one}} parlor car and several Brill-built observation cars. Contemporary photographs show that <b>the</b> <b>railroad</b> built some of its own open-air cars for excursion service. Photographs taken after the destruction of the Wopsononock Hotel and the decline in passenger traffic show a number of gondola cars for coal traffic. <b>The</b> <b>railroad</b> continued to maintain a standard gauge gondola fleet {{in the last years of}} its existence.|$|E
5|$|Heeding Bryant's advice, Palmer {{decided to}} route <b>the</b> <b>railroad</b> {{south of the}} canyon and in March 1883, it {{completed}} its connection to Salt Lake City and {{for a brief period}} the canyon was on the main line of a transcontinental railroad system. While <b>the</b> <b>railroad</b> and early visitors used the canyon as a path to Utah and mines to the southwest, later visitors came to see the canyon as an opportunity for recreation and personal enjoyment.|$|E
5|$|In 1911, as the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad {{continued}} {{the project of}} eliminating at-grade crossings between streets and railroads, the Montclair Branch was the next to receive the structural change. Bloomfield criticized the Lackawanna railroad for making a disgrace of the community. <b>The</b> <b>railroad</b> proposed using $700,000 (1911 USD) of funds to construct a brand new station at Watsessing Avenue along with a new downtown Bloomfield Station. The cost of elevating and depressing <b>the</b> <b>railroad</b> came up to about $20,000 (1911 USD) for the Lackawanna. This contract by <b>the</b> <b>railroad</b> and township was approved after negotiations dating back to 1908. The negotiations included a park to be built between both stations {{on both sides of}} <b>the</b> <b>railroad.</b> The park land cost the township $50,000 to buy for the construction, and it was to {{be turned over to the}} Essex County Park Commission.|$|E
2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>railroads</b> proved {{inadequate}} {{to the increased}} freight volume created by World War I.

5|$|In 1926 the United States {{government}} forced <b>the</b> <b>railroad</b> to {{move out}} of its headquarters on Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, D.C. Although Harrison threatened to take the company headquarters to Atlanta, in the end a new headquarters building was built on McPherson Square.

5|$|The CrÃ©dit Mobilier of America scandal {{involved}} {{corruption in}} the financing of the Union Pacific Railroad, part of the transcontinental railroad that was completed in 1869.

CrÃ©dit Mobilier showed large profits and stock gains, and distributed substantial dividends. The high expenses meant that Congress was called upon to appropriate more funds. One of <b>the</b> <b>railroad</b> officials who controlled CrÃ©dit Mobilier was also a congressman, Oakes Ames of Massachusetts.
