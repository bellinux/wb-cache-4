5|$|Poliomyelitis is {{a disease}} of the central nervous system. However, CD155 is {{believed}} to be present on the surface of most or all human cells. Therefore, receptor expression does not explain why poliovirus preferentially infects certain tissues. This suggests that <b>tissue</b> <b>tropism</b> is determined after cellular infection. Recent work has suggested that the type I interferon response (specifically that of interferon alpha and beta) is an important factor that defines which types of cells support poliovirus replication. In mice expressing CD155 (through genetic engineering) but lacking the type I interferon receptor, poliovirus not only replicates in an expanded repertoire of tissue types, but these mice are also able to be infected orally with the virus.|$|E

Th 17 cells {{regulate}} anti-pathogenic and inflammatory responses, whereas PD 1 + T cells regulate B cell response. In part one, I examined the migration behavior and trafficking receptors of Th 17 cells to mucosal tissues. We found that Th 17 cells preferentially migrate to the intestine and associated-lymphoid tissues, and CCR 6 regulates Th 17 cell migration to the gut and effector T cell balance/distribution in inflamed intestine. In part two, I studied the roles of vitamin A and retinoic acid in generation of inflammatory Th 17 cells with distinct <b>tissue</b> <b>tropisms</b> within the intestine. We found that Th 17 cells with distinct <b>tissue</b> <b>tropisms</b> and pathogenic activities are generated depending on the available concentration of retinoic acid (RA). In part three, I investigated the function of PD- 1 -expressing T cells in regulation of human follicular T helper cells. We found {{that there are three}} different PD- 1 -expressing memory T cell subsets (i. e. PD- 1 low (+), PD- 1 medium (++), and PD- 1 high (+++) cells) in human tonsil. We found that these three PD- 1 -expressing T cell subsets are differentially localized in tonsils and have different functions. Moreover, we found that PD- 1 restrains the B cell-helping function of germinal center-localized T cells to prevent excessive antibody response. ^ Taken together, the research results indicate that T cells are highly heterogeneous in effector function and they have distinct migration capacities that determine the tissue sites of their effector functions. ...|$|R

40|$|This study {{determined}} the transovarial transmission (TOT) potential and <b>tissue</b> <b>tropisms</b> of Culex flavivirus (CxFV), an insect-specific flavivirus, in Culex pipiens (L.). Several hundred mosquito egg rafts {{were collected in}} the field, transferred to the insectaries, reared to the fourth larval instar, and identified using morphological characteristics. Cx. pipiens were reared to adults, allowed to oviposit in individual containers, and tested for CxFV RNA by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and nucleotide sequencing. Eighteen CxFV RNA-positive females were identified from 26 females that oviposited viable egg rafts. Thirty F 1 adults from each positive female were individually tested by RT-PCR for CxFV RNA. Viral RNA was detected in 526 of 540 progeny, and thus, the filial infection rate was 97. 4 %. Because all 18 positive females produced infected offspring, the TOT prevalence was 100 %. These data indicated that efficient TOT of CxFV occurs in nature. To define the <b>tissue</b> <b>tropisms</b> of CxFV, different tissues (salivary glands, ovaries, testes, head, fat bodies, and midguts) {{were removed from the}} remainder of the F 1 and tested by RT-PCR for CxFV RNA.

Additionally, uninfected laboratory-colonized Cx. pipiens were infected with CxFV by needle inoculation, and ovaries were collected at 4, 6, 8, and 12 d postinoculation and tested for CxFV RNA by RT-PCR. Viral RNA was detected at all time points, demonstrating that CxFV infects the ovaries as early as 4 d postinoculation. Surprisingly, however, we were unable to demonstrate transovarial transmission despite the presence of viral RNA in the ovaries. Nevertheless, the experiments performed with field-infected Cx. pipiens demonstrate that TOT is an efficient mechanism by which CxFV is maintained in mosquitoes in nature...|$|R

Avian fibroblasts resist transformation by insertionally activated c-erbB (IAc-erbB), whereas erythroblasts are transformed by this mutant of the epidermal growth factor receptor. In studies presented here, NIH/ 3 T 3 cells resisted transformation by IAc-erbB. This finding indicates that the nonpermissiveness of fibroblasts is conserved between avian and murine species. Surprisingly, expression of IAc-erbB blocked transformation by a v-erbB allele. The trans-dominant interference by IAc-erbB occurred despite expression at levels lower than for v-erbB. Together with previous reports, {{the results indicate that}} IAc-erbB can exert opposite growth effects in different tissues. The switch from positive to negative growth regulation, which depends on the cellular context, provides novel insight into tissue-specific regulation of receptor tyrosine kinases.

40|$|Infectious {{bronchitis}} (IB) {{is one of}} {{the major}} economically important poultry diseases distributed worldwide. It is caused by infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) and affects both galliform and nongalliform birds. Its economic impact includes decreased egg production and poor egg quality in layers, stunted growth, poor carcass weight, and mortality in broiler chickens. Although primarily affecting the respiratory tract, IBV demonstrates a wide range of <b>tissues</b> <b>tropism,</b> including the renal and reproductive systems. Thus, disease outcome may be influenced by the organ or tissue involved as well as pathotypes or strain of the infecting virus. Knowledge on the epidemiology of the prevalent IBV strains in a particular region is therefore important to guide control and preventions. Meanwhile previous diagnostic methods such as serology and virus isolations are less sensitive and time consuming, respectively; current methods, such as reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP), and sequencing, offer highly sensitive, rapid, and accurate diagnostic results, thus enabling the genotyping of new viral strains within the shortest possible time.

40|$|Adsorption and {{penetration}} of retroviruses into eucaryotic cells is mediated by retroviral envelope glycoproteins interacting with host receptors. Recombinant avian leukosis viruses (ALVs) differing only in envelope determinants that interact with host receptors for subgroup A or E ALVs {{have been found}} to have unexpectedly distinctive patterns of tissue-specific replication. Recombinants of both subgroups were highly expressed in bursal lymphocytes as well as in cultured chicken embryo fibroblasts. In contrast, the subgroup A but not subgroup E host range allowed high levels of expression in skeletal muscle, while subgroup E but not subgroup A envelope glycoproteins permitted efficient replication in the thymus. A subgroup B virus (RAV- 2), like the subgroup E viruses, demonstrated a distinct bursal and thymic tropism, further supporting the theory that genes encoding receptors for subgroup B and E viruses are allelic. The source of long terminal repeats (LTRs) or adjacent sequences also influenced tissue-specific replication, with the LTRs from endogenous virus RAV- 0 supporting efficient replication in the bursa and thymus but not in skeletal muscle. These results indicate that ALV env and LTR regions are responsible for unexpectedly distinctive <b>tissue</b> <b>tropisms...</b>|$|R
5000|$|There is no {{research}} {{specifically on the}} cytopathic effect of CYLV, however {{there is a general}} pattern in the Closteroviridae family that might apply to this particular virus. Closteroviruses are usually phloem-limited, but some groups might infect parenchyma and mesophyll cells; therefore, closteroviruses are more often described simply as [...] "phloem-associated" [...] with regard to <b>tissue</b> <b>tropism.</b> That is why symptoms are associated with phloem; the cytopathology is mainly caused by vesicles containing virus particles, which is also a form of diagnosis.Another important viral mechanism is the capacity to escape the host's immune system. In plants, a common strategy is the use of interference RNA or RNAi, which are short sequences homologous to the viral genome. When these short sequences bind to the genome, they prevent transcription into dsDNA, therefore controlling the infection. Some viruses have developed proteins called Silencing Suppressors in response to RNAi. The mechanism is unknown, but mutation in those proteins allow the plant to recover from the viral infection and prevents systemic infections.|$|E
50|$|The outcome, {{including}} disease severity and <b>tissue</b> <b>tropism,</b> of RF {{can vary}} significantly {{depending on the}} infecting serotype due to a difference in variable major proteins (VMPs), which include variable small proteins (Vsps) and variable large proteins. B. turicatae has two antigenically distinct isogenic serotypes, Bt1 and Bt2, which differ only in their expressed Vsps, thus in their degree of virulence and tropism, or {{the location of the}} infection. Infection with serotype 1 can cause severe vestibular dysfunction and increased morbidity and mortality. Coinfection with serotype 2 reduces the severity of vestibular dysfunction and prevents early mortality. Infection with serotype 2 causes severe arthritis, but coinfection with serotype 1 has little effect on this. This shows that the combination of serotype present during mixed infection significantly influences the manifestations of infection with B. turicatae. Bt2 (20-kDa Vsp2) causes higher spirochetemia and neonatal mortality, as well as severe arthritis, while Bt1 (23-kDa Vsp1) is more neurotropic. Bt1 localizes to the brain in five- to 10-fold higher numbers than Bt2, while Bt2 features five- to 10-fold higher pathogen load in the blood, joints, heart, and skin than Bt1. Additionally, Bt2 causes more severe systemic disease than Bt1, including conjunctivitis, ruffled skin, tibiotarsal arthritis, reduced spontaneous activity, and neonatal mortality. As significant differences exist in the ability of the individual serotypes to enter the brain, and the only difference between the serotypes is their VMPs, expressing certain VMPs (such as Vsp1) may facilitate brain invasion. Additionally, RF borreliae tend to persist in the brain after they disappear from the blood, a phenomenon referred to as residual brain infection.|$|E

The analysis of the amino acid sequences deduced from the individual ORFs revealed that 35 of the 124 potential gene products of ISKNV show significant homology to functionally characterized proteins of other species. Some of the putative gene products of ISKNV showed significant homologies to proteins in the GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ databases including enzymes and structural proteins involved in virus replication, transcription, protein modification, and virus–host interaction. In addition, one major repeated sequence showing significant homology to the Red Sea bream iridovirus (RSIV) genome was identified. Based on the information obtained from biological properties (including histopathology, <b>tissue</b> <b>tropisms,</b> natural host range, and geographic distribution), physiochemical and physical properties, and genome analysis, we suggest that ISKNV, RSIV, sea bass iridovirus, grouper iridovirus, and African lampeye iridovirus may belong to a new genus of the Iridoviridae family and are tentatively referred to as cell hypertrophy iridoviruses...|$|R
