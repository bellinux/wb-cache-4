He's unable {{to remain in}} any job for any great length of time before making an embarrassing blunder and getting fired, and he's unemployed for {{a large amount of}} time throughout the series. Very often, the blunder is lying and trying to cover it up, only <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> fall apart. Most of the many short-lived jobs George holds throughout the series are in sales.|$|E
500|$|By {{the mid-1960s}} Harrison {{had become an}} admirer of Indian culture and mysticism, {{introducing}} {{it to the other}} Beatles. During the filming of Help! in the Bahamas, they met the founder of Sivananda Yoga, Swami Vishnu-devananda, who gave each of them a signed copy of his book, The Complete Illustrated Book of Yoga. Between {{the end of the last}} Beatles tour in 1966 and the beginning of the Sgt Pepper recording sessions, he made a pilgrimage to India with his wife Pattie; there, he studied sitar with Ravi Shankar, met several gurus, and visited various holy places. In 1968 he travelled to Rishikesh in northern India with the other Beatles to study meditation with Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. Harrison's use of psychedelic drugs encouraged his path to meditation and Hinduism. He commented: [...] "For me, it was like a flash. The first time I had acid, it just opened up something in my head that was inside of me, and I realized a lot of things. I didn't learn them because I already knew them, but that happened to be the key that opened the door to reveal them. From the moment I had that, I wanted <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> the time – these thoughts about the yogis and the Himalayas, and Ravi's music." ...|$|E
500|$|The main cast {{includes}} Eddie Cibrian, who {{was cast}} as Nick Dalton, the central {{character in the}} series. In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Cibrian stated that Dalton was a [...] "chameleon" [...] and very charismatic. He continued: [...] "On the facade, he seems <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>it</b> <b>all.</b> He's very successful. He's dating the head Playboy bunny. He's {{one of the first}} keyholders at the Playboy Club, but he has a very mysterious past." [...] Jeff Hephner was originally approached for the role after performing well in test auditions, but Hephner had no prior experience playing a television lead before, and the producers decided to let him go after the full cast table. Cibrian was cast just a few days before filming began. Amber Heard was approached by producers of the show to portray Bunny Maureen. Although the series premiere started with Nick helping Maureen out of a difficult situation, Heard said of the character, [...] "Don't underestimate that character and her intelligence, and the journey that she's going to take to really rise above that. [...] I think Maureen allows herself to be helped when she needs it, and by no means relies on any character, male or female, in this story, and never has." ...|$|E
50|$|In {{the past}} tense, Yazgulyam has {{tripartite}} marking—one {{of the very}} few languages in the world <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>it</b> at <b>all.</b> This means that the subject of an intransitive sentence is treated differently from both the subject and the object of a transitive sentence.|$|R

2500|$|It is Kitty, Laura's neighbour. Laura is {{panicked and}} excited. She {{wants to see}} Kitty but she is unprepared, looking too much, she believes, like [...] "the woman of sorrows". Kitty is invited in. She fits {{effortlessly}} and confidently into this post-war world of domestication, she seems <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>it</b> <b>all.</b> She notices Laura's amateur efforts at making a cake, just what Laura was dreading. Laura recognises her inability to fit into this domestic world, but also her inability not to care -she is trapped between two worlds. She also recognises, however, that Kitty {{does not have the}} perfect world her confidence implies. For example, Kitty has remained barren despite her desire to have children. On the other hand, the one thing Laura seems to be excelling at in the domestic sphere is producing progeny.|$|E
2500|$|There {{was never}} any formal {{structure}} or hierarchy to the Dubois Brothers group, other than the Brothers were on the top, they either individually or in tandem with each other controlled a particular criminal activity or territory and often shared their army or other members. The Dubois Brothers began in the 1950s [...] with petty street crimes and eventually {{moved on to the}} four oldest brothers- Raymond, Jean-Guy, Normand and Claude- starting to convince local bar owners to give them protection funds and other extortions. Some of their petty street crimes were a series of burglaries and armed robberies in the early 1950s. [...] By the time the 1960s rolled around extortion, targeting the owners and employees of nightclubs, bars and taverns in the eastern end of the city became their specialty. Near the end of the 1960s five of the brothers were charged with murdering a waiter at a quarrel in a local bar, which ended with the waiter shot, they were later acquitted and continued their reign. Into the late 1960s to 70s, the Dubois Brothers expanded their territory into the downtown nightclubs as they challenged the Cotroni Mafia family supremacy. The Cotroni Family began to show signs of weakness around the 1970s allowing the expansion of the Dubois Brothers territory into both the east and west ends of Montreal city. This movement allowed the Brothers to basically wipe out the rival Irish gang as well and take over a lucrative drug market by out muscling a motorcycle gang. The Dubois Brothers were prospering in the 1970s and continued to expand their territory and add to their criminal lifestyle. One of the Commissioners in the 1977 report described the Dubois brothers as living, in [...] "opulence if we can judge by the external manifestations of wealth, such as town houses, country houses, expensive cars and an ostentatious life style." [...] The Dubois Brothers seemed <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>it</b> <b>all.</b>|$|E

50|$|Beckman had {{an early}} {{career as a}} banker and {{stockbroker}} on Wall Street in the 1950s.

The experience permanently disillusioned him with the stock market and he thereafter adopted a cautious approach to investment that was slow but certain, saying that it took him more than 13 years to make his next million.|$|R

40|$|Some have {{suggested}} that work-life balance is a myth {{and it may be}} impossible <b>to</b> actually <b>have</b> <b>it</b> <b>all.</b> Others suggest that acceptance of ones place in life is essential to becoming comfortable with ones decisions to spend additional focus on family or work (Joyner, 2012). And still others suggest that only women feel guilt in association with choosing career over family at times during their lives (Spar, 2012). But ultimately, the message is that combining a fast-track career with a truly satisfying family life is a challenge for which few are prepared. How can faculty achieve career satisfaction and success while maintaining a fulfilling life outside of work...|$|R
