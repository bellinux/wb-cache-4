5|$|At present, {{there are}} two ways to get to Arad: by air or road. The only highway {{connecting}} Arad with the rest of the country is Highway 31, which connects it with Beersheba to the west, and <b>the</b> <b>Dead</b> <b>Sea</b> to the east. It has two junctions within Arad's municipal area—the Arad Junction (within the city itself, with Road 3199), and the Tel Arad Junction (with Highway 80). The local Road 3199 connects Arad with Masada, but does not connect to the road next to <b>the</b> <b>dead</b> <b>sea</b> (Highway 90). It is therefore the only way to get to Masada's western side.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Dead</b> <b>Sea</b> is {{receding}} at {{an alarming}} rate. Multiple canals and pipelines were proposed to reduce its recession, which had begun causing many problems.

The {{first phase of the}} project is scheduled to begin in 2018 and to be completed in 2021. Phosphate mines in the south have made Jordan one of the largest producers and exporters of this mineral in the world.|$|E

5|$|According to Patrick Drazen, {{the series}} {{contains}} numerous allusions to the Kojiki and the Nihongi, the Shinto {{vision of the}} primordial cosmos and the mythical lances of the Shinto deities Izanagi and Izanami. Elements of the Judeo-Christian tradition also feature prominently throughout the series, including references to Adam, Lilith, Eve, the Lance of Longinus, <b>the</b> <b>Dead</b> <b>Sea</b> Scrolls, the Kabbalistic concept of Adam Kadmon, the Tree of Life, among many others. The merging of all human souls into one through the Human Instrumentality Project {{at the end of}} the series is similar to the Kabbalistic concept of tikkun olam. The Evangelions have been likened to the golem of Jewish folklore, and their visual design resembles the traditional depictions of oni (Japanese demons or ogres).|$|E

In 1984, however, Tchernov wrote that P.predomesticus was about 140,000 years old, from the Yabrudian. Layer E1 contained remains of about 40bird species, including a premaxilla Tchernov described as a precursor of <b>the</b> <b>Dead</b> <b>Sea</b> sparrow (Passer moabiticus) and a tarsometatarsus and humerus tentatively allied with the house sparrow. An undetermined Acheulean layer of the same cave also contained fossils Tchernov described as precursors of both the house and Spanish sparrows.|$|E

Since 1971, Arad has been producing phosphoric acid, made from brine collected from <b>the</b> <b>Dead</b> <b>Sea,</b> and phosphates from the nearby Tzefa. Rotem Amfert Negev Ltd, a subsidiary of Israel Chemicals Ltd (ICL), has been planning a new phosphate plant in the Sdeh Brir area for several years. In 2008, the Ministry of the Environment decided not to contest the company's bid, despite studies showing it may increase air pollution-related deaths in the area.|$|E
