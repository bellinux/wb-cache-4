500|$|All of {{the many}} {{elements}} in the dream sequences have meaning, {{with the exception of}} the Cheese Man. Whedon explains: [...] "...the Cheese Man—meaningless. Why? Because I needed something in the show that was meaningless, because there is always something in the dream that doesn't make any sense at all. In this case it was the Cheese Man. He confounds everybody because of that, and people ascribe him meaning. <b>This</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> means that we're being successful, because this means they're not worried about everything else, which means they sort of did understand most other things." ...|$|E
500|$|While {{living at}} the Chelsea Hotel, Solanas {{introduced}} herself to Maurice Girodias, the founder of Olympia Press and a fellow resident of the hotel. In August 1967, Girodias and Solanas signed an informal contract stating that she would give Girodias her [...] "next writing, and other writings". In exchange, Girodias paid her $500. She took this to mean that Girodias would own her work. She told Paul Morrissey that [...] "everything I write will be his. He's done <b>this</b> <b>to</b> <b>me...</b> He's screwed me!" [...] Solanas intended {{to write a novel}} based on the SCUM Manifesto, and believed that a conspiracy was behind Warhol's failure to return the Up Your Ass script. She suspected that he was coordinating with Girodias to steal her work.|$|E
500|$|In the season-ending RAC Rally in Great Britain, Mouton {{continued}} her good performances by running third at half distance, despite having been uncomfortable about competing in a rally where pacenotes and practice are not allowed. However, her Quattro later incurred gearbox problems and she retired from fifth place after sliding {{off the road}} into a snow-filled ditch. Mouton would later state: [...] "For me, rallying is England. No pacenotes – just you in the car having to do the fastest time. <b>This,</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> is rallying. OK, {{it was not easy}} for me because I did not have experience there of the British championship, but it is really rallying. I like it very much." [...] Mouton finished the season in eighth place in the drivers' championship, while Audi was fifth in the manufacturers' standings.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the end of}} April 2009, Berlusconi's wife Veronica Lario, {{who would}} divorce him several years later, wrote an open letter expressing her anger at Berlusconi's choice of young, {{attractive}} female candidates—some {{with little or no}} political experience—to represent the party in the 2009 European Parliament elections. Berlusconi demanded a public apology, claiming that for the third time his wife had [...] "done <b>this</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> {{in the middle of an}} election campaign", and stated that there was little prospect of his marriage continuing. [...] On 3 May, Lario announced she was filing for divorce. She claimed that Berlusconi had not attended his own sons' 18th birthday parties, and that she [...] "cannot remain with a man who consorts with minors" [...] and [...] "is not well".|$|E
2500|$|The duet {{part was}} {{and still is}} {{performed}} regularly on stage by Meat Loaf with his current featured female vocalist Patti Russo. However, with the passing years and the consequent greater maturity of both singers, their interplay during the coda has gradually taken on ironic overtones, if not overtly comedic ones, which were totally absent from the original album version. For example, in the 2007 show 3 Bats Live, after Russo sings [...] "After a while you'll forget everything, it was a brief interlude and a midsummer night's fling", Meat Loaf stops the band and asks her (half-sung, half-spoken): [...] "Why do you say <b>this</b> <b>to</b> <b>me?</b> Why do you keep saying these things to me every single night?", and she replies innocently (again half-sung): [...] "It's in the lyrics". More funny exchanges of the same kind occur during their other live duets, such as the famous Bat Out of Hell track [...] "Paradise by the Dashboard Light".|$|E
2500|$|Raeder's last speech {{occurred}} as Commander-in-Chief occurred on 30 January 1943 before the Reichstag, where {{he asserted that}} he had brought the Navy [...] "smoothly and completely" [...] into {{the service of the}} Führer in 1933. Raeder argued that: [...] "This was possible only because, despite all outside efforts to influence it, the training of the Navy [...] derived from an inner attitude that was itself truly National Socialist. For this reason, we did not have to change, but could become followers of the Führer with open hearts. I find it particularly satisfying that the Führer has always attributed <b>this</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> and I would like to ask all of you {{to see to it that}} the Navy remains a strong and reliable support of the Führer in this regard". Though Hitler had cordial relations with Raeder, the two had never been close, and there was nothing like the mutual admiration that Hitler and Dönitz shared.|$|E

2500|$|The {{subsequent}} campaign ended abruptly {{in southern}} Romania's invasion by the Central Powers (Germans and their allies). In November 1916, shortly before King Ferdinand and the pro-Entente government retreated to Iași, they appointed Tzigara-Samurcaș a custodian of the Crown and Royal Domains, tasked with preventing acts of vandalism on the occupiers' part. He stayed behind in Bucharest {{and met with}} August von Mackensen, head of the occupation forces. As {{a result of this}} encounter, the Germans asked Tzigara to discuss an offer of collaboration with the senior Conservative Party Germanophiles: Maiorescu, Alexandru Marghiloman, Petre P. Carp. All three refused to openly associate with Mackensen's military rule, but a puppet civilian administration was set up under Carp's disciple Lupu Kostaki. Carp's reply to Tzigara's proposition is recorded as: [...] "Such a thing is of no interest to me; it is nonsense, and at this moment counts as weakness." [...] Maiorescu's deteriorating relationship with Carp was also a factor: Carp flatly refused to attend any meeting where Maiorescu was present, and alienated the other two by stating that King Ferdinand should be deposed. Maiorescu himself explained that {{it was a question of}} principle: [...] "Tzigara has been proposing <b>this</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> but I did not wish to. If [...] orders me to go, let him send in armed soldiers to take me." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2012, Ice Cube {{recorded}} a verse for a remix of the Insane Clown Posse song [...] "Chris Benoit", from ICP's The Mighty Death Pop! album, {{appearing on the}} album Mike E. Clark's Extra Pop Emporium. Also in 2012, Ice Cube had released more details on his upcoming tenth studio album titled, Everythang's Corrupt. A music video for the album's first single {{of the same name}} was released on the day before the 2012 USA Election. Ice Cube explained the inspiration and reason for the song saying, [...] "You know, this record is for the political heads. <b>This</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> is more a leak at the right time, in time, to drop it. We could have dropped a more catchier tune, but the time wouldn't have been right. The time is right for [...] "Everythang's Corrupt," [...] so that's what we wanted to do. We wanted to drop it at this point and time, and then come with a visual to highlight what we're saying in the music." [...] Everythang's Corrupt was released on iTunes in January 2013. The second single [...] "Crowded" [...] was released to iTunes on March 29. Ice Cube confirmed on his Twitter account that the album will be released in the fall of 2013 and will also be released via Lench Mob Records. However, the album would be pushed back once again with no release date currently set.|$|E
2500|$|When Narayanan {{returned}} to India in 1948, Laski {{gave him a}} letter of introduction to Prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru. Years later, he narrated how {{he began his career}} in the public service:When I finished with LSE, Laski, of his own, gave me a letter of introduction for Panditji. On reaching Delhi I sought an appointment with the PM. I suppose, because I was an Indian student returning home from London, I was given a time-slot. It was here in Parliament House that he met me. We talked for a few minutes about London and things like that and I could soon see {{that it was time for}} me to leave. So I said goodbye and as I left the room I handed over the letter from Laski, and stepped out into the great circular corridor outside. When I was half way round, I heard the sound of someone clapping from the direction I had just come. I turned to see Panditji [...] beckoning me to come back. He had opened the letter as I left his room and read it. [...] "Why didn't you give <b>this</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> earlier?" [...] "Well, sir, I am sorry. I thought it would be enough if I just handed it over while leaving." [...] After a few more questions, he asked me to see him again and very soon I found myself entering the Indian Foreign Service.|$|E
