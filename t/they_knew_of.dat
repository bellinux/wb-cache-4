5|$|Hergé {{had long}} sought to regain {{contact with his}} old friend Zhang Chongren, {{with whom he had}} lost contact. He {{regularly}} asked any Chinese people that he met if <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>of</b> Zhang, and in 1979 had some success when a staff member in a Brussels Chinese restaurant revealed that he was Zhang's godson. Hergé was thus able to re-establish contact with his old friend. The journalist Gérard Valet organised for Zhang to visit Brussels so that he and Hergé could be re-united. The event took place in March 1981, and was heavily publicised; Hergé however found the situation difficult, disliking the press attention and finding that he and Zhang had grown distant during the intervening years.|$|E
5|$|Police {{were also}} {{investigating}} whether a copycat element was involved after it emerged that both Saari and Pekka-Eric Auvinen, the gunman in the Jokela school shooting, had bought their guns {{from the same}} store. Both gunmen had taken photographs of themselves in similar poses, and both exchanged videos related to school shootings on YouTube and Finnish social networking site IRC-Galleria. In March 2009, Police ruled out contact with Pekka-Eric Auvinen, {{and said that he}} had committed his crimes alone: 200 people were interviewed during the investigation, none of whom said <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>of</b> Saari's plans.|$|E

5|$|Idris' {{government}} was increasingly unpopular {{by the latter}} 1960s; it had exacerbated Libya's traditional regional and tribal divisions by centralising the country's federal system {{in order to take}} advantage of the country's oil wealth, while corruption and entrenched systems of patronage were widespread throughout the oil industry. Arab nationalism was increasingly popular, and protests flared up following Egypt's 1967 defeat in the Six-Day War with Israel; allied to the Western powers, Idris' administration was seen as pro-Israeli. Anti-Western riots broke out in Tripoli and Benghazi, while Libyan workers shut down oil terminals in solidarity with Egypt. By 1969, the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency was expecting segments of Libya's armed forces to launch a coup. Although claims have been made that <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>of</b> Gaddafi's Free Officers Movement, they have since claimed ignorance, stating that they were monitoring Abdul Aziz Shalhi's Black Boots revolutionary group.|$|E
5|$|That morning, {{the police}} interrogated Fischer's girlfriend Marianela at the sheriff's office. They {{asked her if}} she had ever had cross words with Cristina. She said she had never talked to her, though she was {{confused}} why they asked about his ex-girlfriend. Cisneros was also interrogated, but the police found nothing unusual about her behavior, only that she was nervous, and had left her car keys inside her vehicle. Later that day, Cristina went to Buddy's house and offered her condolences. The police did not treat the Cisneros' connection to Fischer any differently {{than the rest of the}} leads. <b>They</b> <b>knew</b> <b>of</b> Cisneros's calls, but they did not think it was suspicious enough to rule the murder a crime of passion. His stepfather initially thought that the murder was tied to a legal dispute over a contract worth thousands of dollars he had with a Chinese shrimp firm based in Arroyo City, Texas, just north of Brownsville that he had terminated. The police began to investigate this lead, and told Fischer's family that they were probably in danger. For about two weeks, they rarely left their house, and his parents considered sending Kathy and Eric to San Antonio, Texas, where their grandparents lived.|$|E

25|$|In an {{associated}} case, Ashcroft v. al-Kidd (2011), Abdullah al-Kidd, an American citizen and convert to Islam, {{was arrested in}} 2003 and held for 16 days in maximum security prisons. He was under supervised release (house arrest) for 13 months. The federal government was holding him as a material witness against Al-Hussayen. After finally being released, al-Kidd sued Attorney General John Ashcroft personally, in {{a case in which}} he was represented by lawyers from the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). They said that <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>of</b> 70 other Muslim men who had been similarly detained in the early years following the 9/11 attacks. In 2009 the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco ruled that Ashcroft could be sued and held personally responsible for the wrongful detention of al-Kidd.|$|E
25|$|In {{the history}} of the Chinese, there were those who were {{familiar}} with the sciences of arithmetic, geometry, mechanics, optics, navigation, and astronomy. Mathematics in China emerged independently by the 11th century BC. It is indeed almost certain that the Chinese were acquainted with several geometrical or rather architectural implements; with mechanical machines; that <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>of</b> the characteristic property of the magnetic needle; and were aware that astronomical events occurred in cycles. Chinese of that time had made attempts to classify or extend the rules of arithmetic or geometry which they knew, and to explain the causes of the phenomena with which they were acquainted beforehand. The Chinese independently developed very large and negative numbers, decimals, a place value decimal system, a binary system, algebra, geometry, and trigonometry.|$|E
25|$|Regional {{studies found}} a {{different}} prevalence {{of sexual harassment}} by teachers. For example, {{in a survey of}} 148 high school graduates in North Carolina in 1989 the graduates were given a definition of sexual harassment and asked if they had experienced sexual harassment during their high school years. 43% reported inappropriate comments, looks, or gestures by a teacher, 17.5% reported sexual touching, and 13.5% indicated that they have had sexual intercourse with a teacher. In another study college students were asked to recall if they or other students had experienced sexual harassment by high school teachers. 6.5% of the respondents reported having personally experienced sexually inappropriate attention from high school teachers. Furthermore, more than 33% said that <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>of</b> a sexual relationship between a high school student and a teacher.|$|E

25|$|John Dean {{testified in}} June 1973 that Nixon was deeply {{involved}} in the Watergate cover-up, and mentioned that he suspected White House conversations were taped. Staff of the United States Senate Watergate Committee thereafter began to routinely ask witnesses appearing before the committee if <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>of</b> any taping system. Senate Watergate Committee staff then asked the White House for a list of dates on which the President had met with Dean. About June 20 or 21, Special White House Counsel for Watergate J. Fred Buzhardt provided the committee's Chief Minority (Republican) Counsel, Fred Thompson, with a document intended to impugn Dean's testimony. Buzhardt's document included almost verbatim quotations from meetings Nixon had with Dean. Thompson initially violated an agreement under which the majority and minority staff would share all information. When committee Majority Investigator Scott Armstrong obtained the document, he realized the document indicated the existence of a taping system.|$|E

[...] According to news articles covering lawsuits resulting from the Rolling Stone article, Jackie concocted the Haven Monahan persona in a catfishing scheme directed at a UVA classmate, Ryan Duffin. Duffin was a friend of Jackie's who had not responded to romantic overtures that Jackie had directed at him.|$|E
