2500|$|In November 1994, former Johnson {{administration}} {{attorney general}} Ramsey Clark met with Stewart {{and asked her}} to take Rahman on as a client after Rahman dismissed his court-appointed lawyer and his other lawyers, William Kunstler and Ron Kuby, were taken off the case for conflict of interest. Stewart was reluctant at first, but Clark convinced her to take the case, arguing that otherwise [...] "the Arab world would feel betrayed by their friends on the American left." [...] Interviewed by the Washington Post about her embrace of Rahman's case, she said, [...] "my own political sense <b>tells</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> only hope for change in Egypt is the fundamentalist movement." [...] Kuby, who had represented Rahman earlier, disagreed with Stewart's characterization, stating, [...] "I love Lynne, but no one in the world could fairly posit the sheikh as a progressive or liberal on any issue." [...] Stewart contended that she understood fundamentalists because attorney general [...] "John Ashcroft is one." ...|$|E
2500|$|Obama {{has said}} that the death penalty is used too {{frequently}} and inconsistently. However, he favors it for cases in which [...] "the community is justified in expressing the full measure of its outrage." [...] Speaking as a state senator about the Illinois legislature's constant additions to the list of factors that render a defendant eligible for the death penalty, Obama said, [...] "We certainly don't think that we should [...] have this laundry list that does not make any distinctions between the run-of-the-mill armed robbery that results in death and systematic killings by a terrorist organization. And I think essentially what the reduction of aggravating factors does is, it says, 'Here's a narrower set of crimes that we think potentially at least could deserve the death penalty.'" [...] In his own words, [...] "While the evidence <b>tells</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> death penalty does little to deter crime; I believe there are some crimes – mass murder, the rape and murder of a child – so heinous that the community is justified in expressing the full measure of its outrage by meting out the ultimate punishment. On the other hand, the way capital cases were tried in Illinois at the time was so rife with error, questionable police tactics, racial bias, and shoddy lawyering, that 13 death row inmates had been exonerated." ...|$|E
2500|$|The book of Darwin's {{dissertations}} {{does not}} mention Withering, but the first case described in its appendix is a [...] "Miss Hill of Aston near Newport" [...] who is given a more detailed description as case IV in Withering's book. Erasmus Darwin noted the date in his Commonplace book as 25 July 1776, {{and it appears that}} he learnt of the use of digitalis when both he and Withering saw this patient in consultation. Withering's description suggests he is annoyed at Darwin's incomplete account, and Page 8 of his book says that [...] "Dr. Duncan also <b>tells</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> late very ingenious and accomplished Mr. Charles Darwin, informed him of its being used by his father and myself, in cases of Hydrothorax, and that he has ever since mentioned it in his lectures, and sometimes employed it in his practice." [...] Though there is no indication as to the author of the case descriptions, implying that they were part of Charles Darwin's dissertation, in later publications Erasmus Darwin said he had appended case notes, and it seems clear that these were his own. In a paper, dated 14 January 1785 and read on 16 March of that year, Erasmus Darwin published a more detailed [...] "account of the successful use of foxglove", but this gained little attention. Withering's [...] "account" [...] has a preface dated 1 July 1885, and its publication later that year convinced physicians of the use of digitalis as treatment. While Darwin had priority of publication, Withering is rightly given credit for finding and developing this treatment, and was understandably annoyed at Erasmus Darwin. The book of dissertations also had a note of [...] "other ingenious works of the late Mr Darwin in the Hands of the Editor, which may at some distant time be given to the public". The only one discovered was Charles Darwin's unpublished manuscript on the pulse, which was found in the Medical Society of London.|$|E
