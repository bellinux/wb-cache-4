25|$|Main {{landmarks}} of Kaohsiung city {{includes the}} Tuntex Sky Tower, <b>the</b> <b>ferris</b> <b>wheel</b> of the Kaohsiung Dream Mall, the Kaohsiung Arena and the Kaohsiung Harbor. The newly developed city {{is also known}} for having {{a large number of}} shopping streets, organized night markets and newly developed leisure parks such as the Pier-2 Art Center, E-DA Theme Park or Taroko Park.|$|E
25|$|Some {{of these}} parks were {{developed}} in resort locations, such as bathing resorts at the seaside in New Jersey and New York. A premiere example in New Jersey was Atlantic City, a famous vacation resort. Entrepreneurs erected amusement parks on piers that extended from the boardwalk out over the ocean. The first of several was the Ocean Pier in 1891, followed later by the Steel Pier in 1898, both of which boasted rides and attractions typical of that time, such as Midway-style games and electric trolley rides. The boardwalk also had the first Roundabout installed in 1892 by William Somers, a wooden predecessor to <b>the</b> <b>Ferris</b> <b>Wheel.</b> Somers installed two others in Asbury Park, New Jersey and Coney Island, New York.|$|E

25|$|Among {{the first}} {{products}} to be rationed in St. Louis (and in the United States) was rubber, particularly tires, and by January 1, 1942, the St. Louis Rationing Board began regulating tire sales. St. Louis's tire quota for January 1942 was 2,154, which was mostly allocated toward emergency vehicles; home deliveries from stores virtually ceased, while high schools dropped spring sports {{for lack of}} tires to travel. Sugar rationing followed in May, and gasoline purchases were limited {{in the fall of}} 1942. Scrap drives were common in St. Louis, and in January 1943, scrap seekers attempted to uncover the remains of <b>the</b> <b>ferris</b> <b>wheel</b> that had been demolished {{after the end of the}} 1904 World's Fair. By 1943, meat and dairy products were in short supply in St. Louis, and milk supplies were inconsistent. St. Louis also was the first U.S. city to reach its war bond quota goal in both 1942 and 1943. However, during the 1944 bond campaigns, St. Louis was far behind the national average, and only reached its goal after a one-week extension.|$|E

While {{at the police}} station, Mercedes' lawyer, Joanne Cardsley (Rachel Leskovac), plants drugs in Mercedes' handbag {{in an attempt to}} ruin her relationship with Joe because of her own obsession with him. Mercedes spends the night in a cell and is released on her wedding day. At the wedding, Mercedes is devastated when Joe does not arrive. She confronts him and he admits that he cannot be with her after hearing about her arrest as he believes she is not an appropriate mother figure for his children and refuses to believe that Mercedes is innocent. He also admits to having a one-night stand with Joanne. Mercedes is furious and is even more angry when she sees Joe and Joanne together later that day. As a result, she crashes a car in to the restaurant and vows revenge on both of them. Joe and Joanne eventually begin a relationship, however the police later discover that the drugs didn't belong to Mercedes, and she realises that Joanne set her up. Joe realises Joanne's deceit and breaks up with her. At the [...] "Halloween Spooktacular", Joe plans to propose to Mercedes on <b>the</b> <b>ferris</b> <b>wheel</b> in order to win her back. Mercedes discovers Joe's plan and decides to embarrass him in front of everyone. While she is on <b>the</b> <b>ferris</b> <b>wheel</b> with Joe, she realises that she is still in love with him and forgives him. Joanne is furious when she sees Mercedes and Joe together, and pulls the brakes on <b>the</b> <b>ferris</b> <b>wheel,</b> leaving Joe and Mercedes stuck in the air. When a fire breaks out at the wooden maze, a rescue team arrive to save Mercedes and Joe. Mercedes is rescued from the wheel, an explosion caused by the fire rips through the funfair. As a result, Joe falls off <b>the</b> <b>ferris</b> <b>wheel</b> and plummets to his death after telling Mercedes he loves her.|$|E
500|$|On the DVD audio {{commentary}} for the episode, Kramer {{stated that}} there was an issue over which color to paint the fortunes with. Kramer wanted the fortunes to be white while one of his co-workers suggested they should be pink. Kramer stated that the co-worker had been to a Chinese restaurant close to the studio that had pink fortunes, and that [...] "that's why she [...]" [...] The animators also found it difficult to draw Mr Burns happy. Kramer stated that Burns was [...] "designed to look like a vulture" [...] and look [...] "evil all the time", so in order to make Burns look happy and more sympathetic, the animators had to change some things in Burns' regular model. For example, Burns' eyebrows are not visible through the majority of the episode. The scene with Mr Burns and Gloria on <b>the</b> <b>Ferris</b> <b>wheel</b> was difficult to animate as well, since the animators had to [...] "keep everything moving to sell it." [...] In the scene in which Snake's house is burning down, the animators chose to color the sky red, in order to reflect the fire as well as make the scene [...] "a little more exciting." ...|$|E

500|$|Clayton [...] "Jonesy" [...] Jones is an ex-baseball {{player who}} suffers from a {{crippling}} knee injury. He is Samson's right-hand man, operator of <b>the</b> <b>Ferris</b> <b>wheel,</b> {{and the leader of}} the roustabouts. Jonesy's original biography reveals his past as a star pitcher in the major league whose knee was injured in revenge when he refused to throw a game for the mob. Slipping to the edge of society, Jonesy joined the Carnivàle and found redemption in the eyes of young Sofie. The two became inseparable until Sofie grew into a woman, making their relationship awkward. At the beginning of the series, Jonesy is faced with Sofie avoiding his advances. While she retreats into a friendship with cootch dancer Libby Dreifuss, Jonesy finds sexual relief with Libby's mother Rita Sue. When Sofie begins to show interest in him, he breaks off his relationship with Rita Sue; however, {{the fact that he was}} sleeping with her (and that Libby knew about it) causes Sofie to break both of their hearts as pay back. After this Jonesy remains cold towards her yet finds new affection in Libby. The two eventually elope. Jonesy is kidnapped, tortured and left for dead by a man who had lost his wife in a Ferris wheel accident. Ben is able to heal Jonesy including his crippled knee, and Jonesy joins Ben on his last mission. In the series' final minutes, Jonesy and Sofie meet again, and she shoots him in cold blood.|$|E
500|$|On <b>the</b> <b>Ferris</b> <b>wheel,</b> with April and Andy arguing {{below him}} and Tom and Jerry arguing above him, an annoyed Ron (Nick Offerman) clears {{the air by}} announcing the obvious: April is mad at Andy for not telling her that he loves her back, and the missing Li'l Sebastian is Tom's fault. Andy tells April that he clearly loves her and they hug, and Tom apologizes to Jerry. Later, {{everyone}} spots Li'l Sebastian in the corn maze and recover him. Leslie learns the power outage was due to television crews plugging into the grid and overloading it. The only replacement generator in Pawnee is at the Wamapoke casino, and Leslie humbly asks Ken to loan it to her in exchange for placing a Wamapoke cultural exhibit near the Harvest Festival entrance. Ken agrees, and during the festival opening the next morning, he performs a meaningless ceremony to remove the fake curse. People begin to swarm into the festival, and Leslie cheerfully greets them. Ben returns to apologize to Leslie for leaving, admitting {{that he is not}} over his past. She reassures him the festival is as much his accomplishment as hers, and even has Ken break Ben's [...] "curse", although Ken's gesture is also completely meaningless. At the end, Ben appears to have been won over by Li'l Sebastian, but admits to the camera crew that he still fails to see the appeal and remains as baffled as ever.|$|E
2500|$|The DVD {{includes}} two alternative endings, which vary only slightly. The first alternative ending shows Rob and Beth exiting the Coney Island–Stillwell Avenue station {{instead of on}} <b>the</b> <b>Ferris</b> <b>wheel</b> and features different sirens in the background as Rob talks to the camera. In the second alternative ending, just after the final explosion, Beth can be heard screaming [...] "Rob!", followed by a very brief clip of an unknown person looking at the camera (in the commentary, Reeves {{said that it was}} one of the crew members) and brushing rubble off the lens. The film then ends with the original final clip of Rob and Beth on their Coney Island date recording themselves on <b>the</b> <b>Ferris</b> <b>Wheel</b> as the camera tape runs out, with two differences: there is no timestamp in the lower left-hand corner of the screen, and there is an additional beeping tone indicating the end of the tape.|$|E

2500|$|The vast {{majority}} of the Neptune Beach structures– the hand-carved carousel from the world-famed Dentzel Company, <b>the</b> <b>Ferris</b> <b>wheel,</b> the roller coaster, and other rides– were auctioned off in 1940 for mere pennies on the dollar of their original cost. Today, [...] A consequence of the Neptune Beach closing around 1940 was a total dearth of quality, clean swimming facilities in town. A grass roots effort to create swimming pools at two high schools and two city parks would continue into the early 1960s.|$|E
2500|$|In 1892, William Somers {{installed}} three fifty-foot wooden wheels at Asbury Park, New Jersey; Atlantic City, New Jersey; and Coney Island, New York. The {{following year}} he was granted the first U.S. patent for a [...] "Roundabout". George Washington Gale Ferris Jr. rode on Somers' wheel in Atlantic City prior to designing his wheel for the World's Columbian Exposition. In 1893 Somers {{filed a lawsuit against}} Ferris for patent infringement, however Ferris and his lawyers successfully argued that <b>the</b> <b>Ferris</b> <b>Wheel</b> and its technology differed greatly from Somers' wheel, and the case was dismissed.|$|E

2500|$|Although Hunt {{indicates}} {{that she had}} no great musical talent, she worked as a singer for 18 months after arriving in England. In February 1967, Hunt took a singing job with Alexis Korner's trio [...] "Free at Last" [...] so that she could earn her fare back home. She did not use it, but remained, and in 1968, joined the group <b>The</b> <b>Ferris</b> <b>Wheel.</b> That same year, Hunt achieved national fame in England when she appeared as [...] "Dionne" [...] in the rock musical Hair, a box-office smash on the London stage. Hunt only had two lines of dialogue in Hair, but she attracted a lot of media attention and her photo appeared in many newspapers and magazines. Her photograph was used on the poster and playbill of the original London production, photographed by Justin de Villeneuve. Hunt says that the role was a perfect fit for her, expressing who she actually was. She was one of three Americans featured in the London show, and when the show began she had no contract to perform. When the show opened she was featured in so many stories that she was offered a contract right away.|$|E
