Davis stated that the high-speed gameplay was [...] "incredibly engaging" [...] and artistic on both a visual and technical level. A reviewer of GamePro enjoyed the idea of using different ships in races and also praised the game's online multiplayer, stating that it [...] "adds a whole new dynamic to the game". O'Donnell cited the developer's intention of blending ulta-fast gameplay as [...] "clever". In addition, O'Donnell acknowledged that Sony Studio Liverpool [...] "learned from their mistakes" [...] from the poor gameplay of its predecessor, Wipeout Fusion, and created what O'Donnell considered as [...] "the most polished futuristic racer to ever hit the market". Chang similarly opinionated that the previous instalment was [...] "obtuse" [...] and did not present a positive experience to the Wipeout franchise, however he agreed that Wipeout Pure resulted in becoming an [...] "extremely polished" [...] and playable futuristic racing game, further adding that the developers <b>trimmed</b> <b>off</b> elements that were considered ineffective in previous games. A reviewer of Edge praised the game's different modes as dynamic and vicious, stating that the game delivers an [...] "absolute" [...] sense of control. Kelly considered the online multiplayer [...] "superbly executed" [...] and the large amount of weapons in the game well-designed.|$|E
2500|$|The {{internal}} {{volume of}} the cartridge case, or case capacity, significantly affects the pressure developed during ignition, which significantly affects the velocity of the bullet. [...] Cases from different manufacturers can vary in wall thickness, and as cases are repeatedly fired and reloaded the brass flows up to the neck and is <b>trimmed</b> <b>off,</b> increasing capacity as well as weakening the case. [...] The first step to ensuring consistent case capacity is sorting the cases by headstamp, so each lot of cases is from the same manufacturer and/or year. [...] A further step would be to then weigh these cases, and sort by case weight.|$|E
2500|$|This {{technique}} involves selective {{removal of}} leaves (for most varieties of deciduous tree) or needles (for coniferous trees and some others) from a bonsai's branches. A common aesthetic technique in bonsai design is {{to expose the}} tree's branches below groups of leaves or needles (sometimes called [...] "pads") by removing downward-growing material. In many species, particularly coniferous ones, this means that leaves or needles projecting below their branches must be <b>trimmed</b> <b>off.</b> For some coniferous varieties, such as spruce, branches carry needles from the trunk to the tip {{and many of these}} needles may be trimmed to expose the branch shape and bark. Needle and bud trimming can also be used in coniferous trees to force back-budding on old wood, which may not occur naturally in many conifers. Along with pruning, leaf trimming is the most common activity used for bonsai development and maintenance, and the one that occurs most frequently during the year.|$|E

If the ramp is outside the hall, the doors will need the bottoms <b>trimmed</b> <b>off</b> (easing) and their height will therefore be reduced. Ramps can have a 1:12 incline at most, and they may also need a safety zone around them. Thus if the floor is 5cm deep, the ramp should be [...] long or more. The underfloor {{needs to be made}} flat either with levelling cement, very careful trowelling, or by using shims and a layer of masonite. Any new cement must be allowed to dry for at least a month. A membrane vapour barrier should be used to prevent moisture from the ground.|$|E
2500|$|In 2014, {{the mass}} media renewed long-dormant public {{attention}} to the 1955 theft of an even more spectacular Jenny specimen. [...] This was a block of four (positions 65, 66, 75, 76) with a vertical red guide-line through its center, owned by the collector Ethel McCoy, which {{was stolen from a}} stamp show at a Norfolk hotel where it was being exhibited. [...] The top right stamp from this block has never been found; the two left stamps surfaced in the 1970s as single copies offered in auction catalogues and were recovered by the FBI, although they had been camouflaged by minor mutilation: the portions of the right-edge perforations on which parts of the guide line were originally visible had been <b>trimmed</b> <b>off</b> or abraded to remove the red ink. [...] Mrs. McCoy’s will had made the American Philatelic Research Library the legal owner of all four stamps in the block. [...] In 2014 Donald Sundman of the Mystic Stamp Company offered $100,000 in reward money—$50,000 for the two stamps that were still missing—to anyone who could bring them to their rightful owner.

60|$|So saying, he {{took out}} his knife, and cut down a small, slender maple, which was growing near him, and <b>trimmed</b> <b>off</b> the top and the few little {{branches}} which were growing near the top.

60|$|Alarmed {{more than}} they cared to mention, both boys {{prepared}} {{to return to the}} Inn without delay. They selected a slender sapling and cut it down with a hunting knife Shep carried.

60|$|Now Jonas {{approved}} it very much, but {{told him that}} he had better smooth it a little more with his knife before sawing it off.

60|$|The {{man who is}} {{apparently}} squaring a stone, {{and the one who}} is smoothing or <b>trimming</b> <b>off</b> some bricks, are using very peculiar chopping tools.

60|$|The {{prospector}} made {{a little}} grave sign of agreement, for this was a game {{to which he was}} more or less accustomed. Lode ore now and then is of somewhat uniform quality, but at times it varies in richness in a rather striking manner; and the storekeeper had spent six or seven hours picking out the most promising specimens. From these he had <b>trimmed</b> <b>off</b> every fragment in which, {{as far as he could}} discern, the precious metal was not present, with the result that any mineralogist to whom they might be handed could certify to the richness of the Grenfell Consolidated. Saunders was a business man, and quite aware that the vendor of any kind of goods, when asked for samples, does not, as a rule, submit indifferent ones.|$|E
60|$|The {{division}} of labor was excellent. Each knew what he must do. With one ax Daylight chopped down the dead pine. Kama, with a snowshoe and the other ax, cleared away the two feet of snow above the Yukon ice and chopped a supply of ice for cooking purposes. A piece of dry birch bark started the fire, and Daylight went ahead with the cooking while the Indian unloaded the sled and fed the dogs their ration of dried fish. The food sacks he slung high in the trees beyond leaping-reach of the huskies. Next, he chopped down a young spruce tree and <b>trimmed</b> <b>off</b> the boughs. Close to the fire he trampled down the soft snow and covered the packed space with the boughs. On this flooring he tossed his own and Daylight's gear-bags, containing dry socks and underwear and their sleeping-robes. Kama, however, had two robes of rabbit skin to Daylight's one.|$|E
60|$|There was {{a curious}} covered walk along {{on one side}} of this lawn. It was a walk covered with foliage. It was walled in on the sides, too, as well as covered above with the foliage. Two hedges had been planted, one on each side; and as they had grown, the leaves and {{branches}} had been <b>trimmed</b> <b>off</b> straight and smooth like a wall. Then the tops had been trained to meet overhead, and the foliage had been trimmed square and flat on the upper side, and in an arch on the under side. So dense was the growth of the leaves and branches that the whole alley was closely and completely enclosed, so that {{it would not have been}} possible to look out of it at all, had it not been that a row of square openings like windows had been made on the side towards the lake. Any one could look out and view the scenery through these openings as he walked along.|$|E

60|$|Just {{as soon as}} {{they were}} down, he would <b>trim</b> <b>off</b> the {{branches}} until the trees where just long poles.

And when they stretched the line over to Hetertown, they came to me and told me how the line ran along the road most of the way, but that they could save {{a lot of time and}} money (though I don't see how they could save much of a lot of money when, accordin' to all accounts, the whole line didn't cost much, bein' just fastened to pine-trees, <b>trimmed</b> <b>off,</b> and if it had cost much, them boys couldn't have built it, for I reckon the mica people didn't help 'em a great deal, after all) if I would let them cut across my grounds with their wire, and I hadn't no objection, anyway, for the line didn't do no harm up there in the air, and so I said certainly they might, and they did, and there it is." ...|$|E
60|$|And there I {{must leave}} {{the matter to}} such choice as your nature allows you. The honest teacher who has to make known to a novice the facts about Christianity cannot in any {{essential}} regard, I think, put the facts otherwise than as I have put them. If children are to be delivered from the proselytizing atheist on the one hand, and the proselytizing nun in the convent school on the other, {{with all the other}} proselytizers that lie between them, they must not be burdened with idle controversies as to whether there was ever such a person as Jesus or not. When Hume said that Joshua's campaigns were impossible, Whately did not wrangle about it: he proved, on the same lines, that the campaigns of Napoleon were impossible. Only fictitious characters will stand Hume's sort of examination: nothing will ever make Edward the Confessor and St. Louis as real to us as Don Quixote and Mr. Pickwick. We must cut the controversy short by declaring that there is the same evidence for the existence of Jesus as for that of any other person of his time; {{and the fact that you}} may not believe everything Matthew tells you no more disproves the existence of Jesus than the fact that you do not believe everything Macaulay tells you disproves the existence of William III. The gospel narratives in the main give you a biography which is quite credible and accountable on purely secular grounds when you have <b>trimmed</b> <b>off</b> everything that Hume or Grimm or Rousseau or Huxley or any modern bishop could reject as fanciful. Without going further than this, you can become a follower of Jesus just as you can become a follower of Confucius or Lao Tse, and may therefore call yourself a Jesuist, or even a Christian, if you hold, as the strictest Secularist quite legitimately may, that all prophets are inspired, and all men with a mission, Christs.|$|E
6000|$|So it is, {{you would}} find, with every weed {{in the little}} cleared dell, some fifteen feet deep, beyond the gravel. You could not--I {{certainly}} cannot--guess at the name, seldom at the family, of a single plant. But I am going on too fast. What are those sticks of wood which keep the gravel bank up? Veritable bamboos; and a bamboo-pipe, too, is carrying the trickling cool water into the bath close by. Surely {{we are in the}} Tropics. You hear a sudden rattle, as of boards and brown paper, overhead, and find that it is the clashing of the huge leaves of a young fan palm, {78a} growing not ten feet from the window. It has no stem as yet; and the lower leaves have to be <b>trimmed</b> <b>off</b> or they would close up the path, so that only the great forked green butts of them are left, bound to each other by natural matting: but overhead they range out nobly in leafstalks ten feet long, and fans full twelve feet broad; and this is but a baby, a three years' old thing. Surely, again, we are in the Tropics. Ten feet farther, thrust all awry by the huge palm leaves, grows a young tree, unknown to me, looking like a walnut. [...] Next to it an orange, covered with long prickles and small green fruit, its roots propped up by a semi-cylindrical balk of timber, furry inside, which would puzzle a Hampshire woodsman; for it is, plainly, a groo-groo or a coco-palm, split down the middle. Surely, again, we are in the Tropics. Beyond it, again, blaze great orange and yellow flowers, with long stamens, and pistil curving upwards out of them. They belong to a twining, scrambling bush, with finely-pinnated mimosa leaves. That is the 'Flower-fence,' {78b} so often heard of in past years; and round it hurries to and fro a great orange butterfly, larger seemingly than any English kind. [...] Next to it is a row of Hibiscus shrubs, with broad crimson flowers; then a row of young Screw-pines, {78c} from the East Indian Islands, like spiral pine-apple plants twenty feet high standing on stilts. [...] Yes: surely we are in the Tropics. Over the low roof (for the cottage is all of one storey) of purple and brown and white shingles, baking in the sun, rises a tall tree, which looks (as so many do here) like a walnut, but is not one. It is the 'Poui' of the Indians, {78d} and will be covered shortly with brilliant saffron flowers.|$|E

50|$|In direct coupled OTL designs, {{both the}} {{necessary}} blocking of DC and matching of impedances are accomplished, respectively, through the topology of the amplifier's output section and {{the selection of}} vacuum tube types with sufficiently low impedance to allow effective power transfer to the loudspeaker.

50|$|One {{school of}} thought is to make as many {{connections}} as possible without adding extra wire.
