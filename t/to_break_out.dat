5|$|In January Manstein {{was forced}} to retreat further west by the Soviet offensive. Without waiting for {{permission}} from Hitler, he ordered the German XI and XXXXII Corps (consisting of 56,000 men in six divisions) of Army Group South <b>to</b> <b>break</b> <b>out</b> of the Korsun Pocket during the night of 16–17 February 1944. By the beginning of March, the Soviet forces had driven the Wehrmacht well back of the river. Because of Hitler's directive of 19 March that from that point forward all positions were to be defended to the last man, Manstein's 1st Panzer Army became encircled on 21 March when permission <b>to</b> <b>break</b> <b>out</b> was not received from Hitler in time. Manstein flew to Hitler's headquarters in Lvov {{to try to convince}} him to change his mind. Hitler eventually relented, but relieved Manstein of his command on 30 March 1944.|$|E

5|$|Declassified wartime {{documents}} show that Simonds, {{along with several}} others in the Allied high command, had likely been notified on July 23 of a massive German buildup on the ridge. Some historians, including David O'Keefe and David Bercuson, accused Simonds of being careless with {{the lives of his}} men. Terry Copp and John A. English, wrote that given the amount of pressure that all Allied commanders were under <b>to</b> <b>break</b> <b>out</b> from Normandy, Simonds probably had little choice in the decision he made.|$|E
5|$|Following this, No. 6 Commando {{were used}} in the defence of the beachhead and the {{subsequent}} operations <b>to</b> <b>break</b> <b>out</b> from Normandy before being withdrawn {{with the rest of the}} brigade back to the United Kingdom in September 1944.

With the end of hostilities, the unit was disbanded in 1946.|$|E
5|$|Historians hold differing {{views as}} to whether the mounted police were neutral in these {{disputes}} or sided with the employers, although all agree that the position of the police in managing the strikes became more difficult as organised labour became better established. The mounted police disliked labour agitators and strikers with eastern or southern European backgrounds, but they also had some sympathy for the difficulties faced by ordinary workers, and were often unwilling to actively assist the company owners if there was a risk it might cause disturbances <b>to</b> <b>break</b> <b>out.</b>|$|E

5|$|On 18 May, the {{situation}} worsened and Stavka suggested once more stopping the offensive and ordering the 9th Army <b>to</b> <b>break</b> <b>out</b> of the salient. Timoshenko and Khruschev {{claimed that the}} danger coming from Wehrmacht's Kramatorsk group was exaggerated, and Stalin refused the withdrawal again. The consequences of losing the air battle were also apparent. On 18 May the Fliegerkorps VI destroyed 130 tanks and 500 motor vehicles, while adding another 29 tanks destroyed on 19 May.|$|E
5|$|On April 1 Army Group B {{found itself}} {{completely}} surrounded in the Ruhr by the U.S. First and Ninth Armies. Hitler's {{response was to}} declare the Ruhr a fortress, from which he commanded that {{there was to be}} no surrender or attempt <b>to</b> <b>break</b> <b>out,</b> in an order similar to that which he had issued at Stalingrad. He further ordered that its physical economic infrastructure – the heart of Germany's industrial power – be destroyed by Army Group B to prevent it falling into Allied hands. Model ignored these instructions.|$|E

The battle was part of the British and Canadian attempts <b>to</b> <b>break</b> <b>out</b> of Caen, and took place from 19–25 July 1944, being part of both Operation Atlantic (18–21 July) and Operation Spring (25–27 July).|$|E
5|$|The Great Recession and {{the turmoil}} {{caused by the}} Arab Spring have {{depressed}} Jordan's GDP growth, damaging trade, industry, construction and tourism. Tourist arrivals have dropped sharply since 2011. Jordan's finances have also been severely strained by 32 attacks on the natural gas pipeline in Sinai supplying Jordan from Egypt by Islamic State affiliates, causing it to substitute more expensive heavy-fuel oils to generate electricity. In November 2012, the government cut subsidies on fuel, increasing its price. The decision, which was later revoked, caused large scale protests <b>to</b> <b>break</b> <b>out</b> across the country.|$|E
5|$|The Saudi and Kuwaiti units renewed {{operations}} {{the following}} day. Two Iraqi companies, with about 20 armored vehicles, {{remained in the}} city and had not attempted <b>to</b> <b>break</b> <b>out</b> during the night. While the Saudi 8th Battalion continued operations in the southern portion of the city, the 7th Battalion began to clear the northern sector of the city. Iraqi resistance was sporadic and most Iraqi soldiers surrendered on sight; as a result, the city was recaptured on 1 February 1991.|$|E

50|$|In Sant Mat {{the word}} Simran {{is used for}} the spiritual {{practice}} of repeating the mantra given by the Satguru during initiation. The mantra itself is also called Simran. Simran repetition is done during meditation and also outside it, however this mantra is later dropped in favor of real feeling of self or the God, which happens due <b>to</b> <b>breaking</b> <b>out</b> of monotony through Jap. Thus mantra is used only till the point, monotony and previously formed patterns are broken. After it pure Simran is carried by the sadhak.|$|R
5|$|The game's protagonist is Richard B. Riddick (reprised by Vin Diesel), {{a murderer}} {{recently}} confined in Butcher Bay.

Johns (Cole Hauser); the two have had previous encounters. Butcher Bay's warden is a man named Hoxie (Dwight Schultz), while Abbott (Xzibit) is a prison guard disliked by the inmates. The inmate Pope Joe (Willis Burks II) is an insane old man, {{who lives in the}} sewer tunnels beneath the prison.|$|E
5|$|The garrison's defences were {{supported}} with artillery fire from a Royalist warship that was deliberately run aground {{north of the}} castle to produce an additional gun platform. By July, food had begun to run short {{and some of the}} garrison unsuccessfully attempted <b>to</b> <b>break</b> <b>out</b> by sea to acquire supplies. Arundell agreed to an honourable surrender on 15 August, and around 900 survivors left the fort two days later, some terminally ill from malnutrition. Pendennis was the penultimate Royalist fortification to hold out in the war.|$|E
5|$|Uneven heating {{can cause}} newly {{generated}} gases <b>to</b> <b>break</b> <b>out</b> of a weak {{spot on the}} surface of comet's nucleus, like a geyser. These streams of gas and dust can cause the nucleus to spin, and even split apart. In 2010 it was revealed dry ice (frozen carbon dioxide) can power jets of material flowing out of a comet nucleus. Infrared imaging of Hartley 2 shows such jets exiting and carrying with it dust grains into the coma.|$|E
