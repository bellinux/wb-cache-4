30|$|To {{facilitate}} quantification of the data, {{the construction}} of the responses was based on Likert-scale (Rossouw et al. 2011). <b>The</b> <b>scoring</b> of <b>the</b> responses was done by assigning to “Strongly Agree, Agree, Undecided, Disagree, and Strongly Disagree” <b>the</b> <b>scores</b> 5, 4, 3, 2, and 1, respectively, for a positive answer to a positive item and <b>the</b> <b>scores</b> 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, respectively, for a negative answer to a negative item. <b>The</b> <b>scores</b> for each question were then summed for the sections B, C, and D of the questionnaire. Finally, <b>the</b> overall <b>score</b> that is <b>the</b> sum of <b>the</b> <b>scores</b> obtained in <b>the</b> sections B, C, and D for each subject was worked out. The sum of <b>the</b> <b>scores</b> for each individual respondent represented the positivity of the awareness, the concern or the consideration, or the perception or the experience of the subject. After <b>the</b> <b>scoring</b> of <b>the</b> responses, in order to facilitate comparisons of <b>the</b> group <b>scores,</b> arithmetic means and corresponding standard deviations were computed.|$|R

5|$|Six {{weeks from}} {{theatrical}} release, no dubbing {{had taken place}} and <b>the</b> <b>score</b> had not been written as Horner was unable to view the completed film. The final cue for the scene in which Ripley battles the alien queen was written overnight. Cameron completely reworked the scene, leaving Horner to rewrite the music. As Gale Hurd {{did not have much}} music production experience, she and Cameron denied Horner's request to push the film back four weeks so he could finish <b>the</b> <b>score.</b> Horner felt that, given more time, he could get <b>the</b> <b>score</b> to 100% of his satisfaction rather than the 80% he estimated {{he had been able to}} achieve. <b>The</b> <b>score</b> was recorded in roughly four days. Despite his troubles, Horner received an Academy Award nomination (his first) for Best Original Score.|$|E
