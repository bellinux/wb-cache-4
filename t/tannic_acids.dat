30|$|Polyelectrolyte {{titration}} using {{a fluorescent}} indicator {{was applied to}} determine the electrolytic charges in 10 whiskies at various pH levels. <b>Tannic</b> <b>acid</b> was also titrated to compare the relation between pH and charge because the polyelectrolytes in whisky were postulated to be polyphenols, mainly <b>tannic</b> <b>acid,</b> which are gradually extracted from a wood cask over the years. Below pH 7, the pH-charge curves for whisky were analogous to those for <b>tannic</b> <b>acid,</b> indicating that carboxyl groups in <b>tannic</b> <b>acid</b> were fairly stable on maturation of the whisky. The charge of the <b>tannic</b> <b>acid</b> increased with increasing pH, whereas that of whisky {{had a tendency to}} level off. The degree of leveling off was higher for whiskies with longer maturation.

50|$|Bog ore is a {{renewable}} resource when mined and utilized with care. It is produced when rain water leaches out humic and <b>tannic</b> <b>acids</b> and reacts with carbon dioxide, which is produced {{as a part}} of the natural life-cycle of microorganisms in the soil.

This iron carbonate then combines with the surface soil and, over time, hardens into a solid mass. This process only takes about 25 to 35 years, making it an ideal, almost perpetual resource for industry but only if treated with respect.

Excellent examples of such human specimens are Haraldskær Woman and Tollund Man in Denmark, and Lindow man found at Lindow Common in England. At Céide Fields in County Mayo in Ireland, a 5,000-year-old neolithic farming landscape has been found preserved under a blanket bog, complete with field walls and hut sites.

30|$|The {{capability}} of microorganisms to degrade tannins has been featured {{to the construction}} of tannase, an important enzyme able of catalyzing gallotannins to gallic acid and glucose (Ilori et al. 2007; Beniwal et al. 2013). In Bacillus sphaericus, with the increase of <b>tannic</b> <b>acid</b> tannase production increases i.e. <b>tannic</b> <b>acid</b> degradation increases (Raghuwanshi et al. 2011). A. niger strains were able to grow in a high concentration of <b>tannic</b> <b>acid</b> (10 %). The highest tannase production by A. niger was occurred at 5 % <b>tannic</b> <b>acid</b> and response surface plots suggested that even more tannase production could be obtained when increasing the <b>tannic</b> <b>acid</b> concentration. The {{results of the present study}} are in accordance with the previous report of Rodriguez-Duran et al. (2011). Sharma et al.

Tannins have a property to form complexes with fungal or bacterial exozymes, this is how tannins slow down the biodegradation process.

Less than 10 % of the <b>tannic</b> <b>acid</b> ingested by O. leucostigma was hydrolysed to gallic acid when measured with the rhodanine assay, and virtually all <b>tannic</b> <b>acid</b> was recovered in the frass when measured as total phenolics or with HPLC. (2) Peritrophic membranes were freely permeable to gallic acid but were impermeable to the higher molecular weight polyphenolic components of <b>tannic</b> <b>acid.</b> (3) Peritrophic membranes adsorbed less than 1 % {{of the amount of}} <b>tannic</b> <b>acid</b> present in the guts of O. leucostigma larvae in vivo. Therefore, adsorption is not the means by which tannins are contained within the endoperitrophic space in O. leucostigma. We conclude that the peritrophic membrane acts as an ultrafilter.

Degree of <b>tannic</b> <b>acid</b> incorporation into gelatin via non-covalent interaction was more pronounced than that found via covalent interaction as evidenced by lowered free amino group content and increased total phenolic content and hydroxyl group and aromatic ring determined by FTIR. Gelatin modified with oxidized <b>tannic</b> <b>acid</b> had the slight decrease in surface hydrophobicity, with no changes in particle size distribution of the emulsions. Modification of gelatin with <b>tannic</b> <b>acid,</b> especially via non-covalent interaction, increased in vitro antioxidative activity, compared with the control gelatin.

Montmorillonite (< 2. 0 t~m) was aged for three months at an initial pH of 5. 0 or 6. 0 in A 1 C 13 solutions containing citric or tannic acid at organic acid/A 1 molar ratios from 0 to 1. 0. The A 1 /clay ratio in the system was 900 meq AP+/ 100 g of montmorillonite. Ion-exchange experiments revealed that organically complexed A 1 ions have {{both positive and negative}} charges. Evidence from X-ray powder diffraction, electron microscopic examination, measurements of pecific surface, cation-exchange capacity, organic arbon, and the nature of sorbed A 1 indicates that citric and <b>tannic</b> <b>acids</b> influence differently the hydroxy-A 1 interlayer formation in montmorillonite. Hydroxy-Al-citrate can be adsorbed as interlayers in montmorillonite, but hydroxy-Al-tannate exists principally as a separate phase binding the clay particles.

30|$|Iron-gall inks {{have been}} {{described}} as complexes of iron ions with gallic or <b>tannic</b> <b>acids,</b> available in gall extracts. To assess this working hypothesis, we have prepared medieval inks using ingredients and methods appropriate to the fifteenth to seventeenth centuries. The five historical inks studied were selected based upon research into Iberian written sources of medieval techniques. Results are supported by comparison with iron complexes with a well-characterized phenol counterpart: gallic, ellagic, and <b>tannic</b> <b>acids</b> as well as digalloyl and pentagalloyl glucose; as either precipitates or prepared as inks by adding gum arabic. Raman and infrared spectroscopies show that medieval writing inks could not have been represented solely by iron complexes with gallic acid. Overall, writing inks display the infrared signature of gallotannins, indicating that complexes of Fe 3 +-polygalloyl esters of glucose are also formed. Our results also show that the commercial tannic acid solution is far more complex than the gall extracts, and cannot be used to represent a gall extract (as described in historic written sources). High-performance liquid chromatography–electrospray ionisation, HPLC–ESI–MS, reveals that the concentration of gallic acid varies in the gall extracts, depending on the extraction method and ink recipe. Importantly, in certain recipes, gallic acid is found as a minor compound, when compared with the galloyl esters of glucose.|$|E

This method could be applied to measurement of other hydrolysable tannins and their phenolic metabolites in bioligical materials...|$|R
