Less common are oscilloscopes with more traces; four inputs are common among these, but a few (Kikusui, for one) offered a display of the sweep trigger signal if desired. Some multi-trace oscilloscopes use the external <b>trigger</b> <b>input</b> as an optional vertical input, and some have third and fourth channels with only minimal controls. In all cases, the inputs, when independently displayed, are time-multiplexed, but dual-trace oscilloscopes often can add their inputs to display a real-time analog sum. (Inverting one channel provides a difference, provided that neither channel is overloaded. This difference mode can provide a moderate-performance differential input.) ...|$|E

2500|$|Most {{electronic}} drum modules {{come with}} a number of pre-programmed [...] "kits" [...] or [...] "sets" [...] - collections of drum kit voices assigned to specific triggers which emulate a traditional drum set (e.g., including drum and cymbal sounds). Many modules allow the player to save their own collections of sounds as additional kits and allow the player to recall them as desired. In effect, a single set of triggers may serve the same function as several traditional drum sets or collections of miscellaneous percussion instruments. Some modules may allow kits to be saved with labels such as: [...] "rock kit", [...] "jazz kit", and [...] "hip-hop kit." [...] Others simply assign a number to each saved kit. Modules may allow varying degrees of control over individual sounds such as the relative volume of each <b>trigger</b> <b>input</b> or add electronic effects such as reverb or other effects.|$|E
2500|$|Base {{triggering}} input circuit: {{the input}} trigger signal is fed {{directly to the}} base via a fast switching diode , possibly after being shaped by a pulse shaping network. This way of driving an avalanche transistor was relatively less employed in first generation circuits because the base node has a relatively low impedance and an input capacitance [...] which is highly nonlinear (as a matter of fact, it is exponential) under the large signal regime: this causes a fairly large, input voltage dependent, delay time, which was analyzed in detail in the paper [...] However, the required inverse voltage for the feed diode is far lower respect diodes {{to be used in}} collectior <b>trigger</b> <b>input</b> circuits, and since ultra fast Schottky diodes are easily and cheaply found, this is the driver circuit employed in most modern avalanche transistor circuit. This is also the reason why the diode [...] in the following applicative circuits is symbolized as a Schottky diode.|$|E

5000|$|One {{application}} of a Schmitt trigger {{is to increase the}} noise immunity in a circuit with only a single input threshold. With only one input threshold, a noisy input signal [...] near that threshold could cause the output to switch rapidly back and forth from noise alone. A noisy Schmitt <b>Trigger</b> <b>input</b> signal near one threshold can cause only one switch in output value, after which it would have to move beyond the other threshold in order to cause another switch.|$|E
40|$|Hardware Trojans (HTs) {{implemented}} by adversaries serve as backdoors to subvert or augment the normal operation of infected devices, which {{may lead to}} functionality changes, sensitive information leakages, or Denial of Service attacks. To tackle such threats, this paper proposes a novel verification technique for hardware trust, namely VeriTrust, which facilitates to detect HTs inserted at design stage. Based on the observation that HTs are usually activated by dedicated <b>trigger</b> <b>inputs</b> that are not sensitized with verification test cases, VeriTrust automatically identifies such potential HT <b>trigger</b> <b>inputs</b> by examining verification corners. The key difference between VeriTrust and existing HT detection techniques is that VeriTrust is insensitive to the implementation style of HTs. Experimental results show that VeriTrust is able to detect all HTs evaluated in this paper (constructed based on various HT design methodologies shown in the literature) {{at the cost of}} moderate extra verification time, which is not possible with existing solutions. 1...|$|R

50|$|To date, Antics {{software}} had {{all been}} implemented using the 'Fortran' language, and current platforms used the 'Unix' operating system.

The previous Antics approach was not compatible with this new design philosophy, and the Autumn 98 Edition was the last Unix/Fortran edition to be supported, as older platforms gradually became obsolete.|$|E

50|$|Although the {{describing}} function method can produce reasonably accurate results {{for a wide}} class of systems, it can fail badly for others. For example, the method can fail if the system emphasizes higher harmonics of the nonlinearity. Such examples have been presented by Tzypkin for bang - bang systems. A fairly similar example is a closed-loop oscillator consisting of a non-inverting Schmitt trigger followed by an inverting integrator that feeds back its output to the Schmitt <b>trigger's</b> <b>input.</b> The output of the Schmitt trigger {{is going to be}} a square waveform, while that of the integrator (following it) is going to have a triangle waveform with peaks coinciding with the transitions in the square wave. Each of these two oscillator stages lags the signal exactly by 90 degrees (relative to its input). If one were to perform DF analysis on this circuit, the triangle wave at the Schmitt <b>trigger's</b> <b>input</b> would be replaced by its fundamental (sine wave), which passing through the trigger would cause a phase shift of less than 90 degrees (because the sine wave would trigger it sooner than the triangle wave does) so the system would appear not to oscillate in the same (simple) way.|$|R
