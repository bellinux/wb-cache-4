25|$|According to Rabbi David Kimchi (1160–1235), in his {{commentary}} on Obadiah 1:20, Ṣarfat and Sepharad, both, {{refer to the}} Jewish captivity (Heb. galut) expelled during the war with Titus and who {{went as far as}} the countries Alemania (Germany), Escalona, France and Spain. The names Ṣarfat and Sepharad are explicitly mentioned by him as being France and Spain, respectively. Some scholars <b>think</b> <b>that,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> case of the place-name, Ṣarfat (lit. Ṣarfend) – which, as noted, was applied to the Jewish Diaspora in France, the association with France was made only exegetically because of its similarity in spelling with the name פרנצא (France), by a reversal of its letters.|$|E

He encouraged the search for promising young cricketers, {{and most of the}} club's professional cricketers during its successful years in the 1930s were discovered during Gilligan's drive for new talent. Percy Fender believed that Gilligan allowed the team's professionals a greater say in Sussex's affairs than previously permitted. Fender wrote that Gilligan's teams enjoyed playing under him and that Gilligan {{was one of the most}} popular captains in county cricket. Cricket writer R. C. Robertson-Glasgow said: [...] "With him there was no sharpnesses, no petty restraints, no mathematical cricket. He won or lost plumb straight". Swanton wrote that [...] "Gilligan was essentially a friendly man, hail-fellow-well-met, and it is hard to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world of sport he ever made an enemy." ...|$|E

[...] This change, according to Buchanan, [...] "was possibly precipitated by the coming of tabernacles for reservation, which were ideally both to occupy a central position and also to be fixed to the east wall without the president turning his back to them." ...|$|E

40|$|O artigo examina a agenda de longo prazo da Igreja Católica, à luz do Concílio do Vaticano II (1962 - 1965), evento histórico que procurou adequar a instituição aos desafios da modernidade. Apesar dos avanços conciliares, o autor entende que nos últimos quarenta anos houve um aprofundamento do descompasso entre a missão "externa" da Igreja, que tem, pelo menos parcialmente, reconhecido os valores modernos, e o déficit democrático de suas estruturas e práticas internas.

This will make the corresponding Ga atom see insufficient N counterpart, as can be inferred from the XPS Ga 3 d spectrum.
