We derive analytical expressions for the correlation functions of the Euler angles, for the real space two–point correlation functions and for the probability distribution of writhe, {{as a function of the}} persistence lengths that determine the rigidity with respect to bending and <b>twist.</b> <b>Fluctuation</b> amplitudes diverge in the limit of vanishing twist rigidity. There is crossover from a small scale regime in which twist and writhe modes are uncoupled, to a large scale regime in which twist affects the spatial configurations of the ring. Small circular loops of extrachromosomal DNA (plasmids) play an important role in biological processes such as gene transfer between bacteria and in biothechnological applications where they are used as vectors for DNA cloning 3. The simplest model that captures both the topology and the physical properties of such an object is that of an elastic ring, and several studies of the writhing instability of twisted rings based on this model, were reported in recent years 4, 5. However, these studies focused on the elastic response of the ring to mechanica...|$|E
40|$|We analyse the Rayleigh light {{scattered}} from thermally excited <b>twist</b> <b>fluctuations</b> {{above the}} weakly first order smectic-A to nematic transition in octyloxycyanobiphenyl. In {{presence of an}} A. C. stabilizing electric field the twist-damping time allows absolute measurements of the twist viscosity γl. We observe the divergence of γ 1 up to 1 mK above the transition temperature. This critical enhancement {{seems to be more}} compatible with a mean field model than with the heliumlike predictions. This conclusion is consistent with the direct observation of the lifetime and intensity of the <b>twist</b> <b>fluctuations,</b> in absence of electric field quenching...|$|R
40|$|We present {{observations}} on electrohydrodynamic instabilities in materials {{for which the}} Helfrich parameter ζ 2 is strongly temperature dependent. For ζ 2 decreasing to one, the threshold voltage of the conduction regime diverges, and both dielectric and conduction regimes disappear for ζ 2 = 1, as predicted by the theoretical models. For ζ 2 < 1, we still observe instabilities, which are interpreted in terms of amplificated <b>twist</b> <b>fluctuations.</b> Such an amplification can occur for positive values of the friction coefficient α 3, and electrical conductivities ratio σ||/σ⊥ smaller than one...|$|R
40|$|Restricted Access. Recently we {{reported}} {{the occurrence of}} the re-entrant nematic phase in three pure compounds at atmospheric pressure: (i) trans-p-n-decyloxy-a-methyl-p'- cyanophenyl cinnamate (10 OMCPC), (ii) 4 -cyanophenyl- 3 -methyl- 4 (4 -n-undecyl- benzoyloxy) benzoate (11 CPMBB) and (iii) 4 -cyanophenyi- 3 -methyl- 4 (4 -n-dodecyl- benzoy loxy) benzoate (12 CPMBB). We have now studied the light scattering arising from <b>twist</b> <b>fluctuations</b> {{as a function of}} temperature in these compounds which again confirms the formation of the re-entrant nematic phase. We also present in this paper, phase diagrams of binary mixtures involving these compounds. In addition, we have determined the orientational order parameter in the nematic, smectic A and re-entrant nematic phases using (a) infrared dichroic studies on homeotropically aligned samples, and (b) optical birefringence studies again on homeotropically aligned samples employing a new technique...|$|R
40|$|We {{extend to}} twisted {{spectral}} triples the fluctuations of the metric, {{as well as}} their gauge transformations. The former are bounded perturbations of the Dirac operator that arise when a spectral triple is exported between Morita equivalent algebras; the later are obtained by the action of the unitary endomorphisms of the module implementing the Morita equivalence. It is shown that the twisted gauged Dirac operators, previously introduced to generate an extra scalar field in the spectral description of the standard model of elementary particles, in fact follow from Morita equivalence between twisted spectral triples. The law of transformation of the gauge potentials turns out to be twisted in a natural way. In contrast with the non-twisted case, <b>twisted</b> <b>fluctuations</b> do not necessarily preserve the self-adjointness of the Dirac operator. For a self-Morita equivalence, some conditions are obtained in order to maintain self-adjointness, that are solved explicitly for the minimal twist of a Riemannian manifold...|$|R
40|$|A simple {{physical}} model based on statistical thermodynamics is proposed {{to predict the}} DNA sequence dependent propensity to circularization, even {{in the presence of}} bend inducing proteins. Assuming the first order elasticity and an uniform force field in solution, the model requires the evaluation of the ground state energy difference between circular and linear forms as well as the difference of their canonical ensemble average energy on account of curvature and <b>twisting</b> <b>fluctuations.</b> These quantities are analytically obtained using the Parseval equality in the Fourier space and adopting a DNA curvature model previously proposed by us. The circularization propensity as defined by the J factor is obtained in terms of the intrinsic curvature, the persistence length, and the torsional constant. The comparison with the experimental data is very satisfactory in a range of DNA length between 100 and 10000 bp. The model can also be extended to evaluate the sequence dependent energy cost of looping deformation of a DNA tract also in the presence of CAP or other regulatory proteins, repressors, and operators, as in the first step of the transcription mechanism as well as to evaluate "allosteric" effects in protein binding on topologically constrained DNAs...|$|R
40|$|Helical {{molecules}} {{change their}} twist number under {{the effect of}} a mechanical load. We study the twist-stretch relation for a set of short DNA molecules modeled by a mesoscopic Hamiltonian. Finite temperature path integral techniques are applied to generate a large ensemble of possible configurations for the base pairs of the sequence. The model also accounts for the bending and <b>twisting</b> <b>fluctuations</b> between adjacent base pairs along the molecules stack. Simulating a broad range of twisting conformation, we compute the helix structural parameters by averaging over the ensemble of base pairs configurations. The method selects, for any applied force, the average twist angle which minimizes the molecule’s free energy. It is found that the chains generally over-twist under an applied stretching and the over-twisting is physically associated to the contraction of the average helix diameter, i. e. to the damping of the base pair fluctuations. Instead, assuming that the maximum amplitude of the bending fluctuations may decrease against the external load, the DNA molecule first over-twists for weak applied forces and then untwists above a characteristic force value. Our results are discussed in relation to available experimental information albeit for kilo-base long molecules...|$|R
40|$|The Higgs {{field is}} a {{connection}} one-form as the other bosonic fields, provided one describes space no more as a manifold M but as a slightly non-commutative generalization of it. This is well encoded within the theory of spectral triples: all the bosonic fields of the standard model - including the Higgs - are obtained on the same footing, as fluctuations of a generalized Dirac operator by a matrix-value algebra of functions on M. In the commutative case, fluctuations of the usual free Dirac operator by the complex-value algebra A of smooth functions on M vanish, and so do not generate any bosonic field. We show that imposing a twist {{in the sense of}} Connes-Moscovici forces to double the algebra A, but does not require to modify the space of spinors on which it acts. This opens the way to <b>twisted</b> <b>fluctuations</b> of the free Dirac operator, that yield a perturbation of the spin connection. Applied to the standard model, a similar twist yields in addition the extra scalar field needed to stabilize the electroweak vacuum, and to make the computation of the Higgs mass in noncommutative geometry compatible with its experimental value.

40|$|At present, {{there have}} been {{suggested}} two types of physical mechanism that may facilitate preferential pairing between DNA molecules, with identical or similar base pair texts, without separation of base pairs. One solely relies on base pair specific patterns of helix distortion being the same on the two molecules, discussed extensively in the past. The other mechanism proposes that there are preferential interactions between base pairs of the same composition. We introduce a model, built on this second mechanism, where both thermal stretching and <b>twisting</b> <b>fluctuations</b> are included, {{as well as the}} base pair specific helix distortions. Firstly, we consider an approximation for weak pairing interactions, or short molecules. This yields a dependence of the energy on the square root of the molecular length, which could explain recent experimental data. However, analysis suggests that this approximation is no-longer valid at large DNA lengths. In a second approximation, for long molecules, we define two adaptation lengths for twisting and stretching, over which the pairing interaction can limit the accumulation of helix disorder. When the pairing interaction is sufficiently strong, both adaptation lengths are finite; however, as we reduce pairing strength, the stretching adaptation length remains finite but the torsional one becomes infinite. This second state persists to arbitrarily weak values of the pairing strength; suggesting that, if the molecules are long enough, the pairing energy scales as length. To probe differences between the two pairing mechanisms, we also construct a model of similar form. However, now, pairing between identical sequences solely relies on the intrinsic helix distortion patterns. Between the two models, we see interesting qualitative differences. We discuss our findings, and suggest new work to distinguish between the two mechanisms. Comment: Paper 31 pages+ Supplemental Material 54 page...|$|R
40|$|The {{instantaneous}} normal modes {{corresponding to}} base pair vibrations (radial modes) and <b>twist</b> angle <b>fluctuations</b> (angular modes) of a DNA molecule model {{at ambient temperature}} are theoretically investigated. Due to thermal disorder, normal modes are not plane waves with a single wave number q but have a finite and frequency dependent damping width. The density of modes rho(nu), the average dispersion relation nu(q) {{as well as the}} coherence length xi(nu) are analytically calculated. The Gibbs averaged resolvent is computed using a replicated transfer matrix formalism and variational wave functions for the ground and first excited state. Our results for the density of modes are compared to Raman spectroscopy measurements of the collective modes for DNA in solution and show a good agreement with experimental data in the low frequency regime nu < 150 cm^{- 1 }. Radial modes extend over frequencies ranging from 50 cm^{- 1 } to 110 cm^{- 1 }. Angular modes, related to helical axis vibrations are limited to nu < 25 cm^{- 1 }. Normal modes are highly disordered and coherent over a few base pairs only (xi < 2 nm) in good agreement with neutron scattering experiments. Comment: 20 pages + 13 ps figure...|$|R
40|$|The initial {{energy density}} {{distribution}} and fluctuation in the transverse direction lead to anisotropic flows of final hadrons through collective expansion in high-energy heavy-ion collisions. Fluctuations along the longitudinal direction, {{on the other}} hand, can result in decorrelation of anisotropic flows in different regions of pseudo rapidity (η). Decorrelation of the 2 nd and 3 rd order anisotropic flows with different η gaps for final charged hadrons in high-energy heavy-ion collisions is studied in an event-by-event (3 + 1) D ideal hydrodynamic model with fully fluctuating initial conditions from A Multi-Phase Transport (AMPT) model. The decorrelation of anisotropic flows of final hadrons with large η gaps are found to originate from the spatial decorrelation along the longitudinal direction in the AMPT initial conditions through hydrodynamic evolution. The decorrelation is found to consist of both a linear <b>twist</b> and random <b>fluctuation</b> of the event-plane angles. The agreement between our results and recent CMS data in most centralities suggests that the string-like mechanism of initial parton production in AMPT model captures the initial longitudinal fluctuation {{that is responsible for}} the measured decorrelation of anisotropic flows in Pb+Pb collisions at LHC. Our predictions for Au+Au collisions at the highest RHIC energy show stronger longitudinal decorrelation, indicating larger longitudinal fluctuations at lower beam energies. Our study also calls into question some of the current experimental methods for measuring anisotropic flows and extraction of transport coefficients through comparisons to hydrodynamic simulations that do not include longitudinal fluctuations...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{comprehensive}} set of measurements of optical, dielectric, diamagnetic, elastic and viscous {{properties in the}} nematic (N) phase formed by a liquid crystalline dimer. The studied dimer, 1, 7 -bis- 4 -(4 -cyanobiphenyl) heptane (CB 7 CB), is composed of two rigid rod-like cyanobiphenyl segments connected by a flexible aliphatic link with seven methyl groups. CB 7 CB and other nematic dimers are of interest due to their tendency to adopt bent configurations and to form two states possessing a modulated nematic director structure, namely, the twist bend nematic, NTB, and the oblique helicoidal cholesteric, ChOH, which occurs when the achiral dimer is doped with a chiral additive and exposed to an external electric or magnetic field. We characterize the material parameters as functions of temperature in the entire temperature range of the N phase, including the pre-transitional regions near the N-NTB and N-to-isotropic (I) transitions. The splay constant K 11 is determined by two direct and independent techniques, namely, detection of the Frederiks transition and measurement of director fluctuation amplitudes by dynamic light scattering (DLS). The bend K 33 and twist K 22 constants are measured by DLS. K 33 being {{the smallest of the}} three constants, shows a strong non-monotonous temperature dependence with a negative slope in both N-I and N-NTB pretransitional regions. The measured ratio K 11 /K 22 is larger than 2 in the entire nematic temperature range. The orientational viscosities associated with splay, <b>twist</b> and bend <b>fluctuations</b> in the N phase are comparable to those of nematics formed by rod-like molecules. All three show strong temperature dependence, increasing sharply near the N-NTB transition...|$|R
