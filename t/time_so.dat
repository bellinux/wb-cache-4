5|$|A ^ Rob {{was awarded}} the Dickin Medal in 1945 for taking part in more than 20 {{parachute}} drops and for his involvement in operations behind enemy lines in Italy and North Africa during the Second World War. There is evidence that his record is a hoax concocted by the training officer at 2nd SAS at the <b>time</b> <b>so</b> that the dog would remain with the regiment.|$|E

5|$|Excavations for {{construction}} of the building's foundations started in October 1961 and the first concrete pour occurred in November 1961. The building was not completely finished by the time Perth hosted the Commonwealth Games in November 1962, however the builders rushed to finish the ground, eighth, and 10th floors in <b>time</b> <b>so</b> that foreign dignitaries could be entertained in the reception areas.|$|E

5|$|In casting, Nancy Cartwright {{originally}} planned {{to audition for}} the role of Lisa, while Yeardley Smith tried out for Bart. Smith's voice was too high for a boy, so she was given the role of Lisa. Cartwright found that Lisa was not interesting at the <b>time,</b> <b>so</b> instead auditioned for Bart, which she thought was a better role.|$|E
5|$|Jim Reardon {{directed}} the episode and has noted {{he remembers the}} episode for several scenes in which the action is viewed through windows, such as when Homer prank calls the dean. The animators were short on <b>time,</b> <b>so</b> {{for the design of}} Benjamin they took an earlier drawing of director Rich Moore and made it African-American.|$|E
5|$|Triple-doubles in NCAA tournament history: The NCAA began {{keeping track}} of assists for men's {{basketball}} in 1984, then blocks and steals in 1986, so officially this has occurred eight times. However, many tournaments had included assists, steals and blocks in their official boxscores prior to that <b>time,</b> <b>so</b> unofficially this has occurred sixteen times. Only three pre-1986 triple-doubles are included below.|$|E

5|$|A third {{attempt was}} planned for September 13; bad weather delayed {{attempts}} until September 16. However, General Schuyler was by this <b>time</b> <b>so</b> ill {{that he thought}} it necessary to withdraw to Ticonderoga. He left that day, turning full command of the invasion over to Montgomery. Schuyler {{was not the only}} one falling ill; the bad weather, and the swampy, malaria-infested terrain of Île-aux-Noix was also taking a toll on the troops, as more of them became ill as well. The bad news was tempered by good; an additional 250 troops, in the form of a company of Green Mountain Boys under Seth Warner, and another company of New Hampshire men under Colonel Timothy Bedel, arrived at Île-aux-Noix.|$|E
5|$|A {{variation}} of this theory by some present-day residents of Kaliningrad (formerly Königsberg), {{is that at}} least parts of the room {{were found in the}} Königsberg Castle cellars after World War II by the Red Army. The Amber Room was allegedly still in good condition; this was not admitted at the <b>time</b> <b>so</b> the blame could fall upon the Nazis. To preserve this story, access to the ruins of the castle, which was allowed after World War II, was suddenly restricted to all, including historical and archaeological surveys, but the room is said to be in a storehouse near Konigsburg castle.|$|E
5|$|Adolphus Herbert Frederick Norman Appleroth, {{known as}} Bert Appleroth, was a tram {{conductor}} who created jelly crystals using gelatine {{and sugar in}} his bathtub. He sold these jelly crystals door-to-door, using his tram route to transport him around Sydney. In 1917, Appleroth rented premises to manufacture his jelly, then formed a company with Albert Francis Lenertz named Traders Pty Ltd in 1927. Planes were considered new and exciting at the <b>time,</b> <b>so</b> aviation fan Appleroth named the brand Aeroplane Jelly. Appleroth used a Tiger Moth plane to make deliveries to rural areas in 1934, and his publicity stunts and Aeroplane Jelly's advertising campaigns made the jelly a national icon, like Holden and Vegemite.|$|E

5|$|After the Portland Rosebuds, an American-based team, {{joined the}} PCHA in 1914, the {{trustees}} {{issued a statement}} that the Cup was no longer for {{the best team in}} Canada, but now for {{the best team in the}} world. Ice hockey in Europe was still in its infancy at this <b>time,</b> <b>so</b> it was without much controversy that winners of the Stanley Cup began styling themselves as the world champions just like in baseball. Two years later, the Rosebuds became the first American team to play in the Stanley Cup Final. In 1917, the Seattle Metropolitans became the first American team to win the Cup. After that season, the NHA dissolved, and the National Hockey League (NHL) took its place.|$|E
5|$|Although Mirza, Microcebus, and Allocebus form a clade within Cheirogaleidae, {{the three}} {{lineages}} {{are thought to}} have diverged during a narrow window of <b>time,</b> <b>so</b> the relationships within this clade are difficult to determine and may change with further research. All three {{are thought to have}} diverged at least 20mya (million years ago), although another estimate using mtDNA places the divergence between Mirza and Microcebus at 24.2mya. Divergence between the two recognized species of giant mouse lemur is estimated at 2.1mya.|$|E
5|$|Anderssen won the London 1862 chess tournament, {{the first}} {{international}} round-robin tournament (in which each participant plays a game against each of the others) with a score of twelve wins out of thirteen games. He lost only one game, to the Rev. John Owen and finished twopoints ahead of Louis Paulsen, who had the best playing record in the early 1860s. Morphy had retired from chess at this <b>time,</b> <b>so</b> Anderssen was again generally regarded as the world's leading active player.|$|E

5|$|Building J of the pre-Columbian site Monte Albán in Oaxaca {{state in}} Mexico was built around 275 BC, at a {{different}} orientation to other structures in the complex. Its steps are aligned perpendicular to the rising of Capella at that <b>time,</b> <b>so</b> that a person looking out a doorway on the building would have faced it directly. Capella is significant as its heliacal rising took place within a day of the Sun passing directly overhead over Monte Albán.|$|E
5|$|Dowding {{later wrote}} a memo {{considering}} several aircraft for the role, rejecting the Boulton Paul Defiant two-seat fighter {{due to its}} cramped rear turret area. He was sure the Bristol Beaufighter would be perfect for the role, {{but it would not}} be ready for some <b>time.</b> <b>So</b> he selected the Bristol Blenheim light bomber for the immediate term, sending two of the early prototypes to Martlesham Heath to be fitted with the radar from the Battles. Blenheim K7033 was fitted with the radar, while K7034 acted as the target. Both of these aircraft lost a propeller in flight but landed safely; K7033s propeller was never found, but K7034s was returned to Martlesham the next day by an irate farmer.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{financial}} crises, {{it took more}} than one and a half years for Gopalakrishnan to finish the film. Swayamvaram {{was one of the first}} Malayalam films to use synchronised sound and to be filmed in outdoor locales, for which Gopalakrishnan used his Nagra audio recorder. The film was shot in two schedules. It was delayed due to scheduling conflicts of the lead actress, Sharada. She was working in several films at that <b>time,</b> <b>so</b> Gopalakrishnan had to arrange the schedule to suit her convenience. The lead actor, Madhu, mentioned in an interview that Gopalakrishnan was clear about his characters and their behaviour. Gopalakrishnan also used to discuss the shoot with his crew before the shooting.|$|E

5|$|Following Reinboldt's death, {{around the}} time that the Mark Foley scandal broke in 2006, Burdge unsuccessfully {{attempted}} to bring the charges against Hastert to light; she contacted ABC News and the Associated Press on an off-the-record basis, and also contacted some advocacy groups. ABC News and the AP could not corroborate Jolene's allegation at the time, and Hastert denied the accusation to ABC News at the <b>time,</b> <b>so</b> the claim was not published.|$|E
5|$|Goalkeepers Tim Howard and Jens Lehmann {{made their}} {{competitive}} debuts for their respective {{clubs in the}} match. Ole Gunnar Solskjær started in midfield for Manchester United and Paul Scholes played behind the main striker, Ruud van Nistelrooy. For Arsenal, Kolo Touré partnered Sol Campbell in central defence as Martin Keown was absent. Mikaël Silvestre gave Manchester United {{the lead in the}} 15th minute from a corner, but Thierry Henry equalised for Arsenal five minutes later from a free-kick. In the second half, substitute Francis Jeffers was sent off for kicking out at Phil Neville. Neither team was able to score in the remaining <b>time,</b> <b>so</b> the match was decided by a penalty shoot-out. Howard saved the decisive spot-kick taken by Robert Pirès.|$|E
5|$|Heartstrings materialized {{following}} a brief hiatus by Howling Bells, whereupon {{the band members}} worked on other projects. Additionally, Juanita became a first-time mother after giving birth. This, along with frustration from the long period of inactivity and creation inspired her and she started to write songs again, at which point she got {{the other members of}} the band involved. They made demos and sent them out to prospective producers, one being Alan Moulder (Nine Inch Nails, The Smashing Pumpkins). Moulder was busy at the <b>time</b> <b>so</b> he recommended that the band contact an assistant of his, Catherine J. Marks (Foals, The Killers), who after meeting, Howling Bells chose to produce the album.|$|E
