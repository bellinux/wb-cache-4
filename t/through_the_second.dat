The stories were new stories {{based on the}} original stories, with Nancy solving mysteries with her friends George and Ned. Beginning in the second season, {{the format of the}} series changed to focus more on the Hardy Boys, with Nancy Drew primarily appearing as a guest star in several crossover story lines; Martin left the series midway <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> season and was replaced by 19-year-old Janet Louise Johnson for the final few episodes.

5|$|After {{being trapped}} in the harbour {{for more than a}} year, Great Britain was at last floated out in December 1844, but not before causing more anxiety for her proprietors. After passing {{successfully}} through the first set of lock gates, she jammed on her passage <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>second,</b> which led to the River Avon. Only the seamanship of Captain Claxton (who after Naval service held the position of Quay Warden (Harbour Master) at Bristol) enabled her to be pulled back and severe structural damage avoided. The following day an army of workmen, under the direct control of Brunel, took advantage of the slightly higher tide and removed coping stones and lock gate platforms from the Junction Lock, allowing the tug Samson, again under Claxton's supervision, to tow the ship safely into the Avon that midnight.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal {{began the}} match more {{effectively}} {{of the two}} and scored what {{proved to be the}} winning goal in the latter minutes of the first half – Freddie Ljungberg's rebounded goal effort was converted by Robert Pirès. Midway <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> half, Southampton goalkeeper Antti Niemi was substituted, as he strained his calf muscle; he was replaced by Paul Jones. In stoppage time, striker James Beattie had his header cleared off the line by Ashley Cole, in what was the final chance for Southampton.|$|E
5|$|Cambridge {{elected to}} bat and wickets fell regularly. No player made over 33 and the hosts {{were out in}} the second session of the first day for 167. Miller was {{prominent}} with the ball and in the field, taking 5/46 and two catches for his fellow bowlers. In reply, Australia were already 184/1 at stumps, with Brown heading for a consecutive century. He put on 176 for the second wicket with Hamence, who made 92. Brown reached 200 and was out immediately thereafter, prompting stand-in skipper Hassett to declare midway <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> day at 414/4, having reached 61 not out himself. In their second innings Cambridge failed to cope with the leg-spin of McCool, who took 7/78 as the match ended early on the third morning. Attendance over the three days was nearly 25,000.|$|E

5|$|Continuing eastward, {{the drive}} descends down the {{mountain}} toward Copper Harbor. The roadway twists and turns as it alternately climbs and descends several smaller hills along the ridgeline. Along the drive, several viewpoints provide the opportunity to pull off and take in the surroundings. A few of them lie directly adjacent to {{the face of the}} bluff where the mountain quickly rises from the surrounding land. Near the eastern end, there are two sharp hairpin turns, the first of which has a scenic overlook and parking area. This spot overlooks Copper Harbor and the nearby Copper Country Trail National Scenic Byway portion of US Highway 41 (US41) just to the east. From here, the road makes its steep descent down from the ridge, <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> turn and ends at M-26 on the western edge of town.|$|E

During the course of the second stint of the race, Michael Schumacher began to struggle with tyre wear, allowing Coulthard to close the gap and passed him on lap 40. Coulthard maintained his lead <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> round of pit stops and won the race. Michael Schumacher retired on lap 59 with an engine failure promoting Häkkinen into second position. Barrichello took third, ahead of BAR driver Jacques Villeneuve in fourth.|$|E

5|$|During the 19th century, Bond Street {{became less}} {{known for its}} social {{atmosphere}} but increased its reputation as a street for luxury shopping. The auctioneer Phillips was established in 1796 at No.101 Bond Street, specialising in stringed instruments and sheet music. The jewellers Asprey originally opened in 1830 at Nos.165–169 New Bond Street. The Jewish practice of Kabbalah {{has been associated with}} the street after former East End trader Sarah Levenson opened a shop on No.50 New Bond Street in 1856 which immediately became profitable, albeit through exaggerated and questionable product claims. Levenson was twice taken to court and prosecuted for fraud; each prosecution resulted in a five-year prison sentence. She died midway <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>second.</b> Nevertheless, the practice regained popularity and a Kabbalah Centre remains on the street.|$|E
5|$|East Carolina's defense {{managed a}} strong {{performance}} statistically and in real terms. The most obvious {{examples of this}} were the two interceptions and two forced fumbles. On the first play of the second drive of the second quarter, Boise State quarterback Taylor Tharp threw an interception to defensive back Travis Williams. Williams also recorded eightsolo tackles—the second-highest total for the Pirates–and a forced fumble. The other interception came from defensive back J.J. Milbrook, who also boasted threesolo tackles, tying him for fifth–best on the team. Linebacker Jeremy forced the final Broncos turnover, gaining the ball and fouryards on the play. In addition to his forced fumble, Chambliss recorded four solo tackles. The Pirates' defense as a whole only gave up threeyards {{in the first quarter}} and did not allow a first down until halfway <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> quarter.|$|E

Another made the first interception of an airship by a carrier-based aircraft on 2 August 1916, when it unsuccessfully attacked the Zeppelin LZ17. Vindex {{was transferred to the}} Mediterranean in 1918 and was sold back to her original owners in 1920.
