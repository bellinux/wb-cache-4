5|$|In {{keeping with}} their history, the Churches of Christ claim the New Testament as their sole rule {{of faith and}} {{practice}} in deciding matters of doctrine and ecclesiastical structure. <b>They</b> <b>view</b> the Old Testament as divinely inspired and historically accurate, {{but they do not}} consider its laws to be binding under the New Covenant in Christ (unless they are repeated in the New Testament) (Hebrews 8: 7-13). They believe that the New Testament demonstrates how a person may become a Christian (and thus a part of the universal Church of Christ) and how a church should be collectively organized and carry out its scriptural purposes.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, Jeunet {{included}} an alternate {{version of the}} film on the Alien Quadrilogy DVD box set with different opening and closing credits, which were originally cut due to budget restrictions. The deleted scenes included references to the character Newt from Aliens, Vriess making a joke to Call, Ripley's clone {{waking up in the}} middle of her operation, an extended conversation in the mess hall that reveals the details of Ripley's former employers, Weyland-Yutani, an extended dialogue between Call and Ripley's clone in the chapel and scenes of the Betty landing on Earth and the planet's landscape during the final dialogue between Ripley and Call, as <b>they</b> <b>view</b> the ruins of Paris. The special edition restores 13 minutes and 5 seconds worth of footage (including the new opening and ending), and is 7 minutes longer than theatrical version. Jeunet has stated that the special edition is not a director's cut as his preferred version is the theatrical cut.|$|E

5|$|Securely {{attached}} adults tend to {{have positive}} views of themselves, their partners and their relationships. They feel comfortable with intimacy and independence, balancing the two. Anxious-preoccupied adults seek high levels of intimacy, approval and responsiveness from partners, becoming overly dependent. They {{tend to be less}} trusting, have less positive views about themselves and their partners, and may exhibit high levels of emotional expressiveness, worry and impulsiveness in their relationships. Dismissive-avoidant adults desire a high level of independence, often appearing to avoid attachment altogether. <b>They</b> <b>view</b> themselves as self-sufficient, invulnerable to attachment feelings and not needing close relationships. They tend to suppress their feelings, dealing with rejection by distancing themselves from partners of whom they often have a poor opinion. Fearful-avoidant adults have mixed feelings about close relationships, both desiring and feeling uncomfortable with emotional closeness. They tend to mistrust their partners and view themselves as unworthy. Like dismissive-avoidant adults, fearful-avoidant adults tend to seek less intimacy, suppressing their feelings.|$|E

25|$|Indépendentistes {{are fully}} {{nationalist}} in outlook. <b>They</b> <b>view</b> {{the federal government}} as a successor state to the British Empire, and as a de facto colonizing agent of English Canada. Consequently, they demand complete independence for Quebec, which <b>they</b> <b>view</b> in the context of national liberation movements in Africa and the Caribbean of the 1960s. Independence is seen as the culmination of a natural societal progression, from colonization to provincial autonomy to outright independence. Accordingly, they tend to favor assertive declarations of independence over negotiations, idealizing the Patriote movement of the 1830s. Their ideological origins can be found within the Rassemblement pour l'indépendance nationale headed by Pierre Bourgault, a founding organization of the Parti Québécois.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{examined how}} responses to female imagery displayed in Cosmopolitan magazine vary {{as a function}} of females’ conceptualizations of their own sexual identities. After completing the Sexual Self-Schema Scale (SSSS; Andersen & Cyranowski, 1994), female students were randomly assigned to either a sexualized or non-sexualized advertisement condition. Participants rated how they felt as <b>they</b> <b>viewed</b> three images, reported their attitudes toward the images, and completed a post-task mood assessment. Findings revealed significant main effects for condition and schema, but no interactions. First, women exposed to the non-sexualized series reported more favorable attitudes and felt happier as <b>they</b> <b>viewed</b> the advertisements than those exposed to the sexualized series. Second, women with positive sexual self-schemas indicated more favorable attitudes than negatively schematic women, felt the happiest and most excited as <b>they</b> <b>viewed</b> the series, and reported the most positive affect afterward. Suggestions for future research and marketing implications are discussed. Department of Counseling Psychology and Guidance ServicesThesis (M. A. ...|$|R
