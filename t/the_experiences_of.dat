On this account, <b>the</b> <b>Experience</b> <b>of</b> Heterosexual Intercourse Scale (EHIS), which was used by Birnbaum and her colleagues, was administered to 181 women and 178 men.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with setting out the importance of embodied phenomena to <b>the</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> videogame play, and exploring the implications of those phenomena for how we understand <b>the</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> videogame play. In particular, it argues {{that if we are}} to understand <b>the</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> playing videogames as it is <b>experienced</b> by <b>the</b> player, we need to reorientate our approach to foreground <b>the</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> player. By taking this path it diverges from much, if not most, extant research on <b>the</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> videogame play, which, it is argued, focuses more on theorising the likely effects or outcomes of particular formal qualities or design decisions, rather than how <b>the</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> videogame play in itself emerges from the interaction between the embodied player and the videogame during the course of play. This approach opens up the phenomena of videogame play to more detailed and grounded accounts of the player’s relation to the interface used to play, <b>the</b> nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> engagement in <b>the</b> course of play, and the deep involvement of the body in <b>the</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> play. <b>The</b> approach and theoretical framework employed in this thesis is influenced by Dourish’s notion of embodied interaction, which is adapted to the context of videogame play through further consideration and employment of phenomenological concepts, such as Merleau-Ponty’s work on the importance of our embodied being and <b>of</b> habituated bodily <b>experience,</b> and Heidegger’s differentiation between the ready-to-hand and the present-at-hand, to <b>the</b> articulation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> videogame play. This leads to the key recurring thematic concern of this thesis, namely the role played by the interface in <b>the</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> videogame play. Over the course of several chapters a more expansive conceptual model of the interface than the more technically based definitions usually employed is developed. This expanded conceptualisation of the interface is applied {{to the nature of the}} interface itself, the role played by its physical aspects, and how it affords the player access to, and a sense of presence within, the game-world. By understanding the embodied relation between the player and the interface used to play the importance of <b>the</b> phenomena <b>of</b> bodily <b>experience</b> is made visible, and opens up the phenomena of videogame play to more detailed and grounded accounts of the player’s relation to the interface used to play, <b>the</b> nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> engagement in <b>the</b> course of play, and the deep involvement of the body in <b>the</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> play. What emerges from such an approach is not only an increased understanding of <b>the</b> nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> videogame play, but also of the centrality of embodiment to that <b>experience.</b> This centrality <b>of</b> embodiment to <b>the</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> videogame play is demonstrated in the final chapter, which employs the work done over the course of the thesis to examine and articulate <b>the</b> phenomenological <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> movement within game-worlds...|$|R
