40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the effects of}} medium (MCT) and long (LCT) chain <b>triglyceride</b> test meals on gall bladder contraction (using ultrasonography) and small intestinal bile acid concentrations and ileal flow rates (using intubation techniques) in normal individuals. Comparing the effects of ingesting medium chain <b>triglyceride</b> and long chain <b>triglyceride</b> meals, the gall bladder volume was reduced by 23. 4 +/- 33. 6 % and 59. 0 +/- 17. 1 % respectively (mean +/- SD, p less than 0. 01, n = 13), the jejunal bile acid concentrations increased significantly only after the ingestion of long chain <b>triglyceride</b> (p less than 0. 05, n = 5), while {{the volume of the}} postprandial jejunal contents was not significantly different (540 +/- 150, 522 +/- 169 ml, medium chain <b>triglyceride</b> vs long chain <b>triglyceride,</b> p = 0. 2, n = 5). The postprandial colonic inflow was 48. 5 +/- 12. 5 and 123. 4 +/- 35. 2 ml/h (medium chain <b>triglyceride</b> vs long chain <b>triglyceride,</b> p less than 0. 01, n = 5). Thus medium chain <b>triglyceride,</b> compared with long chain <b>triglyceride,</b> produces a smaller input of bile acids into the small intestine and a smaller volume of fluid delivered to the colon. These observations may be relevant to the beneficial effects of medium chain <b>triglyceride</b> substitution for long chain <b>triglyceride</b> in the treatment of diarrhoea in patients with small intestinal disease...|$|R

5|$|In animals, {{when there}} is an {{oversupply}} of dietary carbohydrate, the excess carbohydrate is converted to <b>triglycerides.</b> This involves the synthesis of fatty acids from acetyl-CoA and the esterification of fatty acids in the production of <b>triglycerides,</b> a process called lipogenesis. Fatty acids are made by fatty acid synthases that polymerize and then reduce acetyl-CoA units. The acyl chains in the fatty acids are extended by a cycle of reactions that add the acetyl group, reduce it to an alcohol, dehydrate it to an alkene group and then reduce it again to an alkane group. The enzymes of fatty acid biosynthesis are divided into two groups, in animals and fungi all these fatty acid synthase reactions are carried out by a single multifunctional protein, while in plant plastids and bacteria separate enzymes perform each step in the pathway. The fatty acids may be subsequently converted to <b>triglycerides</b> that are packaged in lipoproteins and secreted from the liver.|$|E

Two mouse transgenic mouse models (APOA5 transgenic and APOA5 knockout) confirmed {{the important role of}} this gene in plasma triglyceride levels of plasma <b>triglycerides.</b> Obesity and metabolic syndrome are both closely related to plasma triglyceride levels and APOA5. Recent meta-analyses suggest that the effect on metabolic syndrome development is more profound for rs662799 in Asian population and for rs3135506 for Europeans. Moreover, meta-analysis that focused on rs662799 and the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus has suggested a significant association in Asian populations, but not in European populations.|$|E
5|$|Normal {{dietary fat}} {{contains}} mostly long-chain <b>triglycerides</b> (LCT). Medium-chain <b>triglycerides</b> are more ketogenic than LCTs because they generate more ketones {{per unit of}} energy when metabolised. Their use allows for a diet with a lower proportion of fat and {{a greater proportion of}} protein and carbohydrate, leading to more food choices and larger portion sizes. The original MCT diet developed by Peter Huttenlocher in the 1970s derived 60% of its calories from MCT oil. Consuming that quantity of MCT oil caused abdominal cramps, diarrhoea and vomiting in some children. A figure of 45% is regarded as a balance between achieving good ketosis and minimising gastrointestinal complaints. The classical and modified MCT ketogenic diets are equally effective and differences in tolerability are not statistically significant. The MCT diet is less popular in the United States; MCT oil is more expensive than other dietary fats and is not covered by insurance companies.|$|E

Methods: A total of 80 patients were included in this prospective cohort study. Oral lipid loading was used {{in order to measure}} PPTG levels. In the fasting state and after the high fat breakfast, <b>triglyceride</b> levels were measured by enzymatic methods at 2 nd, 4 th, 6 th and 8 th hours. We made subgroup analysis to show the effects of lipid loading on <b>triglyceride</b> levels in patients with and without fasting hypertriglyceridemia. We evaluated <b>triglyceride</b> levels and changes of <b>triglyceride</b> levels in percentages after lipid loading using a general linear model for repeated measures. Sample size analysis was performed. Results: Baseline clinical, demographic and laboratory characteristics of both groups were similar. The peak <b>triglyceride</b> levels were seen at the 4 th hour in both groups. <b>Triglyceride</b> levels were significantly increased after lipid-rich-breakfast loading compared to baseline levels in both groups (p< 0. 001) but these changes were not significant (p= 0. 279). In patients with elevated fasting <b>triglyceride</b> levels, the area under the plasma <b>triglyceride</b> concentration curve was significantly larger in CAD group than control group (334 ± 103 vs. 233 ± 58 mg/dl, p= 0. 02).

Some of the mechanisms responsible {{were examined in}} rats receiving calories as dextrose (CHO-TPN) or dextrose plus lipid emulsion (Lipid-TPN). Hepatic <b>triglyceride</b> content increased approximately threefold after CHO-TPN and twofold after Lipid-TPN (P less than 0. 02). Hepatic <b>triglyceride</b> fatty acid composition reflected endogenous synthesis. Hepatic acetyl-Coenzyme A carboxylase specific activity increased fourfold after CHO-TPN and twofold after Lipid-TPN, and it correlated positively with hepatic lipid content (r = 0. 82). The activities of the microsomal enzymes of complex lipid synthesis were unchanged in the TPN groups. Both TPN regimens suppressed hepatic <b>triglyceride</b> secretion, measured by the rise in plasma <b>triglyceride</b> and the incorporation of [14 C]palmitic acid into plasma <b>triglyceride</b> after intravenous Triton. Hepatic <b>triglyceride</b> secretion correlated negatively with total hepatic lipid content (r = - 0. 89). CHO-TPN increased the uptake of a radiolabeled <b>triglyceride</b> emulsion and increased hepatic lipase activity, whereas Lipid-TPN decreased both. Both adipose and cardiac lipase were higher for Lipid-TPN animals than for CHO-TPN or control animals. Hepatic 14 C-triglyceride content was increased in both TPN groups as compared with controls after the injection of 1 -[14 C]-palmitic acid. This increment was proportional to the decreased hepatic secretion. <b>Triglyceride</b> fatty acid oxidation was significantly suppressed by CHO-TPN, less so by Lipid-TPN. Free fatty acid oxidation was suppressed only by CHO-TPN. The {{results suggest that the}} steatosis induced by TPN in rats was due to enhanced hepatic synthesis of fatty acid and reduced <b>triglyceride</b> secretion. Reduced hepatic <b>triglyceride</b> uptake, enhanced fatty acid oxidation, and enhanced peripheral tissue plasma <b>triglyceride</b> lipolysis when CHO-TPN is supplemented with lipid may modulate the accumulation of hepatic <b>triglyceride</b> and, along with reduced synthesis of fatty acid, lead to a lower hepatic <b>triglyceride</b> content...|$|R

40|$|<b>Triglyceride</b> {{accumulation}} in injured renal tubular cells: Alterations in synthetic and catabolic pathways. BackgroundTriglycerides can {{accumulate in}} injured tissues, a process thought to represent flux of excess, cytotoxic, {{free fatty acids}} into nontoxic <b>triglyceride</b> storage pools. However, this view may be overly simplistic, given that multiple pathways may impact <b>triglyceride</b> levels. This study sought new insights into this issue. MethodsCultured human proximal tubule [human kidney- 2 (HK- 2) ] cells or in vivo kidney were subjected to injuries known to increase <b>triglyceride</b> levels ∼three- to fourfold [HK- 2 cells antimycin A–induced mitochondrial blockade; in vivo glycerol-induced rhabdomyolysis; endotoxemia). Six reverse transcription-polymerase chain reactions (RT-PCRs) were used to monitor mouse/human mRNAs for renal fatty acid transport protein (FATP 2), or triglyceride-synthesizing enzymes (acyl-coenzyme A:diacylglycerol acyltransferases DGAT 1 and DGAT 2). Fatty acid synthase (FAS) and FATP 2 were gauged by Western blot. FAS, FATP 2, mitochondrial respiration, and phospholipase A 2 (PLA 2) effects on cell <b>triglyceride</b> accumulation were probed. Finally, tissue lipase activity was assessed. ResultsAntimycin A up-regulated multiple determinants of HK- 2 cell <b>triglyceride</b> formation, including FATP 2, FAS, DGAT 1, and DGAT 2 (proteins and/or mRNAs). However, neither FAS- nor FATP 2 -inhibition eliminated antimycin A–induced <b>triglyceride</b> loading, indicating the latter's multifactorial basis. PLA 2 activity increased FFA and <b>triglyceride</b> content. Rhabdomyolysis and endotoxemia altered multiple <b>triglyceride</b> homeostatic mechanisms. However, these changes were model-dependent and did not closely parallel those in HK- 2 cells. Lipase activity signficantly fell (glycerol) or rose (endotoxemia) with different forms of tissue damage. ConclusionInjury-induced <b>triglyceride</b> accumulation stems from multiple, and disease-specific, changes in <b>triglyceride</b> synthetic and degradative pathways. Simple flux of excess FFAs into <b>triglyceride</b> pools is an overly simplistic view of the post-injury-triglyceride loading state...|$|R
5|$|Although {{the term}} lipid is {{sometimes}} {{used as a}} synonym for fats, fats are a subgroup of lipids called <b>triglycerides.</b> Lipids also encompass molecules such as fatty acids and their derivatives (including tri-, di-, monoglycerides, and phospholipids), {{as well as other}} sterol-containing metabolites such as cholesterol.

5|$|In the 1960s, it was {{discovered}} that medium-chain <b>triglycerides</b> (MCTs) produce more ketone bodies per unit of energy than normal dietary fats (which are mostly long-chain <b>triglycerides).</b> MCTs are more efficiently absorbed and are rapidly transported to the liver via the hepatic portal system rather than the lymphatic system. The severe carbohydrate restrictions of the classic ketogenic diet made it difficult for parents to produce palatable meals that their children would tolerate. In 1971, Peter Huttenlocher devised a ketogenic diet where about 60% of the calories came from the MCT oil, and this allowed more protein and up to three times as much carbohydrate as the classic ketogenic diet. The oil was mixed with at least twice its volume of skimmed milk, chilled, and sipped during the meal or incorporated into food. He tested it on twelve children and adolescents with intractable seizures. Most children improved in both seizure control and alertness, results that were similar to the classic ketogenic diet. Gastrointestinal upset was a problem, which led one patient to abandon the diet, but meals were easier to prepare and better accepted by the children. The MCT diet replaced the classic ketogenic diet in many hospitals, though some devised diets that were a combination of the two.|$|E

40|$|Purpose of review—Elevated plasma <b>triglyceride</b> {{and reduced}} HDL {{concentrations}} are prominent features of metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes. Individuals with Tangier disease also have elevated plasma <b>triglyceride</b> concentrations and very low HDL, resulting from mutations in ATP-binding cassette transporter A 1 (ABCA 1), an integral membrane protein that facilitates nascent HDL particle assembly. Past studies attributed the {{inverse relationship between}} plasma HDL and <b>triglyceride</b> to intravascular lipid exchange and catabolic events. However, recent studies also suggest that hepatic signaling and lipid mobilization and secretion may explain how HDL affects plasma <b>triglyceride</b> concentrations. Recent findings—Hepatocyte-specific ABCA 1 knockout mice have markedly reduced plasma HDL and a two-fold increase in <b>triglyceride</b> due to failure to assemble nascent HDL particles by hepatocytes, causing increased catabolism of HDL apolipoprotein A-I and increased hepatic production of triglyceride-enriched VLDL. In-vitro studies suggest that nascent HDL particles may induce signaling to decrease <b>triglyceride</b> secretion. Inhibition of microRNA 33 expression in nonhuman primates augments hepatic ABCA 1, genes involved in fatty acid oxidation, and decreases expression of lipogenic genes, causing increased plasma HDL and decreased <b>triglyceride</b> levels. Summary—New evidence suggests potential mechanisms by which hepatic ABCA 1 -mediated nascent HDL formation regulates VLDL–triglyceride production and contributes to the inverse relationship between plasma HDL and <b>triglyceride...</b>|$|R

Oral administration of KRN 4884 (3 [*]mg kg− 1) for 10 days caused {{a significant reduction}} in serum <b>triglyceride</b> levels, which was comparable to that of clofibrate (160 [*]mg kg− 1). Reduction in serum <b>triglyceride</b> levels by KRN 4884 and clofibrate were accompanied by a reduction in <b>triglyceride</b> levels both in chylomicron and in very low density lipoprotein. KRN 4884 treatment did not affect serum concentrations of total cholesterol and phospholipid, but did increase free fatty acid levels. Clofibrate reduced total cholesterol, phospholipid and free fatty acid levels. Administration of clofibrate significantly decreased <b>triglyceride</b> secretion rate as measured by the Triton WR- 1339 injection procedure, while KRN 4884 did not. Rats receiving KRN 4884 exhibited an increase in lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity both in adipose tissue and in skeletal muscle.

5|$|P. acnes also provokes skin {{inflammation}} {{by altering}} the fatty composition of oily sebum. Oxidation of the lipid squalene by P. acnes {{is of particular}} importance. Squalene oxidation activates NF-κB (a protein complex) and consequently increases IL-1α levels. Additionally, squalene oxidation leads to increased activity of the 5-lipoxygenase enzyme responsible for conversion of arachidonic acid to leukotriene B4 (LTB4). LTB4 promotes skin inflammation by acting on the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα) protein. PPARα increases activity of activator protein 1 (AP-1) and NF-κB, thereby leading to the recruitment of inflammatory T cells. The inflammatory properties of P. acnes can be further explained by the bacterium's ability to convert sebum <b>triglycerides</b> to pro-inflammatory free fatty acids via secretion of the enzyme lipase. These free fatty acids spur production of cathelicidin, HBD1, and HBD2, thus leading to further inflammation.|$|E

5|$|Most {{of the fat}} {{found in}} food {{is in the form}} of <b>triglycerides,</b> cholesterol, and phospholipids. Some dietary fat is {{necessary}} to facilitate absorption of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K) and carotenoids. Humans and other mammals have a dietary requirement for certain essential fatty acids, such as linoleic acid (an omega-6 fatty acid) and alpha-linolenic acid (an omega-3 fatty acid) because they cannot be synthesized from simple precursors in the diet. Both of these fatty acids are 18-carbon polyunsaturated fatty acids differing in the number and position of the double bonds. Most vegetable oils are rich in linoleic acid (safflower, sunflower, and corn oils). Alpha-linolenic acid is found in the green leaves of plants, and in selected seeds, nuts, and legumes (in particular flax, rapeseed, walnut, and soy). Fish oils are particularly rich in the longer-chain omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). A large number of studies have shown positive health benefits associated with consumption of omega-3 fatty acids on infant development, cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and various mental illnesses, such as depression, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, and dementia.
