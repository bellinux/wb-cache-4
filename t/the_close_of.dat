40|$|The project {{deals with}} <b>the</b> <b>closing</b> <b>of</b> a Danish {{military}} barrack {{in the town}} of Sønderborg. We analyse <b>the</b> consequences <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>closing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> barrack, in the sense of which sociological impact <b>the</b> <b>closing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> barracks has on the citizens of Sønderborg, because of the huge cultural value and historic meaning of the barracks in the city. In extension of this, we have used Pierre Bourdieu and Robert D. Putnam and their theories about capital forms, especially symbolic capital and social bridging/bonding. Furthermore the project deals with another significant and important question about <b>the</b> <b>closing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> barracks. It is the question {{about what to do with}} the barrack now, and how you can use it in the future. Therefore we include Richard Florida and his theory about the creative class, and how they create growth and reduce the economical impact associated with <b>the</b> <b>closing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> barrack and ensure the city’s cohesion. The method is a comparative case study that includes a comparative analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>closing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> famous barrack in the city of Næstved 10 years ago...|$|R
