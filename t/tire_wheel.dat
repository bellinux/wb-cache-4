Arthur Grant was issued , a patent for his solid rubber tire in a rim channel.

50|$|Typical bicycle speedometers {{measure the}} time between each wheel revolution, and give a readout on a small, handlebar-mounted digital display. The sensor is mounted on the bike at a fixed location, pulsing when the spoke-mounted magnet passes by. In this way, it is {{analogous}} to an electronic car speedometer using pulses from an ABS sensor, but with a much cruder time/distance resolution - typically one pulse/display update per revolution, or as seldom as once every 2-3 seconds at low speed with a 26-inch (2.07m circumference, without <b>tire)</b> <b>wheel.</b> However, this is rarely a critical problem, and the system provides frequent updates at higher road speeds where the information is of more importance. The low pulse frequency also has little impact on measurement accuracy, as these digital devices can be programmed by wheel size, or additionally by wheel or tire circumference {{in order to make}} distance measurements more accurate and precise than a typical motor vehicle gauge. However these devices carry some minor disadvantage in requiring power from batteries that must be replaced every so often in the receiver (AND sensor, for wireless models), and, in wired models, the signal being carried by a thin cable that is much less robust than that used for brakes, gears, or cabled speedometers.|$|E
5000|$|They {{introduced}} a locomotive style, double-under mounted steam traction engine to the market. However, {{by this time}} track-type tractors and a combination combine-harvester were becoming more popular over the large steel <b>tire</b> <b>wheel</b> tractor and the stationary threshing machine. Continuing to grow, the company in 1916 purchased a former plant of the Kingman Plow Co., and in 1917 they acquired the Davis Manufacturing Co. engine plant in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, enabling Avery to build its own engines. J. B. Bartholomew had for several years been President of the Bartholomew Company, which manufactured Glide automobiles in Peoria Heights. In 1920 he decided to bring the plant into the Avery Co. fold and it was utilized to manufacture trucks. Avery employed four thousand people by this point. When the agricultural depression of the early 1920s struck, Avery's varied product offerings were expensive, and when farmers defaulted on their notes held by Avery dealers, the company's liberal credit policy badly hurt its finances. Farmers also showed increasing preference for track-type farm implements, and Avery failed to innovate with new products. They built one track-type tractor named the [...] "Trackrunner," [...] but were unsuccessful at perfecting it. Some machinery sold did not work as advertised, and Avery failed to fix the problems. Avery cut its work force in August 1920 by 90 per cent, to 250 workers. They replaced the tubular radiator style with an improved tubular cellular design, {{but it was not}} enough.|$|E

In addition, Reliability and Maintainability (RAM) is an important issue in the operation of refrigerated trailer fleets. Often, as trailers age, their reliability decreases.

40|$|Nose-wheel {{landing gears}} can become {{laterally}} unstable during takeoff, taxiing, and landing, exhibiting divergent. coupled lateral flexural and torsional oscillations called shimmy. The system stability {{is governed by}} the gear and tire dynamic characteristics, system nonlinearities, and vibratory modes of the vehicle, {{as well as by}} the degree of coupling that exists between these modes. Ground unevenness can produce significant lateral excitation on the landing gear and results in adversely impacting its lateral stability. To evaluate a nose-wheel landing gear system for its stability and response, it is necessary to model system components to capture the contributions of the landing gear structure, the <b>tire,</b> <b>wheel</b> configuration, system nordinearities, and its interaction with the runway. This paper examines the lateral response of linear and nonlinear simplified nose-wheel landing gear models to ground-induced lateral excitation. Considering torsional free play as the source of nonlinearity and external excitation due to runway roughness, modeling and analysis of nose-wheel landing gear shimmy is presented. The spatial variation of the runway surface is modeled as a continuous profile, obtained as a combination of sinusoids to represent a randomlike ground-induced excitation with the specified power spectral density. Time-domain simulation studies on the linear landing gear system show that unacceptable levels of lateral accelerations may be caused even at subcritical velocities. Studies on nonlinear nose-wheel landing gear systems bring out the fact that the free play can result in a significant reduction of the critical shimmy velocity and the need for such simulations in the subcritical ranges of velocities...|$|E

This study was carried out to identify the growth of the company as a result of efficient acquisition and assimilation of technology in line with business strategies. Measuring instruments were designed to assess acquisition of technology knowledge in products and processes as well as the growth stage of acquired technologies and its transfer status to Loadstar. In addition, study focused on assessing acquisition of capabilities such as Design Engineering, R&D, Production and Selling and Servicing. Furthermore, balanced scorecard management tool was used to study the behavior of key business parameters such as Turnover growth, Internal growth in product and technologies, Level of customer satisfaction and growth in employment and training. Literature survey shows the analysis of technology based development of a manufacturing company mainly requires proper understanding of technology components. It also indicates that successful acquisition of identified technologies heavily relies on the level of acquiring core capabilities as well as supporting capabilities. Concepts such as "Technology ball" and "Technology based development of a firm" indicate the acquisition of knowledge and level of technology transfer with time respectively. Study revealed that Loadstar has successfully acquired process technology capabilities from its inception and moved on to acquiring R&D capabilities, especially in material development and bias ply pneumatic tire design after 1998. It was also found that Loadstar's capability in Solid tire product development is quite low,' even though it carries the considerable market share compared to pneumatic tires.
