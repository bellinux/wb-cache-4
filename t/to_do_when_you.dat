However, in June 2012, it was confirmed that Zimmer would, in fact, be writing the film's musical score. To completely distinguish Man of Steel from the previous films, the iconic [...] "Superman March" [...] by John Williams was not used. Hans Zimmer's soundtrack for Man of Steel was released publicly on June 11, 2013. An unofficial rip of the musical score from the third trailer, entitled [...] "An Ideal of Hope", confirmed to be a cut-down version of the track [...] "What Are You Going <b>to</b> <b>Do</b> <b>When</b> <b>You</b> Are Not Saving the World?", was released on April 19, 2013.

500|$|Following the {{publication}} of the final volume of The Balkan Trilogy in 1965, Manning worked on her cat memoir and a collection of short stories, A Romantic Hero and Other Stories, both of which were published in 1967. Another novel, The Play Room (published as The Camperlea Girls in the US), appeared in 1969. The book of short stories and The Play Room both contained homosexual themes, a topic which interested Manning. The latter was a less than successful exploration of the lives and interests of adolescents, though the reviews were generally encouraging. A film version was proposed, and Ken Annakin asked her to write the script. The movie, with more explicit lesbian scenes than the book, was all but made before the money ran out; a second version, with a very different script, was also developed but came to nothing. [...] "Everything fizzled out", she said. [...] "I wasted {{a lot of time and}} that is something which you cannot afford <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> are sixty"; in keeping with her obfuscations about her age, she was actually sixty-two.|$|E

Following the {{completion}} of two songs written {{from the perspective of}} being dead, vocalist/guitarist Ben Jorgensen created a whole story from this perspective. What <b>to</b> <b>Do</b> <b>When</b> <b>You</b> Are Dead is a concept album, with each song telling the story of the protagonist's suicide as well as his journey through the afterlife. Recording took place between August and October 2004 with producer Machine. A rough mix of [...] "Car Underwater" [...] was made available in November, followed by two US tours in February 2005.

2500|$|To {{celebrate}} the 10th anniversary of What <b>to</b> <b>Do</b> <b>When</b> <b>You</b> Are Dead, the band performed {{a series of}} shows in September, October and December 2015, during which they performed the album in its entirety. In 2015, Maria Sherman of Fuse.tv wrote that the album [...] "laid the foundation for future pop-punk bands to explore concept records in very real ways". Calling it [...] "impressive at the time, this band from the suburbs [...] a power pop-punk record with a linear, intricate narrative". AXS contributor Tarynn Law wrote that [...] "the instantly relateable tracks that filled What <b>To</b> <b>Do</b> <b>When</b> <b>You</b> Are Dead soundtracked the teenage angst of kids {{all around the country}} for years to come". Brian Aberback of NorthJersey.com noted that the album [...] "put Armor for Sleep on the indie-rock map and continues to resonate heavily with fans 10 years later". Jorgensen later called the album a [...] "diary entry. Without that, I {{think a lot of people}} when [...] lives go on they forget what they went through at a certain point in time so for me thatâ€™s the biggest markers for me to remember where I was at the point in my life." ...|$|E

2500|$|What <b>to</b> <b>Do</b> <b>When</b> <b>You</b> Are Dead was {{recorded}} between August and October 2004 at Water Music and The Machine Shop in Hoboken, New Jersey. Producer duties were handled by Machine. While making the album, frontman Ben Jorgensen analysed Pink Floyd's The Dark Side of the Moon (1973). He recorded his rhythm part first, followed by drums, then guitarist PJ Decicco tracked his lead parts and additional rhythm parts, {{ending with the}} bass lines. [...] Decicco said that Machine felt that the bass needed to be recorded last because it [...] "sometimes goes out of tune more so he has more of a reference to kind of hear things if he has them with the guitars already".|$|E
2500|$|To the {{statement}} that the Kansas science standards {{had nothing to do}} with intelligent design but were only about teaching evolution in a [...] "balanced" [...] way, Borofsky responded: [...] "It really is ID in disguise. The entire purpose behind all of this is to shift it into schools...at least that is the hope/fear among some science teachers in the area. The problem is, if you are not going to be dogmatic in Darwinism that means you inevitably have to point out a fault or at least an alternative to Darwinism. So far, the only plausible theory is ID. If one is to challenge Darwin, then one must use ID. To challenge Darwin is to challenge natural selection/spontaneous first cause...which is what the Kansas board is attempting <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> <b>When</b> <b>you</b> do that, you have to invoke the idea of ID." ...|$|E

2500|$|AXS writer Terrance Pryor {{considers}} What <b>to</b> <b>Do</b> <b>When</b> <b>You</b> Are Dead {{a concept}} album [...] "based around the main character's suicide and his {{journey through the}} afterlife". Some observers have noted the character going through the KÃ¼bler-Ross 5-stage model of grief management. Jorgensen {{grew up in a}} [...] "very scientific environment," [...] which caused him to be influenced by British writer Craig Hamilton-Parker. The album's title comes from a Hamilton-Parker book. Jorgensen explained that since he was [...] "already writing an album in that way, and when I saw that book, I thought, Â‘'It would be really cool to make a whole album out of this." [...] Jorgensen later remarked that placing himself in that perspective helped him [...] "face a lot of things I probably would've been too much of a wuss to face, if I didn't pretend I wasn't alive". The band were initially hesitant working on a concept album until they were persuaded by Jorgensen.|$|E

[...] "She came up to me the first day we worked together and offered to go over lines together and help me with anything I needed. She is a sweetheart," [...] said Baker. Baker revealed that in her spare time in between takes as the character, she managed to find something to keep entertained by. [...] "It seems like there is always something <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> have down time on the set," [...] she said. [...] "I either run lines with the other actors or hang out in the hair and makeup room. I love those ladies!" [...] Adding to Baker's enjoyment on the set was Young. [...] "He is always cracking jokes!" [...] stated Baker.|$|E
2500|$|AllMusic {{reviewer}} John D. Luerssen {{wrote that}} What <b>to</b> <b>Do</b> <b>When</b> <b>You</b> Are Dead [...] "ups the punk/emo ante" [...] with [...] "fabulously" [...] composed songs, {{as well as}} a [...] "desire to challenge the norms of a movement that has grown increasingly stale". He described Jorgensen as going [...] "dark" [...] and [...] "flirting with his inner Aaron Lewis". Luerssen called the band's choice of working with Machine as being [...] "a risk that paid off". Chart Attack called the album a [...] "surprisingly meaty sophomore record," [...] with the group's [...] "dynamic double-guitar attack" [...] benefiting from Machine's [...] "prog-metal predilections". Chart Attack concluded with: [...] "Songs about dead people have rarely sounded so damned full of life." [...] Raziq Rauf of Drowned in Sound wrote that the record had [...] "two great songs on here that fill the unashamed emo cynic with hope, only to be let down" [...] by the remainder of the album. He {{went on to say that}} a [...] "slight redemption can be made" [...] with the album's title, but aside from that, [...] "there's nothing else to say that you've not read before". LAS Magazine writer David Spain called the album [...] "an interesting notch along the battered branch of emo's legacy," [...] with the band giving [...] "its peers food for thought". Spain noted that the group [...] "didn't just set out to create another 40-minute schmaltz fest; they vested thought and idea into their work". Spain concluded by mentioning how the band [...] "succeed in creating a surprisingly original work in a drowning genre".|$|E
