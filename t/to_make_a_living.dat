5|$|As a harpsichordist, Pinnock toured Europe {{with the}} Academy of St. Martin in the Fields. While {{a student at}} the RCM, he was told by the registrar, John Stainer, that it would be {{impossible}} <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>living</b> as a harpsichordist. He made his London debut at the Royal Festival Hall in 1966 with the Galliard Harpsichord Trio, which he co-founded with Stephen Preston, flute, and Anthony Pleeth, cello. At this stage, they were playing baroque music on modern instruments. His solo harpsichord debut was in 1968 at the Purcell Room in London.|$|E

They refuted some of the inaccuracies in Treves's account, showing that Merrick's mother did not abandon him, and that Merrick deliberately chose to exhibit himself <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>living.</b>|$|E

5|$|Later in the Han Dynasty, mystics like Luan {{gradually}} {{lost their}} influence as the rulers passed many laws against them.

5|$|Although {{not very}} much is known about Allen's childhood, the town of Cornwall was {{frontier}} territory in the 1740s. By the time Allen reached his teens, the area, while still a difficult area in which <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>living,</b> began to resemble a town, with wood-frame houses beginning to replace the rough cabins of the early settlers. Joseph Allen died in 1755; {{at the time of}} his death he was one of the wealthier landowners in the area, ran a successful farm, and had previously served as town selectman. Allen had, before his father's death, begun studies under a minister in the nearby town of Salisbury with the goal of gaining admission to Yale College. Allen's brother Ira recalled that, even at a young age, Allen was curious and interested in learning.|$|E

5|$|Druitt rented legal {{chambers}} at 9 King's Bench Walk in the Inner Temple.

While some of Druitt's biographers claim his practice did not flourish, others suppose that it provided him with a relatively substantial income {{on the basis of}} his costly lease of chambers and the value of his estate at death. He is listed in the Law List of 1886 as active in the Western Circuit and Winchester Sessions, and for 1887 in the Western Circuit and Hampshire, Portsmouth and Southampton Assizes.|$|E
5|$|Hogarth {{was well}} acquainted with the struggles of the Grub Street hack though, through the travails of his own father, Richard, who had been unable <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>living</b> as writer and had {{eventually}} {{ended up at the}} Fleet Prison as a bankrupt. Hogarth may have been more than sympathetic to the dunce struggling with his rhymes. Jenny Uglow in her biography of Hogarth, posits that the gradual alteration of the prints above the poet's head could suggest a slow softening of attitudes towards Pope and his attack on the class of writer to which Hogarth's father had belonged, and perhaps evidence of Hogarth making his own compromises in his endeavours to become successful.|$|E
5|$|Six of the Pendle witches {{came from}} one of two families, each at the time headed by {{a woman in her}} eighties: Elizabeth Southerns (a.k.a. Demdike), her {{daughter}} Elizabeth Device, and her grandchildren James and Alizon Device; Anne Whittle (a.k.a. Chattox), and her daughter Anne Redferne. The others accused were Jane Bulcock and her son John Bulcock, Alice Nutter, Katherine Hewitt, Alice Grey, and Jennet Preston. The outbreaks of witchcraft in and around Pendle may demonstrate the extent to which people could make a living by posing as witches. Many of the allegations resulted from accusations that members of the Demdike and Chattox families made against each other, perhaps because they were in competition, both trying <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>living</b> from healing, begging, and extortion.|$|E

5|$|The young William showed artistic promise from {{an early}} age, drawing in chalk on the wooden floor of his father's shop. From the age of four he {{attended}} local schools in York, before being sent {{at the age of}} 10 to Mr. Hall's Academy, a boarding school in nearby Pocklington, which he left two years later. On 8October 1798, at the age of 11, William was apprenticed as a printer to Robert Peck of Hull, publisher of the Hull Packet. While Etty found the work exhausting and unpleasant, he continued to draw in his spare time, and his job gave him the opportunity to broaden his education by reading books. It seems likely that it was working as a printer that led him to realise {{for the first time that}} it was possible for someone <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>living</b> drawing and painting.|$|E
5|$|Bertie's Brainstorm is a 1911 American silent short drama film {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. The film focuses on Bertie Fawcett, a dim-witted fop, who erroneously believes to have won the heart of May Vernon. In reality, May loves Jack and the two are set to be married, but May's father wishes he would prove his worth by earning his own living. Bertie chances upon the letter and sets off <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>living</b> proceeds {{through a number of}} jobs with hope to claim May as his bride. The film ends with Bertie returning and finding out that May has married Jack. Little is known about the production of the film save that William Russell played an unknown role and that the scenario was written by Lloyd F. Lonergan. The foppish character of Bertie may have been inspired by Edwin Thanhouser's role as Bertie Nizril in Thoroughbred. Originally conceived as a series, this ultimately singular work received praise from critics. The film is presumed lost.|$|E
5|$|Born in Toronto {{with the}} surname Nudelman, Newman {{was the son}} of a Russian-Jewish {{immigrant}} father who ran a shoe shop. After studying at Ogden Public School, which he left at the age of thirteen, he later enrolled in the Central Technical School, studying art and design subjects. He initially attempted to follow a career as a stills photographer and an artist, specialising in drawing film posters. However, he found it so difficult to earn enough money <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>living</b> from this profession that instead, he switched to working in the film industry itself. In 1938, he travelled to Hollywood, where he was offered a role with the Walt Disney Company on the strength of his graphic design work. However, he was unable to take the job due to a failure to secure a work permit. Returning to his native country, in 1941, he gained a job as a film editor at the National Film Board of Canada. He was eventually to work on over 350 films while an editor for the NFB.|$|E

5|$|Bradman {{had almost}} opted {{out of the}} tour, citing {{business}} commitments in Australia; at the time, {{it was not possible}} <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>living</b> from cricket. Prior to the campaign in England, Australia hosted India for a five-Test series during the southern hemisphere summer of 194748. Australia easily defeated the tourists 40, and Bradman and his fellow selectors Chappie Dwyer and Jack Ryder thus began planning for the tour of England. Bradman made it publicly known that he wanted his team to become the first to play an English summer without defeat. England had agreed to make a new ball available every 55 overs, instead of the previous rule of after 200 runs had been scored. As the run rate was generally much slower than 3.64, 55 overs would usually elapse long before 200 runs were scored. This meant that the ball was in a shiny state more often, and thereby more conducive to fast and swing bowling. Bradman and his colleagues thus chose the team with an emphasis on strong batting and fast bowling, basing his strategy on an intense speed attack against England's batsmen. His 17-man squad sailed for England and arrived in mid-April.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} half of the 1970s, the United Kingdom was in a state of social unrest and {{widespread}} poverty as a result of the ineffective social politics of both Conservative and Labour Party governments during a three-year period of economic recession. As a consequence of deindustrialization, the unemployment rate was exceptionally high, especially among working class youth. It continued to rise in the early 1980s, peaking in February 1983. The discontent of so many people caused social unrest with frequent strikes, and culminated in a series of riots (see 1981 Brixton riot, 1981 Toxteth riots). During this period, the mass of young people, deprived of the prospect of even relatively low-skill jobs that were available to the previous generations, searched for different ways to earn money in the music and entertainment businesses. The explosion of new bands and new musical styles coming from the UK in the late 1970s was a result of their efforts <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>living</b> in the economic depression that hit the country before the governments of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.|$|E
