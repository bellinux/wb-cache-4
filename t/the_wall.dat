5|$|Some Orthodox Jewish codifiers warn against {{inserting}} {{fingers into}} the cracks of <b>the</b> <b>Wall</b> as {{they believe that the}} breadth of <b>the</b> <b>Wall</b> constitutes part of the Temple Mount itself and retains holiness, while others who permit doing so claim that <b>the</b> <b>Wall</b> is located outside the Temple area.|$|E
5|$|An {{exception}} {{was made for}} Christians to participate in Christmas ceremonies in Bethlehem. Some sources claim Jews could only visit <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> if they traveled through Jordan (which {{was not an option}} for Israelis) and did not have an Israeli visa stamped in their passports. Only Jordanian soldiers and tourists were to be found there. A vantage point on Mount Zion, from which <b>the</b> <b>Wall</b> could be viewed, became the place where Jews gathered to pray. For thousands of pilgrims, the mount, being the closest location to <b>the</b> <b>Wall</b> under Israeli control, became a substitute site for the traditional priestly blessing ceremony which takes place on the Three Pilgrimage Festivals.|$|E
5|$|Battlements {{were most}} often found surmounting curtain {{walls and the}} tops of gatehouses, and {{comprised}} several elements: crenellations, hoardings, machicolations, and loopholes. Crenellation is the collective name for alternating crenels and merlons: gaps and solid blocks {{on top of a}} wall. Hoardings were wooden constructs that projected beyond <b>the</b> <b>wall,</b> allowing defenders to shoot at, or drop objects on, attackers at the base of <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> without having to lean perilously over the crenellations, thereby exposing themselves to retaliatory fire. Machicolations were stone projections on top of a wall with openings that allowed objects to be dropped on an enemy at the base of <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> in a similar fashion to hoardings.|$|E
5000|$|Local {{officials}} {{decided to}} raze <b>the</b> remaining <b>walls</b> to <b>the</b> incomplete arena in October 2009. Local residents called <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> an eyesore and mockingly referred to <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> as [...] "Stonehenge". Instead of exploding <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> and creating more rubble and cleanup, <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> were eventually lowered {{to the ground}} by C&M Road Builders and Southeast Site Development.|$|R
5000|$|The {{construction}} of <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> in <b>the</b> main roomblock is mainly stone, and <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> are generally 20-40 centimeters wide. Despite challenges presented from inadequate wall preservation and damages from pot-hunting, {{it is thought}} that brown plaster was initially covering <b>the</b> <b>walls.</b> [...] <b>The</b> interior and exterior surfaces of <b>the</b> <b>walls,</b> however, are not alike. [...] <b>The</b> interior <b>walls</b> consist of unformed limestone, sandstone, and cobbles that are laid in mortar or mud. <b>The</b> exterior <b>walls</b> are built of limestone, sandstone, and vesicular basalt as well as tabular chinking stones. In addition, <b>the</b> exterior <b>walls</b> were more uniform in their construction, while <b>the</b> interior <b>walls</b> appear to be more haphazardly or unsystematically built. This difference is helpful in determining the building sequence of each room. <b>The</b> difference in <b>wall</b> construction indicates that <b>the</b> interior <b>walls</b> were built faster than <b>the</b> exterior <b>walls.</b> <b>The</b> masonry style of <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> at Rudd Creek Pueblo is, as expected, similar to other late Tularosa phase sites.|$|R

5|$|Elara's archers, {{shooting}} from the walls, inflicted heavy casualties on the attackers, while soldiers {{on top of}} the walls prevented any attempt to breach <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> by puring down molten metal on them. The elephant Kandula, attempting to break the southern gate, was injured in such an attack. After tending to his injuries and protecting him using thick animal hides, Dutthagamani encouraged Kandula and drove him against <b>the</b> <b>wall.</b> <b>The</b> <b>wall</b> was breached and Dutthagamani's army entered the city. The ten champions, unwilling to enter through an opening made by another, destroyed <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> themselves in different places and broke into the city. Led by them, Dutthagamani's army destroyed the defenders and took control of the fortress city of Vijithapura. The survivors retreated to Anuradhapura.|$|E

5|$|From October 1928 onward, Mufti Amin al-Husayni {{organised}} {{a series}} of measures to demonstrate the Arabs' exclusive claims to the Temple Mount and its environs. He ordered new construction next to and above the Western Wall. The British granted the Arabs permission to convert a building adjoining <b>the</b> <b>Wall</b> into a mosque and to add a minaret. A muezzin was appointed to perform the Islamic call to prayer and Sufi rites directly next to <b>the</b> <b>Wall.</b> These were seen as a provocation by the Jews who prayed at <b>the</b> <b>Wall.</b> The Jews protested and tensions increased.|$|E
5|$|From the Sea of Marmara, <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> turns {{sharply to}} the northeast, {{until it reaches}} the Golden Gate, at about 14m above sea level. From there and until the Gate of Rhegion <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> follows {{a more or less}} {{straight}} line to the north, climbing the city's Seventh Hill. From there <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> turns sharply to the northeast, climbing up to the Gate of St. Romanus, located near the peak of the Seventh Hill at some 68m above sea level. From there <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> descends into the valley of the river Lycus, where it reaches its lowest point at 35m above sea level. Climbing the slope of the Sixth Hill, <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> then rises up to the Gate of Charisius or Gate of Adrianople, at some 76m height. From the Gate of Adrianople to the Blachernae, the walls fall to a level of some 60 m. From there the later walls of Blachernae project sharply to the west, reaching the coastal plain at the Golden Horn near the so-called Prisons of Anemas.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after the}} war, {{there was little}} {{interest}} in preserving <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> due to the negative memories associated with the Nazi occupation.

Some of the beach fortifications have toppled or are underwater, while the ones further inland are still mainly extant due to their location.|$|E

5|$|In the past, some {{visitors}} {{would write}} {{their names on}} <b>the</b> <b>Wall,</b> or based upon various scriptural verses, would drive nails into the crevices. These practices stopped after rabbis determined that such actions compromised the sanctity of <b>the</b> <b>Wall.</b> Another practice also existed whereby pilgrims or those intending to travel abroad would hack off a chip from <b>the</b> <b>Wall</b> or {{take some of the}} sand from between its cracks as a good luck charm or memento. In the late 19th century the question was raised as to whether this was permitted and a long responsa appeared in the Jerusalem newspaper Havatzelet in 1898. It concluded that even if according to Jewish Law it was permitted, the practices should be stopped as it constituted a desecration. More recently the Yalkut Yosef rules that it is forbidden to remove small chips of stone or dust from <b>the</b> <b>Wall,</b> although it is permissible to take twigs from the vegetation which grows in <b>the</b> <b>Wall</b> for an amulet, as they contain no holiness. Cleaning the stones is also problematic from a halachic point of view. Blasphemous graffiti once sprayed by a tourist was left visible for months until it began to peel away.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1929, the Mufti Haj Amin Al Husseinni ordered an opening be made at the {{southern}} end of the alleyway which straddled <b>the</b> <b>Wall.</b> The former cul-de-sac became a thoroughfare which led from the Temple Mount into the prayer area at <b>the</b> <b>Wall.</b> Mules were herded through the narrow alley, often dropping excrement. This, together with other construction projects in the vicinity, and restricted access to <b>the</b> <b>Wall,</b> resulted in Jewish protests to the British, who remained indifferent.|$|E
