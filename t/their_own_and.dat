5|$|During the 1970s and '80s (the main era for {{organised}} football-related violence), West Ham gained further notoriety for {{the levels}} of hooliganism in their fan base and antagonistic behaviour towards both <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>and</b> rival fans, and the police. During the '70s in particular, rival groups of West Ham fans from neighbouring areas often did battle with each other at games, most often groups from the neighbouring districts of Barking and Dagenham.|$|E

5|$|It is {{not certain}} that the slaves were a {{homogeneous}} group {{under the leadership of}} Spartacus. While this is the unspoken assumption of the Roman historians, this may be the Romans projecting their own hierarchical view of military power and responsibility on the ad hoc organization of the slaves. Certainly other slave leaders are mentioned—Crixus, Oenomaus, Gannicus, and Castus—and it cannot be told from the historical evidence whether they were aides, subordinates, or even equals leading groups of <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>and</b> traveling in convoy with Spartacus' people.|$|E
5|$|It was {{not until}} 09:00 that the 1st RUR were in {{position}} {{to carry out a}} left flanking attack on Longuerval. The village was clear of Germans so they pressed on towards Sainte-Honorine. When between the two villages, the battalion was engaged by German mortar, artillery and assault gun fire, and suffered several casualties. Two companies managed to reach Sainte-Honorine, but with no artillery fire support of <b>their</b> <b>own,</b> <b>and</b> out of radio contact with their battalion headquarters, they were forced to withdraw back to Longueval.|$|E
5|$|King Rufus, {{the leader}} of a furry race of creatures called the Gobbos, is {{watching}} the sunrise over Gobbo Valley when he sees a large, woven basket carrying a baby crocodile floating down the river. Initially suspicious of the young crocodile but ultimately won over by its innocence, King Rufus and the Gobbos decide to raise it as one of <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>and</b> teach it in the ways of the Gobbo.

5|$|The main {{criticism}} levelled at the EIHL is {{that the}} league is too expensive, an accusation given credence {{by the collapse of}} the London Racers mid season in 2005, and the continued financial problems experienced by a number of other member clubs (most notably Basingstoke Bison and Manchester Phoenix in 2008–09). Both the Edinburgh Capitals and Newcastle Vipers made public statements about their potentially perilous financial situations, casting further doubt over both <b>their</b> <b>own,</b> <b>and</b> the league's sustained viability.|$|E
5|$|Albatross chicks take a {{long time}} to fledge. In the case of the great albatrosses, it can take up to 280 days; even for the smaller albatrosses, it takes {{anywhere}} between 140 and 170 days. Like many seabirds, albatross chicks will gain enough weight to be heavier than their parents, and prior to fledging they use these reserves to build up body condition (particularly growing all their flight feathers), usually fledging at the same weight as their parents. Between 15% and 65% of those fledged survive to breed. Albatross chicks fledge on <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>and</b> receive no further help from their parents, who return to the nest after fledging, unaware their chick has left. Studies of juveniles dispersing at sea have suggested an innate migration behaviour, a genetically coded navigation route, which helps young birds when they are first out at sea.|$|E
5|$|Construction of {{the system}} began in May 1998. The {{majority}} {{of the system}} was built one span at a time, with cranes mounted on temporary structures erecting new spans as they progressed along the structures. However, some sections were built using a balanced cantilever design, where spans were first built on <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>and</b> then connected to each other using the span-by-span method. The fact that the Jamaica branch had {{to be built in}} the middle of the Van Wyck Expressway, combined with the varying length and curves of the track spans, caused complications during construction. One lane in each direction was closed during the off-peak hours, causing congestion on the Van Wyck.|$|E

5|$|Director Michael Mayer {{heard the}} album and {{expressed}} an interest in adapting it for the stage. When he approached the band regarding a collaboration, they agreed to work with him. The band also gave Mayer a wide latitude for his adaptation after seeing his earlier work in Spring Awakening. Though additional songs were included from the Green Day catalog, Mayer added very little dialogue to the show. He felt instead that the music and lyrics were expressive enough on <b>their</b> <b>own,</b> <b>and</b> even removed some of the dialogue {{that was part of the}} Berkeley production before the show moved to Broadway.|$|E
5|$|Following a {{civil war}} in the Arab Empire the Umayyads came to power under Muawiyah I. Under the Umayyads the conquest of the {{remaining}} Byzantine and northern Berber territories in North Africa was completed and the Arabs were able to move across large parts of the Berber world, invading Visigothic Spain through the Strait of Gibraltar, under the command of the allegedly Berber general Tariq ibn-Ziyad. But this happened only after they developed a naval power of <b>their</b> <b>own,</b> <b>and</b> they conquered and destroyed the Byzantine stronghold of Carthage between 695698. The loss of Africa meant that soon, Byzantine control of the Western Mediterranean was challenged by a new and expanding Arab fleet, operating from Tunisia.|$|E

They released 386BSD via an anonymous FTP server. The development flow of 386BSD was slow and after a period of neglect, a group of 386BSD users decided to branch out on <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>and</b> create FreeBSD so that they could keep the operating system up to date.

5|$|Modern {{linguists}} divide Celtic languages {{into two}} major groups: the P-Celtic, {{from which the}} Brythonic languages– Welsh, Breton, Cornish and Cumbric derive– and the Q-Celtic, from which come the Goidelic languages– Irish, Manx and Gaelic. The Pictish language remains enigmatic, since the Picts had no written script of <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>and</b> all that survives are place names and some isolated inscriptions in Irish ogham script. Most modern linguists accept that, although the nature and unity of Pictish language is unclear, it belonged to the former group. Historical sources, as well as place-name evidence, indicate {{the ways in which}} the Pictish language in the north and Cumbric languages in the south were overlaid and replaced by Gaelic, Old English and later Norse in this period. By the High Middle Ages the majority of people within Scotland spoke the Gaelic language, then simply called Scottish, or in Latin, lingua Scotica.|$|E
