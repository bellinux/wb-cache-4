50|$|The {{ecological}} {{situation of}} the lake is in bad state. It is polluted with waste from surrounding businesses. According to the Ministry of Ecology, about 18 <b>thousand</b> <b>m3</b> of industrial and communal waste is disposed to the lake. One of the main sources of pollution is the oil waste waters from oil exploration and production boom of the 1930s. The first oil storage reservoir was built near the lake in 1866. In 2004, the ecological state of the lake was placed in extremely poor category. Additionally, the construction works which started with drying out of the lake caused more pollution for {{the residents of the}} area. The strong winds of Baku create dust from the sand transported to the lake location to dry the lake. Expert have also alleged that while dehydrating the lake, sediments spread by the wind will cause more ecological problems.|$|E
