25|$|Because {{the award}} of the medal {{had to be}} applied for, it was not awarded posthumously. The {{next-of-kin}} of members {{who had been killed}} in action or who had died while on service therefore received no medal. The published medal roll shows that 5,252 medals were awarded to 5,156 individuals, which included 96 duplicate or <b>triplicate</b> awards. Nearly half of the awards, to 2,422 individuals, were for the Bechuanaland campaign.|$|E

25|$|In the past, these medical reports {{consisted}} of very abbreviated handwritten notes that were {{added in the}} patient's file for interpretation by the primary physician responsible for the treatment. Ultimately, this mess of handwritten notes and typed reports were consolidated into a single patient file and physically stored along with thousands of other patient records in a wall of filing cabinets in the medical records department. Whenever the need arose to review the records of a specific patient, the patient's file would be retrieved from the filing cabinet and delivered to the requesting physician. To enhance this manual process, many medical record documents were produced in duplicate or <b>triplicate</b> by means of carbon copy.|$|E
25|$|Although {{intended}} as a one-off story focusing on Superboy, the Legion proved so popular that it returned for an encore in Adventure Comics #267 (December 1959). In this story, Lightning Boy had been renamed Lightning Lad, and their costumes were very close to those they wore throughout the Silver Age of Comic Books. The Legion's popularity grew, and they appeared in further stories in Adventure Comics, Action Comics, and other titles edited by Mort Weisinger {{over the next few}} years. The ranks of the Legion, only hinted at in those first two stories, was filled with new heroes such as Chameleon Boy, Invisible Kid, Colossal Boy, Star Boy, Brainiac 5, <b>Triplicate</b> Girl, Shrinking Violet, Sun Boy, Bouncing Boy, Phantom Girl, and Ultra Boy. Even Supergirl was recruited as a member.|$|E
25|$|Big Show has {{appeared}} {{in each of the}} Smackdown vs. Raw video games except Smackdown vs. Raw 2008; his character has changed in appearance beginning at WWE Smackdown vs. Raw 2010, the basis of this change was that the developers for THQ {later 2K Sports} focused on his physical frame to develop him as a super heavyweight. Big Show has been involved in most of the 2k Showcases and historical stories starting with WWE '13. Big Show {{has been used as a}} duplicate in WWE '13, WWE 2K15, WWE 2K16, WWE 2K17 and WWE 2K18. He is also as a <b>triplicate</b> in WWE 2K14 as Big Show, Big Show (Retro) and The Giant (whose picture is credited as Paul Wight in WWE 2K16).

25|$|Some early Kadamba Dynasty coins {{bearing the}} Kannada {{inscription}} Vira and Skandha {{were found in}} Satara collectorate. A gold coin bearing three inscriptions of Sri and an abbreviated inscription of king Bhagiratha's name called bhagi (c. AD 390–420) in old Kannada exists. A Kadamba copper coin dated to the 5th century AD with the inscription Srimanaragi in Kannada script was discovered in Banavasi, Uttara Kannada district. Coins with Kannada legends have been discovered spanning {{the rule of the}} Western Ganga Dynasty, the Badami Chalukyas, the Alupas, the Western Chalukyas, the Rashtrakutas, the Hoysalas, the Vijayanagar Empire, the Kadamba Dynasty of Banavasi, the Keladi Nayakas and the Mysore Kingdom, the Badami Chalukya coins being a recent discovery. The coins of the Kadambas of Goa are unique in that they have alternate inscription of the king's name in Kannada and Devanagari in <b>triplicate,</b> a few coins of the Kadambas of Hangal are also available.|$|E
25|$|To {{ensure the}} pCas9cr4 plasmid was first {{successfully}} {{admitted to the}} cells, the cells were grown on a plate containing chloramphenicol; the pCas9cr4 plasmid contained the gene cmr, conferring resistance to chloramphenicol, which ensured only the successful recombinants grew. <b>Triplicate</b> plates of 10μL of recovered cultures as well as dilutions of 10−1, 10−2, and 10−3 were then spotted and incubated overnight at 30°C and CFU, or colony forming unit, assessments were then made to identify successful mutants using the miniaturized plating method described previously. Once the mutation of interest was screened using overnight growth on M9 minimal medium plates supplemented with glycerol, chloroacetate and SOC (super optimal broth with catabolite repression), colonies were patched onto selective plates using a toothpick and incubated at 30°C for two nights. After sufficient colony growth, cells were transfected with the pKDsg-XXX plasmid containing the aada gene, {{and as a result}} were resistant to the aminoglycosides spectinomycin and streptomycin. To ensure that the pKDsg-XXX plasmid was successfully admitted to the cells, the cells were grown on a plate containing both chloramphenicol and spectinomycin to select for cells containing both the pCas9cr4 and pKDsg-XXX plasmids.|$|E
500|$|On March 31, 2017, Dylan {{released}} his triple album, <b>Triplicate,</b> comprising 30 new recordings of classic American songs, including [...] "As Time Goes By" [...] by Herman Hupfeld and [...] "Stormy Weather" [...] by Harold Arlen and Ted Koehler. Dylan's 38th studio album {{was recorded in}} Hollywood's Capitol Studios and features his touring band. Dylan posted a long interview on his website to promote the album, and was asked if this material was an exercise in nostalgia. [...] "Nostalgic? No I wouldn’t say that. It’s not taking a trip down memory lane or longing and yearning for {{the good old days}} or fond memories of what’s no more. A song like [...] "Sentimental Journey" [...] is not a way back when song, it doesn’t emulate the past, it’s attainable and down to earth, it’s in the here and now." [...] The album was awarded a score of 84 on critical aggregator website Metacritic, signifying [...] "universal acclaim". Critics praised the thoroughness of Dylan's exploration of the great American songbook, though, in the opinion of Uncut: [...] "For all its easy charms, <b>Triplicate</b> labours its point to the brink of overkill. After five albums' worth of croon toons, this feels like a fat full stop on a fascinating chapter." ...|$|E

2500|$|Abe {{was born}} on March 7, 1924 in Kita, Tokyo, Japan {{and grew up in}} Mukden (now Shenyang) in Manchuria.
