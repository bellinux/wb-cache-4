40|$|Abstract: Tupaias, or tree shrews, {{are small}} mammals {{that are similar}} in {{appearance}} to squirrels. The morphological and behavioral characteristics of the group have been extensively characterized, and despite previously being classified as primates, recent studies have placed the group in its own family, the <b>Tupaiidae.</b> Genomic analysis has revealed that the genus Tupaia is closer to humans {{than it is to}} rodents. In addition, tupaias are susceptible to hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus. The only other experimental animal that has been demonstrated to be sensitive to both of these viruses is the chimpanzee, but restrictions on animal testing have meant that experiments using chimpanzees have become almost impossible. Consequently, the development of the tupaia for use as an animal infection model could become a powerful tool for hepatitis virus research and in preclinical studies on drug development...|$|E
40|$|A {{study on}} the {{relative}} abundance and diversity of small mammals were conducted in three different vegetations in Kelantan. The three different vegetations were durian orchard, regenerated forest and disturbed forest. The collapsible cage traps were used to trap non-volant small mammals. A total of 444 trap-nights for all sites resulted in capture of 30 individuals from three different families. Capture rate for Muridae was 70 percent followed by, 3. 33 percent Sciuridae and 26. 67 percent <b>Tupaiidae.</b> In this study five species were identified; Tupaia glis (eight individuals), Callosciurus caniceps (one individuals), Rattus rattus (nine individuals), R. tiomanicus (nine individuals) and Maxomys surfer (three individuals). The capture rate at the durian orchard was four percent whereas the regenerated forest and disturbed forest had eight percent capture rate. Shannon index, H' shows that the highest diversity was at regenerated forest (1. 3182), followed by disturbed forest (1. 2597) and durian orchard (1. 0986). Pielau's evenness index showed that the vegetation with the most evenness was durian forest (1. 0), followed by regenerated forest (0. 9509) and disturbed forest (0. 9087).

40|$|The longstanding {{debate on}} the taxonomic status of Tupaia belangeri (<b>Tupaiidae,</b> Scandentia, Mammalia) has persisted in times of {{molecular}} biology and genetics. But way beyond that Tupaia belangeri {{has turned out to}} be a valuable and widely accepted animal model for studies in neurobiology, stress research, and virology, among other topics. It is thus a privilege to have the opportunity to provide an overview on selected aspects of neural development and neuroanatomy in Tupaia belangeri on the occasion of this special issue dedicated to Hans-Jürg Kuhn. Firstly, emphasis will be given to the optic system. We report rather "unconventional" findings on the morphogenesis of photoreceptor cells, and on the presence of capillary-contacting neurons in the tree shrew retina. Thereafter, network formation among directionally selective retinal neurons and optic chiasm development are discussed. We then address the main and accessory olfactory systems, the terminal nerve, the pituitary gland, and the cerebellum of Tupaia belangeri. Finally, we demonstrate how innovative 3 -D reconstruction techniques helped to decipher and interpret so-far-undescribed, strictly spatiotemporally regulated waves of apoptosis and proliferation which pass through the early developing forebrain and eyes, midbrain and hindbrain, and through the panplacodal primordium which gives rise to all ectodermal placodes. Based on examples, this paper additionally wants to show how findings gained from the reported projects have influenced current neuroembryological and, at least partly, medical research...|$|E
40|$|Urbanization has {{paved the}} way for the spread of {{commensal}} rodents at global scale. However, it is largely unknown how these species use tropical anthropogenic landscapes originally covered with forests and inhabited by diverse small mammal assemblages. We surveyed non-flying small mammals in various urban and suburban habitat types and adjacent forest in the tropical town of Kota Kinabalu in Borneo. We used occupancy and polynomial regression models to determine variation in species occurrences along gradients of land-use intensity. Müller’s sundamys (Sundamys muelleri) was the only native small mammal species found in urban and suburban landscapes with a continuous decrease in occurrence probability from forests to urban habitats. The invasive Asian black rat (Rattus rattus species complex) and the invasive Asian house shrew (Suncus murinus) had the highest occurrence probabilities in habitats of intermediate land-use intensity, but Asian black rats are also likely to occasionally invade forested habitats and occupied urban habitats in sympatry with the Norway rat (Rattus norvegicus). In urban and suburban habitats, fallow land possibly favoured the occurrence of S. muelleri and S. murinus. Other native small mammal species (Muridae, Sciuridae, <b>Tupaiidae)</b> were found only in forested areas. Our study shows that native small mammals found in forest are largely replaced by invasive species in urban and suburban habitats. Due to their occurrence in habitats of various land use intensities, S. muelleri and R. rattus comprise central links between forest wildlife and urban species, an association that is important to consider in studies of parasite and disease transmission dynamics.

40|$|The ethmoidal {{region of}} the skull houses {{one of the most}} {{important}} sense organs of mammals, the sense of smell. Investigation of the ontogeny and comparative anatomy of internal nasal structures of the macrosmatic order Scandentia is a significant contribution to the understanding of the morphotype of Scandentia with potential implications for our understanding of the primate nasal morphological pattern. For the first time perinatal and adult stages of Ptilocercus lowii and selected Tupaia species were investigated by serial histological sections and high-resolution computed tomography (μCT), respectively. Scandentia show a very common olfactory turbinal pattern of small mammals in having two frontoturbinals, three ethmoturbinals, and one interturbinal between the first and second ethmoturbinal. This indicates a moderately developed sense of smell (moderately macrosmatic). The observed septoturbinal is probably an apomorphic character of Scandentia. A general growth in length occurs during postnatal ontogeny; thus the adult ethmoidal region is proportionally longer compared to the rest of the skull. Throughout ontogeny Ptilocercus has a proportionally longer nasal cavity than Tupaia. Major differences exist between Ptilocercus and Tupaia in regard to the proportions of the nasal cavity which correlate with the position of the orbits. Compared to Tupaia, Ptilocercus shows more anteriorly oriented orbits and has a proportionally longer nasal capsule than Tupaia and based on anatomy probably a higher level of olfactory discrimination. Furthermore, Ptilocercus has a platybasic skull base that resembles a derived feature of Ptilocercidae. In contrast, Tupaia has a distinct septum interorbitale leading to a tropibasic skull, a pattern that is a plesiomorphic character of <b>Tupaiidae</b> and Scandentia in general. This finding helps us to understand the septum interorbitale pattern in Primates. Our results indicate that differences among the investigated Scandentia species are correlated with adaptations to foraging and behavioural biology...|$|E
40|$|The {{gustatory}} {{responses of}} nine compounds, namely glycine, D-phenylalanine, D-tryptophan, cyanosuosan, magapame, sucrononate, campame, cyclamate and superaspartame, all known as sweet in man, were studied in 41 species or subspecies of non-human primates, selected among Prosimii (Lemuridae and Lorisidae), Platyrrhini (Callitrichidae and Cebidae) and Catarrhini (Cercopithecidae, Hylobatidae and Pongidae). The first six compounds are generally sweet to all primates, which implies that {{they interact with}} the primate sweetness receptors essentially through constant recognition sites. Campame is sweet only to Cebidae and Catarrhini, cyclamate only to Catarrhini, superaspartame principally to Callitrichidae and Catarrhini, which implies that all these compounds interact with the receptors partly through variable recognition sites. From the present work, from other previous results (where notably {{it was observed that}} alitame is sweet to all primates, ampame only to Prosimii and Catarrhini, and aspartame only to Catarrhini), and from the multipoint attachment (MPA) theory of sweetness reception (as elaborated by Nofre and Tinti from a detailed study of structure-activity relationships of various sweeteners in man), it is inferred that the primate sweetness receptors are very likely made up of eight recognition sites, of which the first, second, third, fourth, seventh and eighth are constant, and the fifth and sixth variable. From these results and from the MPA theory, it is also inferred that the recognition sites of the primate sweetness receptors could be: Asp- 1 or Glu- 1, Lys- 2, Asp- 3 or Glu- 3, Thr- 4, X- 5, X- 6, Thr- 7, Ser- 8, where the variable recognition sites X- 5 and X- 6 would be: Ala- 5 and Ala- 6 for Callitrichidae, Ser- 5 and Ala- 6 for Cebidae, Ala- 5 and Thr- 6 for Prosimii, and Thr- 5 and Thr- 6 for Catarrhini. By using <b>Tupaiidae</b> (tree shrews) as a reference outgroup and by means of other structural and functional molecular considerations, it appears that Callitrichidae have retained the most primitive receptor among the four types of primate receptors. The possible taxonomic and phylogenetic implications of these findings are discussed. Chem. Senses 21 : 747 - 762, 199...|$|E
40|$|Multiple unlinked genetic loci {{often provide}} a more {{comprehensive}} picture of evolutionary history than any single gene can, but analyzing multigene data presents particular challenges. Differing rates and patterns of nucleotide substitution, combined with the limited information available in any data set, can {{make it difficult to}} specify a model of evolution. In addition, conflict among loci can be the result of real differences in evolutionary process or of stochastic variance and errors in reconstruction. We used 6 presumably unlinked nuclear loci to investigate relationships within the mammalian family <b>Tupaiidae</b> (Scandentia), containing {{all but one of the}} extant tupaiid genera. We used a phylogenetic mixture model to analyze the concatenated data and compared this with results using partitioned models. We found that more complex models were not necessarily preferred under tests using Bayes factors and that model complexity affected both tree length and parameter variance. We also compared the results of single-gene and multigene analyses and used splits networks to analyze the source and degree of conflict among genes. Networks can show specific relationships that are inconsistent with each other; these conflicting and minority relationships, which are implicitly ignored or collapsed by traditional consensus methods, can be useful in identifying the underlying causes of topological uncertainty. In our data, conflict is concentrated around particular relationships, not widespread throughout the tree. This pattern is further clarified by considering conflict surrounding the root separately from conflict within the ingroup. Uncertainty in rooting may be because of the apparent evolutionary distance separating these genera and our outgroup, the tupaiid genus Dendrogale. Unlike a previous mitochondrial study, these nuclear data strongly suggest that the genus Tupaia is not monophyletic with respect to the monotypic Urogale, even when uncertainty about rooting is taken into account. These data concur with mitochondrial DNA on other relationships, including the close affinity of Tupaia tana with the enigmatic Tupaia splendidula and of Tupaia belangeri with Tupaia glis. We also discuss the taxonomic and biogeographic implications of these results...|$|E
40|$|Aim: Small mammals were live-trapped in {{a primary}} rain forest to {{evaluate}} the relative distribution of species {{to each other and}} to microhabitat properties on the ground and in the canopy. Location: Kinabalu National Park in Borneo, Sabah, Malaysia. Methods: Seven trapping sessions were conducted along two grids with 31 trap points at distances of 20 m on the ground and in the lower canopy at an average height of 13. 5 m. Results: Species diversity and abundance of small mammals proved to be high: 20 species of the families Muridae, Sciuridae, <b>Tupaiidae,</b> Hystricidae, Viverridae and Lorisidae were trapped, with murids being dominant in both habitat layers. The terrestrial community was significantly more diverse with 16 captured species (Shannon-Wiener's diversity index H 0 terr 1 / 4 2. 47), while 11 species were trapped in the canopy (H 0 arb 1 / 4 1. 59). The Whitehead's rat, Maxomys whiteheadi, and the red spiny rat, Maxomys surifer, dominated the terrestrial community whereas the large pencil-tailed tree mouse, Chiropodomys major, was by far the most abundant species in the canopy. Other abundant species of the canopy community, the dark-tailed tree rat, Niviventer cremoriventer, and the lesser treeshrew, Tupaia minor, were also abundant on the ground, and there was no clear boundary between arboreal and terrestrial species occurrences. Main conclusions: As most species were not confined to specific microhabitats or habitat layers, species seemed to rely on resources not necessarily restricted to certain microhabitats or habitat layers, and separation of species probably resulted mainly from a species' concentrated activity in a preferred microhabitat rather than from principal adaptations to certain habitats. Ecological segregation was stronger in the more diverse terrestrial community, though microhabitat selection was generally not sufficient to explain the co-occurrences of species and the variability between local species assemblages. Constraints on small mammal foraging efficiency in the three-dimensional more complex canopy may be responsible for the similarity of microhabitat use of all common arboreal species. Community composition was characterized by mobile species with low persistence rates, resulting in a high degree of variability in local species assemblages with similar turnover rates in both habitats.

40|$|Treeshrews (order Scandentia) {{comprise}} 2 {{families of}} squirrel-sized terrestrial, arboreal, and scansorial mammals distributed {{throughout much of}} tropical South and Southeast Asia. The last comprehensive taxonomic revision of treeshrews was published in 1913, and a well-supported phylogeny clarifying relationships among all currently recognized extant species within the order has only recently been published. Within the family <b>Tupaiidae,</b> 2 widely distributed species, the northern treeshrew, Tupaia belangeri (Wagner, 1841), and the common treeshrew, T. glis (Diard, 1820), represent a particularly vexing taxonomic complex. These 2 species are currently distinguished primarily based on their respective distributions {{north and south of}} the Isthmus of Kra on the Malay Peninsula and on their different mammae counts. This problematic species complex includes 54 published synonyms, many of which represent putative island endemics. The widespread T. glis and T. belangeri collectively comprise a monophyletic assemblage representing the sister lineage to a clade composed of the golden-bellied treeshrew, T. chrysogaster Miller, 1903 (Mentawai Islands), and the long-footed treeshrew, T. longipes (Thomas, 1893) (Borneo). As part of a morphological investigation of the T. glis–T. belangeri complex, we studied the proportions of hand bones, which have previously been shown to be useful in discriminating species of soricids (true shrews). We measured 38 variables from digital X-ray images of 148 museum study skins representing several subspecies of T. glis, T. belangeri, T. chrysogaster, and T. longipes and analyzed these data using principal components and cluster analyses. Manus proportions among these 4 species readily distinguish them, particularly in the cases of T. chrysogaster and T. longipes. We then tested the distinctiveness of several of the populations comprising T. glis and T. longipes. T. longipes longipes and T. l. salatana Lyon, 1913, are distinguishable from each other, and populations of T. ‘‘glis’’ from Bangka Island and Sumatra are distinct from those on the Malay Peninsula, supporting the recognition of T. salatana, T. discolor Lyon, 1906, and T. ferruginea Raffles, 1821 as distinct species in Indonesia. These relatively small, potentially vulnerable treeshrew populations occur in the Sundaland biodiversity hotspot and will require additional study to determine their appropriate conservation status...|$|E
40|$|The {{function}} of {{the central nervous system}} cannot be understood from inspection of a single region, for each cell and fiber has discrete connections. Therefore, a study of the nervous system requires distinct approaches. One fundamental approach has been the study of comparative neuroanatomy. In a comparative study of the evolution of the primates and subsequently man, the investigator is confronted with a variety of animal forms. Each form represents an end product of a long vertical line of evolutionary development. The problem is to try to reconstruct the vertical line (ancestral forms) from the horizontal end products (extant forms). The order Primates has two suborders: (1) the Prosimii - composed of six families - <b>Tupaiidae,</b> Lemuridae, Indriidae, Daubentoniidae, Lorisidae, and Tarsiidae and (2) the Anthropoidea - also composed of six families including the Old and New World monkeys, the great apes and man. One group of the suborder Prosimii is the family Lorisidae. The living members of the family are represented by the lorises of India and Southeast Asia and the galagoes and pottos of Africa. Characters these animals share with the higher anthropoid primates are seen in the osteology of the middle ear and the medial wall of the orbit (Le Gros Clark, 1959). They also have orbits encircled by bone, three kinds of teeth, a well developed caecum, true nails and a pseudo-opposable thumb. In habit, these animals are omnivorous, nocturnal and arboreal. In progression, the lorisoids are less tied to the quadrupedalism of many lemurs (Osman Hill, 1953). The lorises have a slow deliberate mode of hand-over-hand locomotion, their limbs are subequal in length. In contrast, the galagos locomote by a rapid, saltatory behavior and have pelvic limbs much longer than pectoral limbs. Both of these means of progression effect an orthograde (erect or semi-erect) posture of the trunk and a tendency for a different mode of balancing the head on the spine. Some authors regard the vertical clinging and leaping of galagos as the earliest locomotor specialization of primates (Napier and Walker, 1967; Napier, 1967). From the post-cranial osteology of early Miocene Lorisidae (Walker, 1970) and from a comparative osteological, behavioral and paleontological study (Napier and Walker, 1967), it appears that this locomotor pattern was present in early Eocene and subsequent Miocene prosimians. These authors conclude that vertical clinging and leaping is the earliest known primate locomotor specialization and preadaptive to some or possibly all subsequent patterns of primate progression—quadrupedalism, brachiation and bipedalism. Although comparative neuroanatomical investigations have utilized the anthropoid primates, (mainly Macaca) rodents and carnivores (chiefly the cat), the prosimian primates have been relatively ignored. Yet their locomotor behavior and their propensity toward bipedalism make them an interesting model for a study of central nervous pathways related to locomotion...|$|E
