25|$|In spring, {{our women}} {{harvested}} the supple, young shoots to make baskets. Our men fashioned the wood into pipe stems, emergency snowshoes, snares, wooden nails, whistles for the children, beading looms, and frames for stretching hides. Rotted willow wood {{was used to}} smoke hides. Green willow branches were burned to smoke meat. We twisted the inner bark fibers into temporary rope, <b>twine</b> <b>and</b> fish <b>nets.</b> We weather proofed rawhide by wrapping it in willow bark. We used willow branches as lathing for our houses. Our men scraped off the inner cambium layer and added other ingredients, such as bearberry, to make a smoking mixture, ‘Kinnikinick’. We repaired our carts, made a shelter when we were caught in a storm, burned for fuel and had {{a variety of other}} practical uses for the wood of the willow.|$|R
40|$|Many {{technical}} measures {{aimed at the}} conservation and recovery of fish stocks {{are based on the}} implementation of minimum mesh sizes to guarantee a certain level of fishing gear selectivity. At present, different methods are used to measure mesh opening, according to whether the measurement serves fisheries inspection, fisheries research or the manufacturing of netting for fishing nets. At the very least, this causes confusion but can also have more serious consequences such as the criminalization of well intentioned fishermen or the setting of inappropriate mesh size regulations. For example, the measurements made by fishery inspectors using the wedge gauge are generally larger than those made by scientists using the ICES gauge. As a result the cod-ends used by fishermen to satisfy the fishery inspectors will have a selectivity lower than that anticipated by the scientists who provided the advice that informed the relevant legislation. In 1999, owing to the wider range of <b>twines</b> <b>and</b> <b>netting</b> materials used by the fishing industry, ICES established the Study Group on Mesh Measurement Methodology (SGMESH) to refine mesh measurement procedures. At the same time the different stakeholders agreed that there was a need to consider the adoption of a standard mesh measurement method. A major step in the standardization of mesh measurement methodologies was {{the development of a new}} standard mesh gauge (2002 - 2005). In October 2005, it was adopted by ICES as the new standard for mesh measurements and in June 2006 the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization (NAFO) recommended its use for scientific purposes. This review paper critically examines the different mesh measurement methodologies and their related problems, and introduces and describes a new objective mesh gauge (OMEGA) to replace the former less satisfactory gauges. Its adoption will result in researchers, fisheries inspectors <b>and</b> the <b>netting</b> industry using one standard gauge and one set of standard protocols to achieve consistent mesh-size measurements...|$|R

A summary of the results is shown below. (1) Current velocity measured at the inside of the net was 76 - 87 % of that at the net mouth. The acceleration of current velocity, observable in {{the previous}} experiments, was not observed. (2) The ratio between the velocity at the inside of the <b>net</b> <b>and</b> that at the net mouth was expressed in the theoretical formula (showing Fig. 4). [The formula is omitted. ...|$|R
40|$|After {{several years}} of surveys on the Kainji Lake {{fisheries}} activities by the Nigerian German Kainji Lake Fish promotion Project (KLFPP) trends regarding catches, yield and other parameter begin to emerge. However, {{it became obvious that}} some of the data were not quite as accurate as they were believed to be. Looking at the different editions of the statistical bulletin of Kainji Lake, concerning one given fisheries parameter, sometimes it is possible to reveal inconsistencies and unexplained trends. As compared to the survey method, PRA is primarily for analysis of differences in local phenomenon and processes. Therefore, PRA was used as a complementary tool to enhance the knowledge on issues like fisher women, entrepreneurs, gear ownership structure, mode of operation by owners of large gear number, preference in the use of <b>twine</b> <b>and</b> nylon gill <b>nets,</b> <b>and</b> reasons for misinformation on the number of fishing equipment owned by entrepreneurs, which cannot be done with frame survey. PRA techniques like timeline, mapping, seasonal calendar, transect walk and key informant interviews were utilized in the study proces...|$|R
40|$|Plants were an {{important}} source of raw materials for many types of cloth in Europe during the Neolithic. On the basis of evidence from waterlogged sites, the most significant raw materials were flax and tree bast, which were used to create woven textiles, <b>twined</b> cloth <b>and</b> <b>netting.</b> Looking towards the investigation of cloth in social anthropology, I propose that issues of time and place are a significant aspect of the social context of cloth. The aim {{of this paper is to}} investigate these issues in relation to processing cloth from plants, through a case study of the Neolithic lake dwelling of Hornstaad Hörnle IA on Lake Constance, Germany, dated c. 3900 BC. Building on recent research into the way these cloth types were processed and constructed in the Neolithic, I use the evidence at Hornstaad Hörnle IA to consider the location of these tasks in the home, village and wider landscape, as temporal aspects carried out daily, seasonally or over a number of years and in relation to the lives of members of the village. Through this I hope to show how the methods of processing cloth were not only a technical solution to satisfy the need for various types of cloth, but were part of the way that people’s lives were created and made meaningful...|$|R
