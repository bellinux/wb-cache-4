5|$|As {{the glaciers}} of the Wisconsin {{glaciation}} began to recede from <b>the</b> <b>Hudson</b> Valley area, a glacial lake {{known today as}} Lake Albany extended across the mid and upper Hudson Valley and a large delta formed west of Albany where the predecessor of the Mohawk River flowed into the lake. Along the shoreline of the lake, lacustrine sands were deposited between the present-day cities of Hudson and Glens Falls; this became <b>the</b> <b>Hudson</b> Valley sandplain. Relieved from {{the weight of the}} glacier, the land began to rebound, and the lake receded by draining into <b>the</b> <b>Hudson</b> River. The deposits of sand in the delta area were gradually sculpted by wind into sand dunes. Plants later colonized the land and stabilized the dunes. The Pine Bush originally occupied , or 60,000 acres, at which point it was the largest inland pine barrens in North America.|$|E

5|$|Despite this {{emerging}} competition, natural ice remained vital to North American and European economies, with demand driven up by rising living standards. The huge demand for {{ice in the}} 1880s drove the natural ice trade to continue to expand. Around four million tons (four billion kg) of ice was routinely stored along <b>the</b> <b>Hudson</b> River and Maine alone, <b>the</b> <b>Hudson</b> having around 135 major warehouses along its banks and employing 20,000 workers. Firms expanded along the Kennebec River in Maine to meet the demand, and 1,735 vessels were required in 1880 to carry the ice south. Lakes in Wisconsin began {{to be put into}} production to supply the Midwest. 1890 saw another ice famine hit the east: <b>the</b> <b>Hudson</b> harvests failed entirely, causing a sudden rush by entrepreneurs to establish operations in Maine, where ice had successfully formed. Unfortunately for investors, the following summer was quite cool, suppressing demand for stocks and many businessmen were ruined. Across the U.S., an estimated 90,000 people and 25,000 horses involved in a trade capitalised at $28 million ($660 million in 2010 terms).|$|E
