40|$|We have {{reported}} SiC integrated circuits (IC's) with {{two levels of}} metal interconnect that have demonstrated prolonged operation for thousands of hours at their intended peak ambient operational temperature of 500 C [1, 2]. However, it is recognized that testing of semiconductor microelectronics at temperatures above their designed operating envelope is vital to qualification. Towards this end, we previously reported operation of a 4 H-SiC JFET IC ring oscillator on an initial fast <b>thermal</b> <b>ramp</b> test through 727 C [3]. However, this <b>thermal</b> <b>ramp</b> was not ended until a peak temperature of 880 C (well beyond failure) was attained. Further experiments are necessary to better understand failure mechanisms and upper temperature limit of this extreme-temperature capable 4 H-SiC IC technology. Here we report on additional experimental testing of custom-packaged 4 H-SiC JFET IC devices at temperatures above 500 C. In one test, the temperature was ramped and then held at 727 C, and the devices were periodically measured until electrical failure was observed. A 4 H-SiC JFET on this chip electrically functioned with little change for around 25 hours at 727 C before rapid increases in device resistance caused failure. In a second test, devices from our next generation 4 H-SiC JFET ICs were ramped up and then held at 700 C (which is below the maximum deposition temperature of the dielectrics). Three ring oscillators functioned for 8 hours at this temperature before degradation. In a third experiment, an alternative die attach of gold paste and package lid was used, and logic circuit operation was demonstrated for 143. 5 hours at 700 C...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{effect of}} thermal profile on {{microstructure}} is {{studied in the}} frame of thin films deposited by inkjet-printing technology. The role of sintering temperature and <b>thermal</b> <b>ramp</b> is particularly investigated. Fast heating ramps exhibit coarse grains and pores, especially when a hybrid microwave curing is performed. This enhanced growth is attributed to the quick activation of densifying sintering regimes without undergoing thermal energy loss at low temperature. Microstructural evolution of various sintered inkjet-printed films is correlated with electrical resistivity and with the Young's modulus determined by nanoindentation. A strong link between those three parameters is highlighted during experiments giving credit to either a surface or a fully volumetric sintering, according to the process.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Apolipoprotein E (APOE) is an {{important}} element of lipid metabolism and, hence, cardiovascular disorders. APOE has 3 main allelic variants: epsilon 3, epsilon 4, and epsilon 2. Of these, epsilon 3 is the most common, followed by epsilon 4 and epsilon 2. The associations of these isoforms with cardiovascular disorders and Alzheimer disease have been widely studied in different populations. Most of the genotyping in these studies has been performed with gel-based methods, which have important limitations, particularly for large epidemiologic studies. We therefore developed an integrated "one-tube" liquid-phase assay. METHODS: To measure APOE isoforms, we developed an integrated single-label liquid-phase fluorescence assay containing 2 PCR primers, 2 probes, and 2 quencher oligonucleotides. We used a 384 -well LightTyper, but the assay would be generically applicable for use with any fluorescence detector with <b>thermal</b> <b>ramp</b> control. We validated this method and applied it in the British Women's Heart and Health Study. RESULTS: There were 4 melting peaks, at 41, 56, 61, and 69 degrees C, which generated 6 distinctive patterns representing genotypic combinations of epsilon 3, epsilon 4, and epsilon 2. The magnitude and direction of the associations found with total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, and estimated LDL-cholesterol were consistent with previous reports. CONCLUSION: The one-tube LightTyper assay presented here enables accurate, convenient, and economical genotyping of APOE and can be used for large epidemiologic studie...|$|E

A standard positive phenolic photoresist was deposited over a silicon wafer and heated in an inert atmosphere at rates in excess of 140 °C/min up to a temperature of 1000 °C. An annealing step of 1 h at that temperature was required to obtain a more complete graphitization of the resist and thus improve its electrochemical response. The PPF synthesized by this rapid thermal process showed {{one of the lowest}} resistivities reported to date for this kind of material (ca. 4 - 6 × 10 - 3 ωcm) but was slightly rougher than the PPF synthesized using slower <b>thermal</b> <b>ramps</b> (1. 6 vs 0. 5 nm).

40|$|Proper {{assessment}} of environmental resistance of animals {{is critical for}} the ability of researchers to understand how variation in environmental conditions influence population and species abundance. This {{is also the case}} for studies of upper thermal limits in insects, where researchers studying animals under laboratory conditions must select appropriate methodology on which conclusions can be drawn. Ideally these methods should precisely estimate the trait of interest and also be biological meaningful. In an attempt to develop such tests it has been proposed that <b>thermal</b> <b>ramping</b> assays are useful assays for small insects because they incorporate an ecologically relevant gradual temperature change. However, recent model-based papers have suggested that estimates of thermal resistance may be strongly confounded by simultaneous starvation and dehydration stress. In the present study we empirically test these model predictions using two sets of independent experiments. We clearly demonstrate that results from ramping assays of small insects (Drosophila melanogaster) are not compromised by starvation- or dehydration-stress. Firstly we show that the mild disturbance of water and energy balance of D. melanogaster experienced during the ramping tests does not confound heat tolerance estimates. Secondly we show that flies pre-exposed to starvation and dehydration have "normal" heat tolerance and that resistance to heat stress is independent of the energetic and water status of the flies. On the basis of our results we discuss the assumptions used in recent model papers and present arguments as to why the ramping assay is both a valid and ecologically relevant way to measure thermal resistance in insects...|$|R

A simple inverse code methodology based on BS 1113 [1 - 3] exists for estimating base rupture life in cylinder to cylinder configurations (branches) under constant pressure and temperature.

40|$|The {{volatile}} gas isoprene is emitted in teragrams {{per annum}} quantities from the terrestrial biosphere and exerts a large effect on atmospheric chemistry. Isoprene is made primarily from recently fixed photosynthate; however, alternate carbon sources {{play an important}} role, particularly when photosynthate is limiting. We examined the relative contribution of these alternate carbon sources under changes in light and temperature, the two environmental conditions that have the strongest influence over isoprene emission. Using a novel real-time analytical approach that allowed us to examine dynamic changes in carbon sources, we observed that relative contributions do not change {{as a function of}} light intensity. We found that the classical uncoupling of isoprene emission from net photosynthesis at elevated leaf temperatures is associated with an increased contribution of alternate carbon. We also observed a rapid compensatory response where alternate carbon sources compensated for transient decreases in recently fixed carbon during <b>thermal</b> <b>ramping,</b> thereby maintaining overall increases in isoprene production rates at high temperatures. Photorespiration is known to contribute to the decline in net photosynthesis at high leaf temperatures. A reduction in the temperature at which the contribution of alternate carbon sources increased was observed under photorespiratory conditions, while photosynthetic conditions increased this temperature. Feeding [2 -C- 13] glycine (a photorespiratory intermediate) stimulated emissions of [C- 13 (1 - 5) ] isoprene and (CO 2) -C- 13, supporting the possibility that photorespiration can provide an alternate source of carbon for isoprene synthesis.

40|$|Almost {{everyone}} will experience pain {{at some point}} in their lives. While pain is generally adaptive, and alerts the body to potential tissue damage, chronic pain is a disruptive disease with a huge psychological and economic cost. Of all the senses, the molecular basis of pain is perhaps the least understood. Without an understanding of the genes involved in pain, it is difficult to develop new drugs to treat pain. Current pain drugs are often ineffective at treating pain, especially chronic pain, and can cause many side effects. In this dissertation, I have further developed the Drosophila nociception paradigm. First, I investigated the responses of Drosophila melanogaster larvae to a naturally occurring noxious stimulus, the parasitoid wasp. These wasps use a sharp ovipositor to lay their eggs inside of the larvae. The eggs hatch, and the wasp larva then eats the Drosophila larva from the inside, resulting in the death of the Drosophila. In response, Drosophila larvae have evolved multiple mechanosensory behaviors to fight attacks from wasps. The type of defensive behavior depends on the somatotopic location of the attack along the larval body wall, as well as the degree of penetration of the larval cuticle by the wasp ovipositor. I found that the class IV neurons, which are the larval nociceptors, and the pickpocket gene are important for mediating nocifensive responses to parasitoid wasp attacks. While parasitoid wasps are the most ecologically relevant noxious stimulus for Drosophila larvae, the behavioral assays are time consuming and very low throughput. Thus, I utilized a thermal nociception assay in a genetic screen to discover new ion channels involved in the detection of noxious heat. In this assay larvae are touched lightly with a hot probe. In collaboration with Kia Walcott, I completed a forward genetic screen that knocked down 90 % of the ion channels in the Drosophila genome. We found fourteen ion channel genes that are important for larval nociception. The dendritic morphology of the nociceptor neurons is well studied, but the role of ion channels in governing the dendritic morphology had yet to be explored. We therefore screened the fourteen genes that we found to have a role in thermal nociception for a role in dendrite morphogenesis. Knockdown of six of the genes caused dendritic defects. These required genes represented a wide variety of transporters and channels, including potassium channels, TRP channels, and ligand gated channels. I also generated a genetic null mutant fly for coyotemint, an ABC transporter. Lastly, I investigated the role of the calcium gated potassium channel, SK, in thermal nociception. Previous work in the lab had demonstrated that larvae null for SK exhibited a hypersensitive phenotype to a noxious thermal stimulus. I determined that one isoform of SK, SK-M, rescues this phenotype, and is necessary for thermal nociception. Additionally, I built an apparatus that allowed for the confocal imaging of genetically encoded calcium indicators while a larva undergoes a <b>thermal</b> <b>ramp.</b> This set-up allowed us to explore the role of SK in the physiology of the class IV neurons.

All 10 common polymorphisms, 15 / 15 previously identified disease-causing mutations, and three previously untested single base changes were identified. Assays of LDLR exons 3 and 8 were validated in 460 familial hypercholesteremics and detected 8 / 9 known variants. We then applied the exon 3 assay in several DNA banks representing ∼ 8000 subjects with known cholesterol values and applied both assays in one DNA bank (n = 3600). In exon 3 we identified one previously reported moderate mutation, P 84 S (n = 1), also associated with moderate hypercholesteremia in this subject; an unreported silent variant, N 76 N (n = 1); and known severe hypercholesteremia splice mutation 313 + 1 G→A (n = 2). Around exon 8 we identified a paucimorphism (n = 35) at the splice site 1061 – 8 T→C (known to be in complete linkage disequilibrium with T 705 I) and unreported sequence variants 1186 + 11 G→A (n = 1) and D 335 N G→A (n = 1).

40|$|We report {{effects of}} {{annealing}} on InP/InGaAs heterojunction bipolar transistors (HBTs) having an InGaAs base layer C-doped using CBr 4 or CBrCl 3 as the C source. It {{was found that}} <b>ramp</b> <b>thermal</b> annealing (RTA) after growth removes H atoms, which are located in C-dopedd InGaAs base layer and deactivate C acceptors, resulting in a decrease of base sheet resistance. An RTA simultaneously can deteriorate the C-doped base layer.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the optimization and validation {{of a new}} simple method for the quantitative determination of water in atmospheric particulate matter (PM). The analyses are performed by using a coulometric Karl-Fisher system equipped with a controlled heating device; different water contributions are separated by the application of an optimized <b>thermal</b> <b>ramp</b> (three heating steps: 50 – 120 &deg;C, 120 – 180 &deg;C, 180 – 250 &deg;C). The analytical performance of the method was verified by using standard materials containing 5. 55 % and 1 % by weight of water. The recovery was greater than 95 %; the detection limit was about 20 &mu;g. The method was then applied to NIST reference materials (NIST 1649 a, urban particulate matter) and to real PM 10 samples collected in different geographical areas. In all cases the repeatability was satisfactory (10 – 15 %). When analyzing the reference material, the separation of four different types of water was obtained. In real PM 10 samples {{the amount of water}} and its thermal profile differed {{as a function of the}} chemical composition of the dust. Mass percentages of 3 – 4 % of water were obtained in most samples, but values up to about 15 % were reached in areas where the chemical composition of PM is dominated by secondary inorganic ions and organic matter. High percentages of water were also observed in areas where PM is characterized by the presence of desert dust. A possible identification of the quality of water released from the samples was tried by applying the method to some hygroscopic compounds that are likely contained in PM (pure SiO 2 , Al 2 O 3 , ammonium salts, carbohydrates and dicarboxylic acids) and by comparing the results with those obtained from field samples...|$|E
40|$|NASA Ames Research Center's WetLab- 2 Project enables on-orbit {{quantitative}} Reverse Transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis {{without the}} need for sample return. The WetLab- 2 system is capable of processing sample types ranging from microbial cultures to animal tissues dissected on-orbit. The project developed a RNA preparation module that can lyse cells and extract RNA of sufficient quality and quantity for use as templates in qRT-PCR reactions. Our protocol has the advantage of using non-toxic chemicals and does not require alcohols or other organics. The resulting RNA is dispensed into reaction tubes that contain all lyophilized reagents needed to perform qRT-PCR reactions. System operations require simple and limited crew actions including syringe pushes, valve turns and pipette dispenses. The project selected the Cepheid SmartCycler (TradeMark), a Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) qRT-PCR unit, because of its advantages including rugged modular design, low power consumption, rapid <b>thermal</b> <b>ramp</b> times and four-color multiplex detection. Single tube multiplex assays can be used to normalize for RNA concentration and integrity, and to study multiple genes of interest in each module. The WetLab- 2 system can downlink data from the ISS to the ground after a completed run and uplink new thermal cycling programs. The ability to conduct qRT-PCR and generate results on-orbit is an important step towards utilizing the ISS as a National Laboratory facility. Specifically, the ability to get on-orbit data will provide investigators with the opportunity to adjust experimental parameters in real time {{without the need}} for sample return and re-flight. On orbit gene expression analysis can also eliminate the confounding effects on gene expression of reentry stresses and shock acting on live cells and organisms or the concern of RNA degradation of fixed samples and provide on-orbit gene expression benchmarking prior to sample return. Finally, the system can also be used for analysis of air, surface, water, and clinical samples to monitor environmental pathogens and crew health.

40|$|The {{objective}} of NASA Ames Research Centers WetLab- 2 Project {{is to place}} on the ISS a system capable of conducting gene expression analysis via quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) of biological specimens sampled or cultured on orbit. The WetLab- 2 system is capable of processing sample types ranging from microbial cultures to animal tissues dissected on-orbit. The project has developed a RNA preparation module that can lyse cells and extract RNA of sufficient quality and quantity for use as templates in qRT-PCR reactions. Our protocol has the advantage that it uses non-toxic chemicals, alcohols or other organics. The resulting RNA is transferred into a pipette and then dispensed into reaction tubes that contain all lyophilized reagents needed to perform qRT-PCR reactions. These reaction tubes are mounted on rotors to centrifuge the liquid to the reaction window of the tube using a cordless drill. System operations require simple and limited crew actions including syringe pushes, valve turns and pipette dispenses. The resulting process takes less than 30 min to have tubes ready for loading into the qRT-PCR unit. The project has selected a Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) qRT-PCR unit, the Cepheid SmartCycler, that will fly in its COTS configuration. The SmartCycler {{has a number of}} advantages including modular design (16 independent PCR modules), low power consumption, rapid <b>thermal</b> <b>ramp</b> times and four-color detection. The ability to detect up to four fluorescent channels will enable multiplex assays {{that can be used to}} normalize for RNA concentration and integrity, and to study multiple genes of interest in each module. The WetLab- 2 system will have the capability to downlink data from the ISS to the ground after a completed run and to uplink new programs. The ability to conduct qRT-PCR on-orbit eliminates the confounding effects on gene expression of reentry stresses and shock acting on live cells and organisms or the concern of RNA degradation of fixed samples. The system can be used to validate terrestrial analyses of samples returned from ISS by providing on-orbit gene expression benchmarking prior to sample return. The ability to get on-orbit data will provide investigators with the opportunity to adjust experimental parameters in real time for subsequent trials, without the need for sample return and re-flight to sample multigenerational changes. The system can also be used for analysis of air, surface, water, and clinical samples to monitor environmental contaminants and crew health.

40|$|Nanowires of SnO 2 {{have been}} {{successfully}} synthesized using a modified, simplified and less complicated carbothermal reduction technique, namely <b>thermal</b> <b>ramping</b> technique. This technique is developed to ease the synthesis process of nanowires {{for the development of}} gas sensing device. Contrary to conventional carbothermal reduction technique, no inert gas as a carrier is required. Distance of source material to substrates parameter is also eliminated. This new technique introduces ramping parameter to the conventional technique to compensate the elimination of the carrier gas. SnO 2 was chosen as the raw material due to its wide availability, low-cost and widely used in the sensing devices. The SnO 2 nanowires were synthesized under different controlled parameter such as heating temperature, Au catalyst and number of ramping. The morphological and crystal structure of the yielded nanowires were characterized using the field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). It was discovered that nanowires density increased as the temperature increased. This could be attributed to the increased in the Sn, SnO, SnO 2 and CO/CO 2 vapour supply to the substrates. XRD results show that the nanowires yielded at 700 °C to 900 °C have tetragonal rutile structure of SnO 2, whereas at 1000 °C, the nanowires yielded were detected to be SnO 2, Sn 3 O 4 and Sn 2 O 3 /SnO. SnO 2. The density of SnO 2 nanowires grown with Au catalyst was also observed to be significantly higher than that of SnO 2 nanowires without Au catalyst. The SnO 2 nanowires grown with and without Au catalyst {{can be attributed to the}} vapour-liquid-solid (VLS) and vapour-solid (VS) mechanism, respectively. Moreover, the density of the SnO 2 nanowires also increased as the ramp number increased. No nanowires were observed in the first ramp. The SnO 2 nanowires only started to appear in the second ramp and densified in the third ramp. In hydrogen gas sensing test, the iii sensor was observed to display the optimum performance at 200 °C, with response and recovery times were approximately 20 s and 140 s, respectively. At different hydrogen concentration, the sensitivities were observed to be highest and lowest at 1000 ppm and 200 ppm, respectively. The unstable and fluctuated electrical response and sensitivities of the sensor observed at 400 ppm, 300 ppm and 200 ppm could be attributed to the presence of water vapour on the sensor and complex reaction probably occurred between the vapour with the oxygen and hydrogen...|$|R
