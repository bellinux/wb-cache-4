50|$|An {{underlying}} assumption for G-proteins is that α, β, and γ subunits {{are present}} in the same concentration. However, there is evidence that there are more Tβ and Tγ than Tα in rod outer segments (ROS). The excess Tβ and Tγ have been concluded to be floating freely around in the ROS, though it cannot be associated with the Tα at any given time. One possible explanation for the excess Tβγ is increased availability for Tα <b>to</b> <b>rebind.</b> Since Tβγ is crucial for the binding of transducin, reacquisition of the heterotrimeric conformation could lead to more rapid binding to another GTP molecule and thus faster phototransduction.|$|E

50|$|An {{opposing}} {{effect of}} the reduced availability of TC is the induction of GCN4 expression by translational regulation. Four short ORF's exist in {{the leader of the}} GCN4 mRNA. 40S Ribosomal Subunits scanning the mRNA from 5' have TC bound and translate the first upstream open reading frame (uORF). Under non-starving condition there is enough ternary complex that the subunits rebind it before they reach uORF 4. Translation is again initiated, uORF2,3 or 4 translated and the 40S Subunits subsequently dissociate from GCN4 mRNA.Under starving conditions there is less TC present. Some of the 40S Subunits are not able <b>to</b> <b>rebind</b> TC before they reach uORF 4 but eventually rebind TC before reaching GCN4 coding sequence. Therefore, the reduction in TC formation resulting from GCN2 activation by amino acid starvation leads to the induction of GCN4 translation.GCN4 is the primary regulator in response to amino acid starvation, termed general amino acid control (GAAC). It acts as a transcription factor and activates several genes required for amino acid synthesis.|$|E

40|$|International audienceWe {{investigated}} the changes of heme coordination in purified soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) by time-resolved spectroscopy {{in a time}} range encompassing 11 orders of magnitude (from 1 ps to 0. 2 s). After dissociation, NO either recombines geminately to the 4 -coordinate (4 c) heme (τG 1 = 7. 5 ps; 97 ± 1 % of the population) or exits the heme pocket (3 ± 1 %). The proximal His <b>rebinds</b> <b>to</b> the 4 c heme with a 70 -ps time constant. Then, NO is distributed in two approximately equal populations (1. 5 %). One geminately <b>rebinds</b> <b>to</b> the 5 c heme (τG 2 = 6. 5 ns), whereas the other diffuses out to the solution, from where it rebinds bimolecularly (τ = 50 μs with [NO] = 200 μM) forming a 6 c heme with a diffusion-limited rate constant of 2 × 10 (8) M(- 1) ⋅s(- 1). In both cases, the rebinding of NO induces the cleavage of the Fe-His bond that can be observed as an individual reaction step. Saliently, the time constant of bond cleavage differs depending on whether NO binds geminately or from solution (τ 5 C 1 = 0. 66 μs and τ 5 C 2 = 10 ms, respectively). Because the same event occurs with rates separated by four orders of magnitude, this measurement implies that sGC is in different structural states in both cases, having different strain exerted on the Fe-His bond.

40|$|A novel {{artificial}} antibody for troponin T (TnT) was synthesized by molecular imprint (MI) on {{the surface}} of multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT). This was done by attaching TnT to the MWCNT surface, and filling the vacant spaces by polymerizing under mild conditions acrylamide (monomer) in N,N′-methylenebisacrylamide (cross-linker) and ammonium persulphate (initiator). After removing the template, the obtained biomaterial was able <b>to</b> <b>rebind</b> TnT and discriminate it among other interfering species. Stereochemical recognition of TnT was confirmed by the non-rebinding ability displayed by non-imprinted (NI) materials, obtained by imprinting without a template.

The MISPE procedures were fully optimized and applied to the clean up of selected phenylurea herbicides in carrot, potato, corn, and pea sample extracts and finally determined by HPLC-UV at 244 nm. Although a high degree of clean up was obtained, a decrease of the MIP recognition capabilities was observed in subsequent runs. Thus, a previous clean up protocol based on the use of a non-imprinted polymer was used to prevent the loss of MIP performance and to ease the removal of interferences. Following this procedure, namely two-step MISPE, matrix compounds were almost completely removed by the non-imprinted polymer retaining the ability of MIPs <b>to</b> selectively <b>rebind</b> target analytes unaltered.
