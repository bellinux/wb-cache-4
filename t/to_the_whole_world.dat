5|$|The terms {{by which}} Kilij Arslan II allowed Manuel and his army to leave were {{that he should}} remove his forts and armies on the {{frontier}} at Dorylaeum and Sublaeum. Since the Sultan had already failed to keep {{his side of the}} earlier treaty of 1162, however, Manuel only ordered the fortifications of Sublaeum to be dismantled, but not the fortifications of Dorylaeum. Nevertheless, defeat at Myriokephalon was an embarrassment for both Manuel personally and also for his empire. The Komnenian emperors had worked hard since the Battle of Manzikert, 105 years earlier, to restore the reputation of the empire. Yet because of his over-confidence, Manuel had demonstrated <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>world</b> that Byzantium still could not defeat the Seljuks, despite the advances made during the past century. In western opinion, Myriokephalon cut Manuel down to a humbler size: not that of Emperor of the Romans but that of King of the Greeks.|$|E

A worldwide trade of machine-carved figuerines and statues ensued.|$|E

25|$|Since {{at least}} 1700, Russian intellectuals {{have sought to}} Latinise the Russian {{language}} in their desire for close relations with the West. The Bolsheviks had four goals: to break with Tsarism, to spread socialism <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>world,</b> to isolate the Muslim inhabitants of the Soviet Union from the Arabic-Islamic world and religion, and eradicate illiteracy through simplification. They concluded the Latin alphabet was the right tool to do so, and after seizing power during the Russian Revolution of 1917, they made plans to realise these ideals.|$|E

Ulaganathan allowed Ibrahim to carry out terrorist attacks in exchange for money. He even tries to gain popularity by claiming Velayudham as his idea, planning to reveal Ibrahim as Velayudham's real identity in a function at the Nehru Stadium, Chennai. Velu returns to Chennai, kills Ibrahim, exposes Ulaganathan's misdeeds and reveals himself as Velayudham <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>world.</b>|$|E

25|$|To {{all intents}} and purposes, the Dutch agents were middle-men, {{stocking}} and selling on French wines <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>world</b> and making a considerable profit in the process. Colbert (Louis XIV's finance minister) attempted to break their monopoly by creating a trading company that could deal directly with the markets. The Dutch retaliated by levying a heavy surcharge on various French manufactured articles, as well as French brandy and wine. Exports slowed down, with the regrettable result that the focus of production shifted from quality to quantity. A further undesirable effect was that cereal crops were often abandoned in favour of wine-growing, regardless of the land's suitability.|$|E

500|$|Largely due to {{band member}} Régine Chassagne's Haitian ancestry, the band {{has tried to}} raise support and {{awareness}} for the socio-economic problems in Haiti throughout their career. The Haitian people had 15,000 dollars donated to them on November 5, 2005.

500|$|Barrett, by the {{beginning}} of the recording sessions for A Saucerful of Secrets, was already shrinking into a delirious state of mind, exacerbated by his feelings of alienation from the rest of the band. The common interpretation of the lyrics is that they reflect his schizophrenia and it has been argued that they could also be read as a criticism of the other band members for forcing him out. King said of the song: [...] "The most alienated, extraordinary lyrics. It's not addressed to the band, it's addressed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>world.</b> He was completely cut off."

2500|$|The synonymous term Hermetical is also attested in the 17th century.
