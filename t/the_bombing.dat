Funds to repair the Banski dvori were approved in 1995, and the site became the official residence of the Croatian Government. A plaque commemorating <b>the</b> <b>bombing</b> was placed at the Banski dvori facade 20years after the attack, in 2011. <b>The</b> <b>bombing</b> is also commemorated by the Zagreb City Museum as the event is featured in the Zagreb in Independent Croatia collection of its permanent display.|$|E
5|$|An {{observance}} is {{held each}} year to remember the victims of <b>the</b> <b>bombing.</b> An annual marathon draws thousands, and allows runners to sponsor a victim of <b>the</b> <b>bombing.</b> For the tenth anniversary of <b>the</b> <b>bombing,</b> the city held 24days of activities, including a week-long series of events known as the National Week of Hope from April 17 to 24, 2005. As in previous years, the tenth anniversary of <b>the</b> <b>bombing</b> observances began with a service at 9:02a.m., marking the moment the bomb went off, with the traditional 168seconds of silence—onesecond for each person who was killed {{as a result of}} the blast. The service also included the traditional reading of the names, read by children to symbolize the future of Oklahoma City.|$|E
5|$|Hanoi, {{which had}} {{continuously}} stipulated {{that it would}} not conduct negotiations while <b>the</b> <b>bombing</b> continued, finally agreed to meet with the Americans for preliminary talks in Paris. As a result, President Johnson declared that a complete bombing halt over North Vietnam would go into effect on 1 November 1968, just prior to the U.S. presidential election. Although <b>the</b> <b>bombing</b> halt was to be linked to progress in the peace talks, the Joint Chiefs were skeptical that the administration would reopen <b>the</b> <b>bombing</b> campaign under any circumstances. They were correct. North Vietnam was not the target of intense bombing again for another three and half years.|$|E

5|$|In {{the wake}} of <b>the</b> <b>bombing</b> of Banski dvori of 7 October, Croatian {{authorities}} instructed the ZNG to assault and capture JNA barracks in the Zagreb area if commanders considered it possible. The instructions {{did not result in}} attacks in Zagreb itself, but JNA barracks in Samobor were captured by Croatian forces on the day of <b>the</b> <b>bombing.</b> The declaration of the independence of Croatia came into force the next day.|$|E
5|$|International {{reactions}} to <b>the</b> <b>bombing</b> varied. President Clinton received many messages of sympathy, including those from Queen ElizabethII of the United Kingdom, Yasser Arafat of the Palestine Liberation Organization, and Narasimha Rao of India. Iran condemned <b>the</b> <b>bombing</b> {{as an attack}} on innocent people, but also blamed the U.S. government's policies for inciting it. Other condolences came from Russia, Canada, Australia, the United Nations, and the European Union, among other nations and organizations.|$|E
5|$|The British Royal Air Force {{carried out}} two bombing raids on Sofia, {{the capital of}} Bulgaria, in {{retaliation}} for the attacks on Yugoslavia. The invasion resulted in the surrender of Yugoslav forces on 17 April. The senior Luftwaffe officer responsible for <b>the</b> <b>bombing</b> was captured by the Yugoslavs {{at the end of the}} war and was tried and executed for war crimes, in part for his involvement in <b>the</b> <b>bombing</b> of Belgrade.|$|E

5000|$|Demolition (DLC): An objective-based game {{in which}} a Bomb {{is located in a}} central area of the map and both teams must fight to acquire <b>the</b> <b>Bomb,</b> bring it {{into the heart of the}} {{opposing}} team's spawn area, and plant <b>the</b> <b>Bomb</b> at a designated location.

Should a player not pick <b>the</b> <b>Bomb</b> up, it will eventually respawn at its starting location. Once <b>the</b> <b>Bomb</b> has been planted in a team's HQ area, they have 30 seconds to attempt to disarm <b>the</b> <b>Bomb.</b> A team wins the round by either successfully planting and defending <b>the</b> <b>Bomb</b> until detonation, or if they disarm a Bomb that was planted in their HQ by the opposing team.|$|R
5|$|There {{has been}} {{debate over the}} {{morality}} of the air campaign against Japan since World WarII. During the war the American public approved of <b>the</b> <b>bombing</b> of Germany and Japan, and {{the few people who}} criticized the raids were seen as unrealistic or even traitors. Some United States government and military personnel believed that <b>the</b> <b>bombing</b> campaign was morally ambiguous, however, but rarely voiced their views publicly.|$|E
5|$|A {{variety of}} {{conspiracy}} theories {{have been proposed}} about the events surrounding <b>the</b> <b>bombing.</b> Some theories allege that individuals in the government, including President Bill Clinton, knew of the impending bombing and intentionally failed to act on that knowledge. Other theories focus on initial reports by local news stations of multiple other unexploded bombs within the building itself as evidence of remnants of a controlled demolition; following the attack, search and rescue operations at the site were delayed until the area had been declared safe by the Oklahoma City bomb squad and federal authorities. According to both a situation report compiled by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and a memo issued by the United States Atlantic Command the day following the attack, a second bomb located within the building was disarmed while a third was evacuated. Further theories focus on additional conspirators involved with <b>the</b> <b>bombing.</b> Additional theories claim <b>the</b> <b>bombing</b> {{was carried out by}} the government in order to frame the militia movement or to provide the impetus for new antiterrorism legislation while using McVeigh as a scapegoat. Other conspiracy theories suggest that foreign agents, particularly Islamic terrorists but also the Japanese government or German Neo-Nazis, were involved in <b>the</b> <b>bombing.</b> Experts have disputed the theories and government investigations have been opened at various times to look into the theories.|$|E
5|$|After an April 21, 1995, {{court hearing}} on the gun charges, but before McVeigh's release, federal agents took him into custody as they {{continued}} their investigation into <b>the</b> <b>bombing.</b> Rather than talk to investigators about <b>the</b> <b>bombing,</b> McVeigh demanded an attorney. Having been tipped off {{by the arrival of}} police and helicopters that a bombing suspect was inside, a restless crowd began to gather outside the jail. While McVeigh's requests for a bulletproof vest or transport by helicopter were denied, authorities did use a helicopter to transport him from Perry to Oklahoma City.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>bomb</b> is then {{loaded on}} a strike aircraft. In the pylon to which <b>the</b> <b>bomb</b> is {{attached}} {{there is a}} datalink between the aircraft's cockpit and <b>the</b> <b>bomb.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>bomb</b> was {{designed}} for aerial bombardment and maximum efficiency after being dropped. Therefore, <b>the</b> <b>bomb</b> had a very thin metal sheet as its only cover, as little as 1/32 in. <b>The</b> <b>bomb</b> is approximately 8 in in diameter, with a nose {{the shape of a}} hemisphere. <b>The</b> M108 <b>bomb</b> fuse at <b>the</b> nose of <b>the</b> <b>bomb</b> detonated <b>the</b> weapon, allowing for the release of the contents inside. <b>The</b> <b>bomb</b> is designed to carry either white phosphorus (WP) or a mustard agent (H). However, <b>the</b> H <b>bomb</b> filler was found to leak from <b>the</b> <b>bomb</b> when loaded, and the M47 and its variant M47A1 were not allowed to be loaded. This was due to the thin steel walls on the weapon. In storage and handling, both corrosion and rough handling were found to cause <b>the</b> <b>bomb</b> to leak. When <b>the</b> <b>bomb</b> is loaded with the chemical filler H, it weighs approximately 93 lb, 73 lb of which are from H.|$|R
50|$|The {{drivers and}} the volunteers {{who were to}} prime <b>the</b> <b>bombs</b> woke up at 6:00 a.m. and drove <b>the</b> car <b>bombs</b> to their various targets. It was planned that by <b>the</b> time <b>the</b> <b>bombs</b> went off at around 15:00, the active service unit would be back in Ireland. <b>The</b> <b>bomb</b> at New Scotland Yard was found at 8:30 by a {{policeman}} who noticed a discrepancy in the licence plate. <b>The</b> <b>bomb</b> team started lifting out 5-pound bags of explosives and separated them, so that if <b>the</b> <b>bomb</b> did go off, {{the force of the}} explosion would be greatly reduced. <b>The</b> <b>bomb</b> squad eventually found the detonating cord leads, which ran under the front passenger seat of the car; Peter Gurney, a senior member of New Scotland Yard, cut the detonator cord leads, defusing <b>the</b> <b>bomb.</b>|$|R
5|$|As {{a result}} of <b>the</b> <b>bombing,</b> the U.S. Congress passed the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, which {{tightened}} the standards for habeas corpus in the United States, as well as legislation designed to increase the protection around federal buildings to deter future terrorist attacks. On April 19, 2000, the Oklahoma City National Memorial was dedicated {{on the site of}} the Murrah Federal Building, commemorating the victims of <b>the</b> <b>bombing.</b> Annual remembrance services are held at the same time of day as the explosion occurred.|$|E
5|$|Bales' lawyer, John Henry Browne, later {{stated that}} his client was upset because a fellow soldier had lost a leg in an {{explosion}} on 9 March. It is unclear whether <b>the</b> <b>bombing</b> cited by Browne {{was the same as}} the one described by the villagers.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} of <b>the</b> <b>bombing,</b> Nellie Kehoe had become chronically ill with what resembled tuberculosis, for {{which there was no}} {{effective}} treatment or cure.

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>bomb</b> was cleverly {{built and}} {{virtually}} tamper-proof. The ransom note said that <b>the</b> <b>bomb</b> {{could not be}} disarmed even by <b>the</b> <b>bomb</b> builder, but if paid $3 million he would give instructions on which combination of switches would allow <b>the</b> <b>bomb</b> to be moved and remotely detonated. The FBI determined it would take 4 men to move it {{and there was no}} way to know if <b>the</b> <b>bomb</b> was truly disarmed or safe to move. The FBI decided that <b>the</b> <b>bomb</b> would have to be disarmed in the hotel. All guests and their belongings were evacuated from the hotel and the gas main was shut off.|$|R
5000|$|The range tables {{specified}} {{the barrel}} angle and propellant charges required. The additional cordite propelling charge bags were dropped {{down the barrel}} if necessary, or necessary number of propellant charges removed from <b>the</b> <b>bomb,</b> and <b>the</b> <b>bomb's</b> fuze was set. The gunners stood back, <b>the</b> <b>bomb</b> was dropped down the barrel, the detonator {{in the base of}} the [...]303 cartridge in the base of <b>the</b> <b>bomb</b> struck a pin {{in the bottom of the}} barrel and fired, igniting the guncotton charges in the base of <b>the</b> <b>bomb,</b> which in turn ignited the cordite charges if present. The resulting rapid gas expansion propelled <b>the</b> <b>bomb</b> up <b>the</b> barrel and to its target.|$|R
5|$|For twoyears after <b>the</b> <b>bombing</b> {{the only}} {{memorials}} {{to the victims}} were plush toys, crucifixes, letters, and other personal items left by thousands of people at a security fence surrounding {{the site of the}} building. Many suggestions for suitable memorials were sent to Oklahoma City, but an official memorial planning committee was not set up until early 1996, when the Murrah Federal Building Memorial Task Force, composed of 350members, was set up to formulate plans for a memorial to commemorate the victims of <b>the</b> <b>bombing.</b> On July 1, 1997 the winning design was chosen unanimously by a 15-member panel from 624submissions. The memorial was designed at a cost of $29million, which was raised by public and private funds. The memorial is part of the National Park Service and was designed by Oklahoma City architects Hans and Torrey Butzer and Sven Berg. It was dedicated by President Clinton on April 19, 2000, exactly five years after <b>the</b> <b>bombing.</b> Within the first year, it had 700,000visitors.|$|E
5|$|Information {{obtained}} {{later from}} North Korean prisoners revealed the divisions the Far East Command {{thought to be}} still west of the Naktong had already crossed to the east side and {{were not in the}} bombed area. No evidence was found that <b>the</b> <b>bombing</b> killed a single North Korean soldier. However, <b>the</b> <b>bombing</b> appeared to have destroyed a significant number of North Korean artillery batteries, as artillery fire on UN positions waned substantially following the mission. The UN ground and air commanders opposed future massive carpet bombing attacks against enemy tactical troops unless there was precise information on an enemy concentration and the situation was critical. Instead, they recommended fighter-bombers and dive bombers would better support ground forces.|$|E
5|$|Initially, the FBI {{had three}} {{hypotheses}} regarding {{who might have}} been responsible for <b>the</b> <b>bombing.</b> The first was international terrorists, possibly the same group that had carried out the World Trade Center bombing two years earlier. The FBI also thought that a drug cartel might have been carrying out an act of vengeance against DEA agents as the building held a DEA office. The last hypothesis was that <b>the</b> <b>bombing</b> was done by anti-government right-wing radicals attempting to start a rebellion against the federal government.|$|E
