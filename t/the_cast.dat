50|$|Finally, <b>the</b> <b>casting</b> must be {{designed}} to produce directional solidification, which sweeps from the extremities of the mold cavity toward the riser(s).

One part of achieving this end is by placing the riser near the thickest and largest part of <b>the</b> <b>casting,</b> as that part of <b>the</b> <b>casting</b> will cool and solidify last. If this type of solidification is not possible, multiple risers that feed various sections of <b>the</b> <b>casting</b> or chills may be necessary.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The {{process of}} {{solidification}} is complex {{in nature and}} the simulation of such process is required in industry before it is actually undertaken. It is a non transient phenomenon, posing a challenge in terms of modelling and analysis. Finite element method is used to simulate the heat transfer process accompanying the solidification process. During the solidification of a casting in a mold, the heat-transfer between <b>the</b> <b>casting</b> and <b>the</b> mold plays a vital role. This work attempts to study heat flow within <b>the</b> <b>casting,</b> {{as well as from}} <b>the</b> <b>casting</b> to <b>the</b> mold, and finally obtains the temperature history of all points inside <b>the</b> <b>casting.</b> <b>The</b> most important instant of time is when the hottest region inside <b>the</b> <b>casting</b> is solidifying. ANSYS software has been used to obtain the temperature distribution in <b>the</b> <b>casting</b> process by performing Transient Thermal Analysis...|$|R

40|$|The heat {{transfer}} during <b>the</b> <b>casting</b> solidification process includes the heat radiation of <b>the</b> high temperature <b>casting</b> and <b>the</b> mold, the heat convection between <b>the</b> <b>casting</b> and <b>the</b> mold, {{and the heat}} conduction inside <b>the</b> <b>casting</b> and from <b>the</b> <b>casting</b> to <b>the</b> mold. In this paper, a formula of time step in simulation of solidification is derived, considering the heat radiation, convection and conduction based on the conservation of energy. The different {{heat transfer}} conditions between <b>the</b> conventional sand <b>casting</b> and <b>the</b> permanent mold <b>casting</b> {{are taken into account}} in this formula. The characteristics of heat transfer in the interior and surface of <b>the</b> <b>casting</b> are also considered.
