40|$|The loss of {{nutrients}} to the aquatic environment caused by the irrigation of farm dairy effluent (FDE) is a prominent and contentious feature of dairy farming in New Zealand. This thesis investigates management practices and technologies with potential to reduce nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) losses in drainage water from mole and pipe drained dairy pasture soils irrigated with FDE. Farm dairy effluent management was both monitored, using remote sensing technologies, and modelled on a case study farm. During the winter and spring of 2008, an estimated 7, 890 m 3 of FDE was applied {{in excess of the}} soil water deficit (SWD). System constraints were the cause of about two-thirds (5, 070 m 3) of this over-applied FDE volume. It was estimated that as much as 502 kg TN and 83 kg TP could have been lost to surface waters due to inadequate infrastructure. The two main system constraints were the farm’s insufficient FDE storage capacity (2, 000 m 3) and the inability of the farm’s irrigator to apply small application depths (< 8 mm). Furthermore, this study highlighted the significant loss {{of nutrients}} that can occur under FDE irrigation and reinforced the need for tools to assist farmers with FDE management. A number of tools were developed to help farmers manage FDE irrigation. The use of a soil water balance, incorporating actual farm daily rainfall, is an effective method for informing the scheduling of FDE irrigations. Also, the risk of over-application of FDE to soils caused by <b>travelling</b> <b>irrigator</b> breakdowns or stoppages was substantially reduced by the use of a breakdown alert and automatic shut-off system developed and evaluated in this study. Given the elevated risk of P losses from soils treated with FDE, a method of capturing P from drainage waters was investigated. A field experiment was conducted to quantify the ability of Papakai tephra, installed into mole and pipe drainage systems, to remove P from drainage waters. This drainage system reduced TP losses in drainage by about 50 % (c. 0. 14 kg P/ha) over a drainage season, which equated to a 2. 8 kg P reduction for a 20 -hectare effluent block. As farmers frequently crop effluent block soils, the effect of summer forage cropping on nutrient losses was quantified. The practice of spring cultivating long-term dairy pasture, summer forage cropping and autumn regrassing increased the quantity of TN measured in drainage water, over three drainage seasons (2006 to 2008), by 84 % (21 kg N/ha), compared to long-term pasture. If this study had commenced in spring with a more typical pattern of rainfall and drainage, this increase is estimated to have only been about 23. 7 % (5. 9 kg N/ha). Based on these results, summer forage cropping is estimated to increase whole-farm drainage water N losses by about 5 %, when 10 % of a farm’s area is cultivated each year. Of the management practices and technologies studied, the greatest opportunity to reduce the losses of N and P to surface water from the case study farm’s effluent block, is through investment in FDE system infrastructure, particularly adequate storage capacity, and the use of decision support and fail-safe tools to assist the implementation of deficit irrigation of FDE...|$|E
40|$|The {{last decade}} {{has been a}} period of great {{expansion}} and land use intensification for the New Zealand dairy farming industry with a 44 % increase in national dairy cow numbers. Intensive dairy farming is now {{considered to be a}} major contributor to the deterioration in the quality of surface and ground water resources in some regions of New Zealand. Previous research has demonstrated intensive dairy farming is responsible for accelerated contamination of wateways by nutrients, suspended solids, pathogenic organisms and faecal material. A number of common dairy farming practices increase the risk of nutrient leaching. In particular, farm dairy effluent (FDE) has been implicated as a major contributor to the degradation of water quality. With the introduction of the Resource Management Act in 1991, the preferred treatment for FDE shifted away from traditional two-pond systems to land application. However, on most farms, irrigation of FDE has occurred on a daily basis, often without regard for soil moisture status. Therefore, it has been commonplace for partially treated effluent to drain through and/or runoff soils and contaminate fresh water bodies. The objectives of this thesis were to design and implement a sustainable land application system for FDE on difficult to manage, mole and pipe drained soils, and to assess the impacts of FDE application, urea application and cattle grazing events on nutrient losses via artificial drainage and surface runoff from dairy cattle grazed pasture. To meet these objectives a research field site was established on Massey University's No. 4 Dairy farm near Palmerston North. The soil type was Tokomaru silt loam, a Fragiaqualf with poor natural drainage. Eight experimental plots (each 40 x 40 m) were established with two treatments. Four of the plots represented standard farm practice including grazing and fertiliser regimes. Another four plots were subjected to the same farm practices but without the fertiliser application and they were also irrigated with FDE. Each plot had an isolated mole and pipe drainage system. Four surface runoff plots (each 5 m x 10 m) were established as subplots (two on the fertilised plots and two on the plots irrigated with FDE) in the final year of the study. Plots were instrumented to allow the continuous monitoring of drainage and surface runoff and the collection of water samples for nutrient analyses. An application of 25 mm of FDE to a soil with limited soil water deficit - simulating a 'daily' irrigation regime - resulted in considerable drainage of partially treated FDE. Approximately 70 % of the applied FDE left the experimental plots with 10 mm of drainage and 8 mm of surface runoff. The resulting concentrations of N and P in drainage and runoff were approximately 45 % and 80 % of the original concentrations in the applied FDE, respectively. From this single irrigation event, a total of 12. 1 kg N ha- 1 and 1. 9 kg P ha- 1 was lost to surface water representing 45 % of expected annual N loss and 100 % of expected annual P loss. An improved system for applying farm dairy effluent to land called 'deferred irrigation' was successfully developed and implemented at the research site. Deferred irrigation involves the storage of effluent in a two-pond system during periods of small soil moisture deficits and the scheduling of irrigation at times of suitable soil water deficits. Deferred irrigation of FDE all but eliminated direct drainage losses with on average < 1 % of the volume of effluent and nutrients applied leaving the experimental plots. Adopting an approach of applying 'little and often' resulted in no drainage and, therefore, zero direct loss of nutrients applied. A modelling exercise, using the APSlM simulation model, was conducted to study the feasibility of practising deferred irrigation at the farm scale on No 4 Dairy farm. Using climate data for the past 30 years, this simulation exercise demonstrated that applying small application depths of FDE, such as 15 mm or less, provided the ability to schedule irrigations earlier in spring and decreased the required effluent storage capacity. A <b>travelling</b> <b>irrigator,</b> commonly used to apply FDE (a rotating irrigator), was found to have 2 - 3 fold differences in application depth and increased the risk of generating FDE contaminated drainage. New irrigator technology (an oscillating <b>travelling</b> <b>irrigator)</b> provided a more uniform application pattern allowing greater confidence that an irrigation depth less than the soil water deficit could be applied. This allowed a greater volume to be irrigated, whilst avoiding direct drainage of FDE when the soil moisture deficit is low in early spring and late autumn. A recommendation arising from this work is that during this period of low soil water deficits, all irrigators should be set to travel at their fastest speed (lowest application depth) to minimise the potential for direct drainage of partially treated FDE and associated nutrient losses. The average concentrations of N and P in both 2002 and 2003 winter mole and pipe drainage water from grazed dairy pastures were all well above the levels required to prevent aquatic weed growth in fresh water bodies. Total N losses from plots representing standard farm practice were 28 kg N ha- 1 and 34 kg N ha- 1 for 2003 and 2004, respectively. Total P losses in 2003 and 2004 were 0. 35 kg P ha- 1 and 0. 7 kg P ha- 1, respectively. Surface runoff was measured in 2003 and contributed a further 3. 0 kg N ha- 1 and 0. 6 kg P ha- 1. A number of common dairy farm practices immediately increased the losses of N and P in the artificial drainage water. Recent grazing events increased NO 3 [...] N and DIP concentrations in drainage by approximately 5 mg litre- 1 and 0. 1 mg litre- 1, respectively. The duration between the grazing and drainage events influenced the form of N loss due to a likely urine contribution when grazing and drainage coincide, but had little impact on the total quantity of N lost. Nitrogen loss from an early spring application of urea in 2002 was minimal, whilst a mid June application in 2003 resulted in an increased loss of NO 3 [...] N throughout 80 mm of cumulative drainage suggesting that careful timing of urea applications in winter is required to prevent unnecessary N leaching. Storage and deferred irrigation of FDE during the lactation season caused no real increase in either the total-N concentrations or total N losses in the winter drainage water of 2002 and 2003. In contrast, land application of FDE using the deferred irrigation system resulted in a gradual increase in total P losses over the 2002 and 2003 winter drainage seasons. However, this increase represents less than 4 % of the P applied in FDE during the lactation season. An assessment of likely losses of nutrients at a whole-farm scale suggests that it is standard dairy farming practice (particularly intensive cattle grazing) that is responsible for the great majority of N and P loss at a farm scale. When expressed as a proportion of whole-farm losses, only a very small quantity of N is lost under an improved land treatment technique for FDE such as deferred irrigation. The management of FDE plays a greater role in the likely P loss at a farm scale with a 5 % contribution to wholefarm P losses from deferred irrigation...|$|E
40|$|Tests {{were carried}} out to analyse the affects speed {{variation}} has on irrigation efficiency in <b>travelling</b> <b>irrigators.</b> These trials required the data collection {{of a number of}} different parameters, these being longitudinal and lateral depth; applied velocity variation; water flow and pressure. From these results, distribution uniformity and velocity variations can be deduced. It was found that velocity variation reduced distribution uniformity, and the velocity variation characteristics are dependent on the drive mechanism. The auxiliary engine offered consistent average velocity with small oscillating velocity values, while the turbine's velocity tended to vary slightly more across the run. As well, oscillations were greater, while the piston drive mechanism tended to change rapidly with no particular trend. It was decided this was due to a characteristic of the drive mechanism itself, as the test data offered no other reasons for the extreme variations. It was also concluded that the cable drum radius changes significantly across the run, causing variation in speed over the whole run as possibly causing oscillations throughout. It was concluded that irrigation efficiency is influenced by the drive mechanism in use, and improvements in the performance of these drive mechanisms could be achieved if the cable could be applied evenly onto the cable drum...|$|R
40|$|Secondary-treated {{wastewater}} from Taupō Township is irrigated onto {{perennial ryegrass}} (Lolium perenne) which is harvested and {{removed from the}} View Road wastewater treatment site. To determine {{the fate of the}} applied wastewater nitrogen, 48 undisturbed barrel lysimeters (30 cm diameter x 43 cm depth) were installed throughout 29 hectares. Centre pivot <b>travelling</b> <b>irrigators</b> were programmed to vary in speed to provide target wastewater application rates of about 0, 450, 550 and 650 kg N ha⁻¹yr⁻¹. The targeted application treatments were not achieved, with the achieved nitrogen loading rates grouped into a low treatment (286 - 380 kg N ha⁻¹yr⁻¹), a medium treatment (380 - 445 kg N ha⁻¹yr⁻¹), and a high treatment (445 - 567 kg N ha⁻¹yr⁻¹). Nitrogen input in control sectors was assumed to be 5 kg N/ha/yr from atmospheric nitrogen deposition. A mean of 4 to 6 % of the applied nitrogen was leached. The mean amount of nitrogen leached from the high treatment (28. 6 ± 10. 1 kg N ha⁻¹yr⁻¹) was higher (P < 0. 05) than from the low treatment (12. 7 ± 4. 2 kg N ha⁻¹yr⁻¹). The medium treatment (16. 0 ± 7. 2 kg N ha⁻¹yr⁻¹) was not significantly different than the low treatment or the high treatment. The mean amount of nitrogen leached from the control treatment was 2. 8 ± 0. 6 kg N ha⁻¹yr⁻¹. Nitrogen leaching that occurred in the high application treatment was below the consented limit of 30 kg N ha⁻¹yr⁻¹. A mean of 79 to 100 % of the applied nitrogen was removed by pasture. There {{were no significant differences in}} pasture dry matter production, or nitrogen removal, between the low treatment (13 922 ± 1196 kg DM ha⁻¹yr⁻¹and 341 ± 25 kg N ha⁻¹yr⁻¹), the medium treatment (13 543 ± 1475 kg DM ha⁻¹yr⁻¹ and 360 ± 51 kg N ha⁻¹yr⁻¹), and the high treatment (15 285 ± 1919 kg DM ha⁻¹yr⁻¹ and 385 ± 43 kg N ha⁻¹yr⁻¹). Pasture production was higher (P < 0. 001) in irrigated pastures (mean of all irrigated treatments, 14 250 ± 349 kg DM ha⁻¹yr⁻¹) than unirrigated controls (5300 ± 839 kg DM ha⁻¹yr⁻¹). A mean of - 4 to 16 % of the applied wastewater nitrogen was unaccounted for. The majority of unrecovered nitrogen was presumed to be volatilised with lower potential for denitrification and soil storage. A second experiment was undertaken to determine whether a five week or a ten week harvesting frequency would result in greater pasture production and nitrogen removal. During the ten month trial, 265 kg N ha⁻¹ of wastewater nitrogen was irrigated and pasture plots (1 m x 1 m) were cut with a mower. Nitrogen removal and pasture production were higher (P < 0. 05) with a five week harvesting interval (8231 ± 186 kg DM ha⁻¹ and 250 ± 5 kg N ha⁻¹) than a ten week harvesting interval (7354 ± 67 kg DM ha⁻¹ and 191 ± 3 kg N ha⁻¹). Harvesting at five week intervals during late-November to May (late-spring to late-autumn) and ten week intervals from May until early-November (late-autumn to mid-spring) is recommended to maximise both pasture production and nitrogen removal, while minimising harvesting costs...|$|R
40|$|Abstract]: Sugarcane {{farmers in}} Bundaberg have had {{limited access to}} {{irrigation}} water over the last ten years. The district {{has the potential of}} growing 3. 8 million tonnes of sugarcane. However, a series of dry seasons saw this reduce to 2. 1 million tonnes in 2002. Compounding the effects of both dry seasons and limited water supplies has been a 30 % reduction in the sugar price over this period. The irrigation requirement of sugarcane in the Bundaberg area is 8 ML/ha. The original allocated volume for sugarcane production in this area was 4. 5 ML/ha (based on 1970 production areas). However, as the area under production has increased and announced allocations in each year has reduced, this allocation is now equivalent to an application volume of about 2 ML/ha A change from the traditional practice of full irrigation is required as water supplies become depleted. As there were no clear guidelines on how growers could respond to diminishing water supplies, this research investigated opportunities to fine tune irrigation practices and the performance of irrigation systems (ie. low cost solutions) that would assist growers to maximise sugarcane yield. A grower survey was initially conducted to identify current practice and opportunities for change. Field investigations focused on the performance of water winch and furrow irrigation systems, which make up 91 % of the irrigated area in the district. As most of these application systems have insufficient capacity to meet crop demands opportunities to schedule irrigations were limited to start up after rain. Improvements in irrigation system performance were found to provide the greatest potential to increase sugarcane yield under conditions of limited water. Investigations identified that irrigation performance could be significantly improved through relatively minor adjustment. Field trials found that wind speed and direction significantly influenced the performance of <b>travelling</b> gun <b>irrigators.</b> Although growers were generally aware of the effects of wind, meteorological data suggested that the opportunity to operate water winches in low wind conditions is limited. Changing to a taper nozzle under moderate to high wind conditions will reduce the effect of wind on performance. This practice was found to improve the uniformity (measured by Christiansen’s Uniformity Coefficient, CU) by 16 %. The grower survey indicated that there was no preference towards the use of taper nozzles in windy conditions. Additional trial work developed a relationship between the variation in water applied to the field through non uniformity and sugarcane yield. An 8 % reduction in yield was determined for a 10 % reduction in CU. This indicated that changing to a taper nozzle could potentially increase sugarcane yield by 15 % in high wind conditions. Other settings, which also influenced uniformity, included lane spacing and gun arc angle Simple changes to the operation of furrow irrigation systems were also found to dramatically improve irrigation performance. Field measurements in combination with simulation modelling of irrigation events using SIRMOD II identified that current irrigation performance ranged in application efficiency from 45 to 99 % (mean of 79 %) and a distribution uniformity from 71 to 93 % (mean of 82 %). Both application efficiency and distribution uniformity were increased to greater than 90 % and 84 % respectively, except on a cracking clay soil. Improvements in application efficiency and distribution uniformity were achieved by adjusting furrow flow rate (cup size), turning the irrigation off at the right time (ie. just as it {{reached the end of the}} field) and banking the end of the field. Growers had a good understanding of the correct cut off time and were attentive to reducing run off through either banking ends or tail water return. However, growers had a poor understanding of the significance of furrow flow rate. Other opportunities to improve irrigation performance on high infiltration soils included alternate furrow irrigation and shallow cultivation practices which maintained compaction in the interspace and reduced infiltration. Soil moisture and crop growth measurements indicated that sugarcane yield could be maximised by starting the irrigation rotation earlier after rainfall (ie. at a deficit equal to the irrigation amount). These observations were modelled using the crop simulation model APSIM sugar to assess the strategy over a longer time interval and the influence of seasonal variation. Simulation modelling showed that final sugarcane yields were not sensitive to irrigation start-up strategies. Yields for the start-up strategies modelled varied by less than 5 tc/ha. This minor difference occurred as the crop yield was driven by the total amount of water available to the plant. The limited amount of irrigation water available to the plant (2 to 3 ML/ha) had only a minor effect on the water balance and no significant change to effective rainfall between strategies. The greatest difference in yield occurred between irrigation treatments when water was left over at the end of the season (9. 2 tc/ha). Starting irrigation earlier after rainfall events (on a 14 day rotation) provided the greatest opportunity to use all of the available irrigation supply. By comparison, delaying the application of the first irrigation after rainfall resulted in some of the irrigation water not being applied in 30 % of years...|$|R
