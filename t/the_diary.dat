5|$|Before their {{collaboration}} on <b>the</b> <b>Diary,</b> {{the brothers}} each pursued successful careers on the stage. George originated {{nine of the}} principal comedian roles in the Gilbert and Sullivan operas over 12 years from 1877 to 1889.

Before embarking on his stage career, Weedon had worked as an artist and illustrator. <b>The</b> <b>Diary</b> was the brothers' only mature collaboration. Most of its humour derives from Charles Pooter's unconscious and unwarranted sense of his own importance, and the frequency with which this delusion is punctured by gaffes and minor social humiliations. In an era of rising expectations within the lower-middle classes, the daily routines and modest ambitions described in <b>the</b> <b>Diary</b> were instantly recognised by its contemporary readers, and provided later generations with a glimpse of the past that it became fashionable to imitate.|$|E

500|$|On 22 April 1983 a {{press release}} from Stern {{announced}} the existence of <b>the</b> <b>diaries</b> and their forthcoming publication; a press conference was announced for 25 April.

Irving was receiving calls from international news companies—the BBC, The Observer, Newsweek, Bild Zeitung—and he was informing them all that <b>the</b> <b>diaries</b> were fakes. <b>The</b> German Chancellor, Helmut Kohl, {{also said that he}} could not believe <b>the</b> <b>diaries</b> were genuine. <b>The</b> following day The Times published the news that their Sunday sister paper had the serialisation rights for the UK; the edition also carried an extensive piece by Trevor-Roper with his opinion on the authenticity and importance of the discovery.
