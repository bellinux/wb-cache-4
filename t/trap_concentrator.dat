40|$|A Purge and <b>Trap</b> <b>Concentrator</b> {{has been}} used to analyze various {{volatile}} organic compounds in water, operat-ing several parameters affecting the extraction efficiencies of these compounds. The object {{of the present study was}} to observe the purge efficiencies of 40 volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in water, according to the change of parameters (purge time, dry purge time, sample temperature), and to determine the optimum condi-tion of analysis of VOCs. The Purge and <b>Trap</b> <b>Concentrator</b> was interfaced with a narrow capillary connected to a gas chromatography mass spectrometer. At this condition, the detection limits of VOCs were in the range of 0. 1 - 0. 5 µg/L...|$|E
40|$|Accumulation of {{volatile}} {{emissions from}} plants grown in tightly closed growth chambers may have allelopathic or phytotoxic properties. Whole air {{analysis of a}} closed chamber includes both biotic and abiotic volatile emissions. A method for characterization and quantification of biogenic emissions solely from plantlets was developed to investigate this complex mixture of volatile organic compounds. Volatile organic compounds from potato (Solanum tuberosum L. cv. Norland) were isolated, separated and identified using an in-line configuration consisting of a purge and <b>trap</b> <b>concentrator</b> with sparging vessels coupled to a GC/MS system. Analyses identified plant volatile compounds: transcaryophyllene, alpha-humulene, thiobismethane, hexanal, cis- 3 -hexen- 1 -ol, and cis- 3 -hexenyl acetate...|$|E
40|$|A purge and <b>trap</b> <b>concentrator</b> {{coupled to}} gas {{chromatography}} {{was used to}} quantify dimethylsulphide in distilled beverages. A very good performance was obtained using a HP-FFAP column and a mass selective detector operating in SIM mode (m/z 62) : detection limit 8 x 10 - 9 mol L- 1; good repeatability and total time of analysis 25 minutes. The method has been applied for sixty samples of alcoholic beverages (cachaças, tiquiras, grappas, whiskies, brandies, vodkas, rum and a tequila). The cachaças exhibit the highest content of dimethylsulphide (median 3. 16 x 10 - 4 mol L- 1), followed by grappa (median 1. 45 x 10 - 4 mol L- 1). The presence of dimethylsulphide was not observed in the samples of rum...|$|E
5000|$|P/T (Purge-and-Trap) system; An {{inert gas}} is bubbled through an aqueous sample causing {{insoluble}} volatile chemicals to be purged from the matrix. The volatiles are 'trapped' on an absorbent column (known as a <b>trap</b> or <b>concentrator)</b> at ambient temperature. The trap is then heated and the volatiles are directed into the carrier gas stream. Samples requiring preconcentration or purification can be introduced via such a system, usually {{hooked up to}} the S/SL port.|$|R
40|$|A ray trace {{model of}} the light <b>trapping</b> {{filtered}} <b>concentrator</b> spectrum splitting architecture is presented. The scripted ray trace allows for examination of non-idealities in materials and design that were not addressed in previous analytical investigations of this optical design. The design of the angle restricting elements is examined with regards to optical efficiency and system efficiency. In addition, the scripted ray trace enables rapid evaluation of multiple candidate filter sets and optimization of the optical design for each set via a gradient ascent algorithm. A discussion of filter design considerations and insight provided by the ray trace model evaluations is presented...|$|R

[...] The target analytes are extracted and mixed with water and introduced into an airtight chamber. [...] An inert gas such as Nitrogen (N2) is bubbled through the water; this is known as purging or sparging. [...] The volatile compounds move into the headspace above the water and are drawn along a pressure gradient (caused by the introduction of the purge gas) out of the chamber. [...] The volatile compounds are drawn along a heated line onto a 'trap'. [...] The trap is a column of adsorbent material at ambient temperature that holds the compounds by returning them to the liquid phase. [...] The trap is then heated and the sample compounds are introduced to the GC-MS column via a volatiles interface, which is a split inlet system. [...] P GC-MS is particularly suited to volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and BTEX compounds (aromatic compounds associated with petroleum).|$|R
40|$|Recent {{changes in}} {{environmental}} regulatory paradigms, such as EPA’s performance-based measurement systems (PBMS), are lowering method compliance barriers for laboratories {{working under the}} Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). One of the stated goals of PBMS is to educate the regulators and the regulated community on the inherent and intended flexibility of SW- 846 methods. Operating under EPA’s PBMS guidelines, laboratories could employ the flexibility of SW- 846 methods to simplify and improve purge and trap GC/MS volatile organic analyses (P/T GC/MS VOAs). Laboratories performing Method 8260 B for P/T GC/MS VOAs have two basic GC configuration options: wide bore columns connected to the mass spectrometer through a jet separator or narrow bore columns directly interfaced to the mass spectrometer. SW- 846 methodology recognizes both approaches as valid. The narrow bore column/direct interface approach is the better of the two techniques for most analyses when certain modifications are made. When newer purge and <b>trap</b> <b>concentrator</b> designs are employed and when several Method 8260 B instrument parameters are modified dramatic performance benefits result. This “enhanced ” narrow bore column/direct interface approach produces results such as reduced susceptibility to column contamination by high level samples, improved chromatographic behavior of early eluting and closely eluting compounds, analysis times under 20 minutes, and improved hardware ruggedness. The outcome is better quality data, higher sample throughput, and fewer instrument mechanical failures...|$|E
40|$|Since the 1950 ’s, mercury {{found in}} the {{environment}} {{has been known to}} have serious effects on human health. 1 Most natural waters contain trace levels of methylmercury on the order of 10 to a few hundred pg/L. Monitoring methylmercury at these levels is important because of its high toxicity to humans. This method describes the automated analysis of methylmercury in water samples by aqueous phase ethylation and CVAFS (cold vapor atomic fluorescence spectrophotometer) detection. The detection limit for this method is 20 -pg/L of methylmercury as Hg. This method is automated using the Tekmar Precept II autosampler, Tekmar 3000 purge and <b>trap</b> <b>concentrator</b> and Tekmar Cryofocuser. 2 The three steps of this method are 1) sample clean-up, 2) derivatization and 3) analysis. The first step, sample clean-up removes dissolved organic carbon (DOC) which constitutes a serious interferant in the determination of methylmercury. This process is accomplished by distilling the sample. The second step, derivatization, transforms the methylmercury and species such as Hg+ 2 into methylethylmercury and diethyl mercury respectively. These derivatives are volatile and can be purged from the sample along with any trace levels of atomic mercury (Hg 0). The third step in this process is analysis. The analysis is accomplished by purging the volatile derivatives from the sample and capturing the analytes onto a Tenax ® trap. The analytes are then desorbed into a Hewlett Packard 5890 gas chromatograph (GC). A pyrolysis furnace {{at the end of the}} GC colum...|$|E

40|$|In {{this study}} we present a {{theoretical}} and experimental analysis of the application of photonic band stop filters on top of photovoltaic fluorescent concentrators {{in order to increase}} the photon collection efficiency. The light guiding effect of the fluorescent concentrator relies on total internal reflection. The escape cone of total internal reflection is their major loss mechanism. Our ray tracing simulation allows to calculate the beneficial effect of photonic band stop reflection filters, which reduce these losses, and to simulate the angular distribution of the light <b>trapped</b> in the <b>concentrator.</b> We present simulations of the optical properties of 1 D and 3 D photonic structures and how 3 D structures are realized with colloidal opals. We also show that the application of a 1 D photonic structure increases the efficiency of a real system by 20 % relative...|$|R
