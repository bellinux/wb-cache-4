5|$|Sandown Castle was a Device Fort {{built at}} Sandown on the Isle of Wight by Henry VIII in 1545 {{to protect against}} the threat of French attack. Constructed from stone with angular bastions, its design was a hybrid of Italian {{military}} architectural <b>thinking</b> <b>with</b> traditional English military design. The site was raided by a French force that summer while the fortification was still being constructed. The site suffered from coastal erosion and the castle was demolished in 1631.|$|E

25|$|Richard Rorty {{argues in}} Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature that {{contemporary}} analytic philosophy mistakenly imitates scientific methods. In addition, he denounces the traditional epistemological perspectives of representationalism and correspondence theory that rely upon {{the independence of}} knowers and observers from phenomena and the passivity of natural phenomena in relation to consciousness. As a proponent of anti-foundationalism and anti-essentialism within a pragmatist framework, he echoes the postmodern strain of conventionalism and relativism, but opposes much of postmodern <b>thinking</b> <b>with</b> his commitment to social liberalism.|$|E
25|$|Ontotheology {{means the}} {{ontology}} of God and/or {{the theology of}} being. While the term was first used by Immanuel Kant, it has only come into broader philosophical parlance with the significance it took for Martin Heidegger's later thought. While, for Heidegger, the term is used to critique the whole tradition of 'Western metaphysics', much recent scholarship has sought to question whether 'ontotheology' developed {{at a certain point}} in the metaphysical tradition, with many seeking to equate the development of 'ontotheological' <b>thinking</b> <b>with</b> the development of modernity, and Duns Scotus often being cited as the first 'ontotheologian'.|$|E
25|$|The {{expenditure}} of artillery ammunition {{on the first}} day had been about 30 percent of the field-gun ammunition in the First Army, which was equivalent to 17 days' shell production per gun. After the Battle of Neuve Chapelle, Field Marshal Sir John French reported to Field Marshal Lord Kitchener, British Secretary of State for War, that fatigue and the shortage of ammunition had forced a suspension of the offensive. On 15 March French abandoned the offensive as the supply of field-gun ammunition was inadequate. News of the ammunition shortage led to the Shell Crisis of 1915 which, along with the failed attack on the Dardanelles, brought down the Liberal British government under the Premiership of H. H. Asquith. He formed a new coalition government and appointed Lloyd George as Minister of Munitions. It was a recognition that the whole economy would have to be adapted for war, if the Allies were to prevail on the Western Front. The battle also affected British tactical <b>thinking</b> <b>with</b> the idea that infantry offensives accompanied by artillery barrages could break the stalemate of trench warfare.|$|E

25|$|Prior to his father’s death, Nathan of Gaza began {{studying}} under Jacob Hagiz. The {{relationship between these}} two religious devotees would continue for many years. In fact, Nathan of Gaza would spend a majority of his life – up until about 1664 – with his teacher at a rabbinic college. During this academic period, documents were written that described his interest in and persistence towards academic work. It is {{said that he was}} “…an extremely gifted student, of quick apprehension and a brilliant intellect. His talents… noteworthy for their rare combination of intellectual power and capacity for profound <b>thinking</b> <b>with</b> imagination and strong emotional sensitivity…” In and of itself, Nathan of Gaza was an extremely gifted pupil. His intellectual brilliance and his intense focus on his studies, however, did not limit or prevent him – as occurs with most intensely devoted religious individuals –from experiencing many of the Jewish rites of passage. In fact, at the age of nineteen or twenty, he married the daughter of an affluent Jew named Samuel Lissabona. The nuptials were believed to have taken place {{before the end of the}} year 1663, when he joined his wife’s family in Gaza. There, he was able to focus considerably on his religious studies.|$|E
25|$|After an inauspicious {{start to}} his Test career, Warne revolutionised cricket <b>thinking</b> <b>with</b> his mastery of leg spin, which many cricket {{followers}} {{had come to}} regard as a dying art due to its immense difficulty of execution. For all his on-pitch and off-pitch controversies, Warne's place in cricketing posterity has been assured {{by the fact that}} he has overturned the domination of cricket by fast bowling that had prevailed for two decades before his debut. Despite the presence of high quality spin bowlers such as the Indian spin quartet of the 1970s or Abdul Qadir on the Test scene, Australia's fast bowlers Dennis Lillee and Jeff Thomson had dominated cricket in the early 1970s. Furthermore, from 1976 until the early 1990s, the West Indies had lost only one (ill-tempered and controversial) Test series with a bowling attack almost exclusively comprising fast bowlers. In the early 1990s, with the West Indies on the wane, Waqar Younis and Wasim Akram of Pakistan were assuming the mantle of the world's most feared bowling combination. It was in that context that Warne's tormenting of batsmen became so significant rather than his actual statistics. His humiliation of Mike Gatting and subsequent dominance, in particular, of English and South African batsmen, provided a welcome sight for cricket watchers weary of the relentless intimidation by West Indian bowlers of the 1980s and 1990s. His treatment of South African batsman Daryll Cullinan was such that Cullinan was said to have sought the help of a therapist to overcome Warne's psychological hold.|$|E

500|$|Like most {{episodes of}} Parks and Recreation, {{many of the}} scenes in [...] "The Reporter" [...] were improvised by the actors. For example, Chris Pratt changed the {{original}} line about Mark, [...] "He's <b>thinking</b> <b>with</b> his wiener instead of his brain," [...] to [...] "He's <b>thinking</b> <b>with</b> {{the head of his}} wiener, instead of the head of his brain." [...] Aziz Ansari also improvised the line about Mark, [...] "That dude has stuck it in some crazy chicks." [...] Schur was surprised NBC censors allowed either of the lines to stay in the episode. The clip of Leslie trying to confront a raccoon loose in the city hall building was originally filmed for a Parks and Recreation commercial, but was later included into this episode. The scene was filmed to establish a running gag that Pawnee has a terrible raccoon infestation problem. The J.J.'s Diner eatery featured in the episode was named after Goor's wife. Poehler speedily eats tremendous amounts of whipped cream on her waffles. This was inspired by Parks and Recreation story editor Rachel Axler, who producer Morgan Sackett said is [...] "a tiny, bird-like woman" [...] who eats enormous amounts of whipped cream.|$|E

500|$|The {{influence}} of Imagism {{can be seen}} clearly {{in the work of}} the Objectivist poets, who came to prominence in the 1930s under the auspices of Pound and Williams. The Objectivists worked mainly in free verse. Clearly linking Objectivism's principles with Imagism's, Louis Zukofsky insisted, in his introduction to the 1931 Objectivist issue of Poetry, on writing [...] "which is the detail, not mirage, of seeing, of <b>thinking</b> <b>with</b> the things as they exist, and of directing them along a line of melody." [...] Zukofsky was a major influence on the Language poets, who carried the Imagist focus on formal concerns to a high level of development. Basil Bunting, another Objectivist poet, was a key figure in the early development of the British Poetry Revival, a loose movement that also absorbed the {{influence of}} the San Francisco Renaissance poets.|$|E

500|$|The Robert Bolt play A Man For All Seasons {{focuses on}} the {{conscience}} of Catholic lawyer Thomas More in his struggle with King Henry VIII ("the loyal subject is more bounden to be loyal to his conscience than to any other thing"). George Orwell wrote his novel Nineteen Eighty-Four on the isolated island of Jura, Scotland to describe how a man (Winston Smith) attempts to develop critical conscience in a totalitarian state which watches every action {{of the people and}} manipulates their <b>thinking</b> <b>with</b> a mixture of propaganda, endless war and thought control through language control (double think and newspeak) to the point where prisoners look up to and even love their torturers.

500|$|The {{issue is}} often {{discussed}} in the media in terms of offensiveness or political correctness, which reduces it to feelings and opinions, and prevents full understanding of the historical, psychological and sociological context provided by academic research on {{the negative effects of}} the use of Native American names and images by sports teams. The effect of stereotyping on high or low expectations, confidence, and academic performance has been well-established. This effect is enhanced due to the invisibility of Native Americans in mainstream society and media, leaving stereotypes as the primary basis for thinking about the abilities and traits associated with Natives, including the roles and opportunities Natives Americans envision for themselves. Furthermore, even when stereotypes are positive (e.g. [...] "Natives Americans are spiritual"), they may have a limiting, detrimental effect on individuals. Stereotyping may directly affect the academic performance and self-esteem of Native American youth, whose people face high rates of suicide, unemployment, and poverty. Euro-Americans exposed to mascots {{may be more likely to}} believe not only that such stereotypes are true, but that Native Americans have no identity beyond these stereotypes. Research indicates that exposure to any stereotypes increased the likelihood of stereotypical <b>thinking</b> <b>with</b> regard to other minority groups in addition to the target of the stereotype, a [...] "spreading effect".|$|E
