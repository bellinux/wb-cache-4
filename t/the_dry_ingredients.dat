50|$|Several wine grapes, {{including}} Clairette blanche, Piquepoul, Bianchetta Trevigiana, Catarratto and Trebbiano, {{are generally}} {{used as the}} base ingredients for vermouths. From these grapes, a low-alcohol white wine is produced by vermouth manufacturers. The wine may be aged {{for a short while}} before the addition of other ingredients. For sweet vermouths, sugar syrup is added before the wine is fortified with extra alcohol. The added alcohol is usually a neutral grape spirit, but may also come from vegetable sources such as sugar beets. The wine is then placed in large barrels or tanks to which <b>the</b> <b>dry</b> <b>ingredients</b> have already been added.

40|$|The main {{objectives}} of the project were to establish relationships between process variables and product physicochemical/functional characteristics {{in the course of}} processing and <b>drying</b> new dairy-based <b>ingredients</b> such as high-fat and protein-rich products in regular and agglomerated forms. By establishing processing protocols, R&D users of <b>the</b> <b>ingredient</b> <b>drying</b> facilities of Moorepark Technology Ltd may be able to predict the process variables necessary for desired end-product specifications to be achieved, and thus make experimentation more efficient and cost effective, as well as facilitate small scale production runs and sample preparation for market development purposes. Particular emphasis was placed on the development of high fat cream and fat-filled powders, flavour-delivery systems and protein-enriched ingredients. The major achievement of this project is that it is now possible to confidently select the appropriate processing conditions during <b>the</b> spray <b>drying</b> of <b>ingredients</b> in order to attain desired end-product specifications. Based on the use of <b>the</b> newly-installed Tall-form <b>drier,</b> <b>the</b> project succeeded in correlating the effects of process parameters of this technicallyadvanced pilot plant with the physicochemical properties of powders containing varying fat (20 - 80 %) and protein contents. In general, the physicochemical characteristics of fat-filled and cream-filled powders with similar fat contents were similar except for higher solubility index values (range 0. 1 - 0. 6) {{in the case of the}} former particularly in the range 26 - 28 % fat.

2500|$|Because <b>the</b> <b>dry</b> {{powdered}} <b>ingredients</b> must {{be mixed}} and bonded together for extrusion and cutting into grains {{to maintain the}} blend, size reduction and mixing is done while the ingredients are damp, usually with water. After 1800, instead of forming grains by hand or with sieves, the damp mill-cake was pressed in molds to increase its density and extract the liquid, forming press-cake. The pressing took varying amounts of time, depending on conditions such as atmospheric humidity. [...] The hard, dense product was broken again into tiny pieces, which were separated with sieves to produce a uniform product for each purpose: coarse powders for cannons, finer grained powders for muskets, and the finest for small hand guns and priming. Inappropriately fine-grained powder often caused cannons to burst before the projectile could move down the barrel, due to the high initial spike in pressure. Mammoth powder with large grains, made for Rodman's 15-inch cannon, reduced the pressure to only 20 percent as high as ordinary cannon powder would have produced.|$|R

Several original cement compositions {{were obtained by}} mixing metastable crystalline calcium carbonate phases with metastable amorphous or crystalline calcium phosphate powders in aqueous medium.

The recrystallization of metastable CaP varieties led to a final cement consisting of a highly carbonated poorly crystalline apatite (PCA) analogous to bone mineral associated with various amounts of vaterite and/or aragonite. The presence of controlled amounts of CaCO 3 with a higher solubility than the apatite formed in the well-developed calcium phosphate cements might be of interest to increase resorption rates in biomedical cement and favor its replacement by bone tissue.

50|$|The dry {{mix method}} {{involves}} placing <b>the</b> <b>dry</b> <b>ingredients</b> into a hopper and then conveying them pneumatically through a hose to the nozzle.
