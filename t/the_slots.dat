5|$|The thirteenth {{season was}} coached by former UFC Heavyweight {{champion}} Brock Lesnar and Junior dos Santos, {{who would later}} go {{on to win the}} same title. This season featured welterweights and removed the elimination bouts to get into the house, with 14 fighters immediately gaining entry into the house. The first day of training saw Myles Jury pull out of the competition with a knee injury. The wildcard made another appearance, with Javier Torres and Chuck O'Neil getting <b>the</b> <b>slots,</b> leading to a submission victory for O'Neil. The final of this season saw Tony Ferguson defeat Ramsey Nijem via KO in the first round.|$|E
5|$|When first built, {{the castle}} would have held three tiers of artillery, {{two in the}} front battery and a third layer in the central tower. The keep was {{originally}} protected by a moat, since filled in, with a drawbridge, of which only <b>the</b> <b>slots</b> now survive. The castle could have been protected at short-range with hand guns, although the gunloops for these were of an antiquated design for the period, and a moated earthwork, , was subsequently built {{to the rear of}} the castle to provide additional protection.|$|E
5|$|British Airways' {{main base}} is at London Heathrow Airport, {{but it also}} has a major {{presence}} at Gatwick Airport. It also has a base at London City Airport (LCY), where its subsidiary BA CityFlyer is the largest operator. BA had previously operated a significant hub at Manchester Airport. Manchester to New York (JFK) services were withdrawn; later all international services outside London ceased when the subsidiary BA Connect was sold. Passengers wishing to travel internationally with BA either to or from regional UK destinations must now transfer in London. Heathrow Airport is dominated by British Airways, which owns 40% of <b>the</b> <b>slots</b> available at the airport. The majority of BA services operate from Terminal 5, with the exception of some short-haul and mid-haul flights at Terminal 1 arising from the purchase of BMI and some short-haul flights at Terminal 3, owing to a lack of capacity at Terminal 5. With the imminent opening of the brand-new Terminal 2 in 2014, Star Alliance airlines will progressively be moving all their services into the new terminal and Terminal 1 will be closed for demolition in due course. British Airways' services will then be concentrated in Terminals 3 and 5.|$|E

That is, <b>the</b> cymbal <b>slotted</b> diaphragm is smaller than <b>the</b> <b>slotted</b> flat diaphragm in stress, so <b>the</b> cymbal <b>slotted</b> diaphragm has a high reliability.|$|R
25|$|Munroe {{figured that}} the best way to make pencils was by {{starting}} with a quarter inch slab of cedar wood. He then would cut <b>the</b> <b>slots</b> for his special formula graphite paste and fill them. He would let the paste air dry. The next step was to glue an eighth inch veneer of wood over <b>the</b> <b>slots.</b> The final step was to saw the slab into pencils. This resulted in a wooden lead graphite pencil that was just under a half inch thick.|$|E
25|$|Because <b>the</b> <b>slots</b> are {{slightly}} {{longer than the}} biscuits, {{it is still possible}} to slide the panels sideways after the joint is assembled (before the glue sets). This fact makes the biscuit joiner easy to use, because it does not require extreme accuracy or jigs to achieve perfect joints.|$|E
25|$|Instead of disks, {{most modern}} {{mechanical}} sirens use two concentric cylinders, which have slots parallel to their length. The inner cylinder rotates while the outer one remains stationary. As air under pressure flows out of <b>the</b> <b>slots</b> {{of the inner}} cylinder and then escapes through <b>the</b> <b>slots</b> of the outer cylinder, the flow is periodically interrupted, creating a tone. The earliest such sirens were developed during 1877–1880 by James Douglass and George Slight (1859–1934) of Trinity House; the final version was first installed in 1887 at the Ailsa Craig lighthouse in Scotland's Firth of Clyde. When commercial electric power became available, sirens were no longer driven by external sources of compressed air, but by electric motors, which generated the necessary flow of air via a simple centrifugal fan, which was incorporated into the siren’s inner cylinder.|$|E

40|$|In {{the usual}} rod and <b>slot</b> paradox, <b>the</b> rod, if it falls, was {{expected}} to fall into <b>the</b> <b>slot</b> due to gravity. Many thought experiments have been conducted where the presence of gravity is eliminated with <b>the</b> rod and <b>slot</b> approaching each other along a line joining their centers, whereby the considerations come strictly under Special Relativity. In these experiments the line of motion is not parallel to either the axis of the rod or <b>the</b> <b>slot.</b> In this paper we consider in detail the two cases when the rod does fall into <b>the</b> <b>slot</b> and when <b>the</b> rod does not fall into <b>the</b> <b>slot,</b> each from <b>the</b> perspective of the co-moving frames of the rod and <b>the</b> <b>slot.</b> We show that whether the rod falls into <b>the</b> <b>slot</b> as determined by Galilean kinematics is also valid under relativistic kinematics; this determination does not depend upon {{the magnitude of the}} velocity, but only on the proper lengths and the proper angles of <b>the</b> rod and <b>slot</b> with <b>the</b> line of motion. Our conclusion emphasizes the fact that the passing (or crashing) of the rod as a wholesome event is unaffected by relativistic kinematics.

25|$|Rotary vane {{compressors}} {{consist of}} a rotor {{with a number of}} blades inserted in radial slots in the rotor. The rotor is mounted offset in a larger housing that is either circular or a more complex shape. As the rotor turns, blades slide in and out of <b>the</b> <b>slots</b> keeping contact with the outer wall of the housing. Thus, a series of increasing and decreasing volumes is created by the rotating blades. Rotary Vane compressors are, with piston compressors one of the oldest of compressor technologies.|$|E
25|$|All {{sorts of}} {{attempts}} were made to reduce the side lobes. One notable success was made in April 1942, with a new design with a polystyrene dielectric material partially filling {{the leading edge of the}} waveguide. The presence of the dielectric slowed the passage of the signal, effectively compressing it, so that the distance between <b>the</b> <b>slots</b> could be reduced and the antenna as a whole was smaller. This allowed there to be more slots in the same sized antenna, which helped reduce the side lobes. However, all of these slotted designs proved to have poor gain.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>slotted</b> line {{works by}} {{sampling}} the electric field inside {{the transmission line}} with the probe. For accuracy, {{it is important that}} the probe disturbs the field as little as possible. For this reason the probe diameter and slot width are kept small (usually around 1 mm) and the probe is inserted in no further than necessary. It is also necessary in waveguide slotted lines to place <b>the</b> <b>slot</b> at a position where the current in the waveguide walls is parallel to <b>the</b> <b>slot.</b> <b>The</b> current will then not be disturbed by the presence of <b>the</b> <b>slot</b> as long as it is not too wide. For the dominant mode this is on the centre-line of the broad face of the waveguide, but for some other modes it may need to be off-centre. This is not an issue for the co-axial line because this operates in the TEM (transverse electromagnetic) mode and hence the current is everywhere parallel to <b>the</b> <b>slot.</b> <b>The</b> <b>slot</b> may be tapered at its ends to avoid discontinuities causing reflections.|$|R
