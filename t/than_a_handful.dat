5|$|The Spirit Fruit Society was a communitarian {{group in}} the United States that was {{organized}} {{after a period of}} repeated business depressions during the 1890s. The society had its beginnings in Lisbon, Ohio and, over the years of its existence moved to Ingleside, Illinois and, finally, to California. Plagued by rumor, suspicion, and attacks in the press during its early years, the group remained active until 1930. Although it never numbered more <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>handful</b> of adherents, the Spirit Fruit Society existed longer and more successfully than any other American utopian group.|$|E
5|$|At {{the dawn}} of the 19th century, less <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>handful</b> of academically trained architects were active in Norway, most of them {{military}} officers having studied civil engineering. The market for architects was limited in a sparsely inhabited country with no capital city, no court and no important government institutions. Architecture was of interest mainly to a limited group of wealthy merchants and landowners. However, toward the close of the previous century, this group saw a remarkable increase in prosperity. Large fortunes were made by a few, who then sought to surround themselves with buildings and gardens appropriate to their social position. Well connected internationally, these people were acquainted with the latest trends in architecture. Neoclassical structures were much in demand.|$|E
5|$|This {{conversation}} {{coincided with}} the Gotha Raids in which German heavy bombers attacked London. He attempted interceptions against the high-flying machines and on 13 June finally got to within range of one. He fired but it swerved and resumed course. He chased the formation 21 miles out to sea but could not get closer than 500 feet. On 7 July he succeeded in hitting the Gotha crewed by Leutnant Erwin Kollberg and Walter Aschoff (of bomber unit Bogohl 3). He damaged a second and narrowly avoided a collision with the machine as he flew by. On one raid a Gotha gunner's bullet struck his windshield. The raids continued and British aerial defences did not gain more <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>handful</b> of successes against the Gothas.|$|E

50|$|While Q-FISH {{supplies}} {{accurate information}} about telomere length, its relevance {{can be extended}} by combining Q-FISH with other FISH related techniques, such as flow-FISH.

Conversely, unlike Q-FISH, flow-FISH is unable to determine telomere length in a particular chromosome within an individual cell. However, {{it should be noted}} that although Q-FISH is generally considered low-throughput and not suitable for population studies, groups have developed high-throughput (HT) Q-FISH protocols that use automated machinery to perform Q-FISH on interphase nuclei in 96well plates.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Dynamic factor {{models and}} dynamic {{stochastic}} general equilibrium (DSGE) models {{are widely used}} for empirical research in macroeconomics. The empirical factor literature argues that the co-movement of large panels of macroeconomic and financial data can be captured by relatively few common unobserved factors. Similarly, the dynamics in DSGE models are often governed by <b>a</b> <b>handful</b> of state variables and exogenous processes such as preference and/or technology shocks. Boivin and Giannoni (2006) combine a DSGE and a factor model into a data-rich DSGE model, in which DSGE states are factors and factor dynamics are subject to DSGE model implied restrictions. We compare a data-rich DSGE model with a standard New Keynesian core to an empirical dynamic factor model by estimating both on a rich panel of U. S. macroeconomic and financial data compiled by Stock and Watson (2008). We find that the spaces spanned by the empirical factors and by the data-rich DSGE model states are very close. This proximity allows us to propagate monetary policy and technology innovations in an otherwise non-structural dynamic factor model to obtain predictions for many more series <b>than</b> just <b>a</b> <b>handful</b> of traditiona...|$|R
