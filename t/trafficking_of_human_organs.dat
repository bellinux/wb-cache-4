40|$|Transplantation {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{beautiful}} achievements for humanity in the last century and became the last hope to many patients. As other beautiful achievements, it has been used by criminals. The future of transplantation will be focused on tissue and cells transplantation. Trafficking of human beings to organ removal and <b>trafficking</b> <b>of</b> <b>human</b> <b>organs</b> are an early stage of trafficking on tissues and cells comparable with slaves trafficking in the 17 th and 18 th century. As 400 years ago, the motive for the crime is development, economy and profit. Transplant surgery is the modern “cotton gin” to this new commerce. Poverty exploitation, unprotected people, are always the victims. Even so, there are some differences since then. The paying buyers are the patients themselves and the “cotton” transplanted is not so harmless. Unsafe tissues and cells inappropriately collected and allocated can be so dangerous to the recipient and his family, that the dreamed transplant/implant becomes a nightmare. Beyond the trafficking crime, there is a most dangerous associated crime that is the crime of spreading dangerous infectious diseases...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{examines}} the socio-historical {{context of the}} rise and significance of criminology and criminal justice in the societies of South Asia. The growth of a scientific specialty in a society is closely linked to its socio-historical evolutions. Applying the concept of C. Wright Mills ’ “sociological imagination, ” the paper argues that the historical process of globalization has created two competing demands {{in the realm of}} governance in the nations of South Asia. The first is the demand for the growth of the values of democracy, justice, and human rights. This has raised the need for redefining the traditional meaning and boundaries of crime, punishment, and justice. The second is the spread of new global crimes. A new set of trans-boarder and transnational crimes such as illegal human trafficking, illegal drug trades, illegal trading and <b>trafficking</b> <b>of</b> <b>human</b> <b>organs,</b> illegal trading of conventional weapons and nuclear materials, and cyber crimes are rapidly spreading in South Asia. The rise of new global organized criminal groups and new groups of global terrorists are major threats to governance and national security. These two competing demands— the need for redefining the traditional institutions of crime and justice and the need to contain and control the global crimes—are contributing to the rise of criminology and criminal justice in South Asia...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{explores the}} commodification {{of the human}} body that emerges from the relationship between late capitalism and biomedical advances in transplant technology. A closer look at the circuits of organ trade shows that the <b>trafficking</b> <b>of</b> <b>human</b> <b>organs</b> perpetuates the structures of economic exploitation that characterised colonialism in its heyday: organs travel from formerly colonized nations to former metropoles, from black/brown bodies to white ones, from poor to rich. In the wake of biotechnology, I argue, the commodification {{of the human body}} is taking on new, predatory forms that can only be understood in the context of (de) colonization, globalization and late capitalism. I begin by examining organ commodification in relation to Karl Marx's theorisation of the commodification of labour-power, and then proceed to examine organ harvesting, transplanting and trafficking as represented in three contemporary texts: Manjula Padmanabhan's play Harvest (1996), Stephen Frears's film Dirty Pretty Things (2003) and Kazuo Ishiguro's novel Never Let Me Go (2005). These texts grapple with contemporary debates around organ harvesting and stage the new ethical dilemmas to which the use and abuse of transplant technologies gives rise. They engage with this newly materialised way of commoditising the body in a way that allows us to think about organ exchange, not as a transaction forever trapped between the dynamic of altruistic donation and commoditised exchange, but as a site from which to examine the fraught relationship that exists between organ donors/sellers and organ receivers/buyers. A comparison of all three works reveals the need to understand transplant technologies and the commoditization of the human body that they permit as inextricable from the empowering yet disturbingly predatory effects that biotechnologies have on our understanding of death, where death is increasingly imagined as a fate that technology can endlessly keep at bay. Drawing attention to themselves as literary works, these texts dare to imagine and interrogate the future that biotechnology both promises and threatens us with. In my literary-critical readings, I make a claim for literature's ability to stand as a constant counterpoint to the instrumental logic that characterises organ commodification, signalling instead, to a space beyond such instrumentality...|$|E

Considering the inevitable topological modifications occurred in surgical simulation, we adopt sparse point cloud to model the mechanics of deformable bodies while employ surface mesh to represent morphological details <b>of</b> <b>human</b> <b>organ,</b> which can not only disconnect mechanical complexity from geometrical details, but also enable precise boundary conditions to be solved with surface mesh. Results: We validate our method {{on a variety of}} challenging surgical scenarios, and the results demonstrate that our method can realistically {{and efficiently}} provide the visuo-haptic feedback for surgical simulation. Conclusions: Our method can well tackle the inefficiency limitation of mesh-based methods related to topological modifications issue, and has great potential to be adopted in practical surgical simulators...|$|R

If such exchange is permitted, this Article posits that living organ donors should be able to receive only non-cash consideration in exchange for their organs-specifically, life-long, comprehensive health care. This would minimize the health care crisis in the United States and continue to prevent the exploitation of poor Americans. This proposal would also effectively reduce the number of deaths in the United States due to the organ shortage while simultaneously reducing the number of deaths caused by the lack of adequate health care.

40|$|Objectives: The article elaborates on {{the intricacies}} brought on the Romanian Law by the adoption, on 7 July 2010, of Directive 2010 / 45 /EU of the European Parliament {{and of the}} Council on {{standards}} of quality and safety <b>of</b> <b>human</b> <b>organs</b> intended for transplantation, raising for the Romanian legal system the question of rapidly adapting its regulations and procedures to the newly introduced European standards, {{as well as the}} question of harmonizing its essential legislation by transposing Directive 2010 / 45 /EU provisions into national law. Prior Work: Liability of Public Administration for damages caused by unsafe transplant procedures represents one of the major themes, in the recent specialized literature. The problematic of informed consent to organ donations, {{as well as that of}} organ traceability represents an interesting, though insufficiently explored and exploited issue, in contemporary Romanian Law. Approach: The author applies, as research method, the analysis of jurisprudence, doctrinal writing and legal provisions in force referring to the problematic <b>of</b> the <b>human</b> <b>organs</b> transplant and donations. The paper also discusses the text of Directive 2010 / 45 /EU on standards of quality and safety <b>of</b> <b>human</b> <b>organs</b> intended for transplantation. Results: The “opting-in – opting out” dichotomy is discussed, as common standard for informed consent in the field of organ donations. The author also formulates de lege ferenda proposals. Implications: The paper interests legal practitioners confronted with the problematic <b>of</b> <b>human</b> <b>organs</b> donations, law students, as well as jurists specialized in Consumer Law and Administrative Law, since the problematic of organ transplantation also reverberates on the protection of the consumers of medical services. Value: The analysis insists on the degree of compliance of national law to the EU’s regulations when removing disparities on donor’s consent procedure or on standards of safety related to the transport <b>of</b> <b>human</b> <b>organs.</b> The paper is also enriched by a presentation of the new European standards on the National Register of living donors and on the National Data bases on serious adverse events...|$|R
