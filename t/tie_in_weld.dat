40|$|The {{effect of}} weld {{residual}} stress, and hardness profile on fatigue crack propagation <b>in</b> MIG <b>welded</b> 2024 and 7150 aluminium joints was studied. Residual stress fields <b>in</b> the <b>weld</b> were measured using neutron diffraction. Tests were performed using {{a range of}} mean stresses and on different starting defect shapes. It was found that fatigue crack propagation <b>in</b> <b>weld</b> metal and HAZ is influenced by crack morphology and also the distribution of residual stress and hardness.

Moreover, fluid flow <b>in</b> <b>welds</b> can transport inclusions to different temperature regions {{that may lead to}} repeated dissolution and growth of inclusions. These phenomena are being studied with the help of computational coupled heat transfer, fluid-flow, thermodynamic, and kinetic models.

40|$|Welding {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{prevalent}} techniques for mechanical fastening of metals. Recent developments <b>in</b> <b>welding</b> technology have led to welding techniques being more readily employed in safety-critical engineering structures. Since the existence of residual stresses and material property variation around welds affects the mechanical performance and thereby structural integrity, it is essential to improve our knowledge in understanding and modelling the mechanical response of the welded structures. The present work focuses on mechanical characterizations of such structures. This work can be broadly classified into two parts; the first part investigates the residual stress distribution <b>in</b> <b>welded</b> specimens of different metals and the second part presents investigations of mechanical properties <b>in</b> <b>welded</b> specimen using full-field optical techniques.

To numerical study fluid flow <b>in</b> <b>weld</b> pool, heat and force effects on weld pool surface must been made clear firstly. A three-dimensional numerical {{model has been}} built to study arc behavior <b>in</b> GMAW <b>welding</b> deposition-based rapid forming process. Solving the model, heat flux and pressure distributions on the cathode were derived. Calculated results show that heat flux from the arc to the cathode is related to arc temperature nearly above the cathode, and is not monotonous about radial distance within 2 mm distance away from arc axis. A maximum pressure with a value of 800 Pa happens at 1 mm away from arc axis...|$|R
