5|$|Funding issues {{meant that}} in May 2003 the Australian Broadcasting Corporation closed ABC Kids and Fly TV. In the same year, Tasmanian Digital Television {{became the first}} digital-only {{commercial}} station to be launched in the country, under Section 38A of the Broadcasting Services Act. The new station was {{a joint venture between}} existing commercial networks Southern Cross Broadcasting and WIN Television. Tasmanian Digital Television, affiliated to Network Ten, was initially available only in Hobart, before expanding to Launceston and, by early 2009, the remainder of the state. The introduction of this fifth channel resulted in significantly higher digital television <b>takeup</b> in Tasmania than other parts of the country.|$|E
25|$|Pre-school {{education}} (called Kindergarten in German), free in most states, {{is provided}} {{for all children}} between the ages of three and six years and, whilst optional, is considered a normal part of a child's education due to its high <b>takeup</b> rate. Maximum class size is around 30, each class normally being cared for by one qualified teacher and one assistant.|$|E
25|$|Backmasking {{has been}} used as a {{recording}} technique since the 1960s. In the era of magnetic tape sound recording, backmasking required that the source reel-to-reel tape actually be played backwards, which was achieved by first being wound onto the original <b>takeup</b> reel, then reversing the reels so as to use that reel as the source (this would reverse the stereo channels as well). Digital audio recording has greatly simplified the process.|$|E
25|$|Numerous {{television}} stations were launched, mainly concentrated around {{southern and eastern}} parts of the country. By {{the turn of the}} decade, the <b>takeup</b> of television had increased dramatically – by 1960 up to 70% of homes in Sydney and Melbourne had a television set. Following its introduction to regional centres and other capital cities through the late 1950s and 1960s over 90% of Australian homes in established markets had a television set. The new medium had also become highly lucrative to advertisers.|$|E
25|$|In 2011, the Institute for Public Policy Research, a UK {{think tank}} {{associated}} with the Labour Party, advocated a job creation program - with compulsory <b>takeup,</b> on pain of loss of benefits - for the long-term unemployed only. The Labour Party under Ed Miliband subsequently went into the 2015 general election with a promise to implement an even more limited Job Guarantee (specifically, part time jobs with guaranteed training included for long-term unemployed youth) if elected; however, they lost the election. This is still Labour Party policy - however, {{they are looking at}} universal basic income as a possible alternative policy.|$|E

2500|$|Where {{and how the}} zeolite {{was formed}} is an {{important}} consideration for aquaria. Most Northern hemisphere natural zeolites were formed when molten lava {{came in contact with}} sea water, thereby [...] "loading" [...] the zeolite with Na (sodium) sacrificial ions. The mechanism is well known to chemists as ion exchange. These sodium ions will speciate with other ions in solution, thus the <b>takeup</b> of nitrogen in ammonia, with the release of the sodium. A deposit near Bear River in southern Idaho, (US) is a fresh water variety (Na < 0.05%). Southern hemisphere zeolites are typically formed in freshwater and have a high calcium content.|$|E
50|$|There are two largely used single-reel systems (also {{known as}} long-play systems) today: the tower system (vertical feed and <b>takeup)</b> and the platter system (non-rewinding; {{horizontal}} feed and <b>takeup).</b>|$|E

50|$|The <b>takeup</b> is {{the least}} {{critical}} stage of the trigger pull, and individual preferences vary widely. Two-stage triggers, for example, consist of a noticeable <b>takeup,</b> followed by a distinct increase in the force required to pull the trigger, followed by the break. A single-stage trigger, on the other hand, has no discernible movement before the break. Fully adjustable triggers will provide a two-stage pull, and the option of reducing the first stage travel to zero, essentially making the trigger a single-stage trigger.|$|E
50|$|Battening. Between the heddles and the <b>takeup</b> roll, {{the warp}} threads pass through another frame called the reed (which resembles a comb). The {{portion of the}} fabric {{that has already been}} formed but not yet rolled up on the <b>takeup</b> roll is called the fell. After the shuttle moves across the loom laying down the fill yarn, the weaver uses the reed to press (or batten) each filling yarn against the fell. Conventional shuttle looms can operate at speeds of about 150 to 160 picks per minute.|$|E

[...] When reel 2 on projector [...] "B" [...] is finished, the changeover switches the live show from projector [...] "B" [...] back to projector [...] "A," [...] and so on {{for the rest of}} the show.|$|E

50|$|In the two-reel {{system the}} {{projector}} has two reels-one is the feed reel, which holds {{the part of}} the film that has not been shown, the other is the <b>takeup</b> reel, which winds the film that has been shown. In a two-reel projector the feed reel has a slight drag to maintain tension on the film, while the <b>takeup</b> reel is constantly driven with a mechanism that has mechanical 'slip,' to allow the film to be wound under constant tension so the film is wound in a smooth manner.|$|E

5000|$|The three biggest {{problems}} with paper tape were: * Reliability. It was common practice to follow each mechanical copying of a tape with a manual hole-by-hole comparison.* Rewinding {{the tape was}} difficult and prone to problems. Great care was needed to avoid tearing the tape. Some systems used fanfold paper tape rather than rolled paper tape. In these systems, no rewinding was necessary nor were any fancy supply reel, <b>takeup</b> reel, or tension arm mechanisms required; the tape merely fed from the supply tank through the reader to the <b>takeup</b> tank, refolding itself back into exactly the same form as when it was fed into the reader.* Low information density. Datasets much larger than a few dozen kilobytes are impractical to handle in paper tape format.|$|E
50|$|The major {{components}} of the loom are the warp beam, heddles, harnesses or shafts (as few as two, four is common, sixteen not unheard of), shuttle, reed and <b>takeup</b> roll. In the loom, yarn processing includes shedding, picking, battening and taking-up operations. These are the principal motions.|$|E
50|$|An {{adjustable}} trigger {{may have}} ways to adjust {{all of these}} stages, plus trigger location. For example, a first stage or <b>takeup</b> adjustment might include weight and travel, a second stage or sear engagement adjustment might include weight and travel, and a trigger stop adjustment would limit the overtravel.|$|E
50|$|The {{show was}} very {{important}} {{when it was first}} launched, being one of the few outlets for music videos on British television, {{in the days before the}} widespread <b>takeup</b> of satellite and cable television, and channels such as MTV Europe.
