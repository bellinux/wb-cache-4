500|$|Christopher Thale {{writes in}} the Encyclopedia of Chicago that lacking {{credible}} evidence regarding the bombing, [...] "...the prosecution focused on the writings and speeches of the defendants." [...] He further notes that the conspiracy charge was legally unprecedented, the Judge was [...] "partisan," [...] and all the jurors admitted prejudice against the defendants. Historian Carl Smith writes, [...] "The visceral feelings of fear and anger surrounding the trial ruled out anything but the pretense of justice right from the outset." [...] Smith notes that scholars have long considered the trial a [...] "notorious" [...] "miscarriage of justice." [...] In a review somewhat more critical of the defendants, historian Jon Teaford concludes that [...] "he tragedy of Haymarket is the American justice system did not protect <b>the</b> <b>damn</b> fools who most needed that protection... It is <b>the</b> <b>damn</b> fools who talk too much and too wildly who are {{most in need of}} protection from the state." [...] Historian Timothy Messer-Kruse revisited the digitized trial transcript and argued that the proceedings were fair for their time, a challenge to the historical consensus that the trial was a travesty.|$|E

At the time, films of comparable length generally required between $20,000 and $30,000 to produce. Film historian Terry Ramsaye reported that Fox was not pleased with the completed film and initially declared: [...] "Let's burn <b>the</b> <b>damn</b> thing", before being convinced to allow its release.

Dylan and his band then quickly recorded [...] "Temporary Like Achilles". The session atmosphere began to [...] "get giddy" [...] around midnight when Dylan roughed out [...] "Rainy Day Women #12 & 35" [...] on the piano. Johnston recalled commenting; [...] "That sounds like <b>the</b> <b>damn</b> Salvation Army band". Dylan replied; [...] "Can you get one?"

500|$|Sinden {{considered}} {{the first period}} of the first Swedish game the team's worst since the team was put together, but the team improved and started to take command. Henderson, Clarke, Cashman and Parise scored. Sinden criticized the German referees: [...] "...they were absolutely terrible. They couldn't even skate. They were miles behind the play all night and don't know <b>the</b> <b>damn</b> rules. Their incompetence helped the game become very bitter." [...] The players were also introduced to the style of play of the Swedes, who were well used to using stick work to throw off their opponents. [...] "They were spearing, holding, interfering, and most of all, backstabbing." [...] The Canadian players would retaliate and be penalized for their retribution. As {{an example of the}} referees' incompetence, Sinden pointed out that Esposito had been penalized for cross-checking, and given a misconduct for it. Sinden, who had played international ice hockey, knew that under international rules at the time, you could not give a misconduct for cross-checking.|$|E

[...] Stephen King described the series as [...] "Nancy Drew meets Philip Marlowe, and the result is pure nitro. Why is Veronica Mars so good?

[...] "Songs For Women" [...] is a song where Ocean can't decide whether to rue or revel in his conflicted feelings about women. The song offers a self-effacing perspective, with a numbed, restrained delivery. Lyrically the track expresses a narrative where he tries to arrange an after-school meeting in his dad's empty house and brags about harmonizing to Otis, Isley and Marvin. He laments that his woman doesn't listen to him or his music: [...] "It's like she never heard of me." [...] In spite of the [...] "suave delivery and the song's inherent tunefulness", the object of Ocean's affection soon ditches his love songs in favor of those sung [...] "by real R big-shots (Drake included)".|$|E
