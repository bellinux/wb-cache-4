5|$|Although {{water is}} vital for life, the {{structure}} of this water in the cytosol is not well understood, mostly because methods such as nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy only give information on the average structure of water, and cannot measure local variations at <b>the</b> <b>microscopic</b> scale.

5|$|Psoriasis in {{the mouth}} is very rare, in {{contrast}} to lichen planus, another common papulosquamous disorder that commonly involves both the skin and mouth. When psoriasis involves the oral mucosa (the lining of the mouth), it may be asymptomatic, but it may appear as white or grey-yellow plaques.

5|$|The main {{technique}} Cage {{used for}} composition {{is that of}} nested proportions: an arbitrary sequence of numbers defines {{the structure of a}} piece on both the macroscopic and <b>the</b> <b>microscopic</b> level, so that the larger parts of each piece are in the same relation to the whole as the smaller parts are to a single unit of it. For instance, the proportion for Sonata III is 1, 1, 3¼, 3¼ (in whole notes), and a unit here is equal to 8½ bars (the end of a unit is marked with a double barline in the score, unless it coincides with the end of a section). The structure of this sonata is AABB. Section A consists of a single unit, composed according to the given proportion: correlation on <b>the</b> <b>microscopic</b> level. A is repeated, and AA forms {{the first part of the}} proportion on the macroscopic level: 1, 1. B consists of three units and an appendix of ¼ of a unit. B is also repeated, and BB gives the second half of the proportion: 3¼, 3¼. Therefore, AABB has proportions 1, 1, 3¼, 3¼: correlation on the macroscopic level. The musical phrases within each unit are also governed by the same proportion. See Example 2 for a graph of the structure of Sonata III.|$|E

Chemical analysis of the fruit bodies has revealed the presence of antibacterial and enzyme-inhibiting compounds. Formerly known as Coprinus micaceus, the species was transferred to Coprinellus in 2001 as phylogenetic analyses provided the impetus for a reorganization of the many species formerly grouped together in the genus Coprinus. Based on external appearance, C.micaceus is virtually indistinguishable from C.truncorum, {{and it has been}} suggested that many reported collections of the former may be of the latter.|$|E

Among other tools, they employ a plethora of stains that reveal neural structure, chemistry, and connectivity. In recent years, the development of immunostaining techniques has allowed investigation of neurons that express specific sets of genes. Also, functional neuroanatomy uses medical imaging techniques to correlate variations in human brain structure with differences in cognition or behavior.|$|E
5|$|The {{species was}} first {{described}} as new to science by mycologist William Alphonso Murrill in 1912. Murrill collected the type material growing near redwoods near Searsville Lake, California, in December 1911. In 1914, Murrill {{decided that the}} species {{was the same as}} Lepiota cristata (which he called Lepiota conspurcata (Willd.) Morgan); this opinion was later corroborated by Walter Sundberg in 1989 after he studied the type collection and concluded that <b>the</b> <b>microscopic</b> characteristics of both were the same. Using molecular analysis based on comparing DNA sequences of the internal transcribed spacer region, mycologist Else Vellinga determined that despite the lack of distinguishing micro-morphological characteristics, the two species were distinct.|$|E
5|$|Theoretical {{understanding}} of {{condensed matter physics}} {{is closely related to}} the notion of emergence, wherein complex assemblies of particles behave in ways dramatically different from their individual constituents. For example, a range of phenomena related to high temperature superconductivity are understood poorly, although <b>the</b> <b>microscopic</b> physics of individual electrons and lattices is well known. Similarly, models of condensed matter systems have been studied where collective excitations behave like photons and electrons, thereby describing electromagnetism as an emergent phenomenon. Emergent properties can also occur at the interface between materials: one example is the lanthanum aluminate-strontium titanate interface, where two non-magnetic insulators are joined to create conductivity, superconductivity, and ferromagnetism.|$|E

5|$|As <b>the</b> <b>microscopic</b> {{world was}} expanding, the {{macroscopic}} world was shrinking. Botanists such as John Ray worked {{to incorporate the}} flood of newly discovered organisms shipped from across the globe into a coherent taxonomy, and a coherent theology (natural theology). Debate over another flood, the Noachian, catalyzed the development of paleontology; in 1669 Nicholas Steno published an essay on how the remains of living organisms could be trapped in layers of sediment and mineralized to produce fossils. Although Steno's ideas about fossilization were well known and much debated among natural philosophers, an organic origin for all fossils would not be accepted by all naturalists {{until the end of}} the 18th century due to philosophical and theological debate about issues such as the age of the earth and extinction.|$|E
5|$|Cyathus olla has -shaped spores with {{dimensions}} of 10–146–8µm. In 1927, George Willard Martin examined <b>the</b> <b>microscopic</b> features of {{various members of}} the Nidulariaceae family, including Cyathus olla. He noted that in this species, the basidia—spore-bearing cells—are club-shaped or cylindrical and have long stems, and they sometimes have a clamp connection at the basal end of the structure. Basidia typically hold between two and four sessile spores that are directly attached to the basidium, rather than via a sterigma. Revealed only after the spore is separated, a temporary apiculus marks the point of attachment. The spores are generally separated from the basidia when the latter collapse and gelatinize; this basidial breakdown typically occurs simultaneously with a gelatinization of cells lining the inside wall of the peridiole. After separating from the basidia the outer wall of the spores may thicken, although they generally do not increase in size.|$|E
5|$|Fruit {{bodies were}} first {{collected}} in Austin, Texas, and the species was named Urnula geaster in 1893; {{later it was}} found in Kyushu in 1937, but the mushroom was not reported again in Japan until 1973. Although the new genus Chorioactis was proposed to accommodate the unique species {{a few years after}} its original discovery, it was not until 1968 that it was accepted as a valid genus. Its classification has also been a source of confusion. Historically, Chorioactis was placed in the fungus family Sarcosomataceae, despite inconsistencies in <b>the</b> <b>microscopic</b> structure of the ascus, the saclike structure in which spores are formed. Phylogenetic analyses of the past decade have clarified the fungus's classification: Chorioactis, along with three other genera, make up the family Chorioactidaceae, a grouping of related fungi formally acknowledged in 2008. In 2009, Japanese researchers reported discovering a form of the fungus missing the sexual stage of its life cycle; this asexual state was named Kumanasamuha geaster.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} to plants and animals, the early fossil {{record of the}} fungi is meager. Factors that likely contribute to the under-representation of fungal species among fossils include the nature of fungal fruiting bodies, which are soft, fleshy, and easily degradable tissues and <b>the</b> <b>microscopic</b> dimensions of most fungal structures, which therefore are not readily evident. Fungal fossils are difficult to distinguish from those of other microbes, and are most easily identified when they resemble extant fungi. Often recovered from a permineralized plant or animal host, these samples are typically studied by making thin-section preparations that can be examined with light microscopy or transmission electron microscopy. Researchers study compression fossils by dissolving the surrounding matrix with acid and then using light or scanning electron microscopy to examine surface details.|$|E
5|$|LACM 149371 (Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County {{specimen}} 149371) is {{an enigmatic}} fossil mammalian tooth from the Paleogene (66 to 23 million years ago, mya) of Peru.

5|$|Malaria {{is usually}} {{confirmed}} by <b>the</b> <b>microscopic</b> examination of blood films or by antigen-based rapid diagnostic tests (RDT). In some areas, RDTs {{need to be}} able to distinguish whether the malaria symptoms are caused by Plasmodium falciparum or by other species of parasites since treatment strategies could differ for non-P. falciparum infections. Microscopy is the most commonly used method to detect the malarial parasite—about 165 million blood films were examined for malaria in 2010. Despite its widespread usage, diagnosis by microscopy suffers from two main drawbacks: many settings (especially rural) are not equipped to perform the test, and the accuracy of the results depends on both the skill of the person examining the blood film and the levels of the parasite in the blood. The sensitivity of blood films ranges from 75–90% in optimum conditions, to as low as 50%. Commercially available RDTs are often more accurate than blood films at predicting the presence of malaria parasites, but they are widely variable in diagnostic sensitivity and specificity depending on manufacturer, and are unable to tell how many parasites are present.|$|E
