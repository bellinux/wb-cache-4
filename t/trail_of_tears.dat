The U.S. annexed the Republic of Texas in 1845 during a period of expansionist Manifest destiny. The 1846 Oregon Treaty with Britain led to U.S. control of the present-day American Northwest.

Nancy was part Cherokee, and Nancy's mother walked on the <b>Trails</b> <b>of</b> <b>Tears.</b> They were the parents of Rachel Caroline, James Calvin, Martha Pauline, and John Merrit Eaton. Nancy died on September 21, 1896 and George is still living in a retirement home in Inola, Rogers County. James Calvin is a farmer near Oolagah, Oklahoma. Martha Pauline married James Morning York, who was elected Assessor of Rogers County in 1918.Rachel Eaton attended tribal schools and Cherokee Female Seminary in Tahlequah, Oklahoma. She graduated Seminary in 1887, but during her senior year the building burned down. For college, Rachel attended Drury College in Springfield, Missouri, then went on to the University of Chicago, where she got her Ph.D. Her dissertation, John Ross and The Cherokee Indians was published in 1921, as a Cherokee history book. Rachel taught in public schools of Cherokee nation, Cherokee Female Seminary (the new building built after the fire), Lake Erie College in Painsville, Ohio, and the Industrial Institute and College of Columbus, Mississippi.

5000|$|Misery doesn't {{mean to be}} {{a walking}} {{disaster}} area. Her mishaps are usually a combination of clumsiness and extraordinary bad luck. Evidently, these traits run in her family, as Misery has had relatives who have been present at every single major disaster in recorded history. Fortunately, her friends are all kindhearted enough to take this in their stride. Misery spends {{most of the time}} in a state of detached apathy and with ever-present <b>trails</b> <b>of</b> <b>tears</b> running from her eyes. She does have tiny moments of happiness throughout the series, but unless they're few and far between, her bad luck rears its ugly head and strikes her down with a vengeance, usually in the form of lightning bolts. She sometimes also states to be happy, although she is in her usual melancholic mood. Friday the 13th is the only time her inherent bad luck gives her a break; nothing but good things happen to her while everyone around her gets a day-long dose of Misery's bad luck, but she seems to hate the good luck as it is a day that's completely different from what's she's used to. Sugar is also something that Misery needs to stay away from, because whenever she has any sweets, she goes into a hyperactive frenzy, running around spouting everything that has ever gone wrong {{in the history of the}} world, from major catastrophes like an earthquake in China to small non-events like stubbing her toe in the kitchen. She keeps dust bunnies as pets, though she is allergic to them and blows them away with her sneezing. They appear to like her, as they return to her every time. Misery has actually been revealed to be an incredibly gifted singer. However, this talent only shines through whenever she's asleep. Otherwise, her singing just comes out as banshee screams, being a banshee herself. This made Frank and Len recruit her as lead singer for their band, R.I.P., during a major concert event, Gloomapalooza. Their performance was a huge success. She is usually very wise, but makes mistakes when panicked, as seen in [...] "Out of The World", when she said push instead of pull. Her family is surprisingly large, considering how often they find themselves in or responsible for disasters, and when the entire family meets, the destruction can be impressive. For example, in the episode [...] "Misery Loves Company", Misery's cousins Malady and Malaise come to visit. When both of them are in the same place at once, destruction occurs. Ruby manages to arrange it so one cousin could be with Misery at a time, while the other cousin is doing something else. Also, in the episode [...] "I'll Be Home For Misery", when Misery's family comes to call, only her female relatives come (with the exception of [...] "Cousin Murky", Skull Boy's persona during the episode). It is stated in the episode [...] "Disaster Becomes You" [...] that all the males in Misery's family but one, who is suggested to be her father, died in quicksand. Misery is voiced by Emily Hampshire, explaining the Canadian accent.|$|R

The {{number of people who}} {{died as a result of}} the <b>Trail</b> <b>of</b> <b>Tears</b> has been variously estimated. American doctor and missionary Elizur Butler, who made the journey with one party, estimated 4,000 deaths.
