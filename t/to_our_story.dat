[...] "I don't {{have much to}} compare it to, but the challenges were daunting," [...] said Schaefer, who directed several sequences outside The Dakota, the site of Lennon's assassination. [...] "I {{had to go into}} a place that was very sensitive <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>story,</b> with trucks, a crew, and a limited amount of time. It wasn't easy." ...|$|E

60|$|We {{may have}} {{occasion}} to advert to the Bayeux tapestry again, {{when we come}} to narrate the exploits which it was the particular object of this historical embroidery to illustrate and adorn. In the mean time, we return <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>story.</b>|$|E

6000|$|... "Nothing for the present," [...] was {{the brief}} reply. [...] "If we were <b>to</b> tell <b>our</b> <b>story,</b> we {{should only be}} laughed at. What {{there is to be}} done falls to my lot." ...|$|R
6000|$|But {{to return}} again <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>story.</b> After supper, the lads desired a bed, for {{that they were}} weary with travelling. Then Gaius called to show them their chamber; but said Mercy, [...] "I will have them to bed." [...] So she had them to bed, and they slept well; but the rest sat up all night, for Gaius and they were such {{suitable}} company, {{that they could not}} tell how to part.|$|E
60|$|You must, therefore, {{observe that}} I deeply degrade the {{position}} which such a myth as that just referred to occupied in the Greek mind, by comparing it (for fear of offending you) <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>story</b> of St. George and the Dragon. Still, the analogy is perfect in minor respects; {{and though it}} fails to give you any notion of the Greek faith, it will exactly illustrate {{the manner in which}} faith laid hold of its objects.|$|E
60|$|So their preacher {{went and}} did his errand, and {{received}} this answer {{from the mouth}} of his Lord: that Captain Credence should be the great doer in all the King's army, against the King's enemies, and also for the welfare of Mansoul. So he bowed to the ground, and thanked his Lordship, and returned and told his news to the townsfolk. But all this was done with all imaginable secrecy, because the foes had yet great strength in the town. But to return <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>story</b> again.|$|E
60|$|And here I {{was about}} to begin again, when Jack {{informed}} us softly, that during the progress of our last narrative, Mr. Weller's Watch had adjourned its sittings from the kitchen, and regularly met outside our door, where he had no doubt that august body would be found at the present moment. As this was for the convenience of listening <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>stories,</b> he submitted that they might be suffered to come in, and hear them more pleasantly.|$|R

60|$|But {{to return}} <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>story.</b> At {{one end of}} this village the creek sprang over a ledge of rock in a low cascade and opened out into a {{beautiful}} lake, the bosom of which was studded with small islands. Here were thousands of those smaller species of wild water-fowl which were either too brave or too foolish to be scared away by {{the noise of the}} camp. And here, too, dozens of children were sporting on the beach or paddling about in their light bark canoes.|$|E
60|$|They {{sat for a}} {{space in}} a public-house, the one {{answering}} the questions of the other about this person and that, reviving queer old points of view, brushing aside endless new aspects and new perspectives, {{and then it was}} time to go to the station and take the London train. Their names and the personal things they had to talk of do not matter <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>story,</b> but only the changes and all the strangeness that this poor returning soul found in the once familiar world.|$|E
60|$|But {{to return}} <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>story.</b> Having consented, as above, to his proposal, {{we had not}} much more to do. He gave me my writings, and the bond for my {{maintenance}} during his life, and for five hundred pounds after his death. And so far was he from abating his affection to me afterwards, that two years after we were thus, as he called it, married, he made his will, {{and gave me a}} thousand pounds more, and all my household stuff, plate, &c., which was considerable too.|$|E
60|$|It is needless, dear reader, <b>to</b> prolong <b>our</b> <b>story.</b> Perchance we have taxed your {{patience}} {{too much}} already--but we cannot close {{without a word}} or two regarding the subsequent life of those whose fortunes we have followed so long.|$|R
5000|$|About mid-morning, {{the press}} corps heads into its first {{briefing}} in the press secretary's office.

40|$|In the EFL classroom, {{storytelling}} provides comprehensible input {{that can}} have beneficial effects on reading skills, and vocabulary knowledge.

60|$|To return <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>story.</b> In {{much shorter}} time {{than we have}} spent in {{reminding}} the reader of these historical particulars, Joliffe had made his mystic communication; and being duly answered as {{by one of the}} initiated, he undid the door, and there entered our old friend Roger Wildrake, round-head in dress, as his safety and dependence on Colonel Everard compelled him to be, but that dress worn in a most cavalier-like manner, and forming a stronger contrast than usual with the demeanour and language of the wearer, to which it was never very congenial.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes: {{two girls}} and two boys; and only think, he calls one William Nassau, and one George Denmark--isn't it odd?" [...] And from the parson, Mrs. Catherine {{went on to}} speak of several humble personages of the village community, who, as they are not {{necessary}} <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>story,</b> need not be described at full length. It was when, from the window, Corporal Brock saw the altercation between the worthy divine and his son, respecting the latter's ride, that he judged it a fitting time to step out on the green, and to bestow on the two horses those famous historical names which we have just heard applied to them.|$|E
60|$|The Devil acceded to his request, bowed, and withdrew. Alighting {{gracefully}} in Montgomery Street, {{he dropped}} into Meade & Co.'s clothing store, where, having completely equipped himself a la mode, he sallied forth intent {{on his personal}} enjoyment. Determining to sink his professional character, he mingled with the current of human life, and enjoyed, with that immense capacity for excitement peculiar to his nature, the whirl, bustle, and feverishness of the people, as a purely aesthetic gratification unalloyed by the cares of business. What he did that evening does not belong <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>story.</b> We return to the broker, whom we left on the roof.|$|E
40|$|Transmedia {{storytelling}} and transmedia activism both afford and demand new approaches <b>to</b> telling <b>our</b> <b>stories.</b> Contemporary transmedia utilises multiple tools to engage audiences by creating stories that offer unique approaches to narrative, character, setting and innovative {{ways of looking}} at social issues. Here are 5 of the best recent examples...|$|R
5000|$|Anchalee {{has created}} a website, ilooklikeanengineer.com, which she {{describes}} as [...] "...a safe platform for us all to continue <b>to</b> share <b>our</b> <b>stories</b> and experiences relating to diversity issues in tech."

5000|$|He {{has also}} worked on Dust Echoes, an Indigenous {{animated}} website of Dreamtime stories {{produced by the}} ABC. Dust Echoes is important he says, [...] "to preserve our culture by using the whitefella technology <b>to</b> embrace <b>our</b> <b>stories.</b> You see the 'propaganda' is bigger than <b>our</b> <b>stories</b> in the dust and so we now are raising those stories from the dust and share it, so people can more understand our culture and bring them <b>to</b> <b>our</b> fireplace." [...] He played {{one of the leading}} roles in the psychological thriller Red Hill.|$|R
60|$|Now when I {{look back}} on that walk I blame myself for having gone on my way without {{trying to find out}} {{something}} of the history of that forsaken home to which the lonely old road had led me. Those ruinous buildings once inhabited, so wrapped round and hidden away by trees, have now a strange look in memory as if they had a story to tell, as if something intelligent had looked from the vacant windows as I stood staring at them and had said, We have waited these many years for you to come and listen <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>story</b> and you are come at last.|$|E
60|$|In {{the course}} of these inquiries, two {{circumstances}} happened material <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>story.</b> Butler, after a close investigation of his conduct, was declared innocent of accession {{to the death of}} Porteous; but, as having been present during the whole transaction, was obliged to find bail not to quit his usual residence at Liberton, that he might appear as a witness when called upon. The other incident regarded the disappearance of Madge Wildfire and her mother from Edinburgh. When they were sought, with the purpose of subjecting them to some farther interrogatories, it was discovered by Mr. Sharpitlaw that they had eluded the observation of the police, and left the city so soon as dismissed from the council-chamber. No efforts could trace the place of their retreat.|$|E
60|$|But {{to return}} <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>story.</b> We {{came back to}} the king timely enough to put the Earl of Essex's men out of all humour of {{renewing}} the fight, and as I observed before, both parties stood gazing at one another, and our cannon playing upon them obliged Sir William Balfour's horse to wheel off in some disorder, but they returned us none again, which, as we afterwards understood, was, as I said before, for want of both powder and gunners, for the cannoniers and firemen were killed, or had quitted their train in the fight, when our horse had possession of their artillery; and as they had spiked up some of the cannon, so they had carried away fifteen carriages of powder.|$|E
6000|$|... "Come, come," [...] he said aloud; [...] "no grumbling. I {{admit that}} it is your turn <b>to</b> hear <b>our</b> <b>story</b> now; and I will {{do my best to}} gratify you.

5000|$|Shonda Rhimes {{stated that}} the fourth season will {{focus more on the}} core {{characters}}, as opposed to the third season where more characters were introduced. Rhimes explained why: [...] "Kerry Washington couldn't work 14 hours a day, so we had <b>to</b> tell <b>our</b> <b>story</b> in a different way, and that necessitated other people both picking up the slack in beautiful ways".|$|R
6000|$|But {{to return}} again <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>story.</b> After supper the lads desired a bed; for {{that they were}} weary with travelling: then Gaius called to show them their chamber; but said Mercy, I will have them to bed. So she had them to bed, and they slept well; but the rest sat up all night; for Gaius and they were such {{suitable}} company, {{that they could not}} tell how to part. Then after much talk of their Lord, themselves, and their journey, old Mr. Honest, he that put forth the riddle to Gaius, began to nod. Then said Great-heart, What, Sir, you begin to be drowsy; come, rub up; now here is a riddle for you. Then said Mr. Honest, Let us hear it. Then said Mr. Great-heart, ...|$|E
60|$|All that is mysterious has now, I believe, been unravelled, {{and we may}} go back <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>story.</b> Of Mr. Pritchett, {{we should}} perhaps say a word. He had been habituated in his sundry money {{dealings}} to look on Miss Baker as his patron's niece, and had always called her as such. Indeed, the connection had been so far back that he usually styled her Miss Mary. But he did not know, nor--though he was very suspicious on the matter--did he quite suspect what was the truth as to Miss Waddington. She was niece to his patron's niece; he knew no more than that, excepting, of course, {{that she was the}} daughter of Mr. Waddington, and that she was mistress in her own right of four thousand pounds.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{answered}} Grandfather, [...] "it often happens, {{that the}} outcasts of one generation are those, who are reverenced as the wisest {{and best of}} men by the next. The securest fame is that which comes after a man’s death. But let us return <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>story.</b> When Roger Williams was banished, {{he appears to have}} given the chair to Mrs. Anne Hutchinson. At all events it was in her possession in 1637. She was a very sharp-witted and well-instructed lady, and was so conscious of her own wisdom and abilities, that she thought it a pity that the world should not have the benefit of them. She therefore used to hold lectures in Boston, once or twice a week, at which most of the women attended. Mrs. Hutchinson presided at these meetings, sitting, with great state and dignity, in Grandfather’s chair." ...|$|E
60|$|But {{his voice}} was as welcome to poor Fred as {{daylight}} in a dungeon. All the smothered remorse and despair of his heart burst forth in bitter confessions, as, with many tears, he poured forth his story to the friendly man. It needs not <b>to</b> prolong <b>our</b> <b>story,</b> for now the day has dawned and the hour of release is come.|$|R
5000|$|Raymond: Well, we're about <b>to</b> begin <b>our</b> <b>story.</b> Oh, I {{forgot to}} warn you about the Trembliens. They're those pesky, {{invisible}} cousins of the gremlins. They uh, [...] you, give quick little shoves, and give the false impression that you're trembling. If you're being troubled by a Tremblien, just grab him by his invisible little horns and stick him into the nearest pin cushion.|$|R
60|$|The younger Dusante lady, who, {{having been}} {{divested}} of her wraps, her veil, and the woolen shawl {{that had been}} tied over her head, had {{proved to be a}} very pretty girl with black eyes, here declared that it had been her intention at the first opportunity to get us <b>to</b> tell <b>our</b> <b>story,</b> but as we had asked first, she supposed we ought to be satisfied first.|$|R
