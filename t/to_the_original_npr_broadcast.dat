50|$|The College {{radio station}} {{went on the}} air in 1986 as a {{satellite}} of <b>the</b> area's <b>original</b> <b>NPR</b> station, KLRE-FM 90.5, on the air since 1973 and owned by the Little Rock School District. At the time, KLRE only broadcast at 40,000 watts, and the addition of KUAR brought NPR programming to large portions of central Arkansas that hadn't received it before. In 1988, all NPR news and talk programming moved <b>to</b> KUAR during <b>the</b> day, while KLRE began running exclusively classical music.|$|R
50|$|Similarly, a cutaway {{scene is}} the {{interruption}} {{of a scene}} with the insertion of another scene, generally unrelated or only peripherally related <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>original</b> scene. <b>The</b> interruption is usually quick, and is usually, although not always, ended by a return <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>original</b> scene. <b>The</b> effect is of commentary <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>original</b> scene, frequently comic in nature.|$|R
40|$|Two-dimensional phase field {{simulations}} of polarization switching-induced toughening of an electrically permeable crack parallel <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>original</b> polarization direction in a ferroelectric mono-domain were conducted {{based on the}} time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equation. The mono-domain represented a small vicinity region of the crick tip and the crack was loaded by nominal applied mechanical and/or electrical tip fields. The simulation results show that a wing-shaped switched zone is formed forwards from the crack tip under applied loading, which {{is different from the}} backward wing-shaped switched zone for a permeable crack perpendicular <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>original</b> polarization direction. <b>The</b> mechanical load <b>to</b> induce a same size of switched zone for a crack parallel <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>original</b> polarization is much lower than that for a crack perpendicular <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>original</b> polarization direction. Consequently, the polarization switching-induced toughening for a crack parallel <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>original</b> polarization, which was characterized by the local J-integral, behaves differently from that of a permeable crack perpendicular <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>original</b> polarization direction.

50|$|Two {{types of}} L-forms are distinguished: {{unstable}} L-forms, spheroplasts that {{are capable of}} dividing, but can revert <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>original</b> morphology, and stable L-forms, L-forms that are unable <b>to</b> revert <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>original</b> bacteria.|$|R

5000|$|In PC games, {{the term}} [...] "vanilla" [...] {{is often used}} <b>to</b> {{describe}} <b>the</b> <b>original</b> version of a game, {{which has not been}} modified with third-party addons, developer updates, downloadable content (DLC) or patches. It can also refer <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>original</b> game engine when source ports or expansion packs are available. For example, World of Warcraft could refer <b>to</b> either <b>the</b> <b>original</b> game or one of the expansion packs, so users may refer <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>original</b> as [...] "vanilla" [...] to distinguish it from the subsequent versions.|$|R
