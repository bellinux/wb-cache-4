40|$|In this {{contribution}} the Digital Image Correlation (DIC) {{technique is}} used to identify strain fields within a pearlitic microstructure from in-situ obtained SEM images. Typically this is done using a synthetic speckle but in this study the intensity field variations, related to the microstructure of pearlite, are used as a natural speckle. As a means to avoid subsets with inadequate information content (in terms of intensity field variations) a <b>tracebility</b> criterion is introduced. This criterion {{is based on the}} eigenvalues of the Hessian of the autocorrelation function. A pertaining algorithm, which can be used to identify high quality subsets (in terms of <b>tracebility)</b> within a certain Region Of Interest (ROI), is also presented. By using the obtained irregular subsets grids together with synthetically deformed images the displacement and deformation gradient errors (both local and average) are studied {{as a function of the}} applied loading for various subset sizes...|$|E
40|$|Abstract − International Schools of Ion Chromatography are well-accepted annual {{meetings}} among users of ion chromatography in Slovenia and Croatia. Special attention is also given to some features of metrology e. g. <b>tracebility</b> and uncertainty. Within schools, proficiency tests are organized, {{with the aim}} of checking the performance of participating laboratories as well as of testing different analytical approaches suitable for certain types of samples. The procedure for preparation of a laboratory reference solution (Cl- and Br-) using primary techniques with direct traceability to SI units is also show...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We propose an {{approach}} to artifact management in software engineering that uses an artifact matrix to structure the artifact space of a project along stakeholder viewpoints and realization levels. This matrix structure provides a basis on top of which relationships between artifacts can be defined, such as consistency constraints, <b>tracebility</b> links and model transformations. The management of all project artifacts and their relationships supports collaboration across different roles in the development process as well as change management and agile practices. Our approach is highly configurable to facilitate adaptation to different development methods and processes. It provides a basis to develop and/or to integrate generic tools that can flexibly support such different methods. In particular, it can be leveraged to improve the transition from requirements analysis to architecture design. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} {{possibilities}} to navigate in CASE tools. Earlier {{studies show that}} there are a discrepancy between the ISD-metohods and the corresponding tools. One reason for investigating possibilites for navigation is the need of <b>tracebility</b> when designing information systems (IS). My hypothesis is that identifying of modelling acts will give a better support for navigating in CASE tools. This study present a Navigation model in order to identify modelling acts and existing relations between objects in ISD-methods. The model is tested through a smaller study where I compare three ISD-methods and three corresponding tools. The main conclusions from this study are some findings that may explain the dicrepancies identified in earlier studies. Keywords: CASE-tools, Navigation, Informations Systems Development 1 Introduction For the development of computer-based information systems (IS) there exist different kinds of tools. There are tools supporting different phases in [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Nowadays the {{consumer}} market demands a gradually {{increase in the}} products' quality control. The manual control that exits, used in animal production, shows ineficiency in warrating an increasing percentual of the desirable quality, so this can only be reached when an effective animal <b>tracebility</b> system is applied, from birth to slaughter. Individual electronic identification presents high importance in this focus, providing information recorded directly from the animal. Electronic traceability uses electronic devices that emit a signal activated by a fixed reader placed where it is needed to record a certain event, or uses a manual reader which allows a higher independence of the operator. Knowing {{the importance of the}} electronic identification as a tool for applying traceability in animal production, this research had as objective to evaluate the use of transponders in order to garantee the manual reading as well as the fixed antenna reading. The following implant places were analized in piglet, just after their birth: 1) forehead, 2) external ear lobule, 3) the posterior auricular base, and 4) a transponder inserted in a earing implanted in the ear lobule. The factors of skin damage and migration were analized, as well as the reading efficiency. It was found that the best implant place was the posterior ear base...|$|E
40|$|To {{enable all}} {{actors in the}} meat supply chain to monitor, manage and {{optimise}} their production process, Internet of Things applications create multiple opportunities. In the IoF 2020 project (Internet of Food and Farm 2020), starting early 2017, 11 partners from five countries focus on large-scale implementations of IoT via three use cases in the meat supply chain: pig farm management, poultry chain monitoring and meat transparency and traceability. Farmer’s lack of accessibility to information to monitor their production on a continuous basis will be addressed by installing and integrating IoT sensors for environmental and animal monitoring. In addition, early warning systems will be developed, linking different data-streams to provide valuable feedback to the farmer, {{as well as information}} transfer to other stakeholders. Doing so, preventive or corrective actions for diseases, boar taint, bird mortality, feed waste, environment, etc. can be taken. Further, also EPCIS-based <b>tracebility</b> from farm to fork will be enabled, so that consumers receive reliable information on meat origin and quality. The current progress of these three use cases, as well as the planned developments will be presented. By addressing several technological and business challenges, as well as EU-wide dissemination, IoF 2020 aims to contribute to the digital revolution in Smart Farming...|$|E

O mercado consumidor, atualmente, exige aumento gradativo do controle da qualidade dos produtos. Os métodos manuais de controle existentes, aplicáveis à produção animal, começam a se mostrar ineficientes para garantir percentual crescente dessa qualidade, pois essa garantia somente pode ser efetiva se houver rastreamento confiável do animal, desde o seu nascimento até o abate. A identificação individual apresenta grande importância nesse enfoque, pois possibilita a coleta de informações inerentes ao animal. A rastreabilidade eletrônica utiliza dispositivo eletrônico, que emite um sinal ativado por um leitor fixo, colocado onde for necessário registrar um determinado evento, ou um leitor manual que permite maior independência do operador. Sabendo-se da importância da identificação eletrônica como ferramenta para a rastreabilidade dos animais produzidos comercialmente, teve-se o objetivo de estudar o uso do identificador eletrônico (transponder), de forma a garantir tanto a leitura manual do indivíduo, como a leitura com antena fixa. Foram implantados nos seguintes locais: 1) fronte; 2) lóbulo externo; 3) parte posterior da base auricular, e 4) dentro de um brinco e implantado no lóbulo externo da orelha. Foram analisados os fatores seqüela e migração, posterior ao implante, assim como a eficiência de leitura na antena tanto fixa como manual. O melhor local de implante foi a parte posterior da base auricular...|$|E
