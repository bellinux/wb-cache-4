5|$|At {{a meeting}} with church and cathedral officials, held on 11 June, reporters noted that three people had been shot within {{the city in the}} {{previous}} 72 hours. The attendees produced a letter by the Very Reverend Rogers Govender, on behalf of the Dean and Canons of Manchester Cathedral to Sony. It stated that they were currently seeking the advice of lawyers in the matter, and reserved their legal position in relation to the same. It demanded a substantial donation for the cathedral's work with youth in resisting the culture of gun crime and other forms of violence in our society. It further demanded the immediate withdrawal of the game, and that Sony not re-issue it without removing the section of the game containing the Cathedral interior. Govender described the use of images of the cathedral as virtual desecration. The letter stressed that they were in consultation with their lawyers and urged Sony to contact them so there can be a mutually satisfactory conclusion to the matter. Govender told reporters that the church officials had only been told of the content on 8 June 2007, and, after watching footage of gameplay posted on YouTube, said they were dismayed beyond belief and were shocked to see a place of worship being presented to youths as a place where guns may be fired, and <b>that</b> <b>every</b> <b>year,</b> they invite hundreds of teenagers to see the Cathedral and appreciate it as an alternative to violence. They added that it was a shame to have a game like this undermining such important work. They also sought that Sony apologise unreservedly.|$|E

For activities the NSC held strength tests and health advice; The Children's Centre loaned out their interactive babies and some parenting information and Will Sutton attended as the 'Positive' male role model for the day. The Student Council baked and sold cakes, and Sami-Jaine Martin (Student President) was running a Sexual Health Stand. The engineering group was selling moustaches and raising money for men's cancer charities, while construction group (with help from the art department) made an 8ft seaside cut out for photographs on the day. The beauty therapy department offered their time to pamper the boys with Indian head massages and face mapping, and there were also 3 students who volunteered to have their chest waxed to raise money for charity.|$|E
25|$|As one {{contemporary}} points out, {{there were}} economic benefits with the internment of Japanese Canadians. Specifically, white fishermen directly benefited {{due to the}} impounding of all Japanese-Canadian owned fishing boats. Fishing for salmon was a hotly contested issue between the white Canadians and Japanese Canadians. In 1919, Japanese Canadians received four thousand and six hundred of the salmon-gill net licences, representing roughly half {{of all of the}} licences the government had to distribute. In a very public move on behalf of the Department of Fisheries in British Columbia, it was recommended that in the future Japanese Canadians should never again receive more fishing licences than they had in 1919 and also <b>that</b> <b>every</b> <b>year</b> thereafter that number be reduced. These were measures taken on behalf of the provincial government to oust the Japanese from salmon fishing. The federal government also got involved in 1926, when the House of Commons’ Standing Committee on Fisheries put forward suggestions that the number of fishing licences issued to Japanese Canadians be reduced by ten percent a year, until they were entirely removed from the industry by 1937. The fact that any Japanese Canadians were still fishing in British Columbia at the outset of World War II is amazing due to the pressure they faced from the province, country, and other fishermen. Yet the reason the government gave for impounding the few remaining and operating Japanese-Canadian fishing boats was that the government feared these boats would be used by Japan to mount a horrific coastal attack on British Columbia.|$|E
500|$|This {{long period}} of wall-building {{burdened}} the populace and provoked controversy. Sometime between 1190 and 1196, during Zhangzong's reign, the high official Zhang Wangong (張萬公) and the Censorate recommended that work on the wall be indefinitely suspended due to a recent drought, noting: [...] "What has been begun is already being flattened by sandstorms, and bullying the people into defence works will simply exhaust them." [...] However, Chancellor Wanyan Xiang (完顏襄) convinced the emperor of the walls' merits based on an optimistic cost estimate – [...] "Although the initial outlay for the walls will be one million strings of cash, when the work is done the frontier will be secure with only half the present number of soldiers needed to defend it, which means <b>that</b> <b>every</b> <b>year</b> you will save three million strings of cash... The benefits will be everlasting" [...] – and so construction continued unabated. All this work created an extensive systems of walls, which consisted of a [...] "outer wall" [...] from Heilongjiang to Mongolia and a [...] network of [...] "inner walls" [...] north and northeast of Beijing. Together, they formed a roughly elliptical web of fortifications [...] in length and [...] in diameter. Some of these walls had inner moats (from [...] in width), beacon towers, battlements, parapets, and outward-facing semicircular platforms protruding from the wall—features that set the Jin walls apart from their predecessors.|$|E

500|$|... "Grift of the Magi" [...] {{was written}} by Tom Martin and {{directed}} by Matthew Nastuk {{as part of the}} eleventh season of The Simpsons (1999–2000). It was the first episode that Martin wrote on his own, having previously co-written the season ten episode [...] "Sunday, Cruddy Sunday" [...] with George Meyer, Brian Scully, and The Simpsons showrunner Mike Scully. Martin got the inspiration for [...] "Grift of the Magi" [...] after reading a magazine article about how major companies were receiving permission to advertise their products in school students' textbooks. He thought it [...] "seemed like a gigantic conflict that could lead to big problems", and therefore believed an episode based on {{it would be a good}} idea. According to DVD Talk reviewer Adam Tyner, the episode is a satire of the commercialization of Christmas. A writer for Newsday has commented that episode skewers [...] "the annual craze for that one 'hot' toy." [...] This has also been pointed out by Mike Scully, who said in 2008 that [...] "Grift of the Magi" [...] was produced around the time when [...] "every year there seemed to be a hot toy. Like the Furbies, or whatever – some toy that kids just had to have that year." [...] In response to Scully's comment, Martin added <b>that</b> <b>every</b> <b>year</b> [...] "the media would create this gigantic rush at the toy store for various things.

2500|$|Ore mills {{generate}} {{large amounts}} of waste, called tailings. For example, 99 tons of waste are generated per ton of copper, with even higher ratios in gold mining - because only 5.3 g of gold is extracted per ton of ore, a ton of gold produces 200,000 tons of tailings. (As time goes on and richer deposits are exhausted - and technology improves to permit - this number is going down to [...]5 g and less.) These tailings can be toxic. Tailings, which are usually produced as a slurry, are most commonly dumped into ponds made from naturally existing valleys. These ponds are secured by impoundments (dams or embankment dams). In 2000 {{it was estimated that}} 3,500 tailings impoundments existed, and <b>that</b> <b>every</b> <b>year,</b> 2 to 5 major failures and 35 minor failures occurred; for example, in the Marcopper mining disaster at least 2 million tons of tailings were released into a local river. Subaqueous tailings disposal is another option. The mining industry has argued that submarine tailings disposal (STD), which disposes of tailings in the sea, is ideal because it avoids the risks of tailings ponds; although the practice is illegal in the United States and Canada, it is used in the developing world.|$|E
2500|$|The trade route {{taken by}} ships from Rome to [...] Tamilakam has been {{described}} in detail by the writers, such as Strabo and Pliny the Elder. Roman and Arab sailors {{were aware of the}} existence of the monsoon winds that blew across the Indian Ocean on a [...] seasonal basis. A Roman captain named Hippalus [...] first sailed [...] a direct route from Rome to India, using the monsoon winds. His method was later improved upon by merchants who shortened the voyage by sailing due east from the port of Cana or Cape Guardafui, finding that by this way it was possible to go directly from Rome to Tamilakam. Strabo writes <b>that</b> <b>every</b> <b>year,</b> about the time of the summer solstice, a fleet of one hundred and twenty vessels sailed from Myos Hormos, a port of Egypt on the Red Sea, and headed toward India. With [...] assistance from the monsoons, the voyage [...] took [...] forty days to reach the ports of Tamilakam or Ceylon. Pliny writes that if the monsoons were blowing regularly, it was a forty-day trip to [...] Muziris from Ocelis located {{at the entrance to the}} Red Sea from the south. He [...] writes that the passengers preferred to embark at Bacare (Vaikkarai) in Pandya country, rather than Muziris, which was infested with pirates. The ships returned from Tamilakam carrying [...] rich cargo which was transported in camel trains from the Red Sea to the Nile, then up the river to Alexandria, finally reaching the capital of the Roman empire.|$|E
