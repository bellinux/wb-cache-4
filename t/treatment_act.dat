25|$|On June 12, 2008, Kennedy {{wrote the}} 5–4 {{majority}} opinion in Boumediene v. Bush. The case challenged {{the legality of}} Lakhdar Boumediene’s detention at the Guantanamo Bay military base {{as well as the}} constitutionality of the Military Commissions Act (MCA) of 2006. Kennedy was joined by the four more liberal judges in finding that the constitutionally guaranteed right of habeas corpus applies to persons held in Guantanamo Bay and to persons designated as enemy combatants on that territory. They also found that the Detainee <b>Treatment</b> <b>Act</b> of 2005 failed to provide an adequate substitute for habeas corpus and that the MCA was an unconstitutional suspension of that right.|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} opinion, {{written by}} Justice Anthony Kennedy, {{found that the}} constitutionally guaranteed right of habeas corpus review applies to persons held in Guantanamo and to persons designated as enemy combatants on that territory. If Congress intends to suspend the right, the Court said that an adequate substitute must offer the prisoner a meaningful opportunity to demonstrate he is held pursuant to an erroneous application or interpretation of relevant law, and the reviewing decision-making must have some ability to correct errors, to assess the sufficiency of the government's evidence, and to consider relevant exculpating evidence. The court found that the petitioners had met their burden of establishing that Detainee <b>Treatment</b> <b>Act</b> of 2005 failed to provide an adequate substitute for habeas corpus.|$|E
25|$|To {{respond to}} the Court's ruling, the Bush {{administration}} established the Combatant Status Review Tribunals to review whether detainees were properly classified as enemy combatants and began reviews in 2004. It was not until they had determined if a detainee was an enemy combatant that they could proceed to trials by military commissions. In Hamdan v. Rumsfeld (2006), the Court ruled that the system of military commissions as established by DOD was illegal {{and needed to be}} replaced by a system authorized by Congress. Through the Detainee <b>Treatment</b> <b>Act</b> of 2005 and the Military Commissions Act of 2006, in accordance with Bush administration goals, the United States Congress moved to limit, and then curtail the detainees' ability to file habeas corpus appeals. The Supreme Court ruled on the outstanding habeas corpus appeals in Al Odah v. United States and Boumediene v. Bush (2008), discussed below.|$|E

25|$|The United States Federal Child Abuse Prevention and <b>Treatment</b> <b>Act</b> (CAPTA), {{as amended}} by The Keeping Children and Families Safe Act of 2003, defines {{child abuse and neglect}} as, at minimum: any recent act or failure to act {{on the part of a}} parent or caretaker, which results in death, serious {{physical}} or emotional harm, sexual abuse or exploitation; or an act or failure to act which presents an imminent risk of serious harm. A child is defined as a person under the age of eighteen. Within the parameters of CAPTA, each state is responsible for individually defining child abuse, neglect, and dependence and outline the care expected of parents and caregivers. In abuse cases, the most abused children are male aged from several months to 10 to 11 years old. The typical abusers are parents, live-in friends, guardians, or baby sitters, and only rarely by a sibling or other child.|$|E
25|$|Chief Justice Roberts' dissent {{focused on}} whether the process afforded the Guantanamo detainees in the Detainee <b>Treatment</b> <b>Act</b> were an {{adequate}} substitute for the Habeas protections the Constitution guaranteed. By arguing in the affirmative, he implied {{that the issue of}} whether the detainees had any Suspension Clause rights was moot (since, if they did, he found that those rights were not violated anyway). This line of reasoning was arguably more in line with the plain reading of Johnson v. Eisentrager (1950) (which denied German prisoners of war habeas rights primarily due to both practical logistical concerns and the determination that they had been afforded an adequate substitute: traditional military war crimes trials, which complied with the Geneva Conventions) than that of Justice Scalia, and also avoided the more controversial and complicated issue of whether the detainees were entitled to file habeas petitions in the first place.|$|E
25|$|Pursuant to Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure and Local Rule 27(f), respondent-appellee Commander S.L. Wright respectfully moves this Court to remand {{this case}} to the {{district}} court with instructions to dismiss it for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Respondent-appellee has conferred with counsel for petitioner-appellant, and they agree with the briefing schedule proposed below. As explained below, the Military Commissions Act of 2006 (MCA), Pub. L. No. 109-366 (see Attachment1), which took effect on October 17, 2006, removes federal court jurisdiction over pending and future habeas corpus actions and any other actions filed by or on behalf of detained aliens determined by the United States to be enemy combatants, such as petitioner-appellant al- Marri, except as provided in Section1005(e)(2) and (e)(3) of the Detainee <b>Treatment</b> <b>Act</b> (DTA). In plain terms, the MCA removes this Court's jurisdiction (as well as the district court's) over al-Marri's habeas action. Accordingly, the Court should dismiss this appeal for lack of jurisdiction and remand {{the case to the}} district court with instructions to dismiss the petition for lack of jurisdiction.|$|E

500|$|An unusual {{aspect of}} the case was an amicus brief filed by Senators Jon Kyl and Lindsey Graham, which {{presented}} an [...] "extensive colloquy" [...] added to the Congressional record as evidence that [...] "Congress was aware" [...] that the Detainee <b>Treatment</b> <b>Act</b> of 2005 would strip the Supreme Court of jurisdiction to hear cases brought by the Guantanamo detainees.

500|$|In March 2006, Scalia gave a {{talk at the}} University of Fribourg in Switzerland, {{where he}} was asked about detainee rights. He responded, [...] "Give me a break... I had a son on that {{battlefield}} and they were shooting at my son, and I'm not about to give this man who was captured in a war a full jury trial. I mean it's crazy". Though Scalia was not referring to any particular individual, the Supreme Court was about to consider the case of Salim Ahmed Hamdan, supposed driver to Osama bin Laden, who was challenging the military commissions at Guantanamo Bay. A group of retired military officers that supported Hamdan's position asked Scalia to recuse himself, or step aside from hearing the case, which he declined to do. The Court held 5–3 in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld that the federal courts had jurisdiction to consider Hamdan's claims; Scalia, in dissent, contended that any Court authority to consider Hamdan's petition had been eliminated by the jurisdiction-stripping Detainee <b>Treatment</b> <b>Act</b> of 2005.|$|E
