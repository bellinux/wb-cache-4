5|$|Allosteric {{sites are}} pockets on the enzyme, {{distinct}} from the active site, that bind to molecules in the cellular environment. These molecules then cause {{a change in the}} conformation or dynamics of the enzyme that is transduced to the active site and thus affects the reaction rate of the enzyme. In this way, allosteric interactions can either inhibit or activate enzymes. Allosteric interactions with metabolites upstream or downstream in an enzyme's metabolic pathway cause feedback regulation, altering the activity of the enzyme according to the flux <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of the pathway.|$|E

5|$|Almost every silver siliqua in the hoard has had {{its edge}} clipped to some degree. This is typical of Roman silver coin finds of this period in Britain, {{although}} clipped coins are very unusual <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of the Roman Empire.

Eventually, she would join with her old friends Herbert Lehman and Thomas Finletter to form the New York Committee for Democratic Voters, a group dedicated to opposing DeSapio's reincarnated Tammany Hall. Their efforts were eventually successful, and DeSapio was forced to relinquish power in 1961.|$|E

The tunnel would be completed by 1989 and feature public art and stations designed to match the identities of the surrounding area; the tunnel station at Union Station would be designed around an Asian motif reflecting the International District.|$|E

Following a meeting with 11 team captains, practice runs were postponed by the FIBT until later that day to adjust the shape of turn 11 so it would be easier for sleds to get <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of the track without crashing.

On April 29, 1979, the foundations for the Auburn Dam were completed. However, debates continued over whether to build an arched or straight-axis gravity dam.

He also felt that the Flair/Ramon vs. Savage/Perfect match {{was a good one}} until the ending got out of control. Pro Wrestling Torch columnist agreed, stating that the WWF World Heavyweight Championship match was the best and that the Flair/Ramon vs. Savage/Perfect bout was also enjoyable, but he recommended fast-forwarding <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of the show.|$|E
5|$|As {{a part of}} an army-wide reorganization, the division's brigade {{headquarters}} were disbanded {{in favor}} of regimental commands.
