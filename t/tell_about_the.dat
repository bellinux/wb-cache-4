5|$|Legends of Khandoba {{generally}} <b>tell</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> {{battle between}} the deity and demons Malla and Mani. The principle written source of the legend is Malhari Mahatmya (Mallari Mahatmya), which claims {{to be from the}} chapter Kshetra-kanda of the Sanskrit text Brahmanda Purana, but is not included in standard editions of the Purana. R.C. Dhere and Sontheimer suggests that the Sanskrit Mahatmya was composed around 1460-1510 AD, mostly by a Deshastha Brahmin, to whom Khandoba is the family deity. A version is also available in Marathi by Siddhapal Kesasri (1585). Other sources include the later texts of Jayadri Mahatmya and Martanda Vijaya by Gangadhara (1821) and the oral stories of the Vaghyas, bards of the god.|$|E
5|$|Nearby Sierra Nevada Brewing Company {{partnered with}} the monks of New Clairvaux {{to make a}} series of Belgian-style beers under the Ovila Abbey brand. In late 2010, the beer {{producer}} launched a website to <b>tell</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> making of the beer product line {{and the story of}} the restoration of the stones. Sierra Nevada founder Ken Grossman said he had long been interested in making a line of Belgian beers, and the abbey's project provided a good opportunity. The first product, a Dubbel, was released in March 2011, followed in July by a Saison and in November by a Quadrupel. Sierra Nevada has dedicated a percentage of the beer sales to assist in funding the rebuilding project.|$|E
5|$|In all versions, Khandoba {{returns to}} Jejuri {{with his new}} wife and faces the wrath of Mhalsa. Many songs <b>tell</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> {{confrontations}} of Mhalsa and Banai. In some songs, Mhalsa complains about Khandoba's infatuation with the impure Banai. The cantankerous Mhalsa grumbles how Banai has polluted the house by her uncouth ways and suggests that Banai {{should be returned to}} the wilderness again. The songs sing how the vegetarian, high-caste Mhalsa is forced to catch fish and eat in the same plate as the non-vegetarian low-caste Banai. Mhalsa is portrayed blaming Banai for the problems in the palace and talking about her superiority to Banai. Banai retorts by saying that Khandoba came to her, mesmerized by her beauty and became her servant. A frustrated Khandoba leaves the palace on a hunting trip after Mhalsa and Banai quarrel about who will embroider a shawl for him and marries Rambhai. The songs also narrate how ultimately the wives have to remain in harmony and aid each other. For example, a song sings how Mhalsa and Banai come together and celebrate the festival of Diwali with Khandoba at Jejuri.|$|E

These runestones tell of a common situation for Scandinavian families in the 11th century: one son was killed through treason in the South, possibly {{as a member of the}} Varangian Guard, and another son died in Vindau (Ventspils, Latvia).|$|E

Belle also discovers the rope {{indicating}} that Gold was in the room, but when Regina gets a text that Emma was returning, everyone makes their exit. As they do, Hook spots a box and a dreamcatcher on the table. Regina believes that is where Emma stored everyone's memories. They later catch up with Arthur to <b>tell</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> dagger and Excalibur in Emma's possession, Arthur tells them that Emma merged the two together it could either snuff out light or dark magic, leading Mary Margaret to believe that Emma might be trying to eliminate the light magic.|$|E
500|$|In 1842, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow {{wrote the}} poem [...] "The Slave In Dismal Swamp" [...] for his {{collection}} Poems on Slavery. The poem uses six quintain stanzas to <b>tell</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> [...] "hunted Negro", mentioning {{the use of}} bloodhounds and describing the conditions as being [...] "where hardly a human foot could pass, or a human heart would dare". The poem may have inspired artist David Edward Cronin, {{who served as a}} Union officer in Virginia and witnessed the effect of slavery, to paint Fugitive Slaves in the Dismal Swamp, Virginia in 1888.|$|E

500|$|Jatakas {{are stories}} about the Buddha {{before he was born}} as Prince Siddhartha. [...] They are the stories that <b>tell</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> {{previous}} lives of the Buddha, in both human and animal form. The future Buddha may appear in them as a king, an outcast, a god, an elephant—but, in whatever form, he exhibits some virtue that the tale thereby inculcates. Avadanas are similar to jatakas, but the main figure is not the Bodhisattva himself. The saintly deeds in avadanas are attributed to other legendary persons. Jatakas and avadanas are treated in one and the same series in the reliefs of Borobudur.|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} David Robert Jones is {{a reference}} to English musician David Bowie, who was born with that name. [...] "In Which We Meet Mr. Jones" [...] was the first appearance of the character. When actor Jared Harris was first cast for the part, he was told Jones was [...] "possibly a major, important character", {{as indicated by the}} episode's title. Whether his character would make a reappearance later in the season depended on how well received Jones was by the show's audience, Harris' performance, and if the writers felt they had more to <b>tell</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> character. [...] Harris later described Jones in a May 2009 interview, [...] "I think you could sense that there was a great bit of ambiguity about the character which was useful. He's a bad guy that might be on the right side. He just might be fighting for the good guys. Those guys are always great parts because you leave the audience guessing about what side he's really on. He's one of those guys that if he's fighting for the right cause, he's a tremendous ally. But if he's fighting on the wrong cause, he's a formidable opponent. He's an anti-hero who is fighting for the just cause". Harris asserted in a February 2009 interview that he did not sign a recurring contract, meaning that the character was not meant to be permanent. He affirmed this by believing the character's personality rendered Jones incapable of joining the regular cast, [...] "You'd have to keep [...] chained like a dog. You couldn't let him loose. You certainly couldn't let him use his hands. You know what the f--k he'd do".|$|E
2500|$|Internationally, {{the focus}} {{for many years}} in the later 20th century was on {{reaching}} every [...] "people group" [...] with Christianity by the year 2000. [...] Bill Bright's leadership with Campus Crusade, the Southern Baptist International Mission Board, The Joshua Project, and others brought about the need to know who these [...] "unreached people groups" [...] are and how those wanting to <b>tell</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Christian God and share a Christian Bible could reach them. [...] The focus for these organizations transitioned from a [...] "country focus" [...] to a [...] "people group focus". (From [...] "What is a People Group?" [...] by Dr. Orville Boyd Jenkins: [...] A [...] "people group" [...] is an ethnolinguistic group with a common self-identity that is shared by the various members. There are two parts to that word: ethno and linguistic. Language is a primary and dominant identifying factor of a people group. But there are other factors that determine or are associated with ethnicity.) ...|$|E

[...] High says {{there is quite a}} lot to tell about. High continues that an eagle sits on the branches of Yggdrasil and that it has much knowledge. Between the eyes of the eagle sits a hawk called Veðrfölnir. A squirrel called Ratatoskr scurries up and down the ash Yggdrasil carrying [...] "malicious messages" [...] between the eagle and Níðhöggr. Four stags named Dáinn, Dvalinn, Duneyrr, and Duraþrór run between the branches of Yggdrasil and consume its foliage. In the spring Hvergelmir are so many snakes along with Níðhöggr [...] "that no tongue can enumerate them". Two stanzas from Grímnismál are then cited in support. High continues that the norns that live by the holy well Urðarbrunnr each day take water from the well and mud from around it and pour it over Yggdrasil so that the branches of the ash do not rot away or decay. High provides more information about Urðarbrunnr, cites a stanza from Völuspá in support, and adds that dew falls from Yggdrasil to the earth, explaining that [...] "this is what people call honeydew, and from it bees feed".|$|E
