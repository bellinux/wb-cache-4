5|$|According to an {{analysis}} by Tim Flannery, the ecosystem of Lord Howe Island is threatened by climate change and global warming, with <b>the</b> <b>reefs</b> at risk from rises in water temperature. The Great Barrier Reef is specifically identified as being at risk {{to the effects of}} global warming on Australia, and the same analysis applies to <b>the</b> <b>reefs</b> of Lord Howe Island. Cool climate flora and fauna are at risk from rises in temperature, because there is limited scope for migration to higher altitudes.. The first international conference on global artificial photosynthesis as a climate change solution occurred at Lord Howe island in 2011, the papers being published by the Australian Journal of Chemistry.|$|E
5|$|Beaches {{protected}} from tides and storms by coral reefs {{are often the}} best places for housing in tropical countries. Reefs are an important food source for low-technology fishing, both on <b>the</b> <b>reefs</b> themselves and in the adjacent seas. However, despite their great productivity, reefs are vulnerable to over-fishing, {{because much of the}} organic carbon they produce is exhaled as carbon dioxide by organisms at the middle levels of the food chain and never reaches the larger species that are of interest to fishermen. Tourism centered on reefs provides much of the income of some tropical islands, attracting photographers, divers and sports fishermen. However, human activities damage reefs in several ways: mining for construction materials; pollution, including large influxes of fresh water from storm drains; commercial fishing, including the use of dynamite to stun fish and the capture of young fish for aquariums; and tourist damage caused by boat anchors and the cumulative effect of walking on <b>the</b> <b>reefs.</b> Coral, mainly from the Pacific Ocean has long been used in jewellery, and demand rose sharply in the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|Coral reefs form {{some of the}} world's most {{productive}} ecosystems. Common coral reef cnidarians include both Anthozoans (hard corals, octocorals, anemones) and Hydrozoans (fire corals, lace corals). The endosymbiotic algae of many cnidarian species are very effective primary producers, in other words converters of inorganic chemicals into organic ones that other organisms can use, and their coral hosts use these organic chemicals very efficiently. In addition, reefs provide complex and varied habitats that support {{a wide range of}} other organisms. Fringing reefs just below low-tide level also have a mutually beneficial relationship with mangrove forests at high-tide level and sea grass meadows in between: <b>the</b> <b>reefs</b> protect the mangroves and seagrass from strong currents and waves that would damage them or erode the sediments in which they are rooted, while the mangroves and seagrass protect the coral from large influxes of silt, fresh water and pollutants. This additional level of variety in the environment is beneficial to many types of coral reef animals, which for example may feed in the sea grass and use <b>the</b> <b>reefs</b> for protection or breeding.|$|E
5000|$|Reefs {{can develop}} {{vertically}} {{as far as}} the space below the surface allows. <b>The</b> <b>reef</b> generally grows upward from a starting point towards the surface. Once <b>the</b> <b>reef</b> crest reaches sea level <b>the</b> <b>reef</b> may begin growing seaward. Growth begins after flooding, mostly from parts of <b>the</b> <b>reef</b> that have died. Because <b>the</b> <b>reef</b> grows upward, <b>the</b> oldest sediments are found lower in <b>the</b> <b>reef.</b> <b>The</b> <b>reef</b> flat's age indicates when <b>the</b> <b>reef</b> reached sea level. Catch-up reefs have younger surfaces than keep-up reefs of this type.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>reef</b> flat is <b>the</b> shoreward, flat, {{broadest}} area of <b>the</b> <b>reef.</b> <b>The</b> <b>reef</b> flat {{is found}} in fairly shallow water, and can be uncovered during low tide. This area of <b>the</b> <b>reef</b> is only slightly sloped towards the open ocean.|$|R
5000|$|The PRC has {{reclaimed}} land on <b>the</b> <b>reef,</b> bringing its area to 7.6 hectares, and occupied <b>the</b> <b>reef.</b> [...] <b>The</b> <b>reef</b> has a lighthouse {{on top of}} a two storied defence outpost.|$|R
5|$|To {{learn more}} about the Great Florida Reef, Alexander Bache invited Louis Agassiz to study it. The U.S. Coast Survey sent Agassiz to Key Biscayne in 1851. He wrote a {{detailed}} report for Bache on <b>the</b> <b>reefs</b> stretching from Key Biscayne to the Marquesas Keys.|$|E
5|$|Émilie {{departed}} on 3 September 1795 with a congé de navigation authorising her {{to defend}} herself, {{but not to}} take prizes as a privateer. The next day, she made a port call at Saint-Denis before cruising to Mahé. At Sainte Anne Island, two large British ships chased him, but {{he was able to}} evade them by sailing through <b>the</b> <b>reefs,</b> at night.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the change}} in Code Letters in 1934, Centaur was {{allocated}} the Code Letters GMQP. A highlight of Centaurs pre-war career was the rescue of the 385ton Japanese whale-chaser Kyo Maru II in November 1938. Kyo Maru II had developed boiler problems while returning from the Antarctic and was drifting towards the Houtman Abrolhos Archipelago, where she {{was in danger of}} being wrecked by <b>the</b> <b>reefs</b> in the area. Centaur responded to the distress signal and towed Kyo Maru II to Geraldton.|$|E
50|$|Foliaceous Montipora species {{dominate}} <b>the</b> coral <b>reef.</b> Encrusting and branching {{species are}} also present. Faviidae and Poritidae corals {{are contained in}} the inshore areas of <b>the</b> <b>reef</b> in massive colonies. Staghorn, elkhorn, cabbage, brain, table and star corals are all present in <b>the</b> <b>reef.</b> Corals of 60 species belonging to 31 genera are recorded from <b>the</b> <b>reef.</b> <b>The</b> <b>reef</b> also recorded over 170 species of reef fish belonging to 76 genera.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>reef</b> {{gets its}} name from a fallen {{telephone}} pole within <b>the</b> <b>reef.</b>|$|R
25|$|USS LST-203 was {{grounded}} on <b>the</b> <b>reef</b> at Nanumea on 2 October 1943 {{in order}} to land equipment. The rusting hull of the ship remains on <b>the</b> <b>reef.</b> <b>The</b> Seabees also blasted an opening in <b>the</b> <b>reef</b> at Nanumea, which {{became known as the}} 'American Passage'.|$|R
5|$|The {{range of}} the {{epaulette}} shark extends from the southern coast of New Guinea to the northern coast of Australia, {{as far south as}} Sydney. The Capricorn-Bunker Group of the Great Barrier Reef contains a particularly large population, with thousands estimated to inhabit <b>the</b> <b>reefs</b> around Heron Island alone. Additionally, there are unsubstantiated reports of this species from Malaysia, Sumatra, and the Solomon Islands. Epaulette sharks are found in shallow water to a maximum depth of 50m (160ft), and are often seen in water barely deep enough to cover their bodies. They prefer tidal pools, coral flats, and stands of staghorn coral.|$|E
5|$|In August 1810, a {{squadron}} of four of Rowley's frigates, making {{up the majority of}} the forces under his command and led by Captain Samuel Pym, were despatched to Île de France to blockade Grand Port on the south-eastern coast. The arrival of a French squadron under Captain Guy-Victor Duperré on 20 August prompted Pym into ordering an inadequately planned attack on the harbour on 23 August and two of his vessels were wrecked on <b>the</b> <b>reefs</b> that protected the harbour entrance. Pym was unable to withdraw his remaining ships and the entire squadron was lost, leaving Rowley with only his flagship HMS Boadicea and two small brigs to conduct his campaign against six large French frigates. Urgent reinforcements were requested, as French ships under Captain Pierre Bouvet blockaded Île Bourbon.|$|E
5|$|Remaining in {{port for}} six months while her masts and rigging were repaired, she finally sailed again on 26 July for the West Indies. Congress made routine patrols escorting American {{merchant}} ships and seeking out French ships to capture. On two occasions she almost ran aground; first while pursuing a French privateer, she ran into shallow water where large rocks were seen near the surface. Although their exact depth was not determined, Sever immediately abandoned pursuit of the privateer and changed course towards deeper waters. Her second close call occurred {{off the coast of}} the Caicos Islands, when during the night she drifted close to <b>the</b> <b>reefs.</b> At daybreak her predicament was discovered by the lookouts.|$|E
5000|$|Sow and Pigs Reef is a rocky reef in Sydney Harbour, New South Wales, Australia. <b>The</b> <b>reef</b> is {{situated}} {{on the eastern side}} of the main shipping channel between Middle Head and South Head. It is 150 m long and up to 70 m wide. Originally <b>the</b> <b>reef</b> was exposed and resembled a sow and her litter. Explosives were used to reduce <b>the</b> <b>reef,</b> however, and now <b>the</b> <b>reef</b> is only exposed at a very low tide. A number of ships have been wrecked or damaged after hitting <b>the</b> <b>reef.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>reef</b> {{is named}} after the HMS Looe, which ran into <b>the</b> <b>reef</b> and sank in 1744.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>reef</b> {{was named}} after Fairfax Moresby's ship called the Wizard, who visited <b>the</b> <b>reef</b> in 1822.|$|R
5|$|The whitetip reef shark {{is one of}} {{the three}} most common sharks inhabiting <b>the</b> <b>reefs</b> of the Indo-Pacific, the other two being the blacktip reef shark (Carcharhinus melanopterus) and the grey reef shark (Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos). The habitat {{preferences}} of this species overlap those of the other two, though it does not tend to frequent very shallow water like the blacktip reef shark, nor the outer reef like the grey reef shark. The whitetip reef shark swims with strong undulations of its body, and unlike other requiem sharks can lie motionless on the bottom and actively pump water over its gills for respiration. This species is most active at night or during slack tide, and spends much of the day resting inside caves singly or in small groups, arranged in parallel or stacked atop one another. Off Hawaii, these sharks may be found sheltering inside underwater lava tubes, while off Costa Rica they are often seen lying in the open on sandy flats.|$|E
5|$|With Marengo {{damaged and}} Rainier {{actively}} hunting for his squadron, Linois {{withdrew from the}} Bay of Bengal and returned to Isle de France. Rainier knew that his chances of discovering Linois in the open Indian Ocean were insignificant, and instead decided to keep watch for him off his principal base at Port Napoleon. A squadron was detached to the port, but Linois's scouts discovered the blockade before he arrived {{and he was able}} to safely reach Grand Port instead on 31 October. Entering over <b>the</b> <b>reefs</b> that protected the anchorage, Marengos deeper keel scraped on the coral. The ship's hull was badly damaged and her rudder torn off, requiring extensive repairs. Linois was later joined by Captain Bruilhac in Belle Poule, who had captured a valuable merchant ship on his individual cruise in the Bay of Bengal.|$|E
5|$|Africaines {{journey to}} Madras took several months and Corbet {{made a number}} of stops on his passage, the final one being at the small British island base of Rodriguez in early September 1810. There Corbet was {{informed}} of the disaster at Grand Port and on his own initiative immediately sailed south to augment Rowley's weakened squadron. Arriving off Isle de France at 06:15 on 11 September, Corbet spotted a French schooner near Île Ronde and gave chase, the schooner sheltering behind <b>the</b> <b>reefs</b> at Grand Bay on {{the eastern side of the}} island. At 07:30, Corbet ordered the frigate's boats to enter the creek into which the schooner had fled, the small craft entering the waterway in the hope of storming and capturing the vessel. As the boats approached, French soldiers and militia appeared along the banks and began firing on the British sailors. Fire was returned by Royal Marines in the boats, but Africaines barge grounded soon after the ambush was sprung and became trapped, French gunfire killing two men and wounding ten. The other boat reached the grounded and abandoned schooner, but the six men aboard were unable to move the vessel unaided and were forced to depart, coming under fire which wounded five men, before they could escape the French trap.|$|E
50|$|In 1986 the Australian Army ship Crusader (AV2767) was sunk near <b>the</b> <b>reef</b> and {{has become}} a popular dive wreck. <b>The</b> <b>reef</b> was zoned as a marine park in 1998. <b>The</b> <b>reef</b> was not {{affected}} by the 2009 southeast Queensland oil spill.|$|R
40|$|On {{the island}} Bonaire, {{eutrophication}} {{is a point}} of serious concern, affecting <b>the</b> coral <b>reefs</b> in <b>the</b> marine park. Eutrophication can cause altered balance of <b>the</b> <b>reef</b> ecosystem because algae shall outcompete corals, eventually leading to a disturbed composition of <b>the</b> <b>reef.</b> <b>The</b> <b>reef</b> of Bonaire faces nutrient input by various sources, of which enriched groundwater outflow from land to <b>the</b> <b>reef</b> {{is considered to be a}} substantial source. Groundwater is enriched with nutrients due to the e. g. leaking septic tanks. In order to reduce the input of nutrients on <b>the</b> <b>reef</b> via sewage water, a water treatment plant is being built on Bonaire...|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>reef</b> {{has been}} {{described}} as <b>the</b> [...] "ultimate <b>reef</b> diving adventure". [...] <b>The</b> <b>reef</b> is home to large and colourful soft corals. Sharks are common.|$|R
5|$|After the storm, {{officials}} in Réunion declared a disaster {{area for the}} island. The government started an emergency relief fund to provide assistance to the affected families. The European Economic Community donated ₣1.42million francs ($222,000 1989USD) due to the storm. Residents on the island assisted each other by providing lodging and donating clothing. France sent 15,000ration kits, 1,500beds and blankets, and 20cisterns to the island {{in the aftermath of}} Firinga. In addition, 400troops and 50vehicles were dispatched from an insular military base in order to assist the affected populations. Within two days, crews in Réunion restored water access to about 20,000people. Conditions returned to normal in northern Réunion within about a day. In the southern portion, however, it took up to four weeks for life to return to normal. The significant amount of flooding damaged the coral reef system due to excessive runoff. Due to dead animals being washed into the ocean, diving at <b>the</b> <b>reefs</b> was banned for several weeks. The waves had damaged the coral reef system to such extent that there was no regrowth after seven years.|$|E
5|$|Coral reefs {{are some}} of the most biodiverse {{habitats}} on earth supporting large numbers of species, not just of corals but also of fish, molluscs, worms, arthropods, starfish, sea urchins, other invertebrates and algae. Because of the photosynthetic requirements of the corals, they are found in shallow waters, and many of these fringe land masses. With a three-dimensional structure, coral reefs are very productive ecosystems; they provide food for their inhabitants, hiding places of various sizes to suit many organisms, perching places, barriers to large predators and solid structures on which to grow. They are used as breeding grounds and as nurseries by many species of pelagic fish, and they influence the productivity of the ocean for miles around. Anthazoans prey on animals smaller than they are and are themselves eaten by such animals as fish, crabs, barnacles, snails and starfish. Their habitats are easily disturbed by outside factors which unbalance the ecosystem. In 1989, the invasive crown-of-thorns starfish (Acanthaster planci) caused havoc in American Samoa, killing 90% of the corals in <b>the</b> <b>reefs.</b>|$|E
5|$|Darwin's {{interest}} on the biology of reef organisms was focussed on aspects related to his geological idea of subsidence; in particular, {{he was looking for}} confirmation that the reef building organisms could only live at shallow depths. FitzRoy's soundings at the Keeling Islands gave a depth limit for live coral of about 20fathoms (37m), and taking into account numerous observations by others, Darwin worked with a probable limit of 30fathoms (55m). Modern findings suggest a limit of around 100m, still {{a small fraction of the}} depth of the ocean floor at 3000–5000m. Darwin recognised the importance of red algae, and he reviewed other organisms that could have helped to build <b>the</b> <b>reefs.</b> He thought they lived at similarly shallow depths, but banks formed at greater depths were found in the 1880s. Darwin reviewed the distribution of different species of coral across a reef. He thought that the seaward reefs most exposed to wind and waves were formed by massive corals and red algae; this would be the most active area of reef growth and so would cause a tendency for reefs to grow outwards once they reach sea level. He believed that higher temperatures and the calmer water of the lagoons favoured the greatest coral diversity. These ecological ideas are still current, and research on the details continues.|$|E
50|$|There are {{two main}} {{components}} {{that make up a}} fringing <b>reef,</b> <b>the</b> <b>reef</b> flat and <b>the</b> <b>reef</b> slope.|$|R
50|$|New Zealand's first {{artificial}} reef was {{installed at the}} Mount. Construction of <b>the</b> <b>reef</b> was hampered by lack of funds and ironically, too many waves. Initially the public was told <b>the</b> <b>reef</b> would cost about $500k, but costs escalated to $800k,. Media reported that local surfers are disappointed with the waves produced by <b>the</b> <b>reef.</b> <b>The</b> <b>reef</b> has also been blamed for creating rips and has now been removed.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>reef</b> {{which was}} {{originally}} {{suggested in the}} late 1990s suffered considerable delays before construction finally began in June 2008 by the New Zealand Company ASR Ltd and half was completed {{during the summer of}} that year. Construction was suspended for the winter season and resumed the following summer. <b>The</b> <b>reef</b> was officially declared open on 2 November 2009. Like most of <b>the</b> other <b>reefs</b> built to date, <b>the</b> Boscombe <b>Reef</b> was built from large sand-filled geotextile containers. With a total volume of 13,000 m3, <b>the</b> <b>reef</b> was designed purely as a surfing break. Since <b>the</b> <b>reef</b> was built, {{there have been a few}} documented instances of surfers riding waves breaking on <b>the</b> <b>reef.</b> As <b>the</b> season changes into the more energetic winter, it is expected that <b>the</b> <b>reef</b> will break more often. This has subsequently been removed due to damage, safety fears and performance issues.|$|R
5|$|On 22 August, at 2:40 pm, Pym led {{an attack}} on Duperré's {{squadron}} without waiting for Iphigenia and Magicienne, entering the channel {{that led to the}} anchorage at Grand Port. He was followed by Nereide, but Willoughby had refused to allow Pym to embark the harbour pilot: {{the only person in the}} British squadron who knew the passage through <b>the</b> <b>reefs.</b> Without guidance by an experienced pilot, Sirius was aground within minutes and could not be brought off until 8:30 am on 23 August. Nereide anchored nearby during the night to protect the flagship. At 10:00 am, Iphigenia and Magicienne arrived and at 2:40 pm, after a conference between the captains as to the best course of action, the force again attempted to negotiate the channel. Although the squadron was now guided by Nereides pilot, Sirius again grounded at 3:00 pm and Magicienne 15 minutes later after over-correcting to avoid the reef that Sirius had struck. Nereide and Iphigenia continued the attack, Iphigenia engaging Minerve and Ceylon at close range and Nereide attacking Bellone. Long-range fire from Magicienne was also directed at Victor, which was firing on Nereide.|$|E
5|$|Stroma's violent storms {{occasionally}} wrought destruction on the island. In December 1862, a great storm broke {{over the}} island {{with such force that}} it swept right across the northern end of Stroma, leaving wreckage, rocks and seaweed {{on the top of the}} 100-foot-high cliffs and destroying the channels leading to the watermill. However, the sea's destructive power had one positive benefit for the islanders, if not for those caught out by the currents and shoals of the Pentland Firth. Over the last two hundred years, over sixty vessels ranging from fishing boats to large cargo vessels have been wrecked on the shores of Stroma, with many more vessels coming to grief on <b>the</b> <b>reefs</b> and shoals of the neighbouring mainland and Orkney coasts. Many vessels – at least 560 between 1830 and 1990 – have had to be refloated in the Pentland Firth after getting into difficulties. Shipwrecks were a valuable source of income, timber and goods for the islanders, who would salvage liberally – and often with little regard for legality – whenever a stranded ship was abandoned. The building of Stroma's first lighthouse in the late 19th century was initially opposed by some of the islanders who were more concerned with profiting from shipwrecks than preventing them.|$|E
5|$|The British {{response}} to Hamelin's deployment {{was provided by}} Admiral Albemarle Bertie, who collected a squadron of ships from those available at the Cape of Good Hope and placed them {{under the command of}} Commodore Josias Rowley. Bertie gave Rowley instructions to blockade the islands and prepare for invasion attempts once the required forces could be spared. During 1809 and the spring of 1810, Rowley maintained the blockade and launched a series of small raids, the largest being at Saint Paul on Île Bonaparte in September 1809. By July 1810, Rowley had developed sufficient forces at his island base on Rodriguez to successfully invade and capture Île Bonaparte, which he restored to its former name of Île Bourbon. In August, Rowley attempted to extend his blockade of Isle de France by seizing small islands off the main ports that could control the passage of shipping through the coral reefs that surround the island. The first operation was to capture Île de la Passe off Grand Port, which was successfully secured on 13 August. Shortly afterwards a French squadron forced passage into the harbour and Captain Samuel Pym ordered the four frigates of the blockade squadron to attack the ships anchored in the bay. The ensuing Battle of Grand Port was a disaster for the British, as two frigates were wrecked on <b>the</b> <b>reefs</b> and two others captured with their entire crews: only the very seriously wounded, including Captain Nesbit Willoughby, were repatriated to Île Bourbon.|$|E
