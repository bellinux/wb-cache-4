5|$|Cold Fear was {{met with}} mixed reviews, with many critics {{comparing}} it unfavorably to Resident Evil 4. Although critics were generally impressed with the environments and the opening scenes, they found the game too short and felt it failed <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> promising beginning. The game was a commercial failure; by February 2006, it had sold only 70,000 units across all three platforms in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Jesus for President {{is divided}} into four chapters, the first two of which {{summarize}} the Bible from a New Monastic perspective. The summary of the Old Testament argues that the Israelites had a unique political philosophy, but that they failed <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> implications. The New Testament summary considers Jesus' politics and the qualities of the Christian Church. The third chapter suggests implications of this narrative for citizens of the United States, who the authors describe as members of an empire {{similar to that of}} the Romans. This chapter argues that the Book of Revelation has more to do with living faithfully in an evil empire than with eschatology. The chapter also asserts that Constantinianism had generally negative consequences for the Church. The fourth chapter tells of Christians living in countercultural ways that model divine redemption towards others. Other stories involve heterodox economics, defending the homeless, Amish forgiveness, dumpster diving, missional robotics, Martin Luther King Jr., anti-war protests, and The Simple Way.|$|E

25|$|Nevertheless, dubbed Operation Off Balance, {{the plan}} tried <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> name by kicking off hurriedly on 1 July 1969, {{three days after}} it was proposed. The Hmong Bataillon Guerrier 206 (Warrior Battalion 206) was helilifted to a landing zone at the old Operation Momentum base at San Luang. They moved out on foot northeastward toward the objective. Neutralist Bataillon Commando 208 (Commando Battalion 208), which had been regrouped at Xieng Dat after their flight from Muang Soui, marched eastward to join that column. In a {{separate}} move, the paratroop battalion, 101 Bataillon de Parachutistes (101st Parachute Battalion), was helicoptered to Ban Na, southeast of the objective, to begin their approach march. In a third part of the operation, the Hmong Bataillon Guerrier 201 (Warrior Battalion 201) paired with the Neutralist Bataillon d'Infanterie 15 (Battalion of Infantry 15); they were helicoptered to Phou So to walk south to Muang Soui.|$|E
25|$|The Deuteronomistic Historians, who {{redacted}} the Former Prophets (Joshua, Judges, 1 & 2 Samuel, 1 & 2 Kings), idealized Samuel as {{a figure}} who is larger than life like Joshua. Samuel's father, Elkanah, is described as having originated from Zuph, specifically Ramathaim-Zophim, {{which was part of}} the tribal lands of Ephraim, while the Books of Chronicles state that he was a Levite. Samuel is a judge who leads the military like in the Book of Judges and also who exercises judicial functions. In 1 Sam 12:6–17, the Deuteronomic Historians composed a speech of Samuel that portrays him as the judge sent by God to save Israel. In 1 Samuel 9:6–20, Samuel is seen as a local “seer”. The Deuteronomistic Historians preserved this view of Samuel while contributing him as “the first of prophets to articulate the failure of Israel <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> covenant with God.” For the Deuteronomistic Historians, Samuel was an extension of Moses and continuing Moses’ function as a prophet, judge, and priest, which made historical Samuel uncertain.|$|E

Pauline Kael of The New Yorker wrote, [...] "It feels morose and unrelieved, {{despite the efforts of}} ..." [...] Variety wrote, [...] "Belying the lightheartedness of its title, Birdy is a heavy adult drama about best friends and the after-effects of war, but it takes too long <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> ambitious premise."

500|$|Over {{a series}} of {{tethered}} and free-flying test flights lasting up to 43 minutes, the HZ-1 suffered a pair of accidents. Both crashes occurred under similar conditions – the contra-rotating rotors intermeshed and collided, the blades shattering, causing an immediate loss of control resulting in a crash. Aerodynamic testing was conducted in the full-scale wind tunnel at the Langley Research Center, and {{it was discovered that}} the Aerocycle's forwards speed was limited by an uncontrollable pitching motion, but rotor-tip clearance was always sufficient. The inability to determine the precise cause of the intermeshing, combined {{with the fact that the}} [...] "personal lifting device" [...] concept was failing <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> expectations, led to the decision to terminate the project.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to the general dungeon-clearing gameplay, the combat itself was criticized by reviewers like Padilla, who said that [...] "the weapon use is the most disappointing facet of this game". Both Fahey and Mueller felt that the combat, while initially fun, quickly became boring due to the simplicity. Chandran added that magic spells were too slow to be useful in combat, further reducing {{the complexity of the}} gameplay. Chandran and GamePro both criticized the [...] "sparse and slow" [...] story, while Fahey dismissed it as [...] "a gossamer-thin layer which tries and fails miserably to hold everything together" [...] and nothing more than several role-playing game clichés stuck together. Padilla concluded that while the game had several good elements, it ultimately failed <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> potential as a Mana game.|$|E

[...] The International Air Transport Association (IATA) {{found that there were}} many spots in the passenger terminal where checked passengers can meet people who have not passed through security checks and could receive unchecked objects and then carry them on board aircraft. [...] The IATA also suggested that AoT deploy its own security staff instead of contracting out the job to the Loxley-ICTS consortium.

500|$|In 1935, as {{tensions}} in East Asia were mounting, the Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian Affairs, Stanley Hornbeck, commissioned MacMurray {{to write a}} memorandum on the situation. The memorandum, [...] "Developments Affecting American Policy in the Far East", challenged many of the underlying assumptions of U.S. policy towards Japan. The conventional wisdom held that Japan was the unprovoked aggressor in the brewing conflict with China. [...] However, MacMurray posited that Chinese and American policies were partly to blame for Japan’s actions; whereas Japan had closely adhered to the treaties and agreements brokered during the Washington Disarmament Conference, the United States, Great Britain and China frequently undermined them. Up until the Japanese invasion of Manchuria in 1931, the [...] "Japanese Government... was endeavoring in unimpeachable good faith <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> undertakings", wrote MacMurray. [...] "The issue of success or failure for the policies evolved at the Washington Conference was actually {{in the hands of}} China herself, of Great Britain, and of the United States." ...|$|E

[...] Jake MacNeill of Digital Entertainment News was also favourable, considering it {{to be one of}} the better episodes of the season. James Plath of DVD Town wrote that the episode has [...] "some funny moments." [...] Aaron Roxby of Collider was more critical, denouncing the episode's dated references. He wrote: [...] "I am going to go ahead and give this one the benefit of the doubt and assume that making fun of Japanese junk culture and game shows felt fresher in 1999 than it does do now." [...] Colin Jacobson of DVD Movie Guide called the episode [...] "mediocre". He wrote that, though the episode's concept should [...] "open up lots of interesting possibilities", it [...] "doesn't explore them particularly well".

500|$|Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, {{in their}} book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, gave the episode a mixed review and rated the episode three out of five. The two praised the scene {{featuring}} the cow getting sucked up by the tornado, calling it [...] "really, very funny" [...] and [...] "comic genius", but noted that [...] "a romantic comedy cannot work by flying cows alone." [...] Shearman and Pearson cited casting flaws {{as to why the}} episodes as not able <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> potential. Other reviews were more negative. In a review of the seventh season episode [...] "Brand X", Sarah Kendzior from 11th Hour Magazine cited [...] "The Rain King" [...] as one of the worst episodes of The X-Files. Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a mixed review and awarded it two stars out of four. Vitaris heavily criticized the [...] "flying cow" [...] scene—noting that the scene was both [...] "poorly executed" [...] and [...] "offensive" [...] for turning the death of a creature into a joke—as well as the final scene, which, according to her, featured a [...] "false pastel sky". Andy Meisler, in The End and the Beginning noted that the episode was poorly received by fans on the Internet.|$|E
500|$|Numerous {{publications}} {{declared the}} gameplay was {{an improvement over}} the original. John Davison of GamePro wrote [...] "BioWare has done a spectacular job moving the role playing genre forward, and blending disparate gameplay styles into genuinely exciting sci-fi epic." [...] VanOrd praised Mass Effect 2 for possessing an identity, which was something that its predecessor lacked. He noted that the shooting is [...] "more immediate and satisfying, which keeps the pace moving and intensifies the violence of each encounter". Similarly, GameSpys Gerald Villoria observed that, while the original Mass Effect [...] "walked the line between RPG and shooter [...] Mass Effect 2 has become a much more focused shooter experience". Jeremy Parish of 1UP.com credited the combat for being more balanced, stating that the game encourages players to use different weapon classes and squad abilities when the situation requires it. Despite the praise, some publications like GameCritics and RPGamer expressed concerns about the game's simplified RPG elements, calling it [...] "stripped-down" [...] and with a [...] "dumbed-down feeling". Some reviewers also criticized the slow planet scanning. Game Revolution {{felt it was a}} [...] "chore, mandatory if you want upgrades and boring because there is no tension or challenge", but ultimately concluded that the game as a whole [...] "does more than enough <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> predecessor". Italian journalist Jaime d'Alessandro of la Repubblica defined Mass Effect 2 as [...] "dazzling" [...] and [...] "a great sci-fi fresco that would be a shame to miss." ...|$|E
500|$|Critics {{noted the}} game's length as shorter than expected, with about ten hours of content. Clayman (IGN) had little desire to replay the solved puzzles and Bramwell (Eurogamer) was even {{eager for the}} game to end. Halverson (Play) planned {{to return to the}} game but wrote that he would have {{preferred}} five more hours of the single-player over the Xbox Live features. Reviewers were largely unimpressed with the extra Xbox Live cooperative play and score attack features. Halverson (Play) had hopes for Kameo and Psychonauts to rekindle developer interest in the 3D platforming genre, but concluded that such games were likely not to return. Clayman (IGN) did not find the game <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> publicity as a competitor against The Legend of Zelda series, though Theobald (GameSpy) thought Kameo boss battles were comparable. Pfister (1UP.com) noted several traditional Rare flourishes—lots of color and graphics effects, puns for character names—but ultimately wrote that Kameo was proof that Microsoft had received [...] "exactly what they paid for" [...] in its acquisition of Rare. Theobald (GameSpy) said that Rare had avoided its usual tropes of making players collect lots of items and poor character design, and made a [...] "worthy" [...] launch title. Nigel Kendall (The Times) wrote that the game was [...] "more cerebral" [...] than the console's other games, which were stereotypically about driving, football, or shooting. Kasavin (GameSpot) noted that Kameo was the most accessible launch title to players of all ages. In summary, he thought the game was a suitable fit for players' first experiences on the new Xbox 360.|$|E

500|$|Following the Red River Rebellion, Métis {{travelled}} {{west and}} settled in the Saskatchewan Valley, especially along the south branch of the river in the country surrounding the Saint-Laurent mission (near modern St. Laurent de Grandin, Saskatchewan). But by the 1880s, it had become clear that westward migration was no panacea for the troubles of the Métis and the plains Indians. The rapid collapse of the buffalo herd was causing near starvation among the Plains Cree and Blackfoot First Nations. This was exacerbated by a reduction in government assistance in 1883, and by a general failure of Ottawa <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> treaty obligations. The Métis were likewise obliged {{to give up the}} hunt and take up agriculture—but this transition was accompanied by complex issues surrounding land claims similar to those that had previously arisen in Manitoba. Moreover, settlers from Europe and the eastern provinces were also moving into the Saskatchewan territories, and they too had complaints related to the administration of the territories. Virtually all parties therefore had grievances, and by 1884 English settlers, Anglo-Métis and Métis communities were holding meetings and petitioning a largely unresponsive government for redress. In the electoral district of Lorne, a meeting of the south branch Métis was held in the village of Batoche on 24 March, and thirty representatives voted to ask Riel to return and represent their cause. On 6 May a joint [...] "Settler's Union" [...] meeting was attended by both the Métis and English-speaking representatives from Prince Albert, including William Henry Jackson, an Ontario settler sympathetic to the Métis and known to them as Honoré Jackson, and James Isbister of the Anglo-Métis. It was here resolved to send a delegation to ask Riel's assistance in presenting their grievances to the Canadian government.|$|E

Helen Pidd from The Guardian favoured the blend of 1980s musical styles on the album, but felt that it lacked danceable songs, saying [...] "Problem is, as {{with the majority of}} other tracks – including, most disappointingly, the Dennis-penned [...] "After Dark" [...] – you would be hard pushed to dance to it, which could well be Body Languages downfall". John Robinson from NME gave Body Language an overall positive review and called it [...] "an extremely tastefully done, soulful modern r'n'b record", but felt that it [...] "fails <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> predecessor [...] ". Likewise, Adrien Begnard from PopMatters felt that Body Language lacked the [...] "undeniably catchy" [...] material which was present in Fever, but praised the overall production and {{the first half of the}} album; he concluded that [...] "Even though Body Language is a bit of a misstep for Minogue, there's a sense of class to it" [...] and that [...] "Britney [...] could learn a thing or two". The Spin review of the album commented that Minogue [...] "wears the '80s well" [...] and praised the dance-oriented songs on the track list, although they criticised the ballads and pointed out that [...] " [...] Minogue's vocals are so over-processed that they barely seem to exist at all". On the other hand, Andy Battaglia from The A.V. Club opined that the ballads [...] "work" [...] and concluded that [...] "Body Language shows Minogue as a surprisingly impressive presence in spurts, but she sounds better with her pleasure engine revving at full purr".|$|E

During a match against Chelsea in February 1952, Ford scored a first-half hat-trick during the match as the Mackems found themselves 4–0 up at half-time, Shackleton having also scored. In the second- half of the match, Shackleton was believed to have [...] "switched off" [...] as he considered the match already won, leaving Ford to largely play up-front on his own against the opposition defense, resulting in a frustrated Ford to claim {{to members of the}} local press after the game that Shackleton never deliberately passed to him during games. Things became so heated between the pair that, during a friendly match against a Netherlands B side, Shackleton dribbled past the opposition goalkeeper before stopping on the goal-line and passing the ball back to Ford before commenting [...] "Here, don't say I never give you a pass" [...] in reference to Ford's displeasure at his belief that Shackleton would play the ball in areas Ford did not want it. Billy Bingham, who played alongside the pair at Sunderland, later commented [...] "He (Ford) never seemed to know what Shackleton was {{going to do with the}} ball and subsequently Trevor believed that Shackleton was ignoring him on the field of play". Stan Anderson, another former teammate of the pair, believed that Shackleton was jealous of Ford's perceived good looks and also supported Ford's claims of Shackleton deliberately misplacing passes to Ford on at least one occasion, commenting [...] "I just had the feeling he (Shackleton) never wanted Trevor to score, which made me really angry".|$|E
