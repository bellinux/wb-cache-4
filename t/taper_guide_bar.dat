5000|$|The {{chainsaw}} [...] "blades" [...] are technically {{known as}} [...] "guide bars". For chainsaw carving these bars have very small noses (typically around 25 mm diameter). This enables {{the artist to}} create detail in the carving that would be impossible with a standard <b>guide</b> <b>bar.</b> The chains that are used on these <b>guide</b> <b>bars</b> are normally modified by reducing {{the length of the}} teeth in order that they are able to cut efficiently {{at the tip of the}} bar. The reason for this modification is that all chains manufactured currently (circa 2007) are made to be used on standard <b>guide</b> <b>bars</b> only. These [...] "carving bars" [...] are manufactured by [...] "Cannon", [...] "GB", and by a companies in Japan supplying [...] "Stihl" [...] and others. The other very important advantage with these <b>guide</b> <b>bars</b> is that they do not [...] "kickback" [...] when using the tip. they are therefore very safe to use in comparison with standard <b>guide</b> <b>bars.</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract This paper {{conducts a}} {{comprehensive}} {{study on the}} optimization design for crank arc <b>guide</b> <b>bar</b> gathering mechanism of crab claw type loading machine. The optimization aim is to make reality locus of gathering claw end-point be as in-accordance as possible with ideal locus, and so on. Formulae are derived for displacement of gathering claw end-point and position angle of the gathering claw. An optimization design model is established for the crank arc <b>guide</b> <b>bar</b> gathering mechanism. The crank arc <b>guide</b> <b>bar</b> gathering mechanism is optimized of crab claw type loading machine with 2100 mm wide, and the optimization result is satisfactory. Compared to the optimized crank straight line <b>guide</b> <b>bar</b> gathering mechanism in literature [2], the locus error function of gathering claw end-point has been largely improved with a reduction of 25. 8 %...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1996 Increased {{competition}} in the market place for both occasional and professional chain saw users {{has led to a}} desire for improved performance in chain saw <b>guide</b> <b>bars.</b> One aspect of improved performance is lower bar weight. The primary focus of this research was to establish the feasibility of a lower weight, composite, chain saw <b>guide</b> <b>bar.</b> A production steel chain saw <b>guide</b> <b>bar</b> was analyzed using COSMOS finite element modeling. This analysis determined the feasibility of totally or partially replacing the steel with a lower density composite material. Classical strength of materials analytical techniques for beams in bending were used to verify the FEA models accuracy. Additionally, strain gauges were used in high stress areas to further verify the FEA models. Various fiber reinforced thermoplastic pre-pregs were considered for the prototype research. From the literature study performed, two candidate thermoplastic matrices were chosen for further evaluation. Analyses of polyetherimide and polyphenylene sulfide were performed using differential scanning calorimetry and dynamic mechanical testing. From these tests, information concerning processing temperature and ultimate end use requirements were determined. Necessary electric heaters and other apparatus were fabricated to produce composite lay-ups. Pre-preg fiber lay-up orientation was determined from the finite element analysis and wear requirements. From the analysis and testing two prototype chain saw bars were designed and then fabricated. The first bar was composed entirely of carbon reinforced polyetherimide. The second bar was a hybrid design utilizing steel side laminates adhesively bonded to a central core of carbon fiber reinforced polyphenylene sulfide. Fabricated prototype <b>guide</b> <b>bars</b> were evaluated using a production power head...|$|R
30|$|Although {{our sample}} size was {{increased}} by pooling the variables of {{the right and left}} sides, it was nonetheless small. In addition, even though both retractors are composed of thick (0.9  mm) stainless steel wires, the lever arm and <b>guide</b> <b>bar</b> could be deflected during retraction, making accurate force application and location of the force vector difficult. Therefore, a modified APLR is proposed, in which the lever arms of both sides are connected to prevent deflection and a trans-palatal arch is added to link the posterior segments [20]. Furthermore, the difference between the angles of the position of the <b>guide</b> <b>bar</b> and tube as well as correlations between tube height and anterior and posterior intrusion should be considered in future studies.|$|R
50|$|A common {{accident}} {{arises from}} kickback, when a chain tooth {{at the tip}} of the <b>guide</b> <b>bar</b> catches on wood without cutting through it. This throws the bar (with its moving chain) in an upward arc toward the operator which can cause serious injury or even death.|$|R

50|$|Electric {{railways}} with third rails, {{or fourth}} rails, in tunnels carry collector shoes projecting laterally (sideways), or vertically, from their bogies. The contact shoe may slide {{on top of}} the third rail (top running), on the bottom (bottom running) or on the side (side running). The side running contact shoe is used against the <b>guide</b> <b>bars</b> on rubber-tired metros. A vertical contact shoe is used on ground-level power supply systems, stud contact systems and fourth rail systems. A pair of contact shoes was used on underground current collection systems. The contact shoe on a stud contact system is called a ski collector. The ski collector moves vertically to accommodate slight variations in the height of the studs. Contact shoes may also be used on overhead conductor rails, on <b>guide</b> <b>bars</b> or on trolley wires. Most railways use three rails, while the London Underground uses four rails.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the design and}} fabrication of a long scan stage for metrological atomic force microscope. On designing the system, we mainly consider a simple structure with low vibration and high accuracy. In stead of the traditional two level stages, we used a surface plate as the reference of the main stage. Therefore, it has low profile and simple structure. Surface plate {{was made of the}} ceramic glass with very low thermal expansion. The stage is positioned on the surface plate of 800 mm x 800 mm. It is guided horizontally by a cross structure with two precision bars perpendicularly linked and vertically by the surface plate. The sliding pads of PTFE are used at X- and Y-axes, and also used for vertically supporting the stage. The X-axis <b>guide</b> <b>bar</b> with a moving plate is glued on the surface plate. The Y-axis <b>guide</b> <b>bar</b> is attached to the X-axis moving plate and moved to the Y-direction. Finally the Y-axis <b>guide</b> <b>bar</b> <b>guides</b> the XY-stage plate, so the XY-stage plate can be moved to two directions. This global stage also has the two-axis flexure structure machined by the precision wire-cutting machine. By combining global stage and micro-stage, the fast and long movement and the fine positioning can be provided. A two-axis tilt stage for adjusting the pitch motions of the stage and a L-shaped mirror for laser interferometer is positioned on the tilt stage...|$|R
2500|$|A {{few lines}} of the Paris Métro in France operate on a four-rail power scheme. The trains move on rubber tyres which roll {{on a pair of}} narrow roll ways made of steel and, in some places, of concrete. Since the tyres do not conduct the return current, the two <b>guide</b> <b>bars</b> {{provided}} outside the running 'roll ways' become, in a sense, a third and fourth rail which each provide 750 V DC, so at least electrically it is a four-rail scheme. Each wheel set of a powered truck carries one traction motor. A side sliding (side running) contact shoe picks up the current from the vertical face of each <b>guide</b> <b>bar.</b> The return of each traction motor, as well as each wagon, is effected by one contact shoe each that slide on top of each one of the running rails. This and all other rubber-tyred metros that have a [...] track between the roll ways operate in the same manner.|$|R
