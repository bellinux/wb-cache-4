5|$|Hurricane Joan's {{path through}} the {{southern}} Caribbean in late October was highly unusual. Most October storms in the Atlantic gravitate towards the northern portion of the Caribbean, and often recurve quickly. Joan took the southernmost path of a tropical cyclone since a June system in 1933, although Hurricane Irene in 1971 took a path <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> north of Joan's. Joan-Miriam was also unusual in that it survived passage from the Atlantic to Pacific Ocean. Only seven other storms {{have been known to}} survive the passage between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.|$|E
5|$|The RAE's {{comments}} about the self-exciting transmitter were not random: they were referring to work <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> coming to fruition at EMI {{as a direct result}} of Lewis' earlier contract. EMI engineers Alan Blumlein and Eric White had developed a system that dispensed with a self-exciting transmitter circuit and instead used a separate modulator that fed the signal into the transmitter for amplification. The oscillator signal was also sent to the receiver, using it to damp its sensitivity. The combined effect was to sharpen the transmitted pulse, while reducing 'ringing' in the receiver. In a test in May 1940, Hanbury Brown was able to clearly see the return at a range of , and could still make it out when they approached to 400.|$|E
5|$|Questions then arose {{among the}} U.S. {{administration}} and military leadership {{as to the}} best method by which Hanoi (the perceived locus of the insurgency) could be dissuaded from its course of action. The answer seemed to lie {{in the application of}} air power. By 1964 most of the civilians surrounding President Lyndon B. Johnson shared the Joint Chiefs of Staff's collective faith in the efficacy of strategic bombing to one degree or another. They reasoned that a small nation like North Vietnam, with a tiny industrial base <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> emerging after the First Indochina War, would be reluctant to risk its new-found economic viability to support the insurgency in the south. Constantly affecting this decision-making process were fears of possible counter moves or outright intervention by the Soviet Union, the PRC, or both. The civilians and the military were divided, however, on the manner of affecting Hanoi's will to support the southern insurgency. The civilians thought in terms of changing the regime's behavior while the military men were more concerned with breaking its will.|$|E

5|$|Those {{who served}} in {{government}} had a privileged position in Han society <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> one tier below the nobles (yet some high officials were also ennobled and had fiefs). They could not be arrested for crimes unless permission was granted by the emperor. However, when officials were arrested, they were imprisoned and fettered like commoners. Their punishments in court also had to gain {{the approval of the}} emperor. Officials were not exempt from execution, yet they were often given a chance to commit suicide as a dignified alternative. The most senior posts were the Three Excellencies—excluding the Grand Tutor, a post that was irregularly occupied. The individual titles and functions of the Three Excellencies changed from Western to Eastern Han. However, their annual salaries remained at 10,000 dan (石) of grain, largely commuted to payments in coin cash and luxury items like silk. Below them were the Nine Ministers, each of whom headed a major government bureau and earned 2,000 bushels a year. The lowest-paid government employees made Equivalent to 100 bushels annually. It was thought that wealthy officials would be less tempted by bribes. Therefore, {{in the beginning of the}} dynasty, having a total assessed taxable wealth of one hundred thousand coins was a prerequisite for holding office. This was reduced to forty thousand coins in 142 BCE, yet from Emperor Wu's reign onwards this policy was no longer enforced.|$|E

40|$|The medieval {{commentators}} of the Nicomachean Ethics paid {{special attention}} to the Aristotelian distinction between things <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>just</b> by nature and things <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>just</b> by law. This paper examines how three commentators from {{the first half of the}} 14 th century understood this text: Radulfus Brito, Walter Burley and Geraldus Odonis. The interpretations of the first two was notoriously influenced by that of Aquinas, in spite of the Condemnation of 1277, since they understood Natural Justice in terms of Aquinas’s theory of Natural Law. On his part, Odonis, who was the first Franciscan to write a commentary on the Ethics, is more original, as evidenced in (i) his idea that in all manifestations of Legal Justice there are always underlying natural elements; (ii) his concern to link Aristotle’s teaching on Natural Justice with certain Platonic themes; and by (iii) his rather convincing analyses of the examples that Aristotle offers when addressing the possibility of change in both things <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>just</b> by nature and things <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>just</b> by law...|$|R
