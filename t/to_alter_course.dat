25|$|In {{accordance}} with Visscher's directions, Tasman sailed from Batavia on 14 August 1642 {{and arrived at}} Mauritius on 5 September 1642, according to the captain's journal. The reason for this was the crew could be fed well on the island; {{there was plenty of}} fresh water and timber to repair the ships. Tasman got the assistance of the governor Adriaan van der Stel. Because of the prevailing winds Mauritius was chosen as a turning point. After a four-week stay on the island both ships left on 8 October using the Roaring Forties to sail east as fast as possible. (No one had gone as far as Pieter Nuyts in 1626/27.) On 7 November snow and hail influenced the ship's council <b>to</b> <b>alter</b> <b>course</b> to a more north-eastern direction, expecting to arrive one day at the Solomon Islands.|$|E

Recommend you come right immediately!", but this message was relayed by [...] "talkers" [...] (men charged with {{relaying}} messages for officers to different stations) and the talker who was supposed to pass Peckham's message to Brown had a tendency to mumble badly. At the same time Peckham was attempting to alert Brown of the impending grounding, Morris again approached Brown and recommended coming right to avoid the shoal water. Captain Brown did not recall being informed of this, and made no reply to Morris. At this point Morris took a bearing on Thimble Shoals, and alarmed at the impending grounding Morris frantically returned to the captain waving his arms and shouting [...] "Come right! There's shoal water ahead!" [...] A disbelieving Captain Brown dismissed Morris pleas by stating that it was his belief that the navigator did not know where they were. To verify Morris' claims of impending shoal water, Brown asked Commander Millet to check Morris's position. As a precautionary move, Brown then ordered Quartermaster Travis, Missouris helmsman, <b>to</b> <b>alter</b> <b>course</b> to 058, but this order came too late.|$|E

2500|$|In April 1942, Whitehall {{returned}} to the United Kingdom to rejoin her escort group, and was selected for conversion into a Long-Range Escort. In May 1942, she entered the Royal Navy Dockyard at Sheerness to undergo a refit and begin the conversion, which included the installation of a Type 271 surface warning radar and a Type 286P air warning radar. After the completion of her post-conversion acceptance trials and pre-deployment work-ups, she rejoined her escort group in August 1942. On 30 September 1942, she was detached from the group to escort the 1st Minelaying Squadron while it laid mines in the Northern Barrage, and in October 1942 she transferred to the 2nd Escort Group to continue North Atlantic convoy defence operations.
