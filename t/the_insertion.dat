5|$|Because his Nung {{soldiers}} were exhausted, with their ammunition and water supplies running low, White believed {{they could not}} defend the Ngok Tavak garrison in case the VC launched another major attack.

However, both White and Makowski knew that reinforcement was unlikely, because the two downed helicopters would prevent <b>the</b> <b>insertion</b> of additional soldiers, and the road between Ngok Tavak and Khâm Đức was likely to be covered by the opposing forces waiting in ambush positions. White then decided to evacuate Ngok Tavak and withdraw his troops to safety. As part of the evacuation plan, any type of equipment that could not be taken or was considered to be of value to the opponent was dumped into the command bunker and set alight using captured enemy flamethrowers.

40|$|Previously, we {{isolated}} three transposon insertion mutants of Bacteroides ovatus (M- 4, M- 5, and M- 7) {{that were}} unable to grow on the branched polysaccharide guar gum. In this study, we used a tetracycline resistance gene on the transposon to clone chromosomal DNA adjacent to <b>the</b> transposon <b>insertions</b> {{in each of the}} three mutants. Restriction analysis of the flanking chromosomal DNA in M- 4 and M- 7 revealed that <b>the</b> <b>insertions</b> in these two mutants were in the same location. The cloned DNA adjacent to <b>the</b> <b>insertions</b> in M- 5 and M- 7 was used as a hybridization probe to clone the wild-type loci. Two clones of about 10 kbp in size were obtained. Restriction analysis showed that these two clones did not overlap. The clone of the M- 5 locus appeared to contain all of the genes affected by <b>the</b> M- 5 <b>insertion,</b> but we {{were unable to}} demonstrate complementation of the M- 5 mutation because of the instability of the clone in this background. Analysis of the clone of the M- 7 locus showed that it contained a guar gum-regulated promoter, but the transcript originating from this promoter was not affected by <b>the</b> transposon <b>insertion.</b> Thus, <b>the</b> M- 7 locus apparently contains at least two separate transcriptional units, the one defined by this promoter and the one interrupted by <b>the</b> transposon <b>insertion.</b> Insertion mutations downstream of the guar gum-regulated promoter demonstrated that there were essential guar gum utilization genes in this region.

5|$|Exclusion of {{judicial}} review has been attempted by the Parliament of Singapore to protect the exercise of executive power.

5|$|From 1889 to 1902, an {{extensive}} programme of conservation {{was carried out}} on the bridge and gate, directed by Monmouthshire County Council, which retained responsibility for maintenance.

In 1892, conservation work began on the arches and piers of the bridge following the discovery that riverbed erosion had seriously undermined the piers. Maintenance was carried out on the gatehouse exterior from the mid-1890s to 1897. Roof guttering and downpipes were added, badly eroded stone was replaced with squared blocks of Old Red Sandstone, and the cruciform arrowslit on the left-hand side of the west elevation of the gatehouse was restored to make it symmetrical.

We have {{performed}} a genome-wide screen for recent adaptive transposable element insertions in Drosophila melanogaster. While previous studies included only {{a subset of}} <b>the</b> transposable element <b>insertions</b> present in <b>the</b> reference genome, we have now analyzed all <b>the</b> euchromatic <b>insertions</b> in three out-of-Africa populations, North Carolina (US), Bari (Italy) and Stockholm (Sweden), and in one African population from the ancestral range of the species. We identified 41 candidate adaptive TEs with significantly different frequencies within and outside of Africa. One of <b>the</b> putatively adaptive <b>insertions</b> identified is a roo solo-LTR retrotransposon located in the 5 '-UTR of CG 18446, a candidate cold-stress response gene. We found that besides FBti 0019985, there are another eight transposable elements inserted in the proximal promoter region of CG 18446. All nine insertions are solo-LTRs that belong to the roo family. We found that different insertions have different molecular and functional consequences. The exact position where the transposable elements are inserted matters, as they all showed highly conserved sequences but only two of <b>the</b> analyzed <b>insertions</b> provided alternative transcription start sites, and only <b>the</b> FBti 0019985 <b>insertion</b> consistently affects CG 18446 expression.
