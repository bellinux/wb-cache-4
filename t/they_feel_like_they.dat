While jumped in <b>they</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> are the machine, using the vehicle or drone's sensors to replace their own. This allows the rigger to control the machine at Matrix speeds and with greater precision. The downside is if the machine takes damage the rigger {{will have to deal}} with dangerous levels of biofeedback. Likewise the rigger may have to engage in cybercombat with other hackers that are attempting to hijack their devices.|$|E
25|$|However, some Japanese fans {{of hip-hop}} find it {{embarrassing}} and ridiculous that these blackface fans {{do this because}} <b>they</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> shouldn't change their appearance to embrace the culture. In some instances {{it can be seen}} as a racist act, but for many of the young the Japanese fans it is a way of immersing in the hip hop culture the way they see fit. For example, the Japanese hip hop group Soul'd Out is extremely imitative of African American culture. Looking at Soul'd Out, their appearance stands out. Their wardrobe undoubtedly reminds one of African American fashion.|$|E
500|$|In 2010, M.I.A. voiced {{her fears}} of the {{influence}} of video game violence on her son and his generation, saying, [...] "I don't know which is worse. The fact that I saw it in my life has maybe given me lots of issues, but there's a whole generation of American kids seeing violence on their computer screens and then getting shipped off to Afghanistan. <b>They</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> know the violence when they don't. Not having a proper understanding of violence, especially what it's like {{on the receiving end of}} it, just makes you interpret it wrong and makes inflicting violence easier." ...|$|E

Only a select few may be chosen, so {{they are trying to}} keep their cool under enormous pressure. <b>They</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> everything <b>they</b> have done throughout their life had led up to this moment.|$|R
40|$|This conversation, {{facilitated}} by Dr. Peter Frost, addressed whether people really can multitask or if <b>they</b> just <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> can. Other questions addressed include: How is multitasking affecting {{the quality of}} what we do? Is the “multitasking generation” (including that of our students) really better at it than say their professors? How is multitasking affecting students’ culture and expectations in the classroom...|$|R
40|$|How Many Legged Race!? is {{a system}} to support {{communication}} by collaborating on sports. A three-legged race is a popular sport in an athletic festival and participants have to collaborate to run forward. In our system, more than two participants collaborate like that, and instead of running forward, a movie will be played on a screen in front of them, so that <b>they</b> will <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> are traveling around together...|$|R
2500|$|The Guardian {{wrote that}} WikiLeaks, had along with {{individuals}} and groups on the hard right, {{been involved in the}} [...] "ruthless exploitation of [...] death for political purposes". The executive director of the Sunlight Foundation, an organization that advocates for open government, was critical of Wikileaks' fueling of conspiracy theories surrounding the murder of Seth Rich: [...] "On the death of staffer, that’s just to me so far over the line... If <b>they</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> have a link to the staffer's death, they should say it and be responsible about it. The insinuations, to me, are just disgusting." ...|$|E
2500|$|In Japanese hip hop, a {{subculture}} of hip-hoppers {{subscribe to}} the burapan style, and {{are referred to as}} blackfacers. [...] The appearance of these blackfacers is evidence of the popularity of the hip-hop movement in Japan despite what is described as racist tendencies in the culture. Some Japanese fans of hip-hop find it embarrassing and ridiculous that blackface fans do this because <b>they</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> should not change their appearance to embrace the culture. In some instances it {{can be seen as a}} racist act, but for many of the young Japanese fans it is a way of immersing in the hip hop culture the way they see fit. The use of blackface is seen by some as a way to rebel against the culture of surface images in Japan.|$|E
2500|$|Adopted {{children}} also often {{find it hard}} to form comfortable and meaningful relationships. These relationships can be friendly, familial or romantic. Because many adoptees feel that their biological parents left them, they may be afraid to form new relationships in fear that those involved may [...] "leave" [...] them as well. This can lead to holding back and withdrawing from relationships when <b>they</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> are becoming too attached as well as not forming relationships at all. The fear of being left or forgotten is what often holds adoptees back from creating such relationships. Many adoptees feel that they can never truly relate to or trust anybody because their family experiences can be so vastly different from those of people who have not been adopted. It is because of such fears that so many adoptees {{find it hard to}} create relationships in their lives.|$|E

50|$|Victims {{of child}} molestation often {{experience}} their feelings about the incidents later in life when they can fully understand the importance. <b>They</b> often <b>feel</b> that their privacy has been invaded when they {{were too young to}} consent. <b>They</b> can <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> were taken advantage of and betrayed by those that they trusted. Victims {{of child molestation}} can experience long-term psychological traumas. This pushes them to distrust others. The lack of reliance on others can lead to an overall fear of sexual intercourse.|$|R
50|$|Attachment {{is brought}} about when people form an {{emotional}} connection {{between themselves and}} a brand (Malar, Krohmer, Hoyer & Nyffenegger, 2011). For example, Coca-Cola uses advertisements to portray its happy lifestyle to consumers. These advertisements are used to form an emotional connection with the audience. Through {{the use of the}} “Open happiness” slogan, consumers may believe that by purchasing and consuming a Coca-Cola drink, <b>they</b> will <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> are happy and having fun (Malar, Krohmer, Hoyer & Nyffenegger, 2011).|$|R

The tour is made for families since observation points at children's heights are provided, as well as audio guides.To access to the rooms, visitors are invited to take elevators, so that <b>they</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> are going deep inside the ocean.|$|E
30|$|However, in Ethiopia {{incomplete}} routine health information {{and lack of}} data on the proper dietary practice of diabetic patients affect the long term management of diabetes. These diabetic patients are facing difficulty in choosing food items when <b>they</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> eating. <b>They</b> also fail to decide how much to eat whenever necessary. At the same time their care givers also fail to identify food items {{to be included in}} the diabetic meal and how to prepare them. Therefore, this study assesses the level of dietary practice and its associated factors among type 2 diabetic patients in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.|$|R

In February 2017, Allan said, “I am designing the action sequences for the show. We have already shot the opening war sequence. When audiences will watch the sequence on their TV screens, <b>they</b> will <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> are watching a movie. The makers of the show have supported me extensively and have given me the liberty to shoot these action sequences my way.” Contiloe were keen on giving the show a movie-like feel, and hence decided to hire the services of the celebrated stuntman.|$|R
40|$|Management's new {{challenge}} {{is to create a}} work environment that attracts, keeps, and motivates its workforce. This responsibility lies with managers and supervisors {{at all levels of the}} organization. Businesses must step outside their traditional roles and comfort zones to look at new ways of working. They have to create a work environment where people enjoy what <b>they</b> do, <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> have a purpose, have pride in what they do, and can reach their potential.

50|$|Family {{members with}} high {{expressed}} emotion are hostile, very critical and not tolerant of the patient. <b>They</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> are helping by having this attitude. They not only criticize behaviors {{relating to the}} disorder but also other behaviors that are unique to {{the personality of the}} patient. High expressed emotion is more likely to cause a relapse than low expressed emotion.|$|E
5000|$|Middle Children: Feel like outcasts of {{families}} as they lack {{primacy of the}} first child and the [...] "attention garnering recency" [...] of the youngest.

50|$|Jainism {{is against}} {{violence}} to all living beings, including cattle. According to the Jaina sutras, humans must avoid all killing and slaughter because all living beings {{are fond of}} life, <b>they</b> suffer, <b>they</b> <b>feel</b> pain, <b>they</b> <b>like</b> to live, and long to live. All beings should help each other live and prosper, according to Jainism, not kill and slaughter each other.|$|R

5000|$|The Journal of Mind and Behavior {{noted that}} Vakoch’s {{follow-up}} book On Orbit and Beyond: Psychological Perspectives on Human Spaceflight includes several chapters {{that address the}} implications of the increased autonomy that astronauts would have on missions to Mars and Saturn, as compared to orbiting Earth or travelling to the Moon. In an interview Vakoch explained the implications of this increased autonomy: [...] "On missions to Mars, where greater autonomy will be expected of astronauts because of the greater distances, ground personnel should expect that their own roles will change {{over the course of the}} mission. Unless ground personnel are prepared, <b>they</b> may <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> are no longer playing as central a role as they did shortly after liftoff because astronauts are now making more decisions." ...|$|R

5000|$|Kahane {{proposed}} an [...] "exchange of populations" [...] that would continue the Jewish exodus from Arab lands: [...] "A total of some 750,000 Jews fled Arab lands since 1948. Surely {{it is time}} for Jews, worried over the huge growth of Arabs in Israel, to consider finishing the exchange of populations that began 35 (50) years ago." [...] Kahane proposed a $40,000 compensation plan for Arabs who would leave voluntarily, forcible expulsion for those who [...] "don't want to leave", and encouraged retaliatory violence against Arabs who attacked Jews: [...] "I approve of anybody who commits such acts of violence. Really, I don't think that we can sit back and watch Arabs throwing rocks at buses whenever <b>they</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> it. <b>They</b> must understand that a bomb thrown at a Jewish bus is going to mean a bomb thrown at an Arab bus." ...|$|R
50|$|Techniques for {{improving}} perceived performance may include {{more than just}} decreasing the delay between the user's request and visual feedback. Sometimes an increase in delay can {{be perceived as a}} performance improvement, such as when a variable controlled by the user is set to a running average of the users input. This can give the impression of smoother motion, but the controlled variable always reaches the desired value a bit late. Since it smooths out hi-frequency jitter, when the user is attempting to hold the value constant, <b>they</b> may <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> are succeeding more readily. This kind of compromise would be appropriate for control of a sniper rifle in a video game. Another example may be doing trivial computation ahead of time rather than after a user triggers an action, such as pre-sorting a large list of data before a user wants to see it.|$|R

50|$|This is {{the drive}} where users are {{motivated}} because <b>they</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> own or control something. When a person feels ownership over something, they innately {{want to increase}} and improve what they own. Think about our desire to accumulate wealth, or how we value {{the things that are}} in our possession. Often people that sell their house think it is worth much more than the market is willing to pay for it. The fact that they have feelings of ownership of the property makes that they value it more.|$|E
25|$|Since Charles Darwin, the {{willingness}} of some humans to sacrifice themselves for genetically unrelated {{members of the same}} large, diffuse group (such as a religion or a nation) has raised a theoretical challenge. Social psychological perspectives have contended that such sacrifices are motivated by commitment to the larger collective whereas anthropological perspectives have contended that such sacrifices are triggered by commitment to other members of the group. The distinction between local and extended fusion provides an explanation for these apparently competing explanations. Local fusion is proposed to occur in relatively small, homogeneous groups whose members attach to each other through direct personal contact (e.g., families or work teams). In contrast, extended fusion occurs in relatively large groups whose members do not all have personal relationships (e.g., political parties or nation states). In extended fusion, even though fused individuals may not actually know all of their fellow group members, <b>they</b> still <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> know them and even think of them as like family.|$|R
50|$|Consumers {{are always}} looking around for the best {{possible}} deal at the best quality and how these products or services will contribute to their success. The value proposition is the promise that the business will give the consumer to assure best possible value. The value proposition is a creative statement that depicts the unique selling point. Without this statement you lose an opportunity to tell consumers why they should pick you over competitors. An important goal in a business is to convince customers that they are getting many more benefits. Coming from a customer’s perspective, buyers are not only asking how this product is different to one they may already be using, but what value this product or service may have. Customers are looking for answers that may improve or replace products or services. Customers will never buy a product or service if <b>they</b> don’t <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> are receiving the best possible deal. Therefore, the value proposition is important to businesses and their success.|$|R
