25|$|It will {{hardly be}} disputed, I suppose, that the {{department}} of literature in which the Eastern writers stand highest is poetry. And I certainly never met with any orientalist who ventured to maintain that the Arabic and Sanscrit poetry could be compared to that of the great European nations. But when we pass from works of imagination to works in which facts are recorded and general principles investigated, the superiority of the Europeans becomes absolutely immeasurable. It is, I believe, no exaggeration <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> the historical information which has been collected from all the books written in the Sanscrit language is less valuable than what may be found in the most paltry abridgments used at preparatory schools in England. In every branch of physical or moral philosophy, the relative position of the two nations is nearly the same.|$|E

In this debate when asked what Republican he would pick as a running mate if forced, Biden answered, [...] "I would pick Chuck Hagel, and I'd consider asking Dick Lugar {{to be secretary of}} state." [...] In regards to Iraq, Biden stated that it was unrealistic <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> troops would be redeployed.

Biden replied, [...] "I don't like a damn thing about him...only kidding." ...|$|E

2500|$|Mesoamerica as a {{whole is}} {{considered}} a culture area within which a number of cultural sub-areas existed. While all cultures in Mesoamerica share a number of common characteristics, cultural sub-areas are defined by a higher level of specificity in defining elements (i.e., classification of cultural sub-areas is based on more specific criteria than the more broadly defined Mesoamerica). [...] The sub-areas generally correlate with known cultural groups, such as the areas where the Maya, Huastec, and Olmec were found, for example. [...] This is not <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> the peoples in an area share a common ethnicity (indeed, in many cases they do not even share the same language) or lived within or under a single polity. At the same time, based on cultural similarities, it is clear that various kinds of interaction occurred within sub-areas, be them historical relationships, political interaction (e.g., alliances, conflict), and/or economic or commercial agreements. [...] Listed below are the sub-areas found in Mesoamerica.|$|E

2500|$|In 1974, William Dever {{established}} the secular, non-biblical school of Syro-Palestinian archaeology and mounted {{a series of}} attacks on {{the very definition of}} biblical archaeology. Dever argued that the name of such inquiry should be changed to [...] "archaeology of the Bible" [...] or [...] "archaeology of the Biblical period" [...] to delineate the narrow temporal focus of Biblical archaeologists. Frank Moore Cross, who had studied under Albright and had taught Dever, emphasized that in Albright's view, biblical archaeology was not synonymous with Palestinian archaeology, but rather that, [...] "William Foxwell Albright regarded Palestinian archaeology or Levantine archaeology as a small, if important section of biblical archaeology. One finds it ironical that recent students suppose them interchangeable terms." [...] Dever agreed that the terms were not interchangeable, but claimed that [...] "'Syro-Palestinian archaeology' {{is not the same as}} the 'biblical archaeology'.

Two months later, The Verge reported, [...] "in the midst of rampant piracy on top of Measure B, many studios have relocated to Las Vegas, where filmmaking is cheaper and regulations are more lax." [...] Then in September 2014, Robert Lang, director of Brookings Mountain West (a collaboration of UNLV and the Brookings Institution to study issues facing the Intermountain West region), was quoted as saying, [...] "Some big part of it will stay (in LA) and production companies will continue to be based there, so it’s not accurate <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> of that $6 billion translates to Southern Nevada. But what it also gives to Las Vegas is that it’s building technical capacity that undergirds non-pornographic production and media. It adds some competitive advantage in scale to Los Angeles." ...|$|E
2500|$|Blue Horse {{invariably}} dined with Burbank at {{noon and}} {{always had a}} good appetite. One day, after dinner, Burbank said to Blue Horse: [...] "I notice that you always eat everything in front of you, but you never pass your plate back the second time or ask for another cup of coffee. Why is that? Is it because you cannot eat any more or drink any more coffee. O, yes, he replied, I could eat more, but I thought the twenty-five cents you paid for my dinner was for just what was placed before me. No, I said, the twenty-five cents pays for all you can eat. Hereafter, if one plate is not enough, ask for more, and drink all the coffee you want. All right, he replied, I will. And he did. I also told him to tell his friends this, and suggested that if any white men sitting at his table left anything to eat on their plates before them, {{that it would be}} all right for him to gather it up and take it home for his wife and children. It is needless <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> the Sioux Indians who patronized that hotel afterward got all that was coming to them.” One time Blue Horse was in the Indian trader's store with his little niece, who saw something on the shelves that she very much wanted. Blue Horse had no money, so he took off his old moccasins and gave them to the Indian trader in exchange for what the little girl craved and he walked home barefooted.|$|E

2500|$|In 1933, Hitchcock {{was once}} again working for Michael Balcon at Gaumont British. His first film for the company The Man Who Knew Too Much (1934) was a success and his second The 39 Steps (1935) is often {{considered}} one of the best films from his early period, with the British Film Institute ranking it the fourth best British film of the 20th century. The film was acclaimed in the UK, and it made Hitchcock a star in the US, and established the quintessential English [...] "Hitchcock blonde" [...] Madeleine Carroll as the template for his succession of ice cold and elegant leading ladies. Screenwriter Robert Towne remarked, [...] "It’s not much of an exaggeration <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> contemporary escapist entertainment begins with The 39 Steps." [...] This film {{was one of the first}} to exploit a [...] "MacGuffin", a rather peripheral driver of the narrative. In The 39 Steps, the MacGuffin is a stolen set of design plans. In 1966, Hitchcock explained to French director François Truffaut: might be a Scottish name, taken from a story about two men in a train. One man says, [...] "What's that package up there in the baggage rack?" [...] And the other answers, [...] "Oh, that's a Macguffin." [...] The first man asks, [...] "What's a Macguffin?" [...] "Well," [...] the other man says, [...] "It's an apparatus for trapping lions in the Scottish Highlands." [...] The first man says, [...] "But there are no lions in the Scottish Highlands, and the other one answers, [...] "Well then, that's no Macguffin!" [...] So you see that a Macguffin is actually nothing at all.|$|E
2500|$|Throughout {{his stay}} in Brazil, John formalized the {{creation}} of a huge number of institutions and public services and boosted the economy, culture and other areas of national life. All these measures were taken principally because of the practical needs of administering a large empire in a territory previously lacking of these resources, because the predominant idea continued to be that Brazil would remain a colony, given that it was expected that the court would return to its old metropolis once the European political situation returned to normal. However, these advances became the basis for Brazil's future autonomy. This is not <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> was amenities and progress. A series of political crises began shortly after his arrival with the invasion of Cayenne in [...] French Guiana in 1809 in retaliation for the French invasion of Portugal, serious economic problems, and a painful trade agreement imposed in 1810 by the British, which in practice flooded the small internal market with useless trinkets and disadvantaged exports and {{the creation of}} new national industries. The national debt multiplied by twenty and corruption was rife at large institutions, including the first Bank of Brazil, which ended up bankrupt. Also, the court was extravagant and wasteful, accumulated privileges on privileges and maintained a legion of sycophants and adventurers. British consul James Henderson observed that few European courts were as large as that of Portugal. Laurentino Gomes writes that John granted more hereditary titles in his first eight years in Brazil than had been granted in the previous three hundred years of the Portuguese monarchy, not even counting more than five thousand insignia and commendations of the honorific orders of Portugal.|$|E
