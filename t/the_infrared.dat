30|$|In general, {{compare to}} <b>the</b> {{broadband}} <b>infrared</b> technology, <b>the</b> narrow <b>infrared</b> band has <b>the</b> higher signal-to-noise ratio and easier traceability for infrared target detection, discernment, and tracking application.|$|R

5|$|The {{absorption}} band of simple cations shift toward shorter wavelength {{when they are}} involved in more covalent interactions.

5|$|The {{application}} of Blender was supplemented {{by use of}} the IRAC instrument on the Spitzer Space Telescope, which was used on August 30 and November 15, 2010, to further define Kepler-10's light curve {{at the point where}} KOI 072.02 appeared to transit it. It was found that the transiting object did not produce a color, an aspect that is characteristic of stars. This suggested even further that KOI 072.02 was a planet. In addition, the IRAC instrument found no difference in the transit signal when comparing the star's light curve in <b>the</b> <b>infrared</b> and in visible light; stars that are aligned with Kepler-10 might appear visibly similar, but would appear different in <b>the</b> <b>infrared.</b>|$|E
5|$|According to {{a summary}} of the research, {{atmospheric}} water absorption in such an exoplanet renders it larger in appearance across one part of <b>the</b> <b>infrared</b> spectrum, compared to wavelengths in the visible spectrum.

5|$|Altair rotates rapidly, with a {{velocity}} at {{the equator}} of approximately 286km/s. This {{is a significant}} fraction of the star's estimated breakup speed of 400km/s. A study with the Palomar Testbed Interferometer revealed that Altair is not spherical, but is flattened at the poles due to its high rate of rotation.

5|$|Currently, {{ytterbium}} {{is being}} investigated as a possible replacement for magnesium in high density pyrotechnic payloads for kinematic infrared decoy flares. As ytterbium(III) oxide has a significantly higher emissivity in <b>the</b> <b>infrared</b> range than magnesium oxide, a higher radiant intensity is obtained with ytterbium-based payloads in comparison to those commonly based on magnesium/Teflon/Viton (MTV).|$|E
5|$|Dust {{particles}} tend {{to stick}} {{to each other in}} the dense disk environment, leading to the formation of larger particles up to several centimeters in size. The signatures of the dust processing and coagulation are observed in <b>the</b> <b>infrared</b> spectra of the young disks. Further aggregation can lead to the formation of planetesimals measuring 1km across or larger, which are the building blocks of planets. Planetesimal formation is another unsolved problem of disk physics, as simple sticking becomes ineffective as dust particles grow larger.|$|E

5|$|Having {{discovered}} the planet, the astronomers worked {{to discover a}} transit event using <b>the</b> <b>Infrared</b> Array Camera of the Spitzer Space Telescope, as ground-based observations could prove difficult if Gliese 3634 b was a rocky planet.
