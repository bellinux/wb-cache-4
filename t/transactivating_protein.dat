40|$|Objectives This review {{discusses}} {{the latest developments}} in G protein coupled receptor (GPCR) signalling related to the transactivation of cell surface protein kinase receptors and the therapeutic implications. Key findings Multiple GPCRs have been known to <b>transactivate</b> <b>protein</b> tyrosine kinase receptors for almost two decades. More recently it has been discovered that GPCRs can also <b>transactivate</b> <b>protein</b> serine/threonine kinase receptors such as that for transforming growth factor (TGF) -. Using the model of proteoglycan synthesis and glycosaminoglycan elongation in human vascular smooth muscle cells which is a component of an in vitro model of atherosclerosis, the dual tyrosine and serine/threonine kinase receptor transactivation pathways appear to account for all of the response to the agonists, endothelin and thrombin. Summary The broadening of the paradigm of GPCR receptor transactivation explains the broad range of activities of these receptors and also the efficacy of GPCR antagonists in cardiovascular therapeutics. Deciphering the mechanisms of transactivation with the aim of identifying a common therapeutic target remains the next challenge...|$|R
40|$|Signal-transduction {{pathways}} converge ultimately at {{the level}} of transcriptional activation to produce specific patterns of gene expression in response to environmental stimuli. The initiation of transcription mediated by these signaling pathways is regulated by the coordinate expression and/or activation of specific transcription factors that bind to the control regions of genes. Specific insights into the mechanisms underlying transcriptional activation have recently arisen from studies of the structure and functions of these transcription factors. The CREB/ATF family of transcriptional <b>transactivating</b> <b>proteins</b> has only recently been discovered and appears to provide a link between the regulation of gene expression in response to activators of cellular signaling pathways and the regulation of gene expression by viral <b>transactivating</b> <b>proteins.</b> In addition, these proteins may be involved in the normal regulation of growth and differentiation.

However, the mechanism of Nef-induced activation of viral replication remains to be clearly understood. Using transient transfection assay, co-immunoprecipitation and pull-down analysis, we demonstrate in this report that the HIV- 1 Nef protein physically interacts with Tat, the principal <b>transactivating</b> <b>protein</b> of HIV- 1. Our observations with single cycle replication experiments further indicate that this interaction results not only in enhancement of Tat-induced HIV- 1 long terminal repeat-mediated gene expression but also in virus production...|$|E
40|$|AbstractNF-κB, a key {{regulator}} of {{the cellular}} inflammatory and immune response, is activated by the HTLV-I transforming and <b>transactivating</b> <b>protein</b> Tax. We show that Tax binds to the amino terminus of the protein kinase MEKK 1, {{a component of}} an IκB kinase complex, and stimulates MEKK 1 kinase activity. Tax expression increases the activity of IκB kinase β (IKKβ) to enhance phosphorylation of serine residues in IκBα that lead to its degradation. Dominant negative mutants of both IKKβ and MEKK 1 prevent Tax activation of the NF-κB pathway. Furthermore, recombinant MEKK 1 stimulates IKKβ phosphorylation of IκBα. Thus, Tax-mediated increases in NF-κB nuclear translocation result from direct interactions of Tax and MEKK 1 leading to enhanced IKKβ phosphorylation of IκBα...|$|E

Several laboratories have shown that LAT accumulates in the nucleus and is not polyadenylylated. Recently, we showed that the promoter for LAT lies 688 bases upstream from its 5 ' end.

To date, there has been no focus on the ability of biased agonists to activate the PTKR and PS/TKR transactivation pathways differentially.

The biological function of HBVDNAPTP 1 was investigated in this study. We constructed a vector pcDNA 3. 1 (-) /myc-His A-HBVDNAPTP 1 {{and used it to}} transfect acute monocytic leukemia cell line THP- 1. HBVDNAPTP 1 expression was detected by western blot analysis in the cells. A cDNA library of genes transactivated by HBVDNAPTP 1 in THP- 1 cells was made in pGEM-T Easy using suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH). The cDNAs were sequenced and analyzed with BLAST search against the sequences in GenBank. Some sequences, such as CIP 4, might be involved in apoptosis development. mRNA and protein expression of CIP 4 was identified by Real time RT-PCR and western blot in THP- 1 cells. HBVDNAPTP 1 could down-regulate the expression of CIP 4 at both transcription and translation levels. HBVDNAPTP 1 may be involved in the positive regulation on the initiation of monocyte apoptosis.

40|$|Low {{level and}} {{variable}} transgene expression plague efforts {{to produce and}} characterize transgenic lines in many species. When transformation efficiency is high, productive transgenic lines can be generated with reasonable effort. However, most efforts to date in mosquitoes have resulted in suboptimal levels of transformation. This, coupled with the large space and intensive labor requirements of mosquito colony maintenance makes the optimization of transformation in mosquitoes a research priority. This study proposes two strategies for improving transgene expression and transformation efficiency. The first is to explore exogenous promoter/enhancer combinations to direct expression of either the transgene itself, or the transposase required for insertion of the transgene into the genome. An extension of this strategy is to investigate {{the use of a}} powerful viral <b>transactivating</b> <b>protein</b> and its cognate enhancer to further increase expression of these targets. The second strategy involves the identification of an endogenous boundary element for use in insulating transgenes and their associated regulatory elements. This would mitigate the inappropriate expression or silencing of many transgenes inserted into ??????unfavorable?????? genomic environments as a consequence of an inability to specifically target the integration of transposons currently used in mosquito transgenesis. The IE 1 <b>transactivating</b> <b>protein</b> and its cognate enhancer from a baculovirus were shown to significantly increase expression of a reporter gene from three different promoters in cultured mosquito cells. Other heterologous enhancer/promoter combinations resulted in minimal increases or insignificant changes in expression. Orthologues of the vertebrate insulator-binding factor, CTCF, were cloned and characterized in two mosquito species, Aedes aegypti and Anopheles gambiae. The expression profile of mosquito CTCF is consistent with its role as a putative insulatorbinding protein. Preliminary binding site studies reveal a C/G-rich binding site consistent with that known in vertebrates and indicate that CTCF may bind widespread sites within mosquito genomes...|$|E

Dot blot analysis of viral DNA synthesis and viral RNA transcription indicated that the inhibition occurred at an early step in infection. A study of the early events after herpes simplex virus type 1 infection indicated that adsorption, penetration, uncoating, and transport of viral DNA were not affected by interferon. Northern (RNA) blot analysis revealed that both immediate-early and delayed-early gene transcription was inhibited by interferon. Transactivation of the immediate-early responsive element linked to a reporter gene (CAT or tk) was specifically inhibited by both classes of interferon. Our data would indicate that either the <b>transactivating</b> <b>protein</b> VP 16 or the complex formed between VP 16 and a host protein(s) is attenuated by interferon...|$|E
40|$|We provide {{evidence}} for a novel mechanism of transcriptional regulation in which the immediate-early (IE) <b>transactivating</b> <b>protein</b> of herpes simplex virus, Vmw 65, is assembled into a specific DNA-binding complex together with a cellular octamer-binding factor (TRF). The assembly of Vmw 65 /TRF complex requires not only the core TRF recognition site, but also flanking sequences which are dispensable for TRF binding alone. We show from functional analyses that TRF binding by a motif is required but not sufficient to confer induction on a heterologous promoter, {{and it is the}} ability of the motif to allow TRF/Vmw 65 complex assembly which correlates with functional activity. Thus, for the induction of HSV IE expression, Vmw 65 forms a complex with TRF by recognition of the specific subset of appropriately flanked TRF binding sites present in each of the IE genes. This mechanism may provide a paradigm for the selective utilization of the same transcription factor in differential gene expression...|$|E
40|$|Zinc finger-containing GLI {{proteins}} {{are involved}} in the development of Caenorhabditis elegans, Xenopus, Drosophila, zebrafish, mice, and humans. In this study, we show that an isoform of human GLI- 2 strongly synergizes with the Tat <b>transactivating</b> <b>proteins</b> of human immunodeficiency virus types 1 and 2 (HIV- 1 and - 2) and markedly stimulates viral replication. GLI- 2 also synergizes with the previously described Tat cofactor cyclin T 1 to stimulate Tat function. Surprisingly, GLI- 2 /Tat synergy is not dependent on either a typical GLI DNA binding site or an intact Tat activation response element but does require an intact TATA box. Thus, GLI- 2 /Tat synergy results from a mechanism of action which is novel both for a GLI protein and for a Tat cofactor. These findings link the GLI family of transcriptional and developmental regulatory proteins to Tat function and HIV replication...|$|R
40|$|G protein coupled {{receptor}} (GPCR) signalling covers {{three major}} mechanisms. GPCR agonist engagement {{allows for the}} G proteins to bind to the receptor leading to a classical downstream signalling cascade. The second mechanism is via the utilization of the β-arrestin signalling molecule and thirdly via transactivation dependent signalling. GPCRs can <b>transactivate</b> <b>protein</b> tyrosine kinase receptors (PTKR) to activate respective downstream signalling intermediates. In the past decade GPCR transactivation dependent signalling was expanded to show transactivation of serine/threonine kinase receptors (S/TKR). Kinase receptor transactivation enormously broadens the GPCR signalling paradigm. This work utilizes next generation RNA-sequencing to study the contribution of transactivation dependent signalling to total protease activated receptor (PAR) - 1 signalling. Transactivation, assessed as gene expression, accounted for 50 {{percent of the total}} genes regulated by thrombin acting through PAR- 1 in human coronary artery smooth muscle cells. GPCR transactivation of PTKRs is approximately equally important as the transactivation of the S/TKR with 209 and 177 genes regulated respectively, via either signalling pathway. This work shows that genome wide studies can provide powerful insights into GPCR mediated signalling pathways...|$|R
40|$|G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} targets for therapeutics due to their abundance and diversity. The G protein-coupled receptor for thrombin can <b>transactivate</b> <b>protein</b> tyrosine kinase receptors (PTKR) and we have recently established that it can also transactivate serine/threonine kinase receptors (S/TKR). A comprehensive knowledge of the signalling pathways that GPCR transactivation elicits is necessary to fully understand the implications of both GPCR activation and the impact of target drugs. Here, we demonstrate that thrombin elicits dual transactivation-dependent signalling pathways to stimulate mRNA expression of glycosaminoglycan synthesizing enzymes chondroitin 4 -O-sulfotransferase 1 and chondroitin sulfate synthase 1. The PTKR mediated response involves matrix metalloproteinases and the phosphorylation of the MAP kinase Erk. The S/TKR mediated response differs markedly and involves the phosphorylation of Smad 2 carboxy terminal serine residues and does not involve matrix metalloproteinases. This work shows that all of the thrombin mediated signalling to glycosaminoglycan synthesizing enzyme gene expression occurs via transactivation-dependent pathways and does not involve transactivation-independent signalling. These findings highlight the complexity of thrombin-mediated transactivation signalling and the broader implications of GPCR targeted therapeutics...|$|R
40|$|AbstractSince the pseudorabies virus (PRV) genome encodes for {{a single}} immediate-early protein, IE 180, we {{reasoned}} that this strong <b>transactivating</b> <b>protein</b> could represent a key regulatory switch that could be genetically manipulated in order to alter its tropism towards cancer cells. We therefore initiated studies to test whether the human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) tumor promoters could functionally replace the IE 180 promoter. We show that both promoters can functionally substitute the IE 180 promoter in plasmid constructs and recombinant viruses, and observed that IE 180 differentially auto-regulated each promoter tested, with PRV IE 180 negatively regulating the hTERT promoter but positively hyper-activating the CEA promoter. Interestingly, we also observed that the recombinant PRV-TER and PRV-CEA viruses preferentially replicated in diverse cancer cell lines compared to control non-cancer cells, and the PRV-CEA was capable of additionally inducing a profound apoptotic phenotype which we correlated to the overexpression of IE 180...|$|E

In this review the functions of HIV- 1 Tat that have been well documented, {{as well as a number}} of novel functions that have been proposed for this protein, are discussed. Since some of the functions of Tat vary in different cell types in a concentrationdependent manner and because Tat sometimes exerts the same activity through different pathways, study of this protein has at times yielded conflicting and controversial results.

40|$|Akt/protein kinase B is {{a pivotal}} {{component}} downstream of phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase (PI 3 K) pathway, whose activity regulates {{the balance between}} cell survival and apoptosis. Phosphorylation of Akt occurs at two key sites either at Thr 308 site in the activation loop or at Ser 473 site in the hydrophobic motif. The phosphorylated form of Akt (pAkt) is activated to promote cell survival. The mechanisms of pAkt dephosphorylation and how the signal transduction of Akt pathway is terminated are still largely unknown. In this study, we identified a novel protein phosphatase CSTP 1 (complete s <b>transactivated</b> <b>protein</b> 1), which interacts and dephosphorylates Akt specifically at Ser 473 site in vivo and in vitro, blocks cell cycle progression and promotes cell apoptosis. The effects of CSTP 1 on cell survival and cell cycle were abrogated by depletion of phosphatase domain of CSTP 1 or by expression of a constitutively active form of Akt (S 473 D), suggesting Ser 473 site of Akt as a primary cellular target of CSTP 1. Expression profile analysis showed that CSTP 1 expression is selectively down-regulated in non-invasive bladder cancer tissues and over-expression of CSTP 1 suppressed the size of tumors in nude mice.

40|$|Tat, {{the human}} {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 (HIV- 1) <b>transactivating</b> <b>protein,</b> binds through its RGD-motif to human integrin receptors. Candida albicans, the commonest cause of mucosal candidiasis in subjects infected with HIV- 1, also possesses RGD-binding capacity. The present study reveals that Tat binds to C. albicans but not to C. tropicalis. Tat binding was markedly reduced by laminin {{and to a lesser}} extent by a complement C 3 peptide containing the RGD motif, but not by a control peptide. The outgrowth of C. albicans was accelerated following binding of Tat, but phagocytosis of opsonized C. albicans was also increased after Tat binding. Thus, Tat binding promotes fungal virulence by inducing hyphae but may also reduce it by augmenting phagocytosis. The net effect of Tat in vivo is difficult to judge but in view of the many disease-promoting effects of Tat we propose that accelerating the formation of hyphae dominates over the augmentation of phagocytosis...|$|E

HTLV- 1 Tax is a pleiotropic <b>transactivating</b> <b>protein</b> known to be critical in immune activation detected in HAM/TSP [71]. It is also highly immunogenic, which results in a strong Tax-specific immune response [72 – 74].

These observations have supported the hypothesis that these antigen-specific responses are associated with the neuropathogenesis of HAM/TSP, and therefore may be reasonable targets for immune interventions that either directly target the effector CTL or the antigen that stimulates this response. Activated T cells are a hallmark of HAM/TSP, but within the CNS there is a paucity of HTLV- 1 infected cells, and even if present, have been postulated to be nonproductively infected [9].|$|E

HiNF-P interacts with the global histone gene regulator and direct cyclin E/CDK 2 substrate p 220 (NPAT) to potently upregulate histone H 4 gene transcription at the G 1 /S phase transition in response to cyclin E/CDK 2 signaling. To gain insight into the function of HiNF-P in a broader cellular context, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen to identify its novel interacting proteins. In this study, we detected 67 candidate HiNF-P interacting proteins of varying cellular functions. We have identified multiple RNA associated proteins, including the splicing co-factor SRm 300. HiNF-P and SRm 300 interact in yeast two-hybrid, co-immunoprecipitation, and co-immunofluorescence assays. Our screen also identified several gene regulators that associate with HiNF-P including THAP 7. HiNF-P and THAP 7 interact in mammalian cells and THAP 7 abrogates HiNF-P/p 220 mediated activation of histone H 4 gene transcription, consistent with its known role as a transcriptional repressor. Finally, we identified several proliferation related proteins including Ki- 67 and X <b>transactivated</b> <b>protein</b> 2 (XTP 2) which may be functioning with HiNF-P in cell cycle regulation.

A cysteine residue {{in the center of}} the E 2 DNA recognition helix is highly conserved among papillomavirus E 2 proteins. Mutations of this cysteine in bovine papillomavirus type 1 E 2 to serine and glycine resulted in proteins which failed to activate E 2 -dependent promoters in mammalian cells. These E 2 mutants were DNA-binding competent, dimeric, and nuclear. When fused to the VP 16 transactivation domain, C-terminal regions of E 2 containing the mutations at 340 supported transcriptional activation, indicating that the heterologoustrans-activation domain did not require cysteine in the DNA-binding helix as did the full-length E 2 <b>transactivating</b> <b>protein.</b> Although cysteine- 340 was required for transcriptional activation it was not required for DNA replicationin vivo.

In this study we show that MHBst like the HBx protein of HBV, can cause nuclear appearance of NF-kappa B DNA binding activity and induce various kappa B-controlled reporter genes. While an inhibitor of protein kinase C could not block gene induction by MHBst, the antioxidants N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) and pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC) could potently suppress transactivation at mM and microM concentrations, respectively. Also, kappa B-dependent gene induction by the transactivator HBx was blocked. The effects were selective because PDTC did not interfere with MHBst and HBx-induced activation of the c-fos promoter/enhancer, nor with the basal activity of several other reporter genes lacking functional NF-kappa B binding motifs. Our data suggest that induction of a prooxidant state is crucial for the activation of NF-kappa B by MHBst and HBx and might be related to the hepatocarcinogenic potential of the viral proteins. MHBst had a subcellular localization unusual for a viral transactivator: it appeared to be an integral membrane protein of the endoplasmic reticulum...|$|E

To {{gain insight into}} the processes that govern tumor onset and progression, we have examined the impact of BLV-Tax expression on ovine B-cells, the targets of BLV in experimentally infected sheep, using B-cell clones that are dependent on CD 154 and gammac-common cytokines. Tax was capable of mediating progression of B-cells from cytokine dependence to cytokine independence, indicating that the transactivator can over-ride signaling pathways typically controlled by cytokine receptor activation in B-cells. When examined {{in the presence of}} both CD 154 and interleukin- 4, Tax had a clear supportive role on B-cell growth, with an impact on B-cell proliferation, cell cycle phase distribution, and survival. Apoptotic B-cell death mediated by growth factor withdrawal, physical insult, and NF-kappaB inhibition was dramatically reduced in the presence of Tax. Furthermore, the expression of Tax was {{associated with}} higher Bcl- 2 protein levels, providing rationale for the rescue signals mediated by the transactivator. Finally, Tax expression in B-cells led to a dramatic increase of nuclear RelB/p 50 and p 50 /p 50 NF-kappaB dimers, indicating that cellular signaling through NF-kappaB is a major contributory mechanism in the disruption of B-cell homeostasis. Although Tax is involved in aspects of pathogenesis that are unique to complex retroviruses, the viral strategies associated with this transactivating oncoprotein may have wide-ranging effects that are relevant to other B-cell malignancies.

Is this difference {{due to their}} <b>transactivating</b> Tax <b>proteins,</b> Tax- 1 and Tax- 2, which are responsible for viral and cellular gene activation? Do Tax- 1 and Tax- 2 differ in their cellular localization and in their interaction pattern with cellular factors? In this review, we summarize Tax- 1 and Tax- 2 structural and phenotypic properties, their interaction with factors involved in signal transduction and their localization-related behavior within the cell. Special attention {{will be given to}} the distinctions between Tax- 1 and Tax- 2 that likely {{play an important role in}} their transactivation activity...|$|R
