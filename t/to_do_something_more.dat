25|$|The {{band played}} a second show in Gothenburg. Döring and Dimeo had quit the band {{since the first}} show, so Opeth {{contacted}} {{two members of the}} band Crimson Cat, Kim Pettersson and Johan DeFarfalla, and asked them to join them onstage. Other bands playing the show were At the Gates, Therion, Desecrator, Megaslaughter and Sarcazm. After the show, De Farfalla left Opeth to spend time with his girlfriend. He was replaced by Åkerfeldt's friend Peter Lindgren, who was playing in a joke band called Sylt i krysset. He accepted the offer to play bass in Opeth because he wanted <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>more</b> serious. Pettersson later left the band, and Lindgren switched to guitar. Isberg quit in 1992, due to creative differences. Åkerfeldt became the new vocalist. He and Lindgren started writing material immediately. They rehearsed as a 3-piece for more than a year. Stefan Guteklint joined on bass, but left soon after the band signed its first record deal with Candlelight Records, in 1994.|$|E

[...] During a Q session in January 2009, Chabon added that he was writing a [...] "naturalistic" [...] novel about two families in Berkeley.

When Chandler asked journalist Keith Altham for advice, Altham suggested that they needed <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>more</b> dramatic than the stage show of the Who, which involved the smashing of instruments. Hendrix joked: [...] "Maybe I can smash up an elephant", to which Altham replied: [...] "Well, it's a pity you can't set fire to your guitar". Chandler then asked road manager Gerry Stickells to procure some lighter fluid. During the show, Hendrix gave an especially dynamic performance before setting his guitar on fire {{at the end of a}} 45-minute set. In the wake of the stunt, members of London's press labeled Hendrix the [...] "Black Elvis" [...] and the [...] "Wild Man of Borneo".|$|E
500|$|The In Rainbows artwork was {{designed}} by Stanley Donwood, {{who has worked with}} Yorke to design Radiohead's album art since 1994. Donwood worked in the studio as Radiohead were working on the album, which allowed the mood of the music to be conveyed in the album artwork, and regularly put up images in the studio and on the studio computer for the band to interact with and comment on. He also posted images daily on the Radiohead website, though none were used in the final album artwork. Donwood experimented with photographic etching, putting prints into acid baths and throwing wax at paper, creating images influenced by NASA space photography. He originally planned to explore suburban life, but realised it did not fit the album, saying [...] "it's a sensual record and I wanted <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>more</b> organic." [...] Describing the album cover, Donwood said: [...] "It's very colourful—I've finally embraced colour! It's a rainbow but it is very toxic, it's more like the sort of one you'd see in a puddle." [...] The band decided not to release the cover for the digital release, preferring to hold it back for the physical release. The [...] "discbox" [...] release of the album includes a booklet containing additional artwork by Donwood.|$|E

500|$|Will Eisner {{was born}} in New York in 1917 to poor Jewish immigrants. [...] He has said he wanted {{a career in the}} arts, but that poor Jews at the time were {{restricted}} from upper-class universities where he could study it. [...] Like others of his generation, he turned to comics as an artistic outlet, a career he began in 1936. [...] In the late 1930s he co-owned a studio which produced content for comic books; he left the studio in 1940 to produce his best-known creation, the formally inventive The Spirit, which ran as a newspaper insert from 1940 to 1952. [...] After its end, Eisner withdrew from the comic book world and focused on the American Visuals Corporation, which he had founded in 1948 to produce educational and commercial comics and related media. [...] With the rise of comics fandom in the 1970s, Eisner found there was still interest in his decades-old Spirit comics, and that the fans wanted more work from him. [...] After American Visuals went out of business in 1972, Eisner entered a deal with underground comix publisher [...] to reprint old Spirit stories. [...] Other reprints followed, but Eisner was unwilling to do new Spirit stories—instead, he wanted <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>more</b> serious, inspired in part by the wordless novels of Lynd Ward he first read in 1938, and similar work by the Flemish Frans Masereel and the German Otto Nückel.|$|E
500|$|... "Duets" [...] was {{generally}} well received by critics, {{many of whom}} contrasted it favorably with the preceding season two episodes. The New York Times Rebecca Milzoff called it {{the best of the}} season to that point [...] "in terms of old-school Glee", and indeed, both Lisa Respers France of CNN and Jarett Wieselman of the New York Post found it a reminder of why they originally loved the show. Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal summarized: [...] "This was a return to that honeymoon feeling, when Glee first surprised, scandalized and satisfied you." [...] TV Guide Damian Holbrook and the Houston Chronicle Bobby Hankinson appreciated the lack of gimmicks; the former explained [...] "No Britney numbers. No forced guest stars. No reasons to check out. It's amazing how satisfying a show can be when the characters we invested in a year ago get <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>more</b> than set-dress a stunt." [...] James Poniewozik of Time labelled it [...] "easily the strongest character episode so far this season". While The Atlantic Kevin Fallon opined that the series finally achieved the correct [...] "tonal balance of comedy and drama", his colleague Meghan Brown provided one of few dissenting reviews; she called it a lazy, nonsensical episode which contributed to a building [...] "sophomore slump". MTV's Aly Semigran found it lackluster after [...] "Grilled Cheesus", and although Anthony Benigno of the Daily News deemed it an improvement on the previous episode, he concluded that it was not one of the season's best.|$|E

40|$|Since {{the late}} 1950 s, {{the share of}} the world’s {{population}} suffering from hunger and undernutrition has dropped from about one-third to one-seventh. Successes in agricultural development contributed substantially to these gains by feeding billions of people—by increasing food supplies, reducing food prices, and creating new income and employment opportunities for the rural poor. Progress has slowed, however, and efforts to meet future food needs are continually challenged by factors such as climate change, environmental degradation, and population growth. By drawing on lessons from the past, we can once again put agriculture to work in ending hunger and undernutrition.

2500|$|The {{simplest}} airbrushes {{work with}} a single-action mechanism where the depression of the trigger actuates air flow through the airbrush. [...] The airbrush's color flow and spray pattern are adjusted separately from the trigger action. [...] This is done through an adjustment of the airbrush's needle placement within its paint tip, by the turning of the paint tip on an external mix airbrush (Badger 350 or Paasche Model H are good examples of single-action external mix airbrushes) or the turning of a needle setting dial on an internal mix airbrush (Badger 200 or Iwata SAR are good examples of single-action internal mix airbrushes). [...] The color volume and spray pattern are maintained at a fixed level until the airbrush user re-adjust the setting. Single-action airbrushes are simpler to use and generally less expensive, but they present limitations in applications in which the user wishes <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>more</b> artistic than simply apply a good, uniform coat of color.|$|E
