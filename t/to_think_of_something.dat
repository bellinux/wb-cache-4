60|$|That seemed reasonable, so Tip tried <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>something</b> else.|$|E
60|$|MARGARET (taking her hand). Yes, wait a bit, we {{are sure}} <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>something.</b> Daddy, think of something.|$|E
60|$|Kemp tried <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>something</b> to {{keep the}} talk going, but the Invisible Man resumed of his own accord.|$|E
6000|$|... 'It DOES seem funny. But I suppose, if {{you come}} <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> it, <b>something</b> <b>of</b> the same kind must have {{happened}} {{to one or two}} people before.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, be practical!' cried Merton. 'Be inventive! Be modern! Be up <b>to</b> date! <b>Think</b> <b>of</b> <b>something</b> new! <b>Think</b> <b>of</b> a felt want, as the Covenanting divine calls it: a real public need, {{hitherto}} but dimly present, {{and quite}} a demand without a supply.' ...|$|R
60|$|His {{eyes were}} remarkably small, but marvellously bright and piercing; {{so much so}} that when he turned them again upon me I tried <b>to</b> <b>think</b> quickly <b>of</b> <b>something</b> nice about him, feeling sure that he could see right into me.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am endeavoring <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>something</b> novel," [...] {{replied the}} dwarf, abstractedly, {{for he was}} quite bewildered by the wine.|$|E
60|$|I {{thought of}} Horatius on the bridge, of Hector before the walls. I always {{make it a}} point <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>something</b> {{classical}} at such times.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Tell {{me about}} St Austin's, Mr MacArthur,' said Miss Beezley, as the Babe was trying <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>something</b> to say--not about the weather. 'Do you play football?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Really, I almost {{wish that}} you were a soldier, too," [...] she declared. [...] "Your work seems to me so horribly gruesome. Come along, you know you are going to take me <b>to</b> dinner. <b>Think</b> <b>of</b> <b>something</b> nice <b>to</b> say. I really want to be amused." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's very pretty! How many {{nice things}} you can do, and how kind you are <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> my liking <b>something</b> new. Was this wax what you went to get this morning when you rode away so early?" [...] asked the child.|$|R
6000|$|... "We like <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> {{religion}} as <b>something</b> safely specialized, codified, and put away. Then {{we can learn}} the rules and kick about a bit. But when some one comes along saying that science is religion, literature is religion, business--they'll come to that presently!--business is religion!...|$|R
6000|$|... "There, there, try <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>something</b> else, that's a good dear!" [...] {{returned}} the neighbor, sympathetically. [...] "It won't {{do any good}} to brood over the matter." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{stood looking}} at the girl, and trying in vain <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>something</b> to say. Miss Hartley, with {{somewhat}} more colour than usual, gave him a little bow and hurried off.|$|E
6000|$|... "We always send {{presents}} {{to all our}} cousins," [...] said Frank hesitatingly. [...] "That's a bore, too. They've all got so many things already it's no end of bother <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>something</b> new." ...|$|E
40|$|We {{are used}} to {{receiving}} messages about government debt. Indeed it is common practice for commentators to talk or write of a country's public debt as that country's debt or national debt. Further, we are virtually pre-programmed <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> debt as <b>something</b> bad, something undesirable, even sinful (Atwood 2008) ...|$|R
50|$|And notice {{also the}} {{exquisite}} self-pity - the 'nobody loves me' feeling:....Hard Cheese, old chap! Such poems {{might have been}} written expressly for adolescents.. And the unvarying sexual pessimism (the girl always dies or marries someone else) seemed like wisdom to boys who were herded together in public-schools and were half-inclined <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> women as <b>something</b> unattainable.|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{to such a}} very dismal goal, {{according}} to your theory," [...] grumbled the Old Maid. [...] "I should hate to feel myself an insect in a hive, my little round of duties apportioned to me, my every action regulated by a fixed law, my place assigned to me, my very food and drink, I suppose, apportioned <b>to</b> me. Do <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>something</b> more cheerful." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Wrenn sat trying <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>something</b> else to say. Lonely {{people in}} city {{restaurants}} {{simply do not}} get acquainted. Yet he did manage to observe, [...] "Great building that'll be," [...] in the friendliest manner.|$|E
60|$|He {{began again}} {{to walk up}} and down, prey to an {{agitation}} that was frightful to behold. Susie and Dr Porhoët stared at him helplessly. They tried <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>something</b> to say that would calm him.|$|E
6000|$|... "The only elucidation {{from outside}} {{seems to be}} a change of climate," [...] he mused. [...] "I should prefer <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>something</b> more original. In the {{meantime}} I will write to that misguided young man in Medchester." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{was doing}} the best I could for you," [...] he said, staring hard at the ingrate. [...] "I {{was trying to make}} Venia see what a careful husband you would make. Miss Sippet herself is most {{particular}} about such things-- and Venia seemed <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> it, because she asked me whether you used a warming-pan." ...|$|R
40|$|We tend <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> {{cognition}} as <b>something</b> {{that takes}} place inside the heads of individual human agents. However, {{it is clear that}} many of our cognitive accomplishments depend just as much on our ability to exploit the elements of our social and technological environments as they do on the information processing dynamics of the biological brain (Smart et al., 2010). Our social network...|$|R
6000|$|... "No--the {{natural result}} of having nothing else <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of.</b> I had <b>something</b> else <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> before you found me ill in Vauxhall Walk. I have nothing else <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> now. Remember that, {{if you find}} me for the future always harping on the same string. One {{question}} first. Did you guess what I meant to do on that morning when you showed me the newspaper, and when I read the account of Michael Vanstone's death?" ...|$|R
6000|$|She tried <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>something</b> else, and to {{get away}} from this talk of a sail to Leyden, but she fatally answered, [...] "I saw your boat this afternoon. I had n't noticed before that it was still here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... ‘The same, sir,’ replied Mr. Fenn, {{taking off}} his jockey cap in answer to my civility, but with the distant look and the tardy {{movements}} of one who continues <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>something</b> else. ‘And who may you be?’ he asked.|$|E
60|$|Hardman laboriously {{got to his}} feet. The breath {{had been}} partly knocked out of him. Baleful eyes rolled at Pan. Instinctive wrath, however, {{had been given a}} setback. Hardman had been forced <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>something</b> beside the {{frustration}} of his imperious will.|$|E
6000|$|... "I can't express {{how much}} I {{appreciate}} your telling me this," [...] she said. [...] "I'll confess to you I wished <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that <b>something</b> <b>of</b> that kind had happened. I wished to believe that--that you had made this determination alone. When I met you that night {{there was something}} about you I couldn't account for. I haven't been able to account for it until now." ...|$|R
60|$|Then {{there was}} her ring, {{of which she}} was as {{conscious}} as if it rather than she was what came gaily down the street. She felt it through her glove {{to make sure that}} it was still there. She took off the glove and raised the ring to her lips, though I doubt not it was the cheapest trinket. She viewed it from afar by stretching out her hand; she stooped to see how it looked near the ground; she considered its effect on the right of her and on the left of her and through one eye at a time. Even when you saw that she had made up her mind <b>to</b> <b>think</b> hard <b>of</b> <b>something</b> else, the little silly would take another look.|$|R
60|$|He {{looked up}} at me and then out of the window at the sun setting red across the plains. I tried <b>to</b> make him <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>something</b> beside himself, but I made a mess of it. The meeting with him was a shock to me. Long after dark, when I had {{stretched}} out for the night, I kept thinking of him and contrasting what I had to look forward to with his dismal future. Somehow it did not seem fair, and I could not get rid of the idea that I was selfish.|$|R
6000|$|... "The same, sir," [...] replied Mr. Fenn, {{taking off}} his jockey-cap in answer to my civility, but with the distant look and the tardy {{movements}} of one who continues <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>something</b> else. [...] "And who may you be?" [...] he asked.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then {{it will be}} rain by morning," [...] another predicted, and {{the girl}} tried hard <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>something</b> to say {{in support of the}} hit she had made already. But she could not, and was silent almost through the whole first course at dinner.|$|E
60|$|Six silent men, {{the host}} leading, the two husbands {{bringing}} up the rear, ascended the stairs, each with the sensation of being twice his usual weight. Six silent men entered the drawing-room {{and sat down on}} chairs. Six silent men tried <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>something</b> interesting to say.|$|E
6000|$|Sancho {{seemed to}} share the longing, for he kept running off a little way and {{stopping}} to frisk and bark; then rushed back to sit watching his master with those intelligent eyes of his, which seemed to say, [...] "Come on, Ben, let us scamper down this pleasant road and never stop till we are tired." [...] Swallows darted by, white clouds fled before the balmy west wind, a squirrel ran along the wall, and all things seemed to echo the boy's desire to leave toil behind and roam away as care-free as they. One thing restrained him, {{the thought of his}} seeming ingratitude to good Mrs. Moss, and the disappointment of the little girls at the loss of their two new play-fellows. While he paused <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> this, <b>something</b> happened which kept him from doing what he would have been sure to regret afterward.|$|R
60|$|My early {{recollections}} of the Highland scenery and customs made so favourable an impression {{in the poem}} called the Lady of the Lake, that I was induced <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> attempting <b>something</b> <b>of</b> the same kind in prose. I {{had been a good}} deal in the Highlands {{at a time when they}} were much less accessible and much less visited than they have been of late years, and was acquainted with many of the old warriors of 1745, who were, like most veterans, easily induced to fight their battles over again for the benefit of a willing listener like myself. It naturally occurred to me that the ancient traditions and high spirit of a people who, living in a civilised age and country, retained so strong a tincture of manners belonging to an early period of society, must afford a subject favourable for romance, if it should not prove a curious tale marred in the telling.|$|R
2500|$|According to Aristotle, spontaneity {{and chance}} are causes of some things, {{distinguishable}} from {{other types of}} cause. Chance as an incidental cause lies {{in the realm of}} accidental things. It is [...] "from what is spontaneous" [...] (but note that what is spontaneous does not come from chance). For a better understanding of Aristotle's conception of [...] "chance" [...] it might be better <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> [...] "coincidence": <b>Something</b> takes place by chance if a person sets out with the intent of having one thing take place, but with the result of another thing (not intended) taking place.|$|R
