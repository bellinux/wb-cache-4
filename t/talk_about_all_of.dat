40|$|A {{number of}} years ago, I wrote some things about Breton clause structure, {{beginning}} with a paper written with Sandy Chung in 1977 and a later revision of that analysis in 1981, plus some remarks on Breton Agreement in a morphology paper in 1982.

What I would like to talk about is an apparent paradox in Breton word order: on the one hand, clause structure seems to be that of a VSO language, but on the other hand, most sentences in fact look like those of a Verb-second language. In recent work, I’ve been trying to work out an account of Verb-second within Optimality Theory, as a generalization of the mechanisms involved in getting second position clitics. The analysis that results from extending that account to Breton is similar to that offered in a talk at the 1999 LSA meeting by Hannahs and Tallerman. 1 1 Breton As a V- 2 Language In main clauses, Breton finite verbs — here the perfect auxiliary — are always preceded by some...|$|E

40|$|I do {{not know}} whether to call myself a utility infielder or a garbage man, but I have a number of widely {{disparate}} cases to <b>talk</b> <b>about,</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> which affect state and local governments in a very significant way. I want to start with Harper v. Virginia Department of Taxation, the retroactivity case, because this one produced an interesting split between the so-called conservative judges. I {{do not know}} if there are Federalists out there, but two basic propositions of Federalist doctrine were at issue here. One was the extent of state immunity from federal taxation, and the other was the whole question of retroactivity. To a Federalist, {{it is very important that}} state governments not be imposed upon by federal courts and federal tax problems. On the other hand, they like to think of courts as always discovering the law, not making the law. If you were a possible candidate for a federal judgeship and you went to the Justice Department in the Reagan and Bush. Administration, the very first question they would ask you is, “are you in favor of judges making law or do you think judges simply discover law?” You had better get that question right or you are not going to go any further. And, of course, the doctrine is that judges never make law, they discover law. Problems of retroactivity implicate that very key issue. Under what circumstances should a court, having made either a constitutional or a non-constitutional determination, say that a law applies in this case and in future cases, but it does not apply backwards. Any governmental body that says, “This is the law from now on,” is making law. I do not know how else to describe it. Judges are not supposed to do that, they are supposed to say, “Oh, we were blind, but now we can see. We did not know what the law was. Now we know. It is the law and oh, by the way, it always was the law. ” If there is one strong Federalist doctrine, it is that judges should not make law and therefore a decision should always apply retroactively. The Harper case involved that issue in a very significant way for state and local governments...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{looks in}} detail at four {{small-holding}} households in a Chinese village that is experiencing the rapid industrialisation and urbanisation {{that has occurred}} in China {{over a number of}} decades. The research explores the dynamics of the households, which are at a point where traditional values and modes of living are challenged by the changing social, economic and cultural context. These small-holding village households are characterised by an interdependent set of family and household relationships and an intricate interplay between cultural expectations, resources dynamics, bonds of affect and economic and social activities. The research draws upon key literature concerned with household, family and economic life, to analyse the research data concerning these Chinese village households experiencing change. The research has been conducted within a narrative inquiry framework, as an appropriate approach for understanding the processes of adaptation to changes at the levels of households and individual members: what people do, how they feel, how they interpret ‘the self’ in the context of social, economic and cultural change, and how they <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> this. Fieldwork was carried out over the period from 2011 to 2014 in the village of Shang (a pseudonym) in the Huangshan area, Anhui province. In-depth interviews, informal interviews and conversations with household members were combined with long-term participant observation in the village, encompassing various households and many social events. The analysis of the resulting data is provided around three key topics: ‘Divisions of Labour, Household Work and Changing Economic Life’, ‘Resources and the Household’, and ‘Household and Networks’. People have a range of different ways of coping with changes, influenced by many factors including their roles and aspirations and bonds of love and caring; while at the household level, the different styles and layers of livelihood are influenced by and in turn influence the organisation of material and particularly non-material resources in the household. The stories that people tell about their experiences, feelings and understandings demonstrate that they are actively responding and adapting to change rather than being passive recipients or resistant to this. Both change and continuity are witnessed through focusing analysis at both individual and household levels. Combining ideas about the household as a resource system and a narrative inquiry approach provides detailed insights on Chinese village households in their changing social and economic context...|$|E
