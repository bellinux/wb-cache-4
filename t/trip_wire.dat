Tina panics and is killed when a <b>trip</b> <b>wire</b> sends her headfirst into a bear trap. Blake, Vicki and Gertie are killed fighting Billy. Chris, Nancy, and Max flee the cabin, and Billy chases after them. Chris is stabbed, and Billy kidnaps Nancy. Max finds her at Billy's barn hideout, and the two women fight him, which results in Max getting stabbed, before they both escape.|$|E
25|$|Booby traps {{ranged from}} the simple to the complex. Non-explosive traps {{included}} the well-known sharpened punji stake coated in excrement, and mounted on sapling triggers and placed in shallow, covered pits. Stakes were deployed where infantry would walk or fling themselves to avoid attack such as roadside trenches, or behind logs. One of these devices was to injure a future Chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff - Colin Powell. Another type of trap was a spiked mud ball that swung down on its victim after a <b>trip</b> <b>wire</b> release, impaling him. Other impalement devices included bamboo whips and triggered sapling spikes. Bows with poisoned arrows were also used.|$|E

In the present work, flow past a circular cylinder with using <b>tripping</b> <b>wires</b> is studied experimentally. The wind tunnel used for modeling free stream is open blow circuit (maximum speed = 30 m/s and maximum turbulence of free stream = 0. 1 %). The selected Reynolds number for all tests was constant (Re = 25000). The circular cylinder selected for this experiment is 20 and 400 mm {{in diameter and}} length, respectively.

In this study installed some <b>tripping</b> <b>wires</b> 1 mm in diameter, with a different number of wires on the circular cylinder and the wake characteristics of the circular cylinder is studied.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{vortices}} produced between two 2 d cylinders, {{and the relationship}} between the structures of the vortices produced at both cylinders when one is placed in the wake flow of another. CFD simulations using ANSYS Fluent were used to determine the coefficients of lift and drag, as well as the frequency of vortex shedding and size of vortices at three separate Reynolds numbers of 16000, 32000 and 65000 in different arrangements. Each arrangement of cylinders was compared against controls, which consisted of a single cylinder to determine the alteration of forces produced. Two <b>trip</b> <b>wires</b> at 7 different angles of 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, and 70 degrees were then investigated at a Reynolds number of 65000 which was compared to the smooth cylinder control forces and frequency of vortex shedding. The most optimum angle of <b>trip</b> <b>wires</b> was then combined with linear cylinder arrangements also at a Reynolds number of 65000 for comparison with only the upstream cylinder utilizing the <b>trip</b> <b>wires...</b>|$|R

50|$|The X-200 {{consisted}} of a salvaged 5 gal oil can filled with napalm and fitted with a black powder bursting charge.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the effect of a semi-circuler <b>tripping</b> <b>wire</b> on the aerodynamic character of a circuler cylinder as basic research for study on Rain-wind induced vibration. As a results of experimental investigation on the fluid forces acting on a circuler cylinder with a semi-circuler <b>tripping</b> <b>wire,</b> it became evident that there were bi-stable flows in the limiting condition of R_e number and relative height of a trippig wire to diameter of cylinder d/D. In a state of the bi-stable, the mean values of lift forces in short times show rectanguler change intermittently. It is decided the condition convereted into the bi-stable flows by statistic characters of flactuating lift and the change of fluid forces with the switching of two flow patterns by analysis of the measured fluctuation of fluid forces transformed into low frequency fluctuation through the low pass filter with 2 or 3 times period of eddy shedding from a circuler cylinder...|$|R

50|$|Diamond Heist: The {{players were}} taken to an emptied {{warehouse}} into which five diamonds, behind an intricate laser security fence, were placed. Each {{of them had a}} value, from $1,000 to $5,000. If a player could make it through the laser fence with the diamond, the kitty would increase by its value, but if they grabbed a diamond and subsequently <b>tripped</b> a laser <b>wire,</b> the value of the diamond would be penalized from the kitty. They were lowered, one at a time, from a height, and given aerosol sprays with which they could see the laser wires. There was a collective time limit of five minutes. Marc went straight for the $3,000 diamond, but <b>tripped</b> a <b>wire</b> after 35 seconds. Crystal-Rose <b>tripped</b> a <b>wire</b> {{on the way to the}} $2,000 diamond after mere moments. Alaina <b>tripped</b> a <b>wire</b> on the way to the $1,000 diamond. David then retrieved both the $1,000 and $2,000 diamonds. Bob then <b>tripped</b> a <b>wire</b> with his hand just in front of the $3,000 diamond. Mere seconds remained for Ann-Marees run, and though she made it to the $3,000 diamond safely, she did not grab it, because there was not sufficient time for her to make it back out with it.|$|R
5000|$|The mine has {{an olive}} green steel {{cylindrical}} body {{which has an}} offset fuze well on the top.

50|$|The {{most widely}} used version of the spigot gun was the tree spigot gun. This had its spigot mounted on a {{ball and socket joint}} {{attached}} to a large wood screw. A pair of handles were provided to turn the screw so that it could be secured in a tree or other suitable wooden support; one of the handles had a chisel-shaped end for removing bark from trees. When this had been done, a sighting tool could be placed on the spigot, and the spigot was then adjusted and clamped into position. The sight was then removed and replaced with the mortar projectile. The weapon was fired by pulling on a lanyard, by a <b>trip</b> <b>wire</b> as part of a booby trap or by a pencil detonator delay mechanism. The tree spigot had a range of 200 yd. As part of a booby trap, it could be positioned to fire downwards onto the relatively thin armour on top of a tank. One account of its use describes a <b>trip</b> <b>wire</b> for a locomotive; placed up high it was likely to be missed by track walkers looking for bombs on the railway line.|$|E
50|$|Antipersonnel IEDs {{typically}} {{also contain}} fragmentation-generating {{objects such as}} nails, ball bearings or even small rocks to cause wounds at greater distances than blast pressure alone could. IEDs are triggered by various methods, including remote control, infrared or magnetic triggers, pressure-sensitive bars or <b>trip</b> <b>wires</b> (victim-operated). In some cases, multiple IEDs are wired together in a daisy chain to attack a convoy of vehicles spread out along a roadway.|$|R
