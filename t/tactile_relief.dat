Recent technological progress allows the development of interactive maps which overcome these limitations. We designed an accessible interactive map prototype composed by a multi-touch screen with tactile map overlay and speech output. It provided auditory information when tapping on map elements. We have demonstrated in an experiment that our prototype was more effective and satisfactory for visually impaired users than a simple raised-line map. We also explored and tested different types of advanced non-visual interaction (gestural, tangible and wearable) for exploring the map. Finally, we present how this work has been conducted using a participatory design process...|$|E

5000|$|The Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial is {{a presidential}} {{memorial}} in Washington D.C. {{dedicated to the}} memory of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, the 32nd President of the United States, and to the era he represents. For the memorial's designer, landscape architect Lawrence Halprin, the memorial site represents the capstone of a distinguished career, partly because the landscape architect had fond memories of Roosevelt, and partly because of the sheer difficulty of the task. Dedicated on May 2, 1997 by President Bill Clinton, the monument, spread over 7.5 acre, traces 12 years {{of the history of the}} United States through a sequence of four outdoor rooms, one for each of FDR's terms of office. Sculptures inspired by photographs depict the 32nd president alongside his dog Fala. Other sculptures depict scenes from the Great Depression, such as listening to a fireside chat on the radio and waiting in a bread line, a bronze sculpture by George Segal. A bronze statue of First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt standing before the United Nations emblem honors her dedication to the UN. It is the only presidential memorial to depict a First Lady. [...] Considering Roosevelt's disability, the memorial's designers intended to create a memorial that would be accessible to those with various physical impairments. Among other features, the memorial includes an area with <b>tactile</b> <b>reliefs</b> with braille writing for people who are blind. However, the memorial faced serious criticism from disabled activists. Vision-impaired visitors complained that the braille dots were improperly spaced and that some of the braille and reliefs were mounted eight feet off of the ground, placing it above the reach of most people.|$|R
40|$|Gelotophobes (individuals with a fear {{of being}} laughed at) have even been found to express less joy and more {{contempt}} towards joyfully smiling/laughing faces compared to non-gelotophobes. However, {{it is unclear whether}} the lower levels of joy and higher levels of contempt are related to joy per se or only to those elements of joy associated with laughter. Thus, this study investigated the verbal and facial responses of 20 gelotophobes and 20 non-gelotophobes towards videos of people recalling memories of laughter-eliciting positive emotions (amusement, <b>relief,</b> schadenfreude, <b>tactile</b> pleasure). The facial expressions of the participants were clandestinely filmed and evaluated by the Facial Action Coding System (FACS; Ekman, Friesen, & Hager, 2002). Smiles of enjoyment and "markers of contempt" were coded and verbal ratings of the participants obtained. Gelotophobes responded with less joyful smiles and with more expressions of contempt to laughter-eliciting emotions than did non-gelotophobes. Gelotophobes also rated the degree of joy expressed by participants in the video clips of <b>tactile</b> pleasure and <b>relief</b> lower than non-gelotophobes. No differences occurred in ratings of aversiveness. The results suggest that gelotophobes have a negative bias towards laughter-eliciting situations stemming from different positive elicitors...|$|R
40|$|Novel {{printing}} and layering technologies that incorporate a raised or embossed surface have demonstrated {{new opportunities for}} novel applications. Textured images have been used extensively in the print industry as decorative decals and embellishments to enhance the surface qualities of packaging and prints. As the resolution and print quality has improved, and the technology has become more accessible, {{there are now more}} opportunities to explore texture in artworks, especially in relation to tactile printing for blind or visually impaired. Over the last two decades, museums have broadened the idea of cultural accessibility for blind people, for example, to cultural events and museums. Access to knowledge began by enabling users to engage with texts and printed word, and then as second hand experience through audio books and description about artefacts and events, and now the opportunity to give access to images, such as artworks, picture books and photographs, in museums whereby a second hand experience is replaced by first hand experience. On a practical level, day-to-day understanding of identifying information and things, ways of identifying colour and colour relationships has been developed by Okudera (2015) in the form of textile tags to convey colour information is a practical method to enable blind people to identify the colour of their clothes and to know that their clothes colour co-ordinated. A simple iron on tactile tag, based on the hue circle, enabled users to identify colour relationships. Ten small raised (rubber to the touch) dots are arranged around a Munsell hue circle each representing primary colours, along with three raised vertical dots in the centre to represent white, grey and black. In order to identify the representative colour, a bigger dot or hole is punctured into the tag (Okudera). Tactile pictures for blind can provide an enhanced understanding for the user. Appropriate methods for image segmentation is necessary to distinguish different parts of a picture. Traditional approaches use contours and patterns, which creates a distinct and recognisable shape and enables separate objects to identified. A contour arises on the boundary between two surfaces and is usually described by a line. Different textures can also be incorporated to convey an idea of a picture. Living Paintings provide touch to see pictures, which can range from current events such as the Olympics to educational books such as dinosaurs to cultural object such as from the British Museum London. These <b>relief</b> <b>tactile</b> pictures use highly simplified shapes, but provide essential unambiguous information. The pages are vacuum formed using thermo plastic sheet over a carved or machined board, and then ring bound together with other pages to form a flip-book. This cheap method means that books can be mass-produced, widely circulated, and are fairly robust. However, we would argue that accuracy is not even wanted in most of the applications, as a certain degree of interpretation of the full body of things may be more valuable and welcome than a cold replica. An interesting project, where interpretation and exploration is fundamental, is demonstrated by Studios Durero. The Didu project in collaboration with the Prado Madrid, has attempted to make classic paintings accessible to visually impaired people through relief prints. Their designers worked alongside art specialists and with visually impaired people to understand how to either exaggerate textures already present in a painting, or to create new ones that would be visually relevant but needed to be exaggerated to be perceived by blind participants. Likewise 3 D Photoworks have studied how to make fine art prints accessible by building a high-relief surface of paintings, and Tooteko use sound and touch to assist the user to explore a range of images. This short presentation will discuss aspects and requirements of <b>relief,</b> <b>tactile</b> 2. 5 D printing, and surface manufacturing in relation to tactile printing for the visually impaired...|$|R
