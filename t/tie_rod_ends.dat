40|$|<b>Tie</b> <b>rod</b> <b>ends</b> {{generally}} deteriorate earlier due to {{the lack}} of dust boot. Polyurethane materials, which show excellent properties as abrasion resistance, flexibility and needle pressure stability, can be used as dust boots in <b>tie</b> <b>rod</b> <b>ends.</b> So in this study flexibility, abrasion resistance and needle pressure stability are investigated by changing the hardness of polyurethane materials. In the experiment materials, named as Elastollan-C 60 A and Elastollan-C 70 A, are used as dust boots. During physical tests to be applied to the dust boot are as followed; hardness, tensile strength, elongation at break, recovery, compression set at 70 0 C/ 24 h, density, volume, weight, adhesive resistance, internal diameter, external diameter and outer diameter. During the aging tests, following steps are applied; change of hardness, change of tensile strength, volume change, change of weight, change of friction, internal diameter, external diameter and outer diameter at 100 0 C/ 70 h in the lithium grease and circulating air test. Finally those polyurethane materials, used as dust boots, are applied according to the criteria of ASTM, and DIN in order to preserve <b>tie</b> <b>rod</b> <b>ends</b> from outer factors for a long time. As a result, physical and aging values of these to polyurethane materials are assessed...|$|E
40|$|The <b>tie</b> <b>rods</b> in the Duomo are {{structural}} elements, {{subject to}} monotonic loading and cyclic loading. Non-destructive testing {{is used to}} find cracks and determine their geometry. Lamb waves are applied to determine the presence of cracks in the <b>tie</b> <b>rod</b> and to estimate their positions. The cracks are located using eddy current testing. Finally the geometries of the cracks are determined using active infrared thermography. Experimental testing {{in the field of}} fracture mechanics is done to determine the fracture toughness of wrought iron. Combining the geometry of the crack with the fracture toughness of the material, leads to an estimation of the critical crack size. The <b>tie</b> <b>rods</b> are made of wrought iron. The material properties are very heterogeneous. A <b>tie</b> <b>rod</b> is made out of multiple wrought iron bars of 1 - 1. 5 meters. These bars are welded together under an angle of 27 °. Cracks of two damaged <b>tie</b> <b>rods</b> are found to be under such an angle. The search for cracks will be concentrated on inclined cracks with a repetition of 1 - 1. 5 meters. Lamb waves is the first technique applied. An ultrasonic tomograph A 1040 MIRA is used for testing. The modelling of Lamb waves travelling in <b>tie</b> <b>rods</b> and the signal processing are based on the possibilities of the MIRA. The dispersion behaviour of Lamb waves is modelled to understand the wave propagation in <b>tie</b> <b>rods</b> and the influence it has on the testing done with the MIRA. Using this knowledge, proper testing settings are found. Subsequently, signal processing is considered. The main objective of this part {{is to be able to}} identify cracks present in the <b>tie</b> <b>rods.</b> The position of the cracks in the <b>tie</b> <b>rod</b> is determined using eddy current testing. Commercial eddy current probes are too sensitive to discontinuities to be applied to <b>tie</b> <b>rods.</b> Therefore, new probes are developed to overcome this drawback. Two probes are designed, both for the horizontal face and for the vertical face of the <b>tie</b> <b>rod.</b> The vertical face of the <b>tie</b> <b>rods</b> are best accessible. Therefore, on-site testing is done with the probe specially designed for that face. Active infrared thermography is implemented to establish the geometry of the crack. A finite element analysis has been performed to model the propagation of heat through a <b>tie</b> <b>rod.</b> This is followed by experimental testing in the laboratory carried out on a broken <b>tie</b> <b>rod.</b> Finally, the results of the modelling and of the experimental testing are compared. The last part has a fracture mechanical nature. The fracture toughness of the material is determined assuming both linear-elastic and elastic-plastic material behaviour. Also the fatigue behaviour is evaluated. The values obtained from experimental testing have been applied to a simplified model of the crack geometry to determine the critical crack size of the <b>tie</b> <b>rod,</b> for monotonic loading, and the threshold crack size, for cyclic loading. Fatigue life is predicted taking the threshold crack size as the initial crack size and the critical crack size as the final crack size. <br/...|$|R

40|$|Dust boot is {{the part}} which {{prevents}} entering the foreign bodies (such as water, dust etc.) in to the <b>tie</b> <b>rod</b> <b>ends.</b> Dust boot can lose its elasticity according to working condition. The boot fails and contaminants, resulting in corrosion and wear and causing excessive deflection in the socket assembly, loose steering and alignment to angle changes. Increasing trends in the problems of difficulty in control on the road curve, and skid due to the looseness in the connecting points to the steering system can be seen. In this study physical tests are applied to the dust boot. These are; hardness, tensile strength, elongation at break, recovery, compression set at 70 0 C/ 24 h, density, volume, weight, adhesion resistance, internal diameter,external diameter and outer diameter. In the period of aging tests, following tests are applied; change of hardness, change of tensile strength, volume change, change of weight, change of friction, internal diameter, external diameter and outer diameter at 100 0 C/ 70 h in the lithium grease and circulating air test.

40|$|To {{create an}} energy {{efficient}} vehicle {{there are a}} number of aspects that need to be optimized, namely; the drive train of the vehicle and energy source, aerodynamics and weight. Focusing on weight reduction, while still maintaining the desired performance and structural strength, many manufacturers are turning to advanced composites due to their superior strength to weight characteristics. Solar car racing provides a research platform that drives this innovation through technology development and efficiency. A lightweight vehicle suspension system design is being presented, together with an introduction into future testing. A suspension system is made up of a number of critical components which are dynamically loaded during standard operation due to undulating forces imposed by the road surface. Unidirectional cross-wound carbon fiber tubing is used for suspension and steering arms. The tubing is interfaced with small steel inserts and pivoting arm <b>tie</b> <b>rod</b> <b>ends.</b> Concerns within the design are the adhesive bonding of the carbon tubing to the steel inserts, and what type of tensile loading the interface can withstand. Due to forces imposed on the system during cornering and shock loading the components are required to withstand a minimum of 1. 2 times the weight of the overall vehicle, i. e. 258 kg. Tensile test results show that the mechanical properties of the adhesive joints rely somewhat on the surface characteristics and bond preparation. The target load of 258 kg was successfully obtained under static loading for two types of sample sets. The first based on the standard for describing the lap shear strength of adhesively bonded carbon fiber to aluminum, and the second based on the working component itself...|$|E
50|$|Bump steer can be {{adjusted}} by moving any of the front suspension components pickup points Up, down, in or out. For example: Say the inner <b>tie</b> <b>rod</b> mounting point is moved up either by moving the rack or modifying the pitman arm mounting point or arm drop. The result is the <b>tie</b> <b>rod's</b> arc will change. It will then require {{a change in the}} <b>tie</b> <b>rod</b> length to be in proper alignment so the radius of the arc will change as well. If the radius arc of the <b>tie</b> <b>rod</b> is longer than stock on a front steer setup then the car will have more toe understeer. If the same scenario was applied to a rear steering design, then the car would exhibit less toe understeer. This is because the effective length of the <b>tie</b> <b>rods</b> is affected by its static length/arc radius, its pickup points and the angle of its arc during each phase of suspension travel in relation to the control arms.|$|R
