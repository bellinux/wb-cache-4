The aim of {{this study}} was the following: (1) to assess the dermal {{exposure}} of workers to PAH‘s during an entire eight hour work shift; (2) to assess the short term dermal exposure of workers to PAH‘s while performing certain identified tasks; (3) to identify the areas and occupations that poses the highest risk {{to the health of the}} workers; (4) to assess the skin barrier function of workers that may be exposed to PAH‘s by measuring TEWL, skin hydration and skin surface pH. Methods ? Workers from three different plants in a South African petrochemical factory participated in the study. Their dermal exposure was assessed during a single 8 –hour shift by using dermal adhesive patches and during specific 30 minute tasks by means of dermal wipes. Their baseline skin barrier function was also determined at the beginning of the eight hour shift by measuring skin surface hydration, skin surface pH and the Transepidermal water loss (TEWL). Surface PAH–samples were also collected from various surfaces in two of the plants. Results: Eight hour study– Cleaner 3 from the Solids Filtration Plant (SFP) experienced the highest average dermal exposure to total PAHs (759. 6 ng/cm 2) as well as the highest total PAH–concentration on the outside of his clothing (28596. 3 ng/cm 2). At the <b>Tar</b> <b>Separation</b> Plant (TSP) Cleaner 2 experienced the highest average dermal exposure (274. 4 ng/cm 2). Cleaner 3 and Process controller at SFP as well as Truck loader 2 at TSP were all exposed to benzo[a]pyrene on the surface of their skin (37. 20 ng/cm 2; 57. 66 ng/cm 2 and 9. 30 ng/cm 2 respectively). Statistical significant differences were seen between the skin surface hydration values (p= 0. 013) as well as the TEWL values (p = 0. 033) of TSP and SFP workers. Short term study– Slop pit cleaner 3 from TSP experienced the highest dermal exposure to total PAHs (1659. 04 ng/cm 2). A splash of tar landed on Slop pit cleaner 3 ‘s cheek which contained 14871. 45 ng/cm 2 total PAHs. The following workers were exposed to benzo[a]pyrene on various anatomical areas during their tasks: Truck loader 3 at TSP (2. 7 ng/cm 2); Cleaner 6 at SFP (6. 2 ng/cm 2 and 3. 5 ng/cm 2); Slop pit cleaner 2 at TSP (20. 8 ng/cm 2 and 12. 8 ng/cm 2) and Slop pit cleaner 3 at TSP (72. 8 ng/cm 2 and 108 ng/cm 2). Slop pit cleaner 3 at TSP was exposed to dibenz[a,h]anthracene (9. 6 ng/cm 2 and 15. 2 ng/cm 2) v The surface with the highest contamination is on top of the dirty lockers in the SFP (519. 0 ng/cm 2). Conclusions: In both studies, Cleaners were identified as the greatest exposed occupation. Cleaning the slop pit at TSP and cleaning the plant at SFP were identified as tasks with the highest potential exposure. Cleaners are probably the highest exposed workers because they come in direct contact with the tar more often. Workers exposed to benzo[a]pyrene or dibenz[a,h]anthracene face the greatest health risk as these substances are highly carcinogenic. SFP workers are in general exposed to higher concentrations of PAHs than workers in other areas. Workers at both SFP and TSP had high baseline TEWL and low baseline skin surface hydration values which indicated disrupted skin barrier function and may lead to an increase in their susceptibility to skin disorders. Dirty surfaces can also contain PAHs including benzo[a]pyrene and dibenz[a,h]anthracene. Master...|$|E
50|$|Another {{route to}} styrene {{involves}} {{the reaction of}} benzene and ethane. This process is being developed by Snamprogetti S.p.A. and Dow. Ethane, along with ethylbenzene, {{is fed to a}} dehydrogenation reactor with a catalyst capable of simultaneously producing styrene and ethylene. The dehydrogenation effluent is cooled and separated and the ethylene stream is recycled to the alkylation unit. The process attempts to overcome previous shortcomings in earlier attempts to develop production of styrene from ethane and benzene, such as inefficient recovery of aromatics, production of high levels of heavies and <b>tars,</b> and inefficient <b>separation</b> of hydrogen and ethane. Development of the process is ongoing.|$|R
40|$|Cyrogenic <b>Tar</b> Sand <b>Separation</b> {{is a novel}} {{technique}} to access the vast energy potential of the Alberta Tar Sands. In this process tar sand is ground at about - 50 (DEGREES) C. At this temperature the tar is more brittle and weaker than the sand. Thus, the tar is liberated from the sand and ground to fine particles, which can {{be separated from the}} sand. The technical performance of this process was studied, and a general grinding and liberation model was developed, which simulates this and other two component grinding processes.;Four grinding/separation techniques were studied: Fluidized Bed Grinder (a stirred fluidized bed with steel balls) and Spouted Bed grinding combined with tar entrainment, and High Speed Impeller and Ball Mill grinding combined with sieving. The spouted bed gave the highest quality of <b>separation,</b> with a <b>tar</b> purity of 84 %, at a tar recovery of 90 %. The ball mill gave the lowest separation quality with a tar purity of 60 % at 80 % tar recovery, and 35 % at 90 % recovery. A maximum tar recovery of 94 %, at a tar purity of 65 %, was obtained in the fluidized bed grinder. The spouted bed gave the lowest rate of separation, with a typical processing time of 14 hours to obtain 90 % tar recovery, versus 2 - 7 hours for the other mills. However, proposed modifications should increase this rate substantially.;In the grinding and liberation model, a distinction is made between tar sand agglomerates, containing more than one sand grain, and single sand particles, coated with a thin tar layer. Grinding of each particle type is described by a set of conventional first order rate equations, although with non-normalized breakage distribution functions for the agglomerates. The processes are interconnected by a continuous transfer of agglomerate grinding products to the tar coated sand particles. The simultaneous attrition of the tar layer on the sand particles is described by a fourth order rate equation, {{as a function of the}} remaining tar.;Simulation, using this model and experimentally determined parameters, gave an excellent agreement with measured size distributions (from 63 - 2000 (mu) m) and tar concentrations (as a function of particle size and processing time), and provided substantial insight into the various <b>tar</b> sand <b>separation</b> experiments...|$|R
40|$|The liquid organic {{fraction}} of pyrolytic tar {{has a high}} energy value which makes possible its utilization as an energy source. However, before utilization, {{it is crucial to}} remove water from the liquid fraction. The presence of water reduces the energy value of pyrolytic <b>tars.</b> Water <b>separation</b> from the organic tar fraction is a complex process, since an emulsion can be readily formed. Therefore, after phase separation, {{it is important to know}} the residual water content in the organic phase and whether it is necessary to further dry it. The results presented in this manuscript focus on a water determination in liquid products from coal and biomass pyrolysis by a coulometric Karl‑Fischer titration. The Coulometric Karl‑Fischer titration is often used for a water content determination in gaseous, liquid and solid samples. However, to date, this titration method has not been used for a water determination in tars. A new water determination method, which has been tested on different types of tar, has been developed. The Coulometric Karl‑Fischer titration is suitable for tar samples with a water content not greater than 5 wt. %. The obtained experimental results indicate that the new introduced method can be used with a very good repeatability for a water content determination in tars...|$|R
40|$|L'exploitation minière des sables bitumineux requiert une {{succession}} de nombreuses opérations pour séparer le bitume, l'eau et le sable. La séparation solide/liquide fait intervenir un hydrocyclone. Afin de limiter l'ajout d'eau, l'hydrocyclone doit fonctionner dans des conditions inhabituelles correspondant à une concentration élevée à l'alimentation. Une étude expérimentale a permis de caractériser l'ensemble des régimes de fonctionnement, l'influence de la concentration et des caractéristiques géométriques. De plus, des simulations numériques ont été réalisées avec NEPTUNE_CFD@Tlse. Deux méthodes sont proposées pour modéliser les comportements observés à faible et à forte concentration. Les résultats numériques sont en bon {{accord avec}} les expériences sur toute la gamme de concentration. L'étude des phénomènes locaux permet une meilleure compréhension des mécanismes de <b>séparation.</b> <b>Tar</b> sands beneficiation requires {{a series of}} processing steps for separation of bitumen, water and sand particles. In this process, hydrocyclones are used to separate sand from water and bitumen, thereby recovering additional bitumen and concentrating sand particles before sending them off to tailing ponds. In order to reduce fresh water consumption (environmental policy), hydrocyclones need to operate with high feed solids content, say 50 % in mass, which lays outside their standard operating regime. The response and performance of hydrocyclones need to be understood under such stringent operating conditions. A pilot scale experiment was commissioned for testing a 100 mm diam. hydrocyclone under different operating regimes of discharge and measuring the corresponding separation performance. Feed solids concentration and geometrical properties were varied extensively. Separation performance indicators, including partition curve, cut-size, sharpness index and water recovery to underflow were obtained by standard data reconciliation. The experimental data provided all the information required to test the CFD model that was derived to simulate the hydrocyclone. Eulerian simulations of the three-dimensional liquid-solid flow inside the hydrocyclone were carried out, using a multi-fluid model (NEPTUNE_ CFD@Tlse). The actual geometrical features and operating conditions of the hydrocyclone were accurately matched in the simulations. Two simulation approaches have been proposed for hydrocyclone modelling, depending on their operating under dilute conditions, with a spray discharge or dense conditions, with a rope discharge. Numerical simulation results are in good agreement with experiments. Local analysis of hydrodynamic features yields {{new insights into the}} behaviour of hydrocyclones at high feed solids concentration. TOULOUSE-INP (315552154) / SudocSudocFranceF...|$|R
40|$|Former {{manufactured}} gas plants (FMGPs) are a ubiquitous source of environmental con- tamination. The process of gas production created {{a number of}} by-products, including coal tar and ammoniacal liquor. Coal tar contains a complex mixture of organic and inorganic compounds, {{many of which are}} toxic and carcinogenic. It is estimated that over 3000 ± 1000 FMGPs exist in the United Kingdom alone, yet there are few recent publications detailing the analysis of coal tars. The complex composition of coal tar is known to vary due to a number of factors, including production method, temperature and coal type, making the analysis and interpretation of such samples extremely challenging. Environmental forensics is concerned with the source, fate and transport of contaminants. The introduction of recent legislation such as the EU Environmental Liabilities Directive 2004 / 35 /EC, which promotes the "polluters pay" policy, has encouraged the development of accurate and robust scientific methods for the identification of contaminants. Analytical instrumentation is constantly evolving, thus new protocols to trace the origin of contamination must also be developed to utilise these technological advances. Two-dimensional gas chromatography (GCxGC) and compound specific isotope analysis (CSIA) are two exam- ples of advanced analytical instruments which have the potential to aid source identification. GCxGC provides enhanced separation of complex mixtures compared to conventional gas chromatographic techniques, while CSIA allows chemically identical contaminants to be compared based on their isotopic composition. In this study, preliminary research investigated the isotopic composition of coal tars, as this technique is currently a major tool for source apportionment in environmental forensics. However, the results demonstrated. that the similar nature of British coals used for gas production at the investigated sites produced similar isotopic values in the resultant tars, making the technique redundant in this case. Therefore, the potential of GCxGC was investigated for ultra resolution chemical fingerprinting of coal tars. Traditionally, chemical fingerprinting of complex mixtures, such as coal tar, is performed using a tiered approach including rigorous sample preparation steps and analysis by multiple instruments. In this work, a new, single-step analytical procedure was developed for the analysis of coal tars by GCxGC. Automated sample extraction techniques combined with GCxGC analyses were employed to provide detailed chemical fingerprinting in a fast, yet accurate, manner. This research represents a major advance in knowledge of compositional variation within coal <b>tars.</b> The enhanced <b>separation</b> of GCxGC provides vast quantities of chemical data which can be difficult to interpret without statistical methods. A multivariate statistical model was developed to provide process-specific classification of coal tars. The statistical model was validated through use of a blind study, indicating that process-specific apportionment of coal tars was achievable. Based on these results, the application of the single-step procedure for environmental forensics on a commercial basis was evaluated. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
