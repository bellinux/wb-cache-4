5|$|A {{number of}} {{approaches}} {{have been used}} <b>to</b> <b>estimate</b> <b>the</b> year of the crucifixion of Jesus. Most scholars agree that he died in 30 or 33 AD. The gospels state that the event occurred during the prefecture of Pilate, the Roman governor of Judea from 26 to 36 AD. The date for the conversion of Paul (estimated to be 33–36 AD) acts as an upper bound for the date of Crucifixion. The dates for Paul's conversion and ministry can be determined by analyzing the Pauline epistles and the Acts of the Apostles. Astronomers have tried <b>to</b> <b>estimate</b> <b>the</b> precise date of the Crucifixion by analyzing lunar motion and calculating historic dates of Passover, a festival based on the lunisolar Hebrew calendar. The most widely accepted dates derived from this method are April 7, 30 AD, and April 3, 33 AD (both Julian).|$|E

40|$|A grand {{challenge}} of the 21 st century cosmology is <b>to</b> accurately <b>estimate</b> <b>the</b> cosmological parameters of our Universe. A major approach <b>to</b> <b>estimating</b> <b>the</b> cosmological parameters {{is to use the}} large-scale matter distribution of the Universe. Galaxy surveys provide the means to map out cosmic large-scale structure in three dimensions. Information about galaxy locations is typically summarized in a "single" function of scale, such as the galaxy correlation function or power-spectrum. We show that it is possible <b>to</b> <b>estimate</b> these cosmological parameters directly from the distribution of matter. This paper presents the application of deep 3 D convolutional networks to volumetric representation of dark-matter simulations as well as the results obtained using a recently proposed distribution regression framework, showing that machine learning techniques are comparable to, and can sometimes outperform, maximum-likelihood point estimates using "cosmological models". This opens <b>the</b> way <b>to</b> <b>estimating</b> <b>the</b> parameters of our Universe with higher accuracy. Comment: ICML 201...|$|R
