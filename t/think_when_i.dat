500|$|Bryan's announcement, after {{gaining the}} Democratic nomination, {{that he would}} {{undertake}} a nationwide tour by rail, something then unusual for presidential candidates, put pressure on McKinley to match him. Hanna especially urged his candidate to hit the road. McKinley decided against this, feeling {{that he could not}} outdo Bryan, who was a brilliant stump speaker, and that he would be foolish to try. [...] "I might as well put up a trapeze on my front lawn and compete against some professional athlete as go out speaking against Bryan. I have to <b>think</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> speak." [...] Furthermore, no matter how McKinley traveled, Bryan would upstage him by choosing a less comfortable manner. McKinley was unwilling to compete with Bryan on the Democrat's terms, and sought to find his own way to reach the people.|$|E
500|$|Bryan's {{campaign}} had at most an estimated $500,000. With his eloquence and youthful energy his major {{assets in the}} race, Bryan decided on a whistle-stop political tour by train on an unprecedented scale. Hanna urged McKinley to match Bryan's tour {{with one of his}} own; the candidate declined {{on the grounds that the}} Democrat was a better stump speaker: [...] "I might just as well set up a trapeze on my front lawn and compete with some professional athlete as go out speaking against Bryan. I have to <b>think</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> speak." [...] Instead of going to the people, McKinley would remain at home in Canton and allow the people to come to him; according to historian R. Hal Williams in his book on the 1896 election, [...] "it was, as it turned out, a brilliant strategy. McKinley's 'Front Porch Campaign' became a legend in American political history." ...|$|E
500|$|Several later {{commentators}} have interpreted the {{play as a}} reflection of Rand's early interest in the ideas of German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche. Literature professor Shoshana Milgram saw elements of Nietzsche's morality in the descriptions of Bjorn Faulkner, who [...] "never thought of things as right or wrong". Others found significance in Rand's admiration of the play's criminal characters. Historian Jennifer Burns said Rand [...] "found criminality an irresistible metaphor for individualism" [...] because of the influence on her of [...] "Nietzsche's transvaluation of values [...] changed criminals into heroes". Rand maintained criminality was not the important attribute of the characters; she said a criminal could serve as [...] "an eloquent symbol" [...] of independence and rebellion against conformity, but stated, [...] "I do not think, nor did I <b>think</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> wrote this play, that a swindler is a heroic character or that a respectable banker is a villain". Rand biographer Ronald Merrill dismissed this explanation as a cover-up for the play's promotion of Nietzschean ideas that Rand later rejected. He called the play [...] "a powerful and eloquent plea for the Nietzschean worldview" [...] of the superiority of the [...] "superman"; this is represented by Faulkner, whom Merrill interprets as rejecting external moral authority and the [...] "slave morality" [...] of ordinary people. Biographer Anne Heller said Rand [...] "later renounced her romantic fascination with criminals", making the characters' criminality an embarrassment for her.|$|E

500|$|The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien premiered on June 1, 2009, with The Max Weinberg 7 now {{expanded}} to eight {{and referred to}} as Max Weinberg and the Tonight Show Band. [...] Andy Richter was back as an announcer, making Weinberg's role as a foil a little uncertain. [...] Gradually Weinberg and the band's roles in the comic aspects of the show began to assert themselves. On June 25, Weinberg departed The Tonight Show temporarily for four weeks to join Springsteen and band part-way through their European leg; this was conveyed on the show via a comedy bit that had his drum riser turn into a float that took him outside the studio and purportedly to the airport. [...] Weinberg returned to the show on August 3, after flying back from a Springsteen show that had ended early into the same morning in Spain. [...] Of being Tonight Show bandleader, he said, [...] "I {{think one of the}} biggest thrills in my life was seeing my name in the same sentence as Doc Severinsen, who, in my view, is the gold standard for 'Tonight Show' bandleaders. There's never been anyone who did it quite near the class and the brilliance of Doc Severinsen in the original Tonight Show Band. I used to <b>think</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was a kid what a great job that must be â€“ you know, same place, every time, everyday. Lo and behold, here I am 40 years later, doing it. That sounds deep, deep, deep, deep, deeply satisfying to me." [...] On September 25, Weinberg left The Tonight Show again for two months, to join Springsteen and band for the final, American portion of the Working on a Dream Tour. [...] The same drum-riser-to-float comedy bit was used, except this time the float was [...] "hit" [...] and demolished by a truck just outside the studio (and airing of the segment was delayed a few days due to O'Brien legitimately injuring himself during the same show). [...] The tour wrapped on November 22, 2009, in Buffalo, New York; Weinberg was back on The Tonight Show the next day. [...] With no E Street Band projects in sight {{for at least the next}} year or two, Weinberg was left to concentrate on his bandleader role.|$|E

I <b>think</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> am a little bit older it is definitely something I'd like to pursue." [...] In another interview, she said: [...] "My musical career is indefinitely on hold. I don't like people who become like 'actor slash singer.' I think people should be one or the other because usually you're not going to be great at both. You're going to be better at one, so you might as well stick to the one you're good at. I'm going for acting." ...|$|E

It goes on {{performances}} too well in this game, so I've... been put in the back for a while." [...] He added that [...] "When I finish up , I'll finish up completely. I've been playing first-class cricket for about 10 years and what cricket's given to me I think I've put back into it. It's taken a lot of time out of my life and. I'm married and I've got two kids and I think I've sacrificed a lot in those 10 years just to play cricket, so I <b>think</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> [...] finish I'll finish with cricket and start something else".|$|E
