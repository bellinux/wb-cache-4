25|$|The {{story was}} recounted in Ibn Ishaq's Sīrah. On {{his way to}} murder Muhammad, Umar met his best friend Nua'im bin Abdullah who had {{secretly}} converted to Islam but had not told Umar. When Umar informed {{him that he had}} set out to kill Muhammad, Nua'im said, “By God, you have deceived yourself, O Umar! Do you think that Banu Abd Manaf would let you run around alive once you had killed their son Muhammad? Why don't you return <b>to</b> <b>your</b> <b>own</b> house and at least set it straight?”.|$|E

500|$|The novel skims {{over the}} brutal attacks, lasting a week, on blacks in Detroit during World WarII. Years later, in 1967, Lefty is {{incorrectly}} told that that year's Detroit riots were started {{by a black}} man raping a white woman; this falsehood is never rectified. However, despite this misinformation, Lefty denies service {{to a number of}} white customers who partook in the riots. One dismissed customer even yells at him, [...] "hy don't you go back <b>to</b> <b>your</b> <b>own</b> country?", returning the spotlight of racial prejudice on him.|$|E
500|$|The Hands {{also became}} close friends of Cornish {{resident}} Louis Dow, a Dartmouth College professor. Frances Hand spent {{increasing amounts of}} time with Dow while her husband was in New York, and tension crept into the marriage. Despite speculation, however, {{there is no evidence}} that she and Dow were lovers. Hand regretted Frances' long absences and urged her to spend more time with him, but he maintained an enduring friendship with Dow. He blamed himself for a lack of insight into his wife's needs in the early years of the marriage, confessing his [...] "blindness and insensibility to what you wanted and to your right <b>to</b> <b>your</b> <b>own</b> ways when they differed from mine". Fearing he might otherwise lose her altogether, Hand came to accept Frances' desire to spend time in the country with another man.|$|E

500|$|Physical {{copies of}} the album feature {{different}} packaging with a cover image of drummer Larry Mullen Jr. protectively embracing his then-18-year-old son while both are shirtless. The image was taken by photographer Glen Luchford initially as an experiment, but the group thought it worked as a visual metaphor for the album and its theme of [...] "how holding on <b>to</b> <b>your</b> <b>own</b> innocence is {{a lot harder than}} holding on to someone else's". Bono said, [...] "With this record we were looking for the raw, naked and personal, to strip everything back." [...] According to Bono, the tattoo on Mullen's upper arm is based on Native American mythology of the Pawnee tribe and is a symbol of protecting innocence. The cover parallels those of the band's earlier albums, Boy (1980) and War (1983), which featured the face of a young boy, Peter Rowen, the younger brother of Guggi.|$|E
500|$|Steven Moffat {{left his}} job as an English teacher at Cowdenknowes High in Greenock to write the BAFTA-award winning show Press Gang. However, its high cost {{and changes in the}} {{executive}} structure at Central Independent Television meant that the show might not be recommissioned after its second series. As the writer wondered what to do next and was worried about future employment, Bob Spiers, Press Gangs primary director, suggested that he meet with producer Andre Ptaszynski to discuss writing a sitcom. Inspired by his experience in education (in addition to his own former career, his father was a headteacher), the writer's initial proposal was similar to what would become Chalk. However, Ptaszynski realised that Moffat was talking more passionately at the meeting at the Groucho Club about his impending divorce and suggested that he write about that instead. That idea became Joking Apart, which received low audience figures but a high rating on the Appreciation Index. In an interview with The Herald, Moffat reflected on the nature of writing from experience: [...] "I don't think you have an alternative to writing about what you know. You've no life experience to go on other than your own. Even if you're writing something you think is entirely remote from you - Star Trek, for instance - you'll find the finished result is actually very close <b>to</b> <b>your</b> <b>own</b> experience. That's not a conscious decision a writer makes - it's an inevitability." ...|$|E

[...] This was not simply because he would {{not live up to}} her expectations. [...] She desired to think of Tchaikovsky as her ideal of a composer-cum-philosopher, much like the Übermensch or Superman about whom Friedrich Nietzsche would write. Tchaikovsky understood this, writing to Meck, [...] "You are quite right, Nadezhda Filaretovna, to suppose that I am of a disposition sympathetic <b>to</b> <b>your</b> <b>own</b> unusual spiritual feelings, which I understand completely." ...|$|E
2500|$|Blas Galindo and I went to Alvarado, one of {{the places}} where folkloric music is {{preserved}} in its most pure form; we were collecting melodies, rhythms and instrumentations during several days. The transcription of it was very difficult because the huapangueros (musicians) never sang the same melody twice in the same way. When I came back to Mexico, I showed the collected material to Candelario Huízar; Huízar gave me a piece of advice that I will always be grateful for: [...] "Expose the material first in the same way you heard it and develop it later according <b>to</b> <b>your</b> <b>own</b> thought."

He writes scores, write the parts for {{everybody}} just as he wants them to sound. ... Wayne also brought in a kind of curiosity about working with musical rules.

You give this interpretation to this verse, whereas it was revealed concerning us the Ansar. When Allah had actually given honor to Islam and its supporters had become many, whereupon some of us secretly said to one another... 'Our wealth has been depleted, and Allah has given honor to Islam and its supporters have become many, let us stay amidst our wealth and make up what has been depleted of it.' Thereupon, Allah revealed to Muhammad, 'And spend in the Path of God (فِي سَبِيلِ اللّهِ), and do not contribute <b>to</b> <b>your</b> <b>own</b> destruction'... refuting what we had said.
