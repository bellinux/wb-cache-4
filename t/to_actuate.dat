25|$|Recent {{mountain}} bicycles with {{rear suspension}} systems have a pivoting rear triangle <b>to</b> <b>actuate</b> the rear shock absorber.

25|$|There are an {{increasing}} number of ideas coming into the market place to extend the options for openhole completions; for example, electronics can be used <b>to</b> <b>actuate</b> a self-opening or self-closing liner valve. This might be used in an openhole completion to improve clean-up, by bringing the well onto production from the toe-end for 100 days, then self-opening the heel-end. Inflow control devices and intelligent completions are also installed as openhole completions.|$|E
25|$|The {{mechanical}} {{advantage of the}} brake lever must be matched to the brake it is connected to {{in order for the}} rider to have sufficient leverage and travel <b>to</b> <b>actuate</b> the brake. Using mismatched brakes and levers could result in too much {{mechanical advantage}} and hence not enough travel to properly actuate the brake (v-brakes with conventional levers) or too little mechanical advantage, requiring a very strong pull to apply the brakes hard (v-brake levers with other types of brake).|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{deals with}} {{gyroscopic}} stabilization of platform. The platform consists of parallelogram, cardan frame and two contra- rotating gyroscopes. The whole system is described with five generalized coordinates and with two cyclic coordinates. We created {{a prototype of}} platform, which rotate around one axis. The prototype is designed {{with respect to a}} simple way to extend the rotation about the second axis and paralelogram. The rotary frame is driven by the gyroscope. Pneumatic motors are used <b>to</b> <b>actuating</b> gyroscopes. Pneumatic springs are used <b>to</b> <b>actuating</b> rotating frame. This paper shows also control system of platform and it introduces reached results of stabilization...|$|R
40|$|An {{active control}} device for {{reducing}} blade-vortex interactions (BVI) noise {{generated by a}} rotorcraft, such as a helicopter, comprises a trailing edge flap located near the tip {{of each of the}} rotorcraft's rotor blades. The flap may be actuated in any conventional way, and is scheduled <b>to</b> be <b>actuated</b> <b>to</b> a deflected position during rotation of the rotor blade through predetermined regions of the rotor azimuth, and is further scheduled <b>to</b> be <b>actuated</b> <b>to</b> a retracted position through the remaining regions of the rotor azimuth. Through the careful azimuth-dependent deployment and retraction of the flap over the rotor disk, blade tip vortices which are the primary source for BVI noise are (a) made weaker and (b) pushed farther away from the rotor disk (that is, larger blade-vortex separation distances are achieved) ...|$|R

25|$|The {{most common}} caliper design uses a single {{hydraulically}} actuated piston within a cylinder, although high performance brakes use {{as many as}} twelve. Modern cars use different hydraulic circuits <b>to</b> <b>actuate</b> the brakes on each set of wheels as a safety measure. The hydraulic design also helps multiply braking force. The number of pistons in a caliper {{is often referred to}} as the number of 'pots', so if a vehicle has 'six pot' calipers it means that each caliper houses six pistons.|$|E
25|$|Dump valves {{are used}} to release air from the bag when in the water. They can be {{operated}} manually at the valve by a diver or may be remotely operated by a pull-cord, which may be operated by a diver or attached to a weight which will automatically open the valve if the weight is lifted off the bottom. Some dump valves can be operated in both these ways. One system operates by pressing on the top or pulling a line attached to the bottom <b>to</b> <b>actuate</b> the spring-loaded valve. The dump valve may be a screw-in quick change system, and the spring tension may be adjustable.|$|E
25|$|Water {{and steam}} based central heating systems have {{traditionally}} had overall control by wall-mounted bi-metallic strip thermostats. These sense the air temperature using the differential expansion of two metals <b>to</b> <b>actuate</b> an on/off switch. Typically the central {{system would be}} switched on when the temperature drops below the set point on the thermostat, and switched off when it rises above, with a few degrees of hysteresis to prevent excessive switching. Bi-metallic sensing is now being superseded by electronic sensors. A principal use of the bi-metallic thermostat today is in individual electric convection heaters, where control is on/off, based on the local air temperature and the set point desired by the user. These are also used on air-conditioners, where local control is required.|$|E

Several reeds can be mounted in the tube for different level indications by one assembly.|$|R
25|$|The chief {{designer}} of most Ducati motorcycles in the 1950s was Fabio Taglioni (1920–2001). His designs {{ranged from the}} small single-cylinder machines that were successful in the Italian 'street races' to the large-capacity twins of the 1980s. Ducati introduced the Pantah in 1979; its engine was updated in the 1990s in the Ducati SuperSport (SS) series. All modern Ducati engines are derivatives of the Pantah, which uses a toothed belt <b>to</b> <b>actuate</b> the engine's valves. Taglioni used the Cavallino Rampante (identified with the Ferrari brand) on his Ducati motorbikes, Taglioni chose this emblem of courage and daring {{as a sign of}} respect and admiration for Francesco Baracca, a heroic World War I fighter pilot who died during an air raid in 1918.|$|E
25|$|The SA.4 was {{designed}} for a crew of five: pilot, copilot, bombardier ("air bomber"), navigator and radio operator. The prone bombardier's position was a tube extending forward of the cockpit above the radome; the crew compartment being pressurized. These positions were fitted with opaque nosecones, as the Sperrins were never used for live bombing. The pilot was {{the only member of}} the crew to have a Martin-Baker-produced ejector seat underneath a jettisonable roof panel; other crew members were intended to bail out via a door located under the navigator's console. The other three crew positions were located behind the pilots, facing rearwards. Unusually, the pilot's flying controls lacked any direct connection to the aircraft's flight control surfaces, control input was instead directed into a gearbox <b>to</b> <b>actuate</b> rotatable ball-screw jacks to move each flight surface via aerodynamic load instead; a corresponding artificial feel system was also installed. Bill Gunston and Peter Gilchrist describe the control system as having been simple, light, reliable, and low-friction and contrast it positively against powered systems of the era.|$|E

2500|$|Bicycles with drop {{handlebars}} {{may have}} more than one brake lever for each brake to facilitate braking from multiple hand positions. [...] Levers that allow the rider to work the brakes from the tops of the bars, introduced in the '70s, are called extension levers, safety levers [...] or, for their reputation for being unable <b>to</b> <b>actuate</b> the full range of travel of the main brake lever, suicide levers. Modern top-mounted brake levers, called interrupt brake levers, use an entirely different method of actuation and are considered safer.|$|E
2500|$|The optimum {{data rate}} {{used to drive}} the Selectric {{mechanism}} {{turned out to be}} equivalent to 134.5 baud, which was a highly unusual data rate before the appearance of the mechanism. [...] Driving the Selectric mechanism at the more-standard rate of 110 baud appeared to work well, although at a slightly slower speed. [...] However, driving the mechanism at a non-optimal rate would soon result in its failure, by forcing an internal start-stop clutch <b>to</b> <b>actuate</b> for each character typed, thus wearing it out very rapidly. Continuous typing at the proper 134.5 baud rate would engage the clutch only {{at the beginning and end}} of a long sequence of characters, as designed.|$|E

2500|$|Dual-action or {{double-action}} airbrushes {{enable the}} simultaneous adjustment of both air and color at the trigger, {{by allowing the}} user <b>to</b> <b>actuate</b> air by depressing the trigger and simultaneously adjust color by sliding the trigger back and forth. [...] This ability to adjust color flow while spraying the airbrush, coupled with the users adjustment of distance from the sprayed surface allows for the variation of fine to wide lines without stopping to re-adjust the spray pattern as is necessary with a single-action airbrush. [...] This allows for greater spray control and enables {{a wider variety of}} artistic effects. [...] This type of airbrush requires some amount of practice to become proficient in triggering technique and control, but it offers greater artistic versatility to the artists once the triggering technique is learned. Dual-action airbrushes (Badger Patriot 105, Paasche VL, Iwata CM-C are all good examples of dual-action airbrushes) are of a more sophisticated design model than single-action airbrushes, which tends to make them the more expensive of the two.|$|E
2500|$|The Hurricane was {{furnished}} with a laterally-retracting undercarriage, the main undercarriage units {{being able to}} slide into recesses within the wing. Hinged telescopic Vickers-built legs {{are attached to the}} bottom boom of the wing's forward spar, but with a complex [...] "pintle" [...] angle setup within the wing {{at the top of the}} strut, to allow the strut to be angled forwards when extended, and rearwards when retracted to clear the forward spar. A hydraulic jack served <b>to</b> <b>actuate</b> the undercarriage, folding and pivoting the legs as to reposition the wheel unit rearwards well as inwards in order to clear the front spar when retracted. Two separate hydraulic systems, one being power-operated and the other hand operated, are present for the deployment and retraction of the undercarriage; in the event of both failing, pilots can release the retaining catches holding the undercarriage in place, deploying the wheels to the 'down' position using weight alone. A wide wheel-track was used to allow for considerable stability during ground movements and to enable tight turns to be performed.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{all three}} G1 cyclins are {{necessary}} for normal regulation of Start and the G1-S transition, Cln3 activity {{seems to be the}} deciding factor in S-phase initiation, with Cln1 and Cln2 serving <b>to</b> <b>actuate</b> the Cln3-based decision to transit Start. It was found early on that Cln3 activity induced expression of Cln1 and Cln2. Furthermore, Cln3 was a stronger activator Start transit than Cln1 and Cln2, even though Cln3-CDK had an inherently weaker kinase activity than the other Clns. This indicated that Cln3 was an upstream regulator of Cln1 and Cln2. Furthermore, it was found, as shown in Figure 1, that Cln1 and Cln2 could activate their own transcription via SBF, completing a positive feedback loop that could contribute to rapid activation and S-phase entry. Thus, Start transit seems to rely on reaching a sufficient level of Cln3-CDK activity to induce the Cln1,2 positive feedback loop, which rapidly increases SBF/MBF and Cln1,2 activity, allowing a switch-like G1-S transition. The role of positive feedback in this process has been challenged, [...] but recent experiments have confirmed its importance for rapid inactivation and nuclear export of Whi5, [...] which is the molecular basis of commitment to S-phase.|$|E
