50|$|Backspace is the {{keyboard}} key that originally pushed the <b>typewriter</b> <b>carriage</b> one position backwards, and in modern computer systems moves the display cursor one position backwards, deletes the character at that position, and shifts back the text after that position by one position.|$|E
5000|$|The symbol {{underscore}} _ [...] (also called underline, underbar, low line, or low dash) is {{a character}} that originally appeared on the typewriter and was primarily used to underline words. To produce an underlined word, the word was typed, the <b>typewriter</b> <b>carriage</b> was {{moved back to the}} beginning of the word, and the word was overtyped with the underscore character.|$|E
50|$|The {{machine was}} {{programmed}} primarily {{with a plastic}} tape that moved synchronously with the <b>typewriter</b> <b>carriage.</b> Each tape would typically handle one application. The tape mechanism was mounted behind the carriage in the typewriter unit. Further programming was provided in the card machines program drums. Programs were only executed as the machine typed or spaced over a column - tabbing or carriage returning was not recognised.|$|E
2500|$|Pink Floyd used a <b>typewriter,</b> {{complete}} with <b>carriage</b> return bell, as a percussion instrument on their song [...] "Money" [...] (1973) ...|$|R
25|$|Woolley’s {{passion for}} {{lacrosse}} extended to providing {{a voice to}} the local media. Before the time of hiring media relations personnel, Harry {{had the ability to}} market lacrosse through self-promotion. Sports columnist Glyn Lewis of The Columbian newspaper in New Westminster, BC published an article saying: “Pushing deadline the other day, The Woolley Jumper attracted some mild attention by standing in the line of my <b>typewriter’s</b> return <b>carriage.</b> He wasn’t about to move until he’d been heard”.|$|R
2500|$|Instead of the [...] "basket" [...] of {{individual}} typebars that swung up {{to strike the}} ribbon and page in a traditional typewriter, the Selectric had a type element (frequently called a [...] "typeball", or more informally, a [...] "golf ball") that rotated and pivoted to the correct position before striking. The type element could be easily changed so as to print different fonts in the same document, resurrecting a capability that had been pioneered by the Blickensderfer typewriter almost 70 years before. The Selectric also replaced the traditional <b>typewriter's</b> moving <b>carriage</b> with a paper roller ("platen") that stayed in position while the typeball and ribbon mechanism moved from side to side.|$|R
5000|$|As the <b>typewriter</b> <b>carriage</b> {{moved from}} field to field three program entries were {{available}} {{in the last three}} columns of each field - as I recall they were Calc1, Calc2, and Pgm. One calculation was allowed in each Calc column. The PGM field allowed a program instruction - a jump {{in the form of a}} [...] "jump" [...] to a new column then auto printout of a calculated field (including decimal place control) as well as punched card control, etc. The PGM column was actually the column the typewriter would space to after typing the last character in the field (either under operator or PGM control).|$|E
50|$|The {{limit of}} the line length in 70-80 {{characters}} may well be originated from various technical limitations of various equipment. The American teletypewriters could type only 72 CPL, while the British ones even less, 70 CPL. In the era of typewriters, most designs of the <b>typewriter</b> <b>carriage</b> were limited to 80-90 CPL. The most widespread and standard paper size in the US (8.5×11") also has been imposing limitations on the line length: {{it is possible to}} print only 85 or 102 characters (with the font size either 10 or 12 characters per inch) without margins on the typewriter. With various margins (usually from 1 to 1.5 inches for each side, but there is no strict standard) these numbers may shrink to 55-78 CPL.|$|E
5000|$|Burroughs also advertised an {{electric}} model in 1906. At that time, Burroughs machines ranged {{in price from}} $300 to $500 depending on model. Burroughs manufactured its 50,000th machine in 1907 and claimed that the 13,300 machines that it sold during 1907 exceeded [...] "the combined sales of all other makes of adding machines during {{all the years of}} their existence." [...] In 1908 Burroughs offered 58 models, [...] "One built for every line of business." [...] The many models varied in number of columns, the width of the paper onto which they printed, whether they were designed for computations involving fractions, feet and inches, pounds and ounces, etc., and whether they had features such as counters and split keyboards. In 1908 Burroughs also stated that [...] "Nine out of ten adding machines in use are Burroughs." [...] That same year Burroughs also acquired the Universal Adding Machine Co. which described its products as [...] "A <b>Typewriter</b> <b>Carriage</b> on an Adding Machine." [...] In 1909, Burroughs acquired the Pike Adding Machine Co. and in the same year began to sell Burroughs Pike visible adding machines.|$|E
5000|$|A second common modern English {{style is}} to use no indenting, but add {{vertical}} white space to create [...] "block paragraphs." [...] On a <b>typewriter,</b> a double <b>carriage</b> return produces a blank line for this purpose; professional typesetters (or word processing software) may put in an arbitrary vertical space by adjusting leading. This style is very common in electronic formats, such as on the World Wide Web and email.|$|R
5000|$|In early designs, some {{characters}} were produced by printing two symbols with the carriage {{in the same}} position. For instance, the exclamation point, which shares a key with the numeral 1 on modern keyboards, could be reproduced by using a three-stroke combination of an apostrophe, a backspace, and a period. A semicolon ( [...] ;) was produced by printing a comma ( [...] ,) over a colon (:). As the backspace key is slow in simple mechanical <b>typewriters</b> (the <b>carriage</b> was heavy and optimized {{to move in the}} opposite direction), a more professional approach was to block the carriage by pressing and holding the space bar while printing all characters that needed to be in a shared position. To make this possible, the carriage was designed to advance forward only after releasing the space bar.|$|R
5000|$|The {{inherent}} {{ambiguity of}} many control characters, combined with their historical usage, created problems when transferring [...] "plain text" [...] files between systems. The {{best example of}} this is the newline problem on various operating systems. Teletype machines required that a line of text be terminated with both [...] "Carriage Return" [...] (which moves the printhead {{to the beginning of the}} line) and [...] "Line Feed" [...] (which advances the paper one line without moving the printhead). The name [...] "Carriage Return" [...] comes from the fact that on a manual <b>typewriter</b> the <b>carriage</b> holding the paper moved while the position where the typebars struck the ribbon remained stationary. The entire carriage had to be pushed (returned) to the right in order to position the left margin of the paper for the next line.|$|R
2500|$|In 1973 the Correcting Selectric II was announced. It {{added an}} {{internal}} correction feature to the Selectric II, intended {{to eliminate the}} need for typists to use cover-up tape, [...] "white-out" [...] correction fluid, or <b>typewriter</b> erasers. The <b>carriage</b> on this machine held both the main typing ribbon cartridge and two small spools for a correction ribbon. A new ribbon type, the Correctable Film ribbon, was introduced at the same time. This produced typing quality equal to the carbon film ribbon, but with a pigment designed to be easily removable from paper.|$|R
50|$|In a {{diversification}} {{move into}} the wider office technology sector, Smith Corona purchased the Kleinschmidt Corporation in 1956 and Marchant Calculator in 1958, changing its corporate name to Smith-Corona Marchant Inc. Also in 1958, Smith Corona acquired British Typewriters, Ltd. of West Bromwich, England, a company that made small portable typewriters. The company invented the <b>typewriter</b> power <b>carriage</b> return in 1960, the same year it moved from Syracuse to Cortland, New York and opened new corporate headquarters on Park Avenue in New York City. 1960 also saw the company's first foray into the photocopier business with the Vivicopy range of machines, also the accounting machinery market {{with a range of}} punch card and tape products manufactured for it in Germany by Kienzle. Still on the acquisition trail, SCM acquired the St. Louis Microstatic Company in 1961. This merger gave rise to the Model 33 Electrostatic Copier, which went on sale in April 1962.|$|R
5000|$|The idea {{stayed in}} Bare's head {{for two years}} before he decided to pursue it. [...] "I had a script I had written called The Squirrel which had been on the market but hadn't sold, so I just cut it up and patched scenes {{together}} here and there to make two parallel scripts." [...] The script pages were divided in half, with each half of the page corresponding to what was to appear on screen. Finding a typewriter that could accommodate these unique needs proved challenging for the writer. [...] "My first problem was findinga <b>typewriter</b> with a <b>carriage</b> wide enough to take a legal-size piece of paper sideways, so I could type parallel scripts," [...] Bare said. [...] "Then I had to find a duplicating machine that would do the same thing." ...|$|R
50|$|Kott's artists {{statement}} reads: I studied art {{in college}} but never pursued it until I was well {{established as a}} professional scriptwriter in Hollywood. Several factors were responsible for my eventual transition from pen to paint, most importantly a stack of eight-foot by ten-foot sheets of plywood found {{in the basement of}} a new house I bought. A week before I’d seen a large, expensive painting in a gallery, a bold color field of red and black. Hmm, I thought, these sheets of plywood were exactly the same size. A quick trip to the local art supply store and I had my first color field hanging over my bed, joined soon by eight-foot by ten-foot color fields in the living room and den. In time I expanded into multi-dimensional sculptures made from junk I treasure-hunted in landfills and city dumps. I was delighted to see people enjoy my <b>typewriters</b> made from <b>carriage</b> bolts and ABS pipe, my seven-foot, found-object guitars oozing in reds, blues, and greens. My paintings moved from plywood to canvas, my color-fields from free-flowing drips to tightly controlled stripes. My evolution from pen to paint has been an exploration of anything and everything I dream up, always capturing images and notions where words fail me.|$|R
