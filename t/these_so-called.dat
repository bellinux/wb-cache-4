Each light and dark bar correspond to around 24 hours and the use of this technique has been called ptilochronology (analogous to dendrochronology).|$|E
5|$|Tuberous sundews: These nearly 50 Australian species form an {{underground}} tuber {{to survive the}} extremely dry summers of their habitat, re-emerging in the autumn. <b>These</b> <b>so-called</b> tuberous sundews can be further divided into two groups, those that form rosettes and those that form climbing or scrambling stems. Tuberous sundews comprise the subgenus Ergaleium.|$|E
5|$|Theodoxus fluviatilis littoralis (Linnaeus, 1789)– was {{described}} from brackish water by Linnaeus {{as a separate}} species, originally named Nerita littoralis. A study by Zettler (2008) proved that {{its status as a}} subspecies is unjustified, being regarded as a synonym of Theodoxus fluviatilis. Although <b>these</b> <b>so-called</b> forms (form fluviatilis and form littoralis) differ in morphology, ecology, reproductive strategy and behaviour, they are probably just ecomorphs.|$|E

5|$|<b>These</b> <b>so-called</b> non-coding RNAs ("ncRNA") can be encoded {{by their}} own genes (RNA genes), but can also derive from mRNA introns. The most {{prominent}} examples of non-coding RNAs are transfer RNA (tRNA) and ribosomal RNA (rRNA), {{both of which are}} involved in the process of translation. There are also non-coding RNAs involved in gene regulation, RNA processing and other roles. Certain RNAs are able to catalyse chemical reactions such as cutting and ligating other RNA molecules, and the catalysis of peptide bond formation in the ribosome; these are known as ribozymes.|$|E
5|$|The {{leaders of}} <b>these</b> <b>so-called</b> Lords Ordainers were Robert Winchelsey, Archbishop of Canterbury, {{on the side}} of the clergy, and Warwick, Lincoln and Lancaster among the earls. Henry de Lacy, Earl of Lincoln, was the most {{experienced}} of the earls, and took on a modifying role in the group. Thomas of Lancaster, who was Lincoln's son-in-law and heir, was the king's cousin and the wealthiest nobleman in the realm, but at this point he took a less active part in the reform movement. Warwick is described by some sources as the leader of the Ordainers; he was certainly the most aggressive. The set of Ordinances they drafted put heavy restrictions on the king's financial freedom, and his right to appoint his own ministers. It alsoonce moreordered Gaveston to be exiled, to return only at the risk of excommunication.|$|E
5|$|The slender teeth had {{slightly}} curved crowns, {{which were}} oval in cross-section. The {{teeth in the}} lower jaw may have been 20–30% smaller {{than those in the}} upper jaw, but few are known, and they are of uncertain maturity. Apart from this, the teeth were identical. Under each active tooth there was a column of nine replacement teeth within the jaw. With 68 columns in the upper jaws and 60 columns in the lower jaws, <b>these</b> <b>so-called</b> dental batteries (also present in hadrosaurs and ceratopsians) comprised a total of more than 500 active and replacement teeth. Dental batteries erupted in unison, not each column individually. The enamel on the teeth of Nigersaurus was highly asymmetrical, ten times thicker on the outwards facing side than on the inner side. This condition is otherwise known only in advanced ornithischians.|$|E

5|$|One {{thousand}} {{years before the}} events in the game, on a floating continent hovering high above the surface of an unnamed planet, a technologically advanced civilization sought to harness the power of the four elemental crystals of light. They did not realize that they could not control such fundamental forces of nature. This power of light would have consumed the world itself had the light crystals not had their natural counterparts: the four dark elemental crystals. Disturbed by the sudden interruption of the careful balance between light and dark, four warriors were granted the power of the dark crystals to recapture the power of the light crystals. <b>These</b> <b>so-called</b> Dark Warriors succeeded in their quest, and restored harmony to the world. But their victory came too late to save the doomed civilization, whose culture was reduced to ruin, though their floating continent remained. On that continent, the circle of Gulgans, a race of blind soothsayers and fortune-tellers, predicted that these events will ultimately repeat.|$|E

25|$|However, some {{plastics}} are partially crystalline {{and partially}} amorphous in molecular structure, giving them both a melting point, the temperature {{at which the}} attractive intermolecular forces are overcome, and also one or more glass transitions, the temperatures above which the extent of localized molecular flexibility is substantially increased. <b>These</b> <b>so-called</b> semi-crystalline plastics include: polyethylene, polypropylene, polyvinyl chloride, polyamides (nylons), polyesters and some polyurethanes.|$|E
25|$|Cancer {{cells with}} {{properties}} similar to stem cells {{have been found}} in glioblastomas (this may be a cause of their resistance to conventional treatments, and high recurrence rate). <b>These</b> <b>so-called</b> glioblastoma stem-like cells reside in a niche around arterioles, which protects these cells against therapy by maintaining a relatively hypoxic environment.

25|$|For instance, during {{at least}} the last 100,000 years, {{portions}} of the ice sheet covering much of North America, the Laurentide ice sheet broke apart sending large flotillas of icebergs into the North Atlantic.

25|$|The Villanovan {{culture in}} Italy {{introduced}} {{a series of}} variations of the bow fibula in the 8th and 7th centuries BC. In <b>these</b> <b>so-called</b> Italianate fibulae, the bow begins, at the head, with a semi-circular form, but bends at its apex to angle straight down to the foot that was often lengthened and extended. The bow was often decorated with moulded knobs or spikes. The rear half of the bow was sometimes bent into a wavy, kinked shape. The latter variants were known as serpentine fibulae.|$|E
25|$|A {{wall was}} soon erected around Ommen, {{including}} three gates: the Vechtpoort or Voorbruggenpoort (on {{the bank of}} the Vecht), the Varsenerpoort (on the western wall for traffic with Varsen) and the Arriërpoort (on the northern wall for traffic with Arriën). Even to this day, the two bells in the church's belltower, named Maria and Salvator and cast in 1517 by Hendrick de Tremonia of Dordrecht, are rung every evening at nine o'clock. <b>These</b> <b>so-called</b> Ave-Maria peals form a custom which traces its origin to the tradition of ringing the bell at the closing of the gates.
