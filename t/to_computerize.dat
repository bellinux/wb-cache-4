25|$|As mayor, he paid {{particular}} attention to the elementary education of children by improving and renovating school buildings, constructing additional school structures, health centers, barangay halls and playgrounds in all the barangays and providing artesian wells to areas with low water supply. He relocated some 1,800 squatter families out of San Juan to Taytay, Rizal, at no cost. He was also the first mayor <b>to</b> <b>computerize</b> assessment of the Real Estate Tax in the Municipal Assessor's Office. When Corazon Aquino assumed the presidency in 1986, all elected officials of the local government were forcibly removed and replaced by appointed officers-in-charge, including Estrada.|$|E
25|$|In {{the three}} years before the Rose Revolution, foreign {{financial}} support for the regime began to become severely limited. Instead, foreign states and organizations gave financial assistance to NGOs and opposition parties within Georgia, worsening the desperate budget situation of the Shevardnadze government. The United States announced a reduction in aid, coinciding with {{a decision by the}} International Monetary Fund (IMF) to suspend aid to Georgia. As international support for the regime deteriorated (particularly in the West), public perceptions of Shevardnadze's political weakness increased. A significant source of funding for NGOs and election monitoring organizations came from foreign governments and individuals. The U.S. and European governments gave the OSCE (Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe) the funds to support foreign election observers. The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)§ spent $1.5 million <b>to</b> <b>computerize</b> Georgia's voter rolls. The Open Society Institute (OSI), funded by George Soros, supported Mikheil Saakashvili and a network of pro-democratic organizations. The OSI additionally paid for a number of student activists to go to Serbia and learn from Serbians who had helped to topple Slobodan Milošević in 2000. Western democracy promoters also circulated public opinion polls and scrutinized election data throughout Georgia.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{the party}} infighting, Whitcomb {{was able to}} {{successfully}} advocate for {{the passage of a}} number of bills to expand the state highway system, to repeal laws passed during his predecessors’ terms that distributed funds to the county governments and <b>to</b> <b>computerize</b> both the state's criminal records and its Bureau of Motor Vehicles. Significant constitutional development took place during his term. Also on the ballot during his election campaign were a number of constitutional amendments, among them a reorganization of the state court system, changing the legislatures sessions to occur annually rather than biennially, a change that would allow governors to begin serving consecutive terms again, and the placing of a new cabinet position(s) in the constitution. Whitcomb however, could not run for a second term because he had been elected under the prior version of the constitution. Another significant event occurred during his first months in office when the Indiana Supreme Court ruled that the pocket veto was unconstitutional, which passed into law several bills that had been pocket vetoed by his predecessors. Whitcomb requested that General Assembly pass an act repealing all laws that were enacted because of the Supreme Court decision, some of which were nearly a century old. The assembly complied with the request and passed a blanket repeal.|$|E

2500|$|The Office of Management and Budget {{reported}} that $54 billion in [...] "improper payments" [...] {{were made to}} Medicare ($24B), Medicaid ($18B) and Medicaid Advantage ($12B) during FY 2009. This was 9.4% of the $573 billion spent in these categories. The Government Accountability Office lists Medicare as a [...] "high-risk" [...] government program due to its vulnerability to improper payments. [...] Fewer than 5% of Medicare claims are audited. [...] Medicare fraud accounts for an estimated $60 billion in Medicare payments each year, and [...] "has become one of, if not the most profitable, crimes in America." [...] Criminals set up phony companies, then invoice Medicare for fraudulent services provided to valid Medicare patients who never receive the services. These costs appear on the Medicare statements provided to Medicare card holders. The program pays out over $430 billion per year via over 1 billion claims, making enforcement challenging. Its enforcement budget is [...] "extremely limited" [...] according to one Medicare official. U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said in an interview: [...] "Clearly more auditing {{needs to be done}} {{and it needs to be}} done in real time." [...] The Obama administration is providing Medicare with an additional $200 million to fight fraud as part of its stimulus package, and billions of dollars <b>to</b> <b>computerize</b> medical records and upgrade networks, which should assist Medicare in identifying fraudulent claims.|$|E
