40|$|Digital Human Modeling {{programs}} are important tools in virtual manufacturing that allow simulation of manual assembly work, long before any physical product has been built. By investigating the logistics, ergonomics {{and the interaction}} among the workers at an early stage, {{it may be possible}} to reduce the cost of design changes, increase the quality and to decrease the ramp-up time of a manufacturing process. However, far from all assembly operations are simulated, even if all the necessary data is available. One reason is the tedious work required to setup and to define all the motions needed by a manikin to perform a simulation. In each simulation, <b>the</b> <b>manikin</b> must be adjusted into the desired posture and the user must ensure that balance is held and that it avoids collision with objects in the environment. Thus, even a small case may be time consuming to simulate. This shows that there is a need of an easier way of instructing <b>the</b> <b>manikins.</b> In this work we propose a new formal high-level language for controlling an automated <b>manikin.</b> <b>The</b> language instructions are structured by a grammar, which defines a hierarchical tree for <b>the</b> <b>manikin</b> instructions. <b>The</b> low- level instructions contains basic functionality for maneuvering <b>the</b> <b>manikin,</b> such as Move, Position and Grasp, and higher levels contain more abstract instructions such as Get and Assemble. Thus, the high-level instructions define sequences of other instructions, whereas a low-level instruction corresponds to a direct instruction of <b>the</b> <b>manikin.</b> <b>The</b> set of available instructions that <b>the</b> <b>manikin</b> may perform during a simulation depends on the current state of <b>the</b> <b>manikin</b> and <b>the</b> objects at the assembly station. Thus, properties of objects, such as grasping and mating points, also help define the set of available instructions for <b>the</b> <b>manikin.</b> <b>The</b> order in which the different parts in the assembly operations have to be connected may also be considered when constructing instruction sequences for <b>the</b> <b>manikin.</b> Furthermore, <b>the</b> instruction sequences may be formally verified to ensure that <b>the</b> <b>manikin</b> only performs valid instructions.

40|$|Abstract: A thermal manikin is {{a useful}} tool to {{evaluate}} thermal environments such as clothing, houses and others. A manikin needs to have the following properties: shape and size, heat production, skin temperature, sweat rate, physiological responses and others. So far, no manikin satisfying all these criteria has been available. In the present study, a two-layer movable sweating thermal manikin was newly developed as a trial {{to compensate for the}} differences between conventional thermal <b>manikins</b> and <b>the</b> human body. <b>The</b> <b>manikin</b> consisted of two layers, a core section in the trunk and a shell section divided into 17 parts over the whole body, the temperature and heat supply of which could be independently controlled. <b>The</b> <b>manikin</b> is possible to change the posture and to walk. The sweat rate from 180 pores on the skin was controlled by peristaltic pumps. The temperature performance of <b>the</b> <b>manikin</b> was investigated using thermograph. As a result, the surface temperature of <b>the</b> <b>manikin</b> decreased more in the extremities than in the trunk when <b>the</b> <b>manikin</b> was exposed to 18 °C after being exposed to 28 °C for 20 min. This is analogous to the skin temperature decline in the extremities of the human body...|$|R

50|$|The {{amount of}} heat {{supplied}} to thermal manikins may be controlled in three ways. In “comfort mode” the PMV model equation found in ISO 7730 is applied to <b>the</b> <b>manikin,</b> and <b>the</b> controller software calculates the heat loss an average person would be comfortable undergoing within a given environment. This requires that the system know several basic facts about <b>the</b> <b>manikin</b> (surface area, hypothesized metabolic rate) while experimental factors must be input by the user (clothing insulation, Wet Bulb Globe Temperature). The second control method is constant heat flux from <b>the</b> <b>manikin.</b> That is, <b>the</b> <b>manikin</b> supplies a constant level of power, set by the user, and the skin temperature of the different segments is measured. The third method is that the skin temperature of <b>the</b> <b>manikin</b> is maintained constant at a user-specified value, while the power increases or decreases depending on the environmental conditions. This may arguably be considered a fourth method as well, as one can set <b>the</b> entire <b>manikin</b> to maintain <b>the</b> same temperature in all zones, or choose specific temperatures for each zone. Of these methods, the comfort mode {{is considered to be}} the most accurate representation of the actual heat distribution across the human body, while the heat flux mode is primarily used in high temperature settings (when room temperatures are likely to be above 34 °C).|$|R
40|$|The {{vibration}} attenuation {{performance of}} suspension seats employed in heavy vehicles {{are influenced by}} energy dissipation property of the seated body. Owing to complexities associated with biodynamic response behavior of the human body, the performance assessments of suspension seats are invariably accomplished through laboratory or field experimentation. Such laboratory experiments involve certain safety and ethical concerns, while field measurements yield difficulties in interpretation of the results {{due to lack of}} controlled conditions. In this dissertation, two prototype anthropodynamic manikins, designed to replace human subjects in assessments of seat, are evaluated through laboratory experiments and analyses of the biodynamic responses. The apparent mass (APMS) responses of manikins are characterized under different levels of vibration excitations and three body masses (55 kg, 75 kg and 98 kg). The measured responses are compared with the standardized values to assess the APMS prediction abilities of <b>the</b> <b>manikins.</b> <b>The</b> results suggest the need for deriving more reliable APMS responses of seated humans of particular masses. The applicability of <b>the</b> <b>manikins</b> for seating dynamics is then assessed for a range of seats and vibration spectra of different vehicles. The seat effective acceleration transmissibility (S. E. A. T) of five different seats are measured using human subjects, equivalent inert mass and <b>the</b> prototype <b>manikins.</b> <b>The</b> results suggest that equivalent inert mass could provide reasonably good prediction of seat performance, when excitations dominate in the low frequency range. Under high frequency excitations, the inert mass yields poor estimate of the seat-human system performance, while <b>the</b> <b>manikins</b> provide better estimations. The need for tuning of <b>the</b> <b>manikins</b> was identified to improve their biodynamic response prediction abilities. An analytical model of one of <b>the</b> <b>manikin</b> was thus formulated and analyzed to perform the necessary design refinements. System identification technique was applied to derive uncertain parameters of the model so as to satisfy the measured APMS responses for three body masses. Additional parameter identification was performed to realize desirable parameters that would satisfy the standardized biodynamic response. The results suggested that only minor refinements of the prototype would be needed to enhance the biodynamic response prediction ability of <b>the</b> <b>manikin,</b> which may translate into improved applicability of <b>the</b> <b>manikin</b> for assessment of suspension seats...|$|R

40|$|There {{are about}} a hundred <b>manikin</b> users around <b>the</b> world. Some of them use <b>the</b> <b>manikin</b> such as 'Walter' and 'Tore' to {{evaluate}} the comfort of clothing ensembles according to their thermal insulation and moisture resistance. A 'Walter' manikin is made of water and waterproof breathable fabric 'skin', which simulates the characteristics of human perspiration. So evaporation, condensation or sorption and desorption are always accompanied by heat transfer. A 'Tore' manikin only has dry heat exchange by conduction, radiation and convection from <b>the</b> <b>manikin</b> through clothing ensembles to environments. It is an ideal apparatus to measure the thermal insulation of the clothing ensemble and allows evaluation of thermal comfort. This paper compares thermal insulation measured with dry 'Tore' and sweating 'Walter' manikins. Clothing ensembles consisted of permeable and impermeable clothes. The {{results showed that the}} clothes covering <b>the</b> 'Walter' <b>manikin</b> absorbed <b>the</b> moisture evaporated from <b>the</b> <b>manikin.</b> When <b>the</b> moisture transferred through the permeable clothing ensembles, heat of condensation could be neglected. But it was observed that heavy condensation occurred if impermeable clothes were tested on <b>the</b> 'Walter' <b>manikin.</b> This resulted in a thermal insulation difference of clothing ensembles on the dry and perspiration <b>manikins.</b> <b>The</b> thermal insulation obtained from <b>the</b> 'Walter' <b>manikin</b> has to be modified when heavy condensation occurs.

50|$|To {{obtain the}} most {{accurate}} results possible {{it is necessary to}} calibrate the internal temperature sensors of <b>the</b> thermal <b>manikin.</b> A good calibration will use at least 2 temperature set points minimum 10 °C apart from one another. <b>The</b> <b>manikin</b> is set up in a thermally controlled environmental chamber so that the temperature of all its segments will be nearly identical to the operative temperature of the chamber. This means that <b>the</b> <b>manikin</b> must be unclothed and with minimal insulation between any body part and the air. A good system to achieve this is to have <b>the</b> <b>manikin</b> seated in an open chair (allowing air movement to pass through), with its feet propped up off the ground. Fans should be used to increase air movement in the chamber, ensuring constant mixing. This is acceptable for maintaining a constant temperature as there is no evaporative cooling without sweating or condensation (humidity should be low to ensure no condensation occurs). At each temperature set point <b>the</b> <b>manikin</b> will need to remain in the room for 3 to 6 hours in order to come to steady state conditions. Once equilibrium has been obtained a calibration point may be obtained for each body segment (this {{should be included in the}} control software).|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{project was}} {{formulated}} by Volvo Cars {{to find an}} answer to the question if an investment in a manikin building software was necessary or if <b>the</b> existing <b>manikin</b> eM-RAMSIS could produce valid results when using Motion Capture data to guide it. Motion Capture is a system for recording an objects motion and transforming it to a digital form which can be utilized to guide the motions or postures of various digital objects, in this case computer manikins. A computer manikin is a digital human model and has all the characteristics of a human: joints that are restricted to movements in only some directions, hands that can grasp things etc. These manikins are used by Volvo Cars to simulate working postures for the assembly workers who will work on the assembly lines of future car models. <b>The</b> <b>manikins</b> have been positioned after the best knowledge of the simulation engineer using mouse and keyboard. However with this new technique it is possible to record the actual position of an assembly worker in the Motion Capture lab. Research conducted on the subject of Motion Capture and manikins show that it is crucial that <b>the</b> <b>manikin</b> closely resembles <b>the</b> person recorded. <b>The</b> <b>manikin</b> available for simulation engineers on Volvo Cars is eM-RAMSIS who only has three possible adjustments: length, sitting height and circumference. Thus the question arose whether eM-RAMSIS could produce valid results or not. Three tests were originally carried out to find {{an answer to the}} question. The first test was aimed at examining the markerset used and verifying it, the result being to stick to the original markerset of 42 markers. The second test was designed to try to find some postures where <b>the</b> <b>manikin</b> encountered trouble and the postures identified were further analyzed and used as input {{in the design of the}} main test. This third test was performed by a test group of eleven, six female and five male participants of different anthropometry. The test consisted of different stretching and twisting tasks. The one which caused <b>the</b> <b>manikin</b> <b>the</b> most problems was reaching forward to the maximum while leaning forwards supported by a table frame. This task was extensively analyzed, taking <b>the</b> <b>manikin</b> to a virtual table and measuring how far it could reach and comparing this with the values from the test session. In general <b>the</b> <b>manikin</b> reached shorter than the test objects, in some cases up to 20 cm. Since there were many possible sources of error in the main test it was decided to do a supplementary test where the variables were cut down to a minimum. The position of the feet was exactly marked out on the floor and carefully measured against the table frame. For measuring of the reaching distance a cord with a stripe running on it was fastened on the table frame. This making the fingertip of the test object identified in three dimensions at the extreme of the motion. The test object was accurately positioned on the markings for the feet before the recording started. The analysis of the supplementary test showed the same behavior as the previous test: that <b>the</b> <b>manikin</b> could not reach as far as the actual person. A measurement showed that <b>the</b> <b>manikin</b> had longer arms than the test objects. It would appear that <b>the</b> <b>manikin</b> has some built in limitations as to how it can move and be positioned. When reaching far a human lets the shoulder follow the arm forwards and also twists the back to reach even further, this behavior can not be mimicked by <b>the</b> <b>manikin</b> when using Motion Capture data. To be able to answer the question whether <b>the</b> <b>manikin</b> created with Human Builder would produce better results comparing studies will have to be performed and has not been performed since the software was not available during the course of this thesis project. There has been no behavior observed where it could be determined that it would not have occurred with a more anthropometrically correct <b>manikin.</b> <b>The</b> recommendations which will conclude this project are to do a comparison study using manikins created in Human Builder, to utilize all settings available for <b>the</b> eM-RAMSIS <b>manikin,</b> to unmark markers to instantly create a better manikin posture, to move the Motion Capture cameras when using many props to ensure a better data collection and using additional camera views to collect more photographic material that can be used as reference for judging <b>the</b> <b>manikin</b> posture.
