5|$|An {{estimated}} 0.5% to 10% {{of individuals}} with ASD show unusual abilities, ranging from splinter skills such as the memorization of trivia to the extraordinarily rare talents of prodigious autistic savants. Many individuals with ASD show superior skills in perception and attention, relative to the general population. Sensory abnormalities are found in over 90% of those with autism, and are considered core features by some, {{although there is no}} good evidence that sensory symptoms differentiate autism from other developmental disorders. Differences are greater for under-responsivity (for example, walking into <b>things)</b> <b>than</b> for over-responsivity (for example, distress from loud noises) or for sensation seeking (for example, rhythmic movements). An estimated 60%–80% of autistic people have motor signs that include poor muscle tone, poor motor planning, and toe walking; deficits in motor coordination are pervasive across ASD and are greater in autism proper.|$|E
5|$|The {{change in}} {{partners}} leads the Simpson family to begin arguing and aggressively competing against one another. The tournament takes place, {{and in the}} stands, are leading tennis professionals Andre Agassi, Pete Sampras, Venus Williams, and Serena Williams. At the tournament, Homer ditches Lisa for Venus Williams. In response, Marge replaces Bart with Serena Williams as her partner. Ultimately, Serena and Venus replace Marge and Homer with Sampras and Agassi, respectively. This forces the family {{to go back to}} the bench and resume their normal places in the family. As they enjoy the exhibition of top-class tennis, they agree that it is better to watch <b>things</b> <b>than</b> to do things, and Homer offers to buy the family dinner with money he took from Sampras' wallet.|$|E

25|$|Earth: The earth {{signs are}} Taurus, Virgo, and Capricorn. A native with mainly earth signs will be {{practical}} and cautious, sensible and capable {{and will be}} happier with concrete <b>things</b> <b>than</b> abstract ideas. They move slowly and carry out their work in a thorough and unhurried manner. Earth subjects are shrewd and careful and need emotional and material security, and will put up with quite {{a lot to get}} it. They are generous to those they love, but are otherwise careful not to waste time or money, though there can be a tendency towards meanness. Earth subjects tend to be shy in social situations, and to be slow to commit in love relationships, but are serious when they do. A subject lacking earth signs will lack common sense and practicality and find it difficult to finish anything they start. They may be scatty, unrealistic and clumsy, hopeless with money and unreliable. Planets in the 2nd, 6th and 10th houses and an emphasis on fixed signs in the chart will help to compensate for this lack.|$|E

[...] And in 1777, Johnson said to Boswell [...] "Our ramble {{in the islands}} hangs upon my imagination. I can hardly help imagining that we shall go again. Pennant seems to have seen a great deal which we did not see. When we travel again let us look better about us." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{mayor of}} Lyons {{appointed}} Borah city attorney in 1889, {{but the young}} lawyer {{felt that he was}} destined for bigger <b>things</b> <b>than</b> a small Kansas town suffering in the hard times that persisted on the prairie in the late 1880s and early 1890s. Following the advice attributed to Horace Greeley, Borah chose to go west and grow up with the country. In October 1890, uncertain of his destination, he boarded the Union Pacific Railroad in Omaha. [...] On the advice of a gambler on board the train, Borah decided to settle in Boise, Idaho, for, as his biographer, Marian C. McKenna, put it, [...] "that was as far west as his pocketbook would take him".|$|E

500|$|The writers {{believed}} John's {{separation from}} his sons {{throughout the season}} [...] "split the show" [...] by having him away [...] "doing more interesting <b>things</b> <b>than</b> the boys are doing", with Kripke likewise feeling that John was keeping Sam and Dean away from the [...] "front lines". His death would allow the brothers to [...] "explore, investigate and confront the yellow-eyed demon directly". The writers originally intended for John to die at the episode's end, with Sam and Dean surviving the crash but John dying in their arms. His death, however, was pushed back into the second-season premiere because the writers deemed it too dark to kill John after everything else the brothers had gone through in [...] "Devil's Trap".|$|E
500|$|Early in mid-2009, Stone took LaBeouf to a {{cocktail}} party organized by Nouriel Roubini, a New York University economics professor and chairman of a consulting firm. There, Stone and LaBeouf discussed the financial collapse with Roubini and also discussed hedge fund managers who are clients of Roubini's firm. Roubini said that [...] "in this financial crisis it was the traditional banks and the investment banks that had {{a larger role in}} doing stupid and silly <b>things</b> <b>than</b> the hedge funds." [...] Stone also stated that he had conversations with Jim Chanos, a prominent hedge fund manager who had urged him to focus less on hedge funds and more on the banking system, Chanos said, [...] "there was a much more important story, a bigger story, in what happened with the system." ...|$|E
500|$|Brand New's second studio {{album was}} written in [...] "the year and-a-half or two years" [...] that they were touring the {{material}} off Your Favorite Weapon. According to drummer Brian Lane, [...] "Jesse [...] wrote {{a lot of the}} lyrics about different <b>things</b> <b>than</b> 'I just broke up with my girlfriend' for the new record," [...] as Lacey had written the songs on an acoustic guitar in his bedroom. Lane also explained that the band was now influenced by a range of different artists, [...] "All of us got exposed to a lot of different music that all of us were listening to. For the first [...] we weren't in such close quarters for 24 hours a day. I think that {{has a lot to do}} with it." [...] Unlike their first album, it was said that a lot of time and concentration went into making the album.|$|E

500|$|A {{week after}} The Washington Post {{released}} their report, Julia Pierson, {{who took over}} {{as director of the}} Secret Service from Sullivan in March 2013, testified at a United States House of Representatives hearing regarding security breaches at the White House. Pierson was criticised by Committee Chairman Darrell Issa regarding several security breaches. Issa stated, [...] "The fact is, the system broke down... when Oscar Ortega-Hernandez successfully shot at the White House on November 2011." [...] Upon hearing that an agent was unwilling to doubt her superior's assertion, Representative Elijah Cummings stated to Pierson that it was [...] "very disturbing to know that Secret Service agents in the most protective agency in the world feel more comfortable... coming to members of this committee and telling <b>things</b> <b>than</b> coming to you and members in the agency." [...] Pierson acknowledged that the incident was [...] "extremely" [...] troubling. As a result of the 2011 shooting and other controversies, Pierson resigned from her position on October 1, 2014.|$|E
500|$|Rangel {{has been}} {{described}} as having a meticulous appearance. [...] Long-time mentor Percy Sutton recalled, “In the beginning I called him Pretty Boy Rangel, to denigrate him, because {{he was one of those}} handsome types, hair pushed down and that mustache. But he had a way about him, with that great humor, an ability to influence people.” [...] Later, The New York Times described him thusly: [...] "After three decades in public life, the portly, gravel-voiced Mr. Rangel, who is very much the Old World-style gentleman yet sprinkles his sentences with mild profanity, still takes politics personally." [...] In contrast, Rangel and his office have long been disorganized, with criticism even from supporters for taking on more <b>things</b> <b>than</b> he can keep track of. [...] The congressman's life has been dominated by politics, with no hobbies and few friendships outside of it. [...] Loyalties to Rangel were severely tested during the height of the ethics investigations of him, when a number of political figures bailed out on a lavish 80th birthday gala planned for Rangel at New York's Plaza Hotel.|$|E
500|$|In {{writing the}} pilot episode, series creator Eric Kripke made several {{dramatic}} revisions to John's storyline. The {{first draft of}} the script had Sam and Dean being raised by their aunt and uncle, though this was changed when Kripke realized that the backstory became much less complicated by having John raise them on the road. Another revision had John dying {{at the end of}} the episode instead of Sam's girlfriend Jessica. Though he survives in the final version of the pilot, the writers decided halfway through production of the first season that John did have to die, as they believed his separation from his sons [...] "split the show" [...] by having him away [...] "doing more interesting <b>things</b> <b>than</b> the boys are doing." [...] Kripke also felt that John kept Sam and Dean away from the [...] "front lines", his death being required to allow the brothers to [...] "explore, investigate and confront the yellow-eyed demon directly." [...] The writers initially intended for John to die in the car accident in [...] "Devil's Trap," [...] but they ultimately postponed his death to prevent the finale from becoming too dark. Following the character's eventual escape from Hell, executive producer Ben Edlund stated that even the writers are unsure of where John's soul ended up.|$|E

500|$|Neither brother married. Wilbur once quipped {{that he did}} {{not have}} time for both a wife and an airplane. Following a brief {{training}} flight he gave to a German pilot in Berlin in June 1911, Wilbur never flew again. He gradually became occupied with business matters for the Wright Company and dealing with different lawsuits. Upon dealing with the patent lawsuits, which had put great strain on both brothers, Wilbur had written in a letter to a French friend, [...] "When we think what we might have accomplished if we had been able to devote this time to experiments, we feel very sad, but it is always easier to deal with <b>things</b> <b>than</b> with men, and no one can direct his life entirely as he would choose." [...] Wilbur spent the next year before his death traveling, where he spent a full six months in Europe attending to various business and legal matters. Wilbur urged American cities to emulate the European – particularly Parisian – philosophy of apportioning generous public space near every important public building. He was also constantly back and forth between New York, Washington and Dayton. All of the stresses were taking a toll on Wilbur physically. Orville would remark that he would [...] "come home white".|$|E
500|$|Jennifer Vineyard of MTV News {{wrote that}} [...] "Sorry" [...] is the [...] "album's strongest track" [...] {{and that it}} is a [...] "Pet Shop Boys-esque" [...] song. Vineyard {{went on to say that}} it [...] "...wistfully evokes the sounds of the '80s-era dance clubs that first lofted her toward stardom." [...] According to a review in the BBC's Collective, [...] "New single 'Sorry' states Queen Madge's unapologetic stance, and though the song is wrapped up in {{relationship}} sentiment, one cannot help but hear the subtext, perhaps directed at her more savage critics: 'there are more important <b>things</b> <b>than</b> hearing you speak'." [...] Alan Braidwood from BBC Music called the song [...] "lethally catchy". Mike Pattenden of The Times and Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine noted that the bassline of the song utilizes The Jacksons' 1980 song [...] "Can You Feel It". The song was noted by Slant Magazine as one of the best songs of 2006. In a review of [...] "Sorry" [...] from Virgin Media, it wrote that the song's musicscape features an [...] "infectious combo of pumping, filtered synths and disco beats". Keith Caulfield from Billboard commented that, [...] " [...] should keep fans hung up on Madonna's ability to create instant radio and club classics." [...] He also called the song [...] "springy" [...] while reviewing the album.|$|E
500|$|Other {{characters}} {{returned from}} the first year. Actor Jim Beaver made multiple appearances as hunter Bobby Singer, an old family friend of the Winchesters. Beaver had expected his first-season guest appearance in [...] "Devil's Trap" [...] to be a [...] "one-shot deal", and was surprised {{when he was asked}} to return. Adrianne Palicki reprised her role as Sam's deceased girlfriend Jessica in the alternate-reality episode [...] "What Is and What Should Never Be", as did Samantha Smith as Mary Winchester. Smith also made an appearance in a flashback in the penultimate episode, [...] "All Hell Breaks Loose, Part One". And though at first reluctant because of his role on Grey's Anatomy, Jeffrey Dean Morgan returned as John Winchester in the season premiere and finale. However, the character dies in the premiere because the writers worried that having him separated from his sons again—Sam and Dean spend much of the first season tracking him down—would [...] "split the show" [...] by having him away [...] "doing more interesting <b>things</b> <b>than</b> the boys are doing". As a demon, the villain Azazel periodically switches hosts, and was first fully portrayed by Morgan in the first-season finale. The reins passed to Fredric Lehne for the second-season premiere, and the show's producers enjoyed his performance so much they brought him back for the two-part finale.|$|E

500|$|On 3 July 1986, {{just before}} the start of the {{recording}} sessions for The Joshua Tree, Carroll was killed in a motorcycle accident while on a courier run. A car had pulled in front of him, and unable to stop in the rain, Carroll struck the side of the car and was killed instantly. The event shocked the entire band; drummer Larry Mullen, Jr. said, [...] "his death really rocked us – it was the first time anyone in our working circle had been killed." [...] Guitarist the Edge said, [...] "Greg was like a member of the family, but the fact that he had come under our wing and had travelled so far from home to be in Dublin to work with us made it all the more difficult to deal with." [...] Bassist Adam Clayton described it as [...] "a very sobering moment", saying, [...] "it inspired the awareness that there are more important <b>things</b> <b>than</b> rock 'n' roll. That your family, your friends and indeed the other members of the band – you don't know how much time you've got left with them." [...] Bono said, [...] "it was a devastating blow. He was doing me a favour. He was taking my bike home." [...] He later commented, [...] "it brought gravitas to the recording of The Joshua Tree. We had to fill the hole in our heart with something very, very large indeed, we loved him so much." [...] Accompanied by Bono, Ali, Mullen, and other members of the U2 organisation, Carroll's body was flown back to New Zealand and buried in the traditional Māori manner at Kai-iwi Marae near Whanganui, Carroll's hometown.
