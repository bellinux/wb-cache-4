2500|$|On {{turned parts}} an {{undercut}} {{is also known}} as a neck or [...] "relief groove".

2500|$|Lathes {{have four}} main {{components:}} the bed, the headstock, the carriage, and the tailstock. [...] The bed is a precise & very strong base {{which all of}} the other components rest upon for alignment. The headstock's spindle secures the workpiece with a chuck, whose jaws (usually three or four) are tightened around the piece. The spindle rotates at high speed, providing the energy to cut the material. While historically lathes were powered by belts from a line shaft, modern examples uses electric motors. The workpiece extends out of the spindle along the axis of rotation above the flat bed. The carriage is a platform that can be moved, precisely and independently parallel and perpendicular to the axis of rotation. A hardened cutting tool is held at the desired height (usually the middle of the workpiece) by the toolpost. The carriage is then moved around the rotating workpiece, and <b>the</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>tool</b> gradually removes material from the workpiece.

2500|$|Thread {{grinding}} {{is done on}} {{a grinding}} machine using specially dressed grinding wheels matching {{the shape of the}} threads. The process is usually used to produce accurate threads or threads in hard materials; a common application is ball screw mechanisms. There are three types: center-type grinding with axial feed, center-type infeed thread grinding and centerless thread grinding. Center-type grinding with an axial feed is the most common of the three. It is similar to cutting a thread on a lathe with a single-point cutting tool, except <b>the</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>tool</b> is replaced with a grinding wheel. Usually a single ribbed wheel is used, although multiple ribbed wheels are also available. To complete the thread multiple passes are commonly required. Center-type infeed thread grinding use a grinding wheel with multiple ribs that is longer than the length of the desired thread. First, the grinding wheel is fed into the blank to the full thread depth. Then the blank is slowly rotated through approximately 1.5 turns while axially advancing through one pitch per revolution. Finally, the centerless thread grinding process is used to make head-less set screws in a similar method as centerless grinding. The blanks are hopper-fed to the grinding wheels, where the thread is fully formed. Common centerless thread grinding production rates are 60 to 70 pieces per minute for a [...] long set screw.|$|E

2500|$|The main {{contributor}} to onychocryptosis is footwear, particularly ill-fitting shoes with inadequate toe-box room and tight stockings that apply {{pressure to the}} top or side of the foot. Other factors may include the damp atmosphere of enclosed shoes, which soften the nail-plate and cause swelling on the epidermal keratin (eventually increasing the convex arch permanently), genetics, trauma and disease. Improper cutting of the nail may cause the nail to cut into the side-fold skin from growth and impact, {{whether or not the}} nail is truly [...] "ingrown". The nail bends inwards or upwards depending on the angle of its cut. If <b>the</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>tool,</b> such as scissors, is at an attitude in which the lower blade is closer to the toe than the upper blade, the toenail will tend to grow upwards from its base, and vice versa. The process is visible along the nail as it grows, appearing as a warp advancing {{to the end of the}} nail. The upper corners turn more easily than the center of the nail tip. Holding the tool at the same angle for all nails may induce these conditions; as the nail turns closer to the skin, it becomes harder to fit the lower blade in the right attitude under the nail. When cutting a nail, it is not just the correct angle that is important, but also how short it is cut. A shorter cut will bend the nail more, unless the cut is even on both top and bottom of the nail.|$|E

Harder work material, higher cutting speed and cost reductions result {{in the development of}} harder and more wear resistance <b>cutting</b> <b>tools.</b> Although PCBN <b>cutting</b> <b>tools</b> have been used in over 30 years, little work have been done on PVD coated PCBN <b>cutting</b> <b>tools.</b> Therefore hard turning and hard milling experiments with PVD coated and uncoated <b>cutting</b> <b>tools</b> have been performed and evaluated. The coatings {{used in the present study}} are TiSiN and TiAlN. The wear scar and surface integrity have been examined with help of several different characterization techniques, for example scanning electron microscopy and Auger electron spectroscopy.   The results showed that <b>the</b> PCBN <b>cutting</b> <b>tools</b> used displayed crater wear, flank wear and edge micro chipping. While the influence of the coating on the crater and flank wear was very small and the coating showed a high tendency to spalling. Scratch testing of coated PCBN showed that, the TiAlN coating resulted in major adhesive fractures. This displays the importance of understanding the effect of different types of lapping/grinding processes in the pre-treatment of hard and super hard substrate materials and the amount and type of damage that they can create. For <b>the</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>tools</b> used in turning, patches of a adhered layer, mainly consisting of FexOy were shown at both the crater and flank. And for <b>the</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>tools</b> used in milling a tribofilm consisting of SixOy covered the crater.
