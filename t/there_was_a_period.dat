5|$|Following the {{failures}} of the hastily planned commando operations undertaken in June and July 1940, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>period</b> of inactivity in which the concept was refined and detailed planning was undertaken while individual units carried out extensive and specialised training. In early 1941 a number of raids were undertaken but No. 6 Commando did not conduct its first operation until later in the year.|$|E
5|$|Construction of Ioann Zlatoust {{began on}} 14 November 1903, {{well before the}} formal keel-laying {{ceremony}} on 13 November 1904. Progress was relatively quick, despite the disruptions caused by the 1905 Revolution, and she was launched on 13 May 1906. Fitting-out, however, was considerably delayed {{by a number of}} changes made as the navy digested the lessons of the Russo-Japanese War. For example <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>period</b> of seven months in 1907 where virtually no work was done on the ship and she was not completed until 1 April 1911. Ioann Zlatousts turrets had originally been intended for a reconstruction of the elderly pre-dreadnought , but they were diverted to Ioann Zlatoust after that reconstruction was cancelled.|$|E
5|$|Multi-platform {{releases}} {{were common}} {{in the early days}} of RPGs, but <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>period</b> during the 1990s when this was not generally the case. The sixth generation of home gaming consoles led many game developers to resume the practice, and some opted to develop primarily or exclusively for consoles. The combination of the Xbox and DirectX technologies proved especially popular due to the two systems' architectural similarities, as well as their common set of programming tools. Multimedia and art assets, which account for a greater proportion of the development budget than in the past, are easily transferable between multiple platforms.|$|E

5|$|<b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>period</b> {{of renewed}} {{lobbying}} for a road crossing in the 1920s and 1930s, {{at which time}} the only vehicle crossing was a single passenger and vehicle ferry. Sir William Denny championed the expansion of that service in the 1930s, providing and operating {{on behalf of the}} London and North Eastern Railway two additional ferries that aimed to supplement the services of the adjacent railway bridge. Their success allowed for the addition of two more craft in the 1940s and 1950s, by which time the ferries were making 40,000 crossings annually, carrying 1.5 million passengers and 800,000 vehicles.|$|E
5|$|After Isaacs left, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>period</b> of {{managerial}} instability, with three chief executives in three years. Isaacs's successor, Genista McIntosh, resigned in May 1997 after five months, citing ill-health. Her post was filled by Mary Allen, who {{moved into the}} job from the Arts Council. Allen's selection did not comply with the Council's rules for such appointments, and following a critical House of Commons Select Committee report on {{the management of the}} opera house she resigned in March 1998, as did the entire board of the opera house, including the chairman, Lord Chadlington. A new board appointed Michael Kaiser as general director in September 1998. He oversaw the restoration of the two companies' finances and the re-opening of the opera house. He was widely regarded as a success, and there was some surprise when he left in June 2000 after less than two years to run the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C.|$|E
5|$|As some warmer air {{began to}} move in above the surface, the snow mixed with and changed to sleet and {{freezing}} rain between 6 PM and 7 PM EST on the 13th in Philadelphia and Delaware Counties, then between 7 PM and 11 PM across most other areas in eastern Pennsylvania. The southern Poconos saw less mixed precipitation, however <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>period</b> of mixed precipitation between about 7:30 PM on the 13th and 11:30 AM on the 14th. For a brief time during {{the afternoon of the}} 14th, temperatures rose a couple of degrees above freezing with no precipitation falling. Temperatures then dropped below freezing again by the late afternoon of the 14th with a period of snow before the precipitation came to an end between 8:30 PM and 10 PM on the 14th. Wraparound snow showers lingered in Monroe and Carbon Counties until 2 AM EST on the 15th.|$|E

5|$|Federation brought {{heightened}} tensions {{including a}} conflict with Indonesia as well continuous conflicts against the Communists in Borneo and the Malayan Peninsula which escalates to the Sarawak Communist Insurgency and Second Malayan Emergency together with several other {{issues such as the}} cross border attacks into North Borneo by Moro pirates from the southern islands of the Philippines, Singapore being expelled from the Federation in 1965, and racial strife. This strife culminated in the 13 May race riots in 1969. After the riots, the controversial New Economic Policy was launched by Prime Minister Tun Abdul Razak, trying to increase the share of the economy held by the bumiputera. Under Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>period</b> of rapid economic growth and urbanisation beginning in the 1980s. The economy shifted from being agriculturally based to one based on manufacturing and industry. Numerous mega-projects were completed, such as the Petronas Towers, the North–South Expressway, the Multimedia Super Corridor, and the new federal administrative capital of Putrajaya. However, in the late 1990s the Asian financial crisis almost caused the collapse of the currency and the stock and property markets.|$|E
5|$|Following the marriage, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>period</b> of {{consolidation}} {{taking the}} form of a series of statutes of the Reformation Parliament aimed at finding solutions to any remaining issues, whilst protecting the new reforms from challenge, convincing the public of their legitimacy, and exposing and dealing with opponents. Although the canon law was dealt with at length by Cranmer and others, these acts were advanced by Thomas Cromwell, Thomas Audley and the Duke of Norfolk and indeed by Henry himself. With this process complete, in May 1532 More resigned as Lord Chancellor, leaving Cromwell as Henry's chief minister. With the Act of Succession 1533, Catherine's daughter, Mary, was declared illegitimate; Henry's marriage to Anne was declared legitimate; and Anne's issue was decided to be next in the line of succession. With the Acts of Supremacy in 1534, Parliament also recognised the King's status as head of the church in England and, with the Act in Restraint of Appeals in 1532, abolished the right of appeal to Rome. It was only then that Pope Clement took the step of excommunicating Henry and Thomas Cranmer, although the excommunication was not made official until some time later.|$|E

25|$|For men, corsets {{are more}} customarily used to slim the figure.

25|$|County cricket {{started in}} the eighteenth century, the {{earliest}} known inter-county match being played in 1709, though an official County Championship was not instituted until 1890.

25|$|As captain, Dhoni {{holds the}} record for longest unbeaten run in Tests from his debut with 11 (8 wins and 3 draws) beating former Australian captain Warwick Armstrong's 10.

25|$|In 1920-23, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>period</b> of {{economic}} turbulence and inflation in Germany, until 1924 {{when the market}} stabilized and money was invested in entertainment.

However this period also saw a dramatic drop in domestic consumption.|$|E
25|$|In 1918, {{seven of}} the Council’s {{alderman}} who had accepted free ferry passes from the Company were charged and found guilty by a magistrate of contravening the Local Government Act and disqualified to act as aldermen.

25|$|There {{is still}} a very poor {{understanding}} of the correlation between low sunspot activity and cooling temperatures.
