5|$|The {{first scene}} of the episode, {{depicting}} the celebration of King Joffrey's name day, was filmed on Dubrovnik's Fort Lovrijenac (also called St. Lawrence Fortress). The later debate {{about the nature of}} power between Cersei and Littlefinger also takes place in its porch, and in the final montage with the killing of <b>the</b> <b>bastards</b> the Old City of Dubrovnik and its famed walls can be clearly seen.|$|E
25|$|Outside Blandford, <b>the</b> <b>Bastards</b> were {{responsible}} for joiner's and carver's work in Hazlegrove House, Somerset and at Lulworth Castle, Dorset (destroyed by fire in 1929). John Bastard was employed, with the master-mason Francis Cartwright, to rebuild Crichel House, Dorset, for Sir William Napier.|$|E

25|$|The Town Hall, {{designed}} to provide a central feature to a row of houses, is typical of the work of the Bastard brothers, from which they were to make their fortune. They became entrepreneurs and local politicians. Other works by <b>the</b> <b>Bastards</b> in the town include the Church of St. Peter and St. Paul, built between 1733 and 1739; the market place around the town hall, designed in the classical style but not uniform; the Greyhound Inn (1734–35; now a bank), which was their own property; a terrace of almshouses; and many large private houses with classical facades, notably Spetisbury and Coupar House.|$|E
25|$|There {{is also a}} {{left field}} / {{experimental}} music scene in Bristol, which has built on the tradition of Bristol bands like The Pop Group, Third Eye Foundation and Crescent. These musicians are supported by record labels such as Invada, Farm Girl, Blood Red Sound and Super Fi, and promoters such as Qu Junktions, Illegal Seagull, Let <b>the</b> <b>Bastards</b> Grind, Noise Annoys and the, now defunct, Choke (music collective). Despite regular performances {{and the success of}} many of its members, this scene tends to be passed over in the national press' view of Bristol music which focuses on Trip Hop, which represents only one aspect of the city's musical culture. Active bands include Gravenhurst (Warp), Team Brick (Invada), The Heads (Invada), Gonga (Invada), Joe Volk (Invada), Fuck Buttons (ATP - now moved to London), Hunting Lodge (Yosada), SJ Esau (Anticon, Twisted Nerve), Bronnt Industries Kapital (Static Caravan), Zoon van snooK (Lo Recordings, Mush Records), Aut (Fällt), Geisha (Crucial Blast) and Defibrillators (Gravid Hands).|$|E
500|$|Referring to {{the fate}} of the 1987 LPs, Drummond sings [...] "Build a fire, stoke it good, throw them on, and watch <b>the</b> <b>bastards</b> burn", {{accompanied}} by a stark, ring modulated chorus, [...] "Mu Mu!". [...] A later portion of the lyrics alludes to New Year's Eve 1987: [...] "Five to twelve, almost gone. [...] 1987, what the fuck have we done?".|$|E

50|$|Ramsay Snow is <b>the</b> <b>bastard</b> son of Lord Roose Bolton, {{known as}} <b>the</b> <b>Bastard</b> of Bolton or <b>the</b> <b>Bastard</b> of <b>the</b> Dreadfort. A depraved sadist, he is renowned for his savage cruelty: he openly rapes and kills peasant women for sport, tortures prisoners, and enthusiastically engages in the Bolton custom of flaying their enemies alive. Roose {{suspects}} that Ramsay murdered Roose's legitimate heir Domeric and expects that Ramsay will kill all of Roose's future children. He {{is described as}} ugly, with blotchy skin and dry, dark hair.|$|R

Before we started, Rab [...] said, 'What {{are you thinking about}} this U2 cover?' I said, 'Ach, it'll be easy: just make it sound bigger than U2'." ...|$|E
500|$|In his column, {{as in his}} life, Watson was {{an early}} {{champion}} of civil rights, social reform, and the anti-war movement. He denounced urban renewal plans aimed at flattening Pioneer Square and radically altering Seattle's Pike Place Public Market. He was the founder and leader of [...] "Lesser Seattle," [...] a parody of Greater Seattle, Inc., which advocated several schemes for Seattle's civic improvement and development that Watson considered ill-advised. Feeling that the influx of outsiders, primarily from California, was ruining the city, Watson often published tongue-in-cheek columns suggesting ways to make visitors to Seattle feel unwelcome. He also invented a fictional organization called Keep <b>the</b> <b>Bastards</b> Out (KBO) that fought against the influx of newcomers to the Puget Sound area from out of state.|$|E
500|$|... "Cheers (Drink to That)" [...] is a pop {{rock and}} reggaeton song. It {{contains}} samples of Lavigne's song [...] "I'm with You", which is featured on her album Let Go (2002). [...] According to the digital music sheet published at musicnotes.com, {{the song is}} written in the key of E major and is set in simple time with a moderated hip-hop groove. [...] Rihanna's vocal range in the song spans from the low note of E3 to the high note of B4. Lyrically, [...] "Cheers (Drink to That)" [...] is a party-drinking song, which is exemplified by the verse [...] "Life's too short to be sittin' around miserable/ People are gonna talk whether you're doin' bad or good/ Don't let <b>the</b> <b>bastards</b> get you down/ Turn it around with another round." [...] According to Ryan Dombal of Pitchfork, the lyrics sum up the general sentiment of Loud and there's no tabloid back story, {{as it was in}} most cases on her previous release Rated R (2009).|$|E

500|$|Robyn Brothers {{felt the}} line [...] "I'd break {{bread and wine}} / If there was a church I could receive in" [...] {{referenced}} feelings of spiritual alienation. She compared the song to [...] "Zooropa", stating that both reference a response to uncertainty and an unavoidable feeling of alienation. Writing for Uncut, Gavin Martin wondered if the lyric [...] "What {{are we going to}} do now it's all been said / No new ideas in the house, and every book has been read" [...] was an examination of the band's longevity, stating [...] "Bono sounded fragile, wounded, seeming even to ponder the band's usefulness." [...] He noted that it contained references to both Holy Communion and oral sex, and compared it to [...] "The Fly", noting that both songs were [...] "delivered in an amoral voice" [...] and helped to deconstruct the prevailing image of the band. Artist Gavin Friday, a childhood friend of Bono, thought the chorus line [...] "Don't let <b>the</b> <b>bastards</b> grind you down" [...] was a retaliation to the criticism of the press. Elizabeth Wurtzel of The New Yorker felt the line gave the song a political, martyr-complex. She noted that it eventually [...] "unfurls as a song about love facing the long run. It comes as a relief to discover, after all this time, that the guys in U2 are as hormonally charged and concerned with love as the rest of us." ...|$|E

5000|$|Waldmann is {{now playing}} <b>the</b> <b>Bastard</b> in <b>the</b> Globe's {{production}} of King John.

[...] Michael Coveney on What's On Stage comments that he thought. [...] "Waldman, sic too, transforms the character's villainy into comic and appealing complexity." [...] Sam Marlow in The Times {{was also very}} positive about the production and gave it 4 stars. Marlowe observed that, [...] "Alex Waldmann, as <b>the</b> <b>Bastard,</b> Lionheart's illegitimate son, supplies both swashbuckling swagger and sardonic commentary." [...] The Express gave the production five stars and commenting on Alex's role, said, [...] "The key player here is the common man Faulconbridge, <b>the</b> <b>bastard</b> son of Richard the Lionheart {{and a kind of}} proto Bolingbroke, fearless, tribal and a bit of a bruiser with a native intelligence." ...|$|R

2500|$|While <b>the</b> <b>Bastards</b> {{worked in}} a provincial style this should not detract from a {{positive}} evaluation of their work. Pevsner describes the Bastards' works at Blandford as providing [...] "One of the most satisfying Georgian ensembles anywhere in England". Such architectural naivety as {{can be found in}} some of the Bastards' works is visible in small country towns the length and breadth of Britain and exemplify the spread of evolving architectural genres from the cities. Their work is typical of the architecture which gives character and distinction and an idiosyncratic charm to many of Britain's provincial areas.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the time}} of the 1731 fire the {{bachelor}} brothers John and William occupied a house in Blandford Forum that belonged to the Trustees of the William Williams charity. <b>The</b> <b>Bastards</b> had extensive workshops and premises at the rear of this building. [...] After the fire they rebuilt the house at their own expense in exchange for the grant of a long lease of the premises from the Williams charity. The room known as the Bastards' Study or the Mezzanine Room was ornately decorated, unlike the rest of the house, and served as a showroom for their skills in plasterwork, woodwork and interior decoration.|$|E

2500|$|Stilwell {{is often}} remembered by his sobriquet, [...] "Vinegar Joe", which he {{acquired}} while a commander at Fort Benning, Georgia. Stilwell often gave harsh critiques of performance in field exercises, and a subordinate – stung by Joe's caustic remarks – drew {{a caricature of}} Stilwell rising out of a vinegar bottle. After discovering the caricature, Stilwell pinned it to a board and had the drawing photographed and distributed to friends. Yet another indication of his view of life was the motto he kept on his desk: Illegitimi non carborundum, a form of fractured Latin that translates as [...] "Don't let <b>the</b> <b>bastards</b> grind you down." ...|$|E

2500|$|Faldo {{went into}} the final round at the 1996 Masters {{trailing}} Greg Norman by six shots, but was the beneficiary of an infamous Sunday collapse at Augusta by Norman; Faldo shot a 67 to win by five over Norman, who struggled mightily {{en route to a}} 78. Though this is commonly remembered as the tournament where Norman collapsed in the final round, Faldo's 67 was a memorable display of concentration and consistency which put pressure on Norman. After Faldo finished, he hugged Norman and whispered something in his ear, which years later Norman confirmed to have included the line [...] "Don't let <b>the</b> <b>bastards</b> get you down," [...] a reference to the media, which Faldo assumed would aggressively hound Norman for the loss. Norman said in interview after defeat that [...] "He (Faldo) had gone way, way up in my estimations." [...] Since then they have become friends and fishing partners, a passion they both share.|$|E
