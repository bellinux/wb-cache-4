25|$|Concerns over {{inadequate}} {{warnings and}} safeguards have included that the two-foot wide yellow platform markings may not keep {{people at a}} safe distance as trains pass at high speed. Suggestions include platform safety barriers, or use of different announcements for approaching Acela trains versus slower ones. In 2011, federal transportation grants were awarded to improve Kingston station, including the construction of a third track to be used by the Acela as a <b>through</b> <b>track</b> to bypass the station, helping to alleviate safety concerns.|$|E
25|$|A {{track with}} a {{spot at the}} station to board and {{disembark}} trains is called station track or house track {{regardless of whether it}} is a main line or loop line. If such track is served by a platform, the track may be called platform track. A loop line without a platform which is used to allow a train to clear the main line at the station only, it is called passing track. A track at the station without a platform which is used for trains to pass the station without stopping is called <b>through</b> <b>track.</b>|$|E

25|$|London Bridge {{station is}} {{undergoing}} a major transformation to accommodate Thameslink trains during the peak period and achieve many other benefits. Three terminus platforms and a <b>through</b> <b>track</b> will be closed and three new through platforms created, to allow all services going to Cannon Street and Charing Cross to stop at London Bridge, as well as additional services to Thameslink stations north of the Thames. A new station concourse is being built to improve circulation, and the adjacent bus station expanded. New retail facilities will be built into the existing western arcade, which will be re-opened and extended to link the Underground station and Joiner Street.|$|E
25|$|In the 1860s the {{passenger}} train service was increasing considerably, especially as branch lines opened, {{and an additional}} through island platform was provided in 1871, occupying space formerly in use for stabling carriages. Increase in traffic continued, as also increasing train lengths {{and it was clear}} that a major extension of the station was essential. Newcastle had been given city status in 1882 and was supportive of the work, seeing it as a civic improvement. Forth Street was displaced southwards and two new trainshed roofs covered a southward extension of the station; in addition a large expansion to the east took place, with additional bay platforms there {{on the north side of}} the former bays. The original <b>through</b> <b>track</b> was blocked to form east and west bays, so that there were still only three through platform lines. This work was completed in 1894.|$|E
500|$|During the First World War, an Army Remount Service depot {{was located}} near Shirehampton. Over {{the course of}} the war, Avonmouth Dock Joint handled 35,000 animals, mainly horses and mules, en route to the depot. July 1917 saw the {{introduction}} of platform tickets, to capitalise on people using the station to bid farewell to friends heading overseas, or to welcome those returning. The platform was lengthened to [...] in December 1917. A second <b>through</b> <b>track</b> was added in 1918, and so a new cinder-covered platform was built {{on the north side of}} the line. The two platforms were linked by a footbridge and a level crossing. The cost of the new platform and the lengthening works was £7,420.|$|E

500|$|In 1943 it was {{renumber}} 790 {{and remained}} in service {{until it was}} replaced by diesel-electric locomotives and put into storage, [...] "the railroad nevertheless had to fire No. 790 up in the spring to assist Illinois Central trains <b>through</b> <b>track</b> inundated by flood waters near Cedar Rapids, because diesel-electric locomotives with their electric motors shorted out in any water, whereas even {{the bottom of the}} firebox in a steam locomotive was much higher above the rail, hence above flood waters." [...] It was sold to Louis S. Keller of Cedar Rapids, Iowa, in 1959 who had hoped to use it for excursions. It was used for [...] "flood duty" [...] in April 1965 at the Clinton Corn Processing Company [...] "where it plowed through overflow from the Mississippi River." [...] Later that year it was sold to David de Camp who planned to use it in the area of Lake Placid, New York. The plans were not met and it was sold to F. Nelson Blount in January 1966.|$|E
2500|$|All lines but the Yellow Line are {{equipped}} with automatic train control. Generally, the train operator does the closing of doors and starts the DA (Départ automatique, automatic departure), and then the train drives itself. The train operator can also drive the train manually {{at his or her}} discretion. Signalling is effected through coded pulses sent through the rails. Coded speed orders and station stop positions transmitted <b>through</b> <b>track</b> beacons are captured by beacon readers mounted under the driver cabs. The information sent to the train's electronic modules conveys speed information, and {{it is up to the}} train automatic control system computer to conform to the imposed speed. Additionally, the train computer can receive energy-saving instructions from track beacons, providing the train with four different economical coasting modes, plus one mode for maximum performance. In case of manual control, track speed is displayed on the cab speedometer indicating the maximum permissible speed. The wayside signals consist of point (switch/turnout) position indicators in proximity to switches and inter-station signalling placed at each station stop. Trains often reach their maximum speed of [...] in 16 to 26 seconds depending on grade and load.|$|E
