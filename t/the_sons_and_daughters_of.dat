5|$|In West Africa, <b>the</b> <b>sons</b> <b>and</b> <b>daughters</b> <b>of</b> Yoruba kings were {{traditionally}} {{given in}} marriage to their fellow royals {{as a matter}} of dynastic policy. Sometimes these marriages would involve members of other tribes. Erinwinde of Benin, for example, was taken as a wife by the Oba Oranyan of Oyo during his time as governor of Benin. Their son Eweka went on to give birth to the dynasty that rules the Kingdom of Benin today.|$|E

They soon sold it to Frederick Bradford Knapp, former Superintendent of Buildings at Harvard College, in 1886. Knapp established the Powder Point School for Boys, a preparatory school, and converted Ezra Weston’s farm into athletic fields and the outbuildings into classrooms and gymnasiums. The King Caesar House was designated as the headmaster's house. The Powder Point School for Boys ceased operation in 1926 and the Knapp family sold the property in 1937.|$|E

500|$|In 1910, the Humphrey Bill, to {{appropriate}} money for monuments to mark the Trail, passed the House of Representatives and {{was introduced in the}} Senate, with a proviso that no money would be spent unless the Secretary of War could certify that the work would not require any further appropriations. Ezra Meeker set out that year on another two-year-long expedition, with the emphasis this time on locating and marking where the Trail had been, rather than on building monuments. [...] Sometimes the ruts in the ground from the emigrants' [...] wagons still existed and made it obvious, but other times he had to rely on the memories of old settlers. He journeyed to Texas, but had no success in interesting people in his project there. His tour was ended in 1912 in Denver when a flood struck the city, resulting in damage to his books. Nevertheless, according to Green, Meeker's two trips resulted in the placement of 150 monuments. A version of the Humphrey Bill passed the Senate in 1913, but died when the House of Representatives took no action. Despite this failure, groups began marking western trails: <b>the</b> <b>Sons</b> <b>and</b> <b>Daughters</b> <b>of</b> the American Revolution put up plaques along the Cowlitz Trail in 1916.|$|E

In 1912 the institution changed its name to Carnegie Institute of Technology (CIT) and began offering four-year degrees.

2500|$|From {{this same}} evidence, {{something}} {{can be seen}} of Saint Patrick's mission. He writes that he [...] "baptised thousands of people". He ordained priests to lead the new Christian communities. He converted wealthy women, some of whom became nuns {{in the face of}} family opposition. He also dealt with the sons of kings, converting them too. The Confessio is generally vague about the details of his work in Ireland, though giving some specific instances. This is partly because, as he says at points, he was writing for a local audience of Christians who knew him and his work. There are several mentions of travelling around the island, and of sometimes difficult interactions with the chiefly elite. He does claim of the Irish: Never before did they know of God except to serve idols and unclean things. But now, they have become the people of the Lord, and are called children of God. <b>The</b> <b>sons</b> <b>and</b> <b>daughters</b> <b>of</b> the leaders of the Irish are seen to be monks and virgins of Christ!Saint Patrick's position as a foreigner in Ireland was not an easy one. His refusal to accept gifts from kings placed him outside the normal ties of kinship, fosterage and affinity. Legally he was without protection, and he says that he was on one occasion beaten, robbed of all he had, and put in chains, perhaps awaiting execution. Patrick says that he was also [...] "many years later" [...] a captive for 60 days, without giving details.|$|E
2500|$|After six {{generations of}} gods, in the Babylonian Enûma Eliš, {{in the seventh}} generation, (Akkadian [...] "shapattu" [...] or sabath), the younger Igigi gods, <b>the</b> <b>sons</b> <b>and</b> <b>daughters</b> <b>of</b> Enlil and Ninlil, go on strike and refuse their duties of keeping the {{creation}} working. Abzu God of fresh water, co-creator of the cosmos, threatens to destroy the world with his waters, and the Gods gather in terror. Enki promises to help and puts Abzu to sleep, confining him in irrigation canals and places him in the Kur, beneath his city of Eridu. But the universe is still threatened, as Tiamat, angry at the imprisonment of Abzu and at the prompting of her son and vizier Kingu, decides {{to take back the}} creation herself. The gods gather again in terror and turn to Enki for help, but Enki who harnessed Abzu, Tiamat's consort, for irrigation refuses to get involved. The gods then seek help elsewhere, and the patriarchal Enlil, their father, God of Nippur, promises to solve the problem if they make him King of the Gods. In the Babylonian tale, Enlil's role is taken by Marduk, Enki's son, and in the Assyrian version it is Asshur. After dispatching Tiamat with the [...] "arrows of his winds" [...] down her throat and constructing the heavens with the arch of her ribs, Enlil places her tail in the sky as the Milky Way, and her crying eyes become the source of the Tigris and Euphrates. But there is still the problem of [...] "who will keep the cosmos working". Enki, who might have otherwise come to their aid, is lying in a deep sleep and fails to hear their cries. His mother Nammu (creatrix also of Abzu and Tiamat) [...] "brings the tears of the gods" [...] before Enki and says ...|$|E
