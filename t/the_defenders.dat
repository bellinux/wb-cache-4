Arriving before <b>the</b> <b>defenders</b> could secure the area, Tancred's men assaulted the precinct, butchering many of <b>the</b> <b>defenders,</b> with the remainder taking refuge in the Al-Aqsa Mosque. Tancred then called {{a halt to the}} slaughter, offering those in the mosque his protection. When <b>the</b> <b>defenders</b> on the southern wall heard of the fall of the northern wall, they fled to the citadel, allowing Raymond and the Provençals to enter the city. Iftikhar al-Dawla, the commander of the garrison, struck a deal with Raymond, surrendering the citadel in return for being granted safe passage to Ascalon.|$|E
5|$|In April, Austrian forces {{approached}} Mantua {{and started}} their siege. At first, the Austrians were content to simply blockade the fortress, {{but with the}} artillery duels and occasional skirmishes, attrition began taking its toll on <b>the</b> <b>defenders.</b> <b>The</b> <b>defenders</b> were also weakened by diminishing food supplies, and their morale was undermined by lack of payment.|$|E

Both ships were ordered restored to operational status on 21 May 1940 by Amiral Mord and their light anti-aircraft outfits were augmented at Cherbourg. Courbet was ordered to provide gunfire support to <b>the</b> <b>defenders</b> of Cherbourg against the advancing 7th Panzer Division and covered the evacuation of the town by the Allies while Paris supported <b>the</b> <b>defenders</b> of Le Havre. Lack of spotting aircraft meant that neither ship was particularly effective in that role.|$|E

A defensive ring of six sectors was established, each assigned to one unit within the 204th Brigade. <b>The</b> <b>defenders</b> used a network of cellars, canals, ditches and trenches to redeploy around the sectors as needed.|$|E

The first week of July, <b>the</b> <b>Defenders</b> {{promoted}} a plan that would withdraw the legal basis for lawsuits against school districts, permit state takeovers of school districts which integrated, and deny state funds to school districts which integrated. <b>The</b> <b>Defenders</b> opposed any pupil assignment plan as too moderate a response. Accommodating this extremist sentiment, the pupil assignment plan approved at the July 2 meeting was fairly weak. After the meeting, Gray independently asked Mays to draft a stronger pupil assignment proposal.|$|E

5|$|Although {{financial}} {{help from the}} English was not forthcoming, Ferdinand could not break the defenses. On 28 November, ten days after {{the beginning of the}} siege, artillery fire had wasted several thousand pounds of powder in the ineffectual bombardment. Ferdinand moved his cannons to an elevated position in a hillside vineyard {{to the west of the}} Godesburg. The height offered a more advantageous trajectory with which to fire on the walls of the Godesburg's outer ward. Within a few hours, his cannonade had breached them. Ferdinand sent three Italian experts to examine the breach and to advise him on the next step; the Italians, having come under fire during their examination, concluded that storming the castle would incur many casualties. <b>The</b> <b>defenders</b> still had the advantage of height and would be able to shoot at attackers from multiple towers and defensive positions inside the walls. Ferdinand decided not to pursue this tactic. Unable to storm the castle, Ferdinand considered two options: abandon the siege, which he could not do, or blow up the fortress. This option of last resort usually made a fortress unusable. Furthermore while he considered his options, <b>the</b> <b>defenders</b> repaired the breaches caused by the cannonade and reinforced the walls, making them even stronger than they had been. <b>The</b> <b>defenders</b> also removed the roof of the St. Michael's Chapel in the castle's outer ward, filled the chapel with dirt to reinforce its walls, and placed some of their artillery pieces within the walls.|$|E

40|$|Stackelberg {{security}} {{games have}} been widely deployed to protect real-world assets. The main solution concept there is the Strong Stackelberg Equilibrium (SSE), which opti-mizes <b>the</b> <b>defender’s</b> random allocation of limited security resources. However, solely deploying the SSE mixed strat-egy has limitations. In the extreme case, there are security games in which <b>the</b> <b>defender</b> is able to defend all the assets “almost perfectly ” at the SSE, but she still sustains significant loss. In this paper, we propose an approach for improving <b>the</b> <b>defender’s</b> utility in such scenarios. Perhaps surprisingly, our approach is to strategically reveal to the attacker information about the sampled pure strategy. Specifically, we propose a two-stage security game model, where {{in the first stage}} <b>the</b> <b>defender</b> allocates resources and the attacker selects a target to attack, and in the second stage <b>the</b> <b>defender</b> strategically reveals local information about that target, potentially deterring the attacker’s attack plan. We then study how <b>the</b> <b>defender</b> can play optimally in both stages. We show, theoretically and experimentally, that the two-stage security game model allows <b>the</b> <b>defender</b> to achieve strictly better utility than SSE...|$|R
