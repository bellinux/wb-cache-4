5|$|The {{best fit}} for the shape of HAT-P-33b's orbit {{suggests}} that the orbit is slightly elliptical, as the planet's orbital eccentricity is fit to 0.148. However, because the star HAT-P-33 has such {{a high level of}} jitter, it is difficult to constrain the planet's eccentricity with accuracy. Most of the planet's defined characteristics are based on <b>the</b> <b>assumption</b> that HAT-P-33b has an elliptical orbit, although the planet's discoverers have also derived HAT-P-33b's characteristics on <b>the</b> <b>assumption</b> that the planet has a circular orbit. The elliptical model has been chosen because it is considered to be the most likely scenario.|$|E
5|$|A common {{source of}} data for {{archaeoastronomy}} {{is the study of}} alignments. This is based on <b>the</b> <b>assumption</b> that the axis of alignment of an archaeological site is meaningfully oriented towards an astronomical target. Brown archaeoastronomers may justify this assumption through reading historical or ethnographic sources, while Green archaeoastronomers tend to prove that alignments are unlikely to be selected by chance, usually by demonstrating common patterns of alignment at multiple sites.|$|E

5|$|In 1922 Gaudí was commissioned, by the Franciscan Padre Angélico Aranda, to {{construct}} a church dedicated to <b>the</b> <b>Assumption</b> in the Chilean city of Rancagua.

Unfortunately this project was not carried out, though there are currently plans by the Chilean architect Christian Matzner to take up the project. The President of Chile, Michelle Bachelet, has announced that building will begin in 2015, with an expected completion in 2017 and at a cost of $7million. Once completed it will become the first of Gaudí's works to be constructed in the Americas.|$|E
