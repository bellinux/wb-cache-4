The company Boston Scientific Costa Rica {{is engaged}} in the {{manufacturing}} of medical products at the areas of urology, cardiology and endoscopy. One is the biopsy catheter, consisting of a handle, a coil and forceps. The coil is a tubular shape and flexible spiral, made of stainless steel and coated {{with a layer of}} polyethylene. Currently, the process of coating the coils with polyethylene is done automatically, in an extrusion line which has three drive shafts that carry the coils through the process phases. However, there are problems of quality because the coating is not remain homogeneous, presenting a thickness less than the acceptable or even exposed areas of the coil’s stainless steel. This forces to discard several batches of the product, generating economic losses to the company, It was determinate that the problem is due the lack of coordination between the principal drive <b>shaft,</b> <b>the</b> extruder machine <b>worm</b> and <b>the</b> other two drive shafts. Thus, it is required to design and implement an automatic control system for the drive shafts speed; using the variable frequency drives (VFD) that handles those shafts, the programmable logic controller (PLC) which governs the entire extrusion line and feeding back <b>the</b> <b>worm’s</b> <b>shaft</b> state through <b>the</b> Profibus communication network.

40|$|The {{paper offers}} {{to use a}} curve of {{changing}} vibration amplitude of the rotating moment on <b>the</b> <b>worm</b> <b>shaft</b> of reducer {{in the process of}} growing brake (loading) moment as one of criteria of the worm reducer operability. A condition of reducer operability at the nominal moment is lack of vibrations of the rotating moment with a critical value of amplitude. It is shown that vibrations of rotating moment on a shaft of the electric engine, by their nature, are self-vibrations in the system with "negative friction". Values of the brake moment at which there is a sharp increase of vibration amplitude leading to operability loss correspond to the nominal moment for this reducer or to the brake moment, corresponding to the maximum efficiency. It is shown that different lubricants differently influence on the generation of self-vibrations. The most efficient damping occurs when using oil with the additive "Striboil", and the reason of falling efficiency at the excess of the nominal moment is essentially increased energy losses at generation of vibrations with "negative friction", especially when approaching to the resonance area. Thus, taking into account a nature of damping vibrations, with using different lubricants, allows us to increase the permissible tension since the more is a damping value the more is a brake moment corresponding to the maximum efficiency. It is noted that, when using the additives to oils, a growth of the permissible tension is caused by the processes of film formation increasing the real contact area, which increases its share of the nominal contact area determined by the Hertz formula. </p...|$|E
40|$|Crude oil {{is a major}} natural {{resource}} and the mainstay of any country that have it in abundance; its sole disadvantage is its tendency of spilling to the environment. Kenaf {{has been found to}} be a good absorbent for physical clean-up and treatment of oil spillage both on land and water surfaces. Kenaf absorbs the oil thus making it soaked and the absorbed oil can however be recovered using appropriate technology. The aim of the research work is to design and construct an oil extractor to remove and recover the absorbed oil from kenaf bast and core. The functional parts of the machine are: barrel (80 mm diameter and 1000 mm length), worm shaft (minimum diameter 50 mm and maximum diameter 65 mm), gear reduction box (20 : 1), prime mover (7 hp, 1420 rpm), oil and cake outlet, hopper, conical restrictor, pulley and transmission belts. <b>The</b> <b>worm</b> <b>shaft</b> was tapered to build up pressure as it travels across the length of the barrel and it conveys, grinds, presses and squeezes oil out of kenaf into the oil outlet via the oil collection tray. The residual cake from where the oil was extracted is extruded out of the cake outlet in form of briquettes. The oil extractor machine was evaluated in compliance with Philippines Agricultural Engineering Standard PAES 230 and 231 : 2005 and the results showed a percent kenaf recovery of 60 %, extraction efficiency of 62. 2 %, throughput capacity of 36. 5 kg/hr and an extraction loss of 37. 8 %. The extraction efficiency varies with the moisture content of the soaked kenaf bast and core. The operation of the machine does not require any technical-know-how and the machine can be easily maintained as it has the tendency of self-lubricating the extraction chamber due to presence of oil in the input materials...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: A {{small scale}} {{sugarcane}} juice extractor using a screw pressing system was designed, constructed and tested. Consideration {{was given to}} the techno-economic status of the micro and small scale sugarcane farmers and juice processors who are the intended users of the machine. The functional parts of the machine included grating unit, extraction unit, prime mover, pulley, transmission belts, bearings and frame. The machine was tested with two varieties of sugarcane each at three levels of moisture content and results showed that average grating efficiency and juice yield of 87. 8 % and 2. 5 % respectively were obtained. Powered by a 3 hp single-phase electric motor, the machine was constructed with materials being available locally at affordable costs. A cottage sugarcane juice extraction plant based on this technology could provide employment {{and at the same time}} produce sugarcane juice and bagasse at low costs for sugar and biofuel industries.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Worm gears are {{commonly}} used in windshield wipers and power windows of automobiles. The goal of this work is to study several material problems, such as production bottlenecks and excessive scrap, resulting from the production of steel <b>worm</b> <b>shafts.</b> A possible solution is explored in this work by characterizing material properties of a promising candidate (glass reinforced acetal copolymer) that can replace steel in worm gears. Finite element analysis of <b>the</b> <b>worm</b> thread under static loading and constant temperature is performed in order to calculate {{the size of the}} new composite part. The results obtained in this work support the possibility of manufacturing composite <b>worm</b> <b>shafts</b> that could operate at elevated temperatures without sacrificing part performance, while reducing part weight leading to improved fuel economy, noise reduction, and manufacturing problems associated with the steel part. The finite element analysis shows that compared to a steel gear, the axial pitch of a composite worm gear must be increased by 250 % in order for it to operate without failure for 10 years at a constant temperature of 23 C. This increase in the axial pitch would ramp up to 400 %, if <b>the</b> composite <b>worm</b> gear is expected to operate for 10 years at a constant temperature of 100 C.

40|$|Abstract. The {{technology}} to produce high precision worm in form rolling {{is described in}} this study {{on the base of}} three-dimensional FE-simulation and its confirmation by experiment. It is important to determine the initial blank diameter in form rolling because it affects tooth quality.

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the wear rate in conical thrust bearings, which is {{responsible}} for field failures of stepper motors in optical disk drives (ODD). These bearings support <b>the</b> stepper motor <b>worm</b> <b>shaft</b> and consist of a steel ball supported in a polymer conical bearing cup. The tribological behaviors of polymers used in bearing application has been addressed by using Archard's wear model, a well known classical model for fretting wear in the literature. However, these studies were for planar bearing surfaces and other geometries, not for the conical geometry addressed in this study. Tests were designed and implemented to study the wear rate of the conical bearing cups at with different load levels. The tribological behavior of Delrin in conical thrust bearing applications has been characterized, by quantifying the wear factors used in the modified Archard's model. Distinct reduction of wear rate is observed due to formation of a polymer transfer film on the steel ball. The variability of the wear properties is explored through replication of the test conditions. Destructive physical analysis is conducted to gain insight into the fundamental wear mechanisms as a part of this study. The results of the wear tests are used to develop a life model of the stepper motor as a case study, to demonstrate an application of this approach. The life model is used to study the effect of variability in the initial axial bearing preload (due to manufacturing tolerances), on the wear rate and life of the stepper motor...|$|R
