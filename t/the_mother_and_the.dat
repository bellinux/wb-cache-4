5|$|In the United States, {{infertility}} affects 1.5 million couples. Many couples seek assisted reproductive technology (ART) for infertility. In the United States in 2010, 147,260 {{in vitro}} fertilization (IVF) procedures were carried out, with 47,090 live births resulting. In 2013 these numbers had increased to 160,521 and 53,252. However, about a half of IVF pregnancies result in multiple-birth deliveries, which in turn are associated {{with an increase in}} both morbidity and mortality of <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> infant. Causes for this include increased maternal blood pressure, premature birth and low birth weight. In addition, more women are waiting longer to conceive and seeking ART.|$|E
5|$|The {{attachment}} theory {{focused on}} {{the attention of the}} child when the mother is there and the responses that the child shows when the mother leaves, which indicated the attachment and bonding of <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> child. The attention therapy is the done while the child is being restrained by the therapists and the responses displayed were noted. The tests were done to show the responses of the child.|$|E
5|$|In Singapore, the Penal Code {{lays out}} {{sanctions}} for non-compliance with the Termination of Pregnancy Act, which limits abortion {{to women who}} have not been pregnant for more than 24 weeks. By not conferring the right to life upon fetuses younger than the stipulated period, the legislation has accorded greater weight to the safety and security of expectant mothers who are threatened by their unborn children. This is in contrast with the approach taken in the Philippines, where the Constitution provides that the state shall equally protect the life of <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> life of the unborn from conception. Similarly, the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Basic Freedoms of the Czech Republic states that human life deserves to be protected before birth. Chances of a universal consensus on this issue are slim due to the difficulty in defining the beginning of life.|$|E

5|$|In the {{short-term}} low carbohydrate diets appear better than low fat diets for weight loss. In the long term; however, {{all types of}} low-carbohydrate and low-fat diets appear equally beneficial. A 2014 review found that the heart disease and diabetes risks associated with different diets appear to be similar. Promotion of the Mediterranean diets among the obese may {{lower the risk of}} heart disease. Decreased intake of sweet drinks is also related to weight-loss. Success rates of long-term weight loss maintenance with lifestyle changes are low, ranging from 2–20%. Dietary and lifestyle changes are effective in limiting excessive weight gain in pregnancy and improve outcomes for both <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> child. Intensive behavioral counseling is recommended in those who are both obese and have other risk factors for heart disease.|$|E
25|$|Complications of {{pre-eclampsia}} {{can affect}} both <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> fetus. Acutely, pre-eclampsia can be complicated by eclampsia, {{the development of}} HELLP syndrome, hemorrhagic or ischemic stroke, liver damage and dysfunction, acute kidney injury, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).|$|E
25|$|Use {{of cocaine}} during {{pregnancy}} can negatively affect both <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> fetus, but {{the ways in}} which it affects the fetus are poorly understood. There are three main mechanisms by which cocaine exposure harms a fetus: by altering brain chemistry, by altering the expression of certain genes, and by the constriction of blood vessels. The neurotransmitters affected by cocaine are involved {{in the development of the}} fetus's brain, so the drug may affect fetal development directly by altering the development of the brain's monoaminergic system. The most important way cocaine affects fetal development is by binding to dopamine receptors.|$|E

25|$|The Triple Goddess {{has been}} adopted by many neopagans {{as one of their}} primary deities. In common Neopagan usage the three female figures are {{frequently}} described as the Maiden, <b>the</b> <b>Mother,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Crone, each of which symbolizes both a separate stage in the female life cycle and a phase of the Moon, and often rules one of the realms of earth, underworld, and the heavens. These {{may or may not be}} perceived as aspects of a greater single divinity. The Goddess of Wicca's duotheistic theology is sometimes portrayed as the Triple Goddess, her masculine consort being the Horned God.|$|E
25|$|Pre-eclampsia (PE) is a {{disorder}} of pregnancy {{characterized by the}} onset {{of high blood pressure}} and often a significant amount of protein in the urine. The condition begins after 20 weeks of pregnancy. In severe disease there may be red blood cell breakdown, a low blood platelet count, impaired liver function, kidney dysfunction, swelling, shortness of breath due to fluid in the lungs, or visual disturbances. Pre-eclampsia increases the risk of poor outcomes for both <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> baby. If left untreated, it may result in seizures at which point it is known as eclampsia.|$|E

25|$|Since Law No. 2003-516 of 18 June 2003 on the {{devolution}} {{of family}} names, {{there is no}} longer any distinction between the name of <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> father. A child may receive the family name of one or the other, or both family names. Decree No. 2004-1159 of 29 October 2004 implemented Law No. 2002-304 of 4 March 2002, provided that children born on or after 1 January 2004 and children changing names, may have or use only the family name of the father or the mother or both family names. However, whichever form is used, a person's name must be used consistently on all identification documents, such as a passport or identity card.|$|E
25|$|This {{consists}} of an India-rubber contrivance which the female easily adjusts in the vagina before copulation, and which spreads a thin tissue of rubber before {{the mouth of the}} womb so as to prevent the seminal aura from entering. … Conception cannot possibly take place when it is used. The full enjoyment of the conjugal embrace can be indulged in during coition. The husband would hardly be likely to know that it was being used, unless told by the wife. … It places conception entirely {{under the control of the}} wife, to whom it naturally belongs; for it is for her to say at what time and under what circumstances, she will become <b>the</b> <b>mother,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> moral, religious, and physical instructress of offspring.|$|E
500|$|Several {{changes were}} made to the story-line of the {{original}} film, including the omission of certain characters and addition of new ones. The characters of Krishnan Iyer MA, played by Mithun Chakraborty and Nurse Mary Matthew, played by Madhavi were done away with and new characters such as Rauf Lala and Kaali Gawde were introduced in the screenplay. Moreover, the characterisation of Vijay Chauhan was changed, unlike the original which was inspired by Al Pacino's role in Scarface (1983). In an interview with The Calcutta Telegraph, director Karan Malhotra explained the adaptation by saying, [...] "The similarity (between the original and this film) lies only in {{the fact that it is}} a revenge film; a son seeking revenge for his father’s death. Unlike Mr. (Amitabh) Bachchan’s film, my film starts and ends in Mandwa and is primarily about the conflict between <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> son. It’s a completely new film with a lot of new characters." [...] He additionally termed Agneepath to be a [...] "crazily dramatic masala Bollywood film".|$|E

500|$|Eastwood married Margaret Neville [...] "Maggie" [...] Johnson (born 1931; {{then working}} for an auto parts {{suppliers}} company) on December 19, 1953 in Pasadena. They had met {{six months earlier}} {{on a blind date}} in Los Angeles, although Eastwood subsequently had a serious relationship in Seattle that summer with a young woman who became pregnant with his child—an alleged daughter who was given up for adoption, per biographer Patrick McGilligan—before Johnson announced her engagement to him in October. The marriage would not prove altogether smooth. [...] "He thought they were too young, not well enough established," [...] remarked biographer Richard Schickel in the only authorized book ever written about Eastwood. A decade later, an ongoing affair Eastwood was involved in (said to have lasted 14 years) with dancer and Rawhide stuntwoman Roxanne Tunis (who was also married yet separated) produced his earliest verified child, daughter Kimber Eastwood (born Kimber Tunis; June 17, 1964), whose existence was kept secret from the public until July 1989, when the National Enquirer revealed her identity. Biographer Marc Eliot wrote of Johnson, [...] "It is difficult to say for sure that she actually knew about the baby, although it would have been nearly impossible for her not to. Everyone on the set knew ... and it is simply too difficult to keep a secret like that when <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> illegitimate child live in the same small town, especially when that small town is Hollywood." [...] The source for the 1989 Enquirer article that originally broke the story claimed Johnson was aware of Kimber's existence at all times and even met Roxanne Tunis in person when making an unannounced visit to the set of Breezy in 1972. Actress Barbara Eden, a onetime Rawhide guest star and witness to the affair with Tunis, said of Eastwood's relationship with Johnson: [...] "They conducted a somewhat open marriage." ...|$|E

2500|$|For {{what we have}} to keep in mind is that <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> {{unborn child}} are not like two tenants in a small house, which has, by unfortunate mistake, been rented to both: the mother owns the house.

2500|$|The element De- may be {{connected}} with Deo, an epithet of Demeter probably derived from the Cretan word dea (...) , Ionic zeia (...) —variously identified with emmer, spelt, rye, or other grains by modern scholars—so that she is <b>the</b> <b>Mother</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> giver of food generally.
