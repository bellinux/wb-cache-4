5000|$|One of {{the major}} crises to face Jamieson during her time as Minister for Justice, was the scandals {{occurring}} after the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>prisoner</b> escort duties from the police to a private company, Reliance Security Group. Four days following the transfer, Reliance accidentally released a convicted killer at Hamilton Sheriff Court. Jamieson later criticised Reliance and their security methods, but defended the principle of using a private company to transfer prisoners. Opposition parties later called for her to resign, calls that Jamieson rejected, stating [...] "I think the responsibility on a minister {{is to ensure that}} problems are solved... Some people in the face of problems might turn away, might walk away from them. I have no intention of doing that and I never did." ...|$|E

50|$|The Alexander Maconochie Centre {{has been}} the subject of {{controversy}} during its planning, construction, and period immediately post opening. A chief criticism related to the facility's large initial cost estimates and even larger final price tag. On 21 January 2009 the Standing Committee on Justice and Community Safety of the ACT Government resolved that it would inquire into and report on the circumstances surrounding the delay in the commencement of operations of the Centre, the cost of delays to the ACT Government, as well as the impact of delays, if any, on the delivery of corrective services. At the same time, there was confusion between the ACT and the NSW Governments about willingness and ability of Corrective Services NSW to continue to accept ACT prisoners, due to overcrowding in NSW facilities:The cessation <b>of</b> <b>transfers</b> <b>of</b> <b>prisoners</b> to NSW was never satisfactorily explained.... The cessation <b>of</b> <b>transfers</b> <b>of</b> <b>prisoners</b> to NSW in December 2008 added to the pressure on ACT remand facilities and contributed further to their failure to be human rights compliant.|$|R

This acquisition of manpower for projects in Norway was under Organisation Todt Einsatzgruppe Wiking.|$|R
5000|$|The {{camp was}} one of the {{so-called}} [...] "wild" [...] concentration camps, one of many created at that time in Germany. They were organized mostly in temporary barracks or railway cars using low cost materials available on the site. Setting up the Dürrgoy camp only took two weeks. The existence of 'wild' camps, and the treatment <b>of</b> <b>prisoners</b> detained in them, became public relatively quickly, and under pressure from public opinion they were shut down. The result was a centralization of the system of repression and the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>prisoners</b> to official camps.|$|R
