5|$|Arsenal {{continued}} to dominate possession once {{the second half}} got underway, but struggled <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> their advantage. Lauren's cross from the right was cleared away by the United defence and Henry moments later miscued his effort aimed at goal. Moments later Ljungberg beat his marker and crossed {{the ball into the}} penalty area, only for Bergkamp to drag his shot wide. United threatened once the game reached the hour mark, winning duels and earning set-pieces. Gabriel Heinze's shot from about 20 yards tested Arsenal goalkeeper Jens Lehmann in the 65th minute. Five minutes later Wenger substituted Reyes off in place of Pirès.|$|E
5|$|By {{the middle}} of 1936, the US27/M-78 routing through Lansing was split into two. The {{mainline}} was restricted to cars only and moved to run along Capitol Avenue. The former routing was restricted to trucks only and designated as a truck route. In 1950, the bridge for Main Street over the Grand River was completed and mainline US27/M-78 was rerouted <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> connect to Larch Street. From there north, US27/M-78 followed Larch Street supplanting the truck route, which was decommissioned at that time.|$|E

5|$|In 1988, Guy Caron {{left the}} company due to artistic {{differences}} {{over what to do}} with the money generated by Cirque du Soleil's first financially successful tour. Laliberté wanted <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> expand and start a second show while Caron wanted the money to be saved, with a portion going back to the National Circus School. An agreement was never met and Caron, along with a large number of artists loyal to him, departed. This stalled plans that year to start a new touring show.|$|E
5|$|Jonathan Phillips as Second Officer Charles Lightoller. The film depicts Lightoller informing Captain Smith {{that it will}} be {{difficult}} to see icebergs without breaking water. He is seen brandishing a gun and threatening <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> keep order. He can be seen on top of Collapsible B when the first funnel collapses. Lightoller was the most senior officer to have survived the disaster.|$|E
5|$|Set in the 24th century, {{the series}} follows {{the adventures of}} {{the crew of the}} Starfleet {{starship}} Enterprise-D.

5|$|Sometime after 4p.m. on December 6, 1989, Marc Lépine {{arrived at}} the {{building}} housing the École Polytechnique, an engineering school affiliated with the Université de Montréal, armed with a semi-automatic rifle and a hunting knife. He had purchased a Ruger Mini-14 on November 21, 1989 in a Checkmate Sports store in Montreal, telling the clerk {{that he was going}} <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> hunt small game.

5|$|The Norfolk Spaniel or Shropshire Spaniel is an extinct {{breed of}} dog {{since the early}} 20th century. It was {{originally}} thought to have originated {{from the work of}} one of the Dukes of Norfolk, but this theory was disproven after being in doubt during the later part of the 19th century. The term was used to designate springer type spaniels that were neither Sussex nor Clumber Spaniels, and attempts were made <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> specify a breed that would later become known as the English Springer Spaniel.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the initial}} search {{failed to find}} any links to the Soviet Union, the CIA decided to extend the operation, and on 4 August a much larger team was deployed, with members from many {{government}} departments, including the State Department and the USIA. The task force was given the cover name Social Research Group. To avoid confrontation with Guatemalan nationalists, the CIA opted to leave the documents in Guatemalan possession, instead funding {{the creation of a}} Guatemalan intelligence agency that would try to dismantle the communist organizations. Thus the National Committee of Defense Against Communism (Comité de Defensa Nacional Contra el Comunismo) was created on 20 July, and granted a great deal of power over military and police functions. The personnel of the new agency were also put to work analyzing the same documents. The document-processing phase of the operation was terminated on 28 September 1954, having examined 500,000 documents. There was tension between the different U.S. government agencies about using the information; the CIA wished <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> subvert communists, the USIA for propaganda. The CIA's leadership of the operation allowed it to retain control over any documents deemed necessary for clandestine operations. A consequence of PBHISTORY was the opening of a CIA file on Argentine communist Ernesto Che Guevara.|$|E

30|$|In {{the final}} {{component}} of our analysis, we switch {{from using the}} experimental program group data to test the model <b>to</b> <b>using</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> help calibrate the model. This switch embodies in our context the very general tradeoff between using additional restrictions for testing versus using them for calibration or estimation. For example, in a common effects linear instrumental variables context, a researcher with two candidate instrumental variables must choose between using both for estimation, or <b>using</b> one <b>to</b> test the exogeneity of the other. A natural approach within our framework starts with using the experimental variation to test the model and then switches <b>to</b> <b>using</b> <b>it</b> for estimation or calibration once a satisfactory model is found. In the SSP context, using the experimental program group in the calibration changes the results in New Brunswick but not in British Columbia.|$|R
5|$|At Eurocorp New York HQ, Denham and Merit believe Kilo is brain-dead {{and send}} him to be rebooted while they plan to {{retrieve}} Lily's chip and recover useful information on DART 6. Kilo begins to remember his secret past: he learns that Denham led a Eurocorp team to kill his parents and abduct him as a baby because he has genes ideal for becoming an agent. Kilo escapes from his restraints and rescues Lily, who tells Kilo that like him, all of Eurocorp's agents were abducted as children and their memories were modified so they would remain loyal to Eurocorp. Lily created the DART 6 chip, hoping <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> make the syndicates retain their humanity and care about both chipped and un-chipped civilians, but she realizes she was naïve to think that way.|$|E
5|$|At Moe's Tavern, Moe informs Homer and {{his friends}} {{that one of them}} must be a {{designated}} driver, and Barney loses the choosing draw. After Barney drives the drunken men home in Homer's car, Homer allows him <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> drive himself home, expecting Barney to return it the following morning. In his distressed state, Barney disappears with the car. Two months later, Barney returns to Moe's Tavern, unable to recall where he left the car. Homer later receives a letter from the New York City government, which informs him that his car has been found parked in the World Trade Center plaza. Homer reveals to the family that he had once been to New York before when he was 17 years old and had a horrible experience. Marge and the children persuade Homer to go retrieve the car and he reluctantly agrees.|$|E
5|$|Athena reappears, {{demanding}} that Kratos return {{what she thinks}} he took from Pandora's Box. She refuses to believe the box was empty, explaining that when Zeus sealed the evils {{of the world in}} the box, she placed her power of hope in it, foreseeing that it would eventually be opened. Athena realizes that when Kratos opened the box to defeat Ares, the evils escaped and infected the gods while Kratos was imbued with hope, which enabled him to kill Ares. She tells Kratos to return her power, saying that she knows how <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> rebuild the world. Distrusting Athena and tired of being used as a pawn, Kratos refuses; saying his vengeance has ended, he impales himself with the Blade of Olympus and releases hope for the world so that it can heal. An angry Athena pulls the sword from him, saying that he has disappointed her and leaves empty-handed. Near death, Kratos collapses as Athena leaves.|$|E
50|$|De Martino noted {{problems}} with the special effects in the film, stating that Italo Zingarelli had purchased a camera in Germany to create the flying effects in the film, but the technicians were not able <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>it</b> properly. <b>To</b> not go beyond schedule, these shots were shot with a blue-screen in just two days.|$|R
40|$|Heat {{transfer}} at rivulet FC- 72 flow {{over the}} constantan vertical heated foil with {{the length of}} 80 mm, width of 35 mm, and thickness of 25 mm was studied experimentally. Distributions of temperature on the bottom side of foil from the rivulet flow using the infrared thermographic data were obtained. In the future heat flux from the foil will be calculated with help of Koshi problem solution. It was shown that the rivulet width as the liquid flow rate increases, and it narrows as heat power increases due to the high evaporation rate. In the case with water, the rivulet narrows not so intensively {{as compared with the}} rivulet of FC- 72 liquid.

5|$|His second film of 1949, also {{produced}} by Film Art Association and released by Shintoho, was Stray Dog. It is a detective movie (perhaps the first important Japanese film in that genre) that explores {{the mood of}} Japan during its painful postwar recovery through {{the story of a}} young detective, played by Mifune, and his fixation on the recovery of his handgun, which was stolen by a penniless war veteran who proceeds <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> rob and murder. Adapted from an unpublished novel by Kurosawa in the style of a favorite writer of his, Georges Simenon, it was the director's first collaboration with screenwriter Ryuzo Kikushima, who would later help to script eight other Kurosawa films. A famous, virtually wordless sequence, lasting over eight minutes, shows the detective, disguised as an impoverished veteran, wandering the streets in search of the gun thief; it employed actual documentary footage of war-ravaged Tokyo neighborhoods shot by Kurosawa's friend, Ishirō Honda, the future director of Godzilla. The film is considered a precursor to the contemporary police procedural and buddy cop film genres.|$|E
5|$|In 1930, Segrè began {{studying}} the Zeeman effect in certain alkaline metals. When his progress stalled because the diffraction grating he required to continue {{was not available}} in Italy, he wrote to four laboratories elsewhere in Europe asking for assistance and received an invitation from Pieter Zeeman to finish his work at Zeeman's laboratory in Amsterdam. Segrè was awarded a Rockefeller Foundation fellowship and, on Fermi's advice, elected <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> study under Otto Stern in Hamburg. Working with Otto Frisch on space quantization produced results that apparently {{did not agree with}} the current theory; but Isidor Isaac Rabi showed that theory and experiment were in agreement if the nuclear spin of potassium was +1/2.|$|E

40|$|Measuring {{agreement}} between a statistical model and a spike train data series, that is, evaluating goodness of fit, {{is crucial for}} establishing the model’s validity prior <b>to</b> <b>using</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> make inferences about a particular neural system. Assessing goodness-of-fit is a challenging problem for point process neural spike train models, especially for histogram-based models such as perstimulus time histograms (PSTH) and rate functions estimated by spike train smoothing. The time-rescaling theorem is a wellknown result in probability theory, which states that any point process with an integrable conditional intensity function may {{be transformed into a}} Poisson process with unit rate. We describe how the theorem may be <b>used</b> <b>to</b> develop goodness-of-fit tests for both parametric and histogram-based point process models of neural spike trains.
