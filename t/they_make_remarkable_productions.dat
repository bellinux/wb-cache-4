[...] Sputnikmusic said that [...] "Sheep is fascinating in that it makes a complete stylistic detour from Xen while retaining the latter's core-aesthetic, manipulating {{it in such a}} way that the two become polar opposites, atmospherically. The extra-terrestrial vibe that appears to be something of a signature for Arca remains, but his characteristically warm, endearing, nonchalant approach has shifted towards something more deliberate and maddening." [...] Consequence of Sound said [...] "the mix runs the sonic and emotional gamut, from moments of pounding aggression and galactic wooziness to pulsating sensuality and even hymnal meditation."
