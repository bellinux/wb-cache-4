5|$|Happy Brothers, Their Poor Mother! (often {{referred}} to simply as Happy Brothers) is an 1887 oil painting by the Serbian artist Uroš Predić. It shows four intoxicated youths walking through their village whilst <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> shouts her disapproval from the distance. The painting {{is said to}} have been inspired by a frequent sight in Predić's home village of Orlovat—that of drunken youths returning from the pub at dawn. Predić painted the composition hoping it would persuade the villagers to change their ways. He was disappointed that it not only failed to decrease the incidence of drunkenness in Orlovat, but was well received by the villagers themselves, who were happy merely to have been depicted.|$|E
5|$|Some insects {{display a}} {{rudimentary}} sense of numbers, {{such as the}} solitary wasps that prey upon a single species. The mother wasp lays her eggs in individual cells and provides each egg {{with a number of}} live caterpillars on which the young feed when hatched. Some species of wasp always provide five, others twelve, and others as high as twenty-four caterpillars per cell. The number of caterpillars is different among species, but always the same for each sex of larva. The male solitary wasp in the genus Eumenes is smaller than the female, so <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> species supplies him with only five caterpillars; the larger female receives ten caterpillars in her cell.|$|E

The remains of Sánchez Bravo were later reinterred in Murcia, with those of Ramón García Sanz being reinterred in Madrid.

25|$|After they officially {{filed the}} case in Jalisco, the family members {{sent a letter to}} former Mexican President Felipe Calderón (2006–2012). Calderón responded to their request and {{assigned}} the investigation to the Office of the General Prosecutor (PGR). However, the family stated that the PGR did not follow-up with them for over a month after officially being assigned to the case. The fishermen group had attended a meeting on March 17 in Guadalajara, where they reportedly received death threats from a man named Antonio Vélez. The family members believe that the disappearance of their three members stemmed from conflicts they had with Gasparotto and ejido members from Portezuelos, La Barca, Jalisco in those two meetings. According to their version of the story, former Governor of Jalisco Francisco Javier Ramírez Acuña hosted parties at Hotelito Desconocido and they believe he might be responsible for the mass disappearance. They also said Calderón visited too. <b>The</b> <b>mother</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> of the missing members stated that Efraín Aréchiga, the lawyer who was in company of the three men in Guadalajara, did not return to La Cruz de Loreto for six months after they went missing. She believes that his six month hiatus was suspicious and that he might be involved in the mass disappearance as well.|$|E
25|$|Holý's field {{experience}} among the Berti people of Pakistan {{allowed him to}} undertake an extensive study of cousin marriage in their culture. Holý believed {{that many of his}} findings could generalize to other Middle Eastern groups. He noted that stated reasons for cousin marriage could be both pragmatic and symbolic. Stated pragmatic reasons for cousin marriage might be stated in terms of advantages for the husband such as warmer relations with his father-in-law, quicker entertainment of the husband's family by the wife {{in the case of a}} visit due to them being her relations, greater loyalty and devotion of the wife, and the ease of regaining a wife after a serious quarrel where she has withdrawn to the house of her own family. Stated pragmatic reasons for the parents included gaining access to the labor of a daughter's children by marrying her to a kinsman and thereby keeping her family close by, increased attentiveness on the part of a wife to her aging in-laws if she is related to them, and the ease of marital negotiations if the parents are brothers, or in the next best case, if <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> child is the sister of the father of the other child.|$|E
