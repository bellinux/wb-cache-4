At the same time, to collect the personal details of the workers who have worked in the industry in the study period, an interview was also conducted. Mean age of <b>temporary</b> piece <b>rated</b> workers and permanent time rated workers were (35. 9 ± 12. 5) and (35. 3 ± 11. 4) respectively. Distribution of other variables like nature of work, level of education, experience, habits were also very similar between the two worker groups. Accident incidence rate, accident frequency rate and accident severity rate were found to be significantly higher in <b>temporary</b> piece <b>rated</b> workers. This difference was more prominent in case of time-loss accidents than in no timeloss accidents. Relative risk has varied from 2. 3 to 18. 0 in case of time-loss accidents. In case of no time-loss accidents, it has varied from 1. 1 to 2. 6. When relative risk is considered after taking both types of accidents together, it has ranged from 1. 2 to 3. 5.

This study applied mark–recapture methods following the Robust Design to estimate abundance, demographic parameters, and <b>temporary</b> emigration <b>rates</b> of an Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops aduncus) population off Bunbury, Western Australia. Boat-based photo-identification surveys were conducted year-round over three consecutive years along pre-determined transect lines to create a consistent sampling effort throughout the study period and area. The best fitting capture–recapture model showed a population with a seasonal Markovian temporary emigration with time varying survival and capture probabilities. Abundance estimates were seasonally dependent with consistently lower numbers obtained during winter and higher during summer and autumn across the three-year study period. Specifically, abundance estimates for all adults and juveniles (combined) varied {{from a low of}} 63 (95 % CI 59 to 73) in winter of 2007 to a high of 139 (95 % CI 134 to 148) in autumn of 2009. <b>Temporary</b> emigration <b>rates</b> (c’) for animals absent in the previous period ranged from 0. 34 to 0. 97 (mean = 0. 54; 6 SE 0. 11) with a peak during spring. <b>Temporary</b> emigration <b>rates</b> for animals present during the previous period (c’’) were lower, ranging from 0. 00 to 0. 29, with a mean of 0. 16 (6 SE 0. 04).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Although thyroidectomy for Graves' disease (GD) is well established, {{surgical}} indications remain {{less well}} defined. This study aimed {{to evaluate the}} changes in surgical indication, type of resection, and surgical outcomes at a single institution. METHODS: A total of 346 patients who underwent thyroidectomy for GD were divided into 2 time periods: period 1 (1995 - 2001) and period 2 (2002 - 2008). Their surgical indication, type of resection, and surgical outcomes were compared. RESULTS: Patients in the earlier period were significantly younger, suffered more previous relapses, and were on a longer duration of antithyroid drugs before surgery. Graves' ophthalmopathy and refusal for radioactive iodine were the indications that changed significantly between the 2 periods. Total/near-total thyroidectomy was performed more commonly and resulted in a higher <b>temporary</b> hypoparathyroidism <b>rate</b> in the latter period (P <. 001). CONCLUSIONS: Over the study period, significant changes in surgical indication, type of resection, and surgical outcomes were noted. Graves' ophthalmopathy {{became one of the}} most common surgical indications. Total thyroidectomy became the preferred surgery but that resulted in a higher <b>temporary</b> hypoparathyroidism <b>rate.</b> link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|There {{is a great}} {{discussion}} about controlling the energy consumption by economic means from the necessity to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions. However, there was no discussion {{as to what the}} desirable tax rates should be when reform of the system of tax revenues earmarked for road projects was discussed, and the discussion instead centered on <b>temporary</b> tax <b>rates.</b> With regard to levels of tax rates for gasoline, the desirable tax rate should be studied in a way that also takes externalities into account. From the standpoint of an environmental tax that bears external expenses, this paper calculates the optimal tax rate on gasoline in Japan by using the framework of Parry and Small (2005) and the parameters of external costs used in Kanemoto (2007). To be specific, I assume {{a world in which the}} only taxes are the gasoline tax and labor income tax, and I calculate tax rates for gasoline and labor income that the government would maximize social welfare under tax revenue neutral. The optimal tax rate for gasoline that I derive from this analysis is � 118. 3 /liter as the first-best and � 142. 4 /liter as the second-best. The current gasoline tax in Japan (� 53. 8 /liter) is approximately half this estimated optimal level. Among the factors that compose the optimal tax rate, the impact of external congestion cost is substantial, and thus from the perspective of external costs it is desirable to implement policies to eliminate congestion. As uncertain parameters such as estimates of external costs are substantial, it would be preferable to interpret estimates as having substantial ranges. Nevertheless, from the standpoint of the burden of external costs it is obvious that there can be no justification for policies to abolish the <b>temporary</b> <b>rates</b> for gasoline and lower the rates for gasoline taxes. ...|$|R
