500|$|The {{previous}} single from X, [...] "Talk", was {{a tribute}} to the German band Kraftwerk; similarly, [...] "The Hardest Part" [...] was intended by Coldplay to acknowledge American band R.E.M. When asked why the song paid {{a tribute to}} R.E.M.'s lead singer, Michael Stipe, Chris Martin said: [...] "I've lost all respect for fame, but I haven't lost all respect for respect. So the one great <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> <b>being</b> famous is that I get to meet people who I respect. Our relationship is akin to a dog and its master. I'll always look up to him." [...] The band felt the track resembled R.E.M.'s 1991 single, [...] "Losing My Religion". [...] "The Hardest Part" [...] was left out of the album track list when the band sent an early version of X to their record label, Parlophone, but was included when the album was finalised.|$|E
2500|$|Mollie King {{spoke about}} the album's sound saying {{that she had been}} joining playing on the studio [...] "messing around" [...] with a certain track. [...] "30 Days" [...] is about being a part from the person you love and {{counting}} down the minutes until you're back together. [...] "The song really struck a chord with us - it's a situation all of us can relate to, and we think a lot of fans will relate to it as well." [...] Rochelle Humes explained the concept of the single, [...] "It’s a really amazing, catchy song but the sentiment behind it is being all excited and counting down the days to seeing someone when you’ve really been missing that person." [...] The band revealed that they wanted to create an album which was [...] "amazing", [...] "crazy" [...] and [...] "very pop". King said [...] "What About Us" [...] features [...] reggae pop music influence, a little different from what band usually record, but the track is still really [...] "dancey" [...] and [...] "upbeat", as well a good song to dance to on either stage or at a club. When Una Healy was asked what the song was about she said that she [...] "did not know" [...] what the song was exactly about. [...] "To be honest I {{was trying to figure out}} the other day what exactly it's about. I could bullshit away telling you, but I really don't know. But I think it's all about someone driving you crazy." [...] She said she [...] "thinks" [...] that 'What About Us' part means [...] "me and you getting together". She did point out that she did know that the song was about [...] "making you happy" [...] and that the track was good for the summer and will get you on the dancefloor. Rochelle Humes said that the band had recorded a new track, which features a more [...] "edgy" [...] vibe than their previous material. She also said that the track would be released at the end of Summer, which was revealed to be [...] "Gentleman". She also said [...] "It's very dancey", and that they hoped to experiment with other types of music genres on the album, she said: [...] "It's going to be a lot more edgy than our previous stuff and what we are known for. I think we are definitely a pop band so we will carry on doing what we do best." [...] She said that her most favourite <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> <b>being</b> a singer is that she can try out different styles of genres. The band warned fans that the new album would have a [...] "fresh sound". Although, the said they weren't changing the sound too much. [...] "It's a fresh start for a new album as it's got that slight reggae vibe, but is still a dance pop record." ...|$|E

60|$|MARGARET. [continuing] He did, {{just as if}} he {{had known}} me for years. We got on {{together}} like old friends. He asked me would I have some champagne; and I said it would cost too much, but that I would give anything for a dance. I longed to join the people on the stage and dance with them: one of them was the most beautiful dancer I ever saw. He told me he had come there to see her, and that when it was over we could go somewhere where there was dancing. So we went to a place where there was a band in a gallery and the floor cleared for dancing. Very few people danced: the women only wanted to shew off their dresses; but we danced and danced until a lot of them joined in. We got quite reckless; and we had champagne after all. I never enjoyed anything so much. But at last it got spoilt by the Oxford and Cambridge students up for the boat race. They got drunk; and they began to smash things; and the police came in. Then it was quite horrible. The students fought with the police; and the police suddenly got quite brutal, and began to throw everybody downstairs. They attacked the women, who were not doing anything, and treated them just as roughly as they had treated the students. Duvallet got indignant and remonstrated with a policeman, who was shoving a woman though she was going quietly as fast as she could. The policeman flung the woman through the door and then turned on Duvallet. It was then that Duvallet swung his leg like a windmill and knocked the policeman down. And then three policemen rushed at him and carried him out by the arms and legs face downwards. Two more attacked me and gave me a shove to the door. That quite maddened me. I just got in one good bang on the mouth of one of them. All the rest was dreadful. I was rushed through the streets to the police station. They kicked me with their knees; they twisted my arms; they taunted and insulted me; they called me vile names; and I told them what I thought of them, and provoked them to do their worst. Theres one good <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> <b>being</b> hard hurt: it makes you sleep. I slept in that filthy cell with all the other drunks sounder than I should have slept at home. I cant describe how I felt next morning: it was hideous; but the police were quite jolly; and everybody said {{it was a bit of}} English fun, and talked about last year's boat-race night when it had been a great deal worse. I was black and blue and sick and wretched. But the strange thing was that I wasnt sorry; and I'm not sorry. And I dont feel that I did anything wrong, really. [She rises and stretches her arms with a large liberating breath] Now that it's all over I'm rather proud of it; though I know now that I'm not a lady; but whether thats because we're only shopkeepers, or because nobody's really a lady except when theyre treated like ladies, I dont know.
