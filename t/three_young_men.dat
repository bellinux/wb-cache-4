25|$|The {{activism}} from Northerners was {{not widely}} accepted among local residents; it caused great tension between not only {{white and black}} citizens of Meridian, but whites and blacks throughout the South.

25|$|Parkour is {{not defined}} {{by a set of}} rules or guidelines, which has been {{particularly}} attractive to young people, allowing them to explore and engage in the activity on their own terms.

They produced a document pointing out the difficulties of Jewish youth who sought admission to universities where they lived. The lack of opportunities for technical studies, they wrote, was much more serious for Jewish students than in other studies. The problem was “eminiently economic and social”. It meant that in Russia, the Jews were practically excluded from technical professions with the result that they were pushed into commercial occupations.|$|E

25|$|The autopsy {{revealed}} that Kelvin had most certainly died from massive blood loss from an anal injury, probably {{caused by the}} insertion of a blunt object, such as a beer bottle, {{and that he had}} suffered bruising and injuries to his head and back, which were likely to have been caused by blows. Analysis of Kelvin's bloodstream revealed traces of four hypnotic drugs, including Mandrax and Noctec. With the drugs as their only firm lead at that stage, police began sifting through prescriptions for those drugs. During their search they found a prescription for Mandrax issued to a B. von Einem, a name familiar to police as he had been questioned previously over the deaths of <b>three</b> <b>young</b> <b>men</b> and the alleged sexual assault of another.|$|E
25|$|Murals were {{a common}} form of wall {{decoration}} in ancient Rome. The earliest Christian mural paintings come from the catacombs of Rome.

Other popular subjects include the Madonna and Child, Jonah being thrown into the sea, the <b>three</b> <b>young</b> <b>men</b> in the furnace and the Last Supper. In one remarkable mural, in the Catacomb of the Aurelii, is the earliest image of Jesus, as he came to be commonly depicted, as a bearded, Jewish man in long robes. In this particular image he is preaching, not {{to a group of}} people but to a flock of sheep and goats, representing the faithful and the wayward.|$|E

Tunny soon exposes the do-nothing go-nowhere quicksand of their lives ("City of the Damned"). They get riled up, and Johnny challenges his friends to engage ("I Don't Care"). Will's girlfriend, Heather, soon makes an appearance. She is pregnant and doesn't know what to do ("Dearly Beloved"). Johnny borrows money and buys bus tickets to the city for the <b>three</b> <b>young</b> <b>men,</b> eager to escape suburbia. Before the boys are able to leave, Heather tells Will of her pregnancy.

500|$|Allward {{constructed}} the memorial on {{the vantage point}} of Hill 145, the highest point on the ridge. The memorial contains many stylized features, including 20 human figures, which help the viewer in contemplating the structure as a whole. The front wall, normally mistaken for the rear, is [...] high and represents an impenetrable wall of defence. There is a group of figures {{at each end of the}} front wall, next to the base of the steps. The Breaking of the Sword is located at the southern corner of the front wall while Sympathy of the Canadians for the Helpless is located at the northern corner. Collectively, the two groups are The Defenders and represent the ideals for which Canadians gave their lives during the war. There is a cannon barrel draped in laurel and olive branches carved into the wall above each group, to symbolize victory and peace. In Breaking of the Sword, <b>three</b> <b>young</b> <b>men</b> are present, one of whom is crouching and breaking his sword. This statue represents the defeat of militarism and the general desire for peace. This grouping of figures is the most overt image to pacifism in the monument, the breaking of a sword being extremely uncommon in war memorials. The original plan for the sculpture included one figure crushing a German helmet with his foot. It was later decided to dismiss this feature because of its overtly militaristic imagery. In Sympathy of the Canadians for the Helpless, one man stands erect while three other figures, stricken by hunger or disease, are crouched and kneeling around him. The standing man represents Canada's sympathy for the weak and oppressed.|$|E
