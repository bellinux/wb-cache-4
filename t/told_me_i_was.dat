After dropping out of Vassar, she went to Paris for two years to study art. Upon returning to the states, in 1958, she met Lee Strasberg and the meeting {{changed the course of}} her life, Fonda saying, [...] "I went to the Actors Studio and Lee Strasberg told me I had talent. Real talent. It {{was the first time that}} anyone, except my father – who had to say so – <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> good. At anything. It was a turning point in my life. I went to bed thinking about acting. I woke up thinking about acting. It was like the roof had come off my life!" ...|$|E

In 2000, he was inducted in Don Garlits' International Drag Racing Hall of Fame. Hill {{was inducted into}} the Motorsports Hall of Fame of America in 2002. After he was notified of his nomination, he said [...] "It's so much more satisfying to get this award now than posthumously. This way I'll be able to enjoy it. Honestly, it was a sobering moment when they called and <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> being inducted along with some of the people I admired most growing up. It gives you reason to pause for a moment and reflect that maybe some good was accomplished along the way." ...|$|E

In 2013, he {{slightly}} improved when he was briefly in Chase for the Sprint Cup contention. A blown engine early in the Coke Zero 400 caused him to be knocked out of the Chase with a few races left before the Chase began. In the season-ending Ford EcoBoost 400, Menard's tire exploded upon stopping in his pit box; Menard stated, [...] "About a lap later, they <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> on fire. I lost my brakes, and the damned wheel blew right off." ...|$|E
2500|$|Born Marilyn Ann Briggs in Providence, Rhode Island, Chambers {{was raised}} in Westport, Connecticut, in a middle-class household. It is often {{reported}} that {{she was born in}} Westport; however, in a 2007 interview Chambers confirmed she was born in Providence but grew up in Westport. Her father was in advertising and her mother was a nurse. She was the youngest of three children, including a brother, Martin Briggs (keyboardist for 1960s Boston band The Remains), and a sister, Jann Smith. Chambers attended Burr Farms Elementary School, Hillspoint Elementary School, Long Lots Junior High School, and Staples High School. Her father tried to discourage her from pursuing a modeling career, citing brutal competition. [...] "Ever since I was a little kid, I've always wanted to be an actress," [...] Chambers said in 1997. [...] "I was always a performer, a junior Olympic diver, a junior Olympic gymnast. My mother always <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a show-off".|$|E

2500|$|Connolly and {{his older}} sister, Florence (named for their {{maternal}} grandmother, and eighteen months his senior), were cared for by two aunts, Margaret and Mona Connolly, his father's sisters, in their cramped tenement in Stewartville Street, Partick. [...] "My aunts constantly <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> stupid, which still affects me today pretty badly. It’s just a belief that I’m not quite as good as anyone else. It gets worse as you get older. I’m a happy man now but I still have the scars of that." [...] Regarding his sister, Connolly has called her his [...] "great defender". [...] "To this day, he explained in 2009, [...] "Guys say, 'God, your sister... We didn't dare beat you up – your sister was a nightmare'. She used to get after them." [...] In the mid-1960s, Flo was on holiday in Dunoon {{with her husband and}} two children. [...] "My mother said, 'I saw Florence walking along, and I followed her.'" [...] "I said, 'Did you speak to her?' 'Oh, no, I didn't,' she said. I thought, 'Oh, my god. It's like being a ghost while you're still alive.' Walking behind your own child. Having a look. I couldn't bear that." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "On {{the fourth}} day of August we reached the north bank of the Republican River and went into camp. At 9 o'clock that evening, three white men came into camp and {{reported}} {{to me that a}} large band of Sioux warriors [...] camped 25 miles [...] northwest, waiting for an opportunity to attack the Pawnees for several days, anticipating that we would move up the river where buffaloes were feeding. Previous to this, white men visited us and warned us to be on our guard against Sioux attacks, and I was a trifle skeptical as to the truth of the story told by our white visitors. But one of the men, a young man about my age at the time, appeared to be so sincere in his efforts to impress upon me that the warning should be heeded, that I took him to Sky Chief who was in command that day, for a conference. Sky Chief said the men were liars; that they wanted to scare the Pawnees away from the hunting grounds so that white men could kill buffaloes for hides. He <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> squaw and a coward. I took exception to his remarks, and retorted: 'I will go as far as you dare go. Don't forget that.' ...|$|E
2500|$|When {{asked about}} the {{preparation}} she did for the film, actor Aishwarya Rai {{said in an interview}} that both herself and the director Bhansali [...] ".. just like to walk randomly around the sets and [...] "feel". Sometimes I sit quietly and gaze into space or the ground and he captures all that. In fact, the poster picture with me looking away was taken like that. I was looking at the ground, lost in deep thought and he clicked it and told me that he was putting it on his poster. He knows when I am ready to do a scene, when I am in character, and the like. For instance, I delayed going on the set by two days and he did not say anything. He called me on the set and said we would start shooting in five days. On the second day, I tried hair, make-up, and costume. He <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> ready to give my first shot and indeed, I was." [...] About the script Bhansali said that he had worked on the script for 18 months and says, [...] "My film is mainstream in terms of budgets, cast and audience and I had to make sure that I did not hurt anyone but evoked a debate." [...] He points out that without star-clout, such themes will not make any impact on the audience or society. [...] "And at least till my screenplay reaches the interval point, I do not start casting my actors." ...|$|E

[...] "There was something about his form, {{and in the way}} he ran, that looked familiar. Then the taxi driver <b>told</b> <b>me</b> he had two front teeth filled with gold.

2500|$|Show creator William J. Bell {{introduced}} {{the role of}} psychiatrist Dr. Taylor Hamilton Hayes, played by actress Hunter Tylo, during the episode dated June 6, 1990. According to Variety, Bell created Taylor as [...] "a romantic leading lady {{but also as a}} character who could facilitate social issues — and directly partake in a few, too". Previously, Tylo was dismissed from two other soaps, All My Children and Days of Our Lives. The actress noted that her [...] "crazy sense of humor" [...] and [...] "funny business" [...] could have won her the role of Taylor, and she said: [...] "After the audition, they <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> the only one right for the role. I think they liked my 'a woman's gotta do what a woman's gotta do' attitude." [...] Sherilyn Wolter temporarily replaced Tylo in 1990. Tylo vacated the role in May 1994 to pursue other projects, but the soap opera left the door open for her to return, which she did months later. During her absence, the character was presumed to be dead. In March 1996, following Taylor's decreased airtime and rumors circulating of her exit, it was confirmed that the actress was to leave The Bold and the Beautiful after her contract expired that June, to pursue a primetime role on the Fox television drama Melrose Place. Taylor's final appearance was in May 1996. However, in July 1996, Tylo was controversially fired from Melrose Place on the grounds of being pregnant and was replaced by Lisa Rinna. In response, she sued that show's executive producer Aaron Spelling and Spelling Productions for millions of US dollars, and won her case. It was immediately reported that she would return to The Bold and the Beautiful, with head writer and executive producer Bradley Bell issuing the statement: [...] "I am certain that Hunter's talent and ability will continue to be an asset to the show." ...|$|E

But, in my opinion, if <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not formed for love, it follows that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not formed for marriage.

60|$|I wasted a {{long time}} there trying to persuade Goork to accept me at my own valuation, {{but he was too}} canny.
