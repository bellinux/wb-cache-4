5|$|A Sea Symphony (1910), <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{series to}} include a part for full choir, differs from most earlier choral symphonies in that the choir sings in all the movements. The {{extent to which it}} is a true symphony has been debated; in a 2013 study, Alain Frogley {{describes}} it as a hybrid work, with elements of symphony, oratorio and cantata. Its sheer length—about eighty minutes—was unprecedented for an English symphonic work, and within its thoroughly tonal construction it contains harmonic dissonances that pre-echo the early works of Stravinsky which were soon to follow.|$|E

To this day the southbound Northern line platform is <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> four deep level platforms that is not connected to any of the others by deep level walkways.

5|$|Catholic priests {{had come}} to Rosendale as early as 1840, and the first mass in the village was held in a cooper's shop. The {{original}} Church of St. Peter was completed {{in the summer of}} 1850, and the first mass in that building was held on August15. The church was not officially incorporated until April29, 1865. A newer, larger building was constructed in 1876, on the same road as the village's rail depot. The new building followed an English Gothic architecture style. It was made of bricks, created near the North River, and was ornamented with yellow bricks from Perth Amboy, New Jersey, and sandstone from Amherst, New York. The first mass in the new church occurred on December25, 1876; the building's total construction cost was $31,000.
