Douglas Dillon, who donated its unique wallpaper, a Chinese print from 1770. Dillon's wife Phyllis purchased <b>the</b> <b>wallpaper</b> {{on the recommendation of}} interior designer Eleanor Brown in 1964. <b>The</b> <b>wallpaper</b> was removed and refurbished between 1982 and 1988. The room is furnished with 18th century English pieces, along with Chinese vases from the Ming and Qing (Kangxi reign) dynasties. The Dillon Drawing Room is used by resident heads of state and chiefs of government to formally receive visitors.|$|E

40|$|Mould {{germination}} and {{the growth}} rate on wallpapers with different physical properties and the surface structures Seung Ho Ryu and Hyeun Jun Moon Mould infestation problems in building are a complex phenomenon involving various causes such as environmental conditions, substrates, exposure time, and so on. The physical properties of building materials, e. g. surface structure, can be a key factor for mould germination and growth. The {{aim of this study}} is to determine the influence of the hygroscopic properties and surface structures of the wall-papers on the mould growth. An experimental study was conducted to characterize the hygroscopic properties and surface structures of <b>the</b> <b>wallpapers.</b> Four types of wallpapers with low chemical emis-sions were selected in order to exclude influence on chemicals on mould germination. Cross sections of <b>the</b> selected <b>wallpapers</b> were observed in order to characterize the surface structure of <b>wallpapers</b> using <b>the</b> scanning electron microscope. Three different fungi species were inoculated on <b>the</b> <b>wallpapers,</b> and mould growth on <b>the</b> selected <b>wallpapers</b> were observed for about two weeks. The results showed that <b>the</b> <b>wallpapers</b> with irregular patterns or a flat surface structure could delay mould growth. Wallpapers with higher moisture sorption capability would limit the development of mould growth under the experimental condition. Our study has shown a clear correlation between the mould growth rate and hygroscopic properties of <b>the</b> <b>wallpapers...</b>|$|R

5|$|Although to many she is {{best known}} for Demi's Birthday Suit, art aficionados {{consider}} her most famous work Disappearing Model. The work appeared on Ripley's Believe it or Not!. In the trompe l'oeil body painting, the face and body of the model are almost indistinguishable from the red and blue and yellow flowers of <b>the</b> <b>wallpaper</b> in the background. Her first body paintings was also memorable as she painted a moko on a female Ford Modeling Agency fashion model named Jana, which is a tabooed employment of a traditionally male ritual face mask. An example from Gair's website of her ability to trick the eye into seeing a three-dimensional subject blend with a two-dimensional background is seen in a photograph of a pregnant Elle Macpherson. Other examples of this technique include the cover of her first book (pictured below) and images from within this book.|$|E
5|$|Lauren is interrogated by Mulder and Scully, {{and the two}} unknown {{agents that}} called them in, {{who say they are}} {{involved}} because they believe Graves and Dorlund's company sold technology to the Isfahan. Lauren admits to Mulder and Scully that the sales did indeed take place and that she believes Dorlund had Graves killed. After hearing Lauren recount the eerie circumstances that she believes are being caused by Graves' spirit, Scully - the usually reserved skeptic - readily accepts her story. Mulder is confused but, after Lauren leaves, Scully admits she was just humoring her. The agents search the company's premises, but are unable to find any evidence. When Dorlund attacks Lauren with a letter opener Graves' spirit takes it and cuts open <b>the</b> <b>wallpaper,</b> revealing a disc with evidence. Weeks later, Lauren starts her new job, but it appears that Graves' spirit may have followed her there.|$|E

5|$|Three {{weeks of}} filming were {{spent in the}} Hotel Earle, a set created by art {{director}} Dennis Gassner. The film's climax required a huge spreading fire in the hotel's hallway, which the Coens originally planned to add digitally in post-production. When they decided to use real flames, however, the crew built a large alternate set in an abandoned aircraft hangar at Long Beach. A series of gas jets were installed behind the hallway, and <b>the</b> <b>wallpaper</b> was perforated for easy penetration. As Goodman ran through the hallway, a man on an overhead catwalk opened each jet, giving {{the impression of a}} fire racing ahead of Charlie. Each take required a rebuild of the apparatus, and a second hallway (sans fire) stood ready nearby for filming pick-up shots between takes. The final scene was shot near Zuma Beach, as was the image of a wave crashing against a rock.|$|E

It was printed on some banknotes of the Russian Provisional Government (1917) and some sovznaks (1918-1922). In 1919 it was approved as insignia for the Kalmyk formations, and for a short period had a certain popularity amongst some artists, politics and army groups. Also it was present on icons, vestments and clerical clothing but in World War II it was removed, becoming by association, a symbol of the German occupation.|$|E

25|$|Despite this redecoration, the East Room was {{nonetheless}} somewhat shabby by 1861. On April 18, 1861, about 60 militiamen from Kansas took up temporary {{residence in the}} East Room pending construction of barracks {{for them in the}} city. They did serious damage to the carpet, and sometimes shot bullets into the walls. Mary Todd Lincoln refurbished the room with damask drapes, lace curtains, wallpaper, and a new $2,500 carpet later that year. <b>The</b> <b>wallpaper</b> was heavy patterned velvet cloth paper from Paris in crimson, garnet, and gold, and supplied by William H. Carryl & Brother of New York. The floor covering was an Axminster carpet woven in Glasgow, Scotland. The largest loom in the world was needed to weave the carpet, which covered the entire floor. The drapes were crimson with heavy gold fringe and numerous gold tassels, while the lace curtains behind them were imported from Switzerland.|$|E
25|$|During the Clinton {{administration}} the Committee for the Preservation of the White House {{and then}} Curator of the White House Betty Monkman began initial assessment for the refurbishment of the room. While {{most of the}} furniture and artwork {{in the room was}} found to be of similar related periods, and much was associated with the presidency of Lincoln, the room's carpeting, mantel and anemic painted walls were not of the period. Initial decisions were made to replace the existing Neoclassical mantel with a mid-19th-century style mantel design, and to use more pattern as would have been used in Lincoln's day for <b>the</b> <b>wallpaper</b> and carpet. Two etchings and a drawing consistently showed a diamond patterned wallpaper and a Renaissance Revival style gas chandelier. A small oil painting showed a color representation of the same diamond patterned wall paper in dark green, mustard and teal.|$|E

This article demonstrates how the CoBRA (Conservation-based Research and Analysis) methodology can be applied to increase our understanding of the history of interiors. The conservation process adds a new perspective to the historiography of the papered interior and its significance in the interior design process. By combining archival research with access to <b>the</b> original <b>wallpapers</b> during <b>the</b> retrieval and subsequent conservation process, it has been possible to construct an account of this commercial building’s decorative schemes.

40|$|In {{the nineteenth}} century, {{imported}} wallpapers covered interior walls of Persian palaces and mansions, of which Vasiq-Ansari House in Isfahan, Iran, exhibits very highly elaborated examples.

Results indicated that chrome yellow, artificial ultramarine blue, brass metallic leaf, an organic red dyestuff (probably cochineal), and a copper-based green were used as colourants in <b>the</b> <b>wallpapers.</b> Different shades of brown were achieved by mixing various combinations of red lead, carbon black, and calcium carbonate. The white calcium carbonate was also used as a ground layer, applied to a paper support composed of bast and softwood fibres. Based on knowledge of the materials used, these wallpapers are most probably manufactured from the mid- to latenineteenth century...|$|R
