Ambulances, the developed country standard, are costly and not practical for the road conditions present in many countries. Indeed, there may be no roads at all.

British Expeditionary Force troops returning from Dunkirk were processed at Uxbridge. In mid-1940, staff at the station processed an average of 2,500 recruits and experienced troops per week.|$|E
40|$|This reports {{is on the}} {{research}} of a design of a motorised <b>tricycle</b> for disabled person. This <b>tricycle</b> is specifically designed to suit wheelchair occupants of healthy upper torso with pelvic to foot restraint. It is also designed to suit a commonly available wheelchair. Existing <b>tricycle</b> for disable requires a disabled person to dismount from the wheelchair onto the <b>tricycle.</b> The motorised <b>tricycle</b> in this project is designed to overcome this problem by allowing the disabled person to wheel up or down his wheelchair onto or down the <b>tricycle.</b> This is achieved using a specially designed platform that allows the wheelchair to be wheeled up or down. The prototype of this <b>tricycle</b> have been fabricated.

5|$|Bicycles and {{motorcycles}} {{are both}} single-track vehicles and so their motions have many fundamental attributes in common and are {{fundamentally different from}} {{and more difficult to}} study than other wheeled vehicles such as dicycles, <b>tricycles,</b> and quadracycles. As with unicycles, bikes lack lateral stability when stationary, and under most circumstances can only remain upright when moving forward. Experimentation and mathematical analysis have shown that a bike stays upright when it is steered to keep its center of mass over its wheels. This steering is usually supplied by a rider, or in certain circumstances, by the bike itself. Several factors, including geometry, mass distribution, and gyroscopic effect all contribute in varying degrees to this self-stability, but long-standing hypotheses and claims that any single effect, such as gyroscopic or trail, is solely responsible for the stabilizing force have been discredited.|$|E

A tandem <b>tricycle</b> has three wheels in a line and is ridden by two people. There are different ways to construct a tandem <b>tricycle.</b> One simple way is to connect two bikes into one tandem <b>tricycle</b> by removing the front wheel of the rear bike and connecting its front fork at the rear frame of the front bike. In this thesis, fixtures for connecting two bikes into one tandem <b>tricycle</b> are designed and constructed. A CAD model of the tandem <b>tricycle</b> is created. The kinematics of a tandem <b>tricycle</b> in turning motion is studied. A quasi-static analysis of steady state of a tandem <b>tricycle</b> in a circular motion is studied. The effect of the head angle of the rear bicycle in turning motion is also studied.

On {{the basis}} of the <b>tricycle</b> rigid virtual {{prototyping}} model,flexible body virtual prototyping model with dynamic characteristics was constructed via the addition of <b>tricycle</b> parts mass, inertial characteristics, elasticity of elastic damping components and conditions about damping, road and tyres.

As the simulation results suggested, the <b>tricycle</b> rigid virtual prototyping model could be applied to acceleration performance, braking performance, vehicle riding comfort and other simulation analysis, therefore, ideas were provided in further development of design manufacturing technology...|$|R

Following lengthy discussions between the <b>Tricycle</b> and UKJFF, the <b>Tricycle</b> has now withdrawn its objection and invited back the UK Jewish Film Festival on the same terms as in previous years with no restrictions on funding from the Embassy of Israel in London."
