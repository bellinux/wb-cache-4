5|$|While the eze Nri lived {{relatively}} secluded {{from his}} followers, he employed {{a group of}} Jesuit-like officials called ndi Nri. These were ritual specialists, easily identifiable by facial scarifications or ichi, who traveled with ritual staffs of peace in order to purify the earth from human crimes. The ndi Nri exercised authority over wide areas of Igboland and had the power <b>to</b> <b>install</b> <b>the</b> next eze Nri.|$|E
5|$|In 1338 Southampton was raided by French forces; the town's defences proved inadequate, {{particularly}} {{along the}} quays {{on the west}} {{and south of the}} city. Edward III ordered some immediate improvements to Southampton's town walls {{but it was not until}} the 1360s that substantial work began. Over the coming decades the town was entirely enclosed by a 2km (1.25-mile) long stone wall, with 29 towers and eight gates. With the advent of gunpowder weapons in the 1360s and 1370s, Southampton was one of the first towns in England <b>to</b> <b>install</b> <b>the</b> new technology to existing fortifications and to build new towers specifically to house cannon.|$|E

5|$|On November 21, 2010 Microsoft {{sold the}} game {{including}} its two expansion packs {{as a part}} of its relaunch of its Games for Windows Live platform for 10 cents or 10 Microsoft points. The overwhelming and unanticipated demand created a shortage of account keys leaving some of those who had purchased the game through the promotion unable <b>to</b> <b>install</b> <b>the</b> game. Microsoft remedied this issue by assuring all customers who purchased the game that account keys would be generated within one week and automatically uploaded to each profile. As a result of this promotion the overall sales of the game have sharply increased.|$|E

5|$|Bowling Green, Kentucky, was {{designated}} the Confederate capital of Kentucky at a convention in nearby Russellville. Due {{to the military}} situation in the state, the provisional government was exiled and traveled with the Army of Tennessee {{for most of its}} existence. For a short time in the autumn of 1862, the Confederate Army controlled Frankfort, the only time a Union capital was captured by Confederate forces. During this occupation, General Braxton Bragg attempted <b>to</b> <b>install</b> <b>the</b> provisional government as the permanent authority in the Commonwealth. However, Union General Don Carlos Buell ambushed the inauguration ceremony and drove the provisional government from the state for the final time. From that point forward, the government existed primarily on paper and was dissolved {{at the end of the}} war.|$|E
5|$|Burchard was {{appointed}} as treasurer of York by King Richard I of England on 15 September 1189, but his appointment {{was at first}} opposed by the newly chosen Archbishop of York, Geoffrey. Along with Burchard, Richard also appointed Henry Marshal the dean; and Roger of London the abbot of Selby Abbey. Because of Geoffrey's objections, his estates were confiscated by the king until he submitted. Burchard and Marshal retaliated by accusing the archbishop-elect of being a murderer {{as well as the}} son of a prostitute. When Geoffrey visited York in October 1189, both Burchard and Marshal requested their installation in their offices, but Geoffrey refused to do so until he himself was confirmed in his archbishopric by the papacy. Geoffrey's refusal <b>to</b> <b>install</b> <b>the</b> royal nominees meant the archbishop-elect was out of favour with Richard, and the king refused to allow Geoffrey's officials to travel to Rome to request confirmation of the archbishopric.|$|E

5|$|During her {{exploration}} of the grounds, Adrienne finds a secret chapel hidden behind a bricked off fireplace. After opening a locked box atop an altar, Adrienne unknowingly releases Carno's demon, which promptly possesses Don. Don starts acting menacingly and aggressively toward Adrienne and becomes progressively worse as time passes, culminating in a controversial scene in which he rapes Adrienne. Eventually, Adrienne meets Harriet Hockaday (V. Joy Lee), a superstitious vagrant, and her strong but dim-witted son, Cyrus (Steven W. Bailey), who are secretly living in a barn on the estate. After Adrienne agrees to let them stay, they volunteer to help around the mansion. When a technician named Mike (Carl Neimic) visits the mansion <b>to</b> <b>install</b> <b>the</b> phone, Don screams at him in a jealous rage, warning him {{to stay away from}} his wife, much to Adrienne's horror. Later, unbeknownst to Adrienne, Don bludgeons Mike to death.|$|E
5|$|Enjebi, Aomon, and Runit Islands {{were cleared}} of {{vegetation}} and graded level {{to make it}} easier <b>to</b> <b>install</b> <b>the</b> required instrumentation, and a causeway was built between Aomon and Bijire so the instrument cables could be run from the test tower on Aomon to the control station on Bijire. The detonations were ordered so that later test areas would suffer minimal fallout from the earlier shots. The Army component, Task Group 7.2, was responsible for construction work. It consisted of the 1220th Provisional Engineer Battalion, with the 1217th and 1218th Composite Service Platoons, the 18th Engineer Construction Company and 1219th Signal Service Platoon; Companies D and E of the 2nd Engineer Special Brigade's 532nd Engineer Boat and Shore Regiment; the 461st Transportation Amphibious Truck Company; 854th Transportation Port Company; 401st CIC Detachment; and the Naval Shore Base Detachment.|$|E
5|$|Ground for Three Rivers Stadium {{was broken}} on April 25, 1968. Due to the Steelers' suggestions, the stadium's design {{was changed to}} enclose centerfield. Construction continued, though it became plagued with {{problems}} such as thieves stealing materials from the building site. In November 1969, Arthur Gratz asked the city for an additional $3million ($ million today), which was granted. In January 1970, the opening target date of the stadium was set for May 29; however, because of a failure <b>to</b> <b>install</b> <b>the</b> lights on schedule, opening day was pushed back to July 16. The stadium was named in February 1969 for to its location at {{the confluence of the}} Allegheny River and Monongahela River, which forms the Ohio River. It would sometimes be called The House That Clemente Built after Pirates' right-fielder Roberto Clemente.|$|E

5|$|In 1976, {{the fire}} {{department}} moved to Fire Station #6 with the bulb; the bulb socket's cord was severed for fear that unscrewing the bulb could damage it. It was deprived of electricity for only 22 minutes during the transfer, which was made in a specially designed box and with full firetruck escort. An electrician was on hand <b>to</b> <b>install</b> <b>the</b> bulb into the new fire station's emergency generator. Ripley's Believe It Or Not stated that the short delay would not mar the bulb's continuous burning record. In 2001, the bulb's 100th birthday was celebrated with a community barbecue and live music. Since that move, the bulb has run continuously for 38 years; previously it had only been off the grid for {{short periods of time}} (e.g. a week in 1937 for a renovation and the odd power outage).|$|E
5|$|Little to {{no major}} {{modifications}} {{were made to}} the two active Colorados in the opening months of the U.S.'s entry into the war; all of the battleships in the Pacific Fleet had a constant order to be ready to sail within 48 hours in case of a Japanese attempt to invade Hawaii or the West Coast and could not be spared for any major yard work. Colorado was hurried through the rest of her refit with the addition of essential items like radar, splinter protection, 14 Oerlikon 20mm and four 1.1in light anti-aircraft guns; Maryland received a similar treatment later, the only difference being 16 20mm's and no 1.1in. Although tower masts were constructed for Colorado and Maryland and a majority of the old cage masts were cut down by the ships' crews in the beginning of 1942, the ships could not be spared the time needed <b>to</b> <b>install</b> <b>the</b> new masts. The tower masts were placed into storage and not used until early 1944.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{the leaders}} of Kentucky's Confederate {{government}} had remained in Chattanooga, Tennessee, awaiting Governor Hawes' return. They finally departed on September 18, and caught up with Bragg and Smith in Lexington, Kentucky on October 2. Bragg had been disappointed {{with the number of}} soldiers volunteering for Confederate service in Kentucky; wagon loads of weapons that had been shipped to the Commonwealth to arm the expected enlistees remained unissued. Desiring to enforce the Confederate Conscription Act to boost recruitment, Bragg decided <b>to</b> <b>install</b> <b>the</b> provisional government in the recently captured state capital of Frankfort. On October 4, 1862, Hawes was inaugurated as governor by the Confederate legislative council. In the celebratory atmosphere of the inauguration ceremony, however, the Confederate forces let their guard down, and were ambushed and forced to retreat by Buell's artillery.|$|E
