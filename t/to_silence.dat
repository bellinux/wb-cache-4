50|$|There are {{at least}} {{eighteen}} histone deacetylases in Arabidopsis (Hollender et al. 2008). Genome-wide association mapping has shown that deacetylation of histones by Histone Deacetylase 2B negatively affects dormancy. The remodeling of chromatin by histone deacetylase leads <b>to</b> <b>silencing</b> of genes that control plant hormones such as ethylene, abscisic acid, and gibberelin which maintain dormancy. Additionally, Histone Deacetylase A6 and A19 activity contributes <b>to</b> <b>silencing</b> of Cytochrome P450 707A and activation of NINE-CIS-EPOXYCAROTENOID DIOXYGENASE 4, 9. Both of these actions lead to increased abscisic acid (Nonogaki et al. 2014).|$|R
40|$|In Malaysia, {{the right}} <b>to</b> remain <b>silence</b> may be {{enforced}} by the accused during the police investigation or at trial.

This is the new scenario in our system of criminal justice. The right <b>to</b> remain <b>silence</b> is actually the right that we inherited from common law system.

40|$|Multi-KH domain {{proteins}} {{are highly}} evolutionarily conserved proteins that associate to polyribosomes {{and participate in}} RNA metabolism. Recent evidence indicates that multi-KH domain proteins {{also contribute to the}} structural organization of heterochromatin both in mammals and Drosophila. Here, we show that the multi-KH domain protein of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Scp 160 p, contributes <b>to</b> <b>silencing</b> at telomeres and at the mating-type locus, but not <b>to</b> ribosomal <b>silencing.</b> The contribution of Scp 160 p <b>to</b> <b>silencing</b> is independent of its binding to the ribosome as deletion of the last two KH domains, which mediate ribosomal binding, has no effect on silencing. Disruption of SCP 160 increases cell ploidy but this effect is also independent of the contribution of Scp 160 p <b>to</b> telomeric <b>silencing</b> as strong relief of silencing is observed in Δscp 160 cells with normal ploidy and, vice versa, Δscp 160 cells with highly increased ploidy show no significant silencing defects. The TPE phenotype of Δscp 160 cells associates to a decreased Sir 3 p deposition at telomeres and, in good agreement, silencing is rescued by SIR 3 overexpression and in a Δrif 1 Δrif 2 mutant. Scp 160 p shows a distinct perinuclear localization that is independent of its ability to bind ribosomes. Moreover, telomere clustering at the nuclear envelope is perturbed in Δscp 160 cells and disruption of the histone deacetylase RPD 3, which is known to improve telomere clustering, rescues telomeric silencing in Δscp 160 cells. These results are discussed {{in the context of a}} model in which Scp 160 p contributes <b>to</b> <b>silencing</b> by helping telomere clustering. © 2006 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.

40|$|AbstractBackground: Position-dependent gene {{silencing}} in yeast involves many factors, including the four HIR genes and nucleosome assembly proteins Asf 1 p and chromatin assembly factor I (CAF-I, encoded by the CAC 1 – 3 genes). Both cacΔ asf 1 Δ and cacΔ hirΔ double mutants display synergistic reductions in heterochromatic {{gene silencing}}. However, {{the relationship between}} the contributions of HIR genes and ASF 1 <b>to</b> <b>silencing</b> has not previously been explored. Results: Our biochemical and genetic studies of yeast Asf 1 p revealed links to Hir protein function. In vitro, an active histone deposition complex was formed from recombinant yeast Asf 1 p and histones H 3 and H 4 that lack a newly synthesized acetylation pattern. This Asf 1 p/H 3 /H 4 complex generated micrococcal nuclease–resistant DNA in the absence of DNA replication and stimulated nucleosome assembly activity by recombinant yeast CAF-I during DNA synthesis. Also, Asf 1 p bound to the Hir 1 p and Hir 2 p proteins in vitro and in cell extracts. In vivo, the HIR 1 and ASF 1 genes contributed <b>to</b> <b>silencing</b> the heterochromatic HML locus via the same genetic pathway. Deletion of either HIR 1 or ASF 1 eliminated telomeric gene silencing in combination with pol 30 – 8, encoding an altered form of the DNA polymerase processivity factor PCNA that prevents CAF-I from contributing <b>to</b> <b>silencing.</b> Conversely, other pol 30 alleles prevented Asf 1 /Hir proteins from contributing <b>to</b> <b>silencing.</b> Conclusions: Yeast CAF-I and Asf 1 p cooperate to form nucleosomes in vitro. In vivo, Asf 1 p and Hir proteins physically interact and together promote heterochromatic gene silencing in a manner requiring PCNA. This Asf 1 /Hir silencing pathway functionally overlaps with CAF-I activity...|$|R
