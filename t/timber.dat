5|$|In 1989, annual <b>timber</b> harvest revenue {{on federal}} forest land {{nationwide}} peaked at $1.5 billion. Following that year, {{the impact of}} overharvesting and increased environmental concerns began to negatively impact <b>timber</b> sales on the O lands. In 1994, the federal Northwest Forest Plan was implemented. Designed to guide forest management of federal lands while protecting old-growth forest habitat for endangered species such as the Northern spotted owl, the plan restricted the land available for <b>timber</b> harvest. By 1998, revenue on federal forest lands fell {{to a third of}} the peak 1989 revenue, with areas in the Northwest particularly hard-hit.|$|E

30|$|The {{bending test}} results showed no {{significance}} at the 5  % significance level on average regarding the Young’s modulus {{obtained by the}} longitudinal vibration method, and the apparent Young’s modulus for green round <b>timbers</b> and air-dried round <b>timbers.</b> Meanwhile, the average bending strength showed significant differences at the 5  % significance level between green round <b>timbers</b> and air-dried round <b>timbers.</b> When considering that the average for green round <b>timbers</b> would actually increase because the green round <b>timbers</b> included those that did not show failure, {{it was difficult to}} simply conclude that there were differences between green round <b>timbers</b> and air-dried round <b>timbers.</b> The 5  % PTL of bending strength was slightly higher for air-dried round <b>timbers</b> than green round <b>timbers,</b> although we should also consider the fact that the bending strength of green round <b>timbers</b> would actually increase.|$|R

5|$|Paleoenvironmental {{evidence}} shows that between the 9th and 11th centuries the area around Buckton Castle was cleared of woodland. This left little <b>timber,</b> and may have factored into the use of stone as a building material. The earliest castles in England typically used <b>timber,</b> at least {{when they were first}} built, and building in stone was more expensive than earth and <b>timber.</b> It became more common to use stone in 12th-century castles, and Buckton is amongst the earliest masonry castles in North West England.|$|E
5|$|Since 1916, the 18 {{counties}} {{where the}} O lands are located have received payments from the United States government as {{compensation for the}} loss of <b>timber</b> and tax revenue, beginning as a 50% share of <b>timber</b> revenue on those lands but changing over the years as <b>timber</b> production decreased. The governments of several of the counties have come to depend upon the O land revenue as an important source of income for schools and county services.|$|E

50|$|Historically, the <b>timbers</b> {{would have}} been hewn square using a felling axe and then surface-finished with a broadaxe. If required, smaller <b>timbers</b> were ripsawn from the hewn baulks using pitsaws or frame saws. Today, <b>timbers</b> are more {{commonly}} bandsawn, and the <b>timbers</b> may sometimes be machine-planed on all four sides.|$|R
5|$|The early European {{economy of}} the Catlins during the 1830s and 1840s centred on whaling and sealing. The {{exploitation}} of the forests for <b>timber</b> started in the 1860s with {{the rapid growth of}} the city of Dunedin {{as a result of the}} goldrush of 1861–62. In the early 1870s more <b>timber</b> cargo was loaded at Owaka than at any other New Zealand port. Forestry and sawmilling declined in the late 1880s once the easily accessible <b>timber</b> had been removed. The extension of the railway beyond Owaka breathed new life into these industries, however, with activity peaking during the 1920s.|$|E
5|$|The three sheds {{surrounding}} the lighthouse are the workshop to the south, the former powerhouse {{to the west}} and the fuel store to the north. They are all rectangular structures, <b>timber</b> framed and fibro clad with corrugated fibrous cement gable roofs. The workshop appears to be built on the remains of one of the early stone buildings, lying on a plinth with sandstone steps. It consists of two rooms with pivoting sash windows and <b>timber</b> framed doors and no internal lining. The former powerhouse and the fuel store have reinforced concrete floors, fibro lining, double-hung sash windows and double <b>timber</b> framed doors.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Timbers</b> Army is {{composed}} of several different subgroups. These subgroups are unique in their own fashion and consist of many different personalities. However, all subgroups fall under the <b>Timbers</b> Army umbrella. Many of the subgroups produce their own special apparel and other items while the proceeds go directly back to <b>Timbers</b> Army causes. Unlike many teams in Major League Soccer, the <b>Timbers</b> Army is the only recognized independent supporters group of the Portland <b>Timbers,</b> while many other clubs have several supporters groups. The subgroups of the <b>Timbers</b> Army rival the size of many other supporters groups in MLS.|$|R
50|$|In 1978, the NASL Portland <b>Timbers</b> bought Charles' {{contract}} from Cardiff City. He remained with the <b>Timbers</b> through the 1981 outdoor season. However, injuries began to hamper Charles and in 1981, he played only 4 {{games with the}} <b>Timbers</b> and {{did not return to}} the team the next year. In addition to playing for the Timbers' outdoor team, Charles had played 9 games for the <b>Timbers</b> during the 1980-1981 NASL indoor season. His jersey, number 3, was retired by the <b>Timbers</b> after his death in 2003. He was honoured by the <b>Timbers</b> during a game against the Seattle Sounders on 24 June 2012 by a large tifo held up by the <b>Timbers</b> Army {{prior to the start of}} the game.|$|R
5|$|<b>Timber</b> {{industry}} activity further contaminates river water, {{for example}} in the increased sediment runoff that results from clearcuts.

5|$|Until the 12thcentury, stone-built {{and earth}} and <b>timber</b> castles were contemporary, {{but by the}} late 12thcentury the number of castles being built went into decline. This has been partly {{attributed}} to the higher cost of stone-built fortifications, and the obsolescence of <b>timber</b> and earthwork sites, which meant it was preferable to build in more durable stone. Although superseded by their stone successors, <b>timber</b> and earthwork castles {{were by no means}} useless. This is evidenced by the continual maintenance of <b>timber</b> castles over long periods, sometimes several centuries; Owain Glyndŵr's 11th-century <b>timber</b> castle at Sycharth was still in use by the start of the 15thcentury, its structure having been maintained for four centuries.|$|E
5|$|Various beetles in the Bostrichoidea {{superfamily}} {{attack the}} dry, seasoned wood used as structural <b>timber</b> in houses {{and to make}} furniture. In most cases, it is the larvae that do the damage; these are invisible from {{the outside of the}} <b>timber,</b> but are chewing away at the wood in the interior of the item. Examples of these are the powderpost beetles, which attack the sapwood of hardwoods, and the furniture beetles, which attacks softwoods, including plywood. The damage has already been done by the time the adult beetles bore their way out, leaving neat round holes behind them. The first that a householder knows about the beetle damage is often when a chair leg breaks off or a piece of structural <b>timber</b> caves in. Prevention is through chemical treatment of the <b>timber</b> prior to its use in construction or in furniture manufacture.|$|E

5|$|Actually, {{the warning}} {{on the early}} flags {{was not meant to}} depict the <b>timber</b> {{rattlesnake}} as being ferocious or the American people as being warlike. The true message was that the citizens of the Colonies were a peaceable and freedom-loving people, but if England’s King George III continued with his oppressive policies toward the Colonies, then they would respond with great wrath. This response would be much like that of a <b>timber</b> rattlesnake, which is peaceable and slow to anger, but will attack aggressively when provoked and will not stop fighting until the enemy retreats.|$|E

Other camps were established at the eastern end of Stirling Park on the hills opposite modern Lotus Bay. The first of these was contractor John Howie's settlement (1922–30), consisting of 25 <b>timber</b> cottages for his married men and <b>timber</b> barracks (Hostel Camp) for his single men. Two other single men's tent camps were established nearby—Old Tradesmen's Camp (1923–27) and No 1 Labourers Camp (1924–27).

5|$|In {{contrast}} to Hiroshima, {{almost all of}} the buildings were of old-fashioned Japanese construction, consisting of <b>timber</b> or timber-framed buildings with <b>timber</b> walls (with or without plaster) and tile roofs. Many of the smaller industries and business establishments were also situated in buildings of <b>timber</b> or other materials not designed to withstand explosions. Nagasaki had been permitted to grow for many years without conforming to any definite city zoning plan; residences were erected adjacent to factory buildings and to each other almost as closely as possible throughout the entire industrial valley. On the day of the bombing, an estimated 263,000 people were in Nagasaki, including 240,000 Japanese residents, 10,000 Korean residents, 2,500 conscripted Korean workers, 9,000 Japanese soldiers, 600 conscripted Chinese workers, and 400 Allied prisoners of war in a camp to the north of Nagasaki.|$|E

50|$|Sattler and Reichenbach {{studied the}} {{short-term}} effects of <b>timbering</b> on the Peaks of Otter salamander. Twelve sites were used, with four sites each {{randomly assigned to}} one of three treatments: clearcut (complete canopy removal), shelterwood (partial canopy removal), and reference (no <b>timbering).</b> Population baselines were established the year before <b>timbering</b> began, by conducting night mark/recapture surveys of surface-active animals. Establishing a baseline is a vital step in studying <b>timbering</b> effects, as salamander distribution and dispersal patterns may be clumped, and without a preliminary reference point, it may not be possible to separate dispersal effects and individual site differences from <b>timbering</b> effects. Subsequent surveys were conducted in the next year, after <b>timbering</b> was complete and the year following.|$|R
