5|$|Once in power, Adolf Hitler soon {{banned the}} Social Democratic Party and other {{political}} organizations. Concerned for his family's safety, Kellner moved {{to the town of}} Laubach in Hesse, where he became the chief justice inspector: the judicial officer in charge of the administration of the courthouse.

5|$|Andersen {{was accused}} of crimes on several {{occasions}} in the post-war years, but was most often acquitted in court. Amongst <b>the</b> <b>crimes</b> <b>of</b> which he was charged but acquitted in court was the theft of building materials in 1954. Another time he was tricked into lending his car to two people who broke into a goldsmith's shop in Tønsberg. Strongly intoxicated {{at the time of}} the crime, he was charged but fully acquitted. In 1955 he was, however, convicted and sentenced to 36days in prison for selling 30bottles of denatured alcohol, alcohol that was supposed to have been used at his factory.|$|E

5|$|As {{an escaped}} POW, Pechersky was conscripted into a special penal battalions, {{conforming}} to Stalin's Order No. 270 {{and was sent}} to the front to fight German forces in some of the toughest engagements of the war. Pechersky's battalion commander, Major Andreev, was so shocked by his description of Sobibor that he permitted Pechersky to go to Moscow and speak to the Commission of Inquiry of <b>the</b> <b>Crimes</b> <b>of</b> Fascist-German Aggressors and their Accomplices. The Commission listened to Pechersky and published the report Uprising in Sobibor based on his testimony. This report was included in the Black Book, one of the first comprehensive compilations about the Holocaust, written by Vasily Grossman and Ilya Ehrenburg.|$|E
5|$|Both {{civilian}} and military authorities considered the Wehrmachtbericht to be a vital instrument of German home-front mobilisation, the civilian contribution to the German war effort, especially after the defeat in the Battle of Stalingrad. According to historians Wolfram Wette and Daniel Uziel, the final 9 May 1945 communiqué {{laid the foundation for}} the myth of the clean Wehrmacht, the notion that the Wehrmacht had fought honourably and was not implicated in <b>the</b> <b>crimes</b> <b>of</b> the Nazi regime, for which (according to the myth) only the SS bore responsibility.|$|E

5|$|It isn't a {{personal}} pain which has brought me here, {{as is the}} case in the majority of these people, but rather recognition of the symbolic nature of Katyń. Russians and Poles, tortured to death, lie here together. It seems very important to me that the truth should be spoken about what took place, for only with the truth can the new Soviet leadership distance itself from <b>the</b> <b>crimes</b> <b>of</b> Stalin and the NKVD. Only the truth can serve as the basis of true friendship between the Soviet and the Polish peoples. The truth will make a path for itself. I am convinced of this by the very fact that I was able to travel here.|$|E
5|$|The Bribery Act 2010 (c.23) is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom {{that covers}} the {{criminal}} law relating to bribery. Introduced to Parliament in the Queen's Speech in 2009 after several decades of reports and draft bills, the Act received the Royal Assent on 8 April 2010 following cross-party support. Initially scheduled to enter into force in April 2010, this was changed to 1 July 2011. The Act repeals all previous statutory and common law provisions in relation to bribery, instead replacing them with <b>the</b> <b>crimes</b> <b>of</b> bribery, being bribed, the bribery of foreign public officials, {{and the failure of}} a commercial organisation to prevent bribery on its behalf.|$|E
5|$|The Texas Chain Saw Massacre is a 1974 American horror film {{directed}} by Tobe Hooper and written and co-produced by Hooper and Kim Henkel. It stars Marilyn Burns, Paul A. Partain, Edwin Neal, Jim Siedow and Gunnar Hansen, who respectively portray Sally Hardesty, Franklin Hardesty, the hitchhiker, the proprietor, and Leatherface. The film follows {{a group of}} friends who fall victim to a family of cannibals while on their way to visit an old homestead. Although it was marketed as a true story to attract a wider audience and as a subtle commentary on the era's political climate, its plot is entirely fictional; however, the character of Leatherface and minor plot details were inspired by <b>the</b> <b>crimes</b> <b>of</b> real-life murderer Ed Gein.|$|E

40|$|There is a {{problematic}} overlap between bona fide humanitarian intervention and <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> <b>of</b> aggression. Under international law, <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> <b>of</b> aggression is defined so vaguely that it potentially {{could be applied}} to try leaders who seek to stop documented mass atrocities with armed force. This Note seeks a resolution to that overlap: a path that would allow those who would plan and engage in bona fide humanitarian intervention to be exempt from prosecution for aggression. The Note first examines <b>the</b> genealogy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> <b>of</b> aggression. It then analyzes several possible solutions to policing aggression without unduly deterring humanitarian intervention. Finally, this Note concludes that the existing imbalance can be corrected by: (1) granting the International Criminal Court exclusive jurisdiction to investigate and prosecute <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> <b>of</b> aggression, (2) modifying the current regulations to bar the U. N. Security Council in prosecuting <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> <b>of</b> aggression, and (3) developing an affirmative defense to <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> <b>of</b> aggression that would allow indicted leaders to use either a high or low evidentiary standard depending on whether their state acted alone or through a multilateral organization...|$|R
5|$|The libel trial {{became a}} cause célèbre as salacious details of Wilde's private life with Taylor and Douglas {{began to appear}} in the press. A team of private detectives had {{directed}} Queensberry's lawyers, led by Edward Carson QC, {{to the world of the}} Victorian underground. Wilde's association with blackmailers and male prostitutes, cross-dressers and homosexual brothels was recorded, and various persons involved were interviewed, some being coerced to appear as witnesses since they too were accomplices to <b>the</b> <b>crimes</b> <b>of</b> which Wilde was accused.|$|E
5|$|According to the 1993 book by Russian {{psychiatrist}} Mikhail Buyanov, {{the harm}} inflicted by Soviet punitive psychiatry {{on the image}} of domestic medicine is, of course, great, but bears no comparison to <b>the</b> <b>crimes</b> <b>of</b> the Nazi doctors. Now, when all the passions have cooled, one {{can say that the}} zeal of Soviet psychiatrists inflicted suffering on up to 100 or 120 people of all 280 million citizens of the former Soviet Union, Buyanov writes. He adds that among the persons were many fanatical nationalists, religious sectarians, and political paranoiacs who after escaping to freedom corrupted the masses, сrammed their heads with nonsense, carried away immature people with their ideas through the connivance of the so-called progressive intelligentsia, and a result of it is wars, blood, and reciprocal hatred.|$|E
5|$|Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy {{wrote the}} {{majority}} opinion for the Court, which declined to overturn the state court's decision because fair-minded jurists could disagree over whether Alvarado was in custody. Kennedy noted that there were facts for and against the claim that Alvarado was in custody. Facts pointing towards custody included that the interview took place at a police station, the interview lasted for two hours, Alvarado was not told {{he was free to}} leave, and Alvarado's parents were not allowed to be present during the interview. Facts weighing against custody included that Alvarado was not transported to the police station by police, Alvarado was not threatened or told he would be placed under arrest, and the interview focused on <b>the</b> <b>crimes</b> <b>of</b> Alvarado's friend, not Alvarado's crimes. The Court was not tasked with conducting a separate inquiry into the issue of custody, rather, the Court was tasked with granting relief only if the lower court's decision is objectively unreasonable. Kennedy wrote that, given this standard, the state court's decision was reasonable because it was not clearly unreasonable.|$|E
40|$|Food {{safety is}} one of the basic {{requirements}} of livelihood, however, with the development of the socialist market economy, many problems exist in the food safety field. Therefore the governments have enacted a series of policies and regulations to supervise food safety, one <b>of</b> which is <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> <b>of</b> dereliction of duty of food safety, which is put forward to improve and perfect the food safety supervision and management and food security. This paper aims to study <b>the</b> necessity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> <b>of</b> dereliction of duty in food safety and current situation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> <b>of</b> dereliction of duty to provide some feasible ideas of improving the food safety...|$|R

50|$|Deliberately false {{accusations of}} defamation, {{as with any}} other <b>crime,</b> lead to <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> <b>of</b> calumny (Article 368, Penal Code), which, under the Italian legal system, is defined as <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> <b>of</b> falsely accusing, before the authorities, one <b>of</b> a <b>crime</b> it didn't commit.|$|R
5|$|In December 1970 Gomułka {{scored a}} major {{political}} victory when Poland obtained a West German recognition of the post-World War II borders. The German side secured the right to emigrate to West Germany for the residents of Poland of German identity and to help financially those who stayed by granting pensions: hundreds of thousands eventually became affected. German Chancellor Willy Brandt, who signed the agreement, also asked on his knees for forgiveness for <b>the</b> <b>crimes</b> <b>of</b> the Nazis (Warschauer Kniefall). His gesture was understood in Poland as being addressed to all Poles, although it was actually made {{at the site of}} the Warsaw Ghetto and was thus directed primarily toward the Jews. The notable reconciliation process between the Polish and German nations was initiated five years earlier, when the Polish Church issued its famous Letter of Reconciliation of the Polish Bishops to the German Bishops, criticized then by the Polish government.|$|E
5|$|Pre-Trial Chamber II {{ruled that}} there were {{reasonable}} grounds to be believe that William Ruto and Henry Kosgey were criminally responsible as indirect co-perpetrators of the crimes outlined in counts 1, 2 and 4, {{but in the case}} of Joshua Sang it ruled that his involvement was not essential to the commission of the crimes and so only ruled {{that there were}} grounds to believe he otherwise contributed to the crimes. The Chamber rejected the request by the Prosecutor to include the charge of torture in count 3. In the case of Kenyatta, Muthaura and Ali the Chamber ruled that there were reasonable grounds to believe that Uhuru Kenyatta and Francis Muthaura were guilty as indirect co-perpetrators of <b>the</b> <b>crimes</b> <b>of</b> which they were accused {{but in the case of}} Mohammed Ali, the Chamber ruled that his contribution was not essential to the commission of the crimes and so he was charged with having otherwise contributed.|$|E
5|$|The German {{version of}} The Testament of Dr. Mabuse premiered on April 21, 1933, in Budapest, Hungary with a playing time of 124 minutes. The French-language version was {{distributed}} through Europe. A subtitled {{version of the}} French version was released in 1943 with the title The Last Will of Dr. Mabuse in the United States. In 1951, the German version was released in a 75-minute version with the title <b>The</b> <b>Crimes</b> <b>of</b> Dr.Mabuse which featured an English dub. The English subtitles for the 1943 release and the 1952 dub added allusions to Adolf Hitler that {{were not part of}} the original script. The Testament of Dr. Mabuse was first shown publicly in Germany on August 24, 1961 with a 111-minute running time. In 1973, the unedited German version of the film was released in the United States with the title The Testament of Dr. Mabuse with English subtitles.|$|E

40|$|The {{dissertation}} thesis thoroughly examines <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> <b>of</b> {{legalization of}} proceeds <b>of</b> criminal activities (<b>the</b> <b>crime</b> <b>of</b> money laundering) {{as it is}} stipulated in the contemporary Czech Criminal Code. The crux of the thesis is {{an analysis of the}} most significant elements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> <b>of</b> money laundering that are legal objects (general values protected by criminal law), actus reus (physical elements <b>of</b> a <b>crime),</b> mens rea (mental elements <b>of</b> a <b>crime)</b> and offender (person who commits a <b>crime).</b> Within <b>the</b> framework <b>of</b> that analysis, all of the important and disputed questions relating to this crime are examined, e. g. a complex problem of legal objects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> <b>of</b> money laundering or a question of liability for so-called self-money laundering. The detailed analysis of <b>the</b> elements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> <b>of</b> money laundering is based on a research into the most important phenomenological aspects of money laundering (chiefly the grounds for money laundering, origin of money laundering and nature of the process of money laundering, including the means of realization of money laundering) and a research into the historical development of <b>the</b> elements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> <b>of</b> money laundering in the Czech legal order.

5|$|Some recent historians paint a more {{favourable}} {{picture of}} the emperor's rule. For example, Martijn Icks, in Images of Elagabalus (2008; republished as <b>The</b> <b>Crimes</b> <b>of</b> Elagabalus in 2012), doubts {{the reliability of the}} ancient sources and argues that it was the emperor's unorthodox religious policies that alienated the power elite of Rome, to the point that his grandmother saw fit to eliminate him and replace him with his cousin. Leonardo de Arrizabalaga y Prado, in The Emperor Elagabalus: Fact or Fiction? (2008), is also critical of the ancient historians and speculates that neither religion nor sexuality {{played a role in the}} fall of the young emperor. He was simply the loser in a power struggle within the imperial family; the loyalty of the Praetorian Guards was up for sale, and Julia Maesa had the resources to outmaneuver and outbribe her grandson. In this version of events, once Elagabalus, his mother, and his immediate circle had been murdered, a campaign of character assassination began, resulting in a grotesque caricature that has persisted to the present day. Historians have not only kept the tradition alive, but often embellished it, reflecting their own bias against effeminacy, religious zealotry and other traits with which Elagabalus is commonly identified.|$|E
5|$|The Prime Minister {{recognized}} that the modernization of Madagascar and its system of state administration could strengthen the country against invasion by a Western power and directed his energy to this end. In 1877, he outlawed the enslavement of the Makoa community. Rainilaiarivony expanded the public education system, declaring school attendance mandatory in 1881 and forming a cadre of school inspectors the following year to ensure education quality. The island's first pharmacy was established by LMS missionaries in 1862, and the first hospital was inaugurated in Antananarivo three years later, followed by the launching in 1875 of a state medical system staffed by civil servant clinicians. Rainilaiarivony enacted a series of new legal codes {{over the course of}} his administration that sought to create a more humane social order. The number of capital offenses was reduced from eighteen to thirteen, and he put an end to the tradition of collective family punishment for <b>the</b> <b>crimes</b> <b>of</b> one individual. Fines were fixed for specific offenses and corporal punishment was limited to being locked in irons. The structure of legal administration was reorganized so that matters that exceeded the authority of the traditional community courts at the level of the fokonolona village collective, administered by local magistrates and village heads, would be referred to the three high courts established in the capital in 1876, although final judicial authority remained with Rainilaiarivony. The Code of 305 Laws established that same year would form the basis of the legal system applied in Madagascar for the remainder of the 19th century and throughout much of the colonial period. To strengthen rule of law, the Prime Minister introduced a rural police force, modernized the court system and eliminated certain unjust privileges that had disproportionately benefited the noble class.|$|E
