5|$|At {{the same}} time Crimean Tatars devastated Russian territories and burned and looted Moscow during the Russo-Crimean Wars.

Following the defeat of Crimean and Nogai forces in 1572, oprichnina was wound down {{and with it the}} way Russian armies were formed also changed. Ivan IV had introduced a new strategy whereby he relied on tens of thousands of native troops, Cossacks and Tatars instead of a few thousand skilled troops and mercenaries, as was the practice of his adversaries.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the breakup}} of the Soviet Union a few years earlier, <b>the</b> <b>Russian</b> <b>economy</b> had been slowly {{collapsing}} and the budget for space exploration was reduced by around 80%. Before and after Phase One, a great deal of Russia's space finances came from flights of astronauts from Europe and other countries, with one Japanese TV station paying $9.5 million to have one of their reporters, Toyohiro Akiyama, flown aboard Mir. By the start of Phase One, cosmonauts regularly found their missions extended to save money on launchers, the six-yearly flights of the Progress had been reduced to three, and there was a distinct possibility of Mir being sold for around $500 million.|$|E

25|$|Following the {{dissolution}} of the Soviet Union, the traffic volumes along the Northern Sea Route declined drastically in the early 1990s due to the slowdown of <b>the</b> <b>Russian</b> <b>economy.</b> As a result, it was decided to decommission the Moskva-class icebreakers.

This book searches for answers to these questions, by investigating the networking practices of <b>the</b> <b>Russian</b> software industry.

50|$|Russia {{depended}} on imports - both for her domestic economy {{and for the}} supply of her military forces: the blockade forced Russia to rely on more expensive overland shipments from Prussia.

While in 2002, the State Defense Order amounted to only RUB 62billion, by 2007 the sum had risen to RUB 302.7billion. When calculated in constant 2000 prices, this represents an increase by a factor of two.|$|E
25|$|Declining productivity, a high fixed {{exchange}} rate between the ruble and foreign currencies to avoid public turmoil, and a chronic fiscal deficit were the reasons {{that led to the}} crisis.

Dmitry Medvedev, elected as President in 2008, made economic modernisation his prime presidential agenda. Medvedev's statements regarding this issue went much further than other statements by the Russian leadership. In 2009, Medvedev founded the Presidential Commission on Innovation.

25|$|Russia {{had lost}} {{two of its}} three fleets. Only its Black Sea Fleet remained, {{and this was the}} result of an earlier treaty that had {{prevented}} the fleet from leaving the Black Sea. Japan became the sixth-most powerful naval force by combined tonnage, while the Russian Navy declined to one barely stronger than that of Austria–Hungary. The actual costs of the war were large enough to affect <b>the</b> <b>Russian</b> <b>economy</b> and, despite grain exports, the nation developed an external balance of payments deficit. The cost of military re-equipment and re-expansion after 1905 pushed the economy further into deficit, although the size of the deficit was obscured.|$|E

Unemployment is highest among women and young people. Following {{the breakup of the}} Soviet Union and the economic dislocation it engendered, the standard of living fell dramatically. However, since recovering from the 1998 economic crisis, the standard of living has been on the rise. As of 2010 about 13.1% of the population was living below the poverty line, compared to 40% in 1999. The average yearly salary in Russia was $14,302 (about $23,501 PPP) as of October 2013, up from $455 per year in August 1999.|$|E
