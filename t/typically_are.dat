5|$|In {{addition}} to the above named sub-regions, there are also two smaller regions, in Albania and Serbia respectively. These regions are also considered geographically part of Macedonia. They are referred to by ethnic Macedonians as follows, but <b>typically</b> <b>are</b> not so referred to by non-partisan scholars.|$|E
25|$|Pathologically, ganglioneuromas are {{composed}} of ganglion cells, Schwann cells and fibrous tissue. Ganglioneuromas are solid, firm tumours that <b>typically</b> <b>are</b> white when seen with the naked eye.|$|E
50|$|American and British English {{spelling}} {{differences can}} occasionally apply to eponyms. For example, American style would <b>typically</b> <b>be</b> cesarean section, whereas British style would <b>typically</b> <b>be</b> caesarean section (or cæsarean section digraph).|$|R

25|$|UCMP 40186: A elongated, {{slender and}} {{compressed}} laterally tooth, {{with a slight}} curvature, intermediate in size between 44561 and other teeth reported, with larger saws (3 per millimeter tooth; in Langstonia <b>typically</b> <b>are</b> 4 to 6mm).|$|E
25|$|Despite nearly {{dying out}} in the 20th century, water puppetry has been {{recognised}} by the Vietnamese government as {{an important part of}} Vietnam's cultural heritage. Today, puppetry is commonly performed by professional puppeteers, who <b>typically</b> <b>are</b> taught by their elders in rural areas of Vietnam.|$|E
25|$|Teratoma formation: iPSCs {{injected}} into immunodeficient mice spontaneously formed teratomas after nine weeks. Teratomas are tumors of multiple lineages containing tissue {{derived from the}} three germ layers endoderm, mesoderm and ectoderm; this is unlike other tumors, which <b>typically</b> <b>are</b> of only one cell type. Teratoma formation is a landmark test for pluripotency.|$|E

25|$|Metronidazole <b>typically</b> <b>is</b> {{the initial}} {{drug of choice}} for mild to {{moderate}} disease, because of lower price. <b>Typically</b> it <b>is</b> taken {{three times a day}} for 10 days.|$|R
50|$|Treatment <b>typically</b> <b>is</b> {{supportive}} and includes monitoring and observation.|$|R
25|$|Pseudometric spaces <b>typically</b> <b>are</b> not Hausdorff, {{but they}} are preregular, and their use in {{analysis}} is usually only {{in the construction of}} Hausdorff gauge spaces. Indeed, when analysts run across a non-Hausdorff space, it is still probably at least preregular, and then they simply replace it with its Kolmogorov quotient, which is Hausdorff.|$|E
25|$|Several {{surgical}} procedures provide long-term solutions {{for patients who}} suffer from lymphedema. Prior to surgery, patients <b>typically</b> <b>are</b> treated by a physical or occupational therapist, trained in providing lymphedema treatment for initial conservative treatment of their lymphedema. CDT, MLD and compression bandaging are all helpful components of conservative lymphedema treatment.|$|E
25|$|Piecing: Sewing {{small pieces}} of cloth into patterns, called blocks, that are then sewn {{together}} to make a finished quilt top. These blocks may be sewn together, edge to edge, or separated by strips of cloth called sashing. Note: Whole cloth quilts <b>typically</b> <b>are</b> not pieced, but are made using a single piece of cloth for the quilt top.|$|E

25|$|Recreational {{and sport}} {{catamarans}} <b>typically</b> <b>are</b> designed {{to have a}} crew of two and be launched and landed from a beach. Most have a trampoline on the bridging structure, a rotating mast and full-length battens on the mainsail. Performance versions often have trapezes to allow the crew to hike out and counterbalance capsize forces during strong winds on certain points of sail.|$|E
25|$|Young {{aye-ayes}} <b>typically</b> <b>are</b> silver colored {{on their}} front {{and have a}} stripe down their back. However, as the aye-ayes begin to reach maturity, their bodies will be completely covered in thick fur and are typically not one solid color. On the head and back, {{the ends of the}} hair are typically tipped with white {{while the rest of the}} body will ordinarily be a yellow and/or brown color.|$|E
25|$|In the winter, {{the screen}} was removed and {{replaced}} with a storm window, which created a two-layer separation between the interior and exterior spaces, increasing window insulation in cold winter months. To permit ventilation the storm window may be hung from removable hinge loops and swung open using folding metal arms. No screening was usually possible with open storm windows, though in the winter, insects <b>typically</b> <b>are</b> not active.|$|E

5000|$|Many systems used in {{telecommunications}} use an extra-low voltage [...] "common battery" [...] 48 V DC power, {{because it}} has less restrictive safety regulations, such as being installed in conduit and junction boxes. DC has <b>typically</b> <b>been</b> the dominant power source for telecommunications, and AC has <b>typically</b> <b>been</b> the dominant source for computers and servers.|$|R
25|$|Tax evaders <b>typically</b> <b>are</b> either {{involved}} in {{activities in the}} gray sector of economy or in the underground market which they do not divulge. Others are engaged in smuggling and the black market. The loses are equivalent to 20% to 25% of the country’s gross domestic product revenue. In 2014, international medias reported Iranian nationals to be listed among the tax evaders in Switzerland.|$|E
25|$|Northern red-backed voles use surface runways {{through the}} {{vegetation}} as travel corridors. Nests are built in short underground burrows or under some protective object {{such as a}} rock or root. Northern red-backed voles are active all winter and construct long tunnels under the snow. Winter nests <b>typically</b> <b>are</b> placed on the ground among thick moss. Northern red-backed voles frequently invade houses during the winter.|$|E
25|$|Eicosanoids <b>typically</b> <b>are</b> {{not stored}} within cells but rather {{synthesized}} as required. They {{derive from the}} fatty acids {{that make up the}} cell membrane and nuclear membrane. These fatty acids must be released from their membrane sites and then metabolized initially to products which most often are further metabolized through various pathways to make the large array of products we recognize as bioactive eicosanoids.|$|E

25|$|Using ReadyBoost-capable {{flash memory}} (NAND memory devices) for caching allows Windows Vista {{and later to}} service random disk reads with better {{performance}} than without the cache. This caching applies to all disk content, not just the page file or system DLLs. Flash devices <b>typically</b> <b>are</b> slower than a mechanical hard disk for sequential I/O, so, to maximize performance, ReadyBoost includes logic that recognizes large, sequential read requests and has the hard disk service these requests.|$|E
25|$|The University {{has five}} {{conventional}} residence halls. A {{record number of}} applicants is now requiring Student Life and the Department of University Housing to contract with nearby apartment complexes and hotels. The housing shortage creates student wait lists and financial aid complications. Private rooms <b>typically</b> <b>are</b> not available even if a student {{is willing to pay}} significantly higher rates. Students seeking exemption from the living on campus requirement have to fill out and return paperwork.|$|E
25|$|The {{rate of unionization}} {{for these}} workers is about 36 percent, {{much higher than the}} average for all occupations. Consequently, {{merchant}} marine officers and seamen, both veterans and beginners, are hired for voyages through union hiring halls or directly by shipping companies. Hiring halls rank the candidates by the length of time the person has been out of work and fill open slots accordingly. Hiring halls <b>typically</b> <b>are</b> found in major seaports.|$|E
