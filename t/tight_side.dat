A siding {{to the outside of}} the loop requires a larger baseboard.

Allowing the loop to be a little larger, so as to permit a <b>tighter</b> <b>siding</b> curve within it, means a larger loop and baseboard. This can be done most compactly by stretching the circular loop to an oval, but keeping the same radius with an added straight; the point comes off the straight portion.

Ten-millimeter-thick veneer of white seraya were cut with five rolling types of the roller bars, and the horzontal (Fh(k)) and vertical (Fv(k)) components of the cutting force (R(K)) were measured.

However, {{little research has been}} conducted on the effects of deep stripping massage strokes (DSMS) alone, or combined with eccentric resistance, on hamstring length and strength. Purpose. To determine: 1) if DSMS have an effect on hamstring length and strength and 2) if the effects on hamstring length and strength are any different when DSMS are combined with eccentric exercise. Methods. 89 Community College students and community members between the ages of 18 and 62 volunteered for the study. Of these, 64 demonstrated tight hamstrings on either one or both sides as defined by supine, passive terminal knee extension of ≤ 75 ° and participated in the study. Strength was assessed by pressing the posterior calcaneus into a strain gauge for approximately 5 s while seated with the knee flexed to 90 °. On their <b>tighter</b> <b>side,</b> participants were administered longitudinal DSMS during 15, 10 -s bouts of eccentric resistance with an elastic resistance band. On their other hamstring, participants were administered 15, 10 -s longitudinal DSMS while lying passive. All massage strokes were performed at a depth of 7 out of 10 on a verbal pressure scale index. Afterwards, the hamstring flexibility and strength tests were repeated. Results. Both DSMS with eccentric resistance (10. 7 %) and DSMS alone (6. 3 %) resulted in improved (p < 0. 01) hamstring flexibility. The improvement following DSMS with eccentric resistance was greater (p < 0. 05) than following DSMS alone. Strength was not significantly affected by either treatment. Conclusions. These results suggest that DSMS increases hamstring length in less than 3 min but has no affect on strength. Furthermore, combining DSMS with eccentric resistance produces more hamstring flexibility gains than DSMS alone and does not affect strength. Peer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Line drop compensation, {{high side}} voltage control, {{secondary}} voltage control — why not control {{a generator like}} a static var compensator? Abstract: Generators typically regulate terminal voltage via automatic voltage regulator and exciter equipment. The desired high side (transmission side) voltage schedule is usually maintained by the power plant operator or by slow SCADA-type process control computers. Power system dynamic performance, however, can be improved by faster regulation of the transmission voltage. Contrasted to generators, static var compensators are designed specifically for transmission voltage regulation. The transmission voltage is directly regulated at high speed. Total SVC and medium voltage component reactive power ratings are referred to the transmission side. All medium voltage equipment are designed to support the transmission side reactive power and voltage regulation requirements. The droop (slope) setting is usually small compared to generators regulating terminal voltage. This paper introduces the panel session on secondary voltage control.

We show for certain families of these associahedra: (a) how to compute tight values z_I for the redundant inequalities from the values z_I for the facet-defining inequalities; (b) the computation of the values y_I of Ardila, Benedetti & Doker can be significantly simplified and at most four values z_a(I), z_b(I), z_c(I) and z_d(I) are needed to compute y_I; (c) the four indices a(I), b(I), c(I) and d(I) are determined by the geometry of the normal fan of the associahedron and are described combinatorially; (d) a combinatorial interpretation of the values y_I using a labeled n-gon.

40|$|Graduation date: 1998 A {{changing}} {{raw material}} supply and smaller, generally lower quality peeler logs, are causing surface characteristics in veneer that can adversely affect glue-bond performance. When lower quality logs are peeled, rougher veneer is usually produced. The typical response by plywood manufacturers {{is to increase}} adhesive spread when using rough veneer. The effectiveness of increasing adhesive spread rates has not been quantified. To do so, a method to quantify roughness is needed {{so that it can}} be correlated with percent wood failure, the standard for defining glue-bond quality. The objectives of this research were to define the relationships between seven traditional 2 - dimensional measures of surface roughness and glue-bond performance in order to determine if a measure or combination of measures could be used to develop a glue-bond performance prediction model. Rotary peeled, 1 / 8 inch thick Douglas-fir veneer was visually categorized as being smooth, intermediate, or rough. Samples on each sheet were selected at random and their locations tracked throughout the study. The surface roughness of each sample was measured on the <b>tight</b> and loose <b>sides</b> using a modified laser scatter/optical imaging system. The scanning data were used to calculate seven roughness measures. Three-ply plywood panels were manufactured using the measured samples as core material and smooth veneer as face and back plys. Each panel was cut into standard shear specimens according to U. S. Product Standard 1 - 95. The test area for each shear specimen was the measured sample selected prior to panel assembly. The shear specimens were tested and evaluated for load at failure and percent wood failure. Each of the roughness measures and visual categories were compared to load at failure and percent wood failure data. Each shear specimen was also examined to determine the nature of the failure and with the failure being categorized into one of seven types. Analysis of variance and multiple linear regression tests indicated no statistically significant relationship between any of the seven roughness measures or combination of measures and load at failure or percent wood failure. There was also no significant difference in roughness between the <b>tight</b> and loose <b>side</b> of the veneer, except for the skewness, kurtosis, and 3 rd highest peak measures. Analysis of the visual categories showed there was strong evidence that an increase in surface roughness was associated with a decrease in load at failure and percent wood failure. This indicates that a 3 - dimensional measure of surface roughness may be more effective for modeling glue-bond performance. Analysis of the nature of failure data indicated that the samples tended to fail on the loose side of the veneer. This trend was noted across all roughness categories. It is believed that this may be associated with lathe check depth and that an interaction between lathe check depth and veneer roughness may determine glue-bond performance...|$|R

Most short turns {{can be classified}} readily into a limited repertoire of discrete backbone conformations, but the physical–chemical determinants of these distinct conformational basins remain an open question. We investigated this question by exhaustive analysis of all backbone conformations accessible to short chain segments bracketed by either an α-helix or a β-strand (i. e., α-segment-α, β-segment-β, α-segment-β, and β-segment-α) in a nine-state model. We find {{that each of these}} four secondary structure environments imposes its own unique steric and hydrogen-bonding constraints on the intervening segment, resulting in a limited repertoire of conformations. In greater detail, an exhaustive set of conformations was generated for short backbone segments having reverse-turn chain topology and bracketed between elements of secondary structure. This set was filtered, and only clash-free, hydrogen-bond–satisfied conformers having reverse-turn topology were retained. The filtered set includes authentic turn conformations, observed in proteins of known structure, but little else. In particular, over 99 % of the alternative conformations failed to satisfy at least one criterion and were excluded from the filtered set. Furthermore, almost all of the remaining alternative conformations have close tolerances that would be too <b>tight</b> to accommodate <b>side</b> chains longer than a single β-carbon.
