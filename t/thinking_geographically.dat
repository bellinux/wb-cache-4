40|$|ABSTRACT Based on {{a recent}} {{presentation}} at the GA Annual Conference (Manchester 2006), this article presents an argument for the power of <b>thinking</b> <b>geographically,</b> emphasising the discipline's grammar (its concepts and theories) {{as well as its}} vocabulary (a virtually endless list of place-names), The article makes a case for four key concepts: space and place, scale and connection, proximity and distance, and relational thinking. These ideas are then put to work in addressing some of the ethical complexities facing contemporary consumers, including the charitable demands of 'caring at a distance'. The article concludes that <b>thinking</b> <b>geographically</b> offers a uniquely powerful way of seeing the world and making connections between scales, from the global to the local...|$|E
40|$|Globalization and the {{virtualization}} {{of business}} has highlighted {{the challenges of}} managing a dispersed team and have encouraged further research into the benefits of face-to-face communications and how that might be simulated in a virtual world. It is anticipated that high profile research and development projects, such as Oculus Rift, and High Fidelity, could see a revived interest in virtual reality and virtual worlds and how these could augment design thinking for online collaboration. The research project was informed by {{a review of the}} literature with relevance to design thinking, the virtual, co-design, human centered design, and tacit knowledge sharing. This research project examined how virtual teams could use prototype tools and modes of design <b>thinking</b> by <b>geographically</b> dispersed groups within a shared virtual space. More specifically, it examined how teams of creative technologies students both apply and learn design thinking, by creating and using collaborative tools, designed in a virtual world, to be used in a virtual learning environment. The undergraduate students studying a design major in business will be asked to engage in a transdisciplinary dialogue with students from another school of creative technologies using the context of a virtual world. The research follows a constructivist approach to teaching the business students design collaboration to review the benefits of face-to-face collaboration, and how that might be simulated online in a virtual world using those tools and methods. The study demonstrates innovation in a number of ways through virtual collaboration between diverse students of business and creative technologies using design thinking methods and methodology. The paper will also present how business students understand design thinking and illustrate the barriers to innovation in a virtual simulation through iterative prototyping virtual tools that encourage co-design and human centered design. The paper concludes with some findings from the data collected during the research project, with some early commentary and discussion of those findings...|$|R
40|$|In {{his brief}} public career, Piero Gobetti {{was one of}} the most outspoken and {{original}} voices of early Italian antifascism. Before his sudden death in 1926, he founded and edited three periodicals, including the fiercely antifascist La Rivoluzione Liberale and the literary journal Il Baretti. While much has been written about his antifascism and his theories of ‘liberal revolution’, this book considers him primarily as an ‘organiser of culture’ and situates him both in the context of his lived experience in Turin after the First World War and in a wider European panorama. Although politically marginal by 1918, Turin was one of Italy’s most modern cities, with its futuristic Fiat factories, vocal working class and militant socialist intellectuals such as Antonio Gramsci. The book explores Gobetti’s encounters with Turin – both its history and the modern, urban landscape of Gobetti’s own day – as central to his <b>thinking.</b> Historically and <b>geographically,</b> Turin was also the Italian city closest to France and northern Europe. If Gobetti’s immediate surroundings inspired much of his thinking, his sensibilities were – in true Piedmontese style – more European than Italian, and his ultimate impact far from only local. Finally, Gobetti’s bitter disillusionment with liberal and fascist Italy, as well as his refusal to fit any of the conventional political labels, means that his memory has remained contentious right up to the present day. This groundbreaking new study explores the roots of Gobetti’s thinking, his impact on Italian culture and his controversial legacy...|$|R
40|$|Thinking Through Geography (TTG) {{strategies}} are popular in secondary education. Geography teachers see these strategies to be powerful to stimulate <b>thinking</b> <b>geographically.</b> However, empirical evidence is scarce. Based on a quasi-experimental design, effects of mysteries, {{one of the}} more famous TTG strategies, were examined on students geographical thinking in terms of their skills to relate phenomena. A multilevel regression analysis showed that students who used mysteries in geography lessons reported significantly more correct geographical relationships than students who attended the regular curriculum. We conclude that a mystery can be an effective TTG strategy for the development of students geographical thinking skills. Improvements of the pedagogy of using mysteries in Geography lessons are discussed. © 2013 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC...|$|E
40|$|This chapter {{highlights}} {{the significance of}} <b>thinking</b> <b>geographically</b> about mental health and aims to demonstrate what a geographically informed analysis of mental health can offer to future debates within global mental health. Beginning with an overview of mental health geography, the chapter focuses upon four interconnecting strands of the subfield, that of ‘spatial epidemiologies’ and the ‘psychiatric city’, provision and the complex spaces of care, and therapeutic landscapes, to highlight the significance of a geographical approach. A range of examples from the work in mental health geography and beyond are presented to illustrate the different geographical components revealed by these studies. Finally, future challenges in and agendas for further critical exploration into global mental health from this perspective are suggested, particularly {{with reference to the}} lack of attention currently given to those sites, spaces and voices in the Global South...|$|E
40|$|Anglophone {{research}} in economic geography {{can be characterized}} by two separate, contested paradigms: Geographical economics (building {{on the work of}} the economists Krugman, Venables and Fujita), and geographical political economy (prevalent within geography). Elaborating on the latter, this paper explores what it means to think geographically about the (capitalist) economy. Focusing on geographies of commodity production as the driving force (even as markets are important emergent features in their own right), <b>thinking</b> <b>geographically</b> about the economy challenges many of the core claims of geographical economists. Beyond this, it raises deep questions about the capacity of globalizing capitalism, however it is governed, to overcome social and geographical inequality. Key words: Geographical political economy, spatio-temporality, capitalism, geographical thought, nature-society I have been thinking and writing about geography and the economy for my entire career, seeking to understand what it means to take seriously the ge-ography of capitalism.

40|$|In <b>Thinking</b> <b>Geographically</b> (Hubbard et al. 2002), a student-centred {{guide to}} the {{theoretical}} landscape of human geography, we began by noting the different ways of writing geography’s histories. One way, we suggested, was to present the disciplinary landscape as a battlefield populated by warring factions, each led by totemic figureheads who fire intellectual potshots at {{one another in the}} attempt to overwhelm other forms of geographical thinking. While alliances may be drawn, and truces occasionally brokered, the overwhelming picture is one of intellectual spats, simmering resentments and outright hostility between those situated in different ‘camps’. In short, if we follow this metaphor through, we reach the conclusion that geography is a discipline riven by division, with the clash of personalities and intellectual positions manifest in constant battles. Even when the war is seemingly won, and a particular way of thinking becomes dominant, civil wars break out, and the cycle of violence begins again...|$|E
40|$|Souvenirs {{have been}} largely ignored in {{geographic}} work on tourism. This paper adds {{to the body of}} literature concerned with ?tourism geographies? by considering the partial lives of one type of souvenir; those labelled ?banal?. This paper explores the negotiations that arise when such souvenirs (material objects from the exotic, extraordinary, temporary place of tourism) are implanted in the usual, ordinary place of ?home?. It is argued the ?placement? of souvenirs in the home stems from the ?place? the souvenir holds for owners, via their enmeshment in social relationships, processes of fetishization and questions of authenticity. This paper asserts that ?banal? souvenirs (tea towels, bookmarks, food and drink) however ?ordinary? in appearance, and alike to items usually found at home, are just as likely to be placed in significant ways as supposedly authentic, hand-crafted souvenir goods. This paper thus argues that souvenirs offer a novel frame for <b>thinking</b> <b>geographically</b> about tourism. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|This paper investigates {{sweat to}} deepen {{theoretical}} understandings of how gender is lived. To do so we adopt a visceral approach that opens possibilities of <b>thinking</b> <b>geographically</b> about the affective ties and emotional bonds of sweat {{to engage with}} feminist logics of embodiment. Our interest is in what sweaty bodies can 2 ̆ 7 do 2 ̆ 7. Attention {{is given to the}} way that affects, emotions and sensations associated with being sweaty, smelling sweat, as well as touching one 2 ̆ 7 s own sweat, and that of others, provides insights into the gendered lives of people as they move through different context. Our analysis of how gendered is lived through sweaty bodies draws on 2 ̆ 7 Summer Living 2 ̆ 7 narratives of 17 participants who understand themselves as men and live in Wollongong, a city of around 280, 000 people on the east coast of New South Wales, Australia. We illustrate the theoretical significance of thinking about sweat for gender and geography by discussing the ambiguity, proximity and collectivity of sweaty bodies; and, the fragility, multiplicity and vitality of sweaty bodies. To conclude we outline how a visceral approach provides possibilities to improve household sustainability policies...|$|E
40|$|This paper delves {{into the}} world of medical and Army {{psychiatric}} practice in Britain during the 1950 s, in order to reveal the importance of <b>thinking</b> <b>geographically</b> about the life and work of Scottish psychiatrist and psychotherapist Ronald David Laing (1927 – 1989). The paper first discusses the previous biographical literature produced on Laing and his own autobiography, arguing that by viewing Laing’s life and work through a geographical lens certain underexplored spaces, sites and places emerge. The following sections will detail Laing’s time spent as an intern in the West of Scotland Neurological Unit at Killearn, where he first endured the harsh working realities of medical practice and where critical debates in 1950 s mental health care were playing out in a microcosm. These included the controversial treatment of lobotomy and the brewing tensions between neurology and psychiatry. As Laing’s career took a military turn and he was posted to work within the insulin coma unit of the Royal Victoria Military Hospital in Netley, it is possible to highlight the development of Laing’s thoughts on the treatment of psychiatric patients {{in the hands of the}} Army, and how he attempted to come to terms with these practices in his own unique way. Using the experimental practice of insulin coma therapy as an example, this paper seeks to demonstrate how the space of treatment itself was active in shaping Laing’s future engagements with his psychiatric patients...|$|E
40|$|In {{our current}} age of globalization, {{multiculturalism}} {{is a key}} component of human relations. Place, when thought of as a geographic concept is more than just coordinates on a map, it is a concentration of a set of social relations. Geographers use this information to see how places are relational to other places. Morrison and Allende are relational because of their consciousness of place especially exhibited in Song of Solomon and Eva Luna. This project examines the disparate histories, politics, and landscapes that both authors emerged from, and argue the complexity of their work stems from <b>thinking</b> <b>geographically,</b> their conscious attempt to imagine their links with the wider world, rather than boxing themselves into genre, or taking a subservient position beside a great canonical “father”. A common pitfall for scholars of the United States is to assume categories of difference or categories of dominance are universal across borders. This is demonstrated in scholarship that aims to compare writers from the United States and writers from Latin America based on the notion that they are marginalized. Scholarship that assumes “marginalization” is the same in North and South America is aiding in another construction of the “other”, by universalizing what Mohanty calls, “the third world difference. ” Thinking of the components of a text within a constellation encourages analysis of the relationship between categories of both individual and place identities in their discursive setting. In their imagination of the inter-subjectivity between categories, Allende and Morrison portray power and weakness from all angles. Looking at literature geographically forces us to remove hierarchies and instead draws our attention to the subject’s struggle against their material conditions...|$|E
40|$|This article {{asks what}} we can know of {{historical}} individuals in pre-Reformation England. While recognizing the challenges of writing medieval biography, it points to the opportunities offered by a range of under-utilized sources for engaging both with medieval individuals and the pre-modern world more generally. Using the records of numerous property disputes and related cases litigated at the Westminster equity courts, it examines the actions and attitudes of one individual: Sir Robert Constable of Flamborough (c. 1478 – 1537), a Yorkshire landowner who was frequently brought before the courts for his involvement in local property disputes and ultimately implicated in the Pilgrimage of Grace. It explores Constable's activities through the multiple and often contradictory versions of events presented to the king, his advisors and the law courts, assessing his motivations and character while also recognizing that the fragmentary {{nature of the evidence}} means that Constable will always be an uncertain subject. In focussing on Constable and his connections to the lives and landscapes around him, the article also highlights much about the experiences and agency of the medieval men and women who shared his world. It considers the local personalities and community politics surrounding episodes of enclosure, building on recent work by social historians, archaeologists and historical geographers in order {{to draw attention to the}} roles played by ordinary and not-so-ordinary individuals in shaping the landscape. The paper not only underlines the importance of <b>thinking</b> <b>geographically</b> about the pre-modern world, but also goes some way towards ‘peopling’ the medieval countryside, conceptualizing it as a landscape brought into being through the attitudes and actions of those living and working within it...|$|E
