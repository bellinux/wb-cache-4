Given a bounded set of an arbitrary size in a certain Sobolev space, one can choose the parameter of the CWF {{in such a way}} that the constructed cost functional will be strongly convex on <b>that</b> <b>set.</b> Next, convergence of the gradient method, which starts from an arbitrary point of <b>that</b> <b>set,</b> is established.

They asserted that non-health related MDGs were often well measured, and that not all MDGs were made moot by lack of data.|$|E
25|$|During {{this initial}} stage, when methane is {{relatively}} abundant, dense mussel beds also form near the cold seep. Mostly composed of {{species in the}} genus Bathymodiolus, these mussels do not directly consume food. Instead, they are nourished by symbiotic bacteria that also produce energy from methane, similar to their relatives that form mats. Chemosynthetic bivalves are prominent constituents of the fauna of cold seeps and are represented in <b>that</b> <b>setting</b> by five families: Solemyidae, Lucinidae, Vesicomyidae, Thyasiridae and Mytilidae.|$|E

25|$|According to Valenzuela, the {{printing}} process was so laborious <b>that</b> <b>setting</b> just eight pages of typesets required {{two months to}} complete. For weeks, Jacinto, Duque and Fernández (and sometimes Valenzuela) took turns in preparing {{the pages of the}} Kalayaan, which was approximately nine by twelve inches in size. In March 1896, the first copies were issued (dated January 1896), and about 2,000 prints were circulated in secret, according to Valenzuela. According to Epifanio de los Santos, only 1,000 copies were printed: 700 was distributed by Bonifacio, 300 by Aguinaldo, and some 100 by Valenzuela himself.|$|E
25|$|Flash floods are {{the most}} common flood type in normally-dry {{channels}} in arid zones, known as arroyos in the southwest United States and many other names elsewhere. In <b>that</b> <b>setting,</b> the first flood water to arrive is depleted as it wets the sandy stream bed. The leading edge of the flood thus advances more slowly than later and higher flows. As a result, the rising limb of the hydrograph becomes ever quicker as the flood moves downstream, until the flow rate is so great that the depletion by wetting soil becomes insignificant.|$|E
25|$|His {{foundational}} work on {{algebraic geometry}} is {{at a higher}} level of abstraction than all prior versions. He adapted the use of non-closed generic points, which led to the theory of schemes. He also pioneered the systematic use of nilpotents. As 'functions' these can take only the value 0, but they carry infinitesimal information, in purely algebraic settings. His theory of schemes has become established as the best universal foundation for this field, because of its expressiveness as well as technical depth. In <b>that</b> <b>setting</b> one can use birational geometry, techniques from number theory, Galois theory and commutative algebra, and close analogues of the methods of algebraic topology, all in an integrated way.|$|E

25|$|The {{contraindications}} for mastopexy are few: aspirin use, tobacco smoking, diabetes, {{and obesity}} are medical and health conditions {{associated with increased}} incidences of nipple necrosis. In resolving the perceived ptosis {{of a woman with}} encapsulated breast implants, the surgeon determines her suitability for a breast lift procedure after explantation, which facilitates assessment of the true degree of ptosis present in the explanted breasts; likewise the assessment of the effects of a combined breast-lift and revision-augmentation procedure, featuring the removal and the replacement of breast implants. For the woman who is at high risk for developing breast cancer (primary or recurrent), the mastopexy might alter the histologic architecture of the breasts, which tissue change might interfere with the accurate MRI detection and subsequent treatment of cancer; the risks and benefits will be discussed in <b>that</b> <b>setting.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 2009, an {{anonymity}} {{order was}} {{issued by the}} High Court of Justice during McGreavy's parole board proceedings. The order was resisted by the British press and the Press Association, supported by the Secretary of State for Justice, who argued <b>that</b> <b>setting</b> such a precedent would prevent coverage of dangerous criminals. The order was lifted on May 21, 2013 by Lord Justice Pitchford of the Court of Appeal of England and Wales and Mr Justice Simon of the High Court of Justice, based {{on the importance of}} the public interest in possible release of a dangerous criminal and lack of imminent danger to McGreavy. The lifting of the anonymity order brought a fresh round of publicity to the 40-year-old case.|$|E
25|$|In <b>that</b> <b>setting,</b> he says, {{providers}} {{almost always}} charged minimal fees for services {{in order to}} improve the chance of being paid. He argues that the emergence of government as a payer for healthcare services in the form of Medicare and Medicaid, along with government policies of the 1970s that led to the expansion of private insurance to cover routine medical services in addition to hospitalization and emergency care, and which required most employers to provide health insurance for their employees, interfered with the traditional physician-patient relationship. The incentive for healthcare providers and patients to keep costs as low as possible was lost. He says that now providers always charge the maximal fees for services, since the government or insurance company can be counted on to pay the bills.|$|E

25|$|Thus Tillich dismisses a literalistic Biblicism. Instead of {{rejecting the}} notion of {{personal}} God, however, Tillich {{sees it as a}} symbol that points directly to the Ground of Being. Since the Ground of Being ontologically precedes reason, it cannot be comprehended since comprehension presupposes the subject–object dichotomy. Tillich disagreed with any literal philosophical and religious statements that can be made about God. Such literal statements attempt to define God and lead not only to anthropomorphism but also to a philosophical mistake that Immanuel Kant warned against, <b>that</b> <b>setting</b> limits against the transcendent inevitably leads to contradictions. Any statements about God are simply symbolic, but these symbols are sacred {{in the sense that they}} function to participate or point to the Ground of Being. Tillich insists that anyone who participates in these symbols is empowered by the Power of Being, which overcomes and conquers nonbeing and meaninglessness.|$|E
25|$|Suda was {{disappointed}} {{with the quality of}} Travis' wrestling techniques, and performed some of them on the animators to demonstrate. Certain other details of Travis are based on Suda, including the sound of a key ring jingling in his pocket and his love of cats. A Ubisoft contest was held to allow one winner's design to be used in Desperate Struggle for one of Travis' T-shirts. In an interview with Nintendo Power, Suda stated that he wanted Travis to become a huge star, stating that {{this was one of the}} reasons he wanted to make Desperate Struggle as interesting as possible. Nintendo Power editors told Joystiq that Suda considers Travis his favorite character. Suda states that No More Heroes 2 will be Travis' last appearance in the series, as his story will be completely finished. The Californian setting of No More Heroes is partially based on Travis, who Suda stated had a variety of frustrations and emotions that helped him fit in with <b>that</b> <b>setting.</b>|$|E
25|$|During {{the first}} years of his reign, PeterI faced revolts by two of his three brothers, John in 928 and Michael in 930, but both were quelled. During most of his {{subsequent}} rule until 965, PeterI presided over a Golden Age of the Bulgarian state in a period of political consolidation, economic expansion and cultural activity. A treatise of the contemporary Bulgarian priest and writer Cosmas the Priest describes a wealthy, book-owning and monastery-building Bulgarian elite, and the preserved material evidence from Preslav, Kostur and other locations suggests a wealthy and settled picture of 10th-century Bulgaria. The influence of the landed nobility and the higher clergy increased significantly {{at the expense of the}} personal privileges of the peasantry, causing friction in the society. Cosmas the Priest accused the Bulgarian abbots and bishops of greed, gluttony and neglect towards their flock. In <b>that</b> <b>setting</b> during the reign of PeterI arose Bogomilisma dualistic heretic sect that in the subsequent decades and centuries spread to the Byzantine Empire, northern Italy and southern France (cf. Cathars). The strategic position of the Bulgarian Empire remained difficult. The country was ringed by aggressive neighboursthe Magyars to the north-west, the Pechenegs and the growing power of Kievan Rus' to the north-east, and the Byzantine Empire to the south, which despite the peace proved to be an unreliable neighbour.|$|E

25|$|Nasser's {{first choice}} for buying weapons was the United States, but his {{frequent}} anti-Israeli speeches and his sponsorship for the fedayeen who were making raids into Israel {{had made it}} difficult for the Eisenhower administration to get the approval of Congress to sell weapons to Egypt. American public opinion was deeply hostile towards selling arms to Egypt that might be used against Israel, and moreover Eisenhower feared starting a Middle Eastern arms race. Eisenhower very much valued the Tripartite Declaration as a way of keeping peace in the Near East. In 1950, in order to limit the extent that the Arabs and the Israelis could engage in an arms race, the three nations which dominated the arms trade in the non-Communist world, namely the United States, the United Kingdom and France had signed the Tripartite Declaration, where they had committed themselves to limiting how much arms they could sell in the Near East, and also to ensuring that any arms sales to one side was matched by arms sales of equal quantity and quality to the other. Eisenhower viewed the Tripartite Declaration, which sharply restricted how many arms Egypt could buy in the West, as one of the key elements in keeping the peace between Israel and the Arabs, and believed <b>that</b> <b>setting</b> off an arms race would inevitably lead to a new war.|$|E
