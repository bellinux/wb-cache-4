5|$|The calf nurses {{for three}} years, {{although}} lactation usually lasts longer, allowing for extensive mother-calf bonds. Short-finned pilot whale females will go though menopause, {{but this is}} not as common in females of long-finned pilot whales. Postreproductive females possibly play important roles in the survival of the young. Postreproductive females will continue to lactate and nurse young. Since <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>no</b> longer bear young of their own, these females invest in the current young. Short-finned pilot whales grow more slowly than long-finned pilot whales. For the short-finned pilot whale, females become sexually mature at 9 years old and males at about 13–16 years. For the long-finned pilot whale, females reach maturity at around eight years and males at around 12 years.|$|E

The Shogun writes an unequal contract with aliens which allows the aliens to enter the country and places a ban on carrying swords in public.

5|$|Fatboy first {{appears in}} EastEnders at Lucy Beale's (Melissa Suffield) party, where he gets {{pleasure}} from watching {{a fight between}} two girls, and asks other girls to play Twister with him but nobody will. In EastEnders: E20, he helps his friend Mercy Olubunmi (Bunmi Mojekwu) with a project to encourage more young people to the church, but his ideas leave them both humiliated. They meet Leon Small (Sam Attwater) and ZsaZsa Carter (Emer Kenny) and start squatting in a flat. Fatboy tells ZsaZsa and Leon both his parents {{were killed in a}} drive-by shooting. He finds out Mercy is pregnant and accuses Leon of being the father. During an argument, Mercy reveals that Fatboy's parents are alive, angering ZsaZsa, who throws Fatboy's laptop out of the window. On their last night in the flat, he arranges a party but leaves before the police arrive. Knowing <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>no</b> longer stay there, he invites ZsaZsa, Mercy and Leon to stay at his house in Wanstead, but Mercy decides to go home to her grandmother.|$|E
5|$|When {{a warrior}} is so old, or sustains an injury that means <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>no</b> longer serve their Clan, they retire to become elders. Elders live out the {{remainder}} of their life in general peace, {{using it as a}} time of rest and relaxation. They sleep in their own separate den, which is looked after by the apprentices. Elders are not expected to hunt or fight for their Clan, but are able to do so if the mood takes them. Their only expected duty is to carry the body of a deceased Clanmate to their grave. Every cat of the Clan respects and appreciates the elders, thanking them for the time they have spent upholding their roles as a warrior. Sadly, it is rare for a Clan to have more than three or four elders, as many warriors die before they can retire.|$|E

25|$|Bourgois, {{writing about}} life in East Harlem, New York, United States, {{described}} how young men felt pressured by models of successful masculinity and family structure passed down from their parents' and grandparents' generations, together with modern-day ideals of manhood that also place an emphasis on material consumption. Trapped in their slums, {{with little or no}} available employment, they are unlikely to attain either of these models or expectations of masculine success. In these circumstances, ideals of masculinity are reshaped to emphasize misogyny, substance abuse and participation in crime and often also xenophobia and racism.

25|$|Faced {{with this}} evidence, the Diktatorat retires to {{consider}} its verdict, and realises that {{in deference to}} world opinion <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>no</b> longer convict and execute Dredd with any credibility. Instead they plan to acquit Dredd, and arrange for a man whose family died in the war to shoot Dredd in a feigned fit of rage at the verdict. Discovering this plot, Orlok is outraged at the proposed deception, believing that Dredd should be convicted or released, without regard for the Diktatorat's public image. Orlok is further disillusioned with his masters when they confess that the ten billion credit reward on Dredd's head was secretly funded by Nero Narcos, to eliminate Dredd before Operation Doomsday began. Tired of Orlok's protests, the Diktatorat dismiss him from their service, whereupon Orlok assassinates most of them and rescues Dredd from his cell.|$|E
25|$|VEP {{testing of}} acuity is {{somewhat}} similar to preferential looking in using {{a series of}} black and white stripes (sine wave gratings) or checkerboard patterns (which produce larger responses than stripes). Behavioral responses are not required and brain waves created by the presentation of the patterns are recorded instead. The patterns become finer and finer until the evoked brain wave just disappears, which is considered to be the endpoint measure of visual acuity. In adults and older, verbal children capable of paying attention and following instructions, the endpoint provided by the VEP corresponds very well to the psychophysical measure in the standard measurement (i.e. the perceptual endpoint determined by asking the subject when <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>no</b> longer see the pattern). There is an assumption that this correspondence also applies to much younger children and infants, though this does not necessarily have to be the case. Studies do show the evoked brain waves, as well as derived acuities, are very adult-like by one year of age.|$|E

25|$|The dam poses an impassable {{barrier to}} {{migrating}} salmonids which {{is significant because}} the San Francisquito Creek watershed hosts the most viable remaining native steelhead trout (coastal rainbow trout) (Oncorhynchus mykiss irideus) population in the South San Francisco Bay. Although anadromous or seagoing steelhead trout still spawn below Searsville Dam, <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>no</b> longer run above Searsville Dam to spawn. Corte Madera Creek was described as an historic steelhead trout spawning stream by Skinner in 1962. However stream resident coastal rainbow trout, run up from Searsville Reservoir to spawn in upper Corte Madera Creek and its tributaries, enabling this native fish to survive above the dam as well. A May 2002 steelhead trout migration study reported Searsville Dam as the only complete barrier to migration on mainstem San Francisquito Creek (construction of a fishway in 1976 resolved passage at the Lake Lagunita diversion dam 2.5 miles below Searsville Dam), and that elimination of the Searsville dam could restore ten miles of anadromous steelhead habitat.|$|E
25|$|Since 1979, it {{has been}} {{prohibited}} for federal funds to cover abortion costs for Peace Corps volunteers. Even in instances of life endangerment, rape and incest, volunteers are not financially covered. 433 Peace Corps volunteers were interviewed and {{it was reported that}} many thought the funding ban on abortion coverage should be removed. This was a two-month interview with no eligibility restrictions. Abortion is such a controversial topic that this just made it much more difficult for the Peace Corps to handle. Volunteers do receive health care, including prescription medications, routine examinations, and emergency care, free of charge. These services are provided in-country through a Peace Corps Medical Officer. Peace Corps volunteers don't make much money, which adds to this issue in the news. The abortion topic is very active in the Peace Corps, because when volunteers become pregnant for any reason, <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>no</b> longer be volunteers, and a significant number of them want to remain volunteers.

25|$|For Congolese, mining is {{the easiest}} source of income, because the work is consistent, albeit for only 1 dollar per day. It is laborious, as miners walk for days in the forest to the ore, scratch it with hand tools and pan it. About 90% of young men in Congo do this. Research {{revealed}} that many Congolese leave farming because they need money quickly and cannot wait for crops to grow. Farming also presents obstacles. For example, a lack of roads makes it extremely difficult to transport produce to markets, and the harvest can be taken by militias or the Congolese army. Once their food is taken away or <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>no</b> longer grow food, people resort to mining to sustain themselves. Organized mines are usually run by corrupt groups like militias. Congolese have few tools to mine coltan, and no safety procedures or experience in mining. There is no government aid or intervention in many unethical and abusive circumstances. Miners consider coltan mining a way to provide for themselves {{in the face of}} widespread war and conflict and a government that has no concern for their welfare.|$|E
