5|$|There {{were also}} many {{different}} proposals involving {{the removal of}} Cisneros. Many of them required the new authorities to be elected by the Cabildo. Pascual Ruiz Huidobro proposed that the Cabildo should rule in the interim and appoint a new government, but <b>this</b> <b>proposal</b> made no reference to popular sovereignty or {{the creation of a}} junta. <b>This</b> <b>proposal</b> received 35votes, and sought simply to replace Cisneros with Huidobro: Huidobro was the most senior military officer, and thus the natural candidate under current laws to replace the viceroy in the lack of a new appointment from Spain. Juan Nepomuceno Solá proposed a junta composed of delegates from all the provinces of the viceroyalty, while the Cabildo should govern in the interim; <b>this</b> <b>proposal</b> received nearly 20votes. Cornelio Saavedra, whose aforementioned proposal was that the Cabildo should appoint a Junta and rule in the interim, got the largest number of votes. A number of other proposals received only a few votes each.|$|E

5|$|In 1887 Michelson {{proposed}} {{the use of}} optical interferometers for the measurement of length, work which contributed to him being awarded the Nobel Prize in 1907.

By 1975, when the second had been {{defined in terms of}} a physical phenomenon rather than the earth's rotation and Einstein's assertion that the speed of light was constant, the CGPM authorised the CIPM to investigate the use of the speed of light {{as the basis for the}} definition of the metre. <b>This</b> <b>proposal</b> was accepted in 1983.|$|E

40|$|Given {{a change}} proposal, {{how can we}} {{evaluate}} the changeability of the original system to absorb <b>this</b> change <b>proposal</b> before change implementation? Changes to software often have unexpected ripple effects. To avoid this and alleviate the risk of performing undesirable changes, a predictive measurement of these ripple effects should be conducted and a decision of acceptance or rejection should be made on <b>this</b> change <b>proposal.</b> In <b>this</b> paper, we propose an approach to evaluate a software system's changeability with two steps. First, our approach uses formal concept analysis to perform change impact analysis, which estimates the ripple effects of the change proposal.
