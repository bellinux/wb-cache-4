5|$|From 1901 to 1903 White was the {{proprietor}} of the Ka Lei Nani Saloon in Lahaina, which was advertised in The Maui News. In later life, he moved from Lahaina to Honolulu in 1907. After an illness of eight months, he died on November2, 1925, at his home at 604Kalihi near North Queen, in Honolulu. He was buried in an unmarked grave at the Kaʻahumanu Society Cemetery, next <b>to</b> <b>where</b> <b>his</b> widow would later be laid to rest.|$|E
5|$|The United States Veterans Hospital at Northport Long Island New York {{maintains}} a memorial plaque that names {{all of the}} Medal of Honor recipients who have lived in Long Island. Lt. Murphy's name was placed in honor on this memorial shortly after {{he was awarded the}} Medal of Honor. Others honored include President Theodore Roosevelt, General Theodore Roosevelt, Jr., and Murphy’s fellow Eastern Long Island hero Garfield Langhorn. The Memorial, which is at the back end of the hospital lobby, is in close proximity <b>to</b> <b>where</b> <b>his</b> mother works in the hospital.|$|E
5|$|At a church, {{the killer}} is searching through files {{when he is}} interrupted, and flees, leaving bloodied {{fingerprints}} at the scene. Black constructs {{a profile of the}} man, and deduces that his actions are attacks on faith, believing that the killer has suffered a devastating loss which has caused him to lose his own faith. As the manhunt for the killer tightens, another cleric is tortured and killed; however, Black senses that the killer has returned <b>to</b> <b>where</b> <b>his</b> life fell apart. He and the police are able to identify the killer as Galen Calloway (Michael Zelniker), whose wife and daughter had been killed in a house fire several years earlier. Black knows the killer's next target will be the church that held the family's funeral.|$|E

5|$|At {{first the}} {{incursion}} was countered by the RAR, {{but after a}} tactical error in its third engagement with the guerrillas led to casualties, the African Rifles were joined by 2 Commando, RLI on 25 August 1967. The insurgents were consistently undone in their incursions by the suspicion of Rhodesia's rural blacks, whose tribal chiefs and headmen would often work together to inform the police and security forces of the infiltrators' presence. This proved to be no exception: when a cadre visited a local kraal early on 31 August to obtain food, an old woman invited him to stay and kept him there while she sent a young girl to alert the security forces. 7 Troop, 2 Commando arrived at 07:20 and captured the insurgent, who then guided 7 Troop, led by Lieutenant Charl Viljoen, and a platoon of RAR men <b>to</b> <b>where</b> <b>his</b> five comrades were encamped. The combined force surrounded the guerrillas and opened fire, killing four; the fifth escaped and returned to Zambia. The next day, on 1 September, some 2 Commando troops in ambush were informed by a tractor driver {{that he had been}} given money by 14 guerrillas the previous night to buy mielie-meal for them, and that they would be collecting it from him at his kraal that evening. A sweep was planned; the tractor driver was briefed and returned to the kraal with the mielie-meal while 2 Commando and the RAR formed a cordon around it. The following morning the soldiers performed their sweep but failed to find the enemy, who were already gone. The insurgents, who were actually 17 in number and all South African Umkhonto fighters, crossed the border into Botswana and were arrested there on 3 September. Of the 79 cadres who had crossed the border on 1 August, 29 were killed and 17 captured within Rhodesia, 29 were arrested in Botswana, where one also died, one was arrested in Durban and one escaped back to Zambia. One remained unaccounted for. Nickel was officially closed at 06:00 on 8 September 1967.|$|E
25|$|In 2009, a CAT scan {{revealed}} that the stomach had shifted upward <b>to</b> <b>where</b> <b>his</b> lower lung area would normally be. Analysis of the contents revealed the partly digested remains of ibex meat, confirmed by DNA analysis, suggesting he had a meal {{less than two hours}} before his death. Wheat grains were also found.|$|E
25|$|David Stern is a {{computer}} geek who takes {{a job with the}} Dordogne River Valley archeological site just to be close <b>to</b> <b>where</b> <b>his</b> girlfriend is going to school. When Doniger calls Marek and asks him to pick his three best people to return to New Mexico, Marek chooses Stern {{to be part of the}} team. When the science behind the ability to transmit people to other universes is discussed, Stern probably understands it better than anyone else. Stern is also the only one who recognizes that it is dangerous and chooses not to go. However, by not going, Stern becomes a key part of the team by assuring their survival in his innovations to rebuild the water walls that provide buffer for the re-building team. Stern saves their lives.|$|E

25|$|Rosalie Tsannie-Burseth, the province’s local coroner who had {{arranged}} {{the removal of}} Carnegie's body, gave a hypothetical reconstruction of what happened. Her reconstruction was based on tracks of people and animals she observed {{near the site of}} the attack the day after the event occurred. She speculated that Carnegie had walked from the camp {{and by the time he}} was a kilometer away near Lake Wollaston, a wolf began following his tracks. One wolf stalked Carnegie from the forest and another wolf stalked him from the lake. Boot prints in the snow showed that Carnegie quickened his pace, as two more wolves approached him from the sides. The first apparent struggle occurred 2.2metres (7ft) from where the chase began. Four more scuffle sites were found leading <b>to</b> <b>where</b> <b>his</b> body was discovered. Tsannie-Burseth believed that Carnegie probably fought hard before finally succumbing.|$|E
25|$|Both of Montgomery's stepsons became army {{officers}} in the 1930s (both were serving in India {{at the time of}} their mother's death), and both served in the Second World War, each eventually attaining the rank of Colonel. While serving as a GSO2 with Eighth Army, Dick Carver was sent forward during the pursuit after El Alamein to help identify a new site for Eighth Army HQ. He was taken prisoner at Mersa Matruh on 7 November 1942. Montgomery wrote to his contacts in England asking that inquiries be made via the Red Cross as <b>to</b> <b>where</b> <b>his</b> stepson was being held, and that parcels be sent to him. Like many British POWs, the most famous being General Richard O'Connor, Dick Carver escaped in September 1943 during the brief hiatus between Italy's departure from the war and the German seizure of the country. He eventually reached British lines on 5 December 1943, to the delight of his stepfather, who sent him home to Britain to recuperate.|$|E

500|$|Because of his father's career, Hextall's {{education}} {{was far from}} stable; each year began at Brandon, and once the hockey season commenced in October, he moved to a school nearer <b>to</b> <b>where</b> <b>his</b> father was playing. At school, he achieved B and C grades, putting in the minimum amount of effort, but his mind remained on hockey, and specifically goaltending. [...] "Everybody else would be working and I'd be drawing pictures of Tony Esposito and Jimmy Rutherford," [...] he recalled. Hextall came to mostly enjoy the constant moving, later saying [...] "I got to hang around NHL rinks. What more would I have wanted?" ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{finishing}} at Woodstock in 1939, Scholberg {{left his}} parents in India, sailing on the [...] to enroll at the University of Illinois, close <b>to</b> <b>where</b> <b>his</b> sister lived. His attendance enabled him to avoid military conscription until 1943 when he graduated with a B.A. in History. At that time, he registered as a conscientious objector, much to the annoyance of his parents.|$|E
2500|$|Donna and Jen, displeased {{with the}} Police's investigation, began to {{research}} and piece things together {{without the help of}} the authorities. They came across Anthony, Gabriel and Daniel's cases and the similarities aroused their suspicions. They raised these concerns to the Police who denied any connection to the previous cases. A persistent Donna & Jen continued to contact the Police with questions and concerns until they eventually agreed to take Jack's sisters <b>to</b> <b>where</b> <b>his</b> body was found.|$|E

2500|$|The MiG-25 force (NATO {{reporting}} name 'Foxbat') {{recorded the}} first air-to-air kill during the war. A MIG-25PDS, piloted by Lt. Zuhair Dawood of the 84th Fighter Squadron, shot down an U.S. Navy F/A-18 Hornet from VFA-81 {{on the first}} night of the war. In 2009 the Pentagon announced they had identified the remains of the pilot, U.S. Navy Captain Michael [...] "Scott" [...] Speicher, solving an 18-year mystery. Captain Speicher, who was a Lieutenant Commander at the time, was apparently buried by nomadic Bedouin tribesmen close <b>to</b> <b>where</b> <b>his</b> jet was shot down in a remote area of Anbar province.|$|E
2500|$|The Commissioner of Crown Lands {{ordered that}} the remains be {{returned}} to the cave, only this time to be protected by iron bars, in spite of a call to have them moved to the Adelaide Museum. The suggestion that the remains needed to be housed in a museum for their protection proved to be prophetic, as Craig hid in the cave while the bars were being attached. After the workmen had departed, Craig removed the bars and stole the body once more. The remains were later described as being on [...] display by Craig in Sydney, (along with the stuffed crocodiles). From there they were next reported as having been sold at an auction in London in 1866, but it is unclear as <b>to</b> <b>where</b> <b>his</b> body went after that, in spite of unsubstantiated rumours that the remains were sighted in America around 1914.|$|E
2500|$|Hagrid had {{a long-standing}} {{friendship}} with Dumbledore {{who became a}} sort of surrogate father to Hagrid after his father's death. It was Professor Dumbledore who stood up for Hagrid upon his expulsion and got him the job as gamekeeper and keeper of keys and grounds at Hogwarts. Hagrid, in turn, was a loyal friend to and agent for Dumbledore in various situations. Professor Dumbledore would recruit Hagrid {{as an agent of}} the Order of the Phoenix during both wizarding wars. Hagrid was also trusted by Dumbledore to rescue Harry from his parent's collapsing home upon their deaths and later was sent to retrieve Harry on his eleventh birthday, tell him of his wizarding identity and take him to Diagon Alley to purchase his supplies and equipment. Hagrid has been protective of Dumbledore and defended his honour against those who would speak badly about Dumbledore such as Vernon Dursley. Hagrid refers to Dumbledore as a [...] "great man" [...] and Dumbledore continued to help Hagrid and comfort him when he was in distress. Hagrid was stricken by grief when Dumbledore died and wept openly at the funeral services after having carried Dumbledore's body <b>to</b> <b>where</b> <b>his</b> tomb was to be.|$|E
