6000|$|Well, {{these people}} always get one interested. Before I well knew {{how it came}} about, <b>this</b> one <b>was</b> <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> his history, and I was all {{attention}} and sympathy. He told it something like this:-- ...|$|R

6000|$|Ernest {{followed}} the man {{up with a}} vague foreboding that the deferred explosion was at last about to take place. Lord Exmoor {{was sitting on the}} sofa. 'Oh, I say, Le Breton,' he began in his good-humoured way, 'what's <b>this</b> that Lynmouth's <b>been</b> <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> about the pigeon-shooting?

60|$|CAESAR. Resent! O thou foolish Egyptian, {{what have}} I {{to do with}} resentment? Do I resent the wind when it chills me, or the night when it makes me stumble in the darkness? Shall I resent youth when it turns from age, and {{ambition}} when it turns from servitude? To <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> such a story as <b>this</b> <b>is</b> but to <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> that the sun will rise to-morrow.|$|R

But I still failed to see what Mrs. Gallilee's extravagances {{had to do with}} her wicked {{resolution}} to prevent Ovid from marrying me. Miss Minerva's only answer to <b>this</b> <b>was</b> to <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> to write to Mr. Mool, while I had the chance, and ask for a copy of my father's Will. 'I will take the letter to him,' she said, 'and bring the reply myself. It will save time, if it does nothing else.' The letter was written in a minute. Just as she took it from me, the parlour-maid announced that the early dinner was ready.|$|R
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with Times Now, Julian Assange labelled the Indian government's response as [...] "one of {{the worst in the}} world" [...] and a [...] "clear attempt to mislead the nation on what the cables were". Assange stated, [...] "The response by the government left a lot to be desired. Before {{it was clear to me}} that Prime Minister Mr. Singh was deliberately attempting to mislead the Indian people on what type of material <b>this</b> <b>was.</b> People <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> that he <b>is</b> not personally corrupt, I do not know myself as I don't have information on that. But, his reaction left a lot to be desired. It wasn't to fully and frankly investigate what was going on and then provide finding to the parliament. Rather, it was attempt to spin the issue and I suspect that has come from experience in dealing with similar scandals in the past." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{seemed to}} believe the boy, I didn't know why. Something in me seemed to believe him--my consciousness, as you may say; but my reason didn't. My reason {{straightway}} began to clamor; that was natural. I didn't know {{how to go about}} satisfying it, because I knew that the testimony of men wouldn't serve--my reason would say they were lunatics, and throw out their evidence. But all of a sudden I stumbled on the very thing, just by luck. I knew that the only total eclipse of the sun {{in the first half of}} the sixth century occurred on the 21st of June, A.D. 528, O.S., and began at 3 minutes after 12 noon. I also knew that no total eclipse of the sun was due in what to me was the present year--i.e., 1879. So, if I could keep my anxiety and curiosity from eating the heart out of me for forty-eight hours, I should then find out for certain whether <b>this</b> boy <b>was</b> <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> the truth or not.|$|R
2500|$|Geoff Davies of Probe Plus {{recalled}} that after hearing a test pressing of Back in the D.H.S.S, John Peel said [...] "Geoff, what's this, I've just played the first side of <b>this,</b> what <b>is</b> it, <b>tell</b> <b>me,</b> it's just fantastic and all". Other famous Peel quotes about the band include [...] "I've said it before, a national treasure, there's {{no question about}} it. When I die, I {{want them to be}} buried with me." [...] (14 August 1996) and [...] "In a decently ordered society, members of Half Man Half Biscuit would be routinely carried shoulder high through the streets of every city they visited" [...] (10 July 1997).|$|R

5000|$|What <b>tells</b> <b>me</b> that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> right? What <b>tells</b> <b>me</b> {{that all}} the rest was wrong? Certainly not my {{aesthetic}} sense. I would never claim that Auschwitz-Birkenau-Monowitz was good to look at. Or to listen to, or to smell, or to taste, or to touch. There was, among my colleagues there, a general though desultory quest for greater elegance. I can understand that word, and all its yearning: elegant. Not for its elegance did I come to love the evening sky above the Vistula, hellish red with the gathering souls. Creation is easy. Also ugly. Hier ist kein warum. Here there is no why. Here there is no when, no how, no where. Our preternatural purpose? To dream a race. To make a people from the weather. From thunder and from lightning. With gas, with electricity, with shit, with fire.(p119-120, Vintage edition, 1992) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then {{when they}} come out of his hand, you are at liberty to cut off mine," [...] {{answered}} Foy hotly. [...] "I have been brought up with Adrian, and I know what he is; he is vain and pompous, and every time he looks at you and me he thanks God that he was not made like that. Also he has failings and vices, and he is lazy, being too fine a gentleman to work like a common Flemish burgher, {{and all the rest of}} it. But, father, he has a good heart, and if any man outside <b>this</b> house <b>were</b> to <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> that Adrian <b>is</b> capable of playing the traitor and bringing his own family to the scaffold, well, I would make him swallow his words, or try to, that is all. As regards what he said about my mother's first marriage"--and Foy hung his head--"of course it is a subject on which I have no right to talk, but, father, speaking as one man to another--he is sadly placed and innocent, whatever others may have been, and I don't wonder that he feels sore about the story." ...|$|R

6000|$|There was {{a mixture}} of truth {{in this part of the}} charge which disconcerted Lord Glenvarloch exceedingly; for he could not, as a man of honour, deny that Lord Dalgarno, and others, had {{occasionally}} jested with him on the subject of Dame Nelly, and that, though he had not played exactly le fanfaron des vices qu'il n'avoit pas, he had not at least been sufficiently anxious to clear himself of the suspicion of such a crime to men who considered it as a merit. It was therefore with some hesitation, and in a sort of qualifying tone, that he admitted that some idle jests had passed upon such a supposition, although without the least foundation in truth. John Christie would not listen to his vindication any longer. [...] "By your own account," [...] he said, [...] "you permitted lies to be told of you injest. How do I know you are speaking truth, now you are serious? You thought it, I suppose, a fine thing to wear the reputation of having dishonoured an honest family,--who will not think that you had real grounds for your base bravado to rest upon? I will not believe otherwise for one, and therefore, my lord, mark what I have to say. You are now yourself in trouble--As you hope to come through it safely, and without loss of life and property, <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> where <b>this</b> unhappy woman <b>is.</b> <b>Tell</b> <b>me,</b> if you hope for heaven--tell me, if you fear hell--tell me, as you would not have the curse of an utterly ruined woman, and a broken-hearted man, attend you through life, and bear witness against you at the Great Day, which shall come after death. You are moved, my lord, I see it. I cannot forget the wrong you have done me. I cannot even promise to forgive it--but--tell me, and you shall never see me again, or hear more of my reproaches." ...|$|R
