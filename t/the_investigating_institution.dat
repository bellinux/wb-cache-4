40|$|Methodological {{challenges}} and {{problems associated with}} the evaluation of diagnostic tests were identified within a narrative review and the results were described according to an evidence hierarchy model developed by Fryback and Thornbury. Methodological guidelines of selected institutions (MSAC, IQWiG, EUnetHTA, NICE) were used to elicit similarities and differences in the evaluation of diagnostics between these institutions. These findings were also presented based on the hierarchy model. Finally, a checklist was developed as an aid for decision-makers for structuring questions on benefits, harms and costs of a test in order to facilitate the assessment of diagnostic technologies. For the evaluation of diagnostic test from a decision-makers perspective, the assessment of patient-relevant outcomes is of utmost importance. In order to assess these patient-relevant outcomes, not only consequences of the test itself but also of any subsequent therapies have to be taken into account. This can be done directly, if studies are available which compare therapeutic consequences of the new test with the therapeutic consequences of the reference test. As these studies are rare, „linked evidence“ offers an alternative by linking studies on diagnostic accuracy to studies on therapeutic effectiveness. However, many methodological challenges are associated with the assessment of the quality of studies on diagnostic accuracy and several requirements have to be met for „linked evidence“. For example, unique methodological challenges of studies on diagnostic accuracy necessitate specific tools for judging the study’s quality. Moreover, the study population of the diagnostic accuracy study and the therapeutic efficacy study have to be comparable and a commonly accepted reference standard has to exist by which these studies can be linked. <b>The</b> <b>investigated</b> <b>institutions</b> based their evaluation of diagnostics primarily on benefits arising for patients. Their preferred method for assessing patient relevant outcomes is a systematic review and three of the institutions mention “linked evidence” as a possibility to indirectly establish these outcomes.

It is necessary to maintain law order, secure political decision making processes, guarantee individual freedom, and protect human rights. Beside, in the context of law enforcement process, the independence of judiciary system is needed for materialization of the principle of law based State. The judiciary system will be independent as long as the stake holders of that institution are independent and truth and justice oriented. The independence of the police institution as sub-system of the judiciary is necessary in the investigation of crime. Normatively it was recognized that the police is institutionally independent and separated from the TNI since 1 July 2000, by the promulgation of the People Assembly Number: VI/MPR/ 2000 and Act Number: 2 / 2002 on Indonesian Police. However, in operational level there are external and internal shortcomings. Internal shortcomings meant are the behavior of the criminal investigator police which are not transparent, militaristic, unprofessional, discriminative, and tends to use violent actions. External shortcomings are problem related to the existence of legal instruments, vertical and horizontal intervention from the colleagues, public, “old brother”, and limited budget and facilities to support investigation process.  The independence of the police as <b>the</b> criminal <b>investigating</b> <b>institution</b> in <b>the</b> criminal justice system requires supporting aspects such as available legal instrument, well organization, political will of the government, capable human resources, budget, means, personal investigating police and cultural aspect of criminal investigating police as civilian police.

MÉTODO: trata-se de um estudo quantitativo descritivo do qual participaram os responsáveis pelo setor de neonatologia e os profissionais de saúde inseridos na segunda etapa do método respondendo a questionários. Os dados obtidos foram analisados por meio de estatística descritiva calculando-se frequências simples. RESULTADOS:das sete instituições públicas de Salvador quatro utilizam o método. Nas três instituições pesquisadas realizam-se as três etapas preconizadas, em duas delas o quadro profissional tem pelo menos um atuante de cada especialidade recomendada pelo Ministério da Saúde, no entanto evidencia-se reduzido número de fonoaudiólogos nos serviços. Dentre as principais ações dos profissionais da saúde inseridos na segunda etapa estão o incentivo ao posicionamento canguru, ao aleitamento materno exclusivo e orientação às mães quanto aos cuidados com o bebê. CONCLUSÕES:evidencia-se que a recomendação do Ministério da Saúde de que o método seja implantado nas unidades médico-assistenciais integrante do Sistema Único de Saúde ainda não é uma realidade em todos os hospitais/ maternidades públicos de Salvador, no entanto evidenciou-se quadro profissional em conformidade com a recomendação em duas das instituições pesquisadas e a atuação dos profissionais entrevistados se incorpora no campo da transdisciplinaridade. PURPOSE:to {{investigate how}} many public hospitals and maternity hospitals in Salvador use the Kangaroo Mother Method, {{who are the}} professionals inserted in the team, and to characterize the acting of the health professionals who are inserted in {{the second stage of}} the method.

An in-depth exploration of each case is provided with a view to understand {{the ways in which the}} internship training in the incubation model strengthens the learning, experience, knowledge, skills and interest of the university graduate interns/incubants to prepare them for full participation in their communities of practice in workplaces. The case study of Groen Sebenza internship project works across more than 40 partnering organisations. It is using incubation model for the first time in the biodiversity sector which is why its training needs to be investigated. To examine this question “In what way can training and the organizational support, of the incubation model strengthen the learning, experience, knowledge, skills and interest of interns/incubants to prepare them towards full participation in workplace roles and responsibilities in biodiversity occupations?” the research was undertaken in the context of university graduate incubants/interns in the Geographic Information System (GIS) field from three host-organizations; Limpopo Economic Development Environment and Tourism (LEDET), Environmental Systems Research Institute (ESRI) and South African National Biodiversity Institute (SANBI). The participants of the study were purposefully selected. Data was collected twice (i. e. after the first seven months and then a follow-up interview was conducted after a further five months) during the first twelve months of the project in the form of interviews and observations. There was also ongoing data collected in the form of documents which focused on their participation in workplaces and training. Data was analysed using different layers of qualitative content analysis and examination of documents at different stages of the study. Through immersion with the data and literature insights were developed regarding the enablers and constraints of the training in the incubation model related to the GIS interns. These included:- 1. The twelve months period spent by the GIS incubants in the Groen Sebenza internship project was not enough to prepare them towards full participation in workplace roles and responsibilities in biodiversity occupations. 2. Internship training is not just a ‘passing insignificant episode of the lives of the incubants/newcomers’ [specifically those from disadvantaged communities] but is a ‘real source of hope’. 3. <b>The</b> <b>investigated</b> <b>institutions</b> (and their members) need to make a real effort to improve if they want to stay relevant and useful in the Groen Sebenza internship project. 4. The incubants and mentors need to make the process of reflexivity real and practical. 5. The 2. 5 years incubation model has high potential to work if the institutions, the mentors and the mentees involved in GIS improve the challenges mentioned in the study. Drawing from the data and literature I have discussed and recommended a model which could assist in improving the internship programmes specifically for the university students who are from underprivileged communities...|$|R

The authors also explore how productivity spillovers from FDI changed with China's entry into the WTO in late 2001. They find robust positive and significant spillovers to domestic firms via backward linkages (the contacts between foreign buyers and local suppliers). The results suggest varied success with industrial promotion policies. Final goods tariffs as well as input tariffs are negatively associated with firm-level productivity.

40|$|Information {{management}} and customised applications {{of information technology}} are essential in knowledge based organisations. The implementation of an information system is one aspect of information management that regularly requires {{a huge amount of}} time and money. Therefore, to avoid the waste of resources {{it is important to know}} the users' needs and demands. By using an information analysis it is, for example, possible to investigate information needs, technical supported information and communication processes or designs. The aim of the thesis is to survey methods of analysis that identify users' demands and needs in terms of information {{management and}} systems. Additionally, it aims at finding out, which models are appropriate for cooperative and decentralised organisations respectively. Firstly, issues regarding the present information society and methods of information analysis are identified by carrying out an initial literature research. Secondly, an information analysis is developed and performed in a financial institution, which is characterised by its cooperative and decentralised organisation. The analysis consists of a standardised questionnaire and guided interviews. Both aim at analysing users' behaviour, the usefulness of the information systems supplied and the demands for a new system. The main outcome of this thesis is that there are different fields of application and models of information analysis.
