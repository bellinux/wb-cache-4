50|$|These birds feed {{mainly on}} plant material. When feeding in water, they {{submerge}} {{their heads and}} necks to reach aquatic plants, sometimes <b>tipping</b> <b>forward</b> like a dabbling duck. Flocks of these birds often feed on leftover cultivated grains in fields, especially during migration or in winter. They also eat some insects, molluscs and crustaceans.|$|E
50|$|Specific {{changes that}} occur because of this {{appliance}} including anterior teeth <b>tipping</b> <b>forward,</b> molar teeth tipping backwards {{and the increase in}} width of the arch formed by the lower teeth. The wire is kept 1.5 - 2.0mm from the front surface of the anterior teeth. Recently, advances have been made to use Lip Bumper with Mini-Screws for distalization of the upper back teeth.|$|E
50|$|A {{breast derrick}} is a derrick without a boom with a mast {{constructed}} from two upright members. The upright members are more spread at their bottom ends than their top ends. There are crossbars {{to join the}} two members from the bottom to the top to form a mast. Without the use of boom, the top crossbar {{is also used to}} connect to a sheave or a block that is used for lifting the load. The mast is prevented from <b>tipping</b> <b>forward</b> by guys connected to its top.|$|E

50|$|Restored to full {{working order}} by Sheffield City Council in the 1990s. The Fore & Aft tipper {{was based on}} a Faun design and was an early {{solution}} to the decreased density of refuse requiring some means of compaction. In this design the vehicle's body could be <b>tipped</b> <b>forwards</b> to allow the weight of the refuse to compress the load. Rearward tipping discharged the load. On later models as GWJ 667 J a hydraulically operated plate secured to the roof of the body gave extra compaction when <b>tipped</b> <b>forwards.</b> This device was known as a Powerpress. The Sheffield version is a narrow bodied model designed for use in narrow streets.|$|R
50|$|The male {{displays}} {{by flying}} up steeply, pausing, <b>tipping</b> <b>forward</b> and then gliding downwards. The female builds an untidy stick nest in a tree, usually a coconut palm and lays a single white egg, which hatches within 26 to 28 days. The squab fledges after another three weeks. In Australia they breed between August and January in mangroves, vines, palm fronds on off-shore islands, {{such as the}} Brook Islands. In north-east Queensland, they migrate daily as flocks from the islands to the mainland rainforests to eat fruit, returning to the islands at dusk.|$|E
5000|$|The American Star Bicycle {{was invented}} in 1880 by G. W. Pressey and {{manufactured}} by the H. B. Smith Machine Company in Smithville, Burlington County, New Jersey. It was characterized by a small wheel in front to avoid the problem of <b>tipping</b> <b>forward</b> inherent in other high wheelers. A Star bicycle was photographed being ridden down the steps {{in front of the}} United States Capitol in 1885 to demonstrate its longitudinal stability, and Star bicycles were used for the sport of bicycle polo in the mid-1880s. Pressey sued Smith in 1887 for royalties. The name [...] "Star" [...] was attributed to the double star arrangement of the spokes.|$|E
50|$|A {{physical}} example {{has been}} created that closely approximates the TMS model and exhibits self-stability without gyroscopic effects from the wheels and without positive trail. Since point masses do not exist in nature, the model can only approximate them with pieces of dense material (lead), mounted on a frame of light materials (carbon fiber and aluminum). To prevent the bike with just two masses, as pictured above, from <b>tipping</b> <b>forward,</b> a third mass is located just above the rear wheel contact patch where it does not alter the dynamics. In place of skates, small-radius wheels that drive nearly identical counter-rotating wheels are used to provide the non-holonomic ground contact with minimal gyroscopic effect. This physical example closely mimics the self-stability of the theoretical model.|$|E
5000|$|A retroverted uterus (tilted uterus, tipped uterus) is a uterus that is tilted posteriorly. This is in {{contrast}} to the slightly [...] "anteverted" [...] uterus that most women have, which is <b>tipped</b> <b>forward</b> toward the bladder, with the anterior end slightly concave.|$|R
50|$|Based on the B0 platform, the Duster {{measures}} 4.31 m in length, 1.82 m {{in width}} and has 210 mm of ground clearance. Its luggage space has {{a volume of}} up to 475 L, while with the rear benchseat folded and <b>tipped</b> <b>forward,</b> its carrying ability can exceed 1600 L.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Two light cones (with their {{accompanying}} frame vectors) in the cylindrical chart for the Gödel lambda dust solution. As we move outwards from the nominal symmetry axis, the cones <b>tip</b> <b>forward</b> and widen. Note that vertical coordinate lines (representing the world {{lines of the}} dust particles) are always timelike.|$|R
5000|$|The {{mechanism}} {{used was}} that of a derringer, with four fixed barrels. The linear hammer and its integral firing pin rotated within a fixed breechblock behind these barrels. The lock action was driven by a central coil spring around the hammer rotation axis, cocked by the ratchet mechanism that rotated the hammer after each shot. This ratchet mechanism, although only visible when the hammer was stripped and removed, bore some relation to the cylinder of the Webley-Fosbery self-loading revolver or even some retractable ballpoint pens. A similar rotating hammer in a 4-barrel breech was later used by Hillberg in the COP [...]357 Derringer. Reloading was in the usual derringer fashion, by the barrels <b>tipping</b> <b>forward</b> on a hinge ahead of the breech block.|$|E
5000|$|RoughRider {{functional}} design features include: low armrests to enable easy lateral transfers from chair to other surfaces, Pneumatic rear tires which are replaceable in bicycle shops worldwide, and adjustable rear wheel position which optimizes mechanical stability and performance for riders of different abilities. The design includes a long wheelbase with extra-wide front caster wheels that fit under the footrests and prevents <b>tipping</b> <b>forward</b> and {{is easier to}} push than standard wheelchair models. [...] The extra wide [...] "Zimbabwe" [...] caster wheels provide a smooth ride over rough ground surfaces while still being able to [...] "float" [...] over soft surfaces like sand without getting stuck. The foldable X-brace allows for storage and transport and allows the seat width to be adjustable. Additional modifications to shorten or lengthen the seat depth and back height are accomplished by adding foam cushions under or behind the seat cushion. Footrest adjustments are made by loosening one bolt on the footrest arm.|$|E
50|$|During the 1920s and 1930s Grégoire {{had become}} {{known for his}} {{expertise}} in two particular areas of automobile construction, these being lightweight bodies and front wheel drive. The AFG Dyna, planned under difficult circumstances in occupied France, had an all-steel tubular frame chassis, to which was attached a lightweight aluminium four-door superstructure. The style of the berline was modern and aerodynamic. Contemporary press photographs showing the car with three elegant young women seated {{in the front and}} three more in the back were presumably designed to emphasize the car's interior space, and the Dyna X certainly was usefully wider than the Renault 4CV. Nevertheless, the photographs almost certainly employed exceptionally thin young ladies and/or a certain degree of image manipulation, and it would have made more sense, even in that age of austerity, to view the Dyna X as a four seater for most purposes. At the back the usefully commodious luggage compartment was unencumbered by any spare wheel, since that was mounted on the rear panel outside the car. There was no exterior access to the luggage, which will have saved weight and expense, but from the passenger cabin it was possible to access the rear luggage compartment by <b>tipping</b> <b>forward</b> the rear seat cushion.|$|E

50|$|In {{a patent}} dispute {{involving}} rival crawler builder Best, testimony {{was brought in}} from people including Lombard, that Holt had inspected a Lombard log hauler shipped out to a western state by people who would later build the Phoenix log hauler in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, under license from Lombard. The Phoenix Centipeed typically had a fancier wood cab, steering wheel <b>tipped</b> <b>forward</b> at a 45 degree angle and vertical instead of horizontal cylinders.|$|R
50|$|During {{the parade}} lap as the field drove by, {{the people on}} the {{platform}} began to lean and wave at the cars, which caused the scaffolding to become unstable. It soon <b>tipped</b> <b>forward</b> and fell to the ground, crushing people who were underneath the structure, and the 125-130 people who were on it either fell or jumped to the ground. Linder and Craig were pronounced dead of broken necks, and over 80 were injured, about 22 seriously.|$|R
50|$|The {{panel van}} version has a luggage {{capacity}} of 3300 L {{and a maximum}} load length of 1.90 m, thanks to the foldable front passenger seat, that can also be <b>tipped</b> <b>forward</b> against the glove box to free up space for a load length of up to 2.42 m. If the front seat is removed altogether it provides a carrying capacity of 3900 L and a maximum load length of load length of up to 3.11 m.|$|R
50|$|The {{passenger}} version offers five {{seats and}} has a luggage capacity of 800 L, with a maximum load length of 1.16 m. It features one sliding side door, and as an option it can be ordered with sliding doors on both sides. The rear bench seat can be split asymmetrically and {{it can also be}} <b>tipped</b> <b>forward</b> against the front seats, which creates a carrying capacity of 3000 L and a load length of 1.57 m.|$|R

25|$|Early root {{growth is}} one of the {{functions}} of the apical meristem located near the tip of the root. The meristem cells more or less continuously divide, producing more meristem, root cap cells (these are sacrificed to protect the meristem), and undifferentiated root cells. The latter become the primary tissues of the root, first undergoing elongation, a process that pushes the root <b>tip</b> <b>forward</b> in the growing medium. Gradually these cells differentiate and mature into specialized cells of the root tissues.|$|R

50|$|The design {{had large}} two-bay biplane wings, with the longer upper wing fitted with strut-braced {{extensions}} {{that could be}} folded down during hangar storage. The lower wing {{was attached to the}} fuselage halfway up, so the aircraft sat close to the ground. In addition to the conventional landing gear there was a set of wheels mounted to the nose of the fuselage, to prevent damage if it <b>tipped</b> <b>forward.</b> The tailplane was large, with a central fin and two additional vertical surfaces for rudders.|$|R
6000|$|Throughout {{her whole}} deportment, {{there is an}} air of indolence, and [...] a want of {{interest}} in those exercises which should engage her [...] attention. In her seat, she most commonly sits in some lazy [...] posture;--either with her elbows upon her desk, her head leaning [...] upon her hands, or with her seat <b>tipped</b> <b>forwards</b> or backwards. When [...] she has occasion to leave her seat, {{it is in a}} sauntering, [...] lingering gait;--perhaps some trick is contrived on the way, for [...] exciting the mirth of her companions.|$|R
50|$|Prolapsed uterus in cattle, {{particularly}} dairy cattle, generally {{occurs in}} the first 12 hours post-calving. Frequent causes are hypocalcemia combined with irritation of the birth canal, causing straining. Replacement of the protrusion, which can range from {{the size of a}} softball to the hanging of the entire uterus down below the hocks, is performed with the cow in sternal recumbency, an epidural injection, and hindlimbs 'frogged' rearwards to allow the pelvis to <b>tip</b> <b>forward,</b> easing replacement. Careful washing and cleaning prior to replacement is important as is ensuring that the horns are completely everted once inside the cow. Often a Buhner suture is placed in the vulva to prevent subsequent reprolapse.|$|R
