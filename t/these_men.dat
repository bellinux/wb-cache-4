In regions where {{traditional}} roles prevail, a stay-at-home dad might be shunned by stay-at-home mom's peer group. In order to find support for their choice, <b>these</b> <b>men</b> have created and joined many support networks.|$|E

5|$|As {{the last}} {{surviving}} {{member of the}} RNAS, and the last living {{founding member of the}} RAF, Allingham was an honoured guest when the British Air Services Memorial was unveiled at Saint-Omer on 11 September 2004. During the ceremony Allingham was given the Gold Medal of Saint-Omer, which marked the award of the Freedom of the Town. The group of RAF technical trainees that joined him at this ceremony continued to visit Allingham at his retirement home in Eastbourne, demonstrating the bond of respect that <b>these</b> <b>men</b> had for Allingham.|$|E

5|$|At Hitler's behest, the Volkssturm (People's Storm) – a {{nationwide}} militia of men previously considered unsuitable {{for military service}} – was formed on 18 October 1944. Goebbels recorded in his diary that 100,000 recruits were sworn in from his Gau alone. However, the men, mostly age 45 to 60, received only rudimentary training and many were not properly armed. Goebbels' notion that <b>these</b> <b>men</b> could effectively serve {{on the front lines}} against Soviet tanks and artillery was unrealistic at best. The programme was deeply unpopular.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, San Francisco {{became a}} major debarkation point for {{servicemen}} stationed in the Pacific Theater. The U.S. military, which was concerned about male homosexuality, had a policy of dismissing servicemen caught in known gay establishments with blue discharges. As many of <b>these</b> <b>men</b> faced ostracism from their communities and families, they chose {{to remain in the}} city. The number of men that remained was a significant factor {{in the creation of a}} homosexual community in San Francisco.|$|E
5|$|During {{the years}} {{following}} 1857, none of the cabinets survived long. They quickly collapsed {{due to the lack}} of a majority in the Chamber of Deputies. The Conservative Party had split down the middle: on one side were the ultraconservatives, and on the other, the moderate conservatives. In the wake of Carneiro Leão's cabinet, a new generation of politicians had emerged, eager to acquire more power inside the Conservative Party. Paranhos belonged to this younger age group. <b>These</b> <b>men</b> saw their path to the top ranks as being blocked by the Conservative elders, who would not easily relinquish control.|$|E

5|$|Edward, {{or rather}} {{those who were}} {{wielding}} power on his behalf, also appointed {{a number of new}} ealdormen to positions in Wessex. Little is known of two of <b>these</b> <b>men,</b> {{and it is difficult to}} determine which faction, if any, they belonged to. Edwin, probably ruling in Sussex, and perhaps also parts of Kent and Surrey, was buried at Abingdon, an abbey patronised by Ælfhere. Æthelmær, who oversaw Hampshire, held lands in Rutland, perhaps suggesting links to Æthelwine.|$|E
5|$|Feuchtwanger {{was horrified}} and incensed {{at the way}} in which his work had been {{manipulated}} and distorted, calling Harlan's film a Schandwerk ("a shameful work"). In 1941, he wrote an open letter to seven actors. Based on the sentiments expressed in the letter, it appears that Feuchtwanger was shocked that <b>these</b> <b>men,</b> whom he considered colleagues and who he knew were familiar with his work, would agree to participate in Goebbels' antisemitic propaganda film.|$|E
5|$|Following the Mexican Revolution, the new {{government}} began persecuting the Church. To destroy the Church's influence over the Mexican people, anti-clerical statutes were inserted into the Constitution, beginning a 10-year persecution of Catholics {{that resulted in the}} deaths of thousands, including several priests who were also knights of Columbus. Known as the Mexican martyrs, <b>these</b> <b>men</b> have been canonized.|$|E

30|$|The foreign {{investments}} have {{plummeted to}} the least possible level; {{high rate of}} immigration of specialized forces has {{made it difficult to}} access <b>these</b> <b>man</b> forces and increased the costs of human resources. The economic growth has plunged dramatically, and the stock exchange indices have also fallen sharply. There is a sharp decrease in demands because the projects have been stopped.|$|R

5|$|From 1851 to 1854 Henry Denham {{captain of}} HMS Herald, {{which was on}} a {{scientific}} expedition to the southwest Pacific (1852–1856), completed the island's first hydrographic survey. On board were three Scottish biologists, William Milne (a gardener-botanist from the Edinburgh Botanic Garden), John Macgillivray (naturalist) who collected fish and plant specimens, and Assistant Surgeon and zoologist Denis Macdonald. Together <b>these</b> <b>men</b> established much basic information on the geology, flora and fauna of the island.|$|E
5|$|In 1789, Sally and James Hemings {{returned}} to the United States with Jefferson. He was 46 years old and seven years a widower. As shown by Jefferson's father-in-law, John Wayles, wealthy Virginia widowers frequently raped enslaved women. Historian Joshua D. Rothman noted {{it was not unusual}} for the time for Jefferson to choose to do so. White society simply expected <b>these</b> <b>men</b> to be discreet.|$|E
5|$|In April, the 2nd Ranger Infantry Company was {{reattached}} to the 7th Infantry Division, {{this time}} to the 31st Regimental Combat Team. The company spent the month training replacements, with up to 400 enlisted men filtering into the company. By May, the process of transferring <b>these</b> <b>men</b> to other units began as U.S. Army units throughout Korea, driven by necessity, began slowly desegregating. The Rangers eventually settled at a force of 123 men, among them the first white member of the unit, medic Joe Russo.|$|E
