5|$|By {{the end of}} 1914 {{the naval}} {{situation}} in the Pacific had eased {{to a large extent}} due to the sinking of the Emden, and it was decided that there was no longer a need to maintain guards on many of the less important facilities, and instead it was decided to concentrate the home defence network upon maintaining the coastal defences and on guarding ships while they were in port. Nevertheless, in the larger seaports these precautions required <b>the</b> <b>commitment</b> of considerable resources, requiring several hundred men to provide security. The requirement for the militia to undertake these duties was eased, however, when a special corps was raised from men that had been rejected for service with the AIF, to which a corps of garrison military police that had served in the AIF was added later.|$|E

5|$|Under communism, {{everyone}} was guaranteed employment. However, women suffered the double burden of paid and unpaid work, leading to lower birth rates. <b>The</b> <b>commitment</b> to social equality {{and the issue}} of declining birth rates allowed women to have some rights, such as child care and child allowances. For example, in the Soviet Union, maternity leave was extended to three years and part-time work was introduced. With the collapse of communism, many of these rights have been revoked due to the new largely male oriented democracy that has been put in place. Although there has been an increase in female workers, their need for welfare support such as child care has not been met, and has been ignored.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Mackay studied {{physics at}} the University of Cambridge under Ernest Rutherford before {{returning}} to Australia and his old job as a lecturer at the University of Sydney.

He was selected to command the 6th Division in 1940, and led it through the Australian Army's first battles of the war. Any doubts about his ability soon disappeared with <b>the</b> <b>commitment</b> of the division to the Western Desert Campaign. During the Battle of Bardia in January 1941, the 6th Division captured the fortified town along with 36,000 Italian prisoners. In the Battle of Greece, he became the only Australian general to face the Waffen-SS in battle. He suffered a series of reverses in Greece, but impressed the troops under his command with his courage under fire.
