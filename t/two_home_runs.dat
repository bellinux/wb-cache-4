5|$|Richard hit {{well for}} a pitcher, going 20-for-87 in the season with two triples, <b>two</b> <b>home</b> <b>runs</b> and seven runs batted in. After the season was completed, Richard {{underwent}} an emergency appendicectomy on October 26, 1977 at a Houston hospital. He {{spent most of the}} off-season working out at the Houston Astrodome and, for relaxation, fishing. In early 1978, he was a participant in ABC's Superstars all-around sports competition.|$|E
5|$|The Phillies {{returned}} home to play the Washington Nationals before the break. With Sizemore leading their lineup for the first time, they won 6–2; Burnett allowed two runs in 7 innings and Jimmy Rollins hit <b>two</b> <b>home</b> <b>runs.</b> The team's five-game winning streak ended on July 12, when they lost to the Nationals 5–3 in 10 innings with 15 strikeouts.

5|$|During {{the second}} game of the season, Davis hit his 200th career home run in an Orioles uniform, making him the eighth Oriole in {{franchise}} history to do so. On May 16, {{in a game against}} the Tigers, Davis went 3-5 with three runs scored, four RBIs, two walks, a double and <b>two</b> <b>home</b> <b>runs,</b> including the game winning home run in the 13th inning of the 13-11 victory. Davis became just the 2nd player in MLB history to hit <b>two</b> <b>home</b> <b>runs</b> in the 12th inning or later of a game, joining Matt Adams of the Cardinals. Davis also became the first Orioles player with multiple extra-inning home runs during a single game since Mike Young on May 28, 1987. His four RBIs also moved him past former teammate Brian Roberts for 21st all-time in franchise history. On May 18, Davis hit his 250th career home run (208th as an Oriole). He became the 221st player in MLB history to reach 250 career home runs. He also collected his 738th career hit as an Oriole, moving him into 50th all-time in franchise history. On May 24, he tied Brady Anderson for 7th in franchise history with his 209th career home run as an Oriole.|$|E

Reggie Jackson was sent up to pinch hit for the pitcher, Vida Blue, and hit a <b>two</b> <b>run</b> <b>home</b> <b>run.</b> Rod Carew walked. Three batters later, with two outs, Frank Robinson hit a <b>two</b> <b>run</b> <b>home</b> <b>run</b> to give the AL a 4-3 lead.|$|R
5|$|Hamels {{was named}} the Opening Day starter for the Rangers in 2016. On Opening Day, after {{allowing}} <b>two</b> <b>home</b> <b>runs</b> in two innings, Hamels calmed down to pitch 7 strong innings, while only allowing two runs on 4 hits and 8 strikeouts for a 2016 Opening Day win against the Seattle Mariners. On June 12, in a start against Seattle, Hamels recorded his 2,000th career strikeout, becoming the 77th player, and 7th active player, to reach the milestone. On September 28, at home against the Milwaukee Brewers, Hamels claimed his 200th strikeout of the season.|$|E
5|$|Playing as the Rays' primary catcher, on April 4 he went 2-5 with {{a three-run}} homer in a win over the Texas Rangers. Two weeks later he hit <b>two</b> <b>home</b> <b>runs</b> with six RBIs in a 16-1 win over the New York Yankees. In May, Hanigan, plagued for nearly two weeks by a {{strained}} hamstring, was finally placed on the 15-day DL on May 28. On June 17 he had a home run and a walk against the Baltimore Orioles, but he then missed several more games due to neck stiffness and later with soreness in his left side.|$|E
5|$|After a short {{stint in}} the minors in 2000, Nathan {{spent most of the}} season in the majors, {{finishing}} 5–2 and even hitting <b>two</b> <b>home</b> <b>runs.</b> But he struggled with his control, walking 63 in 93 innings and ending the season with a 5.21 ERA. He was on the disabled list twice: from May 17 to June 6 for right shoulder tendinitis and from July 14 to August 18 for an inflamed right shoulder, necessitating arthroscopic surgery on the afflicted shoulder {{at the end of the}} season. Nathan divided 2001 between the AAA Fresno Grizzlies and AA Shreveport both starting and relieving, finishing with a disappointing combined 3–11 record and an ERA over 7. Nathan improved slightly in 2002 to 6–12 with an ERA of over 5 at Fresno, but finally overcame his postsurgical struggles to return to the Giants in September with 3 scoreless innings in relief.|$|E

50|$|With {{his four}} hit, <b>two</b> <b>home</b> <b>run</b> game on June 28 against the Tampa Bay Rays, Cabrera {{became the first}} player {{in the modern era}} (since 1900) to go 4-for-4 or better with {{multiple}} homers in three games in a single season.|$|R
5|$|In Game 4 (the final game) of the NLDS {{against the}} Brewers, Burrell hit <b>two</b> <b>home</b> <b>runs</b> (a three-run game-winning home run against Jeff Suppan and a solo home run against Guillermo Mota) in a 62 victory {{that gave the}} Phillies their first playoff series victory since 1993. Four days later, {{in the first game}} of the NL Championship Series, he hit a game-winning solo home run in a 32 victory over the Dodgers. After going hitless in his first 14 at-bats in the World Series, Burrell doubled against J. P. Howell of the Tampa Bay Rays on October 29 in Game 5 (the final game of the series). Burrell was then {{replaced}} by pinch-runner Eric Bruntlett, who scored the game's winning run in the 43 victory as the Phillies won their first World Series since 1980. After the series, Burrell was chosen to lead the Phillies' World Series parade.|$|E
5|$|In an August 16 contest {{against the}} Marlins, Heyward hit <b>two</b> <b>home</b> <b>runs</b> {{for his first}} multi-home run game with the Cardinals. An {{important}} defensive play was on September 20 against the Cubs. With the bases loaded and no outs in the eighth inning, Addison Russell hit a fly ball that Heyward caught running and threw home to catcher Yadier Molina to tag out Anthony Rizzo by two steps, preserving a 4–3 win. In the second game of a doubleheader against Pittsburgh on September 30, Heyward hit his second career grand slam in an 11–1 win, giving the Cardinals their 100th victory of the season while clinching their third consecutive National League Central division title. He also robbed both Francisco Cervelli and Michael Morse of hits in this game.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day, {{when the}} Indians {{took on the}} New York Yankees, Ramirez went 3 for 4 with his first <b>two</b> <b>home</b> <b>runs,</b> with many {{of his family and}} friends in attendance at Yankee Stadium. His first career home run was hit against Mélido Pérez. However, rather humorously, his first MLB hit off Perez was a ground rule double that bounced into the left field seats as left fielder Paul O'Neill pursued it. Ramirez, seeing the ball in the seats, continued running thinking he had hit a home run, before returning to second base while his teammates ribbed him. After flying out to O'Neill in his next plate appearance, Ramirez homered in his final two at bats.|$|E
50|$|Bobby Murcer {{made his}} major league debut on September 8. He {{recorded}} his first hit on September 14, was a <b>two</b> <b>run</b> <b>home</b> <b>run</b> off Senators pitcher Jim Duckworth.|$|R
50|$|August 1, 2009, Andrew McCutchen of the Pittsburgh Pirates hit a solo <b>home</b> <b>run</b> in {{the first}} inning, a <b>two</b> <b>run</b> <b>home</b> <b>run</b> in the fourth inning, and a three <b>run</b> <b>home</b> <b>run</b> in the sixth inning of {{a game against the}} Washington Nationals.|$|R

5|$|After his MVP season, Killebrew {{signed a}} new {{contract}} with the Twins worth $90,000 ($ today). He was set to lead a team that had undergone a lot of change; Killebrew {{was one of only}} four Twins remaining from the 1965 pennant-winning club. He spent most of the season's first half continuing his success, and found Baltimore's Brooks Robinson rivalling him for the third base spot during the All-Star voting process; the two were neck-and-neck throughout. He continued his success through {{the second half of the}} year, and at season's end Killebrew had hit 41 home runs with 113 RBIs and finished third in MVP voting behind teammate Tony Oliva and Baltimore's Boog Powell, who won the award. The Twins again faced Powell and the Orioles in the 1970 American League Championship Series, a rematch of the previous season. The Twins were again swept, though Killebrew's performance improved as he hit <b>two</b> <b>home</b> <b>runs</b> in three games.|$|E
5|$|Before the 1927 season, Paschal {{returned}} his playing contract unsigned {{because of a}} salary dispute. By that time, the Yankees were forming the nucleus of what became the Murderers' Row teams of the late 1920s. He signed for an estimated $8,000 ($ today), a 13% raise. In the season-opening win against the Athletics, right field starter Babe Ruth struck out twice and popped out, forcing Huggins to replace him with Paschal in the sixth inning. As the last man ever to pinch-hit for Ruth, Paschal singled. In one of his few starts of the 1927 season, Paschal was a single short of hitting for the cycle, and almost had three home runs. Replacing the injured Bob Meusel, Paschal hit <b>two</b> <b>home</b> <b>runs,</b> a triple that was yards shy of a home run, and a double which bounced off the right field stands during an 11–2 rout of the Indians. Paschal did not play in the Yankees' 1927 World Series victory over the Pittsburgh Pirates. Overall, he played in 50 games, primarily as a pinch hitter. After the season, Paschal was discussed as a trade for Boston Red Sox pitcher Red Ruffing, but discussions fell apart (Ruffing was later acquired in a proposed trade during the 1930 season).|$|E
5|$|Cliff Lee {{pitched a}} {{complete}} {{game in the}} Phillies' Game1 victory, allowing only one unearned run, while Chase Utley hit <b>two</b> <b>home</b> <b>runs.</b> In Game2, solo home runs by Mark Teixeira and Hideki Matsui helped the Yankees win by a score of 3–1. After a rain delayed start, Game3 featured more offense, with a combined six home runs and thirteen total runs {{en route to a}} Yankee victory. The Yankees won Game4 by scoring the decisive three runs in the ninth inning after an alert base running play by Johnny Damon. The Phillies avoided elimination with a win in Game5, aided by Utley's second two–home run game of the series. The Yankees secured their World Series championship with a Game 6 victory in which Matsui hit his third home run of the series. He was named Most Valuable Player (MVP) of the series, making him the first Japanese-born player and the first full-time designated hitter to win the award; Matsui was the series' MVP despite starting only the three games that were played at Yankee Stadium, since the designated hitter position is not used in NL ballparks.|$|E

5|$|In June 2003, Young was {{promoted}} to the Harrisburg Senators of the Double-A Eastern League. He went 4–4 with a 4.01 ERA in 15 starts. In July, he went 3–0 and finished with an ERA of 3.03 over five starts. His season was highlighted by an eight-strikeout final outing on August 30 against the Norwich Navigators and a win on July 27 against the Reading Phillies in which he threw seven shutout innings. He was traded by the Montreal Expos to the Texas Rangers organization on April 3, 2004 in a preseason deal along with Josh McKinley for Einar Díaz and Justin Echols. He started the 2004 season with the Frisco RoughRiders of the Texas League where he went 6–5 with a 4.48 ERA in 18 starts. The only <b>two</b> <b>home</b> <b>runs</b> he allowed in his final 12 starts and 61 innings with the RoughRiders occurred on July 3, against Round Rock. He struck out a season-high eight batters on May 9 against El Paso.|$|E
5|$|On October 22, in Game 3 of the World Series, Pujols {{became the}} first player to get at least four hits, <b>two</b> <b>home</b> <b>runs,</b> and five RBIs in a World Series game in a 16–7 victory over the Rangers. Pujols had five hits, three home runs, four runs scored, and six RBIs in the game. He joined Babe Ruth and Reggie Jackson as the only players in {{baseball}} history to hit three home runs in a World Series game (Pablo Sandoval would also accomplish the feat the following year), {{became the first}} player in series history to have hits in four consecutive innings, and tied records for most hits and most RBIs in a World Series game. He had one hit and no RBIs the other six games of the series but became a World Series champion for the second time as the Cardinals defeated the Rangers in seven games. After the season, he became a free agent {{for the first time in}} his career.|$|E
5|$|Richard {{finished}} {{the season with}} a 20–15 record, 14 complete games, threeshutouts, and 214 strikeouts in 291innings of work. At age 26, Richard became only the second pitcher in Astros' history (after Dierker in 1969) to record 20wins in a season, tying him for fourth in the NL that year. Richard also became the ninth member of the Black Aces, an organization founded by Mudcat Grant that consists of all African American pitchers who have won at least 20 major league games in a season. He was named the Most Valuable Player of the Astros by the Houston chapter of the Baseball Writers' Association of America (BBWAA). Richard finished 17th in MVP Award voting and seventh in the NL's Cy Young Award voting. His 2.75ERA was the seventh-best among the league's starting pitchers, and he held hitters to a 0.212 batting average. He led the league in lowest number of hits allowed per nine innings and in walks allowed; Richard also {{finished the}} season second in batters faced, innings pitched and games started. In addition, he led all NL pitchers with 14 hits, <b>two</b> <b>home</b> <b>runs,</b> and nine runs batted in as a hitter. However, during the year he committed ten errors and finished with an 0.853fielding percentage, nearly 0.100 lower than the league average.|$|E

The next day in the last regular season game, <b>two</b> <b>home</b> <b>runs</b> were hit off Hoffman before he saved a 7–6 {{win over the}} Diamondbacks, earning the Padres their second consecutive NL West title. He was named MLB Delivery Man of the Month for September after being 10for11 in save opportunities and striking out 13 batters over 12.0 innings and allowing only seven hits. Hoffman saved 46 of 51 save chances on the year, and led the NL in saves {{for the second time}}. His 11th 30-save season set an MLB record, while his eighth 40-save season extended his record. His season save total was the second highest in his career. Hoffman won the Rolaids Relief Award {{for the second time in}} his career, was awarded The Sporting News NL Reliever of the Year for the third time, and finished as the runner-up for the Cy Young Award for the second time. In the playoffs, the Padres faced the Cardinals in the NLDS again. Down 2–0 in the series, Hoffman saved Game 3 in a 3–1 win to avoid elimination. However, the Padres lost the series 3–1 as their offense managed only six runs in the four games against the eventual 2006 World Series champions.|$|E
5|$|Kemp {{started the}} 2012 season {{by winning the}} National League Player of the Week award for the opening weekend. He hit <b>two</b> <b>home</b> <b>runs</b> and drove in eight RBIs during the opening series against the San Diego Padres. He {{was also the first}} Dodger to record three {{consecutive}} multi-hit games to start the season since Adrián Beltré did it in the 2000 season. This was the third time he had won the award, and second consecutive as he had won it the final week of 2011 as well. On April 10, Kemp became the first LA Dodger to have an RBI in the first five games of the season since J. D. Drew in the 2006 season and, counting the end of the previous season, he had nine straight games with an RBI, tying Roy Campanella (1955 season) and Augie Galan (1944 season) for the Dodgers franchise record. Kemp also won the Player of the Week award for the second week of the season, which, combined with winning the award in the last week of 2011, made him the only player to ever win three consecutive awards. He was also only the second player to win the award twice to begin the season, the other being Tony Armas for the 1981 Athletics. Kemp hit 12–22 with 4 HRs and a 1.182 slugging percentage, leading the club to its best 10-game start since 1981.|$|E
