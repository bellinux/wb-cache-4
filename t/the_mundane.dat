5|$|Inspired by <b>the</b> <b>mundane</b> {{sight of}} pebbles {{rolling in the}} Baltic Sea surf {{in the summer of}} 1921, Döblin began writing Berge Meere und Giganten that fall, {{conducting}} extensive research into various natural and human sciences in the process. Although he had originally conceived of it as a hymn to the city and technology, over the course of writing the novel it evolved into a tribute to the power of nature. He finished the manuscript in the summer of 1923, and it was published by Fischer Verlag the following year.|$|E
5|$|The 1980s {{also saw}} the birth of Cyc, the first attempt to attack the commonsense {{knowledge}} problem directly, by creating a massive database that would contain all <b>the</b> <b>mundane</b> facts that the average person knows. Douglas Lenat, who started and led the project, argued {{that there is no}} shortcut ― the only way for machines to know the meaning of human concepts is to teach them, one concept at a time, by hand. The project was not expected to be completed for many decades.|$|E
5|$|Although <b>the</b> <b>mundane</b> {{subject was}} {{constant}} throughout the Haystack series, the underlying theme {{may be seen}} as the transience of light. This concept enabled Monet to use repetition to show nuances of perception as the time of day, the seasons and the weather changed. The almost unvarying subject provided the basis for him to compare changes of light and mood across his nuanced series. The first paintings in the series were started in late September or early October 1890, and he continued producing these paintings for about seven months. These paintings made Monet the first painter to paint such a large quantity of pictures of the same subject matter differentiated by light, weather, atmosphere and perspective.|$|E

5|$|Contemporary critics {{gave the}} song mixed reviews, some {{claiming}} {{it to be}} Allen's sweetest lyrical moments, while others accuse it of being a fraud. The single peaked at number twenty-one on the UK Singles Chart, being her first single not {{to reach the top}} twenty in the United Kingdom. The accompanying music video portrayed a view over <b>the</b> <b>mundane</b> moments of a dying relationship, with Allen watching herself and her ex-boyfriend together. It was directed by Nima Nourizadeh and was mainly shot in black and white. The song was performed live during her 2007 concert tour and also during her 2009 concert tour.|$|E
5|$|Contrasting against Caravaggio's sensual {{baskets of}} fruit, Chardin's plush peaches, or Cézanne's vibrant {{arrangements}} of apples, <b>the</b> <b>mundane</b> Campbell's Soup Cans gave {{the art world}} a chill. Furthermore, the idea of isolating eminently recognizable pop culture items was ridiculous enough to the art world that both the merits and ethics of the work were perfectly reasonable debate topics {{for those who had}} not even seen the piece. Warhol's pop art {{can be seen as a}} relation to Minimal art in the sense that it attempts to portray objects in their most simple, immediately recognizable form. Pop art eliminates overtones and undertones that would otherwise be associated with representations.|$|E
5|$|Louise's father, Prince Albert, died at Windsor on 14 December 1861. The Queen was devastated, {{and ordered}} her {{household}} {{to move from}} Windsor to Osborne House on the Isle of Wight. The atmosphere of the royal court became gloomy and morbid {{in the wake of}} the Prince's death, and entertainments became dry and dull. Louise quickly became dissatisfied with her mother's prolonged mourning. For her seventeenth birthday in 1865, Louise requested the ballroom to be opened for a debutante dance, the like of which had not been performed since Prince Albert's death. Her request was refused, and her boredom with <b>the</b> <b>mundane</b> routine of travelling between the different royal residences at set times irritated her mother, who considered Louise to be indiscreet and argumentative.|$|E
50|$|The {{band was}} formed in the Autumn of 1981 by vocalist/guitarist David Hansen, who was {{previously}} a member of Rhode Island's The Young Adults, and drummer Kevin Tooley who was in <b>The</b> <b>Mundanes.</b> <b>The</b> original line-up was completed by John Fredericks on lead guitar and bassist Baker Rorick (who later played in The Baxters, The Scarecrows and Purple K'niF).|$|R
5000|$|Gregg led two {{bands in}} college, the Lonesome Debonaires and Guns Galore, {{the latter of}} which {{included}} saxophonist Ken Field. In 1979, he joined the New Wave band <b>the</b> <b>Mundanes,</b> led by bandleader/guitarist/songwriter John Andrews ({{who went on to}} work in animation, notably as an executive producer of Beavis & Butt-Head).). <b>The</b> <b>Mundanes</b> also included keyboardist John Linnell, who went on to form They Might Be Giants with John Flansburgh. The band won the first WBRU Rock Hunt in 1980 [...] and released an indie single that charted on WBCN. They played throughout New England, opening for artists including the Ramones, Talking Heads, Joe Jackson and the B-52’s, and appeared on Boston’s WGBH-TV.|$|R
50|$|In 1981, <b>the</b> <b>Mundanes</b> {{moved to}} New York, {{at which point}} Linnell and drummer Kevin Tooley left the band, {{allowing}} Gregg {{to take on a}} more prominent songwriting role. The band recorded a demo produced by Mick Ronson (David Bowie, Lou Reed, Mott the Hoople) in 1982.|$|R
5|$|The {{events of}} Hatoful Boyfriend {{begin in the}} year 2188, when the protagonist, a teenage human girl invited to attend the prestigious bird-only St. PigeoNation's Institute, starts her second year of high school. After a hectic and surreal {{freshman}} year of attendance at St. PigeoNation's, the protagonist has grown accustomed to the confusion of being the only human in a school full of birds, and {{is looking forward to}} her sophomore year. The story of the dating simulation portion of the game follows the protagonist, and the inter-species love and hijinks—of both <b>the</b> <b>mundane</b> high school and quasi-anthropomorphic bird-specific varieties—that ensue as she draws the attention of and attempts to romance {{one of a number of}} eligible birds she comes in contact with over the course of the year.|$|E
5|$|The other {{possibility}} for Black {{is to keep}} his Bb4 as long as possible, exchanging it against the white knight only in favourable circumstances. A couple of attempts have been done with this in mind, with subtle variations along the moves a7–a5, b7–b6 and d7–d6. Against <b>the</b> <b>mundane</b> 10...d6 White can continue with 11.Nb3 (see diagram at right) {{to play on the}} queenside against the exposed Bb4, or 11.Nb1 to recycle the knight on the ideal d5-square. Another idea is the immediate 10...a5, to have the d6-square for the bishop, inhibit the b2–b4 push and have the possible a5–a4 pawn advance if the white knight moves to b3. In the game Mikhalevski–Chabanon (Bad Endbach 1995) Black kept the bishop with 11.Nb3 a4 12.a3Bd6 13.Nd4 Bc5 14.Nb5 d6 15.Nc3 Ng6 16.Bg3 f5 and had dynamic play.|$|E

50|$|The Shadowhunter Chronicles is a media {{franchise}} {{based on}} the writings of American young adult fiction writer Cassandra Clare, which encompasses three novel series, two short-story collections, four graphic novels, one film, a television series, and other media. These works are set in a universe where fairy tales and mythologies, both pagan and Judeo-Christian, exist with its figures existing alongside <b>the</b> <b>mundanes</b> (normal humans). A race of humans who possess angel blood, the Nephilim or Shadowhunters, is organized to patrol the Shadow World and prevent demons as well as Downworlders, including warlocks, faeries, werewolves, and vampires from attacking <b>the</b> <b>mundanes.</b> There is an uneasy peace, a treaty known as The Accords, between the governing body of the Nephilim, known as the Clave, and the Downworlders, not all of whom want peace or respect the Clave's authority.|$|R

25|$|Critics often cite certain {{works by}} García Márquez, such as A Very Old Man with Enormous Wings and One Hundred Years of Solitude, as {{exemplary}} of magic realism, {{a style of}} writing in which the supernatural is presented as mundane, and <b>the</b> <b>mundane</b> as supernatural or extraordinary.

In the completion stage, one dissolves the visualization of and identification with the yidam in the realization of sunyata or emptiness.
