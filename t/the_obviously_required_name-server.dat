The casting process results in the lowest density of lightweight concrete, which consequently has low compressive strength. The irregularly shaped aggregates compensate for the weak point {{in terms of strength}} while the round-shape aggregates provide a strength of 20 MPa. Therefore, the proposed casting process can be applied for manufacturing non-structural elements and structural composites requiring a very low density and a strength of at most 20 MPa...|$|R

We can explain behavior by its consequences. Resistance to this idea came from the feeling {{that this was not a}} casual explanation, since causes of behavior must precede the behavior.

40|$|Background: The {{spectrum}} of conditions classified under the term cancer poses particular challenges for quality measurement. Multimodal treatment combinations (surgery, chemo-, hormone-, immune-, radiation therapy) for this increasingly chronic illness frequently alternate between in- and outpatient settings. Multiple {{actors in the}} healthcare sector need to be monitored over what are often {{extended periods of time}} in order to measure quality. Aims and research questions: To inform the ongoing development of the Austrian National Cancer Plan, this report addressed the following study questions: - What are properties of high quality oncological care? - Which quality indicators for oncological care are available internationally? Which initiatives work on these? - What are important elements in indicator development for oncological care? - What are the practical challenges of implementing systems of quality measurement in cancer care? Methods: A systematic literature search in databases – reviewed independently by two researchers – was followed by an unsystematic hand-search via Google and on relevant homepages. To identify additional literature experts in the field were contacted. Results: The report focuses on ongoing activities and initiatives in the area of quality measurement in cancer care. 22 of these from seven countries are presented in some detail. In addition 17 complete indicator sets are included in the appendix. Further development efforts are particularly needed for quality indicators that compare subgroups, indicators for less frequent cancers, indicators that take psychosocial elements into account or address quality of life and incorporate patients’ perspectives. The same is true for end-of-life care quality indicators. Conclusion: Apart from <b>the</b> <b>obviously</b> <b>required</b> know-how for indicator development and the necessary establishment of an efficient electronic data collection infrastructure, knowledge about and experience with the development of clinical guidelines and patient pathways are crucial for establishing a quality system for cancer care. Data analysis and feed-back skills are required. In order to actually improve quality at the point of delivery of patient care, a sense of ownership for the quality improvement process needs to be fostered among stakeholders...|$|R

It was found that in medium without growth regulators, haploid shoots could initiate roots quite efficiently with the shortest time required for the emergence of roots and with the highest rooting rate; the response of the diploids was {{similar to that of the}} haploids and largely different from that of the tetraploids. <b>The</b> tetraploids <b>obviously</b> <b>required</b> longer time for the initiation of roots and had the lowest rooting rate.

By supplementing the medium with 0. 3 mg/L IBA, the time required for the emergence of roots from the tetraploid shoots was shortened and the rooting rate was increased largely. As a result, healthy tetraploid plantlets with fully developed root system could be efficiently propagated...|$|R

40|$|Among the {{significant}} difficulties of developing commercially viable wave {{power has been}} survivability in storm conditions and achieving high capacity factors. The oscillating wave motion, constantly changing wave-size, and extreme energy levels during storm conditions often lead to difficulties in reaching high capacity factors, keeping the system complexity down and avoiding over dimensioning. The Ocean Harvester {{is based on an}} innovation addressing these issues. What is unique with this concept is the way a counterweight is used to achieve a limited load on the generator and thereby a levelled power output that can be controlled to match the average level of incoming wave energy. These characteristics enable an exceptionally high capacity factor, excellent survivability and low system complexity, which altogether may lead to low capital- and O&M costs. This paper presents the working principle of the novel concept and introductory coordinated theoretical and experimental investigations of performance characteristics. Theoretical and experimental results agree very well and further simulations with the verified model using real wave data clearly show the advantage of the proposed concept. A high capacity factor is proven and <b>the</b> design <b>obviously</b> only <b>requires</b> existing types of components, making cost-efficient wave energy conversion feasible...|$|R

Hence, the aim of our research is to develop a comparable technique for assessing the vascular function. This approach would not require dye nor an additional infrared camera setup. It is achieved by first preprocessing the video data of a camera that records only the visible spectrum and then filter it spatially as well as temporally. The prepared data is again processed to extract information about the vascular function and visualize it. This method would provide an option to compute and visualize the vascular function using the data recorded in the visible spectrum by the surgical microscopes. Given this contact-free optical imaging system, physiological information can be easily provided to the surgeon without an additional setup. In the case of comparable results with the state-of-the-art, this technique provides a straightforward optical intraoperative angiography.

40|$|The {{anaerobic}} metabolism of 3 -hydroxybenzoate was {{studied in the}} denitrifying bacterium Thauera aromatica. Cells grown with this substrate were adapted to grow with benzoate but not with 4 -hydroxybenzoate. Vice versa, 4 -hydroxybenzoate-grown cells did not utilize 3 -hydroxybenzoate. The first step in 3 -hydroxybenzoate metabolism is a coenzyme A (CoA) thioester formation, which is catalyzed by an inducible 3 -hydroxybenzoate–CoA ligase. The enzyme was purified and characterized. Further metabolism of 3 -hydroxybenzoyl-CoA by cell extract required MgATP and was coupled to the oxidation of 2 mol of reduced viologen dyes per mol of substrate added. Purification of the 3 -hydroxybenzoyl-CoA reducing enzyme revealed that this activity was due to benzoyl-CoA reductase, which reduced the 3 -hydroxy analogue almost as efficiently as benzoyl-CoA. The further metabolism of the alicyclic dienoyl-CoA product containing <b>the</b> hydroxyl substitution <b>obviously</b> <b>required</b> additional specific enzymes. Comparison of the protein pattern of 3 -hydroxybenzoate-grown cells with benzoate-grown cells revealed several 3 -hydroxybenzoate-induced proteins; the N-terminal amino acid sequences of four induced proteins were determined and the corresponding genes were identified and sequenced. A cluster of six adjacent genes contained the genes for substrate-induced proteins 1 to 3; this cluster may not yet be complete. Protein 1 is a short-chain alcohol dehydrogenase. Protein 2 {{is a member of}} enoyl-CoA hydratase enzymes. Protein 3 was identified as 3 -hydroxybenzoate–CoA ligase. Protein 4 is another member of the enoyl-CoA hydratases. In addition, three genes coding for enzymes of β-oxidation were present. The anaerobic 3 -hydroxybenzoate metabolism here obviously combines an enzyme (benzoyl-CoA reductase) and electron carrier (ferredoxin) of the general benzoyl-CoA pathway with enzymes specific for the 3 -hydroxybenzoate pathway. This raises some questions concerning the regulation of both pathways...|$|R
