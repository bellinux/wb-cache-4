She wanders <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>halls,</b> where she defeats several obstacles, {{including}} a deadly laser beam obstacle and a giant blade that falls from the ceiling. However, she is eventually killed by a bounding mine. Her body is dumped into a pit filled with dozens of Alice copies and is revealed to be a clone. The camera zooms out to show a shack camouflaging the facility's above-ground entrance - {{with the rest of}} the facility located underground, surrounded by a high fence and thousands of zombies.|$|E
5|$|Pictures of {{shooting}} the music video in Lyngby, Denmark were released on Aqua's Facebook page on 14 September 2011. A take {{of the video}} was also uploaded on their YouTube channel. The video was officially uploaded on YouTube on 22 September. Directed by Michael Sauer Christensen, it is set in an eerie, empty house that is reminiscent of a horror film, where a black cloud wanders <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>halls</b> of the house. The members wear black and gray clothing in the video, with Nystrom's costume gradually changing throughout. The video ends by the members exiting the house through the roof and transforming into {{a beam of light}} shooting into the sky. The video uses a shortened radio edit of the original song, omitting the bridge.|$|E
5|$|Historian Carl Sferrazza Anthony {{noted that}} {{ordinary}} citizens responded to Nixon. When {{a group of}} rural people visited the White House to present a quilt to the First Lady, many were overcome with nervousness; upon hearing their weeping, Pat hugged each individual tightly, and the tension dissipated. When a young boy doubted that the Executive Mansion was her house {{because he could not}} see the washing machine, Pat led him <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>halls</b> and up an elevator, into the family quarters and the laundry room. She mixed well with people of different races, and made no distinctions on that basis. During the Nixons' trip to China in 1972, foreign minister Zhou En-lai was suffienciently smitten with her so as to give two rare giant pandas to the ambassador as a gift from China.|$|E

5|$|The Capitol {{has also}} been witness to murder and death. Rep. William P. Taulbee had been a congressman from Kentucky from 1884 to 1888. Charles E. Kincaid, a {{journalist}} for The Louisville Times, had accused Taulbee of adultery and involvement in a Patent Office scandal, which had ruined Taulbee's political career. On February 28, 1890, the ex-congressman and the reporter ran into {{one another in the}} Capitol, and Taulbee assaulted and embarrassed Kincaid by tweaking the much smaller man's nose. Kincaid ran home, grabbed a pistol, and, when he encountered Taulbee on a marble staircase leading from the House chamber down to the dining room, shot him in the face just below Taulbee's left eye. Taulbee died two weeks later, and Kincaid was acquitted after claiming self-defense. Journalists and others claim that whenever a reporter slips on these steps, Taulbee's ghost briefly appears. Former President and then-Rep. John Quincy Adams suffered a stroke at his desk in the House chamber on February 21, 1848, and was taken into the Speaker's Room. His physical condition was too precarious to permit him to be moved, and he died at the Capitol two days later. Many people claim to have heard Adams' ghost denouncing slavery late at night in National Statuary Hall, and one Congressional staff member claims that by standing in the spot where Adams' desk once stood a person can still hear the former president's ghostly whisper. James A. Garfield {{was a member of the}} House from 1863 to 1881 before assuming the Presidency in March 1881. Garfield was shot by Charles J. Guiteau, a disgruntled office seeker, on July 2, 1881, at 9:30a.m. as he walked through the Sixth Street Station of the Baltimore and Potomac Railroad in Washington, D.C. Garfield died of heart failure brought about by blood poisoning (itself caused by poor medical care) on September 19, 1881, while recuperating at a beach house near Long Branch, New Jersey. Witnesses have seen Garfield's specter walking solemnly <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>halls</b> of Congress.|$|E
25|$|This {{sophisticated}} form of hazing {{was played}} out {{each year in}} September. This elaborate hoax often gained the cooperation of faculty members {{and people in the}} town. During Freshman Week, the first-year students were informed about several student romances on campus through planned gossip. The story went that there was one ardent couple who were constantly together when not in class, but the girl had another upperclassman admirer. The couple argued over the love triangle and it ended in the girl walking off with her new boy. After that, there were public acts that involved the two boys fighting. The affair was all anyone would talk about. Then on a certain pre-arranged night, all freshmen were ordered to stay in their rooms by student governing bodies. At 10 pm, a drunk ex-boyfriend appeared at the men's dorm. He brandished a gun and staggered <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>halls</b> in search of his rival. He finally found him in one of the public archways of the building. Soon, several shots rang out and the victim fell to the floor with blood (ketchup) flowing from his mouth. Other upperclassmen took charge, sending confused and panicked freshmen in pursuit of the killer or for a doctor. A town physician would appear and call for an ambulance, only adding to the theatrics of the evening. Most other freshmen were rounded up and sent in groups to nearby hospitals to offer their blood for transfusion, but were left stranded. At the same time, the freshmen girls witnessed the girl in the triangle see the unconscious victim being taken away and go into a fit of hysterics. During the 1930s, a member of the staff was a Justice of the Peace. He presided over a fake hearing in a large classroom where freshman girls tearfully testified to what they thought they saw happen on campus that night. It was during that hearing that the truth was revealed when the three main actors walked into the room, arm in arm. The next day, the freshmen felt young and foolish, but were looking forward to the next year when they were able to play the same prank on new freshmen. The tradition died in 1946, when its last performance narrowly escaped tragedy when some ex-servicemen studying at LVC under the G.I. Bill threatened {{to take care of the}} villain causing trouble between the lovers.|$|E

500|$|Every fall {{students}} are encouraged to wear their class colors on football game day Fridays to show their school spirit. [...] The days of [...] Homecoming Week are themed, and students dress up to win spirit points for their class, culminating in the Friday class color day and pep rally.

500|$|UPN {{executives}} had {{pitched the}} series as following [...] "young doctors in peril at a haunted old Boston Hospital" [...] who {{must contend with}} [...] "a healthy dose of terrifying paranormal occurrences and gripping medical emergencies". In the pilot episode, Dr. Mitchell Grace (Grayson McCouch) begins working at the hospital immediately after graduating from medical school. He had specifically chosen the All Souls medical program, refusing offers from the Mayo Clinic and the Yaleâ€“New Haven Hospital, due to his personal connection with the hospital. While working as a janitor in the hospital, Grace's father died in 1978 after contracting a mysterious illness. Grace serves as the show's lead character, and functions as a detective {{as well as a}} doctor while trying to understand the inner workings of All Souls. As he works, Grace encounters both good and evil ghosts, and discovers medical experiments are being conducted under the guidance of the board of directors. Some spirits include [...] "a mad scientist and his Igor-like errand boy," [...] and a woman dressed in 19th century fashion pushing a baby carriage <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>halls.</b> Grace is haunted by visions of his father, and he is somehow connected with the ghost Lazarus and Civil War doctors. Dr. Dante Ambrosious (Jean LeClerc), the chair of the facility's board, is shown to have made deals with the evil spirits.|$|E

On 20 May 1793 women were at the fore of a crowd that demanded [...] "bread and the Constitution of 1793." [...] When their cries went unnoticed, the women went on a rampage, [...] "sacking shops, seizing grain and kidnapping officials." ...|$|E
2500|$|The crotch chop {{is used in}} the 2008 film Slumdog Millionaire by Jamal (Dev Patel) {{after getting}} away from {{pursuing}} security guards and by a character in the opening scenes of the 2007 movie Knocked Up. Fidel Edwards, the West Indian fast bowler has on occasions used the crotch chop after taking a wicket. It has also been used by Professional Bowler Pete Weber after getting a strike, Weber himself is a fan of wrestling. The character Kenny Powers in the HBO series, Eastbound & Down also uses the gesture in a fantasy sequence where he walks <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>halls</b> of the school where he works.

2500|$|The San Patricios {{used this}} battle {{as a chance}} to settle old scores with U.S. troops. [...] "The large number of {{officers}} killed in the affair was ... ascribed to them, as for the gratification of their revenge they aimed at no other objects during the engagement". At some point during the fighting for the convent, two American officers led fifteen men against a point in the Mexican defences, and mistook San Patricio members for friendly U.S. army troops; the San Patricios opened fire on them, killing and wounding {{all but one of the}} group. Though hopelessly outnumbered and under-equipped, the defenders repelled the attacking U.S. forces with heavy losses until their ammunition ran out and a Mexican officer raised the white flag of surrender. Officer Patrick Dalton of the San Patricios tore the white flag down, prompting Gen. Pedro Anaya to order his men to fight on, with their bare hands if necessary. American Private Ballentine reported that when the Mexicans attempted to raise the white flag two more times, members of the San Patricios shot and killed them. After brutal close-quarters fighting with bayonets and sabers <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>halls</b> and rooms inside the convent, U.S. Army Captain James M. Smith suggested a surrender after raising his white handkerchief. Following the U.S. victory, the Americans [...] "ventilat their vocabulary of Saxon expletives, not very [...] "courteously," [...] on Riley and his beautiful disciples of St. Patrick." ...|$|E
