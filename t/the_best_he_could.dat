In 1974, Cole {{declined to comment on}} the resignation of President Nixon in the wake of the Watergate scandal, but stated in 1977 that she felt sympathy for him, though she believed his resignation was necessary.|$|E
5|$|By 02:15 on 30 April one CH-46 and one CH-53 were {{landing at}} the Embassy every 10 minutes. At this time, the Embassy {{indicated}} that another 19 lifts would complete the evacuation. At that time Major Kean {{estimated that there}} were still some 850 non-American evacuees and 225 Americans (including the Marines), and Ambassador Martin told Major Kean to do <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>he</b> <b>could.</b> At 03:00 Ambassador Martin ordered Major Kean to move all the remaining evacuees {{into the parking lot}} LZ which was the Marines' final perimeter. At 03:27 President Gerald Ford ordered that no more than 19 additional lifts would be allowed to complete the evacuation. At 04:30 with the 19 lift limit already exceeded, Major Kean went to the rooftop LZ and spoke over a helicopter radio with General Carey who advised that President Ford had ordered that the airlift be limited to US personnel. Major Kean was then ordered to withdraw his men into the Chancery building and withdraw to the rooftop LZ for evacuation.|$|E

5|$|Bragg {{retained}} his position, relieving or reassigning {{the generals}} who had testified against him, and retaliated against Longstreet by reducing his command to only those units {{that he brought}} with him from Virginia. Despite the dysfunctional command climate under Bragg, and the lack of support from the War Department and President Davis concerning Bragg's removal, Longstreet did <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> to continue to seek options in the Chattanooga Campaign. While Bragg resigned himself and his army to the siege of the Union Army of the Cumberland in Chattanooga, Longstreet devised a strategy to prevent reinforcement and a lifting of the siege by Grant. He knew this Union reaction was underway, and that the nearest railhead was Bridgeport, Alabama, where portions of two Union corps would soon arrive. After sending his artillery commander, Porter Alexander, to reconnoiter the Union-occupied town, he devised a plan to shift most of the Army of Tennessee away from the siege, setting up logistical support in Rome, Georgia, to go after Bridgeport to take the railhead, possibly catching Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker and arriving Union troops from the Eastern Theater in a disadvantageous position. The plan was well received and approved by President Davis, but it was disapproved by Bragg, who objected to the significant logistical challenges it posed. Longstreet accepted Bragg's arguments and agreed to a plan in which he and his men were dispatched to East Tennessee to deal with an advance by the Union Army of the Ohio, commanded by Maj. Gen. Ambrose Burnside. Longstreet was selected for this assignment partially due to enmity on Bragg's part, but also because the War Department intended for Longstreet's men to return to Lee's army and this movement was in that direction.|$|E
25|$|After {{retiring}} from playing, LÃ³pez remained active by coaching and instructing youth players in Caracas. Everyman's ballplayer, he worked {{to overcome the}} challenges he faced in life and baseball. Although he had no opportunity to play at Major League Baseball, he simply took <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> find and took advantage of it. He permanently adjusted and readjusted his hitting style and pitching mechanics, came back from many injuries, but the Big Boy of Barlovento (el Muchachote de Barlovento in Spanish) persevered and won recognition as pitcher and slugger in all leagues where he played.|$|E

Newspaper {{publisher}} Victor Berger, now America's first socialist Congressman, had previously promised Simons a job on his English-language daily, the Milwaukee Leader, if he had ever needed a position. In June 1913, Simons decided to take Berger up on the offer, accepting the position without great enthusiasm but feeling as though it was for the time being <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> do. Algie and May Simons would be coming home to Wisconsin.|$|E

25|$|The Appomattox Campaign was {{an example}} of masterful, {{relentless}} pursuit and maneuver by Grant and Sheridan, skills that had been in short supply by previous generals, such as Meade after Gettysburg and McClellan after Antietam. Lee did <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> under the circumstances, but his supplies, soldiers, and luck finally ran out. The surrender of Lee represented the loss of only one of the Confederate field armies, but it was a psychological blow from which the South did not recover. With no chance remaining for eventual victory, all of the remaining armies capitulated by June 1865.|$|E
25|$|In Hungary, he {{took his}} only pole {{position}} of the season (on a short fuel load), and led for the first stint of the race until his retirement, when his pit-crew fitted a wheel incorrectly. After replacing the wheel, Alonso retired with a fuel pump problem. In Valencia, he finished in sixth place, describing it was <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> do, after his team appealed successfully over a one-race ban suspended for the race after the pit-stop incident in Hungary. However, his fastest race lap was slower than new teammate Romain Grosjean, replacing the sacked Piquet, despite Grosjean spending most of the race towards the back.|$|E
25|$|Law {{and order}} {{had broken down}} many times before Partition, with much bloodshed on both sides. A massive civil war was looming by the time Mountbatten became Viceroy. After the Second World War, Britain had limited resources, perhaps {{insufficient}} {{to the task of}} keeping order. Another viewpoint is that while Mountbatten may have been too hasty he had no real options left and achieved <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> under difficult circumstances. The historian Lawrence James concurs that in 1947 Mountbatten was left with no option but to cut and run. The alternative seemed to be involvement in a potentially bloody civil war from which {{it would be difficult to}} get out.|$|E

25|$|However, many {{argue that}} the British were forced to {{expedite}} the Partition by events on the ground.

25|$|There were {{criticisms of}} his leadership, too, {{some of which}} he {{eventually}} acknowledged. Many Indo-Fijians criticised him for not doing more to thwart the 1987 coups which removed an Indo-Fijian dominated administration from office, and for giving his consent to a new constitution, drafted in 1990, which guaranteed indigenous Fijian supremacy and was widely regarded as racist, even drawing comparisons from some quarters with South Africa's apartheid system. Mara defended {{his role in the}} post-coup era of 1987 to 1992, arguing that he was doing <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> in circumstances that he could not fully control, and that it had seemed better at the time to connive in the writing of a discriminatory constitution than to risk civil war at the hands of ethnic Fijian extremists. In 1996, he publicly apologised to the Indo-Fijian community {{for his role in the}} drafting of the 1990 Constitution. Mahendra Chaudhry, the leader of the Indo-Fijian community who in 1999 became Fiji's first Indo-Fijian Prime Minister, said that he did not agree with, but understood, Mara's reasons for acting as he did, and accepted his apology for having done so. Other opponents, both Indo-Fijian and ethnic Fijian, were less forgiving, however.|$|E
25|$|An early sign of {{the decline}} was the near-failure of the Lyons branch because of its manager's venality, saved only by heroic efforts by Francesco Sassetti (March 9, 1421April 1490). Its {{troubles}} were followed by the troubled London branch, which got into trouble for much the same reason the Bruges branch wouldunwisely loaning large sums to secular rulers, a group notorious for their delinquencies (in this case, the Yorkist usurper Edward IV). In a sense, that branch {{had no choice but}} to make the loans, since it faced domestic opposition from English merchant and clothier interests in London and their representatives in Parliament, which was only granting the necessary export licenses to foreign-owned enterprises if its members were well-bribed with loans. The London branch of the Medici bank had already been dropped as a full partnership in 1465, and had been reincorporated as an accomando. In 1467, Angelo Tani was dispatched to audit the London branch's books. Tani attempted to step up the collection of outstanding debtthe English king owed 10,500 pounds sterling, the English nobility 1,000, and another 7,000 pounds were tied up in goods dispatched on consignment and not soon recoverable. Operating funds were (like previous failing branches had done) borrowed from Medici branches at high rates of interest. Edward IV amortized a portion of his debt, but these reductions were soon rendered less helpful (but not negated outright) by fresh loans and sales of silk. By the spring of 1469, Tani had finished repairing the London branch's operations to his own satisfaction, and returned to Italy. His work would be undone by the unhelpfulness of the other branch managers and the fecklessness of the London branch manager Canigiani. The fatal blow was the Wars of the Roses, which rendered Edward IV unable to repay the loans (<b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> do in way of repayment was to lift all tariffs on the Medici exporting English wool until such time as the debt was repaid), and the branch had loaned far too much to the Lancastrian rebels (and not to a number of Yorkist loyalists), who would never repay their loans after their deaths and defeats. The London branch finished its liquidation in 1478, with total losses of 51,533 gold florins. The succeeding Tudors never paid off the outstanding Plantagenet debt.|$|E
