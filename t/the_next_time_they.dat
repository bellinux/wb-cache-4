Later, her new horde of fanboys find out where she works and flock to the restaurant, obsessively trying to get pictures up her skirt. Piro works undercover as a busboy {{to get rid of all}} cameras. The scene eventually builds to a climax, in which Kimiko shouts at the fanboys and lifts her skirt in defiance, and they take photographs. Piro, provoked by her outburst into actively defending her, threatens the fanboy crowd, and collects all of their memory cards with the photos. On the way back from the restaurant, Kimiko is suffering from the aftermath of the scene and lashes out at Piro on the subway, which causes him to walk off.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the risk of}} the vicious cycle created by expectations of individuals that the federal government will always come to their rescue {{in the aftermath of a}} disaster, and more so, that they can always expect at least as much relief as was given to victims of previous catastrophes. As a result, elected officials might feel that they have no alternative than to provide even more relief <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>time</b> if <b>they</b> want to benefit politically from their actions … This cycle is happening in the United States. While previous work has been done on the disincentive that relief creates for individuals to purchase proper insurance coverage (Buchanan, 1975; Coate, 1995), here we propose a more systematic political economic analysis of this escalating need for ever more relief and its impact on government revenues. We show that a government will benefit in the long run from simply capping relief payouts. However, this policy will prove more challenging to implement the longer one waits and eventually, it might be impossible politically for any new administration to do it. We show that the dominating strategy to limit government liability is to actually use two policy tools simultaneously: a publicly-known cap on relief payouts combined with the right level of public insurance subsidies...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Infrastructure {{networks}} like Internet {{have some}} coverage gaps (e. g. rural areas) where no service connectivity is provided. Cellular networks {{could be used}} in alternative but they usually associate their services with a usage cost. Nowadays, the growing number of mobile devices equipped with a wireless interface and the end-user trend to shift toward wireless technology has opened new possibilities for networking. Opportunistic networking seems a feasible solution in filling in these coverage gaps by providing service connectivity where it is not sustained by an infrastructure. In this context we provide a delay tolerant platform that ensures service connectivity where it is absent. Our approach follows the Delay/Disruption Tolerant Networking (DTN) paradigm by implementing a store-and-forward communication model between mobile users and carrier entities (e. g. buses), where a user delegates the carrier a task (bundle), the carrier stores it locally and whenever service connectivity is available (e. g. wi-fi at the bus station) tries to accomplish it, successively notifying the user of <b>the</b> task output <b>next</b> <b>time</b> <b>they</b> encounter again.

40|$|Transmission of Yersinia pestis by flea bite {{can occur}} by two mechanisms. After taking a blood meal from a bacteremic mammal, fleas have the {{potential}} to transmit <b>the</b> very <b>next</b> <b>time</b> <b>they</b> feed. This early-phase transmission resembles mechanical transmission in some respects, but the mechanism is unknown. Thereafter, transmission occurs after Yersinia pestis forms a biofilm in the proventricular valve in the flea foregut. The biofilm can impede and sometimes completely block the ingestion of blood, resulting in regurgitative transmission of bacteria into the bite site. In this study, we compared the relative efficiency of the two modes of transmission for Xenopsylla cheopis, a flea known to become completely blocked at a high rate, and Oropsylla montana, a flea that has been considered to rarely develop proventricular blockage. Fleas that took an infectious blood meal containing Y. pestis were maintained and monitored for four weeks for infection and proventricular blockage. The number of Y. pestis transmitted by groups of fleas by the two modes of transmission was also determined. O. montana readily developed complete proventricular blockage, and large numbers of Y. pestis were transmitted by that mechanism both by it and by X. cheopis, a flea known to block at a high rate. In contrast, few bacteria were transmitted in the early phase by either species. A model system incorporating standardized experimental conditions and viability controls was developed to more reliably compare the infection, proventricular blockage and transmission dynamics of different flea vectors, and was used to resolve a long-standing uncertainty concerning the vector competence of O. montana. Both X. cheopis and O. montana are fully capable of transmitting Y. pestis by the proventricular biofilm-dependent mechanism...|$|R
