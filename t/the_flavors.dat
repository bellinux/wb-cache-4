5|$|Breaking the day's fasting {{traditionally}} {{begins with}} the brief consumption of dates and a chilled beverage. Palestinians make a variety of fruit-based beverages, including <b>the</b> <b>flavors,</b> tamar Hindi or tamarind, sous or licorice, kharroub or carob and Qamar Eddine. Tamar Hindi is made by soaking tamarinds in water for many hours, then straining, sweetening and mixing it with rose water and lemon juice. Kharroub is made similarly except instead of tamarind, carob is used. Qamar Eddine is made of dried apricots boiled into a liquid and chilled.|$|E
5|$|Winemakers in New Zealand and Chile {{harvest the}} grapes at various {{intervals}} {{for the different}} blending characteristics that the grape can impart depending on its ripeness levels. At its most unripe stage, the grape is high in malic acid. As it progresses further towards ripeness the grape develops red & green pepper flavors and eventually achieves a balance of sugars. <b>The</b> <b>flavors</b> characteristic of Sauvignon blanc come from the chemicals methoxypyrazines. Grapes grown in Marlborough's Wairau Valley may exhibit different levels of ripeness over the vineyard, caused by slight unevenness in the land and giving a similar flavor profile to the resulting wine.|$|E
5|$|Clam dip is {{typically}} prepared using chopped or minced clams, sour cream or cream cheese, and various seasonings, and usually served chilled. It {{is used as}} a dip for potato chips, bread, crackers, and crudités. It has a creamy texture and mouthfeel. Canned, cooked, and frozen or fresh clams may be used, the latter of which can be cooked by steaming or pan cooking. Canned clams can be drained, or the liquid can be retained and used as an ingredient. After refrigeration, the dip may thicken, and the liquid from canned clams can be used to thin the dip. Milk or cream is also sometimes used to thin clam dip. When refrigerated overnight, <b>the</b> <b>flavors</b> of the ingredients intermingle more greatly, resulting in a more flavorful dip. Smoked clams are sometimes used, which imbues a distinct smoky flavor to the dip. The clams can be smoked in the shell and then minced afterward.|$|E

5|$|The {{different}} styles of Cabernet Sauvignon from different regions can also influence how well the wine matches up with certain foods. Old World wines, such as Bordeaux, have earthier influences and will pair better with mushrooms. Wines from cooler climates that have noticeable vegetal notes can be balanced with vegetables and greens. New World wines, with bolder fruit flavors that may even be perceived as sweet, will pair well with bolder dishes that have lots of different flavor influences. While Cabernet Sauvignon {{has the potential to}} pair well with bitter dark chocolate, it will not pair well with sweeter styles such as milk chocolate. The wine can typically pair well with a variety of cheeses, such as Cheddar, mozzarella and Brie, but full flavored or blue cheeses will typically compete too much with <b>the</b> <b>flavors</b> of Cabernet Sauvignon to be a complementary pairing.|$|E

At restaurants sommeliers will often recommend food and wine pairings for Amarone with hearty, heavy dishes such as meat roasts. A classic after-dinner assortment is Amarone paired with walnuts and Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.

25|$|The Chardonnay grape {{itself is}} very neutral, {{with many of}} <b>the</b> <b>flavors</b> {{commonly}} associated with the grape being derived from such influences as terroir and oak. It is vinified in many different styles, from the lean, crisply mineral wines of Chablis, France, to New World wines with oak, and tropical fruit flavors. In cool climates (such as Chablis and the Carneros AVA of California), Chardonnay tends to be medium to light body with noticeable acidity and flavors of green plum, apple, and pear. In warmer locations (such as the Adelaide Hills and Mornington Peninsula in Australia and Gisborne and Marlborough region of New Zealand), <b>the</b> <b>flavors</b> become more citrus, peach, and melon, while in very warm locations (such as the Central Coast AVA of California), more fig and tropical fruit notes such as banana and mango come out.

In this report we analyze the definition of <b>the</b> <b>flavor</b> charges in <b>the</b> canonical formalism for interacting (Dirac) neutrinos with mixing. On this basis, we study <b>the</b> <b>flavor</b> states for mixed neutrinos in the QFT formalism [1]-[7] and in the Pontecorvo formalism [8]-[11]. We show that Pontecorvo mixed states are not eigenstates of <b>the</b> neutrino <b>flavor</b> charges and we estimate how much the leptonic charge is violated on these states. A realistic description of flavor neutrinos starts by {{taking into account the}} (charged current) weak interaction processes in which they are created, together with their charged lepton counterparts.

Of particular importance is the balance of acidity versus the sweetness of the wine (the leftover residual sugar) and the more bitter components of the wine (most notably tannins but also includes other phenolics). A wine with too much acidity will taste excessively sour and sharp. A wine with too little acidity will taste flabby and flat, with less defined flavors.|$|E
25|$|A wine fault or defect is an {{unpleasant}} {{characteristic of a}} wine often resulting from poor winemaking practices or storage conditions, and leading to wine spoilage. Many of the compounds that cause wine faults are already naturally present in wine but at insufficient concentrations to adversely affect it.

However, when the concentration of these compounds greatly exceeds the sensory threshold, they replace or obscure <b>the</b> <b>flavors</b> and aromas that the wine should be expressing (or that the winemaker wants the wine to express).

25|$|In the vineyard, the {{antepenultimate}} {{event is}} the harvest {{in which the}} grapes are removed from the vine and transported to the winery to begin the wine making process. In the Northern Hemisphere this is generally between September and October while in the Southern Hemisphere it is generally between February and April. The time of harvest depends {{on a variety of}} factors-most notably the subjective determination of ripeness. As the grape ripens on the vines, sugars and pH increase as acids (such as malic acid) decrease. Tannins and other phenolics also develop which can affect <b>the</b> <b>flavors</b> and aromas in the resulting wine. The threat of detrimental weather and vine diseases (such as grey rot) can also {{play a role in the}} time table.
