5|$|Following the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War, Holloway made short propaganda films on behalf of the British Film Institute and Pathé News and took character parts in a series of war films including Major Barbara, The Way Ahead, <b>This</b> <b>Happy</b> Breed and The Way to the Stars. After the war, he appeared in the film Brief Encounter and made a series of films for Ealing Studios, including Passport to Pimlico, The Lavender Hill Mob and The Titfield Thunderbolt.|$|E
5|$|Coward's most {{enduring}} {{work from the}} war years was the hugely successful black comedy Blithe Spirit (1941), about a novelist who researches the occult and hires a medium. A séance brings back the ghost of his first wife, causing havoc for the novelist and his second wife. With 1,997 consecutive performances, it broke box-office records for the run of a West End comedy, and was also produced on Broadway, where its original run was 650 performances. The play was adapted into a 1945 film, directed by Lean. Coward toured during 1942 in Blithe Spirit, alternating the piece with his comedy Present Laughter and his working-class drama <b>This</b> <b>Happy</b> Breed.|$|E
5|$|In 1955 Coward's cabaret act at Las Vegas, {{recorded}} {{live for}} the gramophone, and released as Noël Coward at Las Vegas was so successful that CBS engaged him to write and direct {{a series of three}} 90-minute television specials for the 1955–56 season. The first of these, Together With Music, paired Coward with Mary Martin, featuring him in many of the numbers from his Las Vegas act. It was followed by productions of Blithe Spirit in which he starred with Claudette Colbert, Lauren Bacall and Mildred Natwick and <b>This</b> <b>Happy</b> Breed with Edna Best and Roger Moore. Despite excellent reviews, the audience viewing figures were moderate.|$|E

5|$|In a subplot, Bart and Lisa {{stay at the}} Springfield Retirement Castle with Grandpa, {{and they}} {{discover}} a metal detector in his closet. While Bart uses it to look for pirate treasure, they uncover an alternate ending to Casablanca. After playing the scene on a projector screen {{it turns out to}} be a very sanitized and typical Hollywood happy end, where Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman marry in the end. Bart, Lisa and Granpa all like it but one of the spectators, The Old Jewish Man, reveals that he was once a studio executive and actually tried to include <b>this</b> <b>happy</b> ending to the film. Ashamed and disgruntled, he pays Bart and Lisa to re-bury the film reel, giving them another film reel to bury along with it, titled It's A Wonderful Life (Killing Spree Ending).|$|E

25|$|In 1656 he {{returned}} to Amsterdam to live, where his second son Christophe was born, and in 1659, he was appointed tutor to the young Prince William III of Orange, who later became King of England. During <b>this</b> <b>happy</b> period, two more children were born, and Chappuzeau witnessed the festivities on the event of the Restoration of the English Monarchy, addressing an ode to the new King on board the Royal Charles. Unfortunately, this appointment {{came to an end}} after the death of Mary Stuart, Princess of Orange, William's mother.|$|E

25|$|In 1711, while {{traveling}} in northern Europe, the Russian Tsar Peter the Great stopped in Hanover and met Leibniz, who then took {{some interest in}} Russian matters {{for the rest of}} his life. In 1712, Leibniz began a two-year residence in Vienna, where he was appointed Imperial Court Councillor to the Habsburgs. On the death of Queen Anne in 1714, Elector George Louis became King George I of Great Britain, under the terms of the 1701 Act of Settlement. Even though Leibniz had done much to bring about <b>this</b> <b>happy</b> event, it was not to be his hour of glory. Despite the intercession of the Princess of Wales, Caroline of Ansbach, George I forbade Leibniz to join him in London until he completed at least one volume of the history of the Brunswick family his father had commissioned nearly 30 years earlier. Moreover, for George I to include Leibniz in his London court would have been deemed insulting to Newton, who was seen as having won the calculus priority dispute and whose standing in British official circles could not have been higher. Finally, his dear friend and defender, the Dowager Electress Sophia, died in 1714.|$|E
25|$|In Sicilia, Leontes {{is still}} in mourning. Cleomenes and Dion plead with him to end his time of repentance because the kingdom needs an heir. Paulina, however, convinces the king to {{continue}} his penance until she alone finds him a wife. Florizel and Perdita arrive, and they are greeted effusively by Leontes. Florizel pretends {{to be on a}} diplomatic mission from his father, but his cover is blown when Polixenes and Camillo, too, arrive in Sicilia. The meeting and reconciliation of the kings and princes is reported by gentlemen of the Sicilian court: how the Old Shepherd raised Perdita, how Antigonus met his end, how Leontes was overjoyed at being reunited with his daughter, and how he begged Polixenes for forgiveness. The Old Shepherd and Young Shepherd, now made gentlemen by the kings, meet Autolycus, who asks them for their forgiveness for his roguery. Leontes, Polixenes, Camillo, Florizel and Perdita then go to Paulina's house in the country, where a statue of Hermione has been recently finished. The sight of his wife's form makes Leontes distraught, but then, to everyone's amazement, the statue shows signs of vitality; it is Hermione, restored to life. As the play ends, Perdita and Florizel are engaged, and the whole company celebrates the miracle. Despite <b>this</b> <b>happy</b> ending typical of Shakespeare's comedies and romances, the impression of the unjust death of young prince Mamillius lingers to the end, being an element of unredeemed tragedy, in addition to the years wasted in separation.|$|E
500|$|In October 2013, it was {{revealed}} on-screen that Dylan {{is in fact the}} long-lost son of Nikki Newman (Melody Thomas Scott). Scott had previously previewed her upcoming storyline in an interview with On-Air On-Soaps, stating: [...] "I love this story! Now, I don’t know how it’s all going to turn out, but the premise, the people I get to work with, and the writing, has been spectacular.

500|$|In 1933 Coward wrote, {{directed}} and co-starred with the French singer Yvonne Printemps in both London and New York productions of an operetta, Conversation Piece (1933). He next wrote, {{directed and}} co-starred with Lawrence in [...] (1936), {{a cycle of}} ten short plays, presented in various permutations across three evenings. One of these plays, Still Life, was expanded into the 1945 David Lean film Brief Encounter. Tonight at 8:30 {{was followed by a}} musical, Operette (1938), from which the most famous number is [...] "The Stately Homes of England", and a revue entitled Set to Music (1938, a Broadway version of his 1932 London revue, Words and Music). Coward's last pre-war plays were <b>This</b> <b>Happy</b> Breed, a drama about a working-class family, and Present Laughter, a comic self-caricature with an egomaniac actor as the central character. These were first performed in 1942, although they were both written in 1939.|$|E
500|$|The Prince Regent was prostrated with grief, and {{was unable}} to attend his child's funeral. [...] Princess Caroline heard the news from a passing courier, and fainted in shock. [...] On recovering, she stated, [...] "England, that great country, has lost {{everything}} in losing my ever beloved daughter." [...] Even the Prince of Orange burst into tears at hearing the news, and his wife ordered the ladies of her court into mourning. [...] The greatest effect fell on Prince Leopold. [...] Stockmar wrote years later, [...] "November saw the ruin of <b>this</b> <b>happy</b> home, and the destruction at one blow of every hope and happiness of Prince Leopold.

500|$|George was keen to {{participate}} in the war against France in Flanders, but his father refused permission for him to join the army in an active role until he had a son and heir. In early 1707, George's hopes were fulfilled when Caroline gave birth to a son, Frederick. In July, Caroline fell seriously ill with smallpox, and George caught the infection after staying by her side devotedly during her illness. They both recovered. In 1708, George participated in the Battle of Oudenarde in the vanguard of the Hanoverian cavalry; his horse and a colonel immediately beside him were killed, but George survived unharmed. The British commander, Marlborough, wrote that George [...] "distinguished himself extremely, charging at the head of and animating by his example [...] troops, who played a good part in <b>this</b> <b>happy</b> victory". Between 1709 and 1713, George and Caroline had three more children, all girls: Anne, Amelia, and Caroline.|$|E
500|$|Coward's {{political}} views were conservative, but not unswervingly so: he despised {{the government of}} Neville Chamberlain for its policy of appeasing Nazi Germany, and he differed sharply with Winston Churchill over the abdication crisis of 1936. Whereas Churchill supported Edward VIII's wish to marry [...] "his cutie", Wallis Simpson, Coward thought the king irresponsible, telling Churchill, [...] "England doesn't wish for a Queen Cutie." [...] Coward disliked propaganda in plays; [...] "The theatre is a wonderful place, a house of strange enchantment, a temple of illusion. What it most emphatically is not {{and never will be}} is a scruffy, ill-lit, fumed-oak drill hall serving as a temporary soap box for political propaganda." [...] Nevertheless, his own views sometimes surfaced in his plays: both Cavalcade and <b>This</b> <b>Happy</b> Breed are, {{in the words of the}} playwright David Edgar, [...] "overtly Conservative political plays written in the Brechtian epic manner." [...] In religion, Coward was agnostic. He wrote of his views, [...] "Do I believe in God? I can't say No and I can't say Yes, To me it's anybody's guess." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1941 Holloway took a {{character}} part in Gabriel Pascal's film of Bernard Shaw's Major Barbara, {{in which he}} played a policeman. He had leading parts in later films, including The Way Ahead (1944), <b>This</b> <b>Happy</b> Breed (1944) and The Way to the Stars (1945). [...] After the war, he played Albert Godby in Brief Encounter and had a cameo role as the First Gravedigger in Laurence Olivier's 1948 film of Hamlet. In 1951 Holloway played the same role on the stage to the Hamlet of Alec Guinness. For Pathé News, he delivered the commentary for documentaries in a series called Time To Remember, where he narrated over old newsreels from significant dates in history from 1915 to 1942. [...] Holloway also starred {{in a series of}} films for Ealing Studios, beginning with Champagne Charlie in 1944 alongside Tommy Trinder. After that he made Nicholas Nickleby (1947) and Another Shore (1948). [...] He next appeared in three of the most famous Ealing Comedies, Passport to Pimlico (1949), The Lavender Hill Mob (1951) and The Titfield Thunderbolt (1953).

2500|$|Philip Gossett {{provides}} {{an explanation for}} the change made to the Venice score, which includes <b>this</b> <b>happy</b> ending: it is [...] "to remove the horror of the historical catastrophe" [...] and, therefore, Rossini instructed a copyist to end the opera using the rondo, [...] "", from his La donna del lago of 1819, thus removing Maometto's final confrontation with Anna, his discovery of her marriage to Calbo, and her suicide. This version also includes music from Bianca e Falliero. In 1823 and 1824, Maometto II was presented in Vienna and in Milan and then in Lisbon in 1826, but after that it dropped out of sight.|$|E
