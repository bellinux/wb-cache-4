5|$|If {{traditional}} Hunanese customs were adhered to, the baby's {{head would}} have been shaved after four weeks, with a small tuft of hair left on the crown and {{at the nape of}} the neck; it was at <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> child {{would have been}} officially given its name. According to tradition, visitors probably would have gathered for this ceremony, bringing gifts of money, pork, fish, fruit, and decorated eggs.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, Neighbours {{suffered}} a significant decline in ratings and plans {{were made to}} take the series into a 'back to basics' approach where storylines would become less controversial {{and return to the}} focus on relationships and family dynamics. It was at <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> character of Declan was created and actress Jane Hall would play his on-screen mother Rebecca Napier. The characters were to create a family unit for then, already existing character Oliver Barnes (David Hoflin).|$|E
5|$|In Vienna Brand {{was given}} a German {{passport}} {{in the name of}} Eugen Band. He cabled the Jewish Agency in Istanbul to say he was on his way, and arrived by German diplomatic plane on 19 May.

50|$|A first {{rebuttal}} to <b>this</b> <b>point</b> suggests <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Lo {{phase of}} the rafts is more tightly packed due to the intermolecular hydrogen bonding exhibited between sphingolipids and cholesterol that is not seen elsewhere.|$|R
5|$|It was at <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Non-Intervention Committee {{was created}} to uphold the agreement, but the double-dealing of the USSR and Germany had already become apparent. It also removed {{the need for a}} {{declaration}} of neutrality (which would have granted the Nationalists and Republicans control over neutrals in the areas they controlled), and had little legal standing. In Britain, part of the reasoning was based on an exaggerated belief in Germany's and Italy's preparedness for war.|$|E
5|$|White was {{associated}} with another high profile case, Kitzmiller v. Williams, which involved the belligerent rights of former Confederate soldiers. The case was on appeal from the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia, and White argued the case before the United States Supreme Court, securing a favorable verdict. The case was significant as even though hundreds of similar cases had been previously fought, {{it was not until}} <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> rights of former Confederate soldiers were recognized.|$|E
5|$|Glenn Hughes and Joe Bonamassa {{first met}} at the 2006 NAMM Show in Anaheim, California, after which they jammed {{together}} at Hughes's studio in Hollywood with the idea to make music together in the future. Bonamassa also worked with Jason Bonham that year, when the drummer performed on the guitarist's fifth studio album You & Me {{on the recommendation of}} producer and mutual friend Kevin Shirley. Hughes and Bonamassa reunited three years later in November 2009, performing together at the House of Blues in Los Angeles for Guitar Center. It was at <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> two decided to form a band. The idea of enlisting Bonham and keyboardist Derek Sherinian to complete the band's lineup was suggested by Shirley, after a second guitarist was briefly considered instead of a keyboardist.|$|E

5|$|It was at <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{team had}} yet another stroke of luck. Bowen's former thesis advisor at King's College, London, was Edward Appleton, {{who had worked}} with Watt and Harold Pye during the 1920s. Pye had since gone on to form his own radio company, Pye Ltd., and was active in the {{television}} field. They had recently introduced a new television set based on an innovative vacuum tube developed by Philips of Holland, the EF50 pentode. Appleton mentioned the Pye design to Bowen, who found it to be a great improvement over the EMI version, and was happy to learn there had been a small production run {{that could be used for}} their experiments. The design became widely known as the Pye strip.|$|E
5|$|Towing two scows at {{the time}} of the collision, Stella Maris responded {{immediately}} to the fire, anchoring the barges and steaming back towards Pier 6. The tug's captain, Horatio H. Brannen, and his crew realized they were not equipped to fight the fire with their one small hose and quickly backed off from the burning Mont Blanc. They were approached by a whaler from HMS Highflyer and later a steam pinnace belonging to HMCS Niobe. Captain Brannen and Albert Mattison of Niobe agreed to secure a line to the French ship's stern so as to pull it away from the pier to avoid setting it on fire. The five-inch (127-millimetre) hawser initially produced was deemed too small and orders for a ten-inch (254-millimetre) hawser came down. It was at <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> blast occurred.|$|E
5|$|Non-intervention, {{and with}} it the Non-Intervention Agreement, had been {{proposed}} in a joint diplomatic initiative by the governments of France and the United Kingdom, in order to prevent the war from escalating into a major pan-European conflict. On 4 August 1936, non-intervention was put to Nazi Germany by the French. The German position was that such a declaration was not needed, but discussions could be held on preventing the spread of the war to the rest of Europe, so long as the USSR was present. It was mentioned at that meeting that Germany was already supplying the Nationalists. On 9 August, the Germans informed the British that 'no war materials had been sent from Germany and none will', which was blatantly false. One German Junker aircraft was captured when it came down in Republican territory. Its release would be required before Germany signed the Non-Intervention Pact. There was a growing belief that countries would not abide by the agreement anyway. Admiral Erich Raeder urged the German government to either back the Nationalists more completely, and bring Europe to the brink of war, or abandon them. On the 24th, Germany signed. It was at <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Non-Intervention Committee was created to uphold the agreement, but the double-dealing of the USSR and Germany had already become apparent. Germany consistently broke the agreement they had signed.|$|E

At 5:05 A.M. it managed {{to attach a}} specially designed toggle and polypropylene tow rope to the rear sphere of Pisces III. At 10:35 A.M. the CURV-III managed to fix another rope to the submersible. It was at <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> crew ate and drank the only sustenance aboard.|$|E
25|$|In 2010 DFDS {{acquired}} Norfolkline from Maersk. Following restructuring, {{the operations}} of DFDS Tor Line, DFDS Lisco and Norfolkline were integrated into DFDS Seaways. The merger led to changes and additions to freight destinations and an expansion in freight volumes. It is at <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> historic Tor Line ceased to exist as a brand and entity, though its contributions to the legacy of North Sea and Baltic Sea maritime shipping remains.|$|E
25|$|Not long afterwards, Agesilaus {{mounted a}} second {{expedition}} against Thebes. After {{a series of}} skirmishes which he won with some difficulty, he was forced again to withdraw when the Theban army came out full force {{as he approached the}} city. Diodorus observes at <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Thebans thereafter faced the Spartans with confidence. Gorgidas disappears from history between 377 and 375, during which the command of the Sacred Band was apparently transferred to Pelopidas.|$|E

25|$|Prototype {{construction}} of the Metro began in 1968 and the first flight was on August 26, 1969. Swearingen Aircraft encountered financial difficulties at this stage, and late in 1971 Fairchild (which was marketing the Metro and building its wings and engine nacelles), bought 90% of Swearingen and the company was renamed Swearingen Aviation Corporation. It was at <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> previously cash-strapped company {{was able to put}} the Metro into production.|$|E
25|$|Up Masons Hill {{the road}} reaches Bromley Common, the first {{large-scale}} open space negotiated; briefly, just before Farnborough, the road becomes Hastings Road. The original A21 went though the suburb, the High Street {{is now the}} B2158. Until now the road {{has been in a}} south-easterly direction, but after Green Street Green it turns eastwards towards the valley of the River Darent, and it is at <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> road pattern makes a complete change from its original route.|$|E
25|$|The initial {{format of}} the slides was 6cmx6cm as all Haskins' medium format images at that point had been shot on Hasselblad and Rolleiflex.

25|$|In {{the late}} summer and autumn of 1814, Severn was an {{important}} participant in the War of 1812, as she was stationed in Chesapeake Bay to blockade the Patuxent River.

On 2 July Severn and Loire captured two schooners, two gun-boats, and a sloop. They also destroyed a large store of tobacco.|$|E
25|$|The {{organization}} subsequently {{relocated to}} Geneva in 1960, and was succeeded in 1967 {{with the establishment}} of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) by treaty as an agency of the United Nations. According to Lemley, it was only at <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> term really began {{to be used in the}} United States (which had not been a party to the Berne Convention), and it did not enter popular usage there until passage of the Bayh-Dole Act in 1980.|$|E
25|$|The BFS {{went through}} further changes in 1967, {{when it was}} {{established}} as a permanent Civil Service organisation. Its role changed again in 1972 following the signature of the Treaty on the Basis of Relations between East and West Germany, when the two states agreed to recognise each other. The British government took the view at <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> United Kingdom was no longer responsible for the inner German border and considered eliminating the BFS altogether. However, {{it was decided that}} it would continue to have a very limited role on the border, chiefly involving conducting liaison with the German border agencies. It was reduced to 16 members with only the British Frontier Post at Helmstedt, manned by four personnel, remaining open. The BFS was finally dissolved on 28 May 1991, following the reunification of Germany.|$|E
