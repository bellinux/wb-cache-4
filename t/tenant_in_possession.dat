40|$|Issues {{of housing}} are {{becoming}} very {{important as the}} urban population grows at a very rapid rate, particularly in developing countries. The {{number of people who}} are homeless and those living in substandard housing in Zambia is enormous. A home ownership programme through the sale of public rental housing to sitting tenants was seen as one of the strategies under the 1996 National Housing Policy aimed at solving the housing crisis in the country especially among the low-income groups. There are indications that although some people benefited through this scheme, the problem of inadequate housing has persisted. This study is aimed at exploring the effects of Zambia’s home ownership scheme in helping the low income men and women realize their housing rights. This was achieved by finding out the main reasons for the sale of public rental houses; determining the eligibility criteria as well as how affordable the houses were. Other research questions were to assess whether ownership of houses had helped people improve their houses and their economic status; and how home ownership has affected people’s lives in different dimensions. The theoretical perspective used in this study is based on alternative development and Gender and Development (GA) under which the concepts of house/home as well as empowerment and rights were used as a basis for analyzing the findings of this study. A qualitative methodology comprising in-depth interviews, group discussions and simple observation was employed in order to gain a deep understanding of the impact of the scheme from both house owners and officials at implementation level. The study found that houses were sold in order to: fulfill economic policies of privatization and Structural Adjustment Programmes (SAPs); detach housing provision from employment; and empower the low income to improve their poverty situation. To qualify for the purchase of houses, a legal <b>tenant</b> <b>in</b> <b>possession</b> of tenancy card needed to be a Zambian citizen. The cost of houses were considerably low, and many people bought their houses but a number of people were evicted as they could not afford due to economic hardships and malpractices in the process. Some of those who bought face a challenge in maintaining houses and paying land rates. The privatization of housing had both positive and negative effects on the poor. The different ways in which home ownership impacted on the people’s lives ranged from simply provision of shelter to economic, social and psychological aspects. Some house owners’ economic status or security have improved to some extent due to ownership of a house as an asset as they are now able to make savings, resale the house, sublet it or trade at home. ﻿Ownership of houses has also enhanced people’s feeling of belonging, stability and personal security. As a result people are able to organize themselves and work collectively in order to improve their neighbourhoods. However, some people were denied their rights hence became disempowered as they could not afford the purchase of their houses. Financial instability put most poor people at the risk of losing their houses as they are already defaulting in rates and fail to maintain them. There were no measures put in place to help the poor realize their housing rights by protecting them from evictions and ensure that they acquire decent housing. Therefore, the housing did not provide a sustainable solution to economic insecurity neither did it lead to meaningful economic empowerment as people did not participate in the decision-making process. </p...|$|E

50|$|During the American Revolution, the Commonwealth of Virginia enacted {{legislation}} that {{allowed it to}} confiscate Loyalists' property. Here, the original suit was an action of ejectment brought in Virginia state court for the recovery {{of land in the}} state known as the Northern Neck Proprietary. A declaration in ejectment was served in April 1791 on the <b>tenants</b> <b>in</b> <b>possession</b> of the land. Denny Fairfax (late Denny Martin) was a British subject who held the land under the devise of Lord Thomas Fairfax. Denny Martin was admitted to defend the suit and plead the general issue upon the usual terms of confessing lease, entry, and ouster. Martin agreed to assert only claim to the title. The facts being settled {{in the form of a}} case agreed to be taken and considered as a special verdict, the court, on consideration thereof, gave judgment in favor of the defendant in ejectment on April 24, 1794.

The landlord may evict such a tenant at any time, and without notice.|$|R
5000|$|A fee tail {{can still}} exist in England and Wales as an {{equitable}} interest, behind a strict settlement; the legal estate is vested {{in the current}} 'tenant for life' or other person immediately entitled to the income, but {{on the basis that}} any capital money arising must be paid to the settlement trustees. A <b>tenant</b> <b>in</b> tail <b>in</b> <b>possession</b> can bar his fee tail by a simple disentailing deed, which does not now have to be enrolled. A <b>tenant</b> <b>in</b> tail in reversion (i.e. a future interest where the property is subject to prior life interest) needs the consent of the life tenant and any 'special protectors' to vest a reversionary fee simple in himself. Otherwise he can only create a base fee; a base fee only confers a right to the property on its owner, when its creator would have become entitled to it; if its creator dies before he would have received it, the owner of the base fee gets nothing.

50|$|The {{first is}} to put the <b>tenant</b> <b>in</b> {{physical}} <b>possession</b> of the land {{at the outset of the}} lease (the English and majority rule, as opposed to the American rule which only requires the tenant be given legal possession, or the right to possess); the second is to provide the premises in a habitable condition—there is an implied warranty of habitability. If landlord violates either, the tenant can terminate the lease and move out, or stay on the premises, while continuing to pay rent, and sue the landlord for damages (or withhold rent and use breach of implied warranty of habitability as a defense when the landlord attempts to collect rent).|$|R

50|$|If {{the tenant}} does not file an answer or appear in court, the {{landlord}} can then request a default judgment {{and win the}} lawsuit automatically, being awarded possession of the property, rent in arrears, court costs, and other costs where allowed by law such as attorney's fees or reimbursement for other costs incurred by the tenant (such as to repair property damage or unpaid utilities). By filing an answer or appearing <b>in</b> court, the <b>tenant</b> may state his or {{her side of the}} story, and provide affirmative defenses, such as the landlord not giving proper notice to vacate or that rent was paid.

50|$|A {{tenancy at sufferance}} {{is created}} when a tenant wrongfully holds over past {{the end of the}} {{duration}} period of the tenancy (for example, a tenant who stays past the expiration of his or her lease). In this case, the landlord can hold over the tenant to a new tenancy, and collect rent for the period the tenant has held over.A tenancy at sufferance (sometimes called a holdover tenancy) may exist when a <b>tenant</b> remains <b>in</b> <b>possession</b> of property even {{after the end of the}} lease, until the landlord acts to eject the tenant. The occupant may legally be a trespasser at this point, and the possession of this type may not be a true estate in land, even if authorities recognize the condition to hold the tenant liable for rent. The landlord may be able to evict such tenant at any time, without notice. Action to evict will terminate a tenancy at sufferance, because the tenant no longer enjoys possession. Some jurisdictions impose an irrevocable election whereby the landlord treats the holdover as either a trespasser, or as a tenant at sufferance. A trespasser is not in possession; but a tenant at sufferance continues to enjoy possession of the real property.|$|R

50|$|In law, a {{base fee}} is a {{freehold}} {{estate of inheritance}} which is limited or qualified by the existence of certain conditions.

Any attempt to bar the entail without the consent of the Protector would only be partially successful. Though he bars his own issue (the rights of the future <b>tenants</b> <b>in</b> tail), he cannot bar any remainder or reversion, and the estate (i.e. the base fee) thus created is determinable on the failure of his issue in tail.
