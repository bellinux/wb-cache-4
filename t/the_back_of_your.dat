Chris Carter said [...] "I had to speak with Bill several times; I spent hours with him on the telephone talking about the character, because the actor felt that the episode really made the character something that it wasn't.

Another person will hold your ankles with the hands only. No other method of bracing or holding the feet is authorized. The heel is the only part <b>of</b> <b>your</b> foot that must stay in contact with the ground.

On the command [...] "go," [...] begin raising your upper body forward to, or beyond, the vertical position.

After you have reached or surpassed the vertical position, lower your body until the bottom <b>of</b> <b>your</b> shoulder blades touch the ground. Your head, hands, arms, or elbows do not have to touch the ground. At the end of each repetition, the scorer will state the number of sit-ups you have correctly completed. A repetition will not count if you fail to reach the vertical position, fail to keep your fingers interlocked behind your head, arch or bow your back and raise your buttocks off the ground to raise your upper body, or let your knees exceed a 90-degree angle. If a repetition does not count, the scorer will repeat the number <b>of</b> <b>your</b> last correctly performed sit-up. The up position is the only authorized rest position. If you stop and rest in the down (starting) position, the event will be terminated. As long as you make a continuous physical effort to sit up, the event will not be terminated. You may not use your hands or any other means to pull or push yourself up to the up (resting) position or to hold yourself in the rest position. If you do so, your performance in the event will be terminated. Correct performance is important. You will have two minutes to perform as many sit-ups as you can.".|$|R

There's a little of each of them in her voice" [...] also stating [...] "In the course of each song she let her voice rise in anger, contempt or passion". Jen Crothers of Green Left Weekly, in a review of Garbage, remarked that [...] "Manson, vocalist and guitarist, has a powerful voice, which soars and dips like a bird. It can plead or demand. It can sound dreamy or psychotic." [...] Reviewing a 2012 live Garbage performance, Catherine Gee of The Daily Telegraph noted that Manson [...] "remains a striking performer whose distinctive contralto snarl can still raise the hairs on <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> neck." [...] In a review of Garbage, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic described Manson's voice as [...] "thin and airy", whilst Mike Diver of the BBC stated Manson owned [...] "a snarl in her voice but [...] equally capable of a purr to melt away any resistance."

Steve Malins of Vox {{also liked the}} album. He said, [...] "The title-track is a sublime melodrama recalling the experimentation of Peepshow and 1982's Kiss in the Dreamhouse", [...] before concluding with this sentence, [...] "The Rapture represents an intelligent twist on familiar Banshees obsessions". Liz Buckley of Sun Zoom Spark also praised it, writing, [...] "How is a band that first formed almost two decades ago able to remain both vital and celebrated? Answer: Metamorphosis". Buckley also declared that [...] "the album is able to excite the hairs on <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> neck". Select gave it a 4-star rating, hailing the band as [...] "purveyors of scary pop par excellence".

[...] The reviewer characterized The Rapture as a [...] "fine little Russian doll of a record", and said, [...] "Under the keyboard lines, swelling strings and OTT percussion, at the centre of every song is a nugget of disquiet that keeps you listening again and again".|$|E
2500|$|The band {{returned}} to Rock's Plantation Studios in Hawaii in May 2003 {{to begin the}} first recording sessions for the album. Their intention was to record an album even more simplified than Gravity and even closer in sound to what they sounded like live, an overall different record. [...] "I think we all knew going into it {{that it was an}} important record for us," [...] said Duncan Coutts. [...] "I think that when you get more than ten years into a band, It has to be a rebirth for us. We didn't want to go and remake any of our past records." [...] In one month, they recorded 12 songs live off the floor, most in two or three takes each. Following these sessions, several of the songs including [...] "Walking in Circles", [...] "No Warning" [...] and [...] "Wipe That Smile Off your Face" [...] were premiered live. After touring concluded for the year, the band was set to finish the album that October in time for a January 2004 release. While satisfied with the recorded material at first, with time the band became more critical of it and decided they would only be demos. They felt strongly about the songs [...] "Picture", [...] "Will the Future Blame Us?" [...] and [...] "Angels/Losing/Sleep" [...] but felt {{that the rest of the}} songs didn't live up to them. [...] "Even though we loved the energy of what we'd done, not enough of the songs were making the hair stand up on <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> neck and so we realized that we needed to do more work," [...] bass player Duncan Coutts explained.
