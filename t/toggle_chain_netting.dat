40|$|The {{off bottom}} trawl net {{commonly}} called Sea slater <b>Net</b> or <b>chain</b> <b>net</b> is a newly deviced fishing net supplied with a fishing {{line to the}} lower side of which are attached a series of both bouys and hanging chains; when this is put under operation this fishing line is to be drawn, detouched more or less off the sea bottom. The possibility of its practicality has been proved by the repeated towing tests carried out on board the training ship. Basing on {{the assessment of the}} results obtained from (1) the 4 times drawing tests performed by the 2 training ship on the East China Sea in 1982 (2) the 25 times fishering tests carried out by the trawler No. 37 DAIKICHI MARU on the Bering Sea (3) the model tests carried out in the water tank the following concluusions were fixed concering its practicality. (1) Fishing Capacity : The value of the Catch Per Unit Effort of the <b>chain</b> <b>net</b> was equivalent to 47 ~ 82 % of that of the regular net. Even put under a statical assessment, in the fish composition of the caught fish an obvious distinction was noted between the <b>chain</b> <b>net</b> and the regular net; the usefulness of the <b>chain</b> <b>net</b> as a Fish species Selecting apparatus was ascertained. The amount of dergs and drains drawn into the net was noted to be quite negligible. (2) Gearing Capacity : In the both nets, almost no difference was noted between the height of net mouth. Concering the distance between the wing tips, that of the <b>chain</b> <b>net</b> was somewhat lager than that of regular net. The net resistance of the <b>chain</b> <b>net</b> was 15 ~ 30 % less than that of the regular net. In the case when fishing was effective, the off bottom height of the <b>chain</b> <b>net</b> was 20 ~ 40 cm in the Bering Sea, and it was 10 ~ 15 cm in the East China Sea. The proper shape of the chain which was to be fixed in accordance with its resistance against the flowing water, was sought out theoritically; the diameter of the most proper chain was assessed to be 16 mm. The slower was the towing speed, the longer the vertical past of the submerged hanging chain, which prevented fish school from running away : basing on the above mentioned fact the most proper to wing speed of the <b>chain</b> <b>net</b> was fixed to be 3 knots. 底曳網の沈子方のフィッシングラインに浮子と垂下チェーンを数多く装着し,そのラインを海底から微少高さ離底させて曳網する微離底曳網(チェーン網) については,これまで本学練習船により数多くの曳網実験が行なわれ,実用化が可能であることが証明されている。本報は,昭和 57 年,ベーリング海で行なわれた北転船,第 37 大吉丸の 25 回の漁獲試験と東支那海で行なった 2 隻の本学練習船の 4 回の曳網実験及び水槽で行なった模型実験の夫々の資料を併せて検討した結果,下記のような結論を得た。 1) 漁獲性能 : チェーン網のC・P・U・Eの値は通常網の 47 ~ 82 %に当る。両網の漁獲物の魚種組成は統計学的にみても有意差が認められ,チェーン網の選択漁法の漁具としての有効性を認めることが出来るようである。 2) 漁具性能 : 網口高さは両網ともほとんど差はない。袖先間隔はチェーン網が若干広い。チェーン網の抵抗は通常網より 15 ~ 30 %少ない。有漁獲の場合の離底の高さは,ベーリング海では 20 ~ 45 cmである。曳網中におけるチェーンの吹かれの形状を理論的に求めた結果,適正のチェーン径は 16 mm(16 φ) となる。またチェーンの吹かれを考慮すると,適正の曳網速力は 3. 5 ノット以下となる...|$|R

All retailers who buy the finished product sell the finished product on their markets. In all of these markets, the finished product in different markets has substitution each other since consumers may have opportunity to buy the finished product from different retailer and Cobb-Douglas demand function is introduced to describe this market attribute.

Having designed the Freshwater Pavilion (1994 - 97) using geometric and topological procedures, which were then materialized through the exigency of a steel structure and flexible metal sheeting, Spuybroek found in Otto a reservoir of experiments in developing curved surfaces of even greater complexity by means of a process that was already material- that was, in fact. simultaneously material, structural and geometric. Moreover. Otto 2 ̆ 7 s concem with flexible surfaces not only blurred the classic distinctions between surface and support, vault and beam (suggesting a non-elemental conception of structural functions) but also made construction and structure a function of movement or, more precisely, a function of the rigidification of soft, dynamic entities into calcified structures such as bones and shells. Philosophically inclined towards a dynamic conception of the universe - a Bergsonian and Deleuzian ontology of movement, time and duration - Spuybroek embarked on an intensive study of Otto 2 ̆ 7 s work and took up his analogical design method. A materialist of the first order, Spuybroek now developed his own experiments following those of Otto with soap bubbles, <b>chain</b> <b>nets</b> and other materials as a way to discover how complex structural behaviours find forms of their own accord, which can then be reiterated on a larger scale using tensile, cable or shell constructions...|$|R
