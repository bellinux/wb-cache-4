5|$|Populations of pest insects can {{sometimes}} be dramatically reduced by the release of sterile individuals. This involves the mass rearing of a pest, sterilising it by means of X-rays or some other means, and releasing it into a wild population. It is particularly useful where a female only mates once and where the insect does not disperse widely. This technique has been successfully used against the New World screw-worm fly, some species of <b>tsetse</b> <b>fly,</b> tropical fruit flies, the pink bollworm and the codling moth, among others.|$|E
5|$|Common elands are {{resistant}} to trypanosomiasis, a protozoan infection that has the <b>tsetse</b> <b>fly</b> as a vector, {{but not to the}} Rhipicephalus-transmitted disease theileriosis. The disease-causing bacteria Theileria taurotragi has caused many eland deaths. Clostridium chauvoei, another bacterium, can be harmful as well. Eland are also hosts to several kinds of ticks. In one study an eland was found to be host to the Amblyomma species A. gemma and A. variegatum, and Rhipicephalus species R. decoloratus, R. appendiculatus, R. evertsi, R. pulchellus and R. pravus. Elands produce antibodies for Brucella bacteria, but none for Mycobacterium paratuberculosis or various types of pneumonia like contagious bovine pneumonia and contagious caprine pneumonia, normally infectious in cows or antelopes.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} {{was carried out in}} order to {{investigate}} if there was really a failure of PCR in identifying parasitologically positive <b>tsetse</b> <b>flies</b> in the field. <b>Tsetse</b> <b>flies</b> (Glossina palpalis gambiensis and Glossina morsitans morsitans) were therefore experimentally infected with two different species of Trypanosoma (Trypanosoma brucei gambiense or Trypanosoma congolense). A total of 152 <b>tsetse</b> <b>flies</b> were dissected, and organs of each fly (midgut, proboscis or salivary glands) were examined. The positive organs were then analysed using PCR. Results showed that, regardless of the trypanosome species, PCR failed to amplify 40 % of the parasitologically positive midguts. This failure, which does not occur with diluted samples, is likely to be caused by an inhibition of the amplification reaction.

5|$|Battle {{losses of}} horses were {{approximately}} 25percent of all war-related equine deaths between 1914 and 1916. Disease and exhaustion {{accounted for the}} remainder and the Germans specifically targeted horses with gunfire. The highest death rates were in East Africa, where in 1916 alone deaths of the original mounts and remounts accounted for 290% of the initial stock numbers, mainly due to infection from the <b>tsetse</b> <b>fly.</b> On average, Britain lost about 15 percent (of the initial military stock) of its animals each year of the war (killed, missing, died or abandoned), with losses at 17 percent in the French theatre. This compared to 80 percent in the Crimean War, 120 percent in the Boer War and 10 percent in peacetime. During some periods of the war, 1,000horses per day were arriving in Europe as remounts for British troops, to replace horses lost. Some horses, having collapsed from exhaustion, drowned in ankle-deep mud, too tired to lift their heads high enough to breathe. Equine casualties were especially high during battles of attrition, such as the 1916 Battle of Verdun between French and German forces. In one day in March, 7,000 horses were killed by long-range shelling on both sides, including 97 killed by a single shot from a French naval gun. By 1917, Britain had over a million horses and mules in service, but harsh conditions, especially during winter, resulted in heavy losses, particularly amongst the Clydesdale horses, the main breed used to haul the guns. Over {{the course of the}} war, Britain lost over 484,000horses, one horse for every two men. A small number of these, 210, were killed by poison gas.|$|E

25|$|The <b>tsetse</b> <b>fly</b> (genus Glossina) is a large, brown, biting fly {{that serves}} as both a host and vector for the {{trypanosome}} parasites. While taking blood from a mammalian host, an infected <b>tsetse</b> <b>fly</b> injects metacyclic trypomastigotes into skin tissue. From the bite, parasites first enter the lymphatic system and then pass into the bloodstream. Inside the mammalian host, they transform into bloodstream trypomastigotes, and are carried to other sites throughout the body, reach other body fluids (e.g., lymph, spinal fluid), and continue to replicate by binary fission.|$|E

40|$|<b>Tsetse</b> <b>flies</b> (Glossina spp.) are a {{big problem}} in sub-Saharan Africa {{because they are the}} most common vector for trypanosomes. In this part of Africa they threat human health and limit rural {{development}} by transmitting the trypanosome parasites that cause the fatal diseases of Nagana (or AAT; African Animal Trypanosomiasis) in domestic animals and Sleeping Sickness (or HAT; Human African Trypanosomiasis) in human. Direct losses from trypanosomiasis in cattle include mortality, morbidity, decreased milk and meat production, impaired fertility and the costs of tsetse and trypanosomiasis control operations. Indirect losses include the farmers’ responses to the risk of the disease. A study on the prevalence of trypanosomes in <b>tsetse</b> <b>flies</b> was conducted from September 2010 to November 2010 in Handeni district and Ngorogoro Conservation Area, Tanzania. The fly-survey was conducted by using biconical, pyramidal and NGU traps and revealed that two tsetse species namely Glossina pallidipes and G. swynnertoni were found. The prevalence of trypanosomes in <b>tsetse</b> <b>flies</b> and the apparent density of these flies were determined. A total of 375 flies were dissected, and revealed the presence of trypanosomes in <b>tsetse</b> <b>flies</b> in these areas. The overall prevalence of trypanosomes in <b>tsetse</b> <b>flies</b> was 3. 5 %. The prevalence in Handeni district (4. 49 %) was higher then the prevalence in Ngorogoro Conservation Area (2. 73 %). Overall the results suggested that the tsetse density is low and the prevalence of trypanosomes in these <b>tsetse</b> <b>flies</b> is low in this time of year. This needs to be considered when developing area- specific strategies for future management of tsetse- transmitted animal trypanosomiasis...|$|R

There was a major outbreak covering the whole of Britain in 1865/66. Later in history, an outbreak in the 1890s killed 80 to 90% of all cattle in southern Africa, {{as well as in the}} Horn of Africa. Sir Arnold Theiler was instrumental in developing a vaccine that curbed the epizootic. More recently, a rinderpest outbreak raged across much of Africa in 1982–1984, costing at least an estimated US$500 million in stock losses. The loss of animals caused famine which depopulated subsaharan Africa, allowing thornbush to colonise. This formed ideal habitat for <b>tsetse</b> <b>fly,</b> which carries sleeping sickness.

A total of 631 <b>tsetse</b> <b>flies</b> were captured, of which 531 (84. 2 %) and 100 (15. 8 %) were analyzed for trypanosomes and blood meals, respectively. Tsetse distribution varied significantly (p< 0. 05) across study sites with average trap and daily catches of 4. 39 and 26. 34, respectively. Overall tsetse infection rate was 5. 08 % and ranged between 3. 03 % and 6. 84 % across study sites. We identified 10 T. brucei, 3 T. congolense savannah, 2 T. congolense forest, and 2 mixed infections among the 13 pools made from the 27 flies positive for trypanosomes with light microscopy. The distribution of vertebrate blood meals in <b>tsetse</b> <b>flies</b> varied significantly (p< 0. 05) and ranged between 6. 0 % and 45 % across hosts.

Although the risk of infection from a <b>tsetse</b> <b>fly</b> bite is minor (estimated at less than 0.1%), the use of insect repellants, wearing long-sleeved clothing, avoiding tsetse-dense areas, implementing bush clearance methods and wild game culling are the best options to avoid infection available for local residents of affected areas.|$|E
25|$|African trypanosomiasis, {{also known}} as {{sleeping}} sickness, is an insect-borne parasitic disease of humans and other animals. It is caused by protozoa of the species Trypanosoma brucei.
