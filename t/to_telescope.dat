25|$|On 26 November 1921, {{a serious}} {{accident}} {{occurred on the}} Midland half of New Street station, when an express from Bristol crashed into the rear of a stationary train to Derby, which was standing at platform four and had been delayed due to engine trouble. The collision caused the guards van of the Derby train <b>to</b> <b>telescope</b> with the rear coach. Three people were killed, and twenty four injured. The later inquest ruled that the express had overrun the danger signal due to driver error, and the misty conditions had made the rails moist, leading to wheelslip when the train tried to brake.|$|E
2500|$|For Bordiga, both {{stages of}} socialist or {{communist}} society (sometimes distinguished as [...] "socialism" [...] and [...] "communism") were characterised by the (gradual) absence of money, the market, and so on, {{the difference between}} them being that earlier {{in the first stage}} a system of 'rationing' would be used to allocate goods to people, while in communism this could be abandoned in favour of full free access. This view distinguished Bordiga from other Leninists, and especially the Trotskyists, who tended (and still tend) <b>to</b> <b>telescope</b> the first two stages and so have money and the other exchange categories surviving into [...] "socialism". Bordiga would have none of this. For him no society in which money, buying and selling and the rest survived could be regarded as either socialist or communist; these exchange categories would die out before the socialist rather than the communist stage was reached.|$|E

5000|$|Psychologists {{have studied}} the {{telescoping}} effect in children because a person's development can {{have a significant impact}} on his or her memory. Telescoping occurs at all ages, but to different degrees. [...] Older children have a greater tendency <b>to</b> <b>telescope</b> earlier memories and a weaker tendency <b>to</b> <b>telescope</b> recent memories than younger children. [...] Children's telescoping errors occur for their earliest memories. This finding is significant because it probably occurs for adults as well, and therefore people's earliest memories are reported as more recent than they actually are. This finding indicates that the earliest memories reported in childhood amnesia literature should be questioned because they may have occurred earlier than they are reported.|$|E

50|$|Amateur astronomers tend {{to refer}} <b>to</b> <b>telescope</b> eyepieces by their focal length in millimetres. These {{typically}} {{range from about}} 3 mm to 50 mm. Some astronomers, however, prefer to specify the resulting magnification power rather than the focal length. It is often more convenient to express magnification in observation reports, as it gives a more immediate impression of what view the observer actually saw. Due to its dependence on properties of the particular telescope in use, however, magnification power alone is meaningless for describing a telescope eyepiece.|$|E

[...] In 1946, Orla Watson, co-founder of Telescope Carts, Inc. had developed an innovative [...] "nesting" [...] shopping cart that did not require disassembly after each use like Goldman's designs, and allowed for the shopping carts <b>to</b> <b>telescope,</b> or [...] "nest" [...] together by simply shoving the carts together. [...] Goldman had patented his own [...] "Nest-Kart" [...] over a year later in 1948, so an interference investigation was ordered by Watson of Telescope Carts, Inc. for alleged patent infringement {{during the same time}} period. [...] In a compromise solution, Goldman agreed to relinquish his rights on his existing patent and agreed to pay the sum of $1 for counterfeit damages. [...] In return, Telescope Cart, Inc. agreed to an exclusive license granted to Goldman's company for the production of the telescoping, or [...] "nesting" [...] cart. The telescoping, or nesting cart, based on the patent issued to Orla Watson of Telescope Carts, Inc. forms the basis of the shopping cart designs used to the present, and all royalties for the new design were paid <b>to</b> <b>Telescope</b> Carts, Inc. until their patent expired.|$|E

Originally there were concepts to pair each of the carriage sets with a permanently coupled locomotive at the West (non-conductor) end, and to fit the East-end BCH carriages with a small driving stand for controlling the P class locomotives; but this fell through on grounds of safety and inability to stop the locomotive powering instantly {{in case of a}} collision, which would have caused the carriage set <b>to</b> <b>telescope.</b>|$|E
