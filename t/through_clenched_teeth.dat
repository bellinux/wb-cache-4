500|$|In the song, Jackson {{tells the}} media to stop {{pressuring}} him and to stop misrepresenting the truth. Jon Pareles of The New York Times observed, [...] "fear has turned to aggression. The music has polarized; it's either clipped, choppy and electronic or glossy and sumptuous, only occasionally trying to combine the two. Most of the time, Jackson sounds as if he's singing <b>through</b> <b>clenched</b> <b>teeth,</b> spitting out words in defiance of any and all persecutors". He believed that [...] "Scream" [...] had a similar sound {{to the music of}} Janet's acclaimed Rhythm Nation. It was Michael Jackson's first song that contained the word [...] "fucking" [...] in the lyrics [...] "Stop pressuring me/Stop pressuring me/Stop fucking with me"—which was thought of as an unusual choice for Jackson, considering his appeal with the younger audience. Other songs on HIStory contained words such as kike, shit, and from The Notorious B.I.G., the word [...] "nigga". [...] "Scream" [...] incorporates elements of pop, R, hip-hop, funk and rock.|$|E

60|$|The chained prisoners {{had been}} {{watching}} the combat in tense silence; not a sound had fallen in the room other than the clashing of our contending blades, the soft shuffling of our naked feet and the few whispered words we had hissed at each other <b>through</b> <b>clenched</b> <b>teeth</b> the while we continued our mortal duel.|$|E
60|$|The {{result was}} a little unexpected. The man gave a start that was almost a leap, and the pallor of his face became a sickly white. His eyes, as he swung round, met Mr Birdsey's for an instant before they dropped, and there was panic fear in them. His breath whistled softly <b>through</b> <b>clenched</b> <b>teeth.</b>|$|E
6000|$|He waited. Before {{his eyes}} the engines turned with slow labour, {{that in the}} moment of going off into a mad fling would stop dead at Mr. Rout's shout, [...] "Look out, Beale!" [...] They paused in an {{intelligent}} immobility, stilled in mid-stroke, a heavy crank arrested on the cant, as if conscious of danger and the passage of time. Then, with a [...] "Now, then!" [...] from the chief, and the sound of a breath expelled <b>through</b> <b>clenched</b> <b>teeth,</b> they would accomplish the interrupted revolution and begin another.|$|E
6000|$|... “The {{son of a}} confounded millionaire soap-boiler,” commented Mr. Blunt <b>through</b> his <b>clenched</b> <b>teeth.</b> “A man {{absolutely}} without parentage. Without {{a single}} relation in the world. Just a freak.” ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Coward, lache, poltroon, runaway!" [...] {{he hissed}} <b>through</b> his <b>clenched</b> <b>teeth,</b> {{and was about}} to make a thrust in tierce which must infallibly have been fatal, when the Princess Jaqueline, in her shape as a wasp, stung him {{fiercely}} on the wrist.|$|R
60|$|Sir Terence was no psychologist. But {{he found}} it {{difficult}} to believe in so much of self-sacrifice from a woman for a woman's sake, however dear. Therefore he held to the first alternative. To confirm it came the memory of Sylvia's words to him on the night of Tremayne's arrest. And it was to such a man that she gave the priceless treasure of her love; for such a man, and in such a sordid cause, that she sacrificed the inestimable jewel of her honour? He laughed <b>through</b> <b>clenched</b> <b>teeth</b> at a situation so bitterly ironical. Presently he would talk to her. She should realise what she had done, and he would wish her joy of it. First, however, there was something else to do. He flung himself wearily into the chair at his writing-table, took up a pen and began to write.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Pett was by {{this time}} heartily regretting the impulse which had caused her to {{telephone}} to Mr. Sturgis. In a career which had had {{more than its share}} of detectives, both real and fictitious, she had never been confronted with a detective like this. The galling thing was that she was helpless. After all, one engaged a detective for his or her shrewdness and efficiency, not for suavity and polish. A detective who hurls speech at you <b>through</b> <b>clenched</b> <b>teeth</b> and yet detects is better value for the money than one who, though an ideal companion for the drawing-room, is incompetent: and Mrs. Pett, like most other people, subconsciously held the view that the ruder a person is the more efficient he must be. It is but rarely that any one is found who is not dazzled by the glamour of incivility. She crushed down her resentment at her visitor's tone, and tried to concentrate her mind on the fact that this was a business matter and that what she wanted was results rather than fair words. She found it easier to do this when looking at the other's face. It was a capable face. Not beautiful, perhaps, but full of promise of action. Miss Trimble having ceased temporarily to speak, her mouth was in repose, and when her mouth was in repose it looked more efficient than anything else of its size in existence.|$|E
6000|$|The barber's pole I {{successfully}} {{extracted from}} David's mouth, but the difficulty (not foreseen) {{of knowing how}} to dispose of a barber's pole in the Kensington Gardens is considerable, there always being polite children hovering near who run after you and restore it to you. The young man, again, had said that anyone would lend me a bottle or a lemon, but though these were articles on which he seemed ever able to lay his hand, I found (what I had never noticed before) {{that there is a}} curious dearth of them in the Gardens. The magic egg-cup I usually carried about with me, and with its connivance I did some astonishing things with pennies, but even the penny that costs sixpence is uncertain, and just when you are saying triumphantly that it will be found in the egg-cup, it may clatter to the ground, whereon some ungenerous spectator, such as Irene, accuses you of fibbing and corrupting youthful minds. It was useless to tell her, <b>through</b> <b>clenched</b> <b>teeth,</b> that the whole thing was a joke, for she understood no jokes except her own, of which she had the most immoderately high opinion, and that would have mattered little to me had not David liked them also. There were times when I could not but think less of the boy, seeing him rock convulsed over antics of Irene that have been known to every nursemaid since the year One. While I stood by, sneering, he would give me the ecstatic look that meant, [...] "Irene is really very entertaining, isn't she?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, let's all sit down," [...] said my uncle, {{suddenly}} whistling <b>through</b> his <b>clenched</b> <b>teeth,</b> and briskly {{rubbing his}} hands together. He {{put up a}} chair for my mother, raised the blind of the little window, lowered it again, {{and returned to his}} hearthrug. [...] "I'm sure," [...] he said, as one who decides, [...] "I'm very glad to see you." ...|$|R
60|$|Stoutenburg cast a quick, almost furtive {{glance in}} the {{direction}} of the house where he had experienced such dire humiliation a brief half hour ago. A curious whistling sound escaped <b>through</b> his <b>clenched</b> <b>teeth,</b> a sound such as many a wild beast makes when expectant of prey. Then he drew Jan further away from the house, fearful lest his words were wafted toward it on the wind.|$|R
60|$|He {{felt her}} stretch {{out her arms}} and {{presently}} he saw this wonderful thing: the eyes of Swanhild glowing in the darkness as the embers glowed upon the hearth. Now they glowed brightly, so brightly {{that he could see}} the outstretched arms and the hard white face beneath them, and now they grew dim, of a sudden to shine bright again. And all the while she hissed words <b>through</b> her <b>clenched</b> <b>teeth.</b>|$|R
6000|$|The {{horror of}} the {{bystanders}} began now {{to give way to}} indignation, and the sight of a favourite companion murdered in the midst of them, the provocation being, in their opinion, so utterly inadequate to the excess of vengeance, might have induced them to kill the perpetrator of the deed even upon the very spot. The constable, however, did his duty on this occasion, and with the assistance of some of the more reasonable persons present, procured horses to guard the prisoner to Carlisle, to abide his doom at the next assizes. While the escort was preparing, the prisoner neither expressed the least interest, nor attempted the slightest reply. Only, before he was carried from the fatal apartment, he desired to look at the dead body, which, raised from the floor, had been deposited upon the large table (at the head of which Harry Wakefield had presided but a few minutes before, full of life, vigour, and animation), until the surgeons should examine the mortal wound. The face of the corpse was decently covered with a napkin. To the surprise and {{horror of the}} bystanders, which displayed itself in a general AH! drawn <b>through</b> <b>clenched</b> <b>teeth</b> and half-shut lips, Robin Oig removed the cloth, and gazed with a mournful but steady eye on the lifeless visage, which had been so lately animated that the smile of good-humoured confidence in his own strength, of conciliation at once and contempt towards his enemy, still curled his lip. While those present expected that the wound, which had so lately flooded the apartment with gore, would send forth fresh streams at the touch of the homicide, Robin Oig replaced the covering with the brief exclamation, [...] "He was a pretty man!" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Forgive me," [...] {{he mumbled}} <b>through</b> pain <b>clenched</b> <b>teeth,</b> as they drew {{in their first}} air again. [...] "And leave me." [...] He spoke jerkily, with pain-filled pauses between his sentences. [...] "There {{is no need for}} both of us to drown. I've got to go. It will be in my stomach, at any moment, and then I'll drag you under, and be unable to let go of you. Please, please, dear, keep away. One of us is enough. You've plenty to live for." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{he never}} reached the boats. As {{he passed the}} bush Gurnet sprang on him like a tiger and seized him round the throat with both hands, choking a shout that was coming up, and causing his eyes to start almost out of his head. Without uttering a word, and only giving {{now and then a}} terrible hiss <b>through</b> his <b>clenched</b> <b>teeth,</b> Gurnet pushed the Spaniard before him, keeping {{carefully}} {{out of sight of the}} beach, and holding him fast by the nape of the neck, so that when he perceived the slightest symptom of a tendency to cry out he had only to press his strong fingers and effectually nip it in the bud.|$|R
5000|$|His little uniform was spic and span, close-fitting, {{his feet}} turned outwards, his hair {{smoothed}} down and greased, his nails perfectly cut, his hands well groomed like a lord's. His manners were elegant, aristocratic: his speech likewise, delivered <b>through</b> somewhat <b>clenched</b> <b>teeth,</b> interspersed with French phrases, rather precious. There was a touch—though very moderate—of foppishness. His politeness and good manners were exceptional. The ladies made a fuss of him. He {{sat at the}} piano and, throwing up his hands coquettishly, played with extreme sweetness and grace (etc) extracts from Trovatore, Traviata, and so on, and around him buzzed in chorus: [...] "Charmant, délicieux!" [...] and suchlike. I met Modest Petrovich {{three or four times}} at Popov's in this way, both on duty and at the hospital." ...|$|R

5000|$|As {{the decade}} progressed, Jones would move {{further away from}} the high lonesome, Hank Williams-influences singing style that {{characterized}} many of his Starday and early Mercury recordings and begin exploring the lower registers of his voice. He would also adopt a more idiosyncratic singing style reminiscent of fellow Texas honky-tonk legend Lefty Frizzell. [...] "Out of Control" [...] {{laid the foundation for}} this new vocal approach. As Rich Kienzle notes in the 1994 Sony retrospective The Essential George Jones: The Spirit of Country, [...] "He changed the volume of his voice or swooped from a deep bass to a high treble to accentuate a phrase or lyric. At times he'd stiffen his jaw or sing <b>through</b> <b>clenched</b> <b>teeth</b> to emphasize a point." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{house was}} {{rather like the}} {{ordinary}} kind, {{but there was a}} convenient sausage-shop exactly opposite (trust Joey for that) and we saw a policeman in the street looking the other way, as they always do look just before you rub them. A woman wearing the same kind of clothes as people in other houses wear, told us {{to go up to the}} second floor, and she grinned at David, as if she had heard about him; so up we went, David muttering <b>through</b> his <b>clenched</b> <b>teeth,</b> [...] "I sha'n't laugh," [...] and as soon as we knocked a voice called out, [...] "Here we are again!" [...] at which a shudder passed through David as if he feared that he had set himself an impossible task. In we went, however, and though the voice had certainly come from this room we found nobody there. I looked in bewilderment at David, and he quickly put his hand over his mouth.|$|R
5000|$|General Specific (voiced by Kevin Seal) is {{the main}} {{antagonist}} of the series. The dim-witted leader of the Secret Military Organization, Specific does his best to capture Sheep for his Sheep-Powered Ray Gun. He is never discouraged by his constant losses. Specific always speaks <b>through</b> his <b>clenched</b> <b>teeth.</b> He mentions in one episode {{that he has a}} steel plate in his head. In one episode, he also developed the habit of throwing his subordinates into [...] "The Pit" [...] (a door, appearing out of nowhere under the characters' feet) (he once did it to the subordinate who asked him why he doesn't simply catch some random sheep and make the Sheep-Powered Ray Gun compatible to it), but later, finds out that this is a problem, when neither he nor Private Public can maneuver the helicopter properly, because Specific dropped the helicopter pilot into the Pit. General Specific's name is an oxymoron. On his uniform, he has 3 medals that look like exclamation marks, and one that looks like a question mark.|$|R

The conditions that he made with me, before parting with {{the secret of the}} Dutch bottle, were, that I should take the fortune, and that he should take his Mound and no more. I owe everything I possess, solely to the disinterestedness, uprightness, tenderness, goodness (there are no words to satisfy me) of Mr and Mrs Boffin.

50|$|David Sternberg (actor/activist Ron Silver) and {{his father}} Eli (Jerry Lewis) ran a {{clothing}} business, and were being squeezed by the fearsome gangster Rick Pinzolo (Stanley Tucci). David goes to the OCB for help, thus Vinnie is recruited to act as security for the Sternbergs. After a small-time loanshark attacked and injured Vinnie, he was temporarily replaced by retired agent John Henry Raglin (Anthony Denison). (This was done {{in order to allow}} Ken Wahl to recover from a broken ankle he suffered in an on-set accident.) Raglin brought down (and killed) Pinzolo, but not in time to save Eli's business or David's life. Joan Chen appeared in one episode of this arc, as a rebellious Chinese sweatshop worker with whom the married Raglin briefly has an affair. After Raglin breaks Pinzolo's jaw, the character has his jaw wired shut, requiring Tucci to talk <b>through</b> <b>clenched</b> <b>teeth</b> afterward.|$|E

50|$|Following this, Eastwood and {{his wife}} moved into an {{apartment}} at Villa Sands at 4040 Arch Drive off Ventura Boulevard {{to be closer to}} the Universal lot, also occupied by fellow Universal actresses Gia Scala and Lili Kardell. It also gave Eastwood an opportunity to continue his swimming as it had notable swimming facilities, and the apartment block became a venue for many swimsuit photo shoots, including a memorable one of Anita Ekberg in a leopard skin bikini. In 1954, he agreed to play the part of a scarecrow in the annual Christmas musical for children of employees of Universal studio. Meanwhile, Eastwood was coached by Jess Kimmel and Jack Kosslyn, and UCLA professor, Dr. Daniel Vandraegen who specialized in correcting bad speech. Eastwood had an early tendency to speak almost in a sibilant whisper and was advised to project his voice. These traits never fully went away, but actually worked in his favor in his later films, especially as the Man with No Name in which he often hissed his lines <b>through</b> <b>clenched</b> <b>teeth.</b> Although Clint was self-conscious on camera, he demonstrated a strength in displaying anger onscreen, and in one improvised scene during training with Betty Jane Howarth, it left her in tears.|$|E
6000|$|On {{receiving}} these direful tidings, the valiant Peter {{started from}} his seat--dashed the pipe he was smoking {{against the back}} of the chimney--thrust a prodigious quid of tobacco into his left cheek--pulled up his galligaskins, and strode up and down the room, humming, as was customary with him when in a passion, a hideous north-west ditty. But, as I have before shown, he was not a man to vent his spleen in idle vaporing. His first measure, after the paroxysm of wrath had subsided, was to stump upstairs to a huge wooden chest which served as his armory, from whence he drew forth that identical suit of regimentals described in the preceding chapter. In these portentous habiliment she arrayed himself, like Achilles in the armor of Vulcan, maintaining all the while an appalling silence, knitting his brows, and drawing his breath <b>through</b> his <b>clenched</b> <b>teeth.</b> Being hastily equipped, he strode down into the parlor, and jerked down his trusty sword from over the fireplace, where it was usually suspended; but before he girded it on his thigh, he drew it from its scabbard, and as his eye coursed along the rusty blade, a grim smile stole over his iron visage; it was the first smile that had visited his countenance for five long weeks; but every one who beheld it prophesied that there would soon be warm work in the province! ...|$|R
60|$|De Catinat {{gripped the}} line which was thrown to him, and on drawing it up {{found that it}} was {{attached}} to a rope ladder furnished at the top with two steel hooks to catch on to the bulwarks. He placed them in position, and then made his way very softly to the cabin amidships in the ladies' quarters which had been allotted to his wife. She was the only woman aboard the ship now, so {{that he was able to}} tap at her door in safety, and to explain in a few words the need for haste and for secrecy. In ten minutes Adele had dressed, and with her valuables in a little bundle, had slipped out from her cabin. Together they made their way upon deck once more, and crept aft under the shadow of the bulwarks. They were almost there when De Catinat stopped suddenly and ground out an oath <b>through</b> his <b>clenched</b> <b>teeth.</b> Between them and the rope ladder there was standing in a dim patch of murky light the grim figure of a Franciscan friar. He was peering through the darkness, his heavy cowl shadowing his face, and he advanced slowly as if he had caught a glimpse of them. A lantern hung from the mizzen shrouds above him. He unfastened it and held it up to cast its light upon them.|$|R
60|$|This was, I think, {{before the}} third expedition. Yes, {{it must have}} been the third, for I {{remember}} that it was boldly planned and that it was carried out without a hitch. The tentative period was over; all our arrangements had been perfected. There was, so to speak, always an unfailing smoke on the hill and an unfailing lantern on the shore. Our friends, mostly bought for hard cash and therefore valuable, had acquired confidence in us. This, they seemed to say, is no unfathomable roguery of penniless adventurers. This is but the reckless enterprise of men of wealth and sense and needn’t be inquired into. The young caballero has got real gold pieces in the belt he wears next his skin; and the man with the heavy moustaches and unbelieving eyes is indeed very much of a man. They gave to Dominic all their respect and to me a great show of deference; for I had all the money, while they thought that Dominic had all the sense. That judgment was not exactly correct. I had my share of judgment and audacity which surprises me now that the years have chilled the blood without dimming the memory. I remember going about the business with light-hearted, clear-headed recklessness which, according as its decisions were sudden or considered, made Dominic draw his breath <b>through</b> his <b>clenched</b> <b>teeth,</b> or look hard at me before he gave me either a slight nod of assent or a sarcastic “Oh, certainly”—just as the humour of the moment prompted him.|$|R
