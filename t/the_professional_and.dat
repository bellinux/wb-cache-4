5|$|The Supremes' {{name change}} fueled already present {{rumors of a}} solo career for Ross and contributed to <b>the</b> <b>professional</b> <b>and</b> {{personal}} dismantling of the group. In fact, Gordy intended to replace Ross with Barbara Randolph {{as early as the}} fall of 1966, but changed his mind and instead kept Ross in the group for several more years. Gordy's caution may have been sparked by an incident in early 1966 as the group prepared to make their second appearance at the Copacabana. Angered by erratic behavior from Florence Ballard, Gordy intended to replace her with Marlene Barrow, a member of the Motown in-house singing group the Andantes. However, when club management heard of this change, they threatened to cancel the group's appearance if Ballard was replaced, as they saw Ballard's banter with her group mates as a major part of their act's success.|$|E
5|$|While Karl Aloys zu Fürstenberg {{fought for}} the Habsburg cause in Serbia, in France, a {{coalition}} of the clergy and <b>the</b> <b>professional</b> <b>and</b> bourgeois class—the First and Third estates—led a call for reform of the French government {{and the creation of}} a written constitution. Initially, the rulers of Europe viewed the French Revolution as an event between the French king and his subjects, and not something in which they should interfere. In 1790, Leopold succeeded his brother Joseph as emperor and by 1791, he considered the situation surrounding his sister, Marie Antoinette, and her children, with greater alarm. In August 1791, in consultation with French émigré nobles and Frederick William II of Prussia, he issued the Declaration of Pilnitz, in which they declared the interest of the monarchs of Europe as one with the interests of Louis XVI and his family. They threatened ambiguous, but quite serious, consequences if anything should happen to the royal family. The French émigrés continued to agitate for support of a counter-revolution. On 20 April 1792, the French National Convention declared war on Austria. In the War of the First Coalition (1792–1797), France opposed most of the European states sharing land or water borders with her, plus Portugal and the Ottoman Empire.|$|E
