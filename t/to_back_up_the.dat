5|$|Eventually, as the circumstantial coincidences build up, Knight becomes {{convinced}} that Gorman's story is true. The lack of tangible evidence, he claims, {{is due to}} a government cover-up and deliberate misdirection of the police investigation. <b>To</b> <b>back</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> claims of a masonic conspiracy, he notes supposed similarities between the Jack the Ripper killings and alleged masonic ritual murders, and accuses Sir Charles Warren, Commissioner of Police, of destroying evidence to protect his freemason cronies. Knight points out that Stowell, who was apparently the first person to suggest Albert Victor's and Gull's involvement in the murders, was a freemason.|$|E
5|$|In previews, {{publications}} such as IGN and GameSpot {{noted that}} the graphics had been improved, {{and that there were}} many new characters and locations. The new minigames were previewed, and IGN pointed out that they offered enough complexity <b>to</b> <b>back</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> simple gameplay. In an interview with GameSpot, Ted Price stated that the emphasis for the title was on the new critters, but that Spyro would not be left behind in the story. Year of the Dragon also implemented crack protection, in addition to the copy protection previous games had contained. This helped prevent hackers from cracking the game until two months after release.|$|E
5|$|The Houston Texans, {{the newest}} {{franchise}} in the NFL, signed Quinn to a reserve/future contract on December 30, 2001. Following the 2002 NFL Draft {{in which the}} Texans drafted quarterback David Carr with their first ever pick, Quinn became the backup. Quinn and Tony Banks ended up winning the backup jobs to Carr over Kent Graham and Ben Sankey. Banks was secondstring with Quinn being the thirdstring quarterback. The Texans waived Quinn during final cuts on August 25, 2003. He was the final member of the Texans first signings still on the team. He was re-signed to the practice squad on November 17 after David Carr suffered a sprained right shoulder. However, when Banks also became injured, Quinn was signed from the practice squad <b>to</b> <b>back</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> now healthy Carr and rookie Dave Ragone.|$|E

In the aftermath of his failed reform, Kosygin spent {{the rest of his life}} improving the economic administration through the modification of targets; he implemented various programmes to improve food security and ensure the future intensification of production. There is no proof <b>to</b> <b>back</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> claim that the reform itself contributed to the high growth seen in the late-1960s, and that its cancellation had anything to do with the stagnating growth of the economy which began in the 1970s.|$|E
