This photograph was quickly reproduced on the front pages of newspapers around the world. Mrs. Kennedy testified the following June that she was aware of the image, but had no memory of her actions. Hill later wrote that this picture would forever identify him as the Secret Service agent {{on the back of the}} limousine.|$|E
25|$|The {{crossing}} was of {{inherently dangerous}} design, in {{that a long}} vehicle could be trapped partly on the crossing while held by a red light at the intersection. If <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> <b>had</b> realized the danger, she would still {{have been forced to}} pull through a red light to clear the track when the warning bells sounded.|$|E

25|$|On 1 February 2008, an East Midlands {{train was}} {{involved}} in an incident at Barrow upon Soar. The train hit a footbridge in its path, after a road vehicle had struck and damaged the bridge causing it to be foul of the line. Six passengers were on board the service and <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> <b>had</b> to be cut free from the driving cab.|$|E
25|$|A First Great Western {{train from}} Swansea to Paddington, {{travelling}} at approximately , derailed shortly after it {{passed through a}} set of points close to Southall station. The train remained upright but travelled a further , passing an oncoming High Speed Train, through Hanwell station, and over Wharncliffe Viaduct before coming to a halt. There were no injuries to the 450 passengers on board, but <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> <b>had</b> to be treated for shock.|$|E
25|$|At {{stations}} {{a smaller}} pipe was laid alongside {{the track and}} a piston in this {{was connected to the}} train by a rope to start it moving. On arrival at the next station it was up to the driver to bring the train to a stop using its brakes. Engine houses were situated at every station except Exeter St Thomas where <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> <b>had</b> to hold the train against the atmospheric pressure with the brakes.|$|E

25|$|The {{conductor}} {{driver was}} {{not qualified to}} drive diesel locomotives, but he had done so occasionally before. It was {{thought that he was}} used to driving without a speedometer and so had misjudged his speed on the approach to Lincoln, entering a 15 mph curve at around 55 mph. <b>The</b> <b>driver</b> <b>had</b> also evidently been inattentive because the home signal near the curve was not cleared until the train was almost at it, yet it passed the signal at around 60 mph.|$|E
25|$|Media {{coverage}} from within Bahrain has been problematic. Some cases produced only gone unconfirmed or contradictory reports, {{such as the}} death of an elderly taxi driver on 13 March 2011. The Gulf Daily News reported that <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> <b>had</b> been beaten to death by anti-government protesters. Other Bahraini media reported the driver as killed by terrorists. Independent newspaper Al-Wasat reported the cause of death as a simple traffic accident and cited witnesses. The Commission of Inquiry did not report any deaths like this connected to the uprisings.|$|E
25|$|The 42-year-old tram {{driver was}} arrested by the British Transport Police on {{suspicion}} of manslaughter. After questioning, he was released on bail until May 2017. According to The Metro, {{one aspect of the}} police investigation {{is whether or not the}} tram driver fell asleep; and The Guardian reports that some passengers said <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> <b>had</b> blacked out at the controls. In November 2017, it was reported that a file was being prepared for the Crown Prosecution Service, who would decide whether or not a trial would take place.|$|E

25|$|No {{charges were}} filed for the weapons, as they were all {{registered}} and securely locked away, and Popper was licensed to carry them, {{with the exception of}} the brass knuckles and switchblade knife which Popper agreed to surrender. A deal was reached that allowed the marijuana charge to be dropped if Popper remained free of further drug infractions for one year and attended eight hours of drug counseling. Popper and <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> <b>had</b> been driving back to Washington from Austin, Texas, and Popper likes to visit gun ranges during long trips.|$|E
25|$|Tests {{showed no}} {{signalling}} equipment faults and {{the report was}} able to dismiss {{the possibility that the}} signalman had only changed the route after the Perth train had passed the caution signal. The driver of the Perth train had not slowed his train in response to this signal and had then passed two danger signals before colliding with the Tring train. All the evidence suggested that <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> <b>had</b> made no attempt to stop until the very last moment: Eyewitnesses on board the Perth train reported that an emergency brake application was made a few seconds before the collision.|$|E
25|$|The CFA {{line between}} Lannion and Plestin was damaged by high tides at St. Efflan, {{where the line}} ran along the shore, on 22 September 1918. Service was resumed on 27 September. There were {{derailments}} at Ploumillau on 24 August 1917 and 15 July 1918; St. Michel-en Grève on 23 October 1923 (this one was due to defective track); at St. Efflam on 21 October 1923, 29 March and 30 March 1924 (the latter because <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> <b>had</b> not been notified of the poor condition of the track). None of these accidents was of a serious nature.|$|E

25|$|The driver at {{no point}} saw or heard Corrie. She was {{standing}} behind debris which obstructed {{the view of the}} driver and <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> <b>had</b> a very limited field of vision due to the protective cage he was working in.... The driver and his commanders were interrogated extensively {{over a long period of}} time with the use of polygraph tests and video evidence. They had no knowledge that she was standing in the path of the tractor. An autopsy of Corrie's body revealed that the cause of death was from falling debris and not from the tractor physically rolling over her. It was a tragic accident that never should have happened.|$|E
25|$|The {{system was}} finally {{identified}} for replacement following an accident at Kensal Green, when a main line train {{ran into the}} back of Bakerloo Line train. <b>The</b> <b>driver</b> <b>had</b> apparently mistaken the calling on aspect for a normal yellow aspect (the signal was temporarily operating on a maximum yellow due to track side work). The indications were that the driver was distracted as his pay slip and its envelope were recovered from the wreckage – but this was never proved as the cause. It was also suggested that the driver may not even have checked the indications having observed the fall of the train stop. The entire line was resignalled to the standard colour light system in 1988.|$|E
25|$|The Moorgate tube crash {{occurred}} on 28 February 1975 at 08:46 GMT on the Northern City Line, then operated by London Underground as the Highbury {{branch of the}} Northern line. A train failed {{to stop at the}} Moorgate station, the line's southern terminus, and crashed into the wall {{at the end of the}} tunnel. In the greatest loss of life during peacetime in the London Underground, 43 people died and a further 74 were injured. With no fault being found with the train equipment, a report from the Department of the Environment found that <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> <b>had</b> failed to slow the train and stop at the station and there was insufficient evidence to determine the reason.|$|E

25|$|The {{number of}} mercenaries was {{unknown to the}} Seychellois, as was the fact of whether the attack at the airport was {{supposed}} to coincide with a seaborne invasion. They subsequently set up a roadblock on {{the north end of}} the airport and mounted an unsuccessful attack on the Pointe La Rue Barracks in which one mercenary was wounded. Seychellois forces, with two armoured vehicles, occupied the airstrip, confining the putschists to the airport's buildings. They also fired upon the chartered aircraft, disabling it. One of the armoured vehicles made its way to the terminal forecourt, but the lights were out in the building and <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> <b>had</b> difficulty spotting the mercenaries. The vehicle's tires were quickly shot out and it was set ablaze by a Molotov cocktail. 2nd Lieutenant David Antat, the vehicle's commander, emerged from the top and engaged the mercenaries. They surrounded the vehicle and shot Antat several times in the chest, killing him.|$|E
25|$|Newson {{had worked}} for London Underground since 1969 and the {{post-mortem}} examination {{did not find any}} evidence of a medical problem, such as a stroke or heart attack, that could have incapacitated him. There was some doubt as to whether he had consumed alcohol. Testing for this was hampered by the four-and-a-half days it took to retrieve his body from the wreckage. Analysis showed that his blood alcohol level, {{at the time of the}} post-mortem, was 80mg/100ml, but it was not possible to reach a definite conclusion as to whether this was the result of consumption of alcohol or a product of the process of decomposition. 80mg/100ml is the current English legal limit for driving a car (the limit at the time of the accident was higher), and the medical experts disagreed with each other on whether any amount consumed would have affected his ability to drive the train. Medical evidence to the official inquiry raised the possibility that <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> <b>had</b> been affected by a condition such as transient global amnesia, or akinesis with mutism, where the brain continues to function and the individual remains aware, although not being able to move physically, but it was stated that there was no evidence to indicate either condition: to positively diagnose akinesis with mutism would depend on a microscopic examination of the brain, which was not possible owing to decomposition, and transient global amnesia would leave no traces at post-mortem in any case.|$|E
500|$|On 16 June 2011, a {{fire started}} in the snow tunnel at Hallingskeid Station on the Bergen Line. As the station is unmanned, there was no prior warning of the fire until the driver saw it from the cab just as the train entered the tunnel. More or less simultaneously, the train reached {{the point of the}} line were the fire had damaged the {{overhead}} supply. The driver immediately applied the emergency brake, which caused the train to stop [...] from the fire. Because the train had no power, {{it was not possible to}} reverse out. The 257 passengers were then immediately evacuated. All personnel acted according to regulations and no-one was injured in the accident. According to <b>the</b> <b>driver,</b> <b>had</b> he not lost the power, he would have continued through the tunnel, as the fire was just at the beginning stage. The train, which consisted of two Class 73 units, no. 10 and 13, eventually caught fire and was damaged beyond repair. Class 73 trains are to be taken out of service on the Bergen Line from the fall of 2012.|$|E
