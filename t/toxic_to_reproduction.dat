25|$|Di-2ethylhexylphthalate (DEHP) {{has been}} {{medically}} approved {{for many years}} for use in medical devices; the PVC-DEHP combination proving to be very suitable for making blood bags because DEHP stabilises red blood cells, minimising haemolysis (red blood cell rupture). However, DEHP is coming under increasing pressure in Europe. The assessment of potential risks related to phthalates, {{and in particular the}} use of DEHP in PVC medical devices, was subject to scientific and policy review by the European Union authorities, and on 21 March 2010, a specific labeling requirement was introduced across the EU for all devices containing phthalates that are classified as CMR (carcinogenic, mutagenic or <b>toxic</b> <b>to</b> <b>reproduction).</b> The label aims to enable healthcare professionals to use this equipment safely, and, where needed, take appropriate precautionary measures for patients at risk of over-exposure.|$|E

2500|$|On March 15, 2017 the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) {{announced}} recommendations proceeding from a {{risk assessment}} of glyphosate performed by ECHA's Committee for Risk Assessment (RAC). [...] Their recommendations maintained the current classification of glyphosate as a substance causing serious eye damage and as a substance toxic to aquatic life.

40|$|Daphnia magna {{is used as}} a model {{organism}} {{to study}} the consequences of the impact of mutagenic chemicals to natural populations. Adult daphnids were exposed to a mutagenic test compound to test whether their offspring showed effects of induced mutations at exposure levels lower than the No Observed Effect Concentration for growth and reproduction. Life-history parameters were used as test parameters. A concentration-related <b>toxic</b> effect <b>to</b> <b>reproduction</b> could be measured reproducibly in the exposed adult daphnids. However, no indication of a mutagenic effect could be detected in their offspring. This may have been due to the inadequateness of the system to detect induced genetic change. ...|$|R
30|$|Metal oxide NPs, {{including}} Ti, Zn [80] and Ag [81], {{have been}} shown to alter enzymatic activities and bacterial community structure in soils, especially when these are alkaline. In plants, Ag-based ENPs {{have been shown}} to exert negative effects at low doses, causing chromosomal aberrations [69]. These ENPs are also active against natural enemies of the mosquito, suggesting a potential public health problem through disruption of biological control of mosquito populations [64]. There is evidence that CuO-based ENPs are <b>toxic</b> <b>to</b> the <b>reproduction</b> of Enchytraeus crypticus (earthworm) and this may alter soil processes, since earthworms are key players in soil health [75]. Soil processes may also be altered via the nitrogen cycle in plants when impacted by TiO 2, as well as by Ag-based and CuO ENPs.|$|R

2500|$|While {{glyphosate}} and formulations such as Roundup {{have been}} approved by regulatory bodies worldwide, concerns about their effects on humans and the environment persist. Many regulatory and scholarly reviews have evaluated the relative toxicity of glyphosate as an herbicide. The German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment toxicology review in 2013 found that [...] "the available data is contradictory and far from being convincing" [...] with regard to correlations between exposure to glyphosate formulations and risk of various cancers, including non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). A meta-analysis published in 2014 identified {{an increased risk of}} NHL in workers exposed to glyphosate formulations. In March 2015 the World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer classified glyphosate as [...] "probablynbsp&carcinogenicnbsp&in humans" [...] (category 2A) based on epidemiological studies, animal studies, and in vitro studies. In November, 2015, the European Food Safety Authority published an updated assessment report on glyphosate, concluding that [...] "the substance is unlikely to be genotoxic (i.e. damaging to DNA) or to pose a carcinogenic threat to humans." [...] Furthermore, the final report clarified that while other, probably carcinogenic, glyphosate-containing formulations may exist, studies [...] "that look solely at the active substance glyphosate do not show this effect." [...] The WHO and FAO Joint committee on pesticide residues issued a report in 2016 confirming that the use of glyphosate formulations does not constitute a health risk and also gave admissible daily intake limits for chronic toxicity. The European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) maintained their current classification of glyphosate as a substance causing serious eye damage and as a substance toxic to aquatic life, but did not find evidence implicating it to be a carcinogen, a mutagen, <b>toxic</b> <b>to</b> <b>reproduction,</b> nor toxic to specific organs.|$|E

50|$|Substances {{that may}} have serious effects on {{human health and the}} {{environment}} are identified as Substances of Very High Concern (SVHC)1. These are mainly substances which cause cancer, mutation or are <b>toxic</b> <b>to</b> <b>reproduction</b> as well as substances which persist in the body or the environment and do not break down. Other substances considered as SVHCs include, for example, endocrine disrupting chemicals. Companies manufacturing or importing articles containing these substances in a concentration above 0,1% weight of the article, have legal obligations. They are required to inform users about the presence of the substance and therefore how to use it safely. Consumers have the right to ask the retailer whether these substances are present in the products they buy.|$|E

5000|$|In the US, state {{regulation}} applies {{in addition to}} federal regulation. For example, California's governor Arnold Schwarzenegger signed off fiercely contested toxics legislation that requires cosmetic producers to report use of ingredients classified as carcinogenic or <b>toxic</b> <b>to</b> <b>reproduction,</b> a measure primarily aimed at phthalates. The legal basis for monitoring cosmetics in the European Union is derived from Cosmetics Directive 76/768/EEC. [...] This 1976 directive requires that cosmetic products 'must not cause damage to human health when applied under normal or reasonably foreseeable conditions of use'. The safety officer of a company with marketed cosmetics files product information, including a safety report, in electronic or other format to the competent authority of the Member State. This takes place after placing cosmetic products on the market, with updates by state requirement.|$|E

50|$|Using {{potentially}} {{toxic substances}} (such as phthalates or brominated flame retardants) is deemed undesirable and REACH will force {{the use of}} certain substances to be phased out. Using potentially toxic substances in products other than those ingested by humans (such as electronic devices) {{may seem to be}} safe, but there are several ways in which chemicals can enter the human body and the environment. Substances can leave particles during consumer use, for example into the air where they can be inhaled or ingested. Even where they might not do direct harm to humans, they can contaminate the air or water, and can enter the food chain through plants, fish or other animals. According to the European Commission, little safety information exists for 99 percent of {{the tens of thousands of}} chemicals placed on the market before 1981. There were 100,106 chemicals in use in the EU in 1981, when the last survey was performed. Of these only 3,000 have been tested and over 800 are known to be carcinogenic, mutagenic or <b>toxic</b> <b>to</b> <b>reproduction.</b> These are listed in the Annex 1 of the Dangerous Substances Directive (now Annex VI of the CLP Regulation).|$|E

30|$|Meanwhile {{the first}} “tranche” for the {{registration}} {{is done for}} all chemicals with a market volume of more than 1, 000 tons per annum and for chemicals, which have a high concern out of hazardous reasons (e.g. carcinogenic, mutagenic or <b>toxic</b> <b>to</b> <b>reproduction</b> (CMR)). By the REACH deadline of 30 November 2010 for the first tranche, 24, 675 registration dossiers have been submitted for 4, 300 substances including nearly 3, 400 phase-in substances [13]. In the coming years {{the rest of the}} existing chemicals have to be registered. Currently the evaluation of the dossiers takes place.|$|E
40|$|Regulation 1272 / 2008 {{includes}} {{provisions for}} {{two types of}} classification: harmonised classification and self-classification.

If a chemical substance is not included in the harmonised classification list it must be self-classified, based on available information, according to the requirements of Annex I of the CLP Regulation. CLP appoints that the harmonised classification will be performed for carcinogenic, mutagenic or <b>toxic</b> <b>to</b> <b>reproduction</b> substances (CMR substances) and for respiratory sensitisers category 1 and for other hazard classes on a case-by-case basis. The first step of classification is the gathering of available and relevant information. This paper presents the procedure for gathering information and to obtain data.

The borate industry refute the inclusion European Borates Association (2010), and a proposal has been submitted by Poland to the European Chemicals Agency for a reduction in reproduction toxicity classification to category 2 according to CLP Regulation (EC) No 1272 / 2008 (European Chemicals Agency 2013). Given the contentiousness of its use, and the numerous studies available reporting its harmfulness (Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry 2010), boron as a fire retardant for timber treatment has been excluded from this review.|$|E
40|$|Bioassays were {{conducted}} to determine the toxicity of monoterpenoids to the tracheal mite, Acarapis woodi (Rennie), and its honey bee, Apis mellifera L. host. Compounds assayed included one terpene hydrocarbon (d-limonene), one terpene aldehyde (citral), one terpene ketone (pulegone), and four terpene alcohols (carvacrol, menthol, thymol, and α-terpineol). The effects of exposure time, temperature, and humidity were examined for citral and menthol fumigations. ^ In topical application studies, only citral and α-terpineol were more <b>toxic</b> <b>to</b> tracheal mites. Citral was 7. 0, 5. 0, and 3. 5 more <b>toxic</b> <b>to</b> mites at the LD 10, LD 50, and LD 90, respectively. α-Terpineol was 3. 5 times more <b>toxic</b> <b>to</b> mites at the LD 10; however, differences were not significant at the LD 50 or LD 90. In fumigation studies, menthol and citral were more <b>toxic</b> <b>to</b> tracheal mites. Menthol was 52. 0, 18. 8, and 5. 7 times more toxic at the LD 10, LD 50 and LD 90, respectively. Citral was 2. 9 (2. 5 - 3. 3) times more <b>toxic</b> <b>to</b> mites at all concentrations estimated. Thymol and carvacrol were numerically more <b>toxic</b> <b>to</b> mites, although the differences were not significant statistically. ^ Menthol exhibited the greatest margin of safety in fumigation studies; however, menthol and thymol were more <b>toxic</b> <b>to</b> honey bees than other monoterpenoids. While menthol toxicity to adult mites was high, toxicity to eggs and larvae was limited. Menthol efficacy was not diminished by high or low humidity; however, bee mortality was reduced when applications were made at high relative humidity. Menthol toxicity to both bees and mites increased at higher temperatures. ^ Citral was the only compound assayed that was more <b>toxic</b> <b>to</b> mites than bees in both topical and fumigant application studies. In fumigation studies, citral was highly <b>toxic</b> <b>to</b> all mite life stages. Citral was more <b>toxic</b> <b>to</b> mites at high temperatures, while bee toxicity increased at lower temperatures. Maximum mite control was achieved eight times faster with citral than menthol in fumigation assays. ...|$|R
