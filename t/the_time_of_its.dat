40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} the portfolio choice problem for an investor interested in long-run growth optimality while facing drawdown constraints {{in a general}} continuous semimartingale model. The paper introduces the numéraire property through the notion of expected relative return and shows that drawdown-constrained strategies with the numéraire property exist and are unique, but may depend on the financial planning horizon. We explicitly characterize the growth-optimal strategy and show that it enjoys the numéraire property within the class of investments satisfying the drawdown constraint, when sampled at <b>the</b> <b>times</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> maximum and asymptotically as the timehorizon becomes distant. Finally, it is established that the asymptotically growth-optimal strategy is obtained as limit of numéraire strategies on finite horizons...|$|R
