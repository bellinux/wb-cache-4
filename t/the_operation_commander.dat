2500|$|The navy's assault {{involved}} 400 {{sailors and}} marines in 25 boats. The operation was a fiasco {{from beginning to}} end. [...] Poor reconnaissance, planning, and communication all characterized <b>the</b> <b>operation.</b> <b>Commander</b> Thomas H. Stevens, Jr., commanding the monitor Patapsco, was placed {{in charge of the}} assault. When Commander Stevens protested that he [...] "knew nothing of [...] organization [...] " [...] and [...] "made some remonstrances on this grounds and others." [...] Dahlgren replied, [...] "There is nothing but a corporal's guard [...] in the fort, and {{all we have to do}} is go and take possession." [...] This underestimation of the Confederate forces on Dahlgren's part may explain why he was hostile to a joint operation wishing to reserve the credit for the victory to the navy. Less than half of the boats landed. [...] Most of the boats that did land landed on the right flank or right gorge angle, rather than on the gorge where there was a passable breach. The Union sailors and marines who did land could not scale the wall. [...] The Confederates fired upon the landing party and as well as throwing hand grenades and loose bricks. The men in the boats that had not landed fired muskets and revolvers blindly at the fort, endangering the landing party more than the garrison. The landing party took shelter in shell holes in the wall of the fort. In response to a signal rocket fired by the garrison, Fort Johnson and the Confederate warship CSS Chicora opened fire upon the boats and landing party. The boats that could withdraw withdrew and the landing party surrendered. The Union casualties were 8 killed, 19 wounded, and 105 captured (including 15 of the wounded). The Confederates did not suffer any casualties in the assault.|$|E

50|$|While {{all this}} was taking place, one of <b>the</b> <b>operations</b> <b>commander's</b> main {{concerns}} was where the main sweep of <b>the</b> <b>operation</b> would occur. In a perfect scenario, the Para-stops would form the main sweep, and the G-car stops would carry out blocking actions. In reality there was such situational variation in combat operations {{that there was little}} functional difference between paratroopers or heliborne-troopers. However, heliborne-stops generally had more contacts and therefore saw the most action.|$|R

5000|$|Habib was <b>the</b> <b>operations</b> <b>commander</b> for <b>the</b> region. He was one {{of several}} al-Qaeda members who were more battle-hardened by combat {{experience}} in Iraq, Chechnya, and elsewhere. This experience rendered them more capable than their predecessors. According to The New York Times, this cadre was more radical than the previous generation of al-Qaeda leadership. The FBI described Habib as [...] "one of the five or six most capable, most experienced terrorists in the world.|$|R

5|$|In Westminster, {{the three}} {{government}} departments {{concerned with the}} British role in Sierra Leone—the MoD, the FCO, and DfID—struggled {{to agree on the}} objectives of the military deployment beyond the evacuation, which led to delays in issuing orders.

25|$|The most {{important}} factors, {{apart from the}} reaction of the enemy and the terrain, in a Fireforce <b>operation</b> were <b>the</b> reliability of intelligence and the skill of <b>the</b> <b>operations</b> <b>commander.</b> <b>The</b> majority of successful engagements were enabled by the skills of the Selous Scouts (many of whom were former enemy); they had the capacity to insert observation posts into the bush without being noticed by the inhabitants. The difficulty of commanding the scene was extreme and good Fireforce commanders were highly prized by the men.|$|R

50|$|Kaveh was 19 when Iran-Iraq war was started. He was {{dispatched}} to southern war zones. But due to lacking of trainer, {{he was sent}} back to Mashhad and started training in garrisons. Although he attached great importance to training, it was really hard for him not to attend the war directly, so he decided to go to Kurdistan province to oppose counter-revolution. Soon and because of his competence and courage, he was appointed as <b>the</b> <b>operation</b> <b>commander</b> of IRGC in Saqqez.|$|E

50|$|On 13 August, Gaddafi's Deputy Foreign Minister Khaled Kaim {{stated that}} the rebel assault on Tawergha had failed, saying tribesmen from Bani Walid had rallied to the fight the {{previous}} evening and pushed rebel forces {{all the way back}} to Misrata. This claim was not independently verified. The rebels themselves claimed that they were closing in on the last sniper and pro-Gaddafi artillery positions in the town. By the end of the day, a spokesperson for the National Transitional Council said Tawergha had been secured. Twelve anti-Gaddafi fighters were killed during <b>the</b> <b>operation,</b> <b>Commander</b> Ibrahim Halbus told BBC News.|$|E
50|$|While a third {{attempt was}} in the last stages of preparation, <b>the</b> <b>operation</b> <b>commander,</b> Lieutenant-Colonel Splendorelli, was ambushed between Bud Bud and Buula Barde. He {{and some of his}} staff were killed. As a {{consequence}} of the death of the commander of the operations and the effect of two failed operations intended to overcome the El-Buur mutiny, the spirit of Italian troops began to wane. The Governor took the situation seriously, and to prevent any more failure he requested two battalions from Eritrea to reinforce his troops, and assumed lead of the operations. Meanwhile, the rebellion was gaining sympathy across the country, and as far afield as Western Somalia.|$|E

50|$|On Sunday, May 4, 1947, the Irgun fighters {{arrived at}} Acre in a convoy {{consisting}} of a military truck, two military vans painted in British camouflage colors, two civilian vans, and a command jeep in the lead.

50|$|With {{effect from}} 1 January 2007, the EU {{will have a}} third option for commanding, from Brussels, {{missions}} and operations of limited size (that is, {{like that of a}} battlegroup: some 2,000 troops). On that date, the new EU Operations Centre (EUOC) within the EU Military Staff (EUMS) will be ready for action. Using some EUMS core staff, as well as some extra “double-hatted” EUMS officers and so-called “augmentees” from the Member States, the EU will have an increased capacity to respond to crisis management situations. So far, the EU has had two options as to how to run a military operation at the Operation Headquarters (OHQ) level. One option is, in a so-called “autonomous” operation, to make use of facilities provided by any of the five Operation Headquarters (OHQs) currently available in European Member States. A second option is, through recourse to NATO capabilities and common assets (under the so-called “Berlin plus” arrangements), to make use of command and control options such as Operation Headquarters located at Supreme Headquarters, Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE) in Mons, Belgium and D-SACEUR as <b>the</b> <b>Operation</b> <b>Commander.</b> This is the option used in the conduct of Operation ALTHEA, where EUFOR BiH operates in Bosnia and Herzegovina.|$|E
