5|$|Apart {{from the}} {{practically}} stable 48Ca, the longest lived radioisotope of calcium is 41Ca. It decays by electron capture to stable 41K with a half-life {{of about a}} hundred thousand years. Its existence in the early Solar System as an extinct radionuclide has been inferred from excesses of 41K: traces of 41Ca also still exist <b>today,</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> is a cosmogenic nuclide, continuously reformed through neutron activation of natural 40Ca. Many other calcium radioisotopes are known, ranging from 34Ca to 57Ca: they are all much shorter-lived than 41Ca, the most stable among them being 45Ca (half-life 163days) and 47Ca (half-life 4.54days). The isotopes lighter than 42Ca usually undergo beta plus decay to isotopes of potassium, and those heavier than 44Ca usually undergo beta minus decay to isotopes of scandium, although near the nuclear drip lines proton emission and neutron emission begin to be significant decay modes as well.|$|E
5|$|The longest-lived of the {{radioactive}} isotopes of iodine is iodine-129, {{which has a}} half-life of 15.7millionyears, decaying via beta decay to stable xenon-129. Some iodine-129 was formed along with iodine-127 before {{the formation of the}} Solar System, but it has by now completely decayed away, making it an extinct radionuclide that is nevertheless still useful in dating the history of the early Solar System or very old groundwaters, due to its mobility in the environment. Its former presence may be determined from an excess of its daughter xenon-129. Traces of iodine-129 still exist <b>today,</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> is also a cosmogenic nuclide, formed from cosmic ray spallation of atmospheric xenon: these traces make up 10−14 to 10−10 of all natural iodine. It also occurs from open-air nuclear testing, and is not hazardous because of its incredibly long half-life, the longest of all fission products. At the peak of thermonuclear testing in the 1960s and 1970s, iodine-129 still made up only about 10−7 of all natural iodine. Excited states of iodine-127 and iodine-129 are often used in Mössbauer spectroscopy.|$|E

25|$|Catholicism {{has been}} the {{predominant}} religion in France {{for more than a}} millennium, though it is not as actively practised <b>today</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> was. Among the 47,000 religious buildings in France, 94% are Roman Catholic. While in the 1980s, more than 80% of the French still declared themselves to be Catholics, in the 1990s this proportion had fallen to less than 70%, in the 2000s to less than 60%, and in the 2010s it is less than 50%. According to a survey held in 2016 by Institut Montaigne and Institut français d'opinion publique (Ifop) 51.1% of the total population of France was Christian as of that year; at the same time 39.6% of the population had no religion (atheism or agnosticism), 5.6% were Muslims, 2.5% were followers of other faiths, and the remaining 0.4% were undecided about their faith.|$|E

25|$|Lessuden village, as it {{was then}} known, {{consisted}} of one long street, now Main Street, and a narrow back-road which ran along Braeheads, on the high banks of the river. Several paths connected Braeheads to the main street. The form of the old village remains pretty much <b>today</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> was in times gone past. It probably was not much different in 1544 when the army of Henry VIII of England under the Earl of Hertford razed the Border Abbeys and caused destruction of dwellings in the village including Lessuden House, which was later rebuilt. Nearby this house stood the original village church called St Mary's which was established in the 12th century in the reign of David I. Through time the worshippers moved to a church erected at Benrig near St Boisil's Chapel which, with repeated repairs and reconstructions, stood until 1952 when it was finally demolished.|$|E
25|$|The Charismatic {{element of}} the Church is seen as being evident <b>today</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> {{was in the early}} days of Christianity. Some Catholic Charismatic {{communities}} conduct healing services, gospel power services, outreaches and evangelizations where the presence of the Holy Spirit is believed to be felt, and healings and miracles are said to take place. The mission of the Catholic Charismatic Renewal is to educate believers into the totality of the declaration of the gospels. This is done by a personal relationship with Jesus Christ; a one-to-one relationship with Jesus is seen as a possibility by the Charismatic. He is encouraged to talk to Jesus directly and search for what The Lord is saying so that his life will be one with Him; to walk in the Fruit of the Spirit in , this is what the Charismatic understands by giving their life to Jesus. Conscience is seen as an alternative voice of Jesus Christ.|$|E
25|$|The peak of {{traditional}} English folk, like progressive and electric folk, was the mid- to late-1970s, when, {{for a time}} it threatened to break through into the mainstream. By {{the end of the}} decade, however, it was in decline. The attendance at, and numbers of folk clubs began to decrease, probably as new musical and social trends, including punk rock, new wave and electronic music began to dominate. Although many acts like Martin Carthy and the Watersons continued to perform successfully, there were very few significant new acts pursuing traditional forms in the 1980s. This began to change with a new generation in the 1990s. The arrival and sometimes mainstream success of acts like Kate Rusby, Bellowhead, Nancy Kerr, Kathryn Tickell, Jim Moray, Spiers and Boden, Seth Lakeman, Frank Turner, Laura Marling and Eliza Carthy, all largely concerned with acoustic performance {{of traditional}} material, marked a radical turn around in the fortunes of the tradition. This was reflected in the adoption creation of the BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards in 2000, which gave the music a much needed status and focus and the profile of folk music is as high in England <b>today</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> has been for over thirty years.|$|E

25|$|Audleya large, {{flat area}} {{at the base of}} one of the larger valleys in the park. The main road into the park from the north drops quickly from the heights to Audley, where it crosses the Hacking River on a weir before {{climbing}} up {{the other side of the}} valley to continue further into the park. Audley was developed in the late 19th century as a picnic area for Sydneysiders on a day trip. A large, heritage listed timber boathouse from that time still exists on the western bank of the weir and currently rents rowing boats and canoes to allow leisurely exploration of the upper reaches of the river. It also rents mountain bikes. A timber dance hall built in the early 20th century on the eastern bank is available for functions. Large picnic areas, grassy meadows and a café, rest rooms and a colony of hungry ducks complete the picnic picture. Audley is as popular with families <b>today</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> was in the 19th century.

500|$|The Swedish {{botanist}} Carl Linnaeus (1707–1778) {{ushered in}} a new era of taxonomy. With his major works Systema Naturae 1st Edition in 1735, Species Plantarum in 1753, and Systema Naturae 10th Edition, he revolutionized modern taxonomy. His works implemented a standardized binomial naming system for animal and plant species, which proved to be an elegant solution to a chaotic and disorganized taxonomic literature. He not only introduced the standard of class, order, genus, andspecies, but also made it possible to identify plants and animals from his book, by using the smaller parts of the flower. Thus the Linnaean system was born, and is still used in essentially the same way <b>today</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> was in the 18th century. Currently, plant and animal taxonomists regard Linnaeus' work as the [...] "starting point" [...] for valid names (at 1753 and 1758 respectively).
