5|$|However, a close {{examination}} of the excavated tracks may give a more differentiated picture. While there is agreement that <b>the</b> <b>grooves</b> {{in the eastern part}} were cut deliberately into the stone slabs to guide cart wheels, those in the western section are interpreted by some authors as a result of wear or do not appear at all. On the other hand, the marked cambers of this road section may point at deliberate tracks as well. Generally, varying forms of <b>the</b> <b>grooves</b> can also be explained by the long period of operation of the Diolkos, during which modifications and repairs must have significantly changed the appearance of the trackway.|$|E

5|$|Like most brown algae, Postelsia {{goes through}} {{alternation}} of generations, {{and is an}} annual species. The diploid sporophyte produces, through meiosis, haploid spores, which drip down through <b>the</b> <b>grooves</b> in the blades onto the substrate, which may be mussels, barnacles, or bare rock. These spores develop, through mitosis, into small, multicellular haploid gametophytes, male and female. The male and female gametophytes create sperm and eggs, respectively. The sperm of the male reaches the female egg and fertilizes, resulting in a diploid zygote, which develops into a new sporophyte.|$|E
50|$|The name In <b>the</b> <b>Groove</b> {{refers to}} three {{different}} things: the arcade {{version of the}} game In <b>the</b> <b>Groove,</b> <b>the</b> PlayStation 2 and PC version of the game, and the brand name of the franchise itself. In <b>the</b> <b>Groove</b> 2 is <b>the</b> second game in this franchise. An In <b>the</b> <b>Groove</b> 3 was planned but canceled, due to a lawsuit with Konami.|$|R
50|$|The {{music of}} In <b>the</b> <b>Groove</b> {{includes}} 136 songs for arcade and home releases. A few additional songs were confirmed {{to be present}} in the now-cancelled In <b>the</b> <b>Groove</b> 3. Some artists are common to Dance Dance Revolution. In fact, a few song revivals can be found in In <b>the</b> <b>Groove,</b> but with different stepcharts.|$|R

5|$|While early incense seals {{were made}} of wood or stone, the Chinese {{gradually}} introduced disks made of metal, most likely beginning during the Song dynasty. This allowed craftsmen to more easily create {{both large and small}} seals, as well as design and decorate them more aesthetically. Another advantage was the ability to vary the paths of <b>the</b> <b>grooves,</b> to allow for the changing length of the days in the year. As smaller seals became more readily available, the clocks grew in popularity among the Chinese, and were often given as gifts. Incense seal clocks are often sought by modern-day clock collectors; however, few remain that have not already been purchased or been placed on display at museums or temples.|$|E
5|$|Twin helical strands {{form the}} DNA backbone. Another double helix {{may be found}} tracing the spaces, or grooves, between the strands. These voids are {{adjacent}} to the base pairs and may provide a binding site. As the strands are not symmetrically located with respect to each other, <b>the</b> <b>grooves</b> are unequally sized. One groove, the major groove, is 22Å wide and the other, the minor groove, is 12Å wide. The width of the major groove means that {{the edges of the}} bases are more accessible in the major groove than in the minor groove. As a result, proteins such as transcription factors that can bind to specific sequences in double-stranded DNA usually make contact with the sides of the bases exposed in the major groove. This situation varies in unusual conformations of DNA within the cell (see below), but the major and minor grooves are always named to reflect the differences in size that would be seen if the DNA is twisted back into the ordinary B form.|$|E
25|$|Cylinder phonographs {{generally}} used a {{worm gear}} to move the stylus in synchronization with <b>the</b> <b>grooves</b> of the recording, whereas most disc machines relied on <b>the</b> <b>grooves</b> to pull the stylus along. This resulted in cylinder records played {{a number of times}} having less degradation than discs, but this added mechanism made cylinder machines more expensive.|$|E
40|$|Flows in a {{corrugated}} channel are {{investigated by}} a high-speed {{camera and a}} particle image velocimetry (PIV) system. The bottom wall of the rectangular channel was corrugated with periodic <b>grooves</b> while <b>the</b> top wall and two sidewalls were flat plates made of Plexiglas. Flow visualization data from the high-speed camera determine the critical Reynolds number to be around 1500 by examining {{the stability of the}} vortex in <b>the</b> <b>groove</b> as well as fluid ejection from <b>the</b> <b>groove.</b> <b>The</b> visualization data for turbulent flow also show how a vortex evolves within <b>the</b> <b>groove</b> and triggers another vortex formation in <b>the</b> subsequent <b>groove,</b> and how fluid ejected from <b>the</b> <b>groove</b> triggers another ejection from <b>the</b> subsequent <b>groove.</b> Thus, strong hydrodynamic interactions are observed between successive corrugations. In addition, PIV data provide the profiles of velocities and Reynolds stresses as a function of Reynolds number. Time-averaged streamlines show that a large, stable vortex exists in <b>the</b> <b>groove</b> for laminar flow. On the other hand, for turbulent flow, the vortex is unstable inside <b>the</b> <b>groove,</b> often prompting fluid ejection which interacts with the bulk flow. Especially the Reynolds stress of the square of velocity fluctuation in the direction normal to the bulk flow significantly increases as the fluid ejection from <b>the</b> <b>groove</b> intensifies with increasing Reynolds number...|$|R
50|$|On October 22, 2010, <b>The</b> <b>Groove</b> {{adjusted}} {{its direction}} to include Dance, Disco, and Freestyle classics after Sirius XM removed The Strobe from the roster {{and placed the}} channel online.

50|$|At the 2005 Amusement Showcase International in Chicago, IL, Roxor Games {{announced}} that In <b>the</b> <b>Groove</b> 2 {{would be released}} with its own dedicated cabinet {{as well as an}} upgrade kit for old In <b>The</b> <b>Groove</b> conversion kits. <b>The</b> new cabinet was initially produced by Andamiro, the creators of Pump It Up, another dance-simulation game. However, in 2006 Roxor {{announced that}} they themselves would take over cabinet production for In <b>The</b> <b>Groove</b> 2 dedicated cabinets. In <b>The</b> <b>Groove</b> 2 was also made available as a conversion kit for older Dance Dance Revolution machines. In <b>The</b> <b>Groove</b> 2 features 65 new songs, as well as every song and course from the original release of In <b>The</b> <b>Groove.</b> Although a PlayStation 2 version of ITG2 was never released, the PC version (based on the first game) received a patch adding all the songs from ITG2 plus the new theme.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. As the {{necessary}} information for planning tool path, or determining {{the parameters of}} machining processes, <b>the</b> <b>groove</b> shape of impellers should be extracted exactly. A Z-map based approach is proposed to extract <b>the</b> <b>groove</b> shape of <b>the</b> impeller, which is formed by hub and blades in STL models. The bottom boundaries of <b>the</b> <b>groove</b> surface are computed with its Z-map models and the polygons of <b>the</b> <b>groove</b> surface are selected with the boundaries. An experimental system is implemented and some computational experiments are performed to verify the practical applicability of the approach...|$|R
50|$|In {{the arcade}} version of In <b>the</b> <b>Groove,</b> this song {{can only be}} played in the Energy course in the Marathon game mode. It is an unlockable song in the home version of In <b>the</b> <b>Groove</b> (it can be played as a regular song when {{unlocked}} and isn't exclusive to the Energy course) and is fully playable in the sequel In <b>the</b> <b>Groove</b> 2. It is also used as the game mode selection, song group selection, marathon mode course selection, and option menu music in the home version of the first In <b>the</b> <b>Groove</b> game in <b>the</b> series. It is used as the warning screen music in the PC/Mac version of In <b>the</b> <b>Groove</b> 2. However, in these parts of the game, the song has been clipped.|$|R

25|$|Upon {{contact with}} their ligand, TNF receptors also form trimers, their tips fitting into <b>the</b> <b>grooves</b> formed between TNF monomers. This binding causes a {{conformational}} change {{to occur in the}} receptor, leading to the dissociation of the inhibitory protein SODD from the intracellular death domain. This dissociation enables the adaptor protein TRADD to bind to the death domain, serving as a platform for subsequent protein binding. Following TRADD binding, three pathways can be initiated.|$|E
25|$|A {{lockbolt}} is {{a fastener}} {{similar to a}} bolt in appearance and function. However, instead of using screw threads which connect to a nut using a turning motion, a lockbolt has annular grooves around the shaft of the bolt (pin). After placing the lockbolt in a hole, a threadless collar is forced at high pressures around the annular grooves, deforming the collar and permanently locking it into place around <b>the</b> <b>grooves.</b> Swaging is the generic term for setting a lockbolt and collar assembly. During the installation cycle of a lockbolt, the collar is deformed around the pin with locking grooves using special tooling. The tool engages onto the pintail, which is an extra portion of pin material protruding past the collar that the tool grabs and pulls. This force on the pintail pushes the joint together, and the conically-shaped cavity of the tooling is forced down the collar, which reduces its diameter and progressively swages the collar material into <b>the</b> <b>grooves</b> of the harder pin. As the force required for swaging increases during the process, the installation is finalised when the pintail breaks off.|$|E
25|$|Cutting {{a single}} helical groove into a screw-stock {{cylinder}} yields what {{is referred to}} as a single-thread screw. Similarly, one may construct a double-thread screw provided that the helix angle is the same, and a second thread is cut in the space between <b>the</b> <b>grooves</b> of the first. For certain applications, triple and quadruple threads are in use. The helix may be cut either right hand or left hand. In screws especially, the helix angle is essential for calculating torque in power screw applications.|$|E

25|$|Grooves about 100–300m wide, up to 2.5km long, {{and tens}} of meters deep are seen on Gaspra's surface, which {{may be related to}} Gaspra's {{formation}} {{along with the rest of}} the Flora family in an asteroid collision. Their presence also suggest that it is a single coherent body, rather than a rubble pile. <b>The</b> <b>grooves</b> were likely created by impacts that shattered the underlying rock. A system of much more prominent grooves is seen on the Martian moon Phobos. The pitted appearance of some grooves may suggest that the surface is covered by a regolith.|$|E
25|$|It radically {{altered the}} {{geography}} of North America north of the Ohio River.

In 1894, the conservatory’s surrounding landscaping saw numerous transformations in {{preparations for the}} California Midwinter International Exposition of 1894. The Conservatory again was repainted in 1899 and received new floors of grooved concrete. At this point, the old floors, some of wood and some of concrete, were replaced by new grooved concrete. <b>The</b> <b>grooves</b> in the floor were intended to carry off the surplus water and make {{a visit to the}} conservatory more comfortable and pleasant. Several wooden plant benches that had rotted out were replaced by benches made of concrete wire netting to stand the constant change of temperature better than wood.|$|E

40|$|Using {{classical}} density functional theory, {{the liquid}} crystal (LC) -mediated interaction between a cylindrical nanoparticle and a structured substrate is studied. The surface is structured by cutting a rectangular <b>groove</b> into <b>the</b> surface.
