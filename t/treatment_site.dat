5|$|High-dose rate (HDR) {{brachytherapy}} is {{when the}} rate of dose delivery exceeds 12Gy·h−1.

5|$|Using this information, {{a plan of}} {{the optimal}} {{distribution}} of the radiation sources can be developed. This includes consideration of how the source carriers (applicators), which are used to deliver the radiation to the <b>treatment</b> <b>site,</b> should be placed and positioned. Applicators are non-radioactive and are typically needles or plastic catheters. The specific type of applicator used {{will depend on the}} type of cancer being treated and the characteristics of the target tumour.|$|E
5|$|As the {{radiation}} sources can be precisely positioned at the tumour <b>treatment</b> <b>site,</b> brachytherapy enables a high {{dose of radiation}} {{to be applied to}} a small area. Furthermore, because {{the radiation}} sources are placed in or next to the target tumour, the sources maintain their position in relation to the tumour when the patient moves or if there is any movement of the tumour within the body. Therefore, the radiation sources remain accurately targeted. This enables clinicians to achieve a high level of dose conformity – i.e. ensuring the whole of the tumour receives an optimal level of radiation. It also reduces the risk of damage to healthy tissue, organs or structures around the tumour, thus enhancing the chance of cure and preservation of organ function.|$|E

The main {{aim of this study}} was to assess the response of R. tanezumi following short term removal of R. everetti. We tested this experimentally by trapping and removing R. everetti from two <b>treatment</b> <b>sites</b> in agro-forest habitat on three occasions over three consecutive months. This was followed by three months of non-removal trapping. Two non-treatment sites were trapped for comparison. Following R. everetti removal, R. everetti individuals rapidly immigrated into the <b>treatment</b> <b>sites</b> and a significantly higher proportion of R. tanezumi females were in breeding condition in the <b>treatment</b> <b>sites</b> than in the non-treatment sites.

40|$|Purpose. A dermatopharmacokinetic (DPK) approach, {{in which}} drug {{levels in the}} stratum corneum (SC) are {{measured}} {{as a function of}} time post-application and post-removal of the product using tape-strip sampling in vivo in humans, has been considered for the comparative assessment of topical bioavailability. Its application to-date has been limited by contradictory results and concerns that variability in the method necessitates large numbers of <b>treatment</b> <b>sites</b> and volunteers. The objective {{of this study was to}} test whether a revised protocol could better assess bioequivalence. Methods. A blinded study of three 1 % econazole nitrate cream products, for which the SC is the site of action, was conducted to examine several modifications to the DPK methodology. In addition to protocol changes designed to reduce experimental variability, bioequivalence was assessed at a single uptake time and a single clearance time measured in duplicate in each subject. Results. Conclusive determinations of bioequivalence were achieved with only four <b>treatment</b> <b>sites</b> per product in each of 14 volunteers, which was less than one-third the number required in a previous DPK investigation.

40|$|Introduction: The stroke {{public health}} crisis is {{increasingly}} addressed by regional TeleStroke networks comprised of Hub and Spoke <b>treatment</b> <b>sites.</b> Functional Hub-Spoke (H-S) relationships are fundamental to network success. The {{purpose was to}} report on our experience developing and maintaining H-S relationships, and to propose a H-S relationship model. Methods: Jefferson Neuroscience Network (JNN) was launched in July 2010. By June 2011 it had 1 Hub and 28 Spoke sites across 2 states (PA, NJ), and had performed 836 TeleStroke consultations. Key Hub and Spoke personnel were consulted regarding H-S relationships. Feedback was organized. Results: A Hub team was assembled and trained. Three key steps to developing H-S relationships were identified: Secure Spoke physician and administration commitment; Train Spoke team; Address Spoke-specific obstacles. Two key steps to maintaining H-S relationships were identified: Continual education; Institutionalize bi-directional communication. Specific JNN initiatives are described. The proposed H-S relationship model is a patient-centered, physician-driven, voluntary collaboration between <b>treatment</b> <b>sites.</b> Hubs offer Spokes education, and access to clinical expertise, clinical trials, and {{a higher level of}} care. As a result, Spokes may increase evidence-based practice, become more comfortable administering tPA, experience stroke center accreditation opportunities, and decrease transfer of inappropriate patients. In turn, Spokes offer Hubs community partnership, meaning they choose to solicit Hub expert opinion regarding patient management. As a result, Hubs may increase their community reputation and research opportunities. Furthermore, appropriate patients may be rapidly identified and treated in the community or, if necessary, transferred to comprehensive stroke centers within time constraints. Conclusions: JNN-identified key steps for developing and maintaining H-S relationships may assist other stroke networks to build and sustain relationships between <b>treatment</b> <b>sites.</b> Different <b>treatment</b> <b>sites</b> can collaborate to improve stroke care while simultaneously achieving their own independent goals. Additional practical advice about designing and implementing functional and sustainable TeleStroke programs is needed...|$|R
40|$|The {{concentration}} of sewage at wastewater <b>treatment</b> <b>sites,</b> {{as well as}} the retention and treatment thereof, in facultative and maturation ponds leads to the emission of odorants. Although odour emissions from wastewater sources do not generally cause direct health-related problems, a preliminary study of the existing literature has found that, because odour elicits a physiological response it can cause psychological stress. Furthermore, current legislation defines odours that adversely affect the amenity of an area as environmental nuisance. There is currently a buffer zone around each of the major wastewater <b>treatment</b> <b>sites</b> in the Darwin region. These buffer zones exist to limit development adjacent to wastewater infrastructure sites to reduce the likelihood of odour complaints. Due to the number, and distribution, of recent complaints from residents living near wastewater <b>treatment</b> <b>sites,</b> but outside the buffer zone, it is unclear whether, or not, the extent of current buffer zones is sufficient to minimise the exposure of the surrounding community to odour. The purpose of this thesis is to determine the suitability of current odour buffer zones surrounding wastewater infrastructure in the Darwin region. A combination of three different odour assessment techniques will be used to achieve this. These techniques are: odour dispersion modelling, field olfactometry, and odour complaint mapping. Odour dispersion modelling involved entering meteorological, emission, and terrain data for each site into an odour dispersion model. This was done to develop a probabilistic odour impact assessment of odorants emanating from a defined source. Field olfactometry was undertaken to ground-truth the dispersion model while gaining an empirical understanding of how odour from wastewater <b>treatment</b> <b>sites</b> is affecting the surrounding residents (and generating complaints). Odour complaint mapping is an on-going process involving mapping the location of complaints regarding odour. It was initially used to help to select appropriate testing locations for field olfactometry by examining clusters of complaints...|$|R
