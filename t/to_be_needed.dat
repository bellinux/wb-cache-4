In November, Beilein announced that the team would redshirt Andrew Dakich {{so that he could}} play a fifth year somewhere else. However, a pair of January backcourt injuries caused Dakich's services <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>needed</b> and he played instead of redshirting. D. J.

5|$|The {{impact of}} the First World War {{dramatically}} shifted public perceptions on the propriety of the man's wristwatch, and opened up a mass market in the post-war era. The creeping barrage artillery tactic, developed during the War, required precise synchronization between the artillery gunners and the infantry advancing behind the barrage. Service watches produced during the War were specially designed for the rigours of trench warfare, with luminous dials and unbreakable glass. Wristwatches were also found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>needed</b> {{in the air as}} much as on the ground: military pilots found them more convenient than pocket watches for the same reasons as Santos-Dumont had. The British War Department began issuing wristwatches to combatants from 1917.|$|E
5|$|To date, {{most of the}} {{evaluation}} of possible roles of pesticides in CCD have relied {{on the use of}} surveys submitted by beekeepers, but direct testing of samples from affected colonies seems likely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>needed,</b> especially given the possible role of systemic insecticides such as the neonicotinoid imidacloprid (which are applied to the soil and taken up into the plant's tissues, including pollen and nectar), which may be applied to a crop when the beekeeper is not present. The known effects of imidacloprid on insects, including honey bees, are consistent with the symptoms of CCD; for example, the effects of imidacloprid on termites include apparent failure of the immune system, and disorientation.|$|E

25|$|In 1822, a bill {{to authorize}} the {{collection}} of tolls on the Cumberland Road (which provided for yearly improvements to the road) was vetoed by the President. In an elaborate essay, Monroe set forth his views on the constitutional aspects of a policy of internal improvements. Congress might appropriate money, he admitted, but it could not undertake the construction of national works nor assume jurisdiction over them. For the moment, the drift toward a larger participation {{of the national government}} in internal improvements was stayed. Two years later, Congress authorized the President to institute surveys for such roads and canals as he believed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>needed</b> for commerce and military defense. No one pleaded more eloquently for a larger conception of the functions of the national government than Henry Clay. He called the attention of his hearers to provisions made for coast surveys and lighthouses on the Atlantic seaboard and deplored the neglect of the interior of the country. Of the other presidential candidates, Jackson voted in the Senate for the general survey bill; and Adams left no doubt in the public mind that he did not reflect the narrow views of his section on this issue. Crawford felt the constitutional scruples which were everywhere being voiced in the South, and followed the old expedient of advocating a constitutional amendment to sanction national internal improvements.|$|E

500|$|The Avon has flooded {{several times}} in its {{recorded}} history. These floods include the one in 1799/1800 damaging Pulteney Bridge. Various points along the river including the valley around Freshford {{are at risk of}} fluvial flooding, as a result of sediment entering the river and narrowing the channel. To help cope with this some areas {{on the banks of the}} river are designated as a functional floodplain to cope with increased flow volumes. The potential [...] changes to weather patterns as a result of climate change suggest that further measures are likely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>needed</b> to protect the population from flooding risk. A tidal surge, combined with high water levels from the flooding of the surrounding area caused flooding in the city of Bristol.|$|E

[...] She was given a regular backup slot in Detective Comics starting with issue #384 (February 1969), alternating issues with Robin until issue #404, after which she had the backup slot to herself. Frank Robbins wrote nearly all of these backups, which were penciled first by Gil Kane and later by Don Heck. Barbara Gordon’s Batgirl exceeded the earlier Bat-Girl and Batwoman characters in popularity, and readers requested for her to appear in other titles. Although some readers requested that Batwoman also continue to appear in publication, DC responded to the fan-based acclaim and criticism of the new character in an open letter in Detective Comics #417 (1971), stating: [...] "I'd like {{to say a few words}} about the reaction some readers have to Batgirl. These are readers who remember Batwoman and the other Bat-girls from years back... They were there because romance seemed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>needed</b> in Batman's life.
