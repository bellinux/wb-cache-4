25|$|Definition. The open sets of Â are inverse images k−1(U) of open subsets U of Prim(A). <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>indeed</b> a topology.|$|E
60|$|<b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>indeed</b> an unlooked-for accident, and Dick {{wondered}} {{what they had}} best do.|$|R
60|$|<b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>indeed</b> true, and as Mary {{saw them}} she {{suddenly}} dropped {{her head and}} began to weep.|$|R
5000|$|Carroux {{decided that}} <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>indeed</b> the case, and {{opted for the}} more {{artificial}} Auenland [...] "meadow-land" [...] instead.|$|R
25|$|If <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>indeed</b> not {{coincidental}} {{then the}} inscription {{is not a}} one-dimensional text. Of course this does not give us a decipherment; rather it narrows down the potential decipherments.|$|E
25|$|There is a {{sense that}} the close home life the women/girls have known since {{childhood}} is about to be torn apart. The narrator, the adult Michael, tells us <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>indeed</b> what happens.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{most of the}} Belgic tribal and {{personal}} names recorded are identifiably Gaulish, {{including those of the}} Germani cisrhenani, and <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>indeed</b> also true of the tribes immediately over the Rhine at this time, such as the Tencteri and Usipetes. Surviving inscriptions also indicate that Gaulish was spoken in at least part of Belgic territory.|$|E
60|$|<b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>indeed</b> the case, {{and among}} a similar {{collection}} of helmets, Fergus also had no difficulty in suiting himself.|$|R
60|$|<b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>indeed</b> the fact, and {{a number}} of other single ships dropped in during the next day or two.|$|R
60|$|<b>This</b> <b>was,</b> <b>indeed,</b> {{alarming}} news. And in {{a minute}} the occupants of the hut {{were all in the}} open air.|$|R
25|$|During {{a public}} meeting on Place du Castor on that night, general Charles Stephen Gore {{stepped on the}} hustings and {{dispersed}} the crowd by swearing on his honour that the new constables would be disarmed by morning. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>indeed</b> what occurred, as the new force supposed to act under the orders of Montreal's justices of the peace was demobilized less than 24 hours after being armed.|$|E
25|$|It is {{a common}} {{misconception}} that the MOT inspection provides an irrefutable record of a vehicle's mileage. However, although the mileage is recorded during the test, {{no part of the}} inspection requires the test station to verify that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>indeed</b> the actual mileage. It is merely recorded, and any tampering of an odometer would not be discovered as part of the MOT inspection.|$|E
25|$|Several clay seals {{presenting}} {{an unusual}} nebty name together with Sekhemkhet´s Horus name {{were found at}} the eastern excavation site {{on the island of}} Elephantine. The Egyptologist Jean Pierre Pätznik reads the nebty name as Ren nebty meaning The two ladies are pleased with his name. It is not entirely clear whether <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>indeed</b> Sekhemkhet´s nebty name or that of a yet unknown queen.|$|E
60|$|And <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>indeed</b> {{its only}} object, for that pig was passionately, ludicrously {{fond of the}} fire! It was a pet pig.|$|R
60|$|The Directors {{looked at}} each other. <b>This</b> <b>was,</b> <b>indeed,</b> a very {{remarkable}} story, and one never before brought to the notice of any Board.|$|R
60|$|<b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>indeed</b> {{good news}} to us, and we could hardly find words to express our {{gratitude}} to the chief and to the missionary.|$|R
25|$|Another scholar drew a {{connection}} between the microwave scene and urban legends about pets dying in microwave ovens. He described the portrayal of this urban legend in the film as successful, but that meant it seemed terrible. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>indeed</b> a scene that is thought of as being one of the film's most violent depictions; with even Roger Ebert expressing some fear in his review that the film might encourage children to try similar things with their pets.|$|E
25|$|The film {{then returns}} to the opening time period of the French Revolution. The now-elderly Marquis d'Apcher {{finishes}} writing {{his account of the}} killings, just before he is led to his execution by a revolutionary mob. In the final scene, the Marquis has a flashback, in which he narrates that he does not know what happened to Fronsac and Marianne after the death of the beast; but he hopes that somewhere, they are happy together. Fronsac is shown traveling to Senegal with Marianne {{to start a new life}} together, scattering Mani's ashes at sea. It is left unstated whether the two are alive and happy, or whether <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>indeed</b> the Marquis' dream.|$|E
25|$|The {{existence}} of strong reciprocity implies that systems developed based purely on material self-interest may be missing important motivators in the marketplace. This section gives {{two examples of}} possible implications. One area of application is {{in the design of}} incentive schemes. For example, standard contract theory has difficulty dealing with the degree of incompleteness in contracts and the lack of use of performance measures, even when they are cheap to implement. Strong reciprocity and models based on it suggest that this can be explained by people's willingness to act fairly, even when it is against their material self-interest. Experimental results suggest that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>indeed</b> the case, with participants preferring less complete contracts, and workers willing to contribute a fair amount beyond what would be in their own self-interest.|$|E
50|$|This last {{expedition}} reported finds of {{the remains}} of seaweed-covered walls, these walls indicating buildings some 100 yards long, and they concluded that <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>indeed</b> the palace.|$|R
60|$|<b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>indeed</b> war in {{its most}} picturesque form, a form which, as far as beauty is concerned, has been {{altogether}} altered, and indeed destroyed, by modern arms.|$|R
6000|$|Prince Falkenberg's lips relaxed. There {{were hard}} {{lines at the}} corners of his mouth. Yet if <b>this</b> <b>were</b> <b>indeed</b> a smile, it was no {{pleasant}} thing to look upon! ...|$|R
25|$|Guerrilla warfare {{is often}} {{associated}} with a rural setting, and <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>indeed</b> the case with the definitive operations of Mao and Giap, the mujahadeen of Afghanistan, the Ejército Guerrillero de los Pobres (EGP) of Guatemala, the Contras of Nicaragua, and the FMLN of El Salvador. Guerrillas however have successfully operated in urban settings as demonstrated in places like Argentina and Northern Ireland. In those cases, guerrillas rely on a friendly population to provide supplies and intelligence. Rural guerrillas prefer to operate in regions providing plenty of cover and concealment, especially heavily forested and mountainous areas. Urban guerrillas, rather than melting into the mountains and forests, blend into the population and are also dependent on a support base among the people. Removing and destroying guerrillas out of both types of areas can be difficult.|$|E
25|$|Critics {{argue that}} Fairtrade harms all non-Fairtrade farmers. Fairtrade claims that its farmers are paid higher prices and are given special advice on {{increasing}} yields and quality. Economists state that, if <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>indeed</b> so, Fairtrade farmers will increase production. As {{the demand for}} coffee is highly elastic, a small increase in supply means a large fall in market price, so perhaps a million Fairtrade farmers get a higher price and 24 million others get a substantially lower price. Critics quote the example of farmers in Vietnam being paid over the world price in the 1980s, planting lots of coffee, then flooding the world market in the 1990s. The Fairtrade minimum price means that when the world market price collapses, it is the non-Fairtrade farmers, particularly the poorest, who have to cut down their coffee trees. This argument is supported by mainstream economists, not just free marketers.|$|E
25|$|There {{are three}} {{distinctive}} points in Cousin's philosophy. These are his method, {{the results of}} his method, and the application of the method and its results to history, especially to the history of philosophy. It is usual to speak of his philosophy as eclecticism. It is eclectic only in a secondary and subordinate sense. All eclecticism that is not self-condemned and inoperative implies a system of doctrine as its basis, in fact, a criterion of truth. Otherwise, as Cousin himself remarks, it is simply a blind and useless syncretism. And Cousin saw and proclaimed from an early period in his philosophical teaching the necessity of a system on which to base his eclecticism. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>indeed</b> advanced as an illustration or confirmation of the truth of his system, as a proof that the facts of history correspond to his analysis of consciousness. These three points, the method, the results, and the philosophy of history, are with him intimately connected. They are developments in a natural order of sequence. They become in practice Psychology, Ontology and Eclecticism in history.|$|E
60|$|<b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>indeed</b> a find {{of immense}} importance, and the {{assembled}} party discussed {{the event in}} all its bearings till their mouths were partially stopped by pork and pancakes.|$|R
60|$|<b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>indeed</b> true; so all {{the people}} {{sat down in a}} circle around the Cast-iron Man and thought upon the matter intently for the space of an hour.|$|R

25|$|The {{development}} of Chinese poetry does not correspond precisely with the conventional dating of Chinese history by dynasty, despite certain correspondences between {{the political and}} poetic trends, with the period of actual transition between dynasties is especially problematic. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>indeed</b> the case in discussing the important poets in the late Han and early Six Dynasties period, including the famous general Cao Cao (155-220), who may be reckoned in this period, although actually beginning {{his career in the}} Later/Eastern Han era. That is, the final years at the End of the Han Dynasty and during which the Cao family was rising, or risen, to prominence were known as the Jian'an era (196-220). The Jian'an was technically a Han dynasty Chinese era name referring approximately to the years 196–220, during the nominal reign of Emperor Xian of Han, during the End of the Han dynasty. The following major period is known as the Three Kingdoms era, due to the three kingdoms which succeeded the Han Dynasty, and proceeded to vie with one another for succession to the Han empire. These 3 successor states are Wei (also known as Cao Wei, 220–265), Shu, (also known as Shu Han, 221–263) and Wu (also known as Eastern Wu or Sun Wu, 229–280). The jian'an poetry merges with early the early Six Dynasty poetry of the early Three Kingdoms, both in terms of style and in some cases the actual poets, although the plague epidemic of 217-218 killed 4 of the 7 Masters of Jian'an, and mortality rates were high otherwise, in some cases risk being associated with what someone wrote.|$|E

500|$|After {{the battle}}, Frederick {{reportedly}} said: [...] "I {{won the battle}} of Rossbach with most of my infantry having their muskets shouldered." [...] <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>indeed</b> true: less than five percent of his entire force had been engaged. [...] Frederick had discovered the use of operational maneuvers and with a fraction of his entire force3,500 horsemen, 18 artillery pieces, and three battalions of infantryhad defeated army {{of two of the}} strongest European powers. Frederick's tactics at Rossbach became a landmark {{in the history of the}} military arts.|$|E
