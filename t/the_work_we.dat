Melua revealed during an interview with The Guardian that her partnership with Mike Batt had come to an end after her last album, as it was a six-album deal with Batt's Dramatico records. [...] "It was a six-album deal,” she explains, “so when the sixth one was done, you know – it was finished and it was time for us to part ways.....It was maybe a bit more mutual on one side than the other.

Speaking about the post-production process in January 2016, the Russo brothers said, [...] "This has been the easiest post process we've ever had on a film. We're very happy with how the movie was. Everyone is very happy with where the movie was. For us, the tricky thing is the effects because it's a very complicated movie and there are some really big sequences in the film. The effects are on a much larger scale than <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>we</b> did on Winter Soldier. That's the part that becomes really difficult because you don't have a lot of time and everyone has very high standards. So everyone starts killing themselves at this point...we'll be done with the movie in two and a half months."

It's an energy and it looks fresh. It has a certain vibe with it and it makes sense." [...] She also went on to describe the set as [...] "grimy and gross [...] It was sweat and it was disgusting sometimes". At a point in the shoot, Spears changed her heels to Ugg boots during the shots that did not show her feet, stating that [...] " [...] hurts ... but it looks good. It wasn't a full-length shot, so a girl's about comfort when it's not showing."
