50|$|<b>Troglitazone</b> is a ligand to both PPARα and - more {{strongly}} - PPARγ. <b>Troglitazone</b> also contains an α-tocopheroyl moiety, potentially giving it vitamin E-like activity {{in addition to}} its PPAR activation. It has been shown to reduce inflammation: <b>troglitazone</b> use was associated with a decrease of nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) and a concomitant increase in its inhibitor (IκB). NFκB is an important cellular transcription regulator for the immune response.|$|E
5000|$|Since the {{withdrawal}} in 2000, mechanisms of <b>troglitazone</b> hepatotoxicity have been extensively studied {{using a variety}} of in vivo, in vitro and computational methods. [...] These studies have suggested that hepatotoxicity of <b>troglitazone</b> results from a combination of nonmetabolic and metabolic factors. [...] The nonmetabolic toxicity is a complex function of drug-protein interactions in the liver and biliary system. Initially the metabolic toxicity was largely associated with reactive metabolite formation from the thiazolidinedione and chromane rings of <b>troglitazone.</b> Moreover, the formation of quinone and o-quinone methide reactive metabolites were proposed to be formed by metabolic oxidation of the OH group of the chromane ring. [...] Detailed quantum chemical analysis of the metabolic pathways for <b>troglitazone</b> has shown that quinone reactive metabolite is generated by oxidation of the OH group, but o-quinone methide reactive metabolite is formed by the oxidation of the methyl (CH3) groups ortho to the OH group of the chromane ring. [...] This understanding has been recently used in the design of novel <b>troglitazone</b> derivatives with antiproliferative activity in breast cancer cell lines.|$|E

50|$|The {{withdrawal}} of <b>troglitazone</b> {{has led to}} concerns of the other thiazolidinediones also increasing the incidence of hepatitis and potential liver failure, an approximately 1 in 20,000 individual occurrence with <b>troglitazone.</b> Because of this, the FDA recommends two to three month checks of liver enzymes {{for the first year}} of thiazolidinedione therapy to check for this rare but potentially catastrophic complication.

5000|$|<b>Troglitazone</b> (Rezulin, Resulin, Romozin, Noscal) is an {{antidiabetic}} and anti-inflammatory drug, and {{a member}} of the drug class of the thiazolidinediones.

In the United States, it was introduced and manufactured by Parke-Davis in the late 1990s, but turned out to be associated with an idiosyncratic reaction leading to drug-induced hepatitis. The F.D.A. medical officer assigned to evaluate <b>troglitazone,</b> John Gueriguian, did not recommend its approval due to potential high liver toxicity; Parke-Davis complained to the FDA and Gueriguian was subsequently removed from his post. A full panel of experts approved it in January 1997. [...] Once the prevalence of adverse liver effects became known, <b>troglitazone</b> was withdrawn from the British market in December 1997, from the United States market in 2000, and from the Japanese market soon afterwards.

5000|$|On May 17, 1998, a 55-year-old patient named Audrey LaRue Jones died {{of acute}} liver failure after taking <b>troglitazone.</b> Importantly, {{she had been}} {{monitored}} closely by physicians at the National Institutes of Health as {{a participant in the}} National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) diabetes prevention study. This called into question the efficacy of the monitoring strategy. The N.I.H. responded on June 4 by dropping <b>troglitazone</b> from the study. Dr. David J. Graham, an F.D.A. epidemiologist charged with evaluating the drug, warned on March 26, 1999 of the dangers of using it and concluded that patient monitoring was not effective in protecting against liver failure. He estimated that the drug could be linked to over 430 liver failures and that patients incurred 1,200 times greater risk of liver failure when taking Rezulin. Dr. Janet B. McGill, an endocrinologist who had assisted in the Warner-Lambert's early clinical testing of Rezulin, wrote in a March 1, 2000 letter to Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.): [...] "I believe that the company [...] [...] [...] deliberately omitted reports of liver toxicity and misrepresented serious adverse events experienced by patients in their clinical studies." ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Troglitazone</b> was {{developed}} {{as the first}} anti-diabetic drug having a mechanism of action involving the enhancement of insulin sensitivity.

50|$|Forced CD97 {{expression}} induced cell migration, activated proteolytic matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), {{and enhanced}} secretion of the chemokines interleukin (IL)-8. Tumor suppressor microRNA-126, often downregulated in cancer, {{was found to}} target CD97 thereby modulating cancer progression. CD97 can heterodimerize with the LPAR1, a canonical GPCR that is implied in tumor progression, to modulate synergistic functions and LPA-mediated Rho signaling. It {{has been shown that}} CD97 regulates localization and degradation of β-catenin. GSK-3β, inhibited in some cancer, regulates the stability of β-catenin in cytoplasm and subsequently, cytosolic β-catenin moves into the nucleus to facilitate expression of pro-oncogenic genes. Because of its role in tumor invasion and angiogenesis, CD97 is a potential therapeutic target. Several treatments reduce CD97 expression in tumor cells such as cytokine tumor growth factor (TGF)β as well as the compounds sodium butyrate, retinoic acid, and <b>troglitazone.</b> Taken together, experimental evidence indicates that CD97 plays multiple roles in tumor progress.|$|E
50|$|A Phase IV {{trial is}} also known as postmarketing {{surveillance}} trial, or informally as a confirmatory trial. Phase IV trials involve the safety surveillance (pharmacovigilance) and ongoing technical support of a drug after it receives permission to be sold (e.g. after approval under the FDA Accelerated Approval Program). Phase IV studies may be required by regulatory authorities or may be undertaken by the sponsoring company for competitive (finding a new market for the drug) or other reasons (for example, the drug may not have been tested for interactions with other drugs, or on certain population groups such as pregnant women, who are unlikely to subject themselves to trials). The safety surveillance is designed to detect any rare or long-term adverse effects over a much larger patient population and longer time period than was possible during the Phase I-III clinical trials. Harmful effects discovered by Phase IV trials may result in a drug being no longer sold, or restricted to certain uses; recent examples involve cerivastatin (brand names Baycol and Lipobay), <b>troglitazone</b> (Rezulin) and rofecoxib (Vioxx). The minimum time period mandatory for Phase IV clinical trials is 2 years.|$|E
50|$|Fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase {{is also a}} {{key player}} in {{treating}} type 2 diabetes. In this disease, hyperglycemia causes many serious problems, and treatments often focus on lowering blood sugar levels. Gluconeogenesis in the liver is a major cause of glucose overproduction in these patients, and so inhibition of gluconeogenesis is a reasonable way to treat type 2 diabetes. FBPase is a good enzyme to target in the gluconeogenesis pathway because it is rate-limiting and controls the incorporation of all three-carbon substrates into glucose but is not involved in glycogen breakdown and is removed from mitochondrial steps in the pathway. This means that altering its activity can have a large effect on gluconeogenesis while reducing the risk of hypoglycemia and other potential side effects from altering other enzymes in gluconeogenesis. In 1993, two East Asian plants that were known to have hypoglycemic effects were tested on rats. Both resulted in lowered levels of FBPase and therefore reduced gluconeogenesis and lowered blood sugar. Two years later, a drug called <b>Troglitazone</b> (shown below) that also targets FBPase was successfully tested on mice and resulted in suppressed gluconeogenesis. More recently, drugs been developed that mimic the inhibitory activity of AMP (shown below) on FBPase, though the first such drug caused dangerous side effects. Efforts were made to mimic the allosteric inhibitory effects of AMP while making the drug as structurally different from it as possible. Second-generation FBPase inhibitors have now been developed and have had good results in clinical trials with non-human mammals and now humans. These second-generation FBPase inhibitors could soon be good candidates for treating type 2 diabetes.|$|E
40|$|<b>Troglitazone</b> is a ligand for the {{peroxisome}} proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) that decreases {{growth of}} human prostate cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. However, the {{mechanism by which}} <b>troglitazone</b> reduces prostate cancer cell growth is not fully understood. To understand the signaling pathways involved in troglitazone-induced decreases in prostate cancer growth, we examined the effect of <b>troglitazone</b> on androgen-independent C 4 - 2 human prostate cancer cells. Initial experiments revealed <b>troglitazone</b> inhibited C 4 - 2 cell proliferation by arresting cells in the G 0 /G 1 phase of the cell cycle and inducing apoptosis. Since the proto-oncogene product c-Myc regulates both apoptosis and cell cycle progression, we next examined whether <b>troglitazone</b> altered expression of c-Myc. <b>Troglitazone</b> decreased c-Myc protein levels as well as expression of downstream targets of c-Myc in a dose-dependent manner. In C 4 - 2 cells, troglitazone-induced decreases in c-Myc protein involve proteasome-mediated degradation of c-Myc protein as well as reductions in c-Myc mRNA levels. It appears that <b>troglitazone</b> stimulates degradation of c-Myc by increasing c-Myc phosphorylation, for the level of phosphorylated c-Myc was elevated in prostate cancer cells exposed to <b>troglitazone.</b> While <b>troglitazone</b> dramatically decreased the amount of c-Myc within C 4 - 2 cells, the PPARγ ligands ciglitazone, rosiglitazone and pioglitazone did not reduce c-Myc protein levels. Furthermore the downregulation of c-Myc by <b>troglitazone</b> was not blocked by the PPARγ antagonist GW 9662 and siRNA-mediated decreases in PPARγ protein. Thus, our data suggest that <b>troglitazone</b> reduces c-Myc protein independently of PPARγ...|$|E
40|$|In January 1997 a drug {{from a new}} {{pharmacological}} class, the thiazolidinediones, became available: <b>troglitazone.</b> <b>Troglitazone</b> indirectly enhances peripheral insulin sensitivity. In {{this way}} it lowers the levels of both glucose and insulin. <b>Troglitazone</b> also has a lowering effect on the levels of triglycerides. In clinical trials only mild side effects had been observed. Therefore, <b>troglitazone</b> seemed a promising drug. Recently, however, {{it became clear that}} <b>troglitazone</b> could cause liver dysfunction in some patients. Although this side effect is reversible in most cases, six deaths have been described due to liver damage. <b>Troglitazone</b> was to be introduced in Europe in 1998 but registration procedures and clinical trials have been stopped because of its side effects on the liver. In the United States and Japan <b>troglitazone</b> is still being used, albeit with extra precautions. <b>Troglitazone</b> is a valuable addition to the arsenal of antidiabetic drugs for type 2 diabetes. It can be particularly useful, both as an additive and as a replacement, in patients for whom metformin is not suitable because of contraindications or side effects.

40|$|<b>Troglitazone</b> lowers {{blood glucose}} levels in Type II {{diabetic}} patients. To evaluate the insulin sensitizing action of <b>troglitazone</b> on glycogen synthesis {{we have used}} dexamethasone-treated 3 T 3 adipocytes as an in vitro model. Differentiated 3 T 3 adipocytes were incubated with 100 [*]nM dexamethasone for 6 days. <b>Troglitazone</b> (1. 0 [*]μM) or metformin (1. 0 [*]mM) with or without 200 [*]nM insulin was added during the last 4 days. At the end, insulin (100 [*]nM) stimulated glycogen synthesis was determined using 14 C-glucose. Dexamethasone caused a 50 % reduction in glycogen synthesis. <b>Troglitazone</b> caused an approximately 3 fold increase in glycogen synthesis from 43. 9 ± 3. 4 to 120 ± 16. 2 [*]nmols[*]h− 1. Under identical conditions metformin had no significant effect. When cells were incubated with <b>troglitazone</b> and dexamethasone simultaneously for 6 days, <b>troglitazone</b> but not metformin completely prevented dexamethasone-induced insulin resistance. RU 486 (1. 0 [*]μM) also completely prevented the insulin resistance. Chronic incubation with dexamethasone and insulin resulted in a 73 % reduction in glycogen synthesis. In these adipocytes, <b>troglitazone</b> was partially active with glycogen synthesis rising from 23. 1 ± 3. 0 to 44. 4 ± 4. 5 [*]nmol[*]h− 1, P< 0. 01 while metformin was inactive. <b>Troglitazone</b> stimulated 2 -deoxyglucose uptake by 2 – 3 fold in dexamethasone-treated adipocytes. Metformin also increased glucose uptake significantly. <b>Troglitazone</b> did not affect insulin binding while a 2 fold increase was observed in normal adipocytes where it exhibited a modest effect. Since the effect of <b>troglitazone</b> was greater in dexamethasone-treated adipocytes, <b>troglitazone</b> is likely to act by preventing dexamethasone-induced alterations which may include (i) binding to glucocorticoid receptor and (ii) effect on glucose uptake.

40|$|<b>Troglitazone,</b> an insulin {{sensitizing}} agent, has {{a direct}} positive inotropic effect. However, the mechanism of this effect remains unclear. Thus, we examined the inotropic effect of <b>troglitazone</b> while focusing on intracellular Ca 2 + handling. <b>Troglitazone</b> significantly increased peak isovolumic left ventricular pressure (LVPmax), peak rate of rise of LVP (dP/dtmax), peak rate of fall of LVP (dP/dtmin) in isolated rat hearts perfused at a constant coronary flow and heart rate. This inotropic effect of <b>troglitazone</b> was not inhibited by pretreatment with carbachol (muscarine receptor agonist), H 89 (protein kinase A inhibitor), U 73122 (phospholipase C inhibitor), H 7 (protein kinase C inhibitor), verapamil (L-type Ca 2 + channel antagonist), thapsigargin (Ca 2 +-adenosine triphosphatase inhibitor) or ryanodine (ryanodine receptor opener). Radioimmunoassay showed that the cyclic adenosine monophosphate concentration in the left ventricle was not increased by <b>troglitazone.</b> Whole-cell patch clamp analysis revealed that <b>troglitazone</b> {{had no effect on}} inward Ca 2 + currents in cardiomyocytes. In fura- 2 loaded perfused rat hearts, <b>troglitazone</b> exerted its positive inotropic effect without increasing Ca 2 + concentration. These results suggest that neither the inward Ca 2 + currents nor Ca 2 + handling in the sarcoplasmic reticulum was involved in the inotropic effect of <b>troglitazone.</b> Furthermore, <b>troglitazone</b> exerted its positive inotropic effect without affecting the intracellular concentration of Ca 2 +.
