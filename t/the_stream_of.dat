5|$|Like {{most other}} molluscs, the {{excretory}} organs of bivalves are {{a pair of}} nephridia. Each of these consists of a long, looped, glandular tube, which opens into the body cavity just beneath the heart, and a bladder to store urine. The pericardial glands either line the auricles of the heart or attach to the pericardium, and serve as extra filtration organs. Metabolic waste is voided from the bladders through a pair of openings {{near the front of}} {{the upper part of the}} mantle cavity, from where it joins <b>the</b> <b>stream</b> <b>of</b> exhalant water.|$|E

5|$|The hilly {{area around}} Aarhus {{consists}} of a moranial plateau from the last ice age, broken by a complex system of tunnel valleys. The most prominent valleys of this network are the Aarhus Valley in the south, stretching inland east-west with the Aarhus River, Brabrand Lake, Årslev Lake and Tåstrup Lake, and the Egå Valley to the north, with <b>the</b> <b>stream</b> <b>of</b> Egåen, the bog of Geding-Kasted Mose and Geding Lake. Most parts of the two valleys have been drained and subsequently farmed, {{but in the early}} 2000s some of the drainage was removed and parts of the wetlands were restored for environmental reasons. The valley system also includes <b>the</b> <b>stream</b> <b>of</b> Lyngbygård Å in the west and valleys to the south of the city, following erosion channels from the pre-quaternary. By contrast, the Aarhus River Valley and the Giber River Valley are late glacial meltwater valleys. The coastal cliffs along the Bay of Aarhus consist of shallow tertiary clay from the Eocene and Oligocene (57 to 24 million years ago).|$|E
5|$|Logging was Seattle's {{first major}} industry, {{but by the}} late 19th century, the city had become a {{commercial}} and shipbuilding center as a gateway to Alaska during the Klondike Gold Rush. Growth after World War II was partially due to the local Boeing company, which established Seattle as a center for aircraft manufacturing. The Seattle area developed as a technology center beginning in the 1980s, with companies like Microsoft becoming established in the region. Internet retailer Amazon was founded in Seattle in 1994. <b>The</b> <b>stream</b> <b>of</b> new software, biotechnology, and Internet companies led to an economic revival, which increased the city's population by almost 50,000 between 1990 and 2000.|$|E
