30|$|Over the years, {{there has}} been much debate over whether to use TDD or FDD. In the light of CBF and <b>this</b> <b>paper’s</b> {{proposed}} designs, it becomes clear that the ability of TDD to support channel soundings in the reverse direction is a great underused advantage. We envision that this ability will be a key for implementing and fully harnessing the benefits of other MIMO techniques as well. As both LTE and wireless interoperability for microwave access (WiMAX) utilize TDD, the newly proposed C-RAN network [22 – 24] also utilizes TDD. It may not be long before reverse channel sounding enabled MIMO techniques, such as <b>this</b> <b>paper’s</b> proposed designs, are employed.|$|R
