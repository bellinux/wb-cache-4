[...] He later bluntly {{concluded}} that [...] "it's the only episode that I kind of wish we hadn't done." ...|$|E
500|$|Scotland Yard {{published}} facsimiles of the [...] "Dear Boss" [...] {{letter and}} the postcard on , in the ultimately vain hope {{that someone would}} recognise the handwriting. Charles Warren explained {{in a letter to}} Godfrey Lushington, Permanent Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department: [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> thing a hoax but of course we are bound to try & ascertain the writer in any case." [...] On [...] 1888, George R. Sims in the Sunday newspaper Referee implied scathingly that the letter was written by a journalist [...] "to hurl the circulation of a newspaper sky high". Police officials later claimed to have identified a specific journalist as the author of both the [...] "Dear Boss" [...] letter and the postcard. The journalist was identified as Tom Bullen in a letter from Chief Inspector John Littlechild to George R. Sims dated [...] 1913. A journalist called Fred Best reportedly confessed in 1931 that he and a colleague at The Star had written the letters signed [...] "Jack the Ripper" [...] to heighten interest in the murders and [...] "keep the business alive".|$|E

500|$|The {{top three}} drivers {{appeared}} on the podium to collect their trophies and in a later press conference. Buemi was delighted with the race victory, praising his team for their work and hoped his recent form would continue into the season's following rounds. His team was concerned over his battery overheating; Buemi stated that he drove cautiously {{in the first few}} laps to know where he was and that he had the entire car package under control. Second-place finisher Vergne stated that he was [...] "very happy" [...] because of his team being recently new having had no prior testing of his car and all new personnel and equipment. He said he corrected the problems he had in the season's first two races and felt certain that he would place his focus into winning races: [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> team did a fantastic job, working really, really hard, sometimes many hours overnight and in the end it paid off." [...] Di Grassi, who finished in third, said {{that it was a good}} day for his team although he acknowledged that he was not on the same pace levels as the e.Dams-Renault cars. He revealed that his first car had a large amount of oversteer and stated every smallest change would make a large difference in terms of the championship.|$|E
500|$|In 2005, {{a promotional}} video that {{involves}} SpongeBob promoting diversity and tolerance was criticized by two U.S. Christian evangelical groups, most notably Focus on the Family, {{because they saw}} the character was being used as an advocate for homosexuality though the video contained [...] "no reference to sex, sexual lifestyle or sexual identity." [...] The incident led to questions {{as to whether or}} not SpongeBob, his best friend Patrick, and the rest of the series' characters are homosexual characters. After this speculation and comments, Hillenburg repeated his assertion that sexual preference was never considered during the creation of the show. He clarified the issue and said [...] "We never intended them to be gay. I consider them to be almost asexual. We're just trying to be funny and this has got nothing to do with the show." [...] Tom Kenny and other production members were shocked and surprised that such an issue had arisen. Derek Drymon, the show's creative director until 2004, said, [...] "If SpongeBob holds hands with Patrick it's because he's his best friend and he loves him. I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> thing is a part of a larger agenda to stigmatize gay people." [...] Focus on the Family founder James Dobson later stated that his comments were taken out of context and that his original complaints were not with SpongeBob or any of the characters in the video but with the organization that sponsored the video, the We Are Family Foundation. Dobson noted that the foundation had posted pro-homosexual material on its website, but later removed it.|$|E

Because the great champion of the opponents of liberty, namely communism, had to find some other place to go and they basically went into the environmental movement." [...] At the Heartland Institute's sixth International Conference on Climate Change Schmitt said that climate change was a stalking horse for National Socialism.|$|E

2500|$|After Christopher had {{performed}} this service for some time, {{a little child}} asked him to take him across the river. During the crossing, the river became swollen and the child seemed as heavy as lead, so much that Christopher could scarcely carry him and found himself in great difficulty. When he finally reached the other side, {{he said to the}} child: [...] "You have put me in the greatest danger. I do not <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> world could have been as heavy on my shoulders as you were." [...] The child replied: [...] "You had on your shoulders not only the whole world but Him who made it. I am Christ your king, whom you are serving by this work." [...] The child then vanished.|$|E

I hate their program, their fans. I hate everything. It felt really good to send those guys home." [...] When {{asked for a}} clarification and if he really hated Utah, he continued, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> university and their fans and the organization is [...] classless. They threw beer on my family and stuff last year and did {{a whole bunch of}} nasty things. I don't respect them and they deserved to lose." [...] During the game, Hall had 12 completions out of 32 pass attempts for 134 yards. He had two touchdown passes and no interceptions.|$|E
2500|$|Rear-Admiral Sir William Symonds {{noted that}} after the ship's launch she was [...] "cut down" [...] and made a safe and fast ship.

In 1651 she was again made more {{manoeuvrable}} by reducing upperworks after which she was described as [...] "a delicate frigate (I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> world hath not her like)". She served throughout the wars of the Commonwealth and became the flagship of General at Sea Robert Blake. She was involved in all of the great English naval conflicts fought against the United Provinces and France and was referred to as 'The Golden Devil' (den Gulden Duvel) by the Dutch.|$|E

2500|$|Ogilby's murder caused {{widespread}} revulsion {{and shock}} throughout Northern Ireland, {{even though it}} had taken place during the most turbulent period of the Troubles when bombings and sectarian killings had become commonplace. Protestants were especially appalled that Ogilby, herself a Protestant, had become a victim of loyalist violence and angrily denounced the UDA. Journalist Ciarán Barnes described it as being one of the most brutal murders of the Troubles; adding that its sheer savagery {{and the fact that it}} was carried out by women against another woman within earshot of her child left a lasting impression upon the public psyche. The UDA leadership had not sanctioned the killing; and there was general condemnation from the UDA prisoners inside the Maze Prison. According to Ian S. Wood, the UDA's commander Andy Tyrie had not sufficient control over the many units that comprised the UDA to have been able to prevent the punishment beating from being carried out. A spokesman for the UDA released a statement condemning the killing and the women's unit that carried it out which was first published in the Irish Times on 8 February 1975:"We have completely disowned them [...] We <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> affair was foul and sickening. Ogilby was cleared by the UDA of an allegation about her private life long before she was killed. The killing was an act of jealousy by a group of women." ...|$|E
2500|$|Regarding the album's title, Welch told MTV News, [...] "It {{was an art}} {{installation}} done in the '70s, {{this video}} piece all done on Super 8, this big procession of kind of coquette-style hippies and all these different colored robes and masks, {{and it was all}} to do with color, really saturated, brightly colored pastas and balloons. I saw it a couple years ago, and it was called 'Ceremonials' and then, like, Roman numerals after it. And the word sort of stuck with me, and I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> idea of performance, and kind of putting on this outfit and going out almost to find some sort of exorcism or absolution, to kind of get outside yourself, there's a sense of ceremony to it." [...] Welch also revealed that she wanted to call the album Violence, stating, [...] "I wanted to make an album that sounded like the soundtrack to Baz Luhrmann's Romeo + Juliet, the violence mixed with the classical Shakespearean drama mixed with the pop and the pulp, extreme neon stuff." [...] In an interview with The Guardian, she described the album as [...] "much bigger" [...] and categorised its genre as [...] "chamber soul", a mixture of chamber pop and soul. The liner notes of Ceremonials contain an essay by English writer Emma Forrest, dated 21 September 2011.|$|E
