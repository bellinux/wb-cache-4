40|$|Patients with {{hepatitis}} C virus (HCV) -related cirrhosis are at {{a higher}} risk {{for the development of}} hepatic failure and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) compared with non-cirrhotic patients. Antiviral <b>therapies</b> <b>for</b> HCV-related cirrhosis may reduce the incidence of HCC and hepatic failure. This article introduces current antiviral <b>therapies</b> <b>for</b> HCV-related cirrhosis: P/R, DAA+P/R, and IFN-free regimens, and summarizes the present situation of antiviral <b>therapies</b> <b>for</b> HCV-related cirrhosis. It is thought that the advent of direct-acting antivirals has improved the rate of sustained virologic response and reduced the incidence of adverse events during the treatment of HCV-related cirrhosis. Interferon-free regimens have great advantage and potential in antiviral <b>therapies</b> <b>for</b> HCV-related cirrhosis...|$|R

40|$|Despite {{significant}} progress {{in the development of}} <b>therapies</b> <b>for</b> relapsing MS, progressive MS remains comparatively disappointing. Our objective, in this paper, is to review the current challenges in developing <b>therapies</b> <b>for</b> progressive MS and identify key priority areas for research. A collaborative was convened by volunteer and staff leaders from several MS societies with the mission to expedite the development of effective disease-modifying and symptom management <b>therapies</b> <b>for</b> progressive forms of multiple sclerosis. Through a series of scientific and strategic planning meetings, the collaborative identified and developed new perspectives on five key priority areas for research: experimental models, identification and validation of targets and repurposing opportunities, proof-of-concept clinical trial strategies, clinical outcome measures, and symptom management and rehabilitation. Our conclusions, tackling the impediments in developing <b>therapies</b> <b>for</b> progressive MS will require an integrated, multi-disciplinary approach to enable effective translation of research into <b>therapies</b> <b>for</b> progressive MS. Engagement of the MS research community through an international effort is needed to address and fund these research priorities with the ultimate goal of expediting the development of disease-modifying and symptom-relief treatments for progressive MS...|$|R

Systemic treatment is {{usually reserved for}} severe disease due {{to the risk of}} adverse side effects associated with many of these agents. A systematic review found that no single systemic intervention was found to be effective. Good oral hygiene is important to prevent secondary infection of the ulcers.|$|E

The synthetic pyrethroid insecticide Phenothrin {{in combination with}} the hormone analogue methoprene was a popular topical flea and tick <b>therapy</b> <b>for</b> felines.

5|$|As {{attachment}} theory {{offers a}} broad, far-reaching {{view of human}} functioning, it can enrich a therapist's understanding of patients and the therapeutic relationship rather than dictate a particular form of treatment. Some forms of psychoanalysis-based <b>therapy</b> <b>for</b> adults—within relational psychoanalysis and other approaches—also incorporate attachment theory and patterns. In {{the first decade of}} the 21st century, key concepts of attachment were incorporated into existing models of behavioural couple therapy, multidimensional family therapy and couple and family therapy. Specifically attachment-centred interventions have been developed, such as attachment-based family therapy and emotionally focused therapy.|$|E

5|$|Cancer is {{a change}} in the {{cellular}} processes that cause a tumour to grow out of control. Cancerous cells sometimes have mutations in oncogenes, such as KRAS and CTNNB1 (β-catenin). Analysing the molecular signature of cancerous cellsthe DNA and its levels of expression via messenger RNAenables physicians to characterise the cancer and to choose the best <b>therapy</b> <b>for</b> their patients. As of 2010, assays that incorporate an array of antibodies against specific protein marker molecules are an emerging technology; there are hopes for these multiplex assays that could measure many markers at once. Other potential future biomarkers include micro RNA molecules, which cancerous cells express more of than healthy ones.|$|E
5|$|Complementary therapies {{have been}} {{investigated}} for treating people with acne. Low-quality evidence suggests topical application of tea tree oil or bee venom may reduce {{the total number of}} skin lesions in those with acne. Tea tree oil is thought to be approximately as effective as benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid, but has been associated with allergic contact dermatitis. Proposed mechanisms for tea tree oil's anti-acne effects include antibacterial action against P. acnes, and anti-inflammatory properties. Numerous other plant-derived therapies have been observed to have positive effects against acne (e.g., basil oil and oligosaccharides from seaweed); however, few studies have been performed, and most have been of lower methodological quality. There is a lack of high-quality evidence for the use of acupuncture, herbal medicine, or cupping <b>therapy</b> <b>for</b> acne.|$|E

The goal of induction therapy is to achieve a complete remission by reducing the number of leukemic cells to an undetectable level; the goal of consolidation therapy is to eliminate any residual undetectable disease and achieve a cure. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is usually considered if induction chemotherapy fails or after a person relapses, although transplantation is also sometimes used as front-line <b>therapy</b> <b>for</b> people with high-risk disease.
