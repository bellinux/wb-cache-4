50|$|After the {{collapse}} of his marriage, Cohl moved to London <b>to</b> work for <b>Pick</b> <b>Me</b> <b>Up,</b> a humor magazine that specialized in French artists (he left his long-standing second job as a philatelist at this time). He returned to Paris in June 1896 and married Suzanne Delpy, the daughter of one of André Gill's followers. Their son André Jean was born on November 8, 1899. By this time, Cohl had moved away from caricature, sending humorous drawings to bicycle magazines, family magazines, and children's magazines. He also wrote articles on French history, stamps, and fishing. In July 1898 he started contributing to L'Illustré National. This would be the origin of Cohl's comic strips. At the same time, Cohl's art moved from scene-setting to story-telling, and from the Gill fantoche style to Impressionism. Other interests during this period included puzzles, toys (he invented a few new ones), and drawings of figures made from wax matches. In the political arena, he submitted anti-Dreyfus illustrations to La Libre Parole Illustrée.|$|R

30|$|In early January 1978, I {{landed on}} the Urbana–Champaign {{airfield}} as the first snowflakes {{of one of the}} coldest ever winters of the US Midwest just began to stick to the ground. Prof. F.J. Stevenson was there <b>to</b> kindly <b>pick</b> <b>me</b> <b>up</b> and <b>to</b> begin for me the precious chaperon role that he played during my year-long Fulbright-Hays-sponsored scientific association with the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign. Now that Frank Stevenson passed away on May 29 th, 2015 at the age of 93, I feel that I should pay a public tribute to the scientist and to the man. When I began to work in his laboratory as a young physical organic chemist from the University of Rome, Italy, Frank Stevenson had already been a Full Professor of Soil Chemistry for more than 15  years, and he was an established legend in the field of the organic chemistry of soil. He had already published his highly quoted Science paper on environmental nitrogen as well as several innovative and fundamental articles and book chapters on humus chemistry and organic geochemistry, including those on ammonium, amino acids, amino sugars, and metals in soil. My scientific acquaintance with him kindled my interest in the organic chemistry of soil and his competence, experience and serious scientific approach introduced me to the practical chemical techniques for use in investigations of the “mysterious” humic substances. He offered various research topics and I chose to work on the evaluation by infrared spectrometry of the type of bonds formed between metals and chelating humic functional groups. This decision was of mutual interest, since I could exploit my physical organic-chemical background and use the brand new infrared spectrometer that Frank Stevenson had just bought for his laboratory. The application of this technique to humus chemistry was then relatively new, and the complexity of humic matter and the overlapping of infrared bands conspired against the chance to obtain meaningful results. I was frustrated at having to work with such complex, unidentified chemical material that was so very different from the pure and structurally known metal–organic molecules that I had previously been accustomed to. Frank was calm and encouraging in supporting my efforts. Finally, I was drawn out of the impasse by adopting a stepwise approach for the progressive metal complexation in terms of the percent of humic acidic functional groups. This led to a successful joint publication in Geoderma.|$|R

60|$|About 2 A.M. Pettigrew said {{something}} about going to bed; and I rose and put down my pipe. We stood looking at the fireplace for a time, and he expressed regret that I had to leave {{so early in the}} morning. Then he put out two of the lights, and after that we both looked at the garden tobacco. He seemed to have a sudden idea; for rather briskly he tied the tobacco up into a neat paper parcel and handed it to me, saying that I would perhaps give it a trial at the inn. I took it without a word, but opening my hand suddenly I let it fall. My first impulse was <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> it up; but then it struck me that Pettigrew had not noticed what had happened, and that, were he <b>to</b> see <b>me</b> <b>pick</b> it <b>up,</b> he might think that I had not taken sufficient care of it. So I let it lie, and, bidding him good-night, went off to bed. I was {{at the foot of the}} stair when I thought that, after all, I should like the tobacco, so I returned. I could not see the package anywhere, but something was fizzing up the chimney, and Pettigrew had the tongs in his hand. He muttered something about his wife taking up wrong notions. Next morning that lady was very satirical about our having smoked the whole two ounces.|$|R

Despite a surprisingly poor initial performance, Gansler allowed Pope to attend a second camp. Earnie Stewart's fear of flying was referenced in his introduction by teammate Claudio Reyna and Stewart's own address, in which he stated, [...] I’d like to thank Dutch coach Rinus Michels. I was going to the airport and my fear of flying was terrible, so my wife dropped me off for a flight to California. I said to myself, ‘This is it, I’m quitting, I’m never going to play for the U.S. soccer team ever again.’ I told my wife <b>to</b> come <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>me</b> because I’m hanging it up. All of a sudden, I saw Rinus Michels -- and I {{never got a chance to}} tell him — he was there. At that moment, I thought, ‘If such an important person is going to step on this plane, what can happen to me?’ I step on, I called my wife again and told her : ‘Forget what I said.’ I am so very glad I decided to do that because it's been a fantastic ride. Earnie Stewart Stewart continued by referencing his departure from D.C. United on somewhat rocky terms and later his continued commitment to the U.S. National Team, despite spending most of his life in the Netherlands.|$|R
