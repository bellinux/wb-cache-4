Unlike trapezoidal ditches, two-stage ditches have a vegetated bench {{that acts as a}} floodplain, which helps to prevent erosion and to increase the processing of nutrients to improve water quality. Converting a <b>trapezoidal</b> <b>ditch</b> to a two-stage ditch is expensive, due to the large volumes of soil that need to be excavated. Since ditch geometries vary significantly and surveying each potential site by hand would be time consuming and expensive, a tool based upon online Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data would be useful to estimate the volume. The excavation volume for two ditches was calculated using two methods: the LiDAR digital elevation model, gridded to 3 m resolution, and a ground survey using an RTK GPS unit. ArcGIS was used to create profiles of the trapezoidal streams. Hypothetical two-stage cross-sections were created by calculating the bankfull depth, based on the drainage area, and the width, using a three to one bench slope. OriginPro was used to find the difference between the area under the two-stage cross-section and the original trapezoidal cross-section. The estimated volume differed between the two methods. While the LiDAR based volume of one ditch was within 16. 9 % of the RTK GPS based volume, the other ditch’s volumes varied by 22. 5 %. This suggests that using the LiDAR DEM may not provide sufficient accuracy for this estimate, although it could provide a rough cost estimate without time-consuming surveys...|$|E
40|$|Headwater {{streams in}} areas of {{intensive}} agriculture are frequently modified through surface and subsurface drainage to increase the transport of water to downstream water bodies and improve cropland in poorly drained areas. Stream modification and subsequent maintenance practices are beneficial to farmers but likely impair stream ecosystem function. Fluvial processes in these overly-widened headwater streams naturally form sediment benches that are stabilized through the establishment of grasses. Because these grassed benches {{have the potential to}} take up nutrients and decrease sediment export, they may improve the ecological functioning of modified headwater streams. To evaluate this, I determined whole stream metabolism for three types of headwater streams; reference streams, traditional trapezoidal-shaped drainage ditches, and drainage ditches that had developed grassed benches. I tested whether trapezoidal-shaped drainage ditches and benched drainage ditches functioned similarly to natural (reference) headwater streams in terms of net daily metabolism (oxygen production and consumption), and examined environmental and water quality variables that could influence the rates of net daily metabolism in each type of headwater stream. I found that rates of net daily metabolism were most similar in <b>trapezoidal</b> <b>ditches</b> and reference streams, but that <b>trapezoidal</b> <b>ditches</b> and benched ditches were more directly comparable in terms of overall ecosystem function due to the impacts of agricultural activities on these two systems. My study suggests that the benched system had a greater capacity for nutrient uptake and suspended sediment reduction and therefore provided more opportunities for improved water quality and ecological functioning in agricultural drainage ditches...|$|R
50|$|Tumulus graves contain {{earth and}} stone cist graves as primary burials. In the gravemound at Latdorf in Bernburg, a narrow stone cist was found which was {{surrounded}} by a 25 metre long trapezoidal barrow. The earthern graves of the Baalberge culture usually contain inhumations, with the bodies nearly always laid out on a west-east orientation flexed on their right side. Some inhumations were enclosed in square or <b>trapezoidal</b> <b>ditches.</b> In 1966, J. Preuß recorded 116 grave-complexes in the central German habitation area. The grave-complex at Stemmem excavated by W. Matthias in 1952 is 16.4 m long and squared at both ends and was the first enclosure grave recognised as a Baalberge burial.|$|R
