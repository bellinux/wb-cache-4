In the 2014–15 NBA.com Rookie Survey at the annual Rookie Photo Shoot on August 6, Parker was named by his peers as both {{the most likely to}} be Rookie of the Year and the most likely <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> NBA career.|$|E
5|$|A {{mathematical}} look at {{the voting}} numbers reveals that Bush {{would have had to}} win 12.55% of Perot's 18.91% of the vote, 66.36% of Perot's support base, to earn a majority of the vote, and would have needed to win nearly every state Clinton won by less than five percentage points. Furthermore, Perot was most popular in states that strongly favored either Clinton or Bush, limiting his real electoral impact for either candidate. He gained relatively little support in the Southern states and happened <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> showing in states with few electoral votes. Perot appealed to disaffected voters all across the political spectrum who had grown weary of the two-party system. Perot's anti-NAFTA stance played a role in his support, and Perot voters were relatively moderate on hot button social issues such as abortion and gay rights.|$|E
5|$|The {{producers}} found Crispin Bonham-Carter <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> physical {{contrast to}} Firth's Darcy {{and gave him}} his first major television role as the good-natured and wealthy Mr Charles Bingley. Bonham-Carter had originally auditioned for the part of Mr George Wickham, a handsome militia lieutenant whose charm conceals his licentiousness and greed, but Adrian Lukis was cast instead. Anna Chancellor, of Four Weddings and a Funeral fame, played Mr Bingley's sister Caroline Bingley. (Chancellor is also Jane Austen's six-times-great-niece) Mr Bingley's other sister and his brother-in-law were played by Lucy Robinson (Louisa Hurst) and Rupert Vansittart (Mr Hurst). Casting the role of Darcy's young sister, Georgiana, proved hard as the producers {{were looking for a}} young actress who appeared innocent, proud and yet shy, had class and could also play the piano. After auditioning over 70 actresses, Simon Langton suggested Emilia Fox, the real-life daughter of Joanna David (Mrs Gardiner), for the part. Barbara Leigh-Hunt was cast as Darcy's meddling aunt, Lady Catherine de Bourgh, without auditions or screen tests.|$|E

25|$|The Stanford Cardinal {{entered the}} tournament as the {{defending}} national champions. During the regular season, the Cardinal amassed a conference record of eight wins, one draw and one loss. The record {{was good enough}} <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> Pac-12 conference regular season season, which doubled as the Pac-12 championship. Stanford secured their fourth Pac-12 title, and their third-consecutive conference championship with a 30 away victory at Oregon State on October 27.|$|E

Even there however, there were deficits. Sweden's annual revenues only amounted to 12 million rix dollars per year. This situation was ameliorated as the king's reign went on by increasing imposts, and the reversion of lucrative fiefdoms back to the crown on the passage of its holder.|$|R

25|$|Following initial {{studies and}} wind-tunnel testing at the Air Proving Ground Center and Arnold Engineering Development Center, a radically {{unconventional}} design emerged that featured a lenticular, wedge-shaped airframe. The lenticular design was considered <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> handling characteristics at extremely high angles of attack, and would theoretically possess ideal mass distribution, giving the missile outstanding terminal agility. In addition, the lenticular design allowed for omnidirectional launching from the carrying aircraft.|$|E

Cormorants have a greater range of visual accommodation, at 50 dioptres, than any other bird, but the kingfishers are considered <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> all-round (air and water) vision.|$|E
25|$|In the boardroom, Ben {{tried to}} use his {{previous}} victory as a defence, but Sir Alan rebutted it, as despite getting the huge number of tickets for a good price, it wasn't {{a major role in}} the victory. While Ben was ultimately fired, Sir Alan warned Miriam about her attempts to scapegoat Paul rather than take responsibility for the overspending, but survived due <b>to</b> <b>having</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> sale figures behind Paul and Sir Alan believing Ben was more at fault for the loss.|$|R

25|$|Allen Stanford {{proposed}} emphasizing Twenty20 cricket {{as a way}} {{to promote}} cricket in the West Indies. He created the Stanford 20/20, a yearly tournament featuring teams from the island nations that made up the West Indies. From the first edition of his tournament in 2006 he aimed <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> players from his tournament play as a team against an international team. Initially South Africa had been planned to play against the Stanford team for a prize of US$5 million, but that effort fell through after scheduling conflicts with the WICB.|$|E
25|$|At 20:30 the Palmes {{left their}} apartment, unescorted, {{heading for the}} Gamla stan metro station. Several people {{witnessed}} their short walk to the station and, according to the later police investigation, commented {{on the lack of}} bodyguards. The couple took the subway train to the Rådmansgatan station, from where they walked to the Grand Cinema. They met their son and his girlfriend just outside the cinema around 21:00. Olof Palme had not yet purchased tickets which were by then almost sold out. Recognizing the prime minister, the ticket clerk wanted him <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> seats, and therefore sold Palme the theatre director's seats.|$|E
25|$|In Locabail, Mrs. Emmanuel and {{her lawyers}} did nothing after the judge's {{disclosure}} {{of a conflict}} of interest and only sprung into action to complain about bias after learning she had failed in her claims. It was held that the law did not allow Mrs. Emmanuel <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> of both worlds by waiting to see how her claims in litigation turned out before pursuing her complaint of bias. Similarly, in Pillai, although the applicant had knowledge of all matters grounding his complaint of bias before judgment was delivered, he only decided to complain after he had lost the appeal. The court found that if he had not lost, it was quite certain that he would not have filed the motion. The doctrine of waiver therefore militated firmly against him.|$|E

25|$|Baltimore's {{quest for}} a {{championship}} seemed doomed from the start when long-time starting quarterback Johnny Unitas suffered a pre-season injury to his throwing arm {{and was replaced by}} Earl Morrall, a veteran who had started inconsistently {{over the course of his}} 12 seasons with four different teams. But Morrall would go on <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> year of his career, leading the league in passer rating (93.2) during the regular season. His performance was so impressive that Colts coach Don Shula decided to keep Morrall in the starting lineup after Unitas was healthy enough to play. The Colts had won ten games in a row, including four shutouts, and finished the season with an NFL-best 13–1 record. In those ten games, they had allowed only seven touchdowns. Then, the Colts avenged their sole regular-season loss against the Cleveland Browns by crushing them, 34–0, in the NFL Championship Game.|$|E
25|$|The Winter Line {{proved a}} major {{obstacle}} to the Allies {{at the end of}} 1943, halting the Fifth Army's advance on the western side of Italy. Although the Gustav Line was penetrated on the Eighth Army's Adriatic front, and Ortona captured, blizzards, drifting snow and zero visibility at the end of December caused the advance to grind to a halt. The Allies' focus then turned to the western front, where an attack through the Liri valley was considered <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> chance of a breakthrough towards the Italian capital. Landings at Anzio during Operation Shingle, advocated by the British Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, behind the line were intended to destabilise the German Gustav line defences, but the early thrust inland to cut off the German defences did not occur, thanks to the indecisiveness of the American commander (Major General John P. Lucas), and the Anzio forces became bottled up in their beachhead. Lucas was replaced by Major General Lucian Truscott.|$|E

An independent report conducted by Swedish investment firm, Skandia found that St Andrews is, despite its small undergraduate body, the joint-5th best university in the UK for producing millionaires. A study by High Fliers confirmed this by reporting that the university also features in the top 5 of UK universities for producing self-made millionaires. According to a study by the Institute of Employment Research, St Andrews has produced more directors of FTSE 100 companies in proportion to its size than any other educational institution in Britain.|$|E
