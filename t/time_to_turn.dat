25|$|In response, AET {{once again}} criticsed OFSTED, {{saying that the}} Ofsted judgements were unfairly {{negative}} and that many of its schools {{had a history of}} poor performance and would require <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> round. Ian Comfort the CEO also directly queried the professionalism of OFSTED by claiming that OFSTED had unfairly turned the 'generally positive oral feedback' given at the time of inspections, into 'far more negative statements' in the final OFSTED letter which criticised standards at AET. In comments to the Parliamentary Select Committee Ian Comfort also queried the appropriateness of having both OFSTED and the DfE involved in inspecting school standards as it put 'unnecessary pressure' on AET schools. In contrast to Ian Comfort other CEO's of Multi Academy Trusts, such as Dame Rachel de Souza have publicly stated that they are very happy with how the DfE and OFSTED work together to hold schools accountable.|$|E

She {{also seems to be}} traumatized from the death of Scott and began to actually believe her own lie that Black Bolt was the one who actually killed him. Emma wasted no time and began to prepare for a war with the Inhumans by making alliances with various teams of X-Men, with the last being Storm's X-Haven. She declares war on the Inhumans when Beast reports that the Terrigen cloud will soon saturate and render earth as completely uninhabitable for mutants, believing that they have no time to attempt negotiation. When Medusa learns the truth about why the X-Men went to war against the Inhumans, she willingly destroys the cloud and ends the possibility of future Inhuman manifestations so that the mutants can survive.|$|E

Minas Tirith is besieged. Denethor is deceived by Sauron and falls into despair. He burns himself alive on a pyre, nearly taking his son Faramir with him. Aragorn, {{accompanied}} by Legolas, Gimli and the Rangers of the North, takes the Paths of the Dead to recruit the Dead Men of Dunharrow, who {{are bound by}} a curse which denies them rest until they fulfil their long-ago forsworn oath {{to fight for the}} King of Gondor. Following Aragorn, the Army of the Dead strikes terror into the Corsairs of Umbar invading southern Gondor. Aragorn defeats the Corsairs and uses their ships to transport the men of southern Gondor up the Anduin, reaching Minas Tirith just in <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> the tide of battle. Éowyn, Théoden's niece, slays the Lord of the Nazgûl with help from Merry. Together, Gondor and Rohan defeat Sauron's army in the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, though at great cost. Théoden is slain, and Éowyn and Merry are injured.|$|E

[...] Many of his men were jubilant, having overrun the Union camps and taken thousands of prisoners and tons of supplies. Grant still had reason to be optimistic: Lew Wallace's 5,800 men (minus the two regiments guarding the supplies at Crump's Landing) and 15,000 of Don Carlos Buell's army began to arrive that evening.

[...] Searching for the kits, Firepaw and Greypaw lead Ravenpaw to a barn where he can be safe and have company, living with a loner named Barley.

500|$|Although {{he praised}} the [...] "beautifully choreographed and shot" [...] action sequences, Murray criticized Flame & Citron for [...] "lean toward the {{handsome}} and thoughtful {{when it could}} stand {{to be a lot}} dirtier and more visceral", citing Black Book as a [...] "superb counter-example". Stempel declared that it [...] "is not as exciting as" [...] Black Book, [...] "but Verhoeven was dealing with people having to make complex moral decisions instantaneously. Flame & Citron takes its <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> the screws on its characters, and us." [...] Ella Taylor argued in favor of Flame & Citron, saying it [...] "is the film that the horribly overrated Black Book could have been, had Paul Verhoeven not indulged in the puerile reversals of sensitive Nazis and treacherous partisans." [...] Fuchs also compared the moral dilemmas the characters have to deal with to Black Book and Steven Spielberg's Munich but said Flame & Citron does not have [...] "the splendid surrealish excess" [...] and [...] "the weird conflation of maternal bodies and motherlands" [...] of the two films, respectively. Gleiberman could [...] "feel the shadow of Steven Spielberg's Munich hovering over Flame & Citron".|$|E
500|$|Beginning with Caged Bird, Angelou {{used the}} same [...] "writing ritual" [...] for many years. She would get up at {{five in the morning}} and check into a hotel room, where the staff were {{instructed}} to remove any pictures from the walls. [...] She wrote on yellow legal pads while lying on the bed, with a bottle of sherry, a deck of cards to play solitaire, Roget's Thesaurus, and the Bible, and left by the early afternoon. [...] She averaged 10–12 pages of material a day, which she edited down to three or four pages in the evening. [...] Lupton stated that this ritual indicated [...] "a firmness of purpose and an inflexible use of time". Angelou went through this process to give herself <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> the events of her life into art, and to [...] "enchant" [...] herself; as she said in a 1989 interview with the British Broadcasting Corporation, to [...] "relive the agony, the anguish, the Sturm und Drang". [...] She placed herself back in the time she wrote about, even during traumatic experiences like her rape in Caged Bird, to [...] "tell the human truth" [...] about her life. Critic Opal Moore says about Caged Bird: [...] "...Though easily read, [...] is no 'easy read'". Angelou stated that she played cards to reach that place of enchantment, to access her memories more effectively. She has stated, [...] "It may take an hour to get into it, but once I'm in it—ha! It's so delicious!" [...] She did not find the process cathartic; rather, she found relief in [...] "telling the truth".|$|E

Barr has written: [...] "The hearing was a farce: a virtual lovefest, during which members of the Clinton Administration responded to softball questions from their colleagues in the House with superficial answers, and Republican queries were ignored or glossed over with disdain, if not outright contempt."
