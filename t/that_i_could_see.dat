500|$|THEM Anime Review's Carlos Ross said, [...] "The voice-acting is remarkable, the {{directing}} is solid, {{and music}} is quite competent. But the real kicker {{here is the}} animation quality, which actually equals (and sometimes exceeds) that of excellent television series like Vandread and Full Metal Panic...there is a remarkable amount of storyline; the plot is well-written and executed, and never {{gets a chance to}} be too drawn out. And Shinkai gives equal time to the slick action sequences and the well-handled, genuinely touching romance". IGN's [...] A.E. Sparrow said, [...] "While [...] was visually one of the best pieces of eye-candy I have seen in a year or so, it's ultimately a voice track over a sequence of pretty pictures. Don't get me wrong, it was absolutely beautiful, but it left me wanting more". Mania's Chris Beveridge commended ADV Films for obtaining [...] the original computer files that were used to create it. He said, [...] "the transfer here is simply gorgeous. Colors are amazingly lush and deep, saturated without bleeding. Cross coloration is non-existent and only a few very minor areas of aliasing occur. The only real 'flaw' <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> with this transfer is during some of the panning sequences up and down, there’s a slight stutter that’s simply inherent in the materials". DVDs Worth Watching's Johanna Draper Carlson said, [...] "the character designs are familiar and uninspired, and the cross-cutting choppy".|$|E
2500|$|In 2001, Neil Armstrong stated {{about the}} view from Apollo 11: [...] "I do not believe that, at least with my eyes, there would be any {{man-made}} object <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see.</b> I have not yet found somebody who has told me they've seen the Wall of China from Earth orbit.... I've asked various people, particularly Shuttle guys, that have been many orbits around China in the daytime, and the ones I've talked to didn't see it." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "There {{are stories}} that I quit Sabbat because {{the rest of}} the band didn't like my pagan lyrics. That's not true. All of us shared an {{interest}} in paganism. The paganism was never a problem; I was always left {{to get on with the}} lyrics the best way I saw fit. No, the truth was <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that the music was going to get even more complex. Andy was writing 11 minute musical epics and I couldn't even begin to see how I'd write lyrics for something like that. I wanted to bring in other musical styles, to bring in violins for instance. That would never have worked with Sabbat." ...|$|E

60|$|We {{were with}} our {{backs to the}} light, so <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> her face.|$|R
60|$|JAMES. He's an ugly customer. <b>That's</b> all <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see.</b> There was {{a little}} carpet bag in his hand.|$|R
2500|$|On 28 August 2008, Gazeta Yuga {{published}} a report about Zalim Gegraev, a wounded soldier from 1st {{company of the}} peacemaking battalion, who fought in South Ossetia. Gegraev's mother said that her son {{had told her that}} he was going to Tskhinvali before the war started. She also said that he had been to South Ossetia previously and when he was there, his phone did not work. Then Zalim spoke to journalist: [...] "We had been there to participate in military exercises for a month in those areas before this. They ended, however we were not withdrawn. Then the order came to move to Tskhinvali. On 8 August we were near the town and waited for further instructions. I didn't even think <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> such thing..." ...|$|E
2500|$|Dana White said in 2008; [...] "Ken Shamrock {{was in a}} {{beef with}} us over his contract. We thought he retired, he was {{claiming}} he didn't and still had one fight. And my attitude was, I'd rather pay Ken Shamrock to not fight. I'd rather pay him to not fight and just say, [...] "stay home, Ken". Ken is way past his prime, {{it gets to the}} point where it's dangerous for that guy to still be fighting." [...] WWE announcer Jim Ross said before Shamrock's scheduled fight with Bobby Lashley in early 2009; [...] "There was a time <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> the veteran, 45-year-old Shamrock, a former WWE superstar, schooling the MMA rookie Lashley but that ship has long since sailed. I have great respect for Ken but he's outstayed his welcome in the octagon, cage, whatever and needs to teach and coach and stop fighting...Kenny is fighting for one more pay day while Lashley is fighting to help establish what he hopes will be a long term, lucrative, MMA career." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{wished that}} his face were visible so <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> {{if he still}} smiled when he uttered those words.|$|E
60|$|My {{neck was}} so twisted <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> {{any of these}} people who were {{discussing}} my fate. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> only lie and listen.|$|R
6000|$|... "And it was {{you that}} {{followed}} me so often among the trees, calling to me, yet always hiding so <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> never <b>see</b> you?" ...|$|R
60|$|I said, without {{intent to}} hurt, but with heedless choice of words, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> <b>that</b> {{we had been}} living such an {{abandoned}} life.|$|R
60|$|Sure enough, on {{the rise}} of a curve upon our right the four-in-hand had appeared, the horses {{stretched}} to the utmost. Our mares laid themselves out gallantly, and the distance between us began slowly to decrease. I found <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> the black band upon Sir John's white hat, then that I could count the folds of his cape; finally, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> the pretty features of his wife as she looked back at us.|$|E
6000|$|... "For the present," [...] Dartrey admitted, [...] "Tallente {{is doing}} excellently. I wish, though, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> {{a little farther}} into the future." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I wish to Heaven <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> your face!" [...] Pelham exclaimed, [...] "I {{should know}} then {{whether you were}} telling me the truth." ...|$|E
60|$|Aunt Philippa {{looked so}} determinedly grim <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> almost <b>see</b> {{her with a}} spade in her hand. I laughed aloud at the picture summoned up.|$|R
6000|$|Oh, <b>that</b> manner, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> in my visitor's face, and not {{a little}} else besides! [...] "She asks me every three minutes if I think you're coming in." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I know that," [...] said Tedham. [...] "That is {{the reason}} why I should like to see Mrs. March. <b>I</b> believe <b>that</b> if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> her, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{convince}} her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{has been}} said some time ago, and much better {{than you can say}} it," [...] said the Professor, apropos of nothing <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Not the {{slightest}} curiosity <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see.</b> It {{is enough for}} her that you are to be cured. The rest she leaves to the doctor." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{must be a}} {{beginning}} to all things, Mr. Van Tassel," [...] I replied, with a calmness <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> the old usurer did not like.|$|E
6000|$|... "Heigho!" [...] said Simon. [...] "I {{wonder whether}} {{this be a}} reality or a dream.--I am sober, I know; for who will give me credit for the means to be drunk? and as for sleeping, I'm too hungry for <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> wish <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> a capon {{and a bottle of}} white wine." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I won't die cheerfully!" [...] {{protested the}} kitten. [...] "There's nothing cheerful about dying <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> ever <b>see,</b> {{although}} {{they say a}} cat has nine lives, and so must die nine times." ...|$|R
60|$|The ground rose {{a little}} to a furze-crowned ridge in the centre so <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> {{the full length of}} it, but I heard a faint bubble of blank in the distance.|$|R
60|$|Harût {{followed}} her words {{with an interest}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> was intense, although he attempted to hide it. Then {{he asked me to}} translate them, which I did.|$|E
6000|$|We stood {{so close}} {{to each other in the}} dark {{anteroom}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> her biting her lower lip to suppress a dry sob. After a short pause she said-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, sir," [...] said I, [...] "I did not; {{the boat}} was very full, and the air so thick with {{gunpowder}} smoke <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> little or nothing at any distance." ...|$|E
60|$|He dipped a cup, as he spoke, {{and drank}} it. So did his comrades, with evident satisfaction, though the liquid was so opaque <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> {{the bottom of}} a tea-cup when it was full.|$|R
60|$|The girl's eyes blazed. Even in <b>that</b> {{dim light}} <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> the dark blue fire in them.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, it is you, Bathurst!" [...] {{he heard}} Wilson's voice exclaim. [...] "I {{thought it was}} you, {{but it is so}} dark now we are off that white sand <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see.</b> Where are you hit?" ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{pointed to}} the peak, saying, [...] "I was lying on my back by the tarn, when my lady eagle came sailing overhead, so low <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> this poor little thing, and hear it bleat." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You build a {{wall around}} your life," [...] she said, [...] "like the wall which encircles your mystery house. Last night I thought <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> {{a little way}} over the top. To-night you are different." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not by a whole mile! It was dark, {{but not so}} dark but <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> {{who they}} were. They were in a top buggy, drivin' that slick nag the old man is so choice about." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If it weren't for Laura," [...] she said, [...] "you'd find {{it pretty}} hard to keep me away. <b>I</b> think <b>that</b> if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> the {{handcuffs}} put on that man, {{it would be the}} happiest moment of my life." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{told her}} at first <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> her, and begged {{her not to}} speak to me about it. I tried to make her {{understand}} that she should go to some one else. But it was of no use." ...|$|R
60|$|The captain {{looked at}} them undecisively. I stood behind in the shade, so <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not be <b>seen.</b>|$|R
