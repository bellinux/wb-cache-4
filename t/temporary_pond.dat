40|$|In Europe, <b>temporary</b> <b>ponds</b> are a {{naturally}} common and widespread habitat occurring, often in abundance, in all biogeographical regions from the boreal snow-melt pools of northern Scandinavia to the seasonally inundated coastal dune pools of southern Spain. Ecological studies in Europe and elsewhere also emphasise that <b>temporary</b> <b>ponds</b> are a biologically important habitat type, renowned both for their specialised assemblages and the considerable numbers of rare and endemic species they support. They are, however, a habitat currently under considerable threat. Most <b>temporary</b> <b>ponds</b> are inherently shallow {{and the majority}} are destroyed even by limited soil drainage for agriculture or urban development. The paper gives an overview of definitions of <b>temporary</b> <b>ponds</b> and examines their formation and abundance.

40|$|The {{importance}} of ponds for biodiversity in Britain {{has been demonstrated}} {{by a number of}} studies. However, most of the research and interest has been directed at permanent waterbodies, and <b>temporary</b> <b>ponds</b> have been largely neglected. In this article the author present some preliminary findings from a project which aims to fill some of the many gaps in our knowledge of <b>temporary</b> <b>ponds</b> in Britain. The project, which runs for three years until the end of 2001, aims specifically to investigate the ecology of <b>temporary</b> <b>ponds</b> in England and Wales by describing (i) their wetland plant and macroinvertebrate communities, (ii) their physico-chemical characteristics, and (iii) their value as a biodiversity resource. The article focuses on the assessment of <b>temporary</b> <b>ponds</b> as a biodiversity resource and briefly considers aspects of species richness, rarity and distinctiveness. Where possible, <b>temporary</b> <b>ponds</b> are compared with other waterbody types, mainly permanent ponds from the National Pond Survey (NPS), to give the results a broader context...|$|R

50|$|A {{sediment}} basin is a <b>temporary</b> <b>pond</b> {{built on}} a construction site to capture eroded or disturbed soil that is washed off during rain storms, and protect the water quality of a nearby stream, river, lake, or bay. The sediment-laden soil settles in the pond before the runoff is discharged. Sediment basins are typically used on construction sites of 5 acre or more, where there is sufficient room. They are often {{used in conjunction with}} erosion controls and other sediment control practices. On smaller construction sites, where a basin is not practical, sediment traps may be used.|$|E
5000|$|Other {{larger scale}} {{dredging}} operations {{take place on}} exposed river gravel bars at seasonal low water. These operations typically use a land based excavator to feed a gravel screening plant and sluice box floating in a <b>temporary</b> <b>pond.</b> The pond is excavated in the gravel bar and filled from the natural water table. [...] "Pay" [...] gravel is excavated from the front face of the pond and processed through the floating plant, with the gold trapped in the onboard sluice box and tailings stacked behind the plant, steadily filling {{in the back of}} the pond as the operation moves forward. This type of gold mining is characterized by its low cost, as each rock is moved only once. It also has low environmental impact, as no stripping of vegetation or overburden is necessary, and all process water is fully recycled. Such operations are typical on New Zealand's South Island and in the Klondike region of Canada.|$|E

40|$|Several insect species seem {{to persist}} {{not only in}} {{permanent}} but also in <b>temporary</b> <b>ponds</b> where they face particularly harsh conditions and frequent extinctions. Under such conditions, gene flow may prevent local adaptation to <b>temporary</b> <b>ponds</b> and may promote phenotypic plasticity, or maintain apparent population persistence. The few empirical studies on insects suggest the latter mechanism, but no studies so far quantified gene flow including both pond types. We investigated the effects of pond type and temporal variation on population genetic differentiation and gene flow in the damselfly Lestes viridis in northern Belgium. We report a survey of two allozyme loci (Gpi, Pgm) with polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in 14 populations from permanent and <b>temporary</b> <b>ponds,</b> and compared these results with similar data from the same permanent populations one year before. The data suggested that neither pond-drying regime, nor temporal variation have a substantial effect on population genetic structuring and did not provide evidence for stable population differentiation in L. viridis in northern Belgium. Gene flow estimates were high within permanent and <b>temporary</b> <b>ponds,</b> and between pond types. Our data are consistent with a source-sink metapopulation system where <b>temporary</b> <b>ponds</b> act as sinks in dry years, and are quickly recolonized after local population extinction. This may create a pattern of apparent population persistence of this species in permanent and <b>temporary</b> <b>ponds</b> without clear local adaptation. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Although {{there is}} a growing {{awareness}} of the value of temporary ponds in Europe, there is still remarkably little information available to help guide their conservation and management.

40|$|SUMMARY. In {{this study}} we present {{the start of the}} {{breeding}} season and the long term population fluctuations of amphibians in a permanent pond and a number of <b>temporary</b> <b>ponds</b> in a human modified landscape in the middle section of the Târnava Mare basin. The start of breeding was strongly influenced by temperature in spring. The populations of Hyla arborea and R. temporaria were in decline whereas Pelobates fuscus and Bufo bufo were stable during this time. Pelobates fuscus is represented by a small population and is probably maintained by immigration from other areas. Bufo bufo and P. fuscus use only the permanent pond for reproduction. More egg masses of R. temporaria were found in the <b>temporary</b> <b>ponds</b> than in the permanent pond. The reproductive success was yearly observed in the <b>temporary</b> <b>ponds</b> but not in the permanent pond. We assume that the permanent pond is a source habitat for B. bufo and represents sink for R. temporaria whereas the <b>temporary</b> <b>ponds</b> from the forest represent source habitats for the last species. This and the previous studies on this community suggest that in this landscape, both the permanent and <b>temporary</b> <b>ponds</b> and the landscape connectivity are crucial for the maintenance of rich amphibian communities...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{increased}} trophic complexity, through {{the addition of}} predatory notonectids (Anisops deanei), on <b>temporary</b> <b>pond</b> microcosms used for aquatic toxicity testing were studied. Replicate microcosms were established using sediment from a dried <b>temporary</b> <b>pond,</b> and treated with one of four concentrations of the organochlorine pesticide endosulfan (0, 1, 10 or 50 μg/L), in {{the presence or absence}} of six A. deanei. The tanks were sampled regularly for nine weeks following the addition of the predators and the entire contents of each tank counted after 12 weeks. Analysis using non-metric multidimensional scaling (MDS) and non-parametric MANOVA showed that both Anisops and endosulfan at concentrations > 10 μg/L significantly altered community structure. However, an interaction between the effects of Anisops and the effects of endosulfan was not detected. The addition of Anisops did not increase the variability of response and thus did not reduce the sensitivity of the test method. <br /...|$|E

40|$|Carbon dioxide efflux {{during the}} {{flooding}} phase of <b>temporary</b> <b>ponds</b> Small water bodies, such as <b>temporary</b> <b>ponds,</b> {{have a high}} carbon processing potential. Nevertheless, despite the global occurrence of these systems, the carbon effluxes from such water bodies have been largely overlooked. In this study, we examined the intra- and intersystem variability of carbon dioxide (CO 2) effluxes from a set of Mediterranean <b>temporary</b> <b>ponds</b> during the flooding phase, a hot-spot for biogeochemical cycling in temporary systems. The CO 2 effluxes showed higher variability among the various sections of each pond (i. e., inundated, emerged-unvegetated and emerged-vegetated) than among the ponds. The emerged-vegetated sections showed the highest CO 2 effluxes per unit area and tended to drive the total effluxes at the whole-ecosystem scale. The mean CO 2 efflux (121. 3 ± 138. 1 mmol m– 2 d– 1) was in the upper range for freshwater ecosystems. The CO 2 effluxes were not related to catchment properties but rather to the organic content of the sediments, especially in the emerged sections of the ponds. Our results indicate that <b>temporary</b> <b>ponds,</b> especially their emerged sections, are important sources of CO 2 to the atmosphere, highlighting the need to include the dry phases {{of these and other}} temporary aquatic systems in regional carbon budgets.

40|$|Abstract: Based {{on field}} data {{simultaneous}} with Landsat overpasses from six different dates, {{we developed a}} robust linear model to predict subpixel fractions of water cover. The model was applied to a time series of 174 Landsat TM and ETM+ images to reconstruct the flooding regime {{of a system of}} small <b>temporary</b> <b>ponds</b> and to study their spatio-temporal changes in a 23 -year period. We tried to differentiate natural fluctuations from trends in hydrologic variables (i. e., hydroperiod shortening) that may threaten the preservation of the system. Although medium-resolution remote sensing data have rarely been applied to the monitoring of small-sized wetlands, this study evidences its utility to understand the hydrology of <b>temporary</b> <b>ponds</b> at a local scale. We show that the <b>temporary</b> <b>ponds</b> in Doñana National Park constitute a large and heterogeneous system with high intra and inter-annual variability. We also evidence that the conservation value of this ecosystem is threatened by the observed tendency to shorter annual hydroperiods in recent years, probably due to aquifer exploitation. This system of <b>temporary</b> <b>ponds</b> deserves special attention for the high density and heterogeneity of natural ponds, not common in Europe.

40|$|Abstract. 1. Macroinvertebrate assemblages of <b>temporary</b> <b>ponds</b> {{are ideal}} model systems to explore {{biodiversity}} patterns and metacommunity ecology. In addition, {{the study of}} the environmental variables driving such biodiversity patterns is essential in establishing proper guidelines for the conservation of the singular fauna of <b>temporary</b> <b>ponds,</b> especially since such ponds are vulnerable systems. 2. We analysed the macroinvertebrate assemblages and environmental characteristics of 80 ponds spread across the Do~nana National Park, SW Spain to (i) analyse macroinvertebrate b-diversity and metacommunity structure; and (ii) discern the main environmental and spatial drivers of these patterns. 3. The pond network was highly heterogeneous as <b>temporary</b> <b>ponds</b> were highly variable. Macroinvertebrate b-diversity partitioning showed that species replacement made the greatest contribution to total b-diversity while the contri-bution of nestedness was small. The macroinvertebrate community structure and b-diversity were similarly driven by: electrical conductivity (and co-variables alkalinity, pH, and ion concentrations), plant richness (and the co-variabl...|$|R
