5|$|In {{the middle}} {{statement}} of the principal theme (between the C minor and A-flat major sections) there is a notational error which, in a literal performance of the score, causes a harmonic clash between <b>the</b> <b>piano</b> <b>and</b> the winds. Mozart probably wrote <b>the</b> <b>piano</b> <b>and</b> wind parts at different times, resulting in an oversight by the composer. Alfred Brendel, who has recorded the concerto on multiple occasions, argues that performers should not follow the score literally but correct Mozart's error. Brendel further argues that the time signature for the whole movement is another notational error: played in cut common time, which calls for two beats per bar rather than four, the movement is, in his view, too fast.|$|E

5|$|Alkan's {{attachment}} to his Jewish origins is displayed both {{in his life}} and his work. He was the first composer to incorporate Jewish melodies in art music. Fluent in Hebrew and Greek, he devoted much time to a complete new translation of the Bible into French. This work, like many of his musical compositions, is now lost. Alkan never married, but his presumed son Élie-Miriam Delaborde was, like Alkan, a virtuoso performer on both <b>the</b> <b>piano</b> <b>and</b> the pedal piano, and edited a number of the elder composer's works.|$|E

5|$|Corea was {{influenced}} in particular by {{a scene from}} Hubbard's work {{where one of the}} main characters plays <b>the</b> <b>piano,</b> <b>and</b> he created the album as a tone poem piece.

5|$|The episode {{marked the}} first time {{composer}} Michael Giacchino worked with assistant Chad Seiter on a Fringe episode. Seiter would continue to score the rest of the season's first half.

50|$|Much {{effort has}} gone into {{creating}} an instrument that sounds like <b>the</b> <b>piano</b> but lacks its size <b>and</b> weight. <b>The</b> electric <b>piano</b> <b>and</b> electronic <b>piano</b> were early efforts that, while useful instruments in their own right, did not convincingly reproduce the timbre of <b>the</b> <b>piano.</b> Electric <b>and</b> electronic organs were developed during the same period. More recent electronic keyboard designs strive to emulate the sound of specific make <b>and</b> model <b>pianos</b> using digital samples and computer models.|$|R
