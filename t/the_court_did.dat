5|$|Because its {{aforementioned}} holdings required affirmance, <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> <b>did</b> {{not reach}} the alternate ground for decision of the trial court that the appraisal and the payments were conditions precedent.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{adopting}} a broad principle, <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> <b>did</b> not list any specific rules for how trial judges were to balance evidentiary {{standards and the}} right of the defendant to secure witnesses in his or her favor.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Court</b> <b>did</b> {{not hear}} the {{question}} that had decided the district court opinion, namely that Hamdan was entitled to a GCIII Art. 5 hearing instead of a Combatant Status Review Tribunal.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Court</b> <b>does</b> {{not need}} to approve a reaffirmation {{agreement}} which applies to consumer debt secured by real estate. This applies to any mortgages on your home or other debts secured by your home. In addition, <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> <b>does</b> not approve any reaffirmation agreements between debtors and credit unions. They are filed and {{become part of the}} record without a hearing.|$|R
50|$|Applying this {{analysis}} {{to the facts}} at hand, Marshall found that <b>the</b> <b>courts</b> <b>did</b> not have jurisdiction over the case.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>court</b> <b>does</b> {{not have}} its own {{judicial}} officers. Instead, stipendiary magistrates constitute <b>the</b> <b>court.</b> In certain circumstances, the judicial registrar or a registrar may constitute <b>the</b> <b>court</b> as well.|$|R
5|$|Because Justice Anthony Kennedy did {{not join}} Stevens' opinion as to several parts, largely {{on the grounds of}} {{judicial}} parsimony (that is, having decided that the military commissions had no foundation, the core question of the case was decided and <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> <b>did</b> not need to go further), those sections were without a majority in support.|$|E
5|$|In 1982, the ACLU became {{involved}} in a case involving the distribution of child pornography (New York v. Ferber). In an amicus brief, the ACLU argued that child pornography that violates the three prong obscenity test should be outlawed, but that the law in question was overly restrictive because it outlawed artistic displays and otherwise non-obscene material. <b>The</b> <b>court</b> <b>did</b> not adopt the ACLU's position.|$|E
5|$|The Marshall Court also issued {{important}} opinions regarding criminal procedure. Although <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> <b>did</b> {{not explicitly}} cite or quote constitutional provisions, its opinions remain influential {{in interpreting the}} Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment and venue provision of Article Three. The Court also laid down the common law rules of evidence in federal courts, including the hearsay exception for party admissions and the narrowing of the best evidence rule.|$|E
50|$|If <b>the</b> <b>court</b> is {{satisfied}} with the plea, then the matter proceeds to the fourth stage listed above. <b>The</b> <b>court</b> <b>does</b> not at this stage enter a conviction.|$|R

5|$|After decades, the Oneida became {{frustrated}} {{by the failure of}} the case to settle. Instead, they began to purchase land within the claim area in fee simple, asserting sovereignty over the re-acquired parcels and refusing to pay property tax. In City of Sherrill v. Oneida Indian Nation of New York (2005), the Supreme Court held that laches barred the re-assertion of sovereignty over ancestral land re-acquired in fee simple; <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> <b>did</b> not consider whether the original aboriginal title over the disputed parcels was validly extinguished, and thus did not disturb its holding in Oneida II.|$|E
5|$|As {{the three}} {{suspects}} {{had been killed}} while preparing an act of terrorism, the court rejected the families' claims for damages, {{as well as their}} claim for expenses incurred at the inquest. <b>The</b> <b>court</b> <b>did</b> order the British government to pay the applicants' costs incurred during the proceedings in Strasbourg. The government initially suggested it would not pay, and there was discussion in parliament of the UK withdrawing from the ECHR. It paid the costs on 24 December 1995, within days of the three-month deadline which had been set by the court.|$|E
5|$|At his trial, Bonnet downplayed his own {{authority}} over his pirate crew. He {{told the court}} that his crew engaged in piracy against his will, {{and said he had}} warned them that he would leave the crew unless they stopped robbing vessels. He further stated that he had been asleep during the capture of the sloop Francis. <b>The</b> <b>court</b> <b>did</b> not accept these protestations. Boatswain Ignatius Pell testified that Bonnet's quartermaster, Robert Tucker, had more power than Bonnet. A powerful quartermaster {{appears to have been a}} common feature of pirate crews in the early modern era.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> Circuit <b>Court</b> for <b>the</b> District of Kentucky {{held that}} <b>the</b> <b>courts</b> <b>did</b> not have {{jurisdiction}} {{in a case}} where the parties were both aliens. There was a writ of error to <b>the</b> Supreme <b>Court.</b>|$|R

5|$|Despite the {{rejection}} of Taylor's constitutional position, <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> <b>did</b> create the framework for a balancing test for lower courts to use in handling future discovery preclusion questions. A trial court must balance the defendant's interest in a robust defense with the (i) state's interest in 'efficient' justice, (ii) state's interest in excluding evidence lacking integrity, (iii) state's interest in a strong judicial authority with followed rules, and (iv) the prosecution interest in avoiding prejudice due to a defendant's discovery violation.|$|E
5|$|In Flint v. Stone Tracy Co., the U.S. Supreme Court {{ruled that}} the {{corporation}} tax act of 1909 did not violate the constitutional requirement that revenue measures originate in the U.S. House of Representatives. <b>The</b> <b>Court</b> <b>did</b> not rule that excise taxes consisted only of taxes on corporations and corporate privileges, {{to the exclusion of}} taxes on individuals (natural persons). The issue of the validity of an income tax imposed on individuals was neither presented to the Court nor decided by the Court.|$|E
5|$|In Tan Eng Hong v. Attorney-General (2011), the {{applicant}} sought a declaration that section 377A of the Penal Code was unconstitutional. The High Court stated {{that a person}} who is asserting an infringement of a constitutional liberty must establish that he or she has not merely a sufficient interest but a substantial interest in the matter, that is, he or she must be alleging a violation of a fundamental liberty. <b>The</b> <b>Court</b> <b>did</b> not discuss the issue of standing in the context of administrative law.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ma'am,' said Mr Boffin, 'the Court (if I am <b>the</b> <b>Court)</b> <b>does</b> object. <b>The</b> <b>Court</b> {{objects for}} two reasons.

5|$|In Thio Li-ann's view, {{it appears}} that the High Court allowed the matter to be decided {{according}} to the subjective discretion of the Minister. The only explanation given for deregistration was that the Jehovah's Witnesses' refusal to perform national service was contrary to the public interest. <b>The</b> <b>Court</b> <b>did</b> not require the executive to elaborate on exactly how a failure to perform national service would be contrary to public interest. It accepted the executive's discretion to derogate a fundamental right without a close scrutiny of the executive's rationale and explanations.|$|E
5|$|In contrast, in Fong Thin Choo, the High Court {{expressed}} {{the view that}} under regulation 12(6) of the Customs Regulations 1979, the fact that goods had not been exported from Singapore was a precedent fact to the customs officer's power to require {{the owner of the}} goods to pay customs duty. Therefore, the Court had to decide whether the customs officer's decision was justified by the evidence, and not merely whether there was some evidence on which he could reasonably have reached his decision. However, <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> <b>did</b> not pursue the point since the applicant had not argued the case on this basis.|$|E
5|$|In the 2016 Austrian presidential election, Freedom Party {{candidate}} Norbert Hofer won {{the first}} round of the election, receiving 35.1% of the vote, making that election the Freedom Party's best ever election result in its history. However, in the second round, Hofer was defeated by Alexander Van der Bellen, who received the support of 50.3% compared to Hofer's 49.7%. On July first the Constitutional Court of Austria voided the results of the second round due to mishandling of postal votes; although <b>the</b> <b>court</b> <b>did</b> not find evidence of deliberate manipulation. The re-vote took place on 4 December 2016 when Van der Bellen won by a significantly larger margin.|$|E

5|$|Judicial {{independence}} is essential.

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>court's</b> judges sit monthly in {{panels of}} three in Jackson, Knoxville and Nashville. <b>The</b> <b>court</b> may meet in other {{locations}} as necessary.

5|$|Initially, the Court of Chancery {{would not}} {{entertain}} {{a request to}} administer an estate {{as soon as a}} flaw in the will was discovered, rather leaving it to the ecclesiastical courts, but from 1588 onwards <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> <b>did</b> deal with such requests, in four situations: where it was alleged that there were insufficient assets; where it was appropriate to force a legatee to give a bond to creditors (which could not be done in the ecclesiastical courts); to secure femme covert assets from a husband; and where the deceased's debts had to be paid before the legacies were valid.|$|E
5|$|Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote a {{concurrence}} which {{stated that}} Congress {{was very careful}} to base the changes to the statute on inherent tribal powers and not on a delegation of authority. Kennedy states that {{is all that is}} needed to decide the case, but that the Court went further than was necessary when it decided that Congress had the power under the constitution to authorize tribes to prosecute non-member Indians. Finally, Kennedy was concerned that <b>the</b> <b>court</b> <b>did</b> not address the question of the Equal Protection Clause. He would have reversed the Eighth Circuit without going into the additional detail.|$|E
5|$|The court {{declared}} that Hill was not validly elected at the 1998 federal election. However, {{they did not}} declare the whole election invalid, acting on an earlier decision of the court, because although no effect could be given to voters' preferences for Hill, their other preferences were not invalid, and those {{could be used to}} determine who should be elected in Hill's stead. <b>The</b> <b>court</b> <b>did</b> not reach a definite decision about what action should be taken, remitting that question to a lower court. Eventually, Len Harris, the number two candidate on the One Nation ticket, was elected in Hill's stead, taking up his seat on 1 July 1999.|$|E
50|$|In an {{arbitration}} {{hearing before}} <b>the</b> Permanent <b>Court</b> of Arbitration in December 2000, the Hawaiian flag was raised {{at the same}} height at and alongside other countries.
