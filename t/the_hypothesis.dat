5|$|In 1992, the {{economist}} Harry Saunders dubbed <b>the</b> <b>hypothesis</b> that improvements in energy efficiency work to increase (rather than decrease) energy consumption the Khazzoom–Brookes postulate, {{and argued that}} <b>the</b> <b>hypothesis</b> is broadly supported by neoclassical growth theory (the mainstream economic theory of capital accumulation, technological progress and long-run economic growth). Saunders showed that the Khazzoom–Brookes postulate occurs in the neoclassical growth model under {{a wide range of}} assumptions.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> input <b>hypothesis,</b> {{also known}} as the monitor model, is a group of five {{hypotheses}} of second-language acquisition developed by the linguist Stephen Krashen in the 1970s and 1980s. Krashen originally formulated <b>the</b> input <b>hypothesis</b> as just one of <b>the</b> five <b>hypotheses,</b> but over time the term has come to refer to <b>the</b> five <b>hypotheses</b> as a group. <b>The</b> <b>hypotheses</b> are <b>the</b> input <b>hypothesis,</b> <b>the</b> acquisition-learning <b>hypothesis,</b> <b>the</b> monitor <b>hypothesis,</b> <b>the</b> natural order <b>hypothesis</b> and <b>the</b> affective filter <b>hypothesis.</b> <b>The</b> input <b>hypothesis</b> was first published in 1977.|$|R

5|$|The {{problem of}} {{induction}} discussed above {{is seen in}} another form in debates over the foundations of statistics. The standard approach to statistical hypothesis testing avoids claims about whether evidence supports a hypothesis or makes it more probable. Instead, the typical test yields a p-value, which is the probability of the evidence being such as it is, {{under the assumption that}} <b>the</b> <b>hypothesis</b> being tested is true. If the p-value is too low, <b>the</b> <b>hypothesis</b> is rejected, in a way analogous to falsification. In contrast, Bayesian inference seeks to assign probabilities to hypotheses. Related topics in philosophy of statistics include probability interpretations, overfitting, and the difference between correlation and causation.|$|E

5|$|Although certain {{levels of}} {{antioxidant}} vitamins {{in the diet}} are required for good health, there is considerable debate on whether antioxidant-rich foods or supplements have anti-disease activity.

5|$|An {{adaptation}} is an observable {{structure or}} other feature of an organism (for example, an enzyme) generated {{by natural selection}} to serve its current function. A biologist might propose <b>the</b> <b>hypothesis</b> that feathers are adaptations for bird flight. That would require three things: that the trait of having feathers is heritable; that the trait does serve the function of flight; and that the trait increases the fitness of the organisms that have it. Feathers clearly meet these three conditions in living birds. However, {{there is also a}} historical question, namely, did the trait arise {{at the same time as}} bird flight? Unfortunately for <b>the</b> <b>hypothesis,</b> this seems not to be so: theropod dinosaurs had feathers, but many of them did not fly. Feathers can be described as an exaptation, having been co-opted for flight but having evolved earlier for another purpose such as insulation. Biologists may describe both the co-option and the earlier adaptation in teleological language.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} pathophysiological {{mechanism of}} leukemogenesis in AML is the epigenetic induction of dedifferentiation by genetic mutations that alter {{the function of}} epigenetic enzymes, such as the DNA demethylase TET2 and the metabolic enzymes IDH1 and IDH2, which lead to the generation of a novel oncometabolite, D-2-hydroxyglutarate, which inhibits the activity of epigenetic enzymes such as TET2. <b>The</b> <b>hypothesis</b> is that such epigenetic mutations lead to the silencing of tumor suppressor genes and/or the activation of proto-oncogenes.|$|E
