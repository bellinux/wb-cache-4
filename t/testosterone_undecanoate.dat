25|$|Oral {{testosterone}} {{is provided}} exclusively as <b>testosterone</b> <b>undecanoate.</b> It {{is available in}} Europe and Canada, {{but not in the}} United States. Once absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, testosterone is shunted (at very high blood levels) to the liver where it can cause liver damage (albeit very rarely) and worsens some of the adverse effects of testosterone, like lower HDL (good) cholesterol. In addition, the first pass metabolism of the liver also may result in testosterone levels too low to provide satisfactory masculinization and suppress menses. Because of the short terminal half-life of testosterone, oral <b>testosterone</b> <b>undecanoate</b> must be administered two to four times per day, preferably with food (which improves its absorption).|$|E
25|$|In 2003 the FDA {{approved}} a buccal form of testosterone (Striant). Sublingual testosterone {{can also be}} made by some compounding pharmacies.

25|$|The most {{commonly}} used AAS in medicine are testosterone and its various esters (but {{most commonly}} <b>testosterone</b> <b>undecanoate,</b> testosterone enanthate, testosterone cypionate, and testosterone propionate), nandrolone esters (most commonly nandrolone decanoate and nandrolone phenylpropionate), stanozolol, and metandienone (methandrostenolone). Others also available and used commonly but {{to a lesser extent}} include methyltestosterone, oxandrolone, mesterolone, and oxymetholone, as well as drostanolone propionate, metenolone (methylandrostenolone), and fluoxymesterone. Dihydrotestosterone (DHT; androstanolone, stanolone) and its esters are also notable, although they are not widely used in medicine. Boldenone undecylenate and trenbolone acetate are used in veterinary medicine.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} the actual impact of testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) on patients with lower urinary tract symptom (LUTS), without benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) medication. Materials and Methods: Two hundreds forty-six patients underwent TRT using intramuscular injection of 3 months bases injection of <b>testosterone</b> 100 mg <b>undecanoate</b> over a year. Among them, 17 patients had moderate LUTS with a maximal flow rate {{of at least}} 10 ml/s but did not take any BPH-specific medication during TRT. The changes in prostate specific anti-gen (PSA), International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), and uroflowmetery were measured before and after TRT. Results: After TRT, PSA remained unchanged {{after a year of}} treatment (p= 0. 078). Compared with their counterparts (n= 229), the patients without BPH medication had similar baseline prostate characteristics in all variables, including pros-tate volume, IPSS, maximal flow rate, voiding volume, and PSA, except the median amount of residual urine, which was higher in the patients without BPH medication (21 ml vs. 10 ml). In the no-BPH medication group, the total IPSS score was decreased significantly (p= 0. 028), both in storage symptoms (questionnaire 2, 4, 7) and voiding symptoms (questionnaire 1, 3, 5, 6), while the maximal flow rate and residual urine amount remained unchanged after a year of TRT.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{retrospective}} {{observational study}} was to evaluate whether adding liraglutide to lifestyle changes, metformin (Met) and testosterone replacement therapy (TRT), by means of improving weight and glycaemic control, could boost erectile function in type 2 diabetic obese men with overt hypogonadism and erectile dysfunction (ED) in a 'real-life setting'. Forty-three obese, diabetic and hypogonadal men (aged 45 - 59 years) were evaluated because of complaining about the recent onset of ED. They were subdivided into two groups according to whether hypogonadism occurred after puberty (G 1; n = 30 : 25 with dysfunctional hypogonadism and 5 with acquired hypogonadotropic hypogonadism) or before puberty (G 2; n = 13 : 10 with Klinefelter's syndrome and 3 with idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism). Both G 1 and G 2 patients were given a combination of <b>testosterone</b> (T) [testosterone <b>undecanoate</b> (TU) 1000 mg/every 12 weeks] and Met (2000 - 3000 mg/day) for 1 year. In the poor responders (N) to this therapy in terms of glycaemic target (G 1 N: n = 16; G 2 N: n = 10), liraglutide (L) (1. 2 μg/day) was added for a second year, while the good responders (Y) to T + Met (G 1 Y: 14 / 30 and G 2 Y: 3 / 13) continued this two drugs regimen therapy for another year. All patients were asked {{to fill in the}} International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF 15) questionnaire before starting TU plus Met (T 1) and after 12 months (T 2) and 24 months (T 3) of treatment. Patients underwent a clinical examination and a determination of serum sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), total testosterone (T) and glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA 1 c) at T 1, T 2 and T 3. At T 2, each patient obtained an improvement of ED (p 7. 5 % (> 58 mmol/mol) ], while T turned out to be within the range of young men. L added to TU and Met regimen in G 1 N and G 2 N allowed these patients to reach not only the glycaemic target [HbA 1 c = < 7. 5 % (< 58 nmol/mol) ] and a significant reduction in body weight (p < 0. 01), but also a further increase in SHBG (p < 0. 05) and T (p < 0. 01) plasma levels as well as a significant increment of IIEF score (T 3). Conversely, at T 3 G 1 Y and G 2 Y, who received the combined therapy with TRT and Met for the second year, showed a partial failure of that treatment given that there was no improvement of the IIEF score and they showed a significant rise in serum HbA 1 c (p < 0. 05) and weight (p < 0. 04) compared with the assessments at T 2. These results suggest that TRT could improve clinical and metabolic parameters in obese, type 2 diabetic men with ED and overt hypogonadism (independently of when T deficit occurred). Furthermore, in case of insufficient metabolic control the addition of L to TRT and Met regimen allows to achieve serum T levels in the range of healthy men, as well as to reach glycaemic target and to lower weight, leading to a considerable improvement of ED...|$|R
25|$|Aside from prohormones and <b>testosterone</b> <b>undecanoate,</b> {{almost all}} orally active AAS are 17α-alkylated. A few AAS {{that are not}} 17α-alkylated are orally active. Some {{examples}} include the testosterone 17-ethers cloxotestosterone, quinbolone, and silandrone, which are prodrugs (to testosterone, boldenone (Δ1-testosterone), and testosterone, respectively), the DHT 17-ethers mepitiostane, mesabolone, and prostanozol (which are also prodrugs), the 1-methylated DHT derivatives mesterolone and metenolone (although these are relatively weak AAS), and the 19-nortestosterone derivatives dimethandrolone and 11β-MNT, which have improved resistance to first-pass hepatic metabolism due to their 11β-methyl groups (in contrast to them, the related AAS trestolone (7α-methyl-19-nortestosterone) is not orally active). As these AAS are not 17α-alkylated, they show minimal potential for hepatotoxicity.|$|E
25|$|Non-17α-alkylated {{testosterone}} derivatives such as testosterone itself, DHT, and nandrolone {{all have}} poor oral bioavailability due to extensive first-pass hepatic metabolism and hence are not orally active. A notable {{exception to this}} are AAS that are androgen precursors or prohormones, including dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), androstenediol, androstenedione, boldione (androstadienedione), bolandiol (norandrostenediol), bolandione (norandrostenedione), dienedione, mentabolan (MENT dione, trestione), and methoxydienone (methoxygonadiene) (although these are relatively weak AAS). AAS that are not orally active are used almost exclusively {{in the form of}} esters administered by intramuscular injection, which act as depots and function as long-acting prodrugs. Examples include testosterone, as testosterone cypionate, testosterone enanthate, and testosterone propionate, and nandrolone, as nandrolone phenylpropionate and nandrolone decanoate, among many others (see here for a full list of testosterone and nandrolone esters). An exception is the very long-chain ester <b>testosterone</b> <b>undecanoate,</b> which is orally active, albeit with only very low oral bioavailability (approximately 3%). In contrast to most other AAS, 17α-alkylated testosterone derivatives show resistance to metabolism due to steric hindrance and are orally active, though they may be esterified and administered via intramuscular injection as well.|$|E
2500|$|... 'Depot' drug {{formulations}} {{are created}} by mixing a substance with the drug that slows its release and prolongs {{the action of the}} drug. The two primarily used forms in the United States are the testosterone esters testosterone cypionate (Depo-Testosterone) and testosterone enanthate (Delatestryl) which are almost interchangeable. Testosterone enanthate is purported to be slightly better with respect to even testosterone release, but this is probably more of a concern for bodybuilders who use the drugs at higher doses (250–1000mg/week) than the replacement doses used by transgender men (50–100mg/week). These testosterone esters are mixed with different oils, so some individuals may tolerate one better than the other. Testosterone enanthate costs more than testosterone cypionate and is more typically the one prescribed for hypogonadal males in the United States. Testosterone cypionate is more popular in the United States than elsewhere (especially amongst bodybuilders). Other formulations exist but are more difficult to come by in the United States. A formulation of injected testosterone available in Europe and the United States, <b>testosterone</b> <b>undecanoate</b> (Nebido, Aveed) [...] provides significantly improved testosterone delivery with far less variation outside the eugonadal range than other formulations with injections required only four times yearly. However, each quarterly dose requires injection of 4mL of oil which may require multiple simultaneous injections. <b>Testosterone</b> <b>undecanoate</b> is also much more expensive as it is still under patent protection. Testosterone propionate is another testosterone ester that is widely available, including in the United States, Canada, and Europe, but it is very short-acting compared to the other testosterone esters and must be administered once every 2 or 3 days, and for this reason, is rarely used.|$|E
2500|$|Testosterone {{has been}} used to {{successfully}} treat undervirilization in some [...] but not all [...] men with PAIS, despite having supraphysiological levels of testosterone to start with.

[...] Supraphysiological doses may be required to achieve the desired physiological effect, which may be difficult to achieve using non-injectable testosterone preparations. [...] Exogenous testosterone supplementation in unaffected men can produce various unwanted side effects, including prostatic hypertrophy, polycythemia, gynecomastia, hair loss, acne, and the suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, resulting in the reduction of gonadotropins (i.e., luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone) and spermatogenic defect. [...] These effects may not manifest at all in men with AIS, or might only manifest at a much higher concentration of testosterone, depending on the degree of androgen insensitivity. [...] Those undergoing high dose androgen therapy should be monitored for safety and efficacy of treatment, possibly including regular breast [...] and prostate [...] examinations. [...] Some individuals with PAIS have a sufficiently high sperm count to father children; at least one case report has been published that describes fertile men who fit the criteria for grade 2 PAIS (micropenis, penile hypospadias, and gynecomastia).

50|$|Although {{testosterone}} {{itself is}} not used orally, <b>testosterone</b> <b>undecanoate</b> is approved and used orally.

In addition to <b>testosterone</b> <b>undecanoate,</b> the combination of testosterone with a 5α-reductase inhibitor like dutasteride can render testosterone orally active when it is given in the form of oil-filled capsules.

5000|$|Whereas the {{terminal}} half-life of unesterified testosterone administered via intramuscular injection is very short at only around 10 minutes, {{the terminal}} half-lives of intramuscular testosterone esters are far longer.

Although exact values are not available for intramuscular testosterone cypionate, its pharmacokinetics are said to be the same as those of testosterone enanthate, with [...] "extremely comparable" [...] patterns of testosterone release. Due to their varying and different terminal half-lives, the different intramuscular testosterone esters are administered with differing frequencies. Testosterone propionate is injected two to three times per week, testosterone enanthate and testosterone cypionate are injected once every two to four weeks, and <b>testosterone</b> <b>undecanoate</b> and testosterone buciclate are injected once every 10 to 14 weeks. Due to its relatively short duration, testosterone propionate is now relatively little used and <b>testosterone</b> <b>undecanoate</b> is the preferred testosterone ester for intramuscular use. <b>Testosterone</b> <b>undecanoate</b> and testosterone buciclate can be injected intramuscularly as little as four times per year.|$|E
50|$|Testosterone {{was first}} {{isolated}} and synthesized in 1935. Shortly thereafter, in 1937, testosterone first became commercially {{available as a}} pharmaceutical drug {{in the form of}} pellets and then in ester form for intramuscular injection as the relatively short-acting testosterone propionate. Methyltestosterone, one of the first synthetic AAS and orally active androgens, was introduced in 1935, but was associated with hepatotoxicity and eventually became largely medically obsolete. In the mid-1950s, the longer-acting testosterone esters testosterone enanthate and testosterone cypionate were introduced. They largely superseded testosterone propionate and became the major testosterone esters used medically for over half a century. In the 1970s, <b>testosterone</b> <b>undecanoate</b> was introduced for oral use in Europe, although intramuscular <b>testosterone</b> <b>undecanoate</b> had already been in use in China for several years.

50|$|The {{terminal}} half-life of testosterone {{varies depending on}} the route of administration and formulation and {{on whether or not}} it is esterified. Oral <b>testosterone</b> <b>undecanoate</b> (in oil capsules) has a {{terminal half-life}} of 1.6 hours. Because of its very short terminal half-life, oral <b>testosterone</b> <b>undecanoate</b> is taken two to four times per day. In contrast to oral testosterone, other forms of testosterone including topical gels and solutions, transdermal patches, and buccal tablets have an extended-release effect and can be administered less frequently, at intervals, depending on the route/formulation, of once a day, twice a day, or once every other day.|$|E

50|$|Testosterone, as esters such as <b>{{testosterone}}</b> <b>undecanoate</b> or testosterone buciclate, {{has been}} studied and promoted as a male contraceptive analogous to estrogen-based contraceptives in women.

50|$|A single {{intramuscular}} injection of testosterone buciclate {{in an aqueous}} suspension {{has been found to}} produce physiological levels of testosterone within the normal range in hypogonadal men for 3 to 4 months. The elimination half-life and mean residence time (average amount of time a single molecule of drug stays in the body) of testosterone buciclate were found to be 29.5 days and 60.0 days, respectively, whereas those of testosterone enanthate in castor oil were only 4.5 days and 8.5 days. Testosterone buciclate also lasts longer than <b>testosterone</b> <b>undecanoate,</b> which has elimination half-lives and mean residence times of 20.9 days and 34.9 days in tea seed oil and 33.9 days and 36.0 days in castor oil, respectively.

50|$|A {{pharmacokinetic}} study of DMAU in men {{found that only}} 2 to 3% of the drug was hydrolyzed into dimethandrolone when it was administered orally {{in the form of}} powder in capsules. In contrast, hydrolysis of <b>testosterone</b> <b>undecanoate</b> into testosterone is rapid and appears to be complete. The difference in conversion efficiency with DMAU relative to <b>testosterone</b> <b>undecanoate</b> is attributed to steric hindrance in DMAU caused by its additional C7α and C11β methyl groups. Although the hydrolysis of DMAU into dimethandrolone was very limited, it was still sufficient to produce dose-dependent biological effects at the dosages assessed, including reversible suppression of luteinizing hormone (LH) and testosterone levels. A subsequent {{pharmacokinetic study}} found that the conversion of DMAU into dimethandrolone was improved when the drug was delivered orally in castor oil/benzyl benzoate or a self-emulsifying drug delivery system contained in capsules as opposed to powder in capsules.|$|E
