5|$|In some countries, {{particularly}} Germany and England, memorials used {{a medieval}} style, reaching {{back to a}} more distant past. Some of these medieval styled memorials were set in existing medieval buildings, fusing older and newer themes. Memorial church windows, for example, could combine medieval and modern features, including armoured knights on horseback, modern weapons-including-tanks and aircraft-and modern national flags. Other memorials deliberately chose medieval themes and symbols, such as the Tomb of the Unknown Warrior in Westminster, where {{the language of the}} inscriptions was deliberately archaic, and the tomb itself made from a medieval chest, decorated with a crusader's sword. England's patron saint, Saint George, was a particular popular symbol in British designs, typically shown mounted and wearing armour. The Arthurian Round <b>Table</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> medieval crusades proved popular themes in Canadian memorials.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the early}} pieces of furniture, such as the Narcissus Washstand, the Zodiac Settle and the Great Bookcase, were {{originally}} made for Burges's office at Buckingham Street and were later moved to the Tower House. The Great Bookcase was also part of Burges's contribution to the Medieval Court at the 1862 International Exhibition. Later pieces, such as the Crocker Dressing <b>Table</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Golden Bed, and its accompanying Vita Nuova Washstand, were made specifically for the house. John Betjeman located the Narcissus Washstand in a junk shop in Lincoln {{and gave it to}} Evelyn Waugh, a fellow enthusiast for Victorian art and architecture, who featured it in his 1957 novel, The Ordeal of Gilbert Pinfold. Betjeman later gave Waugh both the Zodiac Settle and the Philosophy Cabinet.|$|E
5|$|York {{spent most}} of the season in midtable, and having been as low as 19th in the table in November went on to reach sixth place during the last month of the season. The team's goals scored tally of 55 was the lowest of any team in {{the top half of the}} <b>table,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> sixth lowest of any team in the division. Ingham and Meredith made the highest number of {{appearances}} during the season, each appearing in 51 of York's 52 matches. Rankine was York's top scorer in the league and in all competitions, with 12 league goals and 14 in total. He was the only player to reach double figures, and was followed by Reed with nine goals.|$|E

5|$|A {{few years}} after the strike, the world's silver market dropped, causing the {{foreclosure}} {{of many of the}} mines. To compensate for the drop in prices, the mines' stockholders reduced the wages of the miners. Instead of striking again, the miners accepted this. In addition, the miners inadvertently dug below the water <b>table,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> mine shafts began filling with water faster than it could be pumped out. By 1884, most of the mines were idle or closed; the last was officially closed in 1891, although lessees of the mines continued to operate them past that year. Many merchants went bankrupt and left town. The Silver Reef mines produced about $8million worth of silver ore. Between 1891 and 1901, another $250,000 worth was mined. Several people attempted to restart mining operations in 1898, 1909, 1916, and 1950, but none of these attempts were successful. After Silver Reef's mines were closed, many of the buildings were purchased for their lumber and building stone. One buyer dismantled the building he bought and discovered $10,000 in gold coins. News of the find spread quickly, and most of the buildings in Silver Reef were demolished in hopes of discovering more gold, but none was found.|$|E
5|$|In the {{accordion}} experiment, Home {{sat at a}} table, with Crookes and another observer {{on either side of}} him, each with a foot on one of Home's feet. Home inserted his hand inside a wire cage that was pushed under the table. One of Home's hands was placed {{on the top of the}} <b>table,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> other inside the cage which held an accordion on the non-key side, so the keyed end was hanging downwards. The accordion was reported to have played musical sounds. However, the amount of light in the room was not stated, and {{the accordion}} was not observed in good light. According to Frank Podmore there was no evidence the accordion played at all, as the keys were not observed to have moved. Podmore suggested the musical sounds could have come from an automatic instrument that Home had concealed.|$|E
5|$|NASA {{maintains}} {{a catalog of}} Venus transits covering the period 2000 BCE to 4000 CE. Currently, transits occur only in June or December (see <b>table)</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> occurrence of these events slowly drifts, becoming {{later in the year}} by about two days every 243-year cycle. Transits usually occur in pairs, on nearly the same date eight years apart. This is because the length of eight Earth years is almost the same as 13 years on Venus, so every eight years the planets are in roughly the same relative positions. This approximate conjunction usually results in a pair of transits, but it is not precise enough to produce a triplet, since Venus arrives 22 hours earlier each time. The last transit not {{to be part of a}} pair was in 1396. The next will be in 3089; in 2854 (the second of the 2846/2854 pair), although Venus will just miss the Sun as seen from the Earth's equator, a partial transit will be visible from some parts of the southern hemisphere.|$|E

5|$|Pulmonic {{consonant}} {{letters are}} arranged singly or in pairs of voiceless (tenuis) and voiced sounds, with these then grouped in columns from front (labial) sounds {{on the left}} to back (glottal) sounds on the right. In official publications by the IPA, two columns are omitted to save space, with the letters listed among 'other symbols', and with the remaining consonants arranged in rows from full closure (occlusives: stops and nasals), to brief closure (vibrants: trills and taps), to partial closure (fricatives) and minimal closure (approximants), again with a row left out to save space. In the table below, a slightly different arrangement is made: All pulmonic consonants {{are included in the}} pulmonic-consonant <b>table,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> vibrants and laterals are separated out so that the rows reflect the common lenition pathway of stop → fricative → approximant, as well as the fact that several letters pull double duty as both fricative and approximant; affricates may be created by joining stops and fricatives from adjacent cells. Shaded cells are judged to be implausible.|$|E
5|$|The Central Intelligence Agency {{analysed}} {{the effects}} of Operation Deliberate Force and Operations Maestral 2 and Sana, and noted that the NATO air campaign did not degrade VRS combat capability as much as was expected, because the airstrikes were never primarily directed at field-deployed units but at command and control infrastructure. This analysis noted that, while the NATO air campaign did degrade VRS capabilities, the final offensives by the HV, HVO and the ARBiH did the most damage. The analysis further concluded that the ground offensives, rather than the NATO bombardment, were responsible for bringing the Bosnian Serbs to the negotiation <b>table</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> war to its end. However, author Robert C. Owen argues that the HV would not have advanced as rapidly as it did had NATO not intervened and hampered the VRS defence by denying it long-range communications.|$|E
