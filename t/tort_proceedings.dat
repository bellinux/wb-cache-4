Also, {{it becomes clear that}} Varrick did not seriously intend to negotiate. Thereupon, [...] Alisandros withdraws as co-counsel in the Chicago case, leaving Finley & Figg holding the sack.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{examines}} {{the notion of}} non-point source emission as well as legal methods, procedures, for restoration of environmental damage. It is pointed out that non-point source pollution is generated from several polluters. Joint activity of polluters calls for measures of ecological restoration, instead of <b>tort</b> <b>proceedings.</b> However, non-point source emissions may result in standard case tort provided human health is affected, lives are lost or property is damaged or destroyed. In this article two types of <b>tort</b> <b>proceedings</b> are being examined: those initiated by an action for elimination {{of the source of}} pollution, when the environmental risk is emerging and an action for compensation of damages, when the damage has already occurred, prior to the action being filed. Further, the author points to the problem of causation given that with non-point emissions each individual act of emission does not cause damage by itself; however it contributes to an emergence of damage in joint activity with other emissions. For these reasons, lawmakers opted for joint and severe liability in cases of non-point emissions...|$|E
40|$|The {{civil war}} in Syria has been raging for over almost six years now. Since 2011, several armed groups have been {{fighting}} government forces and each other for control over portions of Syrian territory. The most well-known of these groups proclaimed itself as the ‘Islamic State’ (IS). Under the leadership of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, IS controls substantial parts of the territory of Syria and Iraq. It has been documented that IS perpetrated and perpetrates international crimes (war crimes, crimes against humanity, possibly even genocide) against the population living in the territories they control, notably against the ethnic-religious group of the Yezidis. This contribution focuses on crimes of sexual violence committed against Yezidi women and girls. IS controls every part of life of Yezidi women and girls, dictating them what to wear and with whom they may enter public life. Violations of IS regulations result in physical and psychological punishments. Women and girls are killed, tortured, raped, and traded or held as slaves. The international community has concentrated its efforts on militarily defeating IS. The question remains, however, whether and how IS and its members could {{be held accountable for}} their transgressions. We assess a number of criminal and non-criminal accountability mechanisms that could be envisaged or have already been implemented: international and national criminal proceedings (Sections 3 and 4), national <b>tort</b> (civil) <b>proceedings</b> (Section 5), and international administrative sanctions (Section 6). It also inquires briefly whether and how compliance of IS with international (humanitarian) law could be furthered (Section 7). First, however, any remaining doubts as to the applicability of international humanitarian law to IS will be dispelled (Section 2) ...|$|R
