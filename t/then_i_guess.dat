500|$|Morrison {{has said}} he {{believes}} in the jazz improvisational technique of never performing a song the same way twice and except for the unique rendition of the Astral Weeks songs live, doesn't perform a concert from a preconceived set list. Morrison {{has said he}} prefers to perform at smaller venues or symphony halls noted for their good acoustics. His ban against alcoholic beverages, which made entertainment news during 2008, {{was an attempt to}} prevent the disruptive and distracting movement of audience members leaving their seats during the performances. In a 2009 interview, Morrison stated: [...] "I do not consciously aim to take the listener anywhere. If anything, I aim to take myself there in my music. If the listener catches the wavelength of what I am saying or singing, or gets whatever point whatever line means to them, <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> as a writer I may have done a day's work." ...|$|E
500|$|In several {{interviews}} {{around the}} release, Carter {{said that if}} the X-Files: I Want to Believe film proved successful at the box office, a third installment would be made going back to the TV series' mythology, focusing specifically on the alien invasion and colonization of Earth foretold in the ninth-season finale, due to occur on December 22, 2012. In an October 2009 interview, David Duchovny likewise said he wanted to do a 2012 X-Files movie, but did not know if he would get the chance. Anderson stated in August 2012 that a third X-Files film is [...] "looking pretty good". As of July 2013, Fox had not approved the movie, although Carter, Spotnitz, Duchovny and Anderson expressed interest. At the New York Comic Con held October 10–13, 2013, Duchovny and Anderson reaffirmed that they and Carter are interested in making a third film, with Anderson saying “If it takes fan encouragement to get Fox interested in that, <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> that's what it would be.” ...|$|E
500|$|In April 2011 {{before the}} release of Thor (2011), Marvel Studios {{president}} Kevin Feige stated that following The Avengers (2012), [...] "Thor will go off into a new adventure." [...] Kenneth Branagh, director of Thor, responded to his comments, saying, [...] "It is kind of news to me. Here's what I would say to that: It's that I'm thrilled they're that confident. I shall wait for the audience to tell us whether {{there should be a}} second one, and then if that's a nice conversation to be had [...] all of us, that'd be thrilling. But I've got too much Irish superstitious blood in me to assume that Thor 2 will happen. But if Marvel says so, <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> it must be true". Feige later explained that Marvel Studios would gauge how well Thor did at the box office before announcing sequels, but stated, [...] "Don Payne is working on story ideas for a part two. We've got various options with Ken [...] to discuss coming back, but right now {{the focus is on the}} first one. Don is, slowly but surely, thinking about where to take the character next should we be so lucky".|$|E

6000|$|... "All right, it's talk, <b>then?</b> But <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> you and <b>I</b> {{will have}} some more talk after a while,--after Theodore Watling gets to be United States Senator. Give him my regards, and--and come in when I can do {{anything}} for you, Mr. Paret." ...|$|R
6000|$|About {{this time}} I was rather anxious about Harry. He was restless and unhappy; {{it was some}} time before I {{could make out the}} reason, and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>guessed,</b> that whether from the idea of Polly being married, or why, I know not, but that he {{had fallen in love with}} Planter's pretty sister. Of course, Harry, in his present circumstances, could not think of marrying; and I knew {{whatever}} he felt, that he was one of the last men in the world to become engaged unless he could keep a wife. I said one day,-- ...|$|R
500|$|Barton {{does not}} believe Hollywood offers the same opportunity. In the film, Los Angeles {{is a world of}} false fronts and phony people. This is evident in an early line of the {{screenplay}} (filmed, but not included in the theatrical release); while informing Barton of Capitol Pictures' offer, his agent tells him: [...] "I'm only asking that your decision be informed by a little realism– [...] if I can use that word and Hollywood in the same breath". Later, as Barton tries to explain why he's staying at the Earle, studio head Jack Lipnick finishes his sentence, recognizing that Barton wants a place that is [...] "less Hollywood". The assumption is that Hollywood is fake and the Earle is genuine. Producer Ben Geisler takes Barton to lunch at a restaurant featuring a mural of the [...] "New York Cafe", a sign of Hollywood's effort to replicate the authenticity of the East Coast. Lipnick's initial overwhelming exuberance is also a façade. Although he begins by telling Barton: [...] "The writer is king here at Capitol Pictures", in the penultimate scene he insists: [...] "If your opinion mattered, <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> I'd resign and let you run the studio. It doesn't, and you won't, and the lunatics are not going to run this particular asylum".|$|E
2500|$|The band's {{first song}} written {{together}} was [...] "Conspiracy", which was later used on their debut album. At this time, they were touring the southeast, usually {{being driven by}} Williams' parents. She commented that [...] "Back <b>then,</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> we were all thinking, after school we'll go {{to the house and}} practice. It was what we loved to do for fun, and still do! I don't think any of us really knew this {{would turn out to be}} what it's become." ...|$|E
2500|$|Pattinson began {{modelling}} {{at the age}} of 12, but his workload {{began to}} decrease four years later. In December 2008, he blamed the lack of modelling work on his masculine appearance: [...] "When I first started I was quite tall and looked like a girl, so I got lots of jobs, because it was during that period where the androgynous look was cool. <b>Then,</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess,</b> I became too much of a guy, so I never got any more jobs. I had the most unsuccessful modelling career." [...] Pattinson appeared in the advertising campaign for Hackett's autumn 2007 collection.|$|E
60|$|So I looked, {{examining}} Umbezi's ample proportions with care, {{but could}} discover nothing except a large smudge of black mud, {{as though he}} had sat down in a half-dried puddle. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>guessed</b> the truth. The buffalo's horns had missed him. He had been struck only with its muddy nose, which, being almost as broad as that portion of Umbezi with which it came in contact, had inflicted nothing worse than a bruise. When I was sure he had received no serious injury, my temper, already sorely tried, gave out, and I administered to him the soundest smacking--his position being very convenient--that he had ever received since he was a little boy.|$|R
5000|$|The {{back cover}} of the vinyl album {{featured}} a quote about Riperton from each artist who participated, and their signature (a thumbprint for Stevie Wonder). Wonder's quote inspired the album title: [...] "I miss you because I cannot touch you...but <b>then</b> again, <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> that <b>I</b> can because you're touching me...so, Love lives forever".|$|R
60|$|Even <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>guessed</b> {{that two}} {{arguments}} appealed to him, {{of which the}} first was that he desired, if possible, {{to put an end}} to this intolerable and unceasing hunt which had worn us all out, no matter what that end might be. The second and more powerful, however, was, I believed, and rightly, that the idea of this stealthy, midnight blow appealed irresistibly to the craft of his half-wild nature in which the strains of the leopard and the snake seemed to mingle with that of the human being. For be it remembered that notwithstanding his veneer of civilisation, Hans was a savage whose forefathers for countless ages had preserved themselves alive by means of such attacks and stratagems.|$|R

6000|$|... "Well, <b>then,</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> it's a {{good chance}} to give Mr. Dryfoos an idea of what we've really done--just while we're resting, as Artemus Ward says. Heigh, March?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now <b>then,</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> we {{had better}} hurry home, or we may be late for lunch," [...] said Sam, after {{consulting}} his watch. [...] "It is quarter of twelve." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "To proceed by land {{through the}} marshes at night was impossible, but I found my coracle, {{which we had}} hidden under the bushes, and poled up the channel after the Romans, who were now some {{distance}} ahead. The danger gave me strength, and I gained upon them. When I could hear their oars ahead I turned off by a cross channel so as to strike another leading direct hither. What was my horror when I reached it to see another flotilla of Roman boats passing along. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>guessed</b> that not only we but the watchers at all the other channels must have been surprised and killed by the treacherous Fenmen. I followed the boats till I reached a spot where I {{knew there was a}} track through the marshes to the island.|$|R
60|$|I {{hasten to}} add that she did nothing of the kind; {{she did not even}} shake hands with me. It was a {{gratification}} to her to see me and presently she told me why--because she was nervous when she was out-of-doors at night alone. The plants and bushes looked so strange in the dark, and there were all sorts of queer sounds--she could not tell what they were--like the noises of animals. She stood close to me, looking about her with an air of greater security but without any demonstration of interest in me as an individual. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>guessed</b> that nocturnal prowlings were not in the least her habit, and I was also reminded (I had been struck with the circumstance in talking with her before I took possession) {{that it was impossible to}} overestimate her simplicity.|$|R
500|$|According to Henderson, {{since the}} {{intelligent}} design movement uses ambiguous references to a designer, any conceivable entity may fulfill that role, including a Flying Spaghetti Monster. Henderson explained, [...] "I don't {{have a problem}} with religion. What I {{have a problem with}} is religion posing as science. If there is a god and he's intelligent, <b>then</b> <b>I</b> would <b>guess</b> he has a sense of humor." ...|$|R
60|$|K.--He hadn't a {{shilling}} <b>then.</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> he {{has plenty}} now. Elder brother killed, out hunting. Father dead. Tuf a baronet, with four thousand a year if he's a shilling.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{know whether}} it was my fault," [...] he said. [...] "The beast {{stumbled}} and almost jerked me over. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> the bridle either broke or pulled out." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Putney made a tchk of humorous patience, {{and laughed}} toward Annie for sympathy. [...] "Well, <b>then,</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> you needn't go on. Tea's ready. Shall {{we wait for}} the doctor?" ...|$|E
5000|$|April 10. — When I {{think of}} what I {{suffered}} with my stays, it seems very strange that they don't hurt me now. My waist is only 18 inches, and feels more comfortable than when I was squeezed in {{only a couple of}} inches. In fact, I think I enjoy the feeling of tightness. I know when I take off my stays to wash, I don't feel comfortable till I get them on again. And <b>then</b> <b>I</b> do <b>guess</b> my figure is sweet. Why, half the girls I know look like old dowdies. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> my aunt was right, though I did think she was too horrid cruel.|$|R
60|$|Presently {{she stopped}} {{and pointed at the}} brown object seated on the table. Sir Henry looked, and started back with an exclamation; and no wonder, for there, quite naked, the head which Curtis' battle-axe had shorn from the body resting on its knees, was the gaunt corpse of Twala, the last king of the Kukuanas. Yes, there, the head perched upon the knees, it sat in all its ugliness, the vertebræ {{projecting}} a full inch above the level of the shrunken flesh of the neck, {{for all the world like}} a black double of Hamilton Tighe.[2] Over the surface of the corpse there was gathered a thin glassy film, that made its appearance yet more appalling, for which we were, at the moment, quite unable to account, till presently we observed that from the roof of the chamber the water fell steadily, drip! drop! drip! on to the neck of the corpse, whence it ran down over the entire surface, and finally escaped into the rock through a tiny hole in the table. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>guessed</b> what the film was--Twala's body was being transformed into a stalactite.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is short, Baas," [...] {{the dwarf}} replied, {{as he put}} on his robe and turban. [...] "When I left you I watched, I who can see in the dark, and in a little while I saw the guard come down the steps and sit by the edge of the water. He was sleepy, for he yawned and lit a roll of paper to smoke it. Presently it went out, and he had no more matches. He looked up to the house there, but was too lazy to fetch them; <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>guessed</b> that he was alone, for else he would have called to his {{companion}} for fire. Now he grew sleepier, and I said to myself, 'Otter, Otter, how can you kill this man silently? You must not shoot, because of the noise; and if you throw a knife or a spear, you may miss, or wound him only.' And my snake spoke in my heart and answered, 'Otter, Otter, dive, seize his feet, and drag him down swiftly and stamp him into the mud, you who are half a fish and can swim as no other man can swim. Do it at once, Otter, before the light comes and men can see the drawbridge move.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now for {{civilian}} clothes once more!" [...] announced Tom Rover. [...] "And <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> {{it will be}} high {{time for me to}} get back to the offices in Wall Street." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Help me {{raise his}} {{shoulders}} a bit, and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> we’d better put some wet bandages on him. As they’ve cut the ’phone wires, send somebody {{to the nearest}} ranch for a horse to bring a doctor from Vancouver.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I do love to play--I mean--I like to drum on the piano, but I haven't had {{any real}} training. Mr. Judique {{used to say}} I would 've been a good pianist if I'd had any training, but <b>then,</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> he was just {{flattering}} me." ...|$|E
5000|$|The song titled [...] "Shalott" [...] on Emilie Autumn's 2006 album Opheliac {{tells the}} poem {{from her own}} perspective, where she quotes the Lady of Shalott as saying [...] "But <b>then,</b> <b>I</b> could have <b>guessed</b> it all along, 'cause now some drama queen is gonna write a song for me." [...] She uses imagery from the poem, and quotes it directly: [...] "I'm half sick of shadows".|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, but maw guessed we didn't care {{to go back}} to Hengist and Horsa, {{and when}} they let loose a lot of 'Debboroughs' and 'Daybrooks' upon us, maw kicked! We've got a drawing ten yards long, that looks like a sour apple tree, with lots of Desboroughs hanging up on the {{branches}} like last year's pippins, and <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> about as worm-eaten. We took that well enough, {{but when it came to}} giving us a map of straight lines and dashes with names written under them like an old Morse telegraph slip, struck by lightning, <b>then</b> maw and <b>I</b> <b>guessed</b> that it made us tired.|$|R
60|$|He made no {{immediate}} reply to that, either, but seemed more uneasy still. And I took occasion to note his appearance. He was exceeding neat in a livery {{of his old}} master, which he had stripped of the trimmings. <b>Then,</b> before <b>I</b> had <b>guessed</b> at his drift, he thrust his hand inside his coat and drew forth a pile of carefully folded bank notes.|$|R
6000|$|It was our hero, our madman of {{the seven}} and seventy seas, our revolutionist friend of Istra, who leaped {{straight}} from the salt-incrusted decks of his laboring steamer to the musty parlor and declared, quietly but unmovably-practically unmovably--"Well, <b>then,</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> I'd better not take it at all." ...|$|E
6000|$|Steel took {{my horse}} when I rode {{up to the}} house, {{and it was a}} {{coincidence}} that his first remark should be: [...] "We beat him badly this time and he'll lie low a while. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> you'll want both eyes open when he tries his luck again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “As soon as we’ve found if she’s {{still on}} the bank,” Moran said, as they were {{arranging}} their blankets on the lockers, “we’ll get out the net and all the lines we brought; <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> we had better keep the diving pump in a hole on the beach.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And <b>then</b> flew back. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> {{they play}} about the mountain-side, but don't make the top their home. And {{no doubt you}} think that, living so lonesome here, knowing nothing, hearing nothing--little, at least, but sound of thunder and the fall of trees--never reading, seldom speaking, yet ever wakeful, this is what gives me my strange thoughts--for so you call them--this weariness and {{wakefulness}} together Brother, who stands and works in open air, would I could rest like him; but mine is mostly but dull woman's work--sitting, sitting, restless sitting." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do I suppose it? You'll know {{it before}} long, Flask. But I am going now {{to keep a}} sharp {{look-out}} on him; and if I see anything very suspicious going on, I'll just take him by the nape of his neck, and say--Look here, Beelzebub, you don't do it; and if he makes any fuss, by the Lord I'll make a grab into his pocket for his tail, {{take it to the}} capstan, and give him such a wrenching and heaving, that his tail will come short off at the stump--do you see; and <b>then,</b> <b>I</b> rather <b>guess</b> when he finds himself docked in that queer fashion, he'll sneak off without the poor satisfaction of feeling his tail between his legs." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I didn't {{give him}} a chance," [...] Saxon confessed. [...] "Anyway Del Hancock and Aunt Sadie got married next day. And they were very happy afterward, only she died. And after that he was killed, with General Custer and all the rest, by the Indians. He {{was an old man}} by <b>then,</b> but <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> he got his share of Indians before they got him. Men like him always died fighting, and they took their dead with them. I used to know Al Stanley when I was a little girl. He was a gambler, but he was game. A {{railroad}} man shot him in the back when he was sitting at a table. That shot killed him, too. He died in about two seconds. But before he died he'd pulled his gun and put three bullets into the man that killed him." ...|$|R
