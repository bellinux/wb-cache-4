5|$|Some Black Hebrews renounced <b>their</b> <b>American</b> {{citizenship}} {{to try to}} prevent more deportations. In 1990, Illinois legislators helped negotiate an agreement that resolved the Black Hebrews' legal status in Israel. Members of the group are permitted to work and have access to housing and social services. The Black Hebrews reclaimed <b>their</b> <b>American</b> citizenship and have received aid from the U.S. government, which helped them build a school and additional housing. In 2003 the agreement was revised, and the Black Hebrews were granted permanent residency in Israel.|$|E

5|$|As {{the island}} rebuilt from the 1900 storm, {{legitimate}} business interests attempted {{to expand the}} economy by rebuilding tourism and further diversifying from shipping. Important non-entertainment businesses included insurance, hotels, banks, shipping, and commercial fishing.Obadele-Starks (2000), p. 4. The medical and nursing schools, {{as well as the}} hospitals of the University of Texas Medical Branch were a stable sector on the island throughout the 20th century. The Moody family built one of the largest hotel empires in the U.S., and <b>their</b> <b>American</b> National Insurance Company (ANICO) was so successful that it actually grew—tremendously—during the Depression.|$|E
5|$|At about 01:25 on 13 November, in near-complete {{darkness}} {{due to the}} {{bad weather}} and dark moon, the ships of the Imperial Japanese force entered the sound between Savo Island and Guadalcanal and prepared to bombard Henderson Field with the special ammunition loaded for the purpose. The ships arrived from an unexpected direction, coming not down the slot but from {{the west side of}} Savo Island, thus entering the sound from the northwest rather than the north. Unlike <b>their</b> <b>American</b> counterparts, the Japanese sailors had drilled and practiced night fighting extensively, conducting frequent live-fire night gunnery drills and exercises. This experience would be telling in not only the pending encounter, but in several other fleet actions off Guadalcanal in the months to come.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, the Imperial Japanese Navy was finally gaining {{authorization}} for its 'eight-eight battlefleet'. The , authorized in 1916, carried eight 16-inch guns like <b>their</b> <b>American</b> counterparts. The next year's naval bill authorized two more battleships {{and two more}} battlecruisers. The battleships, which became the , were to carry ten 16-inch guns. The battlecruisers, the , also carried ten 16-inch guns and were designed {{to be capable of}} 30 knots, capable of beating both the British Admiral- and the USNavy's Lexington-class battlecruisers.|$|E

5|$|Battered, Battleship Division Nine steamed {{into the}} {{anchorage}} of the Grand Fleet {{later that day}} to the tremendous cheering of {{the men on the}} assembled British warships. Wasting no time, Admiral Rodman called upon the commander of the Grand Fleet—Admiral Sir David Beatty—to offer the services of himself, his men, and his ships to the Allied cause. With Beatty's acceptance, the American battleships, while retaining <b>their</b> <b>American</b> designation of Battleship Division Nine, officially became the Sixth Battle Squadron of the Grand Fleet.|$|E
5|$|Both Sherman and McKinley {{sought a}} {{peaceful}} resolution to the Cuban War, preferably involving an independent Cuba without American intervention. The United States and Spain began negotiations on the subject in 1897, but {{it became clear that}} Spain would never concede Cuban independence, while the rebels (and <b>their</b> <b>American</b> supporters) would never settle for anything less. In January 1898, Spain promised some concessions to the rebels, but when American consul Fitzhugh Lee reported riots in Havana, McKinley agreed to send the battleship USS Maine there to protect American lives and property. On February 15, the Maine exploded and sank with 266 men killed.|$|E
5|$|Both the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) {{and state}} {{wildlife}} {{agencies in the}} South contributed to the American alligator's recovery. Protection under the Endangered Species Act allowed the species to recuperate in many areas {{where it had been}} depleted. States began monitoring <b>their</b> <b>American</b> alligator populations to ensure that they would continue to grow. In 1987, the USFWS removed the animal from the endangered species list, as it was considered to be fully recovered. The USFWS still regulates the legal trade in American alligators and their products to protect still endangered crocodilians that may be passed off as American alligators during trafficking.|$|E

The Calgary Flames selected him with their second round pick, 40th overall, in the 1996 NHL Entry Draft.

5|$|Genetic {{analysis}} {{has shown that}} certain mallards appear {{to be closer to}} their Indo-Pacific relatives while others are related to <b>their</b> <b>American</b> relatives. Mitochondrial DNA data for the D-loop sequence suggests that mallards may have evolved in the general area of Siberia. Mallard bones rather abruptly appear in food remains of ancient humans and other deposits of fossil bones in Europe, without a good candidate for a local predecessor species. The large ice age palaeosubspecies that made up at least the European and west Asian populations during the Pleistocene has been named Anas platyrhynchos palaeoboschas.|$|E
5|$|Impero {{was laid}} down in May 1938 and {{launched}} in November 1939. The entrance of Italy into World War II forced the Regia Marina to refocus its construction priorities on escort warships, so Impero was left incomplete. After Italy surrendered to the Allies on 8 September 1943, {{the rest of the}} Italian Navy steamed to Sardinia to rendezvous with <b>their</b> <b>American</b> contemporaries. Still incomplete in Trieste, Impero was captured by the Germans, who used the hulk for target practice. Sunk by Allied bombers in February 1945, she was refloated in 1947 and scrapped in Venice from 1948 to 1950.|$|E

5|$|In 1959, Fox {{cast her}} in two {{independent}} gangster films filmed in the United Kingdom: The Challenge and Too Hot to Handle. Both films were low-budget, and <b>their</b> <b>American</b> releases were delayed. Too Hot to Handle was not {{released in the}} United States until 1961 (as Playgirl After Dark), and The Challenge in 1963 (as It Takes a Thief). In the United States, censors objected to a scene in Too Hot to Handle where Mansfield, wearing silver netting with sequins painted over her nipples, appeared nearly nude.|$|E
5|$|In mid-1982, {{to commemorate}} their 20th anniversary, the Rolling Stones took <b>their</b> <b>American</b> stage show to Europe.

The band were joined by former Allman Brothers Band keyboardist Chuck Leavell, who {{continues}} to perform and record with the Rolling Stones. By {{the end of the}} year, the band had signed a new four-album recording deal with a new label, CBS Records, for a reported $50 million, then the biggest record deal in history.|$|E
5|$|Replacement {{pilots were}} pushed through an {{abbreviated}} training regimen {{in order to}} meet the short-term needs of the fleet. This led to a sharp decline in the quality of the aviators produced. These inexperienced pilots were fed into front-line units, while the veterans who remained after Midway and the Solomons campaign were forced to share an increased workload as conditions grew more desperate, with few being given a chance to rest in rear areas or in the home islands. As a result, Japanese naval air groups as a whole progressively deteriorated during the war while <b>their</b> <b>American</b> adversaries continued to improve.|$|E
