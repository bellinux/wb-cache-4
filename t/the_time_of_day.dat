5|$|Tornado {{occurrence}} {{is highly}} dependent on <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>day,</b> because of solar heating. Worldwide, most tornadoes occur in the late afternoon, between 3 pm and 7 pm local time, with a peak near 5 pm. Destructive tornadoes can occur {{at any time of}} day. The Gainesville Tornado of 1936, one of the deadliest tornadoes in history, occurred at 8:30 am local time.|$|E

5|$|A {{theodolite}} can {{be considerably}} more accurate if used correctly, {{but it is}} also considerably more difficult to use correctly. There is no inherent way to align a theodolite with North and so the scale has to be calibrated using astronomical observation, usually the position of the Sun. Because the position of celestial bodies changes with <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>day</b> due to the Earth's rotation, the time of these calibration observations must be accurately known, or else there will be a systematic error in the measurements. Horizon altitudes can be measured with a theodolite or a clinometer.|$|E
5|$|Industrialized {{societies}} generally {{follow a}} clock-based schedule for daily activities {{that do not}} change {{throughout the course of}} the year. <b>The</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>day</b> that individuals begin and end work or school, and the coordination of mass transit, for example, usually remain constant year-round. In contrast, an agrarian society's daily routines for work and personal conduct are more likely governed by the length of daylight hours and by solar time, which change seasonally because of the Earth's axial tilt. North and south of the tropics daylight lasts longer in summer and shorter in winter, with the effect becoming greater the further one moves away from the tropics.|$|E
5|$|Metro fares vary {{based on}} the {{distance}} traveled and <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>day</b> at entry. During peak hours (weekdays from opening until 9:30a.m. and 3–7p.m.), fares (effective 2014) range from $2.25 to $6.00, depending on distance traveled. At all other times, fares range from $2.00 to $3.85 based on distance traveled. Discounted fares are available for school children, the disabled, and the elderly. Metro charges reduced fares on all federal holidays.|$|E

To make fertilisation more likely, corals emit vast numbers of gametes, and many species synchronise their release in relation to <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>day</b> and the phase of the moon.|$|E
5|$|Several {{proposals}} {{have been made}} to bypass the Antelope Valley Freeway by boring a tunnel under the San Gabriel Mountains and extending the Glendale Freeway through it to the Antelope Valley. In 2003, Caltrans published a map showing potential improvements to the transportation infrastructure of southern California. The proposal showed both the unconstructed portion of Route 14 and new routes over or under the mountains to Antelope Valley. In 2005, the idea was advanced as a combination toll tunnel and surface highway. Preliminary studies estimated costs around $3 billion and suggested charging a varying toll, adjusted for <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>day,</b> averaging around $8 for one-way passage.|$|E
5|$|Aeron's main {{weapon is}} the Oraclos Chain, an {{artifact}} {{that can be}} used in multiple ways: it can tie up enemies, bind enemies together so they share damage taken when Aeron attacks, and swing them around Aeron to deal damage. The Chain can also be used to rip armor or materials from enemies. The Chain's attack power increases the longer it is pulled when attached to an enemy. In addition to the Oraclos Chain, Aeron has access to multiple subweapons, such as a sword. Puzzles within the Towers include activating levers and switches, manipulating platforms, triggering special mechanisms unique to each Tower environment, and climbing along walls and beams to reach other areas within the Towers. The Chain is essential to these puzzles, being used as a grappling hook and a rope from which Aeron can swing from one platform to another. Elements within the Towers, such as what enemies are active and what items may be found, vary with <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>day</b> Aeron visits them.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the mundane}} subject was {{constant}} throughout the Haystack series, the underlying theme {{may be seen}} as the transience of light. This concept enabled Monet to use repetition to show nuances of perception as <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>day,</b> the seasons and the weather changed. The almost unvarying subject provided the basis for him to compare changes of light and mood across his nuanced series. The first paintings in the series were started in late September or early October 1890, and he continued producing these paintings for about seven months. These paintings made Monet the first painter to paint such a large quantity of pictures of the same subject matter differentiated by light, weather, atmosphere and perspective.|$|E
5|$|Around the planisphere {{moves the}} rete, a {{web-like}} metal cutout representing the zodiac, which {{also features a}} Julian calendar dial. Above the rete, a display indicates {{the day of the}} week. Because leap days are not supported by the clockwork, the calendar hand has to be reset manually each leap year on 29 February. A moon dial circles the inner ring of the zodiac, displaying the moon phase. The principal hand of the clock indicates <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>day</b> on the outer ring of 24 golden Roman numerals, which run twice from I to XII. It features two suns, the smaller one indicating the date on the retes calendar dial. The larger one circles the zodiac at one revolution per year and also rotates across the planisphere once per day. Its crossing of the horizon and dawn lines twice per day allows the timing of sunrise, dawn, dusk and sunset.|$|E
5|$|In September 1978, the JFK Express began {{service and}} stopped at this station on racing days. The Aqueduct Specials ceased {{operation}} altogether in October 1981. At {{the time of their}} discontinuance the fare was $3, and it was being replaced by the more expensive $5 JFK Express fare. Between December 1991 and March 1992, after the JFK Express was discontinued, the Aqueduct Racetrack station was closed throughout the day, not reopening until the summer of 1997. The remaining service along the line would only be scheduled to stop on race days between 11 a.m. and 7 p.m., though some trains stopped here regardless of <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>day.</b> In the summer of 1997 the station {{became one of the first}} in the system to have Metrocard-only High Entrance/Exit Turnstiles.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Fifty-two {{patients}} with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia were studied to deter-mine {{whether there was}} a circadian pattern to the occurrence of this arrhythmia. Antiarrhythmic therapy was discontinued, and patients were followed until they had one recurrence of tachycardia documented by telephone transmission of the electrocardiogram. By least-squares analysis, <b>the</b> <b>times</b> <b>of</b> <b>day</b> that <b>the</b> 52 attacks (one from each patient) occurred were fit to a sinusoidal density function with a period of 24 hr. The highest relative incidence of tachycardia was at 4 P. M.; tachycardia was five times more likely to occur at 4 P. M. than at 4 A. M. <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lowest relative incidence. A second attack of tachycardia was recorded from 35 of the 52 patients. <b>The</b> <b>times</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two attacks in individual patients were found to be independent; thus <b>the</b> <b>times</b> <b>of</b> <b>day</b> at which <b>the</b> second attacks occurred were used as a test set for the distribution estimated from the first. The empirical distribution for <b>the</b> <b>times</b> from <b>the</b> 35 second attacks was compared with the distribution function estimated from the 52 first attacks, and there was no significant departure; this finding confirmed the circadian pattern. Since the relative incidence of attacks of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia is higher in the afternoon, it may be helpful to target antiarrhythmic therapy to that <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>day.</b> Circulation 77, No. 2, 298 - 300 1988...|$|R

5|$|In late 2005, FETA's {{committee}} {{approved a}} proposal for a revamp of the tolls. The minimum toll would be set to the existing £1figure, but would increase dependent on <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>day,</b> rising to a maximum of £4 for evening rush hour travel. All tolls would be halved for cars with more than one occupant, as an incentive to drivers to share cars and make fewer journeys. According to FETA's chairman Lawrence Marshall, the system would provide the most efficiency, claiming that 80% of peak-time journeys are made by single-occupant vehicles. The proposal, passed with the chairman's casting vote after the committee was deadlocked, was referred to the Scottish Executive in December 2005, and implementation planned for October 2007 subject to approval by transport minister Tavish Scott. Environmental groups welcomed the proposal, although local politicians condemned it as simply a means of raising capital. At the same time, a counter-argument was tabled by Fife councillors proposing the complete removal of tolls.|$|E
5|$|Other {{than its}} use in the kulintang ensemble, the agung also had other non-ensemble uses among the Maguindanao and Maranao. The agung {{has been used to}} warn others of {{impending}} danger, announcing <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>day</b> and other important occasions. For instance, long ago the sultan would beat the agung repeatedly to announce the onset of a meeting or during the fasting month of Ramadhan, the agung would ring either {{at three in the morning}} to indicate the signal to eat (sawl) or at sunset, to mark the end for fasting that day. And supposedly due to the deep, loud sound the agung produces, people believed that it possessed supernatural powers. For instance, during an earthquake, the locals of Maguindanao would strike the agung in a fast, loud rhythm called baru-baru, believing its vibrations would either lessen or even halt the jolt of an earthquake.|$|E
5|$|Pesticides are {{formulated}} to kill pests, {{but many}} have detrimental effects on non-target species; {{of particular concern}} is {{the damage done to}} honey-bees, solitary bees and other pollinating insects and in this regard, <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>day</b> when the spray is applied can be important. The widely used neonicotinoids have been banned on flowering crops in some countries because of their effects on bees. Some pesticides may cause cancer and other health problems in humans, as well as being harmful to wildlife. There can be acute effects immediately after exposure or chronic effects after continuous low-level, or occasional exposure. Maximum residue limits for pesticides in foodstuffs and animal feed are set by many nations.|$|E

5|$|Sonic Unleashed is a {{platform}} {{game in which}} the player controls the titular Sonic the Hedgehog in two modes: fast-paced levels that take place during daytime, showcasing Sonic's trademark speed as seen in previous games in the series, and slower, night-time levels, during which Sonic transforms into the Werehog, and gameplay switches to an action-based, brawler style of play, in which Sonic battles Gaia enemies (those created by the main enemy in the game, Dark Gaia). Each level takes place on a particular continent, {{each of which is}} based on a real-world location. In sections of the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions of the game, the player may choose to advance <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>day</b> in order to play as either Sonic or the Werehog; in the PlayStation 2 and Wii versions, time is advanced automatically.|$|E
5|$|Termite alates only {{leave the}} colony when a nuptial flight takes place. Alate {{males and females}} pair up {{together}} and then land {{in search of a}} suitable place for a colony. A termite king and queen do not mate until they find such a spot. When they do, they excavate a chamber big enough for both, close up the entrance and proceed to mate. After mating, the pair never go outside and spend {{the rest of their lives}} in the nest. Nuptial flight time varies in each species. For example, alates in certain species emerge during the day in summer while others emerge during the winter. The nuptial flight may also begin at dusk, when the alates swarm around areas with lots of lights. The time when nuptial flight begins depends on the environmental conditions, <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>day,</b> moisture, wind speed and precipitation. The number of termites in a colony also varies, with the larger species typically having 100–1,000 individuals.
