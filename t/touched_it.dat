5|$|Hogarth {{exhibited}} the painting at the Society of Artists in Spring Gardens in 1761. Although press reports – perhaps placed by Hogarth {{and his supporters}} – were enthusiastic, Sigismunda mourning over the Heart of Guiscardo was attacked by critics who marked Hogarth's attempt to emulate the drama depicted in older Italian paintings as foolhardy and ridiculous. Many critics were repulsed by the shocking contrast between the melancholy beauty of Sigismunda and the grotesquely bloody organ that she delicately <b>touched.</b> <b>It</b> was said that Hogarth placed an attendant next to the painting to note the remarks made by the viewers; changes to the painting suggest {{that he may have}} responded to these criticisms by altering his work, although it is impossible to ascertain whether many of the changes were made before or after the painting was exhibited.|$|E

25|$|The {{parallel}} {{chains of}} stretched rubber {{are susceptible to}} crystallization. This takes some time because turns of twisted chains have {{to move out of}} the way of the growing crystallites. Crystallization has occurred, for example, when, after days, an inflated toy balloon is found withered at a relatively large remaining volume. Where it is <b>touched,</b> <b>it</b> shrinks because the temperature of the hand is enough to melt the crystals.|$|E
25|$|If the offence fumbles (a ball carrier {{drops the}} football, or has it {{dislodged}} by an opponent, {{or if the}} intended player fails to catch a lateral pass or a snap from centre, or a kick attempt is blocked by an opponent), the ball may be recovered (and advanced) by either team. If a fumbled ball goes out of bounds, the team whose player last <b>touched</b> <b>it</b> is awarded possession {{at the spot where}} it went out of bounds. A fumble by the offence in their own end zone, which goes out of bounds, results in a safety.|$|E
25|$|In auditory-tactile synesthesia, certain sounds can induce sensations {{in parts}} of the body. For example, someone with auditory-tactile synesthesia may {{experience}} that hearing a specific word feels like touch in one specific part of the body or may experience that certain sounds can create a sensation in the skin without being <b>touched.</b> <b>It</b> is one of the least common forms of synesthesia. However, some speculate that the common phenomenon of autonomous sensory meridian response (ASMR), in which auditory stimuli or trigger words create a tingling sensation in the body without being touched, to be a form of auditory-tactile synesthesia, meaning that it could be more common than current statistics imply.|$|E

25|$|With 1:53 left, a loose ball {{went out}} of bounds and the {{officials}} initially ruled that Wisconsin’s Bronson Koenig <b>touched</b> <b>it</b> last, awarding the ball to Duke. After a lengthy replay review, the officials announced that the call would stand even though {{it appeared that the}} ball may have been last touched by Duke's Justise Winslow instead. A Jones 3-pointer on Duke's ensuing possession with 1:20 remaining then made it 66–58 before Frank Kaminsky narrowed the gap to 66–61. After a failed layup by Jones on a run out, Wisconsin cut the lead to 3 on a dunk. On the ensuing possession, Duke was fouled and made both free throws. A Wisconsin miss sealed the victory and Duke won by a final score of 68–63.|$|E
25|$|In the Rendlesham Forest {{incident}} of December 1980, U.S. military personnel witnessed UFOs near the air base at Woodbridge, Suffolk, {{over a period}} of three nights. On one night the deputy base commander, Colonel Charles I. Halt, and other personnel followed one or more UFOs that were moving in and above the forest for several hours. Col. Halt made an audio recording while this was happening and subsequently wrote an official memorandum summarizing the incident. After retirement from the military, {{he said that he had}} deliberately downplayed the event (officially termed 'Unexplained Lights') to avoid damaging his career. Other base personnel are said to have observed one of the UFOs, which had landed in the forest, and even gone up to and <b>touched</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{sacrifice}} {{of a bear}} for Artemis started with the Brauron cult. Every year a girl between five and ten years of age was sent to Artemis' temple at Brauron. The Byzantine writer Suidos relayed the legend in Arktos e Brauroniois. A bear was tamed by Artemis and introduced {{to the people of}} Athens. They <b>touched</b> <b>it</b> and played with it until one day a group of girls poked the bear until it attacked them. A brother of one of the girls killed the bear, so Artemis sent a plague in revenge. The Athenians consulted an oracle to understand how to end the plague. The oracle suggested that, in payment for the bear's blood, no Athenian virgin should be allowed to marry until she had served Artemis in her temple ('played the bear for the goddess').|$|E

25|$|C.J. Barnes, {{portrayed by}} David Spade (2004–2005), is Cate's nephew. He was {{once in the}} Army and claims to have studied aerial {{photography}} during the Gulf War, and to have received a Purple Heart in combat, which is in complete contrast with his generally childish attitude. He is {{a teacher at the}} school and often pursues women, albeit unsuccessfully. When C.J. first arrives, the family is initially surprised. He reveals to them that he was ashamed that he did not live up to be the person Paul had once said he would be and avoided them because of that. He lives along with his grandfather, Jim, in the basement (having previously lived in a van, which was burned by that same grandfather). He once dated Mrs. Krupp, his cousins' (Kerry and Bridget) math teacher, but he ended up cheating on her with his ex-girlfriend Cheryl. He once revealed that his first initial stands for Corey, but Rory said that was untrue. C.J. previously smoked marijuana heavily (and in fact used to smoke with Kyle's older brother), but at the start of his appearances, he claims not to have <b>touched</b> <b>it</b> in two years (he originally claimed it was five, though he relented after Jim expressed disbelief).|$|E
25|$|For D.C. United, {{the final}} month of MLS' regular season began {{the way the}} prior month ended -- with a victory, one that {{extended}} the winning streak to three games in a row. Following the midweek win over the Crew, United traveled to Toronto, where they faced a Toronto F.C. squad that had struggled since their star Giovinco was injured. Jozy Altidore, however, continued his hot streak. as he dribbled past both Birnbaum and Hamid and scored to stake the home team to a lead in the 36th minute. But, Neagle scored on a header three minutes later to level the score, when a goalmouth scramble forced a saved by the Toronto goalie that {{found its way to}} Neagle in front of the goal. Neagle made it two in the second half when he got {{on the end of a}} Sam pass and <b>touched</b> <b>it</b> beyond the keeper's reach. Pending the next day's Montreal Impact match, the win catapulted D.C. at least temporarily into 4th place in the Eastern Conference. The Toronto match was followed by a break for international games, and both Birnbaum and Hamid were called into the national team. Birnbaum made the trip to Cuba where he was a second-half substitute, but a kick to the face left him bloody and needing stitches.|$|E
500|$|Tarr {{earned his}} first England cap on 9 January 1909 against the touring Australians at Rectory Field, Blackheath. His {{opportunity}} {{came up with}} both Vassall and John Birkett injured. Also earning their first caps that day were Edgar Mobbs on the right wing and Alex Ashcroft, of Cambridge University, at fly-half. England took an early lead, when Tarr put Mobbs in for a try in the opening stages. That try {{has been described by}} his contemporary, rugby journalist and author E. H. D. Sewell, as being [...] "one of the very best ever scored, being perfect in execution from the moment Tarr first received the ball to the moment Mobbs <b>touched</b> <b>it</b> down for a try." [...] However, Australia took control of the game to win 9–3.|$|E

[...] Manoah then {{prepared}} a sacrifice, but the Angel of the Lord would only {{allow it to be}} for God. He <b>touched</b> <b>it</b> with his staff, miraculously engulfing it in flames, and then ascended into the sky in the fire — and, in doing so, revealed that he was not simply an angel but was God in angelic form. This was such dramatic evidence {{of the nature of the}} Messenger that Manoah feared for his life, since it was said that no one could live after seeing God. However, his wife convinced him that, if God planned to slay them, he would never have revealed such things to them. In due time, their son Samson was born, and he was raised according to the provisions.|$|E

500|$|Jennet Preston {{lived in}} Gisburn, {{which was then}} in Yorkshire, so she was sent to York Assizes for trial. Her judges were Sir James Altham and Sir Edward Bromley. Jennet was charged with the murder by {{witchcraft}} of a local landowner, Thomas Lister of Westby Hall, to which she pleaded not guilty. She had already appeared before Bromley in 1611, accused of murdering a child by witchcraft, but had been found not guilty. The most damning evidence given against her was that {{when she had been}} taken to see Lister's body, the corpse [...] "bled fresh bloud presently, in the presence of all that were there present" [...] after she <b>touched</b> <b>it.</b> According to a statement made to Nowell by James Device on 27 April, Jennet had attended the Malkin Tower meeting to seek help with Lister's murder. She was found guilty and sentenced to death by hanging; her execution took place on 29 July on the Knavesmire, the present site of York Racecourse.|$|E

500|$|Beyond Han's sculptures which embrace organic forms, she {{has also}} {{designed}} geometric pieces. Four Dimensions (1993) {{was made up of}} ten geometrical structures, including single objects (such as Tetrahedron–Tetrahedron Interpenetration) and opened-up planes (Cubic Triangle) connected with each other through the use of angles, and light and shadow. Han said: [...] "My works are based on the concept of mathematical logic. The idea is to show how each step is based on the previous one so that the geometrical forms progress in logical sequence ... The fourth dimension is abstract. It cannot be seen or <b>touched.</b> <b>It</b> contains the feelings and talents of Mankind. We wish to possess this space and to open it up for all people to share." [...] Sabapathy was somewhat critical of these works, saying that they dealt only with techniques and fabrication and did not [...] "disclose fresh insights into space and its articulation". He expressed the hope that Han would stay the course and deepen her investigation beyond form into an exploration of light, colour and materials to [...] "create environments in which form, space and time can be seen to be related in ever-changing yet intelligent systems".|$|E
