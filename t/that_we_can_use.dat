Our brains are, after all, biological objects, and the best naturalistic account of their development in nature is Darwin's theory of evolution. To the extent that mental architecture exhibits intricate processes and structures, it is plausible {{to think that this}} is the result of evolutionary processes working over vast periods of time. Like all biological systems, the mind is optimised to promote survival and reproduction in the evolutionary environment. On this view all specialised cognitive functions broadly serve those reproductive ends.|$|E

During Kyle and Georgia's joint bucks and hen night, Chris was forced to eject a drunk Josh Willis (Harley Bonner) from The Waterhole when he caused a scene. Shortly after, Josh {{returned}} and hit Chris with a coward punch, causing him to fall and hit his head on a rock. Kyle and Georgia found Chris unconscious and he was rushed to hospital in a critical condition. Mason was pleased to be given the storyline, explaining that it was a topical issue in Australia at the time. He said [...] "The whole moral of the story is that one little mistake can have really dire consequences. I like to think <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>use</b> this story to really educate people and get the word out there that this is something really serious that we're battling against at the moment." [...] Mason thought that Chris might be able to forgive Josh in the future, but it would be [...] "a long process", and he would {{have to deal with the}} fact that his life had changed forever due to the attack first. Mason added that Chris would have difficulties accepting that someone like Josh attacked him.|$|E

2500|$|While a universally {{accepted}} definition of sustainability remains elusive, the Brundtland Commission of the United Nations defined sustainable development as development {{that meets the}} needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.

These [...] "three pillars" [...] of sustainability encompass the responsible management of resource use.

She said that when: “you point out that you won an Amnesty Award for a similar story a couple of years ago. It makes editors think that they will get some sort of kudos from this, and that it matters within the industry. So I think it’s tremendously important and I think Amnesty is doing a tremendous job by giving us these awards so <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>use</b> them to say: ‘Yes, we’ve got to carry on reporting human rights, it really matters’." ...|$|E
