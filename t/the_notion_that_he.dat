5|$|During the {{communist}} era, {{the legacy of}} Kafka's work for Eastern bloc socialism was hotly debated. Opinions ranged from <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> satirised the bureaucratic bungling of a crumbling Austria-Hungarian Empire, {{to the belief that}} he embodied the rise of socialism. A further key point was Marx's theory of alienation. While the orthodox position was that Kafka's depictions of alienation were no longer relevant for a society that had supposedly eliminated alienation, a 1963 conference held in Liblice, Czechoslovakia, on the eightieth anniversary of his birth, reassessed the importance of Kafka's portrayal of bureaucracy. Whether or not Kafka was a political writer is still an issue of debate.|$|E
5|$|Hitsugaya {{lived with}} his {{grandmother}} and with Momo Hinamori, whom he considers a very close friend. Hitsugaya excelled in the Soul Reaper academy, becoming the youngest captain {{in the history of}} Soul Society with command over Squad 10. Introduced to the Gotei 13, Hitsugaya suspected Squad 3 captain Gin Ichimaru of foul play as the circumstances surrounding the coming execution of Rukia Kuchiki become more complicated. When Hinamori is manipulated into thinking that Hitsugaya killed Sōsuke Aizen, Hitsugaya attacks Gin on <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> tricked her. The fight is interrupted when Hitsugaya dodges an attack that almost kills Hinamori, only to be intercepted by his lieutenant Rangiku Matsumoto. Seeing how destructive Rukia's execution is becoming, Hitsugaya tries to stop it by appealing to the Chamber 46, only to discover all members were murdered by Aizen, who faked his death. When Hitsugaya discovers Hinamori injured, Hitsugaya tries to kill Aizen but is defeated.|$|E
5|$|While in {{town with}} the Mistress, Lad saves her from {{an attack by}} a sick dog being chased {{by the police and}} other citizens, who believe it to be rabid. The dog is shot and the upset Mistress, who knew it was not really rabid, goes home. The next day, the town constable comes by boat to the Place to execute Lad under <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is now rabid. The Master argues that the other dog was not rabid and refuses to allow Lad to be shot, {{ordering}} the officer off his property. As the man is leaving, his boat overturns. Unable to swim, he is in danger of drowning until Lad jumps in and brings him back to shore. The grateful officer states that he killed the dog he came to kill and Lad only looks a little like him.|$|E

He was {{generally regarded as}} a good fielder in his early years, even winning a Gold Glove Award in 1990 – {{the only one that}} New York Yankees legend Don Mattingly would not win between 1985 and 1994. In later years, his mobility decreased and, with it, his defense.|$|E

They believe his criticism was aimed only at the kind of writing that expresses dogmas and doctrines. Since the dialogues are not like this but instead present their material in the guise of fictional conversations, Plato's criticism does not apply.|$|E
25|$|In 1974, {{historian}} Gordon S. Wood {{presented the}} first complete argument against Lee's authorship.

Lee is not known ever to have written an extended piece for public consumption, and Wood concludes that the production of 181 pages of pamphlets in {{less than half a}} year was not his style.|$|E

25|$|Strom's first notable {{incident}} since {{returning to}} the league that received attention by the NBA front office was during the 1974–75 NBA season. Strom officiated a game in Seattle and inadvertently pushed a woman who approached him at the scorer's table {{at the conclusion of}} the game. Seattle SuperSonics guard Fred Brown pushed Strom into the crowd as retaliation for what he had done to the woman. Bill Russell, who was coaching the SuperSonics at the time and referee Hugh Evans separated Strom and Brown from a further altercation. Strom originally was going to be suspended six games by commissioner J. Walter Kennedy, but was changed to a $600 fine. Strom went to the referees union to appeal the fine based on <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was trying to defend himself. The union did not follow through with the appeal, but the fine was rescinded a year later by new commissioner Larry O'Brien and Strom was reimbursed his fine payment.|$|E
25|$|In the 2004 {{election}}, Bagapsh had {{run with}} Stanislav Lakoba as Vice Presidential candidate. The power-sharing deal between Bagapsh and Khajimba {{to end the}} post-election crisis meant that Lakoba could no longer become Vice President. Instead, after the new election on 12 January 2005, Lakoba was appointed Secretary of the Security Council on 17 February. When Khajimba resigned as Vice President on 28 May 2009 he declared that within the government he had received most support by Lakoba. On 18 August Lakoba himself handed his resignation over the Abkhazian citizenship crisis. In an interview with Caucasian Knot on 3 September Lakoba stated {{that he would not}} participate in the December 2009 presidential election and he called absurd <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would join the opposition. Nevertheless, {{in an interview with the}} newspaper Nuzhnaya on 17 November, Lakoba stated that as a private citizen he supported Khajimba's candidacy and he praised his work in the Security Council. On 4 December Lakoba had a statement read out on Abkhazian television in which he stressed that this was only his private opinion and that it should not be used by any of the election campaigns.|$|E

5000|$|In {{an essay}} written in 1996, Johnson {{wrote of the}} {{intelligent}} design movement that [...] "My colleagues and I speak of 'theistic realism' — or sometimes, 'mere creation' — as the defining concept of our movement. This means that we affirm that God is objectively real as Creator, and that the reality of God is tangibly recorded in evidence accessible to science, particularly in biology." [...] Johnson presents theistic realism as a philosophical justification for intelligent design in his 1998 book, Reason in the Balance. According to Johnson, true knowledge begins with the acknowledgment of God as creator of the universe, the unifying characteristic {{of which is that}} it was created by God. Theistic realism relies on a concept of God which involves <b>the</b> <b>notions</b> <b>that</b> <b>He</b> is real, personal, and acting in the world through mechanistic creationism.|$|R

40|$|In {{his series}} of lectures, Le pouvoir psychiatrique, Michel Foucault employs {{concepts}} {{from the military}} field of knowledge in order to analyse the founding scenes of psychiatry. I focus on three issues connected to Foucault’s use of these military terms. Firstly, I examine why Foucault was reluctant to use concepts from sociology and psychology in Le pouvoir psychiatrique and how this affects <b>the</b> <b>notions</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had formulated in his earlier work, Histoire de la folie. Secondly, I show how he challenges traditional understandings of the founding scenes of psychiatry by using concepts from a different field of knowledge. In doing this, he creates metaphors, {{and this is something}} <b>that</b> <b>he</b> himself had previously been critical of doing. Thirdly, I reflect upon the fact that Foucault’s creative use of concepts from different disciplines and examples from different historical times can be related to episodes in his own life; I argue why it is important to supplement a structural analysis with linguistic, phenomenological and hermeneutical one...|$|R

[...] Biden lacked a strong demographic or political group of support to help him survive the crisis.

He also cited <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was a poor defender due to the belief that he lacked speed, while D'Antoni stated that Lin [...] "was one of the quickest athletes we've ever worked out". Lin also opined that, being an Asian basketball player, his performance with the Knicks may have gained excessive publicity.

500|$|Kruger {{was never}} more popular {{domestically}} {{than during the}} 1897–98 election campaign, and indeed was widely perceived to be jollier {{than he had been}} in years. He won his most decisive election victory yet—12,853 votes to Joubert's 2,001 and Schalk Willem Burger's 3,753—and was sworn in as President for the fourth time on 12 May 1898. After a three-hour inauguration address, his longest speech as President, his first act of his fourth term was to sack Kotzé, who was still claiming the right to test legislation in the courts. To Kruger's critics this lent much credence to <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was a tyrant. [...] Milner called Kotzé's dismissal [...] "the end of real justice in the Transvaal" [...] and a step that [...] "threatened all British subjects and interests there".|$|E
50|$|In 2002, Stiles {{published}} Jesse James: Last Rebel of the Civil War (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 2002).

In the interview, Favre said he was [...] "guilty of retiring early", that he was [...] "never fully committed" [...] to retirement, and that he was pressured by the Packers to make a decision before the NFL Draft and the start of the free agent signing period. Favre disputed <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> does not want to play for Green Bay and said that while he understands the organization has decided to move on, they should now allow him to do the same. He made clear that he would not return to the Packers as a backup and reiterated his desire to be released rather than traded, which would allow him the freedom to play for a competitive team. Favre also accused the Packers of being dishonest, wishing the team would have been straightforward with him and the public.|$|E

As he proceeds through Dracula's castle, he learns that Dracula, the longtime antagonist of the Castlevania series, had been truly defeated, and that a prophecy had been made dictating that Dracula's powers would be passed down to his reincarnation. After defeating , who had harbored <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was Dracula's reincarnation, Soma realizes that he himself is Dracula's reincarnation.

The contentious election {{was marked by}} a sharp disagreement over the treatment of John Wheelwright, another Hutchinson supporter. [...] Winthrop won {{in part because the}} location of the vote was moved to Cambridge, reducing the power of Vane's Boston support. [...] In the aftermath of the election Anne Hutchinson was put on trial, and eventually banished from the colony. [...] Many of her followers seriously considered leaving after the election. [...] At the urging of Roger Williams, some of these people, including Hutchinson, founded the settlement of Portsmouth on Aquidneck Island in the Narragansett Bay (later named Rhode Island and joined to Providence to form the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations). [...] Vane decided to return to England, apparently with <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would acquire a royal governorship to trump the colonial administration. [...] Before his departure, he published A Brief Answer to a Certain Declaration, a response to Winthrop's defense of the Act of Exclusion; this act was passed after the election to restrict the immigration of people with views not conforming to the colony's religious orthodoxy.|$|E
