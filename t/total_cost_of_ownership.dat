40|$|In recent years, the Dutch {{government}} {{increased its}} {{demands on the}} housing industry with respect to energetic sustainability. Associated, some private developers acknowledge the necessity to raise this energetic sustainability above the legal standards, to meet demands of a specific group of housing customers. However, they are confronted with bottlenecks from the housing market that often prevent them from doing so. The most important bottleneck {{seems to be the}} assumption of developers and housing customers that sustainable building implies higher costs. Both stakeholders mainly focus on investment costs, and don’t pay attention to exploitation costs. It is expected that providing an unambiguous insight into eventual differences in <b>total</b> <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>ownership</b> between dwellings that meet minimum sustainability standards and dwellings with an increased level of sustainability will influence the attitude of both stakeholder groups towards the feasibility of sustainability. The objective {{of this article is to}} give this insight. A model is developed that (1) calculates these differences in <b>total</b> <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>ownership</b> and (2) supports project developers and housing consumers in choosing the right level of sustainability during the development of new dwellings. The model has been verified by applying it to a case study: Blixembosch, a residential area in Eindhoven, the Netherlands. The result shows that it is possible to develop an energy-neutral residential area which on average – in the long term – makes annual savings for housing consumers...|$|R

40|$|Vehicle {{automation}} and its uptake is {{an active}} area of research among transportation academics. Early adoption rate also influences the results in other areas, e. g. the potential impacts of vehicle automation.

40|$|This paper {{consists}} of four major sections: The first section is a literature review of cloud computing and a cost model. The next section focuses on detailed overviews of cloud computing and its levels of services: SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS. Major cloud computing providers are introduced, including Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google App Engine. Finally, case studies of implementing web applications on IaaS and PaaS using AWS, Linode and Google AppEngine are demonstrated. Justifications of running on an IaaS provider (AWS) and running on a PaaS provider (Google AppEngine) are described. The last section discusses costs and technology analysis comparing cloud computing with local managed storage and servers. The <b>total</b> <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>ownership</b> (TCO) <b>of</b> an AWS small instance are significantly lower, but the TCO of a typical 10 TB space in Amazon S 3 are significantly higher.
