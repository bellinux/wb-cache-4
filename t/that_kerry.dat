5|$|The Bush {{campaign}} advertised {{across the}} U.S. against Democratic candidates, including Bush's emerging opponent, Massachusetts Senator John Kerry. Kerry and other Democrats attacked Bush on the Iraq War, and {{accused him of}} failing {{to stimulate the economy}} and job growth. The Bush campaign portrayed Kerry as a staunch liberal who would raise taxes and increase the size of government. The Bush campaign continuously criticized Kerry's seemingly contradictory statements on the war in Iraq, and argued <b>that</b> <b>Kerry</b> lacked the decisiveness and vision necessary for success in the War on Terror.|$|E
5|$|In the 2004 U.S. presidential {{election}} campaign, McCain {{was once again}} frequently mentioned for the vice-presidential slot, only this time {{as part of the}} Democratic ticket under nominee John Kerry. McCain said <b>that</b> <b>Kerry</b> had never formally offered him the position and that he would not have accepted it if he had. At the 2004 Republican National Convention, McCain supported Bush for re-election, praising Bush's management of the War on Terror since the September 11 attacks. At the same time, he defended Kerry's Vietnam War record. By August 2004, McCain had the best favorable-to-unfavorable rating (55percent to 19percent) of any national politician; he campaigned for Bush much more than he had four years previously, though the two remained situational allies rather than friends.|$|E

25|$|There are {{conflicting}} {{accounts of}} the jersey <b>that</b> <b>Kerry</b> wore {{in the first of}} the three games of the 1903 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final series with Kildare, but both accounts agree that the predominant colour was red. One account says that it was a red jersey with green neck and cuffs, which were the colours of the Tralee Mitchels junior football team. Another account says that it was an entirely red jersey with no green in it. The reason <b>that</b> <b>Kerry</b> wore this red or mainly red jersey was that a new set of green and gold jerseys was not delivered in time for the game. For the later games in the 1903 series of games, Kerry wore green jerseys with gold on the cuffs and over the shoulders. These were the colours of the Tralee Mitchels senior team.|$|E
25|$|Kerry {{have been}} the most {{successful}} team in the All-Ireland Senior Football Championship, topping the list of counties for All-Irelands won. They have won the competition on 37 occasions, including two four-in-a-rows (1929–1932, 1978–1981) and two three-in-a-rows (1939–1941, 1984–1986). The Ó Sé family are particularly renowned: beginning with Páidí, they have had at least one member play a part in all 22 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Finals <b>that</b> <b>Kerry</b> have participated in between 1975 and 2014.|$|E
25|$|In late 1995, Ó Sé {{returned}} to the limelight when he was appointed manager of the Kerry senior football team. The task ahead was enormous as Kerry had fallen down the pecking order in terms of championship aspirations. The county hadn't won an All-Ireland title since Ó Sé was a player almost a decade earlier in 1986. Kerry's last Munster title came in 1991; however, since then near rivals Cork had dominated the provincial series. In Ó Sé's first Munster campaign in 1996 Kerry reached the final. Cork, a team looking for an eighth title in ten years, provided the opposition, however, Ó Sé's touch worked the oracle as the Kingdom won by 0-14 to 0-11. It was a sign <b>that</b> <b>Kerry</b> {{were on the way}} back; however, a defeat by Mayo in the subsequent All-Ireland semi-final highlighted the fact that the team was lacking in some quarters.|$|E

50|$|Kerry's opponents, {{including}} the SBVT, have contended that this wound was too minor to merit a Purple Heart. However, guidelines for a Purple Heart do {{not distinguish between}} degrees of injury; in addition, a 2004 review by the Navy inspector general concluded <b>that</b> <b>Kerry's</b> awards, including his first Purple Heart, were properly approved.|$|R

25|$|What {{is now the}} No. 33 car {{started as}} the No. 90 car in 2003. RCR entered the No. 90 Chevrolet in the fall Talladega race with John Andretti driving. The car was {{sponsored}} by AOL 9.0 and was numbered 90 for marketing purposes. Ron Hornaday, Jr. ran the No. 90 in the season-ending Ford 400 with Childress Vineyards on the hood. In 2004, it was announced <b>that</b> <b>Kerry</b> Earnhardt would drive the car (renumbered to 33) in five NASCAR Nextel Cup races. Mike Skinner would run {{the car in the}} Daytona 500, finishing 22nd. Earnhardt drove the car in the other three restrictor plate races with Bass Pro Shops sponsoring, getting his best finish of 24th. He attempted all of the restrictor plate races again in 2005, finishing 17th at Talladega. In addition, road course ringer Brian Simo brought home a 10th-place finish at Infineon Raceway. Clint Bowyer (Childress' Busch Series driver) made his Nextel Cup debut in this car with a Sylvania sponsorship at Phoenix in April 2005. Scott Wimmer ran the season finale in 2005, attempted two races in 2006 (making one start), and only made one start out of seven attempts in 2007. On May 2, 2008, Wimmer attempted but failed to qualify for the 2008 Crown Royal presents the Dan Lowry 400 at Richmond. Wimmer had sponsorships from Holiday Inn and Camping World/RVs.com. Ken Schrader and Mike Wallace ran one race apice in 2008.|$|E
500|$|After the Games, Kerry {{retired from}} {{competitive}} swimming. He then worked in Los Angeles {{as a model}} and hosted a fashion show on cable television. According to Tonelli, Kerry's mother told her son to [...] "look after that face, [...] that's all you've got". Tonelli disagreed, opining that [...] "he was always much more than that". Tonelli reported <b>that</b> <b>Kerry</b> was busy preening himself just {{before the start of}} their Olympic-winning relay performance, claiming that although Australia was unlikely to win the race, he needed to look good because a prospective employer might be watching. Kerry went on to model on the catwalks of Milan and Paris.|$|E
2500|$|Michael Meehan, a {{spokesman}} for the Kerry campaign, responded to SBVT's charges with a statement <b>that</b> <b>Kerry</b> was referring to a period when Nixon had been president-elect and before he was inaugurated. Meehan went on to state <b>that</b> <b>Kerry</b> had been [...] "deep in enemy waters" [...] between Vietnam and Cambodia and that his boat came under fire at the Cambodian border. Meehan also said <b>that</b> <b>Kerry</b> did covertly cross over into Cambodia to drop off special operations forces on a later occasion, but that there was no paperwork for such missions and he could not supply dates.|$|E
5000|$|President Barack Obama's Secretary of State John Kerry {{told the}} Organization of American States in November 2013 that [...] "era of the Monroe Doctrine is over."

50|$|The {{day after}} the remarks were made public, leaders {{from both sides of}} the {{political}} spectrum criticized Kerry's remarks, which he said were a botched joke. Republicans including President George W.

Democratic Representative Harold Ford, Jr. called on Kerry to apologize.|$|R

2500|$|In his keynote {{convention}} speech, {{delivered on}} September 1, 2004, Miller criticized {{the current state}} of the Democratic Party.

2500|$|Kerry's {{campaign}} advisor Bob Shrum later {{reported in}} Time magazine <b>that</b> <b>Kerry</b> said {{he wished he}} had never picked Edwards, and the two have since stopped speaking to each other.

2500|$|Furthermore, Kerry's base commander, Adrian Lonsdale, {{stated that}} {{according}} to the precedence he had set out in his operations order, Kerry would be the [...] "only logical candidate" [...] to write the report based on his length of service in Vietnam.

50|$|More recently, {{during the}} 2004 United States presidential campaign, some critics of Kerry have focused current media {{attention}} on {{his participation in}} those Senate hearings and have alleged that parts of his testimony that day portrayed American war veterans of that era in an unduly harsh light.

2500|$|SBVT member Grant Hibbard, who was Kerry's {{commander}} at the time, {{has claimed}} <b>that</b> <b>Kerry</b> {{came to him}} {{the morning after the}} incident, after he had been to sick bay, stating that he was eligible for a Purple Heart.

2500|$|The story {{prompted}} Elliott {{to release}} a second affidavit, in August 2004, in which he stated, [...] "Had I known the facts, I would not have recommended Kerry for the Silver Star for simply pursuing and dispatching a single wounded, fleeing Viet Cong." [...] The second affidavit made what Elliott called an [...] "immaterial clarification", in that {{he admitted that he}} had no personal knowledge of the circumstances of the shooting. Rather, his initial statement <b>that</b> <b>Kerry</b> had been dishonest was based on unspecified sources and a passage contributed by Kranish to a biography of Kerry.|$|E
2500|$|Many pundits {{noted that}} while Edwards's charismatic style was in evidence, he had rushed through the speech, ending several minutes earlier than planned. The delegates in the FleetCenter, however, were enraptured, and Edwards led them {{several times in}} a statement-{{response}} chant: [...] "Hope is on the way." [...] This, and the general upbeat tone of the address, {{was a response to}} attacks by the Bush campaign claiming <b>that</b> <b>Kerry</b> and Edwards were pessimistic and cynical; it was altered and echoed the next day in the more detailed speech of John Kerry: [...] "Help is on the way." ...|$|E
