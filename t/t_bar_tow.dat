40|$|We {{present a}} new {{measurement}} of the inclusive forward-backward <b>t</b> (<b>t)</b> over <b>bar</b> production asymmetry and its rapidity and mass dependence. The measurements are performed with data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 5. 3 fb(- 1) of p (p) over bar collisions at root s = 1. 96 TeV, recorded with the CDF-II Detector at the Fermilab Tevatron. Significant inclusive asymmetries are observed in both the laboratory frame and the <b>t</b> (<b>t)</b> over <b>bar</b> rest frame, and in both cases {{are found to be}} consistent with CP conservation under interchange of t and (<b>t)</b> over <b>bar.</b> In the <b>t</b> (<b>t)</b> over <b>bar</b> rest frame, the asymmetry is observed to increase with the <b>t</b> (<b>t)</b> over <b>bar</b> rapidity difference, Delta y, and with the invariant mass M(t (<b>t)</b> over <b>bar)</b> of the <b>t</b> (<b>t)</b> over <b>bar</b> system. Fully corrected parton-level asymmetries are derived in two regions of each variable, and the asymmetry is found to be most significant at large Delta y and M(t (<b>t)</b> over <b>bar).</b> For M(t (<b>t)</b> over <b>bar)</b> >= 450 GeV/c(2), the parton-level asymmetry in the <b>t</b> (<b>t)</b> over <b>bar</b> rest frame is A(t (<b>t)</b> over <b>bar)</b> = 0. 475 +/- 0. 114 compared to a next-to-leading order QCD prediction of 0. 088 +/- 0. 013...|$|R

40|$|The {{experimental}} {{results on the}} <b>t</b> <b>bar</b> <b>t</b> production cross section at the Tevatron are well described by the QCD contributions within the standard model, while the recent measurement of the forward-backward asymmetry cannot be accounted for within this framework. We consider light colored scalars appearing in a particular SU(5) GUT model within the 45 -dimensional Higgs representation. A virtue of the model is that it connects {{the presence of a}} light colored SU(2) singlet (Delta_ 6) and a color octet weak doublet (Delta_ 1) with bounds on the proton lifetime, which constrain the parameter space of both scalars. We find that both the <b>t</b> <b>bar</b> <b>t</b> production cross section and the forward-backward asymmetry can be accommodated simultaneously within this model. The {{experimental results}} prefer a region for the mass of Delta_ 6 around 400 GeV, while Delta_ 1 is then constrained to have a mass around the TeV scale as well. We analyze possible experimental signatures and find that Delta_ 6 associated top production could be probed in the <b>t</b> <b>bar</b> <b>t</b> + jets final states at Tevatron and the LHC.

40|$|We {{update the}} {{measurement}} of the <b>t</b> (<b>t)</b> over <b>bar</b> production cross section using the CDF detector at the Fermilab Tevatron. This measurement uses <b>t</b> (<b>t)</b> over <b>bar</b> decays to the final states e + nu + jets and mu + nu + jets. We search for b quarks from t decays via secondary-vertex identification or the identification of semileptonic decays of the b and cascade c quarks. The background to the <b>t</b> (<b>t)</b> over <b>bar</b> production is determined primarily through a Monte Carlo simulation. However, we calibrate the simulation and evaluate its uncertainty using several independent data samples.
