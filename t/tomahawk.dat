50|$|Pre-contact Native Americans lacked {{ironmaking}} technology, so <b>tomahawks</b> {{were not}} fitted with metal axe heads {{until they could}} be obtained from trade with Europeans. The <b>tomahawk's</b> original designs were fitted with heads of bladed or rounded stone or deer antler.|$|R
5000|$|The Toronto <b>Tomahawks</b> were {{a team in}} the {{original}} National Lacrosse League. The <b>Tomahawks</b> played their home games at Maple Leaf Gardens during the league's first season in 1974 and compiled a 17-23 record. This placed them fifth out of six teams in the NLL {{and out of the}} playoffs. Following the completion of the season, the <b>Tomahawks</b> were sold and received league approval to move the team to Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum in Long Island, New York. [...] However, ultimately it was decided to relocate the team to Boston to become the Boston Bolts {{for the start of the}} 1975 NLL season, with the Rochester Griffins becoming the Long Island <b>Tomahawks.</b>|$|R
5|$|Owing to the {{original}} 1938 design of the battleships, the <b>Tomahawk</b> missiles could not be fitted to the Iowa-class unless the battleships were physically rebuilt {{in such a way}} as to accommodate the missile mounts that would be needed to store and launch the Tomahawks. This realization prompted the removal of the anti-aircraft guns previously installed on the Iowas and the removal of four of each of the battleships' ten 5"/38DP mounts. The mid and aft end of the battleships were then rebuilt to accommodate the missile magazines. This resulted in the construction of two separate platforms, one located between the first and second funnel and one located behind the second funnel, to which MK-143 Armored Box Launcher (ABL) canisters could be attached. Each Armored Box Launcher carried four missiles, and each of the battleships was outfitted with eight canisters, enabling the Iowa-class to carry and fire a total of 32 <b>Tomahawk</b> missiles.|$|E
5|$|Recorded {{after an}} unreceptive tour {{with the band}} Tool, Mit Gas has been {{described}} by critics as a more focused and unified album than its predecessor, <b>Tomahawk.</b> The album was supported by a tour alongside Melvins, Skeleton Key and Dälek. Mit Gas has garnered positive reviews, drawing comparisons to the works of Frank Zappa, Pink Floyd and Led Zeppelin.|$|E
5|$|According to a 1992 article, the Iroquois, {{wielding}} weapons {{such as the}} <b>tomahawk,</b> killed 24 French {{and took}} more than 70 prisoners. Other sources, such as Encyclopædia Britannica, claim that 250 settlers and soldiers lost their lives during the “Massacre.” The Iroquois wanted to avenge the 1,200,000 bushels of corn burned by the French, but since {{they were unable to}} reach the food stores in Montreal, they kidnapped and killed the Lachine crop producers instead. Lachine was the main departure point for westward-traveling fur traders, a fact which may have provided extra motivation for the Mohawk attack.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{two sides}} were about even in number, Brant had won a {{lopsided}} victory. All of the Americans were killed or captured; none of Brant's men were injured. According to a detailed list prepared by Brant and sent to Detroit, 37 Americans were killed and 64 were captured. Some of the American dead—some sources say most—had been executed after surrendering. This included Lochry, who {{was sitting on a}} log after the battle when a Shawnee warrior killed him with a <b>tomahawk</b> blow to the head. According to some accounts, Brant prevented the Indians from killing even more of the prisoners. The dead were scalped and left unburied.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{decision}} to disband the Ranger units, the 2nd Ranger Company was deactivated on 1 August 1951 while it was still in Korea. Like many of the other Ranger units, most of the 2nd Ranger Company veterans were folded into the 187th RCT. As an airborne unit, it was believed that by sending the men to the 187th, their airborne skills could be used. Nevertheless, in the end it turned out that Operation <b>Tomahawk</b> was the last airborne jump of the war and as a result, the former Rangers did not get a chance to exercise these skills again.|$|E

5|$|In 1994, the Nuclear Posture Review study {{determined}} that, of the 18 Ohio SSBNs the U.S. Navy {{would be}} operating in total, 14 {{would be sufficient}} for the strategic needs of the U.S. The {{decision was made to}} convert four Ohio-class boats into SSGNs capable of conducting conventional land attack and special operations. As a result, the four oldest boats of the class—Ohio, Michigan, Florida, and Georgia—progressively entered the conversion process in late 2002 and were returned to active service by 2008. The boats could thereafter carry 154 <b>Tomahawk</b> cruise missiles and 66 special operations personnel, among other capabilities and upgrades. The cost to refit the four boats was around US$1billion (2008 dollars) per vessel.|$|E
5|$|New Jerseys {{modernization}} {{was unique}} in that {{she was to be}} the only reactivated Iowa-class battleship to lose a gun turret. At the time the Navy made the announcement plans were underway to remove New Jerseys No. 3 16in gun turret (located aft of the superstructure). In its place the Navy planned to install one of two systems: a vertical launching missile magazine which would have enabled New Jersey to carry an additional 48 <b>Tomahawk</b> or Harpoon missiles, or using the space generated by a removed gun turret for aircraft related updates centering on VTOL or V/STOL type aircraft; however these ideas were ultimately dropped, and New Jersey retained her No. 3 Gun Turret during her 1980s career.|$|E
5|$|On 10 July, the U.S. Army {{ordered the}} {{deactivation}} {{of all of}} its Ranger companies.

Like {{many of the other}} Ranger units, most of the Ranger veterans were folded into the 187th Airborne Regimental Combat Team, where their airborne skills could be used. Still, Operation <b>Tomahawk</b> was the last airborne jump of the war.|$|E

5|$|On 2 August 1990, Iraq invaded Kuwait. In {{the middle}} of the month, President George H. W. Bush, in keeping with the Carter Doctrine, sent the first of several hundred {{thousand}} troops, along with a strong force of naval support to Saudi Arabia and the Persian Gulf area to support a multi-national force in a standoff with Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein. On 7 August, Wisconsin and her battle group were ordered to deploy in defense of Kuwait for Operation Desert Shield, and they arrived in the Persian Gulf on 23 August. On 15 January 1991, Operation Desert Storm commenced operations, and Wisconsin found herself serving alongside her younger sister Missouri, just as she had done in Korea forty years previously. Both Wisconsin and Missouri launched <b>Tomahawk</b> Missile attacks against Iraq; they were among the first ships to fire cruise missiles during the 1991 Gulf War. Wisconsin served as the <b>Tomahawk</b> Land Attack Missile (TLAM) strike commander for the Persian Gulf, directing the sequence of launches that marked the opening of Operation Desert Storm and firing a total of 24 of her own TLAMs during the first two days of the campaign. Wisconsin also assumed the responsibility of the local anti-surface warfare coordinator for the Northern Persian Gulf Surface Action Group.|$|E
5|$|The 5-inch/38 gun {{would remain}} on the battleships for the ships' entire service life; however, {{the total number of}} guns and gun mounts was reduced from 20 guns in ten mounts to 12 guns in six mounts during the 1980s' {{modernization}} of the four Iowas. The removal of four of the gun mounts was required for the battleships to be outfitted with the armored box launchers needed to carry and fire <b>Tomahawk</b> missiles. At the time of the 1991 Persian Gulf War, these guns had been largely relegated to littoral defense for the battleships. Since each battleship carried a small detachment of Marines aboard, the Marines would man one of the 5-inch gun mounts.|$|E
5|$|To further complicate this controversy, {{many feel}} that there are varying levels of offensiveness with team names and mascots. The nature and degree of {{stereotyping}} varies depending upon {{the name of the}} team, the logo, the mascot, and the behavior of fans. The greatest offense is taken when the logo and mascot are caricatures viewed as insulting, such as the Cleveland Indians' Chief Wahoo; the name of the team is often regarded as a racial slur, such as Redskins or Squaws; or the behavior of the mascot or fans is based upon popular images of Indians which trivialize authentic native cultures; such as the <b>tomahawk</b> chop.|$|E
