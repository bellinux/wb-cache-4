5|$|The Railways Act 1921 brought most of {{the large}} coal-exporting docks in South Wales into the GWR's ownership, such as those at Cardiff, Barry, and Swansea.

However, a 2008 study stated that increased international interest and demand for the Finnhorse was advisable to ensure {{the survival of the}} breed. To this end, the objectives of the national breeding program, as of 2008, include increasing international recognition of the Finnhorse and generating demand for the breed for recreational and educational uses such as in Pony Club; <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>the</b> standard breed used in Finland for equestrian tourism; and to improve the opportunities for Finnhorse trotters to participate in Swedish and Norwegian heats.|$|E

5|$|In the 1950–51 NBA season, Mikan was {{dominant}} again, {{scoring a}} career-best 28.4 {{points per game}} in the regular season, again taking the scoring crown, and had 3.1 assists per game. In that year, the NBA introduced a new statistic: rebounds. In this category, Mikan also stood out; his 14.1 rebounds per game (rpg) was only second to the 16.4 rpg of Dolph Schayes of Syracuse. In that year, Mikan participated {{in one of the}} most notorious NBA games ever played. When the Fort Wayne Pistons played against his Lakers, the Pistons took a 19–18 lead. Afraid that Mikan would mount a comeback if he got the ball, the Pistons passed the ball around without any attempt to score a basket. With no shot clock invented yet to force them into offense, the score stayed 19–18 <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>the</b> lowest-scoring NBA game of all time. This game was an important factor in the development of the shot clock, which was introduced four years later. Mikan had scored 15 of the Lakers' 18 points, thus scoring 83.3% of his team's points, setting an NBA all-time record. In the post season, Mikan fractured his leg before the 1951 Western Division Finals against the Rochester Royals. With Mikan hardly able to move all series long, the Royals won 3–1. Decades later, in 1990, Mikan recalled that his leg was taped with a plate; however, despite effectively hopping around the court on one foot, he said he still averaged 20-odd points per game.|$|E
5|$|The first Fire Emblem title, Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light, was {{originally}} never {{intended as a}} commercial game, defined by creator Shouzou Kaga as a dōjin project with three other job-holding students. As it turned out, the game was successful, prompting {{the development of more}} games in the series. The game was developed at Intelligent Systems, whose previous notable game was the strategy game Famicom Wars. Kaga would work on the Fire Emblem series until Thracia 776, when he left Nintendo and began development on Tear Ring Saga for the PlayStation. After Thracia 776, the Fire Emblem series had several releases on portable devices. At this time, Marth and Roy from Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light and Sword of Seals appeared as playable characters in Super Smash Bros. Melee, prompting western interest in the Fire Emblem series. The positive reception of the characters made Nintendo decide to localize Blazing Sword under the title Fire Emblem. Due to its overseas success, it was decided to return the series to home consoles for Path of Radiance for the GameCube. Despite it arriving late in the GameCube's life cycle, it provided a late boost to sales, reaffirming Nintendo's faith in the series. By 2010, the series was suffering from declining sales and Nintendo told Intelligent Systems that if their next Fire Emblem failed to sell above 250,000 units, the series would be cancelled. This prompted Intelligent Systems to include lots of features new to the series, intending <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>the</b> culmination of the series. The game's reception and sales ended up saving the series from cancellation, convincing Nintendo to continue production.|$|E

25|$|The club {{issued an}} {{international}} tender to remodel the stadium as {{a celebration of}} the stadium's fiftieth anniversary. The objective was to make the facility an integrated and highly visible urban environment. The club sought to increase the seating capacity by 13,500, with {{at least half of the}} total seating to be under cover. The intention was <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>the</b> third-largest stadium in the world (in terms of seating capacity), after the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in the USA (297,000 capacity), and the Rungnado May Day Stadium in North Korea (150,000 capacity).|$|E
25|$|While its storage {{capacity}} {{is too low}} <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>the</b> sole mechanism for storage, nonsynaptic plasticity could contribute to synaptic storage methods. It {{has been shown that}} the modulation of ion channels can occur in regions as small as specific dendrites. This specificity makes the {{storage capacity}} of nonsynaptic plasticity larger than if it were taken to be whole neuron modulation. Procedural memories are a good fit for this type of storage system because they do not require the high specificity that declarative memories do. Generalization of motor tasks and conditioned stimuli could be an efficient way to store this information.|$|E

25|$|In 1528 {{the bishop}} lost secular power over both Neder- and Oversticht – which {{included}} the city of Utrecht – to Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor. Charles V combined the Seventeen Provinces (the current Benelux and the northern parts of France) as a personal union. This ended the prince-bishopric of Utrecht, as the secular rule was now the lordship of Utrecht, with the religious power remaining with the bishop, although Charles V had gained the right to appoint new bishops. In 1559 the bishopric of Utrecht was raised to archbishopric <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>the</b> religious centre of the Northern ecclesiastical province in the Seventeen Provinces.|$|E
25|$|In August 2005, a {{group of}} {{business}} investors that included Jameson purchased Babes Cabaret, a strip club in Scottsdale, Arizona, intending <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>the</b> first foray of ClubJenna into live entertainment. Soon after the purchase attracted attention, the Scottsdale City Council proposed a new ordinance banning nudity at adult-entertainment venues and requiring a four-foot divider restricting contact with dancers. Such a divider would have also effectively banned lap dances, the dancers' main source of revenue. Jameson argued strongly against the ordinance, and helped organize a petition against it. On September 12, 2006, in {{a referendum on the}} ordinance, voters struck down the stricter rules, allowing the club to continue to operate as before.|$|E
25|$|The new diocese {{comprised}} {{the counties of}} Hampshire, the Isle of Wight, Berkshire, and the Channel Islands. It was thus almost co-terminous with {{the limits of the}} Diocese of Winchester. The obvious place for the cathedral and curia of the new diocese was Winchester. The Ecclesiastical Titles Act forbade a Catholic diocese to have the same name as an Anglican see. It would appear that the original intention was to fix the see at Southampton, with St Joseph Church in Bugle Street as the pro-cathedral. The construction of a large parish church in the centre of Portsmouth had begun, and it was decided <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>the</b> future cathedral of the diocese.|$|E
