5|$|Another {{controversy}} {{arose from}} the film when the Illinois Fighting Illini men's basketball teams of the late 1980s with Kendall Gill and Stephen Bardo {{claimed to be the}} originators of baggy shorts in basketball. All of the Wolverines {{who took part in the}} production of the film described how <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> <b>they</b> originated the baggy shorts as a result of Rose's request. Even rapper Ice Cube described his recollection of them as the originators.|$|E
5|$|Protesters were {{described}} by reporters as more confident and even celebratory as <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> <b>they</b> were nearing their objective—the end of Mubarak's regime—although {{they had no}} tangible evidence of this. An eyewitness told Al Jazeera that {{people of all ages}} and both genders were present. Demonstrators violated the curfew and no one attempted to stop them. Looting was also reported, while no police were visible.|$|E
5|$|As the day wore on, {{conditions}} {{appeared more}} and more favorable for thunderstorms, and {{more and more}} similar to the events of March 20. Weather radar images showed a severe squall line had formed to the west, and weather stations to the west reported cumulonimbus clouds and thunderstorms. In an afternoon meeting, under some pressure from their commanding officer, base meteorologists composed and issued the first official tornado forecast. Although they were aware of the small chance of success, <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> <b>they</b> had no choice, since the conditions were so similar to March 20. Equipment which could be was moved to bomb-proof shelters, and base personnel were moved to safer areas.|$|E

5|$|In 1915, a new Mint director, Robert W. Woolley, took office. Woolley {{advocated}} {{the replacement of}} the silver coins when it was legal to do so, and instructed Barber and Morgan to prepare new designs. He consulted with the Commission of Fine Arts, asking them to examine the designs produced by the Mint's engravers and, if <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> <b>they</b> were not suitable, to recommend artists to design the new coins. The Commission rejected the Barber and Morgan designs and proposed Adolph Weinman, Hermon MacNeil, and Albin Polasek as designers. Although Woolley had hoped that each artist would produce one design, different concepts by Weinman were accepted for the dime and half dollar, and one by MacNeil for the quarter.|$|E
5|$|Stephen's {{first few}} years as king can be {{interpreted}} in different ways. From a positive perspective, he stabilised the northern border with Scotland, contained Geoffrey's attacks on Normandy, was at peace with Louis VI, enjoyed {{good relations with the}} church and had the broad support of his barons. There were significant underlying problems, nonetheless. The north of England was now controlled by David and Prince Henry, Stephen had abandoned Wales, the fighting in Normandy had considerably destabilised the duchy, and an increasing number of barons felt that Stephen had given them neither the lands nor the titles <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> <b>they</b> deserved or were owed. Stephen was also rapidly running out of money: Henry's considerable treasury had been emptied by 1138 due to the costs of running Stephen's more lavish court and the need to raise and maintain his mercenary armies fighting in England and Normandy.|$|E
5|$|The {{problems}} with seating the second RSU set the spacewalkers {{back in the}} timeline by approximately two hours, but after Altman asked Massimino and Good how <b>they</b> <b>felt,</b> <b>they</b> replied they were doing well and felt fine to continue. Flight controllers on the ground evaluated the consumables for the two spacesuits, and decided that if Massimino recharged his suit's oxygen in the airlock, the pair could safely continue with the battery installation. After moving to the battery unit site, Good and Massimino removed {{one of the original}} battery modules from Bay 2 of the telescope, and replaced it with a new unit. The batteries provide power to the telescope when it passes into the Earth's shadow and its solar arrays are not exposed to the sun. The spacewalk officially ended at 20:45 UTC, for a time of seven hours, fifty-six minutes. It was the twentieth spacewalk to service Hubble, bringing the total time in EVA servicing the telescope to one hundred forty-four hours and twenty-six minutes.|$|E

30|$|In only 9 of 151 reports did {{students}} report {{difficulties in}} coordinating meetings. When students reported difficulty, {{it was generally}} because <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>they</b> were busy and struggled to fit meeting in their schedules.|$|R

5|$|There was {{rivalry between}} the lords of the manor and borough. The {{lord of the}} manor complained in 1328 that the burgesses were holding private markets, from which he gained no revenue. The rivalry {{continued}} in the 16th century, with Bishop Stanley unsuccessfully challenging {{the right of the}} burgesses to hold markets, believing it should be the right of the lord of the manor. In 1583 the corporation of the borough attempted to usurp the lord of the manor by laying claim to the lordship. They did so because <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> <b>they</b> were fulfilling the duties of the lord: to improve waste and common land and allowing construction on this land, running courts, and mining coal. A compromise was reached, dividing some power between the two parties.|$|E
5|$|Carr also theorizes {{that the}} {{capacity}} to contemplate may diminish as computer algorithms unburden an Internet user's brain {{of much of the}} painstaking knowledge work — the manipulation of abstract information and knowledge — that was previously done manually. In comparing the Internet with Frederick Winslow Taylor's management system for industrial efficiency, Carr makes the point that back then some workers complained that <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> <b>they</b> were becoming mere automatons due to the systemic application of Taylorism — a theory of management that analyzes and synthesizes workflow processes, improving labor productivity. Carr selects Google as a prime example of a company in which computer engineers and software designers have applied Taylorism to the knowledge industry, delivering increasingly robust information that may have the effect of minimizing opportunities to ponder ambiguities. Additionally, he argues that the Internet's dominant business model is one that thrives as companies either collect information on users or deliver them advertisements, therefore companies capitalize on users who move from link to link rather than those who engage in sustained thought.|$|E
25|$|Many of {{the rebel}} {{forces on the}} ground first heard of the Truce when it was {{announced}} in the newspapers and this gave rise to the first fissures in nationalist unity, which had serious consequences later on. <b>They</b> <b>felt</b> <b>they</b> had not been included in consultations regarding its terms.|$|E
5000|$|Almost all French Canadians opposed conscription; <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>they</b> had no {{particular}} loyalty to either Britain or France. Led by Henri Bourassa, <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> their only loyalty was to Canada. English Canadians generally supported {{the war effort}} as <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> stronger ties to the British Empire. [...] The Conscription Crisis of 1917 caused a considerable rift along ethnic lines between Anglophones and Francophones.|$|R
50|$|At {{the end of}} the match, Saint-Étienne's {{players were}} crying, because <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>they</b> had been unlucky, but their {{supporters}} were congratulating them, and their return in France was heroic, even though they were defeated.|$|R

25|$|Like Patrick Racing the day before, Team Green {{cancelled}} {{their second}} scheduled day of testing when <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> <b>they</b> had accomplished their testing goals after only one session.

25|$|Divers {{scoured the}} cave, looking in every small crevice and fissure where Ben might have crawled in a panicked {{attempt to get}} out as his tanks ran low, a pattern found in other cave diving deaths; many said later that <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> <b>they</b> had risked their own lives to do so.

50|$|The {{dogmatism}} of the Puritan divines, {{with their}} anti-rationalist demands, was, <b>they</b> <b>felt,</b> incorrect. <b>They</b> also <b>felt</b> that the Calvinist insistence on individual revelation left God uninvolved {{with the majority}} of mankind. At the same time, they were reacting against the reductive materialist writings of Thomas Hobbes. <b>They</b> <b>felt</b> that the latter, while rationalist, were denying the idealistic part of the universe.|$|R

25|$|On 20 June 2011, Leeds {{announced}} they had accepted an undisclosed bid for him from Leicester City.

Leeds claimed that <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> <b>they</b> wanted to strengthen the goalkeeping position to replace Schmeichel due to the poor goals against ratio.|$|E
25|$|In June 1998 Duar {{town was}} attacked. The Médecins Sans Frontières {{compound}} was burned and destroyed, {{as were the}} school and the community offices. Paulino's forces raided cattle camps, killing the animals for food. Many of the population fled, some to islands in the Nile where <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> <b>they</b> would be safe. Paulino's forces raided the area around Koch three times in 1998, destroying chapels, clinics, schools and government buildings. Again, those who could escape did so.|$|E
25|$|In 2004 Russell T Davies {{offered to}} let the {{magazine}} write and publish the official regeneration scene from the Eighth to the Ninth Doctor {{as part of its}} ongoing comic strip prior to the relaunch of the TV series.

25|$|Many ladies {{teams in}} Ontario {{did not want}} to join the LOHA because <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> <b>they</b> had no chance of winning. The Rivulettes success caused the number of member teams to decrease. The {{decision}} was for the LOHA to create an A League and a B League. The B League would include first year teams, and teams that were not at a high skill level. LOHA president Bobbie Rosenfeld found it to {{be the only way to}} increase the number of member teams.|$|E
25|$|The {{first serious}} {{concerns}} about driver safety occurred on Friday afternoon.

The identities of the two drivers were not disclosed, but Tony Kanaan and Alex Zanardi later claimed they experienced the symptoms. Adrian Fernandez also reported to the media he was experiencing dizziness. Olvey said in his 25 years of working in motorsports, {{it was a problem}} he had never experienced.|$|E
25|$|By 2:00pm on May 15, the {{province}} had declared the fire situation around Slave Lake to be a level three emergency, {{and announced that}} states of emergency existed in both the town, and the surrounding Municipal District of Lesser Slave River No. 124. The local radio station, Lake-FM, provided continuous updates to the community as the fires approached town. Officials remained hopeful that Slave Lake would be spared; by mid-afternoon, <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> <b>they</b> were gaining control of the fires.

5000|$|Throughout the {{entirety}} of The Spirit Moves, Dehn let her footage of the extraordinary dancing speak for itself. Her brief introductions {{at the beginning of}} each chapter do not touch upon any sociocultural analysis or other personal feelings. However, in the biographical short film In a Jazz Way, filmed shortly before her death, Dehn revealed that she was always keenly aware of the dominant feelings in African-American society and their manifestations in dance.The Savoy dances, the main thing of the dance of that time, of the 30's, was hope. <b>They</b> <b>felt</b> triumphant, <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> recognized. <b>They</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>they</b> could, through dance, through music, earn a position of equality ... Bebop was just the opposite. They found throughout during their work experience that nothing was going to be given to them, that they weren't going to be treated in the same way. Bebop is them turning their back on white influence, breaking up couple dancing, breaking up all the movements. It represented the broken up, disoriented, lost world in which they could only rely upon themselves.Later, when questioned about the then-recent development of breaking (which she also documented), Dehn expressed her view that the style and its wild, athletic movements are a response to the pain and discomfort of growing up in the modern world.|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} study, {{symptoms}} of nonclinical depression among 106 cancer {{patients and their}} intimate partners were assessed. From the perspective of equity theory, it was examined how depression was related to neuroticism marital quality, and perceptions of inequity in the relationship. LISREL analyses showed that neuroticism and perceptions of inequity in the relationship were associated with higher depression but {{differences were found between}} patients and partners in the way that inequity and depression were related. Cancer patients reported more symptom of depression when <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>they</b> invested too little in the relationship, whereas their partners were higher in depression when <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>they</b> received too little benefits in the relationship. The findings are discussed in tents of structural differences in roles between patients and caregiving partners...|$|R
