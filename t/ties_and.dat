5|$|Odubade {{began his}} {{football}} career in England, {{playing in the}} Sussex County League for Eastbourne Town in 2002, where he scored over 70 times in just two seasons at the East Sussex club in all competitions. This attracted the interest of Yeovil Town, and he later signed for the club in July 2004. At Yeovil, Odubade found first-team opportunities sparse, playing {{a total of six}} times during the club's 2004–05 campaign, scoring once. He left the club in February 2005 and joined Eastbourne Borough shortly after. The following season, Odubade impressed Oxford United manager Brian Talbot in two FA Cup <b>ties,</b> <b>and</b> he joined the League Two side two months later for a fee of £25,000.|$|E
5|$|Pennsylvania, {{which had}} {{abolished}} slavery in 1780, required any slaves {{brought to the}} city to be freed after six months' residency. The state law was challenged by French colonial refugees from Saint-Domingue, who brought slaves with them, but defended by the Pennsylvania Abolition Society. Through 1796, 500 slaves from Saint-Domingue gained freedom in the city. Because of the violence accompanying the revolution on the island, Philadelphians, many of whom had southern <b>ties,</b> <b>and</b> residents of the Upper South worried that free people of color would encourage slave insurrections in the U.S.|$|E

5|$|Prince Sihanouk was {{surprisingly}} acquiescent {{about the whole}} affair. He was {{under pressure from the}} U.S. to reopen diplomatic <b>ties</b> <b>and</b> to act militarily against the sanctuaries; from the North Vietnamese, who now received 80 percent of their supplies for their southernmost operations through Sihanoukville; and from the fledgling Chinese-supported Khmer Rouge (approximately 4,000 men). Sihanouk felt that this was a propitious moment to swing back to the right. By the summer he created a right-wing Government of National Salvation under General Lon Nol and he suspended DRV arms shipments through his ports.|$|E
5|$|Relations {{with other}} nations are {{generally}} positive. Shared democratic values ease relations with Western and European countries while similar economic concerns help in relations with other developing countries.

5|$|Since the {{counties}} were re-established in 1992, Croatia has been divided into 20 counties {{and the capital}} city of Zagreb, the latter having the authority and legal status of a county and a city at the same time (Zagreb County outside the city is administratively separate as of 1997). The county borders have changed in some instances since (for reasons such as historical <b>ties</b> <b>and</b> requests by cities), with the latest revision taking place in 2006. The counties subdivide into 127 cities and 429 municipalities.|$|E

5|$|The {{conversion}} of the Gaelic kingdom of Dál Riata in the west of modern Scotland is traditionally attributed {{to the work of}} St. Columba. However, given the close cultural and linguistic <b>ties,</b> <b>and</b> the short distance across the seas, between the region and Ireland, which had begun to be Christianised from at least the fifth century, it is likely that Christianity had already reached this part of modern Scotland before his arrival in the mid-sixth century. In this view, the role of clergy owing their loyalty to Iona and elsewhere was to consolidate the position of Christianity in the region and beyond and to provide pastoral care for the people there.|$|E

Among its 200-odd members today are luminaries of the Chinese business community such as the founder of the Overseas Union Bank, Lien Ying Chow, and United Overseas Bank chairman Wee Cho Yaw. It is still an all men's club– the youngest members are mainly in their 50s and membership is by invitation only.|$|E
