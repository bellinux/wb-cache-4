500|$|In February 1896, Hogan {{received}} {{an offer to}} manage the Youngstown (Ohio) Puddlers, a minor league team associated with the Interstate League. [...] The Vindicator reported that the outfielder refused the offer. [...] "Hogan expects to play again with the St. Louis team in the National League", the Vindicator stated. [...] The paper went on to quote an article that supposedly appeared in the Cincinnati-based Commercial Gazette: [...] "St. Louis fans {{are opposed to the}} idea of selling Marty Hogan, the fast out-fielder, who played with the Indianapolis <b>team</b> <b>last</b> season, having been loaned by the Browns". [...] In the spring of 1896, however, Hogan attempted to extricate himself from remaining contractual obligations to the St. Louis Browns. [...] Sporting Life reported, in May 1896, that Hogan was unsuccessful in his efforts to obtain a final release from the Browns, who retained him as an [...] "extra" [...] right fielder. [...] "Marty has not been given any kind of trial by the manager of the Browns, although he stood high in batting and base running in the Western League last year", the article stated. [...] "He is in fine condition, and is anxious to play, but does not prepare to be shifted about at the will of alleged managers". [...] The paper added that Hogan had returned to St. Louis in March 1896, prepared to [...] "purchase" [...] his release, [...] "but he has been held onto until now, when he could have secured $1550 for his services in the Western League". [...] Hogan appeared especially confident of his baserunning abilities. [...] The article noted that the outfielder had [...] "offered to match himself to run 100 yards for $500 a side against any player in the National League". [...] Meanwhile, his batting evidently continued to improve. On May 24, 1896, an article in the St. Paul (Minnesota) Globe indicated Hogan performed exceptionally well at the bat during a contest between the Hoosiers and the St. Paul Saints. [...] "Marty Hogan...through an inadvertent mix-up of pugilism and baseball...tried to hammer the face off the ball, which had tantalized the other Hoosiers", the article stated, [...] "and when Marty's work was done, the ball was out of the lot and he was on second base".|$|E

2500|$|By the 1960s, {{interest}} in the sport had waned outside of the capital, Honiara. The Solomon Islands national side made its debut in 1977, drawing a match against the touring Fijian national team. The team participated in the cricket tournament at the 1991 South Pacific Games in Papua New Guinea, and won at least one match (against New Caledonia). Cricket has since further declined in the country, with the national <b>team</b> <b>last</b> playing in 1999 (against an Australian club side). A national governing body, the Solomon Islands Cricket Association, was formed in 2000, at which point there were estimated to be only 18–20 indigenous players remaining (with the rest being expatriates from cricket-playing countries). A four-team league was established in Honiara in 2009, with support from AusAID (the Australian government's overseas aid program) [...] A writer in the 2015 Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, suggested that [...] "cricket now teeters precariously" [...] in the country.

2500|$|By {{the start}} of the 1937–38 season, rumours were rampant that the Maroon {{franchise}} would be moved to another city. In September 1937, Maroons president Donat Raymond said the team would be staying in Montreal. The team's bleak financial situation finally caught up with them as they finished 12–30–6, the club's worst season since winning only nine games in 1924–25. Lionel Conacher retired prior to the season to enter politics, winning a seat in the 1937 Ontario general election {{as a member of the}} Liberal Party. [...] Tommy Gorman had tried to convince Conacher to stay with the Maroons and take over as coach, his retirement led Gorman to hire King Clancy. Clancy did not help improve the team's record, and on December 29 he was fired after 18 games and Gorman was re-instated as coach. Their last game for the Maroons franchise, was a 6-3 loss on March 17 against the Canadiens. [...] They finished the season with a record of 12 wins, 30 losses and 6 ties for 30 points in 48 games, placing the <b>team</b> <b>last</b> in the Canadian Division and last overall in the league.|$|E

[...] He reportedly agreed to coach the school's baseball team to meet the cost of his education. [...] During the 1896 season, Sexton led the Wolverines to a 17–4–1 record. [...] He became involved in a controversy resulting from an 1896 baseball game against Indiana at Bloomington. [...] The Michigan Alumnus reported on the incident as follows:"In {{the second half of}} the seventh inning, with the score 11–11, one man out and another on base, the Indiana pitcher gave out and the captain noticed this and gave his umpire the tip to call the game, which he did, giving darkness as his reason, though the teams might easily have played a half hour or more longer. [...] Sexton, who was umpiring for Michigan, remonstrated at this, but the Indiana team left the field, giving Sexton the opportunity to declare the game forfeited to Michigan with a score of 9 to 0." ...|$|E
