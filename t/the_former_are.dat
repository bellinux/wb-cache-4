5|$|Distinct from Orders-in-Council are Orders of Council: <b>the</b> <b>former</b> <b>are</b> {{issued by}} the {{sovereign}} upon {{the advice of the}} Privy Council, whereas the latter are made by members of the Privy Council without requiring the sovereign's approval. They are issued under the specific authority of Acts of Parliament, and most commonly are used for the regulation of public institutions.|$|E
5|$|Applying the {{categorical}} imperative, duties arise because {{failure to}} fulfil them would either {{result in a}} contradiction in conception or in a contradiction in the will. <b>The</b> <b>former</b> <b>are</b> classified as perfect duties, the latter as imperfect. A perfect duty always holds true—there is a perfect duty to tell the truth, so we must never lie. An imperfect duty allows flexibility—beneficence is an imperfect duty {{because we are not}} obliged to be completely beneficent at all times, but may choose the times and places in which we are. Kant believed that perfect duties are more important than imperfect duties: if a conflict between duties arises, the perfect duty must be followed.|$|E
5|$|Play {{behaviour}} in calves differs {{between the}} sexes; females run or chase {{each other while}} males play-fight. <b>The</b> <b>former</b> <b>are</b> sexually mature {{by the age of}} nine years while the latter become mature around 14–15 years. Adulthood starts at about 18 years of age in both sexes. Elephants have long lifespans, reaching 60–70 years of age. Lin Wang, a captive male Asian elephant, lived for 86 years.|$|E
5000|$|It <b>is</b> {{assumed that}} <b>the</b> <b>former</b> one <b>is</b> more {{realistic}} evaluation, although with very laborious testing of results. Initially only {{the latter was}} used in evaluation but later <b>the</b> <b>former</b> <b>was</b> included.|$|R

50|$|In the Metaphysics, Aristotle {{discusses}} actuality (entelecheia, Greek: ἐντελέχεια) and potentiality (dynamis, Greek: δύναμις). <b>The</b> <b>former</b> <b>is</b> perfection, realization, {{fullness of}} being; the latter imperfection, incompleteness, perfectibility. <b>The</b> <b>former</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> determining, the latter the determinable principle. The unmoved movers are entirely actual, Actus Purus, {{because they are}} unchanging, eternal, immaterial substance.|$|R
5|$|The Mediterranean species Boletus poikilochromus {{somewhat}} resembles I.torosus, but {{can usually}} be distinguished by a smaller fruit body, a cylindrical stipe, and the lighter colours of younger mushrooms. Also, B.poikilochromus does not feature the colour change of the stipe base in mature fruit bodies that is seen in I.torosus. Imperator luteocupreus and Caloboletus radicans are also similar but the pores of <b>the</b> <b>former</b> <b>are</b> red and the flesh of latter has a bitter taste.|$|E
5|$|The Shasekishū, {{a book of}} Buddhist parables {{from the}} Kamakura period, {{makes a point of}} {{distinguishing}} between good and bad tengu. The book explains that <b>the</b> <b>former</b> <b>are</b> in command of the latter and are the protectors, not opponents, of Buddhism– although the flaw of pride or ambition has caused them to fall onto the demon road, they remain the same basically good, dharma-abiding persons they were in life.|$|E
5|$|Two {{distinct}} functions – {{first that}} of traction by adhesion as in an ordinary loco; second that of traction by pinions {{acting on the}} track bars. The brakes are four in number – two handbrakes, acting by friction; and two acting by preventing the free escape of air from cylinder and thus using compressed air in retarding {{the progress of the}} engine. <b>The</b> <b>former</b> <b>are</b> used for shunting whilst the later for descending steep gradients. One of the handbrakes acts on the tyres of the wheels in the ordinary manner and the second acts on grooved surfaces of the pinion axle, but can be used in those places where the rack is laid.|$|E

5|$|Saddlebreds are {{popularly known}} as show horses, with horses being shown saddle seat in both three-gaited and five-gaited classes. <b>The</b> <b>former</b> <b>are</b> the three common gaits seen in most breeds, the walk, trot and canter. The latter {{includes}} the three regular gaits, plus two four-beat ambling gaits known as the slow gait and the rack. The slow gait today is a four-beat gait in which the lateral pairs of legs leave the ground together, but strike the ground at different times, the hind foot connecting slightly before the forefoot. In the show ring, the gait should be performed with restraint and precision. The rack is also a four-beat gait, but with equal intervals between each footfall, making it a smooth gait to ride. In the show ring, the gait is performed with speed and action, appearing unrestrained. Historically, the slow gait could be either a running walk, the stepping pace, or the fox trot, however, the modern five-gaited Saddlebred usually performs the stepping pace.|$|E
5|$|The {{more typical}} soldier types of the Gorn are the Initiates, Warriors and Guardians. <b>The</b> <b>former</b> <b>are</b> the basic {{troops of the}} Gorn forces, and while they can run on four legs, they fight on two with an {{automatic}} rifle called the Ravager. The Warriors are more advanced, and carry a variety of weaponry along with basic armor. The Guardian type differs {{in that it is}} a melee type, armed with a large energy axe. However, the energy from the axe can also produce a shield to protect the holder as well. They are more advanced than both the Initiate and the Warrior classes in that they spend the vast majority of their time on two feet only. Of these fifteen classes, three were created to appear female.|$|E

25|$|Thin-film polarizers {{generally}} do not perform as well as Glan-type polarizers, but they are inexpensive and provide two beams that are about equally well polarized. The cube-type polarizers generally perform better than the plate polarizers. <b>The</b> <b>former</b> <b>are</b> easily confused with Glan-type birefringent polarizers.|$|E
25|$|The {{central part}} of the {{supraspinatus}} fossa and {{the upper part of the}} infraspinatous fossa, but especially <b>the</b> <b>former,</b> <b>are</b> usually so thin in humans as to be semitransparent; occasionally the bone is found wanting in this situation, and the adjacent muscles are separated only by fibrous tissue.|$|E

25|$|Nd:YAG absorbs {{mostly in}} the bands between 730–760nm and 790–820nm. At low current densities krypton flashlamps have higher output in those bands than do the more common xenon lamps, which produce more light at around 900nm. <b>The</b> <b>former</b> <b>are</b> {{therefore}} more efficient for pumping Nd:YAG lasers.|$|E
25|$|Butterflyfish {{look like}} smaller {{versions}} of angelfish (Pomacanthidae), but unlike these, lack preopercle spines at the gill covers.

Among the paraphyletic Perciformes, <b>the</b> <b>former</b> <b>are</b> probably not too distantly related to butterflyfish, whereas the Zanclidae seem far less close.|$|E

50|$|Traditionalism is not {{infrequently}} {{referred to}} as Conservative or even Ultra-conservative theory. Recent multi-dimensional typological attempt presents an ambiguous picture. Some detailed scholarly studies claim that Traditionalism and Conservatism are clearly distinct concepts, be it in case of Spain or in general. <b>The</b> <b>former</b> understands politics as means of achieving missionary Catholic objectives, the latter as a technique of exercising public power. <b>The</b> <b>former</b> <b>is</b> founded on unalterable nucleus, the latter is in principle evolutionary. <b>The</b> <b>former</b> <b>is</b> providential, <b>the</b> latter is deterministic and historicist. <b>The</b> <b>former</b> <b>is</b> incompatible with democracy, the latter is perfectly tailored to operate in a realm founded on sovereignty of the peoples assumption. <b>The</b> <b>former</b> <b>is</b> monarchist, <b>the</b> latter <b>is</b> accidentalist. <b>The</b> <b>former</b> <b>is</b> derived from vernacular cultural tradition, the latter is in principle universal. <b>The</b> <b>former</b> perceives society as based on presumed natural order, the latter as stemming from contractual and voluntaristic principles embodied in a constitution. <b>The</b> <b>former</b> understands society as composed of organic bodies, the latter as composed of free individuals. <b>The</b> <b>former</b> sees public power as united and integral, the latter as divided into legislative, executive and judicial branches. Perhaps a good though obviously simplistic way of summarizing {{the difference between the}} two is noting that while the Conservatives usually have no problem admitting their Right-wing identity, the Traditionalists are uneasy about it, pointing that their concept is rooted in pre-1789 realm, before the Right-Left paradigm had been even born.|$|R

25|$|All this {{suggests}} the deuterostomes and protostomes are separate, monophyletic lineages. The main phyla of deuterostomes are the Echinodermata and Chordata. <b>The</b> <b>former</b> <b>are</b> radially symmetric and exclusively marine, such as starfish, sea urchins, and sea cucumbers. The latter {{are dominated by}} the vertebrates, animals with backbones. These include fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals.|$|E
