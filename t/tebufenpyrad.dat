50|$|<b>Tebufenpyrad</b> {{exposure}} {{has been}} linked to cancer but to date no human data has been conclusive enough to link the two.Recently this pesticide has been shown to affect the dopaminergic neuronal cell lines N27 by disrupting the mitochondrial dynamics. Loss of dopaminergic cells have been linked to Parkinson's disease in which the neuronal mitochondria are affected. These findings may show that <b>tebufenpyrad</b> might also be able to affect the neurons.Overexposure of the pesticide has also {{led to the development of}} resistance among different target organisms.

50|$|<b>Tebufenpyrad</b> is {{a strong}} {{mitochondrial}} complex I inhibitor. Like Rotenone, it inhibits electron transport chain by inhibiting the complex I enzymes of mitochondria which ultimately leads to lack of ATP production and finally cell death.|$|E
50|$|Hydroxylation is {{the major}} and primary {{biotransformation}} of <b>tebufenpyrad</b> reported both in vivo and in vitro. Ethyl and tetra-butyl groups are the targets of hydroxylation. The alcohol groups are oxidized to carboxylic groups which can then be conjugated with other groups in vivo.In rodent studies it was shown that 80% of the pesticide was absorbed mainly in the digestive system within 24 hours, the major metabolites being the hydroxylated forms. Most of the compound and its metabolites were excreted through feces and urine. There {{was no evidence of}} accumulation {{in the body of the}} rodents.The metabolites excreted out differed from male to female in rodents. While males excreted the carboxylic derivatives of the parent compound, the female rats excreted the sulfate conjugates of carboxylic acid. Interestingly, the Lethal Dose 50(LD50) values of male and female rats was very different. While the LD50 value of female rats was 997 mg/kg the LD50 for male rats was only 595 mg/kg. This vast difference in LD 50 value might be attributed to this biotransformation.|$|E
40|$|Evidence {{continues}} to accumulate that pesticides {{are the leading}} candidates of environmental toxins that {{may contribute to the}} pathogenesis of Parkinson’s disease. The mechanisms, however, remain largely unclear. According to epidemiological studies, we selected nine representative pesticides (paraquat, rotenone, chlorpyrifos, pendimethalin, endosulfan, fenpyroximate, <b>tebufenpyrad,</b> trichlorphon and carbaryl) which are commonly used in China and detected the effects of the pesticides on mitochondria and ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) function. Our results reveal that all the nine studied pesticides induce morphological changes of mitochondria at low concentrations. Paraquat, rotenone, chlorpyrifos, pendimethalin, endosulfan, fenpyroximate and <b>tebufenpyrad</b> induced mitochondria fragmentation. Furthermore, some of them (paraquat, rotenone, chlorpyrifos, fenpyroximate and <b>tebufenpyrad)</b> caused a significant dose-dependent decrease of intracellular ATP. Interestingly, these pesticides which induce mitochondria dysfunction also inhibit 26 S and 20 S proteasome activity. However, two out of the nine pesticides, namely trichlorphon and carbaryl, were found not to cause mitochondrial fragmentation or functional damage, nor inhibit the activity of the proteasome, which provides significant guidance for selection of pesticides in China. Moreover, our results demonstrate a potential link between inhibition of mitochondria and the UPS, and pesticide-induced Parkinsonism...|$|E

Recovery ranged from 75 to 124 % with coefficients of variance ranging between 1 and 13 %. The limit of determination was 0. 01 mg/kg for all pesticides. The field trials showed a similar degradative behavior for all active ingredients (AI), with a great residue decrease {{during the first week}} and stability in the second.

40|$|A Belgian field strain (MR-VP) of Tetranychus urticae (Koch) (Acari: Tetranychidae) {{exhibits}} {{different levels}} of resistance to four frequently used METI (mitochondria) electron transport inhibitor) -acaricides, i. e. <b>tebufenpyrad,</b> fenpyroximate, pyridaben and fenazaquin. Resistance factors for these compounds were 184, 1547, 5971 and 35, respectively. A 23. 5 -fold increase in 7 -ethoxy- 4 -trifluoromethylcoumarin O-deethylation activity suggested that metabolic resistance through elevated levels of cytochrome P 450 dependent monooxygenase-activity is a possible resistance mechanism. However, synergism studies with different metabolic inhibitors revealed some contrasting resistance mechanisms between the METI-acaricides. <b>Tebufenpyrad</b> resistance could only be synergized after pre-treatment with the monooxygenase inhibitor piperonyl butoxide (PBO), whereas pyridaben resistance was strongly synergized both by PBO and the esterase inhibitor S,S,S-tributylphosphorotrithioate (DEF). Resistance levels to fenpyroximate could neither be suppressed by PBO nor by DEF. Although METI-acaricides are structurally related, these findings probably reflect a different role of esterases and monooxygenases in metabolic detoxification between these compounds. The overall lack of synergism by diethylmaleate (DEM) suggests that glutathione-S-transferases are not {{an important factor in}} resistance to METIs. Reciprocal crosses between susceptible females and resistant males showed no maternal effect, and resistance to METI-acaricides was inherited generally as a dominant trait. Backcrosses with F, females revealed striking differences in the mode of inheritance. Although resistance to fenpyroximate and pyridaben was under monogenic control, resistance to <b>tebufenpyrad</b> was under control of more than one gene...|$|E
40|$|A highly {{sensitive}} and selective method of pyraclostrobin, boscalid, <b>tebufenpyrad</b> and prohexadione-calcium determination under their combined presence in water sample, using {{high-performance liquid chromatography}} was developed. On the base of mentioned active ingredients (combined fungicide Bellis, insecto-acaricide Masai and plant growth regulator Regalis) pesticides {{may be used in}} one vegetation season for fruit trees protection. Method of co-determination of these substances is based on the preparation of water samples for extraction, extraction of pyraclostrobin, boscalid, <b>tebufenpyrad</b> and prohexadione-calcium, concentrating of extract of substances mixtures and chromatographic determination with ultraviolet detection. A distinctive feature of this method is changing of ratio of components of mobile phase (mixture of acetonitrile and 0, 1 % aqueous solution of phosphoric acid) in the process of chromatographic analysis, which allowed to clearly visualize test substances in case of their joint presence in one sample. Implementation of developed and patented method into practice optimizes control over application of pesticides in agriculture and their monitoring in reservoirs water by significant acceleration of analysis and reduction of expenses in its carying out...|$|E
40|$|Consumers {{are exposed}} daily to several {{pesticide}} residues in food, {{which can be}} of potential concern for human health. Based on a previous study dealing with exposure of the French population to pesticide residues via the food, we selected 14 pesticides frequently found in foodstuffs, {{on the basis of}} their persistence in the environment or their bioaccumulation in the food chain. In a first step, the objective of this study was to investigate if the 14 selected pesticides were potentially cytotoxic and genotoxic. For this purpose, we used a new and sensitive genotoxicity assay (the γH 2 AX test, involving phosphorylation of histone H 2 AX) with four human cell lines (ACHN, SH-SY 5 Y, LS- 174 T and HepG 2), each originating from a potential target tissue of food contaminants (kidney, nervous system, colon, and liver, respectively). <b>Tebufenpyrad</b> was the only compound identified as genotoxic and the effect was only observed in the SH-SY 5 Y neuroblastoma cell-line. A time-course study showed that DNA damage appeared early after treatment (1 h), suggesting that oxidative stress could be responsible for the induction of γH 2 AX. In a second step, three other pesticides were studied, i. e. bixafen, fenpyroximate and tolfenpyrad, which - like tebufenpad - also had a methyl-pyrazole structure. All these compounds demonstrated genotoxic activity in SH-SY 5 Y cells at low concentration (nanomolar range). Complementary experiments demonstrated that the same compounds show genotoxicity in a human T-cell leukemia cell line (Jurkat). Moreover, we observed an increased production of reactive oxygen species in Jurkat cells in the presence of the four methyl-pyrazoles. These results demonstrate that <b>tebufenpyrad,</b> bixafen, fenpyroximat and tolfenpyrad induce DNA damage in human cell lines, very likely by a mode of action that involves oxidative stress. Nonetheless, additional in vivo data are required before a definitive conclusion can be drawn regarding hazard prediction to humans...|$|E

40|$|The two-spotted {{spider mite}} Tetranychus urticae is an {{economically}} important pest in many agricultural crops worldwide. Its high reproductive potential and extremely short life cycle, combined with the frequent acaricide applications usually required to maintain the population below economic threshold, facilitates rapid resistance build-up. This {{has led to the}} development of resistance against almost all commercially used compounds. In this study we tried to unravel the mechanisms behind the resistance against a number of acaricides with different mode of action at the toxicological, biochemical, genetic and molecular level. In a first series of experiments, we investigated pyrethroid resistance in Greek T. urticae strains. Combined data from toxicological bioassays and biochemical and synergistic studies indicated that although enhanced P 450 mono-oxygenase activities were associated with resistance, target site insensitivity proved to be the major resistance component. In order to get a better insight in the latter, a 3. 3 kb cDNA fragment of the T. urticae para sodium channel gene encompassing segment 4 of domain II to segment 6 of domain IV was obtained by a degenerate PCR strategy. The T. urticae sequence showed highest identity (56 %) to the scabies mite, Sarcoptes scabiei, and was phylogenetically classified within the divergent group of Arachnida. Comparison of resistant and susceptible strains identified the point mutation F 1538 I in segment 6 of domain III, which is known to confer strong resistance to pyrethroids, along with a second mutation (A 1215 D) in the intracellular linker connecting domains II and III, which still has an unknown role. Also, three alternative splicing variants were identified, of which two correspond to the mutually exclusive k/l exon pair already identified in insects. The mode of inheritance of resistance was confirmed to be almost completely recessive, which is consistent with studies on the target site mechanism for pyrethroids in other organisms. In T. urticae, organophosphate and carbamate resistance is often caused by acetylcholinesterase insensitivity. By combining toxicological, biochemical and molecular data from three reference laboratory and three organophosphate resistant (OP) strains, the AChE 1 mutations associated with resistance in T. urticae were characterised. The resistance ratios of the OP strains varied from 9 to 43 for pirimiphos-methyl, from 78 to 586 for chlorpyrifos, from 8 to 333 for methomyl and from 137 to 4164 for dimethoate. Compared to the reference strains, the insecticide concentration needed to inhibit 50 % of the AChE 1 activity in the OP strains was at least 2. 7, 55, 58 and 31 times higher for the OP pirimiphos-methyl, chlorpyrifos oxon, paraoxon and omethoate respectively, and 87 times higher for the carbamate carbaryl. By comparing the AChE 1 sequence between laboratory and OP strains, four amino acid substitutions were detected: (1) F 331 W which was present in all three OP strains; (2) T 280 A found in the three OP strains but not in all clones; (3) G 328 A, found in two OP strains; (4) A 201 S found in only one OP strain. F 331 W, G 328 A and A 201 S are possibly involved in resistance to organophosphate and carbamate insecticides. These findings were also confirmed by means of a structural model. F 331 W is probably the most important and the most common in T. urticae. It can be easily detected by a diagnostic PCR-RFLP assay developed in this study. We also evaluated the possible antagonism of organophosphate and carbamate insecticides on the toxicity of bifenazate in T. urticae when applied in mixtures. Bifenazate, a new and frequently used carbazate, is a pro-acaricide which needs to be activated by carboxylesterases. Two OP strains were used and several organophosphate (chlorpyrifos, azinphos methyl and phosmet) and carbamate (carbaryl and methomyl) insecticides were evaluated. Mixing chlorpyrifos with bifenazate strongly decreased bifenazate toxicity in both tested strains. However, in the strain with a higher esterase activity, antagonism decreased after 2 days. Of all other tested chemicals, only methomyl displayed an antagonistic effect 1 day after treatment. These findings indicate that mixing organophosphate and carbamate insecticides with bifenazate may inhibit bifenazate efficacy under field conditions, especially when resistant strains are present. Spirodiclofen, a recently developed and commercialized acaricide, is a selective, non-systemic tetronic acid derivative. In order to develop strategies to minimise resistance in the field to spirodiclofen, we selected a T. urticae population for spirodiclofen resistance in the laboratory. This selection yielded a strain with a resistance ratio of 274, determined on the larval stage. This strain was used to determine genetic, toxicological, biochemical and cross-resistance data. The egg stage of the resistant strain remained far more susceptible than the mobile stages. No cross-resistance was found against other acaricides, except for spiromesifen, another tetronic acid derivative. Based on synergist experiments and enzyme assays, it appeared that especially P 450 mono-oxygenases, but also esterases and glutathione-S-transferases, could be involved in the metabolic detoxification of spirodiclofen. Pre-treatment of the resistant females with the synergists PBO or DEF could increase the inhibitory effect of spirodiclofen on reproduction, again demonstrating the possible involvement of mono-oxygenases and esterases. Among the esterases of T. urticae, probably only a few are more expressed in spirodiclofen resistant strains, and these apparently prefer the purpose-designed substrate 1 -naphthyl 2, 2 -dimethylbutyrate. This was also confirmed by separating esterase isozymes by native isoelectric focusing. Because spirodiclofen interferes with lipid biosynthesis, total lipid content was measured in female adults. No significant differences between treated and non-treated female adults were found, both in the susceptible and resistant strain. However, the total lipid content in the resistant females was significantly higher than in susceptible females. The genetic analysis using crossing experiments showed that the resistance is inherited as an intermediate trait under control of more than one gene. Resistance to spirodiclofen in the laboratory selected strain exceeded by far the recommended field rate, showing the capacity for quick resistance development in the field. A good acaricide resistance management programme is necessary to prevent fast resistance build-up in the field. However, without selection pressure, resistance tends to be unstable and can decrease in the presence of susceptible individuals owing to the intermediate, polygenic inheritance mode. No evidence was found to support the existence of other resistance mechanisms, like mutations in the target site (ACCase) or overproduction of the target enzyme. In order to facilitate designing new ACCase inhibitor insecticides and understanding mechanism of resistance to currently used ACCase inhibitors, we tried to clone and express T. urticae ACCase using different expression systems. The most promising results were achieved by a baculovirus expression system and also by heat-shocking Codon Rare E. coli cells with the pET-ACC vector. More efforts should be done to overcome several problems in expressing this enzyme e. g. by optimizing conditions to get higher levels of expression, protein solubility, activity and stability. We also performed a practical screening in Dutch cut rose glasshouses due the fact that growers complained on failing spider mite control. In order to check whether control failure was caused by resistance, the susceptibility of 15 strains, sampled from infested roses, was tested to 11 acaricides: <b>tebufenpyrad,</b> milbemectin, abamectin, cyflumetofen, bifenthrin, spiromesifen, hexythiazox, etoxazole, bifenazate, acequinocyl and chlorpyrifos. Three doses were used to discern between resistance and susceptibility: the recommended field dose (FD), FD/ 5 and FD x 5. Ten of these strains were screened for known resistance mechanism such as elevated detoxifying enzyme activities and previously reported resistance mutations using biochemical and molecular diagnostics. Potential cross-resistance between acaricides was estimated by correlation analysis. The strains showed different levels of resistance to tested acaricides. Twelve out of 15 strains showed resistance against hexythiazox, and 9 out of 15 against bifenthrin and <b>tebufenpyrad.</b> Two strains were found which showed high levels of resistance to most tested insecticides, even against one which has not been registered in Europe. A high correlation was found between some acaricides, e. g. between abamectin and milbemectin. Without selection pressure, resistance seemed to be unstable in most cases, after one year. All field strains had an increased metabolic activity, compared to the susceptible strains. A number of amino acid substitutions known to be involved in resistance to different groups were present in different strains. The best example was the presence of the F 331 W substitution in the acetylcholine esterase, which was present in all field strains tested. The results obtained in this research may all together lead to a better understanding of acaricide resistance in T. urticae, which, in turn, may lead to more efficient resistance management programs...|$|E
