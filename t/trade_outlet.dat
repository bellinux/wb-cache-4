5|$|The first {{trading post}} {{at the site of}} the Port of Split was Aspalathos, {{established}} by Greek settlers from the island of Vis in the 4th century BC. Position of the trading post was selected because of its location in a natural harbor and its proximity to numerous Adriatic Sea islands and extensive hinterland populated by Illyrians, most notably in Salona. The area subsequently became a part of the Roman Empire, and after its Decline of the Roman Empire, the coast was brought under rule of the Byzantine Empire, until the area was absorbed into the Kingdom of Croatia in the beginning of the 10th century. In 1102, Croatia and Kingdom of Hungary were joined in a personal union. By the 12th century, Split had developed trading routes with its hinterland and maritime trade throughout the Adriatic Sea and the Mediterranean. The Republic of Venice of gained full control of Dalmatia and the city of Split by 1428. In the 16th century, Split was the central maritime <b>trade</b> <b>outlet</b> of the Balkans, where goods were transported from the Ottoman Empire, India and Persia to the Venetian Republic and vice versa. After the fall of Venice, Split was briefly ruled by the Habsburg Monarchy and Austrian Empire between 1797 and 1806, and the First French Empire until 1813 when Austrian rule was restored. In that period, trade routes shifted to other Adriatic ports, especially the Port of Rijeka, causing a downturn in the city's economy.|$|E

30|$|The {{economic}} {{interpretation of}} the ordinal RAS procedure is that a matrix of intermediate transactions is adjusted to consider substitution and fabrication effects 8. This arises because we use the RAS method on an interregional trade matrix including intermediate and final demand; the RAS procedure thus involves not only the two effects but also the change of the <b>trade</b> <b>outlet</b> and the substitution of demand between self-supplied products and imports. It is assumed that the former occurs via adjustments to the row quantities and the latter via adjustments to the column quantities.|$|E

40|$|The goal of {{this work}} is to specify the {{relation}} between crisis management and company control and to suggest possible application in implementing of crisis management principles into company control. The research was performed in the period 2003 [...] 2005. Crises of companies are significant and generally unexpected situations which threaten {{the goal of the}} company or its existence temporarily or permanently. The impact of such situation can significantly harm the company, its employees, products or services and public reputation. The crises are induced by the pressure of inner or outer events which make the management do urgent decisions. This can be downfall of the market, legislative restrictions, fall of the exchange rate (in foreign currency), unsuccessful innovation, new competitive product etc. The company which was analyzed offers more possibilities for application of crisis management. In the thesis we mention the relation of company control [...] director general and crisis management in certain division "subordinate to director general. In the thesis we examined certain model situations when the crisis of a company can happen. The main reasons for crisis situations are loss of <b>trade</b> <b>outlet,</b> loss of consumers, competition, unfulfillment of production and overflow of production. Unreasonable overflow of manufacturing capacity results in unfulfillment of promised dates, deterioration in quality, and the outcome can be loss of the customer. All these situations can affect the company so {{it is important to be}} ready for them. The main recommendation for managing a company lie in consistent performance of economic and financial analyses and their inspection and evaluation. This will help the management of the company to identify beginning of a crisis. If the crisis situation occurs in a company, the management and owners of the company should consider if they involve crisis management in governing the company or if they want to solve the problems with current management. Although it is not apparent, current management is actually crisis management. Partial changes and suggestions are the following: looking for new trades, reinforcement in marketing and commercial section, permanent preparedness for crisis situations and preparedness of crisis plan, avoiding to be dependant on one customer and regular checking of trade and operative plans...|$|E
40|$|The {{business}} environment is currently typified by rapid and ongoing change, which causes {{the future to}} be increasingly unpredictable and unsettled. Companies are struggling to maintain their competitive edge and to survive. It is therefore important that management should ensure that the necessary competencies and abilities are available to enable the coordination of both diversifies and specialized functions within the organisation, providing for current and future requirements. The {{purpose of this study}} is to determine the relationship between embarking on the Competency Acquisition Process (CAP) learning program for account managers and work performance. In order to attain this goal, the primary focus of the literature study was investigating what a learning organisation is, the importance and principles of a learning organisation, the types of learning and characteristics and approaches to a learning organisation. The company as a learning organisation and CAP was defined. Learning is then linked to performance by looking at the relationship between the two variables and also comparing the traditional approach of training with learning as a process. A questionnaire was designed consisting of forced-choice questions and answers and some open-ended questions. The purpose was to survey a large number of people about the topic of the research. Percentage in sales growth per sales staff member was obtained from the sales database department, and correlations were made with CAP progress data on SAP HR. From the analysis of data the following results were apparent: [...] Embarking on CAP improved the relationship between subordinates and management and also assisted in improving teamwork amongst team members. [...] Most sales staff believes that CAP significantly influenced their In <b>Trade</b> <b>Outlet</b> Survey (ITOS) ratings. [...] CAP assisted the company in gaining a larger market share. [...] The majority of the respondents strongly agreed that the competencies and knowledge gained through CAP assisted them in increasing their sales of carbonated soft drinks. [...] CAP is believed to have improved the company’s Customer Service Measurement. [...] CAP significantly improved the levels of confidence of the sales staff. [...] 99 % of the respondents believe that the Value Chain learning outcome positively influenced their work performance. [...] 99 % of the respondents believe that the learning outcome: Knowledge of how sales fits in the Value Chain positively influenced their work performance. [...] Every respondent in the survey believed the product knowledge module had a positive impact on their work performance. [...] CAP emerged to be the learning intervention that has the most impact on the work performance of sales staff, followed by coaching by managers and the Sales Academy. [...] The results of the survey indicated that 96 % of the respondents believe that CAP was a worthwhile initiative. Significant differences were found in sales growth since embarking on CAP between different race groups. Significant differences for CAP progress were found in respect of different plants. The research aimed to prove the hypothesis that CAP improved work performance. The core measurement of sales staff is growing sales volume, with all the other measurements measured in the questionnaire supporting this core function. Copyright 2005, University of Pretoria.
