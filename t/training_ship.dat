5|$|Asama was {{reclassified}} as a <b>training</b> <b>ship</b> in 1942 {{and became}} a gunnery <b>training</b> <b>ship</b> later that year. She was disarmed {{at some point during}} the war, only retaining several 8cm/40 3rd Year Type anti-aircraft guns. The ship survived the war intact and she and Tokiwa were stricken from the navy list in November 1945. Asama was scrapped in 1946–47 while Tokiwa was refloated in 1947 and scrapped that same year.|$|E
5|$|Asama was {{reclassified}} as a <b>training</b> <b>ship</b> in July 1942 and was towed to Shimonoseki 5 August 1942 {{where she}} became a gunnery <b>training</b> <b>ship.</b> She was disarmed {{at some point during}} the Pacific War, only retaining several 8cm/40 3rd Year Type anti-aircraft guns, and she was stricken from the navy list on 30 November 1945.

5|$|Courbet became {{flagship}} of Vice-Amiral Charlier between 6 June 1919 and 20 October 1920. The {{following year}} {{she became a}} gunnery <b>training</b> <b>ship</b> at Toulon, but she suffered a serious boiler fire in June 1923 that caused her to be repaired and given the first of her upgrades between July and April 1924 at La Seyne-sur-Mer. She had another boiler fire in August 1924 and remained under repair {{for the rest of}} the year, but resumed her duties as a gunnery <b>training</b> <b>ship</b> upon her return from the dockyard. She was refitted again between January 1927 and January 1931. She was transferred from the gunnery school to the navigation school in 1937, before her final prewar refit between April 1937 to September 1938. By 1939 she reverted to her role as a gunnery <b>training</b> <b>ship,</b> but she was ordered to Brest and Quiberon with her sister Paris upon the outbreak of World War II.|$|E
5|$|Rearmed and re-boilered by the Japanese, Suwo was {{reclassified}} by the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) as {{a coastal}} defense ship in 1908 {{and served as}} a <b>training</b> <b>ship</b> for several years. She was the flagship of the Japanese squadron that participated in the Battle of Tsingtao at the beginning of World War I and continued in that role until she became a gunnery <b>training</b> <b>ship</b> in 1917. The ship was disarmed in 1922 to comply with the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty and probably scrapped around that time.|$|E
5|$|Starting in 1916, {{the ships}} of the Braunschweig class were {{withdrawn}} from active service, {{primarily because of}} manpower shortages. Braunschweig {{was used as a}} <b>training</b> <b>ship,</b> and on 20 August 1917, was converted into a barracks ship in Kiel. Elsass was also used as a barracks and <b>training</b> <b>ship</b> in Kiel, having been withdrawn from active service on 25 July 1916. Hessen was converted into a depot ship in Brunsbüttel in 1917, while Preussen became a depot ship in Wilhelmshaven that same year. Lothringen was withdrawn from service in 1917 and used as an engineer <b>training</b> <b>ship</b> in Wilhelmshaven. Guns removed from these ships starting in 1916 were used by the Imperial Army in World War I as railway guns.|$|E

5|$|The Gazelle-class cruisers {{served in}} various {{capacities}} after their commissioning. Most of them {{served with the}} fleet reconnaissance force, though several served on foreign stations as well. Gazelle served abroad in 19021904, Thetis in 19021906, Niobe in 19061909, and Arcona in 19071910. Nymphe was also used as a <b>training</b> <b>ship</b> for naval cadets {{in addition to her}} fleet scout role, and Undine served as a gunnery <b>training</b> <b>ship.</b>|$|E
5|$|The KJRM {{included}} several miscellaneous vessels {{that were not}} allocated to a particular division. They included the gunnery <b>training</b> <b>ship</b> Dalmacija, the gunboat Beli Orao and the converted seaplane tender/minelayer Zmaj.|$|E
5|$|After commissioning, Schlesien was {{assigned}} to the I Battle Squadron of the High Seas Fleet. She served with the fleet throughout {{the first two years of}} World War I; by this time she had been transferred to the II Battle Squadron alongside her four sister ships. Schlesien was present at the Battle of Jutland on 31 May – 1 June 1916, where she was actively engaged only briefly. After Jutland, she was relegated to guard duties before being withdrawn altogether in 1917, when she became a <b>training</b> <b>ship.</b> The Treaty of Versailles permitted the German navy to retain eight obsolete battleships, which included Schlesien, to defend the German coast. She saw extensive service with the reorganized Reichsmarine; in the 1920s and 1930s the ship was rebuilt and eventually converted back into a <b>training</b> <b>ship.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Pennsylvania Nautical School {{had several}} alumni associations. The {{first was the}} Pennsylvania Nautical School Association (PNSA). PNSA was formed in 1905 and {{published}} the short-lived the Log of the PNSA, which later {{became part of the}} Log of the American Merchant <b>Training</b> <b>Ships,</b> a monthly publication of the Allied Associations of the Massachusetts, New York, and Pennsylvania Merchant <b>Training</b> <b>Ships.</b>|$|R

5|$|After the war, Mississippi was {{converted}} into a gunnery <b>training</b> <b>ship,</b> and was also used to test new weapons systems. These included the RIM-2 Terrier missile and the AUM-N-2 Petrel missile. She was eventually decommissioned in 1956 and sold to ship breakers in November that year.|$|E
5|$|Ark Royal was recommissioned in 1930 {{to serve}} as a <b>training</b> <b>ship,</b> for {{seaplane}} pilots and to evaluate aircraft catapult operations and techniques. She was renamed HMS Pegasus in 1934, freeing the name for the aircraft carrier ordered that year, and continued {{to serve as}} a <b>training</b> <b>ship</b> until the beginning of the Second World War in September 1939. Assigned to the Home Fleet {{at the beginning of the}} war, she took on tasks as an aircraft transport, in addition to her training duties, until she was modified to serve as the prototype fighter catapult ship in late 1940. This type of ship was intended to defend convoys against attacks by German long-range maritime patrol bombers by launching fighters via their catapult to provide air cover for the convoy. Pegasus served in this role until mid-1941 when she reverted to her previous duties as a <b>training</b> <b>ship.</b> This lasted until early 1944 when she became a barracks ship. The ship was sold in late 1946 and her conversion into a merchant ship began the following year. However, the owner ran out of money during the process and Anita I, as she had been renamed, was seized by her creditors in 1949 and sold for scrap. She was not broken up until late 1950.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War I in August 1914, Caesar was brought back into full commission and transferred to the 7th Battle Squadron of the Channel Fleet; the squadron was charged with the defence of the English Channel. During this service she helped in transporting the Plymouth Marine Division from Plymouth to Ostend, Belgium, and covered {{the passage of the}} British Expeditionary Force from England to France in September 1914. In December 1914, Caesar was detached from the 7th Battle Squadron and transferred to Gibraltar to serve as guard ship and gunnery <b>training</b> <b>ship</b> there. In July 1915, she transferred to the North America and West Indies Station, serving as guard ship and gunnery <b>training</b> <b>ship</b> at Bermuda and patrolling the Atlantic.|$|E

5|$|Despite serving {{for over}} thirty years, the ships had uneventful careers. They spent {{their first two}} decades in service with the Active and Reserve Squadrons, where they were {{primarily}} occupied with training maneuvers. Lepanto was converted into a <b>training</b> <b>ship</b> in 1902 and Italia was significantly modernized in 190508 before also becoming a <b>training</b> <b>ship.</b> They briefly saw action during the Italo-Turkish War, where they provided gunfire support to Italian troops defending Tripoli. Lepanto was discarded in early 1915, though Italia continued on as a guard ship during World War I, eventually being converted into a grain transport. She was ultimately broken up for scrap in 1921.|$|E
5|$|In January 1919, Collingwood was {{transferred}} to Devonport and assigned to the Reserve Fleet. Upon {{the dissolution of the}} Grand Fleet on 18 March, the Reserve Fleet was redesignated the Third Fleet and Collingwood became its flagship. She became a tender to HMS Vivid on 1 October and served as a gunnery and wireless telegraphy (W/T) <b>training</b> <b>ship.</b> The W/T school {{was transferred}} to Glorious on 1 June 1920 and the gunnery duties followed in early August; Collingwood returned to the reserve. She became a boys' <b>training</b> <b>ship</b> on 22 September 1921 until she was paid off on 31 March 1922. Collingwood was sold to John Cashmore Ltd for scrap on 12 December and arrived at Newport, Wales, on 3 March 1923 to be broken up.|$|E

The ships are used by the Naval academy of Finland for basic seamanship training, with particular emphasis on navigation in coastal and archipelago waters. The vessels in the class are Fabian Wrede, Wilhelm Carpelan and Axel von Fersen. All ships were built by Uudenkaupungin työvene Oy and commissioned between 2006 and 2008. The ships will replace the old Heikki class <b>training</b> <b>ships.</b>|$|R
5|$|Iwate was {{assigned}} to the 12th Squadron of the 3rd Support Fleet from 1 February 1940. Despite her antiquated age, she was briefly re-classified as a 1st-class cruiser on 1 July 1942 before she was reclassified as a <b>training</b> <b>ship</b> in 1943.|$|E
5|$|Iwate {{was first}} used as a <b>training</b> <b>ship</b> in 1916 and {{remained}} in that role {{for most of the}} rest of her career. Her sister, Izumo, was mostly used for training during the 1920s, but became flagship of the IJN forces in China in 1932. She was involved in the Shanghai Incident that year and in the Second Sino-Japanese War that began five years later. The ship was used in the early stages of the Philippines Campaign during the Pacific War until she struck a mine at the end of 1941. Izumo joined her sister as a <b>training</b> <b>ship</b> in home waters in 1943. Both ships were sunk in a series of American air attacks on the naval base at Kure in July 1945. Their wrecks were refloated after the war and scrapped.|$|E
5|$|Kilkis {{underwent}} {{repairs and}} upgrades in 19261928 but was already obsolete due to low speed and low freeboard. The ship had her boilers re-tubed during this refit. On 29 November 1929, the Hellenic Navy announced that Kilkis would be withdrawn from service and broken up for scrap. Consequently, in 1930, Georgios Averof replaced {{her as the}} fleet flagship. Nevertheless, Kilkis remained in service with the fleet until 1932. The ship was then withdrawn from the active fleet and used as a <b>training</b> <b>ship.</b> A failed insurrection in the Greek fleet in March 1935 led {{to a reduction in}} the number of personnel in the Navy. As a result, Kilkis and Georgios Averof were removed from active service. After the revolt, Kilkis was used as a <b>training</b> <b>ship</b> for anti-aircraft gunners.|$|E
