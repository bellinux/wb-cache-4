5|$|The {{subsequent}} Bloody Assizes of Judge Jeffreys were {{a series}} of trials of Monmouth's supporters in which 320 people were condemned to death and around 800 sentenced <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>transported</b> to the West Indies.|$|E
5|$|An alloy of {{aluminium}} and gallium in pellet form added to {{water can be}} used to generate hydrogen. The process also produces alumina, but the expensive gallium, which prevents the formation of an oxide skin on the pellets, can be re-used. This has important potential implications for a hydrogen economy, as hydrogen can be produced on-site and does not need <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>transported.</b>|$|E

Transport and storage of the mixtures is usually by pumping, with operating pressures in the range 1 – 5  MPa, depending on the flow regime of the sludge and of the chemical-physical characteristics of the mix (AUA 2010).|$|R
5|$|Early May 2014 Dutch railway {{refurbishment}} and overhaul company NedTrain {{announced they}} {{had won the}} contract to refurbish the entire fleet. The first set was to arrive in May 2014 for inspection, scheduling of the works involved and evaluation of the process while {{the remainder of the}} fleet would come in from spring 2015. All sets were <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>transported</b> by rail via Sweden, Denmark and Germany to the main facility in Haarlem.|$|E
5|$|Mining and {{metallurgy}} developed further {{during the}} 16th century, and technical progress {{took place in}} various commercial applications. Great quantities of exported agricultural and forest products floated down the rivers <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>transported</b> through ports and land routes. This resulted in a positive trade balance for Poland throughout the 16th century. Imports from the West included industrial products, luxury products and fabrics.|$|E
5|$|Regardless of {{the outcome}} of the {{continental}} migration, the continued subduction process causes water <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>transported</b> to the mantle. After a billion years from the present, a geophysical model gives an estimate that 27% of the current ocean mass will have been subducted. If this process were to continue unmodified into the future, the subduction and release would reach an equilibrium after 65% of the current ocean mass has been subducted.|$|E
50|$|With the Triskelion having {{recently}} <b>been</b> <b>transported</b> <b>to</b> Iran, Thor <b>is</b> slowly teleporting S.H.I.E.L.D. personnel - including Iron Man, {{who recently}} had a relapse of his brain tumor - home to Manhattan. The New Ultimates, also having recently acquired Ant-Man and Black Widow, learn from Gregory Stark that New Prototype Super-Soldiers were stolen {{from one of his}} facilities. The team <b>is</b> then sent <b>to</b> Bulgaria to intercept the train believed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>transporting</b> the stolen property.|$|R
50|$|Southern Pacific and Burlington Northern (and their pre-merger railroads) {{operated}} the line jointly from 1925 until 1974, {{when it was}} purchased by Weyerhaeuser, who solely {{operated the}} entire railroad in support of its timber operations.

5|$|The {{lack of air}} {{transport}} meant that the division's two available brigades had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>transported</b> by sea. They would cross the Mediterranean in four Royal Navy cruisers with their escorts. If the landing was successful, the British 78th Infantry Division in Sicily and the 8th Indian Infantry Division in the Middle East, {{under the command of}} British V Corps, under Lieutenant General Charles Walter Allfrey, would be sent to reinforce the landings.|$|E
5|$|The {{service was}} {{provided}} by a fleet of 108 carriages manufactured for the UERL in the United States by the American Car and Foundry Company and assembled in Manchester. They were transported to London by rail but because the BS had no external railway connections, the carriages then had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>transported</b> across the city on horse-drawn wagons to their destination at London Road depot.|$|E
5|$|Unlike birds, {{many small}} insects are swept {{along by the}} {{prevailing}} winds {{although many of the}} larger insects are known to make migrations. Aphids are known <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>transported</b> long distances by low-level jet streams. As such, fine line patterns associated with converging winds within weather radar imagery, like the WSR-88D radar network, often represent large groups of insects.|$|E
50|$|With a pass {{signed by}} Himmler, Stroop {{travelled}} to the Alpine Redoubt {{with a group}} of teenaged Hitler Youth members whom he had been training for war.

5|$|A crypt was {{constructed}} beneath the former Chapel of St. Anthony in 2009 {{to house the}} remains of former Bishops of Hong Kong. This consists of two Vicar Apostolics, Timoleon Raimondi and Dominic Pozzoni, and all five deceased bishops—Enrico Valtorta, Lorenzo Bianchi, Francis Hsu, Peter Lei and John Wu. Bianchi's remains were interred later than the others {{due to the fact}} that he was buried in Milan. Thus, the diocese had to apply for permission to allow for some of his remains <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>transported</b> back to Hong Kong; the request was eventually granted.|$|E
5|$|A major railway, {{known as}} the Eurasian Land Bridge allows goods <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>transported</b> from China and the EEU to Europe. An {{expansion}} of the original railway line named the New Eurasian Land Bridge provides an uninterrupted rail link between China and the EEU. Talks with China, India and Burma are ongoing to expand the railway network. In June 2014, {{it was announced that}} Russia, North Korea and South Korea would cooperate to expand the Eurasian Land Bridge to connect the peninsula. Advantages of exporting products by rail through the EEU are reduced shipping times and reduced costs. The railways also have the potential for expansion, with the future creation of high-speed railway lines being considered.|$|E
5|$|Agriculture, and to {{a lesser}} extent forestry, are the main sources of income over most of the county of Carmarthenshire. On {{improved}} pastures, dairying is important and in the past, the presence of the railway enabled milk <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>transported</b> to the urban areas of England. The creamery at Whitland is now closed but milk processing still takes place at Newcastle Emlyn where mozzarella cheese is made. On upland pastures and marginal land, livestock rearing of cattle and sheep is the main agricultural activity. The estuaries of the Loughor and Towy provide pickings for the cockle industry.|$|E
50|$|According to {{historian}} Alfred de Zayas, {{the massacre}} {{was one of}} many incidents of the Royal Navy sinking Greek ships believed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>transporting</b> German soldiers and then firing on the survivors in the water or in lifeboats. All were investigated by the Wehrmacht War Crimes Bureau, which collected depositions from all surviving German and Greek witnesses, which confirm Ludovic Kennedys account of the massacre.|$|R

50|$|Accusations of or {{associations}} with corruption plagued the Duvalier-Bennett marriage. Michèle's father, Ernest Bennett, {{took advantage of}} his presidential connection to extend interests into his businesses, from his BMW dealership, to his coffee and cocoa export concerns, to Air Haiti, in whose planes Bennett <b>was</b> rumored <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>transporting</b> drugs. In 1982, Frantz Bennett, Michèle's brother, was arrested in Puerto Rico for drug trafficking, and began a three‑year jail term.|$|R
5|$|Also {{exceptionally}} challenging will be {{the movement}} and destruction of deadly agents such as sarin, VX nerve agents and mustard agent during the civil war. The chemical weapons convention disallows movement of such deadly agents outside the country holding them, but Security Council Resolution 2118 allows extraordinary measures {{to be taken in}} Syria. Some of the chemicals will need <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>transported</b> along the highway between Damascus and Homs, which is still contested as of December 2013. Syria has requested the international community provide armored vehicles to assist in safe transport of the chemicals. In February 2014, Syria stated that rebels had attempted to attack two convoys transporting chemical weapons.|$|E
5|$|Developed in the United States, the American Water Spaniel is the Wisconsin state dog. The breed {{originated}} in the areas along the Fox River and its tributary the Wolf River during the early 19th century. Hunters needed a dog that could work on both land and water, a versatile hunter skilled at bringing {{in a variety of}} game. Hunters also wanted a hunting dog compact enough <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>transported</b> in a small skiff, one that was able to withstand Wisconsin's cold water temperatures. Breeds involved {{in the creation of the}} American Water Spaniel are thought to have included the English Water Spaniel, Irish Water Spaniel, Curly Coated Retriever, native Indian Dogs, the Poodle, and either the Sussex Spaniel or another type of field spaniel.|$|E
5|$|Great Britain {{responded to}} the Boston Tea Party in 1774 with the Coercive Acts. The first of these acts was the Boston Port Act, which closed Boston's {{commerce}} until the East India Company had been repaid for the destroyed tea. The Massachusetts Government Act rewrote the Massachusetts Charter, making many officials royally appointed rather than elected, and severely restricting the activities of town meetings. The Administration of Justice Act allowed colonists charged with crimes <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>transported</b> to another colony or to Great Britain for trial. A new royal governor was appointed to enforce the acts: General Thomas Gage, who was also commander of British military forces in North America.|$|E
5|$|The {{dominant}} {{means of}} transport during the Olympics was by railway. Spectators heading <b>to</b> Birkebeineren <b>were</b> <b>transported</b> by train <b>to</b> Hovemoen Station on the Dovre Line, and would then <b>be</b> <b>transported</b> by shuttle bus to the stadium.

5|$|In Anglo-Saxon {{times the}} river formed a {{boundary}} between Wessex and Dumnonia. It later served the Port of Bridgwater, and enabled cargoes <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>transported</b> inland. The {{arrival of the}} railways led {{to a decline in}} commercial shipping, and the only working docks are at Dunball. Man's influence on the river has left a legacy of bridges and industrial artefacts. The Parrett along with its connected waterways and network of drains supports an ecosystem that includes several rare species of flora and fauna. The River Parrett Trail has been established {{along the banks of the}} river.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} control which genes are being transcribed, the cell {{separates}} some transcription factor proteins responsible for regulating gene expression from physical {{access to the}} DNA until they are activated by other signaling pathways. This prevents even low levels of inappropriate gene expression. For example, {{in the case of}} NF-κB-controlled genes, which are involved in most inflammatory responses, transcription is induced in response to a signal pathway such as that initiated by the signaling molecule TNF-α, binds to a cell membrane receptor, resulting in the recruitment of signalling proteins, and eventually activating the transcription factor NF-κB. A nuclear localisation signal on the NF-κB protein allows it <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>transported</b> through the nuclear pore and into the nucleus, where it stimulates the transcription of the target genes.|$|E
5|$|Late in 1910, the BX {{fulfilled}} {{a heroic}} role. The Chilco {{had been on}} its way up from Quesnel to Fort George in late November with Fort George's winter food supply when it met with an accident just above the Cottonwood Canyon and the food had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>transported</b> back to Quesnel. When news of this reached Fort George, pioneers Al Johnson and Russell Peden snow-shoed down to Quesnel to petition Captain Browne to make one last run with the BX with the necessary supplies. By then ice had begun to form along the river, but Captain Browne consented and brought the BX to Fort George, without {{as much as a}} scratch on her paint.|$|E
50|$|The {{chemical}} and isotopic composition of basalts found at hotspots differs subtly from mid-ocean-ridge basalts. This geochemical signature {{arises from the}} mixing of near-surface materials such as subducted slabs and continental sediments, in the mantle source. There are two competing interpretations for this. In the context of mantle plumes, the near-surface material <b>is</b> postulated <b>to</b> have <b>been</b> <b>transported</b> down <b>to</b> the core-mantle boundary by subducting slabs, and <b>to</b> have <b>been</b> <b>transported</b> back up <b>to</b> the surface by plumes. In {{the context of the}} Plate hypothesis, subducted material is mostly re-circulated in the shallow mantle and tapped from there by volcanoes.|$|R
