Since the typical scale of the inflaton mass of the chaotic inflation is around 10 ^ 13 GeV, the decay of the inflaton can produce the observed dark matter abundance if the reheating temperature is of order 1 GeV.

5|$|The date of {{egg-laying}} varies {{according to}} locality, but is generally from February to March in the Northern Hemisphere, and from July to August in the Southern Hemisphere, although the Australian subspecies macropus may breed as late as November, and equatorial populations may nest anytime between June and December. If the eggs are lost early in the nesting season, the female usually lays another clutch, although this is extremely rare in the Arctic due to the short summer season. Generally three to four eggs, but sometimes as few as one or as many as five, are laid in the scrape. The eggs are white to buff with red or brown markings. They are incubated for 29 to 33 days, mainly by the female, with the male also helping with the incubation of the eggs during the day, but only the female incubating them at night. <b>The</b> <b>average</b> <b>number</b> of young found in nests is 2.5, and <b>the</b> <b>average</b> <b>number</b> that fledge is about 1.5, due to the occasional production of infertile eggs and various natural losses of nestlings.|$|E
