5|$|Bush twice invoked , {{which allows}} a President to {{temporarily}} transfer the powers and duties {{of his office}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Vice</b> <b>President</b> who then becomes Acting President. On June 29, 2002, Bush underwent a colonoscopy and chose to invoke Section 3 of the amendment, making Vice President Dick Cheney the Acting President. The medical procedure began at 7:09am. EDT and ended at 7:29am. EDT. Bush woke up twenty minutes later, but did not resume his presidential powers and duties until 9:24am. EDT after the president's doctor, Richard Tubb, conducted an overall examination. Tubb said he recommended the additional {{time to make sure}} the sedative had no after effects. On July 21, 2007, Bush again invoked Section 3 in response to having to undergo a colonoscopy, again making Vice President Cheney the Acting President. Bush invoked Section 3 at 7:16am. EDT. He reclaimed his powers at 9:21am. EDT. In both cases, Bush specifically cited Section 3 when he transferred the Presidential powers <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Vice</b> <b>President</b> and when he reclaimed those powers.|$|E

5|$|On July 13, 1985, Reagan {{underwent}} surgery at Bethesda Naval Hospital to remove cancerous polyps from his colon. He relinquished presidential power <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Vice</b> <b>President</b> {{for eight hours}} in a similar procedure as outlined in the 25th Amendment, which he specifically avoided invoking. The surgery lasted just under three hours and was successful. Reagan resumed {{the powers of the}} presidency later that day. In August of that year, he underwent an operation to remove skin cancer cells from his nose. In October, more skin cancer cells were detected on his nose and removed.|$|E
5|$|On October 5, Secretary of State Robert Lansing was {{the first}} {{official}} to propose that Marshall forcibly assume presidential powers and duties. Other cabinet secretaries backed Lansing's request, as did Congressional leaders, including members of both the Democratic and Republican parties who sent private communications to Marshall. Marshall was cautious in accepting their offers of support. After consulting {{with his wife and}} his long-time personal adviser, Mark Thistlethwaite, he privately refused to assume Wilson's duties and become Acting President of the United States. The process for declaring a president incapacitated was unclear at that time, and he feared the precedent that might be set if he forcibly removed Wilson from his powers and duties. Marshall wanted the president to voluntarily allow his powers to devolve <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>vice</b> <b>president,</b> but that was impossible given his condition and unlikely given Wilson's dislike for Marshall. Marshall informed the cabinet that the only cases in which he would assume Wilson's powers and duties were a joint resolution of Congress calling on him to do so, or an official communication from Wilson or his staff asserting his inability to perform his duties.|$|E
5|$|Wilson {{was kept}} secluded {{by his wife}} and {{personal}} physician and only his close advisers were allowed to see him; none would divulge official information on his condition. Although Marshall sought to meet with Wilson to personally determine his condition, {{he was unable to}} do so, and relied on vague updates he received through a few bulletins published by Wilson's physician. Believing that Wilson and his advisers would not voluntarily transfer power <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>vice</b> <b>president,</b> a group of Congressional leaders initiated Marshall's requested joint resolution. The senators opposed to the League of Nations treaty, however, believed that as president Marshall would make several key concessions that would allow the treaty to win ratification. Wilson, in his present condition, was either unwilling or unable to make the concessions, and debate on the bill had resulted in a deadlock. In order to prevent the treaty's ratification, the anti-League senators blocked the joint resolution.|$|E

25|$|In 1968, {{she began}} {{applying}} for a position at Frontier Airlines as well as Continental Airlines and United Airlines. Lou Clinton wrote letters recommending her. She would renew her applications multiple times over a five-year period. In late 1972, a fellow flight instructor said {{he was hired by}} Frontier Airlines, strengthening Warner's resolve. At this point, Warner had been active in the aviation industry for more than twelve years. She had accrued more than 3,500 flight hours as a pilot and 7,000 hours as a flight instructor. Students she had trained were being hired with 1,500 to 2,000 hours of flying time. A friend who worked with Frontier introduced her <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>vice</b> <b>president</b> of flight operations there and Warner persisted in canvassing Frontier for a position.|$|E
25|$|Under Section 3 of the Twenty-fifth Amendment, the {{president}} may transfer {{the president}}ial powers and duties <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>vice</b> <b>president,</b> who then becomes acting president, by transmitting {{a statement to the}} Speaker of the House and the President pro tempore of the Senate stating the reasons for the transfer. The president resumes the discharge of the presidential powers and duties upon transmitting, to those two officials, a written declaration stating that resumption. This transfer of power may occur for any reason the president considers appropriate; in 2002 and again in 2007, President George W. Bush briefly transferred presidential authority to Vice President Dick Cheney. In both cases, this was done to accommodate a medical procedure that required Bush to be sedated; both times, Bush returned to duty later the same day.|$|E

If the vice president and Cabinet contest this claim, it is up to Congress, which must meet within two days if not already in session, to decide the merit of the claim.|$|E

Senator Thomas Hart Benton of Missouri had introduced a bill expunging the censure of Jackson. By resolution of the Democratic-controlled legislature, Tyler could be instructed to vote for the bill.
