In 1943 the revolutionary Mark 14 Gun Sight was introduced which made these guns even more effective; however, the 20mm guns were found to be ineffective against the Japanese Kamikaze attacks used during the latter half of World War II. They were subsequently phased out in favor of the heavier 40mm Bofors AA guns.|$|E

5|$|On Town Street, {{a row of}} brick-built cottages {{with stone}} slate roofs, known as Top of the town {{was built in the}} mid 18th century.

5|$|The victory {{strengthened}} {{the morale of}} the Albanians. There were few, if not any, officers and soldiers who deserted afterwards. The battle of Albulena has been seen as Skanderbeg's most brilliant victory over the Ottomans. However, it also marked <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>point</b> of the Albanian resistance, beginning a new phase in Skanderbeg's quarter-century long war which would include its fiercest Ottoman invasions. Even though Skanderbeg himself had died in January 1468, the war would drag on until 1478 and later in the same year the main Albanian fortress at Krujë fell, finally effecting the annexation of Skanderbeg's Albania by the Ottoman Empire.|$|E
5|$|The {{visit was}} <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>point</b> of {{relations}} between Diệm and Washington, as in later years, the US government {{and members of the}} AFV became increasingly disillusioned with Diệm's failure to liberalize his government and enact changes to make South Vietnam more democratic. The once-supportive media began to report on South Vietnam without overlooking problems in Diệm's administration. In 1963, American support for Diệm collapsed during the Buddhist crisis as Washington concluded that Diệm was incapable of offering a solid alternative to the communists, and he was overthrown in a US-backed military coup and executed after being captured.|$|E

5|$|A blocked {{field goal}} and extra-point attempt {{provided}} {{the margin of}} victory for the Miami Dolphins. Ex-Dolphin receiver Morris Owens came back to haunt his old team with three touchdown catches. Starting quarterback Parnell Dickinson threw the first, then was replaced by recently acquired quarterback Terry Hanratty after injuring his ankle. When Hanratty proved ineffective, Steve Spurrier, who had not practiced during the week due to a swollen knee, came off the bench to throw the final two touchdowns. It took a final-minute, 55-yard Garo Yepremian field goal to clinch the game for the Dolphins, whose pass defense had been decimated by injuries. 192 of the Buccaneers’ 334 total yards came through the air. John McKay would later point to this game as <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>point</b> of the Buccaneers’ season. Dolphins linebacker Nick Buoniconti saw it differently, calling the narrow victory “a disgrace” and “the low point in Miami Dolphins’ history”.|$|E
5|$|Celtic {{began the}} 2013–14 season with further Champions League success in their sights. Celtic were drawn with Cliftonville {{in their first}} {{qualifying}} round and easily disposed of the Northern Irish champions 50 on aggregate. They were next drawn with IF Elfsborg and squeezed by with a 10 aggregate win, with Kris Commons scoring the only goal in the first leg at Celtic Park. Although favoured {{to qualify for the}} group stages with minimal challenge after being drawn with Kazakh champions Shakhter Karagandy, Celtic found themselves losing the first leg in Karagandy 20. Celtic returned to Scotland to an electric atmosphere at Celtic Park in the home leg, in what proved to be <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>point</b> of their 2013–14 Champions League campaign. They overcame the 20 deficit to level the aggregate thanks to goals by Kris Commons and Georgios Samaras. James Forrest completed the comeback for Celtic with a 90th-minute strike, sending Celtic Park into a frenzy.|$|E

5|$|Emperor Zhang's (r.75–88 AD) reign came to {{be viewed}} by later Eastern Han {{scholars}} as <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>point</b> of the dynastic house. Subsequent reigns were increasingly marked by eunuch intervention in court politics and their involvement in the violent power struggles of the imperial consort clans. With {{the aid of the}} eunuch Zheng Zhong (d. 107 AD), Emperor He (r.88–105 AD) had Empress Dowager Dou (d.97 AD) put under house arrest and her clan stripped of power. This was in revenge for Dou's purging of the clan of his natural mother—Consort Liang—and then concealing her identity from him. After Emperor He's death, his wife Empress Deng Sui (d.121 AD) managed state affairs as the regent empress dowager during a turbulent financial crisis and widespread Qiang rebellion that lasted from 107 to 118 AD.|$|E
5|$|Mississippian {{society was}} complex, dense, and highly developed; the largest Mississippian city of Cahokia (in Illinois) {{contained}} {{as many as}} 30,000 inhabitants. They had a class society with certain groups specializing as artisans. The elite held related political and religious positions. Their cities were typically sited near rivers. Representing their cosmology, the central developments were dominated by a large central mound, several smaller mounds, and a large open plaza. Wooden palisades were built later around the complex, apparently for defensive purposes. The remains of a major settlement known as Angel Mounds lie east of present-day Evansville. Mississippian houses were generally square-shaped with plastered walls and thatched roofs. For reasons that remain unclear, the Mississippians disappeared {{in the middle of}} the 15thcentury, about 200years before the Europeans first entered what would become modern Indiana. Mississippian culture marked <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>point</b> of native development in Indiana.|$|E
5|$|Operation Donnerkeil {{had been}} an {{outstanding}} success for the Luftwaffe. The measure of success lay not in the ratio of losses, which amounted to 2:1 in the German favour, but {{the failure of the}} RAF, FAA and Royal Navy to intercept or at least inflict severe damage to the German warships. The meagre forces committed by the Navy had been repulsed easily by the German warships and their escorts. Heavy AAA fire had offered a helpful defence against air attack, but the German air defence had succeeded, along with poor weather, in breaking up RAF assaults on the ships. Galland, responsible for the plan, called it <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>point</b> of his career.|$|E
