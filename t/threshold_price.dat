The government was considering a variety of options to ensure an appropriate supply of energy for {{the nation as a}} whole. In 2003 important changes in oil policy were introduced that led to an increase in exploration, production, and reserves of oil and gas. Among those changes is the separation of state roles: Ecopetrol assumed a role as an operator with greater autonomy and more ability to compete. The new National Hydrocarbons Agency (Agencia Nacional de Hidrocarburos, ANH) became a resource administrator.

50|$|These {{restrictions}} have a dual {{effect in}} radical groups. Not {{only do they}} ensure that an individual {{is committed to the}} cause, but they also diminish individual’s access to consumption opportunities and social interaction that might persuade them to distance themselves from the cause. As individuals become more involved with radical activities, their social circles become more constrained, which diminishes contact with non-radicalized persons and further entrenches radicalized thinking. For example, when a young man spends several years in a Yeshiva in order to establish himself within a Haredi community, he foregoes future earnings that would be accessible should he choose a secular education. To quote Berman “As consumption opportunities are limited, work for pay becomes less appealing, freeing up even more time for community activities.” This sunk cost figures into future calculations, and raises the defection constraint in a way that non-radicalized group dynamics cannot. Going back to the Taliban convoy example, not only have the two footsoldiers in question have been vetted by demonstrating commitment to the cause, they also have had their exterior options limited such that {{it would be difficult to}} blend into a new environment for lack of skills and cultural understanding.

40|$|The seller's <b>threshold</b> <b>price</b> in name-your-own-price auctions varies over time.

In particular, we consider how the frequency of these expected changes affects the optimal pattern of bid sequences (e. g., strictly increasing over time or following a nonmonotonic pattern). We find that when the probability of a price change is moderate, consumers may have an incentive to use nonmonotonic bidding patterns. Rather than steadily increasing their bids over time, consumers will, {{at some point in the}} bid sequence, decrease their bid. However, when the expected probability of a price change is very low or very high, consumers do not have an incentive to use nonmonotonic bidding patterns. Interestingly, impatient bidders are more likely to decrease their bids at some point in the bid sequence than patient bidders. Finally, we find that more frequent price changes may increase customer satisfaction. name-your-own-price channel, bidding, rational decision making, buyer impatience, Priceline...|$|E

40|$|Name-Your-Own-Price is {{a popular}} {{interactive}} pricing mechanism in Electronic Commerce that lets both, buyer and seller, influence {{the price of a}} product.

40|$|Internet auctions {{have become}} an {{integral}} part of Electronic Commerce (EC) and a promising field for applying agent technologies. Although the Internet provides an excellent infrastructure for large-scale auctions, we must consider the possibility of a new type of cheating, i. e., a bidder trying to profit from submitting several bids under fictitious names (false-name bids). Double auctions are an important subclass of auction protocols that permit multiple buyers and sellers to bid to exchange a good, and have been widely used in stock, bond, and foreign exchange markets. If there exists no false-name bid, a double auction protocol called PMD protocol has proven to be dominant-strategy incentive compatible. On the other hand, if we consider the possibility of false-name bids, the PMD protocol is no longer dominant-strategy incentive compatible. In this paper, we develop a new double auction protocol called the <b>Threshold</b> <b>Price</b> Double auction (TPD) protocol, which is dominantstrategy incentive compatible even if participants can submit false-name bids. The characteristics of the TPD protocol is that the number of trades and prices of exchange are controlled by the <b>threshold</b> <b>price.</b> Simulation results show that this protocol can achieve a social surplus that is very close to being Pareto efficient. ...|$|E

The paper describes a model that explains the dynamics of commodity prices based on demand for inventory and on threshold prices that would induce producers to expand or contract operations. The paper concludes that in the short-run, producers ’ operating flexibility reduces price volatility when the spot price is higher than the <b>threshold</b> <b>price</b> which would cause expansion in the scale of operations. It further concludes that operating flexibility will raise price volatility when the spot price is lower than the <b>threshold</b> <b>price</b> which would result in a contraction of operations.

40|$|Article purchased; Published online: 7 August, 2017 In Nigeria, Aflasafe is a {{registered}} biological product for reducing aflatoxin infestation of crops from the field to storage, making the crops safer for consumption. The important questions are whether farmers will purchase and apply this product to reduce aflatoxin contamination of crops, and if so under what conditions. A study was carried out to address these questions and assess determinants of willingness to pay (WTP) for the product among maize and groundnut farmers in Kano and Kaduna states in Nigeria. A multistage sampling technique was used to collect primary data from 492 farmers. The majority of farmers who had direct experience with Aflasafe (experienced farmers) in Kano (80. 7 %) and Kaduna (84. 3 %) had a WTP bid value {{equal to or greater}} than the <b>threshold</b> <b>price</b> ($ 10) at which Aflasafe was to be sold. The mean WTP estimates for Aflasafe for experienced farmers in Kano and Kaduna were statistically the same. However, values of $ 3. 56 and $ 7. 46 were offered in Kano and Kaduna states, respectively, by farmers who had never applied Aflasafe (inexperienced farmers), and the difference here was significant (P < 0. 01). Regression results indicate that contact with extension agents (P < 0. 01) and access to credit (P < 0. 05) positively and significantly influenced the probability that a farmer {{would be willing to pay}} more for Aflasafe than the <b>threshold</b> <b>price.</b> Lack of awareness of the importance of Aflasafe was the major reason cited by inexperienced farmers (64 % in Kano state and 21 % in Kaduna state) for not using the product. A market strategy promoting a premium price for aflatoxin-safe produce and creating awareness and explaining the availability of Aflasafe to potential users should increase Aflasafe usage.
