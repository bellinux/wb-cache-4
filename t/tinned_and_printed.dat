30|$|Transparent sodium {{silicate}} glass, manufactured in a {{float glass process}} on liquid <b>tin</b> <b>and</b> with local <b>prints</b> of ceramic frit was evaluated. Three different surfaces of the glasses were studied, the tin side that during the manufacturing process was {{in contact with the}} tin bath, the fire side that was exposed to the atmosphere and a ceramic frit surface printed on the fire side. Three different automotive glasses were studied {{in the first part of}} the project and the results were then verified on a demonstrator. The first two glasses were a reference glass and a similar from another batch manufactured in Europe of Belgian sand. The third glass was a similar glass but manufactured in China from local sand. In the final part a demonstrator glass was used, a European windscreen similar to the reference. The glasses were provided by Sekurit Saint Gobain (Herzogenrath, Germany). All sides of glass were initially evaluated, but the <b>tin</b> <b>and</b> ceramic side where the most difficult to bond to and are therefore the focus here.|$|R
50|$|Capacitive sensors are {{constructed}} {{from many different}} media, such as copper, Indium <b>tin</b> oxide (ITO) <b>and</b> <b>printed</b> ink. Copper capacitive sensors can be implemented on standard FR4 PCBs {{as well as on}} flexible material. ITO allows the capacitive sensor to be up to 90% transparent (for one layer solutions, such as touch phone screens). Size and spacing of the capacitive sensor are both very important to the sensor's performance. In addition {{to the size of the}} sensor, and its spacing relative to the ground plane, the type of ground plane used is very important. Since the parasitic capacitance of the sensor is related to the electric field's (e-field) path to ground, it is important to choose a ground plane that limits the concentration of e-field lines with no conductive object present.|$|R

Polyptych is a collection of four printed circuit boards where the design is distributed across multiple boards. The work explores electronic components, not only for functionality, but also their visual qualities, where components are laid out in graphical patterns. Circuit board production processes of coloured protective lacquers, copper traces, <b>tin</b> coatings <b>and</b> screen <b>prints</b> also inform the design.

40|$|This work {{is focused}} on {{studying}} thermal pretreatment and leaching of copper <b>and</b> <b>tin</b> from <b>printed</b> circuit boards (PCBs) from used consumer equipment. Thermal treatment experiments were realized with and without presence of oxygen at 300 °C, 500 °C, 700 °C and 900 °C for 30 minutes. Leaching experiments were performed at 80 °C in 2 M HCl in two stages. The first stage consisted of classic leaching experiments of samples without and after thermal treatment. The second stage consisted of oxidative leaching experiments (blowing of air or oxygen) with the aim to intensify metals leaching. The results of thermal treatment experiments show that maximal mass loss after burning (combustion) was 53 % (700 °C) and after pyrolysis 47 % (900 %). Oxidative leaching resulted in complete dissolution of copper <b>and</b> <b>tin</b> after 60. or 90 minutes of thermally treated samples. Pyrolysis and combustion have positive effects on metals dissolution in comparison with samples without thermal pretreatment. Moreover, the dissolution of metals is more effective and needs shorter leaching time...|$|R
