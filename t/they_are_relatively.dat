5|$|Screening for aneurysms is not {{performed}} on a population level; because <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>relatively</b> rare, {{it would not}} be cost-effective. If someone has two or more first-degree relatives who have had an aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage, screening may be worthwhile.|$|E
5|$|Being highly {{arboreal}} and {{the most}} frugivorous of the lemurs, they thrive only in primary forest with large fruiting trees, where they {{spend most of their}} time in the upper canopy. By spending the majority of their time in the crown of tall forest trees, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>relatively</b> safe from predators such as the fossa.|$|E

50|$|There is {{very little}} {{documentation}} regarding the opening and closing ceremonies of the 1976 Winter Paralympics in Örnsköldsvik {{aside from the fact}} that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>relatively</b> small/simple by today's standards.|$|R
5|$|M. spinosissima {{thrive in}} well-drained soils that are sandy or loam, with a pH ranging from acidic to neutral. They prefer low {{humidity}} and full, filtered sun. Plants are typically watered {{once every two}} or three weeks, and kept nearly dry during the winter months. They require no pruning and make good patio and container plants. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>relatively</b> disease resistant, but susceptible to pests such as mealworms. Synonyms of M. spinosissima include Mammillaria centraliplumosa, Mammillaria haasii, and Mammillaria virginis.|$|E
5|$|Macroolithus is an oogenus (fossil-egg genus) of dinosaur egg {{belonging}} to the oofamily Elongatoolithidae. The type oospecies, M. rugustus, was originally described under the now-defunct oogenus name Oolithes. Three other oospecies are known: M. yaotunensis, M. mutabilis, and M. lashuyuanensis. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>relatively</b> large, elongated eggs with a two-layered eggshell. Their nests consist of large, concentric rings of paired eggs. There is evidence of blue-green pigmentation in its shell, which may have helped camouflage the nests.|$|E
5|$|<b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>relatively</b> {{abundant}} {{from the}} poles to the equator and {{are found in}} all the oceans. They inhabit the Mediterranean Sea, but not the Black Sea, while {{their presence in the}} Red Sea is uncertain. The shallow entrances to both the Black Sea and the Red Sea may account for their absence. The Black Sea's lower layers are also anoxic and contain high concentrations of sulphur compounds such as hydrogen sulphide. First ever sighting in Pakistan was made in 2017. First ever record on west coast of Korean Peninsula (Yellow Sea) was made in 2005. followed by one on Ganghwa Island in 2009.|$|E
50|$|Though <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>relatively</b> common {{until the}} early 20th century, Celtic pigs had nearly {{disappeared}} by 1980s. The breed is recovering and {{there are now more}} than 2 500 purebred sows.|$|R

50|$|Eudromaeosauria ("true dromaeosaurs") is a {{subgroup}} of terrestrial dromaeosaurid theropod dinosaurs. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>relatively</b> large-bodied, feathered hypercarnivores (with diets consisting {{almost entirely of}} other terrestrial vertebrates) that flourished in the Cretaceous Period.|$|R
5|$|Easter Island has {{the richest}} {{assortment}} of petroglyphs in Polynesia. Nearly every suitable surface has been carved, including {{the stone walls}} of some houses {{and a few of}} the famous mo‘ai statues and their fallen topknots. Around one thousand sites with over four thousand glyphs have been catalogued, some in bas- or sunken-relief, and some painted red and white. Designs include a concentration of chimeric bird-man figures at Orongo, a ceremonial center of the tangata manu ("bird-man") cult; faces of the creation deity Makemake; marine animals like turtles, tuna, swordfish, sharks, whales, dolphins, crabs, and octopi (some with human faces); roosters; canoes, and over five hundred komari (vulvas). Petroglyphs are often accompanied by carved divots ("cupules") in the rock. Changing traditions are preserved in bas-relief birdmen, which were carved over simpler outline forms and in turn carved over with komari. Although the petroglyphs cannot be directly dated, some are partially obscured by pre-colonial stone buildings, suggesting <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>relatively</b> old.|$|E
5|$|Giant planets can {{significantly}} influence terrestrial planet formation. The presence of giants tends to increase eccentricities and inclinations (see Kozai mechanism) of planetesimals and embryos in the terrestrial planet region (inside 4AU in the Solar System). If giant planets form too early, they can slow or prevent inner planet accretion. If they form {{near the end}} of the oligarchic stage, as is thought to have happened in the Solar System, they will influence the merges of planetary embryos, making them more violent. As a result, the number of terrestrial planets will decrease and they will be more massive. In addition, the size of the system will shrink, because terrestrial planets will form closer to the central star. The influence of giant planets in the Solar System, particularly that of Jupiter, is thought to have been limited because <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>relatively</b> remote from the terrestrial planets.|$|E
5|$|Pelicans {{are very}} large birds with very long bills characterised by a downcurved hook {{at the end}} of the upper mandible, and the {{attachment}} of a huge gular pouch to the lower. The slender rami of the lower bill and the flexible tongue muscles form the pouch into a basket for catching fish and, sometimes, rainwater, though in order not to hinder the swallowing of large fish, the tongue itself is tiny. They have a long neck and short stout legs with large, fully webbed feet. Although they are among the heaviest of flying birds, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>relatively</b> light for their apparent bulk because of air pockets in the skeleton and beneath the skin enabling them to float high in the water. The tail is short and square. The wings are long and broad, suitably shaped for soaring and gliding flight, and have the unusually large number of 30 to 35 secondary flight feathers.|$|E
50|$|April 10, 2000The mai announces a new listing category, “Section 2: Hi-Growth Enterprises”, {{to broaden}} the {{fund-raising}} opportunities for firms that had high growth potential even though <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>relatively</b> small, {{such as those in}} the technology industry.|$|R
50|$|It was {{the weakest}} and poorest {{branch of the}} Mughal military. The Empire did {{maintain}} warships, however <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>relatively</b> small.

50|$|The North British Type 1 (later {{known as}} Class 16) was {{a type of}} diesel {{locomotive}} ordered under British Railways' 1955 Modernisation Plan. Like other Type 1 designs, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>relatively</b> small locomotives intended primarily for local freight traffic.|$|R
5|$|Species are broadly {{categorized}} as autotrophs (or primary producers), heterotrophs (or consumers), and Detritivores (or decomposers). Autotrophs are organisms that {{produce their own}} food (production is greater than respiration) by photosynthesis or chemosynthesis. Heterotrophs are organisms that must feed on others for nourishment and energy (respiration exceeds production). Heterotrophs can be further sub-divided into different functional groups, including primary consumers (strict herbivores), secondary consumers (carnivorous predators that feed exclusively on herbivores), and tertiary consumers (predators that feed on a mix of herbivores and predators). Omnivores do not fit neatly into a functional category because they eat both plant and animal tissues. It {{has been suggested that}} omnivores have a greater functional influence as predators, because compared to herbivores, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>relatively</b> inefficient at grazing.|$|E
5|$|The white-bellied sea eagle {{is listed}} as being of Least Concern by the IUCN. There are an {{estimated}} 10 thousand to 100 thousand individuals, although {{there seems to be}} a decline in numbers. They have become rare in Thailand and some other parts of southeast Asia. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>relatively</b> abundant in Hong Kong, where the population increased from 39 to 57 birds between 2002 and 2009. A field study on Kangaroo Island in South Australia showed that nesting pairs in areas of high human disturbance (as defined by clearing of landscape and high human activity) had lower breeding success rates. In the Eyre Peninsula in South Australia, nests have been vacated as human activities have encroached on the eagles' territories. Elsewhere, the clearing of trees suitable for nesting has seen it largely disappear locally, such as the removal of stands of Casuarina equisetifolia in Visakhapatnam district in Andhra Pradesh in India. In India, nest densities of about one per 4.32km of coastline have been noted in Sindhudurg and one per 3.57km (45 nests along 161km) in Ratnagiri district of Maharashtra. They also nest on Netrani Island, where about a 100 birds were noted in 1875 (then known as Pigeon Island) by Allan Octavian Hume who noted that this was perhaps the largest breeding colony of the species. In 2000, the disturbance to the island from torpedo-firing exercises conducted by the Indian navy was noted as a threat. Nearly 100 nests have been noted in 2004 on this island.|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{essential}} role of digits in describing numbers, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>relatively</b> unimportant to modern mathematics. Nevertheless, {{there are a}} few important mathematical concepts that make use of the representation of a number as a sequence of digits.|$|E
50|$|Hughes-Hallett {{was born}} in December 1901, to a {{distinguished}} armed services family. His father was Colonel Wyndham Hughes-Hallett, his mother Clementina Mary Loch (25-Mar-1869 - 8-Dec-1948). <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>relatively</b> old at 56 and 31 years old, respectively, {{at the time of}} his birth.|$|R
50|$|Oh Well were a British dance {{group that}} started in the late 1980s. Their protagonist was the German record producer, Ackim Faulker. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>relatively</b> {{successful}} during their peak in 1989, but broke up soon after, {{due to lack of}} further chart success.|$|R
50|$|When {{his first}} wife died in 1642, the {{inventory}} made showed <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>relatively</b> prosperous. De Jode remarried in 1648 to Clara van den Enden, the sister or daughter of the publisher Martinus van den Enden. His second wife died around 1653.|$|R
25|$|As {{many cities}} {{contemplate}} new transit projects, PCC-based streetcar lines are an attractive option as <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>relatively</b> low cost and {{can serve as}} a tourist attraction in and of themselves, especially on routes through historic city centers.|$|E
25|$|People with WPW who are {{experiencing}} tachydysrhythmias may require synchronized electrical cardioversion {{if they are}} demonstrating severe signs or symptoms (for example, low blood pressure or lethargy with altered mental status).

50|$|In Russia, the 2-8-0 wheel {{arrangement}} {{was represented by}} the prerevolutionary Sch (Shuka-pike) class. These two-cylinder compound locomotives without superheaters were declared the standard Russian freight locomotive in 1912, but since <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>relatively</b> low-powered, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> only useful on easier lines without steep gradients such as the Saint Petersburg-Moscow route.|$|R
50|$|Fruupp were a 1970s {{progressive}} rock band, which {{originated in}} Belfast, Northern Ireland, but developed a fan base in Britain. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>relatively</b> popular, {{particularly on the}} student scene and as a supporting act, opening for such bands as Genesis, Queen, and King Crimson.|$|R
25|$|Though atheists {{are in the}} {{minority}} in most countries, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>relatively</b> common in Europe, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, East Asia and present communist states. It {{is difficult to determine}} actual atheist numbers. Furthermore, the conflation of terms such as atheist, agnostic, non-religious and non-theist add to confusion among poll data.|$|E
25|$|Axial {{compressors}} {{can have}} high efficiencies; around 90% polytropic at their design conditions. However, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>relatively</b> expensive, requiring {{a large number}} of components, tight tolerances and high quality materials. Axial-flow compressors are used in medium to large gas turbine engines, natural gas pumping stations, and some chemical plants.|$|E
25|$|Solid wire {{consists}} of one strand of copper metal wire, bare or {{surrounded by an}} insulator. Single-strand copper conductors are typically used as magnet wire in motors and transformers. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>relatively</b> rigid, do not bend easily, and are typically installed in permanent, infrequently handled, and low flex applications.|$|E
50|$|As {{early as}} the late Qing dynasty, many vendors were already selling beef slices served cold {{in the streets of}} Chengdu, using beef offal because <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>relatively</b> inexpensive.
