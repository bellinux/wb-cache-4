With <b>the</b> <b>merging</b> traffic data from a work zone site in Singapore, a mixed probit model is developed to describe <b>the</b> <b>merging</b> behavior, and two surrogate safety measures including the time to collision (TTC) and deceleration rate to avoid the crash (DRAC) are adopted to compute the rear-end crash risk between <b>the</b> <b>merging</b> vehicle and its neighboring vehicles. Results show that <b>the</b> <b>merging</b> vehicle has a bigger probability of completing a merging maneuver quickly under one of the following situations: (i) <b>the</b> <b>merging</b> vehicle moves relatively fast; (ii) <b>the</b> <b>merging</b> lead vehicle is a heavy vehicle; and (iii) there is a sizable gap in the adjacent through lane. Results indicate that the rear-end crash risk does not monotonically increase as <b>the</b> <b>merging</b> vehicle speed increases. <b>The</b> <b>merging</b> vehicle's rear-end crash risk is also affected by the vehicle type. There is a biggest increment of rear-end crash risk if <b>the</b> <b>merging</b> lead vehicle belongs to a heavy vehicle. Although the reduced remaining distance to work zone could urge <b>the</b> <b>merging</b> vehicle to complete a merging maneuver quickly, it might lead to an increased rear-end crash risk. Interestingly, it is found that the rear-end crash risk could be generally increased over the elapsed time after <b>the</b> <b>merging</b> maneuver being triggered. No Full Tex...|$|R

40|$|A {{fast and}} robust ellipse-detection method based on sorted merging is {{proposed}} in this paper. This method first represents the edge bitmap approximately {{with a set}} of line segments and then gradually <b>merges</b> <b>the</b> line segments into elliptical arcs and ellipses. To achieve high accuracy, a sorted merging strategy is proposed: <b>the</b> <b>merging</b> degrees of line segments/elliptical arcs are estimated, and line segments/elliptical arcs are merged in descending order of <b>the</b> <b>merging</b> degrees, which significantly improves <b>the</b> <b>merging</b> accuracy. During <b>the</b> <b>merging</b> process, multiple properties of ellipses are utilized to filter line segment/elliptical arc pairs, making the method very efficient. In addition, an ellipse-fitting method is proposed that restricts the maximum ratio of the semimajor axis and the semiminor axis, further improving <b>the</b> <b>merging</b> accuracy. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method is robust to outliers, noise, and partial occlusion and is fast enough for real-time applications...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a theoretical ratification of efficiency of internal capital markets. The efficiency of internal capital market is {{examined in the}} context of horizontal mergers. In Cournot oligopoly, merged firms often optimally select the multidivisional structure in which competition among <b>the</b> <b>merging</b> partners remains in production while the headquarters establishes strong central control over resource allocation to the divisions. Under this structure, mergers not only combine <b>the</b> <b>merging</b> partners' capital, but also provide <b>the</b> <b>merged</b> firm with a new opportunity to reallocate that capital in an efficient way. Horizontal mergers are profitable due to the efficiency of internal capital markets. Such horizontal mergers also enhance market competition.

The cases when two knowledgebases need to be merged completely into a monolithic result, however, are relatively rare.
