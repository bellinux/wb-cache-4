5|$|Although the {{full-size}} mock-up inspection in April 1949 {{was generally}} favorable, range again became a concern since the J40s and early model J57s had excessive fuel consumption. Despite talk of another revision of specifications {{or even a}} full design competition among aircraft manufacturers, General LeMay, {{now in charge of}} Strategic Air Command, insisted <b>that</b> <b>performance</b> should not be compromised due to delays in engine development. In a final attempt to increase range, Boeing created the larger 464-67, stating that once in production, the range could be further increased in subsequent modifications. Following several direct interventions by LeMay, Boeing was awarded a production contract for thirteen B-52As and seventeen detachable reconnaissance pods on 14 February 1951. The last major design change—also at General LeMay's insistence—was a switch from the B-47 style tandem seating to a more conventional side-by-side cockpit, which increased the effectiveness of the copilot and reduced crew fatigue. Both XB-52 prototypes featured the original tandem seating arrangement with a framed bubble-type canopy.|$|E

5|$|An era {{came to an}} end in 1668 {{with two}} events: Davenant died suddenly, leaving a messy {{ownership}} situation for the Duke's Company, and Pepys' eyesight forced him to stop keeping a diary. Thomas Betterton, though formally a minority shareholder, continued to run the Duke's Company, and, in the spirit of Davenant, commissioned the most elaborate of the Restoration playhouses, the theatre at Dorset Garden (or Dorset Gardens), with a flat for himself on top. Although the Dorset Garden Theatre quickly became a famous and glamorous venue, very little is concretely known about the building and outfitting of it: a vague and undocumented tradition ascribes its design to Christopher Wren. The absence of Pepys' record means <b>that</b> <b>performance</b> data for the next decades are only patchily known.|$|E
5|$|Bach first {{performed}} the cantata on 12 August 1714.

He made revisions for <b>that</b> <b>performance,</b> such as transposing it from C minor to D minor and changing the obbligato viola to violoncello piccolo. In the same service, he also performed a new work, : one before and one after the sermon.|$|E
5|$|Before Glöckner's 2003 {{article on}} the origin of the Magnificat, and for some authors still after that, it was {{generally}} assumed that Bach had composed his Magnificat in the quiet time of Advent 1723 for a first performance at the Christmas vespers. For <b>that</b> <b>performance</b> Bach composed four laudes, songs of praise partly in German, partly in Latin to be inserted at certain points in the E-flat major version of the Magnificat. The E-flat major version of the Magnificat including these interpolations is known as BWV 243a.|$|E

He's always played very stereotyped parts in pictures but is one of the best actors I've ever known. I have such respect for him.

5|$|Thanks to his {{performance}} during the game, Air Force quarterback Chance Harridge became just the fifth player in Air Force {{history and the}} 16th player in NCAA Division I-A history to rush for 1,000yards and pass for 1,000yards in the same season. Despite <b>that</b> <b>performance,</b> Virginia Tech quarterback Bryan Randall was named the game's most valuable player for his winning effort. Randall finished the game having completed 18 of his 23passes for 177yards. Harridge completed four of his 19 passes for 91yards and twointerceptions. After completing a pass on the second play of the game, Harridge did not complete another pass until there were {{less than five minutes}} remaining in the game, throwing 11consecutive incomplete passes in the intervening period.|$|E

5|$|The two teams' {{defenses}} {{also performed}} statistically well during the game. Cincinnati's Terrill Byrd led all defenders by recording 11 tackles during the game. Included in that total were four tackles for loss, including one sack. <b>That</b> <b>performance</b> {{was his best}} in terms of quantity during the season, and his four tackles for loss moved him into sixth place on Cincinnati's list of career tackles for loss leaders. For the Hokies, Dorian Porch had eight tackles, leading all Tech players. Cody Grimm, Orion Martin, Stephan Virgil, and Kam Chancellor each recorded one interception. The four interceptions were a Tech bowl-game record, and Chancellor's catch gave him six for the season, tying him with Victor Harris for the most on the team. It {{was the first time}} since 1968 that two Virginia Tech players had six interceptions apiece. Cincinnati's sole interception came at the hands of Brandon Underwood, who tallied his third of the season.|$|E
5|$|To {{improve his}} {{academic}} profile, Moore planned to attend American Christian School in Aston, Pennsylvania, {{but a new}} NCAA rule was instituted that limited the number of core classes able to be taken at a prep school. Lacking the required number of credits to receive an athletic scholarship, he enrolled at Temple as a non-scholarship student and sat out his freshman year as a redshirt. In his freshman debut the following year, he scored 11points against East Tennessee State. Moore followed <b>that</b> <b>performance</b> up with a double-double of 11points and 10rebounds versus the College of Charleston, and a season-high 13points in a loss to Clemson. As a freshman, Moore averaged 4.5points and 2.3rebounds per game in 13.2minutes of playing time.

Following <b>that</b> <b>performance,</b> {{opponent}} head coach, Finnur Freyr Stefánsson, acknowledged Bonneau {{as one of the}} best players to ever play in the league. Bonneau led the Úrvalsdeild in scoring, averaging 36.9 points per game, also averaging 7.0 rebounds, 5.1 assists and 2.5 steals per game, in 11 games. On 17 June 2015, Bonneau signed a new annual contract with UMF Njarðvík; the contract would make Bonneau the highest paid player of UMF Njarðvík ever. Gunnar Örlygsson, the team's chairman, compared Bonneau with Lionel Messi in terms of impact on the club. During a pre-season training in September he suffered an achilles tendon rupture. Bonneau stayed in Iceland for rehabilitation, with an intent to join the team in the play-offs. In his first game back from the injury, Bonneau again thore his achilles tendon, this time on his right foot. In October 2016, Bonneau signed a two-month contract with Njarðvík. At the end of the contract Njarðvík decided not renew it, citing their desire to acquire a bigger player.|$|E
