5|$|The {{timing of}} Frederick's death and <b>the</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> reign are {{important}} topics among historians. The premature demise of Frederick III {{is considered a}} potential turning point in German history; {{and whether or not}} he would have made the Empire more liberal if he had lived longer is still discussed.|$|E

5|$|Ellis {{started the}} 1967 season with Columbus. He {{believed}} {{that he was not}} on the major league club because the Pirates already had a number of African American players; he felt that the team did not want to alienate white fans. Ellis was sent down to the Macon Peaches of the Southern League, which Ellis believed was due to <b>the</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> hair. Ellis said that he was promoted back to Columbus after shaving his head. He had a 2–0 win-loss record with Macon and a 5–7 record with Columbus.|$|E
5|$|Secretariat's {{absence of}} major {{conformation}} flaws was important, as horses with well made limbs and feet {{are less likely}} to become injured. Secretariat's hindquarters were the main source of his power, with a sloped croup that extended <b>the</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> femur. When in full stride, his hind legs were able to reach far under himself, increasing his drive. His ample girth, long back and well-made neck all contributed to his heart-lung efficiency.|$|E
5|$|Although much {{is known}} of Little's {{investment}} activities in his adult life, {{little is known about}} his early years. Jacob Little was born in Newburyport, Massachusetts on March 17, 1794. The son of a successful local shipbuilder and of Quaker origin, Little exhibited a strong understanding of money and financial markets from an early age. In 1817 he emigrated to New York City and became a clerk in the store of Jacob Barker, a highly successful financier, merchant, and politically well-connected founding member of the Democratic Party political machine Tammany Hall. Little spent five years in apprenticeship under Barker before moving out in 1822 to start his own business with $700 he had accrued over <b>the</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> employment. He bought a small office {{in the basement of a}} Wall Street building, which served as his base of operations for the next twelve years, before moving out of his old office to a new one in the basement of the old exchange building in 1834, from which he opened a brokerage—the start of his investment career.|$|E

5|$|Gervase of Canterbury wrote {{at the end}} of {{the twelfth}} century that Ceolnoth was Dean of the see of Canterbury {{previous}} to being elected to the archiepiscopal see of Canterbury, but this story has no confirmation in contemporary records. There is no sign of him being associated with either Canterbury or Kent, the region where Canterbury is located, prior to his elevation as archbishop. Given <b>the</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> archiepiscopate, he was probably a young man when he was elected to Canterbury. Ceolnoth was consecrated archbishop on 27 July 833. Upon becoming archbishop, Ceolnoth had to deal with two problems– first the Viking attacks on his archbishopric and the surrounding lands in Kent and second the newly ascendant kings of Wessex who had just gained control of Kent. Previously, the Mercian kings had ruled Kent.|$|E
5|$|Stuart William Morgan, a 36-year-old {{lorry driver}} from Poole, Dorset, {{was arrested in}} February 1996 after a {{colleague}} recognised his image from a photofit. Morgan was later charged with Figard's murder, and convicted in October. Detectives concluded that after raping, strangling and bludgeoning her, he carried her body in his vehicle for ten days over the Christmas period before dumping it. Morgan was given a life sentence, with a recommendation to serve at least twenty years. An appeal in February 1998 {{was rejected by the}} Court of Appeal, and in 2009 the High Court turned down his application for a review of <b>the</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> sentence. He became eligible for parole in February 2016, and has continued to maintain his innocence.|$|E
5|$|To date, 42 {{individuals}} {{have served as}} mayor. There have been 43 mayoralties due to Charles James Brenham's serving two non-consecutive terms: he is counted chronologically as both the second and fourth mayor. The longest term was that of James Rolph, who served over 18 years until his resignation to become the California governor. <b>The</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> tenure as mayor was largely due to his popularity. During his term, San Francisco saw the expansion of its transit system, {{the construction of the}} Civic Center and the hosting of the World's Fair. The shortest term was that of Charles Boxton, who served only eight days before resigning from office. Two mayors have died in office: Otis died from illness and Moscone was assassinated. Dianne Feinstein is the only woman, Willie Brown is the only African American, and Ed Lee is the only Asian American to have served as mayor.|$|E

25|$|Urged by a {{publisher}} at Ballantine Books to double <b>the</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> story {{to make a}} novel, Bradbury returned to the same typing room and expanded his work into Fahrenheit 451, again taking just nine days. The completed book was published by Ballantine in 1953.|$|E

25|$|Due to <b>the</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> {{supply lines}} {{and to a}} lack of {{reinforcements}} Curtis needed for a further advance, he decided to remain in position and fortified an excellent defensive line {{on the north side of}} the creek, placing artillery for an expected Confederate assault from the south.|$|E
25|$|Selim {{was one of}} the Empire's most {{successful}} and respected rulers, being energetic and hardworking. During his short eight years of ruling, he accomplished momentous success. Despite <b>the</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> reign, many historians agree that Selim prepared the Ottoman Empire to reach its zenith under the reign of his son and successor, Suleiman the Magnificent.|$|E
25|$|On June 4, 2005, Master Yin Shun {{died after}} {{fighting}} pulmonary tuberculosis since 1954. He died in Tzu-Chi hospital in Hualien {{at the age}} of 100. In Taiwan, many were stunned to hear of his death, even though his death was expected in the coming months. Tzu-Chi, along with other Buddhist organizations and monasteries influenced by Yin Shun, joined in mourning for eight days, <b>the</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> funeral.|$|E
50|$|Stephen DiRado (born 1957) is an American photographer. His work {{is mostly}} black-and-white, {{and he makes}} {{frequent}} use of large-format cameras.

25|$|As {{with female}} prostitutes, fees varied considerably. Athenaeus (VI, 241) {{mentions}} {{a boy who}} offers his favours for one obolus; again, the mediocrity of this price calls it into some doubt. Straton of Sardis, a writer of epigrams in the 2nd century, recalls a transaction for five drachma (Palatine anthology, XII, 239). A letter of pseudo-Aeschines (VII, 3) estimates the earnings of one Melanopous at 3,000 drachma; probably through <b>the</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> career.|$|E
25|$|Cranfield first {{played for}} Somerset in 1897, and took five wickets on his debut. Somerset hoped {{that he would}} be able to replace Ted Tyler, whose career was {{effectively}} ended in 1900 when he was repeatedly no balled for throwing. At his prime, Cranfield was capable of bowling with significant curve, sufficient to allow him to place almost all of his fielders on the leg side. However, he lacked consistency, particularly regarding <b>the</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> bowling.|$|E
25|$|Despite <b>the</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> career, {{there are}} some {{defining}} characteristics, {{such as the use}} of different registers, the literary references to several writers, and the use of a variety of themes in order to reach moral conclusions. His lyrics frequently have a metaphysical tone and existential motifs, and are often centered around portrayals of people and events. Guccini's voice is baritonal, with a noticeable rhotacism. Most of his songs, especially early in his career, are folk rock.|$|E
25|$|Amenhotep III has the {{distinction}} of having the most surviving statues of any Egyptian pharaoh, with over 250 <b>of</b> <b>his</b> statues having been discovered and identified.

50|$|After {{finishing}} his season in Sweden he {{was permitted to}} leave the club without fulfilling <b>the</b> full <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> contract, and he returned home to Carolina, taking up {{a place on the}} roster <b>of</b> <b>his</b> first club, Carolina Dynamo, in the USL Premier Development League.|$|R
50|$|In 1931, Lantz faced {{economic}} difficulties {{and was forced}} to make cutbacks, shortening <b>the</b> <b>lengths</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> films and post-synchronizing a handful of the early Disney Oswalds. Another way out of the hole was to gain attention by creating a secondary series of shorts featuring a new star, Pooch the Pup. Lantz and Nolan would now divide the studio into two separate units. Lantz would direct the Pooch cartoons, while Nolan would work on the Oswalds, with both series referencing the dire straits of the Depression. However Pooch never became very popular and the series was dropped in 1933. The following year, Nolan left the studio and the Cartune Classics series of Technicolor shorts began, lasting for a year.|$|R
