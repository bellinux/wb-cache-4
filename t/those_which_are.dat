5|$|Living in colonies {{results in}} {{a high level of}} social {{interaction}} between birds, which has led to a large repertoire of visual, as well as vocal, displays. These behaviours peak early in the breeding period, and colonies particularly quieten when the male macaroni penguins are at sea. Agonistic displays are <b>those</b> <b>which</b> <b>are</b> intended to confront or drive off or, alternatively, appease and avoid conflict with other individuals. Macaroni penguins, particularly those on adjacent nests, may engage in 'bill-jousting'; birds lock bills and wrestle, each trying to unseat the other, as well as batter with flippers and peck or strike its opponent's nape. Submissive displays include the 'slender walk', where birds move through the colony with feathers flattened, flippers moved {{to the front of the}} body, and head and neck hunched, and general hunching of head and neck when incubating or standing at the nest.|$|E

25|$|The {{ultimate}} goal of the Abhidharma is Nirvana and hence the Abhidharmikas systematized dharmas into <b>those</b> <b>which</b> <b>are</b> skillful (kusala), purify the mind and lead to liberation, and <b>those</b> <b>which</b> <b>are</b> unskillful and do not. The Abhidharma then has a soteriological purpose, first and foremost and its goal is to support Buddhist practice and meditation. By carefully watching the coming and going of dhammas, {{and being able to}} identify which ones are wholesome and to be cultivated, and which ones are unwholesome and to be abandoned, the Buddhist meditator makes use of the Abhidharma as a schema to liberate his mind and realize that all experiences are impermanent, not-self, unsatisfactory and therefore not to be clung to.|$|E

25|$|Deaths from αMT {{are rare}} {{but as a}} {{powerful}} monoamine releaser, injury can occur when excessive doses are taken or when taken with drugs such as MAOIs. Most fatalities are not verified but <b>those</b> <b>which</b> <b>are</b> involve excessive doses or coingestion with other drugs. A British teenager died after consuming 1 g of αMT in August 2013.|$|E
25|$|Affine holonomy {{groups are}} the groups arising as holonomies of torsion-free affine connections; <b>those</b> <b>which</b> <b>are</b> not Riemannian or pseudo-Riemannian holonomy groups are {{also known as}} non-metric holonomy groups. The deRham {{decomposition}} theorem {{does not apply to}} affine holonomy groups, so a complete classification is out of reach. However, it is still natural to classify irreducible affine holonomies.|$|E
25|$|This program iterates {{through all}} {{possible}} programs (by iterating through all possible strings and only considering <b>those</b> <b>which</b> <b>are</b> valid programs), {{starting with the}} shortest.

The models used to approximate bubble dynamics are varied, and range from <b>those</b> <b>which</b> <b>are</b> not much more complex that the dissolved phase models, to those which require considerably greater computational power.|$|E

25|$|The {{life cycle}} {{of only a few}} species has been studied in any detail, mainly <b>those</b> <b>which</b> <b>are</b> pests of commercially grown mushrooms.

25|$|Another {{approach}} to Quine's objection to analyticity and synonymy {{emerges from the}} modal notion of logical possibility. A traditional Wittgensteinian view of meaning held that each meaningful sentence {{was associated with a}} region in the space of possible worlds. Quine finds the notion of such a space problematic, arguing that there is no distinction between those truths which are universally and confidently believed and <b>those</b> <b>which</b> <b>are</b> necessarily true.|$|E
25|$|Spinoza’s second {{knowledge}} involves reasoning plus emotions. He {{explains that}} this knowledge is had by the rationality of any adequate causes {{that have to}} do with anything common to the human mind. An example of this could be anything that is classified as being of imperfect virtue. Imperfect virtues are seen as <b>those</b> <b>which</b> <b>are</b> incomplete. Many philosophers, such as Thomas Aquinas and Aristotle, would compare imperfect virtue to pagan virtue.|$|E
25|$|Between 60,000 and 70,000 {{families}} inhabit 93 irregular {{settlements in}} Tlahuac. While {{some of the}} irregular settlements are in conservation areas, most are in areas in which the topography {{does not allow for}} the provision of urban services such as water. Although basic services extend to over 80-90 percent of the population, communities in the periphery and <b>those</b> <b>which</b> <b>are</b> new and not yet consolidated tend to suffer a lack of basic services along with transportation and roads.|$|E

Any amendments or revision to the constitution, merging, creation and abolition of local government units and autonomous regions and the like are validated via plebiscites. In order for a referendum and plebiscite to pass, the votes in favor must be greater in number than <b>those</b> <b>which</b> <b>are</b> opposed; there is no requirement for how high the voter turnout should be in such referendums or plebiscites.|$|E
25|$|The Tewahedo Church Biblical Canon {{contains}} 81 books, including {{almost all}} of <b>those</b> <b>which</b> <b>are</b> accepted by other Orthodox and Oriental Christians; the exception is the Books of the Maccabees, {{at least some of}} which are accepted in the Eastern Orthodox and other Oriential Orthodox churches, but not in the Tewahedo churches (the books of Meqabyan, which are accepted instead, have an etymologically connected name, but rather different content). The Eritrean Orthodox canon and the Ethiopian Orthodox canon are identical.|$|E
25|$|In {{the final}} years of the 20th century and {{earliest}} of the 21st, the appearance of the Green Man proliferated in children's literature. Examples of such novels in which the Green Man is a central character are Bel Mooney's 1997 works The Green Man and Joining the Rainbow, Jane Gardam's 1998 The Green Man, and Geraldine McCaughrean's 1998 The Stones are Hatching. Within many of these depictions, the Green Man figure absorbs and supplants a variety of other wild men and gods, in particular <b>those</b> <b>which</b> <b>are</b> associated with a seasonal death and rebirth.|$|E
