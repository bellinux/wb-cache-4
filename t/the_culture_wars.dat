Groening explained that South Park [...] "made a name for itself as rude, crude, vulgar, offensive, and potentially dangerous". Its critics {{argued that the}} Stan, Kyle, Cartman and Kenny were poor role models for children while its supporters celebrated the show's defense of free speech.|$|E

500|$|Part of a {{reaction}} to <b>the</b> <b>culture</b> <b>wars</b> of the 1980s and 1990s in the United States, South Park is deliberately offensive. Much of the show's humor, and of [...] "Cartman Gets an Anal Probe", arises from the juxtaposition of the seeming innocence of childhood and the violent, crude behavior exhibited by the main characters. The episode also exemplifies the carnivalesque, which includes humor, bodily excess, linguistic games that challenge official discourse, and the inversion of social structures.|$|E

500|$|Nixon had Agnew {{deliver a}} series of speeches attacking their {{political}} opponents. In New Orleans on October 19, Agnew blamed liberal elites for condoning violence by demonstrators, [...] "a spirit of national masochism prevails, encouraged by an effete corps of impudent snobs who characterize themselves as intellectuals". The following day, in Jackson, Mississippi, Agnew told a Republican dinner, [...] "for too long the South has been the punching bag for those who characterize themselves as liberal intellectuals... their course is a course that will ultimately weaken and erode the very fiber of America." [...] Agnew, though he denied Republicans had a Southern Strategy, stressed that the administration and Southern whites had much in common, including the disapproval of the elites. Levy argued that such remarks were designed to attract Southern whites to the Republican Party to help secure the re-election of Nixon and Agnew in 1972, and that Agnew's rhetoric [...] "could have served as the blueprint for <b>the</b> <b>culture</b> <b>wars</b> of the next twenty-to-thirty years, including the claim that Democrats were soft on crime, unpatriotic, and favored flag burning rather than flag waving". The attendees at the speeches were enthusiastic, but other Republicans, especially from the cities, complained to the Republican National Committee that Agnew's attacks were overbroad.|$|E

40|$|Despite {{much talk}} of a <b>culture</b> <b>war,</b> {{scholars}} continue to argue over whether the American public is divided on cultural and social issues. Some {{of the most prominent}} work in this area, such as Fiorina's <b>Culture</b> <b>War?,</b> has rejected <b>the</b> idea. However, this work has in turn been criticized for focussing only on the distribution of attitudes within the American public and ignoring the possibility that <b>the</b> <b>culture</b> <b>war</b> may also be driven by the increasing strength with which sections of the population hold their opinions. This paper tests the strength, or saliency, hypothesis using individual-level over-time data and nonlinear regression. It finds (1) that there was a steady and significant increase in concern about traditional moral issues between the early 1980 s and 2000, but (2) that the over-time increase was driven by an upward and equal shift in the importance attached to traditional moral issues by Republicans and Democrats, conservatives and liberals, evangelicals and non-evangelicals, and frequent and infrequent worshippers alike. While the first finding offers support for the saliency hypothesis and <b>the</b> <b>culture</b> <b>war</b> thesis, <b>the</b> second challenges the idea that Americans are engaged in a <b>war</b> over <b>culture.</b> Both findings enhance but also complicate our theoretical understanding of <b>the</b> <b>culture</b> <b>war,</b> and have important real-world consequences for American politics...|$|R

[...] In front of Dickson, two men dance to the music. In the final seconds, a fourth man briefly crosses from left to right behind the horn. The running time of the restored film is seventeen seconds; the accompanying cylinder contains approximately two minutes of sound, including twenty-three seconds of violin music, encompassing the film's soundtrack. After its restoration in 2000, The Dickson Experimental Sound Film was selected for inclusion in the United States National Film Registry.|$|E
