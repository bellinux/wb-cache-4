West Germany's constitution stipulated that regulation of culture and media was a compentency of the federal states (Bundesländer). The station began broadcasting from Eschborn near Frankfurt am Main on 1 April 1963, with a speech by the first director general (Intendant), Dr. Karl Holzamer. The channel broadcast its first programme in colour in 1967. In 1974, ZDF moved its base of operations to Mainz-Lerchenberg, after briefly being located in Wiesbaden. From 5 October 1996 ZDF broadcasts 24 hours a day. In 1960, the German postal service began constructing a <b>transmitter</b> <b>chain</b> for a second television network. This new network was to be broadcast on the UHF spectrum which required new reception equipment. For older receivers, a converter was sold for about 80 DM (about $20 in 1961 dollars ($ today)). As with the earlier ARD television network, the location of the transmitters was carefully planned to ensure the entire country would be able to receive the programming. To test the transmitters and encourage the public to purchase UHF receivers, the federal government allowed the ARD network to create a temporary secondary channel, ARD 2, which was broadcast daily from 8 to 10 p.m. ARD 2 began broadcasting on 1 May 1961 in the transmission area of Hessischer Rundfunk and a month later expanded nationwide.|$|E

30|$|In this contribution, {{we first}} present {{the design of}} a {{reconfigurable}} transceiver architecture, based on a flexible SDR approach. This efficient and responsive platform design is suitable for cognitive radio physical layer solutions for opportunistic networks. The architecture of our transceiver is characterized by a modular and transparent software structure composed of highly interoperable software blocks. Accordingly, the latter can be adopted to create flexible and easily configurable transmit/receive chains. As a result, the proposed transceiver is able to quickly switch between transmission schemes (acOFDM, CIA or a mix of both) as required, hence the ‘reconfigurable’ denomination. As a second step, we make use of this new reconfigurable solution to take one step towards a full implementation of CIA. In particular, we aim at providing a proof-of-concept; thus, we focus on a point-to-point cognitive radio channel as in [3]. We note that, differently from the aforementioned state-of-the-art contributions, herein, the necessary perfect synchronization of both primary and secondary signals at the primary receiver is achieved by means of a simplified strategy, based on a hybrid transceiver design. In practice, both primary and secondary <b>transmitter</b> <b>chains</b> are implemented in the same hardware, transforming the 2 × 2 model studied in [3] into a hybrid 1 × 2 one. Furthermore, the CSI required by the devices to perform their operations, i.e., precoding at the transmitter and decoding at the receivers, is not obtained through CSI sharing between the devices, as typically done in the literature. Instead, it is acquired independently by each interested device by means of channel estimations.|$|R
