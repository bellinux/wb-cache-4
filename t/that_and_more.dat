Articulate, persuasive and energetic, he had mastered the issues under debate and was confident he could lead {{the others in the}} administration, including the President. Recognizing there was a difference of opinion with Jackson over the Bank, he sought to work out a plan with the bank president, Nicholas Biddle, to provide for the upcoming renewal of the bank’s charter in return for the accomplishment of a key objective of the President, the retirement of the national debt. On December 7, 1831 he proposed a sweeping plan to accomplish <b>that</b> <b>and</b> <b>more.</b> Acclaimed for its Hamiltonian creativity, McLane had taken the initiative on the administration’s agenda, and was acting very much in the role of a Prime Minister. With enough time he was certain Jackson would soften his position and consent to the approach.|$|E

At {{the beginning of her}} career, she was often described by the press as having a vivacious personality and a bubbly, outgoing persona, an image she had confessed to disliking. According to film critic Sukanya Verma, Zinta's energetic nature extends from her real life into her appearances in films and {{is an integral part of}} her technique. In an article discussing Hindi film actresses and their flair for comedy, Verma wrote, [...] "What can you say about an actress who giggles non-stop in a tone that is anything but prim and propah? She is carefree. She is animated. She talks non-stop. She laughs all the time. She has a chilled out sense of humour. And a tomboyish streak too.

On April 3, 2009 Entertainment Weekly reported that Jackie Earle Haley was cast to take over Englund's most well-known role. Initially, the studio wanted to cast an unknown {{for the role of}} Freddy Krueger, but it was Haley's performance in Little Children that impressed Emmerich enough to cast the actor against the original intentions. Emmerich explained, [...] "Freddy is this incredible stew of malevolence and anger, but he also has a hint of vulnerability, and Jackie really has all of <b>that</b> <b>and</b> <b>more.</b> He just seemed completely right for the part."

Gregg Shapiro from the Windy City Times complimented the remix, writing [...] "the presence of each improves on the original.

Promis gave the C+C remix two and a half out of five stars, writing how the remix found Carey [...] "getting quite gritty and earthy." [...] He concluded his review with [...] "It made for a topnotch dancefloor number, and stands as an excellent example of early- to mid-'90s dance music, not to mention being one of the singer's most compelling, underrated, and forgotten efforts." ...|$|E

Eric Henderson of Slant Magazine wrote that Beyoncé comes off like [...] "barely sentient" [...] but added that she remains cohesive and rational as a human being in real life. He further wrote: [...] "Her reserve of crazy is far from bottomless, and she seems to save it all for her music videos, and I love her for that [...] awesome in distressingly fragmented ways." [...] Gina Serpe of E! Online wrote that [...] "for anyone still laboring under the illusion that Beyoncé does not mean business, well, just watch this video. Described by B herself as 'futuristic', 'electronic' and 'African', the 29-year-old fused all <b>that</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> into a still remarkably cohesive music video." [...] CBS News wrote the [...] "smoking hot video [...] blowing up on the web". The Huffington Post wrote that Beyoncé largely brings back the elements that made [...] "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)"'s video a hit, citing women's empowerment and a brand new dance. Jarett Wieselman of the New York Post complimented Beyoncé's wardrobe and dancing in the video, and wrote that the choreography ensures the lyrics, [...] "my persuasion can build a nation".|$|E
