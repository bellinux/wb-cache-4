Through molecular dynamics simulation, we show that the <b>torsional</b> <b>effect</b> has a crucial effect on the chain wrapping around the core under the topological constraints. In particular, the torsional stress (i) induces the wrapping/unwrapping transition, and (ii) leads to a unique complex structure with an antagonistic wrapping direction which never appears without the topological constraints.

This type of joint is interesting, because it allows to obtain an higher joint stiffness, a more uniform stress distribution and a better aesthetical appearance in comparison with traditional mechanical connections.

40|$|The {{in-cylinder}} {{pressure is}} an important signal that gives information about the combustion process. To further improve engine performance, this information {{can be used as}} a feedback signal in a control system. Usually a pressure sensor is mounted in the cylinder to extract this information. A drawback with pressure sensors is that they are expensive and have issues with aging. This master’s thesis investigates the possibility to create a virtual sensor to estimate in-cylinder pressure based on crank angle degree sensor (CAD-sensor) data and physical models of the heavy-duty engine. Instead of using the standard mounted CAD-sensor an optical high-precision sensor measures the elapsed time between equidistant angles. Based on this signal the instantaneous angular acceleration was estimated. Together with the inertia of the crankshaft, connecting rods and pistons, an estimation of the engine torque was calculated. To be able to extract in-cylinder pressure from the estimated torque, knowledge about how the in-cylinder pressure signal propagates in the drivetrain to accelerate the flywheel needs to be known. Two engine models based on the torque balance on the crankshaft are presented. The fundamental difference between them is how the crankshaft is modeled, rigid body or spring-mass-damper system. The latter captures <b>torsional</b> <b>effects</b> of the crankshaft. Comparisons between the estimated torque from sensor data and the two engine models are presented. It is found that <b>torsional</b> <b>effects</b> of the crankshaft is present at normal engine speeds and has a significant influence on the flywheel torque. A separation of the gas torque contribution from one cylinder is done with CAD-sensor data together with the rigid body engine model. The in-cylinder pressure is then estimated by using the inverse crank-slider function and a Kalman filter estimator. The estimated pressure captures part of the compression and most of the expansion at engine speeds below 1200 RPM. Due to the crank-slider geometry the pressure signal disappears at TDC. The <b>torsional</b> <b>effects</b> perturb the estimated pressure during the gas exchange cycle. Further development must be made if this method is to be used on heavy-duty applications in the future...|$|R

30|$|U-shaped {{thin-walled}} {{reinforced concrete}} (RC) bridge beams {{have been widely}} used in urban construction of rail viaducts in China, such as in Shanghai Subway Line 6 and Guangzhou Subway Line 2, due to the advantage of lower construction elevations, the excellent sound proof effect and attractive appearance (He 2003). Under normal service conditions, this type of member is typically subjected to the combined action of bending, shear and torsion due to eccentric traffic load (especially in multilane cases and curved structure cases) and transverse wind load. However, according to the authors’ knowledge, no research about the mechanical response of such U-shaped thin-walled RC members under combined actions has been reported in literature. The existing studies about the U-shaped thin-walled RC bridge beams are mainly concentrated on bending and shear. In China, the additional <b>torsional</b> <b>effect</b> is indirectly considered by improving the safety reserve in bending and shear design, which is unreasonable and uneconomical. Thus, the mechanical response of the U-shaped thin-walled RC beams under the combined action of bending, shear and torsion should be studied to lay the foundation {{for the development of a}} rational design provision.|$|E

Objective assessment of ocular torsion was performed by retinography immediately before and one month after surgery.

In 3 D analysis, four structures were simulated, with and without rigid diaphragms so as to compare the seismic behaviour of the buildings. Through this nonlinear analysis parameters were determined that define the behaviour of the structure, torsional moments and rotations in columns reached for simulated buildings.

40|$|Recent trends towards {{constructing}} taller {{buildings with}} irregular geometric shapes imply that these structures are potentially {{more responsive to}} wind excitation. The wind-induced motion of modern tall buildings is generally found to involve with significant coupled lateral and <b>torsional</b> <b>effects,</b> which are attributed to the asymmetric three-dimensional (3 D) mode shapes of these buildings. The 3 D coupled modes also complicate the use of high frequency force balance (HFFB) technique in wind tunnel testing for predicting the wind-induced loads and effects on tall buildings. This paper firstly presents the analysis of equivalent static wind loads (ESWLs) on tall buildings with 3 D modes provided that the wind tunnel derived aerodynamic wind load spectra are given. Then an integrated wind load updating analysis and optimal stiffness design technique is developed for lateral drift design of tall asymmetric buildings involving coupled lateral-torsional motions. The results of a practical 40 -storey building example with significant swaying and <b>torsional</b> <b>effects</b> are presented. Not only is the technique able to produce the most cost efficient element stiffness distribution of the structure satisfying multiple serviceability wind drift design criteria, but a potential benefit of reducing the wind-induced loads can also be achieved by the stiffness design optimization method.

40|$|Abstract: Frame {{structure}} on a slope {{is a common}} kind of structure in a mountainous area. It can diminish the impact on environment, by avoiding to dug or fill the slope, using an opening platform, supported by beams and columns. Because the frame {{structure on}} a slope connects with the ground on different elevation level, it is evidently different from general frame structure in seismic design. Four sets of frame structure example on a slope sample are designed, with three opening floors connected with the ground on different elevation level, and three, six, nine, twelve upper floors correspondingly. The seismic responses characteristics of frames on a slope are studied in the paper from period, lateral deformation, seismic shear and so on, based on {{the analysis of the}} characteristics of frame structure on a slope. The main conclusions are as follows: the slope can enhance structural lateral stiffness to a certain extent; the opening floors connected with the ground on different elevation level, are not necessarily frail stories; the distribution of seismic force is uneven between the columns in the same floors which connect with the ground on different elevation level, and fixed columns undertake more than others, making them more fragile; the <b>torsional</b> <b>effect</b> is noticeable in the frame structure on a slope...|$|E
40|$|Base {{isolation}} {{has become}} a widely accepted method for earthquake resistant design of structures. However, the {{research in the field}} has been generally restricted to one-dimensional motion. Structural response is not limited to this one-dimensional motion, and the <b>torsional</b> <b>effect</b> of multidimensional motion contributes to the horizontal displacements. A three-dimensional structure can not be modeled with multiple one-dimensional analyses; rather, a complete three-dimensional analysis must be undertaken, as shown in this study. Four separate analyses for the calculation of the dynamic response of a base-isolated structure will be presented in this study. The first two analysis procedures are for a single-story base-isolated structure. The last two procedures are for a multi-story base-isolated structure. The first procedure for each structure assumes a fully linear response, in which the bearings and the superstructure remain in the linear elastic range of response. The second procedure allows for a non-linear response from the bearings, in which each individual bearing may yield, changing the effective stiffness value. The structural response for each of these cases will be calculated using computer analysis and compared with one another and also with a single-degree of freedom system.

Heuristically, the pile positions are decided at locations such as/either: a corner; an intersection; endways of footing layout and/or under columns of the house.

Material savings, cost effectiveness, weight reduction, Strength {{and aesthetics}} of steel structures {{are some of}} the key factors to be considered in structural design. In the last decade, non-prismatic steel members have proved to be more effective in structural design than the prismatic members, i. e. they have higher load carrying capacity when their geometry closely resemble the bending moment envelope as compared to prismatic members with the same material properties, loading and boundary conditions. However, there is a unique point (degree of non-uniformity) for which every non-prismatic member loses its load carrying capacity due to a change in its failure position and mechanism. Therefore, in order to investigate the effect of geometrical non-uniformity on steel members, non-prismatic steel members with different steel sections were simulated using ADINA/M 8. 4. 2 version whose function is based on finite element method. Furthermore, the non-prismatic steel members were modeled under different geometrical arrangements, degree of non-uniformity, boundary and loading conditions. Deflections, stress distributions, <b>torsional</b> <b>effect</b> and critical buckling load were recorded.

We divided the Tn 3 resolvase reaction into two stages, synapsis USA and postsynapsis. We found the contributions of supercoiling to each stage were distinct, since substrate catenation in the absence of supercoiling or low levels of substrate supercoiling were sufficient for synapsis but not postsynapsis. Using structural and functional topological analyses, we verified that the resolvase synaptic complexes with nicked catenanes were recombination intermediates. The requirement for supercoiling was even less stringent for the gd resolvase, which recombined nicked catenanes about half as well as it did supercoiled substrates. Gin recombination of catenanes occurred even if the recombinational enhancer was on a nicked ring, as long as both crossover sites were on a supercoiled ring. Therefore, supercoiling is required at the Gin crossover sites but not at the enhancer. We conclude that solely conformational effects of supercoiling are required for resolvase synapsis and the function of the Gin enhancer, but that a <b>torsional</b> <b>effect,</b> probably double helix unwinding, is needed for Tn 3 resolvase postsynapsis and at the Gin recombination sites...|$|E

This finding can add to the existing radiological criteria in diagnosis of otosclerosis. Objective The objective {{of this study is}} to establish the obliquity of stapes in otosclerosis by radiological measurements using HRCT temporal bone by comparing: (a) the distance between the horizontal (tympanic) segment of facial nerve and stapes head in otosclerotic ears (study group) with non-otosclerotic ears (control group); and (b) the angle subtended by stapes with promontory in the study and control groups. Methods This is a prospective study performed after the institutional Ethics Committee clearance (IEC 3 / 2013). Results An increased mean distance between the horizontal segment of facial nerve and stapes head in otosclerotic patients (i. e., 2. 49 mm[*]+/−[*] 0. 24 mm SD), when compared with the non-otosclerotic patients (i. e., 1. 46 mm[*]+/−[*] 0. 16 mm SD) is noted. There is a change in angle (i. e., 64. 550 [*]+/−[*] 7. 190 SD) subtended by the stapes toward the promontory in otosclerotic ears when compared with that of controls (i. e., 99. 700 [*]+/−[*] 40 SD). We applied the Mann-Whitney U non-parametric test and considered p value of[*]<[*] 0. 0001 highly significant.

This obliquity explains the <b>torsional</b> <b>effect</b> of otosclerosis on the ossicular chain. The findings correlate with late complications and failures in stapes surgery...|$|E
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this thesis {{is to develop a}} 3 D beam element in order to model wind turbine wings made of {{composite}} materials. The proposed element is partly based on the formulation of the classical beam element of constant cross-section without shear deformation (Euler-Bernoulli) and including Saint-Venant <b>torsional</b> <b>effects</b> for isotropic materials, similarly to the one presented in Batoz & Dhatt (1990, pp. 147 - 190). The main novelty consists in the addition of the coupling between axial and bending with <b>torsional</b> <b>effects</b> that may arise when using composite materials. PreComp, a free access code developed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) to provide structural properties for composite blades, is used to obtain the section properties for the beam element. Its performance is assessed, showing its inaccuracy especially when calculating torsional related constants when webs are present in the cross-section. Shell models of constant cross-section cantilever blades are developed to assess the performance of the beam elements, including or not coupling terms. Natural frequencies and displacements under static loads are compared for different study cases of increasing complexity. For fiber-reinforced materials, elements with coupling terms show good agreement with the shell model, especially for the dynamic problem. Elements without coupling terms are unable to capture the dynamic behavior, as these terms seem to have a higher effect on the results when compared to the static case (especially the FT term). ...|$|R
