25|$|Margaret Duley (1894–1968) {{was arguably}} Newfoundland's first novelist {{to gain an}} {{international}} audience. Amongst her works are The Eyes of the Gull (1936), Cold Pastoral (1939} and Highway to Valour (1941). Subsequent important novelists include Harold Horwood, who wrote <b>Tomorrow</b> <b>Will</b> <b>Be</b> Sunday (1966) and White Eskimo (1972), and Percy Janes, author of House of Hate (1970).|$|E

Playwrights across Canada began writing, and this {{explosion}} was also felt in Newfoundland and Labrador. Subregional festivals saw Newfoundland plays compete - Wreakers by Cassie Brown, <b>Tomorrow</b> <b>Will</b> <b>Be</b> Sunday by Tom Cahill, and Holdin' Ground by Ted Russell. Cahill's play went on to receive top honours and a performance at Expo 67 in Montreal. [...] Joining Brown and Cahill in the seventies were Michael Cook and Al Pittman, both prolific writers".|$|E
2500|$|The machine {{releases}} all of {{the lawn}} gnomes and they erupt onto the beach. The beach goers flee in panic of [...] "gnomeageddon" [...] and the beach is destroyed. Candace does not realize this as {{she is trying to}} convince her mother not to come in and ruin her good time, so when she tries to justify the beach's existence, she finds nothing but their normal backyard. Candace is depressed, but the boys find the day to be a successful one. Candace is helped inside by Isabella and Linda. At the end, the DJ from the beginning congratulates Phineas and Ferb and also says that <b>tomorrow</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> hot and sunny too, but then Ferb adds [...] "with a slight chance of scattered lawn gnomes", to which Phineas (and probably a lot of viewers) laughs. Then there is a zoom-out and the gnomes that crashed into the Flynn-Fletcher household roof are seen.|$|E

2500|$|Political infighting with career Ford executives, notably Lee Iacocca, {{led to his}} {{dismissal}} from Ford on September 11, 1969. Reportedly, Henry Ford II sent Ford's {{vice president}} for public relations, Ted Mecke, to Knudsen's home the previous night to inform {{him that he would}} be fired, telling Knudsen that [...] "Henry sent me here to tell you that <b>tomorrow</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> a rough day at work." [...] When Ford made the decision official the next day, Bunkie said [...] "I'm shocked" [...] to which Ford replied, [...] "I imagine you would be." [...] Noted for his laconic replies to difficult questions, Mr. Ford told the media [...] "Things just didn't work out", but later reports indicated many career Ford executives allied themselves with Iacocca and were working against Knudsen. His dismissal led to a widely circulated witticism in Ford circles as the hallmark phrase of Henry Ford I, [...] "History is bunk", was turned around to [...] "Bunkie is history".|$|E

6000|$|THE CAPTAIN. Incorrigible! (Urgently) Listen to me. The men in that {{audience}} <b>tomorrow</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> the vilest of voluptuaries: men in whom the only passion excited by {{a beautiful woman}} is a lust to see her tortured and torn shrieking limb from limb. It is a crime to dignify that passion. It is offering yourself for violation by the whole rabble of the streets and the riff-raff of the court at the same time.

60|$|Here the {{listener}} who {{was none other}} than the Scotch student, a little fume of a fellow, blond as tow, congratulated in the liveliest fashion with the young gentleman and, interrupting the narrative at a salient point, having desired his visavis with a polite beck to have the obligingness to pass him a flagon of cordial waters at the same time by a questioning poise of the head (a whole century of polite breeding had not achieved so nice a gesture) to which was united an equivalent but contrary balance of the bottle asked the narrator as plainly as was ever done in words if he might treat him with a cup of it. Mais bien sûr, noble stranger, said he cheerily, et mille compliments. That you may and very opportunely. There wanted nothing but this cup to crown my felicity. But, gracious heaven, was I left with but a crust in my wallet and a cupful of water from the well, my God, I would accept of them and find it in my heart to kneel down upon the ground and give thanks to the powers above for the happiness vouchsafed me by the Giver of good things. With these words he approached the goblet to his lips, took a complacent draught of the cordial, slicked his hair and, opening his bosom, out popped a locket that hung from a silk riband, that very picture which he had cherished ever since her hand had wrote therein. Gazing upon those features with a world of tenderness, Ah, Monsieur, he said, had you but beheld her as I did with these eyes at that affecting instant with her dainty tucker and her new coquette cap (a gift for her feastday as she told me prettily) in such an artless disorder, of so melting a tenderness, 'pon my conscience, even you, Monsieur, had been impelled by generous nature to deliver yourself wholly into the hands of such an enemy or to quit the field for ever. I declare, I was never so touched in all my life. God, I thank thee, as the Author of my days! Thrice happy will he be whom so amiable a creature will bless with her favours. A sigh of affection gave eloquence to these words and, having replaced the locket in his bosom, he wiped his eye and sighed again. Beneficent Disseminator of blessings to all Thy creatures, how great and universal must be that sweetest of Thy tyrannies which can hold in thrall the free and the bond, the simple swain and the polished coxcomb, the lover in the heyday of reckless passion and the husband of maturer years. But indeed, sir, I wander from the point. How mingled and imperfect are all our sublunary joys. Maledicity! he exclaimed in anguish. Would to God that foresight had but remembered me to take my cloak along! I could weep to think of it. Then, though it had poured seven showers, we were neither of us a penny the worse. But beshrew me, he cried, clapping hand to his forehead, <b>tomorrow</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> a new day and, thousand thunders, I know of a marchand de capotes, Monsieur Poyntz, from whom I can have for a livre as snug a cloak of the French fashion as ever kept a lady from wetting. Tut, tut! cries Le Fecondateur, tripping in, my friend Monsieur Moore, that most accomplished traveller (I have just cracked a half bottle AVEC LUI in a circle of the best wits of the town), is my authority that in Cape Horn, ventre biche, they have a rain that will wet through any, even the stoutest cloak. A drenching of that violence, he tells me, sans blague, has sent more than one luckless fellow in good earnest posthaste to another world. Pooh! A livre! cries Monsieur Lynch. The clumsy things are dear at a sou. One umbrella, were it no bigger than a fairy mushroom, is worth ten such stopgaps. No woman of any wit would wear one. My dear Kitty told me today that she would dance in a deluge before ever she would starve in such an ark of salvation for, as she reminded me (blushing piquantly and whispering in my ear though there was none to snap her words but giddy butterflies), dame Nature, by the divine blessing, has implanted it in our hearts and it has become a household word that il y a deux choses for which the innocence of our original garb, in other circumstances a breach of the proprieties, is the fittest, nay, the only garment. The first, said she (and here my pretty philosopher, as I handed her to her tilbury, to fix my attention, gently tipped with her tongue the outer chamber of my ear), the first is a bath... But at this point a bell tinkling in the hall cut short a discourse which promised so bravely for the enrichment of our store of knowledge.|$|E
