40|$|Abstract—This paper {{describes}} a new method for the automated segmentation and extraction of cardiac MRI <b>tagging</b> <b>lines.</b> Our method {{is based on}} the novel use of a 2 D Gabor filter bank. By convolving the tagged input image with our Gabor filters, the <b>tagging</b> <b>lines</b> are automatically enhanced and segmented out. We design the Gabor filter bank based on the input image’s spatial and frequency characteristics. The final result is a combination of each filter’s response in the Gabor filter bank. We demonstrate that compared to bandpass filter methods such as HARP, this method results in robust and accurate segmentation of the <b>tagging</b> <b>lines.</b> Keywords—Gabor filter bank, <b>tagging</b> <b>line</b> segmentation, <b>tagged</b> MRI images I...|$|R

2500|$|During the pre-code period, {{after the}} {{crack down on}} crime films, {{production}} of films featuring prurient elements increased. Studios began putting in extra suggestive material which they knew would never reach theaters.
