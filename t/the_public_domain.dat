5|$|Finally, Universal's conduct {{amounted}} to {{an abuse of}} judicial process, {{and in that sense}} caused a longer harm to the public as a whole. Depending on the commercial results, Universal alternatively argued to the courts, first, that King Kong was a part of <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>domain,</b> and then second, that King Kong was not part of <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>domain,</b> and that Universal possessed exclusive trademark rights in it. Universal's assertions in court were based not on any good faith belief in their truth, but on the mistaken belief that it could use the courts to turn a profit.|$|E

5|$|Because Corman did {{not believe}} that The Little Shop of Horrors had much {{financial}} prospect after its initial theatrical run, he did not bother to copyright it, resulting in the film falling into <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>domain.</b> Because of this, the film is widely available in copies of varying quality. The film was originally screened theatrically in the widescreen aspect ratio of 1.85:1, but has largely only been seen in open matte at an aspect ratio of 1.33:1 since its original theatrical release.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s {{four of the}} Universal-produced films {{fell into}} <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>domain</b> when their {{copyright}} was not renewed. These four films were restored and colourised.

The UCLA Film and Television Archive restored the series, putting the films onto modern polyester film, in a process that was jointly paid for by UCLA, Warner Bros. and Hugh Hefner.|$|E

Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) have always {{played an important role in}} <b>the</b> <b>public</b> safety <b>domain.</b> <b>The</b> capability of exchanging information (e. g., voice or data) is essential to improve <b>the</b> coordination of <b>public</b> safety officers during an emergency crisis.
