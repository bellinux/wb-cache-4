5|$|After {{having been}} {{unconscious}} {{for over a}} week, Makoto awakens in the hospital to find Yukari, who explains their similarity in having both lost parents during the accident in the past. The next day Ikutsuki, Akihiko and Mitsuru recruit Makoto to the Specialized Extracurricular Execution Squad—SEES to help them fight the Shadow creatures responsible for the Apathy Syndrome by preying on humans during the Dark Hour midnight phenomenon. Not long after as Junpei also joins SEES, Akihiko deduces that <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>enough</b> members to begin exploring their school's Dark Hour form, a Shadow-infested labyrinth called Tartarus, where they hope to unearth {{the mystery of the}} Dark Hour. Makoto also befriends Fuka Yamagishi (Mamiko Noto) and learns of her strained relationship with class bully, Natsuki Moriyama (Yuka Komatsu).|$|E
5|$|Migrating birds rely {{largely on}} stored fat {{and they also}} metabolise protein as a {{supplementary}} source of energy. Those with a relatively large amount of fat, may make stops during migration of only 1–2 days; although they have lost weight since commencing their journey, <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>enough</b> energy reserves to reach the wintering areas. The proportion of migrating males increases as they travel south through Europe. There is competition within the species even during migration, and the larger and more aggressive males may get more food. Their death rate is therefore {{lower than that of}} the females both on the southward migration, and in resident populations.|$|E
5|$|Calling {{a correct}} letter earns the value before the {{corresponding}} flipper, {{multiplied by the}} number of times that the letter appears in the puzzle. Calling a correct letter keeps the wheel in the contestant's control, allowing the contestant to spin again, buy a vowel for a flat rate of $250, or attempt to solve the puzzle. Contestants may continue to buy vowels so long as <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>enough</b> money to keep doing so, until all of the vowels in the puzzle have been revealed. Control passes to the next contestant clockwise if the wheel lands on Lose a Turn or Bankrupt, if the contestant calls a letter that is not in the puzzle, calls a letter that has already been called in that round, fails to call a letter within five seconds of the wheel stopping, or attempts unsuccessfully to solve the puzzle. The only exception is the Free Play wedge, on which the contestant may call a consonant for $500 per occurrence, call a free vowel, or solve the puzzle, with no penalty for an incorrect letter or answer.|$|E

5|$|Unlike {{atmospheric}} convection—the ordinary {{process of}} lower, warm air rising—inversions leave cooler air suspended below warm air, preventing the lower air from rising and trapping airborne pollutants that would ordinarily disperse in the atmosphere. Such weather events are common, {{but they are}} usually followed by a strong cold front that brings an influx of clean air and disperses pollutants before <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>enough</b> time to become highly concentrated; in this case, a cold front approaching west through southern Canada was delayed. When explained in less formal terms, the process of an inversion causing a smog event {{has been compared to}} a lid that holds in pollutants or a balloon that fills with pollutants. In general, smog events occur not because of a sudden increase in a region's output of pollution, but rather because weather conditions like stagnant air prevent the dispersal of pollutants that were already present.|$|E
25|$|The team's captain {{declares}} the innings closed, usually {{because they}} believe <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>enough</b> runs. A declaration before the innings starts is called an innings forfeiture.|$|E

25|$|Elves- Elves {{act as the}} {{authority}} in the faerie territory of Spiderwick's Estate. They are shown as humanoid, a group of them living in the forest, making their clothes out of leaves. <b>They</b> <b>have</b> <b>enough</b> knowledge of magic to keep Spiderwick alive for nearly 100 years, they keep Stray Sods around their forest so humans cannot reach it, and they somehow employ Byron to take Spiderwick to his family.|$|E
25|$|John Conroy also {{comments}} that <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>enough</b> men {{working on the}} property already. Kate pleads with her father to give Jim {{a job at the}} property, and he finally relents, saying that Jim can help break the horses. John Conroy resents it when Jim Ryan says that he knows of a better way to break horses than the horse-breaking method being used at the property. However, John Conroy says that Jim could prove his expertise in horse-breaking by breaking the colt from Regret.|$|E
25|$|During the Hellacopters' break, {{the second}} {{compilation}} of non-album tracks Cream Of The Crap Vol. 2 was released.

Eriksson and Lindstrom also did a small DJ tour in Italy before joining up {{with the rest of the}} band to record and release Rock & Roll Is Dead in 2005. The name is a reference to the band's opinion about the state of the music industry.|$|E

25|$|Each {{character}} {{has the ability}} to equip traits earned during the game. Traits give characters a myriad of different bonuses and abilities. Any trait combination can be equipped as long as <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>enough</b> trait slots. The number of free trait slots depends on their level. The first virtue trait slot is available at level 7, for example. Virtue, class and racial traits offer a maximum of five slots, and legendary traits offer three slots. Traits can be easily changed by visiting a bard found in most towns, and equipping traits costs a certain amount of money.|$|E
25|$|This is {{the most}} {{traditional}} version of cricket, with rules most closely replicating the original rules of cricket from the 16th and 17th century. It is a single innings game with a set time limit for the entire game to be completed in. To win the game, a side must both score the highest aggregate number of runs and take all ten of the opposition wickets. It {{is up to the}} side batting first to declare when they feel <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>enough</b> runs to be able to win the match. In this format of cricket, if the side batting second do not lose all ten of their wickets, the match is said to have ended in a draw.|$|E
25|$|The duo's later {{campaigns against}} Arakan (1545–1547) and Siam (1547–1549) however fell short. In both campaigns, Toungoo forces won all major open battles, {{and went on}} to lay siege to the capitals, Mrauk-U and Ayutthaya respectively. But they still had no answer to heavily {{fortified}} defenses equipped with Portuguese firearms, and had to retreat both times. Toungoo's own Portuguese supplied cannon had little impact on the walls of both capitals. Nor did <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>enough</b> manpower (19,000 and 12,000 troops respectively in Arakanese and Siamese campaigns) for long-term sieges. Nonetheless, despite the setbacks, Tabinshwehti and Bayinnaung by 1549 had built up the largest polity in Burma since the fall of Pagan Empire in 1287, stretching from Pagan in the north to Tavoy in the south.|$|E

25|$|When {{the detectives}} are certain {{they have the}} right suspect(s), the police will take the case to their boss, who decides if there is enough for a search and/or arrest warrant (though {{sometimes}} the commanding officer will consult with the New York City District Attorney's office to see if the case is strong enough) and whether or not any backup (such as uniformed officers or an armed tactical team) is needed. The detectives will then arrest the suspects(s), with the police sometimes having to chase the accused through the streets of New York. The scene then shifts to the interrogation room where the detectives interrogate the suspect(s) until they ask for a lawyer, their defense attorney shows up and asks the suspect not to talk anymore, or the Assistant District Attorney from the D.A.'s office decides <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>enough</b> to press charges.|$|E
25|$|In {{an abrupt}} reversal, on May 28, 1975, WHFV {{suddenly}} notified the FCC {{it was out}} of money and would go off the air the next day. The station, having waited as long as it could for FCC approval of the sale, blamed inaction on Release the World's part. The FCC agreed, stating that Release the World had been notified that it failed to submit complete financial information in its application to transfer control. The FCC placed the application on hold and did not take any action while it awaited completed information. (Potential transferees must prove <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>enough</b> cash on hand to acquire the station and run it for one year.) The FCC set an original deadline of May 22 to complete the application, after which it would close and eventually be dismissed. Release the World negotiated an extension to May 29.|$|E
25|$|Following further campaigns by Greenpeace, in 2008, Apple {{became the}} first {{electronics}} manufacturer to fully eliminate all polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and brominated flame retardants (BFRs) in its complete product line. In June 2007, Apple began replacing the cold cathode fluorescent lamp (CCFL) backlit LCD displays in its computers with mercury-free LED-backlit LCD displays and arsenic-free glass, starting with the upgraded MacBook Pro. Apple offers comprehensive and transparent information about the CO2e, emissions, materials, and electrical usage concerning every product they currently produce or have sold in the past (and which <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>enough</b> data needed to produce the report), in their portfolio on their homepage. Allowing consumers to make informed purchasing decisions on the products they offer for sale. In June 2009, Apple's iPhone 3GS was free of PVC, arsenic, and BFRs. All Apple products now have mercury-free LED-backlit LCD displays, arsenic-free glass, and non-PVC cables. All Apple products have EPEAT Gold status and beat the latest Energy Star guidelines in each product's respective regulatory category.|$|E

50|$|The Wänzl rifle was a breechloading {{conversion}} of the M1854 & M1862 Lorenz rifle. The Austro-Hungarian Empire used the Wänzl as their service rifle until <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>enough</b> M1867 Werndl-Holub rifles to arm the military.|$|R
25|$|Slave Cage: Back at the Archers' Den, the Death Machine {{has been}} {{completed}} and the enslaved former citizens of the Empire (including the captured Nursemaid and Valets) toil away in the mines. The Evil Counselor and his son now sense that <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>enough</b> support and admiration amongst the Archers’ forcing them to capture the Chief Archer and assuming command of the Archers' forces. The fiendish Death Machine (Wheel of Death) is powered by slaves running in hamster-wheel cages {{on both ends of}} a long rotating pendulum arm. We recognize the two slaves in the Wheel of Death as former members of the Imperial Court. While operating the machine, the slaves escape out of the cage and brazenly taunt their captives by performing elaborate and dangerous stunts on the moving Death Machine. The enslaved Empire is inspired by the courage of the two slaves and while the Archers are distracted by the events, the Empire rises up and revolts against its captors. The bravery of the two slaves in the Wheel of Death begins to turn the tide in the war. In the conclusion, the Chief Archer’s daughter is able to rescue her father from captivity and the Twins are finally reunited.|$|E
