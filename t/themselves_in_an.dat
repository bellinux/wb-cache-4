5|$|Bats may avoid flying {{during the}} day to prevent {{overheating}} in the sun, since their dark wing-membranes absorb solar radiation. Bats {{may not be able}} to dissipate heat if the ambient temperature is too high. Unlike birds which have air sacs or other mammals which have sweat glands, bats have no means to cool themselves by evaporation, though they may use saliva to cool <b>themselves</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> emergency.|$|E
5|$|In {{the mating}} season, rutting males bellow {{to make their}} {{presence}} known to females. Muskoxen roar during male-male fights, and male saigas force air through their noses, producing a roar to deter rival males and attract females. Mothers also use vocal communication to locate their calves if they get separated. During fights over dominance, males tend to display <b>themselves</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> erect posture with a level muzzle.|$|E
5|$|Legislators found <b>themselves</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> {{unusual and}} uncomfortable situation. Nuclear weapons were terrifying, {{and the nature}} of nuclear energy was not widely understood. Because it was so new, there were no {{policies}} or precedents to guide legislators, and traditional party alignments were absent. The scientists who had developed the new technology had never been vocal before, but suddenly were now. The victorious conclusion of World War II gave the armed forces enormous prestige, but there still remained the long-standing American distrust of standing armies, and the tradition of civilian control of the military.|$|E

As the NIS investigation continued, information about the Navy's focus on the two sailors and innuendoes about their relationship were leaked to the media. The leaks were later said to have come from the NIS and from the Navy's headquarters. Thompson alleges that during its investigation, NIS agents lied or otherwise conducted <b>themselves</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> extremely unprofessional manner.|$|E
5|$|The 3rd Battalion, 34th Infantry {{set up a}} {{defensive}} perimeter north of the city, and by nightfall was engaged in combat with superior numbers of North Korean troops and tanks. American forces, unable to repulse North Korean armor, soon found <b>themselves</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> intense urban fight as columns of North Korean troops, spearheaded by T-34 tanks, entered the town from two directions, cutting off U.S. forces. The fight resulted in the near destruction of the 3rd Battalion, 34th Infantry {{as well as the}} death of the 34th Infantry Regiment's new commander, Colonel Robert R. Martin.|$|E
5|$|The film {{is set in}} the Victorian {{period of}} India's colonial British Raj. The story {{revolves}} around a small village whose inhabitants, burdened by high taxes, find <b>themselves</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> extraordinary situation as an arrogant officer challenges them to a game of cricket as a wager to avoid the taxes. The narrative spins around this situation as the villagers face the arduous task of learning the alien game and playing for a result that will change their village's destiny.|$|E

5|$|Most oil {{pollution}} in the sea comes from cities and industry. Oil is dangerous for marine animals. It can clog the feathers of sea birds, reducing their insulating effect and the birds' buoyancy, or be ingested when they preen <b>themselves</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> attempt to remove the contaminant. Marine mammals are less seriously affected but may be chilled through the removal of their insulation, blinded, dehydrated, or poisoned. Benthic invertebrates are swamped when the oil sinks, fish are poisoned, and the food chain is disrupted. In the short term, oil spills result in wildlife populations being decreased and unbalanced, leisure activities being affected, and the livelihoods of people dependent on the sea being devastated. The marine environment has self-cleansing properties and naturally occurring bacteria will act over time to remove oil from the sea. In the Gulf of Mexico, where oil-eating bacteria are already present, they take {{only a few days}} to consume spilt oil.|$|E
5|$|To have {{a chance}} of winning a competition, two {{consistently}} good jumps must be made. If an athlete finds <b>themselves</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> uncompetitive position after the first round, their challenge in the second round is to make up ground via the attrition of other athletes, their own distance and style points, and wind/gate compensation. For an athlete who had a poor jump in round one, it is possible for them to climb up the order in round two with an excellent jump, and if other competitors fall by the wayside. Conversely, a high-scoring athlete may lose their advantage from round one if their second jump is not up to par.|$|E
5|$|After a posting in Prague {{to assist}} in setting up an {{emigration}} office there, Eichmann was transferred to Berlin in October 1939 to command the Central Office for Jewish Emigration for the entire Reich under Heinrich Müller, head of the Gestapo. He was immediately assigned to organise the deportation of 70,000 to 80,000 Jews from Ostrava district in Moravia and Katowice district in the recently annexed portion of Poland. On his own initiative, Eichmann also laid plans to deport Jews from Vienna. Under the Nisko Plan, Eichmann chose Nisko as the location for a new transit camp where Jews would be temporarily housed before being deported elsewhere. In {{the last week of}} October 1939, 4,700 Jews were sent to the area by train and were essentially left to fend for <b>themselves</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> open meadow with no water and little food. Barracks were planned but never completed. Many of the deportees were driven by the SS into Soviet-occupied territory and others were eventually placed in a nearby labour camp. The operation soon was called off, partly because Hitler decided the required trains were better used for military purposes for the time being. Meanwhile, as part of Hitler's long-range resettlement plans, hundreds of thousands of ethnic Germans were being transported into the annexed territories, and ethnic Poles and Jews were being moved further east, particularly into the General Government.|$|E

5|$|Bill (W. Earl Brown) is a {{survivor}} who lives just outside Boston, {{and is a}} business partner of Joel and Tess. A paranoid, aggressive and distrustful {{man in his late}} forties, Bill lives alone in a heavily fortified town, laden with booby traps that include some captured Infected. During the game, Joel finds Bill in the hope that he will pay off a debt by fixing up a car for them to drive to Tommy's, but Bill insists that the only working car battery is in the unexplored part of town. After fighting their way to the local high school, Bill discovers the battery he was going to use is missing. They escape the swarms of infected surrounding the school, and find <b>themselves</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> abandoned house, where Bill discovers his partner, Frank, has committed suicide by hanging there, and it is revealed that the two had had a falling out and Frank had been planning to escape in Bill's car. After getting the car started, Joel drops Bill off, and expresses sympathy for what happened between him and Frank. Bill merely responds by ensuring that their debt is settled and then ordering Joel to leave the town.|$|E
5|$|The trio {{fight their}} way through Roman′s men, {{reaching}} an underground chamber where Nate believes the statue is buried. Meanwhile, Eddy, consumed by paranoia, warns Roman that an unearthly force has been killing off his men, which the former dismisses as nonsense. Nate investigates the chamber but not before he gets separated from Sully via a booby-trapped secret doorway. Unfortunately, Nate and Elena, after deciding to carry on without Sully, find not the statue but Drake's corpse, with whom he sadly leaves the ring (believing he never found the sarcophagus). A group of zombie-like creatures swarm him and his companions, including Eddy and his bodyguard. In the chaos that follows, Eddy and his man are killed. Nate and Elena press on and find <b>themselves</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> old Nazi submarine base built into the island. Looking for a way out, Nate finds a letter written by Drake exposing the truth: El Dorado is protected by a curse that turned both the Spanish colonists and the German soldiers into monsters. Drake sought to destroy it, but the creatures killed him before he could; a picture reveals that Drake's corpse {{was in front of}} the statue before it was moved by the Germans.|$|E

25|$|Several {{hypotheses}} {{for this}} phenomenon were made, the two noteworthy being the pseudosexual selection hypothesis {{and the male}} avoidance hypothesis. In the pseudosexual hypothesis, male butterflies aggressively approached the male-looking females and then mellowed their behavior into sexual behavior when they were close enough to identify them as females. In the male avoidance hypothesis, female butterflies disguise <b>themselves</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> attempt to evade male harassment, as courtship can be harmful, time consuming, and attract predators.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{earliest}} known associations between the media and suicide arose from Goethe's novel Die Leiden des jungen Werthers (The Sorrows of Young Werther). Soon after its publication in 1774, young men began to mimic the main character by dressing in yellow pants and blue jackets. In the novel, Werther shoots himself with a pistol after he is rejected by the woman he loves, and shortly after its publication {{there were reports of}} young men using the same method to kill <b>themselves</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> act of hopelessness.|$|E

25|$|About 60% {{crystallization}} is {{the upper}} limit for commercial products, {{with the exception of}} polyester fibers. Clear products can be produced by rapidly cooling molten polymer below Tg glass transition temperature to form an amorphous solid. Like glass, amorphous PET forms when its molecules are not given enough time to arrange <b>themselves</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> orderly, crystalline fashion as the melt is cooled. At room temperature the molecules are frozen in place, but, if enough heat energy is put back into them by heating above Tg, they begin to move again, allowing crystals to nucleate and grow. This procedure is known as solid-state crystallization.|$|E

Ranatunga was quickly dismissed as well, but de Silva put up an 82 run stand with Lanka de Silva who made his maiden half century, and scored 114 runs himself. The Sri Lankans were all out for 264 in the last over.|$|E
