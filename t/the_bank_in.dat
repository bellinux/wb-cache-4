5|$|Rudolf Ernst joined <b>the</b> <b>Bank</b> <b>in</b> Winterthur in 1895. He {{was also}} {{financial}} {{director of the}} City of Winterthur for 16 years. At the young age of 36, he was elected in 1901 to the Board of Directors of <b>the</b> <b>Bank</b> <b>in</b> Winterthur and as its chairman at the same time. During his chairmanship, the bank changed its focus from its original lending business and began to expand its issuing and asset management franchise. With the acquisition of <b>the</b> <b>Bank</b> <b>in</b> Baden in 1906, the bank gained a branch in Zurich and {{a seat on the}} stock exchange, one of the cornerstones for the successful merger in 1912 with the Toggenburger Bank to form Union Bank of Switzerland. Rudolf Ernst also held directorships on the boards of various industrial and insurance companies. Between 1912 and his retirement in 1941, he was chairman of the Board of Union Bank of Switzerland, in an alternating capacity with Carl Emil Grob-Halter, who held the chairmanship in 1916 and 1918 as the representative of the merger partner Toggenburger Bank.|$|E

5|$|In some matters Tyler was on {{good terms}} with Jackson. He defended Jackson for vetoing the Maysville Road funding project, which Jackson {{considered}} unconstitutional. He voted to confirm several of the president's appointments, including Jackson's future running mate Martin Van Buren as United States Minister to Britain. The leading issue in the 1832 presidential election was the recharter of the Second Bank of the United States, which both Tyler and Jackson opposed. Congress voted to recharter <b>the</b> <b>bank</b> <b>in</b> July 1832, and Jackson vetoed the bill for both constitutional and practical reasons. Tyler voted to sustain the veto and endorsed the president in his successful bid for re-election.|$|E

5|$|Along the Kanto Plain near Tokyo, Thad wrecked 22houses, damaged 31 bridges, damaged {{roads in}} 145places, and flooded 27rivers. According to police reports, five {{individuals}} drowned and six others were initially reported missing in Suzaka, because of flooding {{from the nearby}} Ayu River that crushed houses along <b>the</b> <b>bank.</b> <b>In</b> Akita, a fishing boat with nine people aboard was capsized by strong winds; all nine were rendered as missing by police. Elsewhere, one person {{was killed by a}} falling tree and a fisherman drowned when his boat overturned. In the Ibaraki Province, just north of Tokyo, officials ordered the evacuation of 5,000dwellings in the city of Ryugasaki, 2,500 of which were flooded. After the nearby Kogai River threatened to overflow their banks, over 1,000families were evacuated. Another 4,000families were evacuated in Fujishiro, though by August25, the majority of the evacuated had returned to their homes. In the island of Hokkaido, air service was suspended; damage was severe in the area. However, the capital city of Tokyo avoided the worst of the storm. In all, Thad was considered the worst storm to strike the nation in two years.|$|E

When Austen Chamberlain, Chancellor of the Exchequer in the continued coalition government led by the Liberal Prime Minister, Lloyd George, tried to recruit him to serve on an additional committee, Neville Chamberlain informed his half-brother that he could only serve if it met between midnight and 7:30am. Chamberlain took time to assure the future of the Birmingham Savings Bank, and Parliament passed an act which removed onerous restrictions from <b>the</b> <b>bank.</b> <b>In</b> March 1920, he was offered a junior post at the Ministry of Health by Bonar Law on behalf of the Prime Minister, but was unwilling to serve under Lloyd George despite Bonar Law's warnings that Chamberlain, now past fifty, might never be offered another chance to serve in government, as Lloyd George was likely to remain premier for a very long time. Chamberlain was offered no further posts during Lloyd George's premiership, and when Bonar Law resigned as party leader, Austen Chamberlain took his place as head of the Unionists in Parliament.|$|E

30|$|Different studies divide <b>banks</b> <b>in</b> {{different}} categories {{on the basis}} of different criteria. Imbierowicz and Rauch (2014) divided <b>the</b> <b>banks</b> <b>in</b> small, medium, and large categories by dividing the total assets of <b>the</b> <b>banks</b> <b>in</b> three quantiles. <b>The</b> first, second, and third quantiles represented small, medium, and large banks, respectively. Chatterjee (2015) also divided <b>the</b> <b>banks</b> <b>in</b> three categories. A bank was considered small if the total assets of <b>the</b> <b>bank</b> were less than $ 1 billion; medium, if the total assets were more than $ 1 billion but less than $ 3 billion; and large, if the total assets were greater than $ 3 billion. Distinguin et al. (2013) also divided <b>banks</b> <b>in</b> small and large categories. They considered a <b>bank</b> small, if <b>the</b> total assets of <b>the</b> <b>bank</b> were less than $ 1 billion, and large otherwise. Following the methodology adopted by Imbierowicz and Rauch (2014), we divided <b>banks</b> <b>in</b> small and large categories by dividing the total assets of <b>the</b> <b>banks</b> <b>in</b> two quantiles. <b>The</b> first quantile represents small <b>banks,</b> and <b>the</b> second quantile represents <b>the</b> large <b>banks.</b> <b>The</b> analysis which we performed for the overall sample was repeated for sub-samples of small as well as large banks. 1 We found that liquidity creation by small or large banks also does not depend on the level of non-performing loans, i.e., we did not find the evidence of a moral hazard problem in small as well as large banks.|$|R

5|$|France even {{linked the}} issue of the seat to the ongoing dispute {{regarding}} the seat of the European Parliament. Frankfurt was criticised as symbolising German dominance, although the Deutsche Bundesbank had effectively been running the Communities currencies for the previous years, while Luxembourg has a banking tradition that wasn't so careful. London was discredited because the UK remained outside the eurozone. It was also seen as important to locate <b>the</b> <b>bank</b> <b>in</b> a city not already hosting a national government or EU institution, in order to emphasise its independence. Others, such as {{the former head of the}} Bundesbank Karl Otto Pöhl, favoured a small country with a stable currency. The advantages of hosting the Bank were also in dispute by some economists. While there was seen by some as little to gain in terms of attracting other banks and financial institutions, others saw it as affecting which cities would be financial hubs in the years to come.|$|E
5|$|In {{recognition}} {{of the fact that}} many people use the towpath to exercise their dogs, dog dips have been installed at Allbrook and Shawford. These provide easy access into the water for dogs, and owners are encouraged to only allow dogs to swim at these locations, to conserve <b>the</b> <b>bank</b> <b>in</b> other places. The water vole surveys have followed the best practice described in the Water Vole Conservation Handbook (2006), and have also recorded evidence of otter, brown rat and American mink populations. While carrying out the work, the surveyors have also counted sightings of kingfisher, heron, moorhen and coot. The bat survey recorded common pipistrelle, soprano pipistrelle, Daubenton's, noctule and serotine bats in 2011. Bat boxes have been erected near Allbrook, and there was some evidence that they were being used. The 2009 fisheries survey recorded large numbers of young Atlantic salmon in the lower river, but although fish weirs have been provided, wild parr were not recorded near Winchester. Above there, a large population of brown trout thrives. Eels were monitored {{for the first time in}} 2009, when their distribution was found to be variable.|$|E
