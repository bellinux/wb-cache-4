This waste contains some 20 % sulphuric acid and 2 % iron. After the passage of the barge that discharges 10 ton of waste min - 1 into its wake, the vertical and horizontal distributions of the pH, iron-concentrations and turbidity were measured as a function of time. It appeared that a few seconds after the discharge and for a very brief period, the pH was down to approx. 4 and the Fe-concentration was 13 mg l - 1. More than 1 min after the discharge a pH below 6 and an iron-level above 3 mg l - 1 could not be detected anywhere. The measured factor for waste dilution by sea water, based on the observed acid and iron concentration in the waste and in the discharge track, were around 5, 000 after 5 min, 9, 000 after 10 min and 80, 000 after 20 min. Before and long after the dumping, the total iron-concentration in this Southern Bight area was around 100 µg l - 1, but this high level might be due to natural causes...|$|E

40|$|For {{quantitative}} {{estimate of}} biogenic {{volatile organic compound}} emissions (BVOCs) in South China {{and their impact on}} the regional atmospheric chemistry, a 3 -day tropical cyclone-related ozone episode was modeled using chemical transport model CMAQ, which was driven by the mesoscale meteorological model MM 5. Hourly biogenic emission inventories were constructed using the Sparse Matrix Operator Kernel Emissions (SMOKE) model. The simulation results show good agreement with observation data in air temperature, ozone and NO x levels. The estimated biogenic emissions of isoprene, terpene, and other reactive VOCs (ORVOCs) during this tropical cyclone-related episode are 8500, 3400, and 11 300 <b>ton</b> <b>day</b> - 1, respectively. The ratio of isoprene to the total BVOCs was 36. 4 %. Two test runs were carried out with one incorporated biogenic emissions and the other without. The simulations show that Guangdong province, particularly the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region, was the area most reactive to biogenic emissions in South China. More ozone was produced in all layers under 1500 m when biogenic emissions were included in comparison to that without BVOCs. The net formation of ozone from 9 : 00 to 15 : 00 h was the highest near the surface and could reach 38 ppb, which include 4 ppb attributed to biogenic impact. The enhanced ozone due to biogenic emissions first appeared in the PRD region and slowly spread to a greater area in South China. Process analysis indicated that the surface ozone budget was dominated by the vertical transport and dry deposition. The horizontal transport and gas-phase chemical production were relatively small in the surface layer. Presumably, ozone was produced in upper layers within the atmospheric boundary layer and convected down to surface where it is destroyed. When BVOCs was included, apart from the enhancement of gas-phase chemical production of ozone, both the surface deposition and vertical transport were also augmented.
