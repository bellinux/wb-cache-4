40|$|<b>Twin</b> <b>wire</b> {{submerged}} {{arc welding}} (SAW) is widely used in the joining of oil or gas pipe lines because of its high productivity. However, when it is applied to join the high strength steel pipe, the heat affected zone (HAZ), especially the coarse grain zone, becomes very brittle. To investigate the strength and toughness of HAZ, thermal cycles in HAZ due to <b>twin</b> <b>wire</b> SAW must be studied. In present studies, theoretical equations of <b>twin</b> <b>wire</b> welding thermal cycles for thick plate, thin plate are developed by authors and the critical thicknesses for both thick plate and thin plate are determined. The welding thermal cycles for intermediate thickness are predicted by linear interpolation using results of both thick plate and thin plate. Through the theoretical equations, thermal cycles of <b>twin</b> <b>wire</b> SAW with actual welding conditions used in pipe line fabrication were predicted and verified by both FEM and experiment. Good agreement among theoretical results, FEM and experimental results was achieved. Furthermore, the microstructures and Vicker’s hardness of HAZ was predicted based on CCT diagram and thermal cycles calculated by the proposed theoretical equations. Predicted microstructures and hardness were compared with the experimental ones. A good agreement was also obtained...|$|R
40|$|The paper treats a weld {{discontinuity}} called lack of fusion, {{which is}} frequently {{a cause of}} leakage of a water heater. The heater was produced by MAG welding using two <b>wires</b> (<b>twin</b> arc welding). The paper states some reasons for the occurrence of lack of fusion, i. e. the arc blow effect, an inappropriate gun position, uncontrolled movement of the weld pool, too low energy input, an improper joint preparation.

40|$|Research in the {{development}} of additive manufacturing process employing direct metal deposition for the fabrication of fully functional parts and tooling has generated significant interest in the recent years. Three-dimensional welding is being investigated as an additive manufacturing technique for the production of real metallic parts using gas metal arc welding (GMAW) principles. The temperature field distribution during weld based rapid prototyping induces complex thermal stress evolutions and plays a big role in residual stress distributions. The present work is to investigate the temperature field and thermal stress distributions in the multi-pass single-layer weld-deposition based additive manufacturing using <b>twin</b> <b>wire</b> welding. A three-dimensional finite element model with the temperature-dependent material properties and moving heat source is modelled for the same. A double ellipsoidal heat source model is applied to calculate the <b>twin</b> <b>wire</b> welding‟s temperature field is used. The filler metal deposition is taken into account by implementing the birth-and-death functionality for the finite elements. The temperature distribution pattern and magnitude is subsequently obtained.

40|$|<b>Twin</b> <b>wire</b> arc {{spraying}} (TWAS) {{was used to}} produce an amorphous crystalline Fe-based coating on AISI 1018 steel substrate using a commercial powder (140 MXC) {{in order to improve}} microhardness and wear properties. The microstructures of coating were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) as well as the powder precursor. Analysis in the coating showed the formation of an amorphous matrix with boron and tungsten carbides randomly dispersed. At high amplifications were identified boron carbides at interface boron carbide/amorphous matrix by TEM. This kind of carbides growth can be attributed to partial crystallization by heterogeneous nucleation. These interfaces have not been reported in the literature by thermal spraying process. The measurements of average microhardness on amorphous matrix and boron carbides were 9. 1 and 23. 85 [*]GPa, respectively. By contrast, the microhardness values of unmelted boron carbide in the amorphous phase were higher than in the substrate, approaching 2. 14 [*]GPa. The relative wear resistance of coating was 5. 6 times that of substrate. These results indicate that the <b>twin</b> <b>wire</b> {{arc spraying}} is a promising technique to prepare amorphous crystalline coatings...|$|R

40|$|RCM is a {{maintenance}} method, {{which comes from}} the airline industry, in the late 1970 's. The method is used to control the maintenance, prevent possible failures and make the maintenance done in an appropriate frequency. To achieve the RCM analysis a RCM team must be created.

Instead must the implementation process be modificated. This thesis work has been performed at Metso Paper, Service Inc., in Sundsvall.

40|$|An {{experimental}} design matrix {{was set up}} in which carbon steel coatings were deposited with a <b>twin</b> <b>wire</b> arc spray gun (TAFA 9000 TM), using either compressed air or nitrogen as spraying gas. The coating’s mechanical properties were studied. Some correlations were made between these properties, spraying conditions and the microstructure of the deposits. Young’s modulus was estimated by the single beam method using finite element modeling. Results show that direct relationships do exist between spray conditions, oxide content in the coating and microhardness. Young’s modulus of the coatings depends on the lamella thickness and the oxide content. When increasing the compressed air flow rate, Young’s modulus increases at first because smaller particles and finer lamellae were made and it decreases later because of a higher oxide content. The increase of nitrogen flow rate lowers the oxide content and increases Young’s modulus...|$|R

The Al 12 Si coating had highest hardness and wear resistance above all coatings.
