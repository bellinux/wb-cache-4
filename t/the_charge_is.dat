5|$|By {{means of}} the sodium-potassium pump, living human cells pump three sodium ions out of the cell in {{exchange}} for two potassium ions pumped in; comparing ion concentrations across the cell membrane, inside to outside, potassium measures about 40:1, and sodium, about 1:10. In nerve cells, the electrical charge across the cell membrane enables transmission of the nerve impulse—an action potential—when <b>the</b> <b>charge</b> <b>is</b> dissipated; sodium {{plays a key role}} in that activity.|$|E

In 1169 he visited Rome, possibly to answer accusations made against him by Archbishop Frederick, although if so, <b>the</b> <b>charge</b> <b>is</b> unknown. It {{is also possible}} that while Frederick was away on a diplomatic mission in Europe, a problem within the diocese forced William to seek the archbishop's assistance.|$|E

50|$|Walker posted {{bond and}} {{returned}} home to Dallas, where he was greeted by a crowd of some two hundred supporters. After {{a federal grand jury}} adjourned in January 1963 without indicting him, <b>the</b> <b>charges</b> <b>were</b> dropped.

5|$|Many of {{the bishops}} in England {{did not want to}} be consecrated by Stigand. Both Giso of Wells and Walter of Hereford {{travelled}} to Rome to be consecrated by the pope in 1061, rather than be consecrated by Stigand. During the brief period that he held a legitimate pallium, however, Stigand did consecrate Aethelric of Selsey and Siward of Rochester. Abbots of monasteries, however, came to Stigand for consecration throughout his time as archbishop. These included not only abbots from monastic houses inside his province, such as Æthelsige as abbot of St Augustine's Abbey in Canterbury, but also Baldwin as Abbot of Bury St. Edmunds and Thurstan as Abbot of Ely. After the Norman Conquest, Stigand was accused of selling the office of abbot, but no abbot was deposed for buying the office, so <b>the</b> <b>charge</b> <b>is</b> suspect.|$|E

Sometimes called the fuse hole or the touch hole. On {{the top of the}} vent {{on the outside of the}} cannon is a flat circular space called the vent field where <b>the</b> <b>charge</b> <b>is</b> lit. If the cannon is bronze, it will often have a vent piece made of copper screwed into the length of the vent.|$|E

25|$|In general, if a {{defendant}} is found incompetent {{to proceed to}} trial, the criminal proceedings are suspended. In those cases, where <b>the</b> <b>charges</b> <b>are</b> petty, <b>the</b> <b>charges</b> <b>are</b> often dropped or a plea bargain may be made in which <b>the</b> <b>charges</b> <b>are</b> nolle prossed if the defendant agrees to seek treatment. Otherwise, the defendant is usually committed to a psychiatric hospital for treatment until the defendant is restored to competency, {{at which point the}} trial will proceed.|$|R
50|$|In 2014, Russia's Investigative Committee charged Ashurkov with {{embezzlement}} {{of funds}} from Alexei Navalny's 2013 mayoral campaign, {{after which he}} applied for political asylum in Great Britain, claiming <b>the</b> <b>charges</b> <b>were</b> politically motivated. Both Ashurkov and Navalny maintain that <b>the</b> <b>charges</b> <b>were</b> baseless.|$|R

Survivors being pummeled are completely helpless and will <b>be</b> killed unless <b>the</b> <b>Charger</b> <b>is</b> killed. <b>The</b> <b>Charger</b> <b>is</b> also unique among the Special Infected in that, due to its hulking size, it cannot be shoved; only frag rounds and explosives can stumble a <b>charger.</b> <b>The</b> <b>charger</b> <b>is</b> also quite lethal in its standard melee attack while not charging.|$|R
50|$|In 1690, {{following}} the Glorious Revolution the Church of Scotland permanently switched to Presbyterian Government. The incumbent {{minister of the}} Parish of Dundee, Henry Scrymgeour demitted office in 1690 and <b>the</b> <b>charge</b> <b>was</b> declared vacant in 1694. <b>The</b> <b>charge</b> <b>was</b> not filled until 1699.|$|R

25|$|Physically, an {{accelerating}} charge emits radiation (according to the Larmor formula), {{which carries}} momentum {{away from the}} charge. Since momentum is conserved, <b>the</b> <b>charge</b> <b>is</b> pushed in the direction opposite {{the direction of the}} emitted radiation. In fact the formula above for radiation force can be derived from the Larmor formula, as shown below.|$|E
25|$|The coal used in {{the next}} step must be low in {{nitrogen}} to avoid the formation of cyanide. The calcium carbonate, {{in the form of}} limestone or chalk, should be low in magnesia and silica. The weight ratio of <b>the</b> <b>charge</b> <b>is</b> 2:2:1 of salt cake, calcium carbonate, and carbon respectively. It is fired in a reverberatory furnace at about 1000°C.|$|E
50|$|In January 2010, the MCSA laid {{undisclosed}} internal {{charges against}} Verryn, {{and after a}} hearing he was suspended on 19 January 2010. The fact that <b>the</b> <b>charges</b> <b>were</b> initially undisclosed did nothing to quell the rumours that {{the real reason for}} <b>the</b> <b>charges</b> <b>was</b> that there was substance to the accusations which had been made. A statement was later released that the basis for <b>the</b> <b>charges</b> had <b>been</b> that Verryn had exceeded his authority.|$|R
5000|$|On October 22, 2007, the Holy Land Foundation trial {{ended in}} a mistrial. CAIR stated {{that the reason for}} the mistrial, and no {{convictions}} on any of <b>the</b> <b>charges,</b> <b>was</b> that <b>the</b> <b>charges</b> <b>were</b> built on [...] "fear, not facts." [...] All defendants were convicted upon retrial in 2008.|$|R

I now reduced them still lower, that I might rarefy further, and for this purpose in the following experiment used a measuring interval in the electrometer of only 15° (1185.). The pressure of air within the apparatus being reduced to 1.9 inches of mercury, <b>the</b> <b>charge</b> <b>was</b> found to be 29°; then letting in air till the pressure <b>was</b> 30 inches, <b>the</b> <b>charge</b> <b>was</b> still 29°.|$|R

25|$|It is {{now known}} that the Franklin-Watson model was {{fundamentally}} correct. There is only one kind of electrical charge, and only one variable is required {{to keep track of}} the amount of charge. On the other hand, just knowing <b>the</b> <b>charge</b> <b>is</b> not a complete description of the situation. Matter is composed of several kinds of electrically charged particles, and these particles have many properties, not just charge.|$|E
25|$|Objects may {{possess a}} {{property}} known as electric charge and an electric field exerts a force on charged objects. If the charged object {{has a positive}} charge the force {{will be in the}} direction of the electric field vector at that point while if <b>the</b> <b>charge</b> <b>is</b> negative the force will be in the opposite direction. The magnitude of the force is given by the quantity of the charge multiplied by the magnitude of the electric field vector.|$|E

25|$|In physics, charge {{conservation}} {{is the principle}} that electric charge can neither be created nor destroyed. The quantity of electric charge, the amount of positive charge minus the amount of negative charge in the universe, is always conserved. As part of his groundbreaking work in electricity, Benjamin Franklin around the year 1747 discovered the principle of charge conservation {{when he came to}} the conclusion that the two states of electricity, positive and negative, <b>the</b> <b>charge</b> <b>is</b> never created or destroyed but instead transferable from one place to another.|$|E
25|$|Military {{courts have}} {{authority}} over cases involving soldiers {{or members of}} other military or police branches. If the charge against a soldier or member of the military or police branch is a misdemeanour, the sentence against the defendant is final. If <b>the</b> <b>charge</b> <b>is</b> a felony, the defendant {{has the right to}} appeal to the Military Chamber at the Court of Cassation. Military courts also have authority to try civilians in cases based on military law. Civilians have the right to appeal all sentences in military court. A military prosecutor decides the venue for a civilian defendant.|$|E
25|$|All {{criminal}} trials {{before the}} High Court are heard and disposed of before a single Judge of the High Court. When the Court {{is ready to}} commence a trial, the accused appears or is brought before the court. <b>The</b> <b>charge</b> <b>is</b> read and explained, and the accused is asked {{whether he or she}} is guilty of the offence or claims to be tried. If the accused pleads guilty the plea is recorded, and he or she may be convicted on it and sentenced. If the accused refuses to or does not plead, or if he or she claims trial, the Court proceeds to try the case.|$|E
