Then, I slew {{one of the best}} and boldest of their warriors, they say, and it is too much to expect that they should captivate the man who did this deed, in the very same {{scouting}} on which it was performed, and they take no account of the matter.

60|$|It will be {{understood}} that all <b>this</b> <b>was</b> much <b>talked</b> <b>of</b> in Carmarthen.

But not the less was it understood that Mr Apjohn and Mr Evans were not hostile {{to each other in}} the matter. Mr Apjohn would be quite honest in what he did. He would do his best to prove the libel,--on condition that his client were the honest owner of the property in question. In truth, however, the great object of them all was to get Henry Jones into a witness-box, so that, if possible, the very truth might be extracted from him.|$|R

50|$|Though Bush often polled {{in the low}} double digits, he was {{considered}} a prominent candidate due to his high fundraising ability, record as governor of Florida (a crucial swing state) and apparent electability.

During this period from November 2014 until late January 2015, the speculation fueled Romney's rise in many national polls as well, challenging Bush.

40|$|Abstract The subject <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>talk</b> <b>is</b> {{the maximum}} {{principle}} and its application for investigating {{the stability and}} convergence of finite difference schemes. To some extent, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> {{a survey of the}} works on constructing and investigating certain new classes of monotone difference schemes. In this connection the maximum principle for the derivatives discussed in <b>this</b> <b>talk</b> <b>is</b> <b>of</b> fundamental importance. It is used as a basis for proving the coefficient stability of difference schemes in Banach spaces and the monotonicity of economical schemes of full approximation. New results on unconditional stability of monotone difference schemes with weights, conservative explicit-implicit schemes (staggered schemes), monotone schemes of second-order approximation in arbitrary domains are given...|$|R

Following <b>this</b> match there <b>was</b> <b>talk</b> <b>of</b> him becoming a long-term replacement for Jack Mercer, but with the start of World War II and the subsequent cancellation of county cricket, <b>this</b> <b>was</b> not to be. In his brief time with Glamorgan, Evans scored 164 runs at an average of 12.61, with a high score of 36. With the ball, he took 5 wickets, although these came at a fairly expensive average of 66.20. Following the war he opted not to continue his cricket career, but instead to focus on a career in teaching.|$|R
60|$|The paradox lies in wait here, as in {{most other}} human affairs, to {{confound}} us, {{and we try to}} baffle it, in this way and in that. We <b>talk,</b> for instance, <b>of</b> poetry for poets, and we fondly imagine that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> different from <b>talking</b> <b>of</b> cookery for cooks. Poetry is not made for poets; they have enough poetry of their own, but it is made for people who are not poets. If it does not please these, it may still be poetry, but it is poetry which has failed of its truest office. It is none the less its truest office because some very wretched verse seems often to do it.|$|R
