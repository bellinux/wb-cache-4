5|$|Lessons had a {{significant}} effect on the development of children's literature in Britain and the United States. Maria Edgeworth, Sarah Trimmer, Jane Taylor, and Ellenor Fenn, to name a few of the most illustrious, were inspired to become children's authors because of Lessons and their works dominated children's literature for several generations. Lessons itself was reprinted for over a century. However, because of the disrepute <b>that</b> <b>educational</b> writings fell into, largely due to the low esteem awarded Barbauld, Trimmer, and others by contemporary male Romantic writers, Barbauld's Lessons has rarely been studied by scholars. In fact, it has only been analysed in depth since the 1990s.|$|E
25|$|Little {{is known}} about how synesthesia develops. It has been {{suggested}} that synesthesia develops during childhood when children are intensively engaged with abstract concepts for the first time. This hypothesis – referred to as semantic vacuum hypothesis – explains why the most common forms of synesthesia are grapheme-color, spatial sequence and number form. These are usually the first abstract concepts <b>that</b> <b>educational</b> systems require children to learn.|$|E

The program also set out the government's aim <b>that</b> <b>educational</b> investment should account for four percent of GDP in {{a relatively short period of}} time.|$|E

25|$|In Bakke, the Court {{held that}} racial quotas are unconstitutional, but <b>that</b> <b>educational</b> {{institutions}} could legally use race {{as one of}} many factors to consider in their admissions process. In Grutter and Gratz, the Court upheld both Bakke as a precedent and the admissions policy of the University of Michigan Law School. In dicta, however, Justice O'Connor, writing for the Court, said she expected that in 25 years, racial preferences {{would no longer be}} necessary. In Gratz, the Court invalidated Michigan's undergraduate admissions policy, on the grounds that unlike the law school's policy, which treated race as one of many factors in an admissions process that looked to the individual applicant, the undergraduate policy used a point system that was excessively mechanistic.|$|E
25|$|Members of the Deaf {{community}} {{tend to view}} deafness as {{a difference}} in human experience rather than a disability or disease. Many members take pride in their Deaf identity. Deaf people, {{in the sense of}} a community or culture, can then be seen as a minority group, and therefore some who are a part of this community may feel misunderstood by those who don't know sign language. Another struggle that the Deaf community often faces is <b>that</b> <b>educational</b> institutions usually consist primarily of hearing people. Additionally, hearing family members may need to learn sign language in order for the deaf person to feel included and supported. Unlike other cultures, a deaf person may join the community later in life, rather than being born into it.|$|E

[...] But he stressed that radio was fundamentally an instrument of commerce and that the FRC should take no action that might imperil that.|$|E
500|$|Humor {{was used}} on Sesame Street to both attract the {{attention}} of its young viewers and to, as Lesser put it, [...] "entice parents and older siblings to share the young child's viewing", called [...] "coviewing" [...] by Truglio and Fisch. [...] Jim Henson's characters and humor were instrumental in creating the show's [...] "two-tiered audience" [...] of younger and older viewers. [...] Lesser {{went so far as to}} state <b>that</b> <b>educational</b> television was [...] "completely dependent upon the effective use of humor". Lesser also stated that in order for comedy to be an effective teaching tool, it had to coincide with the lesson being taught. [...] Although critics complained that slapstick was too violent for children's television, the Workshop found that it was the most effective comedy form they used, and as Lesser said, [...] "a favorite with preschoolers". Morrow reported that the only violence depicted on Sesame Street was [...] "slapstick punctuation", and that it was used only in animations and short films.|$|E
500|$|Richard Edgeworth {{observed}} on his wife's death that being {{familiar with the}} experimental method in science, {{she was surprised to}} find <b>that</b> <b>educational</b> theory was based on very little empirical evidence, and set out to apply experimental science to child education and devised, executed and recorded experiments with children. She conceived and executed a register (2 volumes 1778–1779) of the reaction of children to new knowledge and experience, given her interest in applying experimental science to the field of child education. She observed the questions that children asked, what they did, and how they solved problems. An extensive example of her recorded dialogue is given by Richard and Maria Edgeworth in [...] "Practical Education". This formed the basis of Richard Edgeworth's Essays on professional education (1809). In the Bodleian Library there is a short story in manuscript dated 1787 and other fragments attributed to Honora Sneyd. Her parents' principles of childhood education were to be a profound influence on Maria Edgeworth's own career as a writer for children.|$|E

Some of the measures <b>that</b> <b>educational</b> establishments must adopt include: guaranteeing the social name of trans students in all fields, the right to wear uniforms, sports clothes or accessories according to their gender identity; and provide trans student facilities for the use of bathrooms and showers according to the specific needs of the process they are living, respecting their gender identity.|$|E
2500|$|Chapter 11, [...] "The Fall of the Meritocracy", {{examines}} falling {{standards in}} British education. Hitchens cites {{the abolition of}} grammar schools {{as one of the}} main causes, which has also resulted in a decline in social mobility. Hitchens claims egalitarians deny these consequences and that comprehensive education has failed. Hitchens also quotes a 2000 study, which asserted that [...] "the general lowering of standards and rigour since the end of selection {{is one of the main}} reasons behind the current drive to devalue examinations". Hitchens asks why, [...] "the educated, conscious servants of the state should seek to pretend <b>that</b> <b>educational</b> standards are rising when the opposite is true. The answer is that they have put equality before education". Chapter 12, [...] "'The age of the train'", outlines how the Conservative and Labour parties facilitated the dismantling of much of Britain's rail network. Hitchens asserts this is evidence that the [...] "Tory Party does not love Britain, any more than the Labour Party loves the poor". The chapter also provides a conservative argument against mass car ownership, saying that [...] "roads destroy and distort established ways of living", while [...] "the traditional English town, with its defined centre, ancient street pattern and comfortable shape, was not destroyed by the coming of the railway. It was enhanced". In Chapter 13, [...] "A Comfortable Hotel on the Road to Damascus", Hitchens explores how since the 2001 September 11 attacks and the 2003 Invasion of Iraq, certain commentators on the left realigned with an American neoconservative position, which, [...] "delivers him [...] to another portion of the 'centre ground', one where foreign policy is the only thing worth discussing, and where former conservatives and former Leftists can mingle in happy communion", and allows [...] "political conservatism to soothe its tribal base by appearing strong overseas, while failing to be anything of the kind at home".|$|E
60|$|I {{came off}} in public, as I have said, with flying colours; the {{sittings}} {{of the court}} of inquiry died away like a tune that no one listens to; and yet I was unmasked--I, whom my very adversary defended, as good as confessed, as good as told {{the nature of the}} quarrel, and by so doing prepared for myself in the future a most anxious, disagreeable adventure. It was the third morning after the duel, and Goguelat was still in life, when the time came round for me to give Major Chevenix a lesson. I was fond of this occupation; not that he paid me much--no more, indeed, than eighteenpence a month, the customary figure, being a miser in the grain; but because I liked his breakfasts and (to some extent) himself. At least, {{he was a man of}} education; and of the others with whom I had any opportunity of speech, those that would not have held a book upside down would have torn the pages out for pipe-lights. For I must repeat again that our body of prisoners was exceptional: there was in Edinburgh Castle none of <b>that</b> <b>educational</b> busyness that distinguished some of the other prisons, so that men entered them unable to read, and left them fit for high employments. Chevenix was handsome, and surprisingly young to be a major: six feet in his stockings, well set up, with regular features and very clear grey eyes. It was impossible to pick a fault in him, and yet the sum-total was displeasing. Perhaps he was too clean; he seemed to bear about with him the smell of soap. Cleanliness is good, but I cannot bear a man's nails to seem japanned. And certainly he was too self-possessed and cold. There was none of the fire of youth, none of the swiftness of the soldier, in this young officer. His kindness was cold, and cruel cold; his deliberation exasperating. And perhaps it was from this character, which is very much the opposite of my own, that even in these days, when he was of service to me, I approached him with suspicion and reserve.|$|E

6000|$|The {{law that}} dominates {{the future is}} glaringly plain. A people must develop and {{consolidate}} its educated efficient classes or be beaten in war and give way upon all points where its interests conflict {{with the interests of}} more capable people. It must foster and accelerate that natural segregation, which has been discussed in the third and fourth chapters of these [...] "Anticipations," [...] or perish. The war of the coming time will really be won in schools and colleges and universities, wherever men write and read and talk together. The nation that produces in the near future the largest proportional development of educated and intelligent engineers and agriculturists, of doctors, schoolmasters, professional soldiers, and intellectually active people of all sorts; the nation that most resolutely picks over, educates, sterilizes, exports, or poisons its People of the Abyss; the nation that succeeds most subtly in checking gambling and the moral decay of women and homes that gambling inevitably entails; the nation that by wise interventions, death duties and the like, contrives to expropriate and extinguish incompetent rich families while leaving individual ambitions free; the nation, in a word, that turns the greatest proportion of its irresponsible adiposity into social muscle, will certainly be the nation that will be the most powerful in warfare as in peace, will certainly be the ascendant or dominant nation before the year 2000. In the long run no heroism and no accidents can alter that. No flag-waving, no patriotic leagues, no visiting of essentially petty imperial personages hither and thither, no smashing of the windows of outspoken people nor seizures of papers and books, will arrest the march of national defeat. And this issue is already so plain and simple, the alternatives are becoming so pitilessly clear, that even in the stupidest court and the stupidest constituencies, it must presently begin in some dim way to be felt. A time will come when so many people will see this issue clearly that it will gravely affect political and social life. The patriotic party--the particular gang, that is, of lawyers, brewers, landlords, and railway directors that wishes to be dominant--will be forced to become an efficient party in profession at least, will be forced to stimulate and organize <b>that</b> <b>educational</b> and social development that may at last even bring patriotism under control. The rulers of the grey, the democratic politician and the democratic monarch, will be obliged year by year by the very nature of things to promote the segregation of colours within the grey, to foster the power that will finally supersede democracy and monarchy altogether, the power of the scientifically educated, disciplined specialist, and that finally is the power of saints, the power of the thing that is provably right. It may be delayed, but it cannot be defeated; in the end it must arrive--if not to-day and among our people, then to-morrow and among another people, who will triumph in our overthrow. This is the lesson that must be learnt, that some tongue and kindred of the coming time must inevitably learn. But what tongue it will be, and what kindred that will first attain this new development, opens far more complex and far less certain issues than any we have hitherto considered.|$|E
