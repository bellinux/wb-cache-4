5|$|Like {{other games}} in the genre, the player plays the main portion of Shiny Festa gameplay, Stage mode, {{as he or she}} listens to a {{selected}} song. Each song's performance is limited to a predetermined idol or group of idols, unlike the franchise's previous games. During a song, a predetermined sequence of note icons scroll along several lines, called Melody Lines, toward a central target icon. To complete a song, the player must press buttons that correspond to the direction from which the notes originate from—the buttons on the console's left and right halves for the PlayStation Portable version, and the left and right halves of <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> <b>for</b> the iOS version—as they pass over the target icon. The player is scored by these presses' accuracy in timing and direction, for which he or she is given one of four ratings: Perfect, Good, Normal, and Bad. The player's performance is also represented by the Sparkle Meter, which increases or decreases as the player successfully or fails to hit a note. Throughout the song, new target icons and lines may spawn at predetermined times in different locations of the screen to supersede or accompany old ones. The note sequences may also include Long Icons, which are streaks of notes that need to be continuously held down; Simultaneous Icons, which are pairs of icons that pass over the target icon simultaneously; and Shooting Stars, which appears once the Sparkle Meter is filled, and causes a Shining Burst that raises the player's score and changes the song's accompanying music video when it is hit. The complexity of the song's sequence varies based on the player's selected difficulty for the song; there are four difficulty levels: Debut, Normal, Pro, and Master from the easiest to the hardest.|$|E

40|$|Background: Due to {{the aging}} of the {{population}} the number of elderly admitted to hospitals will continue to increase over the next decades. 30 - 60 % of elderly admitted to the hospital experience functional decline. A national government induced instrument (VeiligheidsManagement Systeem (VMS)) <b>for</b> <b>screening</b> of vulnerable elderly is used in 93 Dutch hospitals to prevent functional decline. By identifying elderly (aged > 70) at risk for delirium, falls, malnutrition and functional impairment, adequate preventive measures can be taken. <b>The</b> VMS <b>screening</b> method however has not been validated yet. Objectives: The first objective {{of this study is to}} determine the predictive value of <b>the</b> VMS <b>screening</b> <b>for</b> functional decline 24 months after hospitalisation. The second objective is to determine the predictive value of <b>the</b> <b>screening</b> <b>for</b> falling and delirium. Design and setting: Retrospective observational study in patients of 70 years of age and above admitted from 28 March 2011 to 10 June 2011 to the Deventer Ziekenhuis in the Netherlands. Method: 24 months after hospitalisation data ware collected about functional decline, mortality and rehospitalisation and the incidence of falls and delirium. Results: 687 patients were included, the median age was 78, 7 (range: 70, 0 - 79, 1) and 348 (50, 7 %) were male. After 3 months 84 (12, 2 %) patients had died and after 24 months 155 (33 %) patients. 287 (40, 5 %) patients experienced functional decline. Independent predictors for functional decline were delirium risk (Odds Ratio (OR) : 2, 11; 95 %-Confidence Interval (CI) 1, 44 - 3, 10), functional impairment (OR: 1, 93; 95 %-CI 1, 28 - 2, 90), admission to a non-surgical ward (OR: 0, 39; 95 %-CI 0, 28 - 0, 56) and older age (OR: 1, 06; 95 %-CI 1, 03 - 1, 09). The sensitivity of <b>the</b> <b>screening</b> <b>for</b> delirium risk is 83 % and the specificity is 62 %. The sensitivity of <b>the</b> <b>screening</b> <b>for</b> fall risk is 63 % and the specificity is 65 %. Conclusions: <b>The</b> VMS <b>screening</b> method vulnerable elderly has predictive value for functional decline. <b>The</b> VMS <b>screening</b> <b>for</b> delirium is a reasonable instrument to identify elderly at risk <b>for</b> delirium, <b>the</b> <b>screening</b> <b>for</b> fall risk however is moderate. ...|$|R

On the 16th, she bombarded Isabela City, Basilan Island, creating a diversion while Army troops landed at Kulibato Point to the east. Assisted by spotting aircraft, she shelled a wharf and the area of suspected enemy underground trenches. On the evening of 18 March, she responded to the request of shore fire-control parties by blasting a Japanese troop concentration of about 150 men in the Gumularang River Valley of Basilan Island, giving support to American Army and guerilla troops. She anchored off the Santa Cruz Bank from 20 to 24 March.|$|E

When the Fauves held their own exhibit in 1906, Munch was invited and displayed his works with theirs. After studying the sculpture of Rodin, Munch may have experimented with plasticine {{as an aid to}} design, but he produced little sculpture. During this time, Munch received many commissions for portraits and prints which improved his usually precarious financial condition. In 1906, he painted <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> <b>for</b> an Ibsen play in the small Kammerspiele Theatre located in Berlin's Deutsches Theater, in which the Frieze of Life was hung.

25|$|The site {{on which}} the Flatiron Building would stand was bought in 1857 by Amos Eno, who shortly built the Fifth Avenue Hotel on a site diagonally across from it. Eno tore down the four-story St. Germaine Hotel on {{the south end of}} the lot, and {{replaced}} it with a seven-story apartment building, the Cumberland. On the remainder of the lot he built four three-story buildings for commercial use. This left four stories of the Cumberland's northern face exposed, which Eno rented out to advertisers, including The New York Times, who installed a sign made up of electric lights. Eno later put a canvas screen on the wall, and projected images onto it from a magic lantern on top of one of his smaller buildings, presenting advertisements and interesting pictures alternately. Both the Times and the New York Tribune began using <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> <b>for</b> news bulletins, and on election nights tens of thousands of people would gather in Madison Square, waiting for the latest results.|$|E

The next significant of action for the Scots Greys occurred at Willems 10 May 1794 on the heights near Tournai. There the Scots Greys, brigaded with the Bays and the Inniskillings, charged the advancing French infantry. The French infantry, upon seeing the threat of the cavalry formed into squares. The Scots Greys charged directly into nearest of the squares. The charge broke the formed infantry square, a remarkable feat. The breaking of the first square demoralised the other French infantry, allowing the Bays and the Inniskillings to break those squares as well. In exchange for 20 casualties, the Greys had helped rout three battalions and capture at least 13 artillery pieces. This would be the last time that British cavalry, alone without artillery support, would break an infantry square until the Battle of Garcia Hernandez in 1812.|$|E
