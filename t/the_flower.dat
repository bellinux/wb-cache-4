5|$|A {{variety of}} pollinators have been {{recorded}} visiting <b>the</b> <b>flower</b> spikes, including New Holland honeyeater (Phylidonyris novaehollandiae), red wattlebird (Anthochaera carunculata), native and European honey bees, wasps and ants. <b>The</b> <b>flower</b> spikes drip nectar onto the ground or lower leaves, suggesting pollination by nonflying mammals, which are attracted to the scent. Being upside down may facilitate this process.|$|E

5|$|Numerous nectar-feeding {{insects are}} {{attracted}} to <b>the</b> <b>flower</b> spikes, which in turn attract honeyeaters, silvereyes and sunbirds, many of which consume both nectar and insects. The sugar glider (Petaurus breviceps) forages among <b>the</b> <b>flower</b> spikes and is a probable pollinator. The common blossom bat (Syconycteris australis) feeds on nectar. B.dentata has been recorded as a host plant for the mistletoe species Amyema benthamii, Decaisnina angustata and D.signata.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the leaves}} die back in summer, the roots also wither. After some years, the roots shorten pulling the bulbs {{deeper into the}} ground (contractile roots). The bulbs develop from the inside, pushing the older layers {{outwards}} which become brown and dry, forming an outer shell, the tunic or skin. Up to 60 layers have been counted in some wild species. While the plant appears dormant above the ground <b>the</b> <b>flower</b> stalk which will start {{to grow in the}} following spring, develops within the bulb surrounded by two to three deciduous leaves and their sheaths. <b>The</b> <b>flower</b> stem lies in the axil of the second true leaf.|$|E
50|$|As <b>the</b> <b>flowers</b> bloomed {{early in}} 2015, {{it was not}} held {{at the same time}} as <b>the</b> <b>flowering</b> season. However, when in {{conjunction}} with <b>the</b> <b>flowering</b> season, as many as 123,000 people stop by the event.|$|R

5|$|Although {{there is}} no clear {{evidence}} that the flower's name derives directly from the Greek myth, this link between <b>the</b> <b>flower</b> and the myth became firmly part of western culture. The narcissus or daffodil is the most loved of all English plants, and appears frequently in English literature. Many English writers have referred to the cultural and symbolic importance of Narcissus). No flower has received more poetic description except the rose and the lily, with poems by authors from John Gower, Shakespeare, Milton (see Roman culture, above), Wordsworth, Shelley and Keats. Frequently the poems deal with self-love derived from Ovid's account. Gower's reference to the yellow flower of the legend has been assumed to be the daffodil or Narcissus, though as with all references in the older literature to <b>the</b> <b>flower</b> that sprang from the youth's death, there is room for some debate as to the exact species of flower indicated, some preferring Crocus. Spenser announces the coming of the Daffodil in Aprill of his Shepheardes Calender (1579).|$|E
5|$|Banksia inflorescences are {{energy-rich}} {{sources of}} food, and B. aquilonia nectar is a likely food item {{of the endangered}} mahogany glider (Petaurus gracilis), {{as well as many}} other mammals and birds.

5|$|Bees {{are also}} mimicked by {{plants such as}} the bee orchid which imitates both the {{appearance}} and the scent of a female bee; male bees attempt to mate (pseudocopulation) with the furry lip of <b>the</b> <b>flower,</b> thus pollinating it.|$|E

5|$|In {{at least}} some species, once a {{bumblebee}} has visited a flower, it leaves a scent mark on it. This scent mark deters bumblebees from visiting that flower until the scent degrades. This scent mark is a general chemical bouquet that bumblebees leave behind in different locations (e.g. nest, neutral, and food sites), and they learn to use this bouquet to identify both rewarding and unrewarding flowers, and {{may be able to}} identify who else has visited a flower. Bumblebees rely on this chemical bouquet more when <b>the</b> <b>flower</b> has a high handling time, that is, where it takes a longer time for the bee to find the nectar once inside <b>the</b> <b>flower.</b>|$|E
