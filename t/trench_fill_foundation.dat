40|$|Flowable fill is a {{self-leveling}} and self-compacting {{material that}} is rapidly gaining acceptance and application in construction, particularly in transportation and utility earthworks. When mixed with concrete sand, standard flowable fill produces a mass density ranging from 1. 8 to 2. 3 g/cm 3 (115 to 145 pcf). Scrap tires can be granulated to produce crumb rubber, which has a granular texture and ranges in size from very fine powder to coarse sand-sized particles. Due to its low specific gravity, crumb rubber {{can be considered a}} lightweight aggregate. This paper describes an experimental study on replacing sand with crumb rubber in flowable fill to produce a lightweight material. To assess the technical feasibility of using crumb rubber, the fluid- and hardened-state properties of nine flowable fill mixtures were measured. Mixture proportions were varied to investigate the effects of water-to-cement ratio and crumb rubber content on fill properties. Experimental results indicate that crumb rubber can be successfully used to produce a lightweight flowable fill (1. 2 to 1. 6 g/cm 3 [73 to 98 pcf]) with excavatable 28 -day compressive strengths ranging from 269 to 1194 kPa (39 to 173 psi). Using a lightweight fill reduces the applied stress on underlying soils, thereby reducing the potential for bearing capacity failure and minimizing soil settlement. Based on these results, a crumb rubber-based flowable fill {{can be used in a}} substantial number of construction applications, such as bridge abutment <b>fills,</b> <b>trench</b> <b>fills,</b> and <b>foundation</b> support <b>fills...</b>|$|R

In the Early Medieval period, when ships were important means of transportation, Charlemagne decided to link both catchments by {{the construction of}} a canal connecting the Schwabian Rezat and the Altmühl rivers. The artificial waterway would provide a continuous inland navigation route from the North Sea to the Black Sea. The shortcut is known as Fossa Carolina and represents {{one of the most important}} Early Medieval engineering achievements in Europe. Despite the important geostrategic relevance of the construction it is not clarified whether the canal was actually used as a navigation waterway. We present new geophysical data and in situ findings from the <b>trench</b> <b>fills</b> that prove for the first time a total length of the constructed Carolingian canal of at least 2300 metres.

Sands from the slope and accreted <b>trench</b> <b>fill</b> at Sites 1175 and 1176 are dominated by quartz with less abundant feldspar, sedimentary rock fragments, and only minor volcanic and metamorphic rock fragments. In contrast to the trench turbidites of Sites 1173 and 1174, these sands are very quartzose with characteristic radiolarian chert fragments. Volcanic rock fragments are mainly of silicic composition. Potential sources of these sands are uplifted subduction complexes of southwest Japan. Sands from the accreted trench turbidites at Site 1178 have clast types similar to those at Sites 1175 and 1176. In contrast, however, framework detrital modes are distinctive, with Site 1178 sands having substantially lower total quartz contents and more abundant fine-grained sedimentary rock fragments. These sands were also probably derived from the island of Shikoku, but their composition indicates that sedimentary rocks were abundant in the source area and these may have been Miocene forearc basin successions that were largely removed by erosion. Erosional remnants of Miocene forearc basin deposits are present on the Kii Peninsula east-northeast of Shikoku.
