50|$|For example, Plavix, Singulair, Diovan and Lipitor are all {{chemical}} <b>blockbuster</b> <b>drugs</b> {{discovered in}} the early 1990s, with patent expiration date falling between 2011 and 2015; and Rituxan, Humira, Novolog and Avastin are biologic <b>blockbuster</b> <b>drugs</b> {{discovered in the}} late 1990s, with patent expiration date between 2014 and 2019. Thus, the revenue obtained through the sales of these products is at risk of falling drastically within {{the years of the}} patent cliff, which is often seen as an opportunity for other companies to generate revenue from selling generic or similar products.|$|R

50|$|Originally {{developed}} by Actelion, from 2007 almorexant was being reported {{as a potential}} <b>blockbuster</b> <b>drug,</b> as its novel mechanism of action (orexin receptor antagonism) was thought to produce better quality sleep and fewer side effects than the traditional benzodiazepines and Z-drugs which dominated the multibillion-dollar insomnia medication market.|$|R
2500|$|Biological {{aspects of}} {{fluorine}} describes {{the effects of}} fluorine-containing compounds with life. [...] Fluorine (F2) itself is very rare in everyday life, but hundreds of fluorine-containing compounds occur as minerals, medicines, pesticides, and materials. [...] Naturally occurring organofluorine compounds are extremely rare. Nonetheless, several <b>blockbuster</b> <b>drugs</b> contain fluorine, such as Lipitor and Prozac.|$|R
40|$|The {{synergistic}} effect of Lewis acids and MacMillan organocatalyst allows the α-regioselective and enantioselective α-amidoalkylation of piperidine derivatives with enolizable aldehydes.

30|$|The {{pharmaceutical}} industry is under extreme financial pressure…Given increasingly cost-constrained health care systems, limited patent durations on <b>blockbuster</b> <b>drugs,</b> competition from generics, a more demanding regulatory environment, diminishing marketing exclusivity, and progressively smaller markets {{resulting from the}} rapidly increasing molecular segmentation of the populations of patients…companies {{are being forced to}} overhaul their drug development strategies (p. 348).|$|R
40|$|Much of {{the value}} {{contained}} in early stages of pharmaceutical projects is in the promise of developing a <b>blockbuster</b> <b>drug.</b> This is especially apparent for firms in the biotechnology industry. Many biotech firms have significant valuations, yet do not have profits from which to value the firm using traditional methods because their products are in early stages o...|$|R
5000|$|In 1993 {{a team of}} {{researchers}} at Searle Research and Development filed a patent application for celecoxib, which Searle developed and which became the first selective COX-2 inhibitor to be approved by the FDA on December 31, 1998. [...] Control of this <b>blockbuster</b> <b>drug</b> was often mentioned as a key reason for Pfizer's acquisition of Pharmacia.|$|R

40|$|Organizations try {{to learn}} from history. So too do those who study them. Learning from history, in turn, often begins with asking why {{particular}} events occurred. Why did Coca Cola’s New Coke initiative fail so dismally and at such great expense? Why did Pfizer fail to secure continued protection of the patent for its <b>blockbuster</b> <b>drug</b> Viagra when challenged in court b...|$|R
50|$|The PRV isn't {{limited to}} the pairing of drugs within a single company, rather can be {{transferred}} between companies. Companies with NTD drug candidates in their pipelines but without a <b>blockbuster</b> <b>drug,</b> are able to sell their voucher producing financial returns. In the EU, similar priority review incentives are now under consideration {{to increase the speed}} of regulatory pricing and reimbursement decisions.|$|R

50|$|PRA Health Sciences (PRA) {{has worked}} to develop a variety of compounds, ranging from niche {{treatments}} and therapies to <b>blockbuster</b> <b>drugs.</b> PRA has participated in several Clinical Trials of note such as the Landmark Alzheimer's Prevention Clinical Trial, a collaborative effort involving the Banner Alzheimer's Institute (BAI); Genentech, {{a member of the}} Roche Group; the University of Antioquia in Colombia; and the National Institutes of Health (NIH).|$|R
5000|$|In 2013, Apotex {{began selling}} a biosimilar version of Amgen's Neulasta in Europe, a <b>blockbuster</b> <b>drug</b> used by cancer {{patients}} in chemotherapy {{as a way}} to boost white blood count. Apotex's version is known as Grastofil (filgrastim) and is licensed for sale in Europe by Stada Arzneimittel. [...] In February 2015, the FDA accepted Apotex's application of its filing of Grastofil in the United States.|$|R
2500|$|The {{commercial}} name [...] "Tagamet" [...] was decided upon by fusing {{the two words}} [...] "antagonist" [...] and [...] "cimetidine". Subsequent to the introduction onto the U.S. drug market, two other H2 receptor antagonists were approved, ranitidine (Zantac, Glaxo Labs) and famotidine (Pepcid, Yamanouchi, Ltd.) [...] Cimetidine became the first drug ever to reach more than $1 {{billion a year in}} sales, thus making it the first <b>blockbuster</b> <b>drug.</b>|$|R
50|$|Technology {{developed}} by CAT {{was used to}} create adalimumab, the first fully human antibody <b>blockbuster</b> <b>drug.</b> Humira, the brand name of adalimumab, is an anti-TNF antibody discovered by CAT as D2E7, then developed in the clinic and marketed by Abbott Laboratories. The company was also behind belimumab, the anti-BlyS antibody drug marketed as Benlysta and the first new approved drug for systemic lupus in more than 50 years.|$|R

50|$|In 1985, Monsanto {{acquired}} G. D. Searle & Company, a {{life sciences}} company {{that focused on}} pharmaceuticals, agriculture and animal health. In 1993, its Searle division filed a patent application for Celebrex, which in 1998 became the first selective COX‑2 inhibitor {{to be approved by}} the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Celebrex became a <b>blockbuster</b> <b>drug</b> and was often mentioned as a key reason for Pfizer's acquisition of Monsanto's pharmaceutical business in 2002.|$|R
50|$|The prototypical H2 antagonist, called cimetidine, was {{developed}} by Sir James Black at Smith, Kline & French (now GlaxoSmithKline) in the mid-to-late 1960s. It was first marketed in 1976 and sold under the trade name Tagamet, which became the first <b>blockbuster</b> <b>drug.</b> The use of quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR) {{led to the development}} of other agents—starting with ranitidine, first sold as Zantac, which has fewer adverse effects and drug interactions and is more potent.|$|R
30|$|In addition, {{a greater}} {{understanding}} in the molecular basis of human disease and pharmacogenomics {{has led to the}} emergence of therapeutic interventions tailor-made for stratified group of patients. Such medicines are likely to improve clinical outcomes and increase patient safety, which the current <b>blockbuster</b> <b>drug</b> struggles to deliver. Drugs that target at smaller patient population have already achieved the market breakthrough. Such transformation would require a fundamental restructuring and re-tooling in the drug discovery and development.|$|R
40|$|Australia, {{like most}} countries, faces high and rapidly-rising drug costs. There are longstanding {{concerns}} about pharmaceutical companies inappropriately extending their monopoly position by "evergreening" <b>blockbuster</b> <b>drugs,</b> through misuse of the patent system. There is, however, very little empirical {{information about this}} behaviour. We fill the gap by analysing all of the patents associated with 15 of the costliest drugs in Australia over the last 20 years. Specifically, we search the patent register to identify all the granted patents that cover the active pharmaceutical ingredient of the high-cost drugs. Then, we classify the patents by type, and identify their owners. We find a mean of 49 patents associated with each drug. Three-quarters of these patents are owned by companies other than the drug's originator. Surprisingly, the majority of all patents are owned by companies {{that do not have}} a record of developing top-selling drugs. Our findings show that a multitude of players seek monopoly control over innovations to <b>blockbuster</b> <b>drugs.</b> Consequently, attempts to control drug costs by mitigating misuse of the patent system are likely to miss the mark if they focus only on the patenting activities of originator...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the last}} century, the life {{sciences}} have generated important insights in functional processes of life, mainly due to the broad introduction of reductionism and experi-mental manipulation in biology and medi-cal research during the 20 th century [1]. On {{the basis of this}} extremely successful research paradigm, amongst others, scien-tists rationally dissected multiple molecular mechanisms of ‘living systems’, identified the causes of inheritable severe disorders and developed <b>blockbuster</b> <b>drugs.</b> For example, it is nowadays a widely known textbook knowledge that some rare mutations can cause severe monogeneti...|$|R

30|$|Orthoclone OKT 3 ® (muromonab-CD 3), {{the first}} {{therapeutic}} monoclonal antibody, was approved in 1985 by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as an antirejection agent for renal transplantation (Goldstein, 1987; Smith, 1996). Since then, {{the development of}} monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) as therapeutic drugs has become a hot area in biopharmaceutical industries (Pavlou and Belsey, 2005; An, 2010; Beck et al., 2010; Leavy, 2010). Currently, nearly 50 mAb-related products, including several <b>blockbuster</b> <b>drugs,</b> are licensed to treat a variety of diseases in the US and Europe (Ecker et al., 2015).|$|R
