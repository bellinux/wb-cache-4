5|$|Jackson's {{faith in}} Johnson {{to balance the}} ticket proved misplaced. In the general election, Johnson cost <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> votes in the South, where his {{relationship}} with Chinn was particularly unpopular. He also failed to garner much support from the West, where {{he was supposed to}} be strong due to his reputation as an Indian fighter and war hero. He even failed to deliver his home state of Kentucky for <b>the</b> <b>Democrats.</b> Regardless, <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> still won the popular vote.|$|E
5|$|Philadelphia's {{municipal}} election of November 8, 1955 involved contests for mayor, district attorney, all seventeen city council seats, among other offices. Citywide, <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> took majorities of over 130,000 votes, continuing their success from the elections four years earlier. Richardson Dilworth, {{who had been}} elected district attorney in 1951, was elected mayor. Victor H. Blanc, a city councilman, was elected district attorney. <b>The</b> <b>Democrats</b> also kept fourteen of seventeen city council seats, losing one district seat while gaining another, and kept control of the other citywide offices. The election represented a further consolidation of control by <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> after their citywide victories of four years earlier.|$|E

50|$|On December 1, 1986, the Virginia-based Gannett Corporation, {{the nations}} largest {{newspaper}} chain, purchased The Gazette from the Heiskell-Patterson family. Within five years <b>the</b> <b>Democrat</b> closed <b>the</b> circulation gap. The Gazette circulation was still substantially {{larger than that}} of <b>The</b> <b>Democrat</b> in 1986, but within five years, <b>The</b> <b>Democrat</b> virtually tied <b>The</b> Gazette in daily circulation: 133,753 to 134,027 for The Gazette.

5|$|Although Morton {{was able}} to keep the state united during {{the first phase of the}} war, once {{emancipation}} became an issue in 1862, the Republicans suffered a major defeat in the mid-term elections, and Morton lost the support of the strong Democratic majority in the legislature. Before the new legislature convened in 1863, Morton began circulating reports that <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> intended to seize control of the state government, secede from the Union, and instigate riots. <b>The</b> <b>Democrats</b> responded with harsh criticisms of Morton and Lincoln, the conduct of the war, and the issues of emancipation and the loss of constitutional rights, among others. Accusations on both sides created a tense atmosphere that only worsened relation between the two parties and guaranteed further confrontations.|$|E
5|$|At {{about this}} time, civil strife {{broke out in}} Corinth between the {{democratic}} party and the oligarchic party. <b>The</b> <b>democrats,</b> supported by the Argives, launched an attack on their opponents, and the oligarchs were driven from the city. These exiles went to the Spartans, based at this time at Sicyon, for support, while the Athenians and Boeotians came up to support <b>the</b> <b>democrats.</b> In a night attack, the Spartans and exiles succeeded in seizing Lechaeum, Corinth's port on the Gulf of Corinth, and defeated the army that came out to challenge them the next day. The anti-Spartan allies then attempted to invest Lechaeum, but the Spartans launched an attack and drove them off.|$|E
50|$|Starr was {{the field}} general for <b>the</b> <b>Democrat</b> during <b>the</b> 13-year-long {{newspaper}} war and wrote scathing commentaries about the Gazette {{on the editorial}} pages of <b>the</b> <b>Democrat.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Democrat</b> adopted a free classified ad program and switched from an afternoon to a morning paper in order to compete directly with the Gazette. The Gazette underwent a long decline and was passed through several owners before being purchased by Hussman in 1991 and folded into <b>the</b> <b>Democrat</b> operation to form the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette.|$|R

5|$|Despite {{his growing}} {{national}} fame, Dow continued to face opposition at home. Both Dow and his opponents engaged in anonymous newspaper campaigns against the other, often making personal attacks alongside political arguments. For the 1852 municipal election, <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> nominated Albion Parris, {{a former governor}} and United States Senator, to run against Dow. While <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> rallied behind their candidate, Dow's vigorous enforcement of prohibition divided his party, and in two wards the Whigs ran an anti-Dow ticket instead. On election day, Dow slightly increased his vote total from the year before, with 1496, but Parris outpolled him, bringing in 1900 votes. Although the Whigs controlled voter registration at the time, Dow blamed his loss on illegal voting by Irish immigrants.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{including}} a Stalwart on the ticket, animosity between the Republican factions carried {{over from the}} convention, and Garfield traveled to New York to meet with party leaders there. After convincing the Stalwart crowd to put aside their differences and unite for the coming campaign, Garfield returned to Ohio, leaving the active campaigning to others, as was traditional at the time. Meanwhile, <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> settled on their nominee, Major General Winfield Scott Hancock of Pennsylvania, a career military officer. Hancock and <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> expected to carry the Solid South, {{while much of the}} North was considered safe territory for Garfield and the Republicans; most of the campaign would involve a few close states, including New York and Indiana.|$|E

Paschall and Gibson, with 71,364 to Pastorius, 41,244 to Paschall, and 10,464 to Gibson. <b>The</b> <b>Democrats</b> nominated Joseph F. Vogt without opposition, {{though he}} had died in April, {{a month before the}} May primary. (Vogt's was the only name on the ballot.) In September, the Democratic City Committee nominated State Representative Granville E. Jones in Vogt's place. For coroner, the nominations followed a similar pattern. The Hamilton-Meade faction nominated Edward E. Holloway, who defeated Meehan man Roger J. Soens and independent Vincent E. Costello for the Republican nomination. <b>The</b> <b>Democrats</b> renominated the incumbent, Joseph Ominsky, over challenger Gust G. Tatlas.|$|E
5|$|For {{the open}} office of {{district}} attorney, vacated by Dilworth {{when he ran}} for mayor, <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> nominated city councilman Victor H. Blanc against the Republicans' Wilhelm F. Knauer. Blanc, a veteran of both World Wars and former assistant district attorney, had been elected to city council in an at-large seat in 1951. During his time on the council, {{he was in charge of}} an investigation into corruption in construction at Philadelphia International Airport. Knauer, a state deputy attorney general, was a long-time Republican party leader. His wife, Virginia Knauer, would later be elected to city council. As in the mayor's race, <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> were victorious, and Blanc was elected. His vote totals led the Democratic ticket, exceeding even Dilworth's numbers.|$|E
5|$|In the 1946 elections, Republicans wrested {{control of}} both houses of Congress from <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> {{for the first time}} since the Great Depression and gained control of the {{majority}} of state governments. The power of labor unions had expanded under Roosevelt and <b>the</b> <b>Democrats,</b> and when a 1946 railroad worker strike exacerbated a post-war recession the Republican majorities â€“ over Barkley's objection â€“ curbed union power via the Taftâ€“Hartley Act. They also passed the Twenty-second Amendment, limiting the president to two terms, a posthumous slap at Roosevelt.|$|E

5|$|Pittsburgh was a Republican stronghold {{starting}} in the 1880s, and the Republican governments provided jobs and assistance for the new immigrants {{in return for their}} votes. But the Great Depression {{starting in}} 1929 ruined the GOP in the city. The Democratic victory of 1932 meant an end to Republican patronage jobs and assistance. As the Depression worsened, Pittsburgh ethnics voted heavily for <b>the</b> <b>Democrats,</b> especially in 1934, making the city a stronghold of the New Deal Coalition. By 1936, Democratic programs for relief and jobs, especially the WPA, were so popular with the ethnics that a large majority voted for <b>the</b> <b>Democrats.</b>|$|E

5|$|Randall's {{defense of}} smaller, less {{centralized}} government raised his profile among House Democrats, and they elevated him to Speaker in 1876. He held that post until <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> {{lost control of}} the House in 1881, and was considered a possible nominee for President in 1880 and 1884. Randall's support for high tariffs began to alienate him from most Democrats, and when that party regained control of the House in 1883, he was denied another term as Speaker. Randall continued to serve in Congress as head of the Appropriations Committee. He remained a respected party leader, but gradually lost influence as <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> became more firmly wedded to free trade. Worsening health also curtailed his power until his death in 1890.|$|E
5|$|Republican Foster A. Dunlap had won {{the office}} in 1953, {{making it one of}} the few his party {{controlled}} in the city. The party renominated him without opposition. Democrat Alexander Hemphill was the organization-backed candidate, and he defeated political outsider George Glick without difficulty. Hemphill, who had worked with reformers in the campaigns that ultimately defeated the Republican organization in 1951, was a lawyer with a long history of involvement in Democratic politics. Unlike in the district attorney's race, <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> were united on the choice for city controller and Clark and Dilworth both publicly endorsed Hemphill. The result was a solid victory for <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> as Hemphill was elected by a thirteen-point margin.|$|E
