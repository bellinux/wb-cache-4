5|$|Richard John Charles Tomlinson (born 13 January 1963) is {{a former}} officer of the British Secret Intelligence Service (MI6). He {{believes}} he was subject to unfair dismissal from MI6 in 1995, and attempted to take his former employer to a tribunal. MI6 refused, arguing that <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> <b>would</b> breach state security, although Tomlinson disputed this reasoning.|$|E
5|$|Under modern {{constitutional}} conventions, {{the sovereign}} acts {{on the advice}} of his or her ministers. Since these ministers most often enjoy the support of parliament and obtain the passage of bills, it is improbable that they would advise the sovereign to withhold assent. Hence, in modern practice, royal assent is always granted; a refusal <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> <b>would</b> be appropriate only in an emergency requiring the use of the monarch's reserve powers.|$|E
5|$|In 1948 Britain's railways, {{and hence}} the canal, were nationalised, and became the {{responsibility}} of the British Transport Commission. In 1963 control of the canal passed to British Waterways. Under the terms of the Transport Act 1968, all waterways within the jurisdiction of British Waterways were classified as commercial, cruising or remainder waterways. Remainder waterways were those that were deemed to have no economic future, and maintenance would only be carried out where failure <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> <b>would</b> create health or safety issues. The Grantham Canal was listed in this latter category.|$|E

5|$|Mary sent William Maitland of Lethington as an {{ambassador}} to the English court to put the case for Mary as the heir presumptive to the English throne. Elizabeth refused to name a potential heir, fearing that <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> <b>would</b> invite conspiracy to displace her with the nominated successor. However, Elizabeth assured Maitland that she knew no one with a better claim than Mary. In late 1561 and early 1562, arrangements were made for the two queens to meet in England at York or Nottingham in August or September 1562, but Elizabeth sent Sir Henry Sidney to cancel in July because {{of the civil war}} in France.|$|E
5|$|On {{returning}} to his bush camp, Wilson sent a further message to the laager, which reached its destination at around 23:00: Napier, Scout Bain and Trooper Robertson were the men acting as runners. Wilson repeated {{that he was going}} to stay north of the river overnight, close to the king, and asked Forbes to bring the whole column across by 04:00 in the morning. Forbes thought it unwise to attempt a full river crossing at night, which he reasoned might lead to his force being surrounded in the darkness and massacred, but also felt he could not recall Wilson, as <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> <b>would</b> be to lose Lobengula for sure.|$|E
5|$|Whitehall's powers over Southern Rhodesia {{under the}} 1923 {{constitution}} were, on paper, considerable; the British Crown was theoretically able to cancel any passed bill within a year, or alter the constitution however it wished. These reserved powers {{were intended to}} protect the indigenous black Africans from discriminatory legislation and to safeguard British commercial interests in the colony, but as Claire Palley comments in her constitutional history of the country, {{it would have been}} extremely difficult for Whitehall to enforce such actions, and attempting <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> <b>would</b> have probably caused a crisis. In the event, they were never exercised. A generally co-operative relationship developed between Whitehall and the colonial government and civil service in Salisbury, and dispute was rare.|$|E

5|$|Hitler {{promoted}} and practised the Führerprinzip. The principle required absolute obedience of all subordinates {{to their}} superiors; thus Hitler viewed the government structure as a pyramid, with himself—the infallible leader—at the apex. Accordingly, Himmler placed {{himself in a}} position of subservience to Hitler, and was unconditionally obedient to him. However, he—like other top Nazi officials—had aspirations to one day succeed Hitler as leader of the Reich. Himmler considered Speer to be an especially dangerous rival, both in the Reich administration and as a potential successor to Hitler. Speer refused to accept Himmler's offer of the high rank of SS-Oberst-Gruppenführer, as he felt <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> <b>would</b> put him in Himmler's debt and obligate him to allow Himmler a say in armaments production.|$|E
5|$|On 20 October, Bazaine's {{infantry}} conducted reconnaissance toward Kherson and met no organized resistance before withdrawing. After {{they returned}} to Kinburn, the French and British commanders determined that the fort could be rebuilt and held through the upcoming winter. A force of 1,700 men was left behind to garrison the position, along with the three ironclad batteries. The rest of the force returned to the Crimea. Though the British had initially considered continuing up the Dneiper to capture Nikolaev, it became clear after the seizure of Kinburn that <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> <b>would</b> require much larger numbers of soldiers to clear the cliffs that dominated the river than had been originally estimated. The British planned to eventually launch an offensive to take Nikolaev in 1856, but the war ended {{before it could be}} begun.|$|E
5|$|Supporters of the {{original}} doctrine of privity {{say that it is}} reasonable not to allow third parties to enforce contracts, arguing that to allow them <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> <b>would</b> hamper the rights of {{the original}} parties in relation to amending or terminating contracts. Another argument put forward is that the doctrine was deliberately retained by judges to protect consumers from exclusion clauses designed to protect third party manufacturers from liability. The general view of academics, however, is that no legal argument has yet been advanced as to why the original doctrine should be good law. Patrick Atiyah argues that the doctrine came from a time of rising trade through middlemen, and was designed to simplify commercial transactions and encourage enterprise liability.|$|E

5|$|On several {{occasions}} {{over the course}} of the trial, the prosecution showed films of the concentration camps and other atrocities. Everyone present, including Göring, found the contents of the films shocking; he said that the films must have been faked. Witnesses, including Paul Koerner and Erhard Milch, tried to portray Göring as a peaceful moderate. Milch stated it had been impossible to oppose Hitler or disobey his orders; <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> <b>would</b> likely have meant death for oneself and one's family. When testifying on his own behalf, Göring emphasised his loyalty to Hitler, and claimed to know nothing about what had happened in the concentration camps, which were under Himmler's control. He gave evasive, convoluted answers to direct questions and had plausible excuses for all his actions during the war. He used the witness stand as a venue to expound at great length on his own role in the Reich, attempting to present himself as a peacemaker and diplomat before the outbreak of the war. During cross-examination, chief prosecutor Robert H. Jackson read out the minutes of a meeting that had been held shortly after Kristallnacht, a major pogrom in November 1938. At the meeting, Göring had plotted to confiscate Jewish property in the wake of the pogrom. Later, David Maxwell-Fyfe proved it was impossible for Göring not to have known about the Stalag Luft III murdersthe shooting of fifty airmen who had been recaptured after escaping from Stalag Luft IIIin time to have prevented the killings. He also presented clear evidence that Göring knew about the extermination of the Hungarian Jews.|$|E
5|$|Winter service {{vehicles}} are operated by both {{government agencies and}} by private subcontractors. Public works in areas which regularly receive snowfall usually maintain a fleet of their own vehicles or pay retainers to contractors for priority access to vehicles in winter, while cities where snow is a less regular occurrence may simply hire the vehicles as needed. Winter {{service vehicles}} in the United Kingdom are the only road-going vehicles entitled to use red diesel. Though the vehicles still use public highways, {{they are used to}} keep the road network operational, and forcing them to pay extra tax <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> <b>would</b> discourage private contractors from assisting with snow removal on public roads. Winter service vehicle drivers in the United States must hold a Class A or Class B commercial driver's license. Although some agencies in some areas, such as the US state of Minnesota, allow winter service vehicle drivers to operate without any extra training, most provide supplemental lessons to drivers to teach them the most effective and safe methods of snow removal. Many require that trainee drivers ride-along with more experienced drivers, and some even operate specially designed driving simulators, which can safely replicate dangerous winter driving conditions. Other organisations require that all staff have a recognised additional licence or certificate—the United Kingdom Highways Agency for example requires that all staff have both a City & Guilds qualification and a supplemental Winter Maintenance Licence.|$|E
