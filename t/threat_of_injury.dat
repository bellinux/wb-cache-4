25|$|The {{taxpayer}} Robert L. Schulz filed motions in {{a federal}} court to quash administrative summonses issued by the IRS seeking testimony and documents in connection with an IRS investigation. The court in Schulz did not rule that a taxpayer {{has a right to}} have the IRS explain why he or she is subject to taxation, and that issue was not presented to the court. The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the dismissal of the taxpayer's motions for a lack of subject matter jurisdiction because there was no actual case or controversy as required by Article III of the Constitution. The court reasoned that the summonses posed no <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> <b>injury</b> to the taxpayer, as the IRS had not yet initiated enforcement proceedings against him. In other words, the taxpayer was not entitled to a court order to quash the summonses until the IRS went to court to demand that he comply with the summons or otherwise face sanctions—something the IRS had not yet done. Once the IRS took that action, the taxpayer would then have ample opportunity to challenge the validity of the summonses.|$|E
2500|$|A Colorado {{grand jury}} had voted in 1999 to indict the parents. The {{indictment}} cited [...] "two counts each of child abuse" [...] {{and said the}} parents [...] "did unlawfully, knowingly, recklessly and feloniously permit a child to be unreasonably placed {{in a situation that}} posed a <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> <b>injury</b> to the child's life or health, which resulted in the death of JonBenét Ramsey, a child under the age of sixteen." [...] Among the experts in the case were DNA specialist Barry Scheck and forensic expert Dr. Henry Lee. On October 13, 1999, Alex Hunter, who was the district attorney at the time, refused to sign the indictment, saying that the evidence was insufficient. This left the impression that the grand jury investigation had been inconclusive. In 2002, the statute of limitations on the charges expired. The indictment was not known publicly until October 25, 2013, when previously sealed court documents were released.|$|E

5000|$|The House bill prohibits {{physical}} restraint except in emergencies {{when there is}} an imminent <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> physical <b>injury</b> and less restrictive measures will not resolve the situation. The Senate bill bars {{physical restraint}} unless there is an immediate <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> serious bodily <b>injury</b> and less restrictive measures will not solve the situation. Both bills would forbid the use of restraint or seclusion for destruction of property, educational disruption, failing to follow instructions, and for coercion, discipline, or in place of proper educational planning. [...] The House bill also forbids seclusion unless there is an immediate <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> physical <b>injury</b> and less restrictive methods will not resolve the situation. The House bill will require staff to continuously visually monitor (watch) children who are confined to seclusion rooms to ensure that they are safe. The Senate bill bans all seclusion of children, which is defined as locking children in rooms or other spaces or blocking the door so they cannot leave (e.g., with furniture).|$|R

Threats can also be made against family or friends of the target—Svetlana Tumanova was told by the KGB that her family in the Soviet Union would be harmed if she did not co-operate, and Ronald Humphrey said that he had helped North Vietnam in order to obtain the release of his Vietnamese wife.|$|R

50|$|Poe v.

50|$|The National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 {{recognized}} the <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> <b>injury</b> and death that vaccines can pose.

If the federal compensation is not sufficient or not granted, this act allowed patients to take legal action for vaccine injuries. This is relevant to drug recalls because a vaccine producer is responsible for reparative damages if their vaccine causes injury and was not recalled.|$|E

40|$|This dispute {{concerns}} {{the imposition of}} a definitive safeguard measure by the United States on imports of circular welded carbon quality line pipe ("line pipe”) from Korea (WTO DOC. WTO/DS 202 /AB/R). The measure was imposed following an investigation conducted by the US International Trade Commission (USITC). The USITC determined in a safeguard investigation initiated on 29 July 1999 that "circular welded carbon quality line pipe... is being imported into the United States in such increased quantities as to be a substantial cause <b>of</b> serious <b>injury</b> or the <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> serious <b>injury.</b> ” In its investigation, the USITC identified a number of factors apart from increased imports that might have caused serious <b>injury</b> or <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> serious <b>injury</b> to the domestic line pipe industry.

50|$|On April 15, 2005, the Canadian Minister of Trade, Jim Peterson, {{announced}} {{that the federal government}} would provide Canadian softwood lumber associations with $20 million in compensation for their legal expenses stemming from the dispute with the United States. That same year, another NAFTA Chapter 19 panel reviewed a determination made by the USITC that the U.S. lumber industry was under a <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> <b>injury</b> due to Canadian imports. Since the United States ceded jurisdiction to the World Trade Organization, it was necessary for the U.S. government to establish that a domestic industry was suffering injury, or faced a <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> <b>injury,</b> before countervailing duties can be imposed. The NAFTA panel found the USITC's determination invalid. In addition, the panel made the controversial decision to deny the USITC to reopen the administrative record, ordering the USITC to issue a negative determination based on the existing record. Unlike the panel during the Lumber III stage, this panel's decision was unanimous. However, the U.S. government challenged its decision before an extraordinary challenge committee, which, on August 10, 2005, issued a unanimous decision against the United States, finding that the NAFTA panel's determination was not sufficiently invalid to require vacatur or remand, under the standards of NAFTA.|$|E
50|$|Caveat: the book's {{conclusions}} do {{not hold}} for terrorism in general (8-9). Pape distinguishes among demonstrative terrorism, which seeks publicity, destructive terrorism, which seeks to exert coercion through the <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> <b>injury</b> and death {{as well as to}} mobilize support, and suicide terrorism, which involves an attacker's actually killing himself or herself along with others, generally as part of a campaign (9-11). Three historical episodes are introduced for purposes of comparison: the ancient Jewish Zealots (11-12; see also 33-34), the 11th-12th-century Ismaili Assassins (12-13; see also 34-35), and the Japanese kamikazes (13; see also 35-37).|$|E

On August 11 of that same year, the Appellate Body issued a final ruling with respect to U.S. anti-dumping duties (WTO Dispute 264). In the meantime, because of an adverse WTO decision, the USITC reopened the administrative record, pursuant to a special provision in U.S. law, and issued a new affirmative <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> <b>injury</b> determination in December 2004. This new determination allowed the countervailing and anti-dumping duty tariffs to remain in place.|$|E

50|$|A quarterback keeper or keeper in American {{football}} is a designed play {{in which the}} quarterback does not pass or hand off the ball to another player and instead rushes forward with it {{in an effort to}} gain yardage. The play typically is run in instances where only a few yards are needed to gain a first down or touchdown, due to the <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> <b>injury</b> to the quarterback and most quarterbacks' ineffectiveness at running the ball when compared with a running back or fullback. This play differs from a quarterback scramble in that a scramble is an improvised play, while the keeper is a designed running play.|$|E
