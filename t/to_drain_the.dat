5|$|At E3 2012, Nintendo {{introduced}} the Wii U launch title Nintendo Land, which hosts Luigi's Ghost Mansion, a multiplayer minigame based on Luigi's Mansion. In this minigame, four players controlling Miis {{dressed up as}} Mario, Luigi, Wario and Waluigi have <b>to</b> <b>drain</b> <b>the</b> energy of a ghost, while the GamePad player, controlling the ghost, must make all the other players faint before time runs out.|$|E
5|$|In 1941 the Oval {{was bombed}} in the Belfast blitz, {{destroying}} both grandstands and leaving a crater in the pitch. As a result, {{the ground was}} flooded repeatedly by the Connswater River; the water pumps were insufficient <b>to</b> <b>drain</b> <b>the</b> pitch. Grosvenor Park {{was used as a}} temporary home for Glentoran, until August 1949. In 1953 the main grandstand was built.|$|E
5|$|Collins and his {{partners}} brought in slaves from Africa to dig a canal from Lake Phelps to the Scuppernong River. The canal served two purposes: first, {{as a means of}} transporting goods and people to and from the plantation; and second, it served as a massive drainage ditch as the slaves of Somerset Place worked <b>to</b> <b>drain</b> <b>the</b> surrounding swamps. Later, the canal system was expanded to provide irrigation for the rice and corn fields of the plantation.|$|E
5000|$|In {{order to}} deal with puddles, roads and {{pavements}} are often built with a camber (technically called 'crowning'), being slightly [...] in nature, to force puddles <b>to</b> <b>drain</b> into <b>the</b> gutter, which has storm <b>drain</b> grates <b>to</b> allow <b>the</b> water <b>to</b> <b>drain</b> into <b>the</b> sewers. In addition, some surfaces are made to be porous, allowing <b>the</b> water <b>to</b> <b>drain</b> through <b>the</b> surface <b>to</b> the aquifer below.|$|R
5000|$|In South America, the Continental Divide of the Americas lies {{along the}} Andes, from Lácar Lake and south there are {{numerous}} lakes on the eastern slopes that <b>drains</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Pacific, crossing the line of highest peaks. These lakes in Patagonia are moraine-dammed streams that used <b>to</b> <b>drain</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Atlantic rather than the Pacific before the Pleistocene glaciations.|$|R

The North Branch Potomac River watershed encompasses the southwestern and eastern {{portions of the}} ridge.|$|R
5|$|During his 1904campaign to {{be elected}} governor, Napoleon Bonaparte Broward promised <b>to</b> <b>drain</b> <b>the</b> Everglades, and his later {{projects}} were more effective than Disston's. Broward's promises sparked a land boom facilitated by blatant errors in an engineer's report, pressure from real estate developers, and the burgeoning tourist industry throughout south Florida. The increased population brought hunters who went unchecked and had a devastating impact on the numbers of wading birds (hunted for their plumes), alligators, and other Everglades animals.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{completion}} of the dam, the entrances to the two outer diversion tunnels were sealed at the opening and halfway through the tunnels with large concrete plugs. The downstream halves of the tunnels following the inner plugs are now the main bodies of the spillway tunnels. The inner diversion tunnels were plugged at approximately one-third of their length, beyond which they now carry steel pipes connecting the intake towers to the power plant and outlet works. The inner tunnels' outlets are equipped with gates that can be closed <b>to</b> <b>drain</b> <b>the</b> tunnels for maintenance.|$|E
5|$|Humans {{have lived}} for {{thousands}} of years in or around the Everglades. Plans arose in 1882 <b>to</b> <b>drain</b> <b>the</b> wetlands and develop the land for agricultural and residential use. As the 20th century progressed, water flow from Lake Okeechobee was increasingly controlled and diverted to enable explosive growth of the South Florida metropolitan area. The park was established in 1934, to protect the quickly vanishing Everglades, and dedicated in 1947, as major canal building projects were initiated across South Florida. The ecosystems in Everglades National Park have suffered significantly from human activity, and restoration of the Everglades is a politically charged issue in South Florida.|$|E

50|$|In 1902 Moreno was {{appointed}} Perito (a technical specialist or expert), in which capacity he disproved Chilean {{claims to the}} continental divide in the Southern Cone. Moreno proved that many Patagonian lakes <b>draining</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Pacific Ocean {{were part of the}} Atlantic Ocean basin. During the quaternary glaciations, they had become dammed by moraines, which changed their outlets <b>to</b> <b>drain</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> west and Chilean territory.|$|R
5|$|Since {{the early}} 19th century the Everglades {{have been a}} subject of {{interest}} for agricultural development. The first attempt <b>to</b> <b>drain</b> <b>the</b> Everglades occurred in 1882 when a Pennsylvania land developer named Hamilton Disston constructed the first canals. Though these attempts were largely unsuccessful, Disston's purchase of land spurred tourism and real estate development of the state. The political motivations of Governor Napoleon Bonaparte Broward resulted in more successful attempts at canal construction between 1906 and 1920. Recently reclaimed wetlands were used for cultivating sugarcane and vegetables, while urban development began in the Everglades.|$|E
5|$|Tennessee's post-touchdown kickoff was {{returned}} to the Tech 33-yard line, but Virginia Tech decided to not run an inconsequential play <b>to</b> <b>drain</b> <b>the</b> final seconds from the clock and enter halftime. On the first play after the kickoff, Taylor threw a surprise pass downfield to Boykin, who was tackled at the Tennessee four-yard line. Instant replay revealed there were two seconds remaining on the game clock after the play, and Virginia Tech placekicker Matt Waldron came onto the field to complete a 21-yard field goal as time expired. The Hokies thus regained a 17-14 lead at halftime.|$|E
5|$|The English Great Horse was valued {{during the}} reign of Henry VIII, when stallions {{measuring}} less than 'fifteen handfuls' could not be kept, but the increasing role of gunpowder brought an end to the use of heavy horses in battle. Oliver Cromwell's cavalry favoured lighter, faster mounts and the big horses began to be used for draught work instead. During the 16th century, Dutch engineers brought Friesian horses with them when they came to England <b>to</b> <b>drain</b> <b>the</b> fens, and these horses probably had a significant influence on what became the Shire breed.|$|E

50|$|In {{response}} to flooding on the Derwent in 1799, a river was carved out from Mowthorpe to Scalby which allows floodwaters <b>to</b> <b>drain</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sea, thereby sparing the riverside further downstream. The Sea Cut, {{as it is}} known, was completed in 1804 and roughly follows the route that waters used <b>to</b> <b>drain</b> eastwards towards <b>the</b> sea before the last Ice Age and the Derwent river headed inland.|$|R
25|$|Houston, often popularly {{referred}} to as the Bayou City, is crossed by a number of slow-moving, swampy rivers, which are essential <b>to</b> <b>draining</b> <b>the</b> region's broad floodplains. The city was founded at the convergence of Buffalo Bayou and White Oak Bayou, a point today known as Allen's Landing.|$|R
5|$|The {{river is}} a {{highland}} carrier, {{as it is}} embanked and the water level is often higher than the land through which it flows. Water from the surrounding countryside does not therefore drain into the river naturally, and drainage schemes have relied on pumping to remove the water. The pumping station at Westonzoyland was built in 1830, the first mechanical pumping station on the Somerset Levels. It was designed <b>to</b> <b>drain</b> <b>the</b> area around Westonzoyland, Middlezoy and Othery, {{and the success of}} the drainage system {{led to the formation of}} Internal drainage boards and the construction of other pumping stations.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{hurricane}} and the widespread destruction, {{the hurricane}} caused outbreaks of malaria, dengue, cholera, and various fever and respiratory illnesses. Ongoing flooding caused {{an outbreak of}} Leptospirosis, notably in Cortés Department. There were widespread food and water shortages, leaving villagers near-starvation. Damaged crops also prevented the export of cash crops, and exports decreased by 9.4% in 1999. Many of the people left homeless also became unemployed, and there were reductions in exports and economic growth. Officials set up shelters that housed 285,000people for about a month. In Tegucigalpa, where the Choluteca River was dammed by a landslide, a temporary lagoon filled with sewage persisted for about two months, until a crew from the United States Army Corps of Engineers and United States Geological Survey dug a channel <b>to</b> <b>drain</b> <b>the</b> water.|$|E
5|$|There {{are about}} 30 ponds in the park. Some– {{including}} Barn Wood Pond, Bishop's Pond, Gallows Pond, Leg of Mutton Pond, Martin's Pond and White Ash Pond– {{have been created}} <b>to</b> <b>drain</b> <b>the</b> land or to provide water for livestock. The Pen Ponds (which in the past were used to rear carp for food) date from 1746. They were formed when a trench was dug in the early 17th century to drain a boggy area; later in that century this was widened and deepened by the extraction of gravel for local building. The Ponds now take in water from streams flowing from the higher ground around them and release it to Beverley Brook. Beverley Brook and the two Pen Ponds are most visible areas {{of water in the}} park.|$|E

5|$|With {{the death}} of her mother-in-law, Queen Victoria, in 1901, Alexandra became queen-empress consort to the new king. Just two months later, her son George and daughter-in-law Mary left on an {{extensive}} tour of the empire, leaving their young children in the care of Alexandra and Edward, who doted on their grandchildren. On George's return, preparations for Edward and Alexandra's coronation in Westminster Abbey were well in hand but just {{a few days before the}} scheduled coronation in June 1902 the king became seriously ill with appendicitis. Alexandra deputised for him at a military parade, and attended the Royal Ascot races without him, in an attempt to prevent public alarm. Eventually, the coronation had to be postponed and Edward had an operation performed by Frederick Treves of the London Hospital <b>to</b> <b>drain</b> <b>the</b> infected appendix. After his recovery, Alexandra and Edward were crowned together in August: he by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Frederick Temple, and she by the Archbishop of York, William Dalrymple Maclagan.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of efforts to control water {{resources}} in Florida and projects <b>to</b> <b>drain</b> <b>the</b> Everglades during the early and mid-20th century, water flow into Biscayne Bay has been altered by the construction of canals. These canals channel water from portions of the southeastern Everglades now used for agriculture into the bay. Prior to canal construction, most fresh water inflow came from rain and groundwater, but the canals are now altering the salinity profile of the bay, conveying sediment and pollutants and leading to saltwater intrusion into the Biscayne aquifer. The Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) was established in 2000 to mitigate the effects of human intervention into the natural water flow of the Everglades. Primarily aimed at the restoration of historical patterns of water flow into Everglades National Park, the project will also deal with issues arising from the diversion of {{water out of the}} southern Everglades into Biscayne Bay. The Biscayne Bay Coastal Wetlands Project (BBCW) is a CERP component specifically intended to redistribute water flow so that fresh water is introduced gradually through creeks and marshes rather than short, heavy discharges through drainage canals.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the Taiwan flooding in Kaohsiung, officials deployed 7,888troops to the southern portion of the island to assist in rescue and recovery work. Soldiers also set up five medical centers, and utilized amphibious vehicles to rescue people in flooded areas. Taiwan's president Ma Ying-jeou toured the flooded regions on September23, emphasizing that efforts <b>to</b> <b>drain</b> <b>the</b> flooding should be the main priority. More than 100buildings in Kaohsiung required water pumps and thousands of volunteers to remove standing water from basements and streets. The mayor Kiku Chen temporarily suspended her reelection campaign due to the floods. About 80% of the factories in Kaohsiung were reopened by September21. The high crop damage allowed farmers to qualify for low interest loans. Rail lines took two weeks to reopen due to damage. Power and water service was restored {{within days of the}} storm, although residents in flooded areas were advised to boil water before usage. There was also an increase in dengue fever after the floods. The Red Cross Society of China donated about US$100,000 {{in the days after the}} storm. The government announced on September20 that families affected by the floods would receive NT$30,000 (US$945.92) per house. Throughout Taiwan, exports during September 2010 decreased 6.9% from August's levels due to the storm and an industrial fire.|$|E

5|$|Lisa imagines she and all {{the other}} Springfield Elementary {{students}} are Hebrews in ancient Egypt, with the Pharaoh (Principal Skinner) making them build a pyramid. Only Moses (Milhouse) can liberate the Hebrews. When Bart defaces the Pharaoh's sarcophagus, supposedly incited by the burning bush, he gets the other students punished. Lisa helps Milhouse produce plagues to scare the Pharaoh into freeing the Israelites; they fail. This in turn gets Lisa and Milhouse thrown in a Pyramid prison. When they escape, Milhouse gathers all the students and they attempt to leave. When they reach the sea, Lisa has an idea to get across: They simultaneously flush all the Egyptians' toilets <b>to</b> <b>drain</b> <b>the</b> sea. As they cross, the Pharaoh and his guards follow, but the water fills the sea back up and swallows them. They enjoy splashing each other, and then return to the shore. Pleased that they have escaped, Milhouse asks Lisa what the future holds for the Israelites, but Lisa disappoints Milhouse when she says that they have to wander the desert for forty years. Milhouse then asks if {{it is going to be}} smooth sailing for the Jews after that. Rather than disappoint Milhouse again with news of the ongoing anti-Semitism that will plague the Jews for many centuries, she distracts the crowd by sending them to search for manna.|$|E
5|$|The English {{attacked}} the Temple Gate {{on the first}} day but were beaten off. Over the next three days the city gates were attacked simultaneously, without success. Before {{the end of the first}} week of the siege, reinforcements arrived to completely encircle the city walls and the outer ditch was breached using soil. On the eighth day (15 June) Despenser {{attacked the}} defences with artillery, firing on the Messines Gate and damaging it, but not enough to cause the city defences to be breached. Over the following days of the siege, sustained artillery attacks had little overall effect and the assaults of Despenser's troops were all beaten off. An attempt <b>to</b> <b>drain</b> <b>the</b> ditches seriously threatened the Yprois, but the attempt was unsuccessful and the besieged managed to communicate with the Duke of Burgundy through Louis le Mâle, who was able to raise a large French army to come to the aid of the city. On 8 August, after eight weeks of effort, Despenser abruptly decided to abandon the siege, leaving his allies to continue on their own.|$|E
