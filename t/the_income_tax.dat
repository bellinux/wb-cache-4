He also worked toward the elimination of taxation on tea, coffee, cigars, and matches, all of which Randall believed fell disproportionately on the poor. Relief from taxation made these items cheaper for the average American, while increasing reliance on tariffs helped the industrial owners and workers in Randall's district, as it made foreign products more expensive.|$|E

5|$|Since the FairTax {{would not}} tax used goods, {{some critics have}} argued that this would create a {{differential}} between the price of new and used goods, which may take years to equalize.

Conversely, {{it is argued that}} like <b>the</b> <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> system that contains embedded tax cost (see Theories of retail pricing), used goods would contain the embedded FairTax cost. While the FairTax would not be applied to the retail sales of used goods, the inherent value of a used good includes the taxes paid when the good was sold at retail. The value is determined by the supply and demand in relation to new goods. The price differential / margins between used and new goods should stay consistent, as the cost and value of used goods are in direct relationship to the cost and value of the new goods.|$|E

Most proposals for a VAT in the United States call for part, or all, of the resulting revenue {{to be used to}} reduce other taxes.

It should also be used to eliminate the Medicare component of the payroll and self-employment taxes. Replacement of the Social Security component of those taxes should be avoided, however, because {{it would be difficult to}} reconcile with the current design of the Social Security system.

40|$|This Article {{challenges}} recent {{attempts by}} influential scholars to rationalize {{the existence of}} <b>the</b> corporate <b>income</b> <b>tax.</b> <b>The</b> corporate <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> has long been considered unjustifiable on traditional tax policy grounds. The new justifications recognize this, yet argue that the tax is still desirable because it promotes other goals, such as improvement of corporate governance and restraint of undesirable corporate management power accumulation. This Article demonstrates that the existence and magnitude of these alleged benefits of <b>the</b> corporate <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> are doubtful. Yet, the Article argues, even if taken as correct, the recent rationalization of <b>the</b> corporate <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> cannot support its retention, since it misses certain crucial steps in the analysis. First, the rationalization does not compare the effects of <b>the</b> corporate <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> with its alternatives. This Article demonstrates that once such comparison takes place, <b>the</b> corporate <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> proves to be less desirable than its alternative on the very grounds promoted by its proponents. Secondly, the support of <b>the</b> corporate <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> completely ignores <b>the</b> social costs of the tax. This Article argues that once taken into account, such costs may overwhelm the alleged benefits, if any. Finally, the Article claims that the recent support of <b>the</b> corporate <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> {{is based on a}} strong, yet unproven, popular intuition that the tax is fair. The Article goes on to explain the uncertainty that governs the economic analysis of the burden of the tax, which results in confusion and the inability to assess the fairness of the tax as a whole. This understanding should pull the carpet from underneath the very basis of the arguments in support of <b>the</b> corporate <b>income</b> <b>tax.</b> <b>The</b> Article concludes by asserting that the tax not only should, but also could, be repealed consistent with accepted tax policy principles...|$|R
