30|$|An {{analysis}} of support by interviewed farmers identified some minor differences, which {{were statistically significant}} at p <  0.05. Namely, of <b>the</b> <b>interviewers</b> who interacted only with rain-fed farmers, two (interviewers # 10 and # 14) reported five farmers who did not receive support while <b>the</b> other five <b>interviewers</b> identified either one or none of their respondents who reported an absence of support. With respect to <b>the</b> <b>interviewers</b> who interacted {{with a mix of}} rain-fed and irrigation farmers, two (interviewers # 8 and # 14) reported 14 and 9 farmers respectively without aid while <b>the</b> remaining five <b>interviewers</b> reported two or fewer farmers without any acknowledged aid. In total, only 40 of the 466 farmers interviewed reported that they did not receive support of any kind. The similarities in these observations suggest that interviewers, on average, were quite consistent with the types of responses they received, an indication that either all of <b>the</b> <b>interviewers</b> or none of <b>the</b> <b>interviewers</b> introduced bias into the farmers’ responses.|$|R
5|$|The {{assassination}} attempt was especially difficult for Jodie Foster, who was hounded relentlessly {{by the media}} during 1981 because she was Hinckley's target of obsession.

5|$|Kohlberg {{established}} the Moral Judgement Interview in his original 1958 dissertation. During the roughly 45-minute tape recorded semi-structured interview, <b>the</b> <b>interviewer</b> uses moral dilemmas {{to determine which}} stage of moral reasoning a person uses. The dilemmas are fictional short stories that describe situations {{in which a person}} has to make a moral decision. The participant is asked a systemic series of open-ended questions, like what they think the right course of action is, as well as justifications as to why certain actions are right or wrong. The form and structure of these replies are scored and not the content; over a set of multiple moral dilemmas an overall score is derived.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Jenna {{gets into}} trouble after she is misquoted in Maxim magazine, {{allegedly}} {{saying that she}} hates the troops.

During the interview, Jenna confuses Osama bin Laden and then-Senator Barack Obama, who was running for the Democratic Party nomination for President.

Multilevel models show that more educated respondents are affected to a slightly higher extent and that <b>the</b> <b>interviewer's</b> experience is also a factor. There is no difference between different respondent subgroups or when both interviewers and respondents share the same socio-demographic characteristics.

5|$|Remaining at Rhodes {{during the}} 1940 {{academic}} year, Smith secretly {{made plans to}} leave for military service {{in spite of his}} instructions to finish studying. In June 1940, during the mid-year break from studies, he quietly travelled to the Southern Rhodesian capital, Salisbury, to tell the colony's director of manpower, William Addison, that he wanted to join the air force; to avoid being barred from enlistment, Smith did not mention his university attendance, and gave his Selukwe address. During his Christmas vacation at the end of 1940, Smith went to Salisbury again, and was successful in a second interview with an air force official and a physical examination. Early in 1941, having received his pilot course call-up papers, Smith underwent a final interview, during which it emerged that he was a university student; <b>the</b> <b>interviewer</b> briefly demurred, but accepted Smith when he insisted that he wanted to sign up.|$|E

When Zainab has a job interview, AJ tells <b>the</b> <b>interviewer</b> she has short-term memory loss. However, when he apologises via a Post-It note, she returns the apology. AJ supports Masood when his relationship with Zainab ends.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we examine the}} impact of <b>the</b> <b>interviewer’s</b> gender on respondents’ {{self-reported}} share of housework in telephone interviews. Due to a discrepancy between modern, egalitarian gender roles dominating public discussion and men’s marginal participation in housework we expect male respondents to answer in a socially desirable way and exaggerate their share of housework vis à vis female <b>interviewers.</b> At <b>the</b> same time, we assume that female respondents underreport their contribution to the couple’s housework to female <b>interviewers.</b> <b>The</b> effects of <b>the</b> <b>interviewer’s</b> gender should be less strong in case of female respondents than in case of male respondents, though. Additionally, theory suggests that young and educated respondents are particularly susceptible to effects of <b>the</b> <b>interviewer’s</b> gender as they are most aware of egalitarian gender roles due to their socialization and environment. For male respondents the results are largely consistent with the expectations. However, the effect of <b>the</b> <b>interviewer’s</b> gender varies stronger by age than by education. Regarding female respondents the results do not indicate any significant effects across age groups and educational degrees. Overall, the results show that social desirability may also bias self-reports of everyday behaviour. Moreover, interviewer effects vary considerably between different social groups...|$|R

40|$|Aim: To {{share the}} {{experience}} of working with people with intellectual disabilities (ID) as interviewers in a qualitative study about community participation of people with ID. We reflect on two perspectives: <b>the</b> <b>interviewers</b> and <b>the</b> researchers. Method: Eighteen people with ID were interviewed by their peers about participation. All interviews were transcribed verbatim and results and experiences were discussed in a focus group with <b>the</b> <b>interviewers</b> and workers of a self-advocacy group. Results: Using trained peer interviewers can help people with ID in sharing meaningful experiences and can {{improve the quality of}} research. <b>The</b> <b>interviewers</b> provided a safe environment and were likely to understand or to be understood by the respondents, as they share common experiences. In addition, first results show that <b>the</b> <b>interviewers</b> have personally benefitted from participation in research in terms of increased self-confidence, improved communication skills and expanded friendships. Interviewers with ID are able to perform well under the right conditions (e. g. opportunities to practice, clear information, and an adequate and flexible approach). Conclusions: Actively involving people with ID in research, armed with good training, adds value to the richness and relevance of research findings. It also increases the visibility and empowerment of persons with ID...|$|R
