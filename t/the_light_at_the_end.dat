5|$|And so matters stood {{until the}} massive PAVN/NLF Tet Offensive of early 1968. Although a {{tactical}} victory for American and South Vietnamese forces, Tet became a political disaster. The American public (who had been reassured by President Lyndon B.

The president, {{in an attempt to}} nudge Hanoi to the negotiating table, decreed an end to bombing operations in North Vietnam north of the 20th parallel, effectively ending Rolling Thunder on 11 November 1968.|$|E

The Eighth Doctor and Charley meet up with the Fourth Doctor (Tom Baker) and Leela (Louise Jameson), the Fifth Doctor (Peter Davison) and Nyssa (Sarah Sutton), the Sixth Doctor (Colin Baker) and Peri and the Seventh Doctor (Sylvester McCoy) and Ace (Sophie Aldred), and working together (along with the First Doctor (William Russell), Second Doctor (Frazer Hines) and Third Doctor (Tim Treloar)), manage to break free of the Master's trap and prevent time from being rewritten so that the Doctor would never have left Gallifrey. Companions Susan (Carole Ann Ford), Ian Chesterton (William Russell), Vicki (Maureen O'Brien), Steven Taylor (Peter Purves), Sara Kingdom (Jean Marsh), Polly (Anneke Wills), Jamie McCrimmon (Frazer Hines), Zoe Heriot (Wendy Padbury), Jo Grant (Katy Manning), Tegan Jovanka (Janet Fielding) and Turlough (Mark Strickson) also made appearances in the audio drama.|$|E

[...] Morrison described it as [...] "one of those songs {{where you can see}} <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of the tunnel... I don't think I can elaborate on it any more than that." [...] The words in the song: [...] "Talkin' to Huddie Ledbetter/Showin' pictures on the wall" [...] appear to be based on Morrison's real life custom of carrying around a poster of Lead Belly and hanging it on the wall wherever he lived. (This was revealed in a Rolling Stone interview in 1978.) ...|$|E
