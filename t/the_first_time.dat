International Journal of Computer Mathematics, 88 (1), 37 - 50 For the global optimization problems with continuous variables, evolutionary algorithms (EAs) {{are often used}} to find the approximate solutions. The number of generations for an EA to find the approximate solutions, called <b>the</b> <b>first</b> hitting <b>time,</b> is an important index to measure {{the performance of the}} EA. However, calculating <b>the</b> <b>first</b> hitting <b>time</b> is still difficult in theory. This paper proposes some new drift conditions that are used to estimate the upper bound of <b>the</b> <b>first</b> hitting <b>times</b> of EAs for finding the approximate solutions.
