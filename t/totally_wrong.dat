60|$|The lady patroness of Michaelis, the ticket-of-leave apostle of {{humanitarian}} hopes, {{was one of}} the most influential and distinguished connections of the Assistant Commissioner’s wife, whom she called Annie, and treated still rather as a not very wise and utterly inexperienced young girl. But she had consented to accept him on a friendly footing, which was by no means the case with all of his wife’s influential connections. Married young and splendidly at some remote epoch of the past, she had had for a time a close view of great affairs and even of some great men. She herself was a great lady. Old now in the number of her years, she had that sort of exceptional temperament which defies time with scornful disregard, as if it were a rather vulgar convention submitted to by the mass of inferior mankind. Many other conventions easier to set aside, alas! failed to obtain her recognition, also on temperamental grounds—either because they bored her, or else because they stood in the way of her scorns and sympathies. Admiration was a sentiment unknown to her (it {{was one of the}} secret griefs of her most noble husband against her)—first, as always more or less tainted with mediocrity, and next as being in a way an admission of inferiority. And both were frankly inconceivable to her nature. To be fearlessly outspoken in her opinions came easily to her, since she judged solely from the standpoint of her social position. She was equally untrammelled in her actions; and as her tactfulness proceeded from genuine humanity, her bodily vigour remained remarkable and her superiority was serene and cordial, three generations had admired her infinitely, and the last she was likely to see had pronounced her a wonderful woman. Meantime intelligent, with a sort of lofty simplicity, and curious at heart, but not like many women merely of social gossip, she amused her age by attracting within her ken through the power of her great, almost historical, social prestige everything that rose above the dead level of mankind, lawfully or unlawfully, by position, wit, audacity, fortune or misfortune. Royal Highnesses, artists, men of science, young statesmen, and charlatans of all ages and conditions, who, unsubstantial and light, bobbing up like corks, show best the direction of the surface currents, had been welcomed in that house, listened to, penetrated, understood, appraised, for her own edification. In her own words, she liked to watch what the world was coming to. And as she had a practical mind her judgment of men and things, though based on special prejudices, was seldom <b>totally</b> <b>wrong,</b> and almost never wrong-headed. Her drawing-room was probably the only place in the wide world where an Assistant Commissioner of Police could meet a convict liberated on a ticket-of-leave on other than professional and official ground. Who had brought Michaelis there one afternoon the Assistant Commissioner did not remember very well. He had a notion it must have been a certain Member of Parliament of illustrious parentage and unconventional sympathies, which were the standing joke of the comic papers. The notabilities and even the simple notorieties of the day brought each other freely to that temple of an old woman’s not ignoble curiosity. You never could guess whom you were likely to come upon being received in semi-privacy within the faded blue silk and gilt frame screen, making a cosy nook for a couch and a few arm-chairs in the great drawing-room, with its hum of voices and the groups of people seated or standing in the light of six tall windows.|$|E

It is difficult to analyze the nature of the reluctance with which either a writer or painter takes it upon him to explain the meaning of his own work, even in cases where, without such explanation, it must in a measure remain always disputable: but I am persuaded that this reluctance is, in most instances, carried too far; and that, wherever there really is a serious purpose in a book or a picture, the author does wrong who, either in modesty or vanity (both feelings have their share in producing the dislike of personal interpretation), trusts entirely to the patience and intelligence of the readers or spectators to penetrate into their significance. At all events, I will, as far as possible, spare such trouble with respect to these volumes, by stating here, finally and clearly, both what they intend and what they contain; and this the rather because I have lately noticed, with some surprise, certain reviewers announcing as a discovery, what I thought had lain palpably on the surface of the book, namely, that [...] "if Mr. Ruskin be right, all the architects, and all the architectural teaching of the last three hundred years, must have been wrong."

40|$|Vehicle {{dynamics}} is {{a fascinating}} subject, {{but it can also}} be very frustrating without the tools to truly understand it. We can try to rely on experience, but an objective knowledge needs a scientific approach. Something grounded on significant mathematical models, that is models complex enough to catch the essence of the phenomena under investigation, yet simple enough to be understood by a (well trained) human being. This is the essence of science, and vehicle dynamics is no exception. But the really important point is in the mental attitude we should have in approaching a problem. We must be skeptical. We must be critical. We must be creative. Even if something is commonly accepted as obviously true, or if it looks very reasonable, it may be <b>wrong,</b> either <b>totally</b> or partially <b>wrong.</b> There might be room for some sort of improvement, for a fresh point of view, for something valuable. Vehicle dynamics can be set as a truly scientific subject, it actually needs to be set as such to achieve a deep comprehension of what is going on when, e. g., a race car negotiates a bend. When approached with open mind, several classical concepts of vehicle dynamics, like, e. g., the roll axis, the understeer gradient, even the wheelbase, turn out to be very weak concepts indeed. Concepts often misunderstood, and hence misused. Concepts that need to be revisited and redefined, and reformulated to achieve an objective knowledge of vehicle dynamics. Therefore, even experienced people will probably be surprised by how some topics are addressed and discussed here. To formulate vehicle dynamics on sound concepts we must rely on clear definitions and model formulations, and then on a rigorous mathematical analysis. We must, indeed, “formulate” the problem at hand by means of mathematical formulæ [4]. There is no way out. Nothing is more practical than a good theory. However, although we will not refrain from using formulæ, at the same time we will keep the analysis as simple as possible, trying to explain what each formula tells us.
