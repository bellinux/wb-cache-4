5|$|In statistics, maximum spacing {{estimation}} (MSE or MSP), or maximum {{product of}} spacing estimation (MPS), {{is a method}} for estimating the parameters of a univariate statistical model.

5|$|According to Di Tella and Zymelman (1967), {{the main}} {{difference}} between Argentina and other settler societies such as Australia and Canada was its failure to seek adequate alternatives to compensate for the end of geographical expansion with the definitive closing of the frontier.

5|$|As a hominid brain, {{the human}} brain is {{substantially}} enlarged even {{in comparison to the}} brain of a typical monkey. The sequence of human evolution from Australopithecus (four million years ago) to Homo sapiens (modern man) was marked by a steady increase in brain size. As brain size increased, this altered {{the size and shape of}} the skull, from about 600 cm3 in Homo habilis to an average of about 1520cm3 in Homo neanderthalensis. Differences in DNA, gene expression and gene–environment interactions help explain <b>the</b> <b>differences</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> function of {{the human brain}} and other primates.|$|E
5|$|As {{intriguing}} as geometric Newtonian gravity may be, its basis, classical mechanics, {{is merely}} a limiting case of (special) relativistic mechanics. In the language of symmetry: where gravity can be neglected, physics is Lorentz invariant as in special relativity rather than Galilei invariant as in classical mechanics. (The defining symmetry of special relativity is the Poincaré group, which includes translations, rotations and boosts.) <b>The</b> <b>differences</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> two become significant when dealing with speeds approaching the speed of light, and with high-energy phenomena.|$|E

5|$|Brachiopods are shelled {{marine organisms}} that superficially resembled {{bivalves}} {{in that they}} are of similar size and have a hinged shell in two parts. However, brachiopods evolved from a very different ancestral line, and the resemblance to bivalves only arose because of a similar lifestyle. <b>The</b> <b>differences</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> two groups are due to their separate ancestral origins. Different initial structures have been adapted to solve the same problems, a case of convergent evolution. In modern times, brachiopods are not as common as bivalves.|$|E
5|$|Dalton also {{believed}} atomic theory {{could explain why}} water absorbs different gases in different proportions. For example, he found that water absorbs carbon dioxide far better than it absorbs nitrogen. Dalton hypothesized {{this was due to}} <b>the</b> <b>differences</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> masses and configurations of the gases' respective particles, and carbon dioxide molecules (CO2) are heavier and larger than nitrogen molecules (N2).|$|E
5|$|In 1600, as Russia was {{entering}} {{a period of}} instability, the Commonwealth proposed a union with the Russian state. This failed move was followed by many other similarly unsuccessful, often adventurous attempts, some involving military invasions, other dynastic and diplomatic manipulations and scheming. While <b>the</b> <b>differences</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> two societies and empires proved in the end too formidable to overcome, the Polish–Lithuanian state ended up in 1619, after the Truce of Deulino, with the greatest ever expansion of its territory.

30|$|The large {{impact of}} the {{manufacturing}} phase of the insulation materials is demonstrated.

But <b>the</b> direct relation <b>between</b> <b>the</b> optimum thickness rate and the cost rates {{does not have a}} large dependence on the optimization point of view. In fact, trends obtained for the three views are closer. <b>The</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> trend line and the real values comes from the thermal properties of the insulation materials.|$|R
