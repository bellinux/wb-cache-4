5|$|Between April 1947 and December 1948, when George C. Marshall was Secretary of State, Kennan {{was more}} {{influential}} {{than he was}} at any other period in his career. Marshall valued his strategic sense and had him create and direct what is now named the Policy Planning Staff, the State Department's internal think tank. Kennan became the first Director of Policy Planning. Marshall relied heavily on him to prepare policy recommendations.

5|$|Crittenden {{ordered the}} {{refurbishing}} {{of the state}} penitentiary, which had been damaged by a fire, and called for an extensive state geological survey. He also advised {{the creation of a}} sinking fund to retire the state's debt. The state adopted a new constitution during Crittenden's term, though Crittenden was not a delegate to the constitutional convention and apparently had little influence on <b>the</b> <b>drafting</b> <b>of</b> the document. Most Whigs opposed the calling of a constitutional convention because it would necessarily involve reapportionment of the state's legislative districts and threaten Whig dominance in the General Assembly; nevertheless, Crittenden belatedly supported the call for a convention during his 1848 gubernatorial campaign.|$|E
5|$|Henry {{personally}} presided at {{the trial}} of John Lambert in November 1538 for denying the real presence. At the same time, he shared in <b>the</b> <b>drafting</b> <b>of</b> a proclamation giving Anabaptists and Sacramentaries ten days {{to get out of}} the country. In 1539 Parliament passed the Six Articles reaffirming Roman Catholic practices such as transubstantiation, clerical celibacy and the importance of confession to a priest and prescribed penalties if anyone denied them. Henry himself observed the Easter Triduum in that year with some display.|$|E

5|$|While {{there was}} no {{accompanying}} political liberalization, with Gaddafi retaining predominant control, in March 2010, the government devolved further powers to the municipal councils. Rising numbers of reformist technocrats attained positions in the country's governance; best known was Gaddafi's son and heir apparent Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, who was openly critical of Libya's human rights record. He led a group who proposed <b>the</b> <b>drafting</b> <b>of</b> the new constitution, although it was never adopted. Involved in encouraging tourism, Saif founded several privately run media channels in 2008, but after criticizing the government they were nationalized in 2009. In October 2010, Gaddafi apologized to African leaders for the historical enslavement of Africans by the Arab slave trade.|$|E
5|$|Edward II succeeded as king of England on 7 July 1307, on {{the death}} of his father Edward I. The {{expectations}} of the new king were high, and he initially enjoyed a good relationship with the leading magnates of the realm. There were, however, some issues of contention remaining from the reign of his father. Edward I's incessant wars had put a great fiscal burden on the country, and his confrontational style had led to conflict with some of the leading lay and ecclesiastical lords. This had culminated in <b>the</b> <b>drafting</b> <b>of</b> the so-called Remonstrances in 1297, a set of complaints about royal government. By Edward I's death in 1307, most of these issued had been resolved. It was nevertheless in the interest of the leading men of the country to make sure that the new king did not act the way his father had, and ignored the opinions of his councillors.|$|E
5|$|Favre {{was drafted}} by the Atlanta Falcons {{in the second round}} with the 33rd overall pick in the 1991 NFL Draft. On July 19, 1991, Favre agreed to a three-year, US$1.4million {{contract}} with a reported signing bonus of $350,000. Atlanta head coach Jerry Glanville did not approve of <b>the</b> <b>drafting</b> <b>of</b> Favre, saying it would take a plane crash for him to put Favre into the game. Favre's first pass in an NFL regular season game resulted in an interception returned for a touchdown in a game against the Washington Redskins. He only attempted four passes in his career at Atlanta, was intercepted twice, and completed none of them. Favre took one other snap, which resulted in a sack for an eleven-yard loss.|$|E

5|$|Hostilities did not {{end with}} the {{publication}} of the Dictum. The garrison at Kenilworth refused to accept the terms given, and held out until 14 December, when deprivation forced them to surrender. In April 1267, the earl of Gloucesterwho had been central both to the royal victory at Evesham and to <b>the</b> <b>drafting</b> <b>of</b> the Dictumturned against the king. He occupied the city of London, and set himself up as the champion of the disinherited. After negotiations involving both Edward and Ottobuono, Gloucester relented, and by June a settlement was reached. Gloucester had forced a change to the conditions of the Dictum, whereby the disinherited were allowed to recover their lands before they had paid their fines rather than after; an arrangement that made repayment much easier. In the summer of that year, Prince Edward moved at the Isle of Ely, where the last of the rebels still held out, and forced them into submission under terms favourable to the rebels.|$|E
5|$|Many {{graduates}} of Lahainaluna became politicians or advisors {{in the court}} of King Kamehameha III. Kapena became the secretary and advisor to Kīnaʻu, the Kuhina Nui (an office similar to that of a prime minister or co-regent), and represented her in <b>the</b> <b>drafting</b> <b>of</b> Hawaii's first constitution and declaration of rights. In an effort to establish a stable government against colonial ambitions, King Kamehameha III, the Kuhina Nui and the council of chiefs sought to make Hawaii a constitutional monarchy. Kapena and Boaz Mahune (representing the King) assisted American missionary William Richards in the endeavor of drafting this document. Mahune and the graduates at Lahainaluna were chiefly credited with drafting the Declaration of Rights of 1839 in the contemporary newspaper The Polynesian. However, research by Hawaiian historian Jon Kamakawiwoʻole Osorio credits Richards as the actual author of the Declaration and the majority of the later 1840 Constitution while Mahune and Kapena were only assistants. The 1840 constitution codified the existing political structure of the kingdom and created the Hawaiian Supreme Court and the Legislature of Hawaii.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Sjahrir {{continued}} to work on negotiations with the Allied forces. On 7October 1946, Sjahrir and the former Dutch Prime Minister, Wim Schermerhorn, agreed to work towards a ceasefire. The discussions were to be moderated by the British diplomat Lord Killearn and involved Sudirman. He took a specially commissioned train to Jakarta, departing on 20October. However, he ordered it to return to Yogyakarta when Dutch troops refused to allow him and his men to enter the city with their weapons, feeling that such an order violated his sense of honour; the Dutch apologised, construing the events as a misunderstanding. Sudirman took another train in late October, arriving at Gambir Station in Jakarta on 1November, where he was greeted by large crowds. The discussions in Jakarta resulted in <b>the</b> <b>drafting</b> <b>of</b> the Linggadjati Agreement on 15 November; the agreement was ratified on 25March 1947, despite heavy opposition from Indonesian nationalists. Sudirman was vocally against the agreement, which he found to be detrimental to Indonesian interests, but considered himself obliged to follow his orders.|$|E

5|$|Production of {{full-length}} animated features {{was temporarily}} suspended {{after the release}} of Bambi. Given the financial failures of some of the recent features and World War II cutting off much of the overseas cinema market, the studio's financiers at the Bank of America would only loan the studio working capital if it temporarily restricted itself to shorts production. Then in-production features such as Peter Pan, Alice in Wonderland, and Lady and the Tramp were therefore put on hold until after the war. Other issues affecting the studio at the time included <b>the</b> <b>drafting</b> <b>of</b> several Disney animators to fight in World War II, and the necessity for the studio to focus on producing wartime content for the U.S. Army, particularly military training, and civilian propaganda films. From 1942 to 1943, 95 percent of the studio's animation output was for the military. During the war, Disney produced the live-action/animated military propaganda feature Victory Through Air Power (1943), and a series of Latin culture-themed shorts resulting from the 1941 Good Neighbor trip were compiled into two features, Saludos Amigos (1942) and The Three Caballeros (1944).|$|E
5|$|Ralph W. Aigler (February 12, 1885 – May 24, 1964) was an American law {{professor}} at the University of Michigan from 19101954, the University's faculty representative to the Big Ten Conference from 1917 to 1955, and chairman of Michigan's Faculty Board in Control of Athletics from 1917 to 1942. Aigler was a renowned expert on real property law and one of the advisors to the American Law Institute in <b>the</b> <b>drafting</b> <b>of</b> the Restatement of the Law of Property. He is best known, however, for his contributions to the athletics programs at the University of Michigan. Aigler's contributions included leading Michigan back into the Big Ten Conference, leading the effort to construct Michigan Stadium, Yost Fieldhouse and other facilities, negotiating the Big Ten's exclusive contract with the Rose Bowl starting in 1946, hiring Fritz Crisler as football coach and athletic director, and acting as a spokesman for the University and Big Ten for many years on NCAA rules and eligibility issues. He was inducted into the University of Michigan Athletic Hall of Honor in 1982.|$|E

Bogart had worked for Olmsted and Vaux on Central Park in New York and later Bogart was the chief engineer for the New York City Department of Parks from 1872 to 1877. From 1869 to 1872 R.H.
