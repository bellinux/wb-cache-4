5|$|Andy's and Red's {{relationship}} {{has been described as}} a non-sexual love story between two men, <b>that</b> <b>few</b> other films offer, where the friendship is not built on conducting a caper, car chases, or developing a relationship with women. Philosopher Alexander Hooke argued that Andy's and Red's true freedom is their friendship, being able to share joy and humor with each other.|$|E
5|$|Only one runestone {{mentioning}} the Byzantine Empire {{has been found}} on Gotland. This may be due both to the fact <b>that</b> <b>few</b> rune stones were raised on Gotland in favour of image stones, {{as well as to}} the fact that the Gotlanders dealt mainly in trade, paying a yearly tribute to the Swedes for military protection.|$|E
5|$|Sawyer (2000), on {{the other}} hand, reacts against this {{commonly}} held view and comments {{that the vast majority}} of the runestones were raised in memory of people who are not reported to have died abroad. She argues <b>that</b> <b>few</b> men who went abroad were honoured with memorials and the reason is that the runestones were mainly raised because of concerns at home, such as inheritance issues. Such concerns would have arisen when a family knew that a relative would not return from abroad.|$|E

5|$|A {{survey of}} 1000 {{secondary}} school pupils and university students in Tayside conducted in February 2010 found 20% {{of them had}} previously taken mephedrone. Although {{at the time it}} was available legally over the internet, only 10% of users reported purchasing it online, with most purchasing it from street dealers. Of those who had used mephedrone, 97% said it was easy or very easy to obtain. Around 50% of users reported at least one negative effect associated with the use of mephedrone, of which teeth grinding is the most common. Detailed interviews with users in Northern Ireland similarly found <b>that</b> <b>few</b> purchased mephedrone online, with most interviewees citing concerns that their address would be traced or that family members could intercept the package.|$|E
5|$|According to Mihardja, {{religious}} thinkers {{blasted the}} novel for depicting Hasan, whom they interpreted {{as representative of}} religion and religious people, as unable to overcome temptation; they also disliked the novel's lack of in-depth discussion of religion, necessary for {{a better understanding of}} theism. Marxists and anarchists also felt that their ideologies were not well explained. They considered Rusli and Anwar not truly representative of the thoughts of Karl Marx and Friedrich Nietzsche. In response, Mihardja wrote that the characters were meant to be realistic, and <b>that</b> <b>few</b> people have as much knowledge about an ideology as demanded by the critics.|$|E
5|$|Bears are parasitized by eighty {{species of}} parasites, {{including}} single-celled protozoans and gastro-intestinal worms, and nematodes and flukes in their heart, liver, lungs and bloodstream. Externally they have ticks, fleas and lice. A study of American black bears found seventeen species of endoparasite including the protozoan Sarcocystis, the parasitic worm Diphyllobothrium mansonoides, and the nematodes Dirofilaria immitis, Capillaria aerophila, Physaloptera sp., Strongyloides sp. and others. Of these, D. mansonoides and adult C. aerophila were causing pathological symptoms. By contrast, polar bears have few parasites; many parasitic species need a secondary, usually terrestrial, host, and the polar bear's life style is such <b>that</b> <b>few</b> alternative hosts exist in their environment. The protozoan Toxoplasma gondii {{has been found}} in polar bears, and the nematode Trichinella nativa can cause a serious infection and decline in older polar bears. Bears in North America are sometimes infected by a Morbillivirus similar to the canine distemper virus. They are susceptible to infectious canine hepatitis (CAV-1), with free-living black bears dying rapidly of encephalitis and hepatitis.|$|E

5|$|By {{the late}} Maastrichtian, albertosaurines {{appear to have}} gone extinct, while the tyrannosaurine Tyrannosaurus roamed from Saskatchewan to Texas. This pattern is {{mirrored}} in other North American dinosaur taxa. During the Campanian and early Maastrichtian, lambeosaurine hadrosaurs and centrosaurine ceratopsians are common in the northwest, while hadrosaurines and chasmosaurines were more common to the south. By {{the end of the}} Cretaceous, centrosaurines are unknown and lambeosaurines are rare, while hadrosaurines and chasmosaurines were common throughout the Western Interior. A study published in the journal Scientific Reports on February 2, 2016 by Steve Brusatte, Thomas Carr et al. indicates that during the later Maastrichtian, Tyrannosaurus itself might have been partially responsible for the extinction of the other tyrannosaurids in most of western North America. The study indicates that Tyrannosaurus might have been an immigrant from Asia as opposed to having evolved in North America (possibly a descendent of the closely related Tarbosaurus) that supplanted and outcompeted other tyrannosaurids. This theory is further supported by the fact <b>that</b> <b>few</b> to no other types of tyrannosaurid are found within Tyrannosaurus known range.|$|E
5|$|Coakley {{summed up}} his {{prosecution}} case on September 22. His {{aim was to}} show the court that a conspiracy had taken placethe mass of accounts from officers and men appeared to support the conclusion that ringleaders and agitators had forced a rebellion against authority. Veltmann pointed out <b>that</b> <b>few</b> of the accused had been ordered to load ammunition, meaning {{that they could not}} all be guilty of the charge of disobeying orders. Veltmann stressed that much of the testimony was hearsay and failed to establish a conspiracy or a mutiny. The court, however, seemed to side with Coakley on all points, settling each objection in favor of the prosecution.|$|E
5|$|Colugos are a {{small group}} of Southeast Asian gliding mammals closely related to the primates. Their fossil record is {{exceptionally}} poor. Although Paleogene groups such as the Plagiomenidae are considered by some to be closely related to colugos, no fossils undoubtedly referable to the living colugo family, Cynocephalidae, had been reported until 1992. In that year, Stéphane Ducrocq and colleagues described a jaw fragment from the Eocene of Thailand as a new genus and species of colugo, Dermotherium major. In 2000, however, Brian Stafford and Frederick Szalay argued that Dermotherium might not be a colugo, since the fossil is so poorly preserved <b>that</b> <b>few</b> traits can be unambiguously recognized and some purported dermopteran features of the fossil are in fact also seen in other placental groups. Mary Silcox and colleagues reaffirmed the colugo affinities of Dermotherium in 2005 on the basis of detailed similarities in molar morphology.|$|E

50|$|An {{article in}} Sportfishing Magazine in February 2007 made the claim <b>that</b> <b>fewer</b> twists created greater strength.

5|$|Contemporaries {{regarded}} Organt {{as something}} of a salacious novelty and it was quickly banned, but censors who tried to confiscate it discovered <b>that</b> <b>few</b> copies were available anywhere. It did not sell well and resulted in a financial loss for its author. The public's taste for literature had changed in the prelude to the Revolution, and Saint-Just's taste changed with it: aside from a few pages of an unfinished novel found amidst his papers {{at the end of his}} life, Saint-Just devoted his future writing entirely to undecorated essays of social and political theory. With his previous ambitions of literary and lawyerly fame unfulfilled, Saint-Just directed his focus on the single goal of revolutionary command.|$|E
5|$|Copenhagen lost around 22,000 of its {{population}} of 65,000 to the plague in 1711. The city was also struck by two major fires which destroyed much of its infrastructure. The Copenhagen Fire of 1728 was {{the largest in the}} history of Copenhagen. It began on the evening of 20 October, and continued to burn until the morning of 23 October, destroying approximately 28% of the city, leaving some 20% of the population homeless. No less than 47% of the medieval section of the city was completely lost. Along with the 1795 fire, it is the main reason <b>that</b> <b>few</b> traces of the old town {{can be found in the}} modern city.|$|E
5|$|Efe's obverse dies {{show the}} king's name and title, usually spelt {{with a mixture}} of runes and Latin script, with some aspects of the coins {{occasionally}} ill-drawn or omitted altogether. The king's name is generally arranged around the central motif of a pellet (or a cross) within a circle of pellets: this layout probably derived from Northumbrian coins. The reverse dies consisted of a cross and the letters E F E, placed in four sectors that were divided off by lines. It can be shown that Efe did not use his dies in any particular or consistent order. Calculations have been made that suggest <b>that</b> <b>few</b> of his dies remain undiscovered.|$|E

5|$|In 2005, a Massey University {{study in}} New Zealand {{concluded}} that sailors from the Royal Navy, Royal New Zealand Navy and Fijian Navy who observed the tests from nearby ships later suffered {{adverse health effects}} from exposure to radioactive fallout, including cancer and genetic abnormalities in the veterans' children. Various veterans' organisations filed a class action lawsuit against the UK Ministry of Defence following {{the publication of the}} study. The effects of radioactive fallout from the Grapple tests were researched by a 2010 British Government study that concluded the fallout did not reach concentrations that could affect the surrounding nature. The Ministry of Defence maintained <b>that</b> <b>few</b> people were exposed to any radiation or contamination at all, and that studies had shown little or no health effects. An analysis of illnesses in veterans of Grapple and other weapons tests produced statistics that are hard to interpret. The veterans showed rates of illness that were slightly higher than the control group, but the control group had lower rates of illness than the population as a whole while the veterans had rates that were about the same. Neither of these results has a clear explanation.|$|E

He also pursued a variety of other activities: he accepted an invitation to serve on a committee to dedicate a memorial (Louis Marshall Memorial Hall) to his father at the forestry college in Syracuse.

5|$|Oral {{tradition}} {{holds that}} either Hotu Matu‘a or Tu‘u ko Iho, the legendary founder(s) of Rapa Nui, brought 67tablets from their homeland. The same founder is also credited with bringing indigenous {{plants such as}} the toromiro. However, there is no homeland likely {{to have had a}} tradition of writing in Polynesia or even in South America. Thus rongorongo appears to have been an internal development. Given <b>that</b> <b>few</b> if any of the Rapanui people remaining on the island in the 1870s could read the glyphs, it is likely that only a small minority were ever literate. Indeed, early visitors were told that literacy was a privilege of the ruling families and priests who were all kidnapped in the Peruvian slaving raids or died soon afterwards in the resulting epidemics.|$|E
5|$|Rudd was {{offering}} generous terms <b>that</b> <b>few</b> competitors {{could hope to}} even come close to. If Lobengula agreed, Rudd's backers would furnish the king with 1,000 Martini–Henry breech-loading rifles, 100,000 rounds of matching ammunition, a steamboat on the Zambezi (or, if Lobengula preferred, a lump sum of £500), and £100 a month in perpetuity. More impressive to the king than the financial aspects of this offer were the weapons: he {{had at the time}} between 600 and 800 rifles and carbines, but almost no ammunition for them. The proposed arrangement would lavishly stock his arsenal with both firearms and bullets, which might prove decisive in the event of conflict with the South African Republic. The weapons might also help him keep control of the more rambunctious factions amid his own impis. Lobengula had Helm go over the document with him several times, in great detail, to ensure that he properly understood what was written. None of Rudd's alleged oral conditions were in the concession document, making them legally unenforceable (presuming they indeed existed), but the king apparently regarded them as part of the proposed agreement nonetheless.|$|E

Unlike earlier laws, it was written in Akkadian, the daily language of Babylon, and could therefore be read by any literate person in the city.|$|E
