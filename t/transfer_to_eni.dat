5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} by Sam Newton that Ecgric {{may in fact be}} identical <b>to</b> <b>Eni's</b> son Æthelric, whose descendants became kings of East Anglia. Æthelric's son Ealdwulf ruled from about 664 to 713. After Ecgric's death, three other sons of Eni ruled in succession before Ealdwulf, an indication that Raedwald's line was extinct. Æthelric's marriage to Hereswith suggests that it was expected that he would rule East Anglia and he may have been promoted by Edwin before 632. Æthelric was apparently dead by 647, at which time Anna was already ruling and Hereswith had gone to Gaul to lead a religious life. It has therefore been argued that Æthelric and Ecgric were in fact the same person, a suggestion that is disputed by the historian Barbara Yorke, who notes that the two names are too distinct to be compatible.|$|R

40|$|This work {{intended}} {{to offer a}} contribution for the comprehension of the process involved in the readings of the history and philosophy of science literature, or about this subject in prospective physics teacher’s education. The teaching procedures and data collection were based mainly on discourse analysis notions according <b>to</b> <b>Eni</b> Orlandi publications in Brazil. The way of meaning production {{and the possibility of}} future application of the same strategy with their own students were analyzed after history and philosophy of science texts readings. The results points to positive displacements in the knowledge and in the imaginary of those students about the history and the philosophy of science potentials, as has been verified by the great variety of answers in the open question related to this subject. The diversity itself justifies the need for working with the position of the students and not only with physics and history and philosophy of science subjects in the physics teacher’s education...|$|R
