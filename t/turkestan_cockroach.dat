5000|$|Blatta lateralis (F. Walker, 1868): <b>Turkestan</b> <b>cockroach</b> or red runner ...|$|E
50|$|The <b>Turkestan</b> <b>cockroach</b> is {{primarily}} an outdoor insect, not {{known as an}} aggressive indoor pest, unlike some cockroach species such as the German and brown-banded cockroaches, though it will inhabit areas around dwellings where shelter can be found. However, in specific localities or tropical locations, it can become a significant indoor pest. Of occasional indoor interlopers, males are more commonly encountered than females, due {{to their ability to}} fly and an attraction to lights. In Arabia, it lives beneath stones in damp hollows, desert farms, and wadis, feeding primarily at night.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Turkestan</b> <b>{{cockroach}}</b> (Blatta lateralis, or Shelfordella lateralis in some classifications), {{also known}} as the rusty red cockroach, red runner cockroach or simply rusty red, red runner, or lat, is a primarily outdoor-dwelling cockroach native to an area from northern Africa to Central Asia. Adults measure around 3 cm in length. Adult males are a brownish orange or red, are slender, and have long, yellowish wings which allow it to fly. Adult females are dark brown to black, with cream-colored markings on the shield and a cream-colored stripe edging its wings; they are broader than males, and have short vestigial wings. Nymphs are brown in front, black on the rear, and are wingless.|$|E
50|$|In the US, <b>Turkestan</b> <b>cockroaches</b> are {{sometimes}} kept to feed to pet reptiles and other insectivores, chosen {{partly because they}} can't climb smooth surfaces and don't burrow. Cockroaches have been replacing crickets, the most popular feeder insect for decades, due to the cricket's noise, odor, short lifespan, and expense. <b>Turkestan</b> <b>cockroaches</b> are a popular choice of species, and are readily available for sale over the Internet, which may hasten their spread to new habitats.|$|R
50|$|Although {{reliable}} information on specific dietary requirements of insectivores is scant, <b>Turkestan</b> <b>cockroaches</b> provide a high-protein, low fat nutrition composition similar to crickets, {{more so than}} mealworms or superworm larvae provide. The gut contents of the cockroach, depending on its diet, may provide essential nutrients unavailable from a cockroach with an empty gut.|$|R
50|$|A {{study found}} other <b>cockroaches</b> (<b>Turkestan</b> ("red runner") <b>cockroaches,</b> Madagascar hissing cockroaches,) {{provided}} a high-protein, low fat nutrition composition similar to crickets, {{more so than}} mealworms or superworm larvae provide. The gut contents of the cockroach, depending on its diet, may provide essential nutrients unavailable from a cockroach with an empty gut. Vitamin and mineral content in studied cockroaches was well represented except for low calcium:phosphorus ratios typical in cockroaches, and relatively low vitamin A and E in captive cockroaches. Supplementation of these nutrients in feeder cockroaches may be advisable. A study of panther chameleons (Furcifer pardalis) found vitamin A deficiency shortened life spans and reduced reproduction rates.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Turkestan</b> <b>cockroach</b> {{was first}} {{noticed in the}} US in 1978, around the former Sharpe Army Depot in California, {{followed}} shortly after by appearances at Fort Bliss in Texas and several other military bases. Researchers believe the species arrived on military equipment returning from central Asia, perhaps Afghanistan. Since then the species has been rapidly replacing the common oriental cockroach (Blatta orientalis) in urban areas of the southwestern US “as the most important peri-domestic species”, with advantages of laying more eggs and maturing more quickly than the oriental cockroach. “They typically inhabit in-ground containers such as water meter, irrigation, and electrical boxes, raises of concrete, cracks and crevices, and hollow block walls.” They are well established in the Southwest {{and parts of the}} Southeast, and {{have been reported in the}} Northeast.|$|E
