In this paper we introduce a unified analytical approach to the construction of <b>tolerance</b> <b>intervals</b> for discrete distributions in exponential families with quadratic variance functions.

40|$|The use of {{regression}} models for prediction purposes {{is one of}} the most common applications of chemometrics. In most cases, only reporting the point predictions is unsatisfactory and intervals are needed to quantify the uncertainty involved. It is common practice to use the 95 % prediction interval for this goal and to interpret such an interval as if 95 % of the future responses will be contained within this interval. However, this is inappropriate, and it can result in a gross underestimation of the real uncertainty of the predicted response, especially in cases where the degrees of freedom is small. To correctly quantify the uncertainty of a prediction, so-called <b>tolerance</b> <b>intervals</b> should be used. Although the theoretical background on <b>tolerance</b> <b>intervals</b> is well documented in the statistical literature, practical guidelines to calculate and use <b>tolerance</b> <b>intervals</b> in real-world applications are lacking. Another less known concept is that of simultaneous versus non-simultaneous intervals. In this tutorial, we explain the origin, interpretation and practical calculation of confidence, prediction, and <b>tolerance</b> <b>intervals,</b> both in their simultaneous and non-simultaneous form. Depending on the case, equations for exact or approximate <b>tolerance</b> <b>intervals</b> are provided. The accuracy of the approximations is discussed. A MATLAB program is available to estimate the exact width of <b>tolerance</b> <b>intervals</b> in all cases involving ordinary least squares regression. (c) 2007 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|International audienceIn some {{regression}} problems, {{it may be}} {{more reasonable}} to predict intervals rather than precise values. We are interested in finding intervals which simultaneously for all input instances x ∈X contain a β proportion of the response values. We name this problem simultaneous interval regression. This is similar to simultaneous <b>tolerance</b> <b>intervals</b> for regression with a high confidence level γ[*]≈[*] 1 and several authors have already treated this problem for linear regression. Such intervals could be seen as a form of confidence envelop for the prediction variable given any value of predictor variables in their domain. <b>Tolerance</b> <b>intervals</b> and simultaneous <b>tolerance</b> <b>intervals</b> have not yet been treated for the K-nearest neighbor (KNN) regression method. The goal {{of this paper is to}} consider the simultaneous interval regression problem for KNN and this is done without the homoscedasticity assumption. In this scope, we propose a new interval regression method based on KNN which takes advantage of <b>tolerance</b> <b>intervals</b> in order to choose, for each instance, the value of the hyper-parameter K which will be a good trade-off between the precision and the uncertainty due to the limited sample size of the neighborhood around each instance.

We extend this idea to higher dimensions by replacing the class of intervals with other classes of sets, like ellipsoids, hyperrectangles or convex sets. The asymptotic behaviour of our tolerance regions is derived using empirical process theory, in particular the concept of generalized quantiles.

Since in this work {{we deal with the}} computation of one - sided <b>tolerance</b> <b>interval,</b> for the two-sided case we recomend, for instance, Krishnamoorthy and Mathew [5]. Krishnamoorthy and Mathew [4] performed the computation of upper tolerance limit in balanced and unbalanced one-way random eﬀects models, whereas Fonseca et al [3] performed it based in a similar ideas but in a tow-way nested mixed or random eﬀects model. In case of random eﬀects model, Fonseca et al [3] performed the computation of such interval only for the balanced data, whereas in the mixed eﬀects case they dit it only for the unbalanced data.

This statement is not surprising, it holds for any random variable with continuous distribution function. In order to demonstrate the undesirable consequences of the <b>tolerance</b> <b>interval</b> method in the decision making, the results of the analysis of an elementary example are discussed. Instead of the <b>tolerance</b> <b>interval</b> method, we suggest another method based on the sign test which has more encouraging features, {{especially in the case of}} several output variables.

40|$|The {{estimation}} of variance components {{serves as an}} integral part of the evaluation of variation, and is of interest and required in a variety of applications (Hugo, 2012). Estimation of the among-group variance components is often desired for quantifying the variability and effectively understanding these measurements (Van Der Rijst, 2006). The methodology for determining Bayesian <b>tolerance</b> <b>intervals</b> for the one – way random effects model has originally been proposed by Wolfinger (1998) using both informative and non-informative prior distributions (Hugo, 2012). Wolfinger (1998) also provided relationships with frequentist methodologies. From a Bayesian point of view, it is important to investigate and compare the effect on coverage probabilities if negative variance components are either replaced by zero, or completely disregarded from the simulation process. This research presents a simulation-based approach for determining Bayesian <b>tolerance</b> <b>intervals</b> in variance component models when negative variance components are either replaced by zero, or completely disregarded from the simulation process. This approach handles different kinds of <b>tolerance</b> <b>intervals</b> in a straightforward fashion. It makes use of a computer-generated sample (Monte Carlo process) from the joint posterior distribution of the mean and variance parameters to construct a sample from other relevant posterior distributions. This research makes use of only non-informative Jeffreys‟ prior distributions and uses three Bayesian simulation methods. Comparative results of different <b>tolerance</b> <b>intervals</b> obtained using a method where negative variance components are either replaced by zero or completely disregarded from the simulation process, is investigated and discussed in this research...|$|R
