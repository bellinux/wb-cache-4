The historicity of an event also depends on {{the reliability of the}} source; indeed, the gospels are not independent nor consistent records of Jesus' life. Mark, which is most likely the earliest written gospel, has been considered for many decades the most historically accurate. John, the latest written gospel, differs considerably from the Synoptic Gospels, and thus is generally considered less reliable, although more and more scholars now also recognize that it may contain a core of older material as historically valuable as the Synoptic tradition or even more so.|$|E

25|$|The {{existence}} of John the Baptist {{within the same}} time frame as Jesus, and his eventual execution by Herod Antipas is attested to by 1st-century historian Josephus and {{the overwhelming majority of}} modern scholars view Josephus' accounts of the activities of John the Baptist as authentic. One of the arguments in favor of the historicity of the Baptism of Jesus by John is <b>the</b> <b>criterion</b> <b>of</b> embarrassment, i.e. that it is a story which the early Christian Church would have never wanted to invent. Another argument used in favour of the historicity of the baptism is that multiple accounts refer to it, usually called <b>the</b> <b>criterion</b> <b>of</b> multiple attestation. Technically, multiple attestation does not guarantee authenticity, but only determines antiquity. However, for most scholars, together with <b>the</b> <b>criterion</b> <b>of</b> embarrassment it lends credibility to the baptism of Jesus by John being a historical event.|$|E

25|$|According to the non-canonical Gospel of the Nazarenes, {{the idea}} of being baptized by John came from the mother and {{brothers}} of Jesus, and Jesus himself, originally opposed, reluctantly accepted it. Benjamin Urrutia avers that this version is supported by <b>the</b> <b>Criterion</b> <b>of</b> Embarrassment, since followers of Jesus would not have invented an episode in which Jesus changes his mind and comes to accept someone else's plan. Plus, the story came from the community that included the family of Jesus, who would have guaranteed the authenticity of the narrative.|$|E
25|$|Karl Popper stated it is {{insufficient}} to distinguish science from pseudoscience, or from metaphysics, by <b>the</b> <b>criterion</b> <b>of</b> rigorous adherence to the empirical method, which is essentially inductive, based on observation or experimentation. He proposed a method to distinguish between genuine empirical, nonempirical or even pseudoempirical methods. The latter case was exemplified by astrology, which appeals to observation and experimentation. While it had astonishing empirical evidence based on observation, on horoscopes and biographies, it crucially failed to use acceptable scientific standards. Popper proposed falsifiability as an important criterion in distinguishing science from pseudoscience.|$|E

25|$|Diagnostic {{criteria}} {{have been}} criticized. Both {{the number of}} criteria and the need of being positive for two of them as enough for diagnosis are arbitrary ideas. Moreover, experienced groups {{in the use of}} ultrasound {{have not been able to}} show intracranial or extracranial reflux in MS patients or even healthy controls whereas <b>the</b> <b>criterion</b> <b>of</b> absence of flow and the criterion regarding stenosis are considered not valid since they are related to normal phisiological processes and not pathology. These problems in the criteria have led some researchers to consider the criteria inadequate and more generally the concept of CCSVI flawed.|$|E
25|$|During the mid-20th century, Karl Popper {{emphasized}} <b>the</b> <b>criterion</b> <b>of</b> falsifiability {{to distinguish}} science from nonscience. Statements, hypotheses, or theories have falsifiability or refutability {{if there is}} the inherent possibility {{that they can be}} proven false. That is, if it is possible to conceive of an observation or an argument which negates them. Popper used astrology and psychoanalysis as examples of pseudoscience and Einstein's theory of relativity as an example of science. He subdivided nonscience into philosophical, mathematical, mythological, religious and metaphysical formulations on one hand, and pseudoscientific formulations on the other, though he did not provide clear criteria for the differences.|$|E
25|$|Another way {{to think}} of the proof is that B, empty or non-empty, is always in the power set of A. For f to be onto, some element of A must map to B. But that leads to a {{contradict}}ion: no element of B can map to B because that would contradict <b>the</b> <b>criterion</b> <b>of</b> membership in B, thus the element mapping to B must not be an element of B meaning that it satisfies the criterion for membership in B, another contradiction. So the assumption that an element of A maps to B must be false; and f cannot be onto.|$|E

25|$|The {{most common}} method applied in pseudoscientific {{language}} comparisons is to search {{two or more}} languages for words that seem similar in their sound and meaning. While similarities of this kind often seem convincing to laypersons, linguistic scientists consider this kind of comparison to be unreliable for two primary reasons. First, the method applied is not well-defined: <b>the</b> <b>criterion</b> <b>of</b> similarity is subjective and thus not subject to verification or falsification, which {{is contrary to the}} principles of the scientific method. Second, the large size of all languages' vocabulary and a relatively limited inventory of articulated sounds used by most languages makes it easy to find coincidentally similar words between languages.|$|E
25|$|Thus, by <b>the</b> <b>criterion</b> <b>of</b> harmony, Shaftesbury refutes Hobbes, and deduces {{the virtue}} of benevolence as {{indispensable}} to morality. So also he has drawn a close parallel between the moral and the aesthetic criteria. Just {{as there is a}} faculty which apprehends beauty in the sphere of art, so there is in the sphere of ethics a faculty which determines the value of actions. This faculty he described (for the first time in English thought) as the Moral Sense (see Hutcheson) or Conscience (cf. Butler). In its essence, it is primarily emotional and non-reflective; in process of development it becomes rationalized by education and use. The emotional and the rational elements in the moral sense Shaftesbury did not fully analyse (see Home).|$|E
25|$|In 2003, Russia {{also joined}} the Rome Convention, the {{analogue}} of the Berne Convention for neighbouring rights.

Russia chose to apply the criteria of nationality and publication, declaring <b>the</b> <b>criterion</b> <b>of</b> fixation as inapplicable in its adherence to the treaty.
