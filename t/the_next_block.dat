40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} prefetch-based disk buffer {{management}} algorithm, {{which we call}} W²R (Weighing/Waiting Room). Instead of using elaborate prefetching schemes to decide which block to prefetch and when, we simply follow the LRU-OBL (One Block Lookahead) approach and prefetch <b>the</b> logical <b>next</b> <b>block</b> along with <b>the</b> block that is being referenced. The basic {{difference is that the}} W²R algorithm logically partitions the buffer into two rooms, namely the Weighing Room and the Waiting Room. The referenced, hence fetched block is placed in the Weighing Room, while <b>the</b> prefetched logical <b>next</b> <b>block</b> is placed in the Waiting Room. By so doing, we alleviate some inherent deficiencies of blindly prefetching <b>the</b> logical <b>next</b> <b>block</b> of a referenced block. Specifically, a prefetched block that is never used may replace a possibly valuable block and a prefetched block, though referenced in the future, may replace a block that is used earlier than itself. Using the DB 2 and OLTP traces, we show t [...] ...|$|R
25|$|The {{house is}} located {{on the north side of}} Main Street between North Broadway (U.S. Route 9) and Dearman Street.

The other engine and part of the landing gear plummeted down an elevator shaft. The resulting fire was extinguished in 40minutes. Fourteen people were killed in the incident. Elevator operator Betty Lou Oliver survived a plunge of 75 stories inside an elevator, which still stands as the Guinness World Record for the longest survived elevator fall recorded.|$|E
25|$|Baudrillard is not disputing the trivial {{issue that}} reason remains {{operative}} in some actions, that if I want {{to arrive at}} <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>block,</b> for example, I can assume a Newtonian universe (common sense), plan {{a course of action}} (to walk straight for Xmeters), carry out the action, and finally fulfill my goal by arriving at the point in question. What is in doubt is that this sort of thinking enables a historically informed grasp of the present in general. According to Baudrillard, it does not. The concurrent spread of the hyperreal through the media and the collapse of liberal and Marxist politics as the master narratives, deprives the rational subject of its privileged access to truth. In an important sense individuals are no longer citizens, eager to maximise their civil rights, nor proletarians, anticipating the onset of communism. They are rather consumers, and hence the prey of objects as defined by the code.|$|E

25|$|In TFTP, a {{transfer}} is {{initiated by the}} client issuing a request to read or write a particular file on the server. The request can optionally include a set of negotiated transfer parameters proposed by the client under the terms specified by RFC 2347. If the server grants the request, the file is sent in fixed length blocks of 512 bytes by default or the number specified in the blocksize negotiated option defined by RFC 2348. Each block of transferred data which is usually carried within a single IP packet {{in order to avoid}} IP fragmentation, must be acknowledged by an acknowledgment packet before <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>block</b> can be sent. A data packet of less than 512 bytes or the agreed blocksize option signals termination of {{a transfer}}. If a packet gets lost in the network, the intended recipient will timeout and may retransmit their last packet (which may be data or an acknowledgment), thus causing the sender of the lost packet to retransmit that lost packet. The sender has to keep just one packet on hand for retransmission, since the lock step acknowledgment guarantees that all older packets have been correctly received. Notice that both devices involved in a transfer are considered senders and receivers. One sends data and receives acknowledgments, the other sends acknowledgments and receives data.|$|E
500|$|By the 1920s, {{the central}} park blocks were {{home to the}} 12-story Stevens Building and the 9-story Woodlark Building, as well as six or more hotels. Edward H.

Otherwise, the next spark was the conversion of one central park block into O'Bryant Square in 1972. <b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>block</b> to be reclaimed was Director Park, dedicated as a park in 2009, inspired by a 1995 plan to turn the block into a 12-story parking lot.|$|E
500|$|The western {{terminus}} of Bus. US41 was {{the west}} end of Washington Street at the intersection with US41/M-28 near the western Marquette city limits. The intersection features a stoplight to allow traffic from eastbound US41/M-28 to cross the westbound lanes of the main highway to access Washington Street; the remaining connections are made through stop-sign-controlled access lanes. Running eastward, Washington Street is four lanes, divided by a center median for about [...] before a center turn lane replaces the median. The street is bordered by several commercial developments. There is a stoplight for the intersection with McClellan Avenue as the business loop runs uphill toward downtown. A few blocks east past other businesses and restaurants, Washington intersects the southern end of Lincoln Avenue at another stoplight. East of this junction, the roadway narrows to one lane in each direction with a center turn lane. Washington Street turns to the southeast and heads downhill in <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>block,</b> which is bordered by some houses on the north side. The turn lane drops by Seventh Street as the street passes Harlow Park.|$|E
