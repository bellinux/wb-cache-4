5|$|There is no {{requirement}} that other comorbid conditions (such as ADHD or OCD) be present, {{but if a}} physician believes {{that there may be}} another condition present that could explain tics, tests may be ordered as necessary <b>to</b> <b>rule</b> out that condition. An example of this is when diagnostic confusion between tics and seizure activity exists, which would call for an EEG, or if there are symptoms that indicate an MRI <b>to</b> <b>rule</b> out brain abnormalities. TSH levels can be measured <b>to</b> <b>rule</b> out hypothyroidism, which can be a cause of tics. Brain imaging studies are not usually warranted. In teenagers and adults presenting with a sudden onset of tics and other behavioral symptoms, a urine drug screen for cocaine and stimulants might be necessary. If a family history of liver disease is present, serum copper and ceruloplasmin levels can rule out Wilson's disease. Most cases are diagnosed by merely observing a history of tics.|$|E

Stroke, multiple sclerosis, hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, and dementias such as Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, frontotemporal dementia, and Lewy Body dementia may also be associated with schizophrenia-like psychotic symptoms. It may be necessary <b>to</b> <b>rule</b> out a delirium, which can be distinguished by visual hallucinations, acute onset and fluctuating level of consciousness, and indicates an underlying medical illness. Investigations are not generally repeated for relapse {{unless there is a}} specific medical indication or possible adverse effects from antipsychotic medication.

5|$|Caracalla's father, Septimius Severus, died on 4February 211 at Eboracum (now York) {{while on}} {{campaign}} in Caledonia, {{north of the}} Roman Britannia. Caracalla and his brother, Publius Septimius Antoninus Geta, jointly inherited the throne upon their father's death. Caracalla and Geta ended the campaign in Caledonia after concluding a peace with the Caledonians that returned the border of Roman Britain to the line demarcated by Hadrian's Wall. During the journey back to Rome with their father's ashes, Caracalla and his brother continuously argued with one another, making relations between them increasingly hostile. Caracalla and Geta considered dividing the empire in half along the Bosphorus to make their co-rule less hostile. Caracalla was <b>to</b> <b>rule</b> {{in the west and}} Geta was <b>to</b> <b>rule</b> in the east. They were persuaded not to do this by their mother.|$|E
