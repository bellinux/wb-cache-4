5|$|In 1836, native Vermonter John Deere set {{out from}} Rutland, Vermont to Grand Detour, Illinois, founded by his friend and fellow Vermont native Leonard Andrus. The town lacked a local blacksmith, Deere's trade, and within two days Deere had a forge and new {{business}} established. In Vermont, Deere produced plows made from cast-iron and when he first arrived in Illinois he produced the same plows. Soil conditions in Illinois differ from those in Vermont. In Vermont <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> <b>is</b> sandy and falls easily away from the plow blade but in Illinois <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> <b>is</b> thicker and wetter; it stuck to the plow {{and had to be}} scraped off by the farmer as he plowed.|$|E

5|$|The rim of {{the central}} plain is vegetated by a dense shrubland of Rhagodia baccata (berry saltbush), Atriplex paludosa and Threlkeldia diffusa (coast bonefruit). Nearer the centre, the {{vegetation}} consists of Frankenia pauciflora (seaheath), Muellerolimon salicorniaceum and Tecticornia arbuscula (bulli bulli), although T.arbuscula is replaced by Tecticornia halocnemoides (shrubby samphire) where <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> <b>is</b> shallow. The most low-lying area of the central plain, south of the salt lake, is water-logged in winter; it is vegetated by a dense mat of Sarcocornia quinqueflora (beaded samphire), Sporobolus virginicus (marine couch) and Suaeda australis (seablite).|$|E
5|$|Agaricus bernardii is a {{saprobic}} species. Its mushrooms fruit singly, scattered, or {{in groups}} on the ground. They grow in sandy soils, lawns, and in habitats with a high salt concentration, like along ocean coasts and salt marshes. Once primarily a maritime species, the fungus has spread inland to roadside verges where salt {{has been applied to}} de-ice the roads. Fruit bodies sometimes form underground. Mushrooms can also grow in fairy rings, especially when in grasslands or pastures. A Czech study determined that the mushrooms will strongly bioaccumulate silver from contaminated soil. Although the average concentration of silver in <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> <b>is</b> typically less than 1 milligram per kilogram of soil, it can be significantly elevated near industrial sites such as mines and smelters. The concentration of silver in the caps—which reached levels of up to 544mg per kg of mushroom tissue (dry weight)—was about twice that of the stems.|$|E
5|$|Blackcurrants {{can grow}} well on sandy or heavy loams, or forest soils, {{as long as}} their {{nutrient}} requirements are met. They prefer damp, fertile but not waterlogged ground and are intolerant of drought. Although the bushes are winter hardy, frosts during the flowering period may adversely affect the yield and cold winds may restrict the number of flying insects visiting and pollinating the flowers. A pH of about 6 is ideal for blackcurrants and the ground can be limed if <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> <b>is</b> too acidic. Planting is usually done in the autumn or winter to allow the plants to become established before growth starts in the spring, but container-grown stock can be planted at any time of year.|$|E

5|$|Cordyline australis is a light-demanding pioneer species, and {{seedlings}} die when overtopped {{by other}} trees. To grow well, young plants require open space {{so they are}} not shaded out by other vegetation. Another requirement is water during the seedling stage. Although adult trees can store water and are drought resistant, seedlings need a good supply of water to survive. This stops the species from growing in sand dunes unless there are wet depressions present, and from hillsides {{unless there is a}} seepage area. The fertility of <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> <b>is</b> another factor—settlers in Canterbury used the presence of the species to situate their homesteads and gardens. The fallen leaves of the tree also help to raise the fertility of the soil when they break down. Another factor is temperature, especially the degree of frost. Young trees are killed by frost, and even old trees can be cut back. This is why C.australis is absent from upland areas and from very frosty inland areas.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} soil {{series in the}} {{watershed}} of Mud Creek is the Watson-Berks-Alvira series. It is a shaly silt loam that mostly occurs in the watershed's plains and highlands. Other soil series in the watershed include the Berks-Weikert-Bedington series and the Chenango-Pope-Holly series. The Chenango-Pope-Holly occupies areas near the creek itself in its lower reaches and the Berks-Weikert-Bedington series occurs {{throughout most of the}} southern edge of the watershed. All other parts of the watershed lie over soil of the Berks-Weikert-Bedington series. 80 percent of <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> <b>is</b> of the Watson-Berks-Alvira series, 12 percent is of the Berks-Weikert-Bedington series, and 8 percent is of the Chenango-Pope-Holly series. The Holly-Monogahela-Basher soil association is found in the floodplain of the creek.|$|E
5|$|The roots are, generally, an {{underground}} {{part of the}} tree, but some tree species have evolved roots that are aerial. The common purposes for aerial roots may be of two kinds, {{to contribute to the}} mechanical stability of the tree, and to obtain oxygen from air. An instance of mechanical stability enhancement is the red mangrove that develops prop roots that loop out of the trunk and branches and descend vertically into the mud. A similar structure is developed by the Indian banyan. Many large trees have buttress roots which flare out from {{the lower part of the}} trunk. These brace the tree rather like angle brackets and provide stability, reducing sway in high winds. They are particularly prevalent in tropical rainforests where <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> <b>is</b> poor and the roots are close to the surface.|$|E

5|$|The {{settlements}} of Hale and Hale Barns {{are closely}} linked; what {{would later become}} Hale Barns {{spent most of the}} medieval period {{as an extension of the}} more dominant Hale. During this era the land around Hale and Hale Barns was used agriculturally because although <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> <b>is</b> poor draining, it is fertile. By the middle of the 15th century Hale Barns had established an identity completely separate from neighbouring Hale as demonstrated by the tithe barn which was established around this time. The tithe barn was for storing the tithes – a tenth of the farm's produce which was to be given to the church. Such an establishment can be seen as a sign of the area's prosperity. The original barn no longer survives but there is a drawing of it (from 1844). It is the source of the village's name. The first explicit reference to the village of Hale Barns– rather than Hale– is in a document from 1616.|$|E
5|$|The town {{experiences}} long {{summers and}} short winters,and receives an average yearly rainfall of , {{mainly from the}} north-east monsoon between October and December. Its {{close proximity to the}} sea means that Sirkazhi receives more rainfall than neighbouring towns. Sirkazhi is part of the Cauvery delta region and has irrigation channels, called the Kollidam channels, which carry water from the rivers and provide a rich deposit of fertile silt before reaching the sea. <b>The</b> <b>soil</b> <b>is</b> black and contains fertile alluvial sediment. The area's main crop is rice; other crops grown in the area are coconut, tamarind and neem. The landscape mostly consists of plain lands with fields and small portions of scrub jungle. Antelope, spotted deer, wild hog, jackal and fox are present in the jungles and outlying areas of the town. Crow and ordinary game birds are found in large numbers in the town.|$|E
5|$|Bluebells are {{a species}} of {{deciduous}} woodland over much of their range, flowering and leafing early before the canopy closes in late spring. They may also be found growing under bracken or Japanese knotweed, perennial plants which also form stands with a dense summer canopy. They are most successful on slightly acid soils; the same niche in alkaline conditions may be occupied by other species such as Mercurialis perennis. As a species adapted to woodlands, the young shoots are able to penetrate through {{a thick layer of}} leaf litter, and bluebells are often used as an indicator species to identify ancient woodland. Bluebells are also frequently found in hedgerows, and in the west of their range they can be found growing in open habitats, including coastal meadows. Bluebell flowers are rich in pollen and nectar, and are chiefly pollinated by bumblebees, although they are also visited by various other insects. They are a host species for the parasitic fungus Uromyces muscari, which causes bluebell rust. The ability of H.non-scripta to take up phosphorus from <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> <b>is</b> greatly enhanced by the presence of arbuscular mycorrhizae in its roots.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Aiming {{to reduce}} {{herbicide}} leaching, “in situ ” adsorption of herbicide−micelle formulations to <b>soils</b> <b>was</b> explored. Sulfentrazone or metolachlor were solubilized in cationic micelles, and these herbicide−micelle formulations {{were applied to}} sandy and alluvial soils. Sulfentrazone adsorption to <b>the</b> <b>soils</b> <b>was</b> negligible; however, its adsorption via its solubilization in micelles and their adsorption to <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> <b>was</b> significant and in good agreement with the Freundlich and Langmuir models. Adsorption of solubilized herbicide to <b>the</b> sandy <b>soil</b> <b>was</b> higher than to <b>the</b> alluvial <b>soil.</b> <b>The</b> low ratio between the surfactant concentration and the cation exchange capacity (CEC) of <b>the</b> alluvial <b>soil</b> brought upon micelle decomposition and reduction in herbicide adsorption. Therefore, an optimized ratio between surfactant and <b>soil</b> CEC <b>was</b> chosen to maximize herbicide retention. Even upon adding relatively low loadings of surfactant (0. 075 − 0. 3 % w/w soil), herbicide leaching through <b>the</b> <b>soils</b> <b>was</b> significantly reduced (2 − 5 -fold) {{in comparison with the}} commercial formulations...|$|R
