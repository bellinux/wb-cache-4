Warhol went on to {{purchase}} a Monroe publicity still from the film Niagara, which he later cropped and used to create {{one of his most}} well-known works: his painting of Marilyn. Although Warhol continued painting other pop art, including Martinson's coffee cans, Coca-Cola bottles, S Green Stamps, and Campbell's Soup cans, he soon became known to many as <b>the</b> <b>artist</b> <b>who</b> painted celebrities. He returned to Blum's gallery to exhibit Elvis and Liz in October 1963. His fans Dennis Hopper and Brooke Hayward (Hopper's wife at the time) held a welcoming party for the event.|$|E

25|$|The pulpit was sculpted between 1255-1260 by Nicola Pisano, {{father of}} Giovanni Pisano, <b>the</b> <b>artist</b> <b>who</b> {{produced}} the pulpit in the Duomo. The scenes on the pulpit, {{and especially the}} classical form of the naked Hercules, show at best Nicola Pisano's abilities {{as the most important}} precursor of Italian renaissance sculpture by reinstating antique representations. Therefore, surveys of the Italian Renaissance usually begin with the year 1260, the year that Nicola Pisano dated this pulpit.|$|E

25|$|An {{earthenware}} bowl from Iran, over 5000 years old, {{could be}} considered a predecessor of the zoetrope. This bowl is decorated in a series of images portraying a goat jumping toward a tree and eating its leaves.

25|$|Malfatti {{is thought}} to have been rather {{discouraged}} from her reception of her highly debated exposition and so it would make sense that she would try to please her audience. However, at the same time, other artists such as Tarsila do Amaral were becoming highly evolved in their search for the Brazilian identity and culture. Although Malfatti's courage and formally trained style introduced a new development to Brazilians, she almost sacrificed her artistic career simply to pave the path for other artists to forge ahead. However she will always be celebrated as <b>the</b> <b>artist</b> <b>who</b> brought Modernism to Brazil and, as that is no small feat, her impact is legendary.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>artist</b> <b>who</b> most {{extended}} the trends in Titian's large figurative compositions is Tintoretto, although his personal manner {{was such that}} he only lasted nine days as Titian's apprentice. Rembrandt's knowledge {{of the works of}} both Titian and Raphael is apparent in his portraits. The direct influences of Leonardo and Raphael upon their own pupils was to effect generations of artists including Poussin and schools of Classical painters of the 18th and 19th centuries. Antonello da Messina's work had a direct influence on Albrecht Dürer and Martin Schongauer and through the latter's engravings, countless artists including the German, Dutch and English schools of stained glass makers extending into the early 20th century.|$|E

25|$|The {{earliest}} paintings, on the triumphal arch, {{were created}} around 1350. They depict the Four Evangelists, {{as well as}} St Christopher and St George. The most famous frescos are however those dating back to about 1500 which cover {{large areas of the}} church's ceiling and upper walls. In the so-called Biblia pauperum style, they present many of the most popular stories from the Old and New Testaments in typological juxtapositions. <b>The</b> <b>artist,</b> <b>who</b> can be identified by his emblem, is known simply as the Elmelunde Master as it was he who also painted the frescos in Møn's Elmelunde Church. The warm colours ranging from dark red and russet to yellow, green, grey and black are distinctive.|$|E
25|$|Double Fine's second {{project was}} Brütal Legend, a hybrid real time strategy, action-adventure game {{following}} a heavy metal roadie named Eddie Riggs, {{whose name is}} derived from both Eddie the Head, the Iron Maiden mascot, and Derek Riggs, <b>the</b> <b>artist</b> <b>who</b> created the mascot. The story follows Eddie as he is transported to a fantasy world in which demons have enslaved humanity. Tim Schafer has credited {{the inspiration for the}} game to the lore, fantasy themes, and epic Norse mythology of heavy metal music found in both its lyrical content and its album art. Brütal Legend was published by Electronic Arts and was released in North America on October 13, 2009 for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, and later for Microsoft Windows.|$|E
25|$|In 1970, Melanie was {{the only}} artist to ignore the court {{injunction}} banning the Powder Ridge Rock Festival, playing for the crowd on a homemade stage powered by Mister Softee trucks. Shortly following this performance, she played at the Strawberry Fields Festival held from August 7 to 9, 1970, at Mosport Park, Ontario. She also performed at the Isle of Wight Festival in 1970 where she was introduced by Keith Moon and received four standing ovations (she also appeared at the 2010 Isle of Wight festival). She was also <b>the</b> <b>artist</b> <b>who</b> sang to herald in the summer solstice at Glastonbury Fayre (later the Glastonbury Festival) in England in June 1971.

25|$|Sacrum bone {{found in}} Tequixquiac is {{considered}} a work of prehistoric art. The town was inhabited in 35,000 BCE by primitive men who had crossed the Bering Strait from Asia. These people were nomadic, hunting large animals such as mammoths and gathering fruits as evidenced by archaeological evidence found at the site. One of the most salient discoveries of primitive art in America was found in here, called the Tequixquiac Bone, which had no known purpose, but reflected the ideological sense of <b>the</b> <b>artist</b> <b>who</b> carved the piece of bone from a camelid around 22,000 years BCE. The first native settlers of Tequixquiac were the Aztecs and Otomi, who decided to settle here permanently for the abundance of rivers and springs. They were engaged mainly in agriculture and the breeding of domestic animals.|$|E
25|$|The {{drawings}} {{produced in}} the course of the three years of the artist's life thus absorbed, are notable for showing, apart from a real power of interpreting the local character of each scene, a rare sense of the dramatic, the gift of effective silhouetting being particularly characteristic. We see here well exemplified the profit which <b>the</b> <b>artist</b> (<b>who</b> long taught mural painting at Warsaw Academy) derived from his protracted studies of the frescoes in Rome and Assisi. Figure-drawing, of a very incisive kind, inevitably comes much to the fore in scenes which succeed each other on the walls of the exhibition, but many of the impressions of landscape, here displayed, will also remain impressed upon the spectator's memory. Altogether, this is an art very much in the best Polish tradition, and with an individual note definitely its own.|$|E
