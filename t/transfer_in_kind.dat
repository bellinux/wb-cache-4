40|$|We measure area-specific {{poverty in}} the European Union (EU) at the second level of the {{nomenclature}} of territorial units for statistics (NUTS 2). We construct the regional human poverty index (RHPI), which comprises four dimensions: social exclusion, knowledge, a decent standard of living, and a long and healthy life. The RHPI provides information regarding the relative standing of a given country {{with respect to the}} level of poverty but also shows the variability of poverty within a country with respect to NUTS 2. The approach we propose has four properties. (1) Because the RHPI comprises only six indicators it is relatively simple to be replicated in subsequent years. (2) The RHPI provides information about the absolute magnitude of poverty experienced by Europeans in a given country and provides information about the relative standing of the country. (3) The RHPI shows the variability of poverty within a country with respect to NUTS 2. (4) The RHPI shows satisfactory statistical coherence confirmed by the results of correlation analysis and principal component analysis. As confirmed by uncertainty analysis, the RHPI also shows satisfactory robustness to the normative assumptions made during the construction process. The RHPI also has some limitations. First, the conceptual model of the RHPI relies mostly on the conceptualisation of the poverty index proposed by the United Nations (UN) and data availability. Second, although research on poverty has developed rapidly in recent years, it has failed to establish the relative importance of poverty dimensions and thus guide us in establishing aggregation weights. This failure has resulted in a necessity to formulate certain a priori assumptions. Third, all indicators we proposed are of objective nature, which may influence the results and final conclusions. However, this is intentional and reflects the best approach that is achievable (due to lack of disaggregated at the NUTS 2 level subjective indicators) in order to measure {{poverty in the}} NUTS 2 regions. Fourth, in our computations percentage of population below the income poverty line in NUTS 2 regions are calculated using national poverty lines and without taking into account social transfers in kind. Regarding the social <b>transfer</b> <b>in</b> <b>kind,</b> without this type of adjustment household income is generally underestimated in countries with extensive public services, like in the Nordic member states, and overestimated in those where households have to pay for most of these services (Annoni et al., 2012; EC, 2010). However, disaggregated at the NUTS 2 level data with this respect are not available, therefore our approach is the best achievable. Then, the national, instead of the regional, poverty lines are applied to highlight the differences between regions within the same country, as suggested by Betti at al. (2012). The RHPI is computed for all NUTS 2 regions in 28 EU countries. Our results show that the scale of poverty differs considerably within the EU countries, with RHPI scores ranging between 9. 23 for Prague and more than 65 for Bulgarian Yugoiztochen and Severozapaden. We also find that substantial differences in levels of poverty between regions are present in all of the EU countries. The only exceptions to this finding are small EU countries where neither NUTS 1 nor NUTS 2 regions exist. Our results also show that, in general, in NUTS 2 regions comprising a capital, the poverty level is lower than the country average. The only exceptions are Vienna, Brussels, and Berlin, where poverty measured by the RHPI is higher than the country average. By contrast, Bucharest, Sofia, Bratislava, Prague, Budapest, and Madrid exhibit decisively lower levels of poverty than their country averagesJRC. DDG. 01 -Econometrics and applied statistic...|$|E

40|$|Welfare {{programs}} are often implemented in-kind to promote out-comes {{that might not}} be realized under cash transfers. This paper tests whether such paternalistically motivated transfers are justified compared to cash, using a randomized controlled trial of Mexico’s food assistance program. In relation to total food consumption, the in-kind transfer was infra-marginal and nondistorting. However, the transfer contained ten food items, and there was large variation in the extent to which individual foods were extra-marginal and distort-ing. Small differences in the nutritional intake of women and chil-dren under in-kind transfers did not lead to meaningful differential improvements in health outcomes compared to cash. (JEL I 14, I 18, I 38, O 15) Welfare transfers are often made <b>in</b> <b>kind</b> rather than <b>in</b> cash. In fact, the govern-mental provision of health care, housing, child care, and food vastly dominate cash <b>transfers</b> <b>in</b> most countries, both developing and developed (Tabor 2002; Tesliuc 2006).

40|$|Emergency {{programs}} {{are designed to}} soften the impact of economic crises-income shocks experienced by an entire community or country-on consumption and human capital accumulation. Of particular concern are poor people: {{as a result of}} inadequate savings or inadequate access to credit or insurance markets, the poor are unable to draw on resources from better times to offset a loss in income today. Further, the systemic nature of the shocks means that risk cannot be effectively pooled through local informal insurance mechanisms. Emergency interventions have included social funds, workfare programs, training programs, conditional transfers (linked to health center visits or children's school attendance, for example), and traditional direct, unconditional <b>transfers</b> <b>in</b> <b>kind</b> (such as communal tables or targeted food handouts). The author highlights some conceptual problems in choosing among these options and evaluating one program of a certain type relative to another. It argues that most such interventions {{can be thought of as}} containing both a transfer and an investment component and that their evaluation as emergency programs needs to more explicitly incorporate the intertemporal nature of their design. More specifically, the mandated investments in physical or human capital will benefit the poor, but only in the future-after the crisis-and their implementation diverts resources from alleviating present hardship. This needs to be reflected in the discount factor used to evaluate these investments. Maloney argues that the way emergency {{programs are}} financed, particularly the way the burden is shared between central and municipal governments, also has important implications for the criteria for evaluation. The analysis suggests that most conventional means of evaluating projects-net present value at market discount rates, labor intensity, cost per job created-may not be relevant or are at least ambiguous in the context of emergency programs. As a result, policymakers are left with few"hard"indicators with which to evaluate such programs. Maloney argues for an approach in which the policymaker weighs the appropriateness of deviations from the theoretically"ideal"benchmark program, which delivers a"smart"transfer costlessly to the target beneficiary, and discusses the arguments for or against these deviations. The modest goal of the proposed approach is to clarify the key issues and provide more solid grounding for the necessarily subjective judgment calls that policymakers will inevitably have to make.

40|$|We analyze four interrelated {{aspects of}} {{economic}} convergence and their linkages {{over the period}} 1999 - 2013, drawing on the experiences of 26 member states of the European Union, with special focus on the ten Central and East-European new members (the EU 10). These aspects are (1) real economic, (2) price level, (3) structural and (4) wage level convergence. Real economic and price level convergence, respectively, refer to the narrowing of the income (productivity) and the price level gap between the more and less affluent countries. Regarding structural convergence, {{we focus on the}} evolution of the share and the relative price of private and public services, measured from the expenditure side. As for wage convergence, we address the catching up of nominal and real labor costs, as well as net earnings of the poorer countries to the more developed ones. Our empirical analysis of convergence draws on both the cross-section and the dynamic relationships revealed by the data. Regarding real and price convergence, we show that there was a rapid catch-up in both per capita GDPs and general price levels of the less developed EU-countries until 2008, followed by a significant slow-down. We also show that there is a tendency for price levels to converge towards the trend implied by the longer-term relationship between real per capita GDPs and price levels. Our research affirms and amends the finding that positive/negative deviations from the trend ("over/undervaluations") have a negative/positive effect on real economic convergence. Relying on cross-country price level indices (PLIs), we demonstrate that the relative price of services does, but their "real" share (measured at common prices of the EU) does not increase along with real income. We show that this is mainly {{due to the fact that}} non-market services (<b>in</b> particular government <b>transfers</b> <b>in</b> <b>kind)</b> have a relatively high, though slowly declining real share in the less developed EU countries, which also helps us understand, why net real wages are relatively low in these countries (as compared to their relative level of income/productivity).

The results, which were obtained with calf liver microsomal fractions as enzyme source and dolichyl diphosphate di-N-acetyl [14 C] chitobiose as glycosyl donor showed that the threonine-, serine- and cysteine-containing derivatives could be glycosylated, although at very different rates, whereas the valine and O-methylthreonine analogues did not work as glycosyl acceptors. Replacement of threonine by serine resulted in a 4 -fold decrease in Vmax, and about a 10 -fold increase in Km for glycosyl transfer. Replacement of serine by cysteine again decreased acceptor activity 2 - 3 -fold.

Summarizing, we performed the following steps successively: The seven WC stars in the LMC, for which we obtained HST data, have been analyzed quantitatively, and conclusions concerning stellar evolution have been drawn. The model atmospheres were considerably improved by the inclusion of iron line blanketing and now can reproduce the observed spectra much better. The radiative acceleration obtained by the model calculations is almost sufficient to account for the acceleration of the observed stellar winds, thus suggesting that WR winds are basically driven by radiation pressure.

The {{purpose of the present study}} is to investigate the nature of syntactic <b>transfer</b> <b>in</b> all <b>kinds</b> of verb transitivity from the interlanguage of Taiwanese EFL college students. The subjects were 56 juniors. The instruments included a demographic questionnaire, a translation test with prompts, and a retrospective report. The demographic questionnaire was used to understand the subjects’ personal learning background. The test measured four verb transitivities: complete verb transitivity, incomplete verb transitivity, complete verb intransitivity, and incomplete verb intransitivity. Test takers translated sentences from Chinese into English by using the prompts. When translating, they had to first mark their familiarity with the verb usage in order to explore the extent to which they employed syntactic knowledge or the guessing skills. Finally, each subject wrote a retrospective report to reflect the possible reasons why they made mistakes in the items whose translations resembled Chinese structures. The difficulty and familiarity level of each item and the percentages of using incorrect verb transitivity were calculated and analyzed. The results showed that the extent of syntactic <b>transfer</b> <b>in</b> verb transitivity is not as large as the previous studies. However, both negative and positive <b>transfers</b> were found <b>in</b> the learners’ interlanguage. It is interesting to note that for the verbs which the learners were confident with, they were not even aware that they made errors. It seems that familiarity of the meaning of certain verbs made themselves believe that they have acquired the knowledge of the usage and use of the verb transitivity. This study contributed to a growing understanding of the language <b>transfer</b> <b>in</b> verb transitivity...|$|R

It is a basic set of social rights derived from human right treaties, including access to essential services (such as health, education, housing, water and sanitation, and others, as defined nationally) and social <b>transfers,</b> <b>in</b> cash or <b>in</b> <b>kind,</b> to guarantee income security, food security, adequate nutrition and access to essential services.|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{the rich}} {{countries}} should be to aid the poor countries to increase {{their standard of living}} but not to increase their holding of weapons. It is shown that a basic conflict of goals arises. The structure of consumption of the recipient countries cannot be influenced by giving the aid in the form of (civilian) goods in contrast to, the transfer of untied foreign exchange. In any case there results a substitution towards the bundle of commodities desired by the developing countries. Compared to that situation, the consumption of civilian goods can be induced to increase by granting a price-subsidy which, however, leads to a smaller increase in. utility than with a <b>transfer</b> <b>in</b> money or <b>kind.</b> <b>Transfers</b> of goods with restricted substitutability and all-or-none schemes are suggested to overcome the conflicts mentioned but they are most difficult to put into practice. To be effective, they imply an interference with the internal affairs of the poor countries which is per se undesirable. The paper suggests. that much more thought should be given to this important problem which is only rarely explicitely considered but which is most difficult to solve...|$|R
