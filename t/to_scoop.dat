5|$|Palestinians bake {{a variety}} of {{different}} kinds of breads: they include khubz, pita and markook and taboon. Khubz is an everyday bread and is very similar to pita. It often takes the place of utensils; It is torn into bite size pieces and used <b>to</b> <b>scoop</b> various dips such as hummus or ful. Markook bread is a paper-thin unleavened bread and when unfolded it is almost transparent. Taboon receives its name from the ovens used to bake them.|$|E
5|$|Mouse lemurs (Microcebus), sifakas (Propithecus), and the indri (Indri) {{use their}} toothcombs <b>to</b> <b>scoop</b> up fruit pulp. Other small lemuriforms, such as fork-marked lemurs (Phaner), the hairy-eared dwarf lemur (Allocebus), and galagos (particularly the genera Galago and Euoticus) use their toothcombs to tooth-scrape plant exudates, such as gum and sap. In fork-marked lemurs, the toothcomb is {{specially}} adapted to minimize food trapment since the interdental spaces are greatly reduced. The herbivorous colugos in the genus Cynocephalus may also use their toothcomb for food procurement.|$|E
5|$|Most microbats, {{especially}} in temperate areas, prey on insects. The diet of an insectivorous bat may span {{a wide range}} of species, including flies, beetles, moths, grasshoppers, crickets, termites, bees, wasps, mayflies and caddisflies. Large numbers of Mexican free-tailed bats (Tadarida brasiliensis) fly hundreds of meters above the ground in central Texas to feed on migrating moths. Species that hunt insects in flight, like the little brown bat (Myotis lucifugus), may catch an insect in mid-air with its mouth, and eat it in the air or use their tail membranes or wings <b>to</b> <b>scoop</b> up the insect and carry it to the mouth. The bat may also take the insect back to its roost and eat it there. Slower moving bat species such as the brown long-eared bat (Plecotus auritus) and many horseshoe bat species, may take or glean insects from vegatation or hunt them from perches. Insectivorous bats living at high latitudes have to consume prey with higher energetic value than tropical bats.|$|E
40|$|When {{we listen}} to a singer, {{a large amount of}} {{time-varying}} information is available on which evaluations of accuracy may be based. Most analyses of singing accuracy focus on relatively steady portions of sung notes, eliminating “scoops” of pitch that often occur at note beginnings and endings. However, it is likely that these <b>scoops</b> contribute <b>to</b> judgments of accuracy. We report results of three experiments designed to address the relative contribution of these <b>scoops</b> in contrast <b>to</b> a steady central portion of sung notes. Participants rated the pitch accuracy of 4 -tone melodies where the 3 rd tone was manipulated with respect to its center region (either correct, 50 cents sharp, or 50 cents flat) as well as the presence of a scoop at the start and/or the end of the tone, varying with respect to direction. We were particularly interested in contrasting scoops that maintained ‘continuity’ between tones (e. g., scooping up for an ascending interval) versus those that highlighted distinctions (the opposite). Further analyses evaluated whether reactions <b>to</b> <b>scoops</b> indicate a tendency to perceive the average pitch across the entire tone, or <b>to</b> treat <b>scoops</b> versus the tone’s center as separate features. Results suggest that listeners respond <b>to</b> <b>scoops</b> in a way that goes beyond role in forming the average pitch across a tone. Listeners respond differently <b>to</b> <b>scoops</b> at the beginning versus the end, showing more sensitivity <b>to</b> ending <b>scoops.</b> Furthermore, listeners do not necessarily prefer scoops that preserve continuity. Taken together, these results demonstrate that continuous time-varying pitch information is an important indicator of perceived singing accuracy, and should be considered more fully when assessing singing ability.

5|$|The katipo {{typically}} catches wandering ground invertebrates such as beetles (e.g. Cecyropa modesta) or amphipods (e.g. Bellorchestia quoyana), {{but it may}} occasionally catch moths, flies, {{and other}} spiders. Katipo can catch insects much larger than themselves. These larger insects often become entangled in the web and in the ensuing struggle, the web's ground anchor line breaks. Due to the silk's elasticity, this causes the prey to become suspended a few centimetres off the ground. The katipo then moves to the prey, turns so that the spinnerets are facing the insect and spins silk over it. Like most theridiids, the tarsi of the hind legs have a row of strong curved bristles which are arranged as a comb. The katipo uses these <b>to</b> <b>scoop</b> sticky silk from her spinnerets and throws it over the insect {{with a series of}} rapid movements. After the insect is firmly immobilised, she bites it several times, usually at the joints, before spinning more silk to strengthen the web, and then administering a last long bite which ultimately kills the insect. The spider then moves the prey up into the web until it is ready to eat. If food is readily available then it is common to see five or six insects hanging in the web waiting to be ingested. The male's hunting behaviour is similar to the female's, although may not be as vigorous due to its smaller size.|$|E

25|$|Biryani is a {{very popular}} dish in Pakistan, and has many varieties, such as Lahori and Sindhi biryani. Tahiri, which is a {{vegetarian}} form of biryani, is also popular. All of the main dishes (except those made with rice) are eaten alongside bread. To eat, a small fragment of bread is torn off with the right hand and used <b>to</b> <b>scoop</b> and hold small portions of the main dish. Pickles made out of mangoes, carrots, lemon, etc. are also commonly used to further spice up the food.|$|E
25|$|In {{terms of}} shape, injera compares to the French crêpe and the Indian dosa as a flatbread cooked {{in a circle}} and used as a base for other foods. The taste and texture, however, are unlike the crêpe and dosa, and more similar to the South Indian appam. The bottom surface of the injera, which touches the heating surface, will have a {{relatively}} smooth texture, while the top will become porous.

25|$|Traditionally, {{meals in}} India were eaten while seated {{either on the}} floor or on very low stools or cushions. Food is most often eaten with the right hand rather than cutlery. The left hand is used to serve oneself when the courses are not served by the host. Often roti is used <b>to</b> <b>scoop</b> curry without {{allowing}} it to touch the hand. In the wheat-producing north, a piece of roti is gripped with the thumb and middle finger and ripped off while holding the roti down with the index finger. A somewhat different method {{is used in the}} south for the dosai, the adai, and the uththappam, where the middle finger is pressed down to hold the crepe down and the forefinger and thumb used to grip and separate a small part. Traditional serving styles vary regionally throughout India.|$|E
25|$|Australia {{returned}} for a seven-match ODI series in India in October, and Tendulkar made 14, 4, 32 and 40 {{in the first four}} games. In the fifth match, with the series tied at 2–2, Australia amassed 350/4 in 50 overs. Tendulkar made his 45th ODI hundred, a 175 off 141 balls.

500|$|Beyond these {{questions}} of scale and selection, {{the motives of}} both the British press and the government in publicizing Hadzimuratovic's case and then in launching Operation Irma were challenged. Some critics disparaged as hypocritical the sudden intensity of coverage devoted to a single victim of what was already a protracted siege. In December 1993 another Sarajevo evacuation program, 'Operation Angel,' received minimal press coverage in the UK, and the Financial Times suggested that such human interest stories captured the popular imagination only during the British press's summer 'silly season' when Parliament was in recess. Susan Douglas, in the October 1993 edition of American magazine The Progressive, said British papers had indulged in [...] "a ghoulish competition <b>to</b> <b>scoop</b> each other over Irma's condition and to use her evacuation to salve British guilt about standing apart from the carnage in Bosnia." ...|$|E
500|$|The poor playing {{conditions}} {{resulted in}} frequent fumbles by both teams and prevented either team from converting a single first down.

On fourth down, Lewis kicked a field goal from the 18-yard line with the ball having [...] "barely enough power" [...] to go over the crossbar.|$|E
500|$|Digging in swamps {{was more}} complicated; a longer spear (up to 8m) was often used, often {{fitted with a}} hooked end <b>to</b> <b>scoop</b> out the lumps. Scrub was often cleared first with fire; some got {{out of control and}} swamp fires could burn for weeks. Holes were often dug by teams in both hills and swamps—often up to 12m deep—and some {{wetlands}} were drained to aid in the excavation of gum. As field gum became scarce, [...] "bush gum" [...] was obtained by purposely cutting the bark of kauri trees and returning months later to retrieve the hardened resin. Due to the damage caused to the trees by the cutting the practice was banned in state forests in 1905. Gum chips, small lumps useful for the manufacture of linoleum, were difficult to find, and by 1910, the process of washing and sieving to retrieve the chips became common. The process was later mechanised.|$|E
