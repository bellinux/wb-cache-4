5|$|Damage to the {{oculomotor nerve}} (III) can cause double vision (diplopia) and {{inability}} {{to coordinate the}} movements of both eyes (strabismus), also eyelid drooping (ptosis) and pupil dilation (mydriasis). Lesions may also lead to inability to open the eye due to paralysis of the levator palpebrae muscle. Individuals suffering from a lesion to the oculomotor nerve may compensate by tilting <b>their</b> <b>heads</b> <b>to</b> alleviate symptoms due to paralysis {{of one or more}} of the eye muscles it controls.|$|E
5|$|In West African cultures, {{women with}} long hair were highly valued. Long, thick hair {{was seen as a}} sign of health, strength, and {{capability}} to bear many children. In keeping with this general theme, women who were too young for marriage would shave a portion of <b>their</b> <b>heads</b> <b>to</b> signal so. This tradition, however, did not extend to every West African culture, as several valued shorter hair.|$|E

5|$|Yuan Shao {{challenged}} Cao Cao {{for control}} over the emperor. Yuan's power was greatly diminished after Cao defeated him at the Battle of Guandu in 200 AD. After Yuan died, Cao killed Yuan Shao's son Yuan Tan (173–205 AD), who had fought with his brothers over the family inheritance. His brothers Yuan Shang and Yuan Xi were killed in 207 AD by Gongsun Kang (d.221 AD), who sent <b>their</b> <b>heads</b> <b>to</b> Cao Cao.|$|E
5|$|Pliny the Elder and {{his party}} saw flames coming from several parts of the crater. After staying overnight, the party was driven from the {{building}} by an accumulation of material, presumably tephra, which threatened to block all egress. They woke Pliny, who had been napping and emitting loud snoring. They elected {{to take to the}} fields with pillows tied to <b>their</b> <b>heads</b> <b>to</b> protect them from the raining debris. They approached the beach again but the wind prevented the ships from leaving. Pliny sat down on a sail that had been spread for him and could not rise even with assistance when his friends departed. Though Pliny the Elder died, his friends ultimately escaped by land.|$|E
5|$|In 1943, Dominik von Kripp {{suggested}} that the crest may {{have served as a}} rudder, an idea embraced by several later researchers. One researcher, Ross S. Stein, even {{suggested that}} the crest may have supported a membrane of skin connecting the backward-pointing crest to the neck and back, increasing its surface area and effectiveness as a rudder. The rudder hypothesis again, {{does not take into account}} females nor P. sternbergi, which had an upward-pointing, not backward-pointing crest. Bennett also found that even in its capacity as a rudder, the crest would not provide nearly so much directional force as simply maneuvering the wings. The suggestion that the crest was an air brake, and that the animals would turn <b>their</b> <b>heads</b> <b>to</b> the side in order to slow down, suffers from a similar problem. Additionally, the rudder and air brake hypotheses do not explain why such large variation exists in crest size even among adults.|$|E

5|$|The work {{performed}} by breaker boys was hazardous. Breaker boys {{were forced to}} work without gloves {{so that they could}} better handle the slick coal. The slate, however, was sharp, and breaker boys would often leave work with their fingers cut and bleeding. Breaker boys sometimes also had their fingers amputated by the rapidly moving conveyor belts. Others lost feet, hands, arms, and legs as they moved among the machinery and became caught under conveyor belts or in gears. Many were crushed to death, their bodies retrieved from the gears of the machinery by supervisors only {{at the end of the}} working day. Others were caught in the rush of coal, and crushed to death or smothered. Dry coal would kick up so much dust that breaker boys sometimes wore lamps on <b>their</b> <b>heads</b> <b>to</b> see, and asthma and black lung disease were common. Coal was often washed to remove impurities, which created sulfuric acid. The acid burned the hands of the breaker boys.|$|E

25|$|Evidently {{the costume}} {{of the poorest}} classes is represented; but as the cord gave no {{protection}} against {{the heat of the}} sun, there is little probability that the custom lasted very long. Much more common was the simple cloth skullcap, dating back to Egyptian times when those of high society routinely shaved <b>their</b> <b>heads,</b> <b>to</b> prevent lice. Conversely, their skullcaps then served as protection against irritation from their wigs.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Burgomaster (Mayor) Heinrich Denicke offered {{safe passage}} {{out of town}} to the Freikorps if they would disarm. Berthold refused it. Past noon, when the workers had gathered, a machine gun fired over <b>their</b> <b>heads</b> <b>to</b> clear an exit passage out of the school. Instead of fleeing, the union men shot back. In the ensuing firefight, 13 workers and three Freikorps combatants were killed. An {{additional}} eight Freikorps fighters were summarily executed after capture by the laborers. The school grounds were encircled. The Freikorps was besieged.|$|E

25|$|The Ottoman army then {{proceeded}} to the plain between Parasyros and Skoutari which was called 'Agio Pigada' which means 'Holy Wells' because of the monastery on the hill above the plain being surrounded by wells. The Maniot army advance to Parasyros and sent three brothers as envoys to Ghazi. They demanded that Ghazi and his men retreat or they would face to fight the Maniot army. Seeing that his army outnumbered than the Maniot army, he responded by beheading the Maniots' envoys and sending <b>their</b> <b>heads</b> <b>to</b> the Maniots on silver plates.|$|E
25|$|Ophthalmoplegia or the {{inability}} or difficulty {{to move the}} eye is usually symmetrical. As such, double vision is sometimes a complaint of these patients. The progressive ophthalmoplegia is often unnoticed till decreased ocular motility limits peripheral vision. Often someone else will point out the ocular disturbance to the patient. Patients will move <b>their</b> <b>heads</b> <b>to</b> adjust {{for the loss of}} peripheral vision caused by inability to abduct or adduct the eye. All directions of gaze are affected; however, downward gaze appears to be best spared. This is in contrast to progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), which typically affects vertical gaze and spares horizontal gaze.|$|E

Sun Song was known for being a gregarious and generous person and was the closest to Sun Quan among all of Sun Quan's younger male relatives. When Sun Song was {{stationed}} in Baqiu (巴丘), he was often reprimanded by Lu Xun, a senior Wu general and minister, for not maintaining good discipline in his unit and allowing his men to fool around. On one occasion, Lu Xun punished Sun Song's subordinates by ordering <b>their</b> <b>heads</b> <b>to</b> be shaved. Sun Song died in 231.|$|E

25|$|The Indian {{rhinoceros}} makes a {{wide variety}} of vocalisations. At least 10 distinct vocalisations have been identified: snorting, honking, bleating, roaring, squeak-panting, moo-grunting, shrieking, groaning, rumbling and humphing. In addition to noises, the rhino uses olfactory communication. Adult males urinate backwards, as far as 3–4 m behind them, often in response to being disturbed by observers. Like all rhinos, the Indian rhinoceros often defecates near other large dung piles. The Indian rhino has pedal scent glands which are used to mark their presence at these rhino latrines. Males have been observed walking with <b>their</b> <b>heads</b> <b>to</b> the ground as if sniffing, presumably following the scent of females.|$|E
25|$|In {{one of his}} verses, Cnut's court poet Sigvatr Þórðarson recounts {{that famous}} princes brought <b>their</b> <b>heads</b> <b>to</b> Cnut and bought peace. This verse {{mentions}} Olaf Haraldsson in the past tense, his death at the Battle of Stiklestad in 1030. It was therefore at some point after this and the consolidation of Norway that Cnut went to Scotland with an army, and the navy in the Irish Sea, in 1031, to receive, without bloodshed, the submission of three Scottish kings: Maelcolm, Maelbeth and Iehmarc. One of these kings, Iehmarc, may be one Echmarcach mac Ragnaill, an Uí Ímair chieftain and the ruler of a sea-kingdom of the Irish Sea, with Galloway among his domains.|$|E
25|$|In {{an attempt}} to bring Serbia under their control, in 920 the Byzantines sent Zaharija Pribislavljević, another of Mutimir's grandsons, to {{challenge}} the rule of Pavle. Zaharija was either captured by the Bulgarians en route or by Pavle, who had him duly delivered to SimeonI. Either way, Zaharija ended up in Preslav. Despite the setback, the Byzantines persisted and eventually bribed Pavle to switch sides after lavishing much gold on him. In response, in 921 SimeonI sent a Bulgarian army headed by Zaharija. The Bulgarian intervention was successful, Pavle was easily deposed, and once again a Bulgarian candidate {{was placed on the}} Serbian throne. This did not last long because Zaharija was raised in Constantinople where he was heavily influenced by the Byzantines. Soon, Zaharija openly declared his loyalty to the Byzantine Empire and commenced hostilities against Bulgaria. In 923 or 924 SimeonI sent a small army led by Theodore Sigritsa and Marmais, but they were ambushed and killed. Zaharija sent <b>their</b> <b>heads</b> <b>to</b> Constantinople.|$|E
