5|$|Because planetesimals are so numerous, {{and spread}} {{throughout}} the protoplanetary disk, some survive <b>the</b> <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> a planetary system. Asteroids are understood to be left-over planetesimals, gradually grinding each other down into smaller and smaller bits, while comets are typically planetesimals from the farther reaches of a planetary system. Meteorites are samples of planetesimals that reach a planetary surface, and provide {{a great deal of}} information about <b>the</b> <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> the Solar System. Primitive-type meteorites are chunks of shattered low-mass planetesimals, where no thermal differentiation took place, while processed-type meteorites are chunks from shattered massive planetesimals.|$|E

5|$|Dust {{particles}} tend {{to stick}} {{to each other in}} the dense disk environment, leading to <b>the</b> <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> larger particles up to several centimeters in size.

Further aggregation can lead to <b>the</b> <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> planetesimals measuring 1km across or larger, which are the building blocks of planets. Planetesimal formation is another unsolved problem of disk physics, as simple sticking becomes ineffective as dust particles grow larger.|$|E
