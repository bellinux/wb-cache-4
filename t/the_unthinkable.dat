He hoped that audiences would avoid getting stuck in the statistics of human trafficking and would connect with a personal story. The two questions that propel the story are: [...] "Can [...] convince [...] to risk her life to testify {{for the sake of}} justice?" [...] and [...] "Can he save her from <b>the</b> <b>unthinkable</b> circumstances?" [...] Jason is weary and, although he never falls into self-pity, he comes to hate himself for his inability to save Number 18 from her slavery because he lacks the evidence he requires for his case to be successful in court.|$|E

He played the surgeon Dr Toby Stephens in the BBC2 sitcom Doctors and Nurses. In 2005 he played Kate's hapless secretary Tim in the BBC's updating of The Taming of The Shrew in its ShakespeaRe-Told series. Mitchell appeared as various roles on the Channel 4 sketch programme Blunder. The show was not well received, with the British Sitcom Guide naming it as {{the worst thing that}} Mitchell did in all of 2006 in their [...] "British Sitcom Awards" [...] of that year. He portrayed the recurring character of Dr. James Vine in the BBC sitcom Jam and Jerusalem. Mitchell had a small part in the film I Could Never Be Your Woman, playing an English writer, also named David. While in Los Angeles to record the part he decided that he did not like the area much, and preferred filming in Britain.|$|E
500|$|Fox {{issued a}} press release on January 11 {{previewing}} the episode's plot. It concluded, [...] "While the girl's mind-bending condition intensifies, Walter dusts off some old lab videos and hypothesizes <b>the</b> <b>unthinkable,</b> sending Olivia and Peter to investigate the bewildering case in an original 'Unearthed' episode of Fringe and here's another mystery: is it an unaired episode from Season One or is it from an alternate universe?" [...] As the press release purposely alluded to whether the episode was indeed originally {{part of the first}} season or from the parallel universe, one critic wrote that [...] "FOX [...] having fun with the fact that Fringe has alternate universes" [...] and that readers of the press release should [...] "take this with a grain of salt". According to Fox's media site, [...] "Unearthed" [...] was listed as the 21st episode of season one, despite its broadcast during the second season and inclusion in that season's DVD release as a special feature. Though one character had been killed off earlier in the second season, a former series regular appeared in the episode, sparking confusion among some viewers. As the broadcasting change went unexplained at the time, one media outlet speculated it was a marketing ploy on the network's part, believing the episode title was [...] "more than a stunning coincidence" [...] and that it was a reference to co-creator J.J. Abrams' other television series, Lost.|$|E

500|$|Common law constitutionalism, a {{view that}} there are {{fundamental}} constitutional values that are protected even from interference by Parliament, had become increasingly popular {{at the time of}} Jackson. Four recent cases had found that [...] "in the absence of express language or necessary implication to the contrary, the courts [...] presume that even the most general words were intended to be subject to the basic rights of the individual". There had also been extrajudicial comments by serving judges that parliamentary sovereignty may not be absolute: Lord Woolf had written that [...] "if Parliament did <b>the</b> <b>unthinkable,</b> then I would say that courts would also be required to act in a manner which was without precedent" [...] while John Laws had argued that [...] "ultimate sovereignty rests ... not with those who wield governmental power, but in the conditions under which they are permitted to do so. The constitution, not the Parliament, is in this sense sovereign". However, Jackson contained the first express support from judges acting in their official capacity for the proposition that courts might have the authority to strike down an Act of Parliament if it violated fundamental constitutional principles (albeit obiter). This was a significant challenge to the orthodox view of parliamentary sovereignty, expressed by Albert Venn Dicey, that Parliament can make and unmake law on any topic and that no body can make a higher form of law than Parliament or set aside primary legislation.|$|E

Janalen Samson, a contributing Writer for BuddyTV noted the episodes generation of shock in the times of the omnipresent media saying, [...] "Genuine surprise is a rare occurrence in television viewing these days", and added, [...] "Imagine my amazement, then, when I sat down to watch [...] "How to Save a Life"". Calling the death a [...] "lightning bolt" [...] David Hinckley of New York Daily News wrote, [...] "In one of the most stunning moments from a high-mortality television season, [...] "Grey's Anatomy" [...] killed off Patrick Dempsey's Dr. Derek Shepherd". Also talking about the shock value Shepherd's death in her New York Post review Lindsay Putnam wrote, [...] "“Grey’s Anatomy” did <b>the</b> <b>unthinkable,</b> killing off {{one of the few remaining}} original cast members", additionally putting up the question of the future of the series asking, [...] "with Derek out of the picture, what will become of the rest of the Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital family? Is there still a future for “Grey’s Anatomy”?" [...] The sentiment was echoed by Slate writer Aisha Harris who weighed heavily upon importance of the death and its impact saying that despite the show’s ensemble cast, [...] "Meredith has always remained the central figure of Grey’s, so this death marks a very important turning point in the show". Optimistic of the prospects for the show, she added, [...] "if anyone can come out of this tragedy as a tougher, better character than ever, it’s Meredith Grey." ...|$|E
500|$|On 2 May, Benfica {{visited the}} new Estádio José Alvalade for a match that decided {{who would go}} to the 2004–05 UEFA Champions League. Sporting pressed hard from the start and {{dominated}} the first half, but Benfica managed to balance the game in the second, until they finally beat Sporting's defence with an 87th-minute goal. Rui Dias described the goal for Record: [...] "It wasn't until the 87th minute that the game knew its man of the match: Geovanni; if the game was destined to be generic, the Brazilian added inspiration and scored a spectacular goal that decided the game and almost certainly sealed <b>the</b> <b>unthinkable</b> second place for Benfica – who could have thought of that only a month ago?." [...] With the win, Benfica were only a point short of qualifying for the Champions League. Camacho praised the team, saying they had had a fantastic season. A week later, Benfica secured the second place in the league and the associated place in the third qualifying round of the Champions League with a 0–0 home draw against União de Leiria. Camacho later said: [...] "We finished in second place, because we did not give up.". Benfica's last game of the season was the 2004 Taça de Portugal Final. In a highly competitive match, Porto took the lead through Derlei on the 45th minute, before Benfica equalized by Fyssas on the 58th minute. In extra-time, Simão scored the winner, sealing Benfica's 24th Portuguese Cup. It was the first trophy for the team since 1996, ending the club longest drought. Camacho complimented his team, and dedicated the win to Fehér and Bruno Baião, a youth team player who had died the day before, also from heart related complications. In the post-season, although Camacho said he was preparing for the following season, he chose to depart to Real Madrid on 24 May, as he signed a 2-year deal.|$|E
