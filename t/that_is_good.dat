25|$|Karma, also {{refers to}} a {{conceptual}} principle that originated in India, often descriptively called the principle of karma, sometimes as the karma theory or the law of karma. In the context of theory, karma is complex and difficult to define. Different schools of Indologists derive different definitions for the karma concept from ancient Indian texts; their definition is some combination of (1) causality that may be ethical or non-ethical; (2) ethicization, <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>good</b> or bad actions have consequences; and (3) rebirth. Other Indologists include {{in the definition of}} karma theory that which explains the present circumstances of an individual with reference to his or her actions in past. These actions may be those in a person's current life, or, in some schools of Indian traditions, possibly actions in their past lives; furthermore, the consequences may result in current life, or a person's future lives. The law of karma operates independent of any deity or any process of divine judgment.|$|E
25|$|Reinforcement is the {{synergistic}} {{improvement of}} a total system’s strength created {{by the introduction of}} a geotextile, geogrid or geocell (all of which are good in tension) into a soil (<b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>good</b> in compression, but poor in tension) or other disjointed and separated material. Applications of this function are in mechanically stabilized and retained earth walls and steep soil slopes; they can be combined with masonry facings to create vertical retaining walls. Also involved is the application of basal reinforcement over soft soils and over deep foundations for embankments and heavy surface loadings. Stiff polymer geogrids and geocells {{do not have to be}} held in tension to provide soil reinforcement, unlike geotextiles. Stiff 2D geogrid and 3D geocells interlock with the aggregate particles and the reinforcement mechanism is one of confinement of the aggregate. The resulting mechanically stabilized aggregate layer exhibits improved loadbearing performance.|$|E
25|$|With the {{increasing}} speed of modern CPUs, parallel flash devices are often much {{slower than the}} memory bus of the computer they are connected to. Conversely, modern SRAM offers access times below 10ns, while DDR2 SDRAM offers access times below 20ns. Because of this, it is often desirable to shadow code stored in flash into RAM; that is, the code is copied from flash into RAM before execution, so that the CPU may access it at full speed. Device firmware may be stored in a serial flash device, and then copied into SDRAM or SRAM when the device is powered-up. Using an external serial flash device rather than on-chip flash removes the need for significant process compromise (a process <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>good</b> for high-speed logic is generally not good for flash and vice versa). Once it is decided to read the firmware in as one big block {{it is common to}} add compression to allow a smaller flash chip to be used. Typical applications for serial flash include storing firmware for hard drives, Ethernet controllers, DSL modems, wireless network devices, etc.|$|E

25|$|The {{natural law}} was {{inherently}} teleological, however, {{it is most}} assuredly not deontological. For Christians, natural law is how man manifests the divine image in his life. This mimicry of God's own life is impossible to accomplish except {{by means of the}} power of grace. Thus, whereas deontological systems merely require certain duties be performed, Christianity explicitly states that no one can, in fact, perform any duties if grace is lacking. For Christians, natural law flows not from divine commands, but from the fact that man is made in God's image, man is empowered by God's grace. Living the natural law is how man displays the gifts of life and grace, the gifts of all <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>good.</b> Consequences are in God's hands, consequences are generally not within man's control, thus in natural law, actions are judged by three things: (1) the person's intent, (2) the circumstances of the act and (3) the nature of the act. The apparent good or evil consequence resulting from the moral act is not relevant to the act itself. The specific content of the natural law is therefore determined by how each person's acts mirror God's internal life of love. Insofar as one lives the natural law, temporal satisfaction {{may or may not be}} attained, but salvation will be attained. The state, in being bound by the natural law, is conceived as an institution whose purpose is to assist in bringing its subjects to true happiness. True happiness derives from living in harmony with the mind of God as an image of the living God.|$|E

When you do not behave like you want to, then you have to apologise." [...] He had no regrets over his team {{selection}} and suggested {{it was part of the}} player's learning process. Wenger said of Walcott: [...] "…he had a very good performance and scored a great goal. <b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>good</b> for us and good news for England." [...] Gilberto Silva described Arsenal’s defeat as a “sad memory” and wanted to use the loss to motivate the team for their coming matches.|$|E
500|$|Upon Bradman's {{death in}} February 2001, Brown became the oldest living Australian Test cricketer, greatly {{amused by the}} fame {{that came with the}} title. Highly {{regarded}} by Australian cricketers of the modern era, Steve Waugh invited Brown to present Test debutant Adam Gilchrist with his baggy green. The humble Brown was surprised, thinking himself an unworthy choice. [...] Waugh disagreed, opining that [...] "Bill is a baggy green icon who represents all <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>good</b> about playing for your country. He is humble, self-effacing and respectful, proud to have been afforded the honour of being an Australian Test cricketer, and a man who always looks for the positive in people." [...] In March 2008, Brown died in Brisbane at the age of 95. He was the last surviving Invincible to have played Test cricket before World War II and his death leaves only four living members of Bradman's 1948 team.|$|E

500|$|Gry Barre is the {{daughter}} of the brantor of the neighboring domain of Roddmant, and Orrec's friend. Lindow describes her as representing [...] "all <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>good</b> in the Upland culture". Her gift is the ability to communicate with animals; while still a child she is able to hear the speech of animals in the farms, and later she trains Coaly, a guide dog for Orrec. She refuses to use her gift to call animals to be hunted, and is depicted as edgy and resolute. Despite being young, she is depicted as caring deeply for other beings, She visits Orrec in his despair, and persuades him to tell her stories, drawing him out of his grief through his gift for poetry. After she marries Orrec and the two decide to leave, she says [...] "We might go as far as the ocean shore", suggesting that though the Uplands have become too limiting for them, their development is not complete.|$|E
500|$|Reviewers {{praised the}} work as [...] "entertaining, {{thoughtful}} and eminently readable", although some thought it was too mournful in places. Separating Shelley's travel memoir from the new guidebooks and handbooks, reviews such as that from the Atlas, praised her [...] "rich fancy, her intense love of nature, and her sensitive apprehension of all <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>good,</b> and beautiful and free". They praised its independence of thought, wit, and feeling. Shelley's commentary on {{the social and political}} life of Italy, which was generally thought superior to the German sections, caused one reviewer to call the book the work of [...] "a woman who thinks for herself on all subjects, and who dares to say what she thinks", a woman with a [...] "masculine and original mind". Not all reviewers celebrated her independence of mind. The Observer wrote: [...] "With her, as with all women, politics is a matter of the heart, and not as with the more robust nature of man, of the head... It is an idle and unprofitable theme for a woman." [...] Most of the reviews responded positively to Shelley's political aims; those that were unsympathetic to her political position generally disputed her specific claims. For example, one reviewer claimed that Italy had been improved by Austrian rule.|$|E
500|$|The Less Deceived {{was first}} noticed by The Times, who {{included}} {{it in its}} List of Books of 1955. In its wake many other reviews followed; [...] "most of them concentrated ... on the book's emotional impact and its sophisticated, witty language." [...] The Spectator felt the collection was [...] "in the running for the best published in this country since the war"; G. S. Fraser, referring to Larkin's perceived association with The Movement felt that Larkin exemplified [...] "everything <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>good</b> in this 'new movement' and none of its faults". The TLS called him [...] "a poet of quite exceptional importance", and in June 1956 the Times Educational Supplement was fulsome: [...] "As native as a Whitstable oyster, as sharp an expression of contemporary thought and experience as anything written in our time, as immediate in its appeal as the lyric poetry of an earlier day, {{it may well be}} regarded by posterity as a poetic monument that marks the triumph over the formless mystifications of the last twenty years. With Larkin poetry is on its way back to the middlebrow public." [...] Reviewing the book in America the poet Robert Lowell wrote, [...] "No post-war poetry has so caught the moment, and caught it without straining after its ephemera. It's a hesitant, groping mumble, resolutely experienced, resolutely perfect in its artistic methods." ...|$|E

500|$|During pre-season, Wenger {{arranged}} {{a meeting with}} the players to examine why they lost the league. Martin Keown felt the manager harmed their chances by boasting they could go the season unbeaten. [...] "Look, I said that because I think you can do it. But you must really want it," [...] was Wenger's reply, as he believed the squad had the right mixture of technique, intelligence and physique. Arsenal did little transfer business given the financial demands that came with their new stadium project; their only major signing was Jens Lehmann, who replaced David Seaman as goalkeeper. Wenger retained his best players, despite interest shown by Chelsea's new owner Roman Abramovich. Six games into the league season, Arsenal were involved in a brawl against Manchester United; the ill-feeling stemmed from Vieira's dismissal late on. Several players were charged and fined accordingly by the FA and Wenger apologised for his team's overreaction. The team restored their image with an entertaining performance against Newcastle; Henry Winter in his match report wrote: [...] " [...] encapsulated all <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>good</b> about Arsenal, the slick passing and intelligent movement." [...] Wenger led his side to league triumph without a single defeat – an accomplishment last achieved by Preston North End 115 years before, in the Football League. [...] "Somebody threw me a T-shirt after the trophy was presented which read 'Comical Wenger says we can go the whole season unbeaten.' I was just a season too early!," [...] he remarked during the club's victory parade.|$|E
500|$|In the Zone {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from music critics. It holds {{a score of}} sixty-six out of hundred (indicating [...] "generally positive reviews") based on thirteen critical reviews, according to the music review aggregator Metacritic. Jason Shawhan of About.com gave a positive review, saying that while the album's vibe is sexy, {{the result is a}} personal statement from Spears. He also added, [...] "T's another thing about Spears' new record, as none of her previous albums ever managed to produce any kind of sustained emotional response than the pleasure that comes from a good pop record. I miss Max Martin, for sure, but it feels like Ms. S. has been paying attention to La Ciccone. To put it another way, this is Britney's True Blue." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic said that the album [...] " [...] all club-ready, but despite some hints of neo-electro and the Neptunes, it doesn't quite sound modern—it sounds like cuts from 1993 or Madonna's Bedtime Stories and Ray of Light. Production-wise, these tracks are not only accomplished but much more varied than any of her previous albums." [...] Ruth Mitchell of BBC Online called [...] "Early Mornin'" [...] the best track of the album, but added, [...] "Sadly, her attempts to prove her new-found maturity are what overwhelm and cloud all <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>good</b> about In The Zone." [...] Mim Udovitch of Blender commented, [...] "This I’m-coming-out record is an unhesitant move from songs of the heart to songs of the groin [...] No longer a girl, freed from slavery, now fully a woman, she makes a pretty convincing mistress." [...] David Browne of Entertainment Weekly called [...] "Brave New Girl" [...] and [...] "Touch of My Hand" [...] the best and most straightforward moments of the album, but added that [...] "On a CD intended to celebrate her lurch into adulthood, Spears remains distant and submerged. For all her freedom, she's still finding her way." ...|$|E
