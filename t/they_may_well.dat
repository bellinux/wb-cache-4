5|$|If {{the hostages}} were still {{held by the}} Scots a decade later, <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>well</b> have feared for their lives. For in 1275, the {{continuation}} of the twelfth-century Historia rerum Anglicarum, the thirteenthfourteenth-century Chronicle of Mann, and the fourteenth-century Chronicle of Lanercost reveal that Guðrøðr led a revolt on the island against the Scottish Crown. According to the continuation of Historia rerum Anglicarum, Guðrøðr took possession of the island's strongholds, ejecting the Scottish representatives in the process. Alexander III quickly responded by sending a great fleet, drawn from the Hebrides and Galloway, to invade the island and restore Scottish royal authority. The commanders of this enterprise were: John de Vesci (died 1289), John Comyn I, Lord of Badenoch (died c. 1277), Alan, Alasdair Mac Dubhghaill, Lord of Argyll (died 1310), and Ailéan mac Ruaidhrí (died ×1296). The identities of these men suggest that the Scottish force was composed of a small component of heavily armed knights, a contingent of infantry troops levied from the common army of Galloway, and a fleet of galleys gathered from the Hebrides.|$|E

25|$|The biographical {{material}} {{is to be}} found in chapters 26–29, 32, and 34–44, and focuses on the events leading up to and surrounding the fall of Jerusalem to the Babylonians in 587; it provides precise dates for the prophet's activities beginning in 609 BCE. The non-biographical prose passages, such as the Temple sermon in chapter 7 and the covenant passage in 11:1–17, are scattered throughout the book; they show clear affinities with the Deuteronomists, the school of writers and editors who shaped the series of history books from Judges to Kings, and while it is unlikely they come directly from Jeremiah, <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>well</b> have their roots in traditions about what he said and did.|$|E

25|$|At the time, the Schuylkill Valley was a {{hotly contested}} territory, with {{constant}} conflicts over titles, some dating to before the American Revolution and British colonial rule, and rights. Had {{any of their}} competitors became aware of what Tower and Munson were up to, <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>well</b> have bought up the land the pair were after, and charged exorbitant prices for it, or worse, refused to sell it at all. The partners operated secretly to protect their interests. Tower would make the purchases, and convey the titles to legal dummies to hide the ownership of the land. By 1858 Tower and Munson had acquired eleven thousand acres (45km2). By now, Munson and Tower's plan was well out of the bag, and anyone who had even a partial claim {{to any of the}} lands began to litigate. Only Tower's considerable skill as a lawyer kept the whole enterprise from falling apart.|$|E
25|$|As president, Zardari {{called for}} a United Nations {{investigation}} into his wife's assassination. In 2009, Secretary General Ban Ki-moon established a three-person team to lead the investigation comprising the Chilean Heraldo Muñoz, Irish Peter FitzGerald, and Indonesian Marzuki Darusman. Although {{it was not in}} the commission's remit to identify a culprit, Muñoz later expressed the view that the assassination was likely carried out by the Pakistani Taliban, perhaps with the support of Mehsud, and that <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>well</b> have been assisted by rogue elements in the country's intelligence agencies. He also expressed the view that the original police investigation had been deliberately botched. In February 2012, the Pakistani official enquiry issued its final report, placing responsibility for the attack with 27 different militant groups. In May 2013, the state's main prosecutor in the Bhutto case, Zulfikar Ali, was himself assassinated in Islamabad. There was never a smoking gun in the Bhutto investigation.|$|E

500|$|The archaeologists Stuart and Cecily Piggott {{believed}} that the circles of Dorset were probably of Bronze Age origin, a view endorsed by Burl, who noted that their distribution did not match that of any known Neolithic sites.

500|$|According {{to another}} {{view on the}} family's origins, which is championed by historians Camil Mureşanu and Ion-Aurel Pop, Voyk did not migrate from Wallachia, but {{was born in a}} family of Romanian noble knezes from the region of Hátszeg, or Hunyad. They say that Voyk's {{grandfather}} could have been a man named [...] "Costea", mentioned in a royal charter from 1360, and who fathered a son named Serbe (the name of Voyk's father). According to the charter, Costea and Serbe together established two villages in the region of Hátszeg. Historian Dezső Dümmerth offers a third view of the Hunyadis' ancestry. He said that Voyk was of Romanianized Cuman stock, one of the Wallachian boyars. He attributes Cuman and Tatar ancestry to the Wallachian boyars. Another historian, Miklós Molnár, accepts the Wallachian origin of the family, but also represents a fourth perspective on the origins of the family. He said that <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>well</b> have been of Slavic descent. Neither Paul Lendvai nor András Boros-Kazai excluded the possibility of the Hunyadis being of Slavic origin.|$|E

500|$|The Rice Owls and Texas met in 2005for the 88thtime. Texas held a 65–21–1lead in the series, {{which began}} in 1914. For the Longhorns this series ranks fourth in number of games played, behind Texas A, Oklahoma, and Baylor. The two schools were once conference foes in the Southwest Conference and have {{maintained}} a rivalry {{despite the fact that}} Texas enjoys a sizable lead in the series. President John F. Kennedy alluded to the lopsidedness of the rivalry in his 1962 speech on America's space program: [...] "But why, some say, the moon? ... And <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>well</b> ask why climb the highest mountain. Why, 35 years ago, fly the Atlantic? Why does Rice play Texas?... We choose to go to the moon... and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard." [...] In addition to continuing a traditional rivalry, playing Rice in a home and away series allows for Texas to play games in Houston, Texas, an important recruiting base for UT, which has a significant Texas Exes alumni population.|$|E
500|$|Fielding's rival, Samuel Richardson, {{declared}} in February 1752 {{that the novel}} [...] "is as dead {{as if it had}} been published forty years ago, as to sale." [...] Previously, he attacked the [...] "lowness" [...] of the novel and claimed that [...] "his brawls, his jarrs, his gaols, his spunging-houses, are all drawn from what he has seen and known." [...] However, Richardson also claimed to have never read Amelia but, years later, Sir Walter Scott argued that Amelia was [...] "a continuation of Tom Jones." [...] The second edition of Amelia was criticized for its various changes to the text. Some aspects of the revision, such as removing of Fielding's Universal Register Office, were seen as [...] "damaging" [...] the work, although they were intended to remove anachronisms. In The Bible in Spain (1843) George Borrow, describing his first visit to Lisbon, wrote: [...] "Let travellers devote one entire morning to inspecting the Arcos and the Mai das Agoas, after which they may repair to the English church and cemetery, Pere-la-chaise in miniature, where, if they be of England, <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>well</b> be excused if they kiss the cold tomb, as I did, of the author of Amelia, the most singular genius which their island ever produced, whose works it has long been the fashion to abuse in public and to read in secret." ...|$|E
