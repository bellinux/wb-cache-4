While {{progressively}} diminishing our {{reliance on}} fossil fuels, {{it is of}} paramount importance to keep advancing low-carbon economic growth. A crucial role can be played by clean and efficient flash carbonization of biomass into biocarbon. This thesis reviews several elevated-pressure flash carbonization experiments, pyrolyzing varying biomass feed stocks and using different types of reactors. Renewed Lab-scale sewage sludge carbonization experiments were intended to remedy shortcomings with respect to the experimental reproducibility and inaccurate analyses of heavy metal concentrations that have come to light in our previous work on sewage sludge carbonization. In support of the Norwegian ferrosilicon industry, local birch, spruce and GROT were carbonized in the lab-scale reactor, with a view to analyzing the impact of pressure, soft versus hard wood and FC canister insulation on their respective fixed carbon yields. Demo-scale reactor macadamia nutshell carbonization experiments (creating charcoal with fixed carbon contents of 97 %) taught us how to avoid fumes from being emitted and to better monitor the self-designed <b>thermal</b> <b>afterburner.</b> Avicel cellulose carbonization experiments conducted under varying elevated pressures in the upgraded Wall-Heated Tubing Bomb Reactor produced, while showing evidence of a molten phase, high-quality solid pieces of charcoal. They enabled us to achieve 98 % of the theoretical fC yield of cellulose...|$|E

40|$|This type of {{incinerator}} is {{also referred}} to as a direct flame incinerator, <b>thermal</b> oxidizer, or <b>afterburner.</b> However, the term afterburner is generally appropriate only to describe a thermal oxidizer used to control gases coming from a process where combustion is incomplete. 2. Type of Technology: Destruction by thermal oxidation 3. Applicable Pollutants: Primarily volatile organic compounds (VOC). Some particulate matter (PM), commonly composed as soot (particles formed as a result of incomplete combustion of hydrocarbons (HC), coke, or carbon residue) will also be destroyed in various degrees. 4. Achievable Emission Limits/Reductions: VOC destruction efficiency depends upon design criteria (i. e., chamber temperature, residence time, inlet VOC concentration, compound type, and degree of mixing) (EPA, 1992). Typical thermal incinerator design efficiencies range from 98 to 99. 99 % and above, depending on system requirements and characteristics of the contaminated stream (EPA, 1992; EPA, 1996 a). The typical design conditions needed to meet 98 % control or a 20 parts per million by volume (ppmv) compound exit concentration are: 870 (C (1600 (F) combustion temperature, 0. 7...|$|R
40|$|Rising {{awareness}} {{in the need}} for environmental protection has brought into question the adequacy of conventional hazardous waste treatment operations. Regulatory standards are increasingly strict, and there is growing concern over the safety of incineration facilities. This research project examines the technoeconomic potential of thermal plasma technology in this context. Adaptive Plasma-Assisted Incineration (APAI) is a novel concept for secondary gas treatment in hazardous waste incineration. As an energy source for waste destruction, a thermal plasma can provide conditions far higher in temperature and in reactivity than those obtained using a combustion flame. Thus, the plasma is more effective at destroying hazardous materials, albeit at a higher cost. APAI features a <b>thermal</b> plasma <b>afterburner</b> with continual on-line optical monitoring of the gas product and feedback optimization of the plasma conditions. This approach allows complete destruction of persistent organic compounds and cost-effective response to feed load variations. The process supplements conventional incineration techniques with the effectiveness and flexibility of thermal plasma treatment. The main objectives are {{to reduce the risk}} of harmful emissions during hazardous waste incineration and to facilitate compliance with new environmental regulations. In this project, the technical feasibility of APAI was demonstrated experimentally using a laboratory-scale plasma afterburner model. The work focused on the development of a spectroscopic monitoring procedure and on the application of optimization techniques for cost-effective operation of the model system. The techno-economic potential and limitations of APAI were addressed in a conceptual study. Preliminary designs and cost estimates were developed for specific applications. The costs of plasma-assisted and conventional methods were compared for contaminated soil remediation (by incineration and desorption) and for organic liquid waste destruction. Economically, APAI appears uncompetitive at the present time. However, it remains a promising alternative in view of ongoing environmental policy changes and developments in plasma technology...|$|R
40|$|This {{technical}} paper addresses the challenges for maximizing {{the benefit of}} thermal barrier coatings for turbine engine applications. The perspective is from a customer's viewpoint, a turbine airfoil designer, who is continuously challenged to increase the turbine inlet temperature capability for new products while maintaining cooling flow levels or even reducing them. This is a fundamental requirement to achieve increased engine thrust levels. Developing advanced material systems for the turbine flowpath airfoils is one approach to solve this challenge, for example, high temperature nickel based superalloys or thermal barrier coatings to insulate the metal airfoil from the hot flowpath environment. The second approach {{is to increase the}} cooling performance of the turbine airfoil, which enables increased flowpath temperatures and reduced cooling flow levels. Thermal barrier coatings have been employed in jet engine applications for almost 30 years. The initial application was on augmenter lines to provide <b>thermal</b> protection during <b>afterburner</b> operation. However, the production use of thermal barrier coating in the turbine section has only occurred in the past 15 years. The application was limited to stationary parts, and only recently incorporated on the rotating turbine blades. This lack of endorsement of thermal barrier coatings resulted from the poor initial durability of these coatings in high heat flux environments. Significant improvements have been made to enhance spallation resistance and erosion resistance which has resulted in increased reliability of these coatings in turbine applications...|$|R
