5|$|The convict cichlid {{displays}} significant color {{across its}} range. Some of these regional variants are now considered different species. In the cichlid-keeping hobby, Rusty Wessel collected one such fish, the Honduran Red Point Cichlid (Amatitlania sp.) from a stream in Honduras. The Honduran Red Point Convict ranges from Atlantic Honduras south <b>to</b> <b>Costa</b> <b>Rica.</b> Other new species formerly included in A. nigrofasciata are Amatitlania coatepeque, from Lake Coatepeque in El Salvador, and Amatitlania kanna, from Panama's Atlantic coast.|$|E

5|$|The {{territory}} now {{incorporated into}} El Salvador was not politically unified {{at the time}} of Spanish contact. As with neighbouring regions, this hindered the progress of incorporation into the Spanish Empire, as each small kingdom had to be overcome in turn; this contrasted with Mexico where a large empire had been rapidly overcome with the fall of its capital, Tenochtitlan. As Spanish authority gradually spread out from Mexico and Panama, this left El Salvador in an intermediate region temporarily beyond Spanish control. Spanish colonial towns were founded according to the whim of individual conquistadors, with no formal planning of their location or of communication routes between them, often leaving them isolated. In 1548, El Salvador was formally placed within the jurisdiction of the Audiencia Real of Guatemala, which extended along the Central American isthmus from Chiapas, now in southern Mexico, <b>to</b> <b>Costa</b> <b>Rica.</b>|$|E
5|$|Tourism <b>to</b> <b>Costa</b> <b>Rica</b> {{was down}} sharply {{during the first}} half of June 2013.

Aurora Gámez, who owns an Manzanillo Beach hotel, said her occupancy rate normally runs at 50% in June, but was at just 10% in the weeks after Mora's death. She said she had received cancellations that specifically cited Mora's death as a factor. Cahuita hotel owner Eddie Ryan echoed Gámez, saying he had two patrons cite Mora's death when cancelling. Restaurants, bars, tour guides, and transportation companies were also affected. Some entrepreneurs blamed WIDECAST for the lost business saying the organization was aware of the risks but continued to patrol anyway.|$|E

5|$|Edward Alphonso Goldman revised North American Oryzomys in 1918 and {{consolidated}} {{many forms}} {{into a single}} species Oryzomys couesi, with ten subspecies distributed from southern Texas and western Mexico south <b>to</b> <b>Costa</b> <b>Rica.</b> He placed it in an Oryzomys palustris group with the marsh rice rat and several species with more limited distributions, which he regarded as related to O.couesi but distinctive enough to be classified as separate species. In the 1930s, a few more forms related to O.couesi were described. As then recognized, the ranges of the marsh rice rat, a United States species, and Oryzomys couesi meet in southern Texas. In 1960, Raymond Hall reviewed specimens from this contact zone and found no grounds on which to separate the two species; thus, he reduced O.couesi to a subspecies of the marsh rice rat. Other workers continued this lumping and by 1971 all other species Goldman had placed in the O.palustris group were classified under the marsh rice rat, together with Oryzomys azuerensis from Panama, described as a species in 1937.|$|E

5|$|She met Pedro Joaquín Chamorro Cardenal in 1949, {{they married}} in December 1950; subsequently, they had five {{children}} together. In 1952, on his father's death, Chamorro's husband inherited the newspaper La Prensa. He took over publishing and under his direction, the paper became a voice of opposition to the Somoza regime. Chamorro Cardenal was frequently jailed between 1952 and 1957 for {{the content of the}} paper and in 1957 led a revolt against Somoza. His actions resulted in his exile <b>to</b> <b>Costa</b> <b>Rica,</b> where Chamorro joined him after settling their children with his mother. Two years were spent in Costa Rica, with Pedro writing against the regime and immediately upon their return he was jailed again. Chamorro's life throughout the 1960s and 1970s was a repetitive cycle of reunions with either her husband or children. She followed him; if he was forced to leave, she left the children with family and traveled to be with him; if he was jailed, she was reunited with the children and visited him. Chamorro's earnings from a rental property that her mother had given her gave the couple a steady income. When her husband was assassinated on 10 January 1978, she took over control of the newspaper.|$|E
