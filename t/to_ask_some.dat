5|$|In {{the final}} chapter of the game, Conker and Berri are enlisted by Don Weaso, head of the Weasel Mafia, to rob a bank. After {{entering}} the vault, they find that the bank scene was an elaborate trap set by the King and Don Weaso to capture Conker. In the ensuing confrontation, Berri steps in to handle the confrontation for Conker, but is gunned down by Weaso under orders by the Panther King. Afterwards, he calls over Professor Von Kriplespac when he begins having trouble breathing, and Von Kriplespac takes Conker aside to watch as a large Xenomorph suddenly bursts out of the Panther King's chest, killing him instantly. Von Kriplespac explains that the alien, whom he had named Heinrich, {{is one of his}} creations and that he had planned to use this opportunity to kill the King and escape captivity. Kriplespac then reveals that they are all actually inside a spaceship, which he activates and takes into low orbit. From there, he instructs Heinrich to attack and kill Conker as revenge for destroying the Tediz, which were also his creations. Conker pulls a switch that opens an air lock, pulling Von Kriplespac and the corpses of Berri and the Panther King into space. After Conker briefly battles Heinrich {{with the aid of a}} robotic suit, Heinrich takes one last lunge at him, when suddenly the entire game freezes. Conker expresses disbelief that the developers of the game apparently did not beta test the game properly, and breaks the fourth wall <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>some</b> software engineers to assist him in his current situation. The programmers give Conker a Katana and teleport him to the Panther King's throne room, where he decapitates Heinrich. As a result, he is crowned the new King of the land.|$|E
500|$|Gyllenhaal is {{politically}} active. At the 18th Independent Spirit Awards, she {{spoke out against}} the Iraq war, stating {{the reason for the}} invasion was [...] "oil and imperialism". In 2005, Gyllenhaal drew controversy for her statement that the September 11 attacks were [...] "an occasion to be brave enough <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>some</b> serious questions about America's role in the world ... It is always useful as individuals or nations to ask how we may have knowingly or unknowingly contributed to this conflict." [...] Gyllenhaal took part in Artists United to Win Without War, a campaign started by Robert Greenwald that aimed to advance progressive causes and voicing opposition to the Iraq War. She and her brother Jake filmed a commercial for Rock the Vote, and visited the University of Southern California (USC) campus to encourage students to vote in the 2004 U.S. presidential election, in which she supported John Kerry. Gyllenhaal supported Barack Obama in the 2008 presidential election. She has campaigned on behalf of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), an organization her family strongly supports.|$|E
2500|$|In late January 2008, after {{finishing}} 2nd in the January 19 South Carolina primary, the Huckabee campaign faced significant financial setbacks, {{due to a}} decrease in cash flow expectations after not meeting the expectation of winning {{the first in the}} south primary. [...] This caused Huckabee <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>some</b> senior staff members to work without pay, and put uncertainty on the future of his campaign and how long Huckabee would be able to compete financially.|$|E

2500|$|..... One {{morning as}} I was making my thanksgiving after Communion, {{a very strong}} {{distraction}} took hold of me. I thought I saw a great plain full of people enveloped in thick fog. They were walking about like people who had lost their way {{and did not know}} which way to turn. Someone near me said: 'This is England'. I was just going <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>some</b> questions, when I saw Pope Pius IX just like I have seen him in pictures. He was robed magnificently and carried in his hand a torch alive with flames. As he walked slowly towards that immense gathering of people, the leaping flames from the torch dispelled the fog, and the people stood in the splendour of the noonday sun. 'That torch', said the one beside me, 'is the Catholic Faith, which is going to light up England'".|$|E
2500|$|The UK {{government}} {{established a}} task force to look at ways of stemming the growth of Islamic extremism in Britain, focusing on the radicalisation of worshippers in mosques, university students and prisoners. The task force – chaired by David Cameron – had its inaugural meeting at 10 Downing Street on 3 June 2013, and includes Cabinet Ministers, and representatives from the police and intelligence services. Later that day Cameron made a House of Commons statement on the Woolwich attack, saying that lessons must be learned. [...] "When young men born and bred in this country are radicalised and turned into killers, we have <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>some</b> tough questions about what is happening in our country. It is as if that for some young people there is a conveyor belt to radicalisation that has poisoned their minds with sick and perverted ideas. We need to dismantle this process at every stage – in schools, colleges, universities, on the internet, in our prisons, wherever it is taking place." ...|$|E
2500|$|As the {{situation}} became clear, Alliance gradually slowed, allowing {{the rest of}} Jones’s squadron to catch up (except for the little schooner carrying the boarding party, which could not sail fast enough). About 6pm, Commodore Jones ordered Pallas to ride directly in his wake, to confuse the opposition about the squadron’s strength, and {{half an hour later}} he hoisted signals ordering all vessels to form a single-file line of battle, to make best use of their broadsides as they passed the two British ships. Captain Landais, who unlike Jones {{had a great deal of}} formal training in naval leadership and tactics (and was aware of the latest French battle plans, used with considerable success against the Royal Navy at this time), decided to try a different plan. He used Alliance’s superior handling to sail off to one side, against the wind. In order to prevent him from sailing right past and chasing the convoy, Captain Thomas Piercy of the Countess of Scarborough had to do the same, leaving Serapis alone against the remaining three American ships. Finally, a little after 7pm, Bonhomme Richard was within pistol-shot of the battle-ready Serapis. In the gathering dark, Pearson then hailed the potentially hostile ship <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>some</b> pertinent questions: its name, its nationality etc. The answer was a few evasive remarks, followed by a shot (as he recalled it, but possibly a broadside) which Serapis answered with a broadside. A minute or two later, as soon as he was within range, Landais fired his own broadside at the Countess of Scarborough (theoretically just over [...] of shot from 18 guns). Piercy soon replied (his maximum broadside being about 60lb from 10 guns).|$|E
