40|$|Background Optimal {{selective}} photothermolysis of a pigment particle requires pulse durations {{equal to or}} less than the particle's thermal relaxation time (t½). Since tattoo particles in skin range in diameter from 40 to 300 [*]nm, picosecond pulses would approximate t½ more closely and, therefore, might be more effective at tattoo particle fragmentation. Materials and Methods India Ink (carbon) or iron oxide tattoos {{were placed on the}} back of a Yorkshire pig. Six weeks later, each tattoo was treated with either a 758 [*]nm 500 [*]picosecond laser (Cynosure), a 755 [*]nm 30 – 50 [*]nanoseconds laser, or left untreated. After 4 weeks, clinical responses were evaluated by three dermatologists based on pre- and post-treatment photographs; histopathologic findings were evaluated by a dermatopathologist; and electron microscopic findings were analyzed for treated and non-treated carbon tattoos. Results After a single treatment, picosecond-domain pulses at 758 [*]nm produced a significantly greater degree of carbon tattoo clearance compared to nanosecond-domain pulses at 755 [*]nm. For iron oxide tattoos, both modalities produced minimal-to-poor clearance that was generally comparable. Neither modality resulted in scarring, textural changes, or hypopigmentation, and there was no histopathologic evidence of scarring. Electron micrographs revealed the presence of amorphous material (<b>treated</b> <b>pigment)</b> in picosecond and nanosecond laser-treated tattoos, consistent with effective targeting of India Ink pigment. Conclusions The 758 [*]nm 500 [*]picosecond laser is more effective at carbon tattoo clearance after one session in a porcine model than the 30 – 50 [*]nanosecond laser emitting at a similar wavelength. Both lasers cleared carbon tattoos more effectively than iron oxide tattoos. Both lasers have a comparable safety profile, and neither produced clinical or histopathologic scarring. Further studies in humans are necessary to evaluate whether repeated treatments with picosecond versus nanosecond domain modalities might yield superior tattoo pigment clearance with a comparable safety profile.

Each subject has undergone up to 6 treatments with approximately 1 month interval between each treatment. Each visit involves single pass of Starlux-V handpiece treatment. The wavelength of this handpiece is 400 – 700 nm and 870 – 1200 nm. Spot size 16 _ 46 mm with maximum fluence 25 J/cm 2. Subjects were evaluated at baseline and 1 month after each treatment by means of standardized photos using the Canfield Visia CR System 1 and patient questionnaires. Any adverse effects were noted. RESULTS: Fine line/wrinkles and pore size had no improvement after treatments. However, there were mild to marked improvement in pigmented lesions. One subject developed post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation. That is 3 out of 103 treatment sessions- 2. 9 %. Overall patient satisfaction was good. Some reported mild to moderate levels of pain during treatment. There was also subjective improvement in wrinkles and pore size.

40|$|We {{describe}} a new method for selective cell targeting {{based on the}} use of light-absorbing microparticles and nanoparticles that are heated by short laser pulses to create highly localized cell damage. The method is closely related to chromophore-assisted laser inactivation and photodynamic therapy, but is driven solely by light absorption, without the need for photochemical intermediates (particularly singlet oxygen). The mechanism of light-particle interaction was investigated by nanosecond time-resolved microscopy and by thermal modeling. The extent of light-induced damage was investigated by cell lethality, by cell membrane permeability, and by protein inactivation. Strong particle size dependence was found for these interactions. A technique based on light to target endogenous particles is already being exploited to <b>treat</b> <b>pigmented</b> cells in dermatology and ophthalmology. With exogenous particles, phamacokinetics and biodistribution studies are needed before the method can be evaluated against photodynamic therapy for cancer treatment. However, particles are unique, unlike photosensitizers, in that they can remain stable and inert in cells for extended periods. Thus they may be particularly useful for prelabeling cells in engineered tissue before implantation. Subsequent irradiation with laser pulses will allow control of the implanted cells (inactivation or modulation) in a noninvasive manner. ...|$|R

However, {{the effect of}} topical methimazole on thyroid function has not been reported. This study was aimed at assessing the safety of topical methimazole used to <b>treat</b> <b>pigmented</b> lesions, without affecting thyroid hormones due to systemic delivery. The pharmacokinetics of methimazole, either applied {{in the form of}} a 5 % topical formulation to facial skin or taken orally {{in the form of a}} 5 -mg tablet by 6 volunteers, were determined. In addition, the effect of long-term topical applications of 5 % methimazole on the function of the thyroid gland in 20 patients with epidermal melasma was determined following 6 weeks of once-daily application. Cutaneous adverse effects of topical methimazole were determined. From 15 min up to 24 h after application, methimazole was undetectable in the serum of the individuals receiving single topical methimazole dosing. Methimazole, however, was detected in serum after 15 min of oral administration and remained detectable in serum up to 24 h after administration. Long-term topical methimazole applications in melasma patients did not induce any significant changes in serum TSH, free thyroxine and free triiodothyronine levels. Topical methimazole was well tolerated by the patients and did not induce any significant cutaneous side effects. Present data together with the previously shown non-cytotoxic and non-mutagenic characteristics of methimazole indicate that this agent could be considered as a safe skin-depigmenting compound for topical treatment of skin hyperpigmentary disorders in humans...|$|R

40|$|Micrometer-sized {{aluminium}} flakes {{for use as}} pigments in waterborne coatings need protection, {{since the}} reaction between aluminium and water causes formation of aluminium hydroxide and hydrogen gas. The aluminium hydroxide destroys the metallic appearance of the pigment flakes {{and the evolution of}} hydrogen gas leads to a dangerous pressure build-up in the paint containers. The protection of the aluminium pigment particles is referred to as inhibition and three different inhibition techniques have been developed and evaluated in this thesis. In the first method, aluminium pigment flakes were dispersed in aqueous surfactant solutions and studied over time. Phosphate esters like sodium dodecyl phosphate (SDP) were shown to be efficient inhibiting agents for aluminium pigments, and storage stabilities of several weeks were obtained. Aluminium <b>pigments</b> <b>treated</b> with the structurally similar sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS), as well as <b>pigments</b> <b>treated</b> with non-ionic surfactants reacted within one day. The difference in inhibition capacity between the two anionic surfactants was explained by a greater amount of adsorbed SDP compared to SDS at a model surface of aluminium oxide, but also by greater adsorption strength. This was seen by quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring and atomic force microscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and reflectometry analyses, respectively. In the second method, the inhibition obtained with phosphate ester surfactants was further refined by formation of a polymer layer inside the adsorbed surfactant layer, a technique called admicellar polymerisation. Poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) was evaluated as polymer for this application, and it was shown using thermogravimetric analysis and XPS that a substantial amount of polymer was formed around the aluminium pigment. Furthermore, the PMMA-encapsulated aluminium pigment flakes were stable for several weeks in aqueous solution, even when SDS was used as surfactant. The third inhibition technique studied protected the aluminium pigment flakes by means of an inorganic silica layer, which was deposited on the aluminium pigment surface by condensation of hydrolysed tetraethylorthosilicate. The silica-encapsulated pigment flakes could be stored in water for several weeks. Hence, all three inhibition techniques have been proven useful for protection of aluminium pigments in waterborne coatings...|$|R

Permanent and relatively thick polymer layers with an effective stabilization effect are prepared by the Forschungsinstitut fuer Pigmente und Lacke e. V. (Stuttgart, Federal Republic of Germany). In this research project, the author uses LCST polymers (lower critical solution temperature) in order to <b>treat</b> with <b>pigment</b> surfaces. The following pigments are used: DBP- 732 (polydimethylsiloxane-graft-(PPO-PEO) -copolymer), Luviskol (poly(N-vinyl-caprolactam)), Pluronic PE 4300 (PEO-PPO-PEO copolymer (EO) _ 7 (PO) _ 20 (EO) _ 7), Synperonic PE/L 61 (PEO-PPO-PEO copolymer (EO) _ 4 (PO) _ 28 (EO) _ 4), PEO-PPO-PEO with the composition (EO) _ 7 (PO) _ 62 (EO) _ 7 and PPO diacrylate. By variation of the chemical constitution, molar mass and the LCST value, the pigments Heliogen Blau L 6989 F from BASF AG (Ludwigshafen, Federal Republic of Germany), titanium dioxide Kronos 2310 from Kronos International Inc. (Leverkusen, Federal Republic of Germany) and flat SiO_ 2 substrates are treated with LCST polymers and analyzed with respect to adsorptive layer and regeneration of the polymer layer. The thickness of the polymer layer on the pigment surface on the pigment surface can be controlled by the segregation effect. The coating of particles is based on heating of the pigment dispersion with the polymeric solution above the pigment surface. The hydrophobe / hydrophile properties of the coated particle can be varied by a suitable selection of polymers. By cross-linking reactions, LCST polymer layers on the pigment surface can be immobilized permanently.

40|$|Background: Evaluation and {{treatment}} of pigmented skin lesions {{is one of the}} most common reasons for dermatologic consultation. The vast majority of these are completely benign in nature without any risk of malignant transformation. However, these pigmented lesions occasionally exhibit more concerning features of dysplasia, ranked from mild to severe in degree. The most concerning pigmented lesion of course is malignant melanoma, whose early detection and efficient treatment is of the utmost importance. Along the same vein, numerous techniques exist for removing these skin findings, both for diagnosis as well as for definitive therapy. One can shave the lesion using a scalpel or specialized curved razor to remove the epidermal portion with little or no dermal involvement. One can also use a punch biopsy of variable size to either sample a specific area, or to remove the entire lesion in question. A standard excision can also be employed, whereby with the use of a scalpel, the entire epidermis down to the deep dermis (or even deeper in cases) is removed including and surrounding the identified lesion. This is the most definitive form of removal; however, patients must return for suture-removal, are at an increased (albeit small) risk of infection, and are left with a larger scar as compared to the punch biopsy or “shave. ” Excisions are also the most costly methods of removal. The final technique, which is not widely used among dermatologists, is called the “scoop-shave. ” This technique involves using a curved blade to more deeply shave a lesion down into the deep dermis. Because the area treated by this method is relatively small, no sutures are placed. This saves the patient a return-visit to the clinic and may be more cost- and time-efficient than some alternative methods. The “scoop-shave” has some controversy surrounding its use, particularly pertaining to safety. It is the overall accepted standard of care for a practitioner to perform a punch biopsy or excision of suspected dysplastic nevi or melanomas. The reasoning is that, particularly with melanomas, the depth of the lesion of the most important piece of information to obtain, in assessing dysplasia or malignancy, as well as for staging a melanoma. Standard shave biopsies do not adequately assess this depth, and many feel that the “scoop-shave” shares a similar disadvantage. Objectives: This study sought to assess the diagnostic and therapeutic utility of the “scoop-shave” in <b>treating</b> <b>pigmented</b> skin lesions. More specifically, we wanted to see if this method was indeed safe to perform, and if any melanomas were identified during the study, whether or not the full depth of these tumors was identified using this technique. Methods: In this open, prospective Institutional Review Board-approved study, all suspected pigmented lesions to be treated at the Division of Dermatology were included. The treating practitioner filled out a survey at the time of the procedure which included the suspected clinical diagnosis (nevus, dysplastic nevus, seborrheic keratosis, melanoma or other) and the practitioner’s intent (biopsy, excision or re-excision). Also, the practitioner was given the choice of what technique to use (excision, scoop-shave, shave, punch biopsy or punch excision). The size and location of the lesion were documented on the chart as was any pertinent information regarding the patient’s personal or family history of skin cancer. The surveys were then collected and the pathology results of each specimen were followed and documented. Particular attention was paid to the status of tumor/lesion margins as well as any comments from the pathologist regarding sufficient or insufficient depth of the specimen in question. The pathology department had no knowledge of this study and no markings were made that could identify these as study specimens. Any subsequent action taken by the practitioner (observation, excision or re-excision) was also noted and recorded. In this study a total of 203 pigmented lesions were collected over a five-month period. Results: Of the 203 lesions treated, 57 (28...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND—Subthreshold (retinal pigment epithelium) {{photocoagulation}} {{is a new}} photocoagulation method, which <b>treats</b> the retinal <b>pigment</b> epithelium (RPE) and avoids {{damage to}} the neural retina. The initial results in this prospective pilot study on various macular diseases are presented.  METHODS— 12 patients with diabetic maculopathy (group I), 10  with soft drusen (group II), and four with central serous retinopathy (CSR) (group III) were treated and followed up for 1  year. Treatment was achieved using a train of repetitive short laser pulses (1. 7  µs) of a green Nd:YLF laser (parameters: 527  nm, 100  and 500  pulses, repetition rate: 500  Hz, spot size: 160  µm, energies: 70 - 100 µJ). Laser energy {{was based on the}} visibility of test lesions on fluorescein angiography (50 - 130 µJ). Patients were examined at various times by ophthalmoscopy, fluorescein and ICG angiography, and infrared imaging.  RESULTS—After 6  months hard exudates disappeared in six out of nine patients in group I and leakage disappeared in six out of 12  diabetic patients. In group II drusen were less in seven out of 10  patients. In group III serous detachment disappeared in three out of four cases. Visual acuity was stable in all cases. None of the laser lesions was clinically visible immediately. After 1  day most lesions were visible as yellowish RPE depigmentation. After 3  months some of the lesions were visible as hyperpigmented areas but most were not. Fluorescein angiography showed leakage only in the first week. Infrared imaging showed that most lesions can be visualised in groups I and II after a period longer than 1  week as hyperreflective areas.  CONCLUSION—This study showed that subthreshold (RPE) photocoagulation is effective in some cases of diabetic maculopathy, drusens, and in CSR. Visibility of laser burns is not always necessary in the treatment of macular diseases presented here. Infrared imaging is an effective and non-invasive way of visualising subthreshold (RPE) laser burns. ...|$|R

Methods: TAA-loaded deoxycholic acid-modified chitosan (TAA/DA-Chit) nanoparticles were prepared via a self-assembly mechanism, and their morphology and zeta potential were examined by transmission electron microscopy and zeta potential analysis, respectively. DA-Chit and TAA/DA-Chit nanoparticle toxicity was evaluated using a Cell Counting Kit- 8 assay. The efficiency of cellular uptake was determined using fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled DA-Chit nanoparticles, in place of TAA/DA-Chit nanoparticles, assessed by both inverted fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry.

Results: TAA/DA-Chit nanoparticles were prepared with a TAA-loading capacity in the range of 12 %&ndash; 82 %, which increased the water solubility of TAA from 0. 3 mg/mL to 2. 1 mg/mL. These nanoparticles showed oblate shapes 100 &ndash; 550 nm in size in transmission electron microscopic images and had positive zeta potentials. The Cell Counting Kit- 8 assay indicated that the DA-Chit and TAA/DA-Chit nanoparticles had no toxicity and low toxicity, respectively, to human retinal pigment epithelial cells.

30|$|Aesthetic {{sensibility}} for interior {{furniture was}} {{of great importance}} from the 15 th century onwards and structural elements such as walls and ceilings were also decorated in order to embellish the interior of buildings. Wooden ceilings represented an important and widespread art form in Italy [1]. Skilled craftsmen operating in several notable “ateliers”, mainly located in northern Italy, decorated ceiling panels with subjects inspired by the artworks of famous painters, for instance Andrea Mantegna, Vincenzo Foppa or Giovan Pietro da Cemmo. Painted wooden panels were mainly produced to enhance the ceilings of aristocratic homes and churches [2]. Today these panels represent {{an important source of}} information about 15 th and 16 th century customs and traditions as the subjects of the decorations were typical of the Renaissance [3]. At that time, the wooden ceilings had a typical structure with central beams and lateral rafters with the presence of a console along the vertical faces. The surfaces of the beams were painted and decorated and small wooden panels were hung between the beams and the console [4]. These artworks were given a ground layer which provided the base for painting. Although a lot of these paintings have been lost over the centuries, some of them can still be found in Italian museums or in the original buildings, as for example the painted ceiling panels depicting knights which adorn the ground floor of a building in Vittorio Veneto (Treviso) dating back to 1476, or the palace of Giovanni degli Onesti in Udine [5]. This artistic technique was commonly used in Lombardy and examples of these panels can be seen all over the region. The panels are usually square shaped and depict various subjects such as bust-length portraits of noblewomen or gentlemen, historical, mythological or allegoric episodes, as well as portraits of kings or emperors. Mantova, Brescia, Cremona and Pavia were the most important towns in Lombardy for the development of these decorations [6]. From a technical point of view, Spruce was the main source of wood for the panels due to its ease of workability and soft color. At that time, light-colored wood was commonly <b>treated</b> with <b>pigments,</b> organic dyes, gums, natural resins or oil varnishes in order to give a transparent rosy color to the wood surfaces, conferring to wood a pleasant effect [7]. Moreover, some of the most commonly used pigments for these kinds of paintings were azurite for bleu colors and cinnabar for red, as confirmed by historical sources [8]. The ceiling panels analyzed in this study are {{part of a group of}} panels that probably come from a stately home in Cremona which no longer exists and belong to the “Musei Civici” in Cremona. The paintings are portraits of fashionable dames, with rich jewels and fancy headdresses, who were probably the aristocratic owners of the palace. The panels seem to be quite well preserved and no restoration has been documented in the past. Nothing is known about the binders, primer layers and pigments and it is unclear if paintings were made by the same or different workshops and/or artists of the town. A scientific evaluation performed by means of various diagnostic methods is required in order to assess the level of degradation of the painted panels and their materials. Moreover, the analyses of the paintings’ components may provide useful information about the painting techniques [9]. The analyses performed on micro-samples taken from characteristic points of different pattern colors enabled us to study the stratigraphy of the ground layer and paint layers. The samples were studied with an optical microscope, μFT-IR micro-spectroscopy and Scanning Electron Microscopy with EDX spectrometer (SEM-EDX). The characterization of these materials represents a first step in determining the artistic techniques used to make these particular kinds of artworks during the Italian Renaissance period.|$|R
40|$|In {{the various}} {{experiments}} outlined above, {{attempts have been}} made to elucidate some of the important factors influencing the normal bile excretion in Merino sheep. This work was undertaken primarily with the view of explaining the severe generalised icterus seen in the disease geeldikkop caused by excessive ingestion of wilted Tribulus plants. In this disease the icterus is of an exceptionally intense paralytic nature in which the liver appears to lose all power of bile excretion, with the result that the bile is regurgitated into the blood and lymph stream. Except for the bile pigmentation there is, however, little morphological change of the liver parenchyme to indicate the type of damage caused. The effect, therefore, seems to consist very largely of a functional derangement of the liver. In previous articles of this series, it was pointed out that administration of the plant Lippia although in no way related to Tribulus, provoked a closely similar or identical symptom complex in experimental sheep. Moreover the symptoms following surgical obstruction to the bile flow appeared to be the same. The only difference between the latter condition and that caused either by Lippia or Tribulus is the marked cavernous like dilatations of the extra and intrahepatic bile tracts above the point of obstruction following ligation of the common bile duct. In Lippia and Tribulus poisoning it would appear that the liver makes no such attempt at accommodating the bile in its own channels. In the sheep there is no physiological bilirubinaemia comparable to that found in some other species of domesticated animals. Judging from the clear appearance of the serum and the absence of pigments from it one can conclude that bile elimination is very efficient and that the liver <b>treats</b> the bile <b>pigments</b> as non-threshold bodies. In spite of this efficiency, however, the bile flow can be very severely depressed or totally inhibited in cases of Tribulosis or Lippia poisoning thus leading to a pronounced degree of icterus. From the results obtained from sheep with a biliary fistula it is seen that the daily bile flow amounts to volumes of over 200 c. c. When, therefore, elimination is interfered with, the severity of the jaundice can be well understood. The kidneys under these conditions compensate to some degree for the loss of the liver function as shown by the intensely yellow brown urine voided. The compensation however is not complete since the jaundice persists as long as liver action remains distended. Investigations carried out on the effect of cholagogues on the bile flow of these experimental animals show that the dosing of bile definitely causes an increase in the bile flow from the liver. Bile elimination may however proceed at a steady rate in the absence of any bile constituents returning to the liver, i. e. the entero-hepatic bile salt circulation is not essential for the continued excretion of bile in the sheep. Moreover the appetite and digestion of such fistula annuals are fairly well maintained although a slow and progressive decrease in the body weight is frequently noticeable, this being more evident in some animals than in others. Under the influence of Lippia poisoning, the bile flow of experimental sheep can be very promptly depressed and ultimately even completely inhibited. The main effect of the Lippia toxin on the liver is as yet not clearly understood. It appears to have a paralysing effect on the normal bile excretion for although the liver cells themselves are still capable of allowing the bile to pass through as indicated by the direct van den Bergh reaction, the bile tracts including the smallest bile capillaries seem to be incapable of moving the bile in the normal manner and at the normal rate towards the large bile tracts. This sluggishness in the bile flow results in some of the biliary constituents, e. g. the pigments to escape into the small blood and lymph vessels and so carried back into the general circulation where an extensive and severe jaundice may be caused. The difficulty in explaining the genesis of the icterus arises from the fact that morphological changes in the liver may be slight even in very severe cases of jaundice. This point has also been stressed by other workers. Thus Cantarow and Stewart, studying the morphological changes in the liver and bile passages of cats with total biliary obstruction, state that "these observations seem to indicate that there is no demonstrable correlation in individual instances, between the changes in the liver and bile ducts and the serum bilirubin concentration at any given time during the period of total bile stasis''. The various experiments undertaken with the object of re-establishing the normal bile flow after the onset of Lippia jaundice, have been disappointing in that none of the cholagogues or purgatives used had any definite beneficial effect on the icterus and on the bile flow. Improvement, when it did come about, appeared as a slow process and governed by the powers of the body itself. Other liver poisons, such as chloroform and phosphorus which were also studied, caused acute and severe fatty changes of the liver and frequently accompanied by bilirubinaemia. In no case however was the same intense and persistent jaundice of "geeldikkop" or Lippia poisoning observed. The articles have been scanned in colour with a HP Scanjet 5590; 300 dpi.
