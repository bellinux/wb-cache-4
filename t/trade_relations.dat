40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{addresses the}} general {{question of how}} children 2 ̆ 7 s phonological categories in perception differ from adults 2 ̆ 7 phonological categories. A well-known characteristic of adults 2 ̆ 7 phonological categories is the existence of <b>trading</b> <b>relations</b> and integration among cues to a phonological category. In <b>trading</b> <b>relations,</b> less evidence from one cue to a phonological category can be offset by more evidence from another cue. When cues are integrated by the listener, the cues are not used independently; instead the perceptual value of one cue depends {{on the value of}} another. Little research has previously been carried out into the development of <b>trading</b> <b>relations</b> and integration in children 2 ̆ 7 s speech perception. This dissertation tests two possible factors affecting the development of adultlike trading relations: the distribution of cues in the dialect or language variety being learned, and the development of integration. The results of identification experiments with adult and four- to six-year-old child listeners from different dialects (Standard American English, African American English, and Australian English) suggest that children 2 ̆ 7 s <b>trading</b> <b>relations</b> develop to approximate those of the adults in their dialect group. Children 2 ̆ 7 s <b>trading</b> <b>relations</b> differ, however, in that children make relatively heavier use of one cue to a contrast. The results of a discrimination experiment suggest that integration of vowel duration and first formant (F 1) cues to final stop voicing in Australian English develop gradually in childhood. The implications of this finding are discussed with respect to gesturalist, auditorist, and associative views of <b>trading</b> <b>relations.</b> The finding suggests that whether or not integration for some <b>trading</b> <b>relations</b> results from the recovery of a gesture or the experience of an auditory property, integration for some subtypes of <b>trading</b> <b>relations,</b> such as context effects, may develop as a result of learning from experience with patterns of acoustic covariation among cues to phonological categories. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this report is to test the {{hypothesis}} that speakers utilize an acoustic, rather than articulatory, planning space for speech production. It has been well-documented that many speakers of American English use different tongue configurations to produce /r/ in different phonetic contexts. The acoustic planning hypothesis suggests that although the /r/ configuration varies widely in different contexts, the primary acoustic cue for /r/, a dip in the F 3 trajectory, will be less variable due to tradeoffs in articulatory variability, or <b>trading</b> <b>relations,</b> that help maintain a relatively constant F 3 trajectory across phonetic contexts. Acoustic data and EMMA articulatory data from seven speakers producing /r/ in different phonetic contexts were analyzed. Visual inspection of the EMMA data at the point of F 3 minimum revealed that each speaker appeared to use at least two of three <b>trading</b> <b>relation</b> strategies that would be expected to reduce F 3 variability. Articulatory covariance measures confirmed that all seven speakers utilized a <b>trading</b> <b>relation</b> between tongue back height and tongue back horizontal position, six speakers utilized a <b>trading</b> <b>relation</b> between tongue tip height and tongue back height, and the speaker who did not use this latter strategy instead utilized a <b>trading</b> <b>relation</b> between tongue tip height and tongue back horizontal position. Estimates of F 3 variability with and without the articulatory covariances indicated that F 3 would be much higher for all speakers if the articulatory covariances were not utilized. These conclusions were further supported by a comparison of measured F 3 variability to F 3 variabilities estimated from the pellet data with and without articulatory covariances. In all subjects, the actual F 3 variance was significantly lower than the F 3 variance estimated without articulatory covariances, further supporting the conclusion that the articulatory <b>trading</b> <b>relations</b> were being used to reduce F 3 variability. Together, these results strongly suggest that the neural control mechanisms underlying speech production make elegant use of <b>trading</b> <b>relations</b> between articulators to maintain a relatively invariant acoustic trace for /r/ across phonetic contexts...|$|R
