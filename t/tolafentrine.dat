40|$|Abstract Background The aim of {{the study}} was to assess the chronic effects of {{combined}} phosphodiesterase 3 / 4 inhibitor <b>tolafentrine,</b> administered by inhalation, during monocrotaline-induced pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) in rats. Methods CD rats were given a single subcutaneous injection of monocrotaline to induce PAH. Four weeks after, rats were subjected to inhalation of <b>tolafentrine</b> or sham nebulization in an unrestrained, whole body aerosol exposure system. In these animals (i) the acute pulmonary vasodilatory efficacy of inhaled <b>tolafentrine</b> (ii) the anti-remodeling effect of long-term inhalation of <b>tolafentrine</b> (iii) the effects of <b>tolafentrine</b> on the expression profile of 96 genes encoding cell adhesion and extracellular matrix regulation were examined. In addition, the inhibitory effect of <b>tolafentrine</b> on ex vivo isolated pulmonary artery SMC cell migration was also investigated. Results Monocrotaline injection provoked severe PAH (right ventricular systolic pressure increased from 25. 9 ± 4. 0 to 68. 9 ± 3. 2 after 4 weeks and 74. 9 ± 5. 1 mmHg after 6 weeks), cardiac output depression and right heart hypertrophy. The media thickness of the pulmonary arteries and the proportion of muscularization of small precapillary resistance vessels increased dramatically, and the migratory response of ex-vivo isolated pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMC) was increased. Micro-arrays and subsequent confirmation with real time PCR demonstrated upregulation of several extracellular matrix regulation and adhesion genes, such as matrixmetalloproteases (MMP) 2, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 20, Icam, Itgax, Plat and serpinb 2. When chronically nebulized from day 28 to 42 (12 daily aerosol maneuvers), after full establishment of severe pulmonary hypertension, <b>tolafentrine</b> reversed about 60 % of all hemodynamic abnormalities, right heart hypertrophy and monocrotaline-induced structural lung vascular changes, including the proportion of pulmonary artery muscularization. The upregulation of extracellular matrix regulation and adhesion genes was reduced by nearly 80 % by inhalation of the <b>tolafentrine.</b> When assessed in vitro, <b>tolafentrine</b> blocked the enhanced PASMC migratory response. Conclusion In conclusion, we demonstrate for the first time that inhalation of combined PDE 3 / 4 inhibitor reverses pulmonary hypertension fully developed in response to monocrotaline in rats. This "reverse-remodeling" effect includes structural changes in the lung vascular wall and key molecular pathways of matrix regulation, concomitant with 60 % normalization of hemodynamics. </p...|$|E
40|$|Background—Pulmonary {{arterial}} hypertension {{is characterized by}} a progressive increase in pulmonary vascular resistance caused by endothelial dysfunction, inward vascular remodeling, and severe loss of precapillary pulmonary vessel cross-sectional area. Asymmetrical dimethylarginine (ADMA), an endogenous nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, and its metabolizing enzyme dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH) play important roles in endothelial dysfunc-tion. We investigated whether combined phosphodiesterase (PDE) 3 and 4 inhibition ameliorates endothelial function by regulating the ADMA-DDAH axis. Methods and Results—We investigated the effects of the PDE 3 / 4 inhibitor <b>tolafentrine</b> in vitro on endothelial cell survival, proliferation, and apoptosis. Effects of <b>tolafentrine</b> on the endothelial nitric oxide synthase/nitric oxide pathway, DDAH expression, DDAH promoter activity, and cytokine release from endothelial cells and their subsequent influence on DDAH expression were investigated. In monocrotaline-induced pulmonary {{arterial hypertension}} in rats, the effects of inhaled <b>tolafentrine</b> on DDAH expression and activity were investigated. Real-time-polymerase chain reaction, immunocytochemistry, and PDE activity assays suggested high expression of PDE 3 and PDE 4 isoforms in endothelial cells. Treatment of endothelial cells with PDE 3 / 4 inhibitor significantly decreased ADMA-induced apoptosis via a cAMP/PKA-dependent pathway by induction of DDAH 2.

Chronic nebulization of PDE 3 / 4 inhibitor significantly attenuated monocrotaline-induced hemodynamic, gas exchange abnormalities, vascular remodeling, and right heart hypertrophy. Interestingly, PDE 3 / 4 inhibitor treatment reduced ADMA and elevated nitric oxide/cGMP levels. Mechanistically, this could be attributed to direct modulatory effects of cAMP on the promoter region of DDAH 2, which was consequently found to be increased in expression and activity. Furthermore, PDE 3 / 4 inhibitor suppressed apoptosis in endothelial cells and increased vascularization in the lung. CONCLUSION Combined inhibition of PDE 3 and 4 regresses development of pulmonary hypertension and promotes endothelial regeneration by modulating the ADMA-DDAH axis...|$|E
40|$|During {{in vitro}} culture in 10 % human AB serum, human {{peripheral}} blood monocytes acquire a macrophage-like phenotype. The underlying differentiation {{was characterized by}} increased activities of the macrophage marker enzymes unspecific esterase (NaF-insensitive form) and acid phosphatase, {{as well as by}} a down-regulation in surface CD 14 expression. In parallel, a dramatic change in the phosphodiesterase (PDE) profile became evident within a few days that strongly resembled that previously described for human alveolar macrophages. Whereas PDE 1 and PDE 3 activities were augmented, PDE 4 activity, which represented the major cyclic AMP-hydrolysing activity of peripheral blood monocytes, rapidly declined. Monocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages responded to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) with the release of tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF). In line with the change in CD 14 expression, the EC 50 value of LPS for induction of TNF release increased from approximately 0. 1 [*]ng[*]ml− 1 in peripheral blood monocytes to about 2 [*]ng[*]ml− 1 in macrophages. Both populations of cells were equally susceptible towards inhibition of TNF release by cyclic AMP elevating agents such as dibutyryl cyclic AMP, prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) or forskolin, which all led to a complete abrogation of TNF production in a concentration-dependent manner and which were more efficient than the glucocorticoid dexamethasone. In monocytes, PDE 4 selective inhibitors (rolipram, RP 73401) suppressed TNF formation by 80 %, whereas motapizone, a PDE 3 selective compound, exerted a comparatively weak effect (10 – 15 % inhibition). Combined use of PDE 3 plus PDE 4 inhibitors resulted in an additive effect and fully abrogated LPS-induced TNF release as did the mixed PDE 3 / 4 inhibitor <b>tolafentrine.</b> In monocyte-derived macrophages, neither PDE 3 - nor PDE 4 -selective drugs markedly affected TNF generation when used alone (< 15 % inhibition), whereas in combination, they led to a maximal inhibition of TNF formation by about 40 – 50 %. However, in the presence of PGE 2 (10 [*]nM), motapizone and rolipram or RP 73401 were equally effective and blocked TNF release by 40 %. <b>Tolafentrine</b> or motapizone in the presence of either PDE 4 inhibitor, completely abrogated TNF formation in the presence of PGE 2. Thus, an additional cyclic AMP trigger is necessary for PDE inhibitors to become effective in macrophages. Finally, the putative regulatory role for PDE 1 in the regulation of TNF production in macrophages was investigated. Zaprinast, at a concentration showing 80 % inhibition of PDE 1 activity (100 [*]μmol[*]l− 1), did not influence TNF release. At higher concentrations (1 [*]mmol[*]l− 1), zaprinast became effective, but this inhibition of TNF release can be attributed to a significant inhibitory action of this drug on PDE 3 and PDE 4 isoenzymes. In summary, the in vitro differentiation of human peripheral blood monocytes to macrophages is characterized by a profound change in the PDE isoenzyme pattern. The change in the PDE 4 to PDE 3 ratio is functionally reflected by an altered susceptibility towards selective PDE inhibitors under appropriate stimulating conditions...|$|E
