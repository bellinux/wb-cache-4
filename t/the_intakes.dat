5|$|Situated {{behind the}} leading edge of the wing the engine intake had wing {{boundary}} layer ahead of it. Two thirds was diverted and the remaining third which entered the intake did not adversely affect the intake efficiency except during pushovers when the boundary layer thickened ahead of the intake and caused surging.

5|$|The intake {{design for}} Concorde's engines was {{especially}} critical. <b>The</b> <b>intakes</b> had to provide low distortion levels (to prevent engine surge) and high efficiency for all likely ambient temperatures {{to be met}} in cruise. They had to provide adequate subsonic performance for diversion cruise and low engine-face distortion at take-off. They also had to provide an alternate path for excess intake air during engine throttling or shutdowns. The variable intake features required to meet all these requirements consisted of front and rear ramps, a dump door, an auxiliary inlet and a ramp bleed to the exhaust nozzle.|$|E
5|$|Despite its {{radical and}} unusual shape, the {{airframe}} was built along traditional lines. Except {{for the most}} highly stressed parts, the whole structure was manufactured from standard grades of light alloy.

40|$|Intake of lignans {{has been}} {{assessed}} in different study populations, {{but so far}} none of the studies has compared <b>the</b> daily <b>intake</b> of lignans and the urinary excretion of plant and enterolignans. We assessed <b>the</b> <b>intake</b> of lariciresinol, pinoresinol, secoisolariciresinol and matairesinol in 100 Finnish men consuming their habitual omnivorous diet, and measured the 24 h urinary excretion of plant and enterolignans to compare <b>the</b> <b>intake</b> and metabolism. Dietary determinants of lignan intake and their urinary excretion were also determined. <b>The</b> mean <b>intake</b> of lignans was 1224 (SD 539) mg/d, of which lariciresinol and pinoresinol covered 78 %. Almost half (47 %) of <b>the</b> <b>intake</b> of lignans was explained by <b>the</b> <b>intake</b> of rye products, berries, coffee, tea and roots. The urinary excretion of plant lignans corresponded to 17 % and enterolignans to 92 % of <b>the</b> <b>intake</b> of lignans. <b>The</b> urinary excretion of plant lignans was explained 14 % by <b>the</b> <b>intake</b> of rye products and intake of coffee, and consequently 3 – 7 % by <b>the</b> <b>intake</b> of water-insoluble fibre. The urinary excretion of enterolactone was explained 11 % by <b>the</b> <b>intake</b> of vegetables and rye products, 14 % by <b>the</b> <b>intake</b> of water-soluble fibre and only 4 % by <b>the</b> <b>intake</b> of lariciresinol.

40|$|A 'two dimensional' {{air intake}} comprisipg a wedge {{followed}} by an isentropic compression has been tested in the Cranfield Gun Tunnel at Mach 8, 2.

40|$|Injecting fuel on <b>the</b> <b>intake</b> of a {{scramjet}} {{allows the}} fuel and air to mix {{before entering the}} combustion chamber.

40|$|Food {{depletion}} is {{a common}} phenomena in nature, however {{it is hard to}} measure in the field.

40|$|Based on {{experimental}} {{measurements and}} observations {{in a laboratory}} channel, the hydrodynamic behaviour of the approaching flow {{and the amount of}} sediment entering a right-angled lateral intake in a diversion dam were investigated.

In addition, velocity profiles both upstream and downstream of <b>the</b> <b>intake</b> and <b>the</b> amount of sediment entering it were measured. Analysis of the velocity data showed that the discharge of the sluice gate {{played an important role in}} determining the velocity profile and also the mechanism of sediment entry. All velocity profiles where the sluice gate was closed had an inflection point, where the flow direction changed, leading to a return velocity near the bed. The elevation of this point was a function of <b>the</b> <b>intake</b> discharge and approximately equal to the height of the entrance sill. Experimental observation showed that sediment entered <b>the</b> <b>intake</b> by a tornado-like vortex.

Analysis of the sedimentation data showed that the amount of sediment entering <b>the</b> <b>intake</b> increased with increasing intake discharge.

25|$|The J75 was {{somewhat}} {{larger than the}} J57 in the F-102A, and had greater mass flow. This demanded changes to the inlets to allow more airflow, and {{this led to the}} further refinement of using a variable-geometry inlet duct to allow <b>the</b> <b>intakes</b> to be tuned to best performance across a wide range of supersonic speeds. This change also led to the ducts being somewhat shorter. The fuselage grew slightly longer, and was cleaned up and simplified in many ways. The wing was slightly enlarged in area, and a redesigned vertical tail surface was used. The engine's 2-position afterburner exhaust nozzle was also used for idle thrust control. The nozzle was held open reducing idle thrust by 40% giving slower taxiing and less brake wear.|$|E
25|$|Few aircraft, {{although}} many ramjet-powered missiles, have flown with intakes which have supersonic compression taking place inside the intake duct. These intakes, known as mixed-compression intakes, have advantages for aircraft that cruise at Mach 2.2 and higher. Most supersonic aircraft intakes compress the air externally so do not start and hence have no unstart mode. Mixed compression intakes have the initial supersonic compression externally {{and the remainder}} inside the duct. As an example, <b>the</b> <b>intakes</b> on the B-70 Valkyrie had an external compression ratio (cr) at M3 of 3.5 and internal cr about 6.6, followed by subsonic diffusion.

Other aircraft that have flown with internal compression include the Vought F-8 Crusader III, the SSM-N-9 Regulus II cruise missile and the B-1 Lancer.|$|E
25|$|Although the un-installed Nene had {{a higher}} thrust than the Goblin, the level flight speed was no greater. To reduce the installed-engine intake losses caused by having to feed air to the rear face of the impeller, two {{additional}} intakes were added behind the cockpit; these had the negative side-effect of causing elevator reversal and buffeting tendencies, which in turn reduced the Vampire's Mach limitation. The Vampires of the RAAF were powered by the Nene engine; these were initially outfitted with dorsal intakes, but <b>the</b> <b>intakes</b> were subsequently repositioned underneath the fuselage instead. In 1949, Boulton Paul Aircraft (BPA) redesigned the wing-root intakes and internal ducting based on {{the installation of the}} Nene in the prototype Hawker Sea Hawk.

5000|$|It is {{commonly}} related that [...] "stand off" [...] (air-fuel mix that gets pushed {{back out of}} the port, usually at full throttle / low rpm) is somehow captured by installing a longer intake pipe (stack). but, it is actually that <b>the</b> <b>intake</b> valve is closing too late and the combustion chamber is simply overfilling and blowing back out <b>the</b> <b>intake</b> port, before <b>the</b> <b>intake</b> valve closes.
