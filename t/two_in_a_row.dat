25|$|The IRFU also {{insisted on}} International squad {{training}} sessions taking precedence over Celtic League matches, with Irish provinces (especially Munster and Leinster) occasionally fielding virtual second teams for Celtic League games. Some claimed this {{had the effect}} of devaluing the competition. However, despite this approach, Munster finished second and Leinster third, with Munster winning the Celtic Cup. The Ospreys topped the league table, making it <b>two</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>row</b> for Welsh regional sides.|$|E

Led by Peter Canavan, the under age team reached three All-Ireland Finals, winning <b>two</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>row</b> in 1991, and 1992.

Seattle went through an alternating pattern of winning two games in a row and losing <b>two</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>row,</b> to end at 8-8. Quarterback Dave Krieg passed for 3,602 yards on the season. A final game loss at home to Denver proved to be a microcosm of the season, as the Seahawks squandered an early lead and then had a potentially game-tying field goal attempt hit the upright as time expired.|$|E
25|$|Ben Ali {{initially}} {{took some}} steps to liberalise the regime. He dismantled the personality cult surrounding his predecessor. He also amended {{the constitution to}} limit the president {{to a total of}} three five-year terms, with no more than <b>two</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>row.</b> In 1988, several Islamist activists were released from prison. He also forged a national pact with the Tunisian party Harakat al-Ittijah al-Islami (Islamic Tendency Movement), which had been founded in 1981; later it changed its name to Ennahda (the Renaissance Party). He also changed the ruling party's name to the Democratic Constitutional Rally.|$|E
500|$|The 1952 World Series {{was against}} the Brooklyn Dodgers, who by then had their stars of the 1950s such as Jackie Robinson, Gil Hodges and Duke Snider, with the team later nicknamed [...] "The Boys of Summer". The teams split the first four games. With his {{pitching}} staff tired, Stengel gave the start to late-season acquisition Ewell Blackwell, who surrendered four runs in five innings, and the Yankees lost the game in 11 innings to the Dodgers behind Carl Erskine's complete game. Needing to win <b>two</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>row</b> at Ebbets Field, Stengel pitched Raschi in Game 6, who won it with a save from Reynolds. With no tomorrow in Game 7, Stengel sent four pitchers to the mound. Mantle {{hit a home run}} to break a 2–2 tie, Martin preserved the lead by making a difficult catch off a Robinson popup, and Kuzava again secured the final outs for a Series victory, as the Yankees won 4–2 for their fourth straight World Series victory, matching the record set in 1936–1939, also by the Yankees.|$|E

2500|$|Opening the 2011 {{campaign}} in Miami on Monday Night Football, New England breezed to victory 38–24; Brady set a personal single-game record with 517 passing yards, highlighted by an NFL record-tying 99-yard touchdown reception by Wes Welker. They easily beat San Diego in Week 2 {{in their home}} opener, but in Week 3 their 15-game win streak against the Buffalo Bills finally ended when Tom Brady threw four interceptions, and the Patriots lost 34–31 on a last-second field goal. Determined to not lose <b>two</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>row,</b> the team smashed Oakland 31–19 in Week 4, then got a measure of revenge for the 2010 playoff loss by beating the Jets 30–21. [...] In Week 6, the Dallas Cowboys made their first trip to Foxboro since 2003; they ground to a 16–13 lead late in the fourth quarter, but Brady led a drive ending in a game-winning touchdown to tight end Aaron Hernandez and a 20–16 Patriots win. [...] During the Patriots' subsequent bye week, a minor incident occurred where tight end Rob Gronkowski was seen in a photo with an adult film actress wearing his game shirt. [...] Following a 25–17 loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers, wide receiver Julian Edelman was arrested for indecent assault following an incident in a Back Bay nightclub on Halloween night. [...] In what was a Super Bowl preview, the Giants beat the Patriots 24–20 on a last-second drive. [...] The Patriots would win their last eight games to take the top seed in the AFC playoffs.|$|E
2500|$|The {{following}} season saw improvements {{for both}} teams, from Miami's acquisition of Ray Allen and Chris Andersen, {{to the emergence}} of Paul George and Lance Stephenson. Notably, it was after the Heat lost to the Pacers that they compiled a 27-game winning streak; the last time the Heat lost <b>two</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>row</b> in the year were the games against Indiana and Portland. During the waning minutes of Game 6 in the Semifinals between the Pacers and the New York Knicks, the Pacers' fans were chanting [...] "Beat The Heat" [...] as their team beat their old New York rivals. True to form, the Heat and the Pacers met in the Conference Finals of the 2013 NBA Playoffs on May 22, 2013. Several instances of physicality became prominent in the series: Shane Battier received an offensive foul for throwing his knee at Hibbert's midsection; Hibbert claimed that it was intentional dirty play on the part of Battier. Andersen suffered a bloodied nose after colliding with David West. Ian Mahinmi received a retroactive flagrant foul for a grab of James' arm. Norris Cole latched a hand on West's groin area as he tried to slip through West. Wade received a retroactive flagrant foul for hitting Stephenson in the head, another incident that the Pacers, notably Paul George, felt was a dirty play. The Heat survived Game 1 on a James game-winning layup, while the Pacers came back to tie the series at 1–1 after forcing James into two late fourth-quarter turnovers for Game 2. In Game 3, the Heat set a team record for points in a postseason half with 70. It {{was the first time the}} Pacers had given up 70 points since 1992. Allen's single turnover was the least ever suffered by the Heat in a first half. Their five total turnovers is tied for the fewest in franchise history. The Game 3 victory marked the first time that an NBA team had won five straight road games by double digits. The Heat won the series 4–3, with a 99–76 win in game 7. In 2014, the Pacers and Heat renewed their rivalry in a second consecutive East Finals match up with the Heat eliminating the Pacers again.|$|E

The Heat would go on to eliminate the Pacers 4–2 games, advancing to their fourth consecutive NBA Finals in the Big Three-era. The Heat stumbled during Game 1 in Indianapolis, falling 96–107. They would win Games 2–4. During Game 5 (which Miami lost 90–93), James struggled, suffering heavy foul trouble and scoring only 7 points, his lowest Playoff record. During Game 6 in Miami, the Heat would blow out the Pacers 117–92.|$|E
