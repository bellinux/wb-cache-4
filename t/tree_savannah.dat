40|$|Morphological, geochemical and mineralogical {{studies were}} carried out in a {{representative}} soil catena of the low-elevation plateaux of the upper Amazon Basin to interpret the steps and mechanisms involved in the podzolization of low-activity clay soils. The soils are derived from Palaeozoic sandstones. They consist of Hydromorphic Podzols under <b>tree</b> <b>savannah</b> in the depressions of the plateaux and predominantly of Acrisols covered by evergreen forest elsewhere. Incipient podzolization in the uppermost Acrisols is related to the formation of organic-rich A and Bhs horizons slightly depleted in fine-size particles by both mechanical particle transfer and weathering. Weathering of secondary minerals by organic acids and formation of organo-metallic complexes act simultaneously over short distances. Their vertical transfer is limited. Selective dissolution of aluminous goethite, then gibbsite and finally kaolinite favour the preferential cheluviation of first Fe and secondly Al. The relatively small amount of organo-metallic complexes produced is related to the quartzitic parent materials, and the predominance of Al over Fe in the spodic horizons is due to the importance of gibbsite in these low-activity clay soils. Morphologically well-expressed podzols occur in strongly iron-depleted topsoils of the depression. Mechanical transfer and weathering of gibbsite and kaolinite by organic acids is enhanced and leads to residual accumulation of sands. Organo-metallic complexes are translocated in strongly permeable sandy horizons and impregnate at depth the macro-voids of embedded soil and saprolite materials to form the spodic Bs and 2 BCs horizons. Mechanical transfer of black particulate organic compounds devoid of metals has occurred later within the sandy horizons of the podzols. Their vertical transfer has formed well-differentiated A and Bh horizons. Their lateral removal by groundwater favours the development of an albic E horizon. In an open and waterlogged environment, the general trend is therefore towards the removal of all the metals that have initially accumulated {{as a response to the}} ferralitization process and have temporarily been sequestrated in organic complexes in previous stages of soil podzolization...|$|E

40|$|The {{accelerated}} {{growth of}} the agricultural sector experienced in the country has caused negative impacts on land cover, which can be diagnosed by means of appropriate methodologies that allows to measure its magnitude in a particular spatial-temporal area. In this context, {{the objective of this}} study was to analyze the evolution of vegetation cover in the city of Anapurus - MA and its relationship with the land use through the LANDSAT satellite images for the recognition of the local agricultural landscape and its evolution Over more than two decades (1987 - 2011), comprising a database to assist in policy guiding regional development. The satellite images used to identify areas correspond to the orbit / point 220 / 062, bands 3. 4 and 5, and refer to the dates of passage, 15 / 07 / 1987, 16 / 07 / 1999, 27 / 07 / 2009, 15 / 08 / 2010 and 05 / 10 / 2011. It was found that among the classes of vegetation cover of the wooded savanna was the one that suffered the greatest decrease, from 26, 609 ha (43. 64 %) in 1987 to 6, 293 ha in 2011. The average intensity of reduction of area wooded savanna, from 1987 to 1999, was 139. 5 ha / year. However, only one year (2010 to 2011) the devastation of this vegetation was severely accelerated, rising to 4, 842 ha / year. Rather, the areas of agricultural use increased from 1987 to 2009 a mean intensity of 605. 80 ha/year, however, in just one year (2010 - 2011) it increased sharply to 5496. 75 ha/year, can this "boom "is associated with the current economic growth experienced by the country.

40|$|The Cagayan Valley basin is a north-south {{trending}} interarc basin {{in which}} 10, 000 meters of marine, transitional marine, and fluvial sediments have been deposited since the Oligocene. The Plio-Pleistocene sediments have been {{divided into two}} lithostratigraphic units, the Plio-Pleistocene Ilagan Formation and the Pleistocene Awidon Mesa Formation. The Ilagan Formation {{is divided into two}} members, a Lower Member formed by 310 m of interbedded sandstone and mudstone, and an Upper Member formed by 500 m of pebble conglomerates, sandstones, siltstones, tuffs, and claystones. The Awidon Mesa Formation conformably overlies the Ilagan Formation and is composed of 400 m of pebble to boulder conglomerates, tuff-breccias, tuffs, sandstones, and claystones. The sediments which were derived from volcanic and plutonic igneous rocks in the adjacent volcanic arcs are predominantly composed of volcaniclastic detritus which has been diagenetically altered by dissolution and cementation processes. Five major lithofacies are recognized in the Plio-Pleistocene sequence. The facies and respective depositional environments are: (1) the interbedded fine grained sandstone and mudstone facies: delta front distal bar and distributary mouth bar; (2) the lenticular cross bedded, medium grained sandstone and siltstone facies: delta plain distributary channel, levee, and flood basin; (3) the polymictic conglomerate, trough cross bedded sandstone and claystone facies: low energy fluvial channel and floodplain; (4) the clast supported polymictic conglomerate and sandstone facies: high energy channel bar and gravel sheet; and (5) the massive matrix supported pebble to boulder conglomerate, tuff-breccia, and tuff facies; lahar, pyroclast flow and fall. The facies record a regression of the Pliocene Sea as the region was uplifted and the basin filled with detritus from the surrounding volcanic arcs. A lobate high constructive delta complex prograded to the north as it received sediment from a large north flowing meandering stream system. In the Pleistocene geanticlinal uplift of the Cordillera Central volcanic arc resulted in the formation of an alluvial fan complex along the western side of the valley. Concomitant plinian and pelean volcanic eruptions in the Cordillera produced pyroclast flows which spread across the fan and into the valley. In the middle Pleistocene, the Cagayan Valley alluvial plain supported a <b>tree</b> <b>savannah</b> ecosystem and large grazing mammals which migrated from Asia via a land-bridge. Paleolithic stone tools found in surface associations with fossilized remains of the middle Pleistocene fauna suggest that hominids also migrated to the Philippines in the Pleistocene. Thus far, no skeletal evidence of hominids has been found in the sediments which were folded in the middle to late Pleistocene due to gravity sliding of unstable uplifted sediments...|$|E

40|$|In African <b>savannahs,</b> large <b>trees</b> improve grass quality, {{particularly}} in dry and nutrient poor areas. Enhanced below-canopy grass nutrients, such as {{nitrogen and phosphorus}} contents should therefore attract and benefit grazers. To predict whether ungulates really need these forage quality islands we focused on four grazer species, i. e., zebra, buffalo, wildebeest, and warthog, differing in body size and digestive system. We confronted literature estimations of their feeding requirements with forage availability and quality, observed in three South African savannah systems, through linear modelling. The model predicted the proportion of below-canopy grass that grazers should include in their diet to meet their nutritional requirements. During the wet season, the model predicted that all animals could satisfy their daily nutrient requirements when feeding {{on a combination of}} below- and outside-canopy grasses. However, wildebeest, having relatively high nutrient demands, could meet their nutrient requirements only by feeding almost exclusively below canopies. During the dry season, all animals could gain almost twice as much digestible protein when feeding on below - compared to outside-canopy forage. Nonetheless, only warthogs could satisfy their nutrient requirements - when feeding almost exclusively on below-canopy grasses. The other ungulate species could not meet their phosphorus demands by feeding at either site without exceeding their maximum fibre intake, indicating the unfavourable conditions during the dry season. We conclude that grazing ungulates, particularly warthog, zebra, and buffalo, actually depend on the available below-canopy grass resources. Our model therefore helps to quantify the importance of higher quality forage patches beneath <b>savannah</b> <b>trees.</b> The composition of grazer communities depending on below-canopy grasses can be anticipated if grazer food requirements and the abundance of large <b>trees</b> in <b>savannahs</b> are known. The model suggests that the conservation of large single-standing <b>trees</b> in <b>savannahs</b> is crucial for maintenance of locally grazing herbivore...|$|R

Here, we evaluate the applicability to plants of the remedy of choice in animal studies: capture–recapture modelling. The plant equivalents, tagging and resighting, were caried outnin 7 censuses, involving 4, 145 juvenile trees of 8 dominant savannah species. Using models with joint analysis of live and dead encounters, the resighting probabilities averaged 0. 88 ± 0. 15 and 0. 92 ± 0. 10 for seedlings and resprouts respectively; while dead recovery probabilities averaged 0. 71 ± 0. 25 for all age–classes. An ad hoc method that did not take into account encounter probabilities yielded biased survival estimates compared with estimates obtained using the mark–resighting–recovery approaches. This bias was observed even at high encounter probabilities, and we recommend therefore capture–recapture models where plant encounter is less than one. Finally, survival probabilities estimated by models based only on live or on dead data might both differ and be less accurate than estimates based on combined data. This highlights the advantages of models with joint analysis of live and dead encounters even the value of site fidelity is one...|$|R
