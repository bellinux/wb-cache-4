30|$|In summary, {{addition}} of TNT to ionic liquid {{was found to}} be a fruitful method to enhance both ionic conductivity and lithium <b>transference</b> <b>number</b> via anion-TiO 2 interaction. When interaction between anion-anion receptor is strong, enhancement of lithium <b>transference</b> <b>number</b> results in generally decreased carrier ion number and lower ionic conductivity. On the other hand, when anion-anion receptor interaction is weak, only enhancement of ionic conductivity is observed with no enhancement in lithium <b>transference</b> <b>number.</b> In the present system, moderate TNT-TFSA anion interaction led to desirable enhancement of both ionic conductivity and lithium <b>transference</b> <b>number</b> at the same time.|$|E

Several studies have probed their conductivity and electrochemical stability but very little {{work has been done}} related to lithium <b>transference</b> <b>numbers.</b> Lithium ion <b>transference</b> <b>numbers,</b> the net number of Faradays carried by lithium upon the passage of 1 Faraday of charge across a cell, are key figures of merit for any potential lithium battery electrolytes.

The electrical conductivity of doped ceria is much dependent of the kind and the concentration of dopants.
