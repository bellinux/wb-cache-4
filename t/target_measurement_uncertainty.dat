40|$|The Federal Soil Protection and Contaminated Sites Ordinance (BBodSchV, 1999) regulates action, {{trigger and}} precautionary values for {{contaminants}} in soils. The requirements in soil analysis and quality assurance are committed including {{the estimation of}} <b>measurement</b> <b>uncertainty</b> {{as well as the}} indication of <b>measurement</b> <b>uncertainty</b> for the <b>measurement</b> results of the analysis. Without the information of <b>measurement</b> <b>uncertainty</b> decision making with respect to whether measurement results are in compliance with statutory limits could not be realised. In order to fulfil the assessment of measurement results by taking the <b>measurement</b> <b>uncertainties</b> into account an approach was developed while consideration {{of the state of the}} art and legislative aspects. A comprehensive evaluation of collaborative trials on contaminants in soil was conducted to estimate the order of magnitude of the expected <b>measurement</b> <b>uncertainties</b> in soil analysis. The results are parameter-specific uncertainties which have to be integrated in the assessment of compliance with legal limits. This approach does not replace the estimation of <b>measurement</b> <b>uncertainties</b> as required by DIN EN ISO/IEC 17025 : 2005 - 08. Thus, in addition <b>measurement</b> <b>uncertainties</b> were calculated exemplarily with respect to different soils and concentration levels. The main uncertainty sources in soil analysis are calibration, method precision, recovery and inhomogeneity of soil samples. Requirements in the estimation of <b>measurement</b> <b>uncertainties</b> are formulated for soil analyses which are applicable considering the state of the art. <b>Target</b> <b>measurement</b> <b>uncertainties</b> and variance functions derived from collaborative trial data can be used as a plausibility check of estimated uncertainties in the laboratory. The <b>target</b> <b>measurement</b> <b>uncertainties</b> reflect concentration levels of the action, trigger and precautionary values for contaminants in soils and available data.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an estimation based backstepping like control law design for an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) to track {{a moving target}} in 3 -D space. A ground-based sensor or an onboard seeker antenna provides range, azimuth angle, and elevation angle measurements to a chaser UAV that implements an extended Kalman filter (EKF) to estimate the full state of the target. A nonlinear controller then utilizes this estimated target state and the chaser’s state to provide speed, flight path, and course/heading angle commands to the chaser UAV. Tracking performance with respect to <b>measurement</b> <b>uncertainty</b> is evaluated for three cases: (1) stationary white noise; (2) stationary colored noise and (3) non-stationary (range correlated) white noise. Furthermore, {{in an effort to}} improve tracking performance, the measurement model is made more realistic by taking into consideration range-dependent <b>uncertainties</b> in the <b>measurements,</b> i. e., as the chaser closes in on the <b>target,</b> <b>measurement</b> <b>uncertainties</b> are reduced in the EKF, thus providing the UAV with more accurate control commands.

This {{is based on a}} modified version of the gamma index that could be suitable for fitness-for-purpose assessment given that one can choose various criteria depending on applications. The method is first presented and then applied to both land and atmospheric ECVs. The terrestrial analysis concerns the global surface albedo, using monthly white-sky surface albedo in the visible, near-infrared and shortwave broadband spectral ranges at a spatial resolution of 0. 05 ◦ using three sources of products. The latter study is conducted using monthly aerosol optical depth (AOD) products at 550 nm at a spatial resolution of 1 ◦ with four different datasets at the global scale. The analysis shows how the values of the gamma criteria impact the spatial and temporal results. As an example, if the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) actual <b>target</b> <b>measurements</b> <b>uncertainty</b> is used as an acceptance criteria for the intensity tolerance the results show that: 1) the seasonal agreement for the surface albedo products varies over 20 % to 40 % of the terrestrial surface in the shortwave and near-infrared broadband and from 10 % to 30 % in the visible one and 2) the three aerosols optical depth products agree with the reference one for over 50 % of the land surface only when the tolerance distance term is at 224 km.

40|$|Although point {{caustics}} harbour {{a larger}} potential {{for measuring the}} brightness profile of stars {{during the course of}} a microlensing event than (line-shaped) fold caustics, the effect of lens binarity significantly limits the achievable accuracy. Therefore, corresponding close-impact events make a less favourable case for limb-darkening measurements than those events that involve fold-caustic passages, from which precision measurements can easily and routinely be obtained. Examples involving later Bulge giants indicate that a ~ 10 % misestimate on the limb-darkening coefficient can result with the assumption of a single-lens model that looks acceptable, unless the precision of the photometric measurements is pushed below the 1 %-level even for these favourable <b>targets.</b> In contrast, <b>measurement</b> <b>uncertainties</b> on the proper motion between lens and source are dominated by the assessment of the angular radius of the source star and remain practically unaffected by lens binarity.

Here, one key element is to minimise the <b>uncertainty</b> of the <b>measurements.</b> This, to put it simple, is the noise of sensor data, which has a negative effect on control. Although <b>measurement</b> <b>uncertainty</b> is well treated in control theory, it is usually ignored in common real-time architectures where temporal properties are the prevalent criteria. Consequently, the communication between control engineers and real-time specialists is rather one way, revolving around deadlines and sampling periods. However, on closer examination, many real-time properties are derived from the <b>measurement</b> <b>uncertainty</b> aspired by the control engineer. Conversely, temporal variations, virtually inevitable in practice, can be represented as <b>measurement</b> <b>uncertainty</b> as well. Tackling the <b>measurement</b> <b>uncertainty</b> should therefore be an interdisciplinary task: The control system respects the actual run-time conditions instead of estimating them. Likewise, the real-time system considers <b>measurement</b> <b>uncertainty</b> rather than blindly sticking to deadlines. In this paper we present an uncertainty-centric approach to leverage <b>measurement</b> <b>uncertainty</b> in real-time architectures, not only at design time but also at run-time.

The focus in REIMEP- 17 was on measurements of the uranium and plutonium amount contents, and isotope amount ratios in synthetic input solutions. Participants received two test samples, REIMEP- 17 A and REIMEP 17 B, with different uranium and plutonium amount contents. Laboratories were requested to report the results with associated uncertainties applying their standard measurement procedures, and had the possibility to benchmark those results against the independent assigned (reference) values and the International <b>Target</b> Values for <b>Measurement</b> <b>Uncertainties</b> in Safeguarding Nuclear Materials (ITV 2010). It can be concluded that the participants in REIMEP- 17 performed well for the measurements of uranium and plutonium amount content in compliance with the respective ITV 2010. In particular, the measurement performance for the isotope amount ratios was very satisfactory for both REIMEP- 17 test samples. This confirms the measurement capabilities of laboratories in the field of nuclear material analysis and demonstrates that the stringent ITV 2010 are achievable target values under state-of-practice conditions. On the other hand, the spread of results for the minor uranium isotope amount ratios was larger. Moreover, for some of the measurands, differences in the <b>measurement</b> <b>uncertainty</b> estimations provided by laboratories were observed even when using the same instrumental technique.
