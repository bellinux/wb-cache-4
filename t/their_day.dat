5|$|Emus are diurnal {{birds and}} spend <b>their</b> <b>day</b> foraging, {{preening}} their plumage with their beak, dust bathing and resting. They are generally gregarious birds {{apart from the}} breeding season, and while some forage, others remain vigilant to their mutual benefit. They are able to swim when necessary, although they rarely do so unless the area is flooded or they need to cross a river.|$|E
5|$|Hot Jupiters, due {{to their}} extreme proximities to their host stars, {{have been shown to}} be losing their atmospheres into space due to stellar radiation, much like the tails of comets.

5|$|Bee-eaters spend around 10% of <b>their</b> <b>day</b> on comfort activities. These include sunning themselves, {{dust bathing}} and water bathing. Sunning {{behaviour}} helps warm {{birds in the}} morning, reducing the need to use energy to raise their temperature. It also has a social aspect, as multiple birds adopt the same posture. Finally, it may help stimulate parasites in the feathers, making them easier to find and remove. Due to their hole-nesting lifestyle, bee-eaters accumulate a number of external parasites such as mites and flies. Together with sunning, bouts of dust bathing (or water bathing where available), as well as rigorous preening, keep the feathers and skin in good health. Bathing with water involves making shallow dives into a water body and then returning to a perch to preen.|$|E

His work as an interior designer resulted in an array of influential interior spaces, including luxurious cocktail lounges such as the Top of the Mark at the Mark Hopkins Hotel, the Patent Leather Bar at the St. Francis Hotel and the Cirque Room at The Fairmont, three of the most successful San Francisco bars in <b>their</b> <b>day.</b>|$|E

5|$|The Caio Duilio {{class was}} a pair of ironclad turret ships built for the Royal Italian Navy (Regia Marina) in the 1870s and 1880s.

5|$|The {{national}} anthem is frequently played at sign-ons and sign-offs of TV {{and radio stations}} in Singapore, but that use of the anthem has declined somewhat {{by the emergence of}} 24-hour TV channels and radio stations.

5|$|According to oral history, Rainilaiarivony {{was born}} on a {{day of the week}} {{traditionally}} viewed as inauspicious for births. Custom in much of Madagascar dictated that such unlucky children had to be subjected to a trial by ordeal, such as prolonged exposure to the elements, since it was believed the misfortune of <b>their</b> <b>day</b> of birth would ensure a short and cursed life for the child and its family. But rather than leave the child to die, Rainilaiarivony's father reportedly followed the advice of an ombiasy (astrologer) and instead amputated a joint from two fingers on his infant son's left hand to dispel the ill omen. The infant was nonetheless kept outside the house to avert the possibility that evil might still befall the family if the child remained under their roof. Relatives took pity and adopted Rainilaiarivony to raise him within their own home. Meanwhile, Rainilaiarivony's older brother Rainivoninahitriniony enjoyed the double privilege of his status as elder son and freedom from a predestined evil fate. Rainiharo selected and groomed his elder son to follow in his footsteps as Commander-in-Chief and Prime Minister, while Rainilaiarivony was left to make his way in the world by his own merits.|$|E
5|$|Architecture {{during the}} early English Renaissance was far less formal than that of {{mainland}} Europe and drew from a greater selection of motifs both ancient and modern, with less emphasis placed on the strict observance of rules derived from antique architecture. This {{has led to an}} argument that the style was an evolution of Gothic rather than an innovation imported from Europe. This argument is evident at Montacute, where Gothic pinnacles, albeit obelisk in form, are combined with Renaissance gables, pediments, classical statuary, ogee roofs and windows appearing as bands of glass. This profusion of large, mullioned windows, an innovation of <b>their</b> <b>day,</b> give the appearance that the principal façade is built entirely of glass; a similar fenestration was employed at Hardwick Hall in Derbyshire. However, despite the Dutch gables, a feature of the English Renaissance acquired as the style spread from France across the Low Countries to England, and the Gothic elements, much of the architectural influence is Italian.|$|E
5|$|As {{was common}} in <b>their</b> <b>day,</b> The Kangaroos {{began to move}} around between territories to avoid overexposure. The team arrived in Championship Wrestling from Florida billed as NWA Florida United States Tag Team Champions. It was a tag team title they never {{technically}} won, but were instead awarded by the promoter. The Kangaroos stayed in Florida, defending against all challengers until the duo of Eddie Graham and Dick Steinborn took the United States titles from them in a match on 1 November 1961. In 1962, The Kangaroos once again traveled across the United States, working for the Midwest Wrestling Association of Ohio where they held the Ohio version of the NWA United States tag team title. They also toured Japan with the Japan Wrestling Association and {{were the first to}} hold the Japanese version of the NWA International Tag Team Championship. In 1964, Costello and Heffernan made their west coast debut, working in Los Angeles, California for the World Wrestling Association (WWA) where they beat Édouard Carpentier and Ernie Ladd for the WWA World Tag Team Championship. The Kangaroos held the titles for three months before losing them to the Torres brothers (Alberto and Ramon) on 28 April 1964.|$|E

5|$|Down {{from the}} slopes {{in front of}} Prokhorovka, the massed Soviet armour charged with five tank brigades of the 18th and 29th Tank Corps, firing as they came at Leibstandartes positions. As the Soviet tanks rolled down the slopes, they carried {{the men of the}} 9th Guards Airborne Division on their hulls. The troops of Leibstandarte were not slated to go into action until later in the day. Exhausted from the {{previous}} week's fighting, many were just starting <b>their</b> <b>day</b> {{at the outset of the}} attack. As the Soviet armour appeared, German outposts all across the corps' frontage began firing purple warning flares signalling a tank attack. Obersturmbannführer Rudolf von Ribbentrop, commander of a panzer company under the 1st SS-Panzer Regiment, stated that he knew at once a major attack was underway. He ordered his company of seven Panzer IVs to follow him over a bridge across an anti-tank ditch. Crossing the bridge they fanned out on the lower slope of Hill 252.2. On the crest of the hill, Sturmbannführer Joachim Peiper's 3rd Panzergrenadier Battalion of the 2nd SS-Panzergrenadier Regiment were being overrun.|$|E
5|$|Loggerhead {{sea turtles}} {{observed}} in captivity {{and in the}} wild are most active during the day. In captivity, the loggerheads' daily activities are divided between swimming and resting on the bottom. While resting, they spread their forelimbs to about midstroke swimming position. They remain motionless with eyes open or half-shut and are easily alerted during this state. At night, captives sleep {{in the same position}} with their eyes tightly shut, and are slow to react. Loggerheads spend up to 85% of <b>their</b> <b>day</b> submerged, with males being the more active divers than females. The average duration of dives is 15–30 min, but they can stay submerged for up to four hours. Juvenile loggerheads and adults differ in their swimming methods. A juvenile keeps its forelimbs pressed to the side of its carapace, and propels itself by kicking with its hind limbs. As the juvenile matures, its swimming method is progressively replaced with the adult's alternating-limb method. They depend entirely on this method of swimming by one year old.|$|E
5|$|On April4, 2015, the Storm Prediction Center (SPC) issued <b>their</b> <b>Day</b> 6 {{severe weather}} outlook, {{highlighting}} a substantial and widespread risk for severe weather from southeastern Oklahoma to northeastern Illinois valid for April9.

On April7, a Day 3 Enhanced risk was issued across most of Illinois, eastern Missouri, and small portions of adjacent states. No further {{changes to the}} threat level were made, although the Enhanced risk was significantly expanded late on April8 to include portions of the southern Great Lakes, lower Ohio Valley, Ozark Plateau, and Arklatex region. Around midday on April9, the SPC issued a 10% hatched tornado threat area across much of northern Illinois and small portions of nearby states, signifying the potential for several tornadoes, of which one or two {{had the potential to}} be strong (EF2 or stronger on the Enhanced Fujita scale).|$|E
