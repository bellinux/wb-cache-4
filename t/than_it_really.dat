5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began on}} November 9, 1981, and ended on January 29, 1982. The Wrath of Khan was more action-oriented than its predecessor, but less costly to make. The project was supervised by Paramount's television unit {{rather than its}} theatrical division. Bennett, a respected television veteran, made The Wrath of Khan on a budget of $11million—far less than The Motion Pictures $46million. The budget was initially lower at $8.5 million, but it rose when the producers were impressed by {{the first two weeks}} of footage. Meyer used camera and set tricks to spare the construction of large and expensive sets. For a scene taking place at Starfleet Academy, a forced perspective was created by placing scenery close to the camera to give the sense the set was larger <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> was. To present the illusion that the Enterprises elevators moved between decks, corridor pieces were wheeled out of sight to change the hall configuration while the lift doors were closed. Background equipment such as computer terminals were rented when possible instead of purchased outright. Some designed props, such as a redesigned phaser and communicator, were vetoed by Paramount executives in favor of existing materials from The Motion Picture.|$|E
5|$|Ten {{stars have}} been found to have planets to date, and four {{planetary}} systems have been discovered with the SuperWASP project. HD 142 is a yellow giant that has an apparent magnitude of 5.7, and has a planet (HD 142 b)1.36 times the mass of Jupiter which orbits every 328 days. HD 2039 is a yellow subgiant with an apparent magnitude of 9.0 around 330 light years away which has a planet (HD 2039 b) triple the mass of Jupiter. WASP-18 is a star of magnitude 9.29 which was discovered to have a hot Jupiter-like planet (WASP-18b) taking less than a day to orbit the star. The planet is suspected to be causing WASP-18 to appear older <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> is. WASP-4 and WASP-5 are solar-type yellow stars around 1000 light years distant and of 13th magnitude, each with a single planet larger than Jupiter. WASP-29 is an orange dwarf of spectral type K4V and visual magnitude 11.3, which has a planetary companion of similar size and mass to Saturn. The planet completes an orbit every 3.9 days.|$|E
25|$|Britain {{was still}} {{in the midst of the}} War of the Austrian Succession and most of the British army was in Flanders and Germany, leaving an inexperienced army of about 4,000 in Scotland under Sir John Cope. His force marched north into the Highlands but, believing the rebel force to be {{stronger}} <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> was, avoided an engagement with the Jacobites at the Pass of Corryairack and withdrew northwards to Inverness.|$|E

The crucial question which must be answered therefore is what the [...] "real value" [...] of commodities actually is, what their real worth is, and how that could be objectively established. A related question is why the [...] "victim" [...] traded at a lower price, when he could have gotten a higher price elsewhere.|$|R
50|$|The seven-ball had to {{be called}} before being pocketed. Failing to call it or calling a pocket other <b>than</b> where <b>it</b> <b>really</b> went {{would result in the}} seven-ball being re-spotted and player at the table losing his turn. Also, winning by {{pocketing}} the seven-ball wasn't permitted.|$|R
25|$|David Kronke, The Daily News of Los Angeles (April 22, 2001) — Nero Wolfe, alas, is {{undone by}} uneven {{performances}} {{and a sense}} that it's more witty and urbane <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> is. Hutton is too antic — {{he seems to be}} playing the sassy newsroom copy boy in a '30s B-picture — and his narration tries far too hard to push jokes that just aren't funny. Maury Chaykin, a normally reliable character actor, is alternately flat or rudderlessly blustery as Wolfe.|$|E
25|$|During {{the war and}} {{for many}} years afterward, the FBI {{maintained}} a fictionalized {{version of the story}} in which it had preempted and caught the saboteurs solely by its own investigations and had even infiltrated the German government. This story was useful during the war to discourage the Germans by making the FBI seem more invincible <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> was and perhaps afterward to similarly mislead the Soviets; but it also served Hoover in his efforts to maintain a superhero-style image for the FBI in American minds.|$|E
25|$|A long tram line, about 17 versts (18 kilometres) long, {{was laid}} from the Poshtova Square in the Podil neighbourhood, over the Dnieper on the Nicholas Bridge, through the Peredmostna and Nikolska Slobodka neighbourhoods, {{and to the}} {{neighbouring}} town of Brovary. The line was used until the mid-1930s, and was a one-way line with side-skirts for oncoming trams to drive into. This had made the trip even longer <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> was. The cost was 35 kopecks, {{a fair amount of}} money at the time. Nevertheless, the trams were always packed with passengers.|$|E

25|$|Virtual gastric band uses {{hypnosis}} to {{make the}} brain think the stomach is smaller <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> is and hence lower {{the amount of food}} ingested. This brings as a consequence weight reduction. This method is complemented with psychological treatment for anxiety management and with hypnopedia. Research has been conducted into the use of hypnosis as a weight management alternative. In 1996 a study found that cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) was more effective for weight reduction if reinforced with hypnosis. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy ACT, a mindfulness approach to weight loss, has also {{in the last few years}} been demonstrating its usefulness.|$|E
25|$|On March 4, 2007, Hansbrough had 26 {{points and}} 17 rebounds before {{suffering}} an injury that looked worse <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> {{was in the}} closing seconds of the Tar Heels' 86–72 win over Duke, clinching the top seed in the Atlantic Coast Conference tournament. With 14.5 {{seconds left in the}} game, Hansbrough leaped for a layup. After the ball left his hand, he was struck in the face by Gerald Henderson's right elbow. The errant elbow broke Hansbrough's nose. Henderson was ejected from the game and received an automatic one-game suspension from the NCAA. Hansbrough went on to play with a nose-guard/face mask through the postseason, before taking it off {{in the second half of}} a game against Michigan State, in the second round of the 2007 NCAA tournament.|$|E
500|$|Any {{addition}} of carbon {{to a sample}} of a different age will cause the measured date to be inaccurate. Contamination with modern carbon causes a sample to appear to be younger <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> is: the effect is greater for older samples. If a sample that is 17,000 years old is contaminated so that 1% of the sample is modern carbon, it will appear to be 600 years younger; for a sample that is 34,000 years old the same amount of contamination would cause an error of 4,000 years. Contamination with old carbon, with no remaining , causes an error in the other direction [...] independent of age– a sample contaminated with 1% old carbon will appear to be about 80 years older <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> is, regardless of the date of the sample.|$|E

500|$|Commenting in {{an article}} in Cherwell, Samuel Rutishauser-Mills {{questioned}} why the media bothered reporting on Gasper's anti-LGBT comments, noting that as a parish councillor her [...] "political significance is tenuous... and scarcely newsworthy or interesting."

500|$|Throughout the war, the garrisoned {{army was}} {{supported}} by the women of the town; they aided in the building of the earthen fortifications, and then later disguised themselves as men during the siege to make it appear that the town was held by more troops <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> was. They also ran ammunition around the town and helped to reload the weapons. Their efforts drew comparisons to Joan of Arc, and an essay was written by James Strong detailing their achievements, entitled [...] "Joanereidos, or Feminine Valour eminently discovered in West County Women, at the Siege of Lyme, 1644." ...|$|E
500|$|Mistakenly {{assuming}} {{their ground}} speed to be faster <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> was, the crew may have deduced {{that they had}} already safely crossed the Andes, and so commenced their descent to Santiago, whereas in fact they were still a considerable distance to the east-north-east and were approaching the cloud-shrouded Tupungato Glacier at high speed. Some BSAA pilots, however, have expressed scepticism at this theory; convinced that Cook would not have started his descent without a positive indication that he had crossed the mountains, they have suggested that strong winds may have brought down the craft in some other way. One of the pilots recalled that [...] "we had all been warned not to enter cloud over the mountains as the turbulence and icing posed too great a threat." ...|$|E

50|$|In Ritter's opinion, Germany can {{be criticized}} for its mistaken {{evaluation}} {{of the state of}} European power politics in July 1914. According to Ritter, the German government had underrated the state of military readiness in Russia and France, falsely assumed that British foreign policy was more peaceful <b>than</b> what <b>it</b> <b>really</b> was, overrated the sense of moral outrage caused by the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand on European opinion, and above all, overestimated the military power and political common sense of Austria-Hungary.|$|R

500|$|The Gestapo {{investigated}} the 20 July plot thoroughly, so filmmakers {{had access to}} much documentation as they integrated the historical account with [...] "Hollywood factors" [...] in producing Valkyrie. Peter Hoffmann, {{professor of history at}} McGill University and a leading authority on the German Resistance, was a consultant for the filmmakers. Hoffmann spoke of the film's accuracy, [...] " [...] gives a fundamentally accurate portrait of Stauffenberg and the conspirators. There are details which must be counted as liberties. But, fundamentally, the film is decent, respectful and represents the spirit of the conspiracy." [...] The Scotsman reported of the film's accuracy, [...] "Valkyrie ... sticks pretty closely to the story of the failed conspiracy to topple the Nazi regime ... it implies that the plot came closer to success <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> did. But the basic facts are all present and correct." ...|$|E
500|$|... "John Doe" [...] was co-executive MacLaren's directorial debut. Although she {{had never}} helmed an episode before, MacLaren {{utilized}} information that she had gathered by working with Kim Manners, one of the series' prolific directors. She later noted, [...] "Kim taught me how he breaks down a script and prepares his shot list. The most powerful thing {{he said to me}} was that he imagines the show all cut together and sees the movie in his head and really visualizes it." [...] Gilligan later said that MacLaren [...] "really rose to the occasion and really did her homework." [...] The bus crash scene was created with the use of elaborate [...] "smoke and mirrors", according to Gilligan. Over nine cameras were used to film the entire scene. Several of the cameras were under-cranked in order to give the illusion that the bus was going faster <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> was. A steel ramp was buried in the ground to flip the bus. However, the scene was reportedly torpid to film. Gilligan later joked that [...] "You could have stood there and had a sandwich while the thing was backing up: it was so slow." ...|$|E
500|$|American Pagan studies scholar Aidan A. Kelly {{similarly}} rejected Liddell's claims. Kelly highlighted that whereas Liddell {{had claimed}} that Gardnerian Wicca had adopted {{the concept of}} a female coven leader from French and Scandinavian witch covens, the historical evidence clearly showed that Gardner developed {{the concept of a}} coven being led by a high priestess during the late 1950s, thus disproving Liddell's assertions. He noted that Liddell's claim that Crowley wrote Gardner's Book of Shadows [...] "cannot possibly be true" [...] because Crowley died before the Book was written. Kelly believed that either Liddell or his Elders had purposely created a [...] "phony history" [...] in order {{to hide the fact that}} Gardner had invented Wicca in its entirety in the early 1950s. Similarly, in a 2014 article about Pickingill in The Cauldron, Richard Ward argued that Liddell's claims did not stand up under scrutiny, and that they had simply been made in an attempt to promote claims regarding the existence of a [...] "pre-Gardnerian tradition" [...] of witchcraft. Liddell has specifically denied any charges that he was deliberately falsifying claims to make Gardnerian Wicca appear to have an older pedigree <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> has.|$|E

[...] American band Nirvana covered the song during their first show on 7 March 1987 in Raymond Washington. The cover was only released on the box set With the Lights Out.

500|$|A {{number of}} very large {{unconfirmed}} great white shark specimens have been recorded. For decades, many ichthyological works, {{as well as the}} Guinness Book of World Records, listed two great white sharks as the largest individuals: In the 1870s, a [...] great white captured in southern Australian waters, near Port Fairy, and an [...] shark trapped in a herring weir in New Brunswick, Canada, in the 1930s. However these measurements are not scientific and researchers have questioned the reliability of these measurements for a long time, noting they were much larger than any other accurately reported sighting. Later studies proved these theories correct. This New Brunswick shark may have been a misidentified basking shark, as the two have similar body shapes. The question of the Port Fairy shark was settled in the 1970s when J.E. Randall examined the shark's jaws and [...] "found that the Port Fairy shark was of the order of 5m (17ft) in length and suggested that a mistake had been made in the original record, in 1870, of the shark's length". These wrong measurements would make the alleged shark more than five times heavier <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> was.|$|E
500|$|The austere {{settings}} {{in the game}} came about because testers {{spent too much time}} trying to complete the puzzles using decorative but non-functional elements. As a result, the setting was minimized to make the usable aspects of the puzzle easier to spot, using the clinical feel of the setting in the film The Island as reference. While there were plans for a third area, an office space, to be included after the test chambers and the maintenance areas, the team ran out of time to include it. They also dropped the introduction of the Rat Man, a character who left the messages in the maintenance areas, to avoid creating too much narrative for the game, though the character was developed further in a tie-in comic [...] "Lab Rat", that ties Portal and Portal 2s story together. According to project lead Kim Swift, the final battle with GLaDOS went through many iterations, including having the player chased by James Bond lasers, which was partially applied to the turrets, Portal Kombat where the player would have needed to redirect rockets while avoiding turret fire, and a chase sequence following a fleeing GLaDOS. Eventually, they found that playtesters enjoyed a rather simple puzzle with a countdown timer near the end; Swift noted, [...] "Time pressure makes people think something is a lot more complicated <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> is", and Wolpaw admitted, [...] "It was really cheap to make [...] " [...] in order to simplify the dialogue during the battle.|$|E
