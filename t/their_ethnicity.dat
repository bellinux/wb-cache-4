40|$|ABSTRACT Drawing upon post-structural and post-colonial theories, {{this study}} is an {{investigation}} into the ways in which five classes of first-grade children (six and seven year olds) in Florida and Hawaii talked about <b>their</b> <b>ethnicities</b> in a video pen pal project. The qualitative methods utilized in this research were participant observation, interviews, and videotaping. The resulting analysis notes that the children in the five different schools talked about <b>their</b> <b>ethnicities</b> differently (ethnicity only, hyphenated ethnic-national identity, or national identity only). Four themes emerge from the analysis related to multicultural education, real-life racism, national identity, and shifting subjectivities. Emphasized in the analysis and interpretation is the importance of situating children’s talk about ethnicity within local contexts, acknowledging the multiple and fluid nature of individual subjectivities, and recognizing their location within ideological discourses...|$|R

5|$|Tarnovo was {{captured}} by the Ottomans after a three-month siege in 1393. After the Battle of Nicopolis in 1396 brought about {{the fall of the}} Vidin Tsardom, the Ottomans conquered all Bulgarian lands south of the Danube. The nobility was eliminated and the peasantry was enserfed to Ottoman masters, with much of the educated clergy fleeing to other countries. Under the Ottoman system, Christians were considered an inferior class of people. Thus, Bulgarians, like other Christians, were subjected to heavy taxes and {{a small portion of the}} Bulgarian populace experienced partial or complete Islamisation, and their culture was suppressed. Ottoman authorities established the Rum Millet, a religious administrative community which governed all Orthodox Christians regardless of <b>their</b> <b>ethnicity.</b> Most of the local population gradually lost its distinct national consciousness, identifying as Christians. However, the clergy remaining in some isolated monasteries kept it alive, and that helped it to survive as in some rural, remote areas, as well as in the militant Catholic community in the northwestern part of the country.|$|E
