5|$|The {{verdict was}} treated with scepticism by much of the {{international}} media and the U.S. government of President Jimmy Carter. On 2 February 1978, {{based on the evidence}} given at the inquest, <b>the</b> <b>attorney</b> <b>general</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Eastern Cape stated that he would not prosecute the officers. After the inquest, Biko's family brought a civil case against the state; at the advice of their lawyers, they agreed to a settlement of R65,000 (US$78,000) in July 1979. Shortly after the inquest, the South African Medical and Dental Council initiated proceedings against the medical professionals who had been entrusted with Biko's care; eight years later two of the medics were found guilty of improper conduct. The failure of the government-employed doctors to diagnose or treat Biko's injuries has been frequently cited {{as an example of a}} repressive state influencing medical practitioners' decisions, and Biko's death as evidence of the need for doctors to serve the needs of patients before those of the state.|$|E
