However, the question remains open on whether the different reprogramming methods can influence the pluripotency features of the derived lines.

Moreover, the cardiomyocytes showed functional characteristics including rhythmic beating and marker gene expression. 31002 inhibited the down-regulation of genes related to the three germ layers in the late stage of ESCs differentiation, implying that 31002 supports a continuous fate commitment of undifferentiated ESCs to the cardiac lineage by prolonging the <b>three</b> <b>germ</b> <b>layer</b> stages.

40|$|BACKGROUND: It is {{now well}} {{established}} that various adult somatic tissues harbor multipotent stem cells that can differentiate into a broad variety of cell types of all <b>three</b> <b>germ</b> <b>layer</b> origins. It remains controversial, however, {{whether they are}} a reservoir of cells utilized for emergent tissue repair or simply a vestige of evolution and, if the former is the case, to what extent they can potentially contribute to reconstitution of a specific organ. To get an insight in such a direction, we examined the extent of contribution of naive intact cells of extrahepatic origin to hepatocyte reconstitution in the transplanted liver with or without injury in the rat. METHODS: Liver from wild-type donor rats was transplanted to green fluorescent protein (GFP) -transgenic rats, and GFP-positive hepatocytes were examined with or without liver injury. RESULTS: The proportion of GFP-positive hepatocytes in the transplanted noninjured liver linearly increased by 0. 0048 % per week, that is, approximately 5 x 10 (3) hepatocytes of extrahepatic origin were generated per day. Liver injury induced by treatment with 2 -acetylaminofluorene and CCl 4 or the additional application of hepatocyte growth factor did not further increase the percentage of GFP-positive hepatocytes. CONCLUSION: The present results indicate that cells derived from nonmanipulated extrahepatic tissues appreciably contribute, though limitedly, to hepatocyte reconstitution in the liver of the rat...|$|E
40|$|To {{maximize}} the translational utility of human induced {{pluripotent stem cells}} (iPSCs), the ability to precisely modulate the differentiation of iPSCs to target phenotypes is critical. Although the effects of the physical cell niche on stem cell differentiation are well documented, current approaches to direct step-wise differentiation of iPSCs have been typically limited to the optimization of soluble factors. In this regard, we investigated how temporally varied substrate stiffness affects the step-wise differentiation of iPSCs towards various lineages/phenotypes. Electrospun nanofibrous substrates with different reduced Young's modulus were utilized to subject cells to different mechanical environments during the differentiation process towards representative phenotypes from each of <b>three</b> <b>germ</b> <b>layer</b> derivatives including motor neuron, pancreatic endoderm, and chondrocyte. Phenotype-specific markers of each lineage/stage were utilized to determine differentiation efficiency by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunofluorescence imaging for gene and protein expression analysis, respectively. The results presented in this proof-of-concept study are the first to systematically demonstrate the significant role of the temporally varied mechanical microenvironment on the differentiation of stem cells. Our results demonstrate that the process of differentiation from pluripotent cells to functional end-phenotypes is mechanoresponsive in a lineage- and differentiation stage-specific manner. Lineage/developmental stage-dependent optimization of electrospun substrate stiffness provides a unique opportunity to enhance differentiation efficiency of iPSCs for their facilitated therapeutic applications...|$|E
40|$|Since {{the first}} human {{embryonic}} stem cell (hESC) line was generated by Thomson et al. (in Science 282 : 1145 – 1147, 1998), hundreds of hESC lines have been reported by different labs, providing resources for basic research and regenerative medicine as well. However it has been widely recognized that hESC lines varied on their properties, in terms of gene expression profile, epigenetic modify profile, and differentiation tendency. Generation of more hESC lines will largely enhance our knowledge of hESCs innate character. In this current work, we reported the generation of HN 4, a hESC line derived from grade III IVF human embryo by using a mixture of human foreskin fibroblast (HFF) and mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) as feeder layers, and a whole-mechanical method in inner cell mass (ICM) isolation. HN 4 satisfied the criteria of hESCs pluripotency, with high expression of hESC surface markers (SSEA- 3, SSEA- 4, TRA- 1 - 60, TRA- 1 - 81), transcription factors (OCT- 4, NANOG, REX- 1), and alkaline phosphatase.
