5|$|The {{leaf spring}} {{industry}} has {{its presence in}} Mangalore, with Canara Workshops Ltd. and Lamina Suspension Products Ltd. in the city. The Old Mangalore Port is a fishing port located at Bunder in Mangalore, where {{a large number of}} mechanised boats anchor. The traffic at this port was 122,000 tonnes during the years 2003–04. Fishing is a traditional occupation, and the products are exported to the surrounding regions. Mangalorean firms have a major presence in <b>the</b> <b>tile,</b> beedi, coffee, and cashew nut industry, although <b>the</b> <b>tile</b> industry has declined due to concrete being preferred in modern construction. The Albuquerque tile factory in Mangalore is one of India's oldest red roof tile manufacturing factories. The Ullal suburb of Mangalore produces hosiery and coir yarns, while beedi rolling is an important source of revenue to many in the city.|$|E
5|$|Families {{throughout}} Han China made ritual sacrifices {{of animals}} and food to deities, spirits, and ancestors at temples and shrines, {{in the belief that}} these items could be utilized by those in the spiritual realm. It was thought that each person had a two-part soul: the spirit-soul (hun 魂) which journeyed to the afterlife paradise of immortals (xian), and the body-soul (po 魄) which remained in its grave or tomb on earth and was only reunited with the spirit-soul through a ritual ceremony. These tombs were commonly adorned with uniquely decorated hollow clay tiles that function also as a doorjamb to the tomb. Otherwise known as tomb tiles, these artifacts feature holes in {{the top and bottom of}} <b>the</b> <b>tile</b> allowing it to pivot. Similar tiles have been found in the Chengdu area of Sichuan province in south-central China.|$|E
5|$|Hsin {{wins the}} lottery, but selects <b>the</b> <b>tile</b> {{representing}} his heart. Chao {{comes in and}} tries to persuade one of the game's organisers to let Hsin live but to no avail, causing Chao to knock over {{the table with the}} vases, which reveals the lottery to be fixed. Chao then storms in the room where the surgery on Hsin is about to be carried out and fires at the Hard Faced Man, after which the agents come in and arrest them all, including Chao for covering the existence of the game. They interrogate the Hard Faced Man, but because no one who participated will testify against him, it is unlikely he will be prosecuted. Hsin is brought to the hospital and his daughter is placed on an organ donor list. Chao mysteriously disappears, awakening in a crematorium oven before he is burned alive.|$|E
50|$|Ruth - Ruth's grout job was termed {{incomplete}} {{largely because}} she had used too much mortar to apply <b>the</b> <b>tiles</b> (that resulting from peeling <b>the</b> <b>tiles</b> off and reapplying them in the previous episode). Although a thinset mortar saw was given to her in order {{to clean up the}} mortar that had accumulated between <b>the</b> <b>tiles,</b> <b>the</b> effort to clean up <b>the</b> <b>tiles</b> so that it would be ready for grout far exceeded the time limit.|$|R
50|$|There are 35,960 {{possible}} ways {{to select}} 4 of <b>the</b> 32 <b>tiles</b> when <b>the</b> 32 <b>tiles</b> are considered distinguishable. However, there are 3620 distinct sets of 4 <b>tiles</b> when <b>the</b> <b>tiles</b> {{of a pair}} are considered indistinguishable. There are 496 ways to select 2 of <b>the</b> 32 <b>tiles</b> when <b>the</b> 32 <b>tiles</b> are considered distinguishable. There are 136 distinct hands (pairs of <b>tiles)</b> when <b>the</b> <b>tiles</b> of a pair are considered indistinguishable.|$|R
50|$|The usual rule is {{that you}} are allowed to look through all <b>the</b> <b>tiles</b> in <b>the</b> discard stacks to your right (<b>the</b> <b>tiles</b> you discarded) and to your left (<b>the</b> <b>tiles</b> you had an {{opportunity}} to take), but you can only see <b>the</b> exposed top <b>tiles</b> of <b>the</b> two discard stacks {{on the other side of}} the table.|$|R
5|$|The {{architectural}} {{style of the}} main building {{is a combination of}} Southern German and local Arabic. <b>The</b> <b>tile</b> roof and onion-dome tower mounted on a square base reflects the former, while wide, rounded arches for doors and windows reflect the latter. A lightning rod extends from the onion dome. The H-shaped main building has two interior courtyards which held a water cistern, garden and play area. The entire building covers an area of 50,590 square feet (4,700 square meters). At three stories, the main building housed the central dining room, a kitchen, a study hall, a library, a reading room, a small museum, and a Lutheran church in which students and staff worshipped.|$|E
25|$|When two or {{more players}} call for a {{discarded}} tile, a player taking <b>the</b> <b>tile</b> to win the hand has precedence over all others. Otherwise a player who can form a Pong or Kong takes precedence over a player who claims a Chow. Players may only call for a Chow from the discard of the player immediately prior to them, unless <b>the</b> <b>tile</b> is the final one required to complete the hand, but may call for a Pong or Kong from any player. A player may also take <b>the</b> <b>tile</b> to win the hand from any other player.|$|E
25|$|Step: <b>The</b> <b>tile</b> {{general and}} sword soldier can move one square diagonally forward or orthogonally backward.|$|E
40|$|An {{assembly}} of {{a plurality of}} tiles (1) with a carrier (40), wherein <b>the</b> <b>tiles</b> (1) comprise a foil (20) with an electro-physical transducer (10) and electrical connectors (24, 28) to said transducer. <b>The</b> <b>tiles</b> are mechanically and electrically coupled to the carrier, and <b>the</b> <b>tiles</b> overlay according to a fish scale pattern...|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: The {{matching}} pair of eights (left) {{is worth}} more than the non-matching pair of eights (right). If a hand contained one of <b>the</b> <b>tiles</b> on <b>the</b> left and one of <b>the</b> <b>tiles</b> on <b>the</b> right, these would not form a pair at all, since <b>the</b> <b>tiles</b> that make pairs are defined by tradition.|$|R
50|$|The {{components}} of the game have varied over the years. In particular, <b>the</b> <b>tiles</b> have been made from wood, plastic, and cardboard in various editions of the game. In the 2008 version, <b>the</b> <b>tiles</b> were cardboard. In the 2016 version, <b>the</b> <b>tiles</b> are plastic, but the board size was reduced, from 9x12 to 10x10.|$|R
25|$|Step: <b>The</b> <b>tile</b> chariot {{can move}} one square diagonally {{forward to the}} right or diagonally {{backward}} to the left.|$|E
25|$|Alternatively, {{a player}} may also win by drawing <b>the</b> <b>tile</b> {{required}} to complete a legal hand on his turn. This usually results in more points scored than if the player were to use another player's discard.|$|E
25|$|At {{about this}} time, the Orbiter shed a Thermal Protection System tile, the most {{westerly}} piece of debris {{that has been}} recovered. Searchers found <b>the</b> <b>tile</b> in a field in Littlefield, Texas, just northwest of Lubbock.|$|E
40|$|A thermal {{protection}} tile for earth-to-orbit transports is described. <b>The</b> <b>tiles</b> {{consist of a}} rigid external shell filled with a flexible insulation. <b>The</b> <b>tiles</b> tend to be thicker than the current Shuttle rigidized silica <b>tiles</b> for <b>the</b> same entry heat load but are projected to be more durable and lighter. <b>The</b> <b>tiles</b> were thermally tested for several simulated entry trajectories...|$|R
50|$|In {{the course}} of the film, {{evidence}} is presented that a reclusive Philadelphia resident, Severino “Sevy” Verna, was responsible for <b>the</b> <b>tiles.</b> <b>The</b> filmmakers claim that Verna began by broadcasting a message via short wave radio about his theories before later beginning to place <b>the</b> <b>tiles,</b> at times {{through a hole in the}} floor of his car. Previous research had identified a Philadelphia carpenter, James Morasco, as the likely placer of <b>the</b> <b>tiles.</b> <b>The</b> filmmakers believe the name was an alias used by Verna.|$|R
5000|$|At {{least one}} of <b>the</b> two <b>tiles</b> must connect to <b>the</b> palago (<b>the</b> <b>tiles</b> already played).|$|R
25|$|Campana reliefs can be {{arranged}} on five bases: chronology, geography, iconography, shape and use. The most productive system is classification based on the shape of <b>the</b> <b>tile.</b> The categories used are cladding tiles, ridge tiles, sima tiles, crowning tiles and antefixes.|$|E
25|$|The steel {{comprises}} a {{galvanised steel}} core, with a multi-layered protective coating and granular finish for better performance characteristics. <b>The</b> <b>tile</b> is in three satin finishes and a high-gloss silver {{and can be}} transported in situ in a building's roof.|$|E
25|$|This {{is part of}} a {{five million}} dollar project, as well as other things such as {{upgrading}} to a better announcement sound-system, replacing <b>the</b> <b>tile</b> in the tunnel connecting platforms, and adding departure LED screens on platforms and in the station tunnel.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Different {{stages of}} {{applying}} plaster to <b>the</b> roof <b>tiles.</b> <b>The</b> plaster protects the roof from water ingress, and stops <b>the</b> <b>tiles</b> being dislodged by typhoon winds.|$|R
50|$|Ignoring the wavy {{borders of}} <b>the</b> <b>tiles,</b> <b>the</b> {{pavement}} is pgg.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: A children's puzzle which {{illustrates}} {{the mobility of}} holes in an atomic lattice. <b>The</b> <b>tiles</b> are analogous to electrons, while <b>the</b> missing <b>tile</b> (lower right corner) is analogous to a hole. Just as the position of <b>the</b> missing <b>tile</b> can be moved to different locations by moving <b>the</b> <b>tiles,</b> a hole in a crystal lattice can move to different positions in the lattice by {{the motion of the}} surrounding electrons.|$|R
25|$|When {{a player}} {{discards}} a tile, other players may steal <b>the</b> <b>tile</b> {{to complete a}} meld. Stealing tiles has both advantages (quickly forming a winning hand and scoring extra points) and disadvantages such as revealing part of one's hand to other players {{and not being able}} to change the meld once declared.|$|E
25|$|According to this, {{the length}} of the {{hypotenuse}} of a right angled triangle in discretized space is always equal to {{the length of}} one of the two sides, in contradiction to geometry. Jean Paul Van Bendegem has argued that <b>the</b> <b>Tile</b> Argument can be resolved, and that discretization can therefore remove the paradox.|$|E
25|$|Wanaka has {{a line of}} tiles {{mounted on}} the {{sidewalk}} by the lake listing important world and New Zealand historic events. The 1903 tile says that the first powered flight in history occurred in Timaru, and {{at the bottom of}} <b>the</b> <b>tile</b> for 1903 the Wright Brothers were listed as having also flown that year.|$|E
40|$|An {{elevated}} waterproof {{access floor}} system having subfloor channels or compartments for power lines, gas lines {{or the like}} is adapted such {{that it can be}} opened and subsequently resealed without destroying the waterproofing and without destroying its aesthetic appearance. A multiplicity of tiles are supported on a support grid, and a flooring sheet is supported on <b>the</b> <b>tiles.</b> Attachment means are provided to prevent lateral but not vertical movement of the flooring sheet with respect to <b>the</b> <b>tiles</b> so that <b>the</b> flooring sheet can be lifted off <b>the</b> <b>tiles,</b> but when <b>the</b> flooring sheet is supported on <b>the</b> <b>tiles,</b> no lateral slipping will occur. The flooring sheet is made of a heat resealable material, {{so that it can be}} cut away in sections, and <b>the</b> <b>tiles</b> therebelow lifted off, to provide access to subfloor compartments...|$|R
25|$|In April 2005, at the Conference of Philomenian Studies – 1805-2005, {{findings}} of a {{study carried out on}} <b>the</b> <b>tiles</b> by <b>the</b> Opificio delle Pietre Dure e Laboratori di Restauro (Factory of Hard Stones and Restoration Laboratories) of Florence were made public. The analysis confirmed that only one type of mortal lime could be found on <b>the</b> <b>tiles,</b> thus giving a strong support to the theory that <b>the</b> <b>tiles</b> had not been re-arranged.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>tiles</b> {{were not}} {{mechanically}} {{fastened to the}} vehicle, but glued. Since <b>the</b> brittle <b>tiles</b> could not flex with the underlying vehicle skin, they were glued to Nomex felt Strain Isolation Pads (SIPs) with RTV silicone adhesive, which were in turn glued to the orbiter skin. These isolated <b>the</b> <b>tiles</b> from <b>the</b> orbiter's structural deflections and expansions.|$|R
25|$|After the Great Harem Fire of 1666, {{the hall}} was renovated in the rococo style {{during the reign of}} Sultan Osman III. <b>The</b> <b>tile</b> belt {{surrounding}} the walls bearing calligraphic inscriptions were revetted with 18th-century blue-and-white Delftware and mirrors of Venetian glass. But the domed arch and pendantives still bear classical paintings dating from the original construction.|$|E
25|$|Tiles are {{generally}} named after their two values; e.g. deuce-five or five-deuce (2–5 or 5–2) are {{alternative ways of}} describing <b>the</b> <b>tile</b> with the values two and five. Tiles that have the same value on both ends are called doubles, and are typically referred to as double-zero, double-one, etc. Tiles with two different values are called singles.|$|E
25|$|Apart from <b>the</b> <b>tile</b> of {{the shells}} {{and the glass}} curtain walls of the foyer spaces, the building's {{exterior}} is largely clad with aggregate panels composed of pink granite quarried at Tarana. Significant interior surface treatments also include off-form concrete, Australian white birch plywood supplied from Wauchope in northern New South Wales, and brush box glulam.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>tiles</b> <b>the</b> {{foreground}} fisherman {{stands on}} have a vanishing point that converge towards the viewer.|$|R
5000|$|One classroom, {{which had}} a [...] "Do Not Enter" [...] sign on the door, was {{recorded}} by the I-Team. The video showed several floor tiles missing and asbestos where <b>the</b> <b>tiles</b> had once been. <b>The</b> <b>tiles</b> began to come up around September or October after water leaked from the ceiling and got under <b>the</b> <b>tiles.</b> After four to five months of complaints being sent to administration, the teacher and students were finally moved to a vacant classroom.|$|R
50|$|Some players use <b>the</b> exposed <b>tile</b> as <b>the</b> last <b>tile</b> to {{be drawn}} from the centre, when all <b>the</b> other <b>tiles</b> have been taken.|$|R
