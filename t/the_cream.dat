5|$|Boddingtons Brewery was a {{regional}} brewery in Manchester, England, which owned pubs throughout the North West. Boddingtons {{was best known}} for Boddingtons Bitter (Boddies), a straw-golden, hoppy bitter {{which was one of}} the first beers to be packaged in cans containing a widget, giving it a creamy draught-style head. In the 1990s, the beer was promoted as <b>The</b> <b>Cream</b> of Manchester in a popular advertising campaign credited with raising Manchester's profile. Boddingtons became one of the city's most famous products after Manchester United and Coronation Street.|$|E

The American heiress Margaret Lanier Cravens (1881–1912) became a patron; after knowing him {{a short time}} she offered a large annual sum {{to allow him to}} focus on his work. Cravens killed herself in 1912, after the pianist Walter Rummel, long the object of her affection, married someone else. She may also have been discouraged by Pound's engagement to Dorothy.|$|E

40|$|In this ever-advancing global world, {{people are}} mindful to beauty and well-being. As a result, the {{market share of}} beauty {{products}} is increasing radically. Therefore, several skin-lightening products are commercially on hand to get lighter skin tone. Clinically, such creams are prescribed to treat hyper pigmentation disorders [1]. Even in the cosmetics market, numerous functional products such as those developed for skin moisturizing, skin whitening, wrinkle care and anti-ageing have been launched. The misleading advertisements and irrational use of such creams often leads to adverse consequences to human skin. For that reason, {{the aim of this}} study was to assess the depigmenting efficacy of branded skin-lightening creams in-vivo (human). Owing to this, four branded creams were used, coded as P- 1, P- 2, P- 3 and P- 4. Prior to in-vivo evaluation, physicochemical characterization and in-vitro stability studies of all <b>the</b> <b>creams</b> were performed to ensure the quality of <b>the</b> <b>creams.</b> In-vivo evaluation of <b>the</b> <b>creams</b> was carried out in 36 healthy human volunteers. The volunteers were screened for any reaction to cream using patch test (Burchard test). <b>The</b> <b>creams</b> were applied on cheeks twice a day for 8 weeks. The skin measurements for melanin, erythema, sebum content and trans epidermal water loss (TEWL) were recorded using mexameter, sebumeter and tewameter respectively. In addition, increase in skin moisture content was measured using corneometer. The measurements were taken at the end of week 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 8. Lastly, panel test was conducted to assess the volunteers’ sensory evaluation of <b>the</b> <b>creams.</b> <b>The</b> results of physicochemical characterization and stability analyses recommended that <b>the</b> <b>creams</b> were suitable for skin application at room temperature.

While for the sigmoid BS pattern, kinetics with two terms, is adequate to describe <b>the</b> <b>creaming</b> process in contrast to kinetics previously reported in the literature.

The present multicentre randomized double-blind controlled trial showed a barrier-improving cream (5 % urea) to be superior to a reference cream in preventing eczema relapse in patients with AD (hazard ratio 0. 634, p = 0. 011).

25|$|Upon {{standing}} for 12 to 24 hours, fresh milk {{has a tendency}} to separate into a high-fat cream layer on top of a larger, low-fat milk layer. <b>The</b> <b>cream</b> often is sold as a separate product with its own uses. Today the separation of <b>the</b> <b>cream</b> from the milk usually is accomplished rapidly in centrifugal cream separators. The fat globules rise {{to the top of a}} container of milk because fat is less dense than water. The smaller the globules, the more other molecular-level forces prevent this from happening. In fact, <b>the</b> <b>cream</b> rises in cow's milk much more quickly than a simple model would predict: rather than isolated globules, the fat in the milk tends to form into clusters containing about a million globules, held together by a number of minor whey proteins. These clusters rise faster than individual globules can. The fat globules in milk from goats, sheep, and water buffalo do not form clusters as readily and are smaller to begin with, resulting in a slower separation of cream from these milks.|$|E

In the paper experimental measurement and numerical modeling of <b>the</b> <b>creaming</b> of mPCM slurry is presented.

40|$|International audienceAbstractRecombined low-fat dairy cream (RLFDC) {{primarily}} comprises anhydrous {{milk fat}} and milk protein. The primary advantage of RLFDC is that its ingredients can be easily stored and transported, whereas its most notable disadvantage is poor stability. The effects of glycerol monostearate (GMS) or sorbitan monooleate ethoxylate (Tween 80) on the physical properties and stability of RLFDC (20 % fat and 2 % protein) were investigated in this study. Physical properties were evaluated according to droplet size, surface protein concentration, ζ-potential, and apparent viscosity; stability was assessed according to creaming rate. Results showed that GMS and Tween 80 could significantly increase <b>the</b> <b>creaming</b> stability of RLFDC compared with a control sample. <b>The</b> <b>creaming</b> stability of RLFDC with GMS highly depended on ζ-potential and apparent viscosity, which contributed to electrostatic repulsion and intermolecular resistance.
