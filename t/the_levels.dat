5|$|In 1723, the Commissioners of the Kent and Sussex Rother Levels {{employed}} the civil engineering contractor John Reynolds to make repairs to Scots Float Sluice, a timber {{lock on the}} lower river.

Reynolds carried out further work on the sluice in 1729, and in 1732 reconstructed it to provide an extra outlet.

Unlike the previous game, Keen can not shoot enemies with a raygun; instead he collects small pellets throughout <b>the</b> <b>levels</b> called flower power to throw at enemies. If an enemy is hit, they transform into a passive, intangible flower for a limited time, while pellets that do not hit an enemy can be retrieved by the player.
