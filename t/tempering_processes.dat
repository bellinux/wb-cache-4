In the visible spectrum, this glow increases in brightness as temperature increases, and when cherry-red the glow is near its lowest intensity and may not be visible in ambient light. Therefore, blacksmiths usually austenize steel in low-light conditions, to help accurately judge the color of the glow.|$|E

In addition, the influence of new heat treatment temperature on impact and tensile properties is analyzed. Ductile iron produced by CO 2 sand casting method was heat treated by new heat treatment cycle that comprised combination of modified annealing, austenitizing and <b>tempering</b> <b>processes.</b> The new heat treatment process performed was divided into three stages: first stage consists of modified annealing (as-annealed condition); second stage consists of modified annealing and austenitizing processes (as-austenitized condition); and third stage consists of modified annealing, austenitizing and <b>tempering</b> <b>processes</b> (as-tempered condition). A series of microstructure analysis tests, including optical microscopy, X-ray diffractometry, and scanning electron microscopy equipped with energy dispersive X-ray, was applied. Mechanical tests including tensile (ASTM E 8 M), impact toughness (ASTM-E 23 - 1990) and Vickers hardness test were performed. The results suggest that heat treatment temperature influences the matrix and volume fraction of each phase of ductile iron. Annealing included in new heat treatment process does influence the hardness of ductile iron. Moreover, microstructure constituents have good correlation with mechanical properties. It is proven that, hardness could be estimated using mixture law of hardness for each microstructure constituent. Tensile strength and hardness of ductile iron decrease with decreasing volume fraction of martensite. Increasing ferrite volume fraction results an increasing impact toughness and elongation.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Moisture content {{patterns}} inside rice kernels {{are important}} in understanding rice fissure formation, especially when glass transition effects are considered. Unsteady and non–linear partial differential equations were employed to describe two–dimensional temperature and moisture distributions within a single rice kernel during drying and <b>tempering</b> <b>processes.</b> Moisture content gradients (MCGs) inside the kernel were examined.

The intra–kernel MCG decreased considerably during the first 40 min of tempering, after which it decreased slowly to approach zero. A duration of about 40 min of tempering at 60 C helped eliminate about 90 % of the MCGs created inside the rice kernel during drying, and this simulation result correlated favorably with the published tempering data in the literature.

In this study, the effect of this method (drying-tempering) and continuous drying method (no tempering) on fissuring percentage of Hashemi (long grain) and Koohsar (medium grain) varieties was investigated. The experiments were carried out at constant drying and tempering temperature of 60 °C, drying durations of 20, 40 and 60 min, and tempering durations of 0 (continuous drying), 40, 80, 120, 160, 200, 240 min.

In {{order to reduce the}} potential for injury with such glasses, glass manufacturers adapted thermal <b>tempering</b> <b>processes</b> to produce tempered (also referred to as toughened) pint glasses. Tempered glass is known for its dense fracture properties and {{is considered to be a}} safer alternative to non-tempered (annealed) glass. Tempered pint glasses are now widely used throughout the UK. However, there is no standard which regulates the quality of tempered drinking glasses. This lack of standardisation has been identified as a cause for varying effectiveness of using tempered drinking glasses to reduce injury potential. This thesis aimed to examine the injury potential of pint glasses and to provide a foundation for a future standard for tempered drinking glasses. The work included: examination of the fracture properties of annealed and tempered drinking glasses; replication and analysis of physical attacks with pint glasses; and assessments into the sharpness of various glass fragments as an indicator of injury potential. The base region of tempered pint glasses was found to fracture extensively, limiting certain methods of glass attacks. Fragments from the near-rim region were found to vary significantly in size between glasses due to lower wall thicknesses and residual stress. Replications of glassing attacks indicated high forces are involved with such attacks, although the damage severity is lessened with tempered glasses. Sharpness assessments revealed little significant change in fragment sharpness due to tempering. This suggests that changes in injury potential are more likely due to practical considerations such as reduced fragment size, rather than a change in inherent sharpness properties...|$|E
40|$|High {{economical}} efficiency {{obtained by}} utilizing prehardened mould steels in plastic mould making {{has increased the}} usage {{of these types of}} steels to a great extent. Generally, prehardened mould steels are applied for large moulds and moulds for moderate production runs, and {{one of the advantages of}} using this type of steel is that no heat treatment is necessary for putting the mould in use. Today, around 80 percent of the mould steels are produced in prehardened condition which is typically ~ 40 HRC. This hardness limit is required for providing both high hardness and machinability which are of the most important demands upon mould steels. In addition to these properties, a superior polishability, nitriding stability, weldability toughness, corrosion resistance and thermal conductivity are wanted by either moulders or mould makers. Among these properties, machinability is extremely important because of its direct influence on cost of the mould and consequently the plastic part. The machining expenses accounts for more than 60 percent of the total cost of a mould. Hence, improving the machinability in prehardened mould steels has been the concern of tool steel suppliers. In this thesis work, the focus is laid on metallurgical aspects of machinability of prehardened mould steels. Therefore, the machinability of different types of prehardened mould steels is investigated with respect to milling and drilling operations which are the most frequently used machining operations in mould production. In order to understand the metallurgical reason for machinability differences, detailed studies are performed on two steel grades, Uddeholm Nimax and Impax HH. Thorough microstructure characterization is complemented by examining the machinability of the materials in terms of cutting temperature, cutting force and tool life. The materials have shown very different properties in different machining operations and their machinability varies greatly depending on the cutting condition and machining operation type. Comparing the two deeply studied steel grades, Uddeholm Nimax with bainitic structure is benefitted with higher machinability and possesses superior impact toughness and ductility which are important properties for plastic mould steels.

40|$|There are {{commercial}} and military applications {{in which a}} material needs {{to serve as a}} barrier that must subsequently be removed. In many cases it is desirable that once the barrier has served its function that it then be reduced to small pieces. For example, in pipelines and in downhole drilling applications, valves are needed to function as barriers that can sustain high pressures. Later the valves must be removed and essentially disappear or be rendered to such a small size that they do not interfere with the functioning of other equipment. Military applications include covers on missile silos or launch vehicles. Other applications might require that a component be used once as an actuator or for passive energy storage, and then be irreversibly removed, again so as not to interfere with the function or motion of other parts of the device. Brittle materials, especially those that are very strong, or are pre-stressed, are ideal candidates for these applications. Stressed glass can be produced in different sizes and shapes and the level of strength and pre-stress, both of which control the fragmentation, can be manipulated by varying the processing. Stressed glass can be engineered to fracture predictably at a specific stress level. Controlling the central tension allows the fragment size to be specified. The energy that is stored in the residual stress profile that results from ion exchange or thermal <b>tempering</b> <b>processes</b> can be harnessed to drive fragmentation of the component once it has been deliberately fractured. Energy can also be stored in the glass by mechanical loading. Energy from both of these sources can be released either to perform useful work or to initiate another reaction. Once the stressed glass {{has been used as a}} barrier or actuator it can never be ''used'' again because it fragments into many small unrecognizable pieces during the actuation. Under some circumstances it will interfere with the motion or functioning of other parts of a device. Our approach was to use stressed glass to develop capabilities for making components that can be used as barriers, as actuating devices that passively store energy, or as a mechanical weaklink that is destroyed by some critical shock or crush load. The objective of this project was to develop one or more prototype devices using stressed glass technology and demonstrate their potential for applications of interest.

50|$|Tempered {{hardboard}} is hardboard {{that has}} been coated with a thin film of linseed oil and then baked; this gives it more water resistance, impact resistance, hardness, rigidity and tensile strength. An earlier <b>tempering</b> <b>process</b> involved immersing the board in linseed oil or tung oil until it was 5 to 6 percent saturated, and heating to 170 °C (340 °F). Tempered hardboard is used in construction siding.|$|R
40|$|The {{invention}} {{describes a}} method for structuring a flat substrate composed of glass-type material {{in the course of}} a viscous flow process, in which the glass-type flat substrate is joined to a surface of a flat substrate, preferably a semiconductor flat substrate, which has at least one depression bounded by a circumferential edge located in the surface and, {{in the course of a}} subsequent <b>tempering</b> <b>process,</b> is changed to a viscous pre-flowing state, in which at least proportions of the free-flowing glass-type material of the flat substrate flow over the circumferential edge into the depression in the flat substrate. The invention is characterized in that a flat substrate is provided of which the at least one depression has at least one wetting surface that is countersunk with respect to the surface of the flat substrate and is at least partly bounded by a line-type edge which, at the same time, is an edge of a trench structure provided within the depression and countersunk with respect to the wetting surface and/or is determined by a discontinuous change in a wetting property for the free-flowing glass-type material that could be assigned to the wetting surface, in that, during the <b>tempering</b> <b>process,</b> the free-flowing glass-type material is brought into contact with the wetting surface in such a way that a wetting front forms along the line-type edge, and in that the <b>tempering</b> <b>process</b> is ended with the formation of a surface of the glass-type material that extends between the wetting front and the circumferential edge without contact with the flat substrate and that encloses a cavity with a sub-region of the depression...|$|R
40|$|A <b>tempered</b> Hermite <b>process</b> modifies {{the power}} law kernel {{in the time}} domain {{representation}} of a Hermite process by multiplying an exponential tempering factor λ> 0 such that the process is well defined for Hurst parameter H> 1 / 2. A <b>tempered</b> Hermite <b>process</b> is the weak convergence limit of a certain discrete chaos process.
