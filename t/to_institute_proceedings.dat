5|$|The High Court {{rejected}} the plaintiffs' argument that, by compulsorily acquiring a temple, the Government was limiting a person's right under Article 15(1) of the Constitution to profess, practice and propagate {{his or her}} religion, and that this in turn gave him or her {{the legal right to}} commence an action on the ground that where an individual's constitutional rights are affected, he or she has a sufficient interest to ensure that his or her rights are protected. The court ruling held that this land acquisition matter was not in any way related to religious freedom. Because the acquisition was not related to religious freedom, the High Court found that only the trustees who were the legal owners of the temple property had the requisite locus standi <b>to</b> <b>institute</b> <b>proceedings</b> if they deemed their rights to have been infringed.|$|E

Here {{was a member of}} a band of bloody ruffians,--and perhaps he had companions,--who had sworn vengeance against her and her faithful servant, and Cheditafa's account of this man convinced her that he would be ready enough to carry out such vengeance. She scarcely believed that the police had caught him. For she had seen how he could run, and he had the start of them. But even if they had, on what charge would he be held? He ought to be confined or deported, but she did not wish <b>to</b> <b>institute</b> <b>proceedings</b> and give evidence. She did not know what might be asked, or said, or done, if she deposed that the man was a member of the Rackbird band, and brought Cheditafa as a witness.|$|E

60|$|It was at last {{arranged}} {{that the}} five clergymen selected should meet at Dr. Tempest's house in Silverbridge to make inquiry and {{report to the}} bishop whether the circumstances connected with the cheque for twenty pounds were of such a nature as to make it incumbent on him <b>to</b> <b>institute</b> <b>proceedings</b> against Mr. Crawley in the Court of Arches. Dr. Tempest had acted upon the letter which he had received from the bishop, exactly as though {{there had been no}} meeting at the palace, no quarrel to the death between him and Mrs. Proudie. He was a prudent man, gifted with the great power of holding his tongue, and had not spoken a word, even to his wife, of what had occurred. After such a victory our old friend the archdeacon would have blown his own trumpet loudly among his friends. Plumstead would have heard of it instantly, and the pæan would have been sung out in the neighbouring parishes of Eiderdown, Stogpingum, and St. Ewolds. The high-street of Barchester would have known of it, and the very bedesmen in Hiram's Hospital would have told among themselves the terrible discomfiture of the bishop and his lady. But Dr. Tempest spoke no word of it to anybody. He wrote letters to the two clergymen named by the bishop, and himself selected two others out of his own rural deanery, and suggested to them all a day at which a preliminary meeting should be held at his own house. The two who were invited by him were Mr. Oriel, the rector of Greshamsbury, and Mr. Robarts, the vicar of Framley. They all assented to the proposition, and on the day named assembled themselves at Silverbridge.|$|E

5000|$|The {{next day}} the [...] "Libre Parole" [...] publicized the secret arrest of an {{individual}} suspected of espionage. Other newspapers were more precise; days later, on November 1, the anti-Semitic newspaper founded by Edouard Drumont announced the arrest of [...] "the Jewish officer A.

[...] All this was very awkward for General Mercier. It {{was too late to}} drop the case; he would have risked his position as a minister. He summoned a council of ministers, and, without revealing any other charge than that concerning the bordereau, declared that the documents mentioned in the memorandum could have been procured by only Dreyfus. The ministers, most of whom were hearing the story for the first time, unanimously decided <b>to</b> <b>institute</b> <b>proceedings.</b> The papers were made over to the governor of Paris, who gave the order to investigate.|$|E
50|$|Returning to Fiecht in 1800, {{he taught}} Biblical exegesis and was ordained priest in 1801; {{late in the}} same year he was {{appointed}} master of novices, in 1802 professor of Christian ethics and in 1803 of ecclesiastical history. A number of theses which he published in 1803 aroused the suspicions of the ecclesiastical authorities of the Diocese of Brixen. The Abbot of Fiecht was sharply rebuked for permitting Feilmoser to teach what was considered unsound doctrine. In 1804 appeared Feilmoser's Animadversiones in historiam ecclesiasticam, which did not meet the approval of the diocesan authorities, who threatened, in case Feilmoser did not desist from advancing dangerous opinions, <b>to</b> <b>institute</b> <b>proceedings</b> against the abbot. To Feilmoser's request for a specification of the objectionable passages in his writings no reply was made, but the entire matter was reported to the emperor in Vienna. An investigation instituted by order of the emperor resulted favourably for Feilmoser. He was, nevertheless, removed from the office of master of novices and in 1806 was made assistant in the parish of Achenthal.|$|E

5000|$|In May 2011, Pryce {{stated that}} she was aware that Huhne had [...] "pressured people to take his driving licence penalty points". Huhne emphatically denied these {{allegations}} of perverting the course of justice, contrary to common law. Labour MP Simon Danczuk made a criminal complaint to Essex Police in respect of the allegations. The main question of fact, as alleged in the charge, was whether Huhne had caused Pryce to accept three penalty points which he had allegedly incurred while driving his BMW car through a speed camera between Stansted Airport and London {{on the evening of}} 12 March 2003. During interviews with Essex Police, Huhne exercised his right to remain silent. A decision on whether <b>to</b> <b>institute</b> <b>proceedings</b> for the alleged offences was delayed for eight months while the Sunday Times made an application for judicial review of an order of the Crown Court at Chelmsford that the Crown Prosecution Service had obtained, which obliged the newspaper to disclose e-mails between Pyrce and its political editor, Isabel Oakeshott, in which the case was discussed. The application was withdrawn on 20 January 2012. In December 2011, newspapers including The Daily Express reported that Essex Police had recommended to the CPS that both Huhne and Pryce ought to be prosecuted for the alleged offences.|$|E
5000|$|Unlike to Clausen’s rationalism, Eiríksson {{was very}} {{critical}} to H. L. Martensen’s speculative theology, which he violently attacked in various publications from 1844 to 1850. His basic {{point was that}} faith was based on reason, and “only that which can be accepted by reason {{can and should be}} accepted by faith”. Martensen refused to become involved in polemic with Eiríksson, and remained completely silent. This silence so irritated Eiríksson that in 1847 he wrote a letter to King Christian VII denouncing Martensen’s silence as “inexcusable, dishonest and dishonorable” [...] and demanding that Martensen be relieved of his professorship at Copenhagen University. His accusations against Martensen were violent and uncontrolled, {{but at the same time}} he also attacked the Government’s alleged absolutism. As a result, the public prosecutor was ordered <b>to</b> <b>institute</b> <b>proceedings</b> against him. With the king’s death in 1848, however, and the general amnesty which accompanied his successor, Frederik VII’s, accession to the throne, these were dropped.Eiríksson’s attack on Martensen harmed himself most, particularly financially, as the students, in sympathy with their famous professor, stopped using Eiríksson as a tutor. His financial situation became particularly bad, and he (at least) twice wrote to Søren Kierkegaard asking for help, but Kierkegaard refused.|$|E
5000|$|He was rector of St. Saviour's, Norwich, {{and when}} Count Gondomar arrived in England to settle {{preliminaries}} for the Spanish Match, he published in 1620 an anonymous tract against the proposed marriage. It was entitled Vox Populi, and purported {{to give an}} account of Gondomar's reception by the council of state upon his return to Madrid in 1618. The ambassador is there made to explain his schemes for bringing England into subjection to Spain, to describe with satisfaction the crowds which went to assist at mass in his chapel in London, and to recount how he had won over the leading courtiers by his bribes. The whole story was a fabrication, but {{at the time it was}} widely received as a piece of genuine history, and caused a furore. John Chamberlain on 3 February 1621 informed Sir Dudley Carleton that 'the author of [...] "Vox Populi" [...] is discovered to be one Scot, a minister, bewrayed by the printer, who thereby hath saved himself, and got his pardon, though the book were printed beyond sea'. Joseph Mead, writing on 10 February 1621, told Sir Martin Stuteville that 'Scot of Norwich, who is said to be the author of [...] "Vox Populi," [...] they say is now fled, having, as it seems, fore-notice of the pursuivant'. In Vox Regis (1624) Scott gave in biblical language an account of the motives which induced him to write Vox Populi, and the consequences of that publication to himself. Vox Populi was suppressed by royal authority, and Samuel Harsnett, bishop of Norwich, was commanded <b>to</b> <b>institute</b> <b>proceedings</b> against him.|$|E
