25|$|Favoring {{the worst}} off could be {{accomplished}} by favoring <b>the</b> <b>sickest</b> first or by favoring the youngest first.

Also, a different patient could become equally <b>sick</b> in <b>the</b> future. Favoring the youngest saves the most years of life, but a twenty-year-old has a more developed personality than an infant.|$|R
