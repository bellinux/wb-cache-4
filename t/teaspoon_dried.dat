50|$|Fresh thyme is {{commonly}} sold in bunches of sprigs. A sprig {{is a single}} stem snipped from the plant. It is composed of a woody stem with paired leaf or flower clusters ("leaves") spaced 1/2 to 1 in apart. A recipe may measure thyme by the bunch (or fraction thereof), or by the sprig, or by the tablespoon or <b>teaspoon.</b> <b>Dried</b> thyme is widely used in Armenia in tisanes (called urc).|$|E
50|$|When {{the planes}} {{had left the}} Japanese served the {{prisoner}}s their first meal since leaving Manila two days before: two <b>teaspoons</b> of <b>dry,</b> raw rice. There was only one faucet from which the water trickled out so slowly that a prisoner was lucky if he managed one drink every 18 hours. Roll call was taken each morning. Those that had died during the night were buried in an improvised cemetery next to the seawall. After four days at Subic, only 450 survived the makeshift prison; they were subsequently sent to the labor camps in Japan.|$|R
50|$|German {{chamomile}} {{is used in}} {{herbal medicine}} for a sore stomach, irritable bowel syndrome, and as a gentle sleep aid. It is also used as a mild laxative and is anti-inflammatory and bactericidal. It can be taken as an herbal tea, two <b>teaspoons</b> of <b>dried</b> flower per cup of tea, which should be steeped for 10 to 15 minutes while covered to avoid evaporation of the volatile oils. The marc should be pressed because {{of the formation of}} a new active principle inside the cells, which can then be released by rupturing the cell walls, though this substance only forms very close to boiling point. For a sore stomach, some recommend taking a cup every morning without food for two to three months.|$|R
50|$|If {{a recipe}} {{calls for a}} level <b>teaspoon</b> of a <b>dry</b> {{ingredient}} (salt, flour, etc.), this refers to an approximately leveled filling of the spoon, producing the same volume as for liquids. A rounded teaspoon is a larger but less precise measure, produced without leveling the ingredient off or heaping it as high as possible. A heaping or heaped teaspoon is a larger inexact measure consisting of the amount obtained by scooping the dry ingredient up without leveling it off. For some ingredients, e.g. flour, this quantity can vary considerably.|$|R

Mint jelly is a popular preparation. To make mint tea, pour boiling water over a scant <b>teaspoon</b> full of <b>dried</b> leaves, or over 1/3 cup fresh leaves. Iced tea is also a treat. Mint leaf candy can also be made. First nations people use mint tea to remedy bad breath or toothache, or to cure hiccups. The mint can also be used for fox or lynx bait.|$|R
5000|$|Artemisia californica, {{leaves and}} stems are {{collected}} {{and put into}} a cloth sack. The patient sleeps with this sack for one week. During this time, meat must not be eaten. The sagebrush leaves are measured {{in the palm of}} the hand. About a half <b>teaspoon</b> of the <b>dried</b> leaves from the sack are mixed with 300 ml of water and allowed to sit in the sun for 2 hours. This is heated with a stick of cinnamon (Cinnamomum species) until it simmers. The patient drinks this tea and does not add sugar or honey. Overweight people should use a quarter of a teaspoon of sagebrush leaves, since sagebrush can produce a strong reaction in them ...|$|R
