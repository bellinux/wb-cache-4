40|$|Critical {{aspects of}} {{commercial}} diplomacy in the United States and the European Union are undergoing {{a process of}} gradual privatisation. We examine institutional arrangements that permit private groups (predominantly industry associations and firms) to petition for the initiation of trade disputes, propose agenda items for multilateral negotiations in the World Trade Organisation, and conduct negotiations on proposals for regulatory reform outside state-to-state channels. These include the United States' Section 301, the European Union's Trade Barriers Regulation, formal consultation processes surrounding WTO negotiations, and the <b>Transatlantic</b> <b>Business</b> <b>Dialogue.</b> We explore the reasons why governments have opened up these new access points for industry, draw comparisons among the institutions and between the US and EU experience of them, and outline patterns of industry use of the petition mechanisms by broad industrial classification. Along with building theory on comparative private-sector policy substitutability, we consider some of the normative issues raised by institutions for privatised commercial diplomacy.

40|$|EU–US (European Union–United States) {{interactions}} {{in relation to}} the regulation of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) have been examined in detail in recent years. To do this scholars have tended to focus on a small number of high profile processes, such as the formal complaint of the US to the World Trade Organisation regarding the regulation of GMOs in the Europe. It is important to analyse developments of this kind but overemphasis on them has also lead to a distorted view of the case and a failure to appreciate the significance of other, less visible, types of interaction. In this paper we focus instead on trying to understand the roles played by various EU–US transnational networks—The <b>Transatlantic</b> <b>Business</b> <b>Dialogue,</b> The Transatlantic Economic Partnership, The Transatlantic Consumer Dialogue, The Transatlantic Environmental Dialogue and the EU–US Consultative Forum on Biotechnology. These networks have been trying to shape the regulation of GMOs in both jurisdictions since the mid 1990 s. By analysing them through a ‘governance lens’ we find that we can better understand EU–US interactions and the dynamics and influences around the regulation of GMOs. This gives us valuable insights into processes of contemporary governance...|$|E
