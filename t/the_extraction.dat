40|$|A {{study was}} made of the {{possibility}} of recovering worthwhile organic material from Westvaco's Green. River, Wyoming oil shale. Alkaline extractions of oil shale In the presence of potassium permanganate and of previously air oxidized oil shale were both studied. A sealed Parr reaction apparatus was used to make <b>the</b> <b>extractions.</b> <b>The</b> aim was to extract the organic material from the shale with alkaline solutions. In <b>the</b> alkaline-permanganate <b>extractions,</b> <b>the</b> organic material in the shale was. oxidized with potassium permanganate during <b>the</b> <b>extractions.</b> In <b>the</b> air oxidation studies, the shale was oxidized with air previous to <b>the</b> alkaline <b>extractions.</b> Air oxidation would be used in a commercial operation. An investigation was made to determine how much of the organic, material in the shale could be recovered by <b>the</b> alkaline-permanganate <b>extraction</b> and subsequent treatment of <b>the</b> resulting <b>extraction</b> liquors. <b>The</b> recovery of the organic material was done in two steps. The first step recovered the acid insoluble material merely by acidifying the extract liquors. The second step recovered the acid soluble material by extracting it from the liquors with acetone. Approximately 6. 7 per cent of the shale was recovered as organic material. This recovery corresponded to 70 - 80 per pent of the organic materia...|$|R

5|$|Industrial {{production}} of selenium usually involves <b>the</b> <b>extraction</b> of selenium dioxide from residues obtained during the purification of copper.

40|$|Research about {{application}} and extraction selectivity of p-(amino) butoxy-calix[4]arene and p-(acetylamino) butoxycalix[4]arene to nitrate, bisulphate, and dihydrogenphosphate anions has been conducted. <b>The</b> <b>extractions</b> {{were conducted by}} batch method and involve two variables, i. e stirring duration and concentrations of anions. The determination of anions concentrations were conducted by conductivity method with external standardisation and corrected with conductivity of controls. The selectivity of the extractants to the anions was determined by compares their extractabilities. By this research it was known that <b>the</b> <b>extractions</b> of nitrate, bisulphate, and dihydrogenphosphate anions with p-(amino) butoxy-calix[4]arene were optimum in 150, 120, and 180 minutes, respectively; while <b>the</b> <b>extractions</b> with p-(acetylamino) butoxycalix[4]arene were optimum in 45, 90, and 180 minutes, respectively. The order of extractability of p-(amino) butoxy-calix[4]arene is dihydrogenphosphate (80, 0 %), nitrate (64, 7 %), and bisuphate (13, 0 %); while the p-(acetylamino) butoxycalix[4]arene is dihydrogenphosphate (83, 6 %), bisulphate (56, 9 %), and nitrate (37, 3 %).

5|$|Rhodium is a {{fission product}} of uranium-235; therefore, each {{kilogram}} of fission product contains {{a significant amount}} of the lighter platinum group metals including rhodium. Used nuclear fuel is a potential source of rhodium. However, <b>the</b> <b>extraction</b> is complex and expensive, and the presence of rhodium radioisotopes requires a period of cooling storage for multiple half-lives of the longest-lived isotope (about 10 years). These factors make the source unattractive and no large-scale extraction has been attempted.|$|E
