Rinuccio defends Schicchi in an aria [...] "Avete torto" [...] (You're mistaken), after which Schicchi and Lauretta arrive. Schicchi quickly grasps the situation, and Rinuccio begs him for help, but Schicchi is rudely told by Zita to [...] "be off" [...] and take his daughter with him. Rinuccio and Lauretta listen in despair as Schicchi announces that he will {{have nothing to do with}} such people. Lauretta makes a final plea to him with [...] "O mio babbino caro" [...] (Oh, my dear papa), and he agrees to look at the will.

2500|$|In June 1963, {{the terms}} of six of the seven members of the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts expired. Kennedy had already {{appointed}} landscape architect Hideo Sasaki, to the commission in 1962. Kennedy privately criticized the Eisenhower commission for [...] "spread a mantle of mediocrity and middle age over the city", and he was now determined to remake the CFA into a body that would promote modern ideas of art and architecture. Walton advised Kennedy on who to appoint to the CFA. The new commissioners included architect Gordon Bunshaft, architect Burnham Kelly, architect John Carl Warnecke (a friend of the Kennedys), sculptor Theodore Roszak, and art critic Aline B. Saarinen. Although Walton himself did not lobby for a position, Kennedy named him to the commission as well. Kennedy warned him, however, that the administration had limited political capital to spend on the arts and that Walton should never put Kennedy {{in a position where}} the president would have {{to go out on a}} limb to rescue him. Walton's chairmanship was easy-going. His leadership style was informal and collegial, and he pushed the commission to shape and prod designers rather than tell <b>them</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Chicken Little (1943) {{is similar}} to 5th Column Mouse in that it depicts how the Nazis tried to instill fear into their enemies. [...] The cartoon begins with a {{barnyard}} scene which introduces the main characters: [...] “Cocky Locky” is depicted as the leader of, “Henny Lenny” is the gossip queen, “Turkey Lurkey” is shown as the educated elite, and “Chicken Little", the dunce. [...] The animals are all seen as happy because of a large fence protecting them. [...] However, “Foxy Loxy” wants {{to get in and}} uses a book entitled [...] "Psychology" [...] to not just get one chicken, but “get them all” by aiming for least intelligent chicken in order to eventually influence the masses. [...] It also instructs that if telling a lie, it is best to make it a big one. [...] The fox then convinces Chicken Little that the sky is falling. [...] Chicken Little initially convinces the barnyard that the sky is falling, leading to panic. [...] Cocky Locky steps onto the scene to calm the situation explaining that Chicken Little was not hit on the head by a piece of the sky. [...] The crowd is dispersed with Chicken Little left crying and ashamed. [...] The fox then realizes that he must “undermine the faith of the masses in their leaders” according to the psychology book. [...] The fox then convinces Henny Lenny and her gossiping crowd that Cocky Locky may be wrong and if so, they will all be killed. [...] The fox then convinces Turkey Lurkey and his educated elite that Cocky Locky is displaying “totalitarian tendencies and is trying to dictate to us.” [...] The fox next reads, “By the use of flattery, insignificant people can be made to look at themselves as born leaders.” [...] Chicken Little is convinced by the fox that everyone will listen to him now and should save all the other animals and tell <b>them</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> [...] When the animals begin to fear for their lives and ask to know what to do, Chicken Little, who is a puppet of the fox, tells them to run to the cave. [...] When they all run inside the fox ties a napkin around his neck and announces, “dinner is served.” [...] The film quite unashamedly got across the message the dangers of creating panic and not using logic and reason in a time of crisis. [...] The book Foxy read early in the film was originally intended to be Mein Kampf, however the producers thought that this might come across as too strong to the audience.|$|E
