5|$|HDMI 1.4 was {{released}} on May 28, 2009, and the first HDMI 1.4 products were available {{in the second half}} of 2009. HDMI 1.4 added support for 4K×2K, i.e. 4096×2160 at 24Hz (which is a resolution used with digital theaters), 3840×2160 (Ultra HD) at 24Hz/25Hz/30Hz, and support for 1080p at 120Hz. It also added an HDMI Ethernet Channel (HEC) which allows for a 100Mbit/s Ethernet connection between the <b>two</b> <b>HDMI</b> connected devices so they can share an Internet connection, introduced an audio return channel (ARC), 3D Over HDMI, a new Micro HDMI Connector, an expanded set of color spaces with the addition of sYCC601, Adobe RGB and Adobe YCC601, and an Automotive Connection System. HDMI 1.4 defined several stereoscopic 3D formats including field alternative (interlaced), frame packing (a full resolution top-bottom format), line alternative full, side-by-side half, side-by-side full, 2D + depth, and 2D + depth + graphics + graphics depth (WOWvx). HDMI 1.4 requires that 3D displays implement the frame packing 3D format at either 720p50 and 1080p24 or 720p60 and 1080p24. High Speed HDMI cables as defined in HDMI 1.3 work with all HDMI 1.4 features except for the HDMI Ethernet Channel, which requires the new High Speed HDMI Cable with Ethernet defined in HDMI 1.4.|$|E
25|$|The initial {{prototype}} shown in May 2005 featured <b>two</b> <b>HDMI</b> ports, three Ethernet ports and six USB ports; however, {{when the system}} was shown again a year later at E3 2006, these were reduced to one HDMI port, one Ethernet port and four USB ports, presumably to cut costs. Two hardware configurations were also announced for the console: a 20GB model and a 60GB model, priced at US$499 (€499) and US$599 (€599), respectively. The 60GB model {{was to be the}} only configuration to feature an HDMI port, Wi-Fi internet, flash card readers and a chrome trim with the logo in silver. Both models were announced for a simultaneous worldwide release: November 11, 2006, for Japan and November 17, 2006, for North America and Europe.|$|E
5000|$|By {{using two}} non-DisplayPort {{connections}} {{of the same}} connection type (for example, <b>two</b> <b>HDMI</b> connections) and the same clock frequency (like when connected to two identical monitors at the same resolution), so that a single unique pixel clock can be shared between both connections.|$|E
50|$|Connections on {{the back}} of the unit provide one <b>HDMI,</b> <b>two</b> {{component}} video, one composite video, one VGA, and one S-Video.|$|R
50|$|This is full high definition(1080p) USB PVR. It also {{features}} one <b>HDMI,</b> <b>two</b> USB 2.0, one 10/100 Mbit/s Ethernet interfaces. It has and touchpad on front.|$|R
50|$|This is full high definition(1080p) USB PVR. It {{supports}} one {{fixed tuner}} and one detachable tuner module(S2,T,C). It also features one <b>HDMI,</b> <b>two</b> USB 2.0, one eSATA, two Common Interface, two Smart card, one Optical and one 10/100 Mbit/s Ethernet interfaces.|$|R
50|$|XBR is Sony’s highest {{performance}} series of BRAVIA LCD, OLED, and formerly, Trinitron CRT and WEGA Plasma televisions featuring advanced features and progressive industrial design. According to Sony, XBR is {{an acronym for}} eXtended Bit Rate, although {{there is evidence that}} it originally stood for “Project X, Black Remote” which was supposed to set it apart from the then-standard line of Sony televisions. The XBR range is typically derived from equipment that has been released in Japan and Europe as mid and high-end models, usually with some small upgrades. For example, in Europe and Japan, the Sony X-Series 1080p TVs had <b>two</b> <b>HDMI</b> inputs, whereas on the American XBR version, there were three. An XBR may cost up to US$25,000.|$|E

50|$|Developed in 2007 and {{produced}} {{for sale in}} 2008, the Sony XEL-1 is the world's first organic light-emitting diode (OLED) television. It was also the world's thinnest television during its production, at 3 mm. It has a screen size of 11 inches with a native resolution 960×540. As the screen is too thin for I/O ports and buttons, Sony has connected the screen to a non-detachable base that contains these. The top of the base has the speaker and the power, volume, channel, input, and menu buttons, which are backlit so the symbols and abbreviations change when the XMB interface is accessed. The back of the panel has a DMeX service input, a 16-volt DC input, a VHF/UHF/cable input, a Memory Stick slot, and <b>two</b> <b>HDMI</b> inputs. On {{the left side of}} the panel there is an analog/digital audio output. The XEL-1 has a contrast ratio of 1,000,000:1, high color saturation, large viewing angles, high screen uniformity, and low power consumption. On the other hand, it has poor primary color accuracy, a quarter of the full HD resolution (1920×1080), no anti-judder processing, a light-reflective screen, few inputs, a non-detachable panel, a small screen and a MSRP of US$2,499.99. It was sold in the United States, Canada, Russia, Japan, Europe and Australia.|$|E
