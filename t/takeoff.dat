5|$|During operations, the He 111Z did {{not have}} enough power to lift a fully loaded Me 321. Some He 111s were {{supplemented}} by rocket pods for extra <b>takeoff</b> thrust, but this was not a fleet-wide action. Two rockets were mounted beneath each fuselage and one underneath each wing. This added 500kg (1,100lb) in weight. The pods were then released by parachute after <b>takeoff.</b>|$|E
25|$|Runway 14/32, which officially {{opened to}} air traffic on November 23, 2006, is unidirectional.

40|$|Unexpected {{emergency}} situations in the aviation realm (e. g., rejected <b>takeoffs)</b> demand an immediate {{response from the}} pilot {{in order to avoid}} severe consequences. Commercial pilots receive extensive training on emergency maneuvers in simulators; however, on rare occasions pilots experience an unexpected event and perform poorly. We completed a series of studies aimed at investigating the effects of expectancy on performance for rejected <b>takeoffs.</b> We found that undergraduate students had a significant degradation in performance for unexpected rejected <b>takeoffs.</b> These results have implications for pilots who experience unexpected events on the line...|$|R

50|$|Whilst most runways and taxiways {{from the}} {{military}} airfield remain, only one runway is primarily used, to avoid <b>takeoffs</b> and landings over built-up areas: east-west Runway 09/27, which was extended eastwards by the RAF in 1956 to 1841 metres long. The old 04/22 runway is no longer used for <b>takeoffs</b> or landings, but is used for parking and taxiing of aircraft.|$|R
5|$|Trans World Airlines (TWA) Flight 159 was a {{regularly}} scheduled passenger flight from New York City to Los Angeles, California, with a stopover in Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport, Kentucky, that crashed after an aborted <b>takeoff</b> from Cincinnati on 6 November 1967. The Boeing 707 attempted to abort <b>takeoff</b> when the copilot became {{concerned that the}} aircraft had collided with a disabled DC-9 on the runway.

5|$|Before each flight, a {{briefing}} was held, alerting the crewmembers to basic world events {{as well as}} safety criteria.

5|$|Meanwhile, at 09:35, two USAF F-15C fighter {{aircraft}} {{from the}} 53d Fighter Squadron, piloted by Captain Eric Wickson and Lieutenant Colonel Randy W. May, departed Incirlik AB. Their {{mission was to}} perform an initial fighter sweep of the TAOR to clear the area of any hostile aircraft prior to the entry of coalition forces. The air tasking order (ATO) {{that was supposed to}} list all scheduled coalition aircraft missions for that day and which the two pilots reviewed before <b>takeoff,</b> mentioned that U.S. Army Black Hawk helicopters would be operating in the TAOR that day but did not list <b>takeoff</b> times, routes, or flight durations for them. At 10:15, Wickson radioed Martin on the AWACS and asked if he had any information to pass to them to which Martin replied in the negative.|$|E
