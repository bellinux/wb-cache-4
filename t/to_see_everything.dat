Tito felt the game's difficulty suffered as the town grew larger, with no proper end game goal to keep players engaged beyond earning achievements.|$|E
5|$|McKellar {{was also}} {{considered}} a capable leader in combat. Aggressive and instinctive, his fighting spirit was {{an inspiration to}} his squadron but according to one biographer, he was highly strung, vociferous and blunt with members of his unit. Nevertheless, his directness and socially confident nature singled him out for command. His dedication to {{his job as a}} fighter pilot and leader led him to refuse any leave from his Squadron while the Battle of Britain lasted. Invariably McKellar led from the front of his unit. He spent a large proportion of his time with his squadron practising combat tactics. While intensely loyal to anyone he considered a friend, McKellar's attitude to others outside the squadron was either of utmost friendliness or utter dislike. He is said to have tended <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>everything</b> and everyone in black and white.|$|E
25|$|Retail {{designers}} {{pay close}} attention {{to the front of the}} store, which is known as the decompression zone. This is usually an open space in the entrance of the store to allow customers to adjust to their new environment. An open-plan floor design is effective in retail as it allows customers <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>everything.</b> In terms of the store's exterior, the side of the road cars normally travel, determines the way stores direct customers. New Zealand retail stores, for instance, would direct customers to the left.|$|E

25|$|Though Sarah is more deferential than Nancy, {{she does}} assert herself to Leslie when an {{experience}} is important. For example, she insists on accompanying Leslie when {{he approaches the}} humans in act II after they have taken their submissive pose. Sarah wants <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>everything</b> for herself. Most of the new things she encounters intrigue her: the handshakes; Nancy's breasts; human gestation; and the birds flying above them, among other things. But she is also fearful. The jets frighten her, as does Charlie when he asks her {{what she would do}} if Leslie went away and never came back. Like Leslie, Sarah does not grasp many human concepts like emotions and nonaquatic animals, though she tries.|$|E
25|$|Safety {{levels of}} the technology, the thought of abandoning control to a machine, and {{psychological}} comfort of passengers in such situations were the major discussion topics initially. The commuters also stated {{that they did not}} want <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>everything</b> the car was doing. This was primarily a referral to the auto-steering wheel with no one sitting in the driving seat. Intel also learnt that voice control regulator is vital, and the interface between the humans and machine eases the discomfort condition, and brings some sense of control back. It is important to mention that Intel included only 10 people in this study, which makes the study less credible. In a video posted on YouTube, Intel accepted this fact and called for further testing.|$|E
500|$|During his trial, Kenyatta {{described}} himself as a Christian, stating that [...] "I do not follow any particular denomination. I believe in Christianity as a whole." [...] Arnold stated that in England, Kenyatta's adherence to Christianity was [...] "desultory". While in London, Kenyatta had taken an interest in the atheist speakers at Speakers' Corner in Hyde Park, while an Irish Muslim friend had unsuccessfully urged Kenyatta to convert to Islam. During his imprisonment, Kenyatta read up on Islam, Hinduism, and Buddhism through books supplied to him by Stock. The Israeli diplomat Asher Naim visited him in this period, noting that although Kenyatta was [...] "not a religious man, he was appreciative of the Bible". Despite portraying himself as a Christian, he found the attitudes of many European missionaries intolerable, in particular their readiness <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>everything</b> African as evil. In Facing Mount Kenya, he challenged the missionaries' dismissive attitude toward ancestor veneration, which he instead preferred to call [...] "ancestor communion". In that book's dedication, Kenyatta invoked [...] "ancestral spirits" [...] as part of [...] "the Fight for African Freedom." ...|$|E

500|$|Comedy Central's {{press release}} {{prior to the}} airing of the episode alluded to its significance, stating: [...] "After Stan celebrates his 10th birthday, he begins <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>everything</b> differently... The very fabric of South Park begins to unravel." [...] Coinciding with {{production}} and performance of the Broadway musical The Book of Mormon produced by the South Park creators, there had been speculation over doubt within the writing team {{on the future of}} South Park. Following the episode's broadcast, it received significant media attention due to its ending and themes. Much of the conversation centered on the final scene of dialogue between the Marshes, with Entertainment Weekly noting it could be [...] "a not-so-thinly-veiled way of Stone and Parker telling us they had a similar discussion about their very show." [...] Critics pointed to a March 2011 profile in The Hollywood Reporter, in which they spoke at how they dreaded to return to producing South Park: [...] "I don't know how we're going to do it. It's a nightmare." [...] "Knowing that Parker and Stone have been experiencing a bit of an existential crisis or even just restlessness definitely made tonight seem unusually thematically heavy," [...] remarked Sean O'Neal of The A.V. Club.|$|E
2500|$|When he {{returned}} home, {{he found that}} his three-year-old nephew had learned to speak French. He noticed the boy was very curious and upon {{his first visit to}} a mill, he wanted <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>everything</b> and be told the name of everything. [...] After digesting the experience silently, he then reenacted his experiences in play, talking about what he learned to whoever would listen or to himself. Gouin decided that language learning was a matter of transforming perceptions into conceptions, using language to represent what one experiences. Language is not an arbitrary set of conventions but a way of thinking and representing the world to oneself. It is not a conditioning process, but one in which the learner actively organizes his perceptions into linguistics concepts.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the primary}} clandestine uses of {{nanotechnology}} is information gathering. The Culture likes {{to be in the}} know, and as described in Matter [...] "they tend to know everything." [...] Aside from its vast network of sympathetic allies and wandering Culture citizens one {{of the primary}} ways that the Culture keeps track of important events is by the use of practically invisible nanobots capable of recording and transmitting their observations. This technique is described as being especially useful to track potentially dangerous people (such as ex-Special Circumstance agents). Via such nanotechnology, it is potentially possible for the Culture (or similarly advanced societies) <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>everything</b> happening on a given planet, orbital or any other habitat. The usage of such devices is limited by various treaties and agreements among the Involved.|$|E

2500|$|Each {{aspect of}} VajrayoginÄ«'s form and mandala is {{designed}} to convey a spiritual meaning. For example, her brilliant red-colored body symbolizes the blazing of her tummo (candali) or [...] "inner fire" [...] of spiritual transformation as well as life force (Shakti), blood of birth and menstrual blood. Her single face symbolizes that she has realized that all phenomena are of one nature in emptiness. Her two arms symbolize her realization of the two truths. Her three eyes symbolize her ability <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>everything</b> in the past, present and future. She looks upward toward the Pure DÄkiá¹Ä« Land, demonstrating her attainment of outer and inner Pure DÄkiá¹Ä« Land, and indicating that she leads her followers to these attainments. The curved driguk knife {{in her right hand}} shows her power to cut the continuum of the delusions and obstacles of her followers and of all living beings. Drinking the blood from the kapala in her left hand symbolizes her experience of the clear light of bliss.|$|E
2500|$|On April 11, 1933 a new {{constitution}} was published. While its article 8, n.4, would establish the [...] "freedom of thought under any form", n.20 of the same article states that [...] "special laws will regulate the exercise {{of the freedom of}} expression". One article would also explain that the purpose of censorship is [...] "to prevent the perversion of public opinion in its function of social force and (censorship) should be exercised so as to defend (public opinion) from all factors that might make it stray from the truth, justice, morality, good administration and common good, and to avoid that the fundamental principles of organization of society are attacked". As would be expected, the government reserved for itself the definition of criteria for this truth, justice, and morality. In fact it would be AntÃ³nio de Oliveira Salazar himself who said in that same year, [...] "Men, groups and classes see, observe things, study the events, under the light of their own interest. Only an institution has, by duty and position, <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>everything</b> under the light of everyone's interest".|$|E
2500|$|Mark Kermode, in The Observer, labeled Pan's Labyrinth as {{the best}} film of 2006, {{describing}} it as [...] "an epic, poetic vision in which the grim realities of war are matched and mirrored by a descent into an underworld populated by fearsomely beautiful monsters". Stephanie Zacharek wrote that the film [...] "works on so many levels {{that it seems to}} change shape even as you watch it", and Jim Emerson called the film [...] "a fairy tale of such potency and awesome beauty that it reconnects the adult imagination to the primal thrill and horror of the stories that held us spellbound as children". Roger Ebert reviewed the film after his surgery and put it on his Great Movies list on 27 August 2007; when he compiled his belated top ten films of 2006, Pan's Labyrinth was #1, with him stating [...] "But even in a good year I'm unable <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>everything.</b> And I'm still not finished with my 2006 discoveries. I'm still looking at more 2007 movies, too, and that list will run as usual in late December. Nothing I am likely to see, however, is likely to change my conviction that the year's best film was Pan's Labyrinth." [...] The New Yorkers Anthony Lane took special note of the film's sound design, saying it [...] "discards any hint of the ethereal by turning up the volume on small, supercharged noises: the creak of the Captain's leather gloves... the nighttime complaints of floorboard and rafter...." ...|$|E

2500|$|Another wartime {{personality}} of Valenciennes was Louise de Bettignies (born in Saint-Amand-les-Eaux), a pupil of the Ursulines in Valenciennes from 1890 to 1896. Fluent in four languages (including German), in 1915 she created {{and directed the}} main British intelligence network behind enemy lines, nearly [...] from the front around Lille. Arrested {{at the end of}} September 1915, and imprisoned in Germany, she died of mistreatment in September 1918 two months before the Armistice. It is estimated that she saved the lives of nearly a thousand British soldiers by the remarkably precise information she obtained. For example, it enabled the British to conduct the first aerial bombing of a train (that of Kaiser Wilhelm II, who came to visit the front at Lille), though both aircraft were not equipped with suitable viewfinders and so the raid narrowly missed its target. The German High Command, based in Brussels, then put all its efforts into neutralising the accursed network that allowed the British <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>everything</b> and know everything about this part of the front. Louise's arrest was associated with the escape of Szeck Alexandre, a young Austrian radio operator got out of Brussels in August 1915, allowing the British {{to get their hands on}} the secret German diplomatic code. This code was exploited by Secret Service Room 40 ("Room 40"), under the supervision of Sir Reginald Hall, and in January 1917 allowed the decipherment of the famous Zimmermann Telegram, which triggered the United States' entry into the war in April 1917.|$|E
2500|$|Everything that Chamberlain {{viewed as}} {{good in the}} world was {{ascribed}} to the Aryans. For an example, in The Foundations [...] Chamberlain explained at considerable length that Jesus Christ could not possibly be a Jew, and very strongly implied that Christ was an Aryan. Chamberlain's tendency <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>everything</b> good as the work of the Aryans allowed him to claim whoever he approved of for the Aryan race, which at least was part of the appeal of the book in Germany when it was published in 1899. Chamberlain claimed all of the glories and achievements of ancient Greece and Rome as due entirely to Aryan blood which supposedly flowed in the veins of the ancient Greeks and Romans. Chamberlain wrote that ancient Greece was a [...] "lost ideal" [...] of beautiful thought and art that the modern Germans were best placed to recover if only the German people could embrace Wagner. Chamberlain praised Rome for its militarism, civic values, patriotism, respect for the law and reverence for the family as offering the best sort of Aryan government. Reflecting his opposition to feminism, Chamberlain lamented how modern women were not like the submissive women of ancient Rome whom he claimed were most happy in obeying the wills of their husbands. Chamberlain asserted that Aryans and Aryans alone are the only people in the entire world capable of creating beautiful art and thinking great thoughts, so he claimed all of the great artists, writers and thinkers of the West such as Homer, Dante, Giotto, Donatello, Albrecht DÃ¼rer, Leonardo da Vinci, Martin Luther, William Shakespeare, Rembrandt, Ludwig van Beethoven, Immanuel Kant and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe as part of one long glorious tradition of beautiful Aryan art and thought, which Chamberlain planned to have culminate with the life-changing, racially regenerating music of Richard Wagner in the 19th century. As the British historian George Peabody Gooch wrote, here was [...] "a glittering vision of mind and muscle, of large scale organization, of intoxicating self-confidence, of metallic brilliancy, such as Europe has never seen".|$|E
