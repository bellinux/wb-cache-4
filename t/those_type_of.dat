25|$|Affiliates {{were among}} the {{earliest}} adopters of pay per click advertising when the first pay-per-click search engines emerged during {{the end of the}} 1990s. Later in 2000 Google launched its pay per click service, Google AdWords, which is responsible for the widespread use and acceptance of pay per click as an advertising channel. An increasing number of merchants engaged in pay per click advertising, either directly or via a search marketing agency, and realized that this space was already occupied by their affiliates. Although this situation alone created advertising channel conflicts and debates between advertisers and affiliates, the largest issue concerned affiliates bidding on advertisers names, brands, and trademarks. Several advertisers began to adjust their affiliate program terms to prohibit their affiliates from bidding on <b>those</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> keywords. Some advertisers, however, did and still do embrace this behavior, {{going so far as to}} allow, or even encourage, affiliates to bid on any term, including the advertiser's trademarks.|$|E

With <b>those</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> games, players focus entirely one choosing the right character or obtaining the right equipment in the game to help them when facing other players. Tournaments are held so {{that people in the}} area or from different regions can play against other players of the same game and see who is the best. Major League Gaming (MLG) is a company that reports tournaments that are held across the country. The players that compete in these tournaments are given a rank depending on their skill level in the game that they choose to play in and face other players that play that game. The players that also compete are mostly called professional players for {{the fact that they have}} played the game they are competing in for many, long hours. Those players have been able to come up with different strategies for facing different characters. The professional players are able to pick a character to their liking and be able to master how to use that character very effectively. With strategy games, players tend to know how to get resources quick and are able to make quick decisions about where their troops are to be deployed and what kind of troops to create.|$|E

In March 2010, Usher continued to support Garrett's original claims, stating the song was recorded before his marriage ended. Usher said in an interview for MTV News for promoting Raymond v. Raymond: [...] "I think people would have immediately alluded to the fact I was talking about my wife when I made that record — and now my ex-wife," [...] he said. [...] "When the song was recorded, I wasn't divorced. It was some reality in the contrast of trying to make it all work, having to balance a career and having a normal life. Coming in at 6 in the morning and arguing was a reality when you have <b>those</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> relationships. I felt that in a way, the story did touch on certain things at the time. I didn't know how realistic it would become. I didn't know I would become divorced. I did know it spoke on the contrast between trying to balance this world of being married and having this responsibility that's like a marriage at the same time. The song spoke to that place.

500|$|Davis proved, perhaps, to be {{the most}} pivotal instrumentalist during these sessions. [...] "If you listen to the album, every tune is led by Richard and {{everybody}} followed Richard and Van's voice," [...] says Merenstein. [...] "I knew if I brought Richard in, he would put the bottom on to support what Van wanted to do vocally, or acoustically. Then you get Jay playing those beautiful counter-lines to Van." [...] Davis was not impressed by Morrison, but not out of disdain or any preconceived notions, but rather because Morrison's professional comportment generally did not meet Davis's expectations. [...] "No prep, no meeting," [...] recalls Davis. [...] "He was remote from us, 'cause he came in and went into a booth... And that's where he stayed, isolated in a booth. I don't think he ever introduced himself to us, nor we to him... And he seemed very shy..." [...] Drummer Connie Kay later told Rolling Stone that he approached Morrison and asked [...] "what he wanted me to play, and he said to play whatever I felt like playing. We more or less sat there and jammed." [...] Morrison's impression of the sessions was [...] "The songs came together very well in the studio. Some of the tracks were first takes. [...] the musicians were really together. <b>Those</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> guys play what you're gonna do before you do it, that's how good they are." [...] He told Ritchie Yorke that only two tracks recorded during the sessions did not make it to the album. [...] "One was about Jesse James and the other about trains. They were both just basic blues numbers. That's why they didn't fit in with the album." ...|$|E
