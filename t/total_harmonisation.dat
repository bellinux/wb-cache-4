40|$|In its Digital Single Market Strategy, {{unveiled}} in May 2015, the Commission {{has promised to}} come up with a revised proposal for a Common European Sales Law by the end of the year. More indications have been given the Commission in an Inception Impact Assessment, published in July 2015. The debate on the revamped proposal will have to address at least five crucial issues. Firstly, the legal form - whether the future online sales law will be a regulation or a directive? Secondly, if the legal form of a directive is chosen, whether <b>total</b> <b>harmonisation</b> or minimum harmonisation would be most appropriate, taking into account the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality? Thirdly, whether it would be sufficient for the instrument to regulate cross-border trade, or should it also extend to purely domestic online transactions? A fourth issue regards the 'country of origin principle' - should traders be allowed to rely on their domestic law when selling to consumers abroad? How would that fit with the current system of Rome I and Brussels Ia Regulations? Finally, the debate must focus on the content of the revamped proposal. Should it be copy-pasted from the original CESL, or perhaps tailor-made to online transactions specifically, where both consumers and traders have different interests and expectations than in offline transactions...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{generate}} an understanding of the evolution of European competition policy in the context of the globalising economy of the 20 th and early 21 st centuries by analysing the role of ideas in influencing merger policies. Normally competition policy is framed by legal and economic studies as the set of regulations leading market competition according to criteria of efficiency and/or economic welfare. By advancing this analysis, the paper investigates on how abstract economic concepts and theories on the one hand, and material interests such as welfare and efficiency on the other, by influencing political actors’ understanding of reality, have shaped the decision-making process behind specific European competition policies. My analysis develops on the basis of what I call a pan-institutional methodology, a synthesis of an institutional understanding of competition policy and sociological theories of isomorphism. Pan-institutionalism reveals that the corpus of ideas, which favoured the neoliberal transformation that invested European institutions in the 20 th and early 21 st century, can be identified as German Ordoliberal and the Chicago paradigms of competition policy. To a degree, this latter US-originated approach has been internalised by Europe through formal and informal institutions, and adapted in light of the major oil crises of the 80 ’s. At the same time however, the reliance of Europe on the traditional Ordoliberal understanding of market practices has prevented a <b>total</b> <b>harmonisation</b> of EU competition policies with the American ones...|$|E

[...] The {{competitiveness}} of {{actors in the}} economic sphere is significantly determined by {{the effectiveness of their}} provisioning chain. Our investigation dealt with questions related to the raw material provisioning of a virtual energy-cluster. We examined those elements of production technology, in which the logistics methods and the optimisation of the flow of materials showed tangible results. The optimal solution to these tasks is provided by that combination of apparatus wherein both the â€œtime factorâ€ (JIT) and the efforts to minimise costs are realised. The provisioning chain we examined comprised of harvesting, transport and storage process elements; of these, harvesting in particular, due to its exceptionally high operating costs (25 - 35, 000 Ft/shift hour). We sought an {{answer to the question of}} whether it is better to transport the raw material directly to the processing plant or indirectly after temporary storage. In the case of indirect delivery, where should storage facilities be established and how many should there be, in the interests of minimising total costs? We created and utilised a simulation model to solve the task. We established that in case of short transport distances (1 - 3 km), direct transport is feasible. In the case of greater distances, indirect transport and the development of micro-logistical storage centres is justified. The number and location of these micro-logistical storage centres can be exactly determined with the help of our model. ellÃ¡tÃ¡si logisztikai rendszer, Ã¶sszkÃ¶ltség-szemlélet, folyamatelemek Ã¶sszehangolÃ¡sa, rakodÃ³, szÃ¡llÃ­tÃ³ és fogadÃ³ kapacitÃ¡s, vÃ¡rakozÃ¡si idÅ‘, provisioning logistics systems, <b>total</b> expenditure approach, <b>harmonisation</b> of process elements, loading, transport and receiving capacity, waiting time, Agricultural and Food Policy, Financial Economics, Resource /Energy Economics and Policy,...|$|R
40|$|There {{are several}} {{international}} and European legal instruments which provide a legal {{basis for the}} establishments of marine protected areas (MPAs) {{for the purpose of}} improving fishery management in the marine environment. Nevertheless, the effectiveness of MPAs remains open to debate and considerable attention is now focussed at international and European levels on how to improve the enforcement of regulations in MPAs. In this context, there is little doubt but that monitoring, control and surveillance (MCS) are indispensable tools for improving law enforcement and compliance in such areas. Indeed, recent experience in the European Union suggests that the effectiveness of MCS ought to be a primary consideration when designated areas to be protected in the marine environment. Accordingly, the aim {{of this article is to}} focus on some of the difficulties that must be overcome in order to improve the effectiveness of MCS in MPAs. Particular emphasis is placed on the problems that stem from the absence of common definitions regarding the characteristics of the area to be protected, the absence of harmonisation of MCS in such areas, as well as the problems that stem from practical considerations such as the size, shape and location of MPAs. The article also reviews basic fishery enforcement measures which can improve the effectiveness of MPAs including: hydrofencing, special fishing permits, one gear rule, as well as specific monitoring systems and security enforcement zones. Although the <b>total</b> <b>harmonisation</b> of regulatory measures is desirable from a law enforcement perspective, the article nonetheless concludes that it is also possible to have specific MCS solutions tailored to meet the characteristics of the area that needs to be protected...|$|E
40|$|Since the {{adoption}} of the current Consumer Credit Directive 87 / 102 /EC in 1986, the EU consumer credit market has changed significantly in terms of size and structure. Although amendments were introduced in 1990 and 1999, the Directive no longer addresses the needs of the market. Cross-border lending in the EU has been estimated to be only 2 to 5 % of total EU lending, partly owing to variations in the applicable legislation across member states. The reason for the persistent legal differences is that the current regulatory model is based on a minimum harmonisation approach (together with the rules of Art. 5 of the Rome Convention) and national regulators have different views about consumer protection. To move towards greater consistency, the Commission sought to change the regulatory approach from minimum to <b>total</b> <b>harmonisation</b> in its proposed new Consumer Credit Directive. Yet this regulatory method presents several difficulties. The EU legislative process is too long and rigid for a fast-changing market. Further, member states do not wish to lose regulatory powers on issues that may need rapid adaptations to meet social or economic needs. This paper argues that one way forward is to draw from the experience of the strategies used to achieve integration of EU financial markets and adapt it to the field of consumer credit. A variation of the Lamfalussy approach, in which comitology procedures are used in the legislative process, would radically improve the regulatory process for consumer credit. By involving the member states to a greater extent and allowing for quick adaptations, such an approach would ultimately lead to a greater level of market integration...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{generate}} an understanding of antitrust and its evolution {{in the context of}} the globalising economy of the 20 th and early 21 st centuries. I do this by focusing on the role of economic ideas and more specifically, conceptual approaches to competition policy, in the international context. Existing legal and economic studies have mainly framed antitrust as the disciplinary tool regulating market competition according to criteria of efficiency and/or economic welfare. So far, few researchers have addressed the enforcement of policies - and specifically, of market competition regulations, without resorting to pure rational-choice or reflectivist arguments. This thesis aims to fill this gap by examining the ways in which abstract economic concepts and theories on the one hand and material interests on the other, by influencing political actors’ understanding of reality, have shaped the decision-making process behind specific antitrust policies and laws. My analysis develops on the basis of what I call a pan-institutional methodology, a synthesis of an institutional understanding of antitrust and sociological theories of isomorphism. Pan-institutionalism is employed here to examine the development of antitrust policies in the US, Europe and Japan during the Great Depression of the 1930 s, the oil crises of the 1970 s and the current recession. My study reveals that the corpus of ideas and institutions of antitrust of the 20 th and early 21 st century can be identified as Harvard, Chicago and Post-Chicago paradigms of competition policy. To a degree, these US-originated approaches have been internalised by Europe and Japan through formal and informal institutions, and adapted in light of major economic crises. At the same time however, the reliance of Europe and Japan on their traditional understanding of market practices has prevented a <b>total</b> <b>harmonisation</b> of their antitrust policies with the dominant American ones...|$|E
