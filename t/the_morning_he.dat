5|$|In January 1934 the Black Hawks {{were on a}} train back to Chicago when Gardiner felt {{an intense}} pain in his throat that spread {{to the rest of}} his body, notably his kidneys. When {{questioned}} by Tommy Gorman about his issue, Gardiner lied to Gorman and insisted it was only a minor headache. However, when Gardiner woke up on the train in <b>the</b> <b>morning,</b> <b>he</b> had trouble seeing, as black spots obscured his vision. This was Gardiner's first uremic convulsion.|$|E
5|$|Lee's plan, however, {{was based}} on faulty intelligence, {{exacerbated}} by Stuart's continued absence from the battlefield. Though Lee personally reconnoitered his left during <b>the</b> <b>morning,</b> <b>he</b> did not visit Longstreet's position on the Confederate right. Even so, Lee rejected suggestions that Longstreet move beyond Meade's left and attack the Union flank, capturing the supply trains and effectively blocking Meade's escape route.|$|E

5|$|Beauregard's {{decision}} {{was one of}} the most controversial of the Civil War. Numerous veterans and historians have wondered what might have happened if the assault had gone forward into the night. Beauregard believed that the battle was essentially won and his men could finish off Grant in <b>the</b> <b>morning.</b> <b>He</b> knew the terrain to be crossed (a steep ravine containing a creek named Dill Branch) was extremely difficult and Grant's defensive line was heavy with massed artillery and supported by gunboats in the river. Unbeknownst to Beauregard, Buell's Army of the Ohio began arriving that afternoon, and he and Grant launched a massive counterattack on April 7. Overwhelmed, the Confederates retreated to Corinth.|$|E
5|$|Bond is {{eventually}} captured by Gorner in the heroin plant, who explains that Bond {{is to be}} used as bait during a drugs delivery across the Afghan desert, and should he survive an expected ambush, is to fly the captured airliner into the Russian heartland. Bond would be identified as British upon its destruction, increasing the evidence against the British Government. Bond survives the predicted Afghan attack and plots an escape attempt, which sees Scarlett get away due to Bond surrendering himself as a diversion. In <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> <b>he</b> is taken aboard the aeroplane. Before the airliner can bomb the Soviets, with the aid of the airliner's pilot and Scarlett (who had been hiding on board), Bond regains control of the aeroplane and crashes it into a mountainside after parachuting to safety.|$|E
5|$|Lamenting at a bar, {{she meets}} Johnnie (Mark Proksch), a former mate at their {{secondary}} school. Johnnie confesses his anxiety regarding a scheduled interview with Bubblegum {{for a business}} venture. Lumpy advises that he fix his posture as to appear more confident. Johnnie thanks Lumpy for her advice and invites her to his complex. There, the two {{fall in love and}} share good nights. When Johnnie finds Lumpy absent in <b>the</b> <b>morning,</b> <b>he</b> suspects that she has abandoned him. Much to his relief, he finds her waiting for breakfast in his kitchen. When he returns from the interview, he reveals he has been invited to a separate meeting with Bubblegum at her castle. Lumpy asks that she appear with him, but Johnnie says the meeting is private. Supposing Bubblegum has stolen his heart, Lumpy leaves in a fit of rage.|$|E

5|$|The {{grenadiers}} {{left the}} convent at dawn, preparing their formations behind the convent. San Martín {{returned to the}} tower to watch the enemy who disembarked at sunrise, 5:30 in <b>the</b> <b>morning.</b> <b>He</b> mounted his horse, gave a short harangue to the troops, and headed to battle. His strategy was to divide his cavalry forces into two columns, of nearly sixty horsemen each, and make a surprise pincer movement to trap the enemy forces. The cavalry would not use their guns, relying instead on saber and spear attacks. The right-hand column was headed by Justo German Bermúdez, and the left-hand one by San Martín. The royalists marched in two columns with the two cannons, a deployed flag and military drummers. The clarion of the regiment of mounted grenadiers sounded for the first time, marking {{the beginning of the}} battle.|$|E
5|$|Amésqueta left Mopán {{three days}} after Díaz and {{followed}} Díaz’s trail to the lakeshore. He arrived at the lake over a week later with 36 men. As they scouted along the south shore near Nojpetén they were shadowed by about 30 Itza canoes and more Itzas approached by land but kept a safe distance. Amésqueta was extremely suspicious of the small canoes being offered by the Itza to transport his party across to Nojpetén; as nightfall approached Amésqueta retreated from the lakeshore and his men took up positions on a small hill nearby. In {{the early hours of}} <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> <b>he</b> ordered a retreat by moonlight. At San Pedro Martír he received news of an Itza embassy to Mérida in December 1695, and an apparent formal surrender of the Itza to Spanish authority. Unable to reconcile the news with the loss of his men, and with appalling conditions in San Pedro Mártir, Amésqueta abandoned his unfinished fort and retreated to Guatemala.|$|E
5|$|Amésqueta was {{extremely}} {{suspicious of the}} small canoes being supplied, knowing that the Itza had 30-man canoes; he was also aware that tricking enemies into small canoes was a favoured tactic among the lowland Maya to separate and kill Spanish intruders. He suspected that AjK'ixaw had betrayed them {{and that this was}} precisely what had happened to Díaz and his men. As nightfall approached, low on rations, in a vulnerable location and with no sign of Díaz and his men, Amésqueta retreated from the lakeshore and his men took up positions on a small hill nearby. In the early hours of <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> <b>he</b> ordered a retreat by moonlight, using just a few torches. They arrived back at Chakal on 25 March and from there retreated to San Pedro Mártir on 9 April, beset by worsening conditions, a hurricane, sickness and rumours of enemies. The battered expedition set up a base camp nine leagues (approximately 23.4miles or 37.7km) north of Mopan.|$|E

5|$|Gouty {{patients}} are, generally, either old men or men {{who have}} so worn themselves out in youth as to have brought on a premature old age—of such dissolute habits none being more common than the premature and excessive indulgence in venery and the like exhausting passions. The victim goes to bed and sleeps in good health. About two o'clock in <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> <b>he</b> is awakened by a severe pain in the great toe; more rarely in the heel, ankle or instep. The pain is {{like that of a}} dislocation and yet parts feel as if cold water were poured over them. Then follows chills and shivers and a little fever... The night is passed in torture, sleeplessness, turning the part affected and perpetual change of posture; the tossing about of body being as incessant as the pain of the tortured joint and being worse as the fit comes on.|$|E
5|$|So, after Thor secures his goats at Egil's home, Thor and Týr go to Hymir's hall {{in search}} of a {{cauldron}} large enough to brew ale for them all. They arrive, and Týr sees his nine-hundred-headed grandmother and his gold-clad mother, the latter of which welcomes them with a horn. After Hymir—who is not happy to see Thor—comes in from the cold outdoors, Týr's mother helps them find a properly strong cauldron. Thor eats a big meal of two oxen (all the rest eat but one), and then goes to sleep. In <b>the</b> <b>morning,</b> <b>he</b> awakes and informs Hymir that he wants to go fishing the following evening, and that he will catch plenty of food, but that he needs bait. Hymir tells him to go get some bait from his pasture, which he expects should not be a problem for Thor. Thor goes out, finds Hymir's best ox, and rips its head off.|$|E
5|$|After VJ Patterson (Felix Dean) is bullied by Riley Radcliffe (Tani Edgecombe) {{he goes to}} see {{his father}} Ian (Ben Simpson) but he laughs it off. Miles is {{attacked}} and beaten and presumes it was Ian. He later finds out {{it was in fact}} Riley and his friends. He tries to drag Riley to the police station but he breaks his wrist. Miles is arrested for assault. Ian blackmails him saying he will drop the charges for money, the police find out Ian was responsible for the injuries. However the newspapers published an article on Miles branding him a thug. Miles destroys a classroom and Gina Austin (Sonia Todd) forces him to take leave. He starts drinking heavily again, makes a pass at Leah and sleeps on the beach. Miles begins having visions of a girl called Rabbit, who tells him about future events. She convinces him to do good deeds. Miles becomes good friends with Elijah Johnson (Jay Laga'aia) and he goes to Africa with him. On his return he is assaulted by Heath Braxton (Daniel Ewing). He then gets drunk and kisses Roo Stewart (Georgie Parker) and wakes up next to her in <b>the</b> <b>morning.</b> <b>He</b> later confesses his love to Leah and they start a relationship. Elijah is initially annoyed, but they repair their friendship. Leah learns she is pregnant, which delights Miles. Leah is initially hesitant about going ahead with the pregnancy, but she and Miles talk and she decides to keep the baby. Miles proposes to Leah, but she turns him down, saying they are not ready. She later asks him to move in with her and VJ. Leah suffers a miscarriage, which devastates Miles. The couple struggle with their grief and Miles moves out. He and Leah later break up. Miles learns Elijah is still in love with Leah. Miles tells Marilyn that Sally has got him a teaching job in Thailand and he leaves the Summer Bay.|$|E

5|$|On {{the other}} side, Frederick {{commanded}} 27 battalions of infantry (17,000 men) and 43 squadrons of cavalry (5,000 horse), plus 72 companies of artillery, {{for a total}} of 22,000 men. He also had several of the siege guns from Leipzig, which arrived late in <b>the</b> <b>morning.</b> <b>He</b> spent the morning watching the French from the Goldacker manor rooftop in Rossbach. The initial stages of Allied movement convinced him that the Allies had started retreating southward towards their magazines; he sent out patrols to learn from the peasants what could be gleaned. They reported back that Soubise had taken the Weissenfels road; it led not only to that village, but also toward Freiburg, where Soubise could find supplies, or to Merseburg, where they would cut the Prussians off from the Saale. At about noon Frederick went to dinner, leaving the young captain Friedrich Wilhelm von Gaudi to observe French movements. Two hours later, his watch captain reported the French approaching. Although Gaudi's excited report at first appeared to confirm a French-Austrian retreat, Frederick observed that Allied columns, which from time to time became visible in the undulations of the ground, appeared to turn eastwards from Zeuchfeld. When Frederick saw for himself that hostile cavalry and infantry were already approaching Pettstädt, he realized his enemy's intentions: to attack him in the flank and rear, and break his communications line, if not crush him completely. They now offered him the battle for which he had maneuvered in vain, and he accepted it without hesitation.|$|E
