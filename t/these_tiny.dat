Semicircular windows connect the shrines and decorative Kirtimukha (demon faces) are {{used at the}} top. The Chavundaraya basadi built in the 10th or 11th century, Chandragupta basadi built in the 6th century and the monolithic of Gomateshwara of 982 {{are the most important}} monuments at Shravanabelagola. Some features were added to the Chandragupta basadi by famous Hoysala sculptor Dasoja in the 12th century. The decorative doorjambs and perforated screen windows which depict scenes from the life of King Chandragupta Maurya are known to be his creation. The Panchakuta Basadi at Kambadahalli (five towered Jan temple) of about 900 with a Brahmadeva pillar is an excellent example of Dravidian art. The wall niches here are surmounted by torana (lintel) with carvings of floral motifs, flying divine creatures (gandharva) and imaginary monsters (makara) ridden by Yaksas (attendants of saints) while the niches are occupied by images of tirthankars themselves.|$|E
25|$|Studying the {{evolution}} of butterflies and moths is challenging, since fossils are so rare. But the few Lepidopteran fossils that exist, captured in amber or compressed in fine-grained rocks, show great detail. The earliest Lepidopteran fossils appear in rocks that are about 190 million years old. <b>These</b> <b>tiny</b> fragments of scaled wings and bodies clearly indicate that moths evolved before butterflies.|$|E
25|$|Valve electrometers use a {{specialized}} vacuum tube (thermionic valve) {{with a very}} high gain (transconductance) and input resistance. The input current is allowed to flow into the high impedance grid, and the voltage so generated is vastly amplified in the anode (plate) circuit. Valves designed for electrometer use have leakage currents as low as a few femtoamperes (10−15 amperes). Such valves must be handled with gloved hands as the salts left on the glass envelope can provide leakage paths for <b>these</b> <b>tiny</b> currents.|$|E

25|$|Copepods {{and other}} {{zooplankton}} are plentiful in the North Sea. <b>These</b> <b>tiny</b> organisms are crucial {{elements of the}} food chain supporting many species of fish. Over 230 species of fish live in the North Sea. Cod, haddock, whiting, saithe, plaice, sole, mackerel, herring, pouting, sprat, and sandeel are all very common and are fished commercially. Due to the various depths of the North Sea trenches and differences in salinity, temperature, and water movement, some fish such as blue-mouth redfish and rabbitfish reside only in small areas of the North Sea.|$|E
25|$|The {{regulation}} of horsepower {{has been suggested}} {{to be due to}} the fitment of turbochargers and superchargers to <b>these</b> <b>tiny</b> engines during the late 1980s to cope with the lack of horsepower and torque. However, the installation of turbochargers and superchargers also had a benefit in that fuel efficiency increased, thereby reducing tailpipe emissions, which are also taxed, while the installation of turbos and superchargers made the vehicles very fast and nimble relative to their size. Engine technology is also shared with sport bikes, which are designed for rider enjoyment, and less so on fuel economy.|$|E

25|$|During {{the past}} ten years, unusually warm Caribbean waters have been {{increasingly}} threatening Caribbean coral reefs. Coral reefs support {{some of the most}} diverse marine habitats in the world, but they are fragile ecosystems. When tropical waters become unusually warm for extended periods of time, microscopic plants called zooxanthellae, which are symbiotic partners living within the coral polyp tissues, die off. These plants provide food for the corals, and give them their color. The result of the death and dispersal of <b>these</b> <b>tiny</b> plants is called coral bleaching, and can lead to the devastation of large areas of reef. Over 42% of corals are completely bleached and 95% are experiencing some type of whitening. Historically the Caribbean is thought to contain 14% of the world's coral reefs.|$|E
25|$|In birds, whose cells contain microchromosomes, it {{has been}} {{suggested}} that there was a correlation between the presence of mega-telomeres and the number of microchromosomes present in a species, such that bird genomes with large numbers of microchromosomes also possessed larger amounts of telomeric DNA sequence. It was thought that these telomeric sequences might protect genes on <b>these</b> <b>tiny</b> chromosomes from erosion during cell division. However, subsequent studies showed that mega-telomeres are not necessarily present in all species with microchromosomes, nor are they found on all microchromosomes within a cell. Mega-telomeres are also thought contribute to the high recombination rate of chicken microchromosomes. The longest mega-telomere in chickens is associated with the W (female) chromosome, suggesting that mega-telomeres may also affect sex chromosome organization and the generation of genetic variation.|$|E
25|$|Edgartown is {{well known}} as having {{been one of the}} primary ports for the whaling {{industry}} during the 1800s. Ships {{from all over the world}} would dock in its sheltered bay and captains would build grand mansions for their families with ornate top floor rooms called widow's walks, which overlooked the harbor. A myth developed that wives would watch for months from <b>these</b> <b>tiny</b> rooms, hoping to see the sails of ships that would bring their husbands home from the sea. There is little or no evidence that widow's walks were intended or regularly used for this purpose. They were frequently built around the chimney of the residence, thus creating an easy access route to the structure, allowing the residents of the home to pour sand down burning chimneys in the event of a chimney fire in the hopes of preventing the house from burning down.|$|E

25|$|The {{smallest}} jellyfish are {{the peculiar}} creeping jellyfish in the genera Staurocladia and Eleutheria, which have bell disks from 0.5mm {{to a few}} millimeters in diameter, with short tentacles that extend out beyond this, which these jellyfish use to move {{across the surface of}} seaweed or the bottoms of rocky pools. Many of <b>these</b> <b>tiny</b> creeping jellyfish cannot be seen in the field without a hand lens or microscope; they can reproduce asexually by splitting in half (called fission). Other very small jellyfish, which have bells about one millimeter, are the hydromedusae of many species that have just been released from their parent polyps; some of these live only a few minutes before shedding their gametes in the plankton and then dying, while others will grow in the plankton for weeks or months. The hydromedusae Cladonema radiatum and Cladonema californicum are also very small, living for months, yet never growing beyond a few mm in bell height and diameter. Another small species of jellyfish is the Australian Irukandji, which {{is about the size of}} a fingernail.|$|E
25|$|The G Ring (see last {{image in}} gallery) {{is a very}} thin, faint ring about halfway between the F Ring and the {{beginning}} of the E Ring, with its inner edge about 15,000km inside the orbit of Mimas. It contains a single distinctly brighter arc near its inner edge (similar to the arcs in the rings of Neptune) that extends about one sixth of its circumference, centered on the half-km diameter moonlet Aegaeon, which is held in place by a 7:6 orbital resonance with Mimas. The arc is believed to be composed of icy particles up to a few m in diameter, with the rest of the G Ring consisting of dust released from within the arc. The radial width of the arc is about 250km, compared to a width of 9,000km for the G Ring as a whole. The arc is thought to contain matter equivalent to a small icy moonlet about a hundred m in diameter. Dust released from Aegaeon and other source bodies within the arc by micrometeoroid impacts drifts outward from the arc because of interaction with Saturn's magnetosphere (whose plasma corotates with Saturn's magnetic field, which rotates much more rapidly than the orbital motion of the G Ring). <b>These</b> <b>tiny</b> particles are steadily eroded away by further impacts and dispersed by plasma drag. Over the course of thousands of years the ring gradually loses mass, which is replenished by further impacts on Aegaeon.|$|E

25|$|Geomicrobiology {{traditionally}} {{studies the}} interactions between microbes and minerals. While it is generally reliant on the tools of microbiology, microbial geochemistry uses geological and chemical methods to approach the same topic {{from the perspective of}} the rocks. Geomicrobiology and microbial geochemistry (GMG) is a relatively new interdisciplinary field that more broadly takes on the relationship between microbes, Earth, and environmental systems. Billed as a subset of both geobiology and geochemistry, GMG seeks to understand elemental biogeochemical cycles and the evolution of life on Earth. Specifically, it asks questions about where microbes live, their local and global abundance, their structural and functional biochemistry, how they have evolved, biomineralization, and their preservation potential and presence in the rock record. In many ways, GMG appears to be equivalent to geobiology, but differs in scope: geobiology focuses on the role of all life, while GMG is strictly microbial. Regardless, it is <b>these</b> <b>tiniest</b> creatures that dominated to history of life integrated over time and seem to have had the most far-reaching effects.|$|R

500|$|Her ice castle, {{which she}} creates while singing [...] "Let It Go", was {{designed}} to illustrate the maturing of her powers {{as well as to}} be [...] "a manifestation of her feelings to the world". The palace is initially beautiful; however, after she is made aware of the destruction she has inadvertently caused, and as she is increasingly vilified and hunted by others, it becomes darker and more distorted, with jagged icicles forming on the walls. The film's design team was uncertain about how it should look and drew out designs for various ice castles filled with snow. Lasseter suggested basing the structure and patterns on snowflakes. For example, an enormous snowflake would serve as the foundation, and the palace would be hexagon-shaped. Lasseter also wanted snowflake patterns to influence the manner in which Elsa creates the palace. [...] "Snowflakes are <b>these</b> <b>tiny</b> little ice crystals that form in mid-air. And when there are changes in temperature and humidity, these snowflakes start growing in a pattern that's known as branching and plating," [...] said co-effects supervisor Dale Mayeda.
