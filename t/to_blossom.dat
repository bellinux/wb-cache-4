5|$|In the 1960s, {{the portion}} of Browncroft Boulevard from the Sea Breeze Expressway <b>to</b> <b>Blossom</b> Road was {{upgraded}} into a divided highway. NY286 was rerouted to follow the improved Browncroft Boulevard while NY286A was shifted south onto NY286's former alignment along Blossom Road. The NY286A designation was removed in the early 1970s, but Blossom Road remains state-maintained as NY941V, an unsigned reference route.|$|E
5|$|In the 1930 {{renumbering}} {{of state}} highways in New York, NY35 was extended northeast from Canawaugus (west {{of the village}} of Avon) to Ontario by way of Scottsville, Rochester, and Walworth. NY35 entered Rochester on Scottsville Road and followed Genesee and Main streets through the city. At {{the east end of}} Main Street, NY35 turned south and followed Winton Road <b>to</b> <b>Blossom</b> Road. It curved eastward here to follow Blossom Road east to Browncroft Boulevard in Penfield. At some point between 1934 and 1938, an alternate route of NY35 along the portion of Browncroft Boulevard between Winton and Blossom Roads was designated NY35B.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 20th century, reform {{movements}} in the U.S. (the so-called Progressive movement) made most forms of gambling illegal in most communities. Gambling continued illegally in many places, though, creating new opportunities for criminal enterprises. The 18th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, ratified in 1919, outlawed the manufacture, transportation, importation, and sale of alcoholic beverages and initiated the Prohibition era. The new law was widely unpopular, and bootlegging became rampant. Galveston's already lax social attitudes allowed this, as well as brothels and other illegal businesses, <b>to</b> <b>blossom</b> in the city. These institutions were so accepted that at one point, the city required health inspections for prostitutes {{to ensure the safety}} of their clients.|$|E

5|$|On 19 August 1800, when Anning was 15 months old, {{an event}} {{occurred}} that {{became part of}} local lore. She was being held by a neighbour, Elizabeth Haskings, who was standing with two other women under an elm tree watching an equestrian show being put on by a travelling company of horsemen, when lightning struck the tree killing all three women below. Onlookers rushed the infant home where she was revived in a bath of hot water. A local doctor declared her survival miraculous. Her family {{said she had been}} a sickly baby before the event but afterwards she seemed <b>to</b> <b>blossom.</b> For years afterward members of her community would attribute the child's curiosity, intelligence and lively personality to the incident.|$|E
5|$|Although lemur {{taxonomy}} had developed, it was {{not until}} the 1950s and 1960s that the in-situ (or on-site) study of lemur behavior and ecology began <b>to</b> <b>blossom.</b> Jean-Jacques Petter and Arlette Petter-Rousseaux toured Madagascar in 1956 and 1957, surveying many of its lemur species and making important observations about their social groupings and reproduction. In 1960, the year of Madagascar's independence, David Attenborough introduced lemurs to the West with a commercial film. Under the guidance of John Buettner-Janusch, who founded the Duke Lemur Center in 1966, Alison Jolly traveled to Madagascar in 1962 to study the diet and social behavior of the ring-tailed lemur and Verreaux's sifaka at Berenty Private Reserve. The Petters and Jolly spawned a new era of interest in lemur ecology and behavior and were shortly followed by anthropologists such as Alison Richard, Robert Sussman, Ian Tattersall, and many others. Following the political turmoil of the mid-1970s and Madagascar's revolution, field studies resumed in the 1980s, thanks in part to the renewed involvement of the Duke Lemur Center under the direction of Elwyn L. Simons and the conservation efforts of Patricia Wright. In the decades that followed, huge strides have been made in lemur studies and many new species have been discovered.|$|E
5|$|As {{a visual}} novel, School Days {{contains}} extremely minimal gameplay. The game's core onscreen presentation {{is composed of}} scenes that are viewed from a mostly third-person perspective. At predetermined intervals, the game pauses, and players are presented with one to two responses or actions relevant to the scene in progress to make, or not make, on behalf of characters. Each selection branches the game's progress {{up to that point}} in an alternate direction, while also causing the player's love toward a character <b>to</b> <b>blossom,</b> plateau, or diminish, thus providing for a nonlinear storytelling experience. Being an erotic title, relationships between characters may become sexual; scenes of this kind depict a varying combination of French kissing, masturbation, oral sex and intercourse. Genitalia are pixelated in the original Japanese releases, but the Western release of School Days HQ is uncensored. Sex scenes are omitted from the PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable ports of the game.|$|E

25|$|Astrobiology is an {{interdisciplinary}} field {{that uses a}} combination of geobiological and planetary science data to establish a context for the search for life on other planets. The origin of life from non-living chemistry and geology, or abiogenesis, is a major topic in astrobiology. Even though it is fundamentally an earth-bound concern, and therefore of great geobiological interest, getting at {{the origin of life}} necessitates considering what life requires, what, if anything, is special about Earth, what might have changed to allow life <b>to</b> <b>blossom,</b> what constitutes evidence for life, and even what constitutes life itself. These are the same questions that scientists might ask when searching for alien life. In addition, astrobiologists research the possibility of life based on other metabolisms and elements, the survivability of Earth’s organisms on other planets or spacecrafts, planetary and solar system evolution, and space geochemistry.|$|E
25|$|The Senators {{knew from}} {{observation}} that Chára {{would be a}} reliable defender, and were also {{aware that he was}} growing into his body and improving his skills each year. However, Chára grew in ways that exceeded all expectations. In 2001–02, during his first year in Ottawa, he recorded new career highs in goals (10) and points (23) as he turned into a bona fide two-way defenseman. His powerful slapshot continued to improve, and Ottawa began to deploy him on the power play to use it, something the Islanders had rarely done. It resulted in four of Chára's goals being scored with the man advantage that season. The following year, in 2002–03, Chára began <b>to</b> <b>blossom</b> into an elite NHL defenseman. He posted new career highs with 30 assists and 39 points and became one of Ottawa's top two defenders, along with Wade Redden.

25|$|Shanghai was {{the birthplace}} of Chinese cinema and theater. China's first short film, The Difficult Couple (1913), and the country's first fictional feature film, An Orphan Rescues His Grandfather (孤儿救祖记, Gu'er Jiu Zuji, 1923) were both {{produced}} in Shanghai. These two films were very influential, and established Shanghai {{as the center of}} Chinese film-making. Shanghai's film industry went on <b>to</b> <b>blossom</b> during the early 1930s, generating great stars such as Hu Die, Ruan Lingyu, Zhou Xuan, Jin Yan, and Zhao Dan. Another film star, Jiang Qing, went on to become Madame Mao Zedong. The exile of Shanghainese filmmakers and actors {{as a result of the}} Second Sino-Japanese War and the Communist revolution contributed enormously to the development of the Hong Kong film industry. Many aspects of Shanghainese popular culture ("Shanghainese Pops") were transferred to Hong Kong by the numerous Shanghainese emigrants and refugees after the Communist Revolution. The movie In the Mood for Love, which was directed by Wong Kar-wai (a native Shanghainese himself), depicts a slice of the displaced Shanghainese community in Hong Kong and the nostalgia for that era, featuring 1940s music by Zhou Xuan.|$|E
