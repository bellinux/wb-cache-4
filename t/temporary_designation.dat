5|$|In 1986 Voyager 2 {{detected}} {{a broad and}} faint sheet of material inward of ring 6. This ring was given the <b>temporary</b> <b>designation</b> 1986U2R. It had a normal optical depth of 10−3 or less and was extremely faint. It was visible only in a single Voyager 2 image. The ring was located between 37,000 and 39,500km from the centre of Uranus, or only about 12,000km above the clouds. It was not observed again until 2003–2004, when the Keck telescope found a broad and faint sheet of material just inside ring 6. This ring was dubbed the ζ ring. However, {{the position of the}} recovered ζ ring differs significantly from that observed in 1986. Now it is situated between 37,850 and 41,350km from the centre of the planet. There is an inward gradually fading extension reaching to at least 32,600km, or possibly even to 27,000km—to the atmosphere of Uranus. These extensions are labelled as the ζc and ζcc rings respectively.|$|E

25|$|A {{state highway}} (SH) is funded and {{maintained}} by the state. State highways have been assigned numbers between 1 and 365 with a few exceptions. There is also a State Highway 495 (renumbered from Farm to Market Road 495), as well as canceled routes SH 550 (a <b>temporary</b> <b>designation</b> for what {{is now part of}} I-169) and SH 824 (a <b>temporary</b> <b>designation</b> for what was later part of SH 24). NASA Road 1 and State Highway OSR are also in the State Highway network. The first 26 state highways were designated in 1917. Highways are not organized by directionality of the highway, instead they are generally numbered as they were when first built in the 1920s and 1930s. Most suffixed routes were eliminated by 1939, though SH 75A existed from 1946 to 1994 to match Oklahoma's SH 75A.|$|E
25|$|Larissa, {{also known}} as Neptune VII, is the fifth-closest inner {{satellite}} of Neptune. It was first discovered by Harold J. Reitsema, William B. Hubbard, Larry A. Lebofsky, and David J.

5|$|Beginning in 1958, I-75 in Michigan was {{constructed}} in several discontinuous segments. M-76 was {{to become one of}} the portions incorporated into the route of I-75. Although other portions of I-75 were completed and designated in noncontiguous segments, the portion from Standish to Roscommon was first signed as M-76 and the entire stretch rebuilt as freeway before it was redesignated as I-75. This was done while a <b>temporary</b> connecting ToI-75 <b>designation</b> between Bay City and Grayling followed a different path along US10 and US127.|$|R
50|$|Numerous other U.S. Navy vessels were {{launched}} with a <b>temporary,</b> or nominal, <b>designation,</b> such as YMS or PC, since {{it could not}} be determined, at time of construction, what they should be used for. Many of these were vessels in the 150 to 200 feet length class with powerful engines, whose function could be that of a minesweeper, patrol craft, submarine chaser, seaplane tender, tugboat, or other. Once their destiny, or capability, was found or determined, such vessels were reclassified with their actual designation.|$|R
40|$|F 2 progeny from crosses between twenty-seven translocations {{and eleven}} genetic {{characters}} of Sorghum bicolor (L.)

25|$|In {{addition}} to the CCC's designation as Business US 90, the bridge, along with its approach roads, the Pontchartrain Expressway and Westbank Expressway were proposed to also serve as Interstate 910. This proposed designation was federal only and no signs identify the bridge as I-910. This is a <b>temporary</b> <b>designation</b> until Interstate 49 is completed between New Orleans and Lafayette, Louisiana, at which time the bridge will be signed as I-49. This proposed designation currently does not have funding to support all the needed infrastructure to accomplish the plan and has largely been dropped.|$|E
25|$|In 1961, the {{designation}} was revived {{in the suburbs}} of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. It was designated on a section of Eisenhower Boulevard between then US 230 and the interchange at Interstate 83, replacing the retired US 230 Bypass route.

40|$|A {{programme}} {{aiming to}} transfer leaf rust resistance genes identified {{in a collection}} of wild Triticum species was initiated in 1993. In 2000, 25 promising backcross populations were available, 19 of which bred true for resistance.

A subset of five lines in which resistance (derived from T. dicoccoides, T. sharonense, T. speltoides and T. peregrinum) appeared to be integrated on wheat chromosomes and six addition lines with added chromosomes from T. kotschyi, T. peregrinum, T. umbellulatum, T. macrochaetum and T. neglectum appeared to have wide spectrum resistances, and were retained. In several instances promising stem rust and/or stripe rust resistance genes were co-transferred with leaf rust resistance.

30|$|As per gene-for-gene principal, {{resistance}} gene(s) {{identified in}} a given cultivar is depended on not only the resistance gene composition of the host, but also the avirulence genes involved in the isolates being tested. As to the JDCs, the first additional gene, Pik-s, which was carried by the Japanese susceptible cultivar Shin 2, is recognized by its interaction with the Mo isolate Ken Ph- 03 from the Philippines (Kiyosawa 1969). The second one, Pish, present in seven of the JDCs, is recognized by a race isolated from the former resistance cultivar. The cultivar Reiho carries Pita- 2 (Imbe and Matsumoto 1985). The third one, Pi 19, present in 11 of the 12 JDC entries, and is recognized by the Chinese Mo isolate CHNOS 58 – 3 - 1 (Hayashi et al. 1998). Similarly, three additional genes, namely Pi 1, Pi 54 (formerly Pik-h) borne by Tetep, and Pik-l by LTH, have been identified using races isolated from either China or India (Rai et al. 2011; Hua et al. 2012; Singh et al. 2015). It was noteworthy that the cultivar Tetep has been recognized as {{being one of the}} most important donors of multiple blast resistance genes (Mackill and Bonman 1992; Hua et al. 2012), while LTH is classed as a highly susceptible cultivar for the development of monogenic lines which harbors just a single blast resistance gene (Tsunematsu et al. 2000; Kawasaki-Tanaka et al. 2016). Another striking outcome of the present study is that the CDC set harbors at least five additional blast resistance genes (here assigned the <b>temporary</b> <b>designations</b> α through ε). A comparison of the resistance profiles of Sifeng 43 and BL 1, which are both known to carry Pib, showed that the former is resistant to a greater number of the isolates from the LN and HLJ populations. This is presumed to reflect the presence of α. Similarly, the existence of the genes β, γ, and δ was inferred from the resistance profiles of, respectively, Dongnong 363 in LN, Kanto 51 in GD, and Hejiang 18 in both GD and HN (Table 4). The unidentified blast resistance genes harbored by Zhenlong 13 produced a rather similar resistance profile to that of Dongnong 363, except for isolates sampled from GD; the implication was that the blast resistance gene content of Zhenlong 13 is the same as that of Dongnong 363, with the addition of the gene ε, which conditions resistance to some GD isolates. Owning more specific and effective resistance genes in the CDC set that might be another key reason why it was more suitable for Chinese Mo populations, compared with the JDC set (Table 4). Similarly, the abundant resistance genes involving in the international differential cultivars, especially Raminad Str. 3, Zenith, NP 125, Dular, and Sha-tiao-tsao, which was also a key determinant for its long-term use at least in America (Wang et al. 2017).|$|R
50|$|In 1948, {{a portion}} of the Wilbur Cross Parkway between Route 34 and Whitney Avenue had still been under construction.

By 1949, the Wilbur Cross Parkway was completed and the <b>temporary</b> Route 15 <b>designation</b> was removed from the surface streets. Further improvements in the Wilbur Cross Highway took place {{over the next several years}} and the road became a four-lane divided highway by 1954. In 1968, most of the Wilbur Cross Highway was designated as I-86 and further upgrades to the road were implemented. Route 15 and I-86 overlapped from the current 15/84 junction in East Hartford to the Massachusetts state line. In 1984, the overlap was removed, truncating Route 15 to its current northern end, while at the same time I-86 was redesignated as I-84.|$|R
