50|$|In the <b>transitron</b> <b>circuit,</b> {{the screen}} and {{suppressor}} grids are coupled with a bypass capacitor (C2) which has a low impedance at the oscillation frequency, {{so they have a}} constant potential difference. The parallel tuned circuit (C1-L) is connected between the screen grid and the cathode (through battery B1). The negative resistance of the screen grid cancels the positive resistance of the tuned circuit, causing oscillations. As in the dynatron oscillator the control grid can be used to adjust the negative resistance.|$|E
5000|$|In the dynatron and <b>transitron</b> <b>circuits,</b> {{a vacuum}} tube is biased {{so that one}} of its {{electrodes}} has negative differential resistance. [...] This means that when the voltage on the electrode with respect to the cathode is increased, the current through it decreases. [...] A tuned circuit is connected between the electrode and the cathode. The negative resistance of the tube cancels the positive resistance of the tuned circuit, creating in effect a tuned circuit with zero AC resistance. [...] A spontaneous continuous sinusoidal oscillating voltage is generated, started by electrical noise in the circuit when it is turned on.|$|R
