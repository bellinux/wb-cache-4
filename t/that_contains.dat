The chondrostean kidney is an important hemopoietic organ; where erythrocytes, granulocytes, lymphocytes and macrophages develop.|$|E
5|$|Common {{chemical}} theory {{at that time}} held that an acid is a compound <b>that</b> <b>contains</b> oxygen (remnants of this survive in the German and Dutch names of oxygen: sauerstoff or zuurstof, both translating into English as acid substance), so a number of chemists, including Claude Berthollet, suggested that Scheele's dephlogisticated muriatic acid air must {{be a combination of}} oxygen and the yet undiscovered element, muriaticum.|$|E

5|$|Lactarius fallax is {{classified}} in the section Plinthogalus of the subgenus Plinthogalus of the genus Lactarius.
