25|$|The {{windscreen}} wipers were {{powered by a}} purely mechanical system: a cable connected to the transmission; to reduce cost, this cable also powered <b>the</b> <b>speedometer.</b> The wipers' speed was therefore dependent on car speed. When the car was waiting at a crossroad, the wipers were not powered; thus, a handle under <b>the</b> <b>speedometer</b> allowed them to be operated by hand. From 1962, the wipers were powered by a single-speed electric motor. The car came with only a speedometer and an ammeter.|$|E
25|$|In {{the vehicle}} {{instrument}} display, between <b>the</b> <b>speedometer</b> and tachometer, the available shift-lever positions are shown, the current {{position of the}} shift-lever is highlighted (emboldened), and the current gear ratio in use is also displayed as a number.|$|E
25|$|The 1967 {{model year}} {{also saw the}} {{addition}} of the new safety standards for passenger cars mandated by the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). The regulations began with seat belts on automobiles produced after March 1, 1967. The 1967 Rambler Americans also included a collapsible, energy-absorbing steering column and steering wheel, more padding on interior surfaces, 4-way hazard flashers, and locking seat back latches for 2-door models. The instrument cluster was changed from the previous rectangular design to round gauges: <b>The</b> <b>speedometer</b> and odometer was center, with twin, smaller fuel and engine temperature gauges, with matching warning-light pods on both sides of <b>the</b> <b>speedometer.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>speedometers</b> in <b>the</b> {{vehicles}} are calibrated {{from the factory}} and do not require recalibration unless the wheel and overall rolling diameters are changed.|$|R
50|$|Around 1896 Stewart and Clark {{founded the}} Sterk Manufacturing Company which {{produced}} speedometers and automobile horns. The flexible shafts from the Chicago Flexible Shaft Company {{were used in}} the production of cables needed for <b>the</b> <b>speedometers.</b>|$|R
40|$|This is {{an article}} from the journal, Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part B: Journal of Engineering Manufacture [© IMechE]. It is also {{available}} at: [URL] growing demands for high-quality products with improved specifications increase the requirements for condition monitoring and quality evaluation {{to ensure that no}} defective or below-specification products reach the customer. This paper presents a low-cost condition-monitoring system using acoustics to evaluate the quality of mechanically driven automotive speedometers during manufacture. Signal conditioning methods employ discrete cosine transformation to simplify the frequency spectrum of the signals. A novelty detection approach is optimized to characterize the 'normal' conditions of <b>the</b> <b>speedometers</b> and to reject any speedometers that are not so categorized {{on the basis of the}} sound waves produced from experimental running of <b>the</b> <b>speedometers.</b> <b>The</b> suggested techniques are found useful in developing an automated condition-monitoring system for deselecting low-quality automotive speedometers...|$|R
25|$|Other {{aspects of}} the Pacer were {{designed}} for ease of service, including the dashboard and instrument panel—using a minimum number of easily accessible screws and featuring removable cover/bezel without the need to disconnect <b>the</b> <b>speedometer</b> cable—and access to the light bulbs. The Pacer's design was ranked as equal with the new Aspen-Volare compacts as the most serviceable in the industry.|$|E
25|$|As {{a visual}} aid, the {{background}} of the Insight’s digital speedometer glows green when the car is being driven in an efficient manner. Somewhat less-efficient driving makes the meter glow blue-green. Aggressive starts and stops that consume extra fuel make the meter glow blue. By observing the color shift of <b>the</b> <b>speedometer</b> background, the driver receives assistance in developing driving habits that typically enhance fuel economy.|$|E
25|$|All sets use {{the same}} driver's cab, with a gray color, and a single 'T' shaped brake and {{throttle}} controller. There are four throttle steps, and seven brake steps. The speedometers are equipped with ATC. To the right of <b>the</b> <b>speedometer</b> is an information screen, showing the run type (local, express, etc.), and information of the individual cars. This touch screen computer can also control interior temperature and lights.|$|E
50|$|Also new for 1985, all Camaros {{featured}} refreshed noses, and new deeper valances {{and front}} spoiler for the Z28 {{and the newly}} introduced IROC-Z. <b>The</b> <b>speedometers</b> {{no longer had the}} unique double-pointed needle that simultaneously read mph and km/h: they were replaced by conventional single-pointer 85 mi/h km/h units.|$|R

25|$|Also, in 1973 or 1974, {{one of the}} Silver Fern railcars (RM 1, RM 2 or RM 3) {{reached a}} speed in excess of 128 km/h (80 mph) while {{descending}} south from National Park Station to Waiouru. The author noted the speed on <b>the</b> <b>speedometer</b> in the trailing driver's cabin: the indicator had gone past the 80 mph position. The railcar was 25 minutes late leaving National Park station, yet it arrived 30 minutes early at Wellington Station.|$|E
25|$|The 1975 models {{received}} a revised grille and taillight trim and six-window styling on four-door models. The dashboard, radio and climate control graphics were revised; <b>the</b> <b>speedometer</b> read up to , and had smaller numbers for kilometers per hour. The Caprice convertible would be discontinued after the 1975 model year {{along with its}} full-size B-body counterparts including the Oldsmobile Delta 88, Buick LeSabre, and Pontiac Grand Ville. Just about 8,350 Caprice Classic convertibles found buyers in 1975.|$|E
25|$|Citroën {{unveiled}} {{the car at}} the Paris Salon on 7 October 1948. The car on display was nearly identical to the 2CV type A that would be sold the next year, but it lacked an electric starter, the addition of which was decided {{the day before the}} opening of the Salon, replacing the pull cord starter. The canvas roof could be rolled completely open. The Type A had one stop light, and was only available in grey. The fuel level was checked with a dip stick/measuring rod, and <b>the</b> <b>speedometer</b> was attached to the windscreen pillar. The only other instrument was an ammeter.|$|E
25|$|The new XJ {{features}} an innovative, all-LCD dashboard and console displays. The dashboard can be configured to display various virtual dials {{in addition to}} <b>the</b> obligatory <b>speedometer.</b> <b>The</b> console display presents different views to the driver and passenger, including control of a sophisticated video and audio system.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> Stewart- Warner <b>Speedometer</b> Corporation Building {{was built}} in 1925 as the Detroit home of <b>the</b> Stewart-Warner <b>Speedometer</b> Corporation. It was later used as a wheel and brake service center, and the Burroughs Corporation credit union. Wayne State University has used this {{building}} to house their parking and mail departments.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> {{electric}} <b>speedometer</b> {{was invented}} by the Croatian Josip Belušić in 1888, and was originally called a velocimeter.|$|R
25|$|The 1962 Valiant {{was given}} a {{completely}} new instrument cluster. Like that of the larger 1962 Plymouth models, the new Valiant cluster was highly regarded for its clean design and easy readability. A large round speedometer was placed at {{the left of the}} cluster, with separate round gauges for fuel level, engine temperature, and charging system condition (amperes) in a row to the right of <b>the</b> <b>speedometer.</b> Automatic transmission pushbuttons were in a column at the left edge of the panel, and heater pushbuttons were in a column at the right edge. A new shallower-dish steering wheel was also introduced.|$|E
25|$|Mobile speed cameras may be hand-held, tripod mounted, or vehicle-mounted. In vehicle-mounted systems, {{detection}} equipment and cameras can be mounted {{to the vehicle}} itself, or simply tripod mounted inside the vehicle and deployed out a window or door. If the camera is fixed to the vehicle, the enforcement vehicle does not necessarily have to be stationary, and can be moved either with or against the flow of traffic. In the latter case, depending on the direction of travel, the target vehicle's relative speed is either added or subtracted from the enforcement vehicle's own speed to obtain its actual speed. <b>The</b> <b>speedometer</b> of the camera vehicle needs to be accurately calibrated.|$|E
25|$|The {{control of}} the time machine is the same in all three films. The {{operator}} is seated inside the DeLorean (except the first time, when a remote control is used), and turns on the time circuits, activating a unit containing multiple fourteen- and seven-segment displays that show the destination (red), present (green), and last-departed (yellow) dates and times. After entering a target date, the operator accelerates the car to , which activates the flux capacitor. As it accelerates, several coils around the body glow blue/white while a burst of light appears in front of it. Surrounded by electrical current similar to a Tesla coil, the whole car vanishes {{in a flash of}} white/blue light seconds later, leaving a pair of fiery tire tracks. A digital speedometer is attached to the dashboard so that the operator can accurately gauge the car's speed. Various proposals have been brought forth in the past by fans of the movie franchise for why the car has to be moving at 88mph to achieve temporal displacement, but actually the production crew chose the velocity simply because they liked how it looked on <b>the</b> <b>speedometer.</b>|$|E

50|$|Metrication {{is mostly}} complete. Road signs solely use metric measurements, as do <b>the</b> <b>speedometers</b> and odometers in motor {{vehicles}} produced after 1974; There was no requirement for pre-1974 vehicles {{to have their}} speedometers and odometers converted to metric, so any remaining vehicles of this vintage will show miles. Privately imported vehicles, such as classic cars, also {{do not need to}} be so converted. The sale of oil and petrol is by the litre. However, vehicle tyre pressures are still commonly talked about in pounds per square inch.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>speedometers</b> in {{vehicles}} manufactured {{before these}} dates but after 1 July 1995 (or 1 January 1995 for forward control passenger vehicles and off-road passenger vehicles) must {{conform to the}} previous Australian design rule. This specifies that they need only display the speed to an accuracy of +/- 10% at speeds above 40 km/h, {{and there is no}} specified accuracy at all for speeds below 40 km/h.All vehicles manufactured in Australia or imported for supply to the Australian market must comply with the Australian Design Rules.|$|R
500|$|Additional detail touches {{were added}} to the VE, such as a new four-strut hinge system for the boot to replace space intrusive, much {{maligned}} [...] "gooseneck" [...] hinges as used on previous Commodores. High-specification variants see expandable door pockets and a Saab-like [...] "blackout" [...] feature which illuminates only <b>the</b> <b>speedometer</b> at night to enhance driver focus on the road. An innovative flush-fitting handbrake set into a symmetrical centre console means the lever can be easily reversed to sit {{on the opposite side of}} console for left-hand drive export markets, minimising redesign costs.|$|E
500|$|The band {{illustrated}} the theme {{on the cover}} of Double Nickels on the Dime, which depicts Watt driving his Volkswagen Beetle at exactly 55 miles per hour ("double nickels" [...] in trucker slang) traveling southbound through downtown Los Angeles on Route 110, also known as the Harbor Freeway, toward the band's hometown of San Pedro, California. [...] "The title means fifty-five miles per hour on the button, like we were Johnny Conservative." [...] Dirk Vandenberg, the band's [...] "buddy/contributor," [...] took photos from the backseat as Watt drove under the sign to San Pedro; it took three circuits of the highway and two days of photography before Minutemen were happy with the cover. Vandenberg later commented on the cover art: [...] "There were three elements that Mike [...] wanted in the photo: a natural kind of glint in his eyes reflected in the rearview mirror, <b>the</b> <b>speedometer</b> pinned exactly at 55mph, and, of course, the San Pedro sign guiding us home". However, when the cover was presented to SST, [...] "someone botched the cropping for the print and cut off the end of the word Pedro." ...|$|E
2500|$|Also at mid-year, a new [...] "Fasten Seat Belts" [...] {{light with}} buzzer was added per Federal safety regulation. This light {{was located in}} <b>the</b> <b>speedometer</b> pod and <b>the</b> <b>speedometer</b> was changed from {{displaying}} a high of , back to [...]|$|E
50|$|Initial {{media reports}} stated Diana's car had {{collided}} with the pillar at 190 km/h, and that <b>the</b> <b>speedometer's</b> needle had jammed at that position. It was later announced the car's speed on collision was about 95-110 km/h (60-70 mph). The car was certainly travelling much faster than the speed limit of 50 km/h. In 1999, a French investigation concluded the Mercedes had {{come into contact with}} another vehicle (a white Fiat Uno) in the tunnel.

5000|$|The pointer shaft is held toward zero by a fine torsion spring. The torque on the cup {{increases}} {{with the speed}} of rotation of the magnet. Thus an increase in the speed of the car will twist <b>the</b> cup and <b>speedometer</b> pointer against <b>the</b> spring. The cup and pointer will turn until the torque of the eddy currents on the cup is balanced by the opposing torque of the spring, and then stop. Given the torque on the cup is proportional to the car's speed, and the spring's deflection is proportional to the torque, the angle of the pointer is also proportional to the speed, so that equally spaced markers on the dial can be used for gaps in speed. At a given speed the pointer will remain motionless and pointing to the appropriate number on <b>the</b> <b>speedometer's</b> dial.|$|R
5000|$|Novarese {{designed}} {{a wide range}} of typefaces. His most famous design is probably Eurostile, a geometric sans-serif design. It utilized shapes based on subtly curved rectangles with rounded corners, reflecting the modern designs that were gaining popularity at the time, influenced by the subtly curved shape of a cathode ray tube screen or airplane windows. It became very popular as a typeface that evokes technology (it can be seen on <b>the</b> <b>speedometers</b> on many cars and vehicles, particularly older models). This was an expansion and development of the earlier design Microgramma typeface (designed in a project led by Alessandro Butti), an all-caps design.|$|R
