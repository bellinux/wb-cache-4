5|$|At {{the church}} council, Reverend Lovejoy tells Marge to use Christmas to bribe her back. Marge bakes cookies, decorates the home, and has Ralph and Milhouse dress as a pony in {{wrapping}} paper to tempt her, but Lisa {{runs from the}} home when she realizes what is happening. At the Buddhist temple she tells Richard Gere her family tried to trick her, but Gere informs her that while Buddhism is about one finding inner peace, it is also about respecting the diversity of other religions based on love and compassion - thus, Lisa is free to celebrate any holiday with her family including Christmas. Lisa goes back home, falling asleep beside the Christmas tree and tells everyone {{that she will be}} celebrating Christmas with them and continue paying lip service to Christianity while practicing Buddhism {{for the rest of her}} life. As Marge takes her <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>to</b> get some cookies for her, Lisa asks about her pony, and Marge tries unsuccessfully to change the subject as Lisa calls out for her gift.|$|E
5|$|Desperately {{trying to}} figure out a {{connection}} between the murdered families, Graham realizes that someone must have seen their home movies. He and Crawford deduce where the films were processed. They identify the lab in St. Louis and fly there immediately. Dollarhyde has been casing the victims' homes through home movies, enabling him to prepare for the break-ins in extreme detail. Graham determines which employees that match their profile information have seen these films and obtains Dollarhyde's home address, to which he and Crawford travel with a police escort. At Dollarhyde's home, Reba is terrified as he contemplates what to do with her. As he struggles to kill Reba with a piece of broken mirror glass, police teams assemble around the house. Seeing that Dollarhyde has someone inside with him, Graham lunges through a window. He is quickly subdued by Dollarhyde, who retrieves a shotgun and uses it to wound Crawford and kill two police officers. Wounded in the firefight, Dollarhyde returns <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>to</b> shoot Graham, but misses because of his injuries and is killed himself when Graham returns fire. Graham, Reba, and Crawford are tended to by paramedics before Graham returns home and retires permanently.|$|E

At this point Palmer assumed responsibility for Cook; Cook's solicitor, Jeremiah Smith, sent {{over a bowl}} of soup, which Palmer had in his possession before he sent it <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>to</b> be reheated. Chambermaid Elizabeth Mills took two spoonfuls of the soup and subsequently fell ill; Cook was given {{the rest of the}} soup, and his vomiting became worse than ever.|$|E
50|$|During the First World War, Horsbrugh pioneered a {{travelling}} kitchen {{scheme in}} Chelsea, London, which gained sufficient renown as to warrant an invitation <b>to</b> bring <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>to</b> Buckingham Palace one lunch hour to entertain Queen Mary, who approved particularly of the sweets.|$|R

According to his mother, Carrigan would abandon new toys as an infant and crawl <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> {{cabinets}} <b>to</b> beat on <b>the</b> family’s pots and pans. Later, his father purchased Carrigan a set of drums after the young child had created his own makeshift set, which included an old banjo and brush for a snare; boxes as tom-toms; and old Edison records on sticks as cymbals.|$|R
50|$|In Bali, a {{woman is}} not allowed <b>to</b> enter <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>to</b> perform her usual duties, nor is she allowed {{to have sex with}} her husband while menstruating.

One of the most {{important}} regulations is that {{a woman is}} not allowed to attend temple while menstruating.|$|R
25|$|In {{the castle}} Beauty meets another slave, Prince Alexi, {{with whom she}} copulates passionately. After that he tells her about the long adventurous journey {{he had in the}} castle. Alexi {{previously}} had been a stubborn prince who fought back all the attempts to break him, until the Queen sent him <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>to</b> have him tortured by crude kitchen servants. Alexi received such a savage and merciless punishment there that he began to lose his senses and, after some particularly humiliating training {{at the hands of a}} strong stable boy, Alexi became a totally surrendered slave, playing various sexual games at the Queen's commands.|$|E
25|$|In 1979, the Soviets invaded Afghanistan. A year later, Zohra Daoud, {{her husband}} Mohammad Daoud, {{along with their}} infant, fled to Germany. In 1980, she arrived at Virginia's Norfolk International Airport, where she {{realized}} that {{her life as a}} high class citizen was over. With a degree in French literature from Kabul University, Zohra Daoud managed to get a job in a French bakery in Richmond. When she arrived at the job, she was handed a mop and sent <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>to</b> sweep the floors. Despite being a trained commercial pilot, Zohra Daoud’s husband, Mohammad Daoud, worked at McDonald's, and then as a taxi driver. Zohra and Mohammad Daoud later began taking English classes, tutorial and exams in order to improve their English language.

25|$|Mary and Cathleen {{return home}} from their {{drive to the}} drugstore, where Mary has sent Cathleen in to {{purchase}} her morphine prescription. Not wanting to be alone, Mary does not allow Cathleen to go <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>to</b> finish dinner and offers her a drink instead. Mary {{does most of the}} talking and discusses her love for fog but her hatred of the foghorn and her husband’s obvious obsession with money. It is obvious that Mary has already taken some of her “prescription.” She talks about her past in a Catholic convent and the promise she once had as a pianist {{and the fact that it}} was once thought that she might become a nun. She also makes it clear that while she fell in love with her husband from the time she met him, she had never taken to the theatre crowd. She shows her arthritic hands to Cathleen and explains that the pain in her hands is why she needs her prescription – an explanation which is untrue and transparent to Cathleen.|$|E

50|$|In many Greek {{restaurants}} in Greece, {{it is not}} considered impolite for guests <b>to</b> enter <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>to</b> see what is cooking before ordering, although this may not occur in fine dining and hotel restaurants. After this, a waiter may be notified of guest choices. Table service is often relaxed and laid-back, and patrons may need to flag down wait staff to order and request items. Wine is commonly consumed during lunch and dinner. Ouzo is typically available in Greek restaurants.|$|R
500|$|Arranged {{along the}} west curtain wall was an extra hall and a kitchen; it is not certain what these were used for, {{although}} {{it is probable that}} these were intended to provide for the household's retainers. The [...] "retainers' hall" [...] had no windows on its west side and would have been relatively dark compared to the great hall. Also, whereas the great hall had a large fireplace, the [...] "retainers' hall" [...] had none. The hall was adjacent <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen,</b> <b>to</b> which it was directly connected, with no screens passage in between. Above the [...] "retainers' hall", which was confined to the ground floor, was a room with no fireplace and of unclear purpose.|$|E
500|$|... "On {{the night}} before such an event neither Mamma, Pappa, or Daughter Gale could get those minutes' solid sleep for thought {{that they might have}} {{overlooked}} some essential in the guests' comfort. At the first crow of the rooster they would come hopping down <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>to</b> get the larder into shape. So little wonder that on occasion of the dinner here pictured - when the prize dish was a splendid homemade mince pie - the Gales were ever looking after the need of the said pie. First Mamma Gale would tiptoe to the table whereupon it sat in solemn state, and give it a stir; then Pappa Gale would tiptoe over and give it a stir; finally Daughter Gale would have to come over and honor it likewise. Then arrived the guests. The Minister and the Mrs. Minister, they were, and some neighbors. While she was receiving them the recollection came to Mamma Gale that the beloved mince pie had not received its flavoring. Off she speeds to a decanter of whiskey in the kitchen. She pours into the pie the right proportion of liquor, and goes back to her guests. Then Pappa Gale remembers that the pie has not been flavored. He, too, excuses himself and a moment later is found pouring whiskey into the sacred mince. No sooner has he ceased and returned to his guest than Daughter Gale, who has just remembered about the forgotten flavoring, rushes in and makes for the whiskey. She pours 'the right proportion' in, too." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2010, UK public {{television}} network Channel 4 debuted Iron Chef UK, based on Iron Chef. The show airs {{five days a}} week, and is hosted by Olly Smith and Nick Nairn. The four Iron Chefs are Tom Aikens, Martin Blunos, Sanjay Dwivedi and Judy Joo. Like the original Iron Chef, the competitions are held in Kitchen Stadium and presided over by The Chairman. Judging occurs in two rounds, with the first round being appetizers, and the second being the main courses.

The two challengers each prepare one dish, while the Iron Chef prepares two. Judging resumes, {{and the results are}} announced.

25|$|King Ludwig II of Bavaria in his castles of Linderhof and Herrenchiemsee, built {{during the}} same period as the Palais Strousberg took the invisibility of his {{servants}} one step further by having designed dining room tables which were lowered through <b>the</b> floor <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchens</b> below <b>to</b> be replenished between courses, negating the need for a servant's immediate presence completely. However, while the Palais Strousberg's layout of its servants' quarters was common throughout the capital cities of Europe, King Ludwig's seem to have been more an eccentricity peculiar to him.|$|R

In the south-west corner of the house, where <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> opens into <b>the</b> sleep-out, there are two windows. One is fixed glass and visible on the rear facade. The other window can only be seen from inside the toilet, which has been added <b>to</b> <b>the</b> building, possibly when it was used as flats. Taking {{the evidence of the}} slope in the ceilings and the location of timber thresholds, fixed glass panels above doors, and exposed framing, it is likely that <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> space was open at some point.|$|R

50|$|In {{the second}} half of the 19th century, clock {{factories}} displaced the traditional manufacture of clockmaking in the home. Initially relatively small firms emerged that specialised in the production of short runs of qualitatively high value clocks based on the traditional prototype. Over time the factories that became successful were those, especially in the Württemberg (eastern) half of the Black Forest and neighbouring Baar region, that embraced new types of clock, like alarm clocks, that were suited to industrial processes. In most households there was a clock suited to each room, from <b>the</b> alarm clock <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> clock <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sideboard or wall clock.|$|R
