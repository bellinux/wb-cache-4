Drunken local teenagers approached the bear's enclosure, apparently hoping <b>to</b> <b>swim</b> <b>in</b> its pool, and one 19-year-old was hospitalized with leg lacerations after he was mauled. The zoo did not confirm that Binky was the attacker, but the bear had blood on his face following the incident.|$|E
5|$|Ellie Victoria Cole {{was born}} in the Melbourne suburb of Lilydale on 12 December 1991. Her mother and {{grandfather}} were both swimmers, and her father was athletic. At two years of age, she was diagnosed with a rare tumour, a sarcoma that was wrapped around the nerves of her right leg. After unsuccessful attempts to treat her cancer with chemotherapy, her right leg was amputated above the knee on 14 February 1994. Eight weeks after the surgery, as part of her rehabilitation, Cole's mother Jenny enrolled her in swimming lessons. Cole's instructors expected her to take up to a year to learn how <b>to</b> <b>swim</b> <b>in</b> a straight line, but it took her two weeks.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Ileana never {{significantly}} impacted land, and no {{tropical cyclone}} warnings or watches for the storm. While near peak intensity, it passed 60mi (100km) {{south of the}} unpopulated Socorro Island; a station on the island recorded sustained winds of 59mph (95km/h), with gusts to 77mph (125km/h). The hurricane dropped heavy rainfall along the Mexican coastline, causing flooding in Nayarit, Jalisco, Colima, Michoacán, and Baja California Sur. High surf from Ileana reached the coast, killing one man near Cabo San Lucas despite warnings not <b>to</b> <b>swim</b> <b>in</b> the ocean.|$|E
5|$|In the Battle of Britain, Mayer often {{flew over}} the English Channel as the wingman of Helmut Wick. He claimed three further {{victories}} in this campaign, all over Royal Air Force (RAF) Supermarine Spitfires, but was himself shot down or forced to land at the French Coast. Once he had <b>to</b> <b>swim</b> <b>in</b> the Channel for an hour before he was rescued. At the end of 1940 Mayer had four victories to his credit and JG2 was withdrawn from combat to replenish the heavy losses it had sustained. Following a short tour as fighter pilot instructor at the Jagdfliegerschule (fighter pilot school) in Werneuchen, Mayer {{was sent back to}} the Channel Front.|$|E
5|$|My father... was {{the richest}} man in Palestine. He marketed about ten percent of all the citrus crops sent from Palestine to Europe—especially to England and Germany. He owned a summer house in Marseilles, France, and another house in İskenderun, then in Syria and {{afterwards}} Turkey, and a number of houses in Palestine itself. Most of the time we lived in Jaffa. Our house had about twenty rooms, and we children would go down <b>to</b> <b>swim</b> <b>in</b> the sea. We also had stables with Arabian horses, and one of our homes in Ashkelon even had a large swimming pool. I think we must have been the only family in Palestine with a private swimming pool.|$|E

His test results however, were declared invalid by Savage and Hyneman, because they determined that Adrian was so used <b>to</b> <b>swimming</b> <b>in</b> water, that his technique was completely disrupted when <b>swimming</b> <b>in</b> the syrup. This disruption caused his lap times when <b>swimming</b> <b>in</b> syrup <b>to</b> vary wildly in comparison with his extremely consistent lap times in water.|$|R
5|$|When Hurricane Hugo {{destroyed}} the island's only Olympic-sized swimming pool in 1989, Duncan was forced <b>to</b> <b>swim</b> <b>in</b> {{the ocean and}} he quickly lost his enthusiasm for swimming because of his fear of sharks. Duncan was dealt another emotional blow when his mother {{was diagnosed with breast}} cancer and died one day before his 14th birthday. In her last days, she made Duncan and his sisters promise to finish college with a degree, which would later explain Duncan's refusal to leave college early. Duncan never swam competitively again, but was inspired by his brother-in-law to turn to basketball.|$|E

He was granted {{a few days in}} Saint Petersburg to put his affairs in order and used this time to meet with the Social-Democrats, who had renamed {{themselves}} the League of Struggle for the Emancipation of the Working Class. His journey to eastern Siberia took 11 weeks, for much of which he was accompanied by his mother and sisters. Deemed only a minor threat to the government, he was exiled to a peasant's hut in Shushenskoye, Minusinsky District, where he was kept under police surveillance; he was nevertheless able to correspond with other revolutionaries, many of whom visited him, and permitted to go on trips <b>to</b> <b>swim</b> <b>in</b> the Yenisei River and to hunt duck and snipe.|$|E

The fastest Australian in the corresponding individual event, he was rested in the qualifying round; Australia came third in their heat and ninth overall to miss the final by 1.88s after Peter Dawson swam his split in a time four seconds slower than Kerry's effort in the individual event. Had Kerry repeated his individual time in the relay in place of Dawson, Australia would have qualified fifth.|$|E
5|$|Morgan married George Beavis in 1965 and {{had three}} daughters, {{all of whom}} enjoyed {{swimming}} victories at school and district level. After her marriage, she lived in the Outback towns of Griffith and Orange for six years before returning to Sydney. She experimented with coaching, but found the competition unappealing and became a schoolteacher. In 1978, she began teaching handicapped children <b>to</b> <b>swim</b> <b>in</b> her backyard pool, and was given a government grant to continue her work. She then ran a swimming school at Bonnet Bay for 15 years and worked at the Bates Drive Special School, receiving a grant to teach preschool handicapped children swimming.

5|$|Nurmi {{was born}} in Turku, Finland, to {{carpenter}} Johan Fredrik Nurmi and his wife Matilda Wilhelmiina Laine. Nurmi's siblings, Siiri, Saara, Martti and Lahja, were born in 1898, 1902, 1905 and 1908, respectively. In 1903, the Nurmi family moved from Raunistula into a 40-square-meter apartment in central Turku, where Paavo Nurmi would live until 1932. The young Nurmi {{and his friends were}} inspired by the English long-distance runner Alfred Shrubb. They regularly ran or walked six kilometres (four miles) <b>to</b> <b>swim</b> <b>in</b> Ruissalo, and back, sometimes twice a day. By the age of eleven, Nurmi ran the 1500 metres in 5:02. Nurmi's father Johan died in 1910 and his sister Lahja a year later. The family struggled financially, renting out their kitchen to another family and living in a single room. Nurmi, a talented student, left school to work as an errand boy for a bakery. Although he stopped running actively, he got plenty of exercise pushing heavy carts up the steep slopes in Turku. He later credited these climbs for strengthening his back and leg muscles.|$|E
