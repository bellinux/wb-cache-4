500|$|Four {{pairs of}} [...] wide {{observation}} windows are provided, spaced [...] apart, inner stone edge to edge, all {{just above the}} lowest course of slabs (504-foot level). Six are [...] high while two on the east face are [...] high for easier egress. All were originally provided with thin marble shutters in a bronze frame each {{of which could be}} opened inward, one left and the other right per wall. After two people committed suicide by jumping through <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>windows</b> in the 1920s, hinged horizontal iron bars were added to them in 1929. A ninth opening in a slab on the south face just below the capstone is provided for access to the outside of the pyramidion. It is covered by a stone slab which is internally removable. In 1931, four red aircraft warning lights were installed, one per face in one of its observation windows. Pilots complained that they could not be easily seen, so the monument was floodlit on all sides as well. In 1958, eight [...] diameter holes for new red aircraft warning lights were bored, one above each window near the top edge of the fourth course of slabs (516-foot level) in the pyramidion. In 1958 the observation windows were glazed with shatterproof glass. In 1974–76, they were glazed with bulletproof glass and the shutters removed. New bulletproof glass was installed during 1997–2000.|$|E
