5|$|Flogging was {{discontinued}} in the 1940s, {{with the}} last incident occurring in 1943.

5|$|The leading Western economies adopted Keynes's policy {{recommendations}} before {{the outbreak of}} World War II, and in the two decades following Keynes's death in 1946, almost all capitalist governments had done so.

He and other economists had disputed the ability of government to regulate the business cycle favourably with fiscal policy.|$|E
5|$|Amid {{difficulties}} in her personal life, Lansbury moved from California to County Cork, Ireland, in 1970, and continued {{with a variety}} of theatrical and cinematic appearances throughout <b>that</b> <b>decade.</b> These included leading roles in the stage musicals Gypsy, , and The King and I, {{as well as in the}} hit Disney film Bedknobs and Broomsticks (1971).

5|$|Board of (Tax) Appeals Commissioner Berrios {{regularly}} accepted {{hundreds of}} thousands of dollars a year in campaign contributions from lawyers who appealed property tax assessments before the Board. Berrios controls five personal political action committees, not including the fund for the Cook County Democratic Party, which he also controls.

5|$|Born to {{a wealthy}} middle-class family in Vienna, List {{claimed that he}} {{abandoned}} his family's Roman Catholic faith in childhood, instead devoting himself to the pre-Christian god Wotan. Spending {{much time in the}} Austrian countryside, he engaged in rowing, hiking, and sketching the landscape. From 1877 he began a career as a journalist, primarily authoring articles on the Austrian countryside for nationalist newspapers and magazines. In these he placed a völkisch emphasis on the folk culture and customs of rural people, believing that many of them were survivals of pre-Christian, pagan religion. He published three novels, Carnuntum (1888), Jung Diethers Heimkehr (1894), and Pipara (1895), each set among the German tribes of the Iron Age, as well as authoring several plays. During the 1890s he continued writing völkisch articles, now largely for the nationalist Ostdeutsche Rundschau newspaper, with his works taking on an anti-semitic dimension halfway through <b>that</b> <b>decade.</b> In 1893, he co-founded the Literarische Donaugesellschaft literary society, and involved himself in Austria's Pan-German nationalist movement, a milieu which sought the integration of Austria into the German Empire.|$|E
5|$|During the 1980s, Malmö FF won Allsvenskan {{five times}} in a row between 1985 and 1989, but were only awarded the Swedish {{championship}} in 1986 and 1988 as the club failed to win the newly constructed play-off stage during 1985, 1987 and 1989.

5|$|Heathen {{influences}} were {{apparent in}} forms of black metal from the 1990s, where lyrics and themes often expressed {{a longing for}} a pre-Christian Northern past; the mass media typically associated this music genre with Satanism. The Pagan metal genre—which emerged from the fragmentation of the extreme metal scene in Northern Europe during the early 1990s—came {{to play an important}} role in the North European Pagan scene. Many musicians involved in Viking metal were also practicing Heathens, with many metal bands embracing the heroic masculinity embodied in Norse mythological figures like Odin and Thor. From the mid-1990s, the Internet greatly aided the propagation of Heathenry in various parts of the world. <b>That</b> <b>decade</b> also saw the strong growth of racist Heathenry among those incarcerated within the U.S. prison system as a result of outreach programs established by various Heathen groups, a project begun in the 1980s. During this period, many Heathen groups also began to interact increasingly with other ethnic-oriented Pagan groups in Eastern Europe, such as Lithuanian Romuva, and many joined the World Congress of Ethnic Religions upon its formation in 1998.|$|E
