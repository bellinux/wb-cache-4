5|$|Hawks {{obtained}} character actors Charlie Ruggles on {{loan from}} Paramount Pictures for Major Horace Applegate and Barry Fitzgerald {{on loan from}} The Mary Pickford Corporation to play gardener Aloysius Gogarty. Hawks cast Virginia Walker as Alice Swallow, David's fiancée; Walker was under contract to him and later married his brother William Hawks. As Hawks {{could not find a}} panther <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>work</b> for the film, Baby was changed to a leopard so they could cast the trained leopard Nissa, who had worked in films for eight years, making several B-movies.|$|E
5|$|It is {{estimated}} {{that as much as}} another 1.2 GW of capacity remains available to exploit, mostly in the form of micro and small-hydro developments such as the existing one in Knoydart and a system planned for Kingussie. In reality, environmental constraints and given that the most easily available catchment areas have already been exploited {{it is unlikely that the}} full 1.2 GW will exploited. The 100 MW Glendoe Project which opened in 2009 was the first large scale dam in Scotland for almost fifty years but is likely to be one of the last of its kind. There is also further potential for new pumped storage schemes (at present used to meet peak demand) <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>work</b> with intermittent sources of power such as wind and wave. Examples include the 440 MW Cruachan Dam and 300 MW Falls of Foyers schemes. A 2011 report calculated that pumped storage hydro capacity could supply 2.8 GW of electricity for 5 hours, then drop to 1.1 GW and run out of water in 22 hours. The report concluded that even with projected new schemes at Loch Ness and Loch Sloy, pumped storage would not be able to replace wind electricity during extended windless periods.|$|E
25|$|The {{complexity}} of the state system demanded an imaginative policy from the emperor which required minimal {{use of force in}} such a large empire having diverse forms of economy and religions. It could not have been controlled by an army alone. A more feasible alternative was the propagation of a policy <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>work</b> at an ideological level and reach out to all sections of the society. The policy of Dharma was such an endeavour.|$|E

25|$|The Enterprise was {{the first}} of twelve sternwheelers <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>work</b> on this section of the Fraser from 1863 to 1921. Though she wasn’t large, she was a {{wonderful}} example of the early craft of shipbuilding. All of the lumber she was built from was cut by hand and her boiler and engines had been brought to the building site at Four Mile packed by mule via the wagon road from Port Douglas, 300 miles away.|$|E
25|$|The Army {{picked up}} these options, {{developing}} two concepts. The first, Project Quick-Shot, was basically {{identical to the}} Feld and Tsipis version, although they did consider some sort of low-cost guidance system as well. A second concept launched optical trackers into space {{in the path of}} the incoming missiles, and used their data to fine-tune the launch of unguided rockets <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>work</b> at longer ranges. As this had no radar component, it would bypass provisions in the ABM treaty over the number and placement of radar sites.|$|E
25|$|During the 1850s, {{the areas}} south of Lake Nyasa (now Lake Malawi) {{and west of}} the lake were {{explored}} by David Livingstone, and several Church of England and Presbyterian missions were established in the Shire Highlands in the 1860s and 1870s. In 1878 the African Lakes Company was established by businessmen with links to the Presbyterian missions. Their aim was {{to set up a}} trading company <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>work</b> in close co-operation with the missions to combat the slave trade by introducing legitimate trade and to develop European influence in the area. A small mission and trading settlement was established at Blantyre in 1876.|$|E

25|$|Originally, {{programmes}} from BBC Two {{were shown}} in high definition on the dedicated BBC HD channel, alongside programmes from BBC Three and BBC Four, {{as well as}} some select series from CBBC and CBeebies. However, in plans outlined by the director general Mark Thompson on 6 October 2011, BBC HD would close to be replaced by BBC Two HD, a high-definition simulcast of BBC Two <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>work</b> {{much the same way as}} BBC One HD. This move allowed the corporation to save £2.1 million, used to count towards its budget deficit following the freezing of the licence fee and the additional financial responsibility of addition services.|$|E
25|$|Out {{of these}} changes came the Stockpile Stewardship and Management Program (SSMP), which, among other things, {{included}} funds {{for the development of}} methods to design and build nuclear weapons <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>work</b> without having to be explosively tested. In a series of meetings that started in 1995, an agreement formed between the labs to divide up the SSMP efforts. An important part of this would be confirmation of computer models using low-yield ICF experiments. The Nova Upgrade was too small to use for these experiments, and a redesign emerged as NIF in 1994. The estimated cost of the project remained just over $1billion, with completion in 2002.|$|E
25|$|The first Passion Pit songs, {{which would}} later become the Chunk of Change EP, were written by Angelakos at Emerson College as a belated Valentine's Day gift to his then-girlfriend. At first, he wrote and {{performed}} all his material alone using a laptop. After one of his solo shows in the Boston area, Ian Hultquist, who was attending Berklee College of Music at the time, approached Angelakos and expressed interest in creating and playing music collaboratively. They formed a group that consisted of Angelakos, Hultquist, Ayad Al Adhamy, Thom Plasse (bass), and Adam Lavinsky (drums). The band spent {{a considerable amount of}} time trying to flesh out a collaborative format and structure <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>work</b> best for them. Jeff Apruzzese and Nate Donmoyer joined the band shortly after they signed to Frenchkiss in 2008, replacing Plasse and Lavinsky, respectively. In 2012, Adhamy was replaced by Xander Singh.|$|E

25|$|Southwick, local {{physician}} George E. Fell, and {{the head}} of the Buffalo ASPCA performed a series of experiments electrocuting hundreds of stray dogs, experimenting with animals in water, out of water, electrode types and placement, and conductive material until they came up with a repeatable method to euthanize animals using electricity. Southwick went on in the early 1880s to advocate that this method be used as a more humane replacement for hanging in capital cases, coming to national attention when he published his ideas in scientific journals in 1882 and 1883. He worked out calculations based on the dog experiments, trying to develop a scaled-up method <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>work</b> on humans. Early on in his designs he adopted a modified version of the dental chair as a way to restrain the condemned, a device that from then on would be referred called the electric chair.|$|E
500|$|On {{the other}} hand, Bill Lamb of About.com confessed about the {{recording}} that it [...] "is possibly the weakest track {{simply because the}} heavy production threatens to overwhelm the centerpiece of Bruno Mars' singing {{because it is a}} big power jazz ballad <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>work</b> well from the stage." [...] In the same vein, Mike Diver of BBC Music considered the song [...] "a ballad devoid of detectable emotion". The same perspective was replicated by Jamie Milton from musicOMH, who called it a [...] "over-sentimental ballad".|$|E
500|$|Renegade Squadron {{was formed}} {{shortly before the}} Battle of Yavin {{at the request of}} Han Solo and General Jan Dodonna, who were looking for {{experienced}} warriors that required no additional training.

[...] Serra agreed to Solo's request and put together a unit of mercenaries, bounty hunters, smugglers, and other fringe-types <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>work</b> behind-the-scenes to further the goals of the Alliance. [...] All {{of the members of the}} aptly named Renegade Squadron were wanted by the Empire and generally harbored an intense hatred for it, ensuring that they would remain loyal to the Alliance.|$|E

500|$|Max Holland, {{analyzing}} PBHistory in 2004, {{wrote that}} although very few highly sensitive communist documents were found, the operation provided the CIA its first detailed {{look at the}} development of a powerful communist movement. It also allowed them to set up a Guatemalan service <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>work</b> against the communists, and for these reasons, the CIA judged the operation to be a success. Historian Kate Doyle stated that the documents uncovered by PBHistory allowed the CIA to create a register of suspected communists. The documents were described by participants as an [...] "intelligence goldmine", and the register that the CIA left with the Guatemalan security forces contained information on thousands of citizens.|$|E
500|$|While {{speaking}} at {{schools across the}} United States, Haarsma noticed how some school librarians were having trouble finding funds to purchase The Softwire books after a demand had been created by Haarsma's visit. Many of the librarians were struggling to fill their shelves with books. [...] In June 2007, Haarsma and a friend, actor Nathan Fillion, approached a group of Fillion's fans {{with the idea for}} a project <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>work</b> to purchase books for underfunded schools, as well as nonprofit institutions which gave books directly to children. The [...] group took to the idea and focused their energies into getting the project off the ground. [...] The Kids Need to Read project went public in August 2007.|$|E
500|$|Eisenhower {{publicly}} stated {{his opposition}} in {{his press conference}} of March 26, 1953: [...] "The Bricker Amendment, as analyzed for me by the Secretary of State, would, as I understand it, in certain ways restrict the authority that the President must have, {{if he is to}} conduct the foreign affairs of this Nation effectively[...] [...] [...] [...] I do believe that there are certain features <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>work</b> to the disadvantage of our country, particularly in making it impossible for the President to work with the flexibility that he needs in this highly complicated and difficult situation." [...] Eisenhower's phrasing, [...] "as analyzed for me by the Secretary of State," [...] led Bricker and other conservatives to blame Dulles for misleading Eisenhower, and raised their suspicion that the Secretary of State was a tool of Eastern internationalist interests.|$|E

500|$|The album {{represented}} {{a departure from}} the band's previous working methods: although all five members had always contributed {{to the development of the}} songs, Gruff Rhys had been the main songwriter. On Love Kraft this was no longer the case, as Rhys, Huw Bunford, Dafydd Ieuan and Cian Ciaran all contributed songs and lead vocals. The group also abandoned their usual practise of picking songs on their individual merit, instead choosing tracks <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>work</b> well together and [...] "create a sound that was as cohesive as possible". Of the [...] "30-40" [...] songs written by band members the group chose [...] "the more introspective ones" [...] which meant that some of Rhys's tracks were left off the album as they were [...] "energetic and poppy" [...] and [...] "didn't really fit in with everybody else's work".|$|E
500|$|The film's SQUID scenes, {{which offer}} a point-of-view shot (POV), {{required}} multi-faceted cameras and considerable technical preparation. A full year was spent building a specialized camera that could reproduce {{the effect of}} looking through someone else's eyes. Bigelow revealed that it was essentially [...] "a stripped-down Arri that weighed {{much less than the}} smallest EYMO and yet it would take all the prime lenses." [...] Cinematographer Matthew F. Leonetti was also hired to help Bigelow film the scenes, which were choreographed weeks in advance. The opening sequence, which features a 16-foot jump between two buildings by a stunt performer without a safety harness, took two years to co-ordinate. According to Cameron, [...] "It's a major set piece. For the jump alone, we built special cameras, special rigs. We designed transitions <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>work</b> seamlessly. It was a very technical scene that doesn't look technical." ...|$|E
500|$|The five subtitled DVDs {{released}} by Media Blasters were reviewed by Anime News Network (ANN).

The content, however, was described as getting the series off to a [...] "slow start", with limitations of the first six episodes being the lack in fan service, humor, and that it [...] "struggles to find any other reason to be compelling". The second DVD, containing episodes seven through eleven, was reviewed as failing to [...] "materialize much real plot" [...] {{and content of the}} episodes was described as existing [...] "only to appeal to otaku who can get excited about moe content". The third DVD, compiling episodes twelve through sixteen, shows [...] "signs of an actual plot" [...] and contains a [...] "sudden explosion of fan service", which are noted as [...] "noteworthy developments" [...] in the review. In the fourth DVD, containing episodes seventeen through twenty-one, [...] "the series' romantic side does finally pay off with a romantic arc that actually engages". In the fifth and final DVD containing the last five episodes, the Hikari and Amane relationship is described as lacking chemistry, although the Nagisa and Shizuma pairing is regarded as satisfying.|$|E
