25|$|In {{the second}} edition of Richard Elliott Friedman's book Who Wrote the Bible?, in which he {{explained}} and defended the documentary hypothesis, he put forth {{the claim that the}} Deuteronomist, who is generally thought to have either written or edited the books from Deuteronomy to II Kings, was Baruch ben Neriah. He defended <b>this</b> <b>assertion</b> <b>by</b> comparing a number of different phrases in the Book of Jeremiah with phrases in other books.

25|$|In blessing Peter, Jesus {{not only}} accepts the titles Christ and Son of God which Peter {{attributes}} to him, but declares the proclamation a divine revelation {{by stating that}} his Father in Heaven had revealed it to Peter. In <b>this</b> <b>assertion,</b> <b>by</b> endorsing both titles as divine revelation, Jesus unequivocally declares himself to be both Christ and the Son of God. The proclamation of Jesus as Christ is fundamental to Christology and the Confession of Peter, and Jesus' acceptance of the title is a definitive statement {{for it in the}} New Testament narrative. While some of this passage may well be authentic, the reference to Jesus as Christ and Son of God is likely to be an addition by Matthew.|$|E

2500|$|The main {{question}} is, [...] "Does anything require the Administrator {{to make a}} 'judgment' whenever a petition for rulemaking is filed?" [...] Justice Scalia sees the Court's answer to this unequivocally as yes, but with no authority to back it. He backs <b>this</b> <b>assertion</b> <b>by</b> explaining that the [...] "statute says nothing {{at all about the}} reasons for which the Administrator may defer making a judgment"—the permissible reasons for deciding not to grapple with the issue at the present time.

2500|$|Peter's Confession {{begins as}} a {{dialogue}} between Jesus and his disciples in , [...] and [...] Jesus asks his disciples: But who {{do you say that}} I am?

[...] In blessing Peter, Jesus not only accepts the titles Christ and Son of God, which Peter attributes to him, but declares the proclamation a divine revelation by stating that his Father in Heaven had revealed it to Peter.

Having done this, as far as lies in his power, having exaggerated every circumstance that can be unfavorable to Peytel, and given his own tale in the baldest manner possible--having declared that Peytel is the murderer {{of his wife and}} servant, the Crown now proceeds to back <b>this</b> <b>assertion,</b> <b>by</b> showing what interested motives he had, and by relating, after its own fashion, the circumstances of his marriage.|$|E
