5|$|A {{binary search}} tree is a binary tree data {{structure}} <b>that</b> <b>works</b> {{based on the principle}} of binary search. The records of the tree are arranged in sorted order, and each record in the tree can be searched using an algorithm similar to binary search, taking on average logarithmic time. Insertion and deletion also require on average logarithmic time in {{binary search tree}}s. This can faster than the linear time insertion and deletion of sorted arrays, and binary trees retain the ability to perform all the operations possible on a sorted array, including range and approximate queries.|$|E

5|$|As Threni was {{intended}} for concert rather than liturgical use, Stravinsky chose the text freely from the early chapters of the Book of Lamentations. It has three movements: the large central movement is surrounded by two much shorter ones. Ernst Krenek composed a setting of the Lamentations in 1942, and Stravinsky acknowledged {{that it might have}} influenced him. He considered it less likely <b>that</b> <b>works</b> by Renaissance composers, including Tallis, Byrd and Palestrina, had influenced him, although he had studied such music.|$|E
5|$|Disruptive {{coloration}} (also {{known as}} disruptive camouflage or disruptive patterning) {{is a form}} of camouflage <b>that</b> <b>works</b> by breaking up the outlines of an animal, soldier or military vehicle with a strongly contrasting pattern. It is often combined with other methods of crypsis including background colour matching and countershading. It appears paradoxical as a way of not being seen, since disruption of outlines depends on high contrast, so the patches of colour are themselves conspicuous.|$|E

5|$|Head I, {{completed}} late in 1948, {{is considered}} {{more successful than}} Head II. Although it is well-regarded critically, Head II is seen {{as something of a}} creative cul-de-sac, while Heads III, IV and V are usually considered as merely intermediate steps towards HeadVI. It is exceptional in Bacon's oeuvre <b>that</b> <b>works</b> of their relative poor quality survive; he was ruthlessly self-critical and often slashed or abandoned canvasses before they were completed. When pressed again by Brausen in 1953 to produce works for a New York show that she had been publicising for a year, he was full of doubt and destroyed most of what he had been working on, including several other popes.|$|E

While pharmacological intervention is reserved for more severe symptoms, other treatments (such as supportive psychotherapy or cognitive behavioral therapy) may help to avoid or ameliorate depression and social isolation, and to improve family support. Educating a patient, family, and surrounding community (such as friends, school, and church) is a key treatment strategy, and may be all that is required in mild cases.|$|E
