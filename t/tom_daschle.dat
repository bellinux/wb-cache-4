5|$|Despite the state's general Republican and {{conservative}} leanings, Democrats have found success in various statewide elections, {{most notably in}} those involving South Dakota's congressional representatives in Washington. American Indians have been becoming more active in state and county electoral politics. In the 2002 election, American Indian voting carried Tim Johnson as the Democratic candidate {{by a margin of}} 532 votes. Until his electoral defeat in 2004, Senator <b>Tom</b> <b>Daschle</b> was the Senate minority leader (and briefly its majority leader during Democratic control of the Senate in 2001–02).|$|E
25|$|<b>Tom</b> <b>Daschle,</b> {{the other}} Democratic senator targeted, {{believes}} Ivins {{was the sole}} culprit.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} Obama's top aides have {{backgrounds}} with former Senate Majority Leader <b>Tom</b> <b>Daschle,</b> {{who left the}} Senate due to re-election defeat {{at the same time}} Obama was entering it.|$|E
25|$|Previously, Gannon {{had been}} criticized by <b>Tom</b> <b>Daschle's</b> {{supporters}} when he covered the South Dakota Senate race between Daschle and John Thune. Supporters of Daschle claimed he acted as a de facto member of the Thune campaign while ostensibly a journalist.|$|R
50|$|With the {{withdrawal}} of <b>Tom</b> <b>Daschle's</b> candidacy for United States Secretary of Health and Human Services, there was speculation Kitzhaber could be tapped for the position. However, Kitzhaber denied interest in the position {{and said that he}} was not being vetted.|$|R
2500|$|After the {{withdrawal}} of <b>Tom</b> <b>Daschle's</b> nomination for the position, Dean had been touted by many for the post of Secretary of Health and Human Services. After being passed over for the post once again, Dean commented: [...] "I was pretty clear that I {{would have liked to}} have been Secretary of HHS but it is the president's choice and he decided to go in a different direction." ...|$|R
25|$|In 2007, Baker joined fellow former Senate Majority Leaders Bob Dole, <b>Tom</b> <b>Daschle,</b> and George Mitchell {{to found}} the Bipartisan Policy Center, a {{non-profit}} think tank {{that works to}} develop policies suitable for bipartisan support.|$|E
25|$|House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt {{said the}} middle class will not benefit enough from the tax cut and the wealthy will reap unfairly high benefits. Senate Majority Leader <b>Tom</b> <b>Daschle</b> argued that the tax cut is too large, too generous to the rich and too expensive.|$|E
25|$|The Senate's {{consideration}} of the conference report was somewhat less heated, as cloture on it was invoked {{by a vote of}} 70-29. However, a budget point of order raised by <b>Tom</b> <b>Daschle,</b> and voted on. As 60 votes were necessary to override it, the challenge was actually considered to have a credible chance of passing.|$|E
40|$|<b>Tom</b> <b>Daschle's</b> {{withdrawal}} from his nomination as Secretary of Health and Human Services {{due to his}} failure to pay taxes on, among other things, the car and driver which a wealthy friend let him use while in Washington, while appropriate, is troubling not only because Daschle {{may well have been}} a good HHS Secretary, but also, {{for those of us who}} support our new president and his agenda, it is not a helpful development...|$|R
50|$|Admiral Eisold and the Attending Physician's office {{played a}} central role in the 2001 anthrax attacks on Senator <b>Tom</b> <b>Daschle's</b> U.S. Senate office, taking nasal swabs from the nearly 6,000 staff, employees, and {{visitors}} that were potentially exposed to the harmful bacteria. Admiral Eisold and his staff also provided initial treatment to Senator Tim Johnson when he suffered from an intracerebral bleed caused by a cerebral arteriovenous malformation, prior to Johnson's admission to George Washington University Hospital.|$|R
50|$|The Office of the Attending Physician {{under the}} {{leadership}} of Dr. John Francis Eisold {{played a central role in}} the response to the 2001 anthrax attacks on Senator <b>Tom</b> <b>Daschle's</b> Senate office, taking nasal swabs from the nearly 6,000 staff, employees, and visitors that were potentially exposed to the harmful bacteria. Former Attending Physician Rear Admiral Dr. John Eisold and his staff also provided initial treatment to Senator Tim Johnson when he suffered from an intracerebral bleed caused by a cerebral arteriovenous malformation, prior to Johnson's admission to George Washington University Hospital.|$|R
25|$|On October 15, 2001, several suites of this {{building}} became contaminated by the release of anthrax powder from an envelope mailed to Senate Majority Leader <b>Tom</b> <b>Daschle</b> in the 2001 anthrax attacks. The building was closed October 17, 2001, displacing hundreds of Senate staff. The building was decontaminated using chlorine dioxide gas from November to December 2001, and the building reopened January 23, 2002.|$|E
25|$|Former Senate Majority Leader <b>Tom</b> <b>Daschle</b> was President Obama's first {{nominee for}} the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Daschle was paid $220,000 in {{speaking}} fees to Healthcare providers, and was paid $16 million as an advisor to Healthcare lobbying {{groups in the}} time between his departure from the US Senate and his nomination. Daschle pulled his name from nomination on February 3, 2009.|$|E
25|$|During the 1994 elections, the Republicans won the {{majority}} {{in both houses of}} Congress. Dodd therefore entered the minority {{for the second time in}} his Senate career. He ran for the now vacant position of Senate Minority Leader, but was defeated by South Dakota Senator <b>Tom</b> <b>Daschle</b> by one vote. The vote was tied 23–23, and it was Colorado Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell who cast the deciding vote by absentee ballot in favor of Daschle.|$|E
25|$|Not {{long after}} <b>Tom</b> <b>Daschle's</b> {{withdrawal}} as President Barack Obama's nominee as United States Secretary of Health and Human Services {{due to a}} scandal over his failure to pay taxes, The Oregonian reported that Senator Wyden was being touted by many healthcare experts as a likely candidate to succeed Daschle as secretary-designate. Although Wyden was ultimately passed over in favor of Kansas Governor Kathleen Sebelius, he {{took advantage of the}} interim to reintroduce his Healthy Americans Act, with additional co-sponsorship from Republican Senators led by Tennessee's Lamar Alexander and Utah's Bob Bennett as well as from fellow Oregon Senator Jeff Merkley.|$|R
50|$|The special {{election}} was closely watched {{by both parties}} {{in an effort to}} gain momentum going into the 2004 House elections. The Hill committees of both parties spent a combined total of two million dollars on advertising in South Dakota. This election was especially important considering that five months later in addition to this House seat, Democratic Senator and Senate Minority Leader <b>Tom</b> <b>Daschle's,</b> who was facing a tough race against former Representative John Thune (R), who had come within 524 votes of defeating South Dakota's other Senator in 2002, U.S. Senate seat would also be up for election.|$|R
50|$|Smoot {{was born}} in North Carolina, where she was a debutante in Raleigh and other towns. She {{graduated}} from Smith College in 1989; her fellow Deputy Campaign Manager Stephanie Cutter was a year behind. She took leave from {{her job at the}} American Trial Lawyers Association to be finance director of John Edwards's 1998 campaign for U.S. Senate. She met Pete Rouse and Steve Hildebrand on Senate Majority Leader <b>Tom</b> <b>Daschle's</b> unsuccessful reelection campaign in 2004, where she raised $21 million. Rouse and Hildebrand brought her to the first Obama presidential campaign in January, 2007. She has also held positions with Senator Richard Durbin of Illinois and Jay Rockefeller of West Virginia. She worked in Senatorial campaigns for Chris Dodd and Harry Reid.|$|R
25|$|Giffords {{launched}} {{her first}} candidacy for the U.S.Congress on January 24, 2006. The campaign received national attention early on as a likely pick-up for the Democratic Party. Prominent Democrats, including <b>Tom</b> <b>Daschle,</b> Robert Reich, Janet Napolitano, and Bill Clinton, endorsed Giffords. EMILY's List endorsed Giffords {{early in the}} campaign cycle. The Sierra Club and the Arizona Education Association also endorsed her. On September 12, 2006, Giffords won her party's nomination in the primary election.|$|E
25|$|From 1999 to 2005, Reid {{served as}} Senate Democratic Whip, as {{minority}} whip from 1999 to 2001, and again from 2003 to 2005. Reid was majority whip from 2001 to 2003, {{except for a}} brief period from January to May 2001. From 2001 to 2003, he served as chairman of the Senate Ethics Committee. Reid succeeded <b>Tom</b> <b>Daschle</b> as minority leader in 2005, and became majority leader after the 2006 election until 2015.|$|E
25|$|A {{longtime}} Democratic supporter, with {{a history}} of donating to many Democratic campaigns, including regular donations to Ted Kennedy, John Kerry, and former Senate Majority Leader <b>Tom</b> <b>Daschle,</b> Redstone endorsed Republican George W. Bush over Kerry in the 2004 Presidential election, allegedly because he argued that Bush would be better for his company and the economy. Despite this public endorsement, he donated money to Kerry during the primaries and was involved in the Rathergate scandal meant to hurt Bush's reelection.|$|E
5000|$|In 2005, Hildebrand {{joined with}} Paul Tewes to form Hildebrand Tewes Consulting, a {{campaign}} consulting firm {{with offices in}} Washington, D.C. and Sioux Falls. In 2004 he was the campaign manager for U.S. Senator <b>Tom</b> <b>Daschle's</b> (D-SD) losing re-election effort against U.S. Representative John Thune (R-SD). He was also campaign manager in U.S. Senator Tim Johnson's (D-SD) winning re-election campaign in 2002 and Al Gore's 2000 Iowa Caucus victory. He has served as Executive Director of the South Dakota and Minnesota Democratic Parties and Political Director of Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.

25|$|<b>Tom</b> <b>Daschle</b> is a Member of the Global Leadership Foundation, an {{organization}} which works to support democratic leadership, prevent and resolve conflict through mediation and promote good governance {{in the form}} of democratic institutions, open markets, human rights and the rule of law. It does so by making available, discreetly and in confidence, the experience of former leaders to today’s national leaders. It is a not-for-profit organization composed of former heads of government, senior governmental and international organization officials who work closely with Heads of Government on governance-related issues of concern to them.|$|E
25|$|The Obama {{transition}} {{organization was}} called the Obama-Biden Transition Project. The transition team was convened {{during the height of}} the campaign, well before the outcome could be known, to begin making preparations for a potential administration. It was co-chaired by John Podesta, who was Bill Clinton's fourth and last White House Chief of Staff and the president/chief executive officer of the Center for American Progress, Valerie Jarrett, who is one of Obama's longest-serving advisers, and Pete Rouse, former Senate chief of staff for <b>Tom</b> <b>Daschle</b> who succeeded Rahm Emanuel as Obama's chief of staff.|$|E
25|$|In November 1998, Senate Minority Leader <b>Tom</b> <b>Daschle</b> {{appointed}} Durbin as his Assistant Democratic Whip. Following the 2004 election, Durbin {{became the}} Democratic Whip in the 109th Congress. He {{became the first}} senator from Illinois {{to serve as a}} Senate Whip since Everett Dirksen did so in the late 1950s, and the fifth to serve in Senate Leadership. Durbin served as Assistant Minority Leader from 2005 until 2007, when the Democrats became the Majority Party in the Senate. He then assumed the role of Assistant Majority Leader, or Majority Whip.|$|E
25|$|The {{race for}} the 2008 presidential {{nomination}} began in earnest after the 2006 midterm elections. Between November 2006 and February 2007, eight major candidates opened their campaigns-Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton, Chris Dodd, John Edwards, Dennis Kucinich, Barack Obama, Bill Richardson, and Tom Vilsack-joining Mike Gravel, who had announced his candidacy in April 2006. Potential candidates John Kerry, Al Gore, Russ Feingold, Evan Bayh, <b>Tom</b> <b>Daschle,</b> Wesley Clark, Mark Warner, and Al Sharpton reportedly considered running but ultimately declined to seek the nomination. Vilsack dropped out in February 2007.|$|E
25|$|As {{a former}} staffer for Ted Kennedy, Barnes {{was also one}} of a number of former congressional staffers in the Obama White House, {{alongside}} Jim Messina (formerly aide to Senator Max Baucus), Pete Rouse and Jeanne Lambrew (Senator <b>Tom</b> <b>Daschle),</b> Phil Schiliro (formerly aide to Representative Henry Waxman), and Lisa Konwinski (former aide to Senator Kent Conrad). Paul Starr writes that Obama's choice to surround himself with these former senior aides to key congressional leaders on health care was instrumental in passing the health-care reform legislation through Congress.|$|E
25|$|On December 5, <b>Tom</b> <b>Daschle,</b> who was {{designated}} to lead Obama's efforts {{for health care}} reform, announced a month-long campaign to solicit public input on the shape of that reform. People were encouraged to hold community meetings to discuss the issue, and to post their thoughts on www.change.gov, where over 10,000 comments had already been posted. Although Democratic leaders had met in private for several months to prepare a legislative package for unveiling in January, Daschle was anxious to avoid the appearance that the transition was working behind closed doors to create a sweeping agenda for change.|$|E
25|$|Two more anthrax letters, {{bearing the}} same Trenton postmark, were dated October 9, {{three weeks after}} the first mailing. The letters were {{addressed}} to two Democratic Senators, <b>Tom</b> <b>Daschle</b> of South Dakota and Patrick Leahy of Vermont. At the time, Daschle was the Senate Majority leader and Leahy was head of the Senate Judiciary Committee. The Daschle letter was opened by an aide, Grant Leslie, on October 15, and the government mail service was shut down. The unopened Leahy letter was discovered in an impounded mailbag on November 16. The Leahy letter had been misdirected to the State Department mail annex in Sterling, Virginia, because a ZIP code was misread; a postal worker there, David Hose, contracted inhalational anthrax.|$|E
25|$|In his {{statement}} to the Senate Budget Committee, Mulvaney {{admitted that he had}} failed to pay $15,000 in payroll taxes from 2000-04 for a nanny he had hired to care for his triplets. Mulvaney said he did not pay the taxes because he viewed the woman as a babysitter rather than as a household employee. After filling out a questionnaire from the Trump transition team, he realized the lapse and began the process of paying back taxes and fees. Senate Democrats noted that Republicans had previously insisted that past Democratic nominees' failure to pay taxes for their household employees was disqualifying, including former Health and Human Services nominee <b>Tom</b> <b>Daschle</b> in 2009.|$|E
25|$|On October 12, 2001, Miller {{opened an}} anthrax hoax letter mailed to her New York Times office. The 2001 anthrax attacks had begun {{occurring}} {{in the wake of}} the September 11 attacks in 2001, with anthrax-laced letters sent to ABC News, CBS News, NBC News, and the New York Post, all in New York City, as well as the National Enquirer in Boca Raton, Florida. Two additional letters (with a higher grade of anthrax) were sent on October 9, 2001, to Senators <b>Tom</b> <b>Daschle</b> and Patrick Leahy in Washington. Twenty-two people were infected; five died. In 2008, the government's investigation of these mailings focused on Bruce Ivins, who later committed suicide, with the investigation determining that Ivins acted alone.|$|E
25|$|Reid won {{election}} to the United States Senate in 1986 and served in the Senate from 1987 to 2017. He served as the Senate Democratic Whip from 1999 to 2005 before succeeding <b>Tom</b> <b>Daschle</b> as Senate Minority Leader. The Democrats won control of the Senate after the 2006 Senate elections and Reid became the Senate Majority Leader in 2007. He held that position {{for the last two}} years of George W. Bush's presidency and the first six years of Barack Obama's presidency. As Majority Leader, he helped pass major legislation such as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, the Dodd-Frank Act, and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. Republicans took control of the Senate following the 2014 Senate elections, and Reid served as Senate Minority Leader from 2015 to his retirement in 2017.|$|E
25|$|Sebelius was {{considered}} to be on the short list for nomination to a position in Obama's Cabinet, but she officially withdrew her name from consideration on December 6, 2008. Following Bill Richardson's withdrawal as Obama's nomination for Secretary of Commerce, there was media speculation that Sebelius would be chosen as the new nominee. Through a spokesperson, Sebelius reiterated her earlier statement that she would not consider accepting a nomination to the Cabinet position. Sebelius' name was again floated as a replacement for <b>Tom</b> <b>Daschle,</b> who withdrew as Obama's Secretary of Health and Human Services-designate over tax issues. The governor at first did not publicly comment on whether or not she would be interested in accepting the position. On February 28, 2009, the British wire agency Reuters reported that Sebelius had accepted the president's offer to become Secretary of Health and Human Services and that she would be nominated on March 2.|$|E
25|$|<b>Tom</b> <b>Daschle</b> was Obama's {{original}} {{nominee for}} Health and Human Services Secretary. However, he owed over $128,000 in taxes over three years, {{failed to report}} more than $83,000 in consulting fees in 2007, and owed $12,000 in interest and penalties. He also provided insufficient documentation for $15,000 of the $276,000 in charitable contributions {{that he and his}} wife, Linda, gave during the three-year period being studied by the panel. Daschle also had some miscommunications with his accountant on the $255,000 use of a luxury car service that was used 80% for personal services. Daschle paid his back taxes six days before his first confirmation hearings with the United States Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions. On February 3, The New York Times called the Daschle nomination into question both for his tax issues and for his extensive private sector work in the health services industry. The editorial noted that although Daschle was aware of his tax problem in June 2008, he did not correct it until his cabinet nomination. Later that day, Daschle withdrew his nomination.|$|E
25|$|The {{first version}} of the Patriot Act was {{introduced}} into the House on October 2, 2001 as the Provide Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism (PATRIOT) Act of 2001, and was later passed by the House as the Uniting and Strengthening America (USA) Act (H.R. 2975) on October 12. This {{was based on the}} afore-mentioned Anti-Terrorism Act, but had been changed after negotiations and work between Attorney General Ashcroft, Senators Leahy, Paul Sarbanes (D-MD), Bob Graham, Trent Lott (R-MS) and Orrin Hatch. It was introduced into the Senate as the USA Act of 2001 (S. 1510) by <b>Tom</b> <b>Daschle</b> (D-SD) where Senator Russ Feingold (D-WI) proposed a number of amendments, none of which were passed. Feingold amended the provision relating to interception of computer trespasser communications, limited the roving wiretap authority under FISA and modified the provisions relating to access to business records under FISA. The USA Act was later vitiated and indefinitely postponed, because the Senate and House bills could not be reconciled in time.|$|E
500|$|In January 2004, Bradley and Gore both {{endorsed}} Howard Dean for President in the 2004 Democratic primaries. [...] In January 2008, Bradley {{announced that}} he was supporting Barack Obama in the 2008 Democratic primary. [...] He campaigned for Obama and appeared on political news shows as a surrogate. Bradley's name was mentioned as a possible replacement for <b>Tom</b> <b>Daschle</b> as nominee for Secretary of Health and Human Services in the Obama administration after Daschle withdrew from consideration; the position went to Kansas governor Kathleen Sebelius. He has occasionally been involved in political matters, most recently consulting the Senate Finance Committee on tax reform along with former colleague Bob Packwood ...|$|E
