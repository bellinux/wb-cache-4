5|$|PEV is a {{subcategory}} {{of electric}} vehicles that includes battery electric vehicles (BEVs), plug-in hybrid vehicles, (PHEVs), and electric vehicle conversions of hybrid electric vehicles and conventional {{internal combustion engine}} vehicles. Even though conventional hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) have a battery that is continually recharged with power from <b>the</b> <b>internal</b> <b>combustion</b> <b>engine</b> and regenerative braking, {{they can not be}} recharged from an off-vehicle electric energy source, and therefore, they do not belong to the category of plug-in electric vehicles.|$|E
5|$|Electric cars, {{as well as}} plug-in hybrids {{operating}} in all-electric mode, emit no harmful tailpipe pollutants from the onboard source of power, such as particulates (soot), volatile organic compounds, hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, ozone, lead, and various oxides of nitrogen. The clean air benefit is usually local because, depending on {{the source of the}} electricity used to recharge the batteries, air pollutant emissions are shifted to the location of the generation plants. In a similar manner, plug-in electric vehicles {{operating in}} all-electric mode do not emit greenhouse gases from the onboard source of power, but {{from the point of view}} of a well-to-wheel assessment, the extent of the benefit also depends on the fuel and technology used for electricity generation. This fact has been referred to as the long tailpipe of plug-in electric vehicles. From the perspective of a full life cycle analysis, the electricity used to recharge the batteries must be generated from renewable or clean sources such as wind, solar, hydroelectric, or nuclear power for PEVs to have almost none or zero well-to-wheel emissions. On the other hand, when PEVs are recharged from coal-fired plants, they usually produce slightly more greenhouse gas emissions than internal combustion engine vehicles and higher than hybrid electric vehicles. In the case of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles operating in hybrid mode with assistance of <b>the</b> <b>internal</b> <b>combustion</b> <b>engine,</b> tailpipe and greenhouse emissions are lower in comparison to conventional cars because of their higher fuel economy.|$|E

25|$|Petroleum, in {{one form}} or another, has been used since ancient times, and is now {{important}} across society, including in economy, politics and technology.

25|$|Early {{aircraft}} {{development was}} heavily reliant {{on the development}} of <b>the</b> <b>internal</b> <b>combustion</b> <b>engine,</b> and the problem of staying in the air was largely a matter of having an engine which was not only sufficiently powerful but was also lightweight and reliable.

Most combine an {{internal combustion engine}} with an electric engine, though other variations too exist. <b>The</b> <b>internal</b> <b>combustion</b> <b>engine</b> is often either a gasoline or Diesel engine (in rare cases a Stirling engine may even be used).

The engine, mostly the technical work of men other than Langley, was probably the project's main contribution to aviation.|$|E

25|$|From {{the mid-19th}} century onwards, horse-drawn trams or horsecars were used in cities around the world. In the late 1880s {{electrically}} powered street railways became technically feasible following the invention of a trolley pole system of collecting current by American inventor Frank J. Sprague who installed the first successful system at Richmond, Virginia. They became popular because roads were then poorly surfaced, and before the invention of <b>the</b> <b>internal</b> <b>combustion</b> <b>engine</b> {{and the advent of}} motor-buses, they were the only practical means of public transport around cities.|$|E
25|$|The {{experiments}} {{showed the}} Stirling engine {{could be better}} to power an extended-range electric vehicle rather than serving as the primary power for an automobile.

Although successful in the MOD 1 and MOD 2 phases of the experiments, cutbacks in funding further research and lack of interest by automakers ended possible commercialization of the Automotive Stirling Engine Program.|$|E
