HF were surface-treated by four types of surface treatments: (a) alkali <b>treatment</b> <b>by</b> sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution, (b) alkali <b>treatment</b> <b>by</b> sodium chlorite (NaClO 2) solution, (c) alkali <b>treatment</b> <b>by</b> NaOH solution and surface <b>treatment</b> <b>by</b> ureido silane coupling agent, and (d) alkali <b>treatment</b> <b>by</b> NaClO 2 solution and surface <b>treatment</b> <b>by</b> ureido silane. The volume fraction of hemp fiber in the composites was fixed with 20 vol. %. HF/PA 1010 composites were extruded by a twin screw extruder and injection-molded. Mechanical properties such as tensile, bending and tribological properties by ring-on-plate type sliding wear testing were evaluated. It was found that the effect of the types of alkali treatment on the mechanical and tribological properties of the composites differed for each property. The mechanical and tribological properties are improved with both alkali <b>treatments</b> <b>by</b> NaOH and NaClO 2 with or without the surface <b>treatment</b> <b>by</b> ureido silane coupling agent (A- 1160). This may be attributed to the interfacial interaction and interphase adhesion between HF and PA 1010 according to the type of these alkali treatments. The combination NaClO 2 and A- 1160 is the most effect improvement for the mechanical and tribological properties of HF/PA 1010 biomass composites. It follows from these results that it may be possible to develop the new engineering materials with sufficient balance between mechanical and tribological properties. © 2016 Author(s) ...|$|R
