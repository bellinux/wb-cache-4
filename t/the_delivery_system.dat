40|$|This paper {{presents}} a general foundation for {{an analysis of}} the grade of service provided by <b>delivery</b> <b>systems</b> in <b>the</b> execution of fire missions. Queueing theory is used to develop several queueing models for <b>the</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>systems</b> in field operations. Furthermore, a number of simulations are constructed from these simple queueing models. These simulations extend the concepts introduced earlier with the inclusion of an x and y co-ordinate reference for both <b>the</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>systems</b> and <b>the</b> targets prosecuted by <b>the</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>systems.</b> In these simulations, three methods for the allocation of targets to <b>delivery</b> <b>systems</b> are examined.

2500|$|The M43 never {{rose above}} the status of [...] "interim weapon" [...] due {{to a number of}} {{shortcomings}} and issues with both the agent and <b>the</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>system.</b> BZ was expensive and difficult to synthesize, and this expense made large-area use of BZ impractical. Agent manufacture presented its own set of problems. BZ was susceptible to accidental ignition on the production line. The weaponization of BZ presented other problems including the agent cloud's easy visibility, and simple counter-measures (such as a few layers of cloth over the mouth and nose) could defeat it. In addition, the agent's [...] "envelope-of-action" [...] and rate of action were of questionable effectiveness. Between 50% and 80% of BZ casualties had to be restrained during recovery to prevent self-injury; other common symptoms during recovery were paranoia and mania. The combination of these issues made BZ weapons, the M43 and M44 generator cluster, unattractive to military planners.|$|E

Using the shotgun as <b>the</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>system</b> allows the officers to quickly choose a lethal or a less lethal weapon, so responding officers can adapt to changing situations; An officer in a standoff can quickly eject a chambered buckshot cartridge and replace it with a less-lethal cartridge such as a bean bag, and is not required to unload the magazine as with most rifles or handguns. Alternatively, one officer can be equipped with less lethal munitions, while others, equipped with buckshot, can provide a backup in case the less lethal rounds fail to stop the target.|$|E

Efficient service deliveries require understanding of <b>the</b> service <b>delivery</b> <b>system</b> as a whole and standardization of the system should take place. The objectives of this research are to understand how manufacturing companies can develop their service <b>delivery</b> <b>system</b> towards fleet level, identify how companies manage the system and find out how <b>the</b> service <b>delivery</b> <b>system</b> can be standardized without jeopardizing customer satisfaction. The research was conducted as a qualitative multiple-case study with three Finnish manufacturing companies. A literature review of previous research was done and 19 interviews were conducted in the companies with manager level employees. The interviews were recorded, transcripts were made and the data was analyzed by categorizing it. Every case company was observed individually and cross-case comparison was made across the companies. The study reveals the importance of technology, customer participation and standardization in the management and development of <b>the</b> service <b>delivery</b> <b>system.</b> <b>The</b> technology can enable or hinder the development and standardization. Customers cause variation into <b>the</b> service <b>delivery</b> <b>system</b> and companies have to consider their role carefully {{in order to be able}} to achieve efficient service deliveries.

Magnetic nanoparticles and albumin were incorporated within poly(D l-lactide-co-glycolide) microspheres to increase accumulation of the microspheres at the target site. Two chemotherapeutics, cyclophosphamide and 5 -fluorouracil, were encapsulated into the microspheres. The drug-release study revealed an initial burst of drug and then sustained release by diffusion. A Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy study confirmed the presence of all components of <b>the</b> drug <b>delivery</b> <b>system.</b> An in vitro study using fibroblast cells (3 T 3) and breast cancer cells (MDA- 486) exhibited an effective cytotoxicity behavior when exposed to <b>the</b> drug <b>delivery</b> <b>system</b> in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The therapeutic influence of <b>the</b> drug <b>delivery</b> <b>system</b> was evaluated in vivo using a nude mouse breast cancer model. A continuous decrease in tumor size was observed in groups treated with microspheres containing the chemotherapeutics, whereas mice treated with direct chemotherapy without drug <b>delivery</b> <b>system</b> showed less efficacy and suggested tumor relapse after cessation of treatment. The enhanced therapeutic influence of <b>the</b> drug <b>delivery</b> <b>system</b> {{may be attributed to}} the increased uptake of the microspheres by malignant cells due to the presence of albumin and magnetic force.
