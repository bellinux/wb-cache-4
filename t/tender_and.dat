5|$|Beef steak is graded for quality, {{with higher}} prices for higher quality. Generally, the higher the quality, the more tender the beef, the less time is needed for cooking, or the better the flavor. For example, beef fillet is the most <b>tender</b> <b>and</b> wagyu, such as Kobe beef from Japan, {{is known for its}} high quality and {{commands}} a high price. Steak can be cooked relatively quickly compared to other cuts of meat, particularly when cooked at very high temperatures, such as by broiling or grilling.|$|E
5|$|Capitán Prat {{served in}} the fleet for about ten years, until she was {{disarmed}} in accordance with a treaty signed with Argentina intended to stop a naval arms race between the two countries. The ship returned to service, however, and remained on active duty with the fleet until 1926, when she {{was reduced to a}} coastal defense ship. In 19281930, she was used as a submarine <b>tender,</b> <b>and</b> in 1935, she was disarmed and used as a training ship for engineers. She remained in the Navy's inventory until 1942, when she was sold for scrap.|$|E
5|$|Elvis Presley plays Deke Rivers (whose {{real name}} is Jimmy Tompkins), a deliveryman who is {{discovered}} by {{the manager of a}} band. The film is Presley's second motion picture following his debut in the 1956 film Love Me <b>Tender</b> <b>and</b> his first starring role. It also marked the beginning of his seven-film streak for Paramount produced by Hal Wallis. For the role, Presley dyed his hair black following his favorite actors: Tony Curtis and Rudolph Valentino. As the second of his 1956 three-movie deal with Paramount Pictures, Presley was paid US$150,000.|$|E

5|$|Health: Brown said {{he wanted}} doctors' {{surgeries}} to open at weekends, and GPs to be on-call in the evenings. Doctors {{had been given the}} right to opt out of out-of-hours care two years before under a controversial pay deal signed by then-Health Secretary John Reid, that awarded them a 22 percent pay rise in 2006. Lord Ara Darzi was appointed to review NHS service delivery, especially in London. Proposed policies included the induction of polyclinics, which would be open to <b>tender</b> <b>and</b> possibly run by private companies.|$|E

5|$|Both ships {{served in}} the East Asia station with the East Asia Squadron; Prinzess Wilhelm {{played a major role}} in the seizure of the Kiautschou Bay {{concession}} in November 1897, under command of Admiral Otto von Diederichs. The two ships were sent to safeguard German interests in the Philippines after the Battle of Manila Bay during the Spanish–American War. There, Irenes presence caused tensions with the American squadron occupying the islands. Both ships returned to Germany at the turn of the century, and remained in European waters until 1914, when they were removed from active service. They were reduced to secondary roles—Irene was used as a submarine <b>tender</b> <b>and</b> Prinzess Wilhelm was hulked—and continued to serve until the early 1920s, when they were sold for scrap.|$|E

5|$|Food {{impaction}} {{occurs when}} food debris, especially fibrous food such as meat, becomes trapped between two teeth and is {{pushed into the}} gums during chewing. The usual cause of food impaction is disruption of the normal interproximal contour or drifting of teeth so that a gap is created (an open contact). Decay can lead to collapse of part of the tooth, or a dental restoration may not accurately reproduce the contact point. Irritation, localized discomfort or mild pain {{and a feeling of}} pressure from between the two teeth results. The gingival papilla is swollen, <b>tender</b> <b>and</b> bleeds when touched. The pain occurs during and after eating, and may slowly disappear before being evoked again at the next meal, or relieved immediately by using a tooth pick or dental floss in the involved area. A gingival or periodontal abscess may develop from this situation.|$|E
5|$|Thames was {{the sixth}} ship {{of her name}} {{to serve in the}} Royal Navy. She was laid down on 14 April 1884 by Pembroke Dockyard in No. 4 slipway. The ship was {{launched}} on 3 December 1885 by the Hon. Mrs. Algernon Littleton and completed in July 1889 at a cost of £204,952. The ship went straight into reserve at Devonport after completion. On 21 March 1902 she was temporarily commissioned by Captain H. L. Fleet, with crewmen from the battleship , to serve as a port guard ship at Queenstown, while the latter ship was undergoing alterations. In 1903, the ship was converted to a submarine <b>tender</b> <b>and</b> served at Sheerness from 1907 to 1917 and then briefly at Portsmouth and Campbeltown, Scotland, before being paid off in 1919 at Chatham Dockyard.|$|E
5|$|The Smithsonian {{recognized}} the locomotive's age in 1931, but, since the museum didn't have {{the funds to}} refurbish the locomotive for full operation again, {{it was decided to}} run the locomotive in place (with the driving wheels lifted off the rails using jacks) with compressed air. The museum borrowed an 1836 coach from the Pennsylvania Railroad to display on the track behind the newly rebuilt <b>tender,</b> <b>and</b> the locomotive's 100th birthday was officially celebrated on November 12, 1931. The locomotive's semi-operation was broadcast over the CBS radio network with Stanley Bell narrating the ceremonies for the radio audience.|$|E

5|$|The Yugoslav {{minelayer}} Zmaj (Dragon) {{was built}} in Germany as a seaplane tender for the Royal Yugoslav Navy in 1928–30. She {{does not appear to}} have been much used in that role and was converted to a minelayer in 1937. Captured by the Germans in 1941, she was renamed Drache (Dragon) and redesignated as an aircraft <b>tender</b> <b>and</b> later as a troop transport, before she was rebuilt as a minelayer in 1942. She laid one minefield in 1943 that sank two Allied destroyers and badly damaged a third in the Aegean Sea. Drache was also used by the Germans to evaluate the shipboard use of helicopters for reconnaissance purposes. She was sunk by Allied aircraft in 1944 at Samos and scrapped in place after the end of World War II.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of the submarine commenced in May 1983, when the government released a request for <b>tender</b> <b>and</b> approached seven of the world's nine diesel-electric submarine manufacturers for submissions. The submissions would be narrowed down to two based on the provided information, with these undergoing a funded study to determine the winning design. Tendering companies had to demonstrate how Australian industries would {{be incorporated into the}} project, and that they were willing to establish an Australia-based consortium to construct the submarines. All seven companies responded {{by the end of the}} year: the combined submissions totalling four tonnes (9,000lb) of paper.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} design of tender, {{which came to}} be known as Type 'A' was designed for the first ten streamlined locomotives. These were of welded tank construction and included side sheets extending from the rear of the tender, which had the effect of reducing drag from eddies between the <b>tender</b> <b>and</b> the leading coach. 28 of these were constructed to be coupled with all the 24 streamliners (Nos. 6220–6229 and Nos. 6235–6248) as well as four of the unstreamlined locomotives (Nos. 6249–6252). In practice, it would seem that the side sheets made it more difficult to access the water filler as well as the couplings.|$|E

5|$|All SAS Commuter {{services}} in Northern Norway were {{taken over by}} Widerøe in October 2002. Norwegian Air Shuttle took over the routes to Alta and Tromsø from 1 April 2003, but already {{by the start of}} operations announced they would retire their fleet of Fokker 50 aircraft, resign from short-haul routes and become a low-cost airline. Widerøe won the subsequent <b>tender</b> <b>and</b> started operating to Lakselv from 1 January 2004. SAS Braathens introduced low-frequency summer services from Oslo from 2006, which was kept for three seasons. SAS cited too low ridership from foreign tourists as the reason for the closure. Widerøe took over SAS Ground Services' operations at Banak in 2008. Norwegian introduced a new summer seasonal route from Oslo to Lakselv from 2011. Outgoing charter services started in 2012 to Burgas and Antalya. Scandinavian Airlines operated one charter flight from Tokyo and back in 2011.|$|E
5|$|Coast Air {{continued}} {{to provide a}} service until 1 August 1996, when Fagernes became a trial {{for the use of}} public service obligations for regional aviation in Norway. The first contract was won by Teddy Air, to serve both Oslo and Bergen. The contract agreed a subsidy of NOK 23.7 million for three years, 15% less than Coast Air had been receiving. Teddy Air operated until 1August 1999, when Widerøe took over using de Havilland Canada Dash 8-100 aircraft. At the same time, the route from Fagernes to Bergen was dropped from the schedule. Widerøe's contract lasted only eight months, until 1 April 2000, when Guard Air, who bid NOK 6.93 million per year, won the <b>tender,</b> <b>and</b> started flying with Dornier 228 aircraft. On 8October 2001, Guard Air filed for bankruptcy, and the ministry signed an intermediate contract with Widerøe to fly the route. The subsequent tender was won by Arctic Air, who continued operation until 31 March 2003, using Dornier 228 aircraft.|$|E
5|$|HMS Campania was a {{seaplane}} <b>tender</b> <b>and</b> aircraft carrier, {{converted from}} an elderly ocean liner by the Royal Navy {{early in the}} First World War. After her conversion was completed in mid-1915 the ship spent her time conducting trials and exercises with the Grand Fleet. These revealed {{the need for a}} longer flight deck to allow larger aircraft to take off, and she was modified accordingly. Campania missed the Battle of Jutland in May 1916, but made a number of patrols with elements of the Grand Fleet. She never saw combat and was soon relegated to a training role because of her elderly machinery. In November 1918 Campania was anchored with the capital ships of the Grand Fleet when a sudden storm caused her anchors to drag. She hit several of the ships and the collisions punctured her hull; she slowly sank, with no loss of life.|$|E
