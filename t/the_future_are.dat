5|$|According to Swami Vivekananda, Sita {{is typical}} of India – the {{idealized}} India.

25|$|Memories of 'future relevance' {{are also}} {{consolidated}} greater during sleep. In {{a study by}} Wilhelm et al., 2011, memories of items that participants knew were needed for the future (for the testing session) were remembered more after sleep. Sleep consolidated these memories of future relevance to a greater extent. Memories that are emotionally significant and relevant for <b>the</b> <b>future</b> <b>are</b> therefore preferentially consolidated during sleep. This can translate to mean that memories that are more meaningful or valuable to a person are consolidated more.|$|E

Among the events shown are the political aftermath of the 2261 civil war, a subsequent nuclear war on Earth involving a new totalitarian government in 2762, the resulting fall of Earth into a pre-industrial society, the loss and restoration of humanity's knowledge of space travel and the final evolution of mankind into energy beings similar to the Vorlons, after which Earth's sun goes nova.|$|E

25|$|Current UN {{projections}} show {{a continued}} increase in {{population in the}} near future (but a steady decline in the population growth rate), with the global population expected to reach between 8.3 and 10.9 billion by 2050. Estimates by the UN Population Division for the year 2150 range between 3.2 and 24.8 billion; mathematical modeling supports the lower estimate. Some analysts have questioned the sustainability of further world population growth, highlighting the growing pressures on the environment, global food supplies, and energy resources. Solutions for feeding the nine billion in <b>the</b> <b>future</b> <b>are</b> being studied and documented. One out of every seven people on our planet go to sleep hungry. People are suffering due to overpopulation, 25,000 people die of malnutrition and hunger related diseases everyday.|$|E
25|$|A great celebratory feast is held on Anuenue, {{and plans}} for <b>the</b> <b>future</b> <b>are</b> made. During the party, Xelha and Kalas slip away to the spring in Moonguile Forrest. Xelha reveals that the Ice Queens, of whom she is the last, are {{responsible}} for holding the long-lost Ocean, and that Kalas and the Guardian Spirit must release it from within her, now that the Earth has been restored. Kalas refuses at first, seeing that he has {{fallen in love with}} Xelha, but eventually agrees to restore humanity. The Ocean is about to be released when Geldoblame's spirit, inhabiting the surrounding Earth, returns, claiming the new world for himself. Kalas and Xelha defeat him, but the battle uses the last of Xelha's strength and she dies in Kalas' arms. Before her body disappears, she says that she just wished that she and Kalas could have been like any other couple.|$|E

In the meantime, Dionysus mourns for Ampelus. Ampelus is transformed into the vine and Dionysus makes wine for the first time, reflecting on how Ampelus has escaped death. Dionysus adopts the vine as his personal attribute and claims to be superior to the other gods, because no other plant is so beautiful and provides so much merriment to humankind. Insertion of a second legend {{on the origins of}} the vine: it was growing wild and unknown of until Dionysus saw a snake suckling the juice from the grapes; Dionysus and his satyrs build the first wine press, make wine {{for the first time and}} have the first feast of the harvest, completely inebriated.|$|E

500|$|In July 1977, both thirty-year-old {{security}} officer Miles and three-month-old infant Miles are {{living on the}} island. [...] Four survivors, Jack, Kate, Hurley, and Sayid from Flight 815 who had been rescued nearly three years earlier on December 30, 2004 arrive on the island in 1977 after flying near the island in late 2007 and also join DHARMA, Sayid being a prisoner on suspicion of being an Other. [...] Miles still stays distant from his father, but, after talking to Hurley during a late-night chore, witnesses a peaceful moment between his younger self and his father. Three days later, the groups from <b>the</b> <b>future</b> <b>are</b> exposed as liars. [...] The next morning, Faraday comes clean to Chang that they are from the future and warns of a catastrophic [...] "incident" [...] that is due to occur at the building site for the Swan, DHARMA's planned island station dedicated to electromagnetism. [...] He instructs Chang to evacuate the island of non-essential personnel, which he does, ordering his wife and baby Miles to leave him, shortly after finding out that adult Miles is his son and confronting him about it. [...] Here, Miles realizes that he himself caused his father to order {{his mother and his}} three-month-old self to leave. Faraday theorizes that if [...] "Jughead" [...] – a hydrogen bomb that is buried on the island – is detonated at the Swan site by the underground electromagnetic pocket of energy, the timeline will be altered, preventing any of the group from the future from ever having come to the island in 2004, saving everyone who had died after they arrived. [...] The plan proceeds as planned, even though Miles expresses skepticism. [...] The antagonistic DHARMA members engage in a gunfight with Jack, believing him to be an Other, and Miles, Sawyer, Juliet, and Kate come to his aid. [...] When the Swan site goes haywire, Chang's arm is caught in the debris and Miles rushes to his side, saving him and calling him [...] "Dad". [...] After he tells his father to run as far as possible from the site, the bomb is detonated and everything goes to white, leaving Miles's status uncertain.|$|E

[...] His astrological text-book Liber Astronomiae ('Book of Astronomy'), written around 1277, was reputed to be [...] "the most important astrological work produced in Latin in the 13th century".
