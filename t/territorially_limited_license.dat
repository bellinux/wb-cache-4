30|$|Today, {{the global}} economy has {{affected}} the way we understand economic and social relationships. As a result, the concept of ‘ethnic enclave’ needs to be revisited making use of the latest theoretical developments which disassociate this kind of ethnic economy from a <b>territorially</b> <b>limited</b> area. This is by including the notion of ‘social production of space’, where the capital and resources circulate through social networks which go beyond the physical space. It is precisely the share of contacts of providers and suppliers and the specialisation in a certain sector (what Werbner calls vertical and horizontal integration) what enables the persistence and consolidation of an enclave even if this is constituted by businesses placed in different neighbourhoods or cities.|$|R

40|$|This article {{contends that}} in the digital era, {{the current system of}} national, <b>territorially</b> <b>limited</b> {{copyright}} laws requires a flexible copyright choice of law regime. To promote certainty and predictability in the choosing of the copyright law applicable to acts of exploitation, choice of law rules should use the location of a user as the principal factor to determine the applicable copyright law. In appropriate circumstances, the choice of law rules should allow the application of a multitude of national copyright laws to single acts of use on digital networks. This article also argues that a broad application of flexible contract choice of law rules that respect agreements about the allocation of rights as much as possible is of preeminent importance in the digital era...|$|R

40|$|The EU has perfect {{human rights}} {{obligations}} towards distant strangers. My argument has two limbs: Firstly, in numerous policy areas, the EU asserts jurisdiction via ‘territorial extension’, which combines <b>territorially</b> <b>limited</b> enforcement jurisdiction with {{a claim of}} geographically unbounded prescriptive jurisdiction. Doctrinally, this strongly resembles the Lotus principle, and viewed analytically, amounts to a claim not just of power but of political authority. Thus, the EU creates not just factual effects, but legal effects abroad. Secondly, assertions of political authority, even if only de facto, give rise to perfect human rights obligations. I illustrate this by reference to the Strasbourg Court’s case-law, which demonstrates {{that the creation of}} legal effects extraterritorially suffices to give rise to extraterritorial human rights jurisdiction, and therefore obligations. I therefore reject accounts of human rights jurisdiction premised upon ‘capability’, ‘control’, or other aspects of mere power...|$|R

40|$|Al-Irshād is an {{organization}} formed by the Arabs in present-day Indonesia in 1914, which advocates Islamic reform. This article examines its educational activities in the Dutch colonial period, elucidating the thoughts of its founder and leader, Aḥmad Sūrkatī, {{and the process of}} the integration of Arabs into the host society. Sūrkatī’s thought is distinguished from other Arab reformists for its emphasis on “egalitarianism” and its lack of a tendency towards Arab nationalism. From early on, he attempted to adapt the al-Irshād schools to the colonial education system in order to attract indigenous (pribumi) students, as well. In the late 1920 s, he began to be locally oriented, with a focus <b>territorially</b> <b>limited</b> to Indonesia. The educational activities of al-Irshād in the 1930 s also indicated the weakning of Ḥaḍramī/Arab-orientation. By the late 1930 s, the opinion of al-Irshād was decisively inclined toward integration within the host society. DOI:  10. 15408 /sdi. v 23 i 3. 3268 </p...|$|R
40|$|In 1995 the Peronist party {{held the}} Argentine presidency, a {{comfortable}} majority in both congressional chambers, and most provincial governorships and municipalities. In 2013 {{the political landscape}} looked exactly the same. However, between 2001 and 2002 the country arguably went through its most serious crisis ever, which led to massive popular uprisings, the early resignation of two presidents, and the largest debt default in international history. The political collapse did not, however, constitute a spontaneous or definite rupture with the past. Instead, the social revolt detonated in December 2001 was not only temporally and <b>territorially</b> <b>limited</b> but also politically nurtured and institutionally bounded. Conventional explanations have tended to overlook a crucial set of actors that was neither marching in the streets nor voting in the Congress. These actors were subnational power holders and they were Peronist, and their participation explains how the protest began, how the crisis unfolded, {{and how it was}} resolved...|$|R
