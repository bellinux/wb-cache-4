500|$|After he {{beat the}} Mariners on short (three days') rest at the {{beginning}} of August for the team lead in wins, Seattle manager Don Wakamatsu said: [...] "I thought Feldman was awfully tough.

500|$|The {{album is}} also called Loose {{because it is}} [...] "the {{opposite}} of calculated" [...] and came naturally to Furtado and Timbaland; she called him her [...] "distant musical cousin because he was always pushing boundaries and always carving out his own path", which she believed she was doing with Loose. [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> keep surprising people as an artist, and I like that—I love doing that", she said.|$|E

500|$|Idol {{hoped to}} advance the way stagecraft and {{lighting}} were used at rock concerts. [...] "Part of {{the idea is to}} create an element of visible language," [...] Idol explained during an interview with the New York Times, [...] "so that you feel as if you're being talked to through images. I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> start looking to get to the future of what rock-and-roll concerts should be like. We're working; we're pushing the technology to the edge." ...|$|E
500|$|Other {{major themes}} of the series include choice and free will. Meyer says that the books are {{centered}} around Bella's choice to choose her life on her own, and the Cullens' choices to abstain from killing rather than follow their temptations: [...] "I really think that's the underlying metaphor of my vampires. It doesn't matter where you're stuck in life or what you <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> do; you can always choose something else. There's always a different path." ...|$|E
500|$|Due to the high-pitch {{employed}} in the recording, Dickson reflected in later years that she [...] "never liked the original [...] for that reason. The song has seasoned over the years with my singing of it." [...] Dickson believed {{that she did not}} sound like herself on the song. While performing it later point of time on her concerts, Dickson sang it in her actual tone, saying that although the track [...] "might have been written for a teenage girl, but the experience of being abandoned by a man is one, women of all ages can relate to. I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be honest with songs and with yourself." [...] The singer's music director Ian Lynn arranged the track differently which she performs currently.|$|E

500|$|In early 2001, Spears {{said that}} she had plans to make her film debut. She and her team then created a concept for it, which was later {{developed}} by Grey's Anatomy creator Shonda Rimes. Spears commented that she [...] "talked to [...] and told her what I wanted the movie to be about and she elaborated on it. It was my little project. When you do a movie, I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be really passionate about it. I was having a lot of offers, but this is something my heart was into." [...] A press conference was held during the Marché International du Disque et de l'Edition Musicale (MIDEM) in Cannes, France, on January 19, 2002, where Spears also premiered the film.|$|E
500|$|In December 2010, Ryan Murphy {{announced}} that the cast of Glee would be replaced {{at the end of}} the third season to coincide with their graduation. Murphy said: [...] "Every year we're going to populate a new group. There's nothing more depressing than a high schooler with a bald spot." [...] He also revealed that some of the original cast will leave as early as 2012: [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be true to the fact that here is a group of people who come and go in these teachers' lives." [...] Although four graduating seniors were confirmed in January 2012 as returning in the fourth season—Rachel, Finn, Kurt and Santana—there had been no announcement regarding Quinn or any other seniors as of the end of February 2012. As of May 2012, Murphy stated that all graduating seniors will come back for season 4 but, not all will be doing [...] "all 22 episodes".|$|E
500|$|In early 2001, Spears and {{her team}} {{developed}} a script for a movie where the singer could be the main role. [...] "I talked to [...] and told her what I wanted the movie to be about and she elaborated on it," [...] Spears said. [...] "It was my little project. When you do a movie, I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be really passionate about it. I was {{having a lot of}} offers, but this is something my heart was into." [...] After finishing the script, the movie, which was later titled Crossroads, had the working titles of What Are Friends For and Not a Girl. [...] "I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman", written by Dido, Max Martin and Rami, was originally intended to be included on the movie's soundtrack, but after JIVE Records decided not to release a soundtrack, Spears later decided to use it on her third studio album, Britney (2001).|$|E

500|$|The filming {{schedule}} {{was intended to}} last 138 days but grew to 160. Many cast members came down with colds, flu, or kidney infections after spending hours in cold water, including Winslet. In the end, she decided she would not work with Cameron again unless she earned [...] "a lot of money". Several others left the production, and three stuntmen broke their bones, but the Screen Actors Guild decided, following an investigation, that nothing was inherently unsafe about the set. Additionally, DiCaprio {{said there was no}} point when he felt he was in danger during filming. Cameron believed in a passionate work ethic and never apologized for the way he ran his sets, although he acknowledged:I'm demanding, and I'm demanding on my crew. In terms of being kind of militaresque, I think there's an element of that in dealing with thousands of extras and big logistics and keeping people safe. I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> have a fairly strict methodology in dealing with a large number of people.|$|E
500|$|In {{an impromptu}} {{interview}} following the match, a clearly upset Solo criticized Ryan's decision. [...] "It {{was the wrong}} decision, and I think anybody that knows anything about the game knows that. There's {{no doubt in my}} mind I would have made those saves. And the fact of the matter is it's not 2004 anymore. It's not 2004. And it's 2007, and I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> live in the present. And you can't live by big names. You can't live in the past. It doesn't matter what somebody did in an Olympic gold medal game in the Olympics three years ago. Now is what matters, and that's what I think." [...] Many viewed her comments as being critical of Scurry's performance, although Solo released an apologetic statement the following day saying that was not her intent. On September 29, 2007, coach Greg Ryan announced that Solo would not be with the team and would not play in the third-place match against Norway the following day. Team captain Kristine Lilly stated that the decision on Solo was made by the team as a group. The U.S. went on to win against Norway 4–1.|$|E
500|$|In December 2010, Ryan Murphy {{announced}} that the cast of Glee would be replaced {{at the end of}} the season 3 to coincide with their graduation.

[...] He also revealed that some of the original cast will leave as early as 2012, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be true to the fact that here is a group of people who come and go in these teachers' lives." [...] Murphy said in July 2011 that Michele would be one of the actors leaving {{at the end of the}} third season, and Michele commented on the matter, saying, [...] "We always knew we'd graduate in real time. It's all part of the plan and it's all good! It's going to make Season 3 amazing! This is just the beginning!" [...] However, Falchuk later stated that while Michele, along with Chris Colfer and Cory Monteith, will graduate at the end of the third season, [...] "Because they're graduating doesn't mean they're leaving the show." [...] Falchuk insisted, [...] "It was never our plan or our intention to let them go... They are not done with the show after this season." ...|$|E

500|$|Gilbert Adair, {{writing in}} a review for Full Metal Jacket, commented that [...] "Kubrick's {{approach}} to language has always been of a reductive and uncompromisingly deterministic nature. He appears to view it as the exclusive product of environmental conditioning, only very marginally influenced by concepts of subjectivity and interiority, by all whims, shades and modulations of personal expression". Johnson notes that although Kubrick was a [...] "visual filmmaker", he also loved words and was like a writer in his approach, very sensitive to the story itself, which he found unique. Before shooting began, Kubrick tried to have the script as complete as possible, but still allowed himself enough space to make changes during the filming, finding it [...] "more profitable to avoid locking up any ideas about staging or camera or even dialogue prior to rehearsals" [...] as he put it. Kubrick told Robert Emmett Ginna: [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> view the entire problem of putting the story {{you want to tell}} up there on that light square. It begins with the selection of the property; it continues through the creation of the story, the sets, the costumes, the photography and the acting. And when the picture is shot, it's only partially finished. I think the cutting is just a continuation of directing a movie. I think the use of music effects, opticals and finally main titles are all part of telling the story. And I think the fragmentation of these jobs, by different people, is a very bad thing". Kubrick also said: [...] "I think that the best plot is no apparent plot. I like a slow start, the start that gets under the audience's skin and involves them so that they can appreciate grace notes and soft tones and don't have to be pounded over the head with plot points and suspense tools." ...|$|E

2500|$|When asked a {{week later}} about the {{controversy}} about Obama's pastor that prompted, and was addressed by, Obama's speech, Clinton answered, [...] "He {{would not have been}} my pastor.

I just <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> speak out against that. You certainly have to do that, if not explicitly, then implicitly by getting up and moving." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "There's {{always a}} form of theater that things take; even back in the Ozarks, {{as far as you}} want to go.
