5|$|Recalling her {{inability}} to help the wounded people whom she saw during the Second World War, Hsu {{decided to become a}} nurse. As she was overaged at 47, she wrote a request to the chief matron of the Nursing Council in London. Touched by Hsu's sincerity and dedication, her application was accepted. She spent eight years in England doing nursing and another eight in Paraguay {{as a member of the}} German charity group Bruderhof, to start hospitals and homes for the aged <b>there.</b> <b>In</b> <b>her</b> mid-50s, she decided to return home to Penang to be with her mother. In Malaysia, she assisted her brother in starting the Assunta Foundation for the Poor in Ipoh. She also played a key role in the startup of three homes for the elderly and two homes for young girls and neglected children in Ipoh.|$|E

Segments of the Queen's appearance are also shown in Disney's Halloween Treat (1982) and in A Disney Halloween (1983).

25|$|Noël Browne {{was born}} in Waterford {{and grew up in}} Derry, Athlone and Ballinrobe. His mother Mary Therese Cooney {{was born in}} 1885 in Hollymount, County Mayo; a plaque has been erected <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> memory. His father worked as an {{inspector}} for the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children and, {{partly as a result of}} this work, all of the Browne family became infected with tuberculosis. Both parents died of the disease during the 1920s, and several of Browne's siblings also succumbed. In 1929 he was admitted free of charge to St. Anthony's, a preparatory school in Eastbourne, England. He then won a scholarship to Beaumont College, the Jesuit public school near Old Windsor, Berkshire, where he befriended Neville Chance, a wealthy boy from Dublin. Neville's father, the eminent surgeon Arthur Chance (son of surgeon, Sir Arthur Chance), subsequently paid Browne's way through medical school at Trinity College, Dublin.|$|E

50|$|Swynnerton's {{eyesight}} deteriorated <b>in</b> <b>her</b> later years. Following her husband's death, {{she lived}} in Chelsea, London and Rome, before finally settling on Hayling Island, England.

500|$|During the First World War, a {{wall was}} built {{dividing}} Third Quad from Second Quad to accommodate members of Somerville College in St Mary's Hall while their college buildings {{were being used}} as a military hospital. At that time Oxford separated male and female students as far as possible; Vera Brittain, one of the Somerville students, recalled an amusing occurrence during her time <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> autobiography, Testament of Youth: ...|$|E
500|$|Rapunzel first {{appears in}} Tangled {{as an infant}} princess who is born to a queen. Having {{inherited}} the healing abilities of a magical flower the ailing queen ingested while pregnant, a vain old woman named Mother Gothel kidnaps the infant princess {{in order to use}} her hair to remain young and beautiful forever. Gothel raises the princess in an isolated tower, from which Rapunzel sees the release of thousands of floating lanterns; little does she know that these lanterns are actually the kingdom's way of remembering her. As her eighteenth birthday arrives, Rapunzel grows increasingly eager to leave the tower and see the floating lanterns, and blackmails a wanted thief named Flynn Rider to take her <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> mother's absence. However, Gothel soon learns of Rapunzel's disobedience and pursues them, hiring a pair of thieves to incapacitate Flynn.|$|E
500|$|The album's artwork {{was photographed}} by Harry Langdon in the {{swimming}} pool of the Jackson family's home. Jackson described Langdon as [...] "the sweetest man imaginable". She took inspiration from a photograph of actress Elizabeth Taylor submerged {{in a swimming pool}} which was taken early in her career. In the photograph, nothing could be seen apart from Taylor's face above the water; her body was hidden beneath the surface. Jackson thought the pose was dramatic and loved the fact that she could do the same thing, and not to have to reveal anything except for her face. With the photographer, his assistant and other people around the pool, she was still reluctant to take off her robe, and stand <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> bathing suit. She waited until everybody got distracted to slip into the pool. After they took the photos, she waited until everybody was gone {{to get out of the}} pool.|$|E
60|$|She still {{regarded}} him fixedly. <b>There</b> was <b>in</b> <b>her</b> face {{something of that}} shrinking curiosity with which one looks upon an unclean and horrible thing.|$|R
60|$|The {{man looked}} at her with obvious admiration. Though <b>there</b> was fear <b>in</b> <b>her</b> heart, <b>there</b> was none <b>in</b> <b>her</b> face. She had the pride of her station, and every inborn {{prejudice}} <b>in</b> <b>her</b> protested against submission to any dictation from this intruding ruffian. There was a gleam <b>in</b> <b>her</b> dark eyes, and the red spot showed <b>in</b> <b>her</b> otherwise colourless cheeks again.|$|R

2500|$|In 1929 Mead and Fortune visited Manus, now the northern-most {{province}} of Papua New Guinea, travelling there by boat from Rabaul. She amply describes her stay <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> autobiography {{and it is}} mentioned in her 1984 biography by Jane Howard. On Manus she studied the Manus people of the south coast village of Peri. [...] "Over the next five decades Mead would come back oftener to Peri than to any other field site of her career.|$|E
2500|$|Hurston later used Eatonville as a {{backdrop}} in her stories. It {{was a place where}} African Americans could live as they desired, independent of white society. In 1901, some northern schoolteachers visited Eatonville and gave Hurston a number of books that opened her mind to literature; she described {{it as a kind of}} [...] "birth". [...] Hurston spent the remainder of her childhood in Eatonville, and described the experience of growing up <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> 1928 essay, [...] "How It Feels to Be Colored Me".|$|E
2500|$|He {{has lived}} in a Turtle Bay, Manhattan brownstone since writing Gypsy in 1959. Ten years later, while he was playing music he heard {{a knock on the}} door. His neighbor, Katharine Hepburn, was in [...] "bare feet – this angry, red-faced lady" [...] and told him [...] "You have been keeping me awake all night!" [...] (she was {{practicing}} for her musical debut in Coco). When Sondheim asked why she had not asked him to play for her, she said she lost his phone number. According to Sondheim, [...] "My guess is that she wanted to stand <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> bare feet, suffering for her art".|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{this is not}} my brother's signature?" [...] she asked: and {{she herself}} was not aware what an {{infinity}} of pleading <b>there</b> was <b>in</b> <b>her</b> voice.|$|R
50|$|After <b>her</b> husband's death <b>in</b> 1915, Ady {{moved to}} Oxford and died <b>there</b> <b>in</b> 1924. <b>Her</b> daughter, Cecilia Ady (1881-1958) {{was also a}} Renaissance historian.|$|R

2500|$|Many {{hospitals}} such as Hospital Juárez claim {{she appears}} <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> old 1930s/60s nurse uniform, which is perfectly ironed (hence the name [...] "La Planchada") and heals {{patients in the}} emergency sections. Just as there are claims about how she {{was turned into a}} ghost, there are many others in which eyewitnesses claim she appears. Some say she emits a sort of glow. Others say she looks like a normal nurse. Others say she floats, while others say she walks normally, but her steps are never heard. This happens at night and the next morning patients feel better and are taken to another room for further recovery. When asked why they feel better, patients say that [...] "a nurse came in and healed me", but no one in the hospital was either guarding the room or no nurse came at the time the incident happened.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Why, Honain, what's this? 'Twould seem I {{am really}} joyful. <b>There's</b> {{inspiration}} <b>in</b> <b>her</b> very breath. I am another being. Nay! waste not kisses on those ugly fetters.' ...|$|R

60|$|Then swaying a little, so {{that her}} hair and the flower in it almost touched his face, she passed, and <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> stead stood Oliver.|$|E
6000|$|He {{tried to}} attend to her question. She {{was looking at him}} questioningly. But {{underneath}} the question, what was <b>there,</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> very standing motionless, which affected him? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps," [...] I admitted. [...] "At any rate, {{the money}} remains <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> name. She may find herself in greater need of it {{later on in}} life." ...|$|E
