Although it was probably the most precisely figured optical mirror ever made, smooth to about 10 nanometers, at the perimeter it was too flat by about 2,200 nanometers (2.2 micrometers). This difference was catastrophic, introducing severe spherical aberration, a flaw in which light reflecting off the edge of a mirror focuses on a different point from the light reflecting off its center.|$|E

25|$|Since {{crafting}} large lenses is {{much more}} difficult than crafting large mirrors, most modern telescopes are reflecting telescopes, that is, telescopes that use a primary mirror rather than an objective lens. The same general optical considerations apply to reflecting telescopes that applied to refracting telescopes, namely, the larger <b>the</b> <b>primary</b> <b>mirror,</b> the more light collected, and the magnification is still equal to the focal length of <b>the</b> <b>primary</b> <b>mirror</b> divided by the focal length of the eyepiece.

25|$|Since the Newtonian {{reflector}} is {{the most}} common telescope built by amateur telescope makers, large sections of the literature on the subject are devoted to fabrication of <b>the</b> <b>primary</b> <b>mirror.</b> The mirror has to be carefully ground, polished and figured to an extremely accurate shape, usually a paraboloid. Telescopes with high focal ratios may use spherical mirrors since the difference in the two shapes is insignificant at those ratios. The tools used to achieve this shape are surprisingly simple, consisting of a similarly sized glass tool, a series of finer abrasives, and a polishing pitch lap made from a type of tree sap. Through a whole series of random strokes the mirror naturally tends to become spherical in shape. At that point, a variation in polishing strokes is typically used to create and perfect the desired paraboloidal shape.|$|E
500|$|The {{telescope}} {{is housed in}} an onion-shaped steel dome with an internal diameter of , manufactured by Brittain Steel. The telescope mount is located on a cylindrical concrete pier so that the centre of rotation is [...] above ground level, which lifts the telescope above ground-layer air turbulence for better seeing.

The total moving mass of the dome is , which is mounted on top of a three-storey cylindrical building. The dome was designed to minimise wind stresses and can support up to its own weight again in ice during inclement weather. The dome and telescope rest on separate sets of foundations (driven [...] down into the volcanic basalt), to prevent vibrations caused by dome rotation or wind stresses on the building affecting the telescope pointing.|$|E

2500|$|In the Cassegrain and Gregorian antennas, the {{presence}} of two reflecting surfaces in the signal path offers additional possibilities for improving performance. [...] When the highest performance is required, a technique called [...] "dual reflector shaping" [...] may be used. [...] This involves changing {{the shape of the}} sub-reflector to direct more signal power to outer areas of the dish, to map the known pattern of the feed into a uniform illumination of the primary, to maximize the gain. However, this results in a secondary that is no longer precisely hyperbolic (though it is still very close), so the constant phase property is lost. [...] This phase error, however, can be compensated for by slightly tweaking the shape of <b>the</b> <b>primary</b> <b>mirror.</b> [...] The result is a higher gain, or gain/spillover ratio, at the cost of surfaces that are trickier to fabricate and test.
