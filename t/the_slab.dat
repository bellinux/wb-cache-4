40|$|The {{distribution}} of counterions and the electrostatic interaction between two similarly charged dielectric slabs is {{studied in the}} strong coupling limit. Dielectric inhomogeneities and discreteness of charge on <b>the</b> <b>slabs</b> have been taken into account. It is found {{that the amount of}} dielectric constant difference between <b>the</b> <b>slabs</b> and <b>the</b> environment, and the discreteness of charge on <b>the</b> <b>slabs</b> have opposing effects on the equilibrium {{distribution of}} the counterions. At small inter-slab separations, increasing the amount of dielectric constant difference increases the tendency of the counterions toward the middle of the intersurface space between <b>the</b> <b>slabs</b> and <b>the</b> discreteness of charge pushes them to the surfaces of <b>the</b> <b>slabs.</b> In <b>the</b> limit of point charges, independent of the strength of dielectric inhomogeneity, counterions distribute near the surfaces of <b>the</b> <b>slabs.</b> <b>The</b> interaction between <b>the</b> <b>slabs</b> is attractive at low temperatures and its strength increases with the dielectric constant difference.

5|$|About January 1843, on {{the orders}} of the acting Settlement Engineer, Captain D.H.

Lieutenant-Colonel James Low had petitioned to have the sandstone slab spared, but had been told that it was in the way of a projected bungalow. On the explosion taking place, he crossed the river from his office and selected fragments that had letters on them. As the fragments were very bulky, he had them chiselled into small slabs by a Chinese man. He selected some of the smaller fragments bearing the most legible parts of the inscription and sent them to the Royal Asiatic Society's museum in Calcutta (now known as the Indian Museum) for analysis, where they arrived in about June 1848.|$|E
5|$|The TSR-2 {{was to be}} {{powered by}} two Bristol-Siddeley Olympus reheated turbojets, {{advanced}} variants of those used in the Avro Vulcan. The Olympus would be further developed and would power the supersonic Concorde. The design featured a small shoulder-mounted delta wing with down-turned tips, an all-moving swept tailplane and a large all-moving fin. Blown flaps were fitted across the entire trailing edge of the wing to achieve the short takeoff and landing requirement, something that later designs would achieve with the technically more complex swing-wing approach. No ailerons were fitted, control in roll instead being implemented by differential movement of <b>the</b> <b>slab</b> tailplanes. The wing loading was high for its time, enabling the aircraft to fly at very high speed and low level with great stability without being constantly upset by thermals and other ground-related weather phenomena. The EE Chief Test Pilot, Wing Commander Roland Beamont, favourably compared the TSR-2's supersonic flying characteristics to the Canberra's own subsonic flight characteristics, stating that the Canberra was more troublesome.|$|E

5|$|The tornado {{intensified}} to EF4 {{strength as}} it entered Van Buren County and tore {{through the south}} edge of Clinton, killing three people in the vicinity. One of these deaths occurred at a boat manufacturing plant in town which was destroyed. The plant was completely leveled to the ground, with its metal beam frame severely mangled. Homes in this area were leveled and swept from their foundations, vehicles were wrapped around trees and rendered nearly unrecognizable, a dentists office was obliterated, and trees were debarked. A church and several businesses were damaged as well. 62 homes and mobile homes were destroyed, 30 were severely damaged, and 31 sustained minor damage. The tornado maintained EF4 intensity as it continued into Stone County, slamming into the town of Mountain View. The local hospital sustained heavy roof and wall damage, and several doctors offices were destroyed, along with a paint shop, a body shop, and a car parts store. A car dealership was completely flattened, with vehicles being tossed from the sales lot and across the highway. One vehicle was lofted a considerable distance {{through the air and}} over a building before being dropped into a ravine. Surveyors observed a utility pole in this area that was pulled up and jammed back into the ground with wires still attached. The town's fire station was heavily damaged, and one fatality occurred when a house was swept from its foundation. 38 homes and mobile homes were destroyed, 15 sustained major damage, and 15 sustained minor damage in the Mountain View area. The tornado weakened slightly to high-end EF3 strength as it crossed into Izard County and impacted the rural community of Zion, killing two people, destroying 43 homes and mobile homes, severely damaging 14, and lightly damaging 36 more. Hundreds of cattle were killed in this area, and a Jeep was stripped down to its frame and tires and found wrapped around the stump of a large tree that was snapped. An unanchored home in the area was swept clean from its foundation as well, leaving only <b>the</b> <b>slab</b> behind. Maintaining EF3 intensity, the tornado then struck the town of Highland in Sharp County, resulting in severe damage. At least 40 businesses along U.S. Route 412 in Highland were damaged or destroyed, including a strip mall, a restaurant, a church, and a car dealership. The local fire station was destroyed along with much of the equipment inside, and multiple vehicles were overturned along the highway. 40 homes and mobile homes were destroyed, 8 sustained major damage, and 19 sustained minor damage in the Highland area. Highland High School and two apartment buildings sustained minor damage as well. To the northeast of Highland, the tornado rapidly weakened and dissipated.|$|E
25|$|The process {{consists}} of pumping a cementitous grout or polyurethane mixture through holes drilled through <b>the</b> <b>slab.</b> The grout can fill small voids beneath <b>the</b> <b>slab</b> and/or sub-base. The grout also displaces free water and helps keep water from saturating and weakening support under the joints and slab edge after stabilization is complete. The three steps for this method after finding the voids are locating and drilling holes, grout injection and post-testing the stabilized slabs.|$|E

25|$|Interactions {{with the}} mantle {{discontinuities}} {{play a significant}} role in slab rollback. Stagnation at the 660-km discontinuity causes retrograde slab motion due to the suction forces acting at the surface. Slab rollback induces mantle return flow, which causes extension from the shear stresses at the base of the overriding plate. As slab rollback velocities increase, circular mantle flow velocities also increase, accelerating extension rates. Extension rates are altered when <b>the</b> <b>slab</b> interacts with the discontinuities within the mantle at 410km and 660km depth. Slabs can either penetrate directly into the lower mantle, or can be retarded due to the phase transition at 660km depth creating a difference in buoyancy. An increase in retrograde trench migration (slab rollback) (2–4cm/yr) is a result of flattened slabs at the 660-km discontinuity where <b>the</b> <b>slab</b> does not penetrate into the lower mantle. This is the case for the Japan, Java and Izu-Bonin trenches. These flattened slabs are only temporarily arrested in the transition zone. The subsequent displacement into the lower mantle is caused by slab pull forces, or the destabilization of <b>the</b> <b>slab</b> from warming and broadening due to thermal diffusion. Slabs that penetrate directly into the lower mantle result in slower slab rollback rates (~1–3cm/yr) such as the Mariana arc, Tonga arcs.|$|E

30|$|This {{indicates}} that the temperature differentials of <b>the</b> ICC <b>slab</b> are {{higher than that of}} <b>the</b> standard mix <b>slab.</b> It can be explained that the addition of LWA as an internal curing agent increase the degree of hydration which results in a more dense microstructure and the more dense microstructure results in a decrease in the thermal conductivity of the concrete (Schlitter et al. 2010). This low thermal conductivity of <b>the</b> ICC <b>slab</b> prevents <b>the</b> ICC <b>slab</b> from <b>the</b> fast temperature change inside <b>the</b> concrete <b>slab</b> that may lead to the higher temperature differentials in ICC <b>slabs.</b> In addition, <b>the</b> hourly temperature variation at the middle of AC layer under <b>the</b> standard mix <b>slab</b> is higher than that under <b>the</b> ICC <b>slab</b> as shown in Fig.  2. The low thermal conductivity of ICC slab may also influence the smaller temperature variation in AC layer under <b>the</b> ICC <b>slab</b> compared to that under <b>the</b> standard mix <b>slab.</b>|$|R
30|$|The {{cause of}} {{large-scale}} E-W contraction of <b>the</b> PHS <b>slab</b> is unknown, {{but it is}} evident that E-W crustal shortening has occurred in Honshu in the recent a few Ma, as exemplified by the movement of active faults and the development of mountain ranges (e.g., Huzita 1980; Research Group for Active Faults of Japan 1991). This means that the distance between the Japan Trench and Kyushu has been shortening. Because the location of the volcanic front around the border of northeastern and central Japan has been nearly stable since the Miocene (Seno and Maruyama 1984), it is considered that the dip angle of the subducting Pacific Plate has not changed significantly. Hence, <b>the</b> Pacific <b>slab</b> has moved westward relative to Kyushu in the recent a few Ma. <b>The</b> PHS <b>slab</b> that has subducted along the Nankai Trough lies between <b>the</b> Pacific <b>slab</b> and <b>the</b> mantle beneath Kyushu. Therefore, if <b>the</b> PHS <b>slab</b> could have moved westward beneath Kyushu, coinciding with the westward motion of <b>the</b> Pacific <b>slab,</b> <b>the</b> PHS <b>slab</b> would not have heavily deformed. In fact, however, <b>the</b> PHS <b>slab</b> beneath Kyushu has not moved westward (at least significantly) due to some reason (i.e., <b>the</b> PHS <b>slab</b> here is anchored in the mantle), which results in large deformation of <b>the</b> PHS <b>slab.</b> It is likely that <b>the</b> dense PHS <b>slab</b> beneath Kyushu, which is considered to retreat along the Ryukyu Trench resulting in back-arc spreading to the farther south of Kyushu (e.g., Kamata and Kodama 1999), has resisted to move westward. In brief, it is considered that the westward motion of the Japan Trench and <b>the</b> Pacific <b>slab</b> causes <b>the</b> E-W contraction of both <b>the</b> PHS <b>slab</b> and <b>the</b> overriding plate.|$|R
