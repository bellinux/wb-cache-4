Team captain Bill Neely, recalling the tie with Yale said: [...] "The score {{tells the story}} a good deal better <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>can.</b> All I {{want to say is}} that I never saw a football team fight any harder at every point than Vanderbilt fought today – line, ends, and backfield. We went in to give Yale the best we had and I think we about did it." [...] The team was led by third-team Walter Camp All-American guard Will Metzger, and piloted by Morrison.|$|E

In November 1953, testifying at a war crimes trial, he warned that [...] "there won't be any volunteers for the new German army if the German government continues to try German soldiers for acts committed in World War II". He enthusiastically supported the European Defence Community, and suggested that the [...] "war opponents of yesterday must become the peace comrades and friends of tomorrow".

[...] Sara Vilkomerson said Cruise did [...] "...an astonishingly funny and surprising supporting performance."

500|$|Louise's {{relationship}} with the two sisters closest to the Queen, Beatrice and Helena, was strained at best. Beatrice had married the tall and handsome Prince Henry of Battenberg in a love match in 1885, and they had four children. Louise, who had a jealous nature, had grown accustomed to treating Beatrice with pity {{on account of the}} Queen's constant need for her. Beatrice's biographer, Matthew Dennison, claims that in contrast to Beatrice, Louise remained strikingly good looking throughout her forties. Louise and her husband were no longer close, and rumours spread about Lorne's alleged homosexuality. Thus, Beatrice was enjoying a satisfying sexual {{relationship with}} her popular husband, which Louise was not. Louise may have considered Prince Henry a more appropriate husband for herself. Certainly, following Prince Henry's death in 1896, Louise wrote that: [...] "he [...] was almost the greatest friend I had—I, too, miss him more <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> say". In addition, Louise attempted to champion her late brother-in-law by announcing that she was his confidante and that Beatrice, a mere cipher, meant nothing to him.|$|E

500|$|After {{speaking}} with her friend, Swift became deeply fixated {{on the idea}} of how tragic it would be for the person one loved to wed someone else. That night, Swift experienced a dream where one of her own ex-boyfriends married another girl. To her, this signaled that she had to compose a song about interrupting a wedding. In retrospect, she concluded, [...] "For me, I like {{to think of it as}} good versus evil. And this girl is just completely – just the evil one." [...] Swift entitled the album after [...] "Speak Now" [...] because it fit the album's concept, with each song being a different confession to a person. [...] "It's called Speak Now, and that pertains to the album as a concept and as an entire theme of the record more <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> even tell you," [...] she said. The song was released as a promotional single on October 5, 2010, as part of Countdown to Speak Now, an exclusive campaign launched by the iTunes Store. During the opening week of Speak Now, Swift performed [...] "Speak Now" [...] on the Late Show with David Letterman.|$|E
500|$|Bede's {{account of}} the {{conversion}} is oft-cited. After Paulinus explains the tenets of Christianity, the king asks his counselors {{what they think of}} the new doctrine. Edwin's priest Coifi responds that they may be worthwhile; after all, he says, no one has been more respectful of and devoted to their gods than he, and he has seen no benefits from his dedication to them. Then, an unnamed counselor stands up and addresses the king, also seeing the benefit of the new faith. Coifi speaks again and announces that they should destroy the idols and temples they had hitherto worshiped. King Edwin agrees and embraces Christianity; Coifi himself will set fire to the idols. declaring [...] "I will do this myself, for now that the true God has granted me knowledge, who more suitably <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> set a public example, and destroy the idols that I worshipped in ignorance?” Bede goes on to describe the scene as Cofi [...] "formally renounces his superstitions, and asked the king to give him arms and a stallion." [...] Armed with both a sword and spear, Cofi rides Edwin’s horse towards the idols, all within view of the crowd gathered to witness Edwin’s conversion. Upon reaching the temple, Cofi [...] "cast a spear into it and profaned it." ...|$|E
500|$|Shakira {{felt it was}} {{something}} she had not [...] "tapped into {{for the past three}} years," [...] and its inclusion in the album resulted in [...] "very intense, very romantic" [...] songs. [...] "Antes de las Seis" [...] is one such song from the album. The Latin pop ballad was written and produced by Shakira and her frequent collaborator Lester Mendez, who had previously worked with her on songs including [...] "Underneath Your Clothes" [...] (2002) and [...] "La Tortura" [...] (2005). The musical instrumentation of the song is simple and consists of a piano and acoustic guitar. According to Jennifer Schaffer from The Stanford Daily, its [...] "softer" [...] production helps in putting the focus on Shakira's voice, which she opined had been [...] "stripped to its sensitive core." [...] The singer delivers sad and emotional vocals that address issues of [...] "longing, regrets and loneliness." [...] Shakira talked about the deep meaning behind the balladry of the album and expressed difficulty in explaining it, saying: [...] "We all go through hard moments. Whatever happened, it's right there in the songs. I've decided that I'm not going to explain every song this time. It's hard to explain a song. These songs explain me better <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> explain them." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{band has}} named the group Melvins as an {{influence}} on its development, but the most-publicized influence is progressive rock pioneer group King Crimson. Longtime King Crimson member Robert Fripp has downplayed any influence his band had on Tool. In an interview, Fripp touched on how the two bands relate to each other, stating [...] "Do you hear the influence? There's just one figure where I hear an influence, just one. It was a piece we were developing that we dropped. And it's {{almost exactly the same}} figure: three note arpeggio with a particular accent from the guitar. So I do not think you could have heard it. That's the only thing." [...] He also said, [...] "I happen to be a Tool fan. The members of Tool have been generous enough to suggest that Crimson has been {{an influence on}} them. Adam Jones asked me if I could detect it in their music, and I said I couldn’t. I can detect more Tool influence in King Crimson, <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> hear King Crimson in Tool." [...] In describing their wide range of styles, critics have noted that they are [...] "influenced as much by Pink Floyd as by the Sex Pistols". Other reported influences of the band include Rush, Helmet, Faith No More and Jane's Addiction.|$|E
500|$|Distinguished {{for being}} the remake's [...] "most powerful" [...] {{original}} song, [...] "Evermore" [...] {{has been described as}} a [...] "big" [...] and [...] "romantic" [...] number by music critics. A [...] "soaring ballad" [...] bolstered by [...] "grand orchestration", WTOP's Jason Fraley described [...] "Evermore" [...] as a [...] "haunting song of longing"; a [...] "mournful love song" [...] that crescendos into a powerful lament about lost love. An emotionally delivered power ballad, the Belfast Telegraph agreed that the ballad is [...] "a soaring lament of longing". The accompaniment begins with the Beast's [...] "eerie" [...] theme before transitioning into a solo, first emerging from the film's [...] "Rose" [...] theme before taking on its central melody and instrumental bridge. Despite being a miserable [...] "lovesick ballad", the somber tone of which Chris Knight of the National Post likened to songs from the musical Les Misérables, the ballad is a more upbeat offering than its Broadway counterpart, [...] "If I Can't Love Her", [...] "captur the elaborate aesthetic of musical theatre". However, the track remains one of the more melancholy inclusions on a soundtrack that consists of largely upbeat songs and musical numbers, contributing a sense of emotional depth to the album. Writing for Elle, Alyssa Bailey dubbed the song a [...] "Broadway version of a breakup ballad", which features the lyrics [...] "I let her steal into my melancholy heart/It's more <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> bear," [...] as [...] "swoon" [...] by Stevens. Musically, the track bares similarities to songs from Disney's animated film The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996), which Menken himself also composed, as well as the work of musical theatre composer Andrew Lloyd Webber.|$|E

2500|$|On 12 January 1921, Elwes {{was killed}} in a horrific {{accident}} at Back Bay railway station in Boston, Massachusetts, {{in the midst of a}} high-profile recital tour of the United States at the height of his powers. Elwes and his wife had alighted on the platform when the singer attempted to return to the conductor an overcoat that had fallen off the train. He leaned over too far and was hit by the train, falling between the moving carriages and the platform. He died of his injuries a few hours later. He was 54 years old. A week after the event, Edward Elgar wrote to Percy Hull, 'my personal loss is greater <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> bear to think upon, but this is nothing – or I must call it so – compared to the general artistic loss – a gap impossible to fill – in the musical world.' ...|$|E

In a tweet just before 4 p.m. EST, citing a [...] "highly credible source within the CBC", Brown {{was the first to}} report on Jian Ghomeshi's [...] "indefinite leave" [...] from the Canadian public broadcaster. Though the CBC immediately denied this via a tweet from its head of public affairs Chuck Thompson, Brown continued tweeting about there being [...] "much more to this <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> report at this moment" [...] before further indicating that the situation is unrelated to the recent passing of Ghomeshi's father as many had already assumed. By 5:30 PM EST, the CBC confirmed the news of Ghomeshi's [...] "undetermined leave for personal issues" [...] to The Canadian Press news agency with even Ghomeshi himself tweeting within thirty minutes about [...] "taking some much needed personal time".|$|E
2500|$|Though she {{considered}} herself a Democrat at the time, Crosby was a keen admirer {{of the leading}} Whig, U.S. Senator Henry Clay of Kentucky, who in 1848 made a tour of large eastern cities. He visited the New York Institution for the Blind in New York City, where Crosby lived. The visit came {{two years after the}} death of Henry Clay, Jr., in the Mexican-American War. Crosby recalled that [...] "the great statesman was never quite himself after his son's death, and I purposely avoided all mention of it in the address of welcome on the day he came to visit us, lest I mighty wound the heart of the man whom I had learned not only to venerate but to love; for Mr. Clay was always an especial favorite among public men. There was a strength in his character and an earnestness in his speeches that appealed to me more <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> tell. ... I would have challenged any person, whether Whig or Democrat, Northerner or Southerner to come within range of the man's eloquence [...] without being moved to admiration and profound respect; for his personal magnetism was wonderful." ...|$|E

Writing to Nicholas back home once again, George said about his trip to Denmark, [...] "Of course it was good to see the family after 4 years, but it did not really do me any good, as I lost more than 5 pounds which I had put on with such difficulty in May and June.
