40|$|Background: Procalcitonin level can {{increase}} {{in patients with}} liver cirrhosis without bacterial infection. The {{aim of this study}} is to identify the role of procalcitonin in patients with liver cirrhosis without bacterial infection. Methods: Cross-sectional study was performed to patients with liver cirrhosis without bacterial infection. In patients, we performed procalcitonin level examination and bacterial infection identification. Further, we analysed them to know the procalcitonin level difference in patients with compensated and decompensated liver cirrhosis without bacterial infection. Results: We obtained 39 patients with liver cirrhosis without bacterial infection, male 61. 5 % with compensated condition found in 17 patients and decompensated in 22 patients. We found significant difference in the average of procalcitonin level in decompensated patients (0. 738 ng/mL ± 1. 185) compared <b>to</b> <b>compensated</b> (0. 065 ng/mL ± 0. 022). Conclusion: Procalcitonin level increased in patients with liver cirrhosis without bacterial infection.
