5|$|Texas {{honored the}} Texas horned lizard in 1993, but private Texas Christian University {{has had the}} {{associated}} mascot the Horned Frog since 1896. According to legend, the football team identified with the lizards found on <b>the</b> <b>practice</b> <b>field</b> as the athletes and reptiles were similarly scrappy. The college founder's son, Addison Clark Jr., a faculty member and the initiator of the football team, had been fascinated by the creatures. By 1897, the lizard appeared as a logo {{on the front of}} the school yearbook, which Clark had also started and was managing.|$|E
5|$|The team {{conducted}} intense preparations {{during the}} spring and fall practices before the 1940 season. On one occasion, Stanford athletic director Al Masters angrily complained that the maintenance department had left on <b>the</b> <b>practice</b> <b>field</b> lights, only to be told that the team was still practicing. In one scrimmage, the varsity offense managed only a single touchdown against the freshman team, which prompted Shaughnessy to secretly draft a single-wing playbook in the event that the T formation failed.|$|E
5|$|For the 2017–18 school year, the Florida State Athletics Department budgeted $103.2 {{million for}} its sports teams and {{facilities}} and currently brings in over $121.3 million in revenues. Florida State University {{is known for}} its competitive athletics in both men's and women's sports competitions. The men's program consists of baseball, basketball, cross country running, football, golf, swimming, tennis, and track & field. The women's program consists of basketball, cross country running, golf, soccer, softball, swimming, tennis, track & field, and volleyball. FSU's Intercollegiate Club sports include bowling, crew, rugby, soccer and lacrosse. Harkins Field is an artificial turf field that is home to the lacrosse team as well as serving as <b>the</b> <b>practice</b> <b>field</b> for the Marching Chiefs of the College of Music and the football team.|$|E
25|$|The {{band has}} outdoor <b>practice</b> <b>fields</b> used for rehearsals during the week. The outdoor fields {{also include a}} 133-square-foot base conductor's tower which oversees <b>the</b> <b>practice</b> <b>fields.</b>|$|R
25|$|From 1996 until 2012, the Lehigh Valley was {{the home}} of {{pre-season}} training camp for the NFL's Philadelphia Eagles, which was held each summer on <b>the</b> <b>practice</b> <b>fields</b> of Lehigh University in Bethlehem.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> school's <b>practice</b> <b>fields</b> total {{approximately}} 500,000 sq ft.|$|R
25|$|The USC {{football}} team practices on campus at Howard Jones Field, which was expanded {{in the fall}} of 1998 to include Brian Kennedy Field. In early 1999, Goux's Gate, named for the player and popular long-time assistant coach Marv Goux, was erected at the entrance to <b>the</b> <b>practice</b> <b>field.</b>|$|E
25|$|All {{practices}} {{take place}} at the O. Richard Bundy Blue Band Building (dedicated in October 2015), the home of the band as of Fall 2004, or on <b>the</b> <b>practice</b> <b>field</b> next to it. A few weeks into the football season, however, Intramural Sports occupy the field on Tuesdays, so the band rehearses on the turf fields next to Holuba Hall, just off of University Drive.|$|E
25|$|The trend would reverse {{again as}} George Young {{took over the}} {{coaching}} duties in 1959. Young had actually been a history teacher at City, but an assistant coach at rival Calvert Hall College. Young brought discipline back to <b>the</b> <b>practice</b> <b>field</b> and an emphasis on grades. He also brought in young aggressive special teams coaches Joe Brune, Bob Patzwall, Mel Filler, and Ed Novak; all of whom would become head coaches later in their careers with Brune coaching the Loyola Dons for more than 25 years.|$|E
50|$|Also in 1904, the {{athletic}} teams received their nickname of Bulldogs from a sportswriter who noticed that John L. Griffith, who coached every sport, was bringing his pet bulldogs to <b>the</b> <b>practice</b> <b>fields.</b> <b>The</b> teams {{had previously been}} known as the Ducklings and Ganders.|$|R
50|$|Campus amenities, {{include an}} Olympic-sized {{swimming}} pool, an entertainment arena, and sports courts (basketball, tennis, handball, netball, volleyball). The university is {{adjacent to the}} National Stadium, which is available for university use. <b>The</b> <b>practice</b> <b>fields</b> outside <b>the</b> stadium are the location for university intramural sports.|$|R
50|$|Coach McGee quickly regrouped {{the coaches}} {{and the team}} and hit <b>the</b> <b>practice</b> <b>fields</b> {{to prepare for the}} game. It would be Coach McGee's first game as a college head coach. With the {{historic}} nature of the game he left nothing to chance in preparing the team.|$|R
25|$|By {{the end of}} the 2004 season, the Packers team depth {{appeared}} to be diminishing. Sherman also seemed overworked and reportedly had trouble communicating with players on <b>the</b> <b>practice</b> <b>field</b> with whom he was also negotiating contracts. Harlan felt the dual roles were too much for one man to handle and removed Sherman from the GM position in early 2005, while retaining him as a head coach. Harlan hired Seattle Seahawks Vice President of Operations Ted Thompson as the new Executive Vice President, General Manager and Director of Football Operations. The relationship between Thompson and Sherman appeared strained, as Thompson immediately began rebuilding Green Bay's roster. Following a dismal 4–12 season, Thompson fired Sherman.|$|E
25|$|During {{the second}} summer {{session at the}} University, both Moore and Sharpe began to work with players on the {{offensive}} change, and in August Royal and Bellard traveled to Tuscaloosa and led a coaching clinic for the Alabama staff on the wishbone. In {{order to keep the}} change a secret, Bryant closed all of the Crimson Tide's practices closed from the public, screened <b>the</b> <b>practice</b> <b>field</b> from view with a canvas and hired security to keep people away. The change to the wishbone was kept under such secrecy that when the media would visit practice, Bryant had the team practice the pro-style system that was phased out. Alabama later opened the season with an upset victory over USC that was credited to the surprise switch to the wishbone that caught the Trojans off-guard.|$|E
25|$|Bill Harkins Field at the Manley R. Whitcomb Band Complex is an {{artificial}} turf with rubber fill field built near the Flying High Circus on Chieftain Way. The field is an exact replica of what Bobby Bowden field looked like on game {{days at the}} time of the field's construction. Since then several alterations have been made to the actual field. Bill Harkins, head coach of the men's lacrosse team from 2004 to 2013, donated $350,000 towards the construction of the new field. Previously the space was a grassy field that often alternated between dusty and muddy. The Florida State University Marching Chiefs have primary use of the field and use it for their daily practices. The football team and lacrosse teams have secondary use of the field with the lacrosse team using the field for practices and games. The football team sometimes uses <b>the</b> <b>practice</b> <b>field</b> in anticipation of games at stadiums with artificial turf.|$|E
30|$|If the {{scientific}} system is one pole of participatory (futures) research, <b>the</b> <b>practice</b> <b>fields</b> that are characterised by the pragmatic logic {{of everyday life}} are the other pole. Being on the “cross-border”, the participatory researcher inevitably gets caught {{in the sphere of}} influence of both interaction systems. This also gives rise to the dual need to prove legitimisation: before {{the scientific}} system in view of fulfilling the content and form related quality factors of scientific work (see further below in this article); and before <b>the</b> respective <b>practice</b> <b>field</b> in view of the practical usefulness of theory-guided recommendations.|$|R
50|$|Full network {{capabilities}} in all campus buildings and each residence hall room. Students {{have access to}} more than 1,300 computers and a complex system of workstations and laboratories. Wireless connectivity is available across 97% of the campus (the other 3% being <b>the</b> <b>practice</b> <b>fields)</b> and {{in all of the}} residence halls.|$|R
50|$|In 2006, {{despite being}} {{fired by the}} University of North Texas, a donor {{requested}} that school officials name <b>the</b> new football <b>practice</b> facility in honor of him. The donor {{did not want to}} have his own name branded on <b>the</b> <b>practice</b> <b>fields,</b> but believed <b>the</b> program's accomplishments under his leadership deemed Dickey worthy of the naming rights.|$|R
2500|$|Before Baum Stadium was built, the Razorbacks {{played on}} the {{original}} George Cole Field from 1975–1995, named for former all-conference quarterback, shortstop and athletic director George Cole. [...] The field was next to John McDonnell Field, home of the outdoor track and field team, and has since been turned into <b>the</b> <b>practice</b> <b>field</b> for the football team.|$|E
2500|$|Brown said, [...] "As a team, {{our focus}} will be on getting that 10th win and keeping our bowl winning streak alive. [...] We've {{got a lot of work}} to do and the Holiday Bowl always seems to be a wild game with lots of sudden changes so we're looking forward to getting back on <b>the</b> <b>practice</b> <b>field</b> and {{preparing}} to play." ...|$|E
2500|$|In August 2009, Williams and {{her sister}} Serena became part-owners of the Miami Dolphins. The {{announcement}} was made during a press conference overlooking <b>the</b> <b>practice</b> <b>field.</b> This made the sisters the first African-American females to obtain ownership in an NFL franchise. Stephan Ross, the majority owner of the Dolphins, said [...] "We are thrilled to have Venus and Serena join the Dolphins as limited partners. They {{are among the most}} admired athletes in the world and have become global ambassadors for the game of tennis. Their addition to our ownership group further reflects our commitment to connect with aggressively and embrace the great diversity that makes South Florida a multicultural gem." ...|$|E
50|$|Part of {{a larger}} {{athletic}} compound, including several other tennis courts, a gymnasium, and <b>the</b> <b>practice</b> <b>fields</b> for Vegalta Sendai, Shellcom Sendai is located approximately 25 minutes by foot from Izumi-Chūō Station, on the Sendai Subway Nanboku Line; and {{less than five minutes}} from the Izumi parking area ETC exit of the Tōhoku Expressway.|$|R

2500|$|While on <b>the</b> <b>practice</b> <b>field,</b> the guardsmen {{generally}} {{faced the}} parking lot which was about [...] away. At one point, some of them knelt and aimed their weapons toward {{the parking lot}}, then stood up again. At one point the guardsmen formed a loose huddle {{and appeared to be}} talking to one another. They had cleared the protesters from the Commons area, and many students had left, but some stayed and were still angrily confronting the soldiers, some throwing rocks and tear gas canisters. About 10 minutes later, the guardsmen began to retrace their steps back up the hill toward the Commons area. Some of the students on the Taylor Hall veranda began to move slowly toward the soldiers as they passed {{over the top of the}} hill and headed back into the Commons.|$|E
2500|$|In 2005, head {{football}} coach Terry Hoeppner had a southern Indiana limestone boulder nicknamed [...] "The Rock" [...] installed in the north end zone as a new campus tradition. [...] This limestone boulder was found prior to Hoeppner's first season at IU in <b>the</b> <b>practice</b> <b>field.</b> [...] It was removed, put on a granite slab {{and moved to the}} stadium. The Hoosiers and coach Hoeppner walked out and touched the Rock before running onto the field at every home game during Hoeppner's time as head coach (a tradition that continues today). [...] Terry Hoeppner died of brain cancer on June 19, 2007, and The Rock (renamed [...] "Hep's Rock" [...] during a ceremony with the Hoeppner family on November 6, 2010) now serves as motivation for the team as well as a tribute to Hoeppner's influence on the football program.|$|E
2500|$|Taylor also {{developed}} a reputation as the clown on the Giants' team of the 1900s. [...] In April 1905, The New York Times wrote about Taylor's efforts to maintain a light atmosphere in the Giants' locker room. [...] The Times described Taylor's post-shower wrestling matches with Frank Bowerman and his displays of the Japanese martial art, jiu-jitsu, adding:The [...] "Dummy" [...] is always smiling. [...] No matter whether {{in the dressing room}} or on <b>the</b> <b>practice</b> <b>field</b> he is the clown of the crowd. [...] If a joke is told he makes Bowerman repeat it to him with his fingers. [...] Then he emits a cacophonous cackle that passes for a laugh. [...] "It is a good thing Taylor can't tell stories", remarked McGraw one morning, [...] "or I never {{should be able to get}} any work out of you fellows." ...|$|E
2500|$|There are {{two main}} reasons why the stadium was not {{originally}} a fully enclosed [...] "bowl" [...] like, for example, Michigan Stadium or the Rose Bowl. First, access to the three outdoor football <b>practice</b> <b>fields,</b> which are behind the south end zone seats, would have been restricted by completely enclosing {{the south end of}} the stadium. Secondly, any enclosure would have forced the baseball field, which shared its outfield with <b>the</b> <b>practice</b> <b>fields</b> until 1982, to shorten its left field line considerably.|$|R
40|$|This ongoing {{research}} {{examines how}} early childhood practitioners build, shape, and maintain digital practices through talk and action, assuming shared construction {{and development of}} knowledge. Based on empirical data I suggest looking beyond the social situated idea of knowledge building to include multiple elements, like individual knowledge, discourse and materiality, in analyses of <b>the</b> digital <b>practice</b> <b>field</b> in kindergarten. <b>The</b> discussions are both theoretically and empirically driven and tend to create a dynamic context model as a representation of <b>the</b> digital <b>practice</b> <b>field...</b>|$|R

2500|$|Since 1962 {{the school}} has been {{accredited}} by AdvancED and by 1965 the school won its first sports state championship in baseball. When North Pulaski High School was opened in 1977, the school board zones were redrawn, which subsequently {{has led to a}} natural rivalry between the two schools throughout the years. In the 1990s, the high school facility began serving grades 9–12, shifting the junior high to be renamed as Sylvan Hills Middle School for grades 6–8. In April 2008, the school suffered severe roof damage from a storm's high winds resulting in over $750,000 (present day $) in repairs. Following those repairs, the school dedicated the Jim Burgett Auditorium in honor of the school's musical director from 1967 to 1982. By 2011, major renovations had been completed to the school's gymnasium, bathrooms and the construction of a bridge to <b>the</b> <b>practice</b> <b>field.</b> [...] Since the original construction, {{the school has}} added several smaller buildings, including the East and West buildings, the automotive shop facilities and has housed temporary buildings throughout the years based on changing student populations.|$|E
2500|$|If melee weapons {{could not}} be brought into combat, such as during long range defense, Qi {{recommended}} waiting [...] "until the face-the-enemy signal , and then, whether from behind wooden stockades, or from moat banks, or from below abatis (拒馬), [...] open up on the enemy, firing by turns (更番射賊). Those who are empty reload; those who are full fire again. While {{the ones who have}} fired are loading, those who are full then fire again. In this way, all day long, the firing of guns will not be lacking, and there must be no firing to the point of exhaustion [...] and no slipups with guns." [...] In 1571 Qi prescribed an ideal infantry regiment of 1080 arquebusiers out of 2700 men, or 40 percent of the infantry force. However it is not known how well this was actually implemented, and there is evidence that Qi was met with stiff resistance to the incorporation of newer gunpowder weapons in northern China while he was stationed there. He writes that [...] "in the north soldiers are stupid and impatient, {{to the point that they}} cannot see the strength of the musket, and they insist on holding tight to their fast lances (a type of fire lance), and although when comparing and vying on <b>the</b> <b>practice</b> <b>field</b> the musket can hit the bullseye ten times better than the fast-lance and five times better than the bow and arrow, they refuse to be convinced." ...|$|E
60|$|Toward {{the close}} of March the weather grew warm, <b>the</b> <b>practice</b> <b>field</b> dried up, and {{baseball}} {{should have been a}} joy to Ken. But it was not. At times he had a shameful wish to quit the field for good, but he had not the courage to tell the coach. The twenty-fifth, the day scheduled for the game with the disgraced varsity team, loomed closer and closer. Its approach was a fearful thing for Ken. Every day he cast furtive glances down the field to where the varsity held practice. Ken had nothing to say; he was as glum as most of the other candidates, but he had heard gossip in the lecture-rooms, in the halls, on the street, everywhere, and it concerned this game. What would the old varsity do to Arthurs' new team? Curiosity ran as high as the feeling toward the athletic directors. Resentment flowed from every source. Ken somehow got the impression that he was blamable for {{being a member of the}} coach's green squad. So Ken Ward fluctuated between two fears, one as bad as the other--that he would not be selected to play, and the other that he would be selected. It made no difference. He would be miserable if not chosen, and if he was--how on earth would he be able to keep his knees from wobbling? Then the awful day dawned.|$|E
