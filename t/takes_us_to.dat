5|$|Ruiz {{notes that}} writing {{also has the}} power to {{transform}} reality. It brings the reader back to the past, allowing the reader to comprehend myths or distorted stories told by historians. Ruiz contends that knowing the past is crucial to one's understanding of the present that <b>takes</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> postmodernism, and argues that The Feast of the Goat can thus be seen as a postmodern discourse that gives power to history recreation.|$|E
5|$|Brian and Stewie go to {{the mall}} so they can meet Santa, but Peter is asking Santa for gifts (he asks for a game of Uno, a Magna Doodle, a pet chink (a mix of a {{chinchilla}} and a mink) and a Charles in Charge lunchbox.) When the mall Santa leaves for the night and Brian demands that he let Stewie sit in his lap, Santa mentions he will be at Applebee's. Stewie says that Santa leaving before he got a chance to sit in his lap felt like a bigger betrayal than the betrayal of Gary Busey by reality; this <b>takes</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> Busey looking himself in the mirror asking his reflection, {{in the form of a}} crazed clown, how he is doing.|$|E
25|$|The third first-person {{narration}} from Alhambra follows, {{which is}} much the same as the second. We then have “The End”, which <b>takes</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> the Smart home once they return from holiday. The house has been emptied of all possessions – we must assume, as the family do, by Amber – leaving nothing but the answering machine, which contains messages forcing Magnus, Michael and Eve to face up to their past. Magnus and Astrid seem freed and excited by the experience of losing their possessions, their past – Michael also seems to find some redemption. Eve, however, runs away from the family, embarking on a round-the-world tour – eventually ending up in America, where she goes in search of her old family home. “The End” ends, ominously, with Eve seeming to take up Amber’s mantle, arriving at someone’s house as an uninvited guest. The book then finishes with a short section from Alhambra, reinforcing her connection to the cinema.|$|E

500|$|For New Amerykah Part One, Badu collaborated principally with Questlove, Madlib, 9th Wonder, Karriem Riggins, James Poyser, audio {{engineer}} Mike [...] "Chav" [...] Chavarria, and {{the members}} of musical group Sa-Ra, who made production and lyrical contributions to most of the tracks. She later explained choosing which producers to work with, saying [...] "All of these people have a reputation for being visionaries and knowing them well, I felt 'Okay, now it's time to put together a project that not only <b>takes</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> another place, another dimension, but highlights these sights.' And that's what I had in mind for this project".|$|E
500|$|In May 1915, the Turkish {{force that}} would confront the New Zealanders was {{provided}} by the 19th Division, comprising the 57th, 72nd and 77th Infantry Regiments, all under the command of Colonel Mustafa Kemal. Kemal was noted as [...] "the most imaginative, most successful officer to fight on either side" [...] during the Gallipoli Campaign. How the Turks viewed the invasion can be judged by Kemal's orders to his troops following the initial landings; [...] "Men, I am not ordering you to attack. I am ordering you to die. In the time that it <b>takes</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> die, other forces and commanders can come and take our place." ...|$|E
500|$|In February 2015, it was {{revealed}} that Arkham Knight had received a [...] "Mature" [...] rating from the ESRB, rather than the [...] "Teen" [...] ratings previous installments in the franchise held. Sefton Hill and the Rocksteady team were caught off guard by the rating; Hill explained that they did not create the game with a specific rating in mind, but that [...] "It's unavoidable that some bad stuff is going to happen. But that doesn't mean we changed our approach. We're not including gratuitous blood or swearing. We want to deliver a true end with no compromises, and it <b>takes</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> some dark places." [...] Although he did not elaborate which content in particular triggered the [...] "M" [...] rating, Hill did note that a [...] "ratings analysis" [...] by Warner Bros. indicated that the content of certain [...] "key" [...] scenes in the game could affect its rating. The team decided to maintain the offending content so that it would not [...] "jeopardize" [...] their vision for the game and its thematics. In an in-depth explanation of the game's content, the ESRB revealed the existence of scenes where players can [...] "shoot unarmed characters and a hostage", and torture scenes taking place on a [...] "bloody operating table" [...] as well as using a vehicle's wheel.|$|E

500|$|Ariana Bacle of Entertainment Weekly {{called the}} music [...] "very Chronicle", {{comparing}} the video to Max Landis' previous work. Rachel Paoletta of MTV News describes the music video as [...] "a decidedly darker and more badass video" [...] compared to her [...] "sexy, sultry, and sandy video for 'Love Me Harder'". She {{also stated that}} [...] "Ariana Grande's new video <b>takes</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> {{the end of the}} world, and brings us to the edge of our seats". In response to similarities between the Grande video and the music video accompanying Australian band SAFIA's single [...] "You Are the One", Grande and Landis were accused of intellectual property theft. The controversy centered on similarities in the shared apocalyptic themes and stylistic format (a single, tracking shot) as well as parallels in the beginning of both videos (where a female protagonist exits a vehicle despite the protests of the male driver) and final shot (a lover's embrace as the world comes to an end around them). Members of the band described the similarities as an instance of when [...] "big labels and/or big film firms steal ideas from small independent creatives who are trying really hard to make something different for a change". Despite acknowledging similarities between the two videos, Landis denied that his ideas are stolen from them and commented that both music videos had much in common with a third earlier music video by Perth group Injured Ninja.|$|E
500|$|On the Turkish side, by {{that night}} the 2nd Battalion 57th Infantry were on Baby 700, the 3rd Battalion, reduced to only ninety men, were at The Nek, and the 1st Battalion on Mortar Ridge. Just south {{of them was the}} 77th Infantry, next was the 27th Infantry {{opposite}} 400 Plateau. The last regiment, the 72nd Infantry, were on Battleship Hill. As for manpower, the Turks were in a similar situation to the ANZACs. Of the two regiments most heavily involved, the 57th had been destroyed, and the 27th were exhausted with heavy casualties. Large numbers of the 77th had deserted, and the regiment was in no condition to fight. The 72nd was largely intact, but they were a poorly trained force of Arab conscripts. The III Corps, having to deal with both landings, could not assist as they had no reserves available. It was not until 27 April that the 33rd and 64th Infantry Regiments arrived to reinforce the Turkish forces. The ANZACs, however, had been unable to achieve their obectives, and therefore dug in. Gallipoli, like the Western Front, turned into a war of attrition. The German commander, Liman von Saunders, was clear about the reasons for the outcome. He wrote that, [...] "on the Turkish side the situation was saved by the immediate and independent action of the 19th Division." [...] The division commander, Kemal, became noted as [...] "the most imaginative, most successful officer to fight on either side" [...] during the campaign. As a commander he was able {{to get the most out}} of his troops, typified by his order to the 57th Infantry Regiment; [...] "Men, I am not ordering you to attack. I am ordering you to die. In the time that it <b>takes</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> die, other forces and commanders can come and take our place." ...|$|E

2500|$|The album {{received}} {{very positive}} reviews. Pavithra Srinivasan from Rediff noted that Billas music [...] "rocks" [...] {{and gave it}} four out of five. The reviewer wrote: [...] "Yuvan Shankar Raja has etched an intricate musical feast to compliment the tale – and quite a feast it's turned out to be, a la the original". She concluded The guitar-ridden theme song was the most appreciated song, with a reviewer from Indiaglitz.com writing that the track was a [...] "masterly work from young Yuvan..... <b>takes</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> a different world", while another reviewer from Behindwoods wrote {{that it was the}} [...] "soul of the film" [...] which [...] "stands out as the highlight of the album, giving that eerie feel required of a film about a don" [...] and an [...] "interesting composition with arrangements that spell international quality".|$|E
2500|$|The {{government}} appealed, {{and by a}} 2–1 margin the jury's {{verdict was}} restored. Robert Arthur Sprecher, following United States v. Shryock, an earlier case from the Fifth Circuit where the defendant had been {{the head of the}} leasing department at a new-car dealership, held that the ongoing nature of the scheme distinguished the case and supported the jury verdict. But concurring Judge Richard Dickson Cudahy, calling the statute [...] "judicially [...] " [...] warned that [...] "the present case <b>takes</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> what (for now) may be the outer limits". Luther Merritt Swygert dissented. [...] "The mailings did not conceal the fraud, produce profit for Galloway or contribute to the consumer's harm," [...] he wrote. [...] "The mailings resulted from a transaction to which Galloway was not a party and they were routine business mailings the purposes of which were immaterial to Galloway." [...] He distinguished that case from Shryock by noting that Shryock had been a retail dealer, selling directly to consumers, instead of a wholesaler.|$|E
2500|$|Vince Aletti from Rolling Stone {{also gave}} an {{unfavorable}} review, stating [...] "the formula is more rigorously locked in than before, {{and the range}} so tightly circumscribed that Houston's potential seems to have shrunk rather than expanded" [...] and the record is [...] "smug, repressive and ridiculously safe." [...] Also, he made some sarcastic comments about the first single, [...] "I Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me)", calling it [...] "How Will I Know II", spoken at Hollywood's blockbuster sequels. Robert Hilburn, in his review for Los Angeles Times, regarded the album as [...] "another commercial blockbuster", writing that the record is [...] "a series of highly accessible selections that will work {{on a variety of}} radio formats." [...] However, he expressed his considerable disappointment that Whitney did precious little to define the singer's vision, adding that she had a sensational voice but didn't assert much vocal character on it. Dolores Barclay of The Associated Press complimented Houston on her vocal ability: [...] "Whitney Houston has a fine instrument and uses it well. Her voice <b>takes</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> places we know and to places we might want to forget and to places we dream about." [...] But she, like other critics, was critical of the song material on the record, commenting [...] "There is no depth, and not much excitement. Nor does this talented song stylist and Grammy winner take risks and try something just a little daring." [...] St. Petersburg Times showed a favorable attitude toward her new album at large, stating [...] " [...] is, first and foremost, a product. It has been carefully designed, manufactured and packaged. As such, it's easy to be cynical about. But as products go, this is a pretty good one." [...] They also praised her vocals as follows: [...] "Houston's voice sounds good, real good. [...] She's firmer, more confident." ...|$|E
