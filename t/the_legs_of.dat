5|$|Mahavira {{is usually}} {{depicted}} in a sitting or standing meditative posture with {{the symbol of}} a lion beneath him. Every Tīrthankara has a distinguishing emblem that allows worshippers to distinguish similar-looking idols of the Tirthankaras. The lion emblem of Mahavira is usually carved below <b>the</b> <b>legs</b> <b>of</b> the Tirthankara. Like all Tirthankaras, Mahavira is depicted with Shrivatsa and downcast eyes.|$|E

Nandanar fits in the Dalit narrative that proves that their religiosity is on par or superior to the higher castes. They say that Nandanar was 'swallowed by God'.

5|$|After the season, Goal.com {{reported}} that Ipswich Town had lodged a £3 million bid to secure Chopra's services. Though it was increased, he continued {{the next season}} with Cardiff City. In the 2010–11 season, he suffered a hamstring injury during a match against Barnsley on 23 April 2011 ruling him out of action for 10 to 12 weeks. A statement released by the club confirmed the blow, speculating {{that they would be}} required to finish the season without him However, he would return to feature in both <b>the</b> <b>legs</b> <b>of</b> the Championship play-offs against Reading. In the second leg, he was near to scoring, only for his shot to be deflected by Reading captain Matt Mills.|$|E
5|$|Chelsea {{travelled}} to White Hart Lane to face Tottenham Hotspur in {{the sixth}} round. The team finished the tie as comfortable 4–0 winners, never looking as though they would crumble once William Gallas scored inside 12 minutes. The one negative from their performance was the dismissal of Graeme Le Saux for a second bookable offence in the second half. Local rivals Fulham were Chelsea's semi-final opponents. A scrappy match, which saw Fulham dominate much of the play but creating little, was settled in Chelsea's favour. Terry scored just before half time, heading the ball through <b>the</b> <b>legs</b> <b>of</b> Louis Saha standing in Fulham's goal.|$|E

5|$|In 1922, the American {{explorer}} Roy Chapman Andrews led a {{well documented}} expedition to China and Mongolia {{sponsored by the}} American Museum of Natural History. Various indricothere remains were found in formations of the Mongolian Gobi Desert, including <b>the</b> <b>legs</b> <b>of</b> a specimen standing in an upright position, indicating that it had died while trapped in quicksand, {{as well as a}} very complete skull. These remains became the basis of Baluchitherium grangeri, named by Osborn in 1923.|$|E
5|$|In {{developmental}} biology, organs {{that developed}} in the embryo {{in the same manner}} and from similar origins, such as from matching primordia in successive segments of the same animal, are serially homologous. Examples include <b>the</b> <b>legs</b> <b>of</b> a centipede, the maxillary palp and labial palp of an insect, and the spinous processes of successive vertebrae in a vertebral column. Male and female reproductive organs are homologous if they develop from the same embryonic tissue, as do the ovaries and testicles of mammals including humans.|$|E

The area below the head is thickly coated with white and orange paint, while the inspection exposes a series of underlying curved brushstrokes used to compose a landscape, and a small distant reclining figure. When the canvas is unframed, a number of measuring marks are visible on the outer margin of board, indicating that the composition was carefully conceived.|$|E

5|$|On 30 May 1898 the Tower Theatre was opened, sited between <b>the</b> <b>legs</b> <b>of</b> the tower. Capable of {{accommodating}} {{an audience}} of 2,500, {{it was the largest}} theatre in England outside London. Each season at the theatre was different; some years it would show a play or an opera, others it would focus on variety acts such as magicians, comedians and lion tamer Mademoiselle Marguerite, with her seven lions. Wrestling was hosted at the theatre as early as 1903, and had become a weekly event by 1937. When the Americans occupied the site during the Second World War they used the Tower Theatre to show their own roadshows to the troops.|$|E
5|$|The Severn Estuary {{has one of}} {{the highest}} tidal ranges in the world, up to , second only to the Bay of Fundy in Eastern Canada. The estuary's funnel shape, its tidal range, and the {{underlying}} geology of rock, gravel and sand, produce strong tidal streams and high turbidity, giving the water a notably brown colouration. The tidal range means that <b>the</b> <b>legs</b> <b>of</b> the pier are largely exposed at low tide and hidden at high tide and the landing stage at the end of the pier has several levels to allow boats to dock at all stages of the tide.|$|E
5|$|The {{first version}} of the Gorgon, Medusa, was to have five feet, but due to {{perceived}} animation difficulties, the final version had one tail. Other Gorgons in the game adhered to this design. The goddess Artemis was considered for inclusion in God of War: Ascension as a playable female character, offering alternative combat options. Game Director Todd Papy said {{she would have been}} depicted as half-human and half-feline, with the head and torso of a woman and <b>the</b> <b>legs</b> <b>of</b> a lioness. However, she was ultimately cut from the game and thus only appears in the original God of War as a translucent head.|$|E

5|$|The {{imperial}} ambassador {{reported that}} {{in the presence of}} guests, Henry would sit on Diane's lap and play the guitar, chat about politics, or fondle her breasts. Diane never regarded Catherine as a threat. She even encouraged the king {{to spend more time with}} Catherine and sire more children. In 1556, Catherine nearly died giving birth to twin daughters, Joan and Victoria. Surgeons saved her life by breaking <b>the</b> <b>legs</b> <b>of</b> Joan, who died in her womb. The surviving daughter, Victoria, died seven weeks later. Catherine had no more children.|$|E
5|$|The {{legs are}} {{composed}} of seven segments, and attach {{on the underside of}} the body. <b>The</b> <b>legs</b> <b>of</b> an individual are generally rather similar to each other, although often longer in males than females, and males of some species may have a reduced or enlarged first pair of legs. The most conspicuous leg modifications are involved in reproduction, discussed below. Despite the common name, no millipede has been discovered with 1,000 legs: common species have between 34 and 400 legs, and the record is held by Illacme plenipes, with individuals possessing up to 750 legs – more than any other creature on Earth.|$|E
5|$|The {{legs are}} reddish brown, or {{sometimes}} yellowish, with the femora of the anterior (first) pair being darker and enlarged, {{especially in the}} male. The anterior legs have three pairs of long spines on the ventral surface of the tibia and two pairs of spines on the metatarsus. The Peckhams give the following measurements for the lengths of <b>the</b> <b>legs</b> <b>of</b> a male specimen, starting with the anterior pair: 3.7mm, 2.2mm, 2mm, 3mm. In females, the fourth pair of legs are the longest. The pedipalp in the male has a single tibial apophysis which tapers gradually.|$|E
