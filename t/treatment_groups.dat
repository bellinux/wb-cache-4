40|$|Background: This {{study was}} {{designed}} to compare the efficacy of the medical treatment versus the surgical treatment approach to decompression of trigger point nerves in patients with migraine headaches. Materials and Methods: Fifty volunteers were randomly assigned to the medical <b>treatment</b> <b>group</b> (n = 25) or the surgical <b>treatment</b> <b>group</b> (n = 25) after examination by the team neurologist to ensure a diagnosis of migraine headache. All patients received botulinum toxin type A to confirm the trigger sites. The surgical <b>treatment</b> <b>group</b> underwent surgical deactivation of the trigger site(s). The medical <b>treatment</b> <b>group</b> underwent prophylactic pharmacologic interventions by the neurologist. Pretreatment and 12 -month posttreatment migraine headache frequency, duration, and intensity were analyzed and compared to determine the success of the treatments. Results: Nineteen of the 25 patients (76 %) in the surgical <b>treatment</b> <b>group</b> and 10 of the 25 patients (40 %) in the medical <b>treatment</b> <b>group</b> experienced a successful outcome (at least a 50 % decrease in migraine frequency, duration, or intensity) after 1 year from surgery.

The simplest one is to call [...] "significant" [...] any probe that differs {{by an average of}} at least twofold [...] between <b>treatment</b> <b>groups.</b> More sophisticated approaches are often related to t-tests or other mechanisms that take both effect size and variability into account. [...] Curiously, the p-values associated with particular genes do not reproduce well between replicate experiments, and lists generated by straight fold change perform much better. This represents an extremely important observation, since the point of performing experiments has to do with predicting general behavior. The MAQC group recommends using a fold change assessment plus a non-stringent p-value cutoff, further pointing out that changes in the background correction and scaling process have only a minimal impact on the rank order of fold change differences, but a substantial impact on p-values.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to analyze and compare the results obtained after 2 types of treatment, surgical and conservative, for acute patellar dislocations. Methods: We divided 33 patients with acute patellar dislocations into 2 groups. One group with 16 patients underwent conservative treatment (immobilization and subsequent physiotherapy), and the other group with 17 patients underwent surgical treatment. A radiographic examination was performed in the evaluation of the patients to verify predisposing factors for patellofemoral instability, and the Kujala questionnaire was applied with the intention of analyzing the improvement of pain and quality of life. The chi(2) test, t test, and Fisher test were used in the statistical evaluation. A significance level of P<. 05 was adopted. Results: The groups were considered parametric in relation to age and sex. The conservative <b>treatment</b> <b>group</b> exhibited a higher number of recurrent dislocations (8 patients) than the surgical <b>treatment</b> <b>group,</b> which did not have any relapses. In addition, the surgical <b>treatment</b> <b>group</b> obtained a better mean score on the Kujala test (92) than the conservative <b>treatment</b> <b>group</b> (69).
