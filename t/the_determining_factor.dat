In contests between musth and non-musth individuals, musth bulls win {{the majority of the}} time, even when the non-musth bull is larger. A male may stop showing signs of musth when he encounters a musth male of higher rank. Those of equal rank tend to avoid each other. Agonistic encounters typically consist of threat displays, chases, and minor sparring with the tusks. Serious fights are rare.|$|E
5|$|The governor's {{relationship}} with the General Assembly has typically been <b>the</b> <b>determining</b> <b>factor</b> in his success at enacting his agenda, although other factors also play an important role. In most of Indiana's history, the governor has come to power {{at a time in}} which his party controlled the assembly. Since the political parties first became dominant in 1831 and until 2010, thirty-three sessions of the legislature have been divided with different parties controlling the House and Senate. Only five sessions have occurred where the legislature was entirely controlled by the opposition party, while in ninety-eight sessions the governor's party controlled the entire assembly.|$|E

It appears, though, that the impact of Datafin remains qualified in the light of other decisions where the source of the power was held to be <b>the</b> <b>determining</b> <b>factor.</b> It is also worth noting that the effect of the nature test is greatly restricted in practice due to the insistence on the difference between contractual and governmental powers. Where there is a contractual relationship between an aggrieved person and the body making a decision affecting the person, this tends to place the dispute on the private law side of the public–private divide, making the decision not amenable to judicial review.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} aims {{to examine}} which determinants (i. e. perceived quality, trust, satisfaction, perceived value, and membership programs) have significant effect(s) on customer loyalty for luxury hotel. In {{order to get the}} answer, this study surveyed 308 online users to investigate <b>the</b> <b>determining</b> <b>factors</b> that affect customer loyalty for luxury hotel in US. The multiple regression statistical method, ANOVA, frequency tests and factor analysis were used for data analysis. The study results show that among <b>the</b> <b>determining</b> <b>factors</b> and their relationship against attitudinal and behavioral loyalty, “satisfaction ” was consistently valued the most, followed by “trust. ” The attitudinal loyalty measurement regarded “membership program ” as its third most valued while the behavioral loyalty positioned “perceived quality ” as its third. Results for the fourth most valued factor, indicated “perceived quality ” from the attitudinal loyalty measurement, while “perceived value ” was behavioral loyalty’s fourth most valued. The least valued factors for attitudinal and behavioral loyalty were “perceived value ” and “membership program, ” respectively. On a greater scale, in measuring overall loyalty, <b>the</b> <b>determining</b> <b>factors</b> were ranked as follows, in descending order from most to least important: “satisfaction, ” “trust, ” perceived quality, ” “membership program, ” and “perceived value. ” This study can serve as a model to be adopted for years to come in <b>the</b> <b>determining</b> <b>factors</b> of loyalty in luxury hotels in US.

Old Rapa adheres closer to the latter of Wilson’s two theories, the Initial Control Theory. This theory speculates that “the possessor’s control over the initiation of the possessive relationship is the determining factor.” Here, his Initial Control Theory can also be generally expanded to the whole Polynesian language family in terms of better describing the “alienability” of possession.|$|E
25|$|Individuals may {{migrate from}} their birth or founded colony {{to take up}} {{residence}} in another. This is most common during the pre-emergence phase and when there are around forty to fifty adults on the home nest. Migrant wasps {{are more likely to be}} accepted while they are younger, which is generally less than six days old. Age has been shown to be <b>the</b> <b>determining</b> <b>factor</b> for whether the resident wasps react with hostility or tolerance. Age might be an indicator of ovarian development (reproductive threat) or of other important qualities such as plasticity for role specialization. Multiple-foundress colonies are preferentially selected by migrant wasps, despite the fact that individuals are more successful at becoming a queen in a single-foundress colony. Young migrants become fully integrated into the new colony, becoming foragers and sometimes taking over the role of queen.|$|E

The other Forms of Numbers are derived in the same way out of the two fundamental principles. The structure of space is implicit in the Forms of Numbers: the dimensions of space somehow emerge from their relations. Key details of this extra-temporal emergence of space are missing from the surviving ancient testimonies, and its nature is debated in the scholarly literature.|$|E
25|$|Since the cricket bat is {{wide and}} flat, while the {{baseball}} bat is narrow and round, {{on the whole}} cricket batsmen {{find it easier to}} hit and direct the ball than baseball batters, resulting in many more runs being scored in a cricket match. While bowlers can influence the ability of the batsmen to do so, perhaps the most famous episode being the Bodyline tactic, cricket batsmen can use a wider variety of batting strokes to direct the ball in many directions into a field which provides much more open space than in baseball. Keeping in mind, cricket batsmen are under no obligation to attempt to score a run after any stroke, but must strike balls to prevent them from hitting the wicket.

Alianza Lima agreed to the play-off match and was subsequently won by Universitario with a score of 2–1. But according to other sources, this title Universitario won was not the league title itself, but a secondary title; thus creating controversy. Because of that, Alianza Lima considered itself as the champion of this year. However, the Peruvian Football Federation and the Sports Association of Professional Football, both recognize the title of this year belong to Universitario. Furthermore, in 2012 the FIFA published an article in which Universitario appears holding the 1934 championship.|$|E

500|$|Fodor {{has made}} many and varied criticisms of holism. He {{identifies}} the central problem {{with all the}} different notions of holism as the idea that <b>the</b> <b>determining</b> <b>factor</b> in semantic evaluation {{is the notion of}} an [...] "epistemic bond". Briefly, P is an epistemic bond of Q if the meaning of P is considered by someone to be relevant for the determination of the meaning of Q. Meaning holism strongly depends on this notion. The identity of the content of a mental state, under holism, can only be determined by the totality of its epistemic bonds. And this makes the realism of mental states an impossibility:If people differ in an absolutely general way in their estimations of epistemic relevance, and if we follow the holism of meaning and individuate intentional states by way of the totality of their epistemic bonds, the consequence will be that two people (or, for that matter, two temporal sections of the same person) will never be in the same intentional state. Therefore, two people can never be subsumed under the same intentional generalizations. And, therefore, intentional generalization can never be successful. And, therefore again, there is no hope for an intentional psychology.|$|E
