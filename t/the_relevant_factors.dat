Five subjects participated in the experiment: 3 young emmetropic subjects, an older presbyopic subject (with optic corrections) and an albino subject (M). The data show that the RT varies according to the product of contrast (C) by the period (P) of the gratings. The CxP is <b>the</b> <b>relevant</b> <b>factor</b> for <b>the</b> R * T variation.

2500|$|The {{child and}} {{adolescent}} psychiatrist makes a diagnosis based on the pattern of behavior and emotional symptoms, using a standardized set of diagnostic criteria such as the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-IV-TR) or the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10). While the DSM system is widely used, it may not adequately take into account social, cultural and contextual factors {{and it has been}} suggested that an individualized clinical formulation may be more useful. A case formulation is standard practice for {{child and adolescent}} psychiatrists and can be defined as a process of integrating and summarizing all <b>the</b> <b>relevant</b> <b>factors</b> implicated in the development of the patient's problem, including biological, psychological, social and cultural perspectives (the [...] "biopsychosocial model"). The applicability of DSM diagnoses have also been questioned with regard to the assessment of very young children: it is argued that very young children are developing too rapidly to be adequately described by a fixed diagnosis, and furthermore that a diagnosis unhelpfully locates the problem within the child when the parent-child relationship is a more appropriate focus of assessment.|$|E

40|$|The {{object of}} this essay is {{to explain why the}} distinctions made in {{euthanasia}} between killing vs. letting die and willingness to kill vs. unwillingness to kill are not relevant to real life euthanasia cases. The specific purpose of the research is to isolate <b>the</b> <b>relevant</b> <b>factor</b> for debate when discussing the morality of euthanasia. It begins with a brief examination of some vocabulary that is commonly used when discussing euthanasia. Following this is a quick overview of what the word euthanasia meant in the ancient Greco-Roman world compared to what it means in the modern vernacular. I use an article by James Rachels about the lack of distinction between killing and letting die (which is one possible <b>relevant</b> <b>factor)</b> and a reply by William Nesbitt which attempts to shift the focus onto willingness to kill (another possible <b>relevant</b> <b>factor).</b> I conclude that Rachels is correct that killing and letting die are morally equivalent when all other factors are the same, but that other factors are never the same and that Nesbitt is closer to <b>the</b> real morally <b>relevant</b> <b>factor</b> in his discussion of willingness to kill. However, Nesbitt is not entirely correct or clear about his ideas. Willingness to kill can, in a case of euthanasia, be equivalent to a willingness to help and is not always a negative thing. The more generalized intention of the person performing the euthanasia is <b>the</b> most <b>relevant</b> <b>factor</b> to <b>the</b> morality of the act...|$|R
40|$|Managing {{software}} development productivity and effort are key issues in software organizations. Identifying <b>the</b> most <b>relevant</b> <b>factors</b> influencing project performance {{is essential for}} implementing business strategies by selecting and adjusting proper improvement activities. There is, however, {{a large number of}} potential influencing factors. This paper proposes a novel approach for identifying <b>the</b> most <b>relevant</b> <b>factors</b> influencing {{software development}} productivity. <b>The</b> method elicits <b>relevant</b> <b>factors</b> by integrating data analysis and expert judgment approaches by means of a multi-criteria decision support technique. Empirical evaluation of the method in an industrial context has indicated that it delivers a different set of factors compared to individual data- and expert-based factor selection methods. Moreover, application of the integrated method significantly improves the performance of effort estimation in terms of accuracy and precision. Finally, the study did not replicate the observation of similar investigations regarding improved estimation performance on the factor sets reduced by a data-based selection method. ...|$|R
