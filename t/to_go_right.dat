25|$|Carboplatin is less potent than cisplatin; {{depending}} on the strain of cancer, carboplatin may only be 1/8 to 1/45 as effective. The clinical standard of dosage of carboplatin is usually a 4:1 ratio compared to cisplatin; that is, for a dose that usually requires a particular dose of cisplatin, {{four times as much}} carboplatin is needed to achieve the same effectiveness. The stable property of carboplatin is a mixed blessing: once uptake of the drug occurs, its retention half-life is considerably longer than cisplatin, but it is also this inertness that causes carboplatin <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>right</b> through the human body, and up to 90% of the carboplatin given can be recovered in urine.|$|E
500|$|Similarly, Hunter Felt from PopMatters {{enjoyed the}} song, but felt {{disappointed}} by Parlophone {{and the public}} for not releasing the single in the United States, commenting [...] "'On a Night Like This', a track that is meant <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>right</b> to {{number one on the}} Billboard Club Tracks list and while being completely ignored by the general public." [...] In a review of Minogue's greatest hits album, The Best of Kylie Minogue (2012) by PopMatters' Matt James, he described [...] "On a Night Like This" [...] as a [...] "bedroom-eyed nightclubber", further adding it was [...] "still hot enough to melt large glaciers." [...] An editor from NME, Stevie Chick, believed that Minogue lacked genuine [...] "passion" [...] throughout the song and labelled it [...] "unremarkable".

500|$|Braga {{explained}} that the most difficult casting was that for T'Pol, as they were seeking a Kim Cattrall type. Blalock and Marjorie Monaghan were among the final three {{to be considered for}} the part, with Blalock gaining the role, despite her agents rejecting requests for her to attend auditions early in the casting process. By the time that Blalock auditioned in the final group, the crew had seen hundreds of actresses according to Berman. His main issue at the time was to find a [...] "beautiful woman who can act and doesn't want <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>right</b> into feature films". Blalock was excited about the casting as she had been a lifelong Star Trek fan, with her favourite character being Spock. Bakula's casting as Archer was announced via press release on May 10, 2001. However, some of the British media mistook the announcement for Bakula taking over from Patrick Stewart. Details {{of the rest of the}} main cast were released on May 15, with the rest of the character details publicised the following day.|$|E
500|$|Rehearsals {{began in}} January 1945; either Rodgers or Hammerstein was always present. Raitt was {{presented}} with the lyrics for [...] "Soliloquy" [...] on a five-foot long sheet of paper—the piece ran nearly eight minutes. [...] Staging such a long solo number presented problems, and Raitt later stated that he {{felt that they were}} never fully addressed. [...] At some point during rehearsals, Molnár came to see what they had done to his play. [...] There are a number of variations on the story. [...] As Rodgers told it, while watching rehearsals with Hammerstein, the composer spotted Molnár {{in the rear of the}} theatre and whispered the news to his partner. [...] Both sweated through an afternoon of rehearsal in which nothing seemed <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>right.</b> [...] At the end, the two walked to the back of the theatre, expecting an angry reaction from Molnár. [...] Instead, the playwright said enthusiastically, [...] "What you have done is so beautiful. [...] And you know what I like best? [...] The ending!" [...] Hammerstein wrote that Molnár became a regular attendee at rehearsals after that.|$|E
500|$|Kirkwood branded Mercedes [...] "a savvy, ballsy {{girl that}} can't say no and is unapologetic about it". Metcalfe has {{described}} Mercedes {{as someone who}} [...] "hates every woman in Hollyoaks" [...] except her own sisters, and as someone who talks too much and has a [...] "mouth like a foghorn". She {{went on to say}} that Mercedes [...] "always looks after her family and would never do anything to deliberately hurt them. Mercedes' heart is definitely in the right place". Metcalfe observed that Mercedes is [...] "completely mad" [...] and she [...] "just does whatever she feels like doing at the time. She doesn't exactly think things through". Metcalfe further explained that Mercedes did not [...] "consider consequences", which led her to unintentionally [...] "destroy everything". She elaborated on this, saying that Mercedes never has a happy ending [...] "because she can't. I don't think with Mercedes there is ever a happy ending. Just when something might go her way or something's going <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>right</b> for her, she destroys it". She said that her character is [...] "used to getting her own way" [...] so she thought that despite her actions, [...] "everything will turn out right in the end". She opined that Mercedes was at her best in this state, being [...] "minxy and destructive". Metcalfe described Mercedes in this way: [...] "Whatever she does that's bad, she manages to justify in her head. She doesn't have much self-worth and she knows what she's like". Metcalfe also expressed the hope that Mercedes could be happy [...] "free and single". She explained that Mercedes was unable to remain happy, saying: [...] "she has moments of happiness but ruins them herself". She went on to explain that due to Mercedes' first love having [...] "messed her up", Mercedes behaved [...] "the way she is where men are concerned". She further explained that Mercedes believed she could change but was disappointed when she could not. Metcalfe said, [...] "When she says that she's going to change, she actually means it; she just can't sustain it." ...|$|E

500|$|Presley and Linda Thompson {{split in}} November 1976, {{and he took}} {{up with a new}} girlfriend, Ginger Alden. He {{proposed}} to Alden and gave her an engagement ring two months later, though several of his friends later claimed that he had no serious intention of marrying again. Journalist Tony Scherman writes that by early 1977, [...] "Presley had become a grotesque caricature of his sleek, energetic former self. Hugely overweight, his mind dulled by the pharmacopia he daily ingested, he was barely able to pull himself through his abbreviated concerts." [...] In Alexandria, Louisiana, the singer was on stage for less than an hour and [...] "was impossible to understand". Presley failed to appear in Baton Rouge; he was unable to get out of his hotel bed, {{and the rest of the}} tour was cancelled. Despite the accelerating deterioration of his health, he stuck to most touring commitments. In Rapid City, South Dakota, [...] "he was so nervous on stage that he could hardly talk", according to Presley historian Samuel Roy, and unable to [...] "perform any significant movement." [...] Guralnick relates that fans [...] "were becoming increasingly voluble about their disappointment, but it all seemed <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>right</b> past Presley, whose world was now confined almost entirely to his room and his spiritualism books." [...] A cousin, Billy Smith, recalled how Presley would sit in his room and chat for hours, sometimes recounting favorite Monty Python sketches and his own past escapades, but more often gripped by paranoid obsessions that reminded Smith of Howard Hughes. [...] "Way Down", Presley's last single issued during his lifetime, came out on June 6. On the next tour, CBS filmed two concerts for a TV Special, Elvis in Concert, to be aired in October. On the first of these, captured in Omaha on June 19, Presley's voice, Guralnick writes, [...] "is almost unrecognizable, a small, childlike instrument in which he talks more than sings most of the songs, casts about uncertainly for the melody in others, and is virtually unable to articulate or project." [...] He did better on the second night, two days later in Rapid City: [...] "He looked healthier, seemed to have lost a little weight, and sounded better, too", though his appearance was still a [...] "face framed in a helmet of blue-black hair from which sweat sheets down over pale, swollen cheeks." [...] His final concert was held in Indianapolis, Indiana at Market Square Arena, on June 26.|$|E

2500|$|The Court {{appears to}} be saying that LGE simply {{licensed}} Intel to make, use, and sell microprocessor products.

But LGE did not say to Intel that LGE licensed Intel to make, use, and sell microprocessor products only in the field of microprocessor products combined with other LGE-licensed products (so-called Intel products). There was no explicit field-of-use limitation on Intel’s manufacturing, using, and selling rights––no “magic words.” [...] LGE came close––it said it was not licensing third parties to combine licensed product with other products, and it required Intel to notify customers of that––but LGE failed <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>right</b> to the point and expressly deny Intel any license to make microprocessor products that would be combined with other products.

2500|$|On a {{day when}} a victory would give the Patriots their third {{consecutive}} AFC East title, nothing seemed <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>right</b> for the Patriots as the Dolphins outplayed the Patriots to split the season series and give New England their first shutout since 2003, defeating the Patriots 21–0. [...] The first half was a defensive struggle with the only points coming from Olindo Mare, {{in the form of}} a 35-yard and a 33-yard field goal. [...] Even the punter, Donnie Jones, gave the Patriots issues as multiple punts resulted in the offensive unit starting within the five-yard line. [...] The furthest the Patriots drove into Dolphin territory was in the third quarter with the Dolphins leading 13–0. [...] Ending with a would-be touchdown reception by Watson, a play consisting of a lateral from Faulk to Brady was ruled penalty, as Faulk's lateral was an illegal forward pass. On the following possession, Matt Cassel took over the offense, but he too succumbed to the Dolphin defense and was sacked, fumbling the ball. [...] The Dolphins marched within the New England 10-yard line again but knelt to burn out the clock. [...] The loss gave the Patriots a 4–2 division record and 9–4 record overall.|$|E

2500|$|Another type of {{stripped}} down and raw {{music with a}} variety of moods and a basic ensemble of guitar, bass, dobro or steel guitar (and later) drums became popular, especially among poor whites in Texas and Oklahoma. It became known as honky tonk and had its roots in Western swing and the ranchera music of Mexico and the border states, particularly Texas, together with the blues of the American South. Bob Wills and His Texas Playboys personified this music which has been described as [...] "a little bit of this, {{and a little bit of}} that, a little bit of black and a little bit of white... just loud enough to keep you from thinking too much and <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>right</b> on ordering the whiskey."

These [...] "honky tonk" [...] songs associated barrooms, were performed by the likes of Ernest Tubb, Kitty Wells (the first major female country solo singer), Ted Daffan, Floyd Tillman, and the Maddox Brothers and Rose, Lefty Frizzell and Hank Williams, would later be called [...] "traditional" [...] country. Williams' influence in particular would prove to be enormous, inspiring many of the pioneers of rock and roll, such as Elvis Presley and Jerry Lee Lewis, as well as Chuck Berry and Ike Turner, while providing a framework for emerging honky tonk talents like George Jones.
