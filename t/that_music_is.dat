5|$|Ilaiyaraaja's {{first two}} non-film albums were explorations in {{the fusion of}} Indian and Western {{classical}} music. The first, How to Name It? (1986), {{is dedicated to the}} Carnatic master Tyāgarāja and to J. S. Bach. It features a fusion of the Carnatic form and ragas with Bach partitas, fugues and Baroque musical textures. The second, Nothing But Wind (1988), was performed by flautist Hariprasad Chaurasia and a 50-piece orchestra and takes the conceptual approach suggested in the title— <b>that</b> <b>music</b> <b>is</b> a natural phenomenon akin to various forms of air currents (e.g., the wind, breeze, tempest etc.).|$|E
25|$|In 2007, Lee {{initiated}} Mewsic, {{a charitable}} foundation in India. Mewsic aims {{to facilitate the}} involvement of disadvantaged young people in music. Mewsic aims to ensure <b>that</b> <b>music</b> <b>is</b> widely recognised as a powerful tool to heal, empower, educate, and advocate for marginalised children in India. Mewsic has established six centres of music across India.|$|E
25|$|While {{studies have}} {{reported}} inconsistent results with regards to music's effect on memory, it has been demonstrated <b>that</b> <b>music</b> <b>is</b> able to interfere with various memory tasks. It has been demonstrated that new situations require new combinations of cognitive processing. This subsequently results in conscious attention being drawn to novel aspects of situations. Therefore, the loudness of music presentation along with other musical elements can assist in distracting one from normal responses by encouraging attentiveness to the musical information. Attention and recall {{have been shown to}} be negatively affected by the presence of a distraction. Wolfe (1983) cautions that educators and therapists should be made aware of the potential for environments with sounds occurring simultaneously from many sources (musical and non-musical) to distract and interfere with student learning.|$|E

25|$|Acquired amusia is {{a musical}} {{disability}} that shares the same characteristics as congenital amusia, {{but rather than}} being inherited, it {{is the result of}} brain damage. It is also more common than congenital amusia. While it has been suggested <b>that</b> <b>music</b> <b>is</b> processed by music-specific neural networks in the brain, this view has been broadened to show that music processing also encompasses generic cognitive functions, such as memory, attention, and executive processes. A recent study was conducted to investigate the neural and cognitive mechanisms that underlie acquired amusia and contribute to its recovery. The study was performed on 53 stroke patients with a left or right hemisphere middle cerebral artery (MCA) infarction one week, three months, and six months after the stroke occurred. Amusic subjects were identified one week following their stroke, and {{over the course of the}} study, amusics and non-amusics were compared in both brain lesion location and their performances on neuropsychological tests.|$|E
500|$|Pinker is {{critical}} of theories about the evolutionary origins of language that argue that linguistic cognition might have evolved from earlier musical cognition. He sees language as being tied primarily to the capacity for logical reasoning, and speculates that human proclivity for music may be a spandrel — a feature not adaptive in its own right, but that has persisted through other traits that are more broadly practical, and thus selected for. In How the Mind Works, Pinker reiterates Immanuel Kant's view [...] <b>that</b> <b>music</b> <b>is</b> not in itself an important cognitive phenomenon, but that it happens to stimulate important auditory and spatio-motor cognitive functions. Pinker compares music to [...] "auditory cheesecake", stating that [...] "As far as biological cause and effect is concerned, music is useless". This argument has been rejected by Daniel Levitin and Joseph Carroll, experts in music cognition, who argue that music has had {{an important role in}} the evolution of human cognition. In his book This Is Your Brain On Music, Levitin argues that music could provide adaptive advantage through sexual selection, social bonding, and cognitive development; he questions the assumption <b>that</b> <b>music</b> <b>is</b> the antecedent to language, as opposed to its progenitor, noting that many species display music-like habits that could be seen as precursors to human music.|$|E
500|$|Enter Shikari took a {{different}} lyrical direction {{with the release of}} their 2009 album Common Dreads, which focused on financial meltdown, economic collapse and widespread discontent. Journalists such as Ian Winwood credited the band's lyrical direction as a reaction to the evolution of politics since their 2007 debut album, Take to the Skies; there is now [...] "ongoing Orwellian overseas conflicts, riots in England's major cities, endless austerity programmes the end date of which stretch years into the distance". The change in lyrics began with Reynolds' belief <b>that</b> <b>music</b> <b>is</b> an effective way of conveying political ideas.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} such {{references}} <b>that</b> indicate <b>that</b> <b>music</b> <b>was</b> {{an integral part}} of the Greek perception of how their race had even come into existence and how their destinies continued to be watched over and controlled by the Gods.

500|$|As a {{composer}} Bennett was acknowledged {{in his time}} in both Britain and (particularly {{in the first half}} of the century) in Germany, although many British music lovers and several leading critics remained reluctant to acknowledge the possibility that an English composer could be of the same stature as a German one. The Leipzig public, which had initially held that view, had been rapidly converted. Mendelssohn wrote to Bennett [...] "...y Countrymen became aware <b>that</b> <b>music</b> <b>is</b> the same in England as in Germany and everywhere, and so by your successes you have destroyed that prejudice which nobody could ever have destroyed but a true Genius." ...|$|E
500|$|U2's {{decision}} to allow free downloads of Songs of Innocence was questioned by musicians, including the Black Keys' Patrick Carney and Pink Floyd's Nick Mason. Buckcherry guitarist Keith Nelson believed it devalued music, saying U2 had [...] "sent a message to everyone <b>that</b> <b>music</b> <b>is</b> free, and that's disturbing. It's easy {{to do that when}} you're a multi-millionaire-billionaire and money isn't really something that you worry about, but when you're a working rock 'n' roll band and you count on every dollar, it's disappointing to see someone do that." [...] The Entertainment Retailers Association reported that UK sales of the band's back catalogue were minimal in the week following the album's release. The organisation's chairman Paul Quirk said: [...] "This vindicates our view that giving away hundreds of millions of albums simply devalues music and runs the risk of alienating the 60% of the population who are not customers of iTunes ... Giving away music like this is as damaging to the value of music as piracy." ...|$|E
500|$|Massengale argues that, given <b>that</b> <b>music</b> <b>is</b> so {{important}} in the Epistles, and that Bellman had more than enough musical skill to write a tune, {{it is remarkable that}} all or almost all the tunes are borrowed. He suggests that this [...] "seems to indicate that Bellman wanted to preserve some vestige of the borrowing." [...] That the borrowing was not just about saving effort or making up for absent skill, Massengale argues, is demonstrated {{by the fact that the}} amount of work Bellman had to put into the melodies for Epistles 12 ("Gråt Fader Berg och spela") and 24 ("Kära Syster!") was [...] "surely tantamount to the production of new melodies." [...] Borrowing was accepted, even encouraged at the time, but that does not explain why Bellman would have done it so consistently. The [...] "poetic possibility", Massengale suggests, is that Bellman wished to exploit the humorous contrast between a melody of one type and a story of another, or between an existing image associated with the melody, and a fresh one presented in an Epistle. In addition, Bellman was able to use what his audience knew to be borrowed music to reinforce the historical flavour of the Epistles, introducing exactly the kind of ambiguity that he was seeking.|$|E
500|$|Guido Fackler has {{researched}} {{evidence that}} indicates that it <b>is</b> possible <b>that</b> Wagner's <b>music</b> <b>was</b> used at the Dachau concentration camp in 1933–34 to [...] "reeducate" [...] political prisoners by exposure to [...] "national music". There has been {{no evidence to support}} claims, sometimes made, <b>that</b> his <b>music</b> <b>was</b> played at Nazi death camps during the Second World War, and Pamela Potter has noted <b>that</b> Wagner's <b>music</b> <b>was</b> explicitly off-limits in the camps.|$|R
50|$|In the 19th century, {{the era of}} romanticism in music, some {{composers and}} critics argued <b>that</b> <b>music</b> should and could express ideas, images, emotions, or even a whole {{literary}} plot. Challenging Kant's reservations about instrumental music, in 1813 E. T. A. Hoffman argued <b>that</b> <b>music</b> <b>was</b> fundamentally the art of instrumental composition. Five years later, Arthur Schopenhauer's The World as Will and Representation argued <b>that</b> instrumental <b>music</b> <b>is</b> the greatest art, because it is uniquely capable of representing the metaphysical organization of reality.|$|R
50|$|Timothy Moloi {{released}} his debut solo album Love <b>That</b> <b>Music</b> in July 2009, which was recorded at Undahaus Studios in Johannesburg and mastered at Abbey Road Studios in London. In 2010, Love <b>That</b> <b>Music</b> <b>was</b> nominated for two South African Music Awards.|$|R
500|$|The {{advantage}} of tactile transducers used for low frequencies {{is that they}} allow a listening environment that is not filled with loud low frequency waves. This helps the drummer in a rock music band to monitor his or her kick drum performance without filling the stage with powerful, loud low frequency sound from a 15" [...] (40cm) subwoofer monitor and an amplifier, which can [...] "leak" [...] into other drum mics and lower {{the quality of the}} sound mix. By not having a large, powerful subwoofer monitor, a bass shaker also enables a drummer to lower the sound pressure levels that they are exposed to during a performance, reducing the risk of hearing damage. For home cinema or video game use, bass shakers help the user avoid disturbing others in nearby apartments or rooms, because even powerful sound effects such as explosion sounds in a war video game or the simulated rumbling of an earthquake in an adventure film will not be heard by others. However, some critics argue that the felt vibrations are disconnected from the auditory experience, and they claim that <b>that</b> <b>music</b> <b>is</b> less satisfying with the [...] "butt shaker" [...] than sound effects. As well, critics have claimed that the bass shaker itself can rattle during loud sound effects, which can distract the listener.|$|E
500|$|When Gretta sees Dave {{accepting}} {{an award}} on television, she criticizes him for selling {{out to the}} music industry and she expresses her grievances {{with him in a}} song which she records on his voice mail. A remorseful Dave, who is back in New York to promote his new album, returns her call and asks to see her. After some consideration, she decides to meet with him and they critique each other's albums. Gretta feels betrayed by Dave's heavily commercialized rendition of [...] "Lost Stars," [...] a love ballad she had once written and composed for him as a Christmas present, believing that the true meaning of the song has been lost. Dave tells her that the audiences love when he plays it in the new way, and that their energy fills the room. [...] He believes <b>that</b> <b>music</b> <b>is</b> about sharing it with people, but Gretta tells him that's not what she intended for that song. Nevertheless, Dave invites her to come and hear him play the song at the Gramercy Theatre that weekend so that she can see the impact it has had on his fans. She arrives at the venue just in time to watch him play her original arrangement of the song. After tearfully watching him play and seeing the reaction of the crowd to their song, Gretta decides to leave the concert and cycles through the city with a smile slowly dawning on her face.|$|E

2500|$|The {{traditional}} music of Ireland and Scotland constitutes {{the majority of}} published scores for the whistle. Since the majority of <b>that</b> <b>music</b> <b>is</b> written in D major, G major, {{or one of the}} corresponding musical modes, use of the D major or G major key signatures is a de facto standard.

2500|$|Spin {{said that}} the album [...] "is a much-needed breath of fresh VapoRub." [...] Danny Eccleston, in a review for Q, called it a [...] "brave, radical and punchy (at a {{refreshing}} 49 minutes in length) album". A retrospective review in Blender remarked: [...] "Her first 'headphones album'... It's more playful and less pompous than Ray of Light." [...] Rolling Stone stated that the album was a rough and improvised version of Ray of Light, but lauded that Madonna had chosen to make a more [...] "instinctive" [...] record than her previous endeavours. Mojo magazine said that [...] "Music is fitful and its charms aren't all immediate, but Madonna is still doing what she does best--giving a lick of pop genius to the unlikely genre of experimental dance music." [...] NME said <b>that</b> <b>Music</b> <b>is</b> [...] "vocodered, stretched, distorted, warped, deliberately upstaged by beats so showy they belong in a strip joint – quite simply, she's almost managed to make herself disappear. That bluntly explicit title isn't just pointless irony. This record is about the music, not Madonna; about the sounds, not the image." [...] Slant Magazine criticised Madonna's collaborations with William Orbit, {{who had worked with}} her on Ray of Light, calling them repetitive and uninteresting despite being catchy. In 2015, Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone said <b>that</b> <b>Music</b> <b>is</b> [...] "still [...] hardest-rocking and most seductive album." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Apollonian and Dionysian is a {{two-fold}} philosophical concept, {{based on}} certain features of ancient Greek mythology: Apollo and Dionysus. Even though {{the concept is}} famously related to The Birth of Tragedy, the poet Hölderlin had already spoken of it, and Winckelmann had talked of Bacchus. One year before the publication of The Birth of Tragedy, Nietzsche wrote a fragment titled [...] "On Music and Words". In it he asserted the Schopenhauerian judgment <b>that</b> <b>music</b> <b>is</b> a primary expression of the essence of everything. Secondarily derivative are lyrical poetry and drama, which represent mere phenomenal appearances of objects. In this way, tragedy is born from music.|$|E
2500|$|Chinese {{philosophers}} took varying {{approaches to}} music. [...] To Confucius, a correct form {{of music is}} important for the cultivation and refinement of the individual, and the Confucian system considers the formal music yayue to be morally uplifting and the symbol of a good ruler and stable government. Some popular forms of music, however, were considered corrupting in the Confucian view. [...] Mozi on the other hand condemned music, and argued in [...] Against Music (非樂) <b>that</b> <b>music</b> <b>is</b> an extravagance and indulgence that serves no useful purpose and may be harmful. [...] According to Mencius, a powerful ruler once asked him whether it was moral if he preferred popular music to the classics. The answer was that it only mattered that the ruler loved his subjects.|$|E

I believe <b>that</b> <b>music</b> <b>is</b> based on moments, and that there are some moments that people may have missed back in the day. They may have even missed it a year ago.
