40|$|This study {{examines}} {{a feature of}} the budget process called the tax expenditure budget. The tax expenditure concept relies heavily on a normative notion that shielding certain taxpayer income from <b>taxation</b> deprives government <b>of</b> its rightful revenues. This view is inconsistent with the proposition that income belongs to the taxpayers and that tax liability is determined through the democratic process, not through arbitrary, bureaucratic assumptions. Furthermore, the methodology of the tax expenditure budget is problematic as its expansive tax base treats the multiple <b>taxation</b> <b>of</b> <b>saving</b> as the norm. By using an expansive view of income as the underlying assumption of the tax expenditure concept, this viewpoint institutionalizes a particular bias into the decision-making process...|$|R
40|$|I {{consider}} optimal nonlinear <b>taxation</b> <b>of</b> {{income and}} bequests with a joy-of-giving bequest motive and explicitly characterize the optimal estate tax rate. The optimal formula trades off correction of externality from giving and discouraging effort of children due to income effect generated by bequests. The analysis shows that optimality {{of a positive}} tax on bequests rests {{on the strength of}} the effect of bequests on behavior of future generations, and suggests that inheritance rather than estate tax is better suited to implement the optimal policy. Estate taxation is a policy topic of continued interest. Despite rumors of its demise in the United States where it was put on life support as the result of partial repeal in 2010, its future now seems more alive. However, the economic literature on <b>taxation</b> <b>of</b> estates is surprisingly inconclusive (see Kopczuk, 2013, for a recent survey). When generations are linked by altruism and the objective function respects dynastic preferences, <b>taxation</b> <b>of</b> estates is analogous to <b>taxation</b> <b>of</b> <b>saving</b> with identical baseline result <b>of</b> no <b>taxation.</b> In a recent paper, Farhi and Werning (2010) allow for the social planner to value welfare of children generation separately from the dynastic welfare and show that the corresponding externality due to insufficient giving should be addressed by policy that subsidizes bequest...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{motivated}} by the recent innovations regarding the <b>taxation</b> <b>of</b> crossborder <b>savings</b> {{that took place in}} the European Union and the United States. We develop a model to assess the functioning of the different systems <b>of</b> international <b>taxation</b> used on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean. We consider agents as investors able to diversify their portfolio between countries and kinds of financial assets. Furthermore, we show the effects of the various settings investigated not only on the <b>taxation</b> <b>of</b> foreign <b>savings</b> income, but also on the tax rates applied to domestic savings. Finally, comparing the respective merits of diverse regimes of information exchange and coordinated withholding taxation, we explore the consequences of the loopholes in both the EU Savings Directive and the US Qualified Intermediary mechanism, and cope with the cost of information sharing. We find that only three tax designs ensure efficiency: a framework <b>of</b> <b>taxation</b> based on the principle of residence, perfect information exchange for all substitutable assets and strategies, and a system <b>of</b> withholding <b>taxation</b> where the residence country can choose the withholding tax rate and also receives all the withholding tax revenues collected abroad...|$|R

40|$|Irving Fisher wrote a {{significant}} number of papers towards {{the end of his career}} on the design of the U. S. tax system. These writings culminated in a book that lie wrote with his brother Herbert in 1942. Fisher thought that the double <b>taxation</b> <b>of</b> <b>saving</b> under an income tax was extremely harmful to the economy and he therefore proposed a "spendings" tax or what he referred to as a "real income" tax. Even though he disliked the terminology, he advocated what today would be referred to as a progressive consumption tax. Fisher's analysis was both theoretical and practical. His 1942 book contained a proposed tax return that implemented his ideas. His analysis is surprisingly modern and relevant today. This paper presents the Fisher proposal and examines the Current U. S. tax system in light of his tax views. We argue that Fisher would find that the U. S. tax system lacks intellectual coherence, is economically inefficient, and unnecessarily complex...|$|R

40|$|It is {{possible}} to employ either income or expenditure as the base for personal taxation. A considerable literature has developed that investigates the relative efficiency of these bases. The answer is usually {{in favor of the}} expenditure tax since it encourages capital accumulation through the avoidance <b>of</b> the double <b>taxation</b> <b>of</b> <b>saving.</b> In contrast, the literature is almost silent on the relative equity of the two bases. We investigate the redistributive consequences of the choice in models with two sources of heterogeneity: skill in employment and lump-sum endowment. The Gini coefficient is used to measure the degreee of equity achieved by the tax bases in static and dynamic settings. Income taxes and expenditure taxes that generate equal welfare (or equal revenue) are compared. In the static economy the income tax leads to lower inequality except when skill and endowment are negatively correlated. Inequality is always lower with the income tax in the dynamic economy. These results support the choice of income as the base for personal taxation if reduction in inequality is a priority of policy.

40|$|Pension policy reforms {{across the}} world in recent decades are a {{reaction}} to the changing demographic and socioeconomic environment. While pension scheme redesign has received much attention, the tax treatment of contributions, returns, and benefits <b>of</b> retirement <b>savings</b> remains mostly unattended and the <b>taxation</b> <b>of</b> internationally portable pensions is terra incognita for economists. This paper focuses on the huge differences in old-age pension taxation within and across OECD countries and highlights fiscal equity and efficiency issues that emerge in a world of internationally mobile workers and pensioners. It highlights that pension taxation differs widely not only across countries but also across pension pillars within a country, creating savings and mobility distortions and fiscal equity problems at individual and country level. The paper offers explanations for this heterogeneity and proposes a switch from deferred taxation towards front-loaded <b>taxation</b> <b>of</b> retirement <b>savings</b> to meet the demographic challenges of a globalized world.

40|$|The {{difficulty}} {{of making a}} transition from an income-type to a consumption-type tax is often cited {{as an obstacle to}} such a change in policy. Put simply, the problem is the double <b>taxation</b> <b>of</b> "old <b>savings</b> " or "old capital. " A person who has accumulated wealth under an income tax will be hit with an extra tax on the consumption financed by that accumula-tion under a shift to a consumption tax. Such a transition effect raises issues of equity, political feasibility, and efficiency. In the typical imple-mentation of a consumption tax, the same sorts of transition phenomena associated with a shift from an income tax follow from any change in the rate of tax. That is, introduction of a consumption tax is the same as raising the rate of consumption tax from zero to whatever positive rate is envi-sioned for the new system. Consequently, the problem of transition to a consumption tax generalizes to the problem of changing the rate of con-sumption tax.

40|$|Optimal {{nonlinear}} <b>taxation</b> <b>of</b> {{income and}} <b>savings</b> is considered in a two-period model with two {{individuals who have}} additively separable preferences and who only differ in their skill levels. When the government can commit to its second period policy, taxes on savings do not form part of the optimal tax mix. When commitment is not possible, the optimal tax scheme distorts private savings behavior. If the types are separated in period one, it is optimal to subsidize the <b>savings</b> <b>of</b> both types of individual at the margin. If the types are pooled in period one, it is optimal for the low-skilled (high-skilled) individual to face a marginal savings tax (subsidy).

40|$|The {{tax reform}} literature, pioneered by Guesnerie [1977], uses static models but implicitly views tax reform as a dynamic process, i. e., as a {{policy-maker}} implementing incremental reforms over time. This paper studies tax reform in a dynamic {{version of the}} Diamond-Mirrlees-Guesnerie model and focuses on a specific aspect of the dynamic process, namely, the implications for tax reform of agents leaving bequests. The main idea is that a tax reform in one period will affect bequests and therefore endowments, equilibrium, and welfare in subsequent periods. Thus, the process of tax reform cannot be analyzed as a sequence of static economies; instead, the economies are linked by bequests. The paper undertakes a tax reform analysis a la Guesnerie, but with an added focus on individual welfare improving reforms for each generation. Second-best Pareto optima are then characterized, and these conditions are compared to the static optimal tax formulae derived in the literature. In particular, the key Diamond-Mirrlees result that production efficiency is desirable at second-best optima no longer holds {{in the presence of}} (effective) restrictions on the <b>taxation</b> <b>of</b> private <b>savings.</b> Restrictions on government savings (including balanced budget restrictions), however, do not disturb the desirability of production efficiency. Finally, the main results of the paper are shown to be robust to certain political constraints on the tax reform process...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyse {{what should be}} the effects of the {{introduction}} of a flat rate tax in Belgium. According to the principles of a flat rate tax system, allowances, credits and exemptions that are considered as tax expenditures are repealed and the progressive tax schedule is replaced by a single marginal tax rate that applies above a zero-rate bracket. There is no deduction for savings and tax credits for children stay in place. The reform is budgetary neutral. We first run a micro-simulation model for personal income taxation. This means that the final withholding tax on income from savings and the corporate income tax rate remain unchanged. The results indicate strong adverse effects on income distribution. In a second stage, we use out-of-model statistical information to simulate the effects of a full flat rate system in which the top marginal PIT rate, the final withholding tax on interests and the CIT rate are equalised. Base broadening also applies to the <b>taxation</b> <b>of</b> <b>savings</b> and to corporate income tax. The strong adverse effect on income distribution remains but in addition to this, the tax burden is shifted from income subject to PIT to income from savings. On the efficiency side, high-income earners enjoy the largest cuts while the drop in average income tax rates for low-income earners may result in a positive participation effect. <b>Taxation</b> <b>of</b> <b>savings</b> is more neutral under the contemplated tax reform.
