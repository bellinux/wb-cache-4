50|$|<b>The</b> <b>PNC</b> {{was formed}} in 1957 by the faction of the People's Progressive Party (PPP) led by Forbes Burnham that had lost the general {{elections}} earlier in the year.

40|$|<b>The</b> perinucleolar {{compartment}} (<b>PNC)</b> is {{a nuclear}} substructure present in transformed cells. <b>The</b> <b>PNC</b> {{is defined by}} high concentrations of certain RNA binding proteins and a subset of small RNAs transcribed by RNA polymerase III (pol III), including the signal recognition particle RNA and an Alu RNA as reported here. To determine if <b>the</b> <b>PNC</b> is dependent on pol III transcription, HeLa cells were microinjected with the selective pol III inhibitor, Tagetin.

30|$|With the {{introduction}} of MPMH-MRMC, the control overhead will be increased since more scheduling information needs to be broadcasted to the nodes in the WPAN. Based on the directional MAC structure in Section 3.1, network synchronization and control messages for the (m− 1)-th transmission requests are broadcasted in the m-th BP from <b>the</b> <b>PNC.</b> During <b>the</b> m-th CAP period, <b>the</b> <b>PNC</b> receives several transmission requests [3].

Considering that one frame consists of 1000 time slots [1, 3] and the Gbps transmission rates of the mmWave communications, the increase of the control overhead can be neglected.|$|R
40|$|<b>The</b> perinucleolar {{compartment}} (<b>PNC)</b> is {{a unique}} nuclear structure preferentially localized at {{the periphery of the}} nucleolus. Several small RNAs transcribed by RNA polymerase III (e. g., the Y RNAs, MRP RNA, and RNase P H 1 RNA) and the polypyrimidine tract binding protein (PTB; hnRNP I) have thus far been identified in <b>the</b> <b>PNC</b> (Ghetti, A., S. PinolRoma, W. M. Michael, C. Morandi, and G. Dreyfuss. 1992. Nucleic Acids Res. 20 : 3671 – 3678; Matera, A. G., M. R. Frey, K. Margelot, and S. L. Wolin. 1995. J.

In this report, we have further characterized this structure in both fixed and living cells. Detection of <b>the</b> <b>PNC</b> in a large number of human cancer and normal cells showed that PNCs are much more prevalent in cancer cells. Analysis through the cell cycle using immunolabeling with a monoclonal antibody, SH 54, specifically recognizing PTB, demonstrated that <b>the</b> <b>PNC</b> dissociates at <b>the</b> beginning of mitosis and reforms at late telophase in the daughter nuclei. To visualize <b>the</b> <b>PNC</b> in living cells, a fusion protein between PTB and green fluorescent protein (GFP) was generated.

In addition, electron microscopic examination in optimally fixed cells revealed that <b>the</b> <b>PNC</b> is composed of multiple strands, each measuring ∼ 80 – 180 nm diam. Some of the strands are in direct contact with the surface of the nucleolus. Furthermore, analysis of the sequence requirement for targeting PTB to <b>the</b> <b>PNC</b> using a series of deletion mutants of the GFP–PTB fusion protein showed that at least three RRMs at either the COOH or NH 2 terminus are required for the fusion protein to be targeted to <b>the</b> <b>PNC.</b> This finding suggests that RNA binding may be necessary for PTB to be localized in <b>the</b> <b>PNC...</b>|$|R

40|$|By {{looking at}} <b>the</b> parity-nonconserving (<b>PNC)</b> asymmetries at {{different}} energies in p⃗ p scattering, {{it is in}} principle possible to determine <b>the</b> <b>PNC</b> ρ NN and ω NN couplings of a single-meson-exchange model of <b>the</b> <b>PNC</b> NN force. <b>The</b> analysis of the experimental data at 13. 6, 45 and 221 MeV simultaneously has been performed by Carlson et al., who concluded to {{an agreement with the}} original DDH estimates for <b>the</b> <b>PNC</b> meson-nucleon couplings. In this work, it is shown first that the comparison with updated hadronic predictions of these couplings rather suggests the existence of some discrepancy for <b>the</b> <b>PNC</b> ω NN coupling. The effect of variations on the strong coupling constants and introduction of cutoffs in the one-boson-exchange weak potential is then investigated. As expected, {{it turns out that the}} resulting asymmetry is quite sensitive to these parameters regardless of the energy. However the above discrepancy persists.
