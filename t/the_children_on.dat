5|$|Despite the {{impending}} divorce, Farrar initially declined {{to move out}} of the family home. He was concerned that Green, who had never been a heavy drinker of alcohol, was suddenly consuming large quantities of it while supervising the children. Though Green continued her routine of ferrying the children to after-school activities, she would spend her evenings drinking at home, sometimes to the point of unconsciousness and nearly always until she lost what inhibitions she had left about her language in front of <b>the</b> <b>children.</b> <b>On</b> one occasion, Farrar was called home from work by the children, who had found their mother unresponsive. Green had disappeared from the home by the time Farrar arrived there, and though he eventually discovered that she had been hiding in the basement while he searched for her, she claimed at the time to have been wandering the town, hoping to be hit by a car. Farrar moved out of the family home in early autumn due to concerns about his personal safety.|$|E
5|$|Yang expresses {{difficulty}} {{connecting with}} <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>on</b> pediatrics, to Robbins' disappointment. Tom becomes frightened when he notices Lexie is {{not wearing a}} name tag, so she attacks her and runs away. His mother is subsequently diagnosed with an abdominal aortic aneurysm, for which requires surgery, and Tom falls down the stairs, for which also requires surgery. Dr. Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez) returns to the hospital, and informs Robbins that Yang is just sucking up. The Crawley's are uneasy about agreeing to surgery, but Dr. Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson) convinces them {{that it is the}} right thing to do. An obstetrics and gynecology resident accidentally cuts off a baby's arm during a caesarian section, but it is healed by plastic surgeon Dr. Mark Sloan (Eric Dane), Robbins, and Yang. Stevens assists Shepherd with a five-hour craniotomy, and Karev is fearful that she cannot handle it, although she is ultimately able to complete the surgery. At the conclusion of the episode, human resources sends out an email notifying Olivia Harper (Sarah Utterback) and Dr. Steve Mostow (Mark Saul)'s wife Megan (Molly Kidder), that they have been fired.|$|E

25|$|Current {{studies have}} shown a {{correlation}} between maternal sensitivity or insensitivity, negative discipline and childhood aggression.

500|$|Though Mary Godwin {{received}} little formal education, her father tutored {{her in a}} broad range of subjects. He often took <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>on</b> educational outings, and they had access to his library and to the many intellectuals who visited him, including the Romantic poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge and the former vice-president of the United States Aaron Burr. Godwin admitted he was not educating the children according to Mary Wollstonecraft's philosophy as outlined in works such as A Vindication of the Rights of Woman (1792), but Mary Godwin nonetheless received an unusual and advanced education for a girl of the time. She had a governess, a daily tutor, and read many of her father's children's books on Roman and Greek history in manuscript. For six months in 1811, she also attended a boarding school in Ramsgate. Her father described her at age 15 as [...] "singularly bold, somewhat imperious, and active of mind. Her desire of knowledge is great, and her perseverance in everything she undertakes almost invincible." ...|$|E

500|$|Writer Hannah Louise Shearer {{pitched the}} episode to {{associate}} producer D. C. Fontana, highlighting the families living {{on board the}} Enterprise. While the pilot episode [...] "Encounter at Farpoint" [...] first mentioned <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>on</b> the ship, [...] "When the Bough Breaks" [...] {{was the first time}} they had been used as a plot element. Shearer also discussed a story idea with series creator Gene Roddenberry about [...] "a society that had lost its humanity in favor of technology". Originally, there was a subplot involving the separation of the saucer section with the saucer taken hostage. Shearer described Wheaton's performance in the episode as [...] "just wonderful". [...] "When the Bough Breaks" [...] was the first of five episodes credited to Shearer; she later described it as her favourite episode. It was the only episode of the series directed by Kim Manners. Manners later produced the television series The X-Files and Supernatural.|$|E
500|$|In , {{the authors}} cite [...] "escaping from a cult commune in 'The Joy of Sect'" [...] as {{evidence}} of [...] "Aristotle's virtuous personality traits in Marge." [...] As the title suggests, the book [...] examines [...] "The Joy of Sect" [...] from a psychological point of view. It discusses the psychology of decision-making in the episode, noting, [...] "Homer is becoming a full-blown member of the Movementarians not by a rational choice,... but {{through the process of}} escalating behavioral commitments." [...] The Psychology of the Simpsons explains the key recruitment techniques used by the Movementarians, including the charismatic leader, established authority based on a religious entity or alien being (in this case [...] "Blisstonia"), and the method of taking away free choice through acceptance of the Leader's greatness. The book also analyzes the techniques used during the six-hour Movementarian recruitment film. In that scene, those who rise to leave are reminded that they are allowed to leave whenever they wish. They are, however, questioned in front of the group as to specifically why they wish to leave, and these individuals end up staying to finish watching the film. The book describes this technique as [...] "subtle pressure", in contrast to the [...] "razor wire, landmines, angry dogs, crocodiles and evil mystery bubble Marge confronts to escape, while being reminded again that she is certainly free to leave". The Psychology of the Simpsons writes that [...] "the Leader" [...] is seen as an authority figure, because [...] "he has knowledge or abilities that others do not, but want". Instead of traditional mathematics textbooks, <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>on</b> the compound learn from Arithmetic the Leader's Way and Science for Leader Lovers.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{contains}} {{a number of}} other cultural references. When Peter and Lois enter their motel room and find a hooker on the bed, Peter warns Lois to stay perfectly still, as the prostitute's vision is based on movement. This is a reference to a scene in the movie Jurassic Park (1993) in which Dr. Grant gives this warning in reference to a Tyrannosaurus Rex. Pinocchio appears in a cutaway gag, in which Gepetto bends over and deliberately sets Pinocchio up to tell a lie in an attempt to emulate anal sex. This was based on a joke MacFarlane's mother had told her friends when he was a child. Lois yells out George Clooney's name when she and Peter are having sex. The 1950s sitcom The Honeymooners is also referenced when a fictional episode of the sitcom is shown in which Ralph Kramden, the show's main character, hits his wife, Alice, something he would only threaten to do on the show. Meg watches an episode of the CBS sitcom Two and a Half Men, which shows three men in a living room, one of whom is cut in half at the waist and screaming in agony, the other two standing over him and screaming in horror. Fictional army soldier Flint of [...] appears briefly after Chris is caught drinking vodka, and educates <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>on</b> drinking and informs them that [...] "...knowing is half the battle". Flint's voice was provided by Bill Ratner, the actor who had voiced the character in the G.I. Joe television series. According to Seth Green, who voices Chris, the reason the Family Guy cast members did not voice Flint themselves is because if you have the original actor providing the voice [...] "you take it with a little bit more gravitas".|$|E
