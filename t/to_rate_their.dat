There are many negative effects that body dissatisfaction can have these include: that some research suggests a link between body dissatisfaction in girls and smoking.

Returning to his dorm, Zuckerberg writes an {{insulting}} entry about Albright on his LiveJournal blog and then creates a campus website called Facemash by hacking into college databases to steal photos of female students, then allowing site visitors <b>to</b> <b>rate</b> <b>their</b> attractiveness.

Subjective measures of SA are attractive {{in that they}} are relatively straightforward and easy to administer. [...] However, several limitations should be noted. Individuals making subjective assessments of their own SA are often unaware of information they do not know (the [...] "unknown unknowns"). Subjective measures also tend to be global in nature, and, as such, do not fully exploit the multivariate nature of SA to provide the detailed diagnostics available with objective measures. Nevertheless, self-ratings may be useful in that they can provide an assessment of operators' degree of confidence in their SA and their own performance. Measuring how SA is perceived by the operator may provide information as important as the operator's actual SA, since errors in perceived SA quality (over-confidence or under-confidence in SA) may have just as harmful an effect on an individual's or team's decision-making as errors in their actual SA (Endsley, 1998).|$|E
