40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} impact of <b>the</b> <b>retailer’s</b> overconfident {{behavior}} on supply chain performance. We start with a basic model on the rational newsvendor model and investigate <b>the</b> <b>retailer’s</b> optimal ordering decision and expected profit. Next, we extend the basic model and introduce an overconfident retailer. We find that <b>the</b> <b>retailer’s</b> overconfident behavior does not necessarily damage the supply chain compared with the basic model when the overconfident level does not exceed a threshold. We also design the cooperation and buyback mechanism and conduct numerical analysis to compare <b>the</b> manufacturer’s and <b>retailer’s</b> expected profits and real profits {{with those in the}} basic newsvendor model. It can achieve Pareto improvement in the supply chain when the overconfident level is low. When <b>the</b> <b>retailer’s</b> overconfident level exceeds a threshold, <b>the</b> <b>retailer’s</b> ordering decision cannot make the whole supply chain sustainable development...|$|R

5|$|New {{purchases}} {{of the game}} are provided with a one-time use card granting access code that unlocks the game's Cerberus Network, an online downloadable content and news service that enables bonus content for the game. However, users who bought the game used {{would have to pay}} for the Cerberus Network separately if they wanted access to the new content. This policy allows publishers to combat the used-game market; companies like GameStop have allowed costumers to sell used games back to <b>the</b> <b>retailer</b> so that the company can resell them at a small discount to other customers, but the publisher does not make a profit. BioWare online development director Fernando Melo revealed that 11% of all Mass Effect 2s downloadable content revenue came from the Cerberus Network. The policy attracted criticism from some of the fan community, who have criticized downloadable content as being overpriced and an incentive for developers to leave items out of the initial release.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} {{inventory}} pooling coalitions within a decentralized distribution system {{consisting of a}} manufacturer, a warehouse (or an integration center), and n <b>retailers.</b> At <b>the</b> time their orders are placed, <b>the</b> <b>retailers</b> know their demand distribution but {{do not know the}} exact value of the demand. After certain production and transportation lead time elapses, the orders arrive at the warehouse. During this time, <b>the</b> <b>retailers</b> can update their demand forecasts. We first focus on cooperation among <b>the</b> <b>retailers</b> – <b>the</b> <b>retailers</b> coordinate their initial orders and can reallocate their orders in the warehouse after they receive more information about their demand and update their demand forecasts. We study two types of cooperation: forecast sharing and joint forecasting. By using an example, we illustrate how forecast sharing collaboration might worsen performance, and asymmetric forecasting capabilities of <b>the</b> <b>retailers</b> might harm <b>the</b> cooperation. However, this does not happen if <b>the</b> <b>retailers</b> possess symmetric forecasting capabilities or they cooperate by joint forecasting, and the associated cooperative games have non-empty cores. Finally, we analyze the impact that cooperation and non-cooperation of <b>the</b> <b>retailers</b> has on <b>the</b> manufacturer’s profit. We focus on coordination of the entire supply chain through a three-parameter buyback contract. We show that our three-parameter contract can coordinate the system if <b>the</b> <b>retailers</b> have symmetric margins. Moreover, under such a contract the manufacturer benefits from retailers’ cooperation since he can get a share of improved performance...|$|R

5|$|The Resale Prices Bill was {{introduced}} to deny manufacturers and suppliers the power to stipulate the prices at which their goods must be sold by <b>the</b> <b>retailer.</b> At the time, up to forty per cent of goods sold in Britain were subject to such price fixing, {{to the detriment of}} competition and to the disadvantage of the consumer. Douglas-Home, less instinctively liberal on economic matters than Heath, would probably not have sponsored such a proposal unprompted. However, he gave Heath his backing, in the face of opposition from some cabinet colleagues, including Butler, Hailsham and Lloyd, and a substantial number of Conservative backbenchers. They believed the change would benefit supermarkets and other large retailers at the expense of proprietors of small shops. The government was forced to make concessions to avoid defeat. Retail price maintenance would continue to be legal for some goods; these included books, on which it remained in force until market forces led to its abandonment in 1995. Manufacturers and suppliers would also be permitted to refuse to supply any retailer who sold their goods at less than cost price, as a loss leader. The bill had a difficult Parliamentary passage during which the Labour party generally abstained, leaving the Conservatives to vote for or against their own government. The bill received the royal assent in July 1964, but did not become operative until 1965, by which time Douglas-Home, Heath and their colleagues were out of office.|$|E

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{delivering}} goods from a central storage warehouse {{to a network}} of <b>retailers</b> distributed over <b>the</b> territory is considered in this paper.

40|$|April, 2013 In this paper, {{we examine}} the role of {{inventory}} in the price-setting behavior of a distributive firm.

We also show a negative relation between the frequency of bargain sales and the price elasticity of demand. These results denote that price stickiness varies by the retailers’ characteristics. In this paper, we consider that the hidden mechanism of price stickiness comes from <b>the</b> <b>retailer’s</b> policy for inventory investment.

40|$|The {{performance}} of a marketing channel depends on its information structure. It is high when both manufacturer and retailers have accurate information about demand conditions.

Hence, <b>the</b> <b>retailers</b> {{do not believe the}} transmitted information. However, in the case in which the manufacturer has to accept any unsold goods, it does not have any incentives to pass on misleading information.

40|$|This paper studies a single-vendor-multi-retailer {{supply chain}} and {{considers}} {{the case where}} the vendor merges with one of its <b>retailers.</b> After <b>the</b> merger, the vendor supplies products to the market both through a direct (integrated) sales channel and through <b>the</b> remaining <b>retailers.</b> Different types of competition are considered for <b>the</b> <b>retailers,</b> namely volume competition, price competition, and no competition. The operations policies of the vendor and <b>the</b> <b>retailers</b> are considered explicitly in this paper by taking account of inventory carrying, setup and ordering costs that result from production and ordering decisions.
