5|$|Drivers can {{get away}} with this rule-breaking due to their paper-based log books. As a driver records their time spent behind the wheel, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> little to stop them from forging their log books. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> {{superficial}} oversight and some drivers take advantage of this fact. Surveys indicate that between 25% and 75% of drivers violate the HOS. Other drivers maintain more than one log book, showing falsified versions to enforcement officers.|$|E

5|$|Although Stretford {{town centre}} is busy during the day, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> {{little in the}} way of a night-time economy. There are no {{restaurants}} or other entertainments except for a number of public houses and members-only social clubs. There are two public libraries, Greatstone Library, part of Stretford Sports Village, and Stretford Library, both run by Trafford Council.|$|E
5|$|<b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> little {{consistency}} in Freemasonry. Because each Masonic jurisdiction is independent, each sets its own procedures. The {{wording of the}} ritual, the number of officers present, {{the layout of the}} meeting room, etc. varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.|$|E
5|$|Because {{there is}} a {{temperature}} difference between the core and the surface, or photosphere, energy is transported outward. The two modes for transporting this energy are radiation and convection. A radiation zone, where energy is transported by radiation, is stable against convection and <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> little mixing of the plasma. By contrast, in a convection zone the energy is transported by bulk movement of plasma, with hotter material rising and cooler material descending. Convection is a more efficient mode for carrying energy than radiation, but it will only occur under conditions that create a steep temperature gradient.|$|E

5|$|Designed {{for future}} {{expansion}} to accommodate additional aircraft, {{there has been}} talk of a terminal expansion, though official plans {{have yet to be}} announced. However, with the gate space being used to 100 percent capacity at peak times, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> little capacity available for new flights unless they arrive and depart at off-peak times (10 AM-12 PM),(7 PM-10 PM).|$|E
5|$|However, {{he still}} {{preferred}} Arabic authors more than Persian ones. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> little evidence which shows {{his interest in}} Persian poetry. He spoke Arabic, wrote in Arabic and was {{proud to be a}} student of a famous Arab grammarian. He studied science in Arabic, including astronomy and mathematics. Many books written in Arabic were dedicated to him whether religious or secular content. Apparently showing interest in Arabic rather than Persian, Adud al-Dawla followed the mainstream of intellectual life in a provincial town where culture was dominated by Arabic and Persian.|$|E
5|$|Language and {{personal}} names provide some difficulties. The former {{is an important}} indicator of culture but <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> little direct evidence for its use in specific circumstances during the period under consideration. Pictish, Middle Irish and Old Norse would certainly have been spoken and Woolf (2007) suggests that a significant degree of linguistic balkanisation took place. As a result, single individuals often appear in sources {{under a variety of}} different names.|$|E
50|$|After the Bronze Age collapse, Crete {{was settled}} by new waves of Greeks from the mainland. A number of city states {{developed}} in the Archaic period. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> limited contact with mainland Greece, and Greek historiography shows little interest in Crete, so that <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> few literary sources.|$|R

5|$|<b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> limited data on reproduction. Young are {{probably}} born near {{the start of}} the rainy season, in November–December, when food is plentiful. Six bats were caught at the roost site in Kianjavato, of which only one was a male; this led Bates and colleagues to suggest that the species may be polygynous, with groups consisting of a male and multiple females.|$|E
5|$|<b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> little {{evidence}} of prehistoric activity in the area, especially pre-Iron Age; however, Celtic names {{in the area around}} Wigan—such as Bryn, Makerfield and Ince—indicate that the Celtic people of Britain were active in the area in the Iron Age. The first people believed to have settled in the Wigan area were the Brigantes, a Celtic tribe who controlled most of northern Britain.|$|E
5|$|<b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> little {{geographic}} {{variation in}} size. The main differences are {{the presence or}} absence of a whitish partial collar at the base of the nape, the variations in the shade of the nape and the tone of the underparts. Populations in central Asia have slightly larger wings and western populations have a slightly heavier bill. Body colour becomes darker further north, in mountain regions and humid climates, and paler elsewhere. However, individual variation, particularly in juveniles and also during the months before moulting, can often be greater than geographic differences.|$|E

5|$|<b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> little {{information}} as {{to the effects of}} Pauline on Mexico, but during the passage of the hurricane over Magdalena Bay, a boat disappeared with its five occupants. Despite a large-scale search for the boat or any possible remnants, no trace was ever found. The remnants of Pauline triggered showers over the southwest United States and may have been responsible for a damaging tornado which occurred near Glendale, Arizona.|$|E
5|$|<b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> little obvious {{landscape}} evidence remaining of {{the previous}} mining activities around Clutton, Temple Cloud, High Littleton and Timsbury. However {{there is a very}} large Batch almost in the middle of Camerton that is now a designated Local Nature Reserve. The Batch was bare, like the Paulton ones until, according to locals, the wife of the owner of Camerton Court decided to pay for it to be planted with trees to improve the view. There are small batches at Clutton, east of Radford Hill and at Greyfields, High Littleton.|$|E
5|$|<b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> {{little voice}} {{acting in the}} game, {{as is the case}} in most The Legend of Zelda titles to date. Link remains silent in conversation, but grunts when attacking or injured and gasps when surprised. His {{emotions}} and responses are largely indicated visually by nods and facial expressions. Other characters have similar language-independent verbalizations, including laughter, surprised or fearful exclamations, and screams. Midna has the most voice acting—her on-screen dialogue is often accompanied by a babble of pseudo-speech, which was produced by scrambling English phrases sampled by Japanese voice actress Akiko Kōmoto.|$|E

5|$|Two {{or three}} feet of snow may turn into less than a foot of ice. The weight above makes deeper layers of ice thin and flow outwards. Ice is lost {{at the edges of}} the glacier to icebergs, or to summer melting, and the overall shape of the glacier does not change much with time. The outward flow can distort the layers, so it is {{desirable}} to drill deep ice cores at places where <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> little flow. These can be located using maps of the flow lines.|$|E
5|$|Unlike some MMORPGs, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> little {{focus on}} player versus player (PvP) combat, instead the game {{revolves}} around player versus environment (PvE). There are numerous PvE activities and events for players to partake in, including instanced activities and shared spaces activities. Some instanced events include Dynamis, Salvage, Assault and Nyzul Isle, which involve anywhere between 6 and 64 players. These battle grounds give players {{a series of}} objectives to overcome or complete and enemies to defeat, generally within a certain time frame. Popular shared spaces activities include hunting Notorious Monsters, fiends that rarely appear and drop precious loot.|$|E
5|$|A simple model which predicts lyotropic phase {{transitions}} is the hard-rod model {{proposed by}} Lars Onsager. This theory considers the volume {{excluded from the}} center-of-mass of one idealized cylinder as it approaches another. Specifically, if the cylinders are oriented parallel to one another, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> little volume that is excluded from the center-of-mass of the approaching cylinder (it can come quite close to the other cylinder). If, however, the cylinders are at some angle to one another, {{then there is a}} large volume surrounding the cylinder which the approaching cylinder's center-of-mass cannot enter (due to the hard-rod repulsion between the two idealized objects). Thus, this angular arrangement sees a decrease in the net positional entropy of the approaching cylinder (there are fewer states available to it).|$|E

That happens often.|$|R
