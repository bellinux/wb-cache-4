50|$|It {{is normal}} for IP {{protocol}} stack software to keep many copies of different IP packets, for <b>transmission,</b> <b>reception</b> {{and to keep}} copies in case {{they need to be}} resent. uIP is economical in its use of memory because it uses only one packet buffer. First, it uses the packet buffer in a half-duplex way, using it in turn for <b>transmission</b> and <b>reception.</b> Also, when uIP needs to retransmit a packet, it calls the application code in a way that requests for the previous data to be reproduced.|$|R

50|$|The {{repeater}} bit {{is a part}} of the HDCPv1 and HDCPv2 specifications, {{which is}} available on the digital content protection LLC web site. The specification defines repeater devices:HDCP Repeater. An HDCP device that can receive and decrypt HDCP content through one or more of its HDCP-protected <b>interface</b> <b>ports,</b> and can also re-encrypt and emit said HDCP content through one or more of its HDCP-protected <b>interface</b> <b>ports,</b> is referred to as an HDCP repeater. An HDCP repeater may also be referred to as either an HDCP receiver or an HDCP transmitter when referring to either the upstream side or the downstream side, respectively.|$|R

30|$|In a {{perfectly}} synchronized scenario, FBMC maintains the orthogonality between users, {{thanks to its}} excellent spectral containment. For all other waveform candidates including OFDM, the orthogonality between users comes from the perfect alignment of <b>transmission</b> and <b>reception</b> windows.

30|$|Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) {{technology}} is popular in wireless communications {{due to the}} increased spectrum efficiency brought along {{by the use of}} multiple antennas in <b>transmission,</b> <b>reception,</b> or both.
