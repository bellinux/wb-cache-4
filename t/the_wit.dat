5|$|The {{book has}} been called engagingly written, wisely researched, and {{honestly}} told. Critics admired <b>the</b> <b>wit</b> and humour. The book reviewer for The Globe and Mail admitted he grew impatient with the grand and repetitive statements about the changing global food system and the authors' hyperbole regarding their modest culinary discoveries. Compared to Kingsolver's Animal, Vegetable, Miracle, The 100-Mile Diet {{was found to be}} more compelling and easier to read, with Smith and MacKinnon more relatable and sympathetic than Kingsolver.|$|E
5|$|Introduced in A Game of Thrones (1996), Tyrion is a dwarf {{and member}} of House Lannister, {{one of the wealthiest}} and most {{powerful}} families in the fictional kingdom of Westeros.

A sense of virtual community often develops around forums that have regular users. Technology, video games, sports, music, fashion, religion, and politics are popular areas for forum themes, but there are forums for a huge number of topics. Internet slang and image macros popular across the Internet are abundant and widely used in Internet forums.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} 1953, Crawford went to Townsville {{for several}} months to assist in {{reporting}} for the Guardian newspaper on the very successful North QLD Rank and File Worker's convention. The Playwrights Advisory Board sponsored a playwriting competition in 1955 and Crawford entered a three-act play. This play was titled <b>The</b> <b>Wit</b> to Woo and was about a hospitalised patient who had a dream of finding a hard working life. Crawford wrote another play for the Ipswich Drama Festival of 1956 called They Passed this Way. It was about the old Windmill cum Observatory on Wickham Terrace, Brisbane and was performed in Brisbane by New Theatre. Jim wrote several radio features about this time, The Avenging Ghost of Campbell Town and The Celebrated Mr Barrington with various successes.|$|E
25|$|In January 1981, the {{government}} returned Tutu's passport to him. In March, he {{embarked on a}} five-week visit to ten countries in Europe and North America, meeting politicians including the UN Secretary General Kurt Waldheim, and addressing the UN Special Committee Against Apartheid. In the UK he met Runcie and in Rome spent {{a few minutes with}} Pope John Paul II. On his return to South Africa, Botha again ordered his passport confiscated. In August 1983, South Africans opposed to apartheid formed the United Democratic Front (UDF), with Tutu selected as one of the organisation's patrons. His rhetoric of angry defiance against {{the government}} alienated many white liberals, who believed that apartheid could be gradually reformed away; among the white liberals who spoke out against Tutu were Alan Paton and Bill Burnett. He nevertheless remained close with other prominent white liberals like Helen Suzman. He was also criticised in pro-government press outlets like The Citizen and the South African Broadcasting Corporation, while receiving death threats from white far-right groups like <b>the</b> <b>Wit</b> Wolwe and Wit Kommando.|$|E

25|$|Prospector Arthur Megson {{heard of}} their venture {{and decided to}} {{investigate}} {{near the town of}} Odendaalsrus in 1904. He gathered samples of exposed strata near an outcrop, which by then was part of Hendrik Petrus Klopper's farm Aandenk. He too did not succeed in obtaining any interest from companies until October 1932, when he presented his findings to Allan Roberts and Mannie Jacobs. The area needed to be tested by drilling, and the first borehole was started on 5 May 1933. Jacobs managed to interest two men, Fritz Marx and Peter Woolf, in the venture and <b>the</b> <b>Wit</b> Extensions Company was formed later that year. Although the borehole, which by then penetrated more than 1200 metres, yielded 120 inch pennyweights of gold (roughly 480 centimetre grams per ton), it was not enough to garner financial assistance and the operation had to close due to depleted finances. (For gold ores to be payable in South Africa, the grade must typically exceed 960 cengrams - the equivalent of 8 grams per ton over a 120cm stope width, which after dilution will yield 4g/t in the mill).|$|E
