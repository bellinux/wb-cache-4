5|$|Prussia {{tried to}} take {{opportunity}} of the Russian Empire's wars with the Ottoman Empire and Sweden and move the weak Commonwealth into its sphere of influence. Some factions in the Commonwealth deemed {{this as an opportunity}} to shake free from decades of Russian control. That said, Prussia did not expect much from the alliance, not even that it would pass. When the treaty was first proposed to the Great Sejm by Prussian ambassador Ludwig Heinrich Buchholtz on 13 October 1788, Prussians expected that it would cause long and fruitless debate which only outcome would be to ensure the weakening of Russian (and to a lesser degree, Austrian) position in Poland. Overall, for Prussia, the alliance with Poland was only one of several potential options; but for some Polish politicians it became a new, and increasingly, only available strategy. The reception of Prussian proposal by the Sejm exceeded their expectations, and it has significantly strengthened the Patriotic Party. For the next year or so, Prussians decided to delay taking any clear action, keeping their options open. Buchholtz was also reprimanded for allowing things <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>too</b> <b>far,</b> and another Prussian diplomat, Girolamo Lucchesini, was sent to Warsaw to aid him.|$|E
25|$|Austin {{was headed}} for {{re-election}} to the State House in 1980 but chose instead {{to run for the}} State Senate against an 18-year incumbent Edward Zemprelli, who was also the State Senate Majority Leader. Austin charged that Zemprelli had been in office too long and had not done enough for the district. His critics said Austin had only served one-term in the State House and should wait before trying <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>too</b> <b>far</b> too fast politically.|$|E
500|$|Dishonored was not {{developed}} with a sequel in mind, but ideas for one {{began to emerge}} during the development of its downloadable content. Harvey Smith called the decision to play as Emily as intuitive at the start, with Emily having been {{a child in the}} original game. The impact that Emily had on players in Dishonored, which changed how the game was being played, made the developer decide to continue her story and give her more depth in Dishonored 2. Although this meant moving the timeline along, Arkane did not want <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>too</b> <b>far</b> for fear of losing the series' gaslamp fantasy / steampunk vibe. The choice to include Corvo as an alternate player character was itself a later decision.|$|E

'When Captain Hood {{suddenly}} sighted his implacable enemies the French, he {{gave way}} to an outbreak of rage and violent exclamations, and he even made a proposal which might have renewed hostilities had he failed to give prompt satisfaction.

The mass centralization of the 2007 model was thought <b>to</b> have <b>gone</b> <b>too</b> <b>far,</b> and instead the 2008 model is more open, reducing heat and improving balance. The factory team riders are Pedrosa (through 2009) and Hayden (through 2008). Satellite team riders are Nakano, Andrea Dovizioso, Randy de Puniet and Alex de Angelis.|$|R
50|$|As {{a result}} of the {{disturbances}} accompanying the 1981 South African tour of New Zealand many citizens, including normally law-abiding citizens, were alleged <b>to</b> have <b>gone</b> <b>too</b> <b>far</b> when indulging in protest activity. The importance of preserving law and order was rightly stressed. The Courts applied the law impartially. There were numerous prosecutions, many of them successful. It is now no less appropriate that the lawfulness of the Union's decision under its own constitution to arrange the proposed tour should be open to test in the Courts.|$|R
500|$|Correspondent {{and author}} Warren Moscow wrote that after 1940, Willkie helped Roosevelt, {{who was always}} careful not <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>too</b> <b>far</b> in front of public opinion, [...] "as a pace-setter with the President's blessing". Willkie's global trip and the {{publication}} of One World increased {{public support for the}} idea that the United States should remain active internationally once the war was won, and should not withdraw into a new isolationism. [...] Indiana University president Herman B Wells noted that One World [...] "has had such a profound influence on the thinking of Americans". Zipp noted, [...] "He launched the most successful and unprecedented challenge to conventional nationalism in modern American history... He urged [...] to imagine and feel a new form of reciprocity with the world, one that millions of Americans responded to with unprecedented urgency." ...|$|E
500|$|With little land {{action in}} the west, the initial months of the war were dubbed the [...] "Bore War", later renamed the [...] "Phoney War" [...] by journalists. Chamberlain, in common with most Allied {{officials}} and generals, felt the war could be won relatively quickly by keeping economic pressure on Germany through a blockade while continuing rearmament. Chamberlain was reluctant <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>too</b> <b>far</b> in altering the British economy. The government submitted an emergency war budget about which Chamberlain stated, [...] "the {{only thing that matters}} is to win the war, though we may go bankrupt in the process". However, actual government expenditures rose by little more than the rate of inflation between September 1939 and March 1940. Despite these difficulties, Chamberlain still enjoyed approval ratings as high as 68% and almost 60% in April 1940.|$|E
500|$|According to Oborne, Vorster was {{a pragmatic}} {{politician}} {{who wanted to}} maintain apartheid {{and to make it}} appear acceptable to the outside world. To this end, attempting to broaden South Africa's international connections, he accepted black foreign diplomats in the country and began to plan a policy to allow mixed-race sport to prevent South Africa's international isolation. However, such policies were unpopular with his domestic supporters and he was careful not <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>too</b> <b>far.</b> Oborne writes: [...] "Vorster knew that there was a limit to how far he could go without imperilling his own position. That limit was Basil D'Oliveira." [...] According to Oborne, Vorster never intended to allow D'Oliveira to play with the MCC team; his supporters would not have accepted a non-white South African benefiting from this change of policy and demonstrating his ability at a high level. Vorster therefore worked to give the impression overseas that D'Oliveira would be welcome, {{while at the same time}} doing his utmost to stop him from playing. He courted the British ambassador, Sir John Nicholls, and told him that a tour party including D'Oliveira would be acceptable. Nicholls passed this on to the UK government. Vorster meanwhile monitored D'Oliveira's progress closely; from his debut in 1966, South Africa kept a security file on him.|$|E

50|$|Many years later, an {{interview}} with Nancy Kelsey {{was published in the}} San Francisco Examiner where she recollected the trip across the continent; she said the group had no guide and no compass. Nancy Kelsey was the first white woman to see the Great Salt Lake in Utah. The emigrants had been told <b>to</b> not <b>go</b> <b>too</b> <b>far</b> south or north of the lake, but to strike westward from it. On September 16, the wagons and most of their contents were left on the west face of Nevada's Ruby Mountains, near Owens Lake and the present day Oasis, Nevada.|$|R
5000|$|Guibert or Wibert of Ravenna ( [...] 1029 - 8 September 1100) was an Italian prelate, {{archbishop}} of Ravenna, {{who was elected}} pope in 1080 in opposition to Pope Gregory VII. Gregory {{was the leader of}} the movement in the church which opposed the traditional claim of European monarchs to control ecclesiastical appointments, and this was opposed by supporters of monarchical rights led by the Holy Roman Emperor. This led to the conflict known as the Investiture Controversy. Gregory was felt by many <b>to</b> have <b>gone</b> <b>too</b> <b>far</b> when he excommunicated the Holy Roman Emperor Henry IV and supported a rival claimant as emperor, and in 1080 the pro-imperial Synod of Brixen pronounced that Gregory was deposed and replaced as pope by Guibert.|$|R
2500|$|Despite his {{classical}} crossover success, Garðar has said, [...] "I don't want <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>too</b> <b>far</b> {{down the}} pop side because then I think I would lose {{credibility in the}} classical world. If the album [...] does well, hopefully I could use that to my advantage, but I'm a classical opera singer – that's what I do, that's what I am." [...] His ambition is to sing Otello at the Royal Opera House in Covent Garden, London.|$|E

5000|$|In {{his meeting}} with China's Buddhist monks,Karl Ludvig Reichelt {{developed}} a new view on mission work that made him controversial. Particularly controversial was his view of God's revelation and the religions (especially Buddhism) as a preparation for the gospel (praeparatio evangelica), his dialogical method, and his positive evaluation of other religions. NMS became concerned that Reichelt openness <b>to</b> Buddhism <b>went</b> <b>too</b> <b>far,</b> especially when Reichelt meant to find [...] "points of light and connection points brought forth by God's Holy Spirit ... in their sacred writings (and) in their rituals and thinking systems [...] ". It ended with NMS calling Reichelt home for consultations due to this and some financial problems, and it ended with the split from Reichelt in 1925.|$|R
2500|$|He {{changed the}} circus into {{what it is}} today by mixing animals, acrobats and clowns. His first break came in 1841 when he got a job of {{presenting}} a pig named Sybil who could do many tricks including the ability to tell time. From there he moved on to singing and dancing and {{got caught up in the}} popularity of the 'negro song', singing in blackface. He was said <b>to</b> sometimes <b>go</b> <b>too</b> <b>far</b> and make the song coarse. Gaining fame and popularity he changed styles once again he starred in various parodies of works by William Shakespeare, including that of [...] "Dan Rice's Version of Othello" [...] and [...] "Dan Rice's Multifarious Account of Shakespeare's Hamlet" [...] He would perform these with various songs and dialects showing just how versatile he was.|$|R
40|$|Profit {{incentives}} {{and the private}} sector generate and deliver useful products and, reasonable regulation of new technologies and education of farmers in their application can enhance and prolong their usefulness. But, in today’s global market, property rights, regulations, and liability concerns seem <b>to</b> have <b>gone</b> <b>too</b> <b>far</b> and made access by the poor to new agricultural technologies too difficult. Getting good farm technology to over two billion poor, small-scale farmers in developing countries {{in a way that is}} responsible and sustainable is likely to remain a public-sector responsibility. It will require that governments, public research institutions, non-governmental organizations, and corporations devise new ways of doing business and of forming partnerships that accommodate the interests of the majority of the world’s people located in developing countries, as well as the concerns of the technology providers, users who can pay, and consumers in wealthy countrie...|$|R

Although {{it seems as if}} Boo is interested, she giggles naughtily, intending <b>to</b> <b>go</b> exploring rather than playing. Sulley warns her not <b>to</b> <b>go</b> off <b>too</b> <b>far,</b> but Boo simply responds by giggling. Turning a corner, guests find that Randall has returned from the human world, determined to capture Boo to extract her scream, via the usage of a butterfly net. Randall's evil laugh still echoes through the factory, the vehicles turn and face a window overlooking all of Monstropolis at nightfall. Mike stands nearby at the switch of a power generator, that supposedly gives power to all of Monstropolis. Mike kicks a flashlight tag off by turning off the generator, causing the entire factory and the city <b>to</b> <b>go</b> dark.|$|R
25|$|After Giotto, Fra Angelico {{and others}} {{systematically}} developed uncluttered images {{that focused on}} the depiction of Jesus with an ideal human beauty, in works like Leonardo da Vinci's Last Supper, arguably the first High Renaissance painting. Images of Jesus now drew on classical sculpture, at least in some of their poses. However Michelangelo was considered <b>to</b> have <b>gone</b> much <b>too</b> <b>far</b> in his beardless Christ in his The Last Judgment fresco in the Sistine Chapel, which very clearly adapted classical sculptures of Apollo, and this path was rarely followed by other artists.|$|R

2500|$|Also in 1910, Stieglitz led {{an effort}} to create a major {{exhibition}} of the Photo-Secession artists at what was then called the Albright Gallery in Buffalo, New York (now known as the Albright-Knox Art Gallery). While this effort was announced as a group activity of the Photo-Secession, Stieglitz refused to allow any others to have input or make decision about who would be included in the exhibition and how it would be displayed. Stieglitz, who was already known for his domineering ways and dogmatic approach to photography, took his self-assigned, unilateral authority even beyond his past actions; in this case he proved <b>to</b> have <b>gone</b> <b>too</b> <b>far</b> for several people who had been closely aligned with him. First Käsebier, then White and finally Steichen broke off their relationship with Stieglitz, each citing Stieglitz's overbearing ego, his refusal to consider other's viewpoints and his repeated actions on behalf of the Photo-Secession without consulting any of the so-called [...] "members" [...] of the group.|$|R

50|$|Echegaray {{tried to}} combine two {{incompatible}} elements: an exaggerated romanticism with the latent positivism and realism of his time. This {{results in a}} theater of contemporary custom, using the Romantic method, in which, according <b>to</b> critics, he <b>goes</b> <b>too</b> <b>far</b> in his use of tragic and pathetic situations. Crises of conscience and ideological problems predominate as themes in his work. Un conflicto entre los deberes (Conflict of Interest) exemplifies these themes.

2500|$|After {{praising the}} Edinburgh Reviews general {{attempts}} at fairness, Hazlitt begins {{to note the}} flaws in its critical tone and method. For instance, in arguing a position, the Edinburgh allows too much {{to the opposite side}} [...] "from an affectation of magnanimity and candour". At times it displays a [...] "supercilious and cavalier" [...] attitude, and has been [...] "guilty of some capital oversights", most notably the failure to recognize the poetic value of Wordsworth and Coleridge's Lyrical Ballads. Also, in its attempts to be fair <b>to</b> Malthus, it <b>went</b> <b>too</b> <b>far,</b> and ended by [...] "screen his errors."

Mira was designed to continue the series tradition of having a [...] "sexy femme fatale" [...] character in each game: she was given an open track jacket and a bikini-like top to show off her cleavage, and a jiggle effect was added to her 3D model. Eric's design and 3D modelling went smoothly, with Chime saying that some faces are easier to model than others. Tomono wanted him to specifically have a Caucasian chin and brow, but noted {{that they had to}} be careful <b>to</b> not <b>go</b> <b>too</b> <b>far</b> with it, <b>to</b> avoid a too realistic look. Diana's design was difficult to recreate in 3D, with the initial model having [...] "really chubby chipmunk cheeks", but was worked on until it matched the design. She was also difficult to animate, due to her long skirt. Phi {{was originally}} shorter and had bigger eyes, but after she was given glasses, it was decided that she should look more like a model to match the stylish look of her short hair and glasses. Parts of Sigma's design from Virtue's Last Reward were incorporated into his new one, in the form of embroidery on his polo shirt.|$|R
