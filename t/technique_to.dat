40|$|Radiation-induced hyposalivation {{is still}} a major problem after {{radiotherapy}} for head and neck cancer. Current and promising new thoughts to reduce or salvage radiation damage to salivary gland tissue are explored. The main cause underlying radiation-induced hyposalivation {{is a lack of}} functional saliva-producing acinar cells resulting from radiation-induced stem cell sterilization. Current methods to prevent that damage are radiation <b>techniques</b> <b>to</b> reduce radiation-injury to salivary gland tissue, surgical <b>techniques</b> <b>to</b> relocate salivary glands to a region receiving a lower cumulative radiation dose, and <b>techniques</b> <b>to</b> make salivary gland cells more resistant to radiation injury. These preventive techniques cannot be applied in all cases, also reduce tumor sensitivity, or do not result in a sufficient amelioration of the dryness-related complaints. Therefore, alternative methods on <b>techniques</b> <b>to</b> salvage salivary glands that are damaged by radiation are explored with promising results, such as stem cell therapies and gene transfer <b>techniques</b> <b>to</b> allow the radiation-injured salivary gland tissue to secrete water...|$|R
