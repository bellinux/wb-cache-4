5|$|After the fire, the Apollo {{program was}} {{grounded}} for review and redesign. The Command Module was found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>extremely</b> hazardous and, in some instances, carelessly assembled (for example, a misplaced socket wrench {{was found in}} the cabin).|$|E
5|$|Although {{one might}} expect stylets to be fossilized since they are made of the mineral calcium phosphate, none have been found. As nemertea are {{otherwise}} completely soft-bodied, one would expect fossils of them <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>extremely</b> rare.|$|E
60|$|The {{modifications}} as yet referred <b>to</b> <b>are</b> <b>extremely</b> slight, and in {{most cases}} have been caused, {{as far as we can}} judge, by equally slight differences in the conditions.

5|$|Although not proven, {{recent data}} from the Galileo orbiter {{indicate}} that Io might have its own magnetic field. Io has an extremely thin atmosphere made up mostly of sulfur dioxide (SO2). If a surface data or collection vessel were to land on Io in the future, it would have <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>extremely</b> tough (similar to the tank-like bodies of the Soviet Venera landers) to survive the radiation and magnetic fields that originate from Jupiter.|$|E
5|$|Bismuth {{was long}} {{considered}} the element {{with the highest}} atomic mass that is stable. However, in 2003 it was discovered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>extremely</b> weakly radioactive: its only primordial isotope, bismuth-209, decays via alpha decay with a half-life {{more than a billion}} times the estimated age of the universe. Because of its tremendously long half-life, bismuth may still be considered stable for almost all purposes.|$|E
5|$|Cimabue {{achieves}} a masterful handling of colour; medieval churches tended <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>extremely</b> colourful, with frescoed walls, painted capitals, and gold leaf paintings. Pale tonalities dominate, {{with the main}} contrast found in the dark areas of Christ's hair and beard, which are utilised to make the features of his face stand out more, and position his head as the focal point.|$|E

5|$|Polydopamine {{coatings}} {{can form}} on objects {{ranging in size}} from nanoparticles to large surfaces. Polydopamine layers have chemical properties that have the potential <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>extremely</b> useful, and numerous studies have examined their possible applications. At the simplest level, they can be used for protection against damage by light, or to form capsules for drug delivery. At a more sophisticated level, their adhesive properties may make them useful as substrates for biosensors or other biologically active macromolecules.|$|E
5|$|The {{eruption}} produced pyroclastic flows that melted summit glaciers and snow, generating four thick lahars that raced down river valleys on the volcano's flanks, destroying a {{small lake}} that {{was observed in}} Arenas' crater several months before the eruption. Water in such volcanic lakes tends <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>extremely</b> salty, and may contain dissolved volcanic gases. The lake's hot, acidic water significantly accelerated the melting of the ice, an effect confirmed by the large amounts of sulfates and chlorides found in the lahar flow.|$|E
5|$|Although the Coffins {{had little}} money, their life with Alice's upper-class {{relatives}} gave Marian an almost aristocratic upbringing that {{introduced her to}} high society on the East Coast and enabled her to make social connections that were <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>extremely</b> valuable in later life. However, she received almost no formal education, a deficiency that caused significant problems for her in her college years. She was instead tutored at home, where she also enjoyed the benefits of exposure to fine art and music and became an accomplished horse rider.|$|E

5|$|Both Titus and Domitian were fond of gladiatorial games, and {{realised}} {{its importance}} {{to appease the}} citizens of Rome. In the newly constructed Colosseum, the Flavians provided for spectacular entertainments. The Inaugural games of the Flavian Amphitheatre lasted for a hundred days and were said <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>extremely</b> elaborate, including gladiatorial combat, fights between wild animals (elephants and cranes), mock naval battles for which the theatre was flooded, horse races and chariot races. During the games, wooden balls were dropped into the audience, inscribed with various prizes (clothing, gold, or even slaves), which could then be traded for the designated item.|$|E
5|$|Construction of the Green Line {{south from}} L'Enfant Plaza began in July 1984 when WMATA issued {{a call for}} bids to tunnel under the Anacostia River. The firm of Harrison Western/Franki-Denys (a joint venture) was awarded the $25.6 million contract, with {{construction}} to begin in December 1984. WMATA delayed awarding the contract after American anti-apartheid activists alleged that a Belgian company with a minority financial interest in Franki-Denys did business with the racist white-led government of South Africa, but after the links were discovered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>extremely</b> minor the contract was awarded.|$|E
5|$|Delivered to the Navy on January 30, 1937, the {{aircraft}} was officially {{presented to the}} public at Hall's Bristol, Pennsylvania factory in April of that year. The aircraft's early flight testing, starting in February and conducted by test pilot Bill McAvoy, showed that the XPTBH had few faults, with the only significant issue being a lack of roll authority – a reduction of the ability of the ailerons to turn {{the aircraft}} – {{as a result of the}} surface area of the floats. A modification to increase the area of the rudder solved the issue. The aircraft's water-handling characteristics were found to be excellent; the only significant complaints that surfaced during the testing period concerned the XPTBH-2's beaching gear, which was found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>extremely</b> difficult to use in anything other than the calmest water.|$|E

5|$|For {{financial}} and scripting reasons the last book {{was divided into}} two films, shot back to back, which drew criticism from the series' fanbase. Radcliffe defended the split, stating {{that it would have}} been impossible to properly adapt the final novel into a single film. He added that the last movie was going <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>extremely</b> fast-paced with a lot of action, while the first part would be far more sedate, focusing on character development; he added that, had they combined them, those things would not have made it to the final cut. Filming lasted for a year, concluding in June 2010 and on the last day of shooting, like most of the cast and crew, Radcliffe openly wept.|$|E
5|$|Gannon {{has also}} been called a 'tactical maverick' due to his unusual {{formations}}. These formations include 3–4–1–2, 4–3–2–1, 4–1–2–3, and his preferred set-up of 4–2–3–1. He has stated that he prefers formations that use four lines of players (as opposed to three lines in the classic 4–4–2) due to the added depth in defence and presence in midfield, and was inspired to use the formations by Carlo Ancelotti. He has also stated that he prefers the 4–3–3 formation to the 4–4–2 formation, and has criticised the way he perceives 4–4–2 to be 'ingrained in the culture' of English football. He is known <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>extremely</b> thorough and meticulous in preparing his players for games.|$|E
5|$|Mason's {{successor}} Horner proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>extremely</b> unpopular {{as governor}} and his tenure was very short. Residents disliked {{him so much}} they burned him in effigy and pelted him with vegetables upon his entry into the territorial capital. In the October 1835 elections, voters approved the draft constitution and elected the popular Mason as state governor. The same election saw Isaac E. Crary chosen as Michigan's first U.S. Representative to Congress. Because of the dispute Congress refused to accept his credentials and seated him as a non-voting delegate. The two U.S. Senators chosen by the state legislature in November, Lucius Lyon and John Norvell, were treated with even less respect, being allowed to sit only as spectators in the Senate gallery.|$|E

5|$|The bristle-faced free-tailed bat appears <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>extremely</b> rare {{across its}} range. It has been {{detected}} at {{a limited number}} of localities and at these sites it appears to be uncommon, often comprising less than 2% of the bats captured during surveys. In NSW it has only been recorded at a small number of locations despite recent extensive surveys at over 300 sites in suitable habitat. Its preferred mode of foraging by flying at low levels along stream corridors suggests that the low numbers captured in surveys using mist nets and harp traps are an indication of rarity and are not an artifact of the survey methodology. Long-term monitoring of known populations is required to determine changes in population status of the bristle-faced free-tailed bat.|$|E

One controller was broken open on one side, and both were severely corroded and damaged by marine life. Both units were disassembled and the memory units flushed with deionized water. After they were dried and vacuum baked, data from these units was retrieved for forensic examination.|$|E
