5|$|Ireland {{are ranked}} 12th in One Day International (ODI) cricket. Ireland played their first ODI in 2006 against England. Since <b>then,</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> {{gone on to}} play 117ODIs, {{resulting}} in 51victories, 57defeats, 7no results, and 3ties. Contracts for players were introduced in 2009, marking the transition to becoming a professional team. Cricket Ireland is the sport's governing body in Ireland.|$|E
5|$|Keynsham Town F.C. {{were founded}} in 1895. They have played {{continuously}} {{apart from a}} break during World War II and moved to their current ground, the Crown Field, in 1945. They first played in the Bristol & District League and progressed through the Bristol Combination, Bristol Premier and Somerset Senior League and won the Somerset Senior Cup in 1951–52 and 1957–58. They were elected to the Western League in 1973 but were relegated three years later in 1976. Since <b>then</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> been promoted to the Premier Division three times and relegated three times. They won the Somerset Senior Cup {{for the third time}} in 2002–03 and reached the 5th round of the FA Vase in 2003–04. They currently play in the Western Football League Division 1.|$|E
5|$|Prey {{mobility}} {{could also}} explain the initial development of aposematic signaling. If prey have characteristics {{that make them}} more exposed to predators, such as when some dendrobatids shifted from nocturnal to diurnal behavior, <b>then</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> more reason to develop aposematism. After the switch, the frogs had greater ecological opportunities, causing dietary specialization to arise. Thus, aposematism {{is not merely a}} signaling system, but a way for organisms to gain greater access to resources and increase their reproductive success.|$|E

5|$|Their most {{successful}} moment came in 1998, when, {{against all the}} odds they defeated Wigan in the Challenge Cup final, despite being huge underdogs. The team then hit troubled times before reforming in 2003. Since <b>then</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> played their rugby in the Championship (second tier). In 2011, they made the playoffs finishing in fifth place. They made the Grand Final, by defeating Leigh, who were huge favourites in a playoff semi final. In the final, they were comprehensively beaten by Featherstone Rovers. Sheffield also put {{in a bid to}} be a host city for the 2013 Rugby League World Cup, but their bid was unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|This module {{starts in}} one of two ways. If the players have {{finished}} Steading of the Hill Giant Chief, they have been transported to the glacial rift via the magic chain. They will know that they are searching for some force behind the giant alliance. If the players are starting with Glacial Rift of the Frost Giant Jarl, <b>then</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> been hired by nobles to destroy the frost giants. Either way, a safe, hidden cave is easily found for a base of operations.|$|E
5|$|With {{their loss}} to Auburn, Alabama {{completed}} the first winless season in Alabama football history, and since <b>then</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> {{had only two}} other winless seasons in 1895 and 1955. The losses of 1893 were attributed to the small stature of the Crimson players {{and not to the}} coaching and training of the team. As such, Abbott returned as head coach for the 1894 season and led Alabama to a winning season that included their first all-time win over Auburn.|$|E

5|$|Born {{and raised}} in Los Angeles, California, Levine began his musical career in 1994, when he co-founded the {{alternative}} rock band Kara's Flowers, {{of which he was}} the lead vocalist and guitarist. The band split up after their only album, The Fourth World (released in 1997), which did not gain popularity. In 2001, the group was reformed – with guitarist James Valentine joining the line-up – and began a new musical chapter, changing their name to Maroon 5. In 2002, the band released their first album, Songs About Jane, which went multi-platinum in the US. Since <b>then,</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> released five more albums: It Won't Be Soon Before Long (2007), Hands All Over (2010), Overexposed (2012), V (2014) and Red Pill Blues (2017). As part of Maroon 5, Levine has received three Grammy Awards, two Billboard Music Awards, two American Music Awards, an MTV Video Music Award and a World Music Award.|$|E
5|$|Cornelis Suijk—a former {{director}} of the Anne Frank Foundation and president of the U.S. Center for Holocaust Education Foundation—announced in 1999 {{that he was in the}} possession of five pages that had been removed by Otto Frank from the diary prior to publication; Suijk claimed that Otto Frank gave these pages to him shortly before his death in 1980. The missing diary entries contain critical remarks by Anne Frank about her parents' strained marriage and discuss Frank's lack of affection for her mother. Some controversy ensued when Suijk claimed publishing rights over the five pages; he intended to sell them to raise money for his foundation. The Netherlands Institute for War Documentation, the formal owner of the manuscript, demanded the pages be handed over. In 2000 the Dutch Ministry of Education, Culture and Science agreed to donate US$300,000 to Suijk's foundation, and the pages were returned in 2001. Since <b>then,</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> been included in new editions of the diary.|$|E
5|$|Hull's first {{play-off}} campaign ended unsuccessfully, {{being beaten}} by Leyton Orient in the semi-final in the 2000–01 season. However, successive promotions in the 2003–04 and 2004–05 seasons saw Hull {{rise from the}} fourth tier to the second tier in a space of two years. After 104 years of existence, Hull were promoted to the Premier League {{for the first time}} in their history, beating Watford in the play-off semi-finals and Bristol City in the 2008 Football League Championship play-off Final. Hull's first Premier League season saw safety from relegation ensured on the last day of the season, although the club was relegated the following season after finishing 19th in the league. Three years later, Hull returned to the Premier League after finishing the 2012–13 season as Championship runners-up. In the 2013–14 season they achieved their highest ever league finish of 16th and were runners-up to Arsenal in their first ever FA Cup Final appearance. Since <b>then,</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> been relegated to the Championship and promoted again.|$|E

5|$|Since 2009, the {{intensity}} of the rivalry has waned as the duo's domination of the domestic game has decreased. This is partly due to the resurgence of North Belfast derby clubs, Cliftonville and Crusaders. In 2013, Cliftonville became the first club other than Linfield or Glentoran to lift the league title since Portadown did so in 2002. In 2014, Cliftonville went on to retain the title {{for the first time in}} the club's history, with Crusaders then winning the 2014–15 title in convincing fashion, finishing 10 points ahead of runners-up Linfield. During this time, Glentoran lifted the Irish Cup in 2013 and again in 2015, but their overall fortunes on the field have taken a relative downturn. The club has won only three league titles since the turn of the 21st century; in 2002–03, 2004–05 and 2008–09. Since <b>then,</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> finished as low as ninth place in the 2016–17 season. The last season in which the two clubs finished as champions and runners-up in either order was 2008–09, and they have not met in a major domestic cup final since 2006, when they contested both the Irish Cup and the League Cup finals.|$|E
5|$|Tammars {{from these}} areas were {{introduced}} to Kawau Island in New Zealand by colonial administrator Sir George Grey in 1870. Since <b>then,</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> flourished {{to the point where}} their foraging has damaged indigenous plants. Pest control operators have used sodium fluoroacetate, a naturally occurring rodenticide, to control their populations, a practice which has been controversial because of its possible effect on organisms not targeted, including humans. Cyanide pellets have been used as an alternative. In 1985, tammars {{were introduced to}} the North Island of the Houtman Abrolhos and have made similar impacts on native vegetation. Their numbers grew to 450 individuals, but by 2008 culling efforts appeared to have reduced their numbers to 25 individuals. In 2003, the Monarto Zoo temporarily housed 85 tammars from New Zealand awaiting reintroduction to the Innes National Park on the Yorke Peninsula in South Australia. Four releases have been made, and a stable wild population of 100–120 animals exists as of 2012. Tammars have also been successfully translocated to other areas, such as Nambung National Park and Avon Valley National Park in Western Australia.|$|E
5|$|Test cricket is {{the oldest}} form of cricket played at {{international}} level. A Test match takes place {{over a period of}} five days, and is played by teams representing Full Member nations of the International Cricket Council (ICC). Sri Lanka obtained Full Member status of the ICC in 1981, becoming the eighth nation eligible to play Test cricket. The Sri Lanka national cricket team played their first Test match on 17 February 1982 against England, and recorded their first victory in a match against India on 6 September 1985. Since <b>then,</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> played nearly 200 matches, against every other Test-playing nation. Sri Lanka holds the world record for the highest team score, which was established against India in 1997. The highest partnership in Test cricket was also established by two Sri Lankan batsmen; Mahela Jayawardene and Kumar Sangakkara. Sri Lankan players also hold the highest partnership scores for the second and third wickets.|$|E

5|$|The Liberty Head nickel was {{replaced}} after 1912, and initially {{there was no}} indication that 1913-dated pieces with that design existed. In December 1919, a coin dealer, Samuel W. Brown, placed advertisements in coin publications, offering to buy 1913 Liberty Head nickels. The following August, Brown appeared at the annual American Numismatic Association (ANA) convention bearing such a piece. Brown claimed that a master die had been prepared for 1913 and that these pieces had been run off to test it. As it turned out, Brown possessed five coins, which he eventually sold. After spending fifteen years {{in the hands of the}} eccentric Col. E.H.R. Green, the famous Fort Worth, Texas, area collector, the coins were finally dispersed in 1943. Since <b>then,</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> had several owners each. Today, two are on public display—at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington and the ANA's Money Museum in Colorado Springs, while three are owned privately. The most recent sale of a 1913 Liberty Head nickel was in January 2010, when one sold for $3,737,500 in an auction.|$|E
5|$|The Red Wings {{returned}} to the playoffs in 1984 where they suffered a first round defeat to the St. Louis Blues. In the 32 seasons since <b>then</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> made the playoffs 30 times, including 25 consecutive seasons from 1991 to 2016. They {{returned to}} the Finals {{for the first time}} since 1966 in 1995 where they were swept by the New Jersey Devils in four games. However, in 1997 they made it back to the Finals, winning the series in four straight games over the Philadelphia Flyers. They repeated as champions in the following season with a four-game sweep of the Washington Capitals. Their most recent championships were in 2002 and 2008, with their most recent Finals appearance in 2009 where they lost to the Pittsburgh Penguins.|$|E
