5|$|Each of {{the three}} narthex entrances sits below a <b>tympanum.</b> These 3 tympana were {{designed}} and sculpted by John Angel. The <b>tympanum</b> above the main, west entrance depicts Jesus {{as described in the}} Book of Revelation, together with the four beasts and other relevant iconography. It resembles the <b>tympanum</b> of the Royal Portal of Chartres Cathedral. Beneath the figure of Christ is Princeton University's shield, illustrating the university's motto, Dei sub numine viget ("Under the power of God she flourishes"). The tympana above the north and south entrances depict the Annunciation and the Baptism of Christ, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Temnospondyls {{and other}} early {{tetrapods}} have rounded otic notches {{in the back}} of the skull that project into the cheek region. In life, the otic notch would have been covered by a membrane called the <b>tympanum,</b> which is seen as a disk-like area in living frogs. The <b>tympanum</b> is involved in hearing, and is similar to the ear drum of more advanced tetrapods. It was traditionally thought that the <b>tympanum</b> developed very early in tetrapod evolution as a hearing organ and progressed to form the ear drum of amniotes. Thus, temnospondyls possessed a hearing system supposedly ancestral to that of living amphibians and reptiles.|$|E
5|$|The end bays of {{the west}} (main) facade are framed in pedimented pavilions, which have {{recessed}} brick panels above the impost line, and below it are bricks coursed to resemble rustication. One glazed roundel is at the middle of each <b>tympanum.</b> The pedimented central bay has an arched recessed entrance {{with a pair of}} oversized double wood doors beneath a fanlight. The arch is flanked with blind roundels above the impost line, with rustication below. The bay's <b>tympanum</b> is undecorated. The arch impost line continues as a belt course between the pavilions and forms the sills for recessed wood-framed, fixed-sashed, nine-light windows on the building's second level. The windows are divided by Doric pilasters.|$|E
50|$|Some of {{the choir}} chapel windows have used {{fragments}} of earlier windows in their <b>tympanums.</b>|$|R
50|$|It has two {{entrance}} {{doors in}} degradation with archivolts and historian <b>tympanums.</b> The archivolts are attached over eleven columns, three are of white marble (middle and corners) {{and the rest}} of granite. In the center are the figures of twelve prophets and the Apostles on the sideline. On the <b>tympanums</b> is a large frieze is separated from the upper body by a strip supported by grotesque corbels, on this floor are two windows that are decorated with Romanesque archivolts.|$|R

5|$|The manner {{with which}} van der Weyden {{presents}} {{the resurrection of}} the dead across the five lower panels is reminiscent of a Gothic <b>tympanum,</b> specifically that at Autun Cathedral. Rolin would have been familiar with the Autun Cathedral entrances, which may have motivated his decision to commission a Last Judgement for the hospice from van der Weyden.|$|E
5|$|The west front has {{two large}} {{flanking}} three-stage towers. On the rear outer {{corners of the}} towers are octagonal stair turrets with panels on the belfry stage. Between the towers is a deep entrance arch of six orders with decorative Purbeck Marble colonnettes and enriched mouldings to the arch. The <b>tympanum</b> of the arch contains an empty niche.|$|E
5|$|A creamy-white or {{pale yellow}} stripe, bordered above with gold and below with black, extends {{from behind the}} eye, across the {{typically}} copper-coloured <b>tympanum</b> to the groin. This stripe rises to form a dorsolateral fold towards the groin. Another stripe of the same colour begins below the eye and continues to the shoulder. The abdomen is cream or white, and has a coarsely granular texture. The legs are green, bronze, {{or a combination of}} both, and the inside thigh and groin are blue-green. Mature males develop a yellowish colouration to the vocal sacs on their throats. The <b>tympanum</b> is distinct and ovular in shape, and the species has enlarged toe discs to aid in climbing. As this species is often found in water, the fingers are free from webbing, while the toes are almost completely webbed. When in breeding condition, males develop nuptial pads on their thumbs, which are used to grip females during mating. These are coloured brown during the breeding season, but are inconspicuous and paler {{during the rest of the}} year. During the breeding season, females develop a blueish hue on their feet, while males' legs turn rusty orange.|$|E

5|$|Also {{attributable}} to Gasparo Cairano, and dated at this stage, is the singular St John the Baptist {{placed in the}} <b>tympanum</b> of the capitol of the eponymous Abbey in Parma. The work, undocumented and traditionally attributed by critics to Antonio Ferrari d'Agrate, was assigned in 2010 to the catalog {{of the works of}} Cairano due to obvious correlation with the mature art of the artist. This spread of Gasparo's artistic reach is significant and demonstrates that he could prove a success even outside of Brescia.|$|E
5|$|The church's {{appearance}} in the mid-16th century, shortly before its completion, is known from a woodcut by Girolamo Franzini. Its facade appears almost square; at its center there was a portal with a <b>tympanum,</b> surmounted by a large fanlight opened by a round window. On its side were three rows of pilasters with two pairs of niches, one over the other. A bell-gable was {{on one side of}} the roof.|$|E
5|$|The {{nineteenth century}} porch {{has a big}} ashlar triple-chamfered pointed arch, hoodmould and stone voussoirs. There is a boarded {{segmental}} pointed roof, stone side benches and a quarry tiles floor.

6000|$|As he spoke, a {{sound that}} has been {{described}} by ear-witnesses as [...] "deafening," [...] smote upon their <b>tympanums,</b> the log on which they sat quivered, the earth seemed to tremble, and several dishes in a neighbouring hut were thrown down and broken.|$|R
50|$|The Gothic {{period is}} {{essentially}} defined by Gothic architecture, {{and does not}} entirely fit {{with the development of}} style in sculpture in either its start or finish. The facades of large churches, especially around doors, continued to have large <b>tympanums,</b> but also rows of sculpted figures spreading around them.|$|R
5|$|Above {{the statue}} and framed by marble pilasters {{is a window}} that depicts scenes from Philadelphia history. In the window's <b>tympanum</b> is a {{depiction}} of Independence Hall. Below that are pictures showing William Penn's treaty with the Indians, George Washington's Farewell Address to Congress, the proclamation of the Declaration of Independence, the Philadelphia Convention, the drafting of the Declaration of Independence, Benjamin Franklin's printing office, Betsy Ross exhibiting the United States flag, and Caesar Rodney's ride from Delaware. The border of the window contains portrait busts of notable American Revolution-era Philadelphians: John Bartram, George Clymer, Robert Morris, David Rittenhouse, Benjamin Rush, and James Wilson.|$|E
5|$|By {{repeated}} scanning, bats can mentally {{construct an}} accurate {{image of the}} environment in which they are moving and of their prey item. However, some species of moth have exploited this, such as the tiger moths which produces aposematic ultrasound signals to warn bats that they are chemically protected. Other moth species can produce signals to jam bat echolocation. Many moth species have a hearing organ called a <b>tympanum,</b> which responds to an incoming bat signal by causing the moth's flight muscles to twitch erratically, sending the moth into random evasive maneuvers.|$|E
5|$|Frogs {{can hear}} {{both in the}} air and below water. They do not have {{external}} ears; the eardrums (tympanic membranes) are directly exposed or may be covered by a layer of skin and are visible as a circular area just behind the eye. The size and distance apart of the eardrums is related to the frequency and wavelength at which the frog calls. In some species such as the bullfrog, the size of the <b>tympanum</b> indicates the sex of the frog; males have tympani that are larger than their eyes while in females, the eyes and tympani are much the same size. A noise causes the <b>tympanum</b> to vibrate and the sound is transmitted to the middle and inner ear. The middle ear contains semicircular canals which help control balance and orientation. In the inner ear, the auditory hair cells are arranged in two areas of the cochlea, the basilar papilla and the amphibian papilla. The former detects high frequencies and the latter low frequencies. Because the cochlea is short, frogs use electrical tuning to extend their range of audible frequencies and help discriminate different sounds. This arrangement enables detection of the territorial and breeding calls of their conspecifics. In some species that inhabit arid regions, the sound of thunder or heavy rain may arouse them from a dormant state. A frog may be startled by an unexpected noise but it will not usually take any action until it has located the source of the sound by sight.|$|E
5000|$|Gislebertus, Giselbertus or Ghiselbertus, {{sometimes}} [...] "of Autun" [...] (flourished in the 12th century), was a French Romanesque sculptor, whose decoration (about 1120-1135) of the Cathedral of Saint Lazare at Autun, France - {{consisting of}} numerous doorways, <b>tympanums,</b> and capitals - represents {{some of the}} most original work of the period.|$|R

50|$|Early renaissance mansions {{were based}} on a {{rectangular}} design, with corner chambers (alkierze) and a porch. The roof was a Polish variant of the hip roof (:pl:Łamany dach polski) covered with shakes. In the baroque period, alkierze were replaced by risalits, and mansard roofs appeared. The Classicism period saw porches replaced by porticos with <b>tympanums.</b>|$|R
5|$|The early 18th {{century the}} central {{area around the}} Abbey was {{expanded}} including the Abbey Church Yard which contained Marshal Wade's House, and Trim Street, which was named after George Trim who owned the land. Number 5, which {{is also known as}} General Wolfe's house, is a 2-storey building with a parapet and rusticated quoins, built by Thomas Greenway. The doorway has Ionic pilasters and a <b>tympanum</b> decorated with the implements of war. In 1716 the architect William Killigrew was commissioned to rebuild St John's Hospital which was founded around 1180, by Bishop Reginald Fitz Jocelin and is among the oldest almshouses in England.|$|E
5|$|Tympanal organs {{or hearing}} organs {{consist of a}} {{membrane}} (<b>tympanum)</b> stretched across a frame backed by an air sac and associated sensory neurons, are found in two families. Several species of the genus Cicindela (Carabidae) have hearing organs on the dorsal surfaces of their first abdominal segments beneath the wings; two tribes in the Dynastinae (within the Scarabaeidae) have hearing organs just beneath their pronotal shields or neck membranes. Both families are sensitive to ultrasonic frequencies, with strong evidence indicating they function to detect the presence of bats by their ultrasonic echolocation.|$|E
5|$|The {{ability of}} the <b>tympanum</b> and stapes to {{effectively}} transmit vibrations is called impedance matching. Early tetrapods like temnospondyls have thick stapes with poor impedance matching, so it is now {{thought that they were}} not used for hearing. Instead, these thick stapes may have functioned to support the tissue that covers the otic notch. Early temnospondyls, like Dendrerpeton, could not hear airborne sound but {{would have been able to}} detect vibration in the ground. Later temnospondyls like Doleserpeton had otic regions adapted to hearing. Doleserpeton has a structure in the inner ear called the perilymphatic duct, which is also seen in frogs and is associated with hearing. Its stapes is also a better transmitter of sound. The hearing system of Doleserpeton and related temnospondyls was able to detect airborne sound and may have been ancestral to that of living amphibians.|$|E
5000|$|Truthful to his art, Józef Święcicki {{reproduced}} {{here the}} Neo-Baroque features he was fond of, {{as in other}} famous realisations across downtown (e.g. Hotel [...] "Pod Orlem", Plac Wolności 1, Theatre square 2).

5|$|The {{building}} comprises a compact, three-storey house, in the Dutch-classical style {{which was}} introduced into England by Sir Roger Pratt, and {{is typical of}} Bruce's work. The six-bay entrance front has a two-bay projecting central section, surmounted by a pediment topped by three pineapples, of which one remains. The <b>tympanum</b> is carved with the coat of arms of the Earl and his wife, with their initials (WEA and SCA for William, Earl of Annandale, and Sophia Countess of Annandale) and the date 1699. The roof behind was bell-cast, with a cupola and four tall chimneys symmetrically placed, although this was replaced in the 1950s. The centrally placed entrance is reached by steps, and surmounted by carved decorations. The garden front is similar, and is also topped by a decorated pediment. Once the house was complete, two wings connected by curved passages were added. These incorporated additional accommodation and a library, but the passages and south wing were later demolished.|$|E
5|$|His {{building}} projects were concentrated in Edinburgh, where, from 1637, {{he served as}} principal master mason to the city. For ten years {{he was involved in}} the construction of the Tron Kirk on the High Street, which opened in 1647. The Tron was built to house the congregation of St Giles', which had been raised to cathedral status, and was laid out in the new T-plan form with the pulpit in the centre, to suit reformed worship. The design was informed by contemporary Dutch architecture and, in particular, by the work of Hendrick de Keyser whose Architectura Moderna showcased his church designs in the Netherlands. Mylne worked on the building with master wright John Scott who was responsible for the timber work. The building was executed in a Dutch influenced style with both gothic and classical details. The church was not fully complete before Mylne's death and was subsequently remodelled in the 18th century. A new spire was added in the 19th century following a fire, but Mylne's work can be seen in the body of the kirk. The carved <b>tympanum</b> was executed by Mylne's brother Alexander.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the more}} modern buildings, {{including}} Senate House and the newer parts of the HH Wills Physics Laboratory, were designed by Ralph Brentnall after funds from the University Grants Committee. He is also responsible for the extension to the Wills Memorial Building library which was completed to such standard that few now realise that is an extension to the original building. Brentnall oversaw the rebuilding of the Great Hall of the Wills Memorial Building after it was partly destroyed during the Bristol Blitz of World War II. The buildings of St Michael's Hill were rebuilt using hundreds of old photographs to recreate the original houses. The flats at Goldney Hall were designed by Michael Grice and received an award from the Civic Trust for their design. Bristol University owns {{some of the best}} examples of Georgian architecture in the city, the best examples being Royal Fort House, Clifton Hill House and Goldney Hall despite some additions. The Victoria Rooms which house the Music Department were designed by Charles Dyer and is seen as a good example of a Greek revival movement in British architecture. The <b>tympanum</b> of the building depicts a scene from The Advent of Morning designed by Jabez Tyley. Its major feature was a large organ which has since been destroyed by fire.|$|E
50|$|The front facade was rebuilt in 1891 {{after the}} {{original}} one collapsed. It is of striped marble and stone with open arches that have lace detailing not commonly found in Italian sacred architecture while the tiled cupola is quite common amongst churches of the area. The <b>tympanum's</b> mosaics portray “The triumph of Christ” in a work created by Domenico Morelli and whose original designs are retained in the Town Hall.|$|R
