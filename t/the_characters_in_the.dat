5|$|Chakrapani {{decided to}} retain only the {{background}} of Gundamma's family from the original and rewrote the remaining script, taking inspiration from William Shakespeare comedy, The Taming of the Shrew.

Kamalakara Kameswara Rao was chosen to direct the film. Chakrapani named the central character Gundamma in the remake after one of <b>the</b> <b>characters</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> original, {{despite a lack of}} nativity.
