50|$|Leonarda was {{a highly}} {{regarded}} composer in her home city, but her music was apparently little known {{in other parts of}} Italy. Her published compositions span a period of 60 years, beginning with the dialogues of 1640 and concluding with the Motetti a voce sola of 1700. Leonarda is credited with producing nearly two hundred compositions during that period, though her only works appearing before 1670 were the dialogues printed by Gasparo Casati. It appears that she was over the age of 50 before she started composing regularly, and it was at that time that she began publishing <b>the</b> <b>works</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> know her for today.|$|R

[...] However, in recent centuries {{and up to the}} present, a concerto is a piece usually composed in three parts or movements, in which (usually) one solo instrument (for instance, a piano, violin, cello or flute) is accompanied by an orchestra or concert band.|$|R

You would never {{understand}} how and why we prop our roofs with those piles of sleepers. Anyway, you can see that we cannot take out a whole line of pillars. We work 'em en echelon, and those big beams you see running from floor to roof are our indicators. They show when the roof is going to give. Oh! dear no, there's no dramatic effect about it. No splash, you know. Our roofs give plenty of warning by cracking and then collapse slowly.

As nature, {{even where}} grace is, cannot, without the {{assistance}} of that grace, do anything acceptably before God; so grace received, if it be not also supplied with more grace, cannot cause {{that we continue to}} do acceptable service to God. This also is clear by the text, For he speaketh there to them that had received grace; yea, puts himself into the number, saying, 'Let us come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may find grace to help in time of need.' If grace received would do, what need for more? What need we pray for more? What need we go to the throne of grace for more? This very exhortation saith it will not: present supplies of grace are proportioned to our present need, and to help us to do a present work or duty.[38] But is our present need all the need that we are like to have, and the present work all <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> have to do in the world? Even so the grace that we have received at present, though it can help us to do a present work, it cannot, without a further supply, help us to do {{what is to be done}} hereafter. Wherefore, the apostle saith, that his continuing to do was through his obtaining help, continual help of God: 'Having, therefore,' saith he, 'obtained help of God, I continue unto this day witnessing both to small and great,' &c. (Acts 26:22). There must be a daily imploring of God for daily supplies from him, if we will do our daily business as we should.|$|E

It will be initially presented the historical context preceding the period in question, known as Late Antiquity.

In addition, Latin American philology is {{to be understood as}} having a scope that includes, beside linguistics, also ethnography, cultural history, studies of literature, and criticism of literary texts. The literary and cultural studies are concerned with local subjects of their one country, preferably of modern times, as are <b>the</b> <b>works</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> can consider linguistic.
