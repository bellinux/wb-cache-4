5|$|Common ravens {{are known}} to steal and cache shiny objects such as pebbles, pieces of metal, and golf balls. One theory is that they hoard shiny objects to impress other ravens. Other {{research}} indicates that juveniles are deeply curious about all new things, and <b>that</b> <b>common</b> ravens retain an attraction to bright, round objects based on their similarity to bird eggs. Mature birds lose their intense interest in the unusual, and become highly neophobic.|$|E
5|$|Common ravens {{have been}} {{observed}} calling wolves {{to the site of}} dead animals. The wolves open the carcass, leaving the scraps more accessible to the birds. They watch where other common ravens bury their food and remember the locations of each other's food caches, so they can steal from them. This type of theft occurs so regularly <b>that</b> <b>common</b> ravens will fly extra distances from a food source to find better hiding places for food. They have also been observed pretending to make a cache without actually depositing the food, presumably to confuse onlookers.|$|E
5|$|One {{explanation}} for these genetic findings is <b>that</b> <b>common</b> ravens settled in California {{at least two}} million years ago and became separated from their relatives in Europe and Asia during an ice age. One million years ago, a group from the California clade evolved into a new species, the Chihuahuan raven. Other members of the Holarctic clade arrived later in a separate migration from Asia, perhaps {{at the same time}} as humans.|$|E

5|$|The {{findings}} indicate that based on mitochondrial DNA, common ravens {{from the rest of}} the United States are more closely related to those in Europe and Asia than to those in the California clade, and <b>that</b> <b>common</b> ravens in the California clade are more closely related to the Chihuahuan raven (C. cryptoleucus) than to those in the Holarctic clade. Ravens in the Holarctic clade are more closely related to the pied crow (C. albus) than they are to the California clade. Thus, the common raven species as traditionally delimited is considered to be paraphyletic.|$|E
5|$|Common ravens can {{thrive in}} varied climates; indeed this species {{has the largest}} range of {{any member of the}} genus, and one of the largest of any passerine. They range {{throughout}} the Holarctic from Arctic and temperate habitats in North America and Eurasia to the deserts of North Africa, and to islands in the Pacific Ocean. In the British Isles, they are more common in Scotland, Wales, northern England and the west of Ireland. In Tibet, they have been recorded at altitudes up to 5,000m (16,400ft), and as high as 6,350m (20,600ft) on Mount Everest. The population sometimes known as the Punjab raven—described as Corvus corax laurencei (also spelt lawrencii or laurencii) by Allan Octavian Hume but more often considered synonymous with subcorax—is restricted to the Sindh district of Pakistan and adjoining regions of northwestern India. They are generally resident within their range for the whole year. In his 1950 work, Grønlands Fugle , noted ornithologist Finn Salomonsen indicated <b>that</b> <b>common</b> ravens did not overwinter in the Arctic. However, in Arctic Canada and Alaska, they are found year-round. Young birds may disperse locally.|$|E
5|$|Eliminativism about a {{class of}} {{entities}} is the view that that class of entities does not exist. For example, materialism tends to be eliminativist about the soul; modern chemists are eliminativist about phlogiston; and modern physicists are eliminativist {{about the existence of}} luminiferous aether. Eliminative materialism is the relatively new (1960s–1970s) idea that certain classes of mental entities <b>that</b> <b>common</b> sense takes for granted, such as beliefs, desires, and the subjective sensation of pain, do not exist. The most common versions are eliminativism about propositional attitudes, as expressed by Paul and Patricia Churchland,and eliminativism about qualia (subjective interpretations about particular instances of subjective experience), as expressed by Daniel Dennett and Georges Rey. These philosophers often appeal to an introspection illusion.|$|E

5|$|Genetic {{evidence}} suggests <b>that</b> <b>common</b> hippos in Africa experienced a marked population expansion {{during or after}} the Pleistocene, attributed {{to an increase in}} water bodies {{at the end of the}} era. These findings have important conservation implications as hippo populations across the continent are currently threatened by loss of access to fresh water. Hippos are also subject to unregulated hunting and poaching. In May 2006, the hippopotamus was identified as a vulnerable species on the IUCN Red List drawn up by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), with an estimated population of between 125,000 and 150,000 hippos, a decline of between 7% and 20% since the IUCN's 1996 study. Zambia (40,000) and Tanzania (20,000–30,000) possess the largest populations.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to these preventable issues, GWA studies have attracted more fundamental criticism, mainly because of their assumption <b>that</b> <b>common</b> genetic variation plays {{a large role in}} explaining the heritable variation of common disease. This aspect of GWA studies has attracted the criticism that, although it could not have been known prospectively, GWA studies were ultimately not worth the expenditure. Alternative strategies suggested involve linkage analysis. More recently, the rapidly decreasing price of complete genome sequencing have also provided a realistic alternative to genotyping array-based GWA studies. It can be discussed if the use of this new technique is still referred to as a GWA study, but high-throughput sequencing does have potential to side-step some of the shortcomings of non-sequencing GWA.|$|E
5|$|Investigators {{initially}} {{assumed that}} the arsenic used to poison the victims had come from rat poison, but when common adulterants used in rat poison {{failed to show up}} in autopsies, they were forced {{to come up with a}} new theory. It was unlikely that the illiterate sisters would have been able to acquire arsenic through the usual method of visiting a chemist, a route more open to doctors than spinsters. Eventually it was discovered <b>that</b> <b>common</b> flypaper at the time contained arsenic, and that by soaking the flypaper in water, a solution substantially identical – including the same adulterants – to that found in a bottle at the Higgins residence could be obtained.|$|E

5|$|The Serjeants only enjoyed their {{returned}} {{status for}} another six years, however, before Parliament intervened. The Practitioners in Common Pleas Act 1846, from 18 August 1846, allowed all barristers {{to practice in}} the Court of Common Pleas. The next and final blow was the Judicature Act 1873, which came into force on 1 November 1875. Section 8 provided <b>that</b> <b>common</b> law judges need no longer be appointed from the Serjeants-at-Law, removing the need to appoint judicial Serjeants. With this Act {{and the rise of}} the Queen's Counsel, there was no longer any need to appoint Serjeants, and the practice ended.|$|E
5|$|The common {{starling}} {{was introduced}} to Australia to consume insect pests of farm crops. Early settlers looked forward to their arrival, believing <b>that</b> <b>common</b> starlings were also important for the pollination of flax, a major agricultural product. Nest-boxes for the newly released birds were placed on farms and near crops. The common starling {{was introduced to}} Melbourne in 1857 and Sydney two decades later. By the 1880s, established populations {{were present in the}} southeast of the country thanks to the work of acclimatisation committees. By the 1920s, common starlings were widespread throughout Victoria, Queensland and New South Wales, but by then they were considered to be pests. Although common starlings were first sighted in Albany, Western Australia in 1917, they have been largely prevented from spreading to the state. The wide and arid Nullarbor Plain provides a natural barrier and control measures have been adopted that have killed 55,000 birds over three decades. The common starling has also colonised Lord Howe Island and Norfolk Island.|$|E
5|$|Vampire bats use {{infrared}} radiation to locate blood hotspots on their prey. A recent study has shown <b>that</b> <b>common</b> vampire bats tune a TRP-channel {{that is already}} heat-sensitive, TRPV1, by lowering its thermal activation threshold to about 30°C. This is achieved through alternative splicing of TRPV1 transcripts to produce a channel with a truncated carboxy-terminal cytoplasmic domain. These splicing events occur exclusively in trigeminal ganglia, and not in dorsal root ganglia, thereby maintaining a role for TRPV1 as a detector of noxious heat in somatic afferents. The only other vertebrates capable of detecting {{infrared radiation}} are boas, pythons and pit vipers, {{all of which have}} pit organs.|$|E

5|$|The pied currawong's {{impact on}} smaller birds that are {{vulnerable}} to nest predation is controversial: several {{studies have suggested that}} the species has become a serious problem, but the truth of this widely held perception was queried in a 2001 review of the published literature on their foraging habits by Bayly and Blumstein of Macquarie University, who observed <b>that</b> <b>common</b> introduced birds were more affected than native birds. However, predation by pied currawongs has been a factor in the decline of Gould's petrel at a colony on Cabbage Tree Island, near Port Stephens in New South Wales; currawongs have been reported preying on adult seabirds. Their removal from the islands halted a decline of the threatened petrels. Furthermore, a University of New England study published in 2006 reported that the breeding success rates for the eastern yellow robin (Eopsaltria australis) and scarlet robin (Petroica boodang) on the New England Tablelands were improved after nests were protected and currawongs culled, and some yellow robins even re-colonised an area where they had become locally extinct. The presence of pied currawongs in Sydney gardens is negatively correlated with the presence of silvereyes (Zosterops lateralis).|$|E
