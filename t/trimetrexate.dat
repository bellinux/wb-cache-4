In this study, mouse cells transfected to express a green fluorescent protein-DHFR fusion protein and subsequently exposed to the antifolate <b>trimetrexate</b> (TMTX) showed a specific and time-dependent increase in cellular levels of the fusion protein. Next, human HCT- 8 and HCT- 116 colon cancer cells retrovirally transduced to express a DHFR-herpes simplex virus 1 thymidine kinase (HSV 1 TK) fusion protein and treated with the DHFR inhibitor TMTX exhibited increased levels of the DHFR-HSV 1 TK fusion protein and an increase in ganciclovir sensitivity by 250 -fold. The level of fusion protein in antifolate-treated human tumor cells was increased in response to a 24 -h exposure of methotrexate, <b>trimetrexate,</b> as well as dihydrofolate. This effect depended on the antifolate concentration and was independent of the fusion-protein mRNA levels, consistent with this increase occurring at a translational level.

The development of <b>trimetrexate</b> (TMTX), a nonclassical 2, 4 -diaminoquinazoline antifolate, represents one of the more recent attempts to exploit this important mechanism of action clinically. Clinical studies with TMTX were approached with grea...|$|E
40|$|Eighteen quinoxalines {{bearing a}} methyleneanilino or methyleneaminobenzoylglutamate group on {{position}} 6 {{of the ring}} and various lipophilic substituents on positions 2 and 3 were prepared in order to discover if their structural analogy with both <b>trimetrexate</b> (TMQ) and 10 -propargyl- 5, 8 -dideazafolic acid (CB 3717) might display in vitro anticancer activity. Among these, 12 compounds were selected at the National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD, USA; they exhibited moderate (4 b,d,i,l,m and 8) to strong (4 f,h and 5 a,e) cell-growth inhibition at a concentration of 10 − 4 M. Interesting selectivities were also recorded between 10 − 8 and 10 − 6 M. These analogues proved to be less potent inihibitors of tumor cells than other classical and non-classical antifolate analogues previously described by us...|$|E
40|$|Currently, {{low levels}} of stable gene {{transfer}} into hematopoietic tissues of large animals and humans continues to limit the clinical application of gene therapy. One strategy for overcom-ing this problem is to selectively expand, in vivo, the population of successfully gene-modified cells. Recent work has shown that nucleoside transport inhibition in combination with antifo-lates {{can be used to}} select in vivo for hematopoietic stem cells expressing drug-resistant dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). In this study we investigated whether <b>trimetrexate</b> (TMTX) and the nucleoside transport inhibitor prodrug nitrobenzylmercaptopu-rine ribose phosphate (NBMPR-P) can be used to select for tyr 22 -variant DHFR expressing transgenic hematopoietic cells in a murine bone marrow transplant model. Our results indicate that 40 mg/kg TMTX and 20 mg/kg NBMPR-P can be used i...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The primary {{objective}} {{of this article is}} to introduce readers to the use of a new agent, <b>trimetrexate</b> (TMTX), in the treatment of Pneumocystis cariniipneumonia (PCP). The article also gives the readers an overview of PCP and discusses some of the controversies swrounding it. Phannacokinetic data and clinical trials are reviewed, as well as adverse effects, drug interactions, and dosage guidelines. DATA SOURCES: A MEDLINE search was used to identify pertinent literature, including reviews. srunv SELECIlON: As both phannacokinetic and clinical trials were few in number, all available trials were reviewed. DATA EXTRACTION: Phannacokinetic data from trials involving patients with AIDS was sparse; therefore, those involving oncology patients, including a pediatric population, were included. Although more trials need to be done in AIDS patients, the results from th...|$|E
40|$|In {{patients}} with AIDS, toxoplasmosis {{is the most}} common cause of CNS mass lesions. Diagnosis is made on the basis of clinical presentation and CAT scan findings and confirmed by demonstration of tachyzoites and/or cysts in tissues obtained by needle aspiration or brain biopsy. Response to therapy with pyrimethamine and sulphadiazine is usually prompt but therapy has to be continued for the lifetime of AIDS {{patients with}} CNS toxoplasmosis. To date, no alternative regimens of single or combination drugs appear to be effective in patients who fail, or are unable to tolerate pyrimethamine and sulphadiazine therapy. Relapse rate is high. Clearly, there is a need to organize prospective controlled studies to assess the role of agents such as clindamycin, <b>trimetrexate</b> and other drugs in the treatment of CNS toxoplasmosis in patients with AIDS...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the uptake and {{metabolism}} of 5 -fluorouracil (5 -FU) in human liver metastases. Patients with liver metastases of colorectal cancer were treated with 5 -FU (500 / 600 mg/m) +folinic acid with or without <b>trimetrexate.</b> The clinical application of F-magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) of 5 -FU in a random group of patients (n= 17) was investigated. MR spectra of all patients showed 5 -FU and catabolite resonances, and fluoronucleotides were also seen in seven patients. A correlation was found between maximum levels of 5 -FU catabolites as measured by F-MRS and response in a group with larger metastases. However, such correlation was not observed in a group with smaller metastases, probably because of a significant contribution of normal liver tissue to the MR spectra...|$|E
40|$|Efforts to use fresh human sarcoma {{cells for}} {{evaluating}} antifolate resistance with an in situ thymidylate synthesis assay using 5 -['H] deoxyuridine were unsuccessful {{because of low}} thymidylate synthesis activity in enzymatically disaggregated tumors. By incubating tumor cell suspensions in supplemented RPMI- 1640 medium with 10 % fetal bovine serum for 3 days, activity of the in situ thymidylate synthesis assay markedly increased (1. 42 versus 0. 03 pmol/h/ 107 cells), thus allowing 75 % of samples to be evaluated for antifolate sensitivity. By criteria developed with a methotrexate-resistant and-sensitive cell line, this assay indicated that most sarcomas are naturally resistant to methotrexate (12 of 15). Natural resistance to 10 -ethyl-lO-deazaaminopterin and <b>trimetrexate</b> was also observed in 60 % of the samples (nine of 15, respectively). The results from the 3 -day in situ assay were confirmed by specific tests for resistance mechanisms in most sarcoma samples. Th...|$|E
40|$|A {{prerequisite}} for the prolonged infusion {{of a drug}} via a totally implanted drug delivery system is that the drug solution must be sufficiently stable at physiological temperatures to endure the time intervals between drug replacement or pump refills. Consequently, {{the stability of the}} chemotherapeutic agents can influence the dosing accuracy and ultimately the achievement of the desired therapeutic goal. The chemical stability of the pharmaceutical preparation <b>Trimetrexate</b> (TMQ) glucuronate, a non-classical, lipophilic antifolate, has been characterized. Incubation of TMQ (prepared in sterile water to a concentration of 5. 0 mg/ml) in sterile, amber glass vials at 37 [deg]C for 56 days resulted in a degradation rate constant of 0. 0134 +/- 0. 002 day- 1 and a half-life of 51. 6 +/- 0. 8 days. The major degradation product has been identified as (2, 4 -diamino- 5 -methyl- 6 -carboxyaldehyde) quinazoline. Ten percent TMQ degradation would occur by 7. 9 days of incubation under these conditions...|$|E
40|$|Osteosarcoma {{does not}} respond well to {{conventional}} dose methotrexate but does respond to high-dose methotrexate. Previous work has indicated that this resistance {{may be due to}} impaired transport of methotrexate across the cell membrane. In this study, the PT 430 competitive displacement assay was adapted to evaluate methotrexate transport in 69 high-grade osteosarcoma tumor samples. All samples studied were shown to have relatively impaired methotrexate transport by PT 430 assay. Ninety-nine percent of the samples had less than 20 % PT 430 displacement by methotrexate. Eighty-eight percent exhibited displacement by methotrexate at less than 50 % of the displacement by <b>trimetrexate.</b> The high frequency of impaired transport suggests the presence of decreased functionality of the reduced folate carrier protein. The overwhelming presence of impaired transport may explain why methotrexate needs to be given in high doses to be effective in osteosarcoma therapy and suggests that reduced folate carrier-independent antifolates should be explored...|$|E
