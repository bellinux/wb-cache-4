5|$|Belief that Cooper did {{not survive}} was bolstered {{by the fact that}} none of the money has ever been used. A {{quantity}} was found under riverbank silt, but its location is not consistent with Cooper dying or losing <b>the</b> <b>ransom</b> in the jump. This, combined with the knowledge that with law enforcement involved, a ransom would in effect be 100% bait money (a fact known to the public since the trial following the Lindbergh kidnapping) makes it less likely that Cooper had any intention of actually using <b>the</b> <b>ransom</b> money. A minority opinion is that a North American of Cooper's apparent sophistication could hardly have expected to spend or fence currency as hot as <b>the</b> <b>ransom</b> would predictably be, and he had carried out a planned dumping of the money before disappearing.|$|E
5|$|In addition, <b>The</b> <b>Ransom</b> of Mercy Carter by Caroline B. Cooney, a {{historical}} fiction novel, commemorates this event {{through the eyes}} of a young Deerfield girl.|$|E
5|$|In early 1973, with <b>the</b> <b>ransom</b> money still missing, The Oregon Journal republished {{the serial}} numbers and offered $1,000 {{to the first}} person to turn in a ransom bill to the {{newspaper}} or any FBI field office. In Seattle, the Post-Intelligencer made a similar offer with a $5,000 reward. The offers remained in effect until Thanksgiving 1974, and though there were several near-matches, no genuine bills were found. In 1975 Northwest Orient's insurer, Global Indemnity Co., complied with an order from the Minnesota Supreme Court and paid the airline's $180,000 claim on <b>the</b> <b>ransom</b> money.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Barfi's father falls ill and Barfi must somehow {{raise the}} money for his treatment. After an {{unsuccessful}} attempt to rob a local bank, he tries to kidnap Jhilmil Chatterjee (Priyanka Chopra)Barfi's autistic childhood friend and wealthy heiress of her grandfather's fortunefor a ransom. Upon arriving, Barfi finds she has already been kidnapped. He sees her in a van, sneaks inside and drives Jhilmil away from <b>the</b> <b>ransom</b> delivery. He hides her in his apartment with the police in pursuit. Barfi collects <b>the</b> <b>ransom</b> but finds that his father has died just as he makes the payment. Dejected, Barfi tries to leave Jhilmil at the village of her caretaker, but she refuses to leave him and they soon move to Kolkata, where Barfi assumes responsibility for Jhilmil and takes care of her.|$|E
5|$|A new {{alignment}} of M-99 highway was opened from <b>the</b> <b>Ransom</b> area north to Osseo in 1966; the western terminus of M-34 was scaled back to {{end at the}} new highway near Osseo and M-99 supplanted M-34 from Osseo to Hillsdale. The divided highway section of M-99 was opened north of Eaton Rapids in 1979.|$|E
5|$|Martin McNally, an {{unemployed}} service-station attendant, used a submachine gun in late June to commandeer an American Airlines 727 {{en route from}} St. Louis to Tulsa, then diverted it eastward to Indiana and bailed out with $500,000 in ransom. McNally lost <b>the</b> <b>ransom</b> money as he exited the aircraft, but landed safely near Peru, Indiana, and was apprehended {{a few days later}} in a Detroit suburb.|$|E

5|$|On June 27, 2017, {{a heavily}} {{modified}} version of Petya was used for a global cyberattack primarily targeting Ukraine. This version had been modified to propagate using the same EternalBlue exploit that was used by WannaCry. Due to another design change, it is also unable to actually unlock a system after <b>the</b> <b>ransom</b> is paid; this led to security analysts speculating that the attack {{was not meant to}} generate illicit profit, but to simply cause disruption.|$|E
5|$|Albany died in 1420, and Doune, the dukedom of Albany, and the Regency all {{passed to}} his son Murdoch (1362–1425). <b>The</b> <b>ransom</b> for James I was finally paid to the English, and the King {{returned}} in 1424, taking immediate steps {{to gain control of}} his kingdom. Albany and two of his sons were imprisoned for treason, and then executed in May 1425. Doune Castle became a royal possession, under an appointed Captain, or Keeper, and served as a retreat and hunting lodge for the Scottish monarchs. It was also used as a dower house by Mary of Guelders (c.1434–1463), Margaret of Denmark (1456–1486), and Margaret Tudor (1489–1541), the widowed consorts of James II, James III and James IV respectively.|$|E
5|$|Artemis {{is finally}} granted <b>the</b> <b>ransom.</b> The gold is sent in, and Artemis asks Holly for a wish: to cure his mother's insanity— {{she has been}} living in her bedroom, driven mad by the loss of her husband. Holly grants the wish at the cost of half the gold. The LEP decides to send in a 'blue rinse' – a {{biological}} bomb that kills all organic life— to eliminate Artemis and allow for the retrieval of the gold, but this fails when Artemis escapes the time-stop by drugging himself and his comrades with sleeping pills.|$|E

50|$|He and Balian had organised, {{and contributed}} to, a {{collection}} of 30,000 bezants to <b>ransom</b> <b>the</b> poorer citizens. This paid <b>the</b> <b>ransoms</b> for about 18,000 people, but another 15,000 people still needed to be paid for. Heraclius and Balian offered themselves as hostages in exchange for them, but Saladin refused, and so these remaining citizens were enslaved. The two men led the last party of refugees from the city {{at the end of}} <b>the</b> 40-day <b>ransom</b> period (mid-late November).|$|R
5|$|Bond and Leiter {{alert the}} Thunderball war room of their suspicions of Largo {{and join the}} crew of the American nuclear {{submarine}} Manta as <b>the</b> <b>ransom</b> deadline nears. The Manta chases the Disco Volante to capture it and recover the bombs en route to the first target. An undersea battle ensues between the crews, while Bond fights Largo. Bond, now very weak from his efforts to disable the bombs, tries to get away, but Largo corners him in an underwater cave and easily overpowers him. Before Largo can finish Bond off Domino shoots him with a spear gun. The bombs are recovered and Bond is sent to hospital with Domino.|$|E
5|$|Days later, Lebowski {{contacts}} the Dude {{stating that}} Bunny has been kidnapped. Lebowski wants the Dude {{to deliver a}} briefcase containing a million-dollar ransom {{and see if he}} can recognize the culprits. Later, a different pair of thugs appear in the Dude's apartment, knock him unconscious, and take Lebowski's rug. When Bunny's kidnappers call to arrange delivery of <b>the</b> <b>ransom,</b> Walter instead gives the kidnappers a fake ransom, namely, a briefcase filled with dirty underwear. The kidnappers grab the fake ransom and leave. Later that night, the Dude's car is stolen, with the real ransom money briefcase still inside.|$|E
5|$|In early November 1822, the {{schooner}} USS Alligator, {{under the}} command of Lieutenant Allen, put into Matanzas, Cuba, intending to patrol the area as part of the United States Navy's West Indian Anti-Piracy Campaign. Upon arriving at the port, Allen discovered two Americans attempting to raise $7,000 in order to pay a ransom to a band of pirates that had captured their vessels. If <b>the</b> <b>ransom</b> was not delivered, the pirates threatened to destroy the ships and rough up their crews. Learning from these men that the pirates were holed up some 15 leagues away, Allen took the civilians aboard and decided to make an attempt at recovering their ship from the buccaneers.|$|E

5|$|In late 1971 the FBI {{distributed}} {{lists of}} <b>the</b> <b>ransom</b> serial numbers to financial institutions, casinos, race tracks, {{and other businesses}} that routinely conducted significant cash transactions, and to law enforcement agencies around the world. Northwest Orient offered a reward of 15% of the recovered money, {{to a maximum of}} $25,000. In early 1972 U.S. Attorney General John Mitchell released the serial numbers to the general public. In 1972 two men used counterfeit 20-dollar bills printed with Cooper serial numbers to swindle $30,000 from a Newsweek reporter named Karl Fleming in exchange for an interview with a man they falsely claimed was the hijacker.|$|E
5|$|In the {{following}} years Pembroke {{worked closely with the}} King. He was appointed the King’s lieutenant in Scotland in 1314, and was present at the disastrous English defeat at the Battle of Bannockburn, where he helped lead Edward away from the field of battle. In 1317, however, while returning from a papal embassy to Avignon, he was captured by a Jean de Lamouilly, and held for ransom in Germany. <b>The</b> <b>ransom</b> of £10,400 was to cause Pembroke significant financial difficulties for the remainder of his life.|$|E
5|$|On July 8, 2016, the FBI {{announced}} that it was suspending active investigation of the Cooper case, citing a need to focus its investigative resources and manpower on issues of higher and more urgent priority. Local field offices will continue to accept any legitimate physical evidence—related specifically to the parachutes or <b>the</b> <b>ransom</b> money—that may emerge in the future. The 60-volume case file compiled over the 45-year course of the investigation will be preserved for historical purposes at FBI headquarters in Washington, D.C.|$|E

5|$|Petya {{was first}} {{discovered}} in March 2016; unlike {{other forms of}} encrypting ransomware, the malware aimed to infect the master boot record, installing a payload which encrypts the file tables of the NTFS file system the next time that the infected system boots, blocking the system from booting into Windows at all until <b>the</b> <b>ransom</b> is paid. Check Point reported that despite what it believed to be an innovative evolution in ransomware design, it had resulted in relatively-fewer infections than other ransomware active {{around the same time}} frame.|$|E
5|$|Roupen III of Armenian Cilicia laid siege to Lampron, {{the seat}} of his rival, Hethum III of Lampron. Hethum sent envoys to Bohemond, seeking his assistance. Bohemond invited Roupen to a banquet to Antioch where he had Roupen {{captured}} and imprisoned in 1185. Bohemond invaded Cilicia, but he could not prevent Roupen's brother, Leo, from seizing Lampron. An Armenian nobleman, Pagouran of Barbaron, medieted a peace treaty. Roupen agreed to pay a ransom and to renounce Sarventikar, Tall Hamdun, Mamistra, and Adana. He also acknowledged Bohemond's suzerainty. After <b>the</b> <b>ransom</b> was paid in 1186, Bohemond released Roupen, who soon reconquered the fortresses and towns that he had ceded to Antioch.|$|E
5|$|The Dude's car {{is found}} by the police without <b>the</b> <b>ransom</b> money, and he reclaims it. Later, while {{cruising}} around in the car, The Dude finds the homework assignment {{of a high school}} student named Larry inside. Taking this to mean that Larry was the one who stole the car, Walter and The Dude go to his house, believing Larry has also stolen the money. When Larry refuses to respond to Walter and the Dude's threats, Walter wrecks a new sports car parked outside which they assume Larry bought with the money. However, a neighbor rushes outside, reveals himself as having just bought the car and angrily wrecks The Dude's car in revenge, thinking it to be Walter's.|$|E
