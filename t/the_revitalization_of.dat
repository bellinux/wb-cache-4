5|$|After the war, Kappa Kappa Psi {{began an}} ambitious {{expansion}} program to reactivate old chapters and install new ones.

District governors were charged with giving information to potential chapters. The expansion program was quite successful—in the ten years following the fraternity's reorganization in 1947, Kappa Kappa Psi more than doubled the number of installed chapters, growing from 45 chapters installed before the war to 98 {{by the end of}} 1957.|$|E

5|$|The Bay Area hosts an {{extensive}} freeway and highway {{system that is}} particularly prone to traffic congestion, with one study by Inrix concluding that the Bay Area's traffic was the fourth worst in the world. There are some city streets in San Francisco where gaps occur in the freeway system, partly {{the result of the}} Freeway Revolt, which prevented a freeway-only thoroughfare through San Francisco between the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge, the western terminus of Interstate 80, and the southern terminus of the Golden Gate Bridge (U.S. Route 101). Additional damage that occurred {{in the wake of the}} 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake resulted in freeway segments being removed instead of being reinforced or rebuilt, leading to <b>the</b> <b>revitalization</b> <b>of</b> neighborhoods such as San Francisco's Embarcadero. The greater Bay Area contains the three principal north-south highways in California: Interstate 5, U.S. Route 101, and California State Route 1. U.S. 101 and State Route 1 directly serve the traditional nine-county region, while Interstate 5 bypasses to the east in San Joaquin County to provide a more direct Los Angeles–Sacramento route. Additional local highways connect the various subregions of the Bay Area together.|$|E

40|$|Serbian conservationists {{could learn}} a lot from <b>the</b> <b>revitalization</b> example <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Old city of Bern. Analyses of this example show that <b>the</b> method <b>of</b> <b>revitalization</b> and {{protection}} <b>of</b> listed, but abandoned and inhabited, buildings depends on its future use. Alone analyses of future purpose of built heritage cannot be used as a method for its <b>revitalization.</b> <b>The</b> use <b>of</b> new ideas based on historical importance of the protected building generates the building's structures. <b>The</b> approach <b>of</b> <b>revitalization</b> through <b>the</b> process <b>of</b> building structuring and adaptation to new purpose has been tested through different analyses. It was found that the future purpose of building cannot be determined only by defining <b>the</b> <b>revitalization</b> method, set by public body, but in this process the future owner of building should actively participate. The recommendations for transferring this methodology in solving Serbian built heritage problems are given...|$|R
