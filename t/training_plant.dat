A new thermodynamic property package was developed for sulphuric acid and oleum to correctly predict vapor pressure, density, enthalpy, and SO 2 solubility. Also, a rotary drum granulator was developed to consider the reaction chemistry of DAP production and the stochastic nature of solids created. The granulator can accurately predict particle size distribution, moisture content, ammonia and dust losses, and gas/solid temperatures.

40|$|The {{study of}} the {{steady-state}} and dynamic behaviour of thermal power plants is of interest and significant benefit in different engineering fields ranging from research and design, to the assistance of operator <b>training,</b> <b>plant</b> optimization, fault finding and failure analysis. In light of the these benefits, and the increasing electrical energy demand in South Africa, the Eskom Power Plant Engineering Institute Centre for Energy Efficiency intends to build a transient simulation model of a coal fired power plant. The software identified for this task is Flownex SE. Flownex is a one-dimensional thermal-hydraulic solver that solves user defined networks by obtaining a numerical solution of the governing equations of fluid dynamics and heat transfer. The software contains a vast library of low level standard industrial components such as valves and pipes that can be linked together to form networks. Due to the overall size {{and complexity of the}} intended plant model, it was suggested that individual plant components be modelled separately and then integrated together to form the complete model. The primary objective {{of this study was to}} develop one such model, of a deaerator, in Flownex. In addition to being a building block for the complete plant model, the deaerator model will also be used as a standalone model to predict the steady state, transient and non-condensable gas extraction characteristics of the equipment. The first activity performed was to establish the types and operating principles of the deaerators used in industry, particularly in Eskom power stations. This was achieved through a literature survey complemented by six power station visits and a review of some assets owned by Eskom. It was established that the tray and spray type deaerators were the most commonly used deaerator types, and that their operating principle was based on the temperature-solubility relationship of gases in water and Henry's Law. Based on this knowledge, an analytical model of a deaerator was developed. The purpose of this analytical model was to serve as a verification tool for the final Flownex Model. The analytical model was developed by writing a Mathcad algorithm that solved the steady state one-dimensional mass and energy conservation equations around the deaerator boundary together with the oxygen component continuity equation. The model was successfully validated by comparing its predictions to acceptance tests data from an Eskom's Plant 1 power station. The final step was the development, verification and validation of the Flown ex model. The Flownex model was developed and successfully verified by comparing its predictions to that of the analytical model. Three case studies were then performed as a validation exercise in order to demonstrate the integrity of the model in simulating both steady state and transient scenarios. In all three studies the model predicted the unknown values satisfactorily and within acceptable error margins. It was therefore concluded that the primary objective of the study had been met...|$|E
40|$|The plant {{breeding}} enterprise {{is large and}} highly interdisciplinary. In considering how to approach this topic, {{it is necessary to}} define who is a plant breeder for that defines the scope of this paper. For the purpose of this paper, a plant breeder will be defined as a person who is actively involved in creating new plant germplasm that may lead to new cultivars or be used as parents to create new cultivars of food, feed, fiber, and ornamental plants. This definition is deliberately narrow. For example it does not include those who are developing molecular markers for marker assisted selection, unless the scientist is involved in the selection process. Nor would it include a germplasm evaluator unless he or she is actively involved in using some of the evaluated lines to create new germplasm. Plant breeders often work in teams, which can include geneticists, cytogeneticists, plant evolutionists, biochemists, plant pathologists, entomologists, cereal or other end-use quality chemists, statisticians, and plant production specialists. These fields are very important in plant improvement, but their educational needs are different than those of plant breeders. THE DEMOGRAPHICS OF PLANT BREEDING In reviewing the educational needs of plant breeders, it is helpful to know who currently does {{plant breeding}} (Table 1, adapted from Frey, 1996). A more recent survey is being developed (A. M. Thro, personal communication), but Frey (1996) is the most recent complete report on the human capital involved in plant breeding. The summary data in Table 1 is in science person years (the amount of time a full time person would work for one year). For simplicity, the science person years will be called scientists or breeders with the understanding that the actual number of plant breeders exceeds those reported in the table because many breeders have additional duties. For example, a breeder can split his or her time between breeding two or more plants, or with teaching and plant breeding research, etc. If a university plant breeder had 50 % teaching appointment and a 50 % research appointment where he or she worked equally on breeding new oat (Avena sativa L.) and barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) cultivars, their breeding contribution reported in Table 1 would be 0. 25 scientist years for barley breeding and 0. 25 scientist years for oat breeding. With recent consolidations in commercial plant breeding the current numbers may be slightly lower than those for 1996, however the rough proportions will be similar. In 1996, there were 2205 plant breeders and about 68 % were employed in the private sector, 24 % were employed at universities, and the remaining 8 % were employed by the U. S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). Hence, about 2 out of every 3 graduate students who are trained in plant breeding will work in the private sector. For any crop, the proportion will vary, but generally the range would be somewhere between 3 to 4 out of 5 graduate students will work in the private sector in the future. Of these 2205 breeders, about 40 % (892 breeders) were involved in cereal breeding, with the majority of the cereal breeders [598. 5 (67 %) out of 892] working in some aspect of corn (Zea mays L.) breeding (Table 2, adapted from Frey, 1996). In corn breeding, most breeders are in the private sector (93 %). In cereals, 79 % of all breeders are in the private sector. If cereals are removed from Table 1, the proportion of private breeders would be 61 %. While most of the breeders listed in Tables 1 and 2 will have a PhD degree, the MS and BS level plant breeders are probably similarly distributed among the public and private sector. The data clearly show that most students will need to be educated so that they can succeed in a commercial setting. The question therefore needs to be asked as to whether we are realistically <b>training</b> <b>plant</b> breeders for the opportunities that they will have...|$|E
40|$|Soil {{microbial}} communities {{may influence}} the composition and species abundance of plant communities through the phenomenon of ???soil feedback,??? which is the tendency of a plant species to cause physical, chemical and/or biological changes in the soil that are beneficial or detrimental to its own fitness or that of its competitors. In this study, I investigated the microbial communities associated with soil feedback to two agricultural weeds, common sunflower (Helianthus annuus) and giant ragweed (Ambrosia trifida). These two plants generally follow opposite gradients of abundance from west to east in the northern United States, and I hypothesized that soil feedback can partially explain this pattern. In each of six states, sunflower and ragweed were grown separately in local soil for two 10 -weeks ???soil training??? phases {{in order to allow}} each plant species to modify the microbial communities. Next, sunflower and ragweed were grown separately in the soil trained by the same species and also in the soil trained by the other species, and a soil feedback score was calculated by comparing the biomass of the plants in these two treatments. Bacterial and fungal communities {{at the end of the}} experiment were assessed by automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis (ARISA). I evaluated the relative effects of three forces shaping microbial communities: 1) the source community, which was the initial microbial community present in the local soil of each state; 2) the influence of the <b>training</b> <b>plant</b> species (ragweed or sunflower) in the initial phase of the experiment; and 3) the influence of the plant species (ragweed and sunflower) in the final phase of the experiment. I also used multivariate modeling to identify the key microbial taxa that contributed to the feedback score calculated from the plant biomass. I found that the source community had the strongest effect on microbial community composition. This suggests that the plant - soil feedback largely depends on the starting microbial communities that the plant encounters. However, within each state, I could detect a significant influence of the plants on microbial community composition over the course of the experiment. Of the microbial taxa that responded to plant influence, only a few were identified by multivariate modeling as being significantly related to plant growth (i. e. soil feedback). Only 10 % of the taxa in the total microbial community were needed to classify soil feedback as either net positive or net negative, and these same key taxa could predict the observed feedback scores for sunflower and ragweed (R 2 = 0. 80). Furthermore, some key taxa may be involved in interactions between ragweed and sunflower. Sunflower growth increased the abundance of bacteria that significantly affected ragweed growth. However, ragweed growth generally increased the abundance of bacteria that only affected ragweed. For each plant species, beneficial fungal taxa were more abundant in the soils of states where the plant received positive soil feedback, and harmful fungal taxa were more abundant in the soils of states where the plant received negative feedback. Another difference between bacteria and fungi is their apparent response to plant selection pressure. Bacterial community variability was reduced in treatments with large positive or large negative feedback scores (P= 0. 02), but the same was not true for fungi. Overall, my results show that ragweed and sunflower???s capacity to shape soil microbial communities is strongly dependent on the source community, which varies over the geographic range of these weeds. A minor fraction of the soil microbial community appears to be involved in soil feedback. Beneficial fungi for sunflower tend to be found in places where sunflower abundance is highest, while harmful fungi are found in places where sunflower abundance is lowest. The same is true for ragweed. However, soil bacteria appear to respond more strongly to plant selection and may be involved in interactions between sunflower and ragweed. A better understanding of the geographic variability of microbial communities, the key microbial taxa that respond to plant selection, and their feedback to plant growth, may lead to more effective management strategies for agricultural weeds...|$|E
