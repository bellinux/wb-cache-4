25|$|After {{the success}} of the EMB 110 Bandeirante, Embraer began the {{development}} of their first <b>transport</b> <b>category</b> airliner in 1974. The Family 12X comprised three models with modular concept designs: EMB 120 Araguaia, EMB 123 Tapajós and EMB 121 Xingu. EMB 121 was the sole 12X model effectively produced. Araguaia's name was changed to Brasilia in 1979 at the official launching of the project, when at a CAAA (Commuter Airline Association of America) convention at USA several suggestions from prospective operators were collected and incorporated to EMB 120 design. Thus, a completely new aircraft – no longer related to the 12X family – was launched. No common parts from EMB 121 Xingu were used, and the capacity was revised from 24 to 30 seats. Originally designed to utilise the new 1500 shp Pratt & Whitney Canada PW115 turboprop, it was later upgraded to the 1892 eshp PW118.|$|E

50|$|A {{principle}} behind <b>transport</b> <b>category</b> {{design standards}} {{is that any}} element in an airplane or helicopter can fail, but the risk of such a failure causing an accident should be extremely low. Consequently <b>transport</b> <b>category</b> airplanes and helicopters have duplicated elements wherever failure of one element is likely to cause an accident. For example, <b>transport</b> <b>category</b> airplanes must {{have at least two}} engines and be flown by at least two pilots. The loads on the wings and tailplanes are usually carried by multiple load paths. If one element of the primary structure fails due to metal fatigue or corrosion the remaining sound elements of the structure must carry the loads until the failed structural element is discovered in routine maintenance. This fail-safe principle is not necessary in airplanes and helicopters that are not certificated in the <b>transport</b> <b>category.</b>|$|E

Sodium sieving corrected for sodium diffusion with a formula applicable to the PET. CA 125 appearance rate (AR) was measured. Expected and observed 60 min D/P(creatinine) were compared by Bland and Altman. RESULTS: Means (95 % CI) : D/P(creatinine) 0. 73 (0. 70 - 0. 76), MTAC(creatinine) 9. 6 (8. 4 - 10. 9) ml/min, D/D 0 glucose 0. 30 (0. 28 - 0. 31), corrected dip 0. 17 (0. 15 - 0. 18), CA 125 150 (125 - 176) U/min. Both corrected and uncorrected sodium sieving were informative. Peritoneal transport was faster at 60 min dwell. UFF patients presented very low corrected dip and CA 125 AR. CONCLUSION: 3. 86 % (4 h) PET provided results similar to those from SPA. Correction for diffusion of sodium sieving is dispensable for simple clinical evaluations. D/P(creatinine) at 60 min overestimated small solute transport rate. Effluent CA 125 was consistently lower in UFF patient...|$|R
