40|$|Dedicated to {{the memory}} of Juha Heinonen. Abstract. We call a {{complement}} of a union of at least three disjoint (round) open balls in the unit sphere S n a Schottky set. We prove that every quasisymmetric homeomorphism of a Schottky set of spherical measure zero to another Schottky set is the restriction of a Möbius transformation on S n. In the other direction we show that every Schottky set in S 2 of positive measure admits nontrivial quasisymmetric maps to other Schottky sets. These results are applied to establish rigidity statements for convex subsets of hyperbolic space that have totally geodesic boundaries. 1. Introduction. Let S n denote the n-dimensional unit sphere in R n+ 1 equipped with the restriction of the Euclidean metric. A Schottky set is a subset of S n whose complement is a union of at least three disjoint metric (i. e., round) open balls. We impose the requirement that a Schottky set has at least three distinct open balls as complementary components to rule out cases <b>that</b> are <b>easy</b> <b>t...</b>|$|R
40|$|Clock {{recovery}} circuits {{are among}} the most critical components in communication systems. A dual-loop architecture, in which the frequency synthesizer and the clock aligner are separated, has been used extensively due to the conflicting needs to sup-press jitter accumulation and filter noisy input [1]. Among dif-ferent frequency synthesis architectures, a multiplying delay-locked loop (MDLL) is advantageous when a clean reference clock is available since the oscillator noise is accumulated only over one reference clock cycle before being reset by the clean source [2]. However, this instantaneous correction produces large cycle-to-cycle jitter and duty-cycle distortion (jointly called clock distortion hereafter) for the downstream clock and data paths. The clock aligner, however, requires a low bandwidth for input jitter filtering. Its control loop is often implemented as a first order system using digital circuits <b>that</b> are flexible, <b>easy</b> <b>t...</b>|$|R

The importance of helping the architect understand the school media center's unique mission and relevant educational specifications [...] e. g., activities related to teaching and learning, patterns of use, and space requirements [...] is discussed, and checklists for educational specifications and monitoring progress are provided. A detailed discussion addresses the functions and relationships of major areas within the media center, e. g., circulation, reading areas, and computer laboratories; describes New Hampshire's minimum space requirements; and presents recommended space allocations in tabular form.

40|$|To {{cope with}} the rapid {{technological}} advances, product proliferation, shorter product lifecycles, and increasing competition, electronics companies are adopting flexible assembly strategies using multiple surface mount assembly modules to produce many different products in small batches. The component placement machines account for over half the investment in surface mount assembly lines, and also require considerable setup time (comparable to the actual processing time for small lot sizes) to changeover production from one product to another. This paper addresses a tactical planning problem for high mix, low volume electronics assembly facilities containing several placement machines (modules) operating in parallel. We propose an optimization model to decide which product families to assemble on each machine {{in order to minimize}} the total setup cost per demand period while ensuring that none of the machines is overloaded. Unlike strategic and operational models that emphasize either workload balancing or setup optimization, our tactical planning model simultaneously considers both these conflicting factors. To capture the impact of product grouping decisions on setup cost, we consider a panial setup policy <b>that</b> is both <b>easy</b> <b>t...</b>|$|R
40|$|The gaze holding {{integrator}} of the oculomotor system {{performs a}} temporal integration on the rate-encoded eye velocity signals fed to {{it from the}} visual and vestibular systems. During intervals between eye movements, the brain holds the eyes motionless using a memory of eye position that {{is believed to be}} maintained by the gaze holding integrator of the oculomotor system. When the eyes are motionless, the dynamics of the integrator network can be described qualitatively in terms of a line attractor in its state space. In this study, we construct a neural network model with approximate line attractor dynamics, using biologically plausible spiking nonlinear neuron models. Several classes of networks and feedback are discussed, and a local learning rule is developed. These networks are capable of maintaining multiple stable patterns of persistent activity, corresponding respectively to multiple eye positions. The number of such states is limited by the number of neurons in the network, leading to the prediction that the integrator can maintain only a finite number of eye positions, an effect <b>that</b> should be <b>easier</b> <b>t...</b>|$|R
40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{validate}} the Portuguese translations of four cystic fibrosis quality of life questionnaires (CFQ). The first three were developed for patients with cystic fibrosis aged from 6 to 11 years, from 12 to 13 years and 14 years or more, while the fourth was developed for the parents of patients aged 6 to 13 years. Material and methods: The four CFQ translations contained from 35 to 50 questions covering nine domains and were validated as follows: translation from English to Portuguese, pilot application, back translation and then approval by the author of the English versions. The four translations were applied to 90 stable patients (30 from each age group) and the parents of patients aged 6 - 13 years (n = 60), on two occasions with a 13 to 17 day interval. Intraclass Correlation Coefficients (ICC) were used to measure reproducibility. This study was approved by the Commission for Ethics in Research at the institution. Results: Reproducibility was good (ICC = 0. 62 to 0. 99) for the four translations in all domains, with the exceptions of the Digestion domain for the 6 to 11 and 12 to 13 years age groups with ICC = 0. 59 and 0. 47, respectively and the Social Role domain for the 14 and over age group (ICC =- 0. 19). Conclusion: The translation and cultural adaptation for Brazil resulted in four CFQ versions <b>that</b> are <b>easy</b> <b>t...</b>|$|R
