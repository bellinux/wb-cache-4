500|$|Clarkson favored [...] "Run Run Rudolph" [...] as her {{favorite}} classic, saying: [...] "Just because it got <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> rock and roll." [...] She also remarked that [...] "Please Come Home for Christmas (Bells Will Be Ringing)" [...] {{was the first}} song selected for inclusion after her mother's recommendation and the song's melancholic lyrics. Written by Clarkson and Eubanks, [...] "Every Christmas", was the first song to be written for the album. She revealed that the song narrates of her holiday life prior to meeting Brandon Blackstock, Reba McEntire's stepson, saying: [...] "Every Christmas, I was just like, 'This {{is going to be}} different, right? I'm going to actually find someone and not be pathetically alone {{for the rest of my}} life?'". The seventh track is a cover of Elvis Presley's [...] "Blue Christmas". Its follow-up, a rendition of [...] "Baby, It's Cold Outside", features Ronnie Dunn. Clarkson had approached Dunn thinking that his personality suited the song's content well, saying: [...] "Like, it's straight-up his personality to say all of that to try and get you to stay, and have a drink." [...] "Winter Dreams (Brandon's Song)" [...] was written by Clarkson, Arrison, and Eubanks as a companion piece to [...] "Every Christmas". Dedicated to Blackstock, the song accounts her holiday after meeting him. She remarked: [...] "Christmas changes, it morphs, it comes to life a little more… It’s just a happier time." ...|$|E
500|$|Cameron {{convinced}} Fox {{to promote}} the film based on the publicity afforded by shooting the Titanic wreck itself, and organized several dives to the site {{over a period of}} two years. [...] "My pitch on that had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> detailed," [...] said Cameron. [...] "So I said, 'Look, we've got to do this whole opening where they're exploring the Titanic and they find the diamond, so we're going to have all these shots of the ship." [...] Cameron stated, [...] "Now, we can either do them with elaborate models and motion control shots and CG and all that, which will cost X amount of money – or we can spend X plus 30 per cent and actually go shoot it at the real wreck." [...] The crew shot at the real wreck in the Atlantic Ocean twelve times in 1995 and actually spent more time with the ship than its passengers. At that depth, with a water pressure of 6,000 pounds per square inch, [...] "one small flaw in the vessel's superstructure would mean instant death for all on board." [...] Not only were the dives high-risk, but adverse conditions prevented Cameron from getting the high quality footage that he wanted. During one dive, one of the submersibles collided with Titanics hull, damaging both sub and ship and leaving fragments of the submersible's propeller shroud scattered around the superstructure. The external bulkhead of Captain Smith's quarters collapsed, exposing the interior. The area around the entrance to the Grand Staircase was also damaged.|$|E

2500|$|Jabari Darnell Wilkes: (played by: Seasons 1–6 Tanner Scott Richards, Season 7–8 Kendré Berry) is Maya and Darnell's son. He {{was born}} when Maya was only 16 years old. A running gag {{in the series}} is Toni's habit of mispronouncing his name by calling him names such as Jumanji, Gymboree, Jujube, Jacuzzi, Jalebi, June bug, Djibuti, Jaboobooboo, Jamal, Jafifi, Jamiroquai, Jimmy Crack Corn, Jungle Jim, Juwanna Mann, Jeep Cherokee, Jolly Rancher, Jakarta, Jingle-jangle, Jehoshaphat, Jambalaya, Japetso, Jaboomboom, Jappuccino, and Jam On It.

2500|$|In a June 2003 interview, Maida {{explained}} that lyrically, his {{words on the}} album would follow the music and would be very much {{a product of the}} times. [...] "I think it's going <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> raw, a little bit more in your face, not a lot of relationship stuff," [...] he says, noting that fans would get a preview of a couple of the tracks, [...] "Wipe That Smile Off Your Face" [...] and [...] "Walking In Circles", on the current tour. [...] "My head, with what's {{going on in the world}} and being able to reflect on all the (stuff) that I've done in the last few years in terms of going to Iraq, working very closely with War Child, I'm in that mode. I'm not angry, but kind of frustrated." [...] After observing the plight in Sudan and Darfur, Maida returned with a different outlook on his lyrics and became more outspoken. “There were some [...] that were way too over the top and preachy,” he admits, “and I had to pull a lot of stuff back. This isn’t a solo record for me, this is Our Lady Peace, so I have three people that I contend with in terms of how far I can go with saying things.” Bassist Coutts added [...] "A lot of things he was talking about lyrically were things that we discussed as a band in spending all that time together. I also think that becoming a father also let him deal with issues that he hadn't dealt with before. Although there are some of the darkest lyrics ever on this record, I think there are also some very positive ones as well." [...] The content of the album's lyrics have led it to be classified as a politically charged album, which the band hasn't denied.|$|E
