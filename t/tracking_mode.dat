25|$|New to the Hercules {{system was}} the Target Ranging Radar, or TRR. It is {{relatively}} easy to jam range information on monopulse radars like the TTR by sending out false return signals. The radar can continue to locate the target in elevation or azimuth because all of the signals come from the same location, but the receiver cannot easily determine which pulse was sent by the radar and which was sent by the electronic countermeasures (ECM) on the target aircraft. The TRR system combatted this by operating on two selectable very different set of frequencies. The result was fine for ranging but useless for position determination. This signal {{would be very difficult to}} jam because the jammer would have to broadcast across a wide set of frequencies in order to ensure they were returning on the frequency the receiver had actually selected. Meanwhile, the TTR can continue offering location information, and in the case that is also jammed (difficult but possible), was upgraded to offer a home-on-jam mode that used the ECM system's own broadcasts as a location source. Skilled operators could also try to track the target in a manual <b>tracking</b> <b>mode.</b>|$|E
500|$|The first radar (instead of {{previous}} lidar) sensor on a Lexus sedan allowed the new Dynamic RADAR Cruise Control {{to work in}} any weather conditions. The millimeter-wave radar technology also enabled the first Pre-Collision System (PCS) on a Lexus sedan (with partial autonomous braking only on the Japanese market Toyota Celsior version). A [...] "low-speed tracking mode" [...] was added in 2004. The low-speed <b>tracking</b> <b>mode</b> was a second mode that would warn the driver if the car ahead stopped and provide braking; it could stop the car but then deactivated.|$|E
2500|$|The {{functioning}} of the radar is completely automatic, controlled by four computers. [...] The software divides the beam time between [...] "surveillance" [...] and [...] "tracking" [...] functions, switching the beam back and forth rapidly between different tasks. [...] In the surveillance mode, which normally consumes about 11% of the duty cycle, the radar repeatedly scans the horizon across its full 240° azimuth in a pattern between 3° and 10° elevation, creating a [...] "surveillance fence" [...] to immediately detect missiles as they rise above the horizon into the radar's field of view. In the <b>tracking</b> <b>mode,</b> which normally consumes the other 7% of the 18% duty cycle, the radar beam follows already-detected objects to determine their trajectory, calculating their launch and target points.|$|E

50|$|A {{fire unit}} {{consists}} of one Fire Control System vehicle and two launcher vehicles {{as well as}} a number of support vehicles with a total crew of fifteen men. The Fire Control Systems vehicle consists of an Isuzu Motors 6×6 truck with a 30 kW generator unit mounted behind the driver's cabin, and a rectangular three-dimensional pulse-doppler phased array radar. The radar can operate in three modes: omni-directional search, sector search/course <b>tracking</b> <b>mode,</b> and fine <b>tracking</b> <b>mode.</b> The radar is scanned both mechanically and electronically and can track up to six targets within the same 110-degree arc in course <b>tracking</b> <b>mode.</b> Two targets can be tracked in fine <b>tracking</b> <b>mode</b> at greater accuracy, with the single-shot kill probability for each target relayed to the operator via a CRT display. The radar has a range of about 30 kilometers, and has built in IFF capabilities.|$|E

40|$|A {{system to}} track an uninstrumented conductor's baton by {{computer}} vision techniques is developed. An initial seek mode locates a baton in an image frame without prior knowledge; a subsequent <b>track</b> <b>mode</b> uses temporal information {{to cope with}} motion blur and noise.

50|$|Conical scan and {{monopulse}} antennas {{are susceptible}} to interference from weather phenomenon and stationary objects. The resulting interference can produce feedback signals that move the antenna beam away from the aircraft. This can produce an unreliable antenna position when the antenna is aimed too near the ground or too near to heavy weather. Systems with no Pulse Doppler <b>tracking</b> <b>mode</b> may remain aimed at irrelevant objects like trees or clouds. Constant operator attention is required {{when there is no}} Doppler signal processing.|$|E
50|$|The track while scan (TWS) is {{a mode of}} radar {{operation}} in which the radar allocates part of its power to tracking the target or targets while part of its power is allocated to scanning, unlike the straight <b>tracking</b> <b>mode,</b> when the radar directs all its power to tracking the acquired targets.

40|$|The Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Fine Guidance System has set new {{standards}} in pointing control capability for earth orbiting spacecraft. Two precision pointing control modes are {{implemented in the}} Fine Guidance System; one being a Coarse <b>Track</b> <b>Mode</b> which employs a pseudo-quadrature detector approach and the second being a Fine Mode which uses a two axis interferometer implementation. The Coarse <b>Track</b> <b>Mode</b> was designed to maintain FGS pointing error to within 20 milli-arc seconds (rms) when guiding on a 14. 5 Mv star. The Fine Mode was designed to maintain FGS pointing error to less than 3 milli-arc seconds (rms). This paper addresses the HST FGS operating in the Coarse <b>Track</b> <b>Mode.</b> An overview of the implementation, the operation, and both the predicted and observed on orbit performance is presented. The discussion includes {{a review of the}} Fine Guidance System hardware which uses two beam steering Star Selector servos, four photon counting photomultiplier tube detectors, as well as a 24 bit microprocessor, which executes the control system firmware. Unanticipated spacecraft operational characteristics are discussed as they impact pointing performance. These include the influence of spherically aberrated star images as well as the mechanical shocks induced in the spacecraft during and following orbital day/night terminator crossings. Computer modeling of the Coarse <b>Track</b> <b>Mode</b> verifies the observed on orbit performance trends in the presence of these optical and mechanical disturbances. It is concluded that the coarse track pointing control function is performing as designed and is providing a robust pointing control capability for the Hubble Space Telescope...|$|R

A parameter constraining technique is introduced to develop more reliable models of human operator dynamics. The human operator is adequately modeled by a second order dynamic system both in pursuit and compensatory <b>tracking</b> <b>modes.</b> In comparing the data sampling rates, 100 msec between samples is adequate and is shown to provide better results than 200 msec sampling. The residual power spectrum and eigenvalue analysis show that the human operator is not a generator of periodic characteristics...|$|R

50|$|When not in operation, the {{gyroscope}} assembly {{is anchored}} within the instrument. The electrically powered gyroscope is started while restrained and then released for operation. During operation the gyroscope is supported within the instrument assembly, typically on a thin vertical tape that constrains the gyroscope spinner axis to remain horizontal. The {{alignment of the}} spin axis is permitted to rotate in azimuth by only the small amount required during operation. An initial approximate estimate of the meridian is needed.

40|$|A 5 th order {{polynomial}} {{spline function}} {{is applied to}} the position command generation of the SOFIA cavity door drive system in order to limit jerk. By limiting the door jerk, a smooth acceleration profile is achieved and less current demand is required to provide door actuation. The existing drive system suffers from unanticipated high current demand during tracking mode,specifically over very frequent, short door trajectories. The high current demand is inherent to the aggressive trapezoidal acceleration profile. The 5 th order polynomial spline function is chosen for not only its smooth velocity and acceleration profile, but more importantly, for its manipulation into closed-form expressions for predicting door drive dynamics and motor terminal behavior. It is shown that from the 5 th order polynomial position function, one can derive closedform expressions for velocity, acceleration, and jerk. These expressions are applied to the wellknown electromechanical differential equation and the DC motor voltage equation to develop closed-form current and power expressions that includes the jerk limited <b>track</b> <b>mode</b> behavior and the door dynamics. The performance of the door drive system is then predicted under this jerk limited <b>track</b> <b>mode</b> and verified in the Matlab/Simulink environment. The simulation results of the jerk limited <b>track</b> <b>mode</b> show that while door response slightly decreases, current demand is vastly reduced...|$|R
5000|$|Ground-based radars {{like the}} SCR-584 {{automated}} this process {{early in their}} evolution. In search mode the SCR-584 rotated its antenna through 360 degrees and any returns were plotted on a plan position indicator (PPI). This gave the operators an indication of any targets within its ~25 mile detection range and their direction relative to the radar van. When one of the returns was considered interesting, the radar was flipped to <b>tracking</b> <b>mode</b> and [...] "locked-on". From then on it would automatically keep its antenna pointed at the target, feeding out accurate direction, altitude and range information on a B-Scope display. Operator workload was greatly reduced.|$|E
5000|$|The {{guidance}} {{system of the}} missile is actually command guidance, as the missile doesn't have its own radar. It only follows orders provided by the onboard radar of the carrier/launcher helicopter, the Thomson-CSF I/J-band [...] "Agrion 15". When this radar detects and identifies a suitable target, it switches to automatic <b>tracking</b> <b>mode.</b> Once the target is inside the missiles range it launches, the booster motors accelerate the missile to its cruise speed of 280 meters per second, after which the sustainer motor cuts in. The missile immediately begins descending to an altitude of around 3 to 5 meters. The rocket motors have a combined burn time of around 45 seconds.|$|E
50|$|The chassis of the ItPsv 90 Marksman is a Polish T-55AM tank, {{which has}} been {{modified}} to fit the turret. The AM version was chosen due to the increased weight of the system (a T55AM weighs 36 tons, while a T-55AM Marksman weighs 41 tons) and the AM has more power (620 hp) than a regular T-55. The weapon system is guided by a British Marconi 400 series frequency agile surveillance and tracking X/J-band radar, which is able to detect targets out to 12 km in search mode and 10 km in <b>tracking</b> <b>mode.</b> The laser distance measure device functions up to 8 km. The commander and the gun operator both have gyro-stabilized optical aiming devices.|$|E
40|$|The {{versatility}} {{of current}} rovers and exploratory vehicles {{is limited by}} a single drive system. The Variable Drive Vehicle (VDV) employs a actuated systemcapable of switching between wheeled and <b>tracked</b> drive <b>modes.</b> This allows the vehicle to travel quickly and efficiently over smooth terrain and to traverse more arduous terrain by switching between these two systems. The small scale prototype built {{over the course of}} this project is equipped with two modular wheel driven track units to demonstrate the viability of the system. Electric linear actuators and servo motors allow for simple control and a smooth transition between each drive system. These devices allow the modular tracks to be rotated out from under the wheels, and stowed on the vehicle when not in use. Finite element analysis ensured that the VDV’s switchingmechanism maintains safe loading at its most critical points during a drive system transition. The VDV was tested on smooth concrete to determine its maximum wheel speed, track speed, and how fast the drive system could be switched. Experiments yielded a top speed of 11. 5 mph in the wheel mode, 0. 8 mph in the <b>track</b> <b>mode,</b> and a switching time of 6. 4 seconds. The vehicle’smaximumobstacle clearance, 1 inch in <b>track</b> <b>mode</b> and 2 inches in wheel mode, and slope, 5 degrees in <b>track</b> <b>mode</b> and 22 degrees in wheel mode, fell short of expected values. These shortcomings resulted from a poor frictional power transfer when attempting to power the tracks using the wheels. However, this prototype provides a proof of concept for a variable drive system successfully incorporating two drive systems, and future improvements may yield a promising platformfor future robotics research...|$|R
