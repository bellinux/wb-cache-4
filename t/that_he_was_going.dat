5|$|Several {{rumors and}} misconceptions {{have grown up}} around the film, one being that Ronald Reagan was {{originally}} chosen to play Rick. This originated in a press release issued by the studio {{early on in the}} film's development, but by that time the studio already knew <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> into the Army, and he was never seriously considered. George Raft claimed that he had turned down the lead role. Studio records make clear that Wallis was committed to Bogart from the start.|$|E
5|$|Tatsuguchi reached Rabaul on October 4, 1942. His {{stay there}} was {{probably}} short, for his wife recorded that he joined her in Tokyo that same month prior to being redeployed. Tatsuguchi was unable to tell his wife, now pregnant with their second child, {{where he would be}} assigned, but she noticed that he studied maps of the North Pacific area.

5|$|During {{his service}} in New Orleans, Beauregard became {{dissatisfied}} as a peacetime officer. He informed the U.S. Army Engineer Department late in 1856 <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> {{to join the}} filibuster with William Walker, who had seized control of Nicaragua; he had offered Beauregard the rank of second-in-command of his army.

He briefly entered politics as a reform candidate for mayor of New Orleans in 1858, where he was promoted by both the Whig and Democratic parties to challenge the Know Nothing party candidate. Beauregard was narrowly defeated.|$|E

There he meets the chief of Vayuputras, Mithra, who {{turns out to be}} his maternal uncle. Mithra convinces the Vayuputras that Shiva is the real Neelkanth and gives him the Pashupathiastra which acts on a specific target, rather than annihilating everything like the Brahmastra. Meanwhile, Parvateshwar uses decoy ships to give an impression to Kali <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to attack Panchavati. Alarmed, Kali takes the bait and leaves with the finest Naga soldiers in their pursuit. However, she realizes her folly and returns.|$|E

When McQueen found out, he became upset and told Bogdanovich <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to get someone else to direct The Getaway.|$|E
5|$|Marko, age 300, {{rode the}} 160-year-old Šarac by the {{seashore}} towards Mount Urvina when a vila told him <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to die. Marko then leaned over a well and saw no {{reflection of his}} face on the water; hydromancy confirmed the vilas words. He killed Šarac so the Turks would not use him for menial labor, and gave his beloved companion an elaborate burial. Marko broke his sword and spear, throwing his mace far out to sea before lying down to die. His body was found seven days later by Abbot Vaso and his deacon, Isaija. Vaso took Marko to Mount Athos and buried him at the Hilandar Monastery in an unmarked grave.|$|E

Wilson repeated <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to stay north of the river overnight, close to the king, and asked Forbes to bring the whole column across by 04:00 in the morning. Forbes thought it unwise to attempt a full river crossing at night, which he reasoned might lead to his force being surrounded in the darkness and massacred, but also felt he could not recall Wilson, as {{to do so would}} be to lose Lobengula for sure.|$|E

5|$|Caesar {{was assassinated}} in March 44 BC. The motives of the conspirators were both personal, as well as political.

The grievances that they held against him were vague, and as such, their plan against him was vague. The fact that their motives were vague, and that they had no idea of what to do after his assassination, both were plainly obvious by the subsequent course of events.|$|E
5|$|Ferrara has {{proposed}} a number of redevelopments for the orphanage itself, and its surroundings. In 2004, he proposed a plan to redevelop the lot and building into 63 residential units.

Two metre high walls were going to be built to keep vandals out and to prevent further damage.
