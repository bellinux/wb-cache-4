40|$|Objective: This {{study was}} eanied out to {{investigate}} the effects of Raphani Semen on immuno-response in the mouse model of allergic asthma. Methods: In this study, BALB/C mice were divided into 6 groups: Normal (Non-treated group), Control (Group with not <b>treated</b> after allergic sensitization and induction by ovalbumin), <b>Treat</b> I (Group with the oral administration of saline after allergic sensitization and induction by ovalbumin), <b>Treat</b> n (Allergic asthma group <b>treated</b> with acupuncture (BL 13)), <b>Treat</b> III (Allergic asthma group <b>treated</b> with the oral administration of Raphani Semen) and <b>Treat</b> lV (Allergic asthma group <b>treated</b> with the herbal-acupuncture of Raphani Semen (BL 13)). The effect on cytokine was assessed by measuring cytokine (lL- 2, IL- 4, IL- 5, IL- 10, IL- 12, IFN-r) in bronchoalveoar lavage fluid(ELISA). ResuJts : The results obtained as follows: 1. The production of Interleukin- 2 was decreased significantly in <b>Treat</b> I group, <b>Treat</b> n group and <b>Treat</b> IV group as compared with Control group. 2. The production of Interleukin- 4 was decreased significantly in <b>Treat</b> I group, <b>Treat</b> II group and <b>Treat</b> IV group as compared with Control group. Among them. the production of Interleukin- 4 was decreased remarkably in <b>Treat</b> IV group as compared with other groups. 3. The production of Interleukin- 5 was decreased significantly in <b>Treat</b> I group and <b>Treat</b> IV group as compared with Control group. 4. The production of Interleukin- 10 was decreased significantly in <b>Treat</b> I group and <b>Treat</b> III group as compared with Control group. 5. The production of Interleukin- 12 was all decreased significantly in <b>Treat</b> I group, <b>Treat</b> n group, <b>Treat</b> m group and <b>Treat</b> IV group as compared with Control group. 6. The production of Intelferon- showed no significant changes in <b>Treat</b> I group, <b>Treat</b> n group. <b>Treat</b> m group and <b>Treat</b> Ⅳ group as compared with Control group. Conclusion: These {{results show that the}} production of Interleukin- 4, 5 was decreased significantly in aJlergic asthma group <b>treated</b> with the herbal-acupuncture of Raph Semen (BL 13), It is known that inactivity of Th 2 cell constrained the revelation and controlled hypersenstive action. As to this mechanism, it is suggested that the herbal-acupuncture of Raphani Semen(BL 13) constrained the revelation of allergic asthma...|$|R
