5|$|Both Murphy and Universal gave serious {{considerations}} to {{a follow-up}} {{version of his}} post-war life. Murphy rejected the Richard J. Collins script The Way Back which created the fictional scenario that filming To Hell and Back had been so therapeutic for Murphy that it cured him of his combat fatigue. Spec McClure scripted a second unused version of The Way Back that incorporated Murphy's real-life friends into the storyline and ended with the star living happily ever after with Pamela and <b>their</b> <b>two</b> <b>sons.</b> A third version by an unknown writer focused on the Murphy-McClure friendship and {{was rejected by the}} threat of a lawsuit from McClure. Desi Arnaz offered to bankroll a 1965 project titled Helmets in the Dust. At Murphy's request McClure wrote a film treatment, but the project never came to fruition.|$|E
5|$|Like Caroline herself (who {{was created}} Baroness Vaughan upon {{the birth of}} their first son), the two boys were granted {{courtesy}} titles, but no official royal decrees were ever issued by Leopold, the Belgian government, or any other foreign state, causing them to be merely honorary. Because of their parents' legally invalid marriage, <b>their</b> <b>two</b> <b>sons</b> were still deemed illegitimate. Upon each of their births, they had been registered in France under Caroline's name; no mention of Leopold or another potential father was made. Despite these facts, there were fears in Belgium that Leopold would recognize his eldest son as heir to the throne. Had Leopold married in a legal civil ceremony, the boy could have indeed inherited the throne, because all classes were equal under the Belgian constitution, and thus their marriage would not have been considered morganatic. In 1910, the two boys were adopted by Antoine Durrieux, whom Caroline married soon after Leopold's death.|$|E
5|$|Michael Hart {{arrived in}} Lyttelton {{with his wife}} and <b>their</b> <b>two</b> <b>sons</b> on the Cressy on 27 December 1850, one of the First Four Ships {{reaching}} Canterbury. Before he came out to New Zealand, he had been a plumber. Hart founded the White Hart on the corner of High and Cashel Streets, the first hotel in Christchurch. The hotel opened on 15 November 1851, {{less than a year after}} the organised settlement of Christchurch. In December 1852, Hart catered for 150 guests who had assembled to farewell John Robert Godley, the founder of Canterbury who returned to England after his short stay in the colony. A well-known man, Hart had no political experience; he was never elected onto the Canterbury Provincial Council.|$|E

5|$|Alliance {{with his}} father-in-law, Władysław I the Elbow-high, King of Poland, became a {{permanent}} element of Charles's {{foreign policy in}} the 1320s. After being defeated by the united forces of the Teutonic Knights and John of Bohemia, WładysławI sent his son and heir, Casimir, to Visegrád in late 1329 to seek assistance from Charles. During his stay in Charles's court, the nineteen-year-old Casimir seduced Claire Záh, who was a lady-in-waiting of Charles's wife, Elisabeth of Poland, according to an Italian writer. On 17April 1330, the young lady's father, Felician Záh, stormed into the dining room of the royal palace at Visegrád with a sword in his hand and attacked the royal family. Záh wounded both Charles and the queen on their right hand and attempted to kill <b>their</b> <b>two</b> <b>sons,</b> Louis and Andrew, before the royal guards killed him. Charles's revenge was brutal: with the exception of Claire, Felician Záh's children were tortured to death; Claire's lips and all eight fingers were cut before she was dragged by a horse through the streets of many towns; all of Felician's other relatives within the third degree of kinship (including his sons-in-law and sisters) were executed, and those within the seventh degree were condemned to perpetual serfdom.|$|E

Donen and Marshall had two sons together: Peter Donen, born in 1953, and Joshua Donen, born in 1955. They provided the name of Cary Grant's character in Charade. Donen and Marshall were married from 1952 until 1959. They had a lengthy custody battle over <b>their</b> <b>two</b> <b>sons</b> after Marshall married Wagner and Donen moved to England.

Donen proposed to her four days after having met her. They were married from 1990 until 1994.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} the war in May, Blitz was {{stationed}} as a guard ship in the Elbe, primarily in Glückstadt, where a large number of French prisoners of war were being transferred back to France. In July, Blitz became a fishery protection ship; though the duty was generally uneventful, in one case she had to fire a warning shot toward a British fishing vessel to force the crew to recognize German sovereignty. In late July, Blitz steamed to the island of Sylt, where Kronprinz (Crown Prince) Frederick, his wife Kronprinzessin (Crown Princess) Victoria, and <b>their</b> <b>two</b> <b>sons,</b> Wilhelm and Heinrich came aboard for a fishing trip. From 7 October 1871 to June 1872, Blitz {{was stationed}} as a guard ship in Altona, and on 26 June she began another stint as a fishery protection ship. While Blitz was patrolling in the northern North Sea on 29 June, one of her masts broke, forcing her to put into Aberdeen, Scotland for repairs. The crew's unfamiliarity with tidal conditions in Aberdeen nearly caused the boat to run aground. On 5 July, Blitz was ready to depart for the Shetland Islands, and she arrived in Lerwick three days later. On 9 July, she began the journey back to Germany, arriving in Wihelmshaven on the 20th.|$|E

5|$|On 1 August, the Scottish Parliament met {{to settle}} {{religious}} issues. Knox {{and five other}} ministers were called upon {{to draw up a}} new confession of faith. Within four days, the Scots Confession was presented to Parliament, voted upon, and approved. A week later, the Parliament passed three acts in one day: the first abolished the jurisdiction of the Pope in Scotland, the second condemned all doctrine and practice contrary to the reformed faith, and the third forbade the celebration of Mass in Scotland. Before the dissolution of Parliament, Knox and the other ministers were given the task of organising the newly reformed church or the Kirk. They would work for several months on the Book of Discipline, the document describing the organisation of the new church. During this period, in December 1560, Knox's wife, Margery, died, leaving Knox to care for <b>their</b> <b>two</b> <b>sons,</b> aged three and a half and two years old. John Calvin, who had lost his own wife in 1549, wrote a letter of condolence.|$|E
5|$|Leopold spent vast sums {{of money}} on gifts and estates for his young mistress, {{presenting}} for instance the Villa Leopolda to Caroline in 1902. She frequently traveled to Paris to visit her dress- and hat-maker, once bragging that she spent three million francs on dresses at a single store on one occasion. Caroline once complained to Leopold that the evening express train back to Brussels gave her little time to shop, causing Leopold to arrange {{it so that the}} train would leave an hour later. When pregnant with their first child, the king and the French government even split the cost of constructing a new road close to her villa so that her ride would not be uncomfortable. Taking Caroline with him everywhere, the king spent much of his time outside Belgium on his various properties throughout Western Europe, and was much resented by the Belgian people as a result. Much of this time was spent with Caroline and <b>their</b> <b>two</b> <b>sons</b> at his estate at Cap Ferrat in southern France. Caroline also stayed at Chateau de Larmoy, which Leopold had rented for her; he acquired the French Chateau de Balaincourt as well as a villa in Brussels, where Caroline had no scruples in appearing in public. Though typically traveling incognito, she accompanied Leopold to the funeral of Queen Victoria in 1901, causing a great scandal. Her unpopularity in Belgium increased dramatically once it began to be realized that all of Leopold's riches from the Congo were not benefiting his country, but rather himself and his young mistress.|$|E
