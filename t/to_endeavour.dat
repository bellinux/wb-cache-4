5|$|At 4p.m. PDT on May 22, the European Space Agency and Italian Space Agency {{arranged}} for a call <b>to</b> <b>Endeavour</b> by Pope Benedict XVI. During his call—prompted by {{the discovery of a}} gash in the Shuttle's fuselage—the Pope extended his blessing to Kelly's wife, Gabrielle Giffords, who had undergone skull surgery earlier in the week. The event marked the first time a Pope spoke to astronauts {{during the course of a}} mission.|$|E
5|$|Prior <b>to</b> <b>Endeavour</b> docking, the Russian {{resupply}} spacecraft Progress M1-4, {{which came}} to the station in mid-November, was undocked {{to make room for}} the space shuttle. This Progress spacecraft remained undocked for the duration of STS-97, parked in orbit about a mile away from the station. It docked manually again with the station on 26 December by Gidzenko, after Endeavour left. The automatic docking system for this Progress spacecraft had failed on the first docking in November. The crew spent much of the following week unloading the Progress spacecraft.|$|E
5|$|STS-108 Endeavour {{visited the}} ISS, {{delivering}} over three tons of equipment, supplies, {{and a fresh}} crew to the orbiting outpost. The hatches were opened between Endeavour and the ISS Destiny Laboratory on December 7, enabling the ten crew members to greet one another. The Expedition 3 crew officially ended their 117-day residency on board the International Space Station on December 8 as their custom Soyuz seat-liners were transferred <b>to</b> <b>Endeavour</b> for the return trip home. The transfer of the Expedition 4 seat-liners to the Soyuz return vehicle attached to the station marked the official exchange of crews.|$|E

5|$|Articles 41–43 mandate the State <b>to</b> <b>endeavour</b> {{to secure}} to all {{citizens}} {{the right to}} work, a living wage, social security, maternity relief, and a decent standard of living. These provisions aim at establishing a socialist state as envisaged in the Preamble. Article 43 also places upon the State the responsibility of promoting cottage industries, {{and the federal government}} has, in furtherance of this, established several Boards for the promotion of khadi, handlooms etc., in coordination with the state governments. Article 39A requires the State to provide free legal aid to ensure that opportunities for securing justice are available to all citizens irrespective of economic or other disabilities. Article 43A mandates the State to work towards securing the participation of workers in the management of industries. The State, under Article 46, is also mandated to promote the interests of and work for the economic uplift of the scheduled castes and scheduled tribes and protect them from discrimination and exploitation. Several enactments, including two Constitutional amendments, have been passed to give effect to this provision.|$|E

25|$|In addition, the {{constitution}} grants the central government, acting through the President, {{the power to}} issue certain directives {{to the government of}} a state in relation to the use of minority languages for official purposes. The President may direct a State to officially recognise a language spoken in its territory for specified purposes and in specified regions, if its speakers demand it and satisfy him that a substantial proportion of the State's population desire its use. Similarly, States and local authorities are required <b>to</b> <b>endeavour</b> to provide primary education in the mother tongue for all linguistic minorities, regardless of whether their language is official in that State, and the President has the power to issue directions he deems necessary to ensure that they are provided these facilities.|$|E
25|$|On flight day 16, {{the members}} of space shuttle Endeavours STS-134 crew {{continued}} preparations for the shuttle's landing on flight day 17. Commander Mark Kelly, pilot Greg Johnson and mission specialist and flight engineer Roberto Vittori performed a checkout of Endeavours Flight Control Systems (FCS). They began by starting Auxiliary Power Unit 1 (APU 1), so they could test the flight systems such as the ailerons and rudder. The APU was used to provide hydraulic pressure to power the flight control systems. The astronauts next moved on to {{a test of the}} Reaction Control System (RCS) jets. This test saw Kelly, Johnson and Vittori fire each jet once. Meanwhile, Drew Feustel, Mike Fincke and Greg Chamitoff stowed items on the mid-deck for their return to Earth. Later in the crew day, they stowed the Ku band antenna for re-entry. The crew also performed several experiments, including an eye exam and the Ram Burn Observation (RAMBO2) experiments, and conducted a deorbit briefing to go over the procedures for the landing. The entire crew furthermore participated in in-flight interviews with ABC News, CBS News, CNN, NBC News and Fox News Radio, and sent a crew tribute <b>to</b> <b>Endeavour</b> down to the ground.|$|E
50|$|While at the station, {{the crew}} {{conducted}} one spacewalk and attached the Raffaello Multi-Purpose Logistics Module {{to the station}} so that about 2.7 metric tons (3 tons) of equipment and supplies could be unloaded.

St. Paul seemed to many of Mendelssohn's contemporaries to be his finest work, and sealed his European reputation.|$|E
500|$|The Discovery Expedition of 1901–04 was Captain Scott's first Antarctic command. Although {{according}} to Edward Wilson the {{intention was to}} [...] "reach the Pole if possible, or find some new land", {{there is nothing in}} Scott's writings, nor in the official objectives of the expedition, to indicate that the pole was a definite goal. However, a southern journey towards the pole was within Scott's formal remit to [...] "explore the ice barrier of Sir James Ross... and <b>to</b> <b>endeavour</b> to solve the very important physical and geographical questions connected with this remarkable ice formation".|$|E
500|$|While Thomas Killingbeck, a compositor, and Peter Bishop, a proofreader, {{were working}} for Richardson in his print shop during 1753, Richardson {{discovered}} that printers in Dublin had copies of The History of Sir Charles Grandison and began printing the novel before the English edition was to be published. Richardson suspected that they were involved with the unauthorized distribution of the novel and promptly fired them. Immediately following the firing, Richardson wrote to Lady Bradshaigh, 19 October 1753: [...] "the Want of the same Ornaments, or Initial Letters , in each Vol. will help to discover them , although they should put the Booksellers Names that I have affixed. I have got some Friends to write down to Scotland, <b>to</b> <b>endeavour</b> to seize their Edition, if offered to be imported". [...] There were four Dublin presses used to make unauthorized copies the novel, {{but none of them}} were able to add the ornaments that could effectively mimic Richardson's own. However, there were still worries about the unlicensed copies, and Richardson relied on seven additional printers to speed up the production of Grandison.|$|E

500|$|One {{component}} of Kalam's widespread popularity among diverse groups in India, and an enduring {{aspect of his}} legacy, is the syncretism he embodied in appreciating various elements of the many spiritual and cultural traditions of India. In addition to his faith in the Koran and Islamic practice, Kalam was well-versed in Hindu traditions; he learnt Sanskrit, read the Bhagavad Gita {{and he was a}} vegetarian. Kalam also enjoyed writing Tamil poetry, playing the veena (a South Indian string instrument), and listening to Carnatic devotional music every day. In 2002, in one of his early speeches to Parliament after becoming President, he reiterated his desire for a more united India, stating that [...] "uring the last one year I met a number of spiritual leaders of all religions ... I would like <b>to</b> <b>endeavour</b> to work for bringing about unity of minds among the divergent traditions of our country". Describing Kalam as a unifier of diverse traditions, Congress leader Shashi Tharoor stated, [...] "Kalam was a complete Indian, an embodiment of the eclecticism of India's heritage of diversity". BJP leader L. K. Advani concurred that Kalam was [...] "the best exemplar of the Idea of India, one who embodied the best of all the cultural and spiritual traditions that signify India's unity in immense diversity.
