At {{the time of}} the filing, Peterson said: [...] "I should have listened <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>wife.</b> She said, 'Don't buy Stereo Super Stores.' She was right." [...] Peterson said sales shrank 16 percent in the company's 1991 fiscal year compared to 1990, and that his business had been in the red every month but one in the 25 months since the buyout. Peterson said at the time: [...] "They should have been called Stereo Stupid Stores." ...|$|E
500|$|One further oddity in his {{writings}} is that {{in one of his}} works, the Commentary on the Seven Catholic Epistles, he writes in a manner that gives the impression he was married. The section in question is the only one in that work that is written in first-person view. Bede says: [...] "Prayers are hindered by the conjugal duty because as often as I perform what is due <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> I am not able to pray." [...] Another passage, in the Commentary on Luke, also mentions a wife in the first person: [...] "Formerly I possessed a wife in the lustful passion of desire and now I possess her in honourable sanctification and true love of Christ." [...] The historian Benedicta Ward argues that these passages are Bede employing a rhetorical device.|$|E

AllMusic gives the album five out of five stars, stating that the music is [...] "every bit as fun as the episode itself", praising the voices of Benson, Marsters and Head.

500|$|Smithers {{was partly}} {{based on how}} {{numerous}} Fox executives and staff members acted towards Barry Diller. The idea for Smithers' orientation was pitched by Sam Simon, who proposed that Smithers should be gay, but the writers should never draw {{too much attention to}} it and should try to keep it {{in the back of their}} heads. [...] Jay Kogen said [...] "Originally he was gay and black...But we thought it was too much so we just kept him gay." [...] The script for [...] "Blood Feud" [...] originally featured Smithers saying [...] "Just leave me enough to get home <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> and kids", but the line had to be cut for time. Smithers is voiced by Harry Shearer, who is also the voice of Mr. Burns. Shearer is often able to perform dialogue between the two characters in one take. Dan Castellaneta occasionally fills in for Shearer at table reads and voices Smithers. The name Waylon was first used in [...] "I Married Marge" [...] and comes from the puppeteer Wayland Flowers.|$|E
500|$|DeHavilland {{turned to}} Warner's wife Anne for help. Warner later recalled, [...] "Olivia, {{who had a}} brain like a {{computer}} concealed behind those fawn-like eyes, simply went <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> and they joined forces to change my mind." [...] Warner relented, and deHavilland was signed to the project {{a few weeks before}} the start of principal photography on January 26, 1939. Set in the American South during the 19th century, the film is about the strong-willed daughter of a Georgia plantation owner in love with the husband of her sister-in-law, Melanie, whose kindness stands in sharp contrast to those around her. According to film historian Tony Thomas, deHavilland's skillful and subtle performance effectively presents this character of selfless love and quiet strength in a way that keeps her vital and interesting throughout the film. Gone with the Wind had its world premiere in Atlanta, Georgia, on December 15, 1939, and was well received. Frank S. Nugent of The Times wrote that deHavilland's Melanie [...] "is a gracious, dignified, tender gem of characterization", and John C. Flinn, Sr., in Variety called her [...] "a standout". The film won 10 Academy Awards, including Best Picture, and deHavilland received her first nomination for Best Supporting Actress.|$|E

500|$|At around 9:30 on {{the night}} of September 27, 1868, Hindman was assassinated by one or more unknown assailants who fired through his parlor window while he was reading his {{newspaper}} with his children. The musket shots hit Hindman in the jaw, throat, and hands, and he died eight hours later due to significant blood loss. Before his death, Hindman gave a farewell speech to his neighbors and political supporters from the porch of his house. With [...] "perfect composure", Hindman told listeners to [...] "unite their courage and determination to bring peace to the people". Hindman hinted at the recent political debate with Powell Clayton as a possible motivation for the shooting and said, [...] "I do not know who killed me; but I can say, whoever it was, I forgive him." [...] He asked James H. O'Connor, the husband of Mollie's stepmother, to [...] "take care of my family and be a protector <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> and dear little ones". After O'Connor accepted, Hindman stated, [...] "I forgive everybody, and hope they will forgive me." [...] Afterwards, he was too weak to continue speaking, and he sat down on a lounge. He remained there until he died early next morning. The assassination was announced in all major newspapers throughout the state. William Woodruff of the Gazette said Hindman died as an [...] "able and distinguished man" [...] whose [...] "short but splendid career" [...] {{had a profound impact on}} Arkansan state politics.|$|E
500|$|Filming {{took place}} between 28 May and 13 July 1956. The film's budget, at £92,000, was much larger than that of The Quatermass Xperiment. The bigger budget was {{achieved}} by the advance sale of the distribution rights in the United States to United Artists. United Artists contributed some £64,000 towards {{the production of the}} film, as well as Brian Donlevy's $25,000 fee and his airfare to London from the US. The larger budget allowed for greater use of location filming in the making of the film than had been possible for its predecessor. The key location used was the oil refinery at Shell Haven in Stanford-le-Hope, Essex, on the Thames Estuary, which represented the secret Winnerden Flats complex. This was exactly the same location as used in the BBC television production of the story. Despite its size, the plant was run by {{a relatively small number of}} personnel, which made Guest's job of making the plant appear eerily deserted easier. Guest was also surprised at how relaxed the plant's management were about allowing him to stage the climactic gun battle at such a potentially flammable location. Focus puller Harry Oakes recalled, however, that a Newman-Sinclair clockwork camera had to be used for some scenes because of the danger posed by sparks from electrical equipment. The scenes of Vincent Broadhead emerging from one of the domes covered in the noxious black slime were particularly difficult to realise, necessitating many retakes. Tom Chatto, playing Broadhead, whose wife was a leading casting director, joked after the scene was finally completed, [...] "Remind me to talk <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> about casting me in this". The Shell Haven location was further enhanced by the use of matte paintings created by special effects designer Les Bowie to add the giant domes within which the aliens were incubated.|$|E

2500|$|After Salinger's {{death in}} 2010, Phyllis Westberg, who was Salinger's agent at Harold Ober Associates, stated that {{nothing has changed}} in terms of {{licensing}} film, television, or stage rights of his works. A letter written by Salinger in 1957 revealed that he was open to an adaptation of The Catcher in the Rye released after his death. He wrote: [...] "Firstly, {{it is possible that}} one day the rights will be sold. Since there's an ever-looming possibility that I won't die rich, I toy very seriously with the idea of leaving the unsold rights <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> and daughter as a kind of insurance policy. It pleasures me no end, though, I might quickly add, to know that I won't have to see the results of the transaction." [...] Salinger also wrote that he believed his novel was not suitable for film treatment, and that translating Holden Caulfield's first-person narrative into voice-over and dialogue would be contrived.|$|E

2500|$|A {{man named}} William Schnoebelen {{stated that he}} used to be a Wiccan Priest as well as a Satanic priest.

In 1989 he wrote an article, [...] "Straight Talk on Dungeons and Dragons", which was published by Chick Publications. He received a large number of letters and emails on the subject in subsequent years, and wrote a follow-up article in 2001 entitled [...] "Should a Christian Play Dungeons & Dragons?". These essays portray Dungeons & Dragons as a tool for New Age Satanic groups to introduce concepts and behaviors that are seen as contrary to Christian teaching and morality in general. Schnoebelen wrote: [...] "In the late 1970s, a couple of the game writers actually came <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> and I as prominent 'sorcerers' in the community.

2500|$|Jack London State Historic Park, near Glen Ellen, California, is {{situated}} on the eastern slope of Sonoma Mountain. The namesake of this California State Park is author Jack London whose home, Wolf House, was located here. [...] The building, a sizable stone structure, was destroyed by fire and its picturesque ruins are protected within the state park. Sonoma Mountain had a significant influence on Jack London and his writings. In 1910 Jack London purchased this 1,000 acre (4km2) property, known as the Beauty Ranch, for $26,000. He wrote that [...] "Next <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>wife,</b> the ranch is the dearest {{thing in the world}} to me." [...] He wanted the establishment to become a successful business enterprise. Writing, always a commercial enterprise with London, now became even more a means to an end: [...] "I write for no other purpose than to add to the beauty that now belongs to me. I write a book {{for no other reason than}} to add three or four hundred acres to my magnificent estate."

2500|$|On 13 May 1938, {{while riding}} his {{motorcycle}} {{down the streets}} of Tokyo, a very intoxicated Sorge clashed into a wall and was badly injured.

In 1938, Sorge reported to Moscow that the Battle of Lake Khasan was due to over-zealous officers in the Kwantung Army and there were no plans in Tokyo for a general war with the Soviet Union. Unaware that Berzin had been shot as a [...] "Trotskyite" [...] in July 1938, Sorge sent him a letter in October 1938 reading: [...] "Dear Comrade! Don't worry about us.
