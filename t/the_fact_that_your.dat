Step by step, gradually but surely, the English principle of the absolute legislative sovereignty of Parliament ... is being qualified ... The rule of law enforced by the courts is the ultimate controlling factor on which our constitution is based. <b>The</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>your</b> Lordships have been willing to hear this appeal and to give judgment upon it is another indication that the courts have a part to play in defining the limits of Parliament's legislative sovereignty.|$|E
500|$|Chulip {{received}} mostly average critical scores {{upon its}} release in North America. The game currently holds a 57% on the aggregate websites GameRankings and Metacritic. The ambitious gameplay of Chulip {{has been almost}} universally criticized. Ray Barnholt of 1UP.com, Ryan Davis of GameSpot, Micah Seff of IGN, and Gus Mastrapa of X-Play all labeled the often-unclear progression presented to the player as [...] "frustrating" [...] and [...] "tedious", requiring an excessive amount of patience. Mastrapa summarized, [...] "Since the game is on 24-hour clock a missed opportunity means having {{to wait until the}} next day to take another crack. Add <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>your</b> inexperienced, young avatar can die from heartbreak, resulting in a 'game over' screen and the loss of unsaved progress and you've got a recipe for annoyance." [...] Barnholt, Davis, and Seff did positively credit Natsume for the inclusion of the mini-strategy guide. Despite faulting the [...] "indistinct objectives", Davis found gratification in successful kisses. [...] "The whole kissing thing is absolutely fantastic in concept," [...] Davis stated, [...] "And there's something unsettling about your character's encouraged promiscuity." [...] However, Game Informer writer Ben Reeves described the game {{as one of the most}} poorly designed games he has ever played due to its lack of in-game direction and frequency of game overs. In January 2008, Game Informer listed Chulip one of the worst games of 2007.|$|E
2500|$|A {{representative}} from the Construction Forestry Mining and Energy Union did not respond kindly to a question from Henry during an interview on 31 August 2012 with the comment [...] "No apologies for <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>your</b> show has no viewers." ...|$|E

50|$|This type {{of pattern}} {{recognition}} {{can result in}} apophenia based on <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> since <b>your</b> brain is not looking for exact matches, it can pick up some characteristics of a match and assume it fits. This is more common with pareidolia than data collection.|$|R
2500|$|In 2012, the Catholic Church {{directly}} {{intervened in}} government plans in Croatia to introduce sex education teaching in schools (including {{the topic of}} homosexuality). Several parishes distributed leaflets at local Mass asking: [...] "Parents, do you care about <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>your</b> child will have to learn that a homosexual act is as natural and valuable as a sexual act {{between a man and}} a woman?" [...] Subsequently the teaching was suspended by Constitutional Court on the grounds that parents had the right to freely decide about the education of their children.|$|E
2500|$|Throughout the 1920s Chanler corresponded {{frequently}} {{with his old}} friend Ludwig von Höhnel, then living in retirement in Vienna, on the [...] "Jewish world conspiracy" [...] {{and the degree to}} which von Höhnel shared Chanler's antisemitic ideology, writing on March 22, 1923: [...] "You don't seem disturbed by <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>your</b> town is overrun by Jews." [...] Chanler accepted as authentic the widely recognized forgery, The Protocols of the Elders of Zion, and he employed agents to compile dossiers on Jewish public figures in the US and other countries.|$|E

6000|$|... "I don't {{know what}} you would have. I was serious enough. <b>The</b> <b>fact</b> is, <b>that</b> <b>your</b> father has delayed so long the payment of the promised money that the thing has fallen through of necessity. I {{do not know that}} I can blame the Company." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'From {{what we can}} hurriedly collect, {{it seems}} that she found the door of your house locked, and {{concluded}} that you had retired, <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> being <b>that</b> <b>your</b> servant, Mrs. Crickett, had gone out to supper.

6000|$|... "Cruel! What have I done? Tell me what cruelty. Have I beat you? Have {{you been}} starved? Have I not asked and implored your assistance,--only to be refused? <b>The</b> <b>fact</b> is <b>that</b> <b>your</b> father {{and you have}} found out that I am not a rich man, {{and you want to}} be rid of me.

6000|$|... "No, no, Lady Brackenstall--it is no use. You {{may have}} heard of any little {{reputation}} which I possess. I will stake it all on <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>your</b> story is an absolute fabrication." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{would not}} have a man marry a girl without making love to her. <b>The</b> <b>fact</b> is, mother, <b>that</b> <b>your</b> tastes and mine are not exactly the same; you like silent beauty, whereas I like talking beauty, and then--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... “But, man!” I expostulated, “you advance <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> it is <b>your</b> ship {{as though}} it were a moral right. You have never {{considered}} moral rights in your dealings with others. You surely do not dream that I’ll consider them in dealing with you?” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do, sir," [...] I replied. [...] "And now {{you may go}} below, and, when again {{you find}} it {{necessary}} to address me, you will please be so good as to bear in mind <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> I am <b>your</b> commanding officer, and as such entitled to a salute." ...|$|R

50|$|The {{title of}} the album {{was the focus of}} a joke on an episode of the sitcom Arrested Development that aired well over a decade after the CD's release. When magician Tony Wonder (played by Ben Stiller) {{had to come up with}} a name for his home video, he decided to name it Use Your Illusion II, citing <b>that</b> Use <b>Your</b> Illusion I had already been taken, {{apparently}} unaware of <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> Use <b>Your</b> Illusion II is also the name of an album.

6000|$|... "That," [...] said Arnold of Sewa, [...] "I {{put down}} entirely to <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> you and <b>your</b> friends, by not exercising tact, irritated the Governor, {{and made him}} unwilling to listen to anybody else. Nothing is more {{important}} in these affairs than tact. That's what you want--tact. But have it your own way. Don't mind me!" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Lady Delahaye," [...] I said, [...] "you must forgive my {{reminding}} {{you that}} {{on the occasion of}} your visit to us you did not attempt to conceal <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>your</b> feelings towards her were inimical.

6000|$|... “One {{would not}} presume to {{question}} the word of Colonel Morales,” said Appleby with rather more than a trace of irony. “In this case there was also <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>your</b> distinguished countrymen have already incurred a serious responsibility.

6000|$|... "There {{is neither}} {{insolence}} nor presumption in what I have done," [...] he answered, giving back the Marquis look for look and scowl for scowl. [...] "You deem it so because I am the secretary to the Marquis de Bellecour {{and she is}} the daughter of that same Marquis.

Not, then, as your secretary speaking to your daughter have I told this lady that I love her, but as a man speaking to a woman. To utter that should be--nay, is--the right of every man; to hear it should be honouring to every woman worthy of the name. In a primitive condition--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are {{the only}} {{rightful}} successor to the throne of Lutha," [...] he argued, [...] "other than Peter of Blentz. Your mother's marriage to a foreigner did not bar the succession of her offspring. Aside from <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> Peter of Blentz {{is out of the}} question, is <b>the</b> more important <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>your</b> line is closer to the throne than his. He knew it, and this knowledge was the real basis of his hatred of you." ...|$|R
5000|$|Nicknamed [...] "the Grasshopper", Gomersall {{was known}} for his thin legs inside tight shorts and his habit of {{ignoring}} on-field fights. First appointed to referee State of Origin by the Queensland Rugby League in 1982, Gomersall was often accused by New South Wales supporters of bias. A reporter from New South Wales once asked: [...] "How do you account for <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> in <b>your</b> nine matches Queensland won seven and NSW won only two?", Gomersall was said to have replied [...] "Well, surely anyone's entitled to two bad games."

6000|$|... "No doubt, at any rate, {{can arise}} {{that you are}} the child brought by this Mrs. Rooney to Kilkargan.

6000|$|... "Why," [...] Braile said, [...] "I don't {{see what}} you want of a miracle more than what you've had already. <b>The</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>your</b> cow didn't come up last night, and Abel couldn't find her in the woods-pasture this morning is miracle enough to prove that Dylks is God.

If you call it a hooey stick, you would yell [...] "hooey" [...] each time you want the direction to change.|$|R
6000|$|... "The most appalling {{thing to}} me is <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> not even <b>your</b> daughter's {{popularity}} can neutralize the gossip of a woman like Mrs. Belden.
