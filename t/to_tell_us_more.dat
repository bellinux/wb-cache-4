The expedition, which was sponsored by the Bertarelli Foundation, in partnership with Stanford University and the University of Western Australia, piloted an electronic tagging project to examine the feasibility of using remote technologies to monitor the movement of important pelagic species in the region. Five different types of electronic tags were deployed in this study, with a total of 99 electronic tags placed on 95 animals, along with the installation of an acoustic receiver array around two northern atolls to detect animal movements.|$|E

Richard Davidson has conducted research to determine which parts of the brain are involved in positive emotions. He found that the left prefrontal cortex is more activated when we are happy and is also associated with greater ability to recover from negative emotions as well as enhanced ability to suppress negative emotions. Interestingly, Davidson found that people can train themselves to increase activation in this area of their brains. [...] It is thought that our brain can change throughout our lives {{as a result of our}} experiences; this is known as neuroplasticity.|$|E

40|$|Living {{arrangements}} {{have the}} potential <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> far <b>more</b> than simply who lives with whom. Whether a senior lives alone, with a spouse, or with children will provide potentially distinct social support possibilities. From a policy perspective, the particular mix of these living arrangements also provides clues {{to the need for}} formal services. While work has been done on how income, gender and age shape the living arrangements of Canadian seniors, relatively little research has explored how ethnicity, language skill and immigration status further mediate living arrangements. Given the future combination of population aging and continued shifts in the source and type of immigration to Canada, additional research on how ethnicity and factors associated with immigration affect living arrangements is also warranted. In this paper I explore the relationship between characteristics of Canadian seniors and their living arrangements. Ethnicity and immigration are further explored by focussing on the living arrangements of Chinese-Canadian seniors. Data for Canadians aged 55 and older from the 1996 individual census Public Use Microdata File (PUMF) (n= 159, 361), General Social Survey Cycle 11 (GSS 11) (n= 12, 756) and National Population Health Survey (NPHS) (n= 13, 363) were used in this analysis. Logistic regressions using the PUMF and GSS 11 data suggest that while personal income and characteristics of immigrants play important roles in encouraging living alone among older Canadians, their effects do not nullify the role of culture among Chinese- Canadian seniors. Importantly, these effects vary substantially by gender and age. These findings underscore the heterogeneity of Canadian seniors, which is often overlooked in the design and delivery of services to this segment of the population. seniors; living arrangements; PUMF; GSS; NPHS...|$|R

40|$|Thirty years ago, {{the philosopher}} Jean-François Lyotard argued that science, lacking the {{resources}} to legitimate itself as true, had come to rely for its legitimacy on {{precisely the kind of}} knowledge it did not even consider to be knowledge: namely, non-scientific narrative knowledge.

Lyotard’s intention was not to position philosophy as ultimately being able <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>more</b> about science than science itself, but to emphasize that, in a process of transformation which had been taking place since at least the end of the 1950 s, such long-standing metanarratives had become obsolete...|$|E

Whether the latter message will be heard by those cognitive psychologists who, according to Algom, view sensory psychology as “the last bastion of fixed mechanistic (i. e., psychologically trivial) properties, best left to those unprepared or uninterested enough to deal with real psychology” (p. 10), remains to be seen...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} the study was to explain the {{explanatory}} power of EVA for shareholders value creation. The study provides empirical evidence on the relative and incremental information content of EVA and traditional performance measures, earnings, and cash flow. The inference from this paper is that IT companies should always try to maximize shareholders value. If this is not done then their stocks will not be able to stand in the market. This analysis helps us to dig below the surface numbers <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>more</b> about the underlying business and whether there is a prima facie case for using EVA as one of the range of performance measurement tools. The study focuses on Pre Recession time period. Design/methodology/approach: The sample of study comprises selected IT companies traded in the main NSE stock exchange. The sample selected for the study comprised of nine IT companies listed in NSE stock exchange from the period 2003 - 04 to 2007 - 08. This sample was selected on the basic of judgmental sampling technique. Cause and effect relationship between individual traditional measures as independent variable and EVA as dependent variable was established by linear regression method. A comparison of outcomes of previous studies with ours shows that significant results depend on finding the appropriate variables (stock prices versus stock returns) and the correct dynamics linking the dependent and the explanatory variable...|$|E

A crucial aspect of this diversification effort includes black male teachers. ^ The purpose of this study was to explore and examine the experiences and perspectives of African American male K- 12 teachers. In doing so, this study would help <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>more</b> about their identities, teachings and relationships with other educational staff and students. Other secondary focus areas include black male teacher experiences within their educational settings and how black male teachers describe their relationships with minority students-especially males. ^ In conducting the study one-on-one face-to-face interviews were conducted along with participant observations. Emergent themes that surfaced were: lack of black male teachers, being the only black male teacher, being a role model, being a disciplinarian, and teaching being a gendered and ethnic dominated profession. The participants highlighted issues that questioned notions of gender matching teachers and students along with debating the assurance of acceptance of black male teachers from minority students solely on the basis of their ethnic background. Additionally, participants described issues of ascribed and self-defined identities as black male teachers. ^ Findings in this study can be used by teacher preparation programs, educational policy makers and administrators to facilitate positive change in the continued diversification of America’s teacher workforce for the purpose of improving academic achievement for K- 12 students. ...|$|E
