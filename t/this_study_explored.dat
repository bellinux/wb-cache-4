5000|$|An {{affirmative action}} program at SUNY/Buffalo also allowed regular {{departments}} {{to compete for}} positions from which to hire women and this allowed for the hiring of two additional women faculty to join Kennedy in this Women's Studies enterprise. In 1972, literary scholar Lillian Robinson and historian Ellen Carol DuBois joined the faculty of American Studies, from which they worked to build Women's Studies. The collaboration between Kennedy, Robinson and DuBois, aided by two other faculty supporters of WSC - philosopher Carolyn Korsemeyer and educational sociologist Gail Paradise Kelly - resulted in the 1985 publication of Feminist Scholarship: Kindlng in the Groves of Academe. <b>This</b> <b>study</b> <b>explored</b> the [...] "challenges to the traditional disciplines" [...] of the quickly growing field of Women's Studies. During the early years, Kennedy defended the Women's Studies Program against charges that it was discriminatory (against men) {{and that it was}} intellectually biased (in favor of the equality of the sexes).|$|E

He returned to Cork in April 1979 as the second consultant physician in geriatric medicine at Cork University and St. Finbarr’s Hospitals, with teaching responsibilities to the medical school in UCC. He remains active in a range of spheres including being a member to the Board of the Health Information & Quality Authority and the Intern Network Coordinator for the South Intern Network, linked with UCC, as part of the National Intern Training programme. He is also member, and current Chairman, to the Board of Directors of St. Patrick’s Hospital (Cork) Ltd. Incorporating Marymount University Hospice and Chairman of the National Steering Committee of the Hospice friendly. In the PROSPER Study he is co-investigator, representing University College Cork. <b>This</b> <b>study</b> <b>explored</b> the benefits of Statin (in this case pravastatin) in the reducing cardiac events, stroke and cognitive impairment in older patients with a history of vascular disease or at risk of such events.

5000|$|In {{the article}} titled [...] "iDynoMiCS: {{next-generation}} individual-based modelling of biofilms", an agent-based model is presented that models the colonisation of bacteria onto a surface, {{leading to the}} formation of biofilms. The purpose of iDynoMiCS (standing for individual-based Dynamics of Microbial Communities Simulator) is to simulate the growth of populations and communities of individual microbes (small unicellular organisms such as bacteria, archaea and protists) that compete for space and resources in biofilms immersed in aquatic environments. iDynoMiCS can be used to seek to understand how individual microbial dynamics lead to emergent population- or biofilm-level properties and behaviours. Examining such formations is important in soil and river studies, dental hygiene studies, infectious disease and medical implant related infection research, and for understanding biocorrosion. An agent-based modelling paradigm was employed to make it possible to explore how each individual bacterium, of a particular species, contributes {{to the development of the}} biofilm. The initial illustration of iDynoMiCS considered how environmentally fluctuating oxygen availability affects the diversity and composition of a community of denitrifying bacteria that induce the denitrification pathway under anoxic or low oxygen conditions. The study explores the hypothesis that the existence of diverse strategies of denitrification in an environment can be explained by solely assuming that faster response incurs a higher cost. The agent-based model suggests that if metabolic pathways can be switched without cost the faster the switching the better. However, where faster switching incurs a higher cost, there is a strategy with optimal response time for any frequency of environmental fluctuations. This suggests that different types of denitrifying strategies win in different biological environments. Since this introduction the applications of iDynoMiCS continues to increase: a recent exploration of the plasmid invasion in biofilms being one example. <b>This</b> <b>study</b> <b>explored</b> the hypothesis that poor plasmid spread in biofilms is caused by a dependence of conjugation on the growth rate of the plasmid donor agent. Through simulation, the paper suggests that plasmid invasion into a resident biofilm is only limited when plasmid transfer depends on growth. Sensitivity analysis techniques were employed that suggests parameters relating to timing (lag before plasmid transfer between agents) and spatial reach are more important for plasmid invasion into a biofilm than the receiving agents growth rate or probability of segregational loss. Further examples that utilise iDynoMiCS continue to be published, including use of iDynoMiCS in modelling of a Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm with glucose substrate.|$|E
