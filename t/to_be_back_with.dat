5|$|Meanwhile, Jaime {{talks with}} Edmure Tully, {{trying to win}} his {{cooperation}} by tempting him with seeing his newborn son, whom he has never seen, and offering to send {{him and his family}} to Casterly Rock, away from the Freys. Edmure ridicules Jaime and all of his past misdeeds, and asks him how he can live with himself. Jaime responds how he wants to take Riverrun <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> Cersei, and he is willing to do anything to achieve it, even if it means killing every Tully he finds, including Edmure and his son. Jaime then sends Edmure to parley with the Blackfish. Despite the Blackfish's protests, the Tully soldiers allow Edmure entry into the castle. Edmure then orders his men to surrender Riverrun, and also orders the Blackfish's capture. The Blackfish helps Brienne and Podrick escape, but stays behind to fight to the end.|$|E
25|$|The Backstreet Boys finally {{announced}} that Richardson had rejoined them permanently during {{a show in}} London on April 29, 2012. A few days later, McLean and Littrell revealed on separate occasions that Richardson had returned since 2010, before NKOTBSB Tour started. He had been in talks to join the tour but ultimately decided not to. They supported his decision and kept his return a secret until the tour was over. The group spoke positively about Richardson's return, stating that they couldn't be happier to have him back. Richardson himself was thrilled <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> his old bandmates, saying {{that they have a}} chemistry and a bond.|$|E
500|$|After {{losing his}} job at Kentucky, Collier said he was unsure {{what he would do}} next. [...] "Right now I feel I would like to remain in {{football}} if the opportunity presents itself," [...] he said. Two weeks later, Brown brought him back onto the Cleveland Browns staff as an offensive assistant. Collier and Brown had remained close friends during his time at Kentucky. Collier attended the Browns' training camps in Ohio during the summers, and Brown's family visited Collier on occasion in Lexington. Collier said he was happy <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> the Browns, saying it was [...] "like returning home". Brown praised Collier's teaching and called him a [...] "scientific football man" [...] and [...] "one of my closest friends".|$|E

The song [...] "Girl" [...] <b>was</b> going <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>backed</b> <b>with</b> [...] "You're Going to Lose That Girl" [...] as Capitol 4506. Picture sleeves for the single were printed, but the record was cancelled in early October 1977.|$|R

500|$|Moe has a Clockwork Orange-style gang in London {{along with}} Lenny, Carl and Homer. Homer falls {{for a girl}} (Marge) who convinces him to quit and the gang falls apart. Years later, Moe is {{attacked}} {{at home in a}} style similar to his gang's former ways and asks Homer to bring the gang back together; Lenny and Carl (who have become police officers) join them. They attack an Eyes Wide Shut-style masked orgy [...] and several other of Stanley Kubrick's films are parodied in a fight sequence. As Moe gets beaten by two party guests, he narrates that he was [...] "Beaten, bruised" [...] and [...] "couldn't score at an orgy" [...] but was happy <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> his old gang. Kubrick is then shown in an editing room and asks for the entire film to be re-shot.|$|E
500|$|The mystery {{surrounding}} Mary Alice and {{her family}} was the main storyline in the first season of the series, and it is resolved in the first season finale. Cherry had wanted {{there to be a}} [...] "definite end" [...] to the mystery, hoping to avoid similar viewer fatigue that Twin Peaks suffered after drawing out its central mystery past its first season. ABC executives initially protested the writers' decision to have Mary Alice purposefully kill [...] Deirdre Taylor (Jolie Jenkins), the woman whose child she had illegally purchased, prompting the writers to make Deirdre violent in order to justify Mary Alice's actions. Although Mary Alice {{and her family}} do not have much of a leading storyline thereafter, the mystery surrounding the character's suicide in the inaugural season is said to have informed and influenced every other season of the series. In 2006, when asked during an interview what viewers could expect from Mary Alice for the series' third season, Strong said that the character was [...] "going <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> an attitude", stating: [...] "She will be a little less surreal, ethereal and a little more sassy, which means the show is going to be sassier." [...] During the series' final season in 2011, the actress appears as Mary Alice's ghost to her suicidal friend Bree (Marcia Cross). Strong enjoyed filming that particular scene, as it was the only scene during the entire series that featured solely Mary Alice and Bree. She described the scene as one of her personal favorites and called it an [...] "extraordinary opportunity", saying: [...] "In a way, Mary Alice becomes [...] conscious and her guide and her muse in knowing what to do with her life. And it was an exquisitely written scene and it was really, I think in my experience on the show, one of my favorite scenes I have ever shot." ...|$|E

This was soon after sponsor Stanley-DEWALT pulled out of RPM to join Carl Edwards' car at Joe Gibbs Racing but it is unknown if Ambrose's {{decision}} to depart {{had anything to do with}} Stanley-DEWALT pulling out their sponsorship of the 9 team. Not long after it was announced that Ambrose would be returning to Australia after the 2014 NASCAR season ends for what Ambrose and Petty described as [...] "personal reasons." ...|$|E

"An Original Break" [...] sampled [...] "Big Beat" [...] and [...] "Rupert The Bear" [...] amongst {{other things}} {{in order to take}} a sarcastic look at the lack of {{originality}} in sampling at the time. In contrast to this, their follow-up ("Centre Stage") opted for harder samples and battle rhymes. [...] "Centre Stage", which <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>backed</b> <b>with</b> [...] "Woke with Nothin'", <b>was</b> due <b>to</b> <b>be</b> released as LIB003. However owing to geographical differences, other than a cassette sampler, the record did not receive an official release until 2009 and the relaunch of Liberty Grooves.|$|R

[...] (Anderson): [...] "It's not a very good occasion really, we have to hurry this because the lifeboat is standing by.

2500|$|D'Antoni's {{coaching}} {{debut with}} the Lakers was delayed as he recovered from knee replacement surgery. [...] He had surgery weeks before on October 31, as he originally expected {{that he was}} taking a year off from coaching and would have months to recover. Bickerstaff continued to be the Lakers' interim coach; he finished with a [...] 4–1 record, winning his last two as D'Antoni started leading team practices. Older brother Dan D'Antoni was named a new assistant coach and also assisted. In his first press conference, D'Antoni predicted that the Lakers, then 3–5 and ranked 20th in scoring with 96.5 points per game, should instead be scoring [...] "110–115 points a game". He wanted to revive Showtime. He reiterated general manager Mitch Kupchak's belief that the Lakers were built to win an NBA championship that season. D'Antoni was glad <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> Nash, noting his unsuccessful stint with the New York Knicks without him. On November 20, he coached his first game—nine days after he was hired—in a 95–90 win against the Brooklyn Nets. The Lakers matched their worst start on the road (0–4) since the 1995–96 season, but snapped the streak with a 115–89 win over the Dallas Mavericks; it was also their first 100-point effort in the first four games under D'Antoni.|$|E

5000|$|Perhaps due to {{the slow}} sales of the band's own songs, their manager brought demos of two songs by then-unknown {{songwriter}} Mars Bonfire to the band to consider for their third single. They selected [...] "Sweet Child of Nothingness" [...] as the [...] "A" [...] side of their third single, <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>backed</b> <b>with</b> another original composition as the [...] "B" [...] side. The other song <b>was</b> [...] "Born <b>to</b> <b>be</b> Wild," [...] which did not impress Jim Quarles; in 1968, this would become a smash hit by Steppenwolf. The band, at this point, also began playing across the Sunset Strip but were limited in venues due to still being minors.|$|R

60|$|She {{was ready}} to weep with vexation. Such meagre reward for four days' waiting, and {{assuming}} {{all the time that}} she loved! He was a nice boy and all that, she knew, but he needn't have been in so disgraceful a hurry. But Joe had not reached the corner before he wanted <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> her again. He just wanted to look at her. He had no thought that it was love. Love? That was when young fellows and girls walked out together. As for him--And then his desire took sharper shape, and he discovered that that was the very thing he wanted her to do. He wanted to see her, to look at her, and well could he do all this if she but walked out with him. Then that was why the young fellows and girls walked out together, he mused, as the week-end drew near. He had remotely considered this walking out to be a mere form or observance preliminary to matrimony. Now he saw the deeper wisdom in it, wanted it himself, and concluded therefrom that he was in love.|$|E
