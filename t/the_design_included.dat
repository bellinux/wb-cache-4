5|$|The RTV-A-2 Hiroc (high-altitude rocket) was the United States' {{first attempt}} at an {{intercontinental}} ballistic missile (ICBM). The project was initially under the name MX-774, however the project was canceled in 1947, and leftover funds were used to build and launch three missiles, which were renamed to RTV-A-2 Hiroc. <b>The</b> <b>design</b> <b>included</b> several innovations; the gimballed engine provided guidance control, the internal gas pressure was used to support the airframe and the nose cap was separable. All of these concepts were later used on the Atlas missile.|$|E
5|$|Lockheed {{designed}} the Cheyenne as a compound helicopter, which combines a helicopter with fixed-wing features for increased performance, usually speed. <b>The</b> <b>design</b> <b>included</b> {{features such as}} a rigid main rotor, low-mounted wings, and a pusher propeller. The Cheyenne was powered by a General Electric T64 turboshaft engine. Thrust was provided by a pusher propeller {{at the rear of}} the aircraft. At high speeds, the amount of lift provided by the wings, along with thrust from the pusher prop, reduced the aerodynamic loading of the rotor. At such speeds, the rotor produced 20% of the lift and could be adjusted by collective pitch control changes. Rotor tilt was controlled through gyroscopic precession. The Cheyenne achieved speeds over 200knots (230mph, 370km/h), but as a compound helicopter was unable to qualify for speed records in helicopter categories.|$|E
5|$|Detailed {{design on}} {{the first stage of}} the freeway, from the Narrows Bridge to Sutherland Street at the {{northern}} edge of the city, began in 1960, and took several years to be completed. <b>The</b> <b>design</b> <b>included</b> a complex interchange at the Narrows Bridge that was to be built on reclaimed land that was mostly soft mud. Ground improvement works, which included the installations of 43,000 sand drains, began in 1964; demolition of buildings in the freeway's path commenced in 1965. The freeway was completed in three sections, under three separate contracts. Construction on the central section from Mount Street to Wellington Street started on 18 November 1966, following a groundbreaking ceremony conducted by Premier David Brand. It was opened to traffic two years later, connected to the Narrows Bridge via a temporary Bailey Bridge over Mounts Bay Road. The new road carried up to 1400 vehicles per hour during peak hours.|$|E

5|$|Henry {{rebuilt the}} {{principal}} castle gateway in about 1510 and constructed {{a tennis court}} {{at the base of}} the motte in the Upper Ward. He also built a long terrace, called the North Wharf, along the outside wall of the Upper Ward; constructed of wood, it was designed to provide a commanding view of the River Thames below. <b>The</b> <b>design</b> <b>included</b> an outside staircase into the king's apartments, which made the monarch's life more comfortable at the expense of considerably weakening the castle's defences. Early in his reign, Henry had given the eastern Lady Chapel to Cardinal Wolsey for Wolsey's future mausoleum. Benedetto Grazzini converted much of this into an Italian Renaissance design, before Wolsey's fall from power brought an end to the project, with contemporaries estimating that around £60,000 (£295million in 2008 terms) had been spent on the work. Henry continued the project, but it remained unfinished when he himself was buried in the chapel, in an elaborate funeral in 1547.|$|E

With its extensive waterside site, superb location, and views of the Menai Strait and Snowdonia, it is the only Anglesey site to be classed as Grade I in the Cadw/ICOMOS Register of Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest in Wales. It is within the Anglesey Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and is within an Environmentally sensitive area.|$|E
25|$|Initially, the {{aircraft}} {{was to use}} Frank Whittle's latest engine, the Power Jets W.2/700, which would only reach supersonic speed in a shallow dive. To develop a fully supersonic version of {{the aircraft}}, an innovation incorporated was a reheat jetpipe – also known as an afterburner. Extra fuel was to be burned in the tailpipe to avoid overheating the turbine blades, making use of unused oxygen in the exhaust. Finally, <b>the</b> <b>design</b> <b>included</b> another critical element, {{the use of a}} shock cone in the nose to slow the incoming air to the subsonic speeds needed by the engine.|$|E

25|$|In service, {{the quad}} turrets {{proved to be}} less {{reliable}} than was hoped for. Wartime haste in building, insufficient clearance between the rotating and fixed structure of the turret, insufficient full calibre firing exercises and extensive arrangements to prevent flash from reaching the magazines made it mechanically complex, leading to problems during prolonged actions. In order to bring ammunition into the turret at any degree of train, <b>the</b> <b>design</b> <b>included</b> a transfer ring between the magazine and turret; this did not have sufficient clearance {{to allow for the}} ship bending and flexing. Improved clearances, improved mechanical linkages, and better training led to greater reliability in the quadruple turrets but they remained controversial.|$|E

The division was spread out across Western Command's area of responsibility {{with at least one}} battalion based in Bowerham Barracks, Lancaster, Lancashire and another based around Shropshire. The Imperial War Museum comments that the division insignia of a troopship was derived from [...] "one of the prime functions of the Division [...] to find drafts for overseas postings". <b>The</b> <b>design</b> <b>included</b> [...] "two long and prominent bow waves from the ship", which resulted in the troops giving it the nickname the [...] "torpedoed troopship".

500|$|Two {{years after}} the first {{monument}} was destroyed by the police, a new Shaheed Minar (Monument of Martyrs) was constructed in 1954 to commemorate the protesters who lost their lives. Work on a larger monument designed by the architect Hamidur Rahman began in 1957 {{with the support of the}} United Front ministry. Hamidur Rahman's model consisted of a large complex in the yard of the Dhaka Medical College Hostel. <b>The</b> <b>design</b> <b>included</b> a half-circular column [...] symbolizing a mother with her martyred sons standing at the dais in the center of the monument. Although the imposition of martial law in 1958 interrupted the work, the monument was completed and inaugurated on 21 February 1963 by Abul Barkat's mother, Hasina Begum. Pakistani forces demolished the monument during the Bangladesh Liberation War of 1971, but the Bangladeshi government reconstructed it in 1973. Ekushey Television, the first private terrestrial TV channel of Bangladesh was named after the Event of 21 February.|$|E

500|$|In the prequel game Devil May Cry 3, Dante's {{attitude}} was emphasized {{to reflect a}} younger and more arrogant character than in previous installments. The Devil Trigger forms for Dante was designed by Kazuma Kaneko from Atlus. Gameplay-wise he was made {{to be easy to}} control contrasting Vergil who was harder yet stronger. Devil May Cry 4s producer Hiroyuki Kobayashi noted prior to the release of that game that they wanted to make Dante seem significantly more powerful than the game's other protagonist, Nero. This was done in order to create an evident difference between the strength of a [...] "veteran" [...] when compared to a [...] "rookie". Another reason for this portrayal is based on the series' continuity, which dictated that Dante display the power he would possess after the events of the first game and its prequel, Devil May Cry 3. In this game Dante was designed by Tatsuya Yoshikawa who enjoyed the character in his original appearance to the point of calling him [...] "the ultimate Hollywood action superstar." [...] Yoshikawa discussed with the staff to make Dante older, more mature and more experienced to and have him look between his 30s and 40s. <b>The</b> <b>design</b> <b>included</b> multiple details such as Dante's stubble that reflected his [...] "cool" [...] personality as he did not care about shaving.|$|E
500|$|Lightning {{was created}} by Motomu Toriyama, the {{director}} of Final Fantasy XIII. Her character design was by regular Final Fantasy artist Tetsuya Nomura, who had previously served as the character designer for Final Fantasy VIII and X. Nomura has said that multiple designs—including some by staff members other than himself—were considered for Lightning, while Toriyama has claimed that Nomura's first draft [...] "looked so cool and strong {{that there was no}} need for any retakes." [...] Because of the graphical capacities of Final Fantasy XIIIs prospective platforms, Nomura was able to include far more detail in Lightning's design than in his previous character designs, such as her cape and facial features. This necessitated far more effort on his part. Commenting on an early form of her design, Nomura explained that she is essentially a [...] "cool character", in that she is serious and unforgiving. However, he could not make the character too masculine for fear of losing player empathy. Characteristics from earlier versions of <b>the</b> <b>design</b> <b>included</b> blond or silver hair and Asian-looking facial features. Her final art was made less Asian-looking than these early drafts and her hair color changed to pink, while Hope Estheim was given silver hair. Lightning's final hair color and hairstyle were intended to reflect her femininity, and to counterbalance her athletic body. Creating her promotional CG render was fairly easy due to the amount of details available concerning her.|$|E
500|$|After {{the tunnel}} {{proposal}} was rejected, {{it was once}} again proposed in February 1996 after Wynn officially announced plans for the new resort. The City of Atlantic City requested bids {{for the sale of}} the property in the northern section of the city near the marina, which at one time served as the city's landfill. Wynn won the bid against Donald Trump, {{chief executive officer of the}} Trump Organization. As disputes over the tunnel construction continued, Mirage Resorts announced they were given the options of purchasing the properties required for building the tunnel. Mirage Resorts deemed building the proposed [...] "off-island connector" [...] as [...] "virtually impossible", stating how permits would be difficult to obtain with a land-based alternative available, and the tunnel was determined to be the best option for construction of the Connector. The tunnel was designed to have as little impact on the surrounding environment as possible, with both portals on opposite ends of the community. <b>The</b> <b>design</b> <b>included</b> both portals on opposite ends of the community, with landscaping added between the construction site and adjacent homes. Deliveries of raw materials would take place by barge and construction vehicles would not be traveling via any local streets. Mirage subsidiary president Richard [...] "Skip" [...] Bronson referred to the project as [...] "the nicest tunnel you've never seen." [...] Some opponents described the project as an effort to destroy a stable, middle-class African-American community, while others supported the project as a means of lessening traffic and creating jobs at the new Mirage casino.|$|E
