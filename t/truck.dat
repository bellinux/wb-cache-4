50|$|Downhill longboarders usually use Reverse Kingpin <b>Trucks</b> (RKP), whereas skateboarders use Traditional Kingpin <b>Trucks.</b> RKP <b>trucks</b> tend to hold {{traction}} {{better and}} {{are easier to}} handle at speed, whereas TKP <b>trucks</b> are more suited for tricks, bowl skating and usually sport a lower ride height. Other forms of <b>trucks</b> have been seen in downhill but remain on the sidelines. These would include torsion <b>trucks</b> (seismic) and CAM <b>trucks</b> (Other Planet). Downhill <b>trucks</b> are separated into two further categories: Cast and Precision. Cast <b>trucks</b> are the economical choice {{as well as the}} most common, although Precision <b>Trucks</b> are becoming more common. Cast <b>trucks</b> are usually a gravity cast aluminum with a solid steel axle that is non-removable. Due to the casting process cast <b>trucks</b> have 'slop' which is caused by small gaps in between parts. This causes small shifts and movements at speed and results in slightly diminished control. Cast <b>trucks</b> are also prone to warping slightly, causing uneven contact pressure on the wheels. Precision <b>trucks</b> can counter these limitations at a much higher price tag, although not all brands achieve this equally. Precision <b>trucks</b> are milled out of Aluminum billet and usually house two separate axles.|$|R
