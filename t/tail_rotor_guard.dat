40|$|Variable <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> {{speed is}} {{investigated}} {{as a method}} for reducing <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> power, and improving helicopter performance. A helicopter model able to predict the main <b>rotor</b> and <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> powers is presented, and the flight test data of the UH- 60 A helicopter is used for validation. The predictions of the main and <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> powers are generally in good agreement with flight tests, which justifies {{the use of the}} present method in analyzing main and <b>tail</b> <b>rotors.</b> Reducing the main rotor speed can result in lower main rotor power at certain flight conditions. However, it increases the main rotor torque and the corresponding required <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> thrust to trim, which then decreases the yaw control margin of the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor.</b> In hover, the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> {{may not be able to}} provide enough thrust to counter the main rotor torque, if it is slowed to follow the main rotor speed. The main rotor speed corresponding to the minimum main rotor power increases, if the change of <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> power in hover is considered. As a helicopter translated to cruise, the induced power decreases, and the profile power increases, with the profile power dominating the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor.</b> Reducing the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> speed in cruise reduces the profile power to give a 37 % reduction in total <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> power and a 1. 4 % reduction to total helicopter power. In high speed flight, varying the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> speed is ineffective for power reduction. The power reduction obtained by the variable <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> speed is reduced for increased helicopter weight...|$|R
40|$|A {{model test}} was {{conducted}} {{to determine the effects}} of aerodynamic interaction between main <b>rotor,</b> <b>tail</b> <b>rotor,</b> and vertical fin on helicopter performance and noise in hover out of ground effect. The experimental data were obtained from hover tests performed with a. 151 scale Model 222 main <b>rotor,</b> <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> and vertical fin. Of primary interest was the effect of location of the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> with respect to the main rotor. Penalties on main rotor power due to interaction with the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> ranged up to 3 % depending upon <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> location and orientation. Penalties on <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> power due to fin blockage alone ranged up to 10 % for pusher <b>tail</b> <b>rotors</b> and up to 50 % for tractor <b>tail</b> <b>rotors.</b> The main rotor wake had only a second order effect on these tail rotor/fin interactions.

50|$|The <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> {{drive system}} {{consists}} of a shaft powered from the main transmission and a gearbox mounted {{at the end of}} the tail boom. The drive shaft may consist of one long shaft or a series of shorter shafts connected at both ends with flexible couplings, that allow the drive shaft to flex with the tail boom. The gearbox {{at the end of the}} tailboom provides an angled drive for the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> and may also include gearing to adjust the output to the optimum rotational speed for the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor,</b> measured in rotations per minute (RPM). On larger helicopters with a tail pylon, intermediate gearboxes are used to transition the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> drive shaft from along the tailboom to the top of the pylon. The <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> pylon may also serve as a vertical stabilizing airfoil, to alleviate the power requirement for the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> in forward flight. The <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> pylon may also serve to provide limited antitorque within certain airspeed ranges, in the event that the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> or the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> flight controls fail.

40|$|The <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> of a {{helicopter}} with a single main rotor configuration can experience {{a significant reduction in}} thrust when the aircraft operates in crosswind flight. Brown’s vorticity transport model has been used to simulate a main <b>rotor</b> and <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> system translating at a sideslip angle that causes the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> to interact with the main rotor tip vortices as they propagate downstream at the lateral extremities of the wake. The <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> is shown to exhibit a distinct directionally dependent mode during which <b>tail</b> <b>rotors</b> that are configured so that the blades travel forward {{at the top of the}} disk develop less thrust than <b>tail</b> <b>rotors</b> with the reverse sense of rotation. The range of flight speeds over which this mode exists is shown to vary considerably with the vertical location of the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor.</b> At low flight speeds, the directionally dependent mode occurs because the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> is immersed within not only the downwash from the main rotor but also the rotational flow associated with clusters of largely disorganized vorticity within the main rotor wake. At higher flight speeds, however, the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> is immersed within a coherent supervortex that strongly influences the velocity field surrounding the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor...</b>|$|R

40|$|Purpose – This study aims to {{investigate}} the effects of mass and stiffness imbalance in a <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> induced by damage in forward flight. Design/methodology/approach – An aeroelastic analysis based on finite element {{in space and time}} and capable of modeling dissimilar blades is carried out to study the effect of damage occurring in one, two, and three blades in a four-bladed <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> system in forward flight.

40|$|A {{study was}} made of {{helicopter}} <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> noise, particularly that due to interactions with the main rotor tip vortices, and with the fuselage separation mean wake. The <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> blade-main rotor tip vortex interaction is modelled as an airfoil of infinite span cutting through a moving vortex. The vortex and the geometry information required by the analyses are obtained through a free wake geometry analysis of the main rotor. The acoustic pressure-time histories for the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> blade-vortex interactions are then calculated. These acoustic results are compared to <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> loading and thickness noise, and {{are found to be}} significant to the overall <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> noise generation. Under most helicopter operating conditions, large acoustic pressure fluctuations can be generated due to a series of skewed main rotor tip vortices passing through the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> disk.

50|$|The <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> {{is powered}} by the helicopter's main power plant, and rotates at a speed {{proportional}} {{to that of the}} main rotor. In both piston and turbine powered helicopters, the main <b>rotor</b> and the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> are mechanically connected through a freewheeling clutch system, which allows the rotors to keep turning {{in the event of an}} engine failure by mechanically de-linking the engine from both the main and <b>tail</b> <b>rotors.</b> During autorotation, the momentum of the main rotor continues to power the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> and allow directional control. To optimize its function for forward flight, the blades of a <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> have no twist to reduce the profile drag, because the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> is mounted with its axis of rotation perpendicular to the direction of flight.|$|R

40|$|Balancing is a {{rotating}} component {{is critical in}} any mechanism. Devoid of proper balancing, any vehicle-be it in air, land or sea, it will affect stability, control and safety. The same goes for rotor crafts. Imbalance of the helicopter <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> system leads to vibrations in the entire vehicle and may cause accident. Typically, for the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> of a helicopter, the blade {{is a source of}} vibration on the tail boom.

50|$|Based on {{the success}} of Harbin Z-9 and HC120, fenestron {{configuration}} was originally adopted for the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor.</b> However, due to the inherent disadvantages of the design, such as higher power requirement, higher construction and maintenance cost, higher resistance and weight, fenestron design was dropped after test flights, and a more conventional <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> configuration was adopted. The 4-blade <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> is similar to the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> of AH-64, with two pairs at unequal distance instead of 4 blades at the equal distance, and one of the main purposes of such arrangement was to reduce noise.

30|$|In {{order to}} predict the {{aerodynamic}} noise, aerodynamic characteristics of the ducted <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> should be obtained first. Along {{with the development of}} the ducted <b>tail</b> <b>rotor,</b> many researchers have studied the aerodynamic characteristics of various types of ducted <b>tail</b> <b>rotors</b> (Rajagopalan and Keys 1997; Bandoh et al. 1998; Vuillet and Morelli 1986). In recent years, the main method which investigates the aerodynamic performance of ducted <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> is CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamic) method. Among those CFD methods, momentum source method is one of the commonly used methods. The momentum source with functional relationship to the local flow conditions represents the spanning rotor in flow field and are added to the N-S equations by UDF procedure. Cao and Yu (2005) used it to solve the numerical simulation of turbulent flow around ducted <b>tail</b> <b>rotor.</b> The method not only can predict the flow field but also investigate the performance of the ducted <b>tail</b> <b>rotors.</b> Song et al. (2009) applied it to analyze the aerodynamic characteristics of ducted <b>tail</b> <b>rotor.</b> To obtain the aerodynamic characteristics of the ducted <b>tail</b> <b>rotor,</b> the author solved the N-S equation added by the source. The numerical solutions were verified by the experimental data, and some aerodynamic characteristics of the ducted <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> were also discussed. Even though momentum source method is quite successful for the prediction of the aerodynamic performance of ducted <b>tail</b> <b>rotor,</b> detailed three dimensional flow features cannot be accurately predicted. Because of the approximation of the blade shape parameters, the accuracy of the momentum source method is still limited.

Because the Picoo Z uses independent motors for the main and <b>tail</b> <b>rotors,</b> this interconnection (mixing) is electronically provided. Despite this, many users find that they must apply constant left or right stick to cause the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> to spin at the appropriate speed to prevent it from spinning wildly along the rotor axis.
