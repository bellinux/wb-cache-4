Colorado needs to be able to compete with our neighboring states. We do not want <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>anything</b> away from them. We do not want them to get way out ahead of us, either, because these interstate highways are going to be very attractive highways for the East and West to travel on.|$|E
5|$|Anxious {{for their}} safety Kirill and Victoria decided {{that the best thing}} to do was to leave Russia. They chose Finland as the best {{possible}} place to go. Although a territory of the Russian Empire, Finland possessed its own government and constitution, so in a way it would be like being in Russia and not being at the same time. They had already been once invited to Haikko, a beautiful estate, near Borgå, a small town on the south coast of Finland, not far away from Helsinki. The Provisional Government permitted them to leave, though they were not allowed <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>anything</b> of value with them. They sewed jewels into the family's clothing, hoping it would not be discovered by the authorities. They were permitted to board a train without incident in the first week of June 1917.|$|E

Many of the FSNs had sought refuge in the embassy {{with their families and}} about 30 were hired as guards and protected the embassy throughout the ordeal.

25|$|Although {{aware that}} he was a {{potential}} IRA assassination target, Gow declined <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>anything</b> more than routine security precautions. Unlike most British MPs of that era, he left his telephone number and home address in the local telephone directory. In the early hours of 30 July 1990, a bomb was planted under Gow's Austin Montego car, which was parked in the driveway of his house in Hankham, near Pevensey in East Sussex. The 4½-lb Semtex bomb detonated at 08:39 as Gow reversed out of his driveway, leaving him with severe wounds to his lower body. He died ten minutes later.|$|E
25|$|However, between 1770 and 1774, Fox's {{seemingly}} promising {{career in}} the political establishment was spoiled. In February 1770, Fox {{was appointed to the}} board of the Admiralty by Lord North, but on the 15th of the same month he resigned due to his enthusiastic opposition to the government's Royal Marriages Act, the provisions of which – incidentally – cast doubt on the legitimacy of his parents' marriage. On 28 December 1772, North appointed Fox to the board of the Treasury and again he surrendered his post, in February 1774, over the Government's allegedly feeble response to the contemptuous printing and public distribution of copies of parliamentary debates. Behind these incidents lay his family's resentment towards Lord North for refusing to elevate the Holland barony to an earldom. But the fact that such a young man could seemingly treat ministerial office so lightly was noted at court. George III, also observing Fox's licentious private behaviour, took it to be presumption and judged that Fox could not be trusted <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>anything</b> seriously.|$|E

He delighted in engaging in behaviour that seemed entirely at odds with traditional images of enlightened individuals; his early lectures in particular were famous for their humor and their refusal <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>anything</b> seriously.
