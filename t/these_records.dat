5|$|All recent {{specimens}} of the Borneo shark {{have been collected}} solely from fishery landing sites at Mukah in Sarawak, despite thorough surveys across the rest of Borneo (including at the locality of the type specimen). Thus, its range may now be restricted to shallow, inshore waters in northwestern Borneo. Of the five earlier specimens, four came from Borneo and one from Zhoushan Island in China, hinting at a wider historical distribution. This species was also recorded from Borongan in the Philippines in 1895, and Java in 1933; <b>these</b> <b>records</b> cannot be substantiated {{and there have been}} no subsequent sightings from these areas.|$|E
5|$|At its opening, Chang {{claimed the}} record for the tallest {{vertical}} loop of any roller coaster in the world. At the time, it was the world's tallest, fastest and longest stand-up coaster. It also claimed records for the largest drop and the most inversions on a stand-up roller coaster. All of <b>these</b> <b>records</b> had eclipsed those set by Mantis, which opened at Cedar Point in 1996. In 1998 Riddler's Revenge opened at Six Flags Magic Mountain, and Chang surrendered its titles.|$|E
5|$|It set {{records for}} the least time to reach $500, $600, and $700 million {{worldwide}} (in 10, 12 and 16 days, respectively). The first of <b>these</b> <b>records</b> was first surpassed by Dark of the Moon {{and the other two}} by Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2. After 46 days in theaters (July 2, 2011), it became the eighth film in cinema history and the fourth film released by Walt Disney Studios to cross the $1-billion-mark. It set a record for the fastest Disney-distributed film to reach the milestone (first surpassed by Marvel's The Avengers) and it is the fifth-fastest film overall to achieve this.|$|E

5|$|The dodos on this islet may not {{necessarily}} {{have been the last}} members of the species. The last claimed sighting of a dodo was reported in the hunting records of Isaac Johannes Lamotius in 1688. Statistical analysis of <b>these</b> <b>records</b> by Roberts and Solow gives a new estimated extinction date of 1693, with a 95% confidence interval of 1688–1715. The authors also pointed out that because the last sighting before 1662 was in 1638, the dodo was probably already quite rare by the 1660s, and thus a disputed report from 1674 by an escaped slave cannot be dismissed out of hand.|$|E

5|$|From 1962 {{demand for}} blues {{recordings}} in Britain and Europe led to new outlets for American recordings, Chicago recordings that were now available included Vee Jay Records through EMI's Stateside label and Chess Records through Pye International's R series. <b>These</b> <b>records</b> were enthusiastically sought and collected {{by a new}} generation of enthusiasts. The increasing appetite for rhythm and blues was reflected in the growing numbers of Afro-American artists visiting the country. From 1962 the American Folk Blues Festival, organised by German promoters Horst Lippmann and Fritz Rau, brought American blues stars including Waters, Wolf, Sonny Boy Williamson, and John Lee Hooker to the country. In 1964 the American Folk Blues and Gospel Caravan arrived in the UK for an 11-date tour, including in its line-up Sister Rosetta Tharpe, Blind Gary Davis, Sonny Terry, Muddy Waters and Otis Spann. The original dates sold out rapidly and six more had to be added. Later that year, the first of what was to become the annual National Jazz and Blues Festival was held at Reading in Berkshire.|$|E

5|$|Nests {{are usually}} built a few metres apart in loose colonies of at most about 10 pairs, {{although}} sometimes pairs nest alone. The nest may {{be built in}} a range of habitats, and usually is built as a cup in a hole or crevice in a cliff or a wall. They may use suitable human-built structures, such as house eaves and streetlights. The nest is an open structure made of grass, lined with feathers and hairs, packed densely for compactness. Some ornithologists have reported this bird building domed nests in acacia trees, but <b>these</b> <b>records</b> may reflect confusion with the Spanish sparrow. The average clutch contains three to five eggs. Both sexes incubate the eggs and bring food to their young, but females do more. Eggs are incubated for short spells, around 10 minutes, and males incubate for shorter periods and less often. Though the male accompanies the female when she finds food and brings it to their nestlings, he less often brings any himself; once the young fledge and leave the nest the male is more active feeding them.|$|E
5|$|Porto {{have won}} 27 league titles – {{including}} an unparalleled series of five consecutive top-place finishes from 1994 to 1999 – {{and lifted the}} Taça de Portugal on 16 occasions. In addition, they have more Supertaça Cândido de Oliveira trophies (20) than every other winning club combined. Internationally, Porto is the most successful Portuguese club, {{with a total of}} seven titles. Former captain João Pinto and striker Fernando Gomes hold the club records for most appearances (587) and goals (352), respectively. In international competitions, <b>these</b> <b>records</b> belong respectively to Vítor Baía (99) and Radamel Falcao (22). Baía is also the club's most successful player, with a total of 25 titles. José Maria Pedroto is the club's longest-serving coach, overseeing 327 matches in nine seasons.|$|E
5|$|The 2012 Wimbledon Gentlemen's singles final was the {{championship}} tennis match of the Gentlemen's Singles tournament at the 2012 Wimbledon Championships. It pitted world No. 3 Roger Federer against world No. 4 Andy Murray in a Major final {{for a third}} time. This final snapped a streak of four consecutive Major finals reached by Djokovic and Nadal. Nadal was ousted {{in the second round}} while Federer defeated Djokovic in the semi-finals. In what was the most historic Major final of the year, Federer sought to win a record shattering seventeenth Major title and a record-tying seventh Wimbledon to match his idol Pete Sampras. Both of <b>these</b> <b>records</b> are amongst the most prestigious in all of tennis. Murray on the other hand had become the first British man since Bunny Austin in 1938 to reach the Wimbledon final, and was attempting to become the first Briton to win any Major title since Fred Perry in 1936.|$|E
