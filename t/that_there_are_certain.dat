5|$|Behaviorally, domesticated pet rats are tamer {{than those}} in the wild. They are more {{comfortable}} around humans and known to seek out their owners while roaming freely. They have decreased reactions to light and sound, are less cautious of new food, and have better tolerance to overcrowding. Domesticated rats are shown to mate earlier, more readily, and {{for a longer period of}} time over their lifespan. Also, domesticated rats exhibit different behaviors when fighting with each other; while wild rats almost always flee a lost battle, caged rats spend protracted amounts of time in a belly-up or boxing position. These behavioral traits are thought to be products of environment as opposed to genetics. However, it is also theorized <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>certain</b> underlying biological reasons for why some members of a wild species are more receptive to domestication than others, and that these differences are then passed down to offspring (compare Domesticated silver fox).|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} {{to the need to}} uphold constitutional supremacy and the principle of rigidity, the Constitution is also a living document that can be amended where necessary. As the Constitution does not appear to place restrictions {{on the extent to which}} its provisions may be amended, the question of whether there are any implied restrictions on Parliament's power to amend the Constitution arises. If such limitations exist, they would serve as a safeguard against unrestrained amendment by the legislature and protect the essential constitutional features and structure. India takes this stand – the Supreme Court held in Kesavananda Bharati v. The State of Kerala (1973) <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>certain</b> implied basic features of the Indian Constitution that are not amenable to changes and amendment by Parliament. On the other hand, in Singapore it has been established that there are no implied limitations on Parliament's power to amend the Constitution.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to the contingency-focused approaches mentioned, {{there has been a}} high degree of interest paid to three novel approaches that have recently emerged. The first is transformational leadership, which posits <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>certain</b> leadership traits that inspire subordinates to perform beyond their capabilities. The second is transactional leadership, which is most concerned with keeping subordinates in-line with deadlines and organizational policy. This type of leader fills more of a managerial role and lacks qualities necessary to inspire subordinates and induce meaningful change. And the third is authentic leadership which is centered around empathy and a leader's values or character. If the leader understands their followers, they can inspire subordinates by cultivating a personal connection and leading them to share in the vision and goals of the team. Although there has been a limited amount of research conducted on these theories, they are sure to receive continued attention as the field of I/O psychology matures.|$|E

500|$|While admitting the {{complexity}} and sophistication of the Jain doctrine, Padmanabh Jaini compares it with that of Hindu doctrine of rebirth and {{points out that the}} Jain seers are silent on the exact moment and mode of rebirth, that is, the re-entry of soul in womb after the death. [...] The concept of nitya-nigoda, which states <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>certain</b> categories of souls who have always been nigodas, is also criticized. According to Jainism, nigodas are lowest form of extremely microscopic beings having momentary life spans, living in colonies and pervading the entire universe. According to Jaini, the entire concept of nitya-nigoda undermines the concept of karma, as these beings clearly would not have had prior opportunity to perform any karmically meaningful actions.|$|E

500|$|The {{dominant}} {{school of}} philosophy in Scotland {{in the late}} eighteenth century and the first half of the nineteenth century is known as Common Sense Realism. It argued <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>certain</b> concepts, such as our existence, the existence of solid objects and some basic moral [...] "first principles", that are intrinsic to our make-up and from which all subsequent arguments and systems of morality must be derived. It can be seen as an attempt to reconcile the new scientific developments of the Enlightenment with religious belief. The origins of these arguments are in a reaction to the scepticism that became dominant in the Enlightenment, particularly that articulated by Scottish philosopher David Hume (1711–76). This branch of thinking was first formulated by Thomas Reid (1710–96) in his An Inquiry into the Human Mind on the Principles of Common Sense (1764). It was popularised in Scotland by figures including Dugald Stewart (1753–1828) and in England by James Beattie. Stewart's students included Walter Scott, Walter Chambers and Thomas Brown, and this branch of thought would later be a major influence on Charles Darwin. William Hamilton (1788–1856) attempted to combine Reid's approach with the philosophy of Kant.|$|E

2500|$|Broadly speaking, existentialists hold <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>certain</b> {{fundamental}} questions that {{every human being}} must {{come to terms with}} if they are to take their subjective existences seriously and with intrinsic value. Questions such as life, death, the meaning of human existence and the place of (or lack of) God in that existence are among them. By and large, the theories of existentialism assert that conscious reality is very complex and without an [...] "objective" [...] or universally known value: the individual must create value by affirming it and living it, not by simply talking about it or philosophising it in the mind.

2500|$|Herodotus {{would have}} made his {{researches}} known to the larger world through oral recitations to a public crowd.

These portions of the research seem independent and [...] "almost detachable", so that they might have been set aside by the author for the purposes of an oral performance. The intellectual matrix of the 5thcentury, Marincola suggests, comprised many oral performances in which philosophers would dramatically recite such detachable pieces of their work. The idea was to criticize previous arguments on a topic and emphatically and enthusiastically insert their own in order to win over the audience.|$|E
2500|$|The {{performance}} of the hiragasy follows a number of conventions, such <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>certain</b> similarities between the 80+ troupes currently performing in Madagascar.

[...] Traditional instruments are not common at hiragasy performances, due to the origins of the performance with the royal court, where European influences reigned. [...] Instead, the most common instruments are violins, trumpets, and snare and bass drums; the sodina, accordion, kabosy or clarinet may occasionally make an appearance.|$|E

He {{wanted to find out}} why Native Americans were susceptible to certain illnesses and whether they suffered from higher mortality rates as compared to civilized people. Other questions that he raised was whether or not they dreamed more or if their hair turned gray as they got older. His fascination with these people came from his interest in the theory that social scientists can better study the history of their own civilization by studying cultures in earlier states of development, [...] "primitive men". In his autobiography he writes [...] "From a review of the three different species of settlers, it appears <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>certain</b> regular stages which mark the progress from the savage to civilized life. The first settler is nearly related to an Indian in his manners. In the second, the Indian manners are more diluted. It is in the third species only that we behold civilization completed. It is to the third species of settlers only that it is proper to apply the term of farmers. While we record the vices of the first and second settlers, it is but just to mention their virtues likewise. Their mutual wants produce mutual dependence; hence they are kind and friendly to each other. Their solitary situation makes visitors agreeable to them; hence they are hospitable to stranger." ...|$|E
