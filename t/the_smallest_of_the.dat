5|$|After Miranda, Ariel is the second-smallest of Uranus' {{five major}} rounded {{satellites}} and the second-closest to its planet. Among <b>the</b> <b>smallest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Solar System's 19 known spherical moons (it ranks 14th among them in diameter), {{it is believed}} to be composed of roughly equal parts ice and rocky material. Its mass is approximately equal in magnitude to Earth's hydrosphere.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{distance}} of Neptune from Earth, its angular diameter only ranges from 2.2 to 2.4arcseconds, <b>the</b> <b>smallest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Solar System planets. Its small apparent size makes it challenging to study it visually. Most telescopic data was fairly limited until {{the advent of the}} Hubble Space Telescope and large ground-based telescopes with adaptive optics (AO).|$|E
5|$|M. l. leucopterus is {{restricted}} to Dirk Hartog Island, off the western coast of Australia, and nuptial males display black-and-white plumage. This subspecies is <b>the</b> <b>smallest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> three and bears a proportionally longer tail. It was collected again in 1916 by Tom Carter, 98years after de Freycinet's expedition collected the type specimen.|$|E

5|$|Puck is {{the largest}} small inner moon of Uranus, which orbits inside the orbit of Miranda. It is {{intermediate}} in size between Portia (the second-largest inner moon) and Miranda (<b>the</b> <b>smallest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> five large classical moons). Puck's orbit is located between the rings of Uranus and Miranda. Little is known about Puck aside from its orbit, radius of about 81km, and geometric albedo in visible light of approximately 0.11.|$|E
5|$|Several {{versions}} of the stage were used during the tour. The first two legs of 1992 were indoors and used <b>the</b> <b>smallest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sets, which included fourVidiwalls (Philips-branded giant television screens); sixpainted Trabants suspended above the stage; 36television monitors; and a B-stage, a small remote platform connected to the main stage by a ramp. A seventh Trabant by the B-stage doubled as a DJ booth and a mirror ball.|$|E
5|$|The Indian subcontinent is {{the range}} of {{subspecies}} N. p. ginginianus, <b>the</b> <b>smallest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> three subspecies, which is identifiable by a pale yellow bill. The subspecies name is derived from Gingee in southern India where the French explorer Pierre Sonnerat described it as Le Vautour de Gingi and it was given a Latin name by John Latham in his Index Ornithologicus (1790).|$|E

5|$|The basic {{engineering}} {{for all the}} German half-tracks was developed during the Weimar-era by the Reichswehr's Military Automotive Department, but final design and testing was farmed out to commercial firms {{with the understanding that}} production would be shared with multiple companies. Demag was chosen to develop <b>the</b> <b>smallest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> German half-tracks and spent the years between 1934 and 1938 perfecting the design through a series of prototypes.|$|E
5|$|The border {{was also}} patrolled in the British sector by the British Frontier Service, <b>the</b> <b>smallest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Western border {{surveillance}} organisations. Its personnel {{served as a}} liaison between British military and political interests and the German agencies on the border. The BFS was disbanded in 1991 following Germany's reunification.|$|E
5|$|The {{south-eastern}} red-tailed black cockatoo subspecies C. b. graptogyne {{is listed}} as endangered on Schedule 7 of the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972 of South Australia. and is <b>the</b> <b>smallest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> species. Though a June, 2012 count of approximately 1500 individuals is a notable increase from the 2007 count of just 1000, it remains in danger of extinction.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> supraspinous fossa, <b>the</b> <b>smaller</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two, is concave, smooth, {{and broader}} at its {{vertebral}} than at its humeral end; its medial two-thirds give origin to the Supraspinatus.|$|R
50|$|A {{simplified}} ceilidh variation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> popular version {{does not}} required the Gay Gordons method of holding hands in <b>the</b> first half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> routine. Instead, the man holds {{the woman with}} his right arm across <b>the</b> <b>small</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> woman's back and she does the same to the man with her left arm. The toe-steps are performed as usual and they pivot and turn, whereupon the man puts his left arm across <b>the</b> <b>small</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> woman's back and she uses her right arm. <b>The</b> rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> routine is as per the popular version.|$|R

The Midland Road Stand holds 4,500, and the North West Corner 2,300. The TL Dallas Stand is <b>the</b> <b>smallest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> five stands with a capacity of 1,840. The stadium includes 134seats for media representatives.|$|E
5|$|About {{the size}} of a rabbit, the tammar is among <b>the</b> <b>smallest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{wallabies}} in the genus Macropus. Its coat colour is largely grey. The tammar has several notable adaptations, including the ability to retain energy while hopping, colour vision and the ability to drink seawater. A nocturnal species, it spends nighttime in grassland habitat and daytime in shrubland. It is also very gregarious and has a seasonal, promiscuous mating pattern. A female tammar can nurse a joey in her pouch while keeping an embryo in her uterus. The tammar is a model species for research on marsupials, and on mammals in general. It is one of many organisms to have had its genome sequenced.|$|E
5|$|Adrastea has an {{irregular}} shape and measures 20×16×14km across. A surface area estimate would be between 840 and 1,600 (~1,200) km2. This makes it <b>the</b> <b>smallest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> four inner moons. The bulk, composition and mass of Adrastea are not known, but assuming that its mean density {{is like that}} of Amalthea, around 0.86g/cm3, its mass can be estimated at about 2kg. Amalthea's density implies that the moon is composed of water ice with a porosity of 10–15%, and Adrastea may be similar.|$|E

50|$|Frauenchiemsee, <b>the</b> <b>smaller</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{two main}} islands, houses a Benedictine nunnery, built in 782, {{as well as}} a <b>small</b> village. <b>The</b> nuns make a liquor called Klosterlikör ("cloister liquor") and {{marzipan}} (almond paste).|$|R
5|$|Allosauridae {{is one of}} four {{families}} in Carnosauria; the other three are Neovenatoridae, Carcharodontosauridae and Sinraptoridae. Allosauridae has at times been proposed as ancestral to the Tyrannosauridae (which would make it paraphyletic), one recent example being Gregory S. Paul's Predatory Dinosaurs of the World, but this has been rejected, with tyrannosaurids identified as members of a separate branch of theropods, the Coelurosauria. Allosauridae is <b>the</b> <b>smallest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> carnosaur families, with only Saurophaganax and a currently unnamed French allosauroid accepted as possible valid genera besides Allosaurus in the most recent review. Another genus, Epanterias, is a potential valid member, but it and Saurophaganax {{may turn out to be}} large examples of Allosaurus. Recent reviews have kept the genus Saurophaganax and included Epanterias with Allosaurus.|$|E
5|$|At room temperature, it is a {{colourless}} gas, {{like all}} of the hydrogen halides except hydrogen fluoride, since hydrogen cannot form strong hydrogen bonds to the large and only mildly electronegative iodine atom. It melts at −51.0°C and boils at −35.1°C. It is an endothermic compound that can exothermically dissociate at room temperature, although the process is very slow unless a catalyst is present: the reaction between hydrogen and iodine at room temperature to give hydrogen iodide does not proceed to completion. The H–I bond dissociation energy is likewise <b>the</b> <b>smallest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hydrogen halides, at 295kJ/mol.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the larger}} lemur species consume leaves (folivory), {{particularly}} the indriids. However, some smaller lemurs such as sportive lemurs (genus Lepilemur) and woolly lemurs (genus Avahi) also primarily eat leaves, making them the smallest primates that do so. <b>The</b> <b>smallest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lemurs generally do not eat much leaf matter. Collectively, lemurs have been documented consuming leaves from at least 82 native plant families and 15 alien plant families. Lemurs tend to be selective in their consumption of {{the part of the}} leaf or shoot as well as its age. Often, young leaves are preferred over mature leaves.|$|E
50|$|Allentown's {{other public}} high school, William Allen High School (founded in 1858 as Allentown High School), serves {{students}} from the western and central parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city. Dieruff is <b>the</b> <b>smaller</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two schools.|$|R

50|$|Adansi is <b>the</b> name <b>of</b> a {{distinct}} Ashanti language Twi-speaking tribe on the Ashantiland Peninsula, to <b>the</b> south <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ashanti people. The Adansi tribe is <b>the</b> <b>smaller</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two tribes inhabiting the Ashanti Region.|$|R
5|$|The Action of 31 May 1809 was a naval {{skirmish}} in the Bay of Bengal {{during the}} Napoleonic Wars. During the action, an Honourable East India Company convoy carrying goods worth over £500,000 was attacked and partially {{captured by the}} French frigate Caroline. The three East Indiamen {{that made up the}} convoy fought against their opponent with their own batteries of cannon but ultimately were less powerful, less manoeuvrable and less trained than their opponent and were defeated one by one; only <b>the</b> <b>smallest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> three escaped. The action was the first in a string of attacks on important convoys in the Indian Ocean by French cruisers operating from Île de France and Île Bonaparte during a concerted campaign against British shipping in the region.|$|E
5|$|The Inn {{continued}} to prosper {{during the reign}} of James I (1603–1625) and the beginning of that of Charles I, when over 100 students per year were recorded as joining. The outbreak of the First English Civil War in 1642 {{during the reign of}} Charles I disrupted the systems of legal education and governance at the Inns of Court, shutting down all calls to the Bar and new admissions, and Gray's Inn never fully recovered. Fortunes {{continued to}} decline after the English Restoration, which saw the end of the traditional method of legal education. Although now more prosperous, Gray's Inn is today <b>the</b> <b>smallest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Inns of Court.|$|E
5|$|The breed is <b>the</b> <b>smallest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{sporting}} dogs recognised by the AKC, and its distinctly shaped head {{makes it}} immediately recognisable. In addition, {{there are some}} marked differences between it and its English relative. It is a happy breed with average working intelligence, although by being bred to a show standard {{it is no longer}} an ideal working dog. Members of the breed suffer {{from a wide variety of}} health ailments including problems with their hearts, eyes and ears.|$|E
25|$|Haile Sand Fort or Sand Haile Fort is <b>the</b> <b>smaller</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two and is {{situated}} around the low-water mark between Cleethorpes and Humberston on the Lincolnshire coast. In February 2016 the fort {{was put on}} the market for £350,000.|$|R
50|$|Grandidier's tufted-tailed rat (Eliurus grandidieri) is {{a species}} <b>of</b> rodent from <b>the</b> family Nesomyidae. Morphological {{evidence}} suggests that Grandidier's tufted-tailed rat is most closely related to Petter's tufted-tailed rat, E. petteri. However, Grandidier's tufted-tailed rat is <b>the</b> <b>smaller</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two species.|$|R
50|$|If a {{sequence}} of numbers contains repetitions, the Cartesian tree may be defined by determining a consistent tie-breaking rule (for instance, determining that <b>the</b> first <b>of</b> two equal elements is treated as <b>the</b> <b>smaller</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two) before applying the above rules.|$|R
