25|$|Part of {{the decline}} of Jeffers' {{popularity}} was due to his staunch opposition to the United States' entering World War II. In fact, his book The Double Axe and Other Poems (1948), a volume of poems that was largely critical of U.S. policy, came with an extremely unconventional note from Random House that <b>the</b> <b>views</b> <b>expressed</b> by Jeffers were not those of the publishing company. Soon after, his work was received negatively by several influential literary critics. Several particularly scathing pieces were penned by Yvor Winters, as well as by Kenneth Rexroth, who had been very positive in his earlier commentary on Jeffers' work. Jeffers would publish poetry intermittently during the 1950s but his poetry never again attained the same degree of popularity that it had in the 1920s and the 1930s.|$|E
500|$|<b>The</b> <b>views</b> <b>expressed</b> by Lord Browne-Wilkinson {{have been}} {{questioned}} by Cane. As regards the first reason, he {{has argued that}} the distinction between domestic law and general law is problematic. Such institutions may actually operate under a statutory framework which can result in a mixed issue of both general and domestic law arising. As such, the view taken by Lord Browne-Wilkinson cannot be as cleanly applied as he had described it to be. Moreover, the actual scope of ex parte Page has yet to be resolved. There is some uncertainty as to the extent the exception applies to decision-makers other than visitors. Where the second reason is concerned, Cane has noted that the correctness of the distinction between administrative tribunals and courts may be questionable as such an approach was [...] "rejected by a Divisional Court and, apparently, by Lord Diplock himself." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{courts have}} taken a narrow {{approach}} to {{the interpretation of the}} prohibition against [...] "establishing any religion", deriving from the 1981 case of Attorney-General (Vic) (Ex rel Black) v Commonwealth (the DOGS case), in which the High Court held that Commonwealth funding of religious schools did not contravene Section116. [...] Chief Justice Garfield Barwick held that a law would only contravene the provision if establishing a religion was its [...] "express and single purpose", while Justice Harry Gibbs argued that the section only prohibits the establishment of an official state religion. [...] Each justice in the majority contrasted Section116 with its equivalent in the US Constitution to find that Section116 is narrower. The court noted that the US Constitution prohibits laws respecting [...] "establishment of religion" [...] generally, whereas the prohibition in Section116 is against the establishment of [...] "any religion": this meant that Section116 did not encompass laws that benefit religions generally; it only proscribed laws that established a particular religion. The approach of the High Court to the establishment limb of Section116 thus largely reflects <b>the</b> <b>views</b> <b>expressed</b> by Constitutional scholars John Quick and Robert Garran in 1901, that establishment means [...] "the erection and recognition of a State Church, or the concession of special favours, titles, and advantages to one church which are denied to others." ...|$|E
500|$|A common {{complaint}} regarding street prostitution was {{the foul}} language used, and while generally most {{entries in the}} lists look favourably on those women who refrained from swearing, <b>the</b> <b>views</b> <b>expressed</b> in the 1793 edition of Harris's List tend towards equivocation. [...] Mrs Cornish's genteel nature was, on occasion, interrupted by [...] "a volley of small shot", and Miss Johnson's proclivity towards [...] "vulgarity of expression and a coarseness of manner" [...] apparently suffered no shortage of admirers. [...] Mrs Russell, attractive to [...] "a number of clients among the youth, who are fond of beholding that mouth of the devil from whence all corruption issueth", was admired for her [...] "vulgarity more than any thing else, she being extremely expert at uncommon oaths". [...] Drinking, intrinsically linked with prostitution, was also frowned on. [...] Mrs William's entry of 1773 is full of remorse, her having returned home [...] "so intoxicated {{so as not to}} be able to stand, to the no small amusement of her neighbors", and Miss Jenny Kirbeard had, in 1788, a [...] "violent attachment to drinking". [...] Not all entries were disapproving though; Mrs Harvey would, in 1793, [...] "often toss off a sparkling bumper," [...] while remaining [...] "a lady of great sensibility... not a little clever in the performance of the act of friction." [...] More generally, most entries are flattering, although some are less than complimentary; the 1773 listing for Miss Berry denounces her as [...] "almost rotten, and her breath cadaverous". [...] Prostitutes may have paid money to appear in the lists, and in Denlinger's view such commentary may indicate a degree of annoyance on the writer's part, the women concerned perhaps having refused to pay. [...] Some listings also imply a degree of dissatisfaction on the part of the customer; in the 1773 edition, Miss Dean exhibited [...] "great indifference" [...] while entertaining her client, busying herself by cracking nuts while he was [...] "acting his joys". [...] Others are scorned for wearing too much makeup, and some for being [...] "lazy bedfellows". [...] A popular view that prostitutes were licentious, hot-blooded and hungry for sex was incompatible with the knowledge that most worked for money, and the lists therefore criticise women whose demands for payment appeared a little too mercenary.|$|E
