5|$|Millwall and West Ham {{have played}} each other 99 times competitively: Millwall have won 38, West Ham 34 and 27 have {{ended in a}} draw. Before the First World War the teams met 60 times in just 16 years, mostly in the Southern and Western Football Leagues. They have played a total of 39 times in league and cup {{competitions}} since 1916. The teams have usually competed in different divisions, spending only 12 seasons in the same tier of the Football League. Even so, the derbies have retained <b>their</b> <b>passion</b> and both sets of supporters still consider the other club their main rival. They last played {{against each other in}} the 2011–12 Championship. As of the 2017–18 season, West Ham play in the Premier League and Millwall play in the Championship, the tier below.|$|E
5|$|The divine power seems {{originally}} to {{have designed}} Demosthenes and Cicero upon the same plan, giving them many similarities {{in their natural}} characters, as <b>their</b> <b>passion</b> for distinction and their love of liberty in civil life, and their want of courage in dangers and war, {{and at the same}} time also to have added many accidental resemblances. I think there can hardly be found two other orators, who, from small and obscure beginnings, became so great and mighty; who both contested with kings and tyrants; both lost their daughters, were driven out of their country, and returned with honor; who, flying from thence again, were both seized upon by their enemies, and at last ended their lives with the liberty of their countrymen.|$|E
5|$|Other scriptures {{describe}} other {{visits by}} Shiva to Deodar Forest in his Bhikshatana form. The Vamana Purana mentions Shiva entering the Deodar Forest twice as a beggar. Maddened {{by the death}} of his first wife Sati but chased by the love-god Kamadeva, Shiva escapes to the Deodar Forest and lives as a mendicant. The sages' wives who come to grant him food become sexually excited at the mere sight of him. The sages curse his Linga to fall off and it becomes the infinite pillar. Brahma and Vishnu propitiate him and Shiva reabsorbs the Linga into his body. In another instance, while passing the Deodar Forest, Parvati notices sages who worship Shiva and have emaciated their bodies with fasts and severe vows. Parvati requests Shiva to save them from further pain, but Shiva declares that the sages are simply foolish and have not restrained <b>their</b> <b>passion</b> and anger. He enters the forest as a handsome man, wearing only a garland of sylvan flowers. He entices the sages' wives, who give him alms. As before, the Linga of the cursed Shiva falls off, but eventually the sages realise their folly and worship the Linga. Similar accounts of Bhikshatana-Shiva's visit to the Deodar Forest to humble and enlighten the false sages, Bhikshatana-Shiva's emasculation and establishment of Linga worship also appear in the Mahabharata, the Shiva Purana, and the Bhagavata Purana.|$|E

25|$|The major {{technical}} {{difference between}} Edo and Kamigata prints is the latter's use of kappazuri stencil printing, where colours were brushed onto paper {{with the aid}} of paper stencil patterns. This developed in Osaka around the same time as nishiki-e appeared in Edo. Also distinctive about kamigata-e is that its producers were not professional artists like their Edo counterparts. Instead, they were talented amateurs whose artistic interests were secondary to <b>their</b> <b>passion</b> for kabuki and its actors.|$|E

25|$|Relativity and {{ambiguity}} {{are prominent}} {{ideas in the}} play, and the audience is challenged to come to conclusions about the ambivalent nature {{of many of the}} characters. The relationship between Antony and Cleopatra can easily be read as one of love or lust; <b>their</b> <b>passion</b> can be construed as being wholly destructive but also showing elements of transcendence. Cleopatra might be said to kill herself out of love for Antony, or because she has lost political power. Octavius can be seen as either a noble and good ruler, only wanting what is right for Rome, or as a cruel and ruthless politician.|$|E
25|$|Hamlet {{struggles to}} turn his desire for revenge into action, and spends {{a large portion of}} the play waiting rather than doing. Scholars have {{proposed}} numerous theories as to why he waits so long to kill Claudius. Some say that Hamlet feels for his victim, fearing to strike because he believes that if he kills Claudius he will be no better than him. The story of Pyrrhus, told by one of the acting troupe, for example, shows Hamlet the darker side of revenge, something he does not wish for. Hamlet frequently admires those who are swift to act, such as Laertes, who comes to avenge his father's death, but at the same time fears them for <b>their</b> <b>passion,</b> intensity, and lack of logical thought.|$|E
25|$|King Marke leads {{a hunting}} party {{out into the}} night, leaving Isolde and Brangäne alone in the castle, who both stand beside a burning brazier. Isolde, {{listening}} to the hunting horns, believes several times that the hunting party is far enough away to warrant the extinguishing of the brazier – the prearranged signal for Tristan to join her ("Nicht Hörnerschall tönt so hold"). Brangäne warns Isolde that Melot, one of King Marke's knights, has seen the amorous looks exchanged between Tristan and Isolde and suspects <b>their</b> <b>passion</b> ("Ein Einz'ger war's, ich achtet' es wohl"). Isolde, however, believes Melot to be Tristan's most loyal friend, and, {{in a frenzy of}} desire, extinguishes the flames. Brangäne retires to the ramparts to keep watch as Tristan arrives.|$|E

25|$|The lovers, at last {{alone and}} {{freed from the}} {{constraints}} of courtly life, declare <b>their</b> <b>passion</b> for each other. Tristan decries the realm of daylight which is false, unreal, and keeps them apart.

During their long tryst, Brangäne calls a warning several times that the night is ending ("Einsam wachend in der Nacht"), but her cries fall upon deaf ears. The day breaks in on the lovers as Melot leads King Marke and his men to find Tristan and Isolde in each other's arms.
