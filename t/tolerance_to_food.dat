40|$|Food allergy is a {{pathological}} {{condition in which}} the immune system's tolerance of food antigens is disordered. In peripheral tissues, regulatory T cells are an important T cell subset for inducing immune <b>tolerance</b> <b>to</b> <b>food</b> allergens.

40|$|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review {{discusses}} the structural composition of intestinal microbiota, the functional {{relationship between the}} latter and the host, {{and the role of}} abnormal microflora in chronic diseases. RECENT FINDINGS: A more complete view of the gut microbiota is being developed following the Human Microbiome Project. The microflora in children is plastic, susceptible to changes in response to diet modifications, antibiotic treatment and other events, providing the opportunity to study its functional role. Increasing evidence highlights the role of nutrition in the age-related development of microflora. Eubiosis, that is, a normal microflora structure, provides protection against infections, educates the immune system, ensures <b>tolerance</b> <b>to</b> <b>foods,</b> and contributes <b>to</b> nutrient digestion and energy harvest. Changes in microflora, consisting in the overpresence of harmful species or underpresence of commensal species, or dysbiosis produce dysfunctions, such as intestinal inflammation or dysmotility. Moreover abnormal pattern of microflora have been consistently detected in specific diseases. SUMMARY: A relationship exists between eubiosis and functions and conversely between dysbiosis and dysfunctions or even diseases. Abnormalities in microflora composition may trigger or contribute to specific diseases. This raises the hypothesis to target microflora in order to restore eubiosis through the use of antibiotics, probiotics or nutrients...|$|R

An oral antigen challenge after sensitization assessed antigen-induced anaphylaxis. Antigen-specific antibody titres were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in the serum and enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) in the spleen, and cytokine-secreting cells were measured by ELISPOT in the Peyer's patches, lamina propria and epithelium cells. We showed first that S. typhimurium could up-regulate interleukin (IL) - 12 and IL- 10 secretion by gut T cells. Mice pretreated with STPhoPc had decreased anaphylaxis upon challenge, along with decreased immumoglobulin G 1 (IgG 1) and IgE antibody titres. Mice having received S. typhimurium AroA had partly decreased anaphylaxis as well as decreased serum IgG 1 antibody titres in the serum, and increased serum IgA antibody titres. Antibody titres could be correlated with increased numbers of spleen and Peyer's patches antibody-producing cells. STPhoPc-treated mice showed significantly decreased anaphylaxis when compared with the control mice, while S. typhimurium AroA-pretreated mice had a similar immune response together with increased secretory IgA titres.

40|$|SummaryThe {{incidence}} of food allergies {{in western countries}} has increased dramatically in recent decades. <b>Tolerance</b> <b>to</b> <b>food</b> antigens relies on mucosal CD 103 + dendritic cells (DCs), which promote differentiation of regulatory T (Treg) cells.

High-fiber feeding reshaped gut microbial ecology and increased the release of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), particularly acetate and butyrate. High-fiber feeding enhanced oral tolerance and protected against food allergy by enhancing retinal dehydrogenase activity in CD 103 + DC. This protection depended on vitamin A in the diet. This feeding regimen also boosted IgA production and enhanced T follicular helper and mucosal germinal center responses. Mice lacking GPR 43 or GPR 109 A, receptors for SCFAs, showed exacerbated food allergy and fewer CD 103 + DCs.

40|$|The {{mechanism}} {{responsible for}} the induction of immunological tolerance by oral administration of soluble antigen remains unclear. Here we show that, when cultured in vitro {{in the absence of}} antigen, lymphocytes from mice tolerized with a single feed of 25 mg of ovalbumin display an enhanced mortality in comparison with cells from immunized control animals. This increased cell death affects both CD 4 + and CD 8 + T-lymphocyte subsets, and morphological and flow cytometric analyses suggest that it occurs via apoptosis. All of the changes associated with the propensity of tolerant cells to die by apoptosis in vitro are reduced by the inclusion of the tolerizing antigen in the cultures. These results suggest that tolerance to dietary proteins is accompanied by functional changes in T lymphocytes that render them susceptible to apoptosis. This mechanism may underlie the profound and permanent <b>tolerance</b> <b>to</b> <b>food</b> antigens found under physiological conditions and may provide a useful basis for immunotherapy...|$|E

40|$|SummaryAntigen-presenting cells (APCs) {{in the gut}} are apt at oral {{tolerance}} establishment at {{steady state}} and immunity after infection; complex tasks in an environment exposed to the inflammatory burden of the microbiota.

Chemokine receptor CX 3 CR 1 + macrophages were found to take up soluble fed antigens and quickly transfer them to CD 103 + dendritic cells (DCs). Antigen transfer occurred via a mechanism that was Connexin 43 -dependent and required membrane transfer, indicating a physiological role of gap junctions in antigen presentation. Deletion of Connexin 43 in APCs affected antigen transfer and resulted in the inability of CD 103 + DCs to acquire and present antigens in vivo, to drive T regulatory cell differentiation and to induce <b>tolerance</b> <b>to</b> <b>food</b> antigens.

High SMR individuals showed a higher growth rate when fed to satiation, but this advantage of SMR did not exist in food-restricted fish.

High SMR individuals experienced more mass loss during food deprivation as compared to low SMR individuals.

Recent findings Novel treatment options of both prevention and therapeutic strategies have been reported with promising results. The induction of de-sensitization <b>to</b> <b>food</b> proteins was achieved by exposure to a mixture of recombinant food allergens and T helper 1 (Th 1) -skewing bacterial components. Furthermore, research in animal models has provided {{new insights into the}} role of protein structure, digestion, and gut permeability in sensitization and <b>tolerance</b> induction <b>to</b> <b>food</b> proteins. The Th 2 hypothesis of food allergy was tested in mouse strains, linking genetic susceptibility to sensitization with differential Th 1 -Th 2 responses. In this context, the role of the liver in development of food antigen-specific Th 2 cells, and the importance of costimulatory molecules in Th 2 skewing were demonstrated. Finally, rodent models to predict potential allergenicity of novel foods have been further developed using different routes of sensitization. Summary Currently, several animal models of food allergy are used, including mouse, rat, swine, and dog. Continuing research in these models may elucidate the immunological mechanisms that underlie the sensitization and challenge phase of food allergy and may result in improved therapeutic options. Furthermore, the development of animal models to predict relative allergenicity of novel foods remains an important topic...|$|R
