5|$|Few fossils {{have been}} found in the Ringbone Formation, the only {{significant}} one being a specimen that is either Albertosaurus sp. or Daspletosaurus sp., known from a tooth and vertebrae. The only reason the Ringbone Formation is assigned to the Kirtlandian age is because the rocks are <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>age</b> <b>as</b> the Fort Crittenden Formation, which contains one of the index taxa of the Kirtlandian.|$|E
5|$|Keating {{motivated}} Tonelli {{by showing}} {{him the best}} times recorded by American boys of <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>age,</b> <b>as</b> documented in Swimming World Magazine. Unaware that the Americans were swimming in 50yd pools, roughly 10% shorter than those in Australia, Tonelli could not understand his inability to match and better their times. He said that his greatest motivation was the desire to impress his parents.|$|E
50|$|The Leduc reefs are <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>ages</b> <b>as,</b> but not {{contiguous}} with, {{the reefs}} of the Cairn Formation which are located farther west. Because the Leduc reefs are nowhere exposed at surface, the extensive outcrops of the Cairn reefs in the Canadian Rockies {{have been studied}} to increase {{the understanding of the}} Leduc reefs.|$|R

50|$|In 2016, Pins and Needles ran at the Provincetown Playhouse in New York City, {{where it}} was {{produced}} by the Steinhardt School at New York University. The production was directed by Meg Bussert with orchestrations and musical supervision by Joe Church. The cast featured NYU students, {{who would have been}} around <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>ages</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> actors in the original production.|$|R
5|$|On this hypothesis, the {{molecular}} {{data suggest that}} the Bombini are 25 to 40 million years old, while the Meliponini (and thus the clade that includes the Bombini and Meliponini) are 81 to 96 million years old, about <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>age</b> <b>as</b> the corbiculate group.|$|E
5|$|The Beds of Nogon-Tsav are {{considered}} to be <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>age</b> <b>as</b> the Nemegt Formation. This geologic formation has never been dated radiometrically, but the fauna present in the fossil record indicate it was probably deposited during the Maastrichtian stage, {{at the end of the}} Late Cretaceous.|$|E
5|$|When {{designing}} the characters, Nomura had wanted {{at least one}} female character to wear a skirt. Quistis was originally supposed to fill this part, but Nomura decided a long skirt worn over pants would look better. The role was eventually passed to Selphie. Nomura was surprised when the writers cast her as a teacher, despite being around <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>age</b> <b>as</b> {{the rest of the}} group.|$|E
50|$|Van Gelder {{uses this}} {{software}} to help 'teach' {{the first year}} philosophy subject Critical Thinking: The Art of Reasoning which reliably achieves substantial gains in the critical thinking abilities of students (0.7 to 0.85 standard deviations) as measured by pre and post semester testing {{with the use of}} control groups of <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>ages</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> student cohort both studying at Melbourne University and not studying at university.|$|R
50|$|The {{makeup of}} Te Atatū shows that while its {{population}} is composed roughly inline {{with the national}} average: It is roughly <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>ages</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> nation (with slightly more residents over fifty), and its average income ($22627) is only slightly lower {{than the rest of}} New Zealand. Its main point of demographic difference with its country is ethnic - it has more Asian New Zealanders and more Pacific Islanders {{than the rest of the}} country.|$|R
40|$|The {{proposition}} underlying {{this study}} was that females' use of topographical, rather than Euclidean navigational strategies emanate from a separate evolved mechanism rather than a compensatory response due to lesser Euclidean abilities. In support of this contention, it was found that, in terms of ontogenetic development, females' advantages in object location memory emerged during <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>age</b> interval <b>as</b> their greater use of a landmark route learning strategy, while the male advantage in Euclidean abilities appeared during <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>age</b> interval <b>as</b> their greater use of an orientation route learning strategy...|$|R
5|$|Chaa is {{the leader}} of the Guild. Despite looking much older, he is about <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>age</b> <b>as</b> Otonashi and the others. He is the fourth member to join the SSS, at which time he had no facial hair. He first met Yuri and Hinata by holding the {{principal}} of the school hostage at gun point in an attempt to learn more about God, causing him to get stabbed by Kanade.|$|E
5|$|Just as Agrippa's sons were, Drusus {{was about}} <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>age</b> <b>as</b> Germanicus, {{and both of}} them also {{followed}} parallel careers. Drusus and Germanicus held all their offices at the same age, and progressed through the cursus honorum at the same pace. Both held the office of quaestor at the same age, both were exempted from holding the praetorship, they held their first and second consulships at the same age, and both were given proconsular imperium maius when they were sent to govern Germania and Illyricum respectively.|$|E
5|$|Several {{juvenile}} Psittacosaurus {{have been}} found. The smallest is a P. mongoliensis hatchling conserved in the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH), {{which is only}} 11 to 13centimetres (4–5inches) long, with a skull 2.8centimetres (1in) in length. Another hatchling skull at the AMNH is only 4.6centimetres (1.8inches) long. Both specimens are from Mongolia. Juveniles discovered in the Yixian Formation are approximately <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>age</b> <b>as</b> the larger AMNH specimen.|$|E
25|$|The second {{ability that}} helps people stay dry is waking when the bladder is full. This ability {{develops}} in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>age</b> range <b>as</b> <b>the</b> vasopressin hormone, but is separate from that hormone cycle.|$|R
50|$|Created {{and written}} by Andrew Davies and Bernadette Davis, and {{produced}} by Hat Trick Productions for the BBC, Game On {{was aimed at}} twenty-somethings, <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>age</b> group <b>as</b> <b>the</b> principal cast of the show.|$|R
30|$|Some of {{the fish}} with high {{reservoir}} ages were used for cooking experiments, which showed that a food crust on pottery has <b>the</b> <b>same</b> reservoir <b>age</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> ingredients [18, 31, 60].|$|R
5|$|Yukko {{is a woman}} around <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>age</b> <b>as</b> Ikko, {{her older}} sister. Yukko lost her young {{daughter}} Nanako in the last war, and since then has spent all her time researching {{how to make a}} homunculus in human form, though has never been able to produce one that looks human. After the incident with Shiraasan, Yukko is finally able to accept her daughter's death and ceases to make more homunculi. Yukko sacrificed her slumber for her magic.|$|E
5|$|Because he was {{developed}} to be Naruto's opposite, Kishimoto remarked that Sasuke was the most memorable character for him to design. Kishimoto has remarked that Sasuke's character was also influenced by Hiei from Yoshihiro Togashi's series YuYu Hakusho, stating that he referenced Hiei when designing the character character and his Sharingan ability. He also considered Sasuke his most challenging character to create, because his design gave Kishimoto a number of problems. He lacked a proper idea of what Sasuke's face should look like, and his initial drafts of Sasuke appeared too old or mature for a character <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>age</b> <b>as</b> Naruto. Original designs of Sasuke {{had a number of}} necklaces and ties around his arms and legs a result of Kishimoto's habit of giving characters as much ornamentation as possible. Realizing he could not draw such a complex character on a weekly basis, Kishimoto simplified the design to be a basic contrast of Naruto's costume.|$|E
5|$|Four {{years after}} {{returning}} to England Honora Sneyd died of consumption at {{six in the morning}} on 1 May 1780 at Bighterton, surrounded by her husband, her youngest sister, Charlotte and a servant. Honora Sneyd was buried in the nearby Weston church where a plaque on the wall (see box) bears witness to her life. Honora Sneyd died within eight years of her marriage to Richard Edgeworth, at almost <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>age</b> <b>as</b> her predecessor. The same disease which had taken the life of her mother and five maternal aunts would soon claim the life of her young daughter, Honora Edgeworth (1790), as well as her younger sister, Elizabeth, seven years later (1797), as well as at least two of Elizabeth's children, Charlotte (1807) and Henry (1813). Honora's brother, Lovell was also affected by the consumption. At the time it was thought this was a hereditary weakness carried by the family.|$|E

25|$|Microtektites, {{the fourth}} group of tektites, are tektites {{that are less}} than 1nbsp&mm in size. They exhibit a variety of shapes ranging from spherical to dumbbell, disc, oval, and teardrop. The color of microtektites ranges from colorless and {{transparent}} to yellowish and pale brown. They frequently contain bubbles and lechatelierite inclusions. Microtektites are typically found in deep-sea sediments that are of <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>ages</b> <b>as</b> those of <b>the</b> four known strewn fields. Microtektites of the Australasian strewn field have also been found on land within Chinese loess deposits, and in sediment-filled joints and decimeter-sized weathering pits developed within glacially eroded granite outcrops of the Victoria Land Transantarctic Mountains, Antarctica.|$|R
6000|$|In Coleridge {{the poet}} died at nearly <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>age,</b> almost <b>as</b> {{completely}} {{as if the}} man himself had passed [...] "within the twilight chamber ... of white Death"; and [...] "Dejection" [...] is that poet's dirge. The remaining years need therefore but few words.|$|R
5|$|In 1549 Robert Dudley {{participated in}} {{crushing}} Kett's Rebellion and probably first met Amy Robsart, {{whom he was}} to wed on 4 June 1550 {{in the presence of}} the young King Edward. She was of <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>age</b> <b>as</b> the bridegroom and the daughter and heiress of Sir John Robsart, a gentleman-farmer of Norfolk. It was a love-match, the young couple depending heavily on their fathers' gifts, especially Robert's. John Dudley, who since early 1550 effectively ruled England, was pleased to strengthen his influence in Norfolk by his son's marriage. Lord Robert, as he was styled as a duke's son, became an important local gentleman and a Member of Parliament. His court career went on in parallel.|$|E
5|$|In recent years, {{several other}} craters of around <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>age</b> <b>as</b> Chicxulub have been discovered, all between latitudes 20°N and 70°N. Examples include the disputed Silverpit crater in the North Sea and the Boltysh crater in Ukraine. Both are {{much smaller than}} Chicxulub, but {{are likely to have}} been caused by objects many tens of meters across {{striking}} the Earth. This has led to the hypothesis that the Chicxulub impact may have been only one of several impacts that happened nearly at the same time. Another possible crater thought to have been formed at the same time is the larger Shiva crater, though the structure's status as an impact crater is contested.|$|E
5|$|Sometimes trace fossils {{have been}} {{referred}} to Megalosaurus or to the ichnogenus Megalosauripus. In 1997, a famous group of fossilised footprints (ichnites) {{was found in a}} limestone quarry at Ardley, twenty kilometres northeast of Oxford. They were thought to have been made by Megalosaurus and possibly also some left by Cetiosaurus. There are replicas of some of these footprints, set across the lawn of the Oxford University Museum of Natural History. One track was of a theropod accelerating from walking to running. According to Benson, such referrals are unprovable, as the tracks show no traits unique to Megalosaurus. Certainly they should be limited to finds that are of <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>age</b> <b>as</b> Megalosaurus bucklandii.|$|E
30|$|These {{analytic}} techniques, {{along with}} others, {{can be used}} to analyze the data in the APK and possibly generate new hypotheses regarding connections between phenotype and age. For example, consider an analysis that shows that disease A is repeatedly mentioned in the literature <b>as</b> occurring at <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>ages</b> <b>as</b> does disease B. It can be hypothesised that since these two disease share <b>the</b> <b>same</b> pattern of literature reports, they may also share a medical or biological mechanism. Though such hypotheses would need to be further investigated (for example, to rule out the possibility of reporting biases), we believe that the APK provides its users with the opportunity to generate many valid hypotheses.|$|R
30|$|In this {{prospective}} clinical trial, {{the effect}} of two common types of fixed retainers {{on the health of}} the periodontium was evaluated. All the study samples were selected within <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>age</b> group, <b>as</b> different periodontal issues such as gingival recession tends to be affected with age [15].|$|R
50|$|Jay Burns is unnerved {{to learn}} that he is <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>age</b> (40) <b>as</b> John Lennon when he died, and {{somewhat}} encouraged to hear from Jack that Billy Preston and Gregg Allman, two of his music idols, are still alive (Preston died in 2006, {{four years after the}} novel's publication).|$|R
5|$|The episode {{begins with}} a {{flashback}} to 1956, when 16-year-old Emily Locke (Holland Roden) is preparing for {{a date with a}} man twice her age. Her mother tries to stop her from going out, but Emily escapes and is struck by a car. The trauma triggers the premature birth of John (as an adult portrayed by Terry O'Quinn). John's life is monitored by Richard Alpert (Nestor Carbonell), who at John's birth and throughout his childhood looks <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>age</b> <b>as</b> he does in present day, and Matthew Abaddon (Lance Reddick), each of whom attempts to influence his life. The existence of Mittelos Bioscience is revealed when John is invited to spend the summer there as a highly gifted high-school student.|$|E
5|$|The game's {{story begins}} on {{the outset of}} summer vacation. Hazumu's {{homeroom}} teacher Namiko Tsuki suggests Hazumu and her friends take a one-week trip to a small mountain village with a hot spring resort. Hazumu's grandparents reside in this town, and are two new characters introduced to the story. Three other female characters are introduced as possible love interests for Hazumu; two are <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>age</b> <b>as</b> her, {{and the third is}} the older landlady of the resort. The goal of the game is to pair Hazumu up with one of the five female cast of characters. The gameplay's main system comes from Hazumu's indecisive personality. If the player shows more interest in a particular character, the other characters get annoyed that Hazumu is ignoring them, which is displayed in a tension meter. The more Hazumu ignores a particular character, the higher the tension between that character becomes. This ensures Hazumu stays good friends with the possible love interests. In order to view the ending of a particular character, a certain amount of tension will have to be between the other characters, but this cannot be too great or the ending will not show.|$|E

5000|$|The {{concept of}} {{childhood}} has shifted throughout history ("It takes a considerable mental leap {{to remember that}} the innocent schoolgirl intrigues of Angela Brazil or Enid Blyton in the 1940s were designed for <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>age</b> group <b>as</b> <b>the</b> sexually active and angst-ridden teenagers of Judy Blume in the 1970s.").|$|R
