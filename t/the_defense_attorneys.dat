5|$|Throughout his {{political}} career, Monroe continued {{to engage in}} the practice of law in Romney. In 1887 he and Samuel Lightfoot Flournoy were <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>attorneys</b> for Annie Offner, who had been accused of murdering her lover Benjamin Brooks.|$|E
5|$|A {{more serious}} crisis {{occurred}} in May, when Dada organized a mock trial of Maurice Barrès, whose early {{affiliation with the}} Symbolists had been shadowed by his antisemitism and reactionary stance: Georges Ribemont-Dessaignes was the prosecutor, Aragon and Soupault <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>attorneys,</b> with Tzara, Ungaretti, Benjamin Péret and others as witnesses (a mannequin stood in for Barrès). Péret immediately upset Picabia and Tzara by refusing to make the trial an absurd one, and by introducing a political subtext with which Breton nevertheless agreed. In June, Tzara and Picabia clashed with each other, after Tzara expressed an opinion that his former mentor was becoming too radical. During the same season, Breton, Arp, Ernst, Maja Kruschek and Tzara were in Austria, at Imst, where they published their last manifesto as a group, Dada au grand air ("Dada in the Open Air") or Der Sängerkrieg in Tirol ("The Battle of the Singers in Tyrol"). Tzara also visited Czechoslovakia, where he reportedly hoped to gain adherents to his cause.|$|E
5|$|On February 28, Garza's {{half-brother}} Moya {{testified against}} him and said Garza admitted he had received US$3,000 for Fischer's murder {{while he was in}} Brownsville. Garza's defense tried to discredit Moya's statements by saying he was facing drug offenses in Dallas, and was cooperating with prosecutors by testifying against Garza to receive a reduced sentence. Moya denied such arrangements were in place. He said the gun used at the murder scene was bought in Dallas while he was there, and he remembered seeing it in Garza's home in San Antonio. Records from the gun shop in Dallas showed Garza bought the same type of gun on February 1, 1993. In addition, a Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) investigator testified he helped record the suspect's conversations, while a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) technician helped improve the clarity of the tapes. <b>The</b> <b>defense</b> <b>attorneys</b> brought in experts to discredit the recordings, and to prove they had been tampered with.|$|E

25|$|No trial lasted {{more than}} a day, and the longest jury {{deliberation}} lasted less than two hours. The shortest {{was little more than}} half an hour.

The judge presiding was Kennon C. Whittle.|$|E
25|$|The {{gay rights}} advocates from Lambda Legal litigating the case {{convinced}} Lawrence and Garner not {{to contest the}} charges and to plead no contest instead. On November 20, Lawrence and Garner pleaded no contest to the charges and waived their right to a trial. Justice of the Peace Mike Parrott found them guilty and imposed a $100 fine and court costs of $41.25 on each defendant. When <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>attorneys</b> realized that the fine was below the minimum required to permit them to appeal the convictions, they asked the judge to impose a higher penalty. Parrott, well aware that the attorneys intended to use the case to raise a constitutional challenge, increased it to $125 with the agreement of the prosecutor.|$|E
25|$|The {{trial began}} on February 5, 1923. Day after day the {{prosecution}} called {{a series of}} victims, bilked out of their life savings, to the stand. The star witness, however, was Len Reamey, one of the gang's bookmakers, fourth in the hierarchy behind Blonger, Duff, and bookmaker Jackie French. Reamey provided the inside {{story of how the}} gang defrauded hundreds of victims and divided the spoils among themselves. When the prosecution rested after seven weeks of testimony, <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>attorneys</b> surprised everyone by resting their case without presenting a witness, and further by offering to forgo their closing arguments if the prosecution did the same. Van Cise directed the special prosecutors to call their bluff, and so the case went immediately to the jury without any closing arguments.|$|E

25|$|March 23, 2007: Attorneys {{defending}} Addison {{planned to}} contest the use of capital punishment. They intended to explore controversial issues about the law and were expected {{to refer to a}} 1997 trial in which a man convicted of murdering a police officer was sentenced to life imprisonment without parole. In addition, <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>attorneys</b> wanted a change of venue, to gain stricter security; and they wanted to prevent newspaper and television media from taking photographs of Addison while he was in prison and entering or leaving the courthouse. The defense said that such photographs could bias viewers against him and complicate his right to a fair trial. Prosecutors wanted the trial to remain in Manchester and argued that moving Addison to a different courthouse would interfere with the trial. On April 13, 2007, the judge rejected the defense attorneys' request, saying that the trial would not affect jury selection and potential jurors had likely already seen published photos of Addison.|$|E
25|$|The vast {{majority}} of <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>attorneys</b> were German lawyers. These included Georg Fröschmann, Heinz Fritz (Hans Fritzsche), Otto Kranzbühler (Karl Dönitz), Otto Pannenbecker (Wilhelm Frick), Alfred Thoma (Alfred Rosenberg), Kurt Kauffmann (Ernst Kaltenbrunner), Hans Laternser (general staff and high command), Franz Exner (Alfred Jodl), Alfred Seidl (Hans Frank), Otto Stahmer (Hermann Göring), Walter Ballas (Gustav Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach), Hans Flächsner (Albert Speer), Günther von Rohrscheidt (Rudolf Heß), Egon Kubuschok (Franz von Papen), Robert Servatius (Fritz Sauckel), Fritz Sauter (Joachim von Ribbentrop), Walther Funk (Baldur von Schirach), Hanns Marx (Julius Streicher), Otto Nelte (Wilhelm Keitel), and Herbert Kraus/Rudolph Dix (both working for Hjalmar Schacht). The main counsels were supported {{by a total of}} 70 assistants, clerks and lawyers. The defense counsel witnesses included several men {{who took part in the}} war crimes during World War II, such as Rudolf Höss. The men testifying for the defense hoped to receive more lenient sentences. All of the men testifying on behalf of the defense were found guilty on several counts.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{questioned}} how Baader and Raspe managed to obtain {{a gun in the}} high-security prison wing specially constructed for the first generation RAF members. Independent investigations showed that the inmates' lawyers were able to smuggle in weapons and equipment despite the high security, something that the lawyers themselves denied, arguing that every meeting with their clients was observed by jailers. The claims were based primarily on the testimonies of Hans-Joachim Dellwo, brother of RAF prisoner Karl-Heinz Dellwo, and Volker Speitel, the husband of RAF member Angelika Speitel, who were arrested on 2 October 1977 and charged with belonging to a criminal organisation. The fact that they both received lighter sentences, and after release were given new identities, raises the question as to whether they were acting under police pressure and immunity proposal (as {{was the case with the}} ex-RAF members and perjurers Karl-Heinz Ruhland and Gerhard Müller). However based on these testimonies, <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>attorneys</b> Armin Newerla and Arndt Müller were tried in 1979 and one year later they were convicted of weapon smuggling receiving three and a half years and four years and eight months sentences respectively.|$|E

25|$|It {{emerged during}} the {{cross-examination}} of Fung and the other laboratory scientists that the police scientist Andrea Mazzola (who collected blood samples from Simpson to compare with evidence from the crime scene) was a trainee who carried the vial of Simpson's blood around in her lab coat pocket for nearly a day before handing it over as an exhibit. While two errors {{had been found in}} the history of DNA testing at Cellmark, one of the testing laboratories, in 1988 and 1989, the errors were found during quality control tests and had not occurred since. One of the companies hired for DNA consulting by Simpson's defense had made the same error as found in 1988. What should have been the prosecution's strong point became their weak link, amid defense accusations that police technicians handled the blood samples with such a degree of incompetence as to render the delivery of accurate and reliable DNA results almost impossible. The prosecution argued that they had made the DNA evidence available to the defense for its own testing, and if <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>attorneys</b> disagreed with the prosecution's tests, they could have conducted their own testing on the same samples. The defense had chosen not to accept the prosecution's offer.|$|E
500|$|<b>The</b> <b>defense</b> <b>attorneys</b> appealed their {{contempt}} sentences, {{which were}} handed out by Judge Medina under Rule 42 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. The attorneys raised {{a variety of}} issues on appeal, including the purported misconduct of the judge, and the claim that they were deprived of due process because there was no hearing to evaluate the merits of the contempt charge. They argued that the contempt charges would prevent future CPUSA defendants from obtaining counsel, because attorneys would be afraid of judicial retaliation. The initial appeal to the federal appeals court was not successful: The court reviewed Medina's actions, and reversed some specifications of contempt, but affirmed the convictions.|$|E
500|$|Immediately {{after the}} jury {{rendered}} a verdict, Medina turned to <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>attorneys</b> {{saying he had}} some [...] "unfinished business" [...] and he held them in contempt of court, and sentenced {{all of them to}} jail terms ranging from 30 days to six months; Dennis, acting as his own attorney, was also cited. Since the contempt sentences were based on behavior witnessed by the judge, no hearings were required for the contempt charges, and the attorneys were immediately handcuffed and led to jail. Some of the contempt sentences were postponed pending appeal; for instance, Crockett served four months in an Ashland, Kentucky, Federal prison in 1952.

50|$|Agency {{problems}} sometimes {{arise in}} plea bargaining in {{that although the}} prosecutor represents the people and <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>attorney</b> represents <b>the</b> defendant, these agents' goals may be far from congruent with those of their principals. Moreover, prosecutors and <b>defense</b> <b>attorneys</b> often view each other as colleagues and generally wish to maintain good relations with one another. A <b>defense</b> <b>attorney</b> often receives a flat fee or in any event will not receive enough additional money if he goes to trial {{to cover the costs}} of doing so; this can create an incentive to plea bargain, even at the expense of <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>attorney's</b> client's interests.|$|R

500|$|<b>The</b> <b>defense</b> <b>attorneys</b> {{developed}} a [...] "labor defense" [...] strategy, {{by which they}} attacked the entire trial process, including the prosecutor, the judge, and the jury selection process. The strategy involved verbally disparaging the judge and the prosecutors, {{and may have been}} an attempt to provoke a mistrial. Another aspect of the labor defense was an effort to rally popular support to free the defendants, in the hope that public pressure would help achieve acquittals. Throughout the course of the trial, thousands of supporters of the defendants flooded the judge with protests, and marched outside the courthouse in Foley Square. The defense used the trial as an opportunity to educate the public about their beliefs, so they focused their defense around the political aspects of communism, rather than rebutting the legal aspects of the prosecution's evidence. Defendant Dennis chose to represent himself so he could, in his role as attorney, directly address the jury and explain communist principles.|$|E
500|$|The defense {{sought to}} {{cast doubt on}} the {{identity}} of the body pulled from the river. They said it could not be positively identified, and they questioned whether Till was dead at all. The defense also asserted that although Bryant and Milam had taken Till from his great-uncle's house, they had released him that night. <b>The</b> <b>defense</b> <b>attorneys</b> attempted to prove that Mose Wright—who was addressed as [...] "Uncle Mose" [...] by the prosecution and [...] "Mose" [...] by the defense—could not identify Bryant and Milam as the men who took Till from his cabin. They noted that only Milam's flashlight had been in use that night, and no other lights in the house were turned on. Milam and Bryant had identified themselves to Wright the evening they took Till, Wright said he had only seen Milam clearly. Wright's testimony was considered remarkably courageous. It may have been {{the first time in the}} South that a black man had testified to the guilt of a white man in court -- and lived.|$|E
500|$|On October 27, <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>attorneys</b> again {{said that}} they wanted to move the venue for the trial outside Cameron County because of all the {{publicity}} the case had received. They claimed it was impossible to select an impartial jury in Brownsville because of the amount of information the press had released against the defendants. The judge said he would announce his decision on November 2. On the same day, a grand jury reindicted Cisneros and Martínez on capital murder. Prosecutors had presented the evidence to a second grand jury and issued a revised indictment. A clear distinction {{between the first and second}} indictment was the change of the word [...] "caused" [...] to [...] "committed". Because a new indictment was issued, Cisneros, Martínez, and Garza pleaded not-guilty for a second time, forcing the court proceedings to be pushed back from their original dates. A pretrial hearing scheduled for November 2 dlayed. At least 42 motions were filed by the defendants when the first indictment was made, and the second indictment meant that they had to refile all the motions by November 12.|$|E
