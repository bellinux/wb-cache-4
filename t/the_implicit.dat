30|$|The {{arrangement}} of the paper is as follows. In Sect.  2, we give some necessary notations and preliminaries. Then we define <b>the</b> balanced <b>implicit</b> method. To ensure the positivity of <b>the</b> balanced <b>implicit</b> method, we build feedback controls. In Sect.  3, we show that <b>the</b> balanced <b>implicit</b> method solutions can converge to the true solution. Finally, a numerical example is presented to support the theoretical results and verify {{the availability of the}} approach.|$|R

5|$|The Letter Preference Task is the second-most popular {{method to}} measure {{implicit}} self-esteem, surpassed only by <b>the</b> <b>Implicit</b> Association Test. The task {{has also been}} called the Name Letter Preference Task, Name-Letter-Ratings Measure, and Initial Preference Task. There is no standard method for applying the task. The most commonly used one is a letter rating task, which involves having participants judge all {{the letters of the}} alphabet. Even within this method there are variations in the instructions (how much you like the letters or how attractive you find them), in the rating scales (five-point, seven-point, or nine-point), in the order of the letters (random or alphabetical), and in data collection (paper-and-pencil or computer-based).|$|E

5|$|As {{a thought}} {{experiment}} in economics, many international trade economists {{have found this}} simplified and idealized {{version of the story}} important due to its ability to simplify the complexities of the real world. <b>The</b> <b>implicit</b> assumption is that the study of a one agent economy will provide useful insights into the functioning of a real world economy with many economic agents. This article pertains to the study of consumer behaviour, producer behaviour and equilibrium as a part of microeconomics. In other fields of economics, the Robinson Crusoe economy framework is used for essentially the same thing. For example, in public finance the Robinson Crusoe economy is used to study the various types of public goods and certain aspects of collective benefits. It is used in growth economics to develop growth models for underdeveloped or developing countries to embark upon a steady growth path using techniques of savings and investment.|$|E

25|$|The use of {{the term}} Ego in the Discourses does not follow the Freudian definition, {{although}} generally it refers to the same concept and many parallels can be drawn.

The latter finds manifestation in consciousness, whereas the former remains in the subconscious mind. Isolated subconscious tendencies stored in <b>the</b> <b>implicit</b> ego must come to the explicit side {{to take part in a}} conscious process. Yet the explicit ego is very intricately organized and has self-protection mechanisms that act as a repressive barrier to subconscious tendencies. Since spiritual progress requires all subconscious tendencies to gradually pass through the conscious part of the mind and become refined and eventually eliminated, the explicit ego has to be weakened, under certain conditions, to permit this to happen.|$|E
