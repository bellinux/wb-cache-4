25|$|Statement {{measures}} tend {{to comprise}} more words than lexical measures, so hence consume more research instrument space and more respondent time to complete. Respondents are asked {{the extent to}} which they, for example, Often forget <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>things</b> back in their proper place, or Am careful to avoid making mistakes. Some statement-based measures of conscientiousness have similarly acceptable psychometric properties in North American populations to lexical measures, but their generally emic development makes them less suited to use in other populations. For instance, statements in colloquial North American English like Often forget <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>things</b> back in their proper place or Am careful to avoid making mistakes can be hard for non-native English-speakers to understand, suggesting internationally validated measures might be more appropriate for research conducted with non-North Americans.|$|E

He criticized the show's lack of continuity, particularly with regard to the Jesse and Rachel storyline. Entertainment Weekly Tim Stack also observed the lack of continuity in the Jesse storyline, calling it [...] "slightly confusing" [...] and [...] "a little half-baked"; continuity errors in his storyline may have been the result of the change in episode broadcast order. He felt that the episode was [...] "a slight let down", noting: [...] "There wasn’t as much tension as I would have hoped going into the finale but there were still plenty of fun moments to enjoy."
