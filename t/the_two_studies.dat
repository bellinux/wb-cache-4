5|$|In {{contrast}} to the previous analysis, You and Dodson find Chaoyangsaurus {{to be the most}} basal neoceratopsian, more derived than Psittacosaurus, while Leptoceratopsidae, not Protoceratopsidae, is recovered as the sister group of Ceratopsidae. This study includes Auroraceratops, but lacks seven taxa found in Xu and Makovicky's work, so it is unclear how comparable <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>studies</b> are. Asiaceratops and Turanoceratops are each considered nomina dubia and not included. Along with Dong Zhiming, You described Magnirostris in 2003, but to date has not included it in any of his cladograms.|$|E
5|$|In {{more recent}} years, the {{original}} Piagetian object permanence account {{has been challenged}} {{by a series of}} infant studies suggesting that much younger infants do have a clear sense that objects exist even when out of sight. Bower showed object permanence in 3-month-olds. This goes against Piaget's coordination of secondary circular reactions stage because infants aren't supposed to understand that a completely hidden object still exists until they are eight to twelve months old. <b>The</b> <b>two</b> <b>studies</b> below demonstrate this idea.|$|E

30|$|In addition, {{to allow}} {{consideration}} of the positive to negative emotion ratios highlighted by Fredrickson and Losada (2005), emotion ratio scores were calculated by dividing positive affect by negative affect {{for each of the}} pre and post data collected on <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>study</b> days. <b>The</b> emotion ratio scores collected after the activity on <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>study</b> days were then analyzed using a 3 -way ANCOVA with Day as a within-subjects factor, ice cream and gratefulness activity as between-subjects factors.

25|$|All {{combined}} hormonal {{birth control}} products {{have a very}} small increased risk of serious or fatal thromboembolic events. There is ongoing research into the thromboembolic risks of Ortho Evra as compared to combined oral contraceptive pills. A {{recent study found that}} users of the contraceptive patch may have a twofold increased risk for non-fatal venous thromboembolic events compared with women who took a norgestimate-containing oral contraceptive with 35µg of estrogen. However, a different study concluded that the risk of nonfatal venous thromboembolism for the contraceptive patch is similar to the risk for oral contraceptives containing 35µg of ethinylestradiol and norgestimate.

25|$|PVAs in {{combination}} with sensitivity analysis {{can also be used}} to identify which vital rates has the relative greatest effect on population growth and other measures of population viability. For example, a study by Manlik et al. (2016) forecast the viability of two bottlenose dolphin populations in Western Australia and identified reproduction as having the greatest influence on the forecast of these populations. One of the two populations was forecast to be stable, whereas the other population was forecast to decline, if it isolated from other populations and low reproductive rates persist. The difference in viability between <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>studies</b> was primarily due to differences in reproduction and not survival. The study also showed that temporal variation in reproduction had a greater effect on population growth than temporal variation in survival.|$|E
25|$|The city's TIF {{financing}} proposal was controversial. Critics such as Charles W. McMillion (chief {{economist at the}} business consulting firm MBG Information Services) argued that the convention headquarters hotel would lead to lower sales tax revenue by reducing pressure on hotel room rates throughout the city and by keeping attendees away from local restaurants and retail businesses. The convention headquarters hotel, critics also noted, would not have enough attendance {{to make up the}} lost sales tax revenue. Executives at other hotel chains said the city's financing deal projected sales tax revenue of $40 million to $48 million a year, but a more reasonable estimate was $25 million to $30 million a year. City officials countered by pointing to <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>studies</b> conducted in 2000 which came to different conclusions, and by noting that the convention center had promised those booking large meetings at the site that a headquarters hotel would be open by 2007. Without the hotel, these groups could cancel completely, they said.|$|E

[...] She also contended that <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>studies</b> that had failed to replicate the Uhlmann paper's results were flawed for two reasons: because they looked at cells of children with autism rather than in their GI tract, and {{because they did not}} test children with autism with gastrointestinal dysfunction.|$|E

[...] That same year another group working on a different HeLa cell line's genome under NIH funding submitted it for publication.
