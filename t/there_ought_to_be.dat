5|$|One final {{suggestion}} for political policy reform {{is the notion}} that <b>there</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a political balance in every branch of public service. Lack of balance in public institutions creates havens for reactionary forces, which in turn undermine democracy. Russell emphasises two conditions necessary for the achievement of balance. He advocates, first, the abolition of the legal standing of confessions as evidence, to remove the incentive for extraction of confession under torture by the police (Russell 1938:232). Second, the creation of dual branches of police to investigate particular crimes: one which presumes the innocence of the accused, the other presuming guilt (Russell 1938:233).|$|E

25|$|But {{since many}} persons are {{disturbed}} by questions concerning {{what is called}} in Latin substantia, but in Greek ousia, that is, to make it understood more exactly, as to 'coessential,' or what is called, 'like-in-essence,' <b>there</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> no mention {{of any of these}} at all, nor exposition of them in the Church, for this reason and for this consideration, that in divine Scripture nothing is written about them, and that they are above men's knowledge and above men's understanding.|$|E
25|$|The Nyaya school, {{one of six}} {{orthodox}} {{schools of}} Hindu philosophy, states {{that one of the}} proofs of the existence of God is karma; It is seen that some people in this world are happy, some are in misery. Some are rich and some poor. The Naiyanikas explain this by the concept of karma and reincarnation. The fruit of an individual's actions does not always lie within the reach of the individual who is the agent; <b>there</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be,</b> therefore, a dispenser of the fruits of actions, and this supreme dispenser is God. This belief of Nyaya, accordingly, is {{the same as that of}} Vedanta.|$|E

[...] He shed a {{negative}} light on Andy's behavior towards Dwight, calling it [...] "annoying and not that funny." [...] Dahl hoped Dwight would be reappearing soon, and concluded [...] "Overall, a crucial story episode with a nice cliffhanger. Even if wasn't as funny as last week or even most episodes this season, The Office still entertains." [...] AOL TV's Michael Sciannamea lauded the episode, writing [...] "I cannot remember ever guffawing over every single line in a single sitcom episode as I did watching this one. If the performances in this particular one don't garner the actors in this show a plethora of Emmys, <b>there</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> an investigation." [...] Sciannamea continued that he believed it was Steve Carell's best series performance thus far because he [...] "displayed {{the full range of}} his personality—jokester, arrogant jerk, charming salesman, sensitive soul, and added a new one—anger." ...|$|E

500|$|Prior to the American {{entry into}} the war, Woodrow Wilson called for a [...] "peace of {{reconciliation}} with Germany", what he dubbed a [...] "peace without victory". His wartime speeches, however, rejected these earlier notions and he took an increasingly belligerent stance towards Germany. Following the war, on 4 September 1919, during his public campaign to rally American support for the Treaty of Versailles, Wilson commented that the treaty [...] "seeks to punish {{one of the greatest}} wrongs ever done in history, the wrong which Germany sought to do to the world and to civilization, and <b>there</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> no weak purpose with regard to the application of the punishment. She attempted an intolerable thing, and she must be made to pay for the attempt." [...] Regardless of the rhetoric, the American position was to create a balanced treaty that would appease everyone. Gordon Auchincloss, secretary to Edward M. House (one of Wilson's advisers), sent a copy of the clause to the State Department and stated [...] "you will note that the President's principles have been protected in this clause".|$|E
2500|$|According to Sikhism all people, equally, have to bow before God so <b>there</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> no {{hierarchies}} among {{or between}} people. [...] According to Nanak the supreme purpose {{of human life}} is to reconnect with Akal (The Timeless One), however, egotism is the biggest barrier in doing this. Using the guru's teaching remembrance of nām (the divine Word) [...] leads {{to the end of}} egotism. [...] The immediate fruit of humility is intuitive peace and pleasure. With humility they continue to meditate on the Lord, the treasure of excellence. The God-conscious being is steeped in humility. One whose heart is mercifully blessed with abiding humility. Sikhism treats humility as a begging bowl before the god.|$|E
2500|$|Wilson {{had earlier}} downplayed Germany's guilt in {{starting}} {{the war by}} calling for [...] "peace without victory", but he had taken an increasingly hard stand at Paris and rejected advice to soften the treaty's treatment of Germany. In a reversal of his earlier position, in summer 1919 Wilson repeatedly stressed Germany's guilt, saying the treaty, [...] "seeks to punish {{one of the greatest}} wrongs ever done in history, the wrong which Germany sought to do to the world and to civilization; and <b>there</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> no weak purpose with regard to the application of the punishment.

2500|$|With these {{wide variety}} of {{involved}} organisations the Inter-Service Recognition Committee was instructed by the Air Council to [...] "Conduct {{an investigation into the}} state of aircraft recognition training and the methods of production and distribution of aircraft recognition material". The committee did not report until early 1942 when it concluded that having one body controlling training on aircraft recognition was not possible; but that <b>there</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> co-ordination between the armed and civil defence services and that there should be rationalisation of training materials. It was this last point that led the Inter-Service Recognition Committee to decide, in June 1942, to establish its own publication (A lesser point was the saving of purchasing large numbers of copies of The Aeroplane Spotter).|$|E

Rusbridger said that [...] "...if the Prince of Wales is going to try and influence public policy in a particularly frank way then I don't think he is acting as a private citizen and therefore like any other lobby group <b>there</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> transparency about what he's trying to do." ...|$|E

[...] The first reason applies if H is a planar graph, and both reasons apply if H is not planar. [...] We first make precise these notions.|$|E

2500|$|Sinn Féin {{has been}} {{considered}} to be Eurosceptic. The party campaigned for a [...] "No" [...] vote in the Irish referendum on joining the European Economic Community in 1972,.

[...] In its manifesto for the 2015 UK general election, Sinn Féin pledged that the party would campaign for the UK to stay within the European Union (EU), Martin McGuinness saying that an exit [...] "would be absolutely economically disastrous". Gerry Adams said that, if there were to be a referendum on the question, <b>there</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a separate and binding referendum for Northern Ireland. Its policy of a [...] "Europe of Equals", and its critical engagement after 2001, together with its engagement with the European Parliament, marks a change from the party's previous opposition to the EU.

The Irish Times described [...] "ugly scenes", with Damian Cullen calling it [...] "one of the strangest endings ever to a GAA match", Seán Moran describing it as [...] "the most extraordinary refereeing error since Jimmy Cooney whistled up early 12 years ago", and the newspaper publishing numerous letters on the topic from disgruntled members of the public every day that week. The same newspaper's Philip Reid remarked upon the coincidence that these events had occurred on the same day as the 2010 FIFA World Cup Final in South Africa, wondered why goal-line technology could not be used and added: [...] "On this point, it would appear, the GAA and FIFA have something in common: they live in the times of the dinosaur". The events in Croke Park led to less prominent newspaper coverage of the FIFA World Cup Final itself the next day. The incident surrounding the goal was likened to Thierry Henry's illegal handball in the France vs Republic of Ireland 2010 FIFA World Cup play-off. Public service broadcaster RTÉ referred to [...] "disgraceful scenes". The GAA website's official match report brushed aside the controversy, saying Sheridan had [...] "smuggled the ball over the line". Eugene McGee, writing in the Irish Independent, said [...] "It will be a stain on the good name of the GAA if this result is allowed to stand".
