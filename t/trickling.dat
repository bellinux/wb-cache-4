5|$|At {{the close}} of the Seven Years' War, Euro-American {{settlers}} began <b>trickling</b> into east Tennessee from the eastern colonies. In 1772, several pioneers negotiated a lease for Cherokee lands in northeast Tennessee and formed the Watauga Settlement. In spite of the agreement, tensions between the pioneers and the Cherokee rose steadily. By the outbreak of the American Revolution, the Cherokee were allied with the British against the rebellious American colonies, hoping to push the encroaching settlers out of their territory.|$|E
5|$|In {{the closing}} {{stages of the}} first half, Van Nistelrooy got his first shot on goal, turning Senderos only to send the ball <b>trickling</b> along the floor for Lehmann to save comfortably. The first half {{finished}} with a foul on Rooney, who had done well to break free of challenges from Cole, Vieira and Senderos, who eventually brought Rooney down. The English forward took the free kick himself, but it went over the bar to cheers from the Arsenal fans {{and the sound of}} the referee's half-time whistle.|$|E
5|$|The main {{rivers of}} Rùm were {{essentially}} just <b>trickling</b> streams, so Cranbourne {{came up with}} a plan to increase the power of the Kinloch River, by diverting the other two. In 1849, he built a dam at the end of Loch Sgathaig, allowing him to diverting the overflow into the Kilmory River (northwards), rather than the Abhainn Rhangail (southwards). In 1852, he attempted to dam the Kilmory River, half a mile north of Loch Sgathaig, the plan being to send the overflow into the Kinloch River via a short canal; unfortunately Salisbury's Dam collapsed shortly after being built.|$|E

He was racing at the Tomah-Sparta Speedway when Francis Kelly noticed that <b>Trickle</b> was always in {{contention}} for winning the races, but he {{lost a lot of}} them because he had an inferior motor. One day Kelly approached <b>Trickle</b> and asked him what it would cost for <b>Trickle</b> to win. <b>Trickle</b> told him a new motor; Kelly asked <b>Trickle</b> to compile a list of parts that he needed. When Kelly asked who would assemble the motor, <b>Trickle</b> responded that he could but he was a junkyard mechanic. <b>Trickle</b> suggested that Alan Kulwicki's father Jerry Kulwicki, who was building motors for Norm Nelson's USAC stock cars, should build the engine.|$|R

40|$|Abstract <b>Trickle</b> is a an {{extension}} to the Python programming language that provides explicit but simple mechanisms to write distributed scripts and programs. <b>Trickle</b> links together remote Python interpreters running on heterogeneous machines so that {{work can be}} deployed and results collected. A <b>Trickle</b> program interacts with remote interpreters by injecting functions or classes. Remote objects can be instantiated and invoked synchronously or asynchronously. Also, the injected code need not reside on the remote interpreters; code is dynamically transferred as needed. <b>Trickle</b> leverages off of Python’s list comprehensions and generators to simplify parallel invocation, result gathering, and dynamic scheduling. The <b>Trickle</b> run-time system uses a broadcast mechanism to find eligible <b>Trickle</b> virtual machines. Python programmers can immediately use <b>Trickle</b> to dispatch work to idle machines with minimal setup and easy to learn mechanisms. This paper describes the <b>Trickle</b> extension interface, its implementation, and presents an example application and its performance...|$|R

40|$|ELow-power and Lossy Networks (LLNs) are a {{class of}} network in which both the routes and their {{interconnect}} are constrained. LLN routers typically operate with constraints on processing power, memory, and energy (battery power). Their interconnect are characterized by high loss rates, low data rates, and instability. LLNs are comprised of anything from a few dozen to thousands of routers. Supported traffic flows include point-to-point (between devices inside the LLN), point-to-multipoint (from a central control point to a subset of devices inside the LLN), and multipoint-to-point (from devices inside the LLN towards a central control point). The <b>trickle</b> algorithm allows nodes in a LLN to exchange information in a highly robust, energy efficient, simple, and scalable manner. <b>Trickle</b> uses two mechanisms to achieve efficient routing: (1) rate adaption where the nodes send control traffic less often when the network is stable, and (2) suppression where a node avoids sending control traffic if the information has already been recently sent by neighboring nodes. The performance of the protocol is analyzed considering different <b>Trickle</b> parameters in order to capture their impact on Network Formation Time, Energy Consumption, Control Traffic Overhead, and Packet Delivery Ratio for three different <b>trickle</b> algorithms i. e. <b>Trickle,</b> <b>Trickle</b> with Synchronizing Timer intervals, and <b>Trickle</b> with fair broadcast, and results highlights that all the algorithms can form the Network at the same time, but the energy consumption and Packet Delivery ratio are better {{in the case of}} <b>Trickle</b> with Synchronizing <b>Trickle</b> intervals. In this work an extensive performance of the protocol is analyzed considering different <b>Trickle</b> parameters in order to capture their impact on Network Formation Time, Energy Consumption, Control Traffic Overhead, and Packet Delivery Ratio for three different <b>trickle</b> algorithms i. e. <b>Trickle,</b> <b>Trickle</b> with Synchronizing Timer intervals (Trickle-S), and <b>Trickle</b> with fair broadcast (Trickle-F). And the results highlighted that the non-deterministic nature of <b>Trickle</b> can lead to sub-optimal route formation and high energy consumption. Trickle-F mitigates from sub-optimal route formation with the same energy consumption of <b>Trickle.</b> Trickle-S forms a better route with good power consumption than <b>Trickle</b> and Trickle-F, and mitigates from forming a sub- optimal route. Trickle-Fair broadcast suppression and Synchronizing <b>Trickle</b> intervals (Trickle- FS) is demonstrated to be effective in obtaining more efficient routes with the same power consumption of Trickle-S, this proposed solution is a new with respect to the existing literature...|$|R
50|$|A <b>trickle</b> charger is {{typically}} a low-current (5-1,500 mA) battery charger. A <b>trickle</b> charger is generally used to charge small capacity batteries (2-30 Ah). These types of battery chargers {{are also used}} to maintain larger capacity batteries (> 30 Ah) that are typically found on cars, boats, RVs and other related vehicles. In larger applications, the current of the battery charger is sufficient only to provide a maintenance or <b>trickle</b> current (<b>trickle</b> is commonly the last charging stage of most battery chargers). Depending on the technology of the <b>trickle</b> charger, it can be left connected to the battery indefinitely. Some battery chargers that can be left connected to the battery without causing the battery damage are {{also referred to as}} smart or intelligent chargers. Note that not all battery types can tolerate <b>trickle</b> charging after being fully charged; most Li-ion batteries are damaged by <b>trickle</b> charging.|$|R
25|$|Fixed-film or {{attached}} growth systems include <b>trickling</b> filters, constructed wetlands, bio-towers, and rotating biological contactors, {{where the}} biomass grows on {{media and the}} sewage passes over its surface. The fixed-film principle has further developed into Moving Bed Biofilm Reactors (MBBR) and Integrated Fixed-Film Activated Sludge (IFAS) processes. An MBBR system typically requires a smaller footprint than suspended-growth systems.|$|E
25|$|Suspended-growth systems include {{activated}} sludge, {{where the}} biomass {{is mixed with}} the sewage and can be operated in a smaller space than <b>trickling</b> filters that treat {{the same amount of}} water. However, fixed-film systems are more able to cope with drastic changes in the amount of biological material and can provide higher removal rates for organic material and suspended solids than suspended growth systems.|$|E
