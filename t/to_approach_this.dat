5|$|The Barrier (later {{known as}} the Ross Ice Shelf) was sighted on 23 January, but the inlet had disappeared; the Barrier edge had changed {{significantly}} in the intervening years, and the section which had included the inlet had broken away to form a considerable bay, which Shackleton named the Bay of Whales after {{the large number of}} whales seen there. Shackleton was not prepared to risk wintering on a Barrier surface that might calve into the sea, so he turned the ship towards King Edward VII Land. After repeated efforts <b>to</b> <b>approach</b> <b>this</b> coast had failed, and with rapidly moving ice threatening to trap the ship, Nimrod was forced to retreat. Shackleton's only choice now, other than abandonment of the expedition's goals, was to break the promise he had given to Scott. On 25 January he ordered the ship to head for McMurdo Sound.|$|E

He felt that it is unfair to compare the quality of this season to that of past seasons because [...] "the series' previous heights were so very high". However, he called the year [...] "uneven", because episodes would range from putting [...] "Andy into Michael Scott-ish situations" [...] to [...] "seek out new angles on the well-established web of interpersonal conflicts". This vacillation between extremes meant that the episodes [...] "sometimes" [...] work. Matt Zoller Seitz of Salon considered the post-Michael Scott era of The Office [...] "warmer and more reflective". He also praised the decision of Andy as a manager, and he highlighted Ed Helms and Craig Robinson's performances in [...] "Lotto", arguing that they represented the [...] "subtlest, deepest acting to date [...] ". He also selected [...] "Lotto" [...] as the best episode of the season. Hank Stuever of The Washington Post named the series the tenth best series of 2011, specifically praising the actors' ability in [...] "Mrs. California" [...] to deliver cringe humor without Carell. TV Guide named it an honorable mention on their list of the best TV shows of 2011. Price Peterson from TV.com called the series [...] "still one of the best shows on TV" [...] and argued that, while [...] "Season 8 definitely wasn't the show's best", the season [...] "sneaked in some genuinely great jokes, new characters, and affecting plotlines." [...] Despite the lackluster reviews many of the episodes received, many critics praised Ellie Kemper's performance as Erin Hannon. McNutt noted that [...] "regardless of how down I was on this or any other episode, Ellie Kemper really has been tremendous all season." [...] In addition, Kemper's performance in the episodes [...] "Spooked," [...] "Christmas Wishes," [...] "Pool Party," [...] and [...] "Special Project," [...] in particular, were praised by critics.|$|E

Boakes has said he prefers working on the Dark Fall games without a development team as [...] "the worlds of Dowerton and Fetch Rock are created from an informed imagination, using textures and sounds from the world around me. I think {{a little of that}} personality would be lost if tackled by a small team." [...] Of Lost Souls, he felt working alone helped him establish the game's atmosphere of isolation; [...] "working alone {{in the dim light of}} the Darkling Room is the best way <b>to</b> <b>approach</b> <b>this</b> game [...] It's an eerie, isolating experience." ...|$|E
2500|$|Davey Wreden, 22 {{years old}} at the time of the modification's release, was {{inspired}} to create The Stanley Parable about three years prior, after considering the typical storytelling narratives within video games, and thought of what would happen if the player would go against that narration; Wreden also saw this as a means towards his planned career as a game developer. As a video game player, Wreden has found that most major triple-A titles at the time make numerous assumptions about the player's experience and fitting that within the game, and don't provide answers for [...] "what if" [...] questions that the player may consider. Wreden considered that more recent games with more engaging or thought-provoking stories, including the Metal Gear Solid series, Half-Life 2, Portal, Braid, and BioShock, started <b>to</b> <b>approach</b> <b>this</b> void, giving reason for the player to stop and think about the narration instead of simply going through the motions. Though his initial intent was a personal project simply to try to make such a game that asked the questions about why people play video games, he found that there were other gamers that had been considering the same type of questions. He then set out to make a game that would be the subject of discussion for players after they completed it. According to Wreden, his design document for the game was [...] "Mess with the player's head in every way possible, throwing them off-guard, or pretending there's an answer and then kinda whisking it away from in front of them." ...|$|E
