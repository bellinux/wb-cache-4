5|$|Brezhnev {{conspired to}} oust Podgorny from the {{collective}} leadership {{as early as}} 1970. The reason was simple: Brezhnev was third, while Podgorny was first in the ranking of Soviet diplomatic protocol; Podgorny's removal would have made Brezhnev head of state, and his political power would have increased significantly. For much of the period, however, Brezhnev was unable to have Podgorny removed, {{because he could not}} count on enough votes in the Politburo, since the removal of Podgorny would have meant weakening of <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> prestige of the collective leadership itself. Indeed, Podgorny continued to acquire greater power as the head of state throughout the early 1970s, due to Brezhnev's liberal stance on Yugoslavia and his disarmament talks with some Western powers, policies which many Soviet officials saw as contrary to common communist principles.|$|E
5|$|Each republican {{magistrate}} held certain constitutional powers. Only the People of Rome (both plebeians and patricians) had {{the right}} to confer these powers on any individual magistrate. The most powerful constitutional power was imperium. Imperium was held by both consuls and praetors. Imperium gave a magistrate the authority to command a military force. All magistrates also had the power of coercion. This was used by magistrates to maintain public order. While in Rome, all citizens could seek judgment against coercion. This protection was called provocatio (see below). Magistrates also had both <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> duty to look for omens. This power would often be used to obstruct political opponents.|$|E
5|$|On {{an early}} test run the R engine {{produced}} 1,400hp (1,040kW) and was noted to idle happily at 450revolutions per minute (rpm). With increased boost ratings and fuel developed by Banks, the R engine ultimately developed 2,530hp (1,890kW) at 3,200rpm; well over double the maximum power {{output of the}} Buzzard. The engine was further tested and cleared for limited sprint racing at 2,783hp (2,075kW) at 3,400rpm and +21lb (1.45bar) of boost, but this capability was not used due to concerns with the S.6B's airframe {{not being able to}} withstand <b>the</b> <b>power,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> inability of the aircraft to lift the extra fuel required to meet the increased consumption.|$|E

5|$|Tracy first {{discovered}} his talent for acting while attending Ripon College, and he later received a scholarship for the American Academy of Dramatic Arts. He {{spent seven years}} in the theatre, working in a succession of stock companies and intermittently on Broadway. Tracy's breakthrough came in 1930, when his lead performance in The Last Mile {{caught the attention of}} Hollywood. After a successful film debut in Up the River, Tracy was signed to a contract with Fox Film Corporation. His five years with Fox were unremarkable, and he remained largely unknown to audiences after 25 films, most of them starring Tracy as the leading man. None of them were hits although <b>The</b> <b>Power</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Glory (1933) features one of his most acclaimed performances.|$|E

25|$|The news of {{the victory}} was {{received}} in Britain with the warmest enthusiasm. It was the first certain sign that the mutinies of the summer had not destroyed <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> prestige of the Royal Navy. Duncan was at once (21 October) raised to the peerage as Viscount Duncan, of Camperdown, and Baron Duncan, of Lundie in the Shire of Perth (with which came the lands now known as Camperdown Park in Dundee), {{and there was a}} strong feeling that the reward was inadequate. Even as early as 18 October his aunt, Lady Mary Duncan, wrote to Henry Dundas, at that time secretary of state for war: Report says my nephew is only made a Viscount. Myself it is nothing, but the whole nation thinks the least you can do is to give him an English earldom. … Am sure were this properly represented to our good king, who esteems a brave, religious man like himself, would be of my opinion. …. It was not, however, till 1831, many years after Duncan's death, that his son, then bearing his title, was raised to the dignity of an earl, and his other children to the rank and precedence of the children of an earl.|$|E
25|$|Refusing {{a lucrative}} {{contract}} offered by Zanuck at 20th Century Fox {{that would have}} guaranteed him $600,000 per year, Ford launched himself as an independent director-producer and made many of his films in this period with Argosy Pictures Corporation, which was a partnership between Ford and his old friend and colleague Merian C. Cooper. Ford and Cooper had previously {{been involved with the}} distinct Argosy Corporation, which was established after the success of Stagecoach (1939); Argosy Corporation produced one film, The Long Voyage Home (1940), before the Second World War intervened. The Fugitive (1947), again starring Fonda, was the first project of Argosy Pictures. It was a loose adaptation of Graham Greene's <b>The</b> <b>Power</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Glory, which Ford had originally intended to make at Fox before the war, with Thomas Mitchell as the priest. Filmed on location in Mexico, it was photographed by distinguished Mexican cinematographer Gabriel Figueroa (who later worked with Luis Buñuel). The supporting cast included Dolores del Río, J. Carrol Naish, Ward Bond, Leo Carrillo and Mel Ferrer (making his screen début) and a cast of mainly Mexican extras. Ford reportedly considered this his best film but it fared relatively poorly compared to its predecessor, grossing only $750,000 in its first year. It also caused a rift between Ford and scriptwriter Dudley Nichols that brought about the end of their highly successful collaboration. Greene himself had a particular dislike of this adaptation of his work.|$|E

Another extension came with R v Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Fire Brigades Union, where the Court of Appeal held that even if a statute had not yet come into force, the prerogative could not be used to alter this statute to [...] "conflict with Parliament's wishes".|$|E
500|$|French {{film critic}} André Bazin defended {{the film and}} wrote that [...] "In this respect, the {{accusation}} of plagiarism {{could very well be}} extended to the film's use of panchromatic film or its exploitation of the properties of gelatinous silver halide." [...] Bazin disagreed with Sadoul's comparison to Lumière's cinematography since Citizen Kane used more sophisticated lenses, but acknowledged that the film had similarities to such previous works as The 49th Parallel and <b>The</b> <b>Power</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Glory. Bazin stated that [...] "even if Welles did not invent the cinematic devices employed in Citizen Kane, one should nevertheless credit him with the invention of their meaning." [...] Bazin championed the techniques in the film for its depiction of heightened reality, but Bordwell believes that the film's use of special effects contradict some of Bazin's theories.|$|E
500|$|Critics {{began to}} notice Tracy with <b>The</b> <b>Power</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Glory (1933). The story of a man's rise to prosperity, written by Preston Sturges, Tracy's {{performance}} as railroad tycoon Tom Garner received uniformly strong reviews. William Wilkerson of The Hollywood Reporter wrote: [...] "This sterling performer has finally been {{given an opportunity to}} show an ability that has been boxed in by gangster roles... has introduced Mr. Tracy as one of the screen's best performers". Mordaunt Hall of The New York Times stated: [...] "No more convincing performance has been given on the screen than Spencer Tracy's impersonation of Tom Garner." [...] Shanghai Madness (1933), meanwhile, gave Tracy a previously unseen sex appeal and served to advance his standing. Despite this attention, Tracy's next two movies went largely unnoticed. Man's Castle (1933) with Loretta Young was anticipated to be a hit, but made only a small profit. The Show-Off (1934), for which he was lent to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, proved popular, but his subsequent outings continued to be unsuccessful.|$|E
