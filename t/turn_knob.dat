Fitted {{between the first and}} second surfaces, an intermediate space (Z) is partly filled with a magneto-rheological and/or an electro-rheological material (M). A field generator (4) creates a magnetic/electrical field in a subarea of part of the intermediate area filled with material. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are also included for the following: (1) A device for sealing or door, a window or a flap; (2) An operating element, especially a switching lever, a push-button or a <b>turning</b> <b>knob,</b> containing a jamming device; (3) A magneto-rheological and/or an electro-rheological jamming process.

For operating a magneto-rheological and/or an electro-rheological jamming process. ADVANTAGE - A jamming unit has a piston unit (2) and a locking system (3), with which to lock the piston unit. The two control elements can be coupled to each other by a field created in the intermediate space. This coupling can alter the locking condition of the locking system and the piston unit...|$|R

5000|$|The {{traditional}} {{door knob}} has a bolt or spindle running through it that sits just above a cylinder, {{to which the}} spindle is connected. <b>Turning</b> the <b>knob</b> pulls the cylinder {{in the direction of}} the turn.

If the door handles have a square or rectangular plate on which the handle is mounted this is called the backplate. The backplate can be plain (for use with latches), pierced for keyholes (for use with locks), or pierced and fitted with <b>turn</b> <b>knobs</b> and releases (for use with bathroom locks). The plate on the front edge of the lock where the latch bolt protrudes is called the faceplate.|$|R

40|$|Adequate {{instructions}} {{are essential to}} the correct per-formance of actions. An instruction is adequate if its ac-tion(s) and objects are identified sufficiently and unam-biguously, given the instruction’s context. For instance, the instruction <b>Turn</b> the <b>knob</b> would be inadequate if, in the context, more than one knob or one way of turn-ing a knob were salient. However, even if the knob and the manner of turning were uniquely identifiable, the in-struction could still be inadequate since it does not tell the reader when to stop <b>turning</b> the <b>knob.</b> What is miss-ing here is the termination information for the action, or when the performance of the action is to end.
