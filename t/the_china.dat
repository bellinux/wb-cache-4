Venerable Pu Liang, the monastery's 10th abbot, supported <b>the</b> <b>China</b> Relief Fund. Qualified volunteers from Nanyang converged in Singapore to form a batch. In 1939, about 3,200volunteers left in nine batches that included not only Chinese men, but also Indians, Malays, and four Chinese women. About 1,000 of them died in service, 1,000 settled in China and others returned to Nanyang after the war.

40|$|Whether the US Farm Bill 2008 has any {{impacts on}} China's agriculture, is highly related to <b>the</b> <b>China's</b> rural poverty {{alleviation}} and it {{deserves to be}} explored to see what will happen. According the existing empirical studies in the past, we expect that the US Farm Bill 2008 will exert an influence on the agricultural production and rural poverty in developing countries, especially China. In order to fully capture such an effect, we link two equilibrium models together: the multinational CGE model - GTAP and <b>the</b> <b>China's</b> partial equilibrium model - <b>the</b> <b>China's</b> Agricultural Policy Simulation and Projection Model (CAPSiM). A scenario based on the US Farm Bill 2008 will be constructed and compared with the baseline. A more liberalized scenario is also built for the simulation. The results {{have shown that the}} US Farm Bill 2008 has a little positive impact on <b>the</b> <b>China's</b> farmer income, and that the more liberalized the policy is, <b>the</b> more <b>China</b> will benefit...|$|R

5|$|During the Second Sino-Japanese War, many Chinese {{seaports}} {{were either}} captured or blockaded by the Japanese, {{in an attempt}} to prevent supplies from entering China. As a result, an alternative overland road named Burma Road, became China's most important supply route. Completed in 1938, supplies were sent by sea to the port in Rangoon, Burma, transported overland by rail to Lashio and through the Burma Road to Kunming in China. Due to lack of experienced drivers and mechanics in China, the Chinese government requested Tan Kah Kee, the Chairman of <b>the</b> <b>China</b> Relief Fund, to recruit volunteers from Nanyang (a term used by the Chinese when referring to Southeast Asia).

5|$|After outrunning Duckworth on 26 December, Willaumez sailed for the South Atlantic, {{intending}} to {{pass into the}} Indian Ocean and cruise off the Cape of Good Hope {{in anticipation of the}} arrival of the British China Fleet. <b>The</b> <b>China</b> Fleet was a large annual convoy of East Indiamen that originated in Canton and passed through the Malacca Straits, across the Indian Ocean, around the Cape of Good Hope and then north through the Atlantic Ocean, arriving in British waters six to eight months after departure.
