5|$|Randolph adopted two {{rules in}} {{preparing}} his initial outline: <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Constitution</b> should only include essential principles, avoiding minor provisions {{that would change}} over time, and {{that it should be}} stated in simple and precise language.|$|E
5|$|The fact <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>constitution</b> is {{the result}} of the {{ordinary}} law of the land. In other words, it is not the source but the consequence of the citizens' rights.|$|E
5|$|In Gideon v. Wainwright, Justice Harlan agreed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Constitution</b> {{required}} {{states to}} provide attorneys for defendants {{who could not}} afford their own counsel. However, he believed that this requirement applied only at trial, and not on appeal; thus, he dissented from Douglas v. California.|$|E
50|$|As the {{guarantor}} of <b>the</b> <b>Constitution</b> and <b>the</b> entire system of constitutional law, <b>the</b> President ensures <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>constitutions,</b> {{laws and regulations}} of the constituent territories of the Azerbaijan be in full compliance with <b>the</b> country’s <b>Constitution</b> and federal laws.|$|R
50|$|He {{edited the}} second edition of the {{influential}} collection <b>The</b> Tudor <b>Constitution.</b> In it, he supported John Aylmer's basic conclusion <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Tudor <b>constitution</b> mirrored <b>that</b> of <b>the</b> mixed <b>constitution</b> of Sparta.|$|R

5|$|The Supreme Court {{unanimously}} {{upheld the}} Missouri voting legislation, saying that voting {{was not an}} inherent right of citizenship, <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Constitution</b> neither granted nor forbade voting rights for women, and that allowing only male citizens to vote was not an infringement of Minor's rights under the Fourteenth Amendment.|$|E
5|$|After {{several years}} of {{comparatively}} weak government under the Articles of Confederation, a Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia proposed a new constitution on September 17, 1787, featuring among other changes a stronger chief executive. George Mason, a Constitutional Convention delegate and the drafter of Virginia's Declaration of Rights, proposed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Constitution</b> include {{a bill of rights}} listing and guaranteeing civil liberties. Other delegates—including future Bill of Rights drafter James Madison—disagreed, arguing that existing state guarantees of civil liberties were sufficient and that any attempt to enumerate individual rights risked the implication that other, unnamed rights were unprotected. After a brief debate, Mason's proposal was defeated by a unanimous vote of the state delegations.|$|E
5|$|Despite their successes, {{these three}} dissenters grew {{increasingly}} unpopular as most other delegates {{wanted to bring}} the Convention's business {{to an end and}} return home. As the Convention was drawing to a conclusion, and delegates prepared to refer the Constitution to the Committee on Style to pen the final version, one delegate raised an objection over civil trials. He wanted to guarantee the right to a jury trial in civil matters, and Mason saw in this a larger opportunity. Mason told the Convention <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>constitution</b> should include a bill of rights, which he thought could be prepared in a few hours. Gerry agreed, though the rest of the committee overruled them. They wanted to go home, and thought this was nothing more than another delaying tactic.|$|E
25|$|There must be codification, <b>that</b> is, <b>the</b> <b>constitution</b> must be written.|$|R
50|$|It was {{not till}} {{after the death}} of the founder, who lived to see another {{foundation}} made at Bollène, <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>constitutions</b> were approved by Pope Innocent XII (1693), who authorized the nuns to take solemn vows and bound them to enclosure.|$|R
50|$|He was {{a member}} of <b>the</b> {{committee}} <b>that</b> drafted <b>the</b> <b>Constitution</b> of Iraq.|$|R
5|$|Few at {{the time}} {{realized}} how important the issue would become, with {{the absence of a}} bill of rights becoming the main argument of the anti-Federalists against ratification. Most of the Convention's delegates thought that states already protected individual rights, and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Constitution</b> did not authorize the national government to take away rights, so {{there was no need to}} include protections of rights. Once the Convention moved beyond this point, the delegates addressed a couple of last-minute issues. Importantly, they modified the language that required spending bills to originate in the House of Representatives and be flatly accepted or rejected, unmodified, by the Senate. The new language empowered the Senate to modify spending bills proposed by the House.|$|E
5|$|I {{realize that}} many good and able men have eloquently spoken and written, {{sometimes}} in rhapsodical strains, about {{the duty of}} this Court to keep the Constitution {{in tune with the}} times. The idea is <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Constitution</b> must be changed from time to time, and that this Court is charged with a duty to make those changes. For myself, I must, with all deference, reject that philosophy. The Constitution makers knew the need for change, and provided for it. Amendments suggested by the people's elected representatives can be submitted to the people or their selected agents for ratification. That method of change was good for our Fathers, and, being somewhat old-fashioned, I must add it is good enough for me.|$|E
5|$|Ian Drake, an {{assistant}} professor of Political Science and another critic of the compact, has argued <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>constitution</b> both requires and prohibits Congressional approval of the compact. In Drake's view, only a constitutional amendment could make the compact valid. Authors Michael Brody, Jennifer Hendricks, and Bradley Turflinger have examined the compact and concluded that the NPVIC, if successfully enacted, would pass constitutional muster. Brody has put forth a unique theory that the legality of the NPVIC could potentially hinge on the notion that faithless electors are not necessarily obligated to vote for the candidate to whom they are pledged.|$|E

50|$|Whether {{or not a}} limited-call {{convention}} {{dealing with}} specific issues is constitutional or not remains unclear. Proponents argue <b>that</b> because <b>the</b> <b>Constitution</b> is a limiting, and not a granting, document, then it is. They point to <b>the</b> fact <b>that</b> <b>the</b> 1801 Convention was a limited-call one. Opponents argue <b>that</b> because <b>the</b> <b>Constitution</b> does not expressly provide for such a Convention, any such convention would be unconstitutional.|$|R
5|$|One of Combs' first {{official}} actions as governor {{was to call}} a special session of the legislature on December 19, 1959, to consider revising the state's constitution, which had been in effect since 1891. Calling a constitutional convention required that the General Assembly approve putting {{the issue of a}} convention on the ballot in two consecutive legislative sessions. The call then had to be approved by Kentucky voters. Despite near-universal agreement by legal scholars <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>constitution</b> was badly in need of updating, Kentucky voters had rejected calls for a constitutional convention in 1931 and 1947, and had only approved 19 amendments since 1891. Combs wanted to address the issue during his four-year term, hence the haste in calling the special legislative session. The General Assembly easily approved the call for a convention during the special legislative session and again during the subsequent regular legislative session in 1960. Combs signed the measure, and the question of a constitutional revision was put on the ballot in November 1960, when Kentucky voters defeated it by a margin of almost 18,000 votes. This was the closest Kentucky has come to replacing the 1891 constitution, which remains in effect today.|$|E
5|$|The Congress soon {{joined the}} new Indian ministry. The League was slower to do so, not {{entering}} until October 1946. In agreeing {{to have the}} League join the government, Jinnah abandoned his demands for parity with the Congress and a veto on matters concerning Muslims. The new ministry met amid a backdrop of rioting, especially in Calcutta. The Congress wanted the Viceroy to immediately summon the constituent assembly and begin the work of writing a constitution and felt that the League ministers should either join in the request or resign from the government. Wavell attempted to save the situation by flying leaders such as Jinnah, Liaquat, and Jawaharlal Nehru to London in December 1946. At {{the end of the}} talks, participants issued a statement <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>constitution</b> would not be forced on any unwilling parts of India. On the way back from London, Jinnah and Liaquat stopped in Cairo for several days of pan-Islamic meetings.|$|E
5|$|While on a {{visit to}} the Peloponnese in 1862 a new coup was {{launched}} and this time a Provisional Government was set up and summoned a National Convention. Ambassadors of the Great Powers urged King Otto not to resist, and the king and queen took refuge on a British warship and returned to Bavaria aboard (the same way they had come to Greece) taking with them the Greek royal regalia which they had brought from Bavaria in 1832. It has been suggested that had Otto and Amalia borne an heir, then the King would not have been overthrown, as succession was also a major unresolved question at the time. It is also true, however, <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Constitution</b> of 1843 made provision for his succession by his two younger brothers and their descendants.|$|E

50|$|On 5 July 1959, President Sukarno, {{who until}} then had {{played the role}} of {{ceremonial}} Head of State intervened. In a decree, he dissolved the Constitutional Assembly and declared <b>that</b> <b>the</b> 1945 <b>Constitution</b> would thenceforth be in force and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Provisional <b>Constitution</b> was void. With the return to <b>the</b> 1945 <b>Constitution,</b> <b>the</b> MPR was once again recognised as the highest governing body in the land.|$|R
50|$|The {{lawsuit was}} {{dismissed}} by the United States District Court for the District of Columbia on <b>the</b> grounds <b>that</b> <b>the</b> textbooks disseminated science, not religion. The Court also held <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Constitutions</b> First Amendment prohibited states from demanding textbook teachings align {{with the religious}} beliefs of any particular group or individual.|$|R
5|$|In March 1814, {{following}} {{with the}} collapse of the First French Empire, Ferdinand VII was restored to the Spanish throne. This signified an important change, since most of the political and legal changes made on both sides of the Atlantic—the myriad of juntas, the Cortes in Spain and several of the congresses in the Americas, and many of the constitutions and new legal codes—had been made in his name. Before entering Spanish territory, Ferdinand made loose promises to the Cortes that he would uphold the Spanish Constitution. But once in Spain he realized that he had significant support from conservatives in the general population and the hierarchy of the Spanish Catholic Church; so, on May 4, he repudiated the Constitution and ordered the arrest of liberal leaders on May 10. Ferdinand justified his actions by stating <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Constitution</b> and other changes had been made by a Cortes assembled in his absence and without his consent. He restored the former legal codes and political institutions and promised to convene a new Cortes under its traditional form (with separate chambers for the clergy and the nobility), a promise never fulfilled. News of the events arrived through Spanish America during the next three weeks to nine months, depending on time it took goods and people to travel from Spain.|$|E
5|$|The Treaty of Jassy in January 1792 {{ended the}} Russian {{war with the}} Ottomans, and in April of that year the First Coalition wars began, forcing Prussia to move the bulk of its forces west to deal with revolutionary France. Russia, angered by Poland's attempt {{to move out of}} its influence, invaded Poland in May. Around that time, Prussian policy was already set against Poland; rather than {{discussing}} how to aid it, Frederic Wilhelm and his ministers were discussing how to convince Austria and Prussia to a new partition. Lucchesini has already made several declarations that Prussia cannot aid the Commonwealth, and in June that year, Potocki's mission to Berlin received a confirmation of that, motivated on the grounds <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Constitution</b> of 3 May changed Polish state so much that Prussia does not consider its obligations binding. Prussian Foreign Minister, Friedrich Wilhelm von Schulenburg-Kehnert, has clearly and with rare candor told Potocki that Prussia did not support the constitution, but could not say so initially, as to not allow any Polish-Russian reconciliation, and now will not even help as a mediator, as it is not in Prussian's interest of the state to see Commonwealth strengthened so that it could threaten Prussia in some future.|$|E
5|$|Whether {{slavery was}} to be {{regulated}} under the new Constitution {{was a matter of}} such intense conflict between the North and South that several Southern states refused to join the Union if slavery were not to be allowed. Delegates opposed to slavery were forced to yield in their demands that slavery practiced {{within the confines of the}} new nation be completely outlawed. However, they continued to argue <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Constitution</b> should prohibit the states from participating in the international slave trade, including in the importation of new slaves from Africa and the export of slaves to other countries. The Convention postponed making a final decision on the international slave trade until late in the deliberations because of the contentious nature of the issue. During the Convention's late July recess, the Committee of Detail had inserted language that would prohibit the federal government from attempting to ban international slave trading and from imposing taxes on the purchase or sale of slaves. The Convention could not agree on these provisions when the subject came up again in late August, so they referred the matter to an eleven-member committee for further discussion. This committee helped work out a compromise: Congress would have the power to ban the international slave trade, but not for another twenty years (that is, not until 1808). In exchange for this concession, the federal government's power to regulate foreign commerce would be strengthened by provisions that allowed for taxation of slave trades in the international market and that reduced the requirement for passage of navigation acts from two-thirds majorities of both houses of Congress to simple majorities.|$|E

50|$|In his post-governor career, Thomas Sim Lee {{represented}} Maryland as {{a delegate}} to the Continental Congress in 1783 and 1784. He also {{was a member of}} the house of delegates in 1787. He declined the opportunity to serve in <b>the</b> convention <b>that</b> drafted <b>the</b> <b>Constitution</b> of <b>the</b> United States, but served in <b>the</b> state convention <b>that</b> ratified <b>the</b> <b>Constitution</b> in 1788.

25|$|The second legal {{criterion}} is <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>constitution</b> must be rigid. This {{is important}} to ensure that constitutional provisions can only be changed by an authority that is higher in status than the ordinary legislative body existing under the Constitution. However, rigidity does not mean <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Constitution</b> is completely immutable. If the Constitution is static, the nation's political development may be stunted. Instead, rigidity of the Constitution merely contemplates that compared to ordinary legislation, the Constitution should {{be more difficult to}} amend.|$|E
