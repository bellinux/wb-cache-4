40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} the study was to evaluate, using finite element analysis, the stress {{patterns}} induced in cortical bone by three distinct implant-supported prosthetic designs. Materials and Methods: The first two models consisted of a prosthesis supported by four implants, the distal two of which were tilted, with different cantilever lengths (5 mm and 15 mm). The third design consisted of a prosthesis supported by five conventionally placed implants and a 15 -mm cantilever. Results: In the <b>tilted</b> <b>model</b> with 5 -mm cantilever and in the nontilted model, the maximum value of compressive stress (- 18 Mpa) was found near the cervical area of the distal implant. Higher values for compressive stress were predicted near the cervical area of the distal implant in the <b>tilted</b> <b>model</b> with a 15 -mm cantilever, as compared to the <b>tilted</b> <b>model</b> with the 5 -mm cantilever. For the <b>tilted</b> <b>model</b> with the 5 -mm cantilever, peak values of tensile stress were predicted near the cervical area of both the distal (1. 25 Mpa) and the mesial implants (2. 5 Mpa). For the nontilted model, the peak value was found near the cervical area of the in-between implant (5 Mpa). For the <b>tilted</b> <b>model</b> with 15 -mm cantilever, tensile stress values were higher than in the <b>tilted</b> <b>model</b> with 5 -mm cantilever. Conclusions: No significant difference in stress patterns between the tilted 5 -mm and the nontilted 15 -mm configuration was predicted. The tilted configuration with a 15 -mm cantilever was found to induce higher stress values than the tilted configuration with a 5 -mm cantilever.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Ten Pd-Ag frameworks were tested over two master models with: 1) parallel vertical implants, and 2) tilted distal implants. Strain gauges were fixed on the abutments of each master model to measure the deformation when a static load of 50 N was applied on the cantilever (15 mm). The deformation values were measured when the metallic frameworks were tested over three, four or five abutments, and transformed into force and bending moment values. Data were analyzed by ANOVA and Tukey's test for multiple comparisons at 5 % level of significance. RESULTS: Abutment # 1 (adjacent to the cantilever) had the highest values of force and sagittal bending moment for all tests with three, four or five abutments. Independently {{from the number of}} abutments, axial force in abutment # 1 was higher in the vertical model than in the <b>tilted</b> <b>model.</b> Total moment was higher with three abutments than with four or five abutments.

Here, we investigate the epoch of reionization in several models normalized to WMAP on large scales, and with sufficiently reduced power on small scales to solve the halo concentration and substructure problems. These include a <b>tilted</b> <b>model,</b> the WMAP running-index model, and a Warm Dark Matter model. We assume that the Universe was reionized by stellar sources comprised of a combination of supermassive (~ 200 M_sun) Pop III stars and Pop II stars with a `normal' IMF. We find that in all of these models, structure formation and hence reionization occurs late, certainly at redshifts below ten, and more probably at z < 6. This is inconsistent (at 2 sigma) with the determination of z_reion ~ 17 from the WMAP temperature-polarization data and is only marginally consistent with SDSS quasar observations. The tension between the galactic-scale observations, which favor low-power models, and the early reionization favored by WMAP can only be resolved if the efficiency of Pop III star formation is dramatically higher than any current estimate, or if there is an exotic population of ionizing sources such as mini-quasars. Otherwise, we may {{have to live with the}} standard LCDM power spectrum, and solve the small-scale problems in some other way. Comment: submitted to ApJ...|$|E
40|$|The power {{spectrum}} (PS) of mass density fluctuations, independent of "biasing", is estimated from the Mark 3 Catalog of Peculiar Velocities of galaxies using Bayesian statistics. A parametric model is assumed for the PS, {{and the free}} parameters are determined by maximizing the posterior probability of the model given the data. The method has been tested using detailed mock catalogs. We use generalized CDM models with and without COBE normalization. The robust result for all the models tested is P(k) Ω^ 1. 2 = (4. 1 ± 0. 7) x 10 ^ 3 (Mpc h^- 1) ^ 3 at k= 0. 1 h Mpc^- 1, with the peak constrained to the range 0. 03 < k < 0. 06 h Mpc^- 1. It {{is consistent with a}} direct computation of the PS (Kolatt & Dekel 1996). When compared to galaxy-density surveys, the implied values for β (≡Ω^ 0. 6 /b) are of order unity to within 25 %. A Γ-shape model, free of COBE normalization, is constrained by the velocity data to Γ= 0. 5 ± 0. 15 and σ_ 8 Ω^ 0. 6 = 0. 85 ± 0. 1.

A semiparametric logistic regression model is assumed for the response probability and a nonparametric regression approach for missing data discussed in Cheng (1994) is used in the estimator.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{the study of}} electronic, geometrical, elastic and {{vibrational}} properties {{of a range of}} prototypical iron- and lead-based materials has been addressed using the density functional theory and inter- atomic potentials. It has been proven that both quality and quantity of the correlation included in classical DFT-LSDA and -GGA func- tionals is not sufficient to treat strongly correlated materials as well as layered solids, where van der Waals' forces dominate. Owing to these considerations appears clear the need to go beyond traditional DFT to further improve the description of materials in which the correlation plays an important role. The electronic, the geometrical and the magnetic properties of the corundum-type a - Fe 203 have been determined and compared within the PP-PW and the LCAO frameworks using DFT + U and HYBRID functionals. a - Fe 203 is correctly described as a charge-transfer insulator, when the optimised value for the U (3. 75 eV) or the 40 % of HF exchange is employed. Instead B 3 LYP predicts a - Fe 203 as a Mott insulator, in agreement with pure DFT-GGA functionals, such as PW 91, PBE and BLYP. The intensities and symmetries of the Fe(3 d) partial density of states, in the conduction band, of the hematite were found in agreement with with the experimental Fe K-edge XANES. spectrum. The doping of hematite with several alkali-earth metals was also investigated. All structural possibilities have been explored employing the program OASIS developed in our laboratory. Here a combinatorial inter-atomic potential strategy to confine interesting candidates from a large populations of defective solids has been also proposed. The prediction of their properties is then redirected to more accurate, but expensive, computational techniques such as DFT. With this method experimental X-ray diffraction patters for hematite doped with low concentrations of Mg were correctly reproduced. It was found that doping with low concentrations (6. 25 %) of Mg 2 + is not a spontaneous process for hematite, i. e. magnesium is not soluble into hematite. On the other hand, the larger alkali-earth ions (Ca, Sr and Ba) all showed high solubility in a - Fe 203. Several other doping mechanisms were also investigated. The description of metallic lead and its (1 1 1) Pb surface were also investigated using DFT. This latter was successfully employed to study the adsorption of S 2 molecule in several configurations. According to the BE measured the <b>tilted</b> <b>model</b> is found to be far most stable than the other models: bridge ~ ccp » top ~ hcp. For the first three models the BE values ensure the incipient chemisorption of S 2 involving an electron-transfer surface [...] > molecule. This would confirm the spontaneous formation of PbS a common lead mineral. PbO is a prototype of layered material where dispersion forces determined the stability of the layered structure. DFT has been largely shown to be inappropriate in the description of low-densities areas, responsible of dispersion forces, with traditional GGA-DFT. Here the empirical Grimme's was adapted for the description of periodic systems such as PbO. The effect of this empirical correction on the total energy as well as the gradient was employed to improve the description of the PbO geometry, IR/Raman frequencies and elastic constants which were found in excellent agreement with the experimental values found in the literatureEThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
