5|$|In A Theory of Content and Other Essays (1990), Fodor {{takes up}} {{another of his}} central notions: the {{question}} of the reality of mental representations. Fodor needs to justify representational realism <b>to</b> <b>justify</b> <b>the</b> idea that the contents of mental states are expressed in symbolic structures such as those of the LOT.|$|E
5|$|A {{government}} report released in November 1990 documented {{serious problems with}} the A-12 development program. In December 1990 Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney told the Navy <b>to</b> <b>justify</b> <b>the</b> program and deliver reasons why {{it should not be}} canceled. The response given by the Navy and the contractors failed to persuade the Secretary of Defense, as he canceled the program in the following month, on 7 January 1991, for breach of contract.|$|E
5|$|Falun Gong sources {{overseas}} {{questioned the}} official Chinese government {{account of the}} event, and apparent inconsistencies in government's official narrative led to a hypothesis that the self-immolation was staged by the government <b>to</b> <b>justify</b> <b>the</b> persecution against Falun Gong by portraying its practitioners as irrational and suicidal. According to this hypothesis, the self-immolation participants were paid actors, and were presumably assured that the flames would be extinguished before doing real harm.|$|E

5|$|However, the 2000s housing bubble {{that drove}} {{significant}} growth of Poinciana collapsed and Avatar was unable <b>to</b> <b>justify</b> <b>the</b> costs or finance {{construction of the}} highway. Around 2010, Avatar decided not to build the highway {{while at the same}} time, the state established the Osceola County Expressway Authority (OCX) to develop and built a series of toll road segments in Osceola County. The 2040 Master Plan developed by OCX has a loop route around the south and east sides of the Kissimmee-St.Cloud area. The Poinciana Parkway is a natural part of the proposed loop road.|$|E
5|$|In 1919, Hess {{enrolled}} in the University of Munich, where he studied history and economics. His geopolitics professor was Karl Haushofer, a proponent {{of the concept of}} Lebensraum ("living space"), which Haushofer cited <b>to</b> <b>justify</b> <b>the</b> proposal that Germany should forcefully conquer additional territory in Eastern Europe. Hess later introduced this concept to Adolf Hitler, and it became one of the pillars of Nazi Party ideology. Hess became friends with Haushofer and his son Albrecht, a social theorist and lecturer.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of the airstrike, Diệm became hostile towards the American {{presence}} in South Vietnam. Diệm claimed that the American media was seeking to bring him down and he introduced new restrictions on press freedom and political association. The media speculated that the United States would use the incident <b>to</b> <b>justify</b> <b>the</b> deployment of combat troops to South Vietnam in the event the U.S. remained circumspect. Domestically, the incident was reported to have increased plotting against Diệm by his officers.|$|E

25|$|The constitution's {{preamble}} is {{much longer}} than its counterpart in the federal Constitution. Much of that length is devoted <b>to</b> <b>justifying</b> <b>the</b> authority behind the new constitution: that the new constitution was created {{under the authority of}} the constitution of 1835, which was itself created under the authority of the 1796 convention.|$|R

5|$|Ireland {{continued}} as {{a patchwork of}} rival kingdoms but, beginning in the 7th century, a concept of national kingship gradually became articulated through {{the concept of a}} High King of Ireland. Medieval Irish literature portrays an almost unbroken sequence of High Kings stretching back thousands of years but modern historians believe the scheme was constructed in the 8th century <b>to</b> <b>justify</b> <b>the</b> status of powerful political groupings by projecting the origins of their rule into the remote past.|$|E
5|$|On December 12, 1916, Italy demanded {{explanations}} {{from the}} French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, through its ambassador, {{stating that the}} establishment of the Autonomous Albanian Republic of Korçë violated the Treaty of London. Austria-Hungary used the French precedent in Korçë <b>to</b> <b>justify</b> <b>the</b> proclamation of the independence of Albania under its protectorate on January 3, 1917 in Shkodër. The Kingdom of Italy followed suit when proclaiming the independence of Albania under its protectorate on June 23, 1917 in Gjirokastra.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the passing}} of the Holocaust denial law in 1995, it is illegal to deny or attempt <b>to</b> <b>justify</b> <b>the</b> Holocaust. The act follows the Belgian Anti-Racism Law, passed in 1981, which led to the {{establishment}} of the Centre for Equal Opportunities and Opposition to Racism, which researches racism and anti-Semitism in Belgium as well as aiding victims of discrimination. Breendonk and Dossin Barracks (at the site of the former Mechelen transit camp) are preserved as museums to the Holocaust and to German repression in Belgium during the occupation.|$|E

5|$|The conservationists, governments, and {{non-governmental}} organizations that endorse the strategy {{argue that it}} fosters {{public support for the}} protection of elephants and that it sends a message to poachers their work is futile. Critics contend that the technique may increase poaching by creating a perception of scarcity that increases ivory's value on the black market, and that evidence for the technique's effectiveness is insufficient <b>to</b> <b>justify</b> <b>the</b> opportunity cost for countries struggling with poverty.|$|E
5|$|To {{expand his}} power, Napoleon used these {{assassination}} plots <b>to</b> <b>justify</b> <b>the</b> {{creation of an}} imperial system based on the Roman model. He believed that a Bourbon restoration would be more difficult if his family's succession was entrenched in the constitution. Launching yet another referendum, Napoleon was elected as Emperor of the French by a tally exceeding 99%. As with the Life Consulate two years earlier, this referendum produced heavy participation, bringing out almost 3.6 million voters to the polls.|$|E
5|$|Upon release, ODST {{became the}} top-selling Xbox 360 game worldwide. The title {{received}} generally positive reviews from critics, who praised the atmosphere, music, and story approach. Reviewers were divided {{on whether the}} relatively short campaign and included extras were enough <b>to</b> <b>justify</b> <b>the</b> game's US$60 price tag. The game was the top-selling title in the United States in September 2009, and sold more than 3million copies worldwide. Softpedia, Time, and Wired were among publications that declared the game one of the year's best.|$|E

5|$|A {{proposal}} {{was made to}} call a special session to repeal the law, and Bradley {{was in favor of}} the action, but a poll of the legislators showed that too many of them were noncommittal <b>to</b> <b>justify</b> <b>the</b> call. Republicans organized a test case against the law, but the Kentucky Court of Appeals found it constitutional. As leader of the party, Goebel essentially hand-picked the members of the Election Commission. He chose three staunch Democrats – W. S. Pryor, former chief justice of the Kentucky Court of Appeals; W. T. Ellis, former U. S. Representative from Daviess County; and C. B. Poyntz, former head of the state railroad commission.|$|E
5|$|As {{far as the}} Belgians were concerned, the Dyle Plan had advantages. Instead of {{the limited}} Allied advance to the Scheldt, or meeting the Germans on the Franco-Belgian border, the move to the Dyle river would reduce the Allied front in central Belgium by , freeing more forces {{for use as a}} {{strategic}} reserve. It was felt it would save more Belgian territory, in particular the eastern industrial regions. It also had the advantage of absorbing Dutch and Belgian Army formations (including some 20 Belgian divisions). Gamelin was <b>to</b> <b>justify</b> <b>the</b> Dyle Plan after the defeat using these arguments.|$|E
5|$|Described as the {{definitive}} deathblow to democracy in Guatemala, the coup was widely criticized internationally, {{and contributed to}} long-lasting anti-U.S. sentiment in Latin America. Attempting <b>to</b> <b>justify</b> <b>the</b> coup, the CIA launched Operation PBHISTORY, which sought evidence of Soviet influence in Guatemala among documents from the Árbenz era: the effort was a failure. Castillo Armas quickly assumed dictatorial powers, banning opposition parties, imprisoning and torturing political opponents, and reversing the social reforms of the revolution. Nearly four decades of civil war followed, as leftist guerrillas fought a series of U.S.-backed authoritarian regimes whose brutalities included a genocide of the Maya peoples.|$|E

50|$|The {{approach}} for internal set theory {{is the same}} as that for any new axiomatic system - we construct a model for the new axioms using the elements of a simpler, more trusted, axiom scheme. This is quite similar <b>to</b> <b>justifying</b> <b>the</b> consistency of the axioms of non-Euclidean geometry by noting they can be modeled by an appropriate interpretation of great circles on a sphere in ordinary 3-space.|$|R
5|$|Domitian firmly {{believed}} in the traditional Roman religion, and personally {{saw to it that}} ancient customs and morals were observed throughout his reign. In order <b>to</b> <b>justify</b> <b>the</b> divine nature of the Flavian rule, Domitian emphasized connections with the chief deity Jupiter, perhaps most significantly through the impressive restoration of the Temple of Jupiter on the Capitoline Hill. A small chapel dedicated to Jupiter Conservator was also constructed near the house where Domitian had fled to safety on 20 December 69. Later in his reign, he replaced it with a more expansive building, dedicated to Jupiter Custos.|$|E
5|$|Drawing {{inspiration}} from the Mario series, Yoshizawa kept the same title but changed everything else; it became a platformer {{as opposed to a}} beat 'em up such as Double Dragon; the gameplay was modeled after Konami's Castlevania, with Ryu being equipped with a katana-like Dragon Sword, shurikens, and ninpo techniques such as fire wheels. In designing the protagonist Ryu Hayabusa, the development team wanted him to be unique from other ninjas. They designed him with a ninja vest in order to place emphasis on his muscles, and they furnished him with a cowl that arched outward. They originally wanted to equip Ryu with sensors and a helmet with an inside monitor to check his surroundings, but that idea was scrapped. According to Kato, they utilized specific locations and environments <b>to</b> <b>justify</b> <b>the</b> need for having a ninja for a main character.|$|E
5|$|Himmler was a main {{architect}} of the Holocaust, using his deep belief in the racist Nazi ideology <b>to</b> <b>justify</b> <b>the</b> murder of millions of victims. The Nazis planned to kill Polish intellectuals and restrict non-Germans in the General Government and conquered territories to a fourth-grade education. The Nazis wanted to breed a master race of racially pure Nordic Aryans in Germany. As an agronomist and farmer Himmler was acquainted {{with the principles of}} selective breeding, which he proposed to apply to humans. He believed that he could engineer the German populace, for example, through eugenics, to be Nordic in appearance within several decades {{of the end of the}} war.|$|E

It is imperative that a study of the plant be carried out with a view <b>to</b> <b>justifying</b> <b>the</b> claims by the traditional users and possibly isolating and characterizing the compound(s) responsible for the perceived activity. We now report the isolation and characterization of a bioactive compound from the leaves of P. crassipes and its antimicrobial properties.|$|R

The author of the Memoria was dedicated <b>to</b> <b>justifying</b> <b>the</b> independence of the County of Ribagorza from both Aragon and Navarre and probably saw Arnau Mir as the strongest candidate with connexions to the old line of the counts of Ribagorza who could resist the regional hegemonic powers.|$|R
