50|$|The Souders-Brown {{equation}} (named after Mott Souders and George Granger Brown) {{has been}} a tool for obtaining the maximum allowable vapor velocity in vapor-liquid separation vessels (variously called flash drums, knockout drums, knockout pots, compressor suction drums and compressor inlet drums). It has also been used for the same purpose in designing <b>trayed</b> fractionating columns, <b>trayed</b> absorption columns and other vapor-liquid-contacting columns.|$|E
50|$|Stripping {{is mainly}} {{conducted}} in <b>trayed</b> towers (plate columns) and packed columns, and less often in spray towers, bubble columns, and centrifugal contactors.|$|E
50|$|As {{mentioned}} previously, strippers can be <b>trayed</b> or packed. Packed columns, {{and particularly}} when random packing is used, are usually favored for smaller columns with a diameter less than 2 feet and a packed height of {{not more than}} 20 feet. Packed columns can also be advantageous for corrosive fluids, high foaming fluids, when fluid velocity is high, and when particularly low pressure drop is desired. <b>Trayed</b> strippers are advantageous because of ease of design and scale up. Structured packing can be used similar to trays despite possibly being the same material as dumped (random) packing. Using structured packing is a common method to increase the capacity for separation or to replace damaged trays.|$|E

50|$|Stripping is a {{physical}} separation process where one or more components are removed from a liquid stream by a vapor stream. In industrial applications the liquid and vapor streams can have co-current or countercurrent flows. Stripping is usually carried out in either a packed or <b>trayed</b> column.|$|E
50|$|Packed columns {{are similar}} to <b>trayed</b> columns in that the liquid and vapor flows enter and exit in the same manner. The {{difference}} is that in packed towers there are no trays. Instead, packing is used to increase the contact area between the liquid and vapor phases. There are {{many different types of}} packing used and each one has advantages and disadvantages.|$|E
50|$|<b>Trayed</b> towers {{consist of}} a {{vertical}} column with liquid flowing in the top and out the bottom. The vapor phase enters {{in the bottom of}} the column and exits out of the top. Inside of the column are trays or plates. These trays force the liquid to flow back and forth horizontally while the vapor bubbles up through holes in the trays. The purpose of these trays is to increase the amount of contact area between the liquid and vapor phases.|$|E
40|$|A new <b>tray,</b> the 95 <b>tray,</b> was {{designed}} {{on the basis}} of numerical calculations. A pilot-scale setup was established to evaluate the hydrodynamic properties of the 95 <b>tray.</b> Experimental data on the flow patterns, pressure drop, weeping, and downcomer liquid backup were obtained and analyzed, and the equations for calculating the <b>tray</b> pressure drop and downcomer backup were thus derived. The flow pattern for the 95 <b>tray</b> is nearly in an ideal mode if suitable deflectors are set. The per <b>tray</b> pressure drop for the 95 <b>tray</b> is approximately one-half of that for a conventional sieve <b>tray</b> in the range of medium to high vapor flow rates, and the divergence of the per <b>tray</b> pressure drop between the two kinds of <b>trays</b> is increased with increasing vapor flow rate. It is demonstrated that the 95 <b>tray</b> can offer the advantages of a lower pressure drop and a larger capacity. The weeping curve for the 95 <b>tray</b> is found to be a little lower than that for the conventional <b>tray...</b>|$|R

5000|$|Ice cube <b>trays</b> are {{designed}} to be filled with water, then placed in a freezer until the water freezes into ice, producing ice cubes. <b>Trays</b> are often flexible, so the frozen cubes can be easily removed by flexing the <b>tray.</b> [...] "Twist" [...] ice <b>trays</b> have a simple spring-loaded mechanism with a lever that is used to turn the <b>tray</b> upside down and flex at the same time such that the cubes drop are collected in a removable <b>tray</b> below and return the ice cube <b>tray</b> to its upright position without removing it from the freezer, which can save time and reduces accidents and mess, though the <b>tray</b> has to be removed to be collected and the ice cube <b>tray</b> still has to be removed to be refilled.

50|$|<b>Trayed</b> {{strippers}} {{can have}} sieve, valve, or bubble cap trays while packed strippers can have either structured packing or random packing. Trays and packing {{are used to}} increase the contact area over which mass transfer can occur as mass transfer theory dictates. Packing can have varying material, surface area, flow area, and associated pressure drop. Older generation packing include ceramic Raschig rings and Berl saddles. More common packing materials are metal and plastic Pall rings, metal and plastic Zbigniew Białecki rings, and ceramic Intalox saddles. Each packing material of this newer generation improves the surface area, the flow area, and/or the associated pressure drop across the packing. Also important, {{is the ability of}} the packing material to not stack on top of itself. If such stacking occurs, it drastically reduces the surface area of the material. Lattice design work has been increasing of late that will further improve these characteristics.|$|E
5000|$|The {{renovation}} plans {{drawn up}} by the architectural firms of Mancini•Duffy and Peter Silling & Associates called for 12 suites and 27 standard guest rooms.

Each suite also had a fireplace. Each guest room was unique, with its own color and design scheme and unique furnishings (designed by Silling & Associates). Furnishings in each room included one-of-a-kind artworks; silk curtains; custom, hand-upholstered furniture; and glass-enclosed rainfall showers. Each guest room contained a television, but in suites these were mirror TVs. Anticipated hotel amenities included an indoor bar, rooftop cocktail lounge, fitness center, [...] "signature" [...] restaurant, outdoor dining area along the canal, spa, indoor and outdoor swimming pool, and wine cellar with attached wine bar.

40|$|This article {{presents}} an extensive {{study on the}} gas holdup, axial liquid dispersion, and mass transfer for packed, <b>trayed,</b> and empty bubble columns. Four types of structured packings (Super-Pak, Flexipac, Mellapak, and Gauze) and two types of perforated partition trays (with 25 % and 40 % tray open area) were used to characterize the packed and <b>trayed</b> bubble columns, respectively.

Although the gannin are often por <b>trayed</b> in contemporaneous documents as “disorderly， ” the gannin maintained a nationwide administrative apparatus supported by the bakufu. To the rank-and-file gannin, this hierarchical organization, which at first may have served the interests of the gannin themselves, appears to have become sometmng of a burden.

40|$|Modeling and {{simulating}} {{distillation columns}} {{is not a}} new enterprise. All of the models described in the literature either contain algebraic loops or simplifying assumptions that render the model ill-equipped for dynamic simulations. The structure and the equations that represent a <b>trayed</b> distillation column are explored using bond graphs. Bond graphs model the power flow in a system, an inherently instructive way to view complex systems. The power of bond graphs is evident by providing a clear, graphical representation of a distillation column that systematically organizes the equations and possible approximations. The model of a distillation column is explored in general and then by using a specific model developed by Steven Gallun. Results of this study reveal several ways of eliminating the algebraic loops and producing a dynamic model. The bond graph model can be expanded by introducing other elements including chemical reactions and thermal interaction with other columns...|$|E

40|$|This study {{explores the}} best {{suitable}} internals and various feed configurations of a reactive distillation process for unsaturated polyester synthesis. Multi-product simulations {{were performed to}} find the operational parameters for producing different grades of polyester in the same equipment. The product transition time during product changeover is determined for various configurations and product grades. The selection criteria for the best configuration are the minimum requirements of volume and energy to produce 100 ktpy polyesters. The results of the rigorous simulations carried out in Aspen Custom Modeler show that the best configurations employ the reactive stripping section as a packed or <b>trayed</b> bubble column, and the reactive rectifying section as a packed column. With respect to the feed configuration, the feeding of monoesters to the RD column significantly intensifies the polyester process as compared to an anhydrous reactant fed directly to the column.
