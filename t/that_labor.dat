5|$|By {{the end of}} June 2013, Labor's {{standing}} in the polls had worsened, and the Coalition had been leading in most opinion polls for two years; one poll in early June showed <b>that</b> <b>Labor</b> would be reduced to as few as 40 seats after the next election. With a general election due later that year, even some staunch Gillard supporters began to believe <b>that</b> <b>Labor</b> faced almost certain defeat if Gillard continued as leader. According to the ABC's Barrie Cassidy, the question was not whether Gillard would be ousted as Labor leader, but when the ousting would take place.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{instigator}} for {{the creation}} of the LM in 1972 had been based around the lack of electoral reform. The electoral system had been expected to continue to return rural LCL members in the Legislative Council, yet at the 1973 state election Labor had, through the mass registration of new voters for the council vote, managed to gain two seats, giving a 14–6 split in the council. As half the council was elected at each election, Labor only had to retain their vote to gain an additional two seats at the 1975 state election, and a minor rise in it would see additional council seats fall to them. It was increasingly plausible <b>that</b> <b>Labor</b> would be able to gain a majority in the Legislative Council within a decade and then carry through their goal of abolishing it, and push through any electoral legislation it so wished.|$|E
5|$|Alone with Shuu, Ryouta finally remembers {{what he had}} {{forgotten}} due to the traumatic nature of the events: he recognizes the doctor {{as a man who}} promised to grant his wish for peace between birds and humans after he and the protagonist witnessed a human terrorist incident at a bird orphanage in which the protagonist's parents, crisis negotiators, were killed, and that the protagonist died when she visited him in the infirmary. It is revealed that she died by Charon virus after coming in contact with Ryouta, as Shuu had induced the virus into Ryouta's body though grafts from Nageki's remains for the purpose of using him to exterminate humanity—since there can be no more fighting between two factions if one is wiped out, this would grant Ryouta's wish. Shuu then remarks <b>that</b> <b>Labor</b> 9 was powered by the protagonist's now irreversibly damaged brain. A broken Ryouta submits to Shuu's offer of becoming a living weapon of mass destruction after these revelations, and a struggle ensues during which the protagonist's spirit intervenes. Ryouta then asks Shuu why he decided to grant his wish, to which it is implied that Shuu's affection towards Ryouta's deceased father, Ryuuji, was greater than Shuu himself would like to admit, and that he was motivated by Ryuuji's dying request: to do something for his son.|$|E

25|$|However, {{successive}} redistributions, {{along with}} demographic change, {{had made the}} once safe Liberal seat much friendlier to Labor; much of the area was represented by Labor at the state level.

25|$|Although the Coalition {{fared better}} in polls of voting intention, the Liberals and Nationals {{consistently}} trailed Labor. According to Newspoll, the Coalition has not led the ALP since early 2006. Pollster Roy Morgan says <b>that</b> <b>Labor</b> has consistently led the Coalition since Iemma became premier. The most recent Roy Morgan figure showed Labor well ahead, 60.5% to 39.5%, on a two-party-preferred basis.|$|E

After all, both the miner's union and the fledgling mill worker's unions had been destroyed.

The miners had struck in sympathy with the smeltermen, but other unions—notably, craft unions—had not.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the factor <b>that</b> affecting <b>labor</b> productivity in Malaysia. The variables consists motivation, management support, supervision and technological are stated as independent variables for this study. The finding showed that only three variables have significant relationship which are motivation, supervision and technological. Thus, these variables consider the factors <b>that</b> affecting <b>labor</b> productivity in Malaysia. Meanwhile, one variable that showed negative relationship is management support which considers not the factors <b>that</b> affecting <b>labor</b> productivity in Malaysia. 150 sets of questionnaires were distributed randomly. The result of the study presented in this research agrees that motivation, supervision and technological are the factors <b>that</b> affecting <b>labor</b> productivity. This study can be seen as a foreword to a more detailed study to be carrying by future research on the issue of labor productivity in Malaysia...|$|R

This led Woll to oppose the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, which Woll saw as merely more government intervention in the workplace.|$|R
50|$|Herbert {{featured}} the closest result of any {{division at the}} 2016 federal election. Following a recount, the Australian Electoral Commission confirmed on 31 July <b>that</b> <b>Labor's</b> Cathy O'Toole defeated the LNP incumbent by 37 votes, becoming the first Labor member to win the seat since 1996. The LNP considered a legal challenge to the result.|$|R
25|$|The {{campaign}} {{began with}} Labor leading in all published national opinion polls. On 31 August, Newspoll published in The Australian newspaper gave Labor a lead of 52% to 48% nationwide, which would {{translate into a}} comfortable win for Labor in terms of seats. Most commentators, however, expected the election to be very close, pointing out <b>that</b> <b>Labor</b> was also ahead in the polls at the comparable point of the 1998 election, which Howard won.|$|E
25|$|The {{result was}} <b>that</b> <b>Labor</b> had 44 seats, the Coalition 43, and Gladstone {{independent}} Liz Cunningham held the remaining seat. If Labor were {{to win the}} seat, they would regain their one-seat majority, but if they lost it and the House was equally divided, then Cunningham {{would be able to}} select the government. She refused to indicate which way she would lean, arguing that Mundingburra electors should cast their vote first without undue pressure.|$|E

25|$|The Australian Government did {{not hold}} a {{majority}} in the Senate, and thus required the support of the opposition Labor party, the Greens, Democrats, or independent senators in order to secure ratification. The Government put heavy pressure on Labor Party leader Mark Latham to secure Opposition support of the agreement (knowing that Latham, among many Labor members, viewed the FTA as beneficial). The issue had divided the party, with the Left faction in particular arguing <b>that</b> <b>Labor</b> should reject the agreement.|$|E
25|$|Labor {{retained}} majority {{government after}} an unexpected strong performance, winning 14 of the 25 seats, despite a 2.6% decrease in their primary vote. Early in the counting Tourism Minister Paula Wriedt seemed {{likely to lose}} her seat in Franklin to Liberal candidate Vanessa Goodwin, however after preference distribution she secured the final vacancy. Labor's vote increased slightly in Bass, where former federal politician Michelle O'Byrne topped the poll. Media commentators claimed <b>that</b> <b>Labor</b> would take the final seat in Bass where the Greens were short of a quota, however ALP candidate Steve Reissig narrowly missed out and the Greens held their seat.|$|E
25|$|Labor spies may be {{referred}} to as spies, operatives, agents, agents provocateurs, saboteurs, infiltrators, informants, spotters, plants, special police, or detectives. However, Dr. Richard C. Cabot, Professor of Social Ethics at Harvard, observed <b>that</b> <b>labor</b> spies are different from our normal view of detectives. While detectives investigate people suspected of crimes, the labor spy shadows and spies upon people who are not suspected of having committed any crime, nor are they suspected of planning any crime. During the mid-to-late-19th century, a period during which there was intense distaste for the detective profession, the Pinkerton and Thiel detective agencies referred to their field agents as operatives or testers. The Pinkerton logo inspired the expression private eye.|$|E
