5|$|Apical {{periodontitis}} is acute {{or chronic}} inflammation around {{the apex of}} a tooth caused by an immune response to bacteria within an infected pulp. It does not occur because of pulp necrosis, meaning that a tooth that <b>tests</b> <b>as</b> if it's alive (vital) may cause apical periodontitis, and a pulp which has become non-vital due to a sterile, non-infectious processes (such as trauma) may not cause any apical periodontitis. Bacterial cytotoxins reach the region around {{the roots of the}} tooth via the apical foramina and lateral canals, causing vasodilation, sensitization of nerves, osteolysis (bone resorption) and potentially abscess or cyst formation.|$|E
5|$|Based on the {{analysis}} of rat and human urine by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry, mephedrone {{is thought to be}} metabolised by three phase 1 pathways. It can be demethylated to the primary amine (producing compounds 2, 3 and 5), the ketone group can be reduced (producing 3) or the tolyl group can be oxidised (producing 6). Both 5 and 6 are thought to be further metabolised by conjugation to the glucuronide and sulfate derivatives. Knowledge of the primary routes of metabolism should allow the intake of mephedrone to be confirmed by drug <b>tests,</b> <b>as</b> well as more accurate determination of the causes of side effects and potential for toxicity.|$|E

Jackson was first choice to lead the England team, {{but when he was}} unavailable, MacLaren was {{appointed}} captain, to the approval of critics and the public. MacLaren began the season well for Lancashire, and as Australia struggled in their early tour matches, England began the <b>Tests</b> <b>as</b> favourites to win.

The draw meant that the series was at 1–1 heading into the final Test at The Oval, which would be timeless.|$|E

5|$|The tests {{conducted}} {{in preparation for}} the parade revealed a number of flaws in the design including poor directional stability, a cramped cockpit without heating or ventilation, poor access to the engine, inadequate fuel capacity, compounded by the lack of a fuel gauge, and poor elevator control forces. Five aircraft were modified to correct these issues before resuming the factory's testing in late 1946. The modifications were not entirely successful and the lateral stability was now too great and the elevator forces remained too weak. Engine problems, however, plagued the <b>tests</b> <b>as</b> the first prototype alone required four engine changes.|$|E

He became the RFU President in 1950 and following his retirement from politics was awarded the title the first Baron Wakefield of Kendal.|$|E
