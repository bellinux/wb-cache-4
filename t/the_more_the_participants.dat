50|$|Reciprocity is {{not only}} a strong {{determining}} factor of human behavior; it is a powerful method for gaining one's compliance with a request. The rule of reciprocity has the power to trigger feelings of indebtedness even when faced with an uninvited favor and irrespective of liking the person who executed the favor. In 1971, Dennis Regan tested the strength of these two aspects of reciprocity in a study where participants believed they were in an art appreciation experiment with a partner, Joe, who was really Regan's assistant. During the experiment, Joe would disappear and bring back a soft drink for the participant. After this phase of the experiment was over, Joe would ask the participant to buy raffle tickets from him. <b>The</b> <b>more</b> <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> liked Joe, the more likely they were to buy raffle tickets from him. However, when Joe had given them a soda and thus indebted them to reciprocate, it made no difference whether the participants liked Joe or not, the rule of reciprocity overpowered liking. Thus, individuals who we might not even like have the power to greatly increase our chances of doing them a favor simply by providing us with a small gift or favor prior to their request. Furthermore, we are obliged to receive these gifts and favors which reduces our ability to choose to whom we wish to be indebted.|$|E

40|$|According to the Hindustani music tradition, {{the ability}} of a song to induce certain {{emotions}} depends on the time of day: playing a song at the right time is said to maximise its emotional effect. The present exploratory study investigated this claim by combining findings in chronobiology, mood research and music perception. It has already been established that some aspects of our mood fluctuations follow a cyclical pattern. Besides, it is a known fact that our current mood influences our perception and assessment of emotions. However, these elements have never been linked together in a study examining the effect of mood cyclicity on perceived emotions in music. To test the hypothesis of a link between the two, Western film music excerpts were played to 36 participants at two different times (9 am and 4 pm).

In addition to several other influences, affective states seem to support exercise participation. Associations between exercise and affect have been shown in the laboratory. However, the dynamic relation between affect and exercise in daily life is not yet well understood. The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the bi-directional effect of momentary affective states on naturally occurring exercise and vice versa in healthy participants in real-life environments by applying an ecological momentary assessment design. We hypothesized that (1) exercise duration is positively associated with affective states on a day level, (2) affective states in the morning predict subsequent exercise duration, and (3) exercise duration predicts affective states in the evening on that respective day. Data from N = 60 students aged between 19 and 32 years were analyzed. Affect and exercise duration were assessed daily over a period of 20 days via an electronic diary. Multilevel analysis revealed that positive affective valence was positively associated with exercise duration (p = 0. 003) on a day level. In addition, <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> exercised that respective day, the better and more content they felt in the evening (p = 0. 009).

However, it is unclear whether or not these coping preferences are differentially related to indices of psychological adjustment. The primary goal of the current study was to evaluate the within-ethnic group and between-ethnic group relations between coping and daily positive/negative affect. Using the internet-based daily diary method, 254 participants (Caucasian = 140, Asian = 114) completed the questionnaires that assessed their daily stressors, preferred coping strategies, and psychological well-being across five consecutive days. The findings indicated that Asian-American college students used more avoidant-oriented coping strategies than did Caucasian college students, specifically, religion and minimization (avoidance) methods. Ethnicity, however, did not moderate the relationship between coping and daily affect. A number of main effects relating coping strategies to daily affect were found in the overall student sample. Humor, religion, minimization, problem-focused support, social support, and rumination all predicted daily positive affect. <b>The</b> <b>more</b> <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> used these strategies (relative to their average daily use), the higher their levels of positive affect. Humor, religion, social support, and rumination also predicted negative affect. Higher usage of humor (relative to an individual's average daily use of humor) was associated with less negative affect, but higher use of religion, social support, and emotional rumination (relative to an individual's average daily use of these coping strategies) was associated with higher negative affect. While the findings support the notion that Asian-American students tend to use more avoidant coping strategies than do Caucasian students, this did not translate into poorer psychological health...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis {{functional}} {{magnetic resonance}} imaging (fMRI) study investigated the brain regions underlying language task performance in adult second language (L 2) learners. Specifically, we identified brain regions where the level of activation was associated with L 2 fluency levels. Thirty Japanese-speaking adults participated in <b>the</b> study. All <b>participants</b> were L 2 learners of English and had achieved varying levels of fluency, as determined by a standardized L 2 English proficiency test, the Versant English Test (Pearson Education Inc., 2011). When <b>participants</b> performed <b>the</b> oral sentence building task from the production tasks administered, the dorsal part of the left inferior frontal gyrus (dIFG) showed activation patterns that differed depending on the L 2 fluency levels: <b>The</b> <b>more</b> fluent <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> were, <b>the</b> <b>more</b> dIFG activation decreased. This decreased activation of the dIFG might reflect the increased automaticity of a syntactic building process. In contrast, when participants performed an oral story comprehension task, the left posterior superior temporal gyrus (pSTG) showed increased activation with higher fluency levels. This suggests that the learners with higher L 2 fluency were actively engaged in post-syntactic integration processing supported by the left pSTG. These data imply that L 2 fluency predicts neural resource allocation during language comprehension tasks as well as in production tasks. This study sheds light on the neural underpinnings of L 2 learning by identifying the brain regions recruited during different language tasks across different modalities (production vs. comprehension) ...|$|R
40|$|Inferring {{intentions}} of others {{is one of}} the most intriguing issues in interpersonal interaction. Theories of embodied cognition and simulation suggest that this mechanism takes place through a direct and automatic matching process that occurs between an observed action and past actions. This process occurs via the reactivation of past self-related sensorimotor experiences within the inferior frontoparietal network (including the mirror neuron system, MNS). The working model is that the anticipatory representations of others' behaviors require internal predictive models of actions formed from pre-established, shared representations between the observer and the actor. This model suggests that observers should be better at predicting intentions performed by a familiar actor, rather than a stranger. However, little is known about the modulations of the intention brain network as a function of the familiarity between the observer and the actor. Here, we combined functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with a behavioral intention inference task, in which participants were asked to predict intentions from three types of actors: A familiar actor (their significant other), themselves (another familiar actor), and a non-familiar actor (a stranger). Our results showed that the participants were better at inferring intentions performed by familiar actors than non-familiar actors and that this better performance was associated with greater activation within and beyond the inferior frontoparietal network i. e., in brain areas related to familiarity (e. g., precuneus). In addition, and in line with Hebbian principles of neural modulations, <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> reported being cognitively close to their partner, the less the brain areas associated with action self-other comparison (e. g., inferior parietal lobule), attention (e. g., superior parietal lobule), recollection (hippocampus), and pair bond (ventral tegmental area, VTA) were recruited, suggesting that the more a shared mental representation has been pre-established, the more neurons show suppression in their response to the presentation of information to which they are sensitive. These results suggest that the relation of performance to the extent of neural activation during intention understanding may display differential relationships based on the cognitive domain, brain region, and the cognitive interdependence between the observer and the actor...|$|E
40|$|The general aim of {{the present}} thesis was to {{investigate}} the determinants of car users’ switching to public transport when driving to work. Since the quality of services is particularly low in medium-sized cities, making the car a much more attractive option, the studies focus on car-use in such cities. Four studies were conducted. In the first (Paper I), an Internet survey addressing what people using their cars to commute to work in a medium-size city believe would make them reduce their car-use as well as what improvements to public transport services they believe would make them use those services was conducted. The results showed that, the further to work and/or bus stops - <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> desired increased frequencies and shorter travel times, but less often lower fares. In the second study (Paper II), using a web-based experimental simulation, participants were given the task of planning their travel to and from work, including the performing of additional activities in accordance with predetermined agendas. The main results of this were that shorter travel times and good access to bus stops led to greater bus use while constraints imposed by a busy daily agenda led to greater car-use, in particular if car costs were low. In the third study (Paper III) a scale for measuring satisfaction with travel was developed. A new measure of travel-related subjective well-being (SWB), a 9 -item self-report Satisfaction with Travel Scale (STS), was developed. The results showed that STS is reliable and differentiates between changes in travel conditions. In the fourth study (Paper IV) which attributes other than time and cost contribute to the preference of car over bus in the choice of travel mode was investigated. Using STS, developed in Paper III the effect of different travel modes on satisfaction with travel was studied. The conclusions of this thesis are that a public transport system must appear attractive, not only to its present users, but also to prospective users who currently use their cars. To appear attractive, it must not be too expensive and must have timetables and routes that allow users to travel in an efficient manner. One measure {{that can be used to}} force commuters out of their cars is higher car-use costs; however, car-use costs may need to be substantially higher than the cost of using public transport in order to be effective. As the present research has indicated, the perceived difficulty of using public transport is also an important factor. Raising car-use costs will thus be insufficient unless changes are made to public transport services. A factor complicating this is activity patterns, which are often complex. As has been indicated in the present research, the more complex the activity pattern - the more the car is used as a means of transport...|$|E
40|$|Researchers {{have not}} been able to {{ascertain}} how survivors of childhood trauma, especially sexual abuse, develop resilience. To explore resilience and what influences its development, this mixed-method study investigated the roles of cognitive emotion regulation and proactive coping by using a critical-realist ontology. The data was collected from eight women (between ages 25 and 56) who considered themselves to be resilient survivors of severe child sexual abuse. Harvey’s (2000) Multidimensional Trauma Recovery and Resiliency Interview (MTRR-I), the Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (Garnefski, Kraaij&Spinhoven, 2002) and Greenglass’s (1999) Proactive Coping Inventory were used to gather the data necessary to determine whether resilience is influenced by cognitive emotion regulation strategies and proactive coping and to attempt to define what could be considered as traits of resilience in survivors or child sexual abuse. Through thematic analysis, approximately 50 a-priori codes were generated and grouped into 23 themes using the Atlas. ti program. The objective of this study is to explore the relationship between cognitive emotion regulation, proactive coping and resilience in order to better understand, and develop intervention processes that can provide survivors of child sexual abuse and other trauma with the resources needed to be more resilient. Although causality could not be determined between these variables, it became evident that the more often a participant employs adaptive cognitive emotion regulation strategies and the higher the scores on the Proactive Coping Inventory are, the more resilient the participant tends to be. The participants who displayed higher levels of resilience also verbalised that they felt they had dealt with the abuse and had managed to move on in their lives. Even though all the participants considered themselves to be resilient, half of them were functioning at a noticeably lower rate of resilience than the others. All the participants claimed to rely on spiritual strength in some way and attribute their resilience to their faith in God. The higher the levels of resilience, <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> used adaptive cognitive emotion regulation strategies and proactive coping; and the more optimistic their views of the future and the more they considered their lives to be meaningful. Because the study was based on the ecological model of human development (Bronfenbrenner, 1995, 2005,) the interplay of the proximal environment, the individual, the social context and the changes that have taken place over time, were all taken into consideration because resilience, cognitive emotion regulation and proactive coping skills all develop within and between the same systems in which an individual develops. However, Bronfenbrenner (2005) states that the family is no longer taking the responsibility for the upbringing of children as it should and that other settings in society have had to step in to fulfil the role. One aspect of mental health is the ability to develop spiritually and since schools may not include religious instruction because it is the responsibility of the family, it happens that children are not being developed spiritually and this could influence the way in which individuals deal with traumatic childhood experiences.

40|$|Introduction: The {{extensive}} {{knowledge of}} experts facilitates the solving of domain- specific problems. In general, {{this is due}} to the fact that experts recall more detailed information than do novices or even advanced students. However, if physicians of different expertise levels are asked to write down the details of a given case, advanced medical students recall more information than experts. This phenomenon was called the 'intermediate effect' and is considered to be a specific feature of medical expertise. The aim of the here presented study was to examine this observation in the domain of dental medicine. Materials and methods: Sixty-one students and 20 specialised dentists participated in this study. Three clinical case descriptions were presented and afterwards <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> were told to write down all concrete information they remembered. Finally, they had to come up with a diagnosis. Interrater agreement, diagnostic accuracy and the recall explanation protocols were analysed statistically in comparison to state-of-the-art (canonical) explanations of the clinical cases. Results: The mean interrater agreement was 96. 2 ± 3. 37 %. It was shown statistically that <b>the</b> <b>more</b> experienced <b>the</b> <b>participants,</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> accurate their diagnoses were (P < 0. 001). The statistical analysis using the Games-Howell test demonstrated significant <b>more</b> written recall of <b>the</b> 5 th-year students compared with 3 rd- and 4 th-year students and experts (P < 0. 05). Conclusion: The results of this study suggest the existence of the intermediate effect in clinical case recall in dental medicine and thereby corroborate its importance and general applicability for different medical domains...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe authors {{examined}} {{associations of}} health behaviors over a 17 -year period, separately and in combination, with cognition in late midlife in 5, 123 {{men and women}} from the Whitehall II study (United Kingdom). Health behaviors were assessed in early midlife (mean age = 44 years; phase 1, 1985 - 1988), in midlife (mean age = 56 years; phase 5, 1997 - 1999), and in late midlife (mean age = 61 years; phase 7, 2002 - 2004). A score of the number of unhealthy behaviors (smoking, alcohol abstinence, low physical activity, and low fruit and vegetable consumption) was defined as ranging from 0 to 4. Poor (defined as scores in the worst sex-specific quintile) executive function and memory in late midlife (phase 7) were analyzed as outcomes. Compared with those with no unhealthy behaviors, those with 3 - 4 unhealthy behaviors at phase 1 (odds ratio (OR) = 1. 84, 95 % confidence interval (CI) : 1. 27, 2. 65), phase 5 (OR = 2. 38, 95 % CI: 1. 76, 3. 22), and phase 7 (OR = 2. 76, 95 % CI: 2. 04, 3. 73) {{were more likely to have}} poor executive function. A similar association was observed for memory. The odds of poor executive function and memory were <b>the</b> greater <b>the</b> <b>more</b> times <b>the</b> <b>participant</b> reported unhealthy behaviors over the 3 phases. This study suggests that both the number of unhealthy behaviors and their duration are associated with subsequent cognitive function in later life...|$|R
40|$|According to the {{classical}} music tradition of Northern India, {{the ability of a}} song to induce certain emotions depends on the time of day: playing a song at the right time is said to maximise its emotional effect. Transposing this idea into a Western context, I decided to investigate this claim by combining findings in chronobiology with findings in music and emotion. It has already been established that our mood fluctuations follow a cyclical pattern. Besides, it is a known fact that our current mood influences our ability to perceive emotions. However, no one has ever linked these elements together and studied diurnal mood variations and their effect on perceived emotions in music. To test the hypothesis of a link between the two, I played Western film music excerpts to 36 participants at two different times, and asked them to rate the perceived emotions. The results show that sad and tender clips were rated higher on sadness and tenderness in the morning compared to <b>the</b> afternoon. Furthermore, <b>the</b> <b>more</b> tired <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> were, <b>the</b> higher was their perception of fear in angry and fearful music. Looking at conventional medicine, chronopharmacology has already shown that the effects of a drug or the results of a medical test vary depending on when they are administered. Similarly, I believe that by adding the time factor to the planning and interpretation of music therapy sessions, their health benefits could be increased. This last point would need to be investigated further and could be the focus of future studies...|$|R
