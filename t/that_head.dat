5|$|Following {{an early}} {{exit from the}} 2012 Stanley Cup playoffs, the {{off-season}} began with speculation <b>that</b> <b>Head</b> Coach Alain Vigneault might be fired. There were also rumors that General Manager (GM) Mike Gillis could be removed from his position. After an {{end of the year}} meeting with Team Owner Francesco Aquilini, Gillis was given a five-year contract extension. Fifteen days after his new deal, Gillis signed Vigneault to a two-year contract extension.|$|E
5|$|In December 2007, Maryland hired Kansas State {{offensive}} coordinator James Franklin {{to serve in}} that same role for the Terrapins. From 2000 to 2004, he was the Maryland wide receivers coach. In 2003 and 2004, he also served as the recruiting coordinator, and Rivals.com ranked Franklin {{as one of the}} nation's top-25 recruiters both years. Because of the arrival of Franklin, 2008 was the first since 2005 <b>that</b> <b>head</b> coach Ralph Friedgen did not call the offensive plays himself. At Maryland, Franklin installed a West Coast offense, which was well suited to quarterback Chris Turner's playing style and an experienced wide receiver corps that included play-maker Darrius Heyward-Bey and sure-handed Danny Oquendo.|$|E
5|$|After {{a disappointing}} 2012–13 season which saw the Colorado Avalanche finish 15th in the Western Conference and 29th {{overall in the}} League, it was {{announced}} on April 28, 2013, <b>that</b> <b>Head</b> Coach Joe Sacco had been relieved of his duties. On May 10, {{it was announced that}} former long-time Avalanche captain and Hockey Hall of Famer Joe Sakic is set to take on an expanded role in Avalanche management, being named executive vice president of hockey operations, overseeing all matters involving hockey personnel. It was also announced that Josh Kroenke, son of owner Stan Kroenke, is now president of the Avalanche, succeeding Pierre Lacroix. On May 23, Patrick Roy returned to the Avalanche as head coach and vice president of hockey operations. Although Sherman retained his role as general manager, he was largely reduced to an advisory role. Roy and Sakic now share most of the duties held by a general manager on most other NHL teams, though Sakic has the final say on hockey matters.|$|E

5|$|In Game 6, the Flyers lead 3–0 {{four minutes}} into the second period. Maxime Talbot fought Daniel Carcillo after the Flyers tallied their third goal and the Penguins, re-energized by Talbot's display, scored three goals in what {{remained}} of the second period to tie the game 3–3. Sergei Gonchar scored his first goal of the series, his first in 23playoff games dating back to game two of the Penguins' first-round series against Ottawa in 2008, to break the tie at 2:19 of the third period. Crosby added an empty-net goal and the Penguins eliminated the Flyers and advance to the Eastern Conference Semifinals. Three days after the Penguins series-clinching victory of the Flyers, the Penguins announced <b>that</b> <b>Head</b> Coach Dan Bylsma had signed a multi-year contract extension with the team.|$|E

5|$|Ride the Lightning {{received}} {{positive response}} from music critics, {{who saw it}} as a more ambitious effort than its predecessor. Metallica promoted the album on the Bang <b>That</b> <b>Head</b> That Doesn't Bang European tour in late 1984, and on its North American leg {{in the first half of}} 1985. The band performed at a few major music festivals, such as Monsters of Rock and Day on the Green later that year. Two months after its release, Elektra Records signed Metallica to a multi-year contract and reissued the album. Ride the Lightning peaked at number 100 on the Billboard 200 with no radio exposure. Although 75,000 copies were initially pressed for the American market, the album sold half a million by November 1987. It was certified 6× platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in 2012 for shipping six million copies in the United States. Many rock publications have ranked Ride the Lightning on their best album lists, saying it had a lasting impact on the genre.|$|E

5|$|The 2004–05 {{season was}} {{canceled}} {{due to the}} lockout; many Devils players played in European leagues and in the hockey world championships. Patrik Elias, who was playing in the Russian Superleague, contracted hepatitis A. Faced with Elias' indefinite recovery timetable, plus the loss of defensive stalwarts Scott Niedermayer to free agency and Scott Stevens to retirement, Lamoriello signed veteran defenseman Dan McGillis and two former Devils, winger Alexander Mogilny and defenseman Vladimir Malakhov, none of whom finished the season on the ice. In July 2005, the team announced <b>that</b> <b>head</b> coach Pat Burns would not return for the 2005–06 season after being diagnosed with cancer {{for the second time}} in little more than a year. Assistant Coach Larry Robinson, the team's head coach from 2000 to 2002, was promoted to start the season.|$|E
5|$|The {{period of}} time between an injury and {{development}} of epilepsy varies, {{and it is not}} uncommon for an injury to be followed by a latent period with no recurrent seizures. The longer a person goes without developing seizures, the lower the chances are that epilepsy will develop. At least 80–90% of people with PTE have their first seizure within two years of the TBI. People with no seizures within three years of the injury have only a 5% chance of developing epilepsy. However, one study found <b>that</b> <b>head</b> trauma survivors are at an increased risk for PTE as many as 10years after moderate TBI and over 20years after severe TBI. Since head trauma is fairly common and epilepsy can occur late after the injury, it can be difficult to determine whether a case of epilepsy resulted from head trauma in the past or whether the trauma was incidental.|$|E
