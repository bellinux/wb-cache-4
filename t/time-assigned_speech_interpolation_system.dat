First, a more realistic voice model which takes in account the hangover of the speech detector is used, based on ITU-T P- 84 recommendation. Second, the Front End Clipping (FEC) is calculated and taken as a limiting parameter instead of the dropping probability.

40|$|Digital signal <b>interpolation</b> <b>systems</b> can be {{implemented}} {{in a variety of}} ways. The most basic <b>interpolation</b> <b>system</b> for integer upsampling cascades an expander unit with an interpolation lowpass filter. More complex implementations can cascade multiple expander and low-pass filter pairs. There is also flexibility in the design of interpolation filters. This thesis explores how digital <b>interpolation</b> <b>systems</b> for integer upsampling can be efficiently implemented. Efficiency is measured {{in terms of the number}} of multiplications required for each output sample point. The following factors are studied for their effect on system efficiency: the decomposition of an <b>interpolation</b> <b>system</b> into multiple cascaded stages, the use of recursive and nonrecursive interpolation filters, and the use of linear-phase and minimum-phase interpolation filters.

40|$|In daily speech the {{linguistic}} information {{plays a major}} role in the communication between people. However, voice quality and individuality are important in speech recognition and understanding. For instance, it is exceptionally significant to understand and discriminate between two or more speakers in a radio or a television program. Voice individuality, apart from providing the aforementioned advantages in communication, enriches our daily life with variety. For a number of modern applications it is important to create and maintain data bases for different speakers, for example, in gaming, in text-to-speech synthesis and in cartoon movies. This may be time consuming and expensive, depending on the requirements of the application. Speaker interpolation (SI) is the process of producing an intermediate voice between two or more speakers, while voice conversion (VC) is the technique of processing the voice of one person, namely the source speaker, such that his/her voice resembles the voice of another person, namely the target speaker. Moreover, the converted or interpolated speech should sound natural and intelligible. Despite the extended research in VC, high-quality voice conversion has not been achieved yeet. A number of reasons explain this current shortcoming, with the main ones being a) the oversmoothing effect by using of statistical modeling b) inaccurate estimation of the speaker-depended features and c) the inadequacy of the used synthesis methods. Voice conversion methods are based on spectral envelope information, which represents the vocal tract, since it has an important role on speech individuality. In conventional VC the excitation signal of the source speaker is ex- tracted first by inverse filtering. Then this excitation signal is filtered from the vocal tract of the target speaker. In <b>speech</b> <b>interpolation</b> the excitation signal is filtered from an interpolated vocal tract of the given speakers. The scope of this thesis is to deal with this research gap and achieve high quality <b>speech</b> <b>interpolation</b> and voice conversion of parallel corpora using accurate meth- ods for spectral envelope estimation (true envelope), time and frequency alignment (piecewise linear time and frequency warping), and speech synthesis (interpolated lattice filter or overlap and add). With the use of precise methods in each processing step it was expected to reduce the artifacts currently met in voice conversion. In <b>speech</b> <b>interpolation</b> the produced vocal tract is not just an interpolation between the given speakers, but the vocal tract length can be altered, producing a broad range of voices. Hence, given a limited data base a substantially larger one that contains individual speakers for every use can be created...|$|R

Following the Chernobyl accident many European countries have installed monitoring networks to perform this task.

In some cases these were advantaged or multiplied with TASI (Time-Assignment <b>Speech</b> <b>Interpolation)</b> or DCME (Digital Circuit Multiplication Equipment). These transmission methods were not suited to Line or Inter-Register signalling. Taking the signalling function away from the traffic channel could cut costs, and would later lead to Common Channel Signalling. There would be no need for filtering signalling away from speech, and the duty cycle of the costly trunk for each revenue earning call would be better. Signalling time in call set up and clear down would be significantly shorter than with C4 and C5. With telephone signalling not transmitted over the line, the opportunities for fraud were reduced.|$|R

40|$|The {{focus of}} this {{dissertation}} {{is the development of}} resource management schemes for integrated networks, with the major contributions being: (i) the development of an optimal adaptive buffer management scheme for the packet-switched subsystem, (ii) the integration of a moveable-boundary hybrid switching scheme with the time assigned <b>speech</b> <b>interpolation</b> technique for implementing a congestion control mechanism for the packet-switched subsystem, and (iii) the development of an adaptive hierarchical scheme for implementing the access control and routing functions within the circuit-switched subsystem. The problem of buffer management at an integrated network node is formulated as a nonlinear programming problem with a convex objective function and an interative solution technique with fast convergence is proposed for a real-time implementation of the buffer management scheme in practical environments. In order to exercise an additional degree of control over the packet-blocking probability at each hybrid-switched link within the network, a new multiplexing scheme based on the integration of the moveable-boundary hybrid switching scheme and the time assigned <b>speech</b> <b>interpolation</b> technique is presented in this dissertation. The tradeoff between the corresponding decrease in the packet blocking probability and the increase in the circuit freezeout fraction is demonstrated by a detailed queueing analysis of the multiplexer. Specific algorithms are also presented in this dissertation for the solution of the access control and routing problems within the circuit-switched subsystem. In particular, an access control scheme is developed by solving an integer programming problem formulated using the policy of complete partitioning of the available bandwidth among the competing user classes. As an alternative to the completely partitioned approach, the problem of traffic routing is considered in a network that supports homogeneous traffic classes based on the policy of complete sharing. Finally, for the general case of networks with heterogeneous traffic classes, a hierarchical scheme is developed for the implementation of the access control and the routing functions at two functional levels, where the access control is implemented by the network supervisor who solves an appropriate linear integer programming problem periodically, and the routing function is handled by the individual nodes of the network on a distributed basis.
