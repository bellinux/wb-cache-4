5|$|After 17:30 Kamimura led his {{division}} in a fruitless pursuit {{of some of}} the Russian cruisers, leaving Tōgō's battleships to their own devices. He abandoned his chase around 18:03 and turned northwards to rejoin Tōgō. His ships spotted the rear of the Russian battleline around 18:30 and opened fire when <b>the</b> <b>range</b> closed to 8000–9000 meters. Nothing is known of any effect on the Russians and they ceased fire by 19:30 and rejoined Tōgō at 20:08 as night was falling. The surviving Russian ships were spotted the next morning and the Japanese ships opened fire around 10:30, staying beyond <b>the</b> <b>range</b> at which the Russian ships could effectively reply. Rear Admiral Nikolai Nebogatov therefore decided to surrender his ships as he could neither return fire nor close <b>the</b> <b>range.</b>|$|E

5|$|As the Allied {{offensive}} gained steam, Whitehead's {{main task}} was to shift his aircraft forward, advancing the bomb line incrementally towards Japan.

To speed up the Allied advance, the Fifth Air Force developed a number of technical and tactical innovations that extended <b>the</b> <b>range</b> of its aircraft, thus increasing the distance of each Allied advance, which was dependent on <b>the</b> <b>range</b> of Whitehead's aircraft.|$|E
5|$|At 13.5degrees of elevation, the 30.5cm gun {{could hit}} targets out to 16,200m (17,717yards) with armor-piercing shells. After the turrets were {{improved}} to allow elevation to 16degrees, <b>the</b> <b>range</b> correspondingly increased to 20,400m (22,310yd). At {{a range of}} 12,800m (14,000yd), the L3 armor-piercing shells fired by the gun were expected to penetrate 254mm (10in) of armor plate.

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>ranging</b> {{ability of}} Sasso chicken was {{estimated}} using <b>the</b> <b>ranging</b> score as an indicator. The chickens {{were allowed to}} range in three agro-ecosystems namely, rice-based, rambutan orchard and grassland. <b>The</b> <b>ranging</b> score was significantly higher in rambutan orchard with 52 m-hr followed by <b>the</b> <b>ranging</b> score in grassland with 48 m-hr. <b>The</b> <b>ranging</b> score was lowest in rice-based agroecosystem. The differences in <b>the</b> <b>ranging</b> score among agroecosystem can be attributed mainly {{to the presence of}} trees as shade, the soil type, and the predominant weed species in each agroecosystem. It was found that <b>the</b> higher <b>the</b> <b>ranging</b> score, <b>the</b> more the chicken used their daytime for <b>the</b> <b>ranging</b> acts i. e. “kahig at tuka”. As a result of ranging, there was a net decrease in weed biomass in all of the three agroecosystems. This was indicative of the chickens feeding on the weeds. The chickens showed preference for succulent and indeterminate grass species and rejection of paragrass and broad leaf weed species. ...|$|R
