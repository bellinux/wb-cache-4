50|$|Strandzha Nature Park, {{established}} in 1995 in the Bulgarian {{part of the}} massif, is the largest protected area in Bulgaria, embracing 1161 km2, or about 1% of <b>Bulgaria's</b> <b>total</b> territory.|$|R
50|$|The Araneae are {{represented}} by 321 species, or 35% of <b>Bulgaria's</b> <b>total.</b> The spiders prefer the north-eastern slopes and are most diverse in the coniferous forests. There are 36 species of Myriapoda, or 20% of <b>Bulgaria's</b> <b>total.</b> They are distributed mainly in the forests and are less frequent in the sub-Alpine and the Alpine zones. The Mollusca are 89 species and represent 27% of the nation's total (excluding the marine molluscs). Only 2% of Bulgaria's Ephemeroptera {{are found in the}} park — two species. The number of Orthopterida species is 63, or around 30% of the nation's total. The highest diversity is found in the valleys of the rivers Banderitsa and Damyanitsa. The Plecoptera {{are represented}} by 40 species, forming 40% of Bulgaria's diversity. There are 323 Heteroptera species, or 32% of the ones known in Bulgaria. They are most diverse in the northern parts of the park, in the Bayuvi Dupki - Dzhindzhiritsa Reserve. The Coleoptera are 639 species and this number it is estimated to raise to 1800-1900. The Neuropterida are 25 species, or 20% of <b>Bulgaria's</b> <b>total</b> diversity. There are 36 Hymenoptera species, found mainly at lower altitudes.

50|$|Since Bulgaria stopped high-seas {{fishing in}} 1995, {{the country has}} {{imported}} increasing amounts of fish. The fish farming industry (particularly sturgeon) has expanded in the early 2000s, and some environmental improvements in the Black Sea and the Danube River, the principal sources of fish, may increase the take in future years. However, the catch from those sources has decreased sharply in recent decades, yielding only a few species of fish for domestic markets in 2004. Between 1999 and 2001, <b>Bulgaria’s</b> <b>total</b> fish harvest, wild and cultivated, dropped from 18,600 tons to 8,100 tons, but in 2003 the harvest had recovered to 16,500 tons.|$|R

50|$|The {{first wave}} of {{immigrants}} from Bulgaria occurred during the Russo-Turkish War (1828-1829) when around 30,000 Bulgarian Turks arrived in Turkey. The second wave of about 750,000 immigrants left Bulgaria during the Russo-Turkish War of 1877-78, but approximately one-fourth of them died on the way. More than 200,000 of the rest remained inside the present borders of Turkey whilst the others were sent {{to other parts of}} the Ottoman Empire. The aftermath of the war led to major demographic restructuring of the ethnic and religious make-up of Bulgaria. As a result of these migrations, the percentage of Turks in Bulgaria was reduced from more than one-third of the population immediately after the Russo-Turkish War to 14.2% in 1900. Substantial numbers of Turks continued to emigrate to Turkey during, and following, the Balkan Wars and the First World War, in accordance with compulsory exchange of population agreements between Greece, Bulgaria, and Turkey. By 1934 the Turkish population fell to 9.7% of <b>Bulgaria’s</b> <b>total</b> population and continued to fall during the subsequent decades.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{looks at}} Bulgaria's {{industrial}} restructuring through the lenses of its evolving specialization in international division oflabor and integration into international markets {{with a special}} emphasis on EU markets. Its major findings can be summarized as follows: (1) Developments in Bulgaria's exports, its major drivers and factor content, during the"second transition"following the 1996 crisis have become reminiscent of developments in the early 1990 s in European transition economies that have stayed the reform course. (2) The evolution of <b>Bulgaria's</b> <b>total</b> exports in terms of factor intensities before the"second transformational"recession was a testimony to aborted economic reforms. It not only defied expectations derived {{from the experience of}} CEEC- 10 economies and its production factor endowments but also dramatically increased the cost of adjustment to market conditions for the economy as a whole. (3) Exports of unskilled labor-intensive products continue towering over other exports even during the current expansionary phase. The composition of top performers in EU markets indicates the shift toward natural resource and capital-intensive products. Bulgaria's export offer in EU markets has begun shifting toward more processed goods, mostly products of electro-engineering sectors. Bulgarian producers have made significant strides in information communication technology products and automotive parts. Trade in parts and engineering products has displayed strong growth. The returns usually associated with liberal reforms, that is, gains in competitiveness combined with a shift toward products in line with the country's endowments in production factors began to surface only recently. In contrast to the period preceding the second transformational recession in 1996 - 97, gains in competitiveness derive from corporate and industrial restructuring and not from subsidies.

2500|$|The Bulgarian royal house, of Catholic German extraction, was unsympathetic to the American {{inspired}} Protestants, {{and this}} mood became worse when Bulgaria sided with Germany in WWI and WWII. Matters became much worse when the Bulgarian Communist Party took power in 1944. Like the Royal Family, it too saw Protestantism {{closely linked to}} the West and hence more politically dangerous than traditional Orthodox Christianity. This prompted repressive legislation in the form of [...] "Regulations for the Organization and Administration of the Evangelical Churches in the People's Republic of Bulgaria" [...] and resulted in the harshest government repression, possibly the worst in the entire Eastern Bloc, intended to extinguish Protestantism altogether. Mass arrests of pastors (and often their families), torture, long prison sentences (including four life sentences) and even disappearance were common. Similar tactics were used on parishioners. In fifteen highly publicized mock show-trials between 8 February and 8 March 1949, all the accused pastors confessed to a range of charges against them, including treason, spying (for both the US and Yugoslavia), black marketing, and various immoral acts. State appointed pastors were foist on surviving congregations. As late as the 1980s, imprisonment and exile were still employed to destroy the remaining Protestant churches. The Congregationalist magazine [...] "Zornitsa" [...] was banned; Bibles became unobtainable. As a result, the number of Congregationalists is small and estimated by Paul Mojzes in 1982 to number about 5,000, in 20 churches. (<b>Total</b> Protestants in <b>Bulgaria</b> were estimated in 1965 to have been between 10,000 and 20,000.) More recent estimates indicate enrollment in Protestant ("Evangelical" [...] or [...] "Gospel") churches of between 100,000 and 200,000, presumably reflecting the success of more recent missionary efforts of evangelical groups.|$|R

The caliph sent representatives to Bulgaria to arrange an alliance but his emissaries were captured en route by the Byzantines near the Calabrian coast. The Byzantine Emperor Romanos I Lekapenos managed to avert a Bulgarian–Arab alliance by showering the Arabs with generous gifts. The war dragged on until Simeon I's death in May 927.

5000|$|The {{decisions}} of the Council of Preslav brought {{an end to the}} Byzantine hopes to exert influence over the newly Christianized country. In 894 the Byzantines moved the Bulgarian market from Constantinople to Thessaloniki, affecting the commercial interests of Bulgaria and the principle of Byzantine-Bulgarian trade, regulated under the Treaty of 716 and later agreements on the most favoured nation basis. The new Prince, Simeon I (r.893-927), who {{came to be known as}} Simeon the Great, declared war and defeated the Byzantine army in Thrace. The Byzantines turned for aid to the Magyars, who at the time inhabited the steppes to the north-east of Bulgaria. The Magyars scored two victories over the Bulgarians and pillaged Dobrudzha but SimeonI allied with the Pechenegs further east and in 895 the Bulgarian army inflicted a crushing defeat on the Magyars in the steppes along the Southern Bug River. At the same time, the Pechenegs advanced westwards and prevented the Magyars from returning to their homeland. The blow was so heavy that the Magyars were forced to migrate west, eventually settling in the Pannonian Basin, where they eventually established the Kingdom of Hungary. In 896 the Byzantines were routed in the decisive battle of Boulgarophygon and pleaded for peace that confirmed the Bulgarian domination on the Balkans, restored the status of Bulgaria as a most favoured nation, abolished the commercial restrictions and obliged the Byzantine Empire to pay annual tribute. The peace treaty remained in force until 912 although SimeonI did violate it following the sack of Thessaloniki in 904, extracting further territorial concessions in Macedonia.In 913 the Byzantine emperor Alexander provoked a bitter war after resolving to discontinue paying an annual tribute to Bulgaria.

Following the disaster at Achelous, the Byzantine diplomacy incited the Principality of Serbia to attack Bulgaria from the west, but this assault was easily contained. In 924, the Serbs ambushed and defeated a small Bulgarian army, provoking a major retaliatory campaign that ended with Bulgaria's annexation of Serbia at the end of that year. Further expansion in the Western Balkans was checked by King Tomislav of Croatia, who was a Byzantine ally and defeated a Bulgarian invasion in 926. SimeonI was aware that he needed naval support to conquer Constantinople and in 922 sent envoys to the Fatimid caliph Ubayd Allah al-Mahdi Billah in Mahdia to negotiate the assistance of the powerful Arab navy. The caliph sent representatives to Bulgaria to arrange an alliance but his emissaries were captured en route by the Byzantines near the Calabrian coast. The Byzantine Emperor Romanos I Lekapenos managed to avert a Bulgarian-Arab alliance by showering the Arabs with generous gifts. The war dragged on until Simeon I's death in May 927. By then Bulgaria controlled almost all Byzantine possessions in the Balkans, but without a fleet did not attempt to storm Constantinople.|$|R
