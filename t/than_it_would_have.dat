5|$|The Palmyrene monarchy was new; {{allegiance}} {{was based}} on loyalty to Odaenathus, making the transfer of power to a successor more difficult <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been in an established monarchy. Odaenathus tried to ensure the dynasty's future by crowning his eldest son co-king, but both were assassinated. Zenobia, left to secure the Palmyrene succession and retain the loyalty of its subjects, emphasized the continuity between her late husband and his successor (her son). Vaballathus (with Zenobia orchestrating the process) assumed his father's royal titles immediately, and his earliest known inscription records him as King of Kings.|$|E
5|$|In a {{retrospective}} interview, Rare designers Jens Restemeier and Nick Burton took interest in the-then upcoming Xbox Live Arcade {{and offered to}} develop a new game for the service after the release of Rare's Xbox 360 launch titles Perfect Dark Zero and Kameo. Rather than simply porting the original ZX Spectrum title to the Xbox 360, the development team decided to expand Jetpac and experiment with new elements. The team ensured to keep the original core mechanics of the Jetpac whilst designing new features for the game. Restemeier also stated that the development process for an Xbox Live Arcade game differed from a retail title, owing to processing power limitations that had to be constantly synced over Xbox Live. Burton asserted that one of the differences with development on the Xbox Live Service was the way optimisations shifted from graphics and game logic, stating that this was more difficult <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been for an Xbox 360 title such as Kameo.|$|E

25|$|Also, since Russia's {{economy was}} {{operating}} {{to such a}} large extent on barter and other non-monetary instruments of exchange, the financial collapse had far less of an impact on many producers <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>had</b> the economy been dependent on a banking system. Finally, the economy had been helped by an infusion of cash. As enterprises were able to pay off debts in back wages and taxes, in turn consumer demand {{for goods and services}} produced by the Russian industry began to rise.|$|R
5|$|Steiner {{differentiated}} offers, {{threats and}} throffers {{based on the}} preferability of compliance and noncompliance for the subject {{when compared to the}} normal course of events that would have come about were no intervention made. Steiner's account was criticised by philosopher Robert Stevens, who instead suggested that what was important in differentiating the kinds of intervention was whether performing or not performing the requested action was more or less preferable <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been were no intervention made. Throffers form part of the wider moral and political considerations of coercion, and form part of the question of the possibility of coercive offers. Contrary to received wisdom that only threats can be coercive, throffers lacking explicit threats have been cited as an example of coercive offers, while some writers argue that offers, threats and throffers may all be coercive if certain conditions are met. For others, by contrast, if a throffer is coercive, it is explicitly the threat aspect that makes it so, and not all throffers can be considered coercive.|$|E
5|$|The Florida State/Virginia Tech matchup was the 31st {{game between}} the two teams since they first met in 1955. At the time, Florida State held the {{advantage}} in wins, with a 19101 record against Virginia Tech. Heading into the 2002 Gator Bowl, however, spread bettors predicted a reversal of that trend as Virginia Tech was favored to win by two points on Dec. 10. This was reflective of an overall feeling of pessimism toward the Seminoles, who hadn't finished out of {{first place in the}} ACC since joining the league in 1992, and would not participate in the national championship game {{for the first time in}} four years. Because of this decline in stature, the fact that the game was a rematch of the 2000 national championship game received less coverage <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> otherwise.|$|E

25|$|In short, {{even though}} some {{individual}} slaveowners grew rich and some family fortunes were founded on the exploitation of slaves, that {{is very different from}} saying that the whole society, or even its non-slave population as a whole, was more economically advanced <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been in the absence of slavery.

25|$|A popular {{demonstration}} {{involves the}} bounce of multiple stacked balls. If {{a tennis ball}} is stacked {{on top of a}} basketball, {{and the two of them}} are dropped at the same time, the tennis ball will bounce much higher <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> if dropped on its own, even exceeding its original release height. The result is surprising as it apparently violates conservation of energy. However, upon closer inspection, the basketball does not bounce as high as it would have if the tennis ball had not been on top of it, and transferred some of its energy into the tennis ball, propelling it to a greater height.|$|E
