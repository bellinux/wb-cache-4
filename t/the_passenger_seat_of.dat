He then {{disguised}} himself as an Afrikaans-speaking Boer, taking a job as a wagon driver working for the German colonial forces in South West Africa. This intelligence work ended unsuccessfully when he was identified, but managed to escape. This escapade later led to claims that he became the model for Richard Hannay, a character in the novels of John Buchan; Ironside was always amused by these novels when reading about Mr Standfast in the implausibly romantic setting of <b>the</b> <b>passenger</b> <b>seat</b> <b>of</b> an open-cockpit biplane flying from Iraq to Persia.|$|E

25|$|Łukasz Urban {{was found}} dead in <b>the</b> <b>passenger</b> <b>seat</b> <b>of</b> the truck cab; he had been stabbed and shot once {{in the head with a}} small-caliber firearm. Investigators {{initially}} believed that Urban might still have been alive when the truck reached Breitscheidplatz and might have been stabbed because he tried to stop the attack. Early media reports indicated that he grabbed the steering wheel, forcing the truck to veer left and crash to a stop, and was then shot at the scene of the crash. If this had been true, this act might have had saved many lives. However, later media reports have indicated that the truck was brought to a stop by its automatic braking system and Urban was stabbed and shot hours before the attack. No weapons were found at the scene.|$|E

25|$|At 5:38 am, {{the flight}} passed the lowest height {{at which the}} flight crew could abort the landing. The {{aircraft}} landed at a normal 240km/h (149mph/130 knots). On touchdown, the flight crew saw the array of drying vehicles and attempted to turn the aircraft, but were unable to avoid the collision. The plane crashed into the Ural truck and then 200 m down the runway crashed into the KrAZ, igniting the 7 tons of fuel in each truck and the aircraft's fuel tank. The plane overturned and broke into pieces, some of which crashed into the UAZ-469. A catastrophic fracture of the fuel tanks caused burning fuel to leak into the fuselage, incinerating all but one passenger. The cockpit section detached and flew past the burning vehicles. It suffered no major damage, and all four crew members survived, suffering only minor injuries. They escaped from the cabin {{and ran to the}} crash site in an attempt to help the passengers. Four ground maintenance crew were killed instantly inside the vehicles. One survivor in <b>the</b> <b>passenger</b> <b>seat</b> <b>of</b> the UAZ caught on fire, which was extinguished.|$|E

2500|$|Since commencing {{his writing}} process in January 1973, Lucas had done [...] "various rewrites {{in the evenings}} after the day's work." [...] He would write four {{different}} screenplays for Star Wars, [...] "searching {{for just the right}} ingredients, characters and storyline. It's always been what you might call a good idea in search of a story." [...] By May 1974, he had expanded the film treatment into a rough draft screenplay, adding elements such as the Sith, the Death Star, and a general by the name of Annikin Starkiller. He changed Starkiller to an adolescent boy, and he shifted the general into a supporting role {{as a member of a}} family of dwarfs. Lucas envisioned the Corellian smuggler, Han Solo, as a large, green-skinned monster with gills. He based Chewbacca on his Alaskan Malamute dog, Indiana (whom he would later use as namesake for his character Indiana Jones), who often acted as the director's [...] "co-pilot" [...] by sitting in <b>the</b> <b>passenger</b> <b>seat</b> <b>of</b> his car.|$|E
