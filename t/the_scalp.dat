5|$|Humans, horses, and orangutans {{are among}} the few species that may grow their head hair very long. Humans are {{believed}} to have lost their fur 2.5–3 million years ago as hominids when transitioning from a forest habitat to the open savanna, as an effect of natural selection, since this development made it possible to run fast and hunt animals close to the equator without getting overheated. An exception was however head hair, which was kept to provide thermal insulation of <b>the</b> <b>scalp</b> from the sun, to protect against ultra-violet radiation exposure, and also to provide cooling (when sweat evaporates from soaked hair). The ability to grow straight hair, has been observed among Homo sapiens sub-groups in less sunny regions further away from the equator. Relative to kinky Afro-textured hair, straight hair allows more UV light to pass to <b>the</b> <b>scalp</b> (which is essential for the production of vitamin D, that is important for bone development).|$|E
5|$|Seborrheic-like {{psoriasis}} is {{a common}} form of psoriasis with clinical aspects of psoriasis and seborrheic dermatitis, {{and it may be}} difficult to distinguish from the latter. This form of psoriasis typically manifests as red plaques with greasy scales in areas of higher sebum production such as <b>the</b> <b>scalp,</b> forehead, skin folds next to the nose, skin surrounding the mouth, skin on the chest above the sternum, and in skin folds.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, the DNA {{differences}} between head lice and body lice provide corroborating evidence that humans used clothing between 80,000 and 170,000 years ago, before leaving Africa. Human head and body lice occupy distinct ecological zones: head lice live and feed on <b>the</b> <b>scalp,</b> while body lice live on clothing and {{feed on the}} body. Because body lice require clothing to survive, the divergence of head and body lice from their common ancestor provides {{an estimate of the}} date of introduction of clothing in human evolutionary history.|$|E

50|$|For special weapons, the ild short sword {{was tested}} against <b>the</b> <b>scalping</b> knife. <b>The</b> ild cut apart a pig carcass in 10 strikes, {{visually}} severing the ribcage and spinal cord. The ild's striking speed was clocked at 67 miles per hour. <b>The</b> <b>scalping</b> knife disemboweled another pig carcass with several strikes, inflicting wounds on the torso {{which would have}} inflicted a collapsed lung on a human target (but {{would not have been}} instant kills in and of themselves), stabbing into the neck and striking the jugular vein and/or carotid artery, and disembowelling the pig with a dragging vertical slice down <b>the</b> abdomen. <b>The</b> <b>scalping</b> knife's stabbing speed was clocked at roughly 30 miles per hour, with Geoff Desmoulins claiming that the hand speed of the Comanche expert was faster; however, the precise data was never divulged. Before the test, the Comanche expert also demonstrated a scalping on a synthetic skull that was dressed in synthetic skin and hair; however, only the visual was displayed, with no information on the potential deadliness of <b>the</b> <b>scalping.</b> <b>The</b> edge was given to the ild sword for its bigger size and cutting power.|$|R
5|$|Another source from 684 AD, {{during the}} Tang dynasty and {{recorded}} in Li Shizhen's Compendium of Materia Medica, states {{that when the}} leaves are taken internally, they make one incoherent and sleepy, while when used externally they can be effectively used to treat boils, abscesses and itches. Yet another recipe recorded by Li uses the leaves to treat baldness. This formula calls for young leaves of ailanthus, catalpa and peach tree to be crushed together and the resulting liquid applied to <b>the</b> <b>scalp</b> to stimulate hair growth.|$|E
5|$|Hair {{length is}} most often {{measured}} (in centimeters or inches) from the line of <b>the</b> <b>scalp</b> on the forehead up over the highest point of the skull to its termination, and sometimes from the crown, the latter resulting in 10 centimeter lower values in average. In cosmetology, hair lengths are usually categorized according to {{the part of the}} body where the bulk of the longest hair terminates: chin level, shoulder length, lower shoulderblade/mid-back level, waist length, hip-length, classic length (extends to almost buttock-length, i.e. upper thigh-length, where the legs meet the buttocks), thigh-length, knee-length and ankle/floor length hair.|$|E
5|$|Information {{about the}} {{structure}} and function {{of the human brain}} comes from a variety of experimental methods, including animals and humans. Information about brain trauma and stroke has provided information about the function of parts of the brain and the effects of brain damage. Neuroimaging is used to visualise the brain and record brain activity. Electrophysiology is used to measure, record and monitor the electrical activity of the cortex. Measurements may be of local field potentials of cortical areas, or of the activity of a single neuron. An electroencephalogram can record the electrical activity of the cortex using electrodes placed non-invasively on <b>the</b> <b>scalp.</b>|$|E

5000|$|To {{thwart the}} {{development}} of these Protestant settlements, the Maliseet, Mi'kmaq and Acadians conducted numerous raids on the settlements, such as the Raid on Dartmouth (1751). During these raids, the French military paid the Mi'kmaq for <b>the</b> British <b>scalps</b> they acquired. (In response, the British military paid Rangers for <b>the</b> <b>scalps</b> of Mi'kmaq and Maliseet.) ...|$|R
5|$|Native American {{raids on}} {{frontier}} settlements escalated {{in the spring}} and summer of 1764. The hardest hit colony that year was Virginia, where more raids occurred on July 26, when four Delaware Indian soldiers killed and scalped a school teacher and ten children in what is now Franklin County, Pennsylvania. Incidents such as these prompted the Pennsylvania Assembly, with the approval of Governor Penn, to reintroduce <b>the</b> <b>scalp</b> bounties offered during the French and Indian War, which paid money for every Native killed above the age of ten, including women.|$|E
5|$|Lice {{are divided}} into two groups: sucking lice, which obtain their {{nourishment}} from feeding on the sebaceous secretions and body fluids of their host; and chewing lice, which are scavengers, feeding on skin, fragments of feathers or hair, and debris found on the host's body. Most are found on only specific types of animals, and, in some cases, on only a particular part of the body; some animals are known to host up to fifteen different species, although one to three is typical for mammals, and two to six for birds. For example, in humans, different species of louse inhabit <b>the</b> <b>scalp</b> and pubic hair. Lice generally cannot survive for long if removed from their host. Some species of chewing lice house symbiotic bacteria in bacteriocytes in their bodies. These may assist in digestion because if the insect is deprived of them, it will die. If their host dies, lice can opportunistically use phoresis to hitch a ride on a fly and attempt {{to find a new}} host.|$|E
5|$|After {{a series}} of poor finals' results Kuznetsova ended her {{relationship}} with the Sanchez-Casal academy in 2009 and moved to Moscow {{on the advice of}} Roger Federer to start training with experienced Russian coach Olga Morozova. They ended their relationship after the BNP Paribas Open in March 2009, after which Kuznetsova was without a coach. As of May 2009 her coach was former Russian tennis player and Fed Cup coach Larisa Neiland. She was coached for a short period by Loïc Courteau after trying unsuccessfully to convince Mauresmo to coach her. Her next coach was for a short time the former Spanish tennis player Carlos Cuadrado, until he was replaced with her former coach Neiland. After the loss in the Italian Open, Kuznetsova has switched to Morozova, then to Amos Mansdorf and finally in May 2012 to Argentine Hernán Gumy, former coach of Marat Safin. She said in an interview, that she likes working with him and understands with him well. With his help she won three matches in straight sets at the 2012 French Open, including claiming <b>the</b> <b>scalp</b> of then-world No. 3 Agnieszka Radwańska.|$|E

5|$|Neurophysiologists {{study the}} chemical, pharmacological, and {{electrical}} {{properties of the}} brain: their primary tools are drugs and recording devices. Thousands of experimentally developed drugs affect the nervous system, some in highly specific ways. Recordings of brain activity can be made using electrodes, either glued to <b>the</b> <b>scalp</b> as in EEG studies, or implanted inside the brains of animals for extracellular recordings, which can detect action potentials generated by individual neurons. Because the brain does not contain pain receptors, it is possible using these techniques to record brain activity from animals that are awake and behaving without causing distress. The same techniques have occasionally been used to study brain activity in human patients suffering from intractable epilepsy, in cases {{where there was a}} medical necessity to implant electrodes to localize the brain area responsible for epileptic seizures. Functional imaging techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging are also used to study brain activity; these techniques have mainly been used with human subjects, because they require a conscious subject to remain motionless for long periods of time, but they have the great advantage of being noninvasive.|$|E
25|$|Finasteride is a {{medication}} of the 5α-reductase inhibitors (5-ARIs) class. By inhibiting type II 5-ARI, finasteride prevents {{the conversion of}} testosterone to dihydrotestosterone in various tissues including <b>the</b> <b>scalp.</b> Increased hair on <b>the</b> <b>scalp</b> can be seen within three months of starting finasteride treatment and longer-term studies have demonstrated increased hair on <b>the</b> <b>scalp</b> at 24 and 48 months with continued use.
