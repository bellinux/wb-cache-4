5|$|A {{declaration}} on <b>the</b> <b>takeover</b> of Prijedor by Serb forces {{was prepared}} by Serbian Democratic Party (SDS) politicians and was repeatedly read out on Radio Prijedor {{the day after}} <b>the</b> <b>takeover.</b> Four-hundred Bosnian Serb policemen were assigned to participate in <b>the</b> <b>takeover,</b> the objective of which was to seize {{the functions of the}} president of the municipality, the vice-president of the municipality, the director of the post office, the chief of the police, etc. On the night of the 29/30 April 1992, <b>the</b> <b>takeover</b> of power took place. Serb employees of the public security station and reserve police gathered in Cirkin Polje, part of the town of Prijedor. The people there were given the task of taking over power in the municipality and were broadly divided into five groups. Each group of about twenty had a leader and each was ordered to gain control of certain buildings. One group was responsible for the Assembly building, one for the main police building, one for the courts, one for the bank and the last for the post-office. The International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) concluded that <b>the</b> <b>takeover</b> by the Serb politicians was an illegal coup d'état, which was planned and coordinated long in advance with the ultimate aim of creating a pure Serbian municipality. These plans were never hidden and they were implemented in a coordinated action by the Serb police, army and politicians. One of the leading figures was Milomir Stakić, who came to play the dominant role in the political life of the municipality.|$|E
5|$|On April 19, 1969, {{during a}} parents' weekend, over 80 members of Cornell's Afro-American Society {{took over the}} student union building, Willard Straight Hall. <b>The</b> <b>takeover</b> was precipitated by {{increasing}} racial tension at {{the university and the}} students' frustration with the administration's lack of support for a black studies program. The specific catalysts for <b>the</b> <b>takeover</b> were a reprimand of three black students for an incident the previous December and a cross burning in front of the black women's cooperative and other cases of racism.|$|E
5|$|As a {{means of}} {{rallying}} supporters to get behind their cause, awareness campaigns against <b>the</b> <b>takeover</b> were launched. Red Issue issued pamphlets to fans and demonstrations in and around Old Trafford took place before the match against Charlton Athletic on 9 September. Football fans across the United Kingdom also lent support by lobbying their local MPs into passing a legislation, preventing further sport takeovers in the future.|$|E

40|$|We {{examine the}} {{relationships}} between the wealth changes associated with a takeover announcement to distinguish between three major competing motives—synergy, hubris, and agency. Empirical tests indicate that the synergy motive is the predominant explanation for <b>the</b> majority of <b>takeovers</b> in Australia; however, the evidence is consistent with the simultaneous presence of hubris in value-creating <b>takeovers.</b> <b>The</b> evidence also suggests agency, not hubris, is the primary motivation for <b>the</b> <b>takeovers</b> which result in value destruction. <br /...|$|R

5|$|In September 1966, a {{friendly}} {{takeover of the}} Bradford brewers J. Hey & Company Ltd added 73 public houses to their estate. Webster's had a market value of £3.3million, and J. Hey had a value of £1million. The combined group had assets of over £4.5million (£65million in 2010 prices). Webster's continued to bottle Guinness under their Hey & Humphries subsidiary label into the late 1980s. Throughout the 1960s and early 1970s, consolidation, a good product and successful marketing made the company successful, according to The Times, with the social club trade accounted for around half of turnover. By 1967 Watney Mann owned 18.4 per cent of the company, and Webster's had a market capitalisation of £6million (£85million in 2010 prices) and owned 320 public houses and 12 off licences. Watney Mann had gradually increased their share to 27.1 per cent by 1972 when it initiated a takeover {{of the rest of}} the company. Samuel Webster & Sons was offered £18million for the 73 per cent of the company that Watney did not already own. The Watney Mann offer valued the entire company at almost £250million in 2010 prices. <b>The</b> <b>takeover</b> was {{a friendly}} one, and dependent upon the agreement of the Webster family, who owned 20 per cent of the company. Watney Mann was motivated by an increase to their tied estate. Following <b>the</b> <b>takeover,</b> Webster's continued as a regional subsidiary of the Watney Mann brewing empire, responsible for Yorkshire, Humberside, north Derbyshire and north Nottinghamshire. <b>The</b> <b>takeover</b> saw heavy investment in the brewery and the Webster's brands enjoyed increased distribution nationally. That same year, Watney Mann itself was taken over by Grand Metropolitan.|$|E
5|$|On 3 August the Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt {{instructed}} Ofcom and the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) {{to examine}} Global Radio's purchase of GMG, which gave Global over 50% of the UK radio market {{because of concerns}} <b>the</b> <b>takeover</b> {{may not be in}} the public interest. On 11 October, the OFT agreed to fast-track the investigation. Hunt's successor Maria Miller said the deal would not be investigated for media plurality. The OFT concluded that the merger could lead to a rise in local advertising costs because of the decrease in competitors, and forwarded the matter to the Competition Commission, which oversees business mergers and takeovers. On the same day the Competition Commission announced it would publish its findings into <b>the</b> <b>takeover</b> by 27 March 2013.|$|E

40|$|SSRN Working PaperThere is {{a common}} {{perception}} that <b>the</b> Japanese <b>takeover</b> market excludes foreign companies. But this is not because Japanese takeover law is designed to protect target companies. Comparing Japanese <b>takeover</b> law with <b>the</b> UK <b>Takeover</b> Code and <b>the</b> European <b>Takeover</b> Directive, this thematic and content- based investigation reveals that Japan does not have overt anti-takeover legislation. There is no stake-building control to alert a target company; there is no provision against virtual bids; post-bid undertaking is not legally binding on the bidder; {{the equivalent of the}} mandatory bid under <b>the</b> UK <b>Takeover</b> Code and <b>the</b> EU Directive is set at a much higher level so making it less costly for a bidder to obtain corporate control; there is no price control to protect minority shareholders. Yet the traditional symbiotic relationship between management and shareholders through cross-shareholdings and shareholder perks remains a major obstacle to a successful unsolicited takeover. Measures have been introduced to increase the success of unsolicited takeover bids by reducing cross-shareholdings through tax incentive measures and increasing board independence through a soft-law based governance code. These are unlikely to {{have a major impact on}} removing the existing obstacles. Adopting <b>the</b> UK <b>Takeover</b> Code or <b>the</b> EU <b>Takeover</b> Directive would not cure the problem and would more likely entrench the existing situation...|$|R
