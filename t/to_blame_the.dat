5|$|On November 9, 2000, the WWF filed {{a lawsuit}} against the PTC in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, {{claiming}} that the PTC's statements were false and constituted defamation. The WWF also filed a copyright infringement lawsuit against the PTC for using clips from WWF programs in their promotional videos. The PTC filed for dismissal of the suit, but on May 24, 2001, U.S. district court Judge Denny Chin denied the PTC's motion on the basis that the WWF's lawsuit had merit. The PTC and the WWF settled out of court and, as part of the settlement agreement, the PTC paid the WWF $3.5 million USD and Bozell issued a public apology, stating that it was wrong <b>to</b> <b>blame</b> <b>the</b> World Wrestling Federation or any of its programs for the deaths of children and that the original statements had been based on what was later found to be false information designed by people close to the Lionel Tate case <b>to</b> <b>blame</b> <b>the</b> death of Tiffany Eunick on the WWF.|$|E

5|$|In August, several Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) generals {{proposed}} {{the imposition of}} martial law, ostensibly {{to break up the}} demonstrations, but in reality to prepare for a military coup. However, Nhu, already looking to arrest Buddhist leaders and crush the protest movement, used the opportunity to preempt the generals and embarrass them. He disguised Tung's Special Forces in army uniforms and used them to attack the Buddhists, thereby causing the general public and South Vietnam's U.S. allies <b>to</b> <b>blame</b> <b>the</b> army, diminishing the generals' reputations and ability to act as future national leaders.|$|E

5|$|The medallions were {{initially}} sold through mail order; purchasers {{were required to}} obtain the day's price by telephone before ordering. Later, the Mint sold them through telemarketing.

The series sold poorly, prompting critics <b>to</b> <b>blame</b> <b>the</b> involved process by which they were first marketed, {{and the fact that}} they were medallions rather than coins.|$|E
50|$|Various {{theories}} of victimology exist, each {{with the aim}} of explaining why certain people become victims of crimes, and why others do not.

Scar taunts him over {{his role in}} Mufasa's death and backs him {{to the edge of}} the rock, where he reveals to Simba that he murdered Mufasa. Enraged, Simba pins Scar to the ground and forces him to reveal the truth to the rest of the pride. Timon, Pumbaa, Rafiki, Zazu, and the lionesses fend off the hyenas while Scar, {{attempting}} to escape, is cornered by Simba at the top of Pride Rock. Scar begs for mercy and attempts <b>to</b> <b>blame</b> <b>the</b> hyenas for his actions; Simba spares his life but orders him to leave the Pride Lands forever. Scar attacks his nephew, but Simba manages to toss him from the top of the rock. Scar survives the fall but is killed by the hyenas, who overheard him betray them to Simba.

5|$|As {{the demonstrations}} continued, Ambassador Nolting managed to extract {{theoretical}} concessions from Diệm on 18 May. Diệm agreed a modest compensation package of USD $7000 {{for the families}} of the victims as a conciliatory gesture. Diệm also agreed to dismiss those responsible for the shootings. However, the publicly stated reason for this action was that the officials had failed to maintain order, rather than that they had been responsible for the deaths of the protesters. Despite these concessions, Diệm maintained that his government was not responsible for the deaths, resolutely continuing <b>to</b> <b>blame</b> <b>the</b> Việt Cộng. It was enough to satisfy Nolting, who immediately departed for his vacation. His absence allowed the remaining American diplomatic staff led by William Trueheart, Nolting's deputy, to end Nolting's policy of appeasing Diệm.|$|E
5|$|The gender-based {{criticism}} has also affected younger male {{fans of the}} show, such as with Michael Morones above. Another story that gained national attention was that of Grayson Bruce, a nine-year-old fan who was told to stop bringing a Rainbow Dash backpack to school to prevent bullying that he was receiving. An online campaign to show support for Grayson gained over 32,000 supporters on its Facebook page, and the brony fanbase, the show's creators and voice actors, and various news commentators like Glenn Beck, Ronan Farrow and Eugene Volokh have stood up for the boy's actions. The school later revised its decision after speaking to the family and clarifying it was not trying <b>to</b> <b>blame</b> <b>the</b> student for the incident.|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} the defensive attribution hypothesis {{in the context}} of a product-harm crisis. A high severity product-harm crisis results in more <b>blame</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> company and less <b>blame</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> consumer than does a low severity crisis, although this attributional pattern is more evident when the crisis is associated with an unfamiliar brand. A model then reveals personal vulnerability to be an antecedent of perceived severity, which in turn is an antecedent of <b>blame</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> company. The model further reveals <b>blame</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> company predicts negative attitudes to brand, decreased purchase intentions, and negative product recommendations. ...|$|R

5|$|This plan {{required}} tacit Soviet support, and the non-aggression pact (the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact) between Germany and the Soviet Union, led by Joseph Stalin, {{included a}} secret agreement to partition Poland {{between the two}} countries. Contrary to Ribbentrop's prediction that Britain would sever Anglo-Polish ties, Britain and Poland signed the Anglo-Polish alliance on 25 August 1939. This, along with news from Italy that Mussolini would not honour the Pact of Steel, prompted Hitler to postpone the attack on Poland from 25 August to 1 September. Hitler unsuccessfully tried to manoeuvre the British into neutrality by offering them a non-aggression guarantee on 25 August; he then instructed Ribbentrop to present a last-minute peace plan with an impossibly short time limit in an effort <b>to</b> <b>blame</b> <b>the</b> imminent war on British and Polish inaction.|$|E
5|$|During {{the later}} 19th century, the major {{shipping}} lines financed Swedish emigrant agents {{and paid for}} the production of large quantities of emigration propaganda. Much of this promotional material, such as leaflets, was produced by immigration promoters in the U.S. Propaganda and advertising by shipping line agents was often blamed for emigration by the conservative Swedish ruling class, which grew increasingly alarmed at seeing the agricultural labor force leave the country. It was a Swedish 19th-century cliché <b>to</b> <b>blame</b> <b>the</b> falling ticket prices and the pro-emigration propaganda of the transport system for the craze of emigration, but modern historians have varying views about the real importance of such factors. Brattne and Åkerman have examined the advertising campaigns and the ticket prices as a possible third force between push and pull. They conclude that neither advertisements nor pricing had any decisive influence on Swedish emigration. While the companies remain unwilling, , to open their archives to researchers, the limited sources available suggest that ticket prices did drop in the 1880s, but remained on average artificially high because of cartels and price-fixing. On the other hand, H. A. Barton states that the cost of crossing the Atlantic dropped drastically between 1865 and 1890, encouraging poorer Swedes to emigrate. The research of Brattne and Åkerman has shown that the leaflets sent out by the shipping line agents to prospective emigrants would not so much celebrate conditions in the New World, as simply emphasize the comforts and advantages of the particular company. Descriptions of life in America were unvarnished, and the general advice to emigrants brief and factual. Newspaper advertising, while very common, tended to be repetitive and stereotyped in content.|$|E
