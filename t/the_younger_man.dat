5|$|Earlier {{on the day}} of the shooting, Loughner {{reportedly}} had an altercation {{with his}} father regarding a black bag <b>the</b> <b>younger</b> <b>man</b> took from a car trunk. A bag matching the description was later found in a nearby desert area containing 9mm ammunition, and it is believed to belong to Loughner. Later that morning, at approximately 7:30a.m., Loughner was stopped by an Arizona Game and Fish Department officer after running a red light, but was released with a reminder when it was determined that he did not have any outstanding warrants.|$|E
5|$|Running {{throughout}} all the many paths his life could take or has taken, the adult Nemo recurringly awakens in a surrealistic world dominated by argyle patterns. This setting seems artificial, {{like a movie}} set, and often appears to bleed over into his other lives. Following clues that he finds scattered throughout this city, he ultimately arrives at a crumbling, abandoned wooden-framed house. He stumbles upon a DVD player {{hooked up to a}} television screen. In the strangely interactive video, the 118-year-old Nemo converses with the 34-year-old one. He explains that <b>the</b> <b>younger</b> <b>man</b> does not exist. This is a universe where Nemo Nobody was never born, and his consciousness is stuck in some sort of limbo. He states that he is experiencing the story from the end and that he must stay alive until 5:50 AM on 12 February 2092.|$|E
5|$|The third, and final, London season {{under the}} triumvirate was in 1946–47. Olivier played King Lear, and Richardson took {{the title role}} in Cyrano de Bergerac. Olivier would have {{preferred}} the roles to be reversed, but Richardson {{did not wish to}} attempt Lear. Olivier's Lear received good but not outstanding reviews. In his scenes of decline and madness {{towards the end of the}} play some critics found him less moving than his finest predecessors in the role. The influential critic James Agate suggested that Olivier used his dazzling stage technique to disguise a lack of feeling, a charge that the actor strongly rejected, but which was often made throughout his later career. During the run of Cyrano, Richardson was knighted, to Olivier's undisguised envy. <b>The</b> <b>younger</b> <b>man</b> received the accolade six months later, by which time the days of the triumvirate were numbered. The high profile of the two star actors did not endear them to the new chairman of the Old Vic governors, Lord Esher. He had ambitions to be the first head of the National Theatre and had no intention of letting actors run it. He was encouraged by Guthrie, who, having instigated the appointment of Richardson and Olivier, had come to resent their knighthoods and international fame.|$|E
50|$|Death {{comes across}} a giant and is badly beaten. <b>The</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> comes across <b>the</b> beaten-down Death and helps him up.

50|$|The prototypical {{story of}} the Holy Fool is that of <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> who asks to {{accompany}} the prophet Elijah. The prophet agrees {{on the condition that}} <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> not question his behaviour. Along their journey the prophet does, what to <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> appear as, a number of outrageous and inexplicable things. Finally, unable to stay quiet <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> protests. Elijah clearly explains to <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> everything that he did, so that it makes perfect sense, {{and at the same time}} he parts company with him.|$|R
50|$|A game {{is usually}} {{conducted}} as follows. A <b>young</b> <b>man</b> on horseback waits at a starting line. A young woman, also mounted, starts her horse galloping from a given distance behind <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man.</b> When <b>the</b> <b>young</b> woman passes <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man,</b> he may start his horse galloping. The two race towards a finish line some distance ahead. If <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> {{is able to}} catch up to <b>the</b> <b>young</b> woman before they reach the finish line, he may reach out to her and steal a kiss, which constitutes victory. However, if <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> has not caught up to <b>the</b> <b>young</b> woman by <b>the</b> time they reach the finish line, <b>the</b> <b>young</b> woman turns around and chases <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> back to <b>the</b> starting line. If she is in range of <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man,</b> she may use her whip to beat him, which signifies a victory for her.|$|R

25|$|In August 1814, the planter Edward Coles and Jefferson corresponded about Coles' {{ideas on}} emancipation. Jefferson urged Coles not to free his slaves, but <b>the</b> <b>younger</b> <b>man</b> took all his slaves to the Illinois and freed them, {{providing}} them with land for farms.|$|E
25|$|Several years later, {{the rabbi}} stepped aside {{as a leader}} of Amishav in favour of Michael Freund. <b>The</b> <b>younger</b> <b>man</b> was a Jerusalem Post {{columnist}} and former deputy director of communications and policy planning in the Prime Minister's office. The two men quarreled.|$|E
50|$|One morning <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> {{discovered}} {{that his wife}} and child were missing. For four days <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> searched for his family and on the fourth day he came to a high ridge and a herd of buffalo were grazing below. As <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> approached <b>the</b> heard a <b>young</b> buffalo calf came running out to meet him; this buffalo was his son. <b>The</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> told his son that he wished to follow them. However his son informed him that the trip was too long and that he would die. Still <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> continued despite his son's warning. A few days later the buffalo decided to put <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> through a test, by seeing if he could identify his son in a group of other buffalo calf. Before <b>the</b> test <b>the</b> <b>young</b> man's son informed him that he would set up various signals so his father could identify him. When the test came the father and son had no problem communicating with each other so <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> passed <b>the</b> test.|$|R
50|$|Throughout <b>the</b> story, <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> in <b>the</b> {{beginning}} has {{sexual encounters}} with three {{beautiful woman in}} the night.

The next day, <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> bravely goes to see Ni Han, who is surrounded by the three women and chains hanging on a column. Ni Han greets him and casually comments that he reminds him of his nephew, much to <b>the</b> <b>young</b> man's horror. Before he leaves, <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> encounters Sangmong, who gives him a book, and <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> thanks him before riding his horse and departing the village.|$|R

The poodle’s lady owner (Florence Gillet) persuades <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> to enter his dog into the local dog show. When his entry is refused, <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> sneaks in anyway, but is quickly thrown out, {{followed}} by all the dogs in <b>the</b> show. <b>The</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> spots <b>the</b> poodle’s owner outside looking for her dog and offers his dog in its place.

This scene is witnessed by her jealous boyfriend, who happens to bump into the bandit and together the two plot their revenge on <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man.</b>|$|R
25|$|Campbell's {{last years}} were marred by tragedy and disappointment. During World War I, the industrialist's only son, Louis J. Campbell, {{contracted}} a progressive disease while {{fighting in the}} trenches of France. The degenerative condition, {{which resulted in the}} amputation of Louis Campbell's right leg, forced <b>the</b> <b>younger</b> <b>man</b> to take frequent breaks from his position as treasurer of the Youngstown Sheet and Tube Company. Ultimately, Louis Campbell survived his father by less than two years.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the next}} few years Taylor played in {{numerous}} bands, holiday camps, radio dates, and cruise ships (one cruise led to playing with the Count Basie orchestra). Performing dates in and around London soon brought him into contact with jazz guitarist Ike Isaacs who took <b>the</b> <b>younger</b> <b>man</b> under his wing. In addition to performing with Taylor as a duet, Isaacs helped develop his sense of jazz harmony and started him on the road to developing his fingerstyle technique.|$|E
25|$|But the Monticello Jefferson-Hemings Report, {{examining}} Randolph Jefferson as a candidate, {{found that}} he made only four recorded visits to Monticello (in September 1802, September 1805, May 1808, and sometime in 1814), and none coincided with possible dates of Sally Hemings' conceptions. In August 1807, a probable conception time for Eston Hemings, Thomas Jefferson wrote to his brother about visiting, {{but there is no}} evidence that <b>the</b> <b>younger</b> <b>man</b> arrived. Similarly, no documentation of a Randolph visit appears at the probable conception time for Madison Hemings.|$|E

60|$|I noticed, as {{the song}} progressed, that a good many other people seemed to have their eye fixed on <b>the</b> two <b>young</b> <b>men,</b> as well as myself. These other people also tittered when <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>men</b> tittered, and roared when <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>men</b> roared; and, as <b>the</b> two <b>young</b> <b>men</b> tittered and roared and {{exploded}} with laughter pretty continuously all through the song, it went exceedingly well.|$|R
50|$|A police {{inspector}} helps a <b>young</b> <b>man</b> {{who is a}} classmate of his sister. <b>The</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> is a kind person and he moves like one in the family.

But the dance master is an opportunist and he seduces the girl. She becomes pregnant. The inspector and his wife wants to marry her to <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> without knowing her pregnancy. However, <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> is in love with a village lass. The dance master sees the village beauty and sets his roving eyes on her. He rejects the responsibility for the pregnancy of <b>the</b> <b>young</b> woman. How all these problems are settled forms the rest of the story.|$|R
25|$|In 1859 Gould began {{speculative}} investing {{by buying}} stock in small railways. Gould's father-in-law Daniel S. Miller {{was credited with}} introducing <b>the</b> <b>younger</b> <b>man</b> to the railroad industry, when he suggested that Gould help him save his investment in the Rutland and Washington Railroad in the Panic of 1857. Gould purchased stock for 10 cents on the dollar, which left him {{in control of the}} company. Through the Civil War era, he did more speculation on railroad stocks in New York City. In 1863 he was appointed manager of the Rensselaer and Saratoga Railroad.|$|E
25|$|Fearing for Douglas' life, Connolly asked HBC Governor George Simpson to {{transfer}} <b>the</b> <b>younger</b> <b>man</b> elsewhere.

His wife joined him after the death of their first child in 1830. While they lived in Fort Vancouver, she gave birth to ten more children (five died in infancy). Their son James W. Douglas grew up to become a politician and Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA), 1875-1888.|$|E

He hired a young English immigrant named Richard Upjohn to design {{a house on the}} plot, insisting it be more modest and restrained than its neighbors, even though he was the third-wealthiest man in the city after his late father and brother-in-law.

He also instructed his father to duck down when his grandfather turned around for it was here that he would be trying to kill him. The race began and <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> ran along <b>the</b> inside of the track like his son instructed. The grandfather then turned around and charged at <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man.</b> <b>The</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> ducked when <b>the</b> buffalo charged, and the buffalo ran by <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> off a cliff to his death.|$|R

25|$|The concert made {{international}} headlines, led {{to one of}} {{only five}} Time magazine cover stories dedicated to a jazz musician, and resulted in an album produced by George Avakian that would become the best-selling LP of Ellington's career. Much of the music on the vinyl LP was, in effect, simulated, with only about 40% actually from the concert itself. According to Avakian, Ellington was dissatisfied with aspects of the performance and felt the musicians had been under rehearsed. The band assembled {{the next day to}} re-record several of the numbers with the addition of artificial crowd noise, none of which was disclosed to purchasers of the album. Not until 1999 was the concert recording properly released for the first time. The revived attention brought about by the Newport appearance should not have surprised anyone, Johnny Hodges had returned the previous year, and Ellington's collaboration with Strayhorn had been renewed around the same time, under terms more amenable to <b>the</b> <b>younger</b> <b>man.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{the spring}} of 1987, Berdella became {{friendly}} with a 20-year-old named Larry Wayne Pearson. This casual friendship began when Pearson entered his shop and explained to Berdella that, as a child, he had held an interest in both witchcraft and wizadry. Shortly thereafter, Pearson temporarily lodged with Berdella, and willingly performed chores around his home {{as a means of}} paying rent. According to Berdella, he did not initially intend to capture this individual, but formed the plan to do so on June 23 when, having bailed Pearson out of jail, <b>the</b> <b>younger</b> <b>man</b> began jokingly referring to his practice of robbing gay men in Wichita. That evening, Berdella ensured Pearson became intoxicated before injecting him with chlorpromazine and moving him down to his basement, where he bound Pearson's hands above his head, then linked the rope he had used for this purpose to a brick column, before injecting Pearson's larynx with drain cleaner. He then brought an electrical transformer to the basement.|$|E
25|$|The next day, {{the hunters}} separate, {{with the younger}} one manning a spot high on a cliff near a {{waterfall}}. He descends from his post to wash {{up in a small}} waterfall in the hills. His gun out of reach, the hunter suddenly finds himself cornered by the grizzly, who rears and roars {{at the sight of the}} man. Faced with certain death, the hunter cowers in fear. The grizzly, seemingly affected by the hunter's distress, turns and leaves. The young hunter, impressed by the bear's act of mercy, attempts to scare him off more quickly by shooting his gun into the air. When the hunter's companion joins him, having heard the gunshots, <b>the</b> <b>younger</b> <b>man</b> tells him that the bear is dead. However, spying the bear ascending a scree, the older man raises his rifle to shoot, only to be stopped by the other man. The three hunters return to their camp empty-handed, where they free the young cub and then ride off into the wilderness.|$|E

25|$|Leonardo {{was more}} than thirty years older than Raphael, but Michelangelo, who was in Rome for this period, was just eight years his senior. Michelangelo already disliked Leonardo, and in Rome came to dislike Raphael even more, {{attributing}} conspiracies against him to <b>the</b> <b>younger</b> <b>man.</b> Raphael would have been aware of his works in Florence, but in his most original work of these years, he strikes out in a different direction. His Deposition of Christ draws on classical sarcophagi to spread the figures across the front of the picture space in a complex and not wholly successful arrangement. Wöllflin detects the influence of the Madonna in Michelangelo's Doni Tondo in the kneeling figure on the right, {{but the rest of the}} composition is far removed from his style, or that of Leonardo. Though highly regarded at the time, and much later forcibly removed from Perugia by the Borghese, it stands rather alone in Raphael's work. His classicism would later take a less literal direction.|$|E
25|$|With about {{a minute}} left in the round, Chávez hit Taylor {{squarely}} with several hard punches and stayed on the attack, continuing to hit Taylor with well-placed shots. Finally, with about 25 seconds to go, Chávez landed a hard right hand that caused Taylor to stagger forward towards a corner, forcing Chávez back ahead of him. Suddenly Chávez stepped around Taylor, positioning him so that Taylor was trapped in the corner, with no way to escape from Chávez' desperate final flurry. Chávez then nailed Taylor with a tremendous right hand that dropped <b>the</b> <b>younger</b> <b>man.</b> By using the ring ropes to pull himself up, Taylor managed to return to his feet and was given the mandatory 8-count. Referee Richard Steele asked Taylor twice if he was able to continue fighting, but Taylor failed to answer.
