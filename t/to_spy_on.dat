Secondly, it's bad <b>to</b> be <b>spying</b> <b>on</b> Americans without court oversight.

5|$|Ironically, the treason and {{defection}} of Dumouriez {{gave the}} Jacobins full scope {{to take control}} of the armies. Before Neerwinden, the army obeyed its commanders. Afterward, the representatives on mission were given extraordinary powers over army commanders. The generals might pay with their lives for defeat, but the real authority lay with the political operatives. Meanwhile, the new War Minister sent his agents <b>to</b> <b>spy</b> <b>on</b> the generals. These men were quick to report any complaint against officers, which could result in disgrace or execution. Elements of this system stayed in force even after Maximilien Robespierre was overthrown and guillotined.|$|E

5|$|Once {{considered}} {{for the role of}} James Bond in the cinematic adaptations of Ian Fleming's novels, Lucan was known for his expensive tastes; he raced power boats and drove an Aston Martin. In 1963 he married Veronica Duncan, by whom he had three children. When the marriage collapsed late in 1972, he moved out of the family home at 46Lower Belgrave Street, in London's Belgravia, to a property nearby. A bitter custody battle ensued, which Lucan lost. He began <b>to</b> <b>spy</b> <b>on</b> his wife and record their telephone conversations, apparently obsessed with regaining custody of the children. This fixation, combined with his gambling losses, had a dramatic effect on his life and personal finances.|$|E

Expecting the Dutch colonial government to return, Djajakusuma and Ismail helped establish the Independent Artists (Seniman Merdeka) {{as a form of}} resistance. The group travelled throughout the city, spreading news of Indonesia's proclaimed independence while performing from an open-air truck. After the arrival of the Netherlands Indies Civil Administration, the group sometimes attempted <b>to</b> <b>spy</b> <b>on</b> the Europeans or hide information which would be considered useful to the returning Dutch forces. Owing to this dangerous work, Djajakusuma began carrying a pistol, and went to Banten to ask a kyai to make him impervious to bullets.|$|E
5|$|Russell Eugene Weston, Jr. (born December 28, 1956), {{also known}} as Rusty, grew up in Valmeyer, Illinois. Weston {{attended}} Valmeyer High School, the only high school in a town of 900 people. Shortly after graduating high school in 1974, Weston moved to Rimini, Montana, rarely returning to Valmeyer. The only attempt his high school classmates made at inviting him to a class reunion was returned with obscenities written across it. Many of Weston's Montana neighbors had disliked him, and often ignored him. They considered him to be unusual, and sometimes eccentric. Weston had once thought that his neighbor was using his television satellite dish <b>to</b> <b>spy</b> <b>on</b> his actions and believed Navy SEALs were hiding in his cornfield.|$|E

5|$|U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) {{documents}} declassified in 2006 {{show that}} the capture of Eichmann caused alarm at the CIA and West German Bundesnachrichtendienst (BND). Both organizations had known {{for at least two}} years that Eichmann was hiding in Argentina, but did not act, because it did not serve their interests in the Cold War to do so. Both were concerned about what Eichmann might say in his testimony about West German national security advisor Hans Globke, who had coauthored several antisemitic Nazi laws (including the Nuremberg Laws). The documents also revealed that both agencies had used some of Eichmann's former Nazi colleagues <b>to</b> <b>spy</b> <b>on</b> European communist countries.|$|E
5|$|After {{the ruler}} of the other {{dimensional}} realm Outworld, Shao Kahn, conquered the realm of Edenia and merged it with his own, he decided he would keep the former king's daughter Kitana alive and raise her as his own. Though she grew up knowing nothing of her origin, the emperor nonetheless feared that one day Kitana would discover her true parentage and turn against him, and so he ordered Shang Tsung to bring to life a more vicious and loyal version of Kitana that could take her place if necessary. This was done by fusing her essence with a Tarkatan warrior from Baraka's race. The process was not a complete success, however, as the hybrid clone was disfigured with the hideous mouth of the Tarkata. Instead of replacing Kitana, as originally planned, Mileena would be used <b>to</b> <b>spy</b> <b>on</b> her and to ensure her allegiance to him, and so Shao Kahn introduced Mileena to Kitana as her supposedly lost twin sister. The two thus grew up together as his daughters and elite personal assassins, although Mileena grew to harbor a great bitterness and jealousy towards Kitana, whom Kahn favored over her.|$|E
5|$|Ajay {{encounters}} Pagan, who chastises him for fleeing at {{the start}} of the game, claiming that he only ever intended to help Ajay.

If Ajay instead chooses to listen, Pagan reveals that Ajay's father sent Ishwari <b>to</b> <b>spy</b> <b>on</b> Pagan in the early days of the Golden Path, but they fell in love and had a daughter together, Lakshmana, which would make her Ajay's half-sister. Ajay's father, Mohan Ghale, killed Lakshmana for Ishwari's betrayal, and Ishwari killed him in turn before leaving the country with the infant Ajay. Pagan shows Ajay to a shrine containing Lakshmana's ashes, and Ajay places Ishwari's ashes inside. Pagan then boards a helicopter and departs peacefully, leaving the country in Ajay's hands.|$|E

5|$|Candaules {{shows the}} moment at which Gyges, hiding behind the door, first catches sight of Nyssia's naked body. Candaules lies naked in bed, while Nyssia undresses as she prepares to join him, and Gyges tiptoes around the door {{to catch a glimpse}} of her. Nyssia holds a piece of fabric, which forms a {{vertical}} line cutting off the body of Candaules at the top of his legs, invoking a theme of emasculation at the hands of a powerful woman. By positioning the figures in such a way that none are looking out of the picture, and the viewer is directly behind Nyssia, Etty intended that the viewer feel the same sense of voyeurism and intrusion that Gyges would have felt, forced <b>to</b> <b>spy</b> <b>on</b> his master's naked wife against his will and without her knowledge. The cluttered arrangement of drapery and architectural features intentionally exaggerates the claustrophobic and implicitly violent nature of the scene.|$|E
5|$|In May 1914, {{two months}} before war broke out, Lody was {{approached}} by German naval intelligence officials. He agreed to their proposal to employ him as a peacetime spy in southern France, but {{the outbreak of the}} First World War on 28 July 1914 resulted in a change of plans. In late August, he was sent to the United Kingdom with orders <b>to</b> <b>spy</b> <b>on</b> the Royal Navy. He posed as an American — he could speak English fluently, with an American accent — using a genuine U.S. passport purloined from an American citizen in Germany. Over the course of a month, Lody travelled around Edinburgh and the Firth of Forth observing naval movements and coastal defences. By the end of September 1914, he was becoming increasingly worried for his safety as a rising spy panic in Britain led to foreigners coming under suspicion. He travelled to Ireland, where he intended to keep a low profile until he could make his escape from the UK.|$|E
