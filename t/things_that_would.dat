5|$|Scholars have {{suggested}} that oral traditions in general and poetry in particular was well placed to {{play a part in}} cultural resistance to apartheid. Music and poetry were more accessible to a large number of South Africans than written material (partly due to the restrictions placed by apartheid). Music, poetry, and storytelling also formed part of the everyday life of a number of South Africans, and protest songs emerged from these traditions. In addition, poetry was traditionally seen by some South Africans as a legitimate means of criticising authority, with poetic licence allowing artists to say <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> otherwise not be acceptable.|$|E

25|$|Communication is a {{key element}} of {{negotiation}}. Effective negotiation requires that participants effectively convey and interpret information. Participants in a negotiation communicate information not only verbally but non-verbally through body language and gestures. By understanding how nonverbal communication works, a negotiator is better equipped to interpret the information other participants are leaking non-verbally while keeping secret those <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> inhibit his/her ability to negotiate.|$|E
25|$|During most dreams, {{the person}} dreaming is {{not aware that}} they are dreaming, no matter how absurd or {{eccentric}} the dream is. The reason for this {{may be that the}} prefrontal cortex, the region of the brain responsible for logic and planning, exhibits decreased activity during dreams. This allows the dreamer to more actively interact with the dream without thinking about what might happen, since <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> normally stand out in reality blend in with the dream scenery.|$|E
25|$|Kono Manga ga Sugoi! {{recommended}} Steel Ball Run as a {{good place}} to start for people who have not read previous parts, due to how it serves as a reboot of the JoJo's Bizarre Adventure series, and appreciated how its move from Weekly Shōnen Jump to the monthly seinen magazine Ultra Jump enabled Araki to write longer stories and depict <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> have been difficult to do in a magazine aimed at children. Erkael of Manga-News called the manga one of the best in the series, and said that it does not disappoint the reader at any point.|$|E

25|$|The show parodies {{many things}} about popular culture, {{primarily}} being a spoof of {{shows such as}} Jackass; whereas they perform stunts designed to injure and/or humiliate an individual, the Fist team do <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> obviously kill them. Such as jumping off cliffs, being hit by trucks, getting shot in the head, etc. These dangerous stunts and outlandish actions are usually achieved {{with the use of}} computer generated imagery. Indeed, one of the most innovative and noteworthy features of Double the Fist is its extensive and imaginative use of CGI, especially considering that the programme was produced for a very low budget, even by Australian standards ($250,000 for all 8 episodes).|$|E

500|$|On {{his first}} day for filming series three, Penry-Jones participated in a fight scene {{in the middle of}} the first episode. He felt a little wary {{replacing}} Matthew Macfadyen. After two months of filming, Penry-Jones began to feel more at ease with the role. He felt especially so after he started working for the fourth series. He returned to the fourth series because he thought his character took off by the end of the last series, and wanted to see which direction he would go to next. The crew wanted Adam to go from a [...] "happy-go-lucky" [...] figure to wanting him to deal with <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> make it hard for Adam to be jokey towards the end of the fourth series; this involved Fiona's death.|$|E

500|$|In 2004, {{the company}} {{committed}} itself to a redesign of its entire packaging line that tied the packaging into its irreverent advertising campaign created by Crispin, Porter + Bogusky. Each product's packaging included a tongue-in-cheek commentary about the product itself. Alex Bogusky, partner and executive creative director of CP+B, stated that BK decided [...] "to create {{a dialogue with the}} consumer" [...] by utilizing the large areas of white space found on its packaging at the time. All of its sandwich wrappers, cartons, tray liners, bags, breakfast platters, chili cups, condiments, and regional product packaging received what was described as [...] "quirky ad copy" [...] specifically targeting the 18–34-year-old male demographic segment. Besides the humorous commentary, the company also created sniglet-type names for <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> appear in its products, such as a [...] "ringer" [...] – a single onion ring that had been accidentally included in an order of fries.|$|E
500|$|... "Tim McGraw" [...] is {{the debut}} single and first {{published}} song recorded by American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift. The song {{was written by}} Swift and Liz Rose, and produced by Nathan Chapman. It was released on June 19, 2006 by Big Machine Records as Swift's debut single and the lead single from Swift's eponymous debut album. Swift wrote [...] "Tim McGraw" [...] during her freshman year of high school, knowing {{that she and her}} senior boyfriend would break {{up at the end of}} the year when he left for college. The song was written about all the different <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> remind the subject of Swift and their time spent together, once he departed. [...] "Tim McGraw" [...] is a musical interconnection of traditional and modern country music. Lyrically, the track lists items in order to associate a past relationship, one of them being country artist Tim McGraw's music.|$|E
500|$|During production, {{the film}} {{underwent}} two name changes. The project was initially titled Seven, which became Ek Bataa Saat and finally 7 Khoon Maaf. In the film, Chopra's character ages from 20 to 65, and prosthetic makeup {{was used for}} her looks at different ages. Bhardwaj hired Hollywood special makeup effects artist Greg Cannom, who did the makeup for 2008's The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, to create seven looks for the character. Chopra found the most challenging period {{was that of the}} 65-year-old woman. The actress said, [...] "prosthetics had to play a heavy part but I’m happy that I pushed myself as the result is really fab. I had to be very careful of not doing <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> damage the make-up". To make Chopra look authentic, the makeup team used Chopra's mother's and grandmother’s photos to create her look. She had to gain five kg weight to fit her aging character.|$|E

500|$|Episode writer Lender {{proposed}} to have Count Orlok of the 1922 silent film Nosferatu {{appear as a}} gag {{at the end of}} the episode. Series creator Stephen Hillenburg accepted Lender's proposal and allowed him to do it. Lender said, [...] "Steve gave you the opportunities to do <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> really be memorable, if you could sell him on it." [...] Lender then searched for books with scannable pictures of Count Orlok. However, the image of Count Orlok used in the episode was taken from the Internet. He said, [...] "I searched what little there was of the Web back then." [...] Nick Jennings Photoshopped the smile on Count Orlok to make sure it matched Lender's board drawing. Lender said, [...] "It was my baby, and I held its hand until we shipped it overseas [...]" [...] Before his idea of Count Orlok, Lender thought of [...] "Floorboard Harry", a deleted gag that concludes the broadcast episode, in which he initially flickers the lights.|$|E
500|$|Some critics {{opined that}} the Underwood {{character}} is less interesting once he achieves {{his goal of}} becoming president and actually has to govern. [...] "You could take the show seriously {{just as long as}} you didn’t have to take it seriously, as long as it only took place in the dream world of imaginary fantasy politics," [...] wrote Aaron Bady of The New Republic, who compared Underwood unfavorably with Josiah Bartlett of The West Wing. [...] "But when a cartoon becomes president, it starts to look too fake to be real, but too real to be a cartoon. Frank plays the role of President Bartlett, a cartoon president doing <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> actually, in reality, be kind of great. But Bartlett was too good to be true, and the old Frank was too evil to be true. President Underwood is just too dull to be a fantasy, and so the props take center stage." ...|$|E
500|$|The cynicism, {{challenging}} {{of traditional}} beliefs, and political controversy of Hollywood films {{during this period}} mirrored the attitudes of many of their patrons. Also gone was the carefree and adventurous lifestyle of the 1920s. [...] "After two years the Jazz Age seems {{as far away as}} the days before the war", F. Scott Fitzgerald commented in 1931. In the sense noted by Fitzgerald, understanding the moral climate of the early 1930s is complex. Although films experienced an unprecedented level of freedom and dared to portray <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> be kept hidden for several decades, many in America looked upon the stock market crash as a product of the excesses of the previous decade. In looking back upon the 1920s, events were increasingly seen as occurring in prelude to the market crash. In Dance, Fools, Dance (1931), lurid party scenes featuring 1920s flappers are played to excess. Joan Crawford ultimately reforms her ways and is saved; less fortunate is William Bakewell, who continues on the careless path that leads to his ultimate self-destruction.|$|E

500|$|Swift and Liz Rose wrote [...] "Tim McGraw" [...] during Swift's {{freshman}} year at Hendersonville High School. She conceived the idea {{in the midst of}} her mathematics class: [...] "I was just sitting there, and I started humming this melody." [...] She then related the melody to a predicament she was encountering at the moment. Swift knew that she and her senior boyfriend would break {{up at the end of}} the year when he left for college. In order to cope with the complicated emotions she was experiencing, Swift wrote the song. Rose said Swift showed up at her after school job, writing songs for Sony/ATV Music, [...] "with the idea and the melody, knowing exactly what she wanted." [...] She desired for the song to capture the sweetness and sadness of loving and losing someone. It was written about all the different <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> remind the subject of Swift and their time spent together, once he departed. [...] "To her surprise, the first thing that came to mind was [...] love of Tim McGraw's music." [...] Several personal details were listed for the song. McGraw's mentioning was a reference to Swift's favorite song, [...] "Can't Tell Me Nothin" [...] from his 2004 album Live Like You Were Dying, rather than McGraw as a person. The writing process, as with [...] "Our Song", took place in approximately twenty minutes, and was executed with the use of a piano.|$|E
500|$|Brangwyn Hall in Swansea {{was used}} as the museum. Haynes wanted the museum to feel [...] "massive and eerie", and coached Blackwood to [...] "live in the moment". The opening {{sequence}} featuring young Amelia is filmed from her height, and was inspired by Steven Spielberg films in which people would look at things in awe. During this scene Haynes played appropriate music to help Blackwood get into the mood, as he had done during similar scenes when directing [...] "The Pandorica Opens". The set was filled with <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> seem like typical exhibits in the daytime, but appeared spooky at night. The exhibits also included historical anomalies which were the result of history collapsing, such as penguins on the Nile. Though Blackwood appeared as the seven-year-old version of Amy in [...] "The Eleventh Hour", the episode marked the first time Gillan and Blackwood—who are actually cousins—acted together. Gillan initially found this [...] "weird", but she commented that they quickly got used to it. The two versions of Amy were purposely dressed in similar colours. The cold open ends with Amy telling her younger self [...] "Okay kid, this is where it gets complicated" [...] after she has been revealed in the Pandorica. Moffat, after viewing the rushes, ordered the sequence to be reshot as Gillan had said [...] "really complicated", which conveyed a different meaning. As they had run out of time filming in the museum, all of the shots looking into the Pandorica were filmed three weeks later in the Pandorica chamber set.|$|E
2500|$|The review {{does offer}} one common {{reservation}} about the game: [...] "It doesn't lend itself easily to long-term campaign play. [...] This game is best {{treated as a}} succession of short adventure sessions in which players get to enjoy themselves doing all those despicable <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> spoil a more 'serious’ game." [...] However {{the conclusion of the}} review stated that [...] "As a tongue-in-cheek science-fiction game, this one is hard to beat." ...|$|E
