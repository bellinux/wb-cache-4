5|$|John Ralston Saul {{expressed}} the view in The Unconscious Civilization that in contemporary developed nations {{many people have}} acquiesced in turning over their {{sense of right and}} wrong, <b>their</b> <b>critical</b> conscience, to technical experts; willingly restricting their moral freedom of choice to limited consumer actions ruled by the ideology of the free market, while citizen participation in public affairs is limited to the isolated act of voting and private-interest lobbying turns even elected representatives against the public interest.|$|E
5|$|Stan is an {{elementary}} school student who commonly has extraordinary experiences not typical of conventional small-town life in his fictional hometown of South Park, Colorado. Stan is generally depicted as kind-hearted, intelligent, trustworthy and patient. He is outspoken in expressing his distinct lack of esteem for adults and their influences, as adult South Park residents rarely make use of <b>their</b> <b>critical</b> faculties.|$|E

5|$|Water {{temperature}} {{affects the}} sea turtle's metabolic rate. Lethargy is induced at temperatures between 13 and 15°C (55 and 59°F). The loggerhead {{takes on a}} floating, cold-stunned posture when temperatures drop to around 10°C. However, younger loggerheads are more resistant to cold and do not become stunned until temperatures drop below 9°C. The loggerheads' migration helps to prevent instances of cold-stunning. Higher water temperatures cause an increase in metabolism and heart rate. A loggerhead's body temperature increases in warmer waters more quickly than it decreases in colder water; <b>their</b> <b>critical</b> thermal maximum is currently unknown.|$|E
5|$|Louis Alexander Slotin (1 December 1910– 30 May 1946) was a Canadian {{physicist}} and chemist {{who worked on}} the Manhattan Project. During World War II, Slotin conducted research at Los Alamos National Laboratory. He performed experiments with uranium and plutonium cores to determine <b>their</b> <b>critical</b> mass values. On 21 May 1946, Slotin was conducting a demonstration when he accidentally initiated a fission reaction, which released a burst of hard radiation. He received a lethal dose of radiation and died of acute radiation syndrome nine days later. Slotin was the second person to die from a criticality accident, following the death of Harry Daghlian, who had been exposed to radiation by the same core that killed Slotin. Slotin was publicly hailed as a hero by the United States government for reacting quickly and preventing his accident from killing any colleagues. He was later criticized for failing to follow protocol during the experiment.|$|E

25|$|It {{should be}} noted, however, that the {{constructive}} element of deism was {{not unique to}} deism.

25|$|Magnet reliability: Superconducting magnets are {{generally}} {{used to generate}} the powerful magnetic fields to levitate and propel the trains. These magnets must be kept below <b>their</b> <b>critical</b> temperatures (this ranges form 4.2 K to 77 K, depending on the material). New alloys and manufacturing techniques in superconductors and cooling systems have helped address this issue.|$|E

25|$|SLiM {{functions}} {{in almost every}} pathway due to <b>their</b> <b>critical</b> role in regulatory function, protein-protein interaction and signal transduction. SLiM act as interaction modules that are recognised by additional biomolecules. The majority of known interaction partners of SLiMs are globular protein domains, though, SLiMs that recognise other intrinsically disordered regions, RNA and lipids have also been characterised. SLiMs can be broadly split into two high level classes, modification sites and ligand binding sites.|$|E
25|$|In {{spite of}} <b>their</b> <b>critical</b> and {{commercial}} success, the band's music was often eclipsed by its internal conflicts, stemming from Doherty's addictions to crack cocaine and heroin, which {{eventually led to}} the breakup of the band. Doherty has since stated that the breakup of the band was due to relationship difficulties between Barât and himself that were not related to his drug addictions. The members of the Libertines went on to form new bands with varying degrees of success.|$|E

25|$|Even {{though the}} {{microscopic}} physics {{of these two}} systems is completely different, <b>their</b> <b>critical</b> exponents {{turn out to be}} the same. Moreover, one can calculate these exponents using the same statistical field theory. The key observation is that at a phase transition or critical point, fluctuations occur at all length scales, and thus one should look for a scale-invariant statistical field theory to describe the phenomena. In a sense, universality is the observation that there are relatively few such scale-invariant theories.|$|E
25|$|The {{interior}} atmospheres of {{the solar}} system's gas giant planets are composed mainly of hydrogen and helium at temperatures well above <b>their</b> <b>critical</b> points. The gaseous outer atmospheres of Jupiter and Saturn transition smoothly into the dense liquid interior, while {{the nature of the}} transition zones of Neptune and Uranus is unknown. Theoretical models of extrasolar planets 55 Cancri e and Gliese 876 d have posited an ocean of pressurized, supercritical fluid water with a sheet of solid high pressure water ice at the bottom.|$|E
25|$|If {{the walls}} of the {{accelerating}} cavities are made of normally conducting material and the accelerating fields are large, the wall resistivity converts electric energy into heat quickly. On the other hand, superconductors also need constant cooling to keep them below <b>their</b> <b>critical</b> temperature, and the accelerating fields are limited by quenches. Therefore, high energy accelerators such as SLAC, still the longest in the world (in its various generations), are run in short pulses, limiting the average current output and forcing the experimental detectors to handle data coming in short bursts.|$|E

25|$|Despite <b>their</b> <b>critical</b> and {{commercial}} success, {{the group was}} plagued by legal turmoils and lineup changes during their concert tour. Though Kibum was shown in the ads and promotional videos for Super Show 2, he did not officially participate in the concert tour, and announced his temporary leave from the group to pursue his acting career. In October 2009, Kangin was charged with a DUI and hit-and-run after crashing into a parked taxi holding three passengers. In December 2009, Hankyung filed for contract termination from SM Entertainment, claiming that the provisions of his contract were unlawful, harsh, and against his rights. He parted with the group and released his solo album Geng Xin in July 2010, which sold over 510,000 copies. That same month, Kangin announced his hiatus to fulfill his two-year mandatory military service.|$|E
25|$|Islamic {{scholarship}} in Iran {{has a long}} tradition of debate and critique. This tradition has come to pose a challenge to the constitutional order of the Islamic Republic of Iran, as a number of seminary-trained scholars have applied <b>their</b> <b>critical</b> methods to basic issues of state legitimacy, in particular the state’s right to insist on interpretive closure. For example, Dr. Mehdi Ha’iri Yazdi, the son of the late Shaykh Abdolkarim Haeri, the founding member of the Qom Theology School, has written a book about criticism of velayat-e faqıh. The regime has responded with force, convening special clergy courts to silence and imprison scholars, in violation of seminary norms of scholarly debate. These conspicuous acts of discipline seem to have backfired, as each escalating punishment has generated new critics within.|$|E
25|$|Association {{football}} {{is also a}} popular sport in Trinidad and Tobago. The men's national football team qualified for the 2006 FIFA World Cup {{for the first time}} by beating Bahrain in Manama on 16 November 2005, making them the smallest country ever (in terms of population) to qualify. The team, coached by Dutchman Leo Beenhakker, and led by Tobagonian-born captain Dwight Yorke, drew their first group game – against Sweden in Dortmund, 0–0, but lost the second game to England on late goals, 0–2. They were eliminated after losing 2–0 to Paraguay in the last game of the Group Stage. Prior to the 2006 World Cup qualification, Trinidad and Tobago came agonisingly close in a controversial qualification campaign for the 1974 FIFA World Cup. Following the match, the referee of <b>their</b> <b>critical</b> game against Haiti was awarded a lifetime ban for his actions. Trinidad and Tobago again fell just short of qualifying for the World Cup in 1990, needing only a draw at home against the United States but losing 1–0. They play their home matches at the Hasely Crawford Stadium. Trinidad and Tobago hosted the 2001 FIFA U-17 World Championship, and hosted the 2010 FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup.|$|E
