5|$|The {{defeat in}} Mile High Stadium {{proved to be}} the last of Cleveland's streak of playoff {{appearances}} in the mid- to late-1980s. Kosar played through numerous injuries in 1989, including bruising on his right arm and a bad knee. Strong defense had carried the Browns to the playoffs even when the offense faltered, but that all crumbled in 1990. Kosar threw more interceptions than touchdowns {{for the first time in}} his career, and the defense allowed more points <b>than</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> <b>in</b> the league. The Browns' 2–7 start cost Carson his job. Jim Shofner was named interim head coach, and the team finished 3–13. After the season Bill Belichick, the defensive coordinator of the then-Super Bowl champion New York Giants, was named head coach.|$|E
5|$|In November 1994, the Siege of Bihać, {{a battle}} of the Bosnian War, entered a {{critical}} stage as the VRS and the ARSK came close to capturing the town of Bihać from the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (ARBiH). It was a strategic area and, since June 1993, Bihać {{had been one of}} six United Nations Safe Areas established in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The US administration felt that its capture by Serb forces would intensify the war and lead to a humanitarian disaster greater <b>than</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> <b>in</b> the conflict to that point. Amongst the United States, France and the United Kingdom, division existed regarding how to protect the area. The US called for airstrikes against the VRS, but the French and the British opposed them citing safety concerns and a desire to maintain the neutrality of French and British troops deployed {{as a part of the}} UNPROFOR in Bosnia and Herzegovina. In turn, the US was unwilling to commit ground troops. On the other hand, the Europeans recognized that the US was free to propose military confrontation with the Serbs while relying on the European powers to block any such move, since French President François Mitterrand discouraged any military intervention, greatly aiding the Serb war effort. The French stance reversed after Jacques Chirac was elected president of France in May 1995, pressuring the British to adopt a more aggressive approach as well. Denying Bihać to the Serbs was also strategically important to Croatia, and General Janko Bobetko, the Chief of the Croatian General Staff, considered the potential fall of Bihać to represent an end to Croatia's war effort.|$|E

25|$|Nonetheless, {{the chapel}} {{was not to}} be 'hidden' away in the centre of the estate, even as the trees lining its {{approach}} matured. Collison and Hosking sought a prominent and unapologetic landmark that would be seen from a good distance beyond the cemetery well into the future. To achieve this, whilst only being slowly revealed on its approach from the main entrance, considerable height was required. William Hosking considered this to be best suited to a steeple – it would need to be much higher <b>than</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> <b>in</b> the vicinity, surpassing that of the local parish church, to produce maximum effect.|$|E
25|$|In reconstituting the Byzantine Empire Michael VIII {{restored}} the old administration without endeavouring to correct its failures. In recovering Constantinople and {{investing in the}} defence of his European provinces, Michael VIII began to denude the Anatolian frontier of its troops {{and was forced to}} lower their pay or cancel their tax exemptions. This policy led to the gradual collapse of the frontier, which was infiltrated by Turkish bands even before the death of Michael VIII in Pachomios village, Thrace in December 1282. The Palaiologan dynasty he established ruled the Byzantine Empire for almost two centuries, longer <b>than</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> <b>in</b> Roman history. Also, during his reign there was a temporary naval revival in which the Byzantine navy consisted of 80 ships.|$|E
25|$|A major advance which {{accelerated}} {{this project}} was {{the introduction of the}} caravel in the mid-15th century, a ship that could be sailed closer to the wind <b>than</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> <b>in</b> operation in Europe at the time. Using this new maritime technology, Portuguese navigators reached ever more southerly latitudes, advancing at an average rate of one degree a year. Senegal and Cape Verde Peninsula were reached in 1445. The first feitoria trade post overseas was established then under Henry's directions, in 1445 on the island of Arguin off the coast of Mauritania, to attract Muslim traders and monopolize the business in the routes traveled in North Africa, starting the chain of Portuguese feitorias along the coast. In 1446, Álvaro Fernandes pushed on almost as far as present-day Sierra Leone and the Gulf of Guinea was reached in the 1460s.|$|E

25|$|By {{the mid-19th}} century, the {{jewellery}} trade {{was considered the}} most lucrative in the city with jewellers being {{some of the best}} paid workers in the city. There were also more people employed in the trade <b>than</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> <b>in</b> the city. Boys were given apprenticeships at the age of 14 and earned four shillings on average. This would increase annually until they were 21 where would work from 8am till 7pm. Although, it was common for jewellers to work overtime. Apprentices generally did not require any qualifications but style became a study within the industry and one jeweller's firm required all apprentices to attend the Birmingham School of Art. Families generally were not employed in the trade due to the cleanliness and careful manipulations needed in the crafting of certain pieces. Most families earned income {{as a result of the}} trade by producing leather or paper boxes which were used extensively by jewellers to protect finishes articles.|$|E
25|$|The men's {{competition}} featured two prolonged five-set matches. In the first, #1 seed Roger Federer {{was pushed}} to the limit by Janko Tipsarević before triumphing; 6–7, 7–6, 5–7, 6–1, 10–8 in 267minutes. The second featured Australian hopeful Lleyton Hewitt, who defeated Marcos Baghdatis 4–6, 7–5, 7–5, 6–7, 6–3 in a match that provoked discussion {{about the validity of}} night matches; the players did not finish play until 04:34, 282minutes since it started at 11:52. Significantly, the match extended further into the evening <b>than</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> <b>in</b> the history of the Australian Open. The Federer-Tipsarević match, which lasted 267minutes, overlapped into the night session and this delayed the commencement of the women's singles match between Venus Williams and Sania Mirza until 10:00. Rules had previously been put in place so that a men's singles match would not start if other matches had played past 11:00; however, with the home crowd growing anxious, the organizers decided {{to go ahead with the}} Hewitt vs. Baghdatis match.|$|E

25|$|A major advance was the {{introduction}} of the caravel in the mid-15th century, a small ship able to sail windward more <b>than</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> <b>in</b> Europe at the time. Evolved from fishing ships designs, they were the first that could leave the coastal cabotage navigation and sail safely on the open Atlantic. For celestial navigation the Portuguese used the Ephemerides, which experienced a remarkable diffusion in the 15th century. These were astronomical charts plotting the location of the stars over a distinct period of time. Published in 1496 by the Jewish astronomer, astrologer, and mathematician Abraham Zacuto, the Almanach Perpetuum included some of these tables for the movements of stars. These tables revolutionized navigation, allowing the calculation of latitude. Exact longitude, however, remained elusive, and mariners struggled to determine it for centuries. Using the caravel, systematic exploration continued ever more southerly, advancing on average one degree a year. Senegal and Cape Verde Peninsula were reached in 1445 and in 1446, Álvaro Fernandes pushed on almost as far as present-day Sierra Leone.|$|E
25|$|Historically, Manchester {{has been}} linked with high {{scientific}} achievement: the university and its constituent former institutions combined had 25 Nobel laureates among their students and staff, the third largest number of any single university in the United Kingdom (after Oxford and Cambridge) and the ninth largest of any university in Europe. Furthermore, according to an academic poll two of the top ten discoveries by university academics and researchers were made at the university (namely the first working computer and the contraceptive pill). The university currently employs four Nobel Prize winners amongst its staff, more <b>than</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> <b>in</b> the UK.

25|$|Those {{sentenced to}} death before c. 1800 at the castle were usually taken to Lancaster Moor, near where the Ashton Memorial now stands, to be hanged. After the Georgian remodelling of the castle, it was {{decided it would be}} more {{convenient}} to perform executions nearer the castle. The spot chosen became known as Hanging Corner. Lancaster has a reputation as the court that sentenced more people to death <b>than</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> <b>in</b> England. This is partly because until 1835 Lancaster Castle was the only Assize Court in the entire county and covered rapidly growing industrial centres including Manchester and Liverpool. Between 1782 and 1865, around 265people were hanged at Lancaster; the executions were frequently attended by thousands of people crowded into the churchyard. The Capital Punishment Amendment Act 1868 ended public executions, requiring that criminals be put to death in private, after which 6 executions were performed inside the castle, at first from the Chapel steps (5), then later (1) in a purpose-built execution shed, on the inside wall of Hanging Corner. This shed remained until the mid-20th Century, allegedly still containing the Gallows. The last execution (of Thomas Rawcliffe, wife-murderer) at Lancaster took place in 1910. The prison closed in 1916 due to a national {{decrease in the number of}} prisoners, although for part of the First World War it held German civilians and prisoners of war.|$|E
