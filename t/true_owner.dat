The Registrar General’s Department make it a requirement for all business owners to provide their PIN on the Lebanese Identity Card during business registration. This eliminates business registration fraud through the exposure of false identities and prevents multiple registrations of businesses for fraudulent purposes.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, {{an unknown}} mudbrick mastaba was {{discovered}} in Quesna, an archaeological site located in the Monufia Governorate (in the Nile Delta). The mastaba was once 14m in length and 6m in width. Its substructure contains a 3m wide corridor chapel, divided into three architectural sections: the first (northern) section is filled with rubble, the second (central) section contains a double room as the burial chamber and the third (southern) section has a burial shaft in its center. In 2014, a tiny mud seal fragment with the king's name {{was discovered in}}side. The <b>true</b> <b>owner</b> of the tomb, however, is unknown and archaeological excavations are still on-going.|$|E

25|$|In Eason v Newman , a finder of a chattel {{was held}} liable {{on the ground}} that he had wrongfully refused to return it to the <b>true</b> <b>owner.</b> There was some {{judicial}} opposition to this ruling. It was criticized and precedent was not followed.|$|E
25|$|In colonial America, {{replevin}} {{was used}} {{more often than}} detinue.

25|$|Treasure trove is {{an amount}} of money or coin, gold, silver, plate, or bullion found hidden {{underground}} or {{in places such as}} cellars or attics, where the treasure seems old enough for it to be presumed that the <b>true</b> <b>owner</b> is dead and the heirs undiscoverable.

25|$|The {{statute of}} {{limitations}} applies only to the disseisor's time on the property, not how long the <b>true</b> <b>owner</b> may have been dispossessed of it (by, say, another disseisor who then left the property). However, if adverse possession is continuous between two or more successive disseisors without interruption, {{it may be possible}} for the second disseisor to claim adverse possession for the entire period based upon a legal doctrine known as tacking.|$|E
25|$|In the Philippines, amulets {{are called}} agimat or anting-anting. According to folklore, the most {{powerful}} anting-anting is the hiyas ng saging (directly translated as pearl or gem of the banana). The hiyas must come from a mature banana and only comes out during midnight. Before the person can fully possess this agimat, he must fight a supernatural creature called kapre. Only then will he be its <b>true</b> <b>owner.</b> During Holy Week, devotees travel to Mount Banahaw to recharge their amulets.|$|E
25|$|It {{was also}} {{stated in the}} press release that the owner of mega yacht Pelorus — Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich — was not the {{customer}} behind Sigma. Nevertheless, because Pelorus was undergoing a concurrent refit at the same shipyard, and because both projects shared the same management company, there was continued speculation that the two vessels had a common owner throughout As construction. Melnichenko was not confirmed as the <b>true</b> <b>owner</b> until after the ship was delivered in July 2008.|$|E

5000|$|Sydney Cove first {{appears in}} the {{supplemental}} pages to Lloyd's Register for 1806, which gives her owner as Plummer, her master as Edwards, and her trade as London-South Seas.

The <b>true</b> <b>owners</b> were Lord, Cable and Underwood.|$|R
5000|$|Nemo dat quod non habet: The basic {{rule that}} a person who does not own {{property}} (e.g. a thief) cannot confer it on another except with the <b>true</b> <b>owner's</b> authority (i.e. as his agent). Exceptions to this rule include sales under statutory powers, and cases where the doctrine of estoppel prevents a legal owner from denying a seller's right to sell.|$|R
25|$|A {{disseisor}} will be {{committing a}} civil trespass {{on the property}} he has taken {{and the owner of}} the property could cause him to be evicted by an action in trespass ("ejectment") or by bringing an action for possession. All common law jurisdictions require that an ejectment action be brought within a specified time, after which the <b>true</b> <b>owner</b> is assumed to have acquiesced. The effect of a failure by the true landowner to evict the adverse possessor depends on the jurisdiction, but will eventually result in title by adverse possession.|$|E
25|$|The party seeking title by adverse {{possession}} {{may be called}} the disseisor, meaning one who dispossesses the <b>true</b> <b>owner</b> of the property. Although the elements of an {{adverse possession}} claim are different in each state, adverse possession requires at a minimum five basic conditions being met to perfect {{the title of the}} disseisor. These are that the disseisor must openly occupy the property exclusively, {{in a manner that is}} open and notorious, keep out others, and use it as if it were his own. Some states impose additional requirements.|$|E
25|$|The law of {{treasure}} trove in the United States varies {{from state to}} state, but certain general conclusions may be drawn. To be {{treasure trove}}, an object must be of gold or silver. Paper money is also deemed to be treasure trove since it previously represented gold or silver. On the same reasoning, it might be imagined that coins and tokens in metals other than gold or silver are also included, but this {{has yet to be}} clearly established. The object must be concealed for long enough so {{it is unlikely that the}} <b>true</b> <b>owner</b> will reappear to claim it. The consensus appears to be that the object must be at least a few decades old.|$|E

25|$|Generally, the disseisor's openly hostile {{possession}} must be continual (although not necessarily constant) without challenge or {{permission from the}} lawful owner, but breaks in use {{that are consistent with}} how an owner would use the property will not prevent an adverse possession claim. Occasional activity on the land with long gaps in activity fail the test of continuous possession; courts have ruled that merely cutting timber at intervals, when not accompanied by other actions that demonstrate actual and continuous possession, fails to demonstrate continuous possession. If {{at any time during the}} statute of limitations period, the <b>true</b> <b>owner</b> ejects the disseisor from the land either verbally or through legal action, and the disseisor then returns and dispossesses him again, then the statute of limitations period begins anew.|$|E
25|$|Miroslav Bárta instead proposes mastaba AS-54 in South-Abusir as {{the most}} {{possible}} burial site. This is promoted by the finding of a polished magnesite bowl, which shows the niswt-bity title of Huni. The mastaba itself was once pretty large and contained large niches and chapels. It also contained a quite large amount of polished dishes, vases and urnes. Contradictorily, nearly all the vessels are undecorated, no ink inscription or carving {{were found on the}} objects. Thus, the name of the <b>true</b> <b>owner</b> is yet unknown. Only one vessel clearly shows Huni's name while a few other might show small traces. Bárta thus sees two possibilities for the owner of the mastaba: it was either a very high ranked official, such as a prince of Huni's time, or king Huni himself.|$|E
25|$|Finds {{of money}} and lost {{property}} are dealt with by other states through legislation. These statutes usually require finders to report their finds {{to the police and}} transfer to their custody the objects. The police then advertise the finds to try to locate their <b>true</b> <b>owner.</b> If the objects remain unclaimed for a specified period of time, title in them vests in the finders. New Jersey vests buried or hidden property in the landowner, Indiana in the county, Vermont in the town, and Maine in the township and the finder equally. In Louisiana, French codes have been followed, so half of a found object goes to the finder and the other half to the landowner. The position in Puerto Rico, the laws of which are based on civil law, is similar.|$|E

"Squatting" [...] {{can result}} in [...] "adverse possession", that in common law, is {{the process by which}} title to another's real {{property}} is acquired without compensation, by holding the property in a manner that conflicts with the <b>true</b> <b>owner's</b> rights for a specified period of time. Circumstances of the adverse possession determine the type of title acquired by the adverse possessor, which may be fee simple title, mineral rights, or another interest in real property.|$|R

A race-notice statute requires a subsequent purchaser to be bona fide and record first.|$|R
