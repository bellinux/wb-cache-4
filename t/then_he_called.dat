25|$|On Lee’s {{transfer}} to Richmond, he detailed urgent defense construction, <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>called</b> on Lawton’s “earnest and close attention” to the Federal’s probable {{approach to the}} city. “It looks now {{as if he would}} take the Savannah River”. Guns located in island batteries were to be removed to the mainland in and around Savannah’s defensive lines. Obstructions in the river above the city were to be set by hands provided by upriver planters {{in the event of an}} envelopment by way of Fort McAllister. “Every effort must be made” to retard or prevent further progress of the enemy directly upriver on the Savannah River approaches. “If he attempts to advance by batteries on the marshes or islands, he must be driven back, if possible.” Scouts were ordered out “so as to discover his first lodgment, when they can be broken up.” An additional three-gun battery at MacKay’s Point was not intended to stop federal gunboats in force, but with Tattnall’s gunboat support, they could prevent Federal batteries from being built on Elba Island to threaten Old Fort Jackson.|$|E

Barrett ordered the Massachusetts men to form one long line two abreast {{on the highway}} leading down to the bridge, and <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>called</b> for another consultation. While overlooking North Bridge {{from the top of}} the hill, Barrett, Lt. Col. John Robinson of Westford and the other Captains discussed possible courses of action. [...] Captain Isaac Davis of Acton, whose troops had arrived late, declared his willingness to defend a town not their own by saying, [...] "I'm not afraid to go, and I haven't a man that's afraid to go." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a {{neighboring}} house a [...] "Japanese" [...] man, T. Shitara, telephoned Inglewood officials {{to report the}} event; his first call, to the [...] "constable of the town" [...] was unsuccessful; <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>called</b> the city marshal's office, and Frank Woerner responded aboard a motorcycle that was piloted by a civilian, Clyde Vannatta. Shots were exchanged {{and one of the}} Klansmen fell mortally wounded. He was M.B. Mosher, the constable who could not be reached when Shitara called earlier.|$|E
50|$|At {{the end of}} the series, {{he realizes}} that he was still a {{powerful}} fighter, but was simply overshadowed by Kitano's invincible forces (chapter 84). <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> himself Hekikuu High no. 8.|$|R

50|$|Paul de Senneville can {{allegedly}} neither read, write, nor play music. He sings {{into a small}} {{tape recorder}} {{at home or in}} his studio. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> a pianist (or an arranger) to help him make an arrangement, before recording it with a larger ensemble.|$|R

The final closing segment of the series, broadcast on June 25, 1965, featured Paar sitting alone on a stool, sharing a discussion that he had with his daughter Randy, who called Paar's departure a sabbatical. He said that his own field was, though not completely used up, [...] "a little dry recently." [...] <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>called</b> to his German shepherd, who came to him from the seats of what was, for once, an empty studio, and walked out. (Johnny Carson used this format, without a dog, for his own farewell episode of The Tonight Show in 1992.) ...|$|E
2500|$|When songwriter/producer Kashif {{accepted}} Arista president Clive Davis' {{invitation to}} see a New York club performance by a young singer named Whitney Houston that he'd just signed to the label, he was disappointed. Her act was a lounge act and didn't appeal to Kashif. Davis continued to court Kashif sending him a videotape of Houston's performance on The Merv Griffin Show. La La, a writer signed to Kashif's music publishing company, sent him a demo of a ballad she had written titled [...] "You Give Good Love." [...] She'd sent it to her idol Roberta Flack first but she was rebuffed by her assistant with an angry [...] "don't call us, we'll call you" [...] retort. When Kashif heard the song, a light bulb came out in his mind that flashed [...] "hit! hit!" [...] <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>called</b> Gerry Griffith, an Arista A man, and said that [...] "I think I have a song for you." [...] So Griffith and Houston drove to the New Jersey studio where Kashif was working to check it out. Griffith recalled {{that there was a}} demo of the song but La La wanted to sing it live with her piano playing. After La La finished the song, Griffith said [...] "that's the song – that's what I've been looking for." [...] It was the kind of tune that had the emotion that she could get into and sing her heart out. The release of [...] "You Give Good Love" [...] was designed to give Houston a noticeable position and standing within the black music charts. Clive Davis later explained the thinking behind releasing the song as the debut single from the album: ...|$|E

50|$|Marshall emails a video {{transmission}} to the world’s press, {{telling them to}} visit the EmbroGen website in an hour’s time. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> Salko from his office, distracting him {{just long enough for}} Jay to be able to hide a remote controlled video camera behind the gigantic portrait of Salko that is about to be hung on the wall.|$|R
40|$|The Pope came in Zagreb in Croatia as the pilgrim {{of peace}} and companionship. From his few speeches result two main thoughts.

60|$|Mr. Dudder lost no time {{in paying}} Mammy Shrader a visit, and <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>called</b> on Doctor Reed. When he came home again he was very angry.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, in fact, {{they ask}} him, though not {{formally}} in words. They ask him by rising. In large meetings among men, whoever wants to speak, stands up, {{and then the}} president calls their name, and that is giving him permission to speak.
