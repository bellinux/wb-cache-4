In this paper a comparison between two multi-resolution approaches are used for speckle reduction in ultrasound images. The method uses wavelet approach for enhancement; soft threshold and power law, with non linear upper and lower cutoff, modifications are used for comparison. Enhancement involves smoothing speckles at homogenous areas and preserving thin details and edges. Application of these methods on ultrasonic images proved a significant improvement of speckle reduction. The comparison proves that wavelet soft <b>thresolding</b> method gives better homogenization inside object and preserves edges, which is a promising preprocessing result for segmentation purpose...|$|R

40|$|Introduction Cross-subject {{analysis}} of structural and/or functional images often requires accurate localisation of cortical convolutions (sulci and gyri). This is particularly relevant {{to better understand}} the anatomical/functional relationships within the brain and to increase accuracy in neuro-surgical planning. Internal brain structures are easily identified on high resolution MRI, using the Talairach space, thanks to their low variability. Unfortunately, localisation and identification of sulci are very difficult tasks because of the high variability of cortical structures. In this work, we propose an approach for automatic localisation and identification of sulci on MR images. Methods Brain is automatically extracted and segmented into cerebro-spinal fluid (CSF), grey matter and white matter using morphological operators (<b>thresolding,</b> filtering, erosion, reconstruction, dilatation). 3 D skeletonization and curve thinning are applied on CSF.

40|$|Thresholding is {{a popular}} method of image segmentation. Many {{thresholding}} methods utilize only the gray level information of pixels in the image, which may lead to poor segmentation performance because the spatial correlation information between pixels is ignored. To improve the performance of <b>thresolding</b> methods, a novel two-dimensional histogram—called gray level-local variance (GLLV) histogram—is proposed in this paper as an entropic thresholding method to segment images with bimodal histograms. The GLLV histogram is constructed by using the gray level information of pixels and its local variance in a neighborhood. Local variance measures the dispersion of gray level distribution of pixels in a neighborhood. If a pixel’s gray level is close to its neighboring pixels, its local variance is small, and vice versa. Therefore, local variance can reflect the spatial information between pixels. The GLLV histogram takes not only the gray level, but also the spatial information into consideration. Experimental results show that an entropic thresholding method based on the GLLV histogram can achieve better segmentation performance...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Crucial {{information}} {{barely visible}} to the human eye is often embedded {{in a series of}} low resolution images taken of the same scene. Super resolution reconstruction is the process of combining several low resolution images into a single higher resolution image. The ideal algorithm should be fast, and should add sharpness and details, both at edges and in regions without adding artifacts. In this paper we propose a super resolution blind reconstruction technique for linearly degraded images. In our proposed technique the algorithm is divided into three parts an image registration, wavelets based fusion and an image restoration. In this paper three low resolution images are considered which may sub pixels shifted, rotated, blurred or noisy, the sub pixel shifted images are registered using affine transformation model; A wavelet based fusion is performed and the noise is removed using soft <b>thresolding.</b> Our proposed technique reduces blocking artifacts and also smoothens the edges and it is also able to restore high frequency details in an image.

30|$|Identification of diffraction-limited spots {{from the}} images {{produced}} by the cameras formed {{the first step in}} data processing for the reconstruction of super-resolution images. The simulated images {{produced by the}} cameras were filtered using a 5 x 5 Gaussian kernel. Based on the pixel intensity values, the local maxima were then identified in the image. In order to distinguish the local maxima arising from diffraction-limited spots with the false positives arising from background and camera noise sources, a thresholding operation was performed. A fixed thresholding criterion was adopted for simulated images from all cameras (CCD, EMCCD, sCMOS and SPAD array), on the basis of number of photons and background noise as reported by Ma et al. (2013). The threshold was set at a value equal to 3 times the standard deviation of the background noise and pixel values were compared with the set threshold. Pixels satisfying the criterion were selected for localization. Prior knowledge of the location of the spot {{on the basis of the}} simulation settings was used to verify whether the diffraction-limited spot was correctly identified or not. It has to be noted that the spot identification performance results of the cameras were strongly influenced by the type of spot identification criterion adopted.

In this study, we aimed to survey the effect of sound conditioning on auditory brainstem response (ABR) threshold shifts using click stimulus, {{and the effect of}} the frequency of conditioning on hearing protection. Methods: Fifteen guinea pigs were randomly divided into 3 groups. Two conditioned groups were exposed to 1 kHz, and 4 kHz octave band noise at 85 dB SPL, 6 hours per day for 5 days, respectively.

In this study,image of the stationary samples were analyzed first to establish the methods to remove bad kernels. then, the images of the moving samples were analyzed to investigate the difference between the <b>thresolds</b> of the static and dynamic sorting test. Finally, dynamic sorting test was conducted by using two cameras to grab two different sides of the sample and analyzing these two images immediately. The results of the stationary images analyses reveal that the damage ratio can be used as the sorting parameter for the seriously abnormal- colored kernels; the damage ratio and the average hue have to be used as the sorting parameters for slightly abnormal-colored kernels; the average first difference can be used to remove the shrunk kernels;the compactness can be used to remove the kernels with sprout; and the average hue and the damage ratio are needed to sort out the broken samples. In dynamic sorting test, the sorting parameters used were the same as those used in static sorting test; however, the shrunk samples and samples with sprout were not included in dynamic test. In dynamic test, it took about 0. 44 seconds to sort a sample and the sorting accuracy rate is 94. 8 %。本研究使用機器視覺代替人眼進行落花生仁選別。選別機之主要設備包括 兩部攝影機、影像擷取卡、影像處理加速卡以及微電腦；並以微處理器介 面技術控制取像及吹氣時間。研究過程是，首先分析靜態落花生仁影像， 建立去除不良落花生之方法。然後分析動態影像，探討靜態與動態選別分 劃值之差異。最後使用兩部攝影機擷取與分析落花生仁不同兩面之影像， 進行動態選別試驗。由靜態影像分析之結果得知，重度顏色不正常落花生 仁可以損壞比率值做為選別參數；輕微顏色不正常落花生仁可以損壞比率 值及平均色相值二條件做為選別參數；皺皮落花生仁可以平均一次差分值 做為選別參數；發芽落花生仁可以細密度值做為選別參數；破粒落花生仁 可以平均色相值及損壞比率值二條件做為選別參數。動態選別時，不良落 花生仁之判別方法與靜態選別者相同，惟動態選別時之樣品不包括皺皮及 發芽落花生仁。每一顆落花生仁動態選別所需之時間為 0. 44 秒；動態選別 結果，選別準確率為 94. 8 %...|$|R
40|$|Abstract X-ray {{computed}} tomography (CT) {{is a medical}} imaging modality that allows reconstruction of the internal stucture {{of the human body}} from a large number of x-ray attenuation measurements. In recent years, the development of spectral CT, in which the energy dependence of the x-ray attenuation coe-cient is utilized, has attracted considerable interest. This thesis is concerned with a spectral CT system based on a photon-counting silicon strip detector which is being developed in our group. A computer model for photon counting spectral CT was developed and used for simulating the proposed CT system as well as a laboratory CT setup designed for testing purposes. The simulations were used to compare the performance of two reconstruction methods for spectral CT, image-based energy weighting and basis material decomposition. The study shows that the two methods perform equally well when the number of x-ray photons in each measurement is high, while basis material decomposition performs signcantly worse than energy weighting for data with few photons in each measurement. Also included in the thesis is a simulation study of the detrimental eects of electronic noise and <b>thresold</b> variations on image quality. It is shown that a proposed electronic noise reduction of 20 % in the readout channels gives an improvement in mean   SDNR 2 over many channels of only 1. 8 %.
