5|$|An infant's new tooth {{is celebrated}} with bowls of {{sweetened}} wheat or barley and sweets served after a child's circumcision include baklava and Burma. Christian families in mourning serve a sweet bun known as rahmeh. It is a food eaten in remembrance {{of the dead}} and as a gesture of blessing the soul of the deceased person. The Greek Orthodox Church offer a special <b>tray</b> <b>with</b> cooked wheat covered with sugar and candy after a memorial service.|$|E
5|$|The {{choice of}} tea {{offered to the}} guests is diverse, and {{includes}} the hotel's own Dorchester Blend. The service includes a first course consisting of finger sandwiches with sliced cucumber, cream cheese, and smoked salmon, all served in silver trays, a second course consisting of scones with clotted cream and jam, followed by a pastry <b>tray</b> <b>with</b> a selection of freshly-made patisseries.|$|E
5|$|Regarded {{throughout}} his playing career {{as one of}} the best defenders in hockey, Ross was named to the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1949, selected for his playing career rather than his work as an executive. A ceremony for his induction was held prior to a Bruins game on December 2, 1949, where he was given his Hall of Fame scroll and a silver <b>tray</b> <b>with</b> the emblems of the six NHL teams on it. In 1975 he was inducted into the Canadian Sports Hall of Fame. Along with his two sons he donated the Art Ross Trophy to the NHL in 1947, to be awarded to the leading scorer in the league's regular season. In 1984 he was posthumously awarded the Lester Patrick Trophy for service to hockey in the United States.|$|E

5|$|The HTC Dream was {{the first}} ever {{smartphone}} to ship with the Android operating system. The operating system heavily integrates with, and provides apps for various Google services, such as Gmail (with push email support), Maps, Search, Talk, and YouTube, while the contacts and calendar apps can sync with the online Google Contacts and Google Calendar services respectively. The device also ships with an email app supporting other POP3 and IMAP-based mail services, an instant messaging app with support for multiple services, and a WebKit-based web browser. A notification system displays icons for certain events (such as e-mails and text messages) {{on the left side}} of the status bar across the top of the screen; dragging down from the top of the screen exposes a <b>tray</b> <b>with</b> more detailed information for each notification. The Android Market can be used to download additional apps for the device. The G1 as sold by T-Mobile also shipped with an Amazon MP3 app, allowing users to purchase DRM-free music online, and download them straight to the device via Wi-Fi.|$|E
5|$|The pilot {{episode was}} heavily {{promoted}} {{in the weeks}} leading up to its airing. Laura Benanti appeared on a retro style cover of Playboy magazine released on September 16, 2011. The magazine had a 1961 theme, which included an old-fashioned visual style, photos of 1960s Playboy bunnies and clubs, and the same sixty cent price as that time period. Benanti wore a black bunny costume and held a <b>tray</b> <b>with</b> drinks on the cover photo. NBC also entered into a cross-promotional deal with the Bloomingdale's department store. The Walton Street store in Chicago included display windows inspired by the series, which were unveiled in September 2011 by Benanti, as well as Naturi Naughton and Wes Ramsey. Chosen for the storefronts due to its close proximity to the original Playboy Club, the Walton Street store allowed visitors to take virtual photos with the show's stars, view photos of the real-life clubs and the show's set, and enter into a contest to win such prizes as a walk-on role on the show and a $5,000 Bloomingdale's shopping spree.|$|E

25|$|Passengers {{would pass}} the time by reading by candlelight or playing cards and games such as Nine Men's Morris. Meals on board were cooked by the firebox, which was an iron <b>tray</b> <b>with</b> sand in it on which a fire was built. This was risky because it was kept in the waist of the ship. Passengers made their own meals from rations that were issued daily and food was cooked for a group at a time.|$|E
25|$|A TV {{dinner is}} a prepackaged, frozen or chilled meal {{generally}} {{in an individual}} package. It requires little preparation, oven baked or microwaveable, and contains all the elements for a single-serving meal in a <b>tray</b> <b>with</b> compartments for the food. Carl A. Swanson of C.A. Swanson & Sons is generally credited for inventing the TV dinner. Retired Swanson executive Gerry Thomas said he conceived the idea after the company found itself with a huge surplus of frozen turkeys because of poor Thanksgiving sales.|$|E
25|$|In South Indian temples, often each {{god will}} have His or Her own shrine, each {{contained}} in a miniature house (specifically, a mandir). These shrines are often scattered around the temple compound, with the three main ones being in the main area. The statue of the God (murti) is placed on a stone pedestal in the shrine, and one or more lamps are hung in the shrine. There is usually a space to put the puja tray (<b>tray</b> <b>with</b> worship offerings). Directly outside the main shrine {{there will be a}} statue of the god's vahana or vehicle. The shrines have curtains hung over the entrances, and wooden doors which are shut when the Deities are sleeping. Some South Indian temples have one main altar, with several statues placed upon it.|$|E

25|$|Wait staff trays are {{typically}} large circular disks used to serve drinks and/or food {{to people in}} restaurants, bars, and other hospitality industry businesses. The waiter or waitress carries the <b>tray</b> <b>with</b> the open palm of one hand placed underneath, in about {{the center of the}} tray, relying on dry friction between the hand and the smooth metal or plastic undersurface of the tray to retain control of the tray. Occasionally, the tray may slide from the waitperson's hand, and the contents crash to the floor. In a May 2012 survey of food industry servers, those responding revealed nearly 25 percent of staff that work or have worked in the hospitality industry have suffered an injury {{as a result of a}} toppled serving tray. Of those people questioned, 23 percent had burned or cut themselves while trying to serve drinks or food from a serving tray.|$|E
25|$|Home shrines can be {{as simple}} or as {{elaborate}} as the householder can afford. Large, ornate shrines can be purchased in India and countries with large Hindu minorities, like Malaysia and Singapore. They are usually made of wood and have tiled floors for statues to be placed upon. Pictures may be hung {{on the walls of the}} shrine. The top of the shrine may have a series of levels, like a gopuram tower on a temple. Each Hindu altar will have at least one oil lamp and may contain a <b>tray</b> <b>with</b> puja equipment as well. Hindus with large houses will set aside one room as their puja room, with the altar at one end of it. Some South Indians also place a shrine with pictures of their departed relatives on the right side of the room, and make offerings to them before making offerings to the gods.|$|E
25|$|Most of {{the food}} aboard is vacuum sealed in plastic bags. Cans are rare because they are heavy and {{expensive}} to transport. Preserved food is not highly regarded by the crew, and taste is reduced in microgravity. Therefore, effort is made to make the food more palatable, such as using more spices than in regular cooking. The crew looks forward {{to the arrival of}} any ships from Earth, as they bring fresh fruit and vegetables. Care is taken that foods do not create crumbs. Sauces are often used to avoid contaminating station equipment. Each crew member has individual food packages and cooks them using the on-board galley. The galley features two food warmers, a refrigerator added in November 2008, and a water dispenser that provides both heated and unheated water. Drinks are provided as dehydrated powder that is mixed with water before consumption. Drinks and soups are sipped from plastic bags with straws. Solid food is eaten with a knife and fork attached to a <b>tray</b> <b>with</b> magnets to prevent them from floating away. Any food that floats away, including crumbs, must be collected to prevent it from clogging the station's air filters and other equipment.|$|E

500|$|The Beckman {{spectrophotometer}} was {{the first}} easy-to-use single instrument containing both the optical and electronic components needed for ultraviolet-absorption spectrophotometry within a single housing. The user could insert a cell <b>tray</b> <b>with</b> standard and sample cells, dial up the desired wavelength of light, confirm that the instrument was properly set by measuring the standard, and then measure the amount of absorption of the sample, reading the frequency from a simple meter. A series of readings at different wavelengths could be taken without disturbing the sample. [...] The DU spectrophotometer's manual scanning method was extremely fast, reducing analysis times from weeks or hours to minutes.|$|E
500|$|The musicians {{created the}} album tracks through {{improvisation}} and experimentation. As a result, the initial plan {{to release a}} single EP of the material expanded to include the increasing amount of material. Viglione contributed percussion to tracks 19 and 22. He stated that Reznor's instructions to him were to [...] "build a drumkit. Piece together any stuff {{that you want to}} bang on; rent what you want to rent. Have fun and... be creative—See where your mind and your ideas take you." [...] Viglione's makeshift drum kit included a 50-gallon trash can, a pair of water cooler jugs, and a cookie <b>tray</b> <b>with</b> a chain across it. Alessandro Cortini is credited on a total of ten tracks from Ghosts for his contributions on guitar, bass guitar, dulcimer, and electronics. Cortini was brought onto the project two weeks into the process, and his involvement evolved from [...] "first recording some extra parts to some tracks" [...] and eventually into [...] "a collaboration on [...] tracks noted in the booklet". Adrian Belew was also brought on for select instrumental contributions, but as the project evolved Reznor expanded Belew's involvement and shared writing credit with him on two tracks.|$|E
500|$|Fuming, Sinatra began what The Los Angeles Times {{describes}} as a [...] "weekend-long tirade" [...] against the [...] "hotel's management, employees and security forces". The FBI report says the incident began when Mia Farrow lost US$20,000 at the Sands casino. Sinatra bought US$50,000 in chips and made an attempt to win the money back. [...] He lost this sum within {{a short period of}} time. [...] Sinatra then asked for credit, which was denied. It culminated when Sinatra reportedly drove a golf cart through the window of the coffee shop where casino manager Carl Cohen was seated and began [...] "screaming obscenities and anti-Semitic remarks" [...] at Cohen. Sinatra reportedly punched Cohen, a heavily built man, who responded with a smack in the mouth, bloodying Sinatra's nose and knocking two of his teeth out. [...] As a result, Sinatra never performed at the Sands again while Hughes owned it, and began performing at Caesars Palace. A number of the staff were not disappointed to see Sinatra leave the Sands. Numerous employees had been humiliated or intimidated over the years, including a busboy Sinatra tripped while he was carrying a <b>tray</b> <b>with</b> dishes. After Sinatra left, the mobsters pulled out of the Sands and gradually left Vegas in the 1970s. [...] In the 1970s it became associated with the likes of Wayne Newton and Liberace. At this time some 30% of the performers at Sands were Italian Americans. Frank Gagliardi became the drummer for the house orchestra in 1964, starting a twelve-year tenure.|$|E

Six trays of 7 -day-old Batavia lettuce plants were used for the experiments. Two <b>trays</b> were watered <b>with</b> 200  mL of a suspension containing 5.5 [*]×[*] 106  cfu/mL (high inoculation level, H) E. coli O 157 :H− 431 / 97, two <b>trays</b> <b>with</b> 200  mL of a suspension containing 3.0 [*]×[*] 101 cfu/mL (low inoculation level, L) E. coli O 157 :H− 431 / 97, and two <b>trays</b> <b>with</b> 200  mL sterile 0.9 % (w/v) sodium chloride solution (negative control, N). The suspensions were applied to the soil surface using a sterile 20 -ml disposable plastic pipette, without contaminating the lettuce leaves.|$|R
