40|$|Retirement {{systems are}} {{increasingly}} {{asked to do}} an ever-better job of enhancing the performance of pension investments. The Singaporean Central Provident Fund permits pension system participants to keep their money in a government-run investment pool, or if they wish, they may select professionally managed unit <b>trusts</b> <b>for</b> their retirement <b>accumulations.</b> Opting <b>for</b> investment choice also exposes members to additional investment costs not charged by the government-managed account. This paper explores the charges levied by the private fund managers and we show that foreign ownership, active style of management and equity/balanced funds tend to be most expensive. We conclude {{with a discussion of}} policy options available to reduce retirement system costs...|$|R

50|$|In England and Wales, {{charitable}} trusts are {{a form of}} {{express trust}} dedicated to charitable goals. There {{are a variety of}} advantages to charitable trust status, including exemption from most forms of tax and freedom for the trustees not found in other types of English trust. To be a valid charitable trust, the organisation must demonstrate both a charitable purpose and a public benefit. Applicable charitable purposes are normally divided into four categories; <b>trusts</b> <b>for</b> the relief of poverty, <b>trusts</b> <b>for</b> the promotion of education, <b>trusts</b> <b>for</b> the promotion of religion and all other types of trust recognised by the law, which includes <b>trusts</b> <b>for</b> the benefit of animals and <b>trusts</b> <b>for</b> the benefit of a locality. There is also a requirement that the trust's purposes benefit the public (or some section of the public), and not simply a group of private individuals.|$|R
