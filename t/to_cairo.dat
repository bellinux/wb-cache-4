5|$|After {{the victory}} at Romani, Murray moved his {{headquarters}} back from Ismailia on the canal <b>to</b> <b>Cairo.</b> This move <b>to</b> <b>Cairo</b> was to {{enable him to}} be in a more central position to carry out his duties and responsibilities which extended from the Western Frontier Force, waging a continuing campaign against the Senussi in Egypt's Western Desert, to the Eastern Force in the Sinai. Another consequence of the victory was that Major General H. A. Lawrence, who had been in command of the Northern Sector of the Suez Canal defences and Romani during the battle, was transferred to the Western Front.|$|E

5|$|In 1940, Archibald Wavell called Clarke <b>to</b> <b>Cairo</b> {{and placed}} him in charge of {{strategic}} deception. As a cover, he was employed {{to set up a}} regional organisation for MI9, a British escape and evasion department. The following year Clarke received a war establishment and set up Advanced Headquarters 'A' Force with a small staff to plan deception operations. Once satisfied with the department's structure, he pursued intelligence contacts in Turkey and Spain. In late 1941 Clarke was called to London, where his deception work had come to the attention of Allied high command. Shortly afterward, while in Madrid, he was arrested wearing women's clothing, in circumstances that remain unclear. He was released and after being questioned by the governor of Gibraltar, allowed to return <b>to</b> <b>Cairo.</b>|$|E

5|$|After the {{evacuation}} of Gallipoli, Downes was appointed Assistant Director of Medical Services (ADMS) of the newly formed ANZAC Mounted Division on 15 March 1916. He was given the temporary rank of colonel, before substantive promotion on 20 February 1917. Downes combined this post with that of ADMS AIF Egypt from 6 September 1916. Downes therefore had to travel back and forth <b>to</b> <b>Cairo.</b> In November 1916, a Deputy ADMS was appointed to assist him.|$|E
5|$|Ahmad was in al-Karak at {{the time}} of Abu Bakr's {{execution}} and Qawsun called on him to report <b>to</b> <b>Cairo,</b> ostensibly to assume the sultanate. However, Ahmad viewed the invitation Cairo as a ruse by Qawsun to eliminate him. He responded in September 1341 that he would not report <b>to</b> <b>Cairo</b> unless the leading emirs of the sultanate appeared before him in al-Karak and gave him their oaths of loyalty and on the condition that his other brothers imprisoned in Qus would be relocated to al-Karak. Ahmad concurrently sent letters to the Mamluk emirs of Syria requesting their support against Qawsun, who proceeded to besiege al-Karak to coerce Ahmad to depart for Cairo. The siege was commanded by the Syrian emir, Qutlubugha al-Fakhri, while Ahmad had the support of al-Karak's inhabitants and the Bedouin tribes of the vicinity. Twenty days into his siege, Qutlubugha defected from Qawsun, recognized Ahmad as sultan and promised the latter his unconditional support. Qutlubugha was persuaded to defect from Qawsun by the Mamluk na'ib (governor) of Aleppo, Tashtamur. The latter argued that Qutlubugha should support Ahmad out of respect for the bonds of loyalty they owed to Ahmad's father, their master. From then on, Ahmad gained the honorific prefix of an-Nasir, like his father.|$|E
5|$|During the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, Arafat {{left the}} University and, {{along with other}} Arabs, sought to enter Palestine to join Arab forces {{fighting}} against Israeli troops {{and the creation of}} the state of Israel. However, instead of joining the ranks of the Palestinian fedayeen, Arafat fought alongside the Muslim Brotherhood, although he did not join the organization. He took part in combat in the Gaza area (which was the main battleground of Egyptian forces during the conflict). In early 1949, the war was winding down in Israel's favor, and Arafat returned <b>to</b> <b>Cairo</b> from a lack of logistical support.|$|E

5|$|However, {{during this}} time Inglis' {{relationship}} with his brigade commanders, particularly Brigadier Howard Kippenberger deteriorated. Kippenberger had become highly rated as a field commander {{during the war and}} Inglis may have become resentful. This was uncomfortable for Kippenberger, who had served under Inglis in the Territorial Force and considered him a mentor in the art of warfare. This was further exacerbated on 30 June when Inglis went <b>to</b> <b>Cairo</b> without informing his staff who, in his absence, subsequently asked Kippenberger to take temporary command of the division. Inglis returned on 1 July having become lost when returning from Cairo.|$|E
