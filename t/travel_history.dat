40|$|We {{compared}} <b>travel</b> <b>histories</b> of case-patients with Cryptococcus gattii infection during 1999 – 2006 {{to travel}} destinations {{of the general}} public on Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada.

Cryptococcus gattii is a fungus that infects the lungs and central nervous system of mostly immunocompetent humans and animals (1). In 1999, C. gattii emerged on the east coast of Vancouver Island (VI), British Columbia (BC), Canada (2), and is now considered endemic in the environment (3, 4), affecting human (5) and animal populations (6). <b>Travel</b> <b>histories</b> of patients have been used to monitor fungal spread (5) and to estimate the incubatio...|$|R

25|$|The {{bacterium}} {{is found}} naturally in fresh water. It can contaminate hot water tanks, hot tubs, and cooling towers of large air conditioners. It is usually spread by breathing in mist {{that contains the}} bacteria. It can also occur when contaminated water is aspirated. It typically does not spread directly between people and most people who are exposed do not become infected. Risk factors for infection include older age, history of smoking, chronic lung disease, and poor immune function. It is recommended that those with severe pneumonia and those with pneumonia and a recent <b>travel</b> <b>history</b> be tested for the disease. Diagnosis is by a urinary antigen test and sputum culture.|$|E

25|$|At CDC, a {{combination}} of tests with purified adult worm antigens is used for antibody detection. All serum specimens are tested by FAST-ELISA using S. mansoni adult microsomal antigen (MAMA). A positive reaction (greater than 9 units/µl serum) indicates infection with Schistosoma species. Sensitivity for S. mansoni infection is 99 percent, 95 percent for S. haematobium infection, and less than 50 percent for S. japonicum infection. Specificity of this assay for detecting schistosome infection is 99 percent. Because test sensitivity with the FAST-ELISA is reduced for species other than S. mansoni, immunoblots of the species appropriate to the patient's <b>travel</b> <b>history</b> are also tested to ensure detection of S. haematobium and S. japonicum infections. Immunoblots with adult worm microsomal antigens are species-specific and so a positive reaction indicates the infecting species. The presence of antibody is indicative only of schistosome infection at some time and cannot be correlated with clinical status, worm burden, egg production, or prognosis. Where a person has traveled can help determine what Schistosoma species to test for by immunoblot.|$|E
