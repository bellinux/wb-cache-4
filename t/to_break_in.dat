5|$|In March 1937, {{five months}} after the wreck, the hulk of Ohioan—still aground near Seal Rock—caught fire when a {{watchman}} aboard the ship attempted to burn some meat in a refrigerator. The flames died out before reaching the explosives that remained aboard the wreck. A Pacific storm in December the same year caused the hulk of Ohioan <b>to</b> <b>break</b> <b>in</b> two. By 1939, only remnants of some of Ohioans rusty steel beams were still visible on the rocks.|$|E
5|$|By 1944 it {{was fairly}} routine {{practice}} for Stavka to assign its operating fronts new and more ambitious missions while the Soviet Armed Forces were conducting major offensive operations. The rationale was that relentless pressure might trigger a German collapse. For the 1943/1944 winter campaign, Stalin ordered the Red Army to conduct major offensives along the entire Soviet-German front in {{a continuation of the}} 'Broad Front' strategy he had pursued {{since the beginning of the}} war. This was applied in consonance with his long-standing rationale that, if the Red Army applied pressure along the entire front, German defences were likely <b>to</b> <b>break</b> <b>in</b> at least one section. The Soviet winter campaign included major assaults across the entire expanse the front in the Ukraine, Belorussia and against the German Panther Line in the region of the Baltic Sea.|$|E
5|$|On May 9, 1987, {{improperly}} assembled bearings in Il-62M engine number 2 on LOT Polish Airlines Flight 5055 overheated {{and exploded}} during cruise over {{the village of}} Lipinki, causing the shaft <b>to</b> <b>break</b> <b>in</b> two; this caused the low-pressure turbine disc to spin to enormous speeds and disintegrate, damaging engine number 1 and cutting the control pushers. The crew managed to return to Warsaw, using nothing but trim tabs to control the crippled aircraft, but on the final approach, the trim controlling links burned and the crew completely lost control over the aircraft. Soon after, it crashed {{on the outskirts of}} Warsaw; all 183 on board perished. Had the plane stayed airborne for 40 seconds more, it {{would have been able to}} reach the runway.|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe {{analysis of a}} <b>break</b> <b>in</b> production is usually performed by a government negotiator or cost analyst. The more effectively {{they are able to}} estimate the loss of learning due <b>to</b> <b>breaks</b> <b>in</b> production, the more likely that the final contract will be fair and reasonable. The research of this study focused on identifying the factors which contribute to a loss of learning due <b>to</b> a <b>break</b> <b>in</b> production and the methods which are available to quantify these factors. The four methods identified were the George Anderlohr, the DCAA, the Pinchon and Richardson, and the Cubic Curve. These methods were then analyzed using the data from two aircraft, the Grumman C- 2 A and the Bell Helicopter Textron AH- 1 W, both of which experienced <b>breaks</b> <b>in</b> production. This study concludes that the George Anderlohr approach is the most effective method to evaluate the loss of learning due <b>to</b> a <b>break</b> <b>in</b> production.

While investigating the robbery, Scully is rendered unconscious and kidnapped by Schnauz. Mulder heads to the office where Schnauz's father used to work as a dentist, and finds the exam chair missing. Scully awakens bound to the chair with Schnauz claiming he's going to kill the howlers in her head. Schnauz takes a photo of himself, the result of which greatly disturb him, then prepares to lobotomize Scully. Mulder, having found a clue in a photo of Scully from the drugstore's photo booth, finds a trailer in a cemetery and realizes it belongs to Schnauz. He manages <b>to</b> <b>break</b> <b>in</b> and shoot Schnauz in the nick of time. Mulder looks at the photo Schnauz took of himself, in which he is lying dead on the floor.|$|E

Cardinal tells her that Krycek is headed to an abandoned missile silo in Black Crow, North Dakota. There, the agents are captured by the Smoking Man's men and are escorted away. Deep inside, Krycek sits atop the UFO and coughs out the black oil, which seeps into the ship. Skinner recovers and returns to work. Mulder sees Scully at Melissa's grave, explaining that Cardinal {{was found dead in}} his cell. Meanwhile, Krycek is trapped within the silo, banging on the door in an attempt to be let out.|$|E

He tunnels underground to reach the house while Foaly feeds a loop to the manor surveillance system, allowing Mulch to freely explore. Mulch accidentally locates a safe containing Artemis' copy of the Book, finally revealing to the fairies the source of Artemis' knowledge, which he had led them to believe he had acquired from a truth serum administered to Holly. The Fairy Council, deciding that nothing is working, promotes a lieutenant called Briar Cudgeon to Acting Commander, temporarily usurping Julius Root. Meanwhile, Holly Short cracks through the concrete of her cell, finding fresh dirt, and completes the ritual with a smuggled acorn. Having regained her magic, she escapes into the main house.|$|E

After ascertaining Tim’s password, Veronica {{finds out}} that Tim is also {{investigating}} the Dean’s suicide {{and that he was}} browsing a site named “Neptune Women’s Clinic”. Veronica visits the ministry of Bonnie’s father, Ted (Chris Ellis) as well as the clinic, although neither really help in the case. She also questions Anthony, one of the witnesses of the Dean’s death (he heard the gunshot). Returning home, Veronica is greeted by Keith, who has received a letter with images of Veronica exiting the clinic. For revenge, they visit the publisher of the photos, but it doesn’t go well. Nevertheless, she does see a picture of one of Dick’s paramours, although she was not as intimate with him as Veronica thought. In the middle of the night, Mindy O’Dell (Jaime Ray Newman) contact Keith, telling him to hurry. It turns out that Steve Botando (Richard Grieco) was trying <b>to</b> <b>break</b> <b>in,</b> and while he is there, Keith {{finds out that}} Cyrus was planning on sending the O’Dell son to a disciplinary school and that Mindy was at the scene of Dean O’Dell’s death.|$|E

Neville, Anna, and Ethan retreat into the basement laboratory, sealing themselves in with the female Darkseeker on which Neville has been experimenting. Discovering that the last treatment was successful, Neville tries to assess the situation as the alpha male deliberately rams himself against a glass door <b>to</b> <b>break</b> <b>in.</b> Neville draws a vial of blood from the woman he cured and gives it to Anna, before shutting her and Ethan inside a coal chute {{in the back of}} the lab. He then takes a grenade and kills the Darkseekers at the cost of his own life, saving the cure. The next day, before dusk, Anna and Ethan discover that her theory is right as they arrive at the survivors camp in Vermont. They are greeted by some military officers and other survivors and Anna is shown handing the cure to a man.|$|E
5|$|No.82 Wing's Liberators played both a {{tactical}} and a strategic {{role in the}} Borneo Campaign, beginning with the lead-up to Operation Oboe One, the invasion of Tarakan on 1May 1945. During that month a detachment relocated from Fenton to Morotai, attacking targets in Celebes and Balikpapan prior to Operation Oboe Six, the invasion of Labuan. In June, while the final Allied offensive of the Borneo Campaign got under way as Operation Oboe Two, the Battle of Balikpapan, the remainder of No.82 Wing transferred from NWA to the command of the Australian First Tactical Air Force in Morotai. In {{the middle of the}} month the wing dropped 120 tons of bombs on Balikpapan's oil fields and surrounding areas, as well as coastal defence sites. During July it bombed targets at Celebes and Borneo, losing five Liberators for the month, including that of its new commanding officer, Group Captain Donald McLean. McLean died with most of his crew after being hit by anti-aircraft fire and ditching into the sea, a notoriously risky operation in the Liberator owing to the fuselage's tendency <b>to</b> <b>break</b> <b>in</b> two upon striking the water.|$|E

After the pair reveal what led them to crossing paths with each other, they decide to continue searching the theatre, looking for the source of the energy Bruno detected. In the process, they find two keys - one in a safe, which is made of stone and decorated with crystals, and was the energy source Bruno detected, while the other, a stone, is found in a weird chamber, within a column of energy, bearing an omega symbol on it. Heading outside, after escaping from Susarro and Petra (who had been dealing with a mysterious, hooded man), George is tazed by an unknown assailant, who takes the strange energy key from him.|$|E
