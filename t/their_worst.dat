5|$|In early March, Camacho {{resigned}} {{after three}} consecutive league draws, citing {{his inability to}} motivate the club. His assistant Fernando Chalana then took over, but Benfica continued to disappoint; they were eliminated in the UEFA Cup and mired in second place in mid-March. In April, the situation deteriorated further; Benfica matched <b>their</b> <b>worst</b> league defeat in 60 years, slipped to fourth place and was knocked out of the Portuguese Cup by Sporting CP. An away draw in May's opening game left the club dangerously close to finishing fourth. One week later, fans had the bitter-sweet experience of celebrating Rui Costa's final match and seeing Benfica finish fourth, <b>their</b> <b>worst</b> finish since 2001–02.|$|E

Despite making <b>their</b> <b>worst</b> start to a league campaign since the 1989–90 season, the team finished five points clear of second-placed Arsenal, the pre-season favourites.

5|$|That {{part of the}} {{restoration}} in the Sistine Chapel which has caused the most concern is the ceiling, painted by Michelangelo. The emergence of the brightly coloured Ancestors of Christ from the gloom sparked a reaction of fear that the processes being employed in the cleaning were too severe. Despite warnings, {{the work on the}} ceiling proceeded and, according to critics such as James Beck, <b>their</b> <b>worst</b> fears were confirmed once the ceiling was completed.|$|E
5|$|The Sooner defense played {{extremely}} well in Waco, limiting Baylor to 148total yards and -48yards of rushing.

Defensive back Reggie Smith also pulled down two interceptions, returning the first one 42yards for a touchdown.|$|E

Despite the aforementioned favorable incident, the Zoroastrians during the Qajar dynasty remained in agony and their population continued to decline. Even during the rule of Agha Mohammad Khan, the founder of the dynasty, many Zoroastrians were killed and some were taken as captives to Azerbaijan. Zoroastrians regard the Qajar period as one of <b>their</b> <b>worst.</b>|$|E
