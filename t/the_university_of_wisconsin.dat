5|$|<b>The</b> <b>University</b> <b>of</b> <b>Wisconsin</b> {{faculty and}} regents voted {{to end the}} Experimental College in May 1932. There was a {{farewell}} banquet for 250 guests in June 1932. Meiklejohn did not judge the college's success by its permanence, {{which he did not}} expect—he said he attempted the college as a test. Meiklejohn asked Sellery to give his graduate student advisers university assistantships, but was denied. Meiklejohn began to work on adult education in <b>the</b> <b>University</b> <b>of</b> <b>Wisconsin</b> Extension Division in July 1932, where some of the Experimental College's ideas took hold. He later moved to Berkeley. Advisers who stayed after the program's end—such as classicist Walter Agard, philosopher Carl Bögholt, and political scientist John Gaus—were known as popular and innovative, and Agard became the Classics department chair.|$|E

5|$|Joss {{was born}} and raised in Wisconsin, where he {{attended}} St. Mary's College (now part of Wyalusing Academy) in Prairie du Chien and <b>the</b> <b>University</b> <b>of</b> <b>Wisconsin.</b> He played baseball at St. Mary's and then played in a semipro league where he caught the attention of Connie Mack. Joss did not sign with Mack's team, but he attracted further major league interest after winning 19 games in 1900 for the Toledo Mud Hens. Joss had another strong season for Toledo in 1901.|$|E

However she died unexpectedly in 1937, leaving Wigner distraught. He therefore accepted a 1938 offer from Princeton to return there. Wigner became a naturalized citizen of the United States on January 8, 1937, and he brought his parents to the United States.|$|E

5|$|Similar {{to video}} fluoroscopy, X-ray {{microbeam}} studies use radiation to study movements of articulators. Gold pellets, 2 to 3mm in size, {{are placed in}} and around the mouth similar to the coils used in EMA. Radiation exposure is limited by using computer software to focus narrow x-ray beams, about 6mm2, on the pellets and track them as they move. Like EMA, x-ray microbeam studies are limited by the placement of the pellets. While able to minimize radiation exposure, the system is largely inaccessible as it is unique to <b>the</b> <b>University</b> <b>of</b> <b>Wisconsin.</b>|$|E
5|$|Having {{personal}} experience with worker safety concerns, Lynch found himself with aspirations beyond his trade. When a 1979 blizzard forced his project in Wisconsin to shut down, he spent the extra time taking courses at <b>the</b> <b>University</b> <b>of</b> <b>Wisconsin.</b> Shortly thereafter, his father was diagnosed with cancer, and so Lynch returned to Boston. In the early 1980s Lynch {{was elected to the}} executive board of the Iron Workers Local 7 union. At age 30 he was elected president of the board, the youngest in the local's history. During this time he spent his nights and weekends attending the Wentworth Institute of Technology, from which he graduated cum laude with a bachelor's degree in construction management in 1988.|$|E
5|$|I was {{as student}} in the sixties, engaged {{in the civil rights}} movement, anti-Vietnam War protests. I'd come from New York to attend <b>the</b> <b>University</b> <b>of</b> <b>Wisconsin.</b> It was an {{exciting}} time. A lot of active students wound up in different cities and communities as organizers. I chose Racine, Wisconsin. I spent three years there. We had developed a legal clinic and we had a whole health program, but the city was too small. I had, of course, heard about Uptown in Chicago, and the challenges. So I wound up here in 1976. I waited tables. I did photography, took pictures for attorneys. Ultimately we started our own print shop in order to print our own newspapers and magazines.|$|E

5|$|Minton did {{not realize}} that Frank was also {{president}} of <b>the</b> <b>University</b> <b>of</b> <b>Wisconsin,</b> and soon suffered retaliation for the way he had treated Frank. Frank went on NBC radio stations around the country and lambasted Minton for his rudeness. He made lengthy arguments accusing Minton of attempting to violate the Bill of Rights. Minton was outraged, but the arguments had an effect among voters in Indiana. In 1938, he sought funding to launch a massive nationwide investigation of media conglomerates for proof of Republican interference in the press. Democratic Senator Edward R. Burke led an effort to defeat the measure and privately accused Minton of damaging the Democrats' cause, which led Minton to leave the Lobby Investigation Committee.|$|E
5|$|The Steelers' first {{selection}} in the inaugural NFL draft was William Shakespeare, a halfback from Notre Dame.

5|$|Addie Joss {{was born}} in Woodland, Dodge County, Wisconsin. His parents Jacob and Theresa (née Staudenmeyer) worked as farmers; his father, a cheesemaker who was {{involved}} in local politics, had emigrated from Switzerland. A heavy drinker of alcohol, he died from liver complications in 1890, when Joss was 10 years old; Joss remained sober throughout his life {{as a result of his}} father's death. Joss attended elementary school in Juneau and Portage and high school at Wayland Academy in Beaver Dam, Wisconsin. By age 16 he finished high school and began teaching himself. He was offered a scholarship to attend St. Mary's College (also known as Sacred Heart College) in Watertown, where he played on the school's baseball team. He also attended <b>the</b> <b>University</b> <b>of</b> <b>Wisconsin</b> (now University of Wisconsin-Madison), where he studied engineering. Officials in Watertown were impressed with the quality of play of St. Mary's and put the team on a semipro circuit. During his time on the semipro circuit, Joss employed his unique pitching windup, which involved hiding the ball until the very last moment in his delivery.|$|E

5|$|Although the eye feature became {{obscured}} and banding features {{appeared to}} be dissipating six hours after becoming a hurricane, the NHC predicted rapid intensification. As the eye became visible on satellite imagery early on August23, winds increased to 100mph (155km/h), and Fausto became a Category 2 hurricane. Although the convective cloud tops had warmed slightly late that day, wind speeds continued to increase, and intensity estimates made at <b>the</b> <b>University</b> <b>of</b> <b>Wisconsin</b> were as high as 145mph (230km/h), though the National Hurricane Center was in agreement with estimates from all three Dvorak Technique agencies (the Tropical Analysis and Forecast Branch (TAFB), the Satellite Analysis Branch (SAB), and the Air Force Weather Agency (AFWA)), which estimated winds at 115mph (185km/h). Based on this, Hurricane Fausto had intensified into a Category3 on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} 18, Morenz {{became an}} {{apprentice}} with the Canadian National Railways (CNR) factory in Stratford. When not playing hockey, Morenz bet avidly on horse races and played the ukulele. In 1926 he married Mary McKay; together, they had three children: Howie Jr. in 1927 (d. 2015), Donald in 1933 (died 1939), and Marlene in 1934. Marlene later married Bernie Geoffrion, who played for both the Canadiens and Rangers from 1950 to 1968. Their son, Morenz's grandson Dan, played for the Canadiens in 1979-80. Dan's son, Blake, played with <b>the</b> <b>University</b> <b>of</b> <b>Wisconsin</b> and won the Hobey Baker Award as best collegiate player in 2010. Selected in the 2006 NHL Entry Draft by the Nashville Predators, he made his debut with the Predators in 2011, becoming the first fourth-generation NHL player. Blake was traded to Montreal in 2012, meaning that all four generations of the Morenz-Geoffrion family have played within the Canadiens organization.|$|E
5|$|Elda Emma Anderson {{was born}} in Green Lake, Wisconsin, on October 5, 1899, to Edwin A. Anderson (born in Wisconsin) and his wife, Lena (née Heller) (born in Germany). Anderson {{was one of three}} children. Although she was captivated by numbers at an early age, Anderson {{actually}} sought to become a kindergarten teacher. This would shift to an interest in science later, partially due to the influence of her older sister, who was an assistant chemistry instructor. As a whole, although her family had certain lofty expectations for their younger daughter, they all supported her in her academic endeavors. Anderson earned a Bachelor of Arts (AB) degree from Ripon College in 1922, then a master of arts (AM) in physics from <b>the</b> <b>University</b> <b>of</b> <b>Wisconsin</b> in 1924. From 1924 to 1927, she taught at Estherville Junior College in Iowa, where she was the dean of physics, chemistry and mathematics.
