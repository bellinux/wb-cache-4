40|$|Several {{wildlife}} sanctuaries in {{the world}} are home to the surviving populations of many endemic species. Trishna wildlife sanctuary in northeast India is protected by law, and is home to the last surviving populations of Asian bison (Bos gorus Smith), spectacle monkey (Trachypithecus phayrie Blyth), capped langur (<b>Trachypithecus</b> <b>pileatus</b> Blyth), slow loris (Nycticebus coucang Boddaert), wild cat (Felis chaus Schreber), and wild boars (Sus scrofa L.), among many other animals and plants. The sanctuary was explored for species richness and diversity of butterflies. A six-month-long study revealed the occurrence of 59 butterfly species that included 21 unique species and 9 species listed in the threatened category. The mixed moist deciduous mature forest of the sanctuary harbored greater species richness and species diversity (39 species under 31 gen-era) than other parts of the sanctuary, which is comprised of regenerated secondary mixed deciduous forest (37 species under 32 genera), degraded forests (32 species under 28 genera), and open grassland with patches of plantations and artificial lakes (24 species under 17 genera).

40|$|The {{golden langur}} (Trachypithecus geei) is an {{endangered}} endemic species of primate in Bhutan. Conservation {{of this species}} is addressed here through phylogeographic and habitat management tools. I hypothesize that rivers and mountains in Bhutan isolated a population of capped langurs (<b>Trachypithecus</b> <b>pileatus)</b> and that this population later speciated into the morphologically distinct golden langur. Trachypithecus, the genus to which both capped and golden langurs belong, spread north from a paleo-refuge in south China and Semnopithecus (grey langurs) spread east and northward from a refuge in south India. My results show that these two genera both arrived in Bhutan but could not mix since the Sunkosh River and Pelela range form a biogeographic barrier. Likewise, a population of capped langurs isolated from parental populations by rivers speciated into the distinct golden langur. I conducted field surveys covering {{the entire range of}} langurs in Bhutan, confirming the distribution and isolating barriers among the three langurs. Grey langurs and golden langurs are isolated from each other by the Sunkosh River and Black Mountain range in west Bhutan. In the east, the Manas river system (Manas-Mangde-Chamkhar) served as a barrier between golden and capped langurs. However, this barrier has been broken in the last 30 years due to the construction of bridges over the Chamkhar river. A hybrid zone was found and the implications are discussed. A cyt b phylogeny showed the grey langur of Bhutan grouping into a distinct clade with other congenerics of Semnopithecus. The south-Indian clade of grey langurs is more ancient, with the Bhutan and Nepal grey langurs having diverged later. The golden and capped langur from Bhutan grouped with Trachypithecus from South East Asia. Finally, I explore conservation of golden langur habitat in Bhutan and estimate available habitat at 3, 089 km 2 and an estimated population of about 6, 000 individuals. I also find that the most viable strategy for conservation of langur habitat is to give ownership of the forests to local people, with monitoring by the Department of Forestry...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Co-infections of {{multiple}} parasite species in hosts {{may lead to}} interspecific associations and subsequently shape {{the structure of a}} parasite community. However, few studies have focused on these associations in highly abundant parasite species or, in particular, investigated how the associations develop with time in hosts exposed to co-infecting parasite species for the first time. We investigated metacercarial establishment and interspecific associations in the trematodes Ichthyocotylurus variegatus and <b>I.</b> <b>pileatus</b> co-infecting three age cohorts of young perch (Perca fluviatilis). Results We found that the timing of transmission of the two Ichthyocotylurus species was very similar, but they showed differences in metacercarial development essentially so that the metacercariae of <b>I.</b> <b>pileatus</b> became encapsulated faster. Correlations between the abundances of the species were significantly positive after the first summer of host life and also within the main site of infection, the swim bladder. High or low abundances of both parasite species were also more frequent in the same host individuals than expected by chance, independently of host age or size. However, the highest abundances of the species were nevertheless observed in different host individuals and this pattern was consistent in all age cohorts. Conclusions The results suggest similar temporal patterns of transmission, non-random establishment, and facilitative rather than competitive associations between the parasite species independently of the age of the infracommunities. However, we suggest that spatial differences in exposure are most likely responsible for the segregation of the parasite species observed in the few most heavily infected hosts. Regardless of the underlying mechanism, the result suggests that between-species associations should be interpreted with caution along with detailed examination of the parasite distribution among host individuals. </p...|$|R
40|$|AbstractSimian foamy viruses (SFVs) {{belong to}} a genetically and antigenically diverse class of retroviruses that {{naturally}} infect {{a wide range of}} nonhuman primates (NHPs) and can also be transmitted to humans occupationally exposed to NHPs. Current serologic detection of SFV infection requires separate Western blot (WB) testing by using two different SFV antigens [SFVAGM (African green monkey) and SFVCPZ (chimpanzee) ]. However, this method is labor intensive and validation is limited to only small numbers of NHPs. To facilitate serologic SFV testing, we developed a WB assay that combines antigens from both SFVAGM and SFVCPZ. The combined-antigen WB (CA-WB) assay was validated with 145 serum samples from 129 NHPs (32 African and Asian species) and 16 humans, all with known SFV infection status determined by PCR. Concordant CA-WB results were obtained for all 145 PCR-positive or -negative primate and human specimens, giving the assay a 100 % sensitivity and specificity. In addition, no reactivity was observed in sera from persons positive for human immunodeficiency virus or human T cell lymphotropic virus (HIV/HTLV) (n = 25) or HIV/HTLV-negative U. S. blood donors (n = 100). Using the CA-WB assay, we screened 360 sera from 43 Old World primate species and found an SFV prevalence of about 68 % in both African and Asian primates. We also isolated SFV from the blood of four seropositive primates (Allenopithecus nigroviridis, <b>Trachypithecus</b> françoisi, Hylobates <b>pileatus,</b> and H. leucogenys) not previously known to be infected with SFV. Phylogenetic analysis of integrase sequences from these isolates confirmed that all four SFVs represent new, distinct, and highly divergent lineages. These results demonstrate the ability of the CA-WB assay to detect infection in a large number of NHP species, including previously uncharacterized infections with divergent SFVs...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2016 - 08 University of Washington Abstract Pileated Woodpecker Occupancy and the Occurrence and Recruitment of Key Habitat Attributes in a Managed Forest Amber Mount Chair of Supervisory Committee: PhD John M. Marzluff School of Environmental and Forest Sciences As {{anthropogenic}} {{land use}} accelerates, {{it is critical}} that resource managers evaluate and address the needs of wildlife species. Managed forests have a unique opportunity to provide economic stability in communities while maintaining habitat for forest associated species. Forest management prescriptions include leaving areas of undisturbed mature trees to provide habitat for wildlife. It is essential, yet not often done, to both evaluate the habitat that is left as well as monitor the species that are meant to benefit from this habitat. My thesis aims to fill this gap on a private forest in Western Washington by assessing the occurrence and recruitment of standing dead trees (snags) and a species dependent upon this resource, the pileated woodpecker (Dryocopus <b>pileatus).</b> <b>I</b> estimated the density of snags across Green Diamond Resource Company’s (GDRCo) Olympic Tree Farm that operates under a Habitat Conservation Plan (HCP). The HCP has a requirement to retain 4. 9 snags per hectare (SPH) > 61 cm Diameter at Breast Height (DBH) and 4. 9 SPH 30 - 61 cm DBH to provide habitat for cavity nesting birds. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine if the goals are currently being met and if the forest is on a trajectory to meet those goals throughout the life of the HCP (50 years). I found that the goals for small snags are being met and the goals for large snags are not being met. Net recruitment of snags for both size classes was positive. If these recruitment rates remain the same, snags will increase over time and the goal for large snags will be reached in fifteen years, at year 30 of the HCP. I also surveyed for pileated woodpeckers on the managed tree farm and modeled its detection and occupancy using PRESENCE ([URL] I estimated that woodpeckers occupied 27. 5 % of survey locations, which is surprising for a species initially thought to be an obligate of expansive mature forests. The models that performed best included the amount of forest aged 30 - 45 within 277 ha of a survey location, which was negatively correlated with occupancy and the amount of mature forest within 277 ha, which was positively correlated with occupancy. With a one percent increase in forest aged 30 - 45 within the 277 ha home range, I found a 10. 25 % decrease in the likelihood of a site being occupied by pileated woodpeckers. With a one percent increase in mature forest in the 277 ha home range, I found a 3. 68 % increase in the chance of the site being occupied by pileated woodpeckers. My findings suggest that mature forest reserves are necessary for maintaining pileated woodpecker habitat. Mature forest reserves will become increasingly important as intensively managed forests move to a younger rotation age...|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} {{concerned}} with two strigeid genera which utilise fish as their second intermediate host and piscivorous birds as a definitive host, i. e. Apatemon (Apatemon) Sudarikov, 1959 and Ichthyocotylurus Odening, 1969. Although the lifecycle has been ascertained for most Ichthyocotylurus spp., confusion and disagreement still exist as to the constituent species, while all of the life-stages have been described for only a single member of the subgenus Apatemon (Apatemon). In order to clarify species membership to these taxa and indeed the taxonomic position of the subgenus Apatemon (Apatemon) further information was required on the life-cycles and life-stages of these strigeids. Although, metacercariae from this family have been recorded {{from a variety of}} British fishes, confirmed records, i. e. those supported with life-cycle data, are limited to a single species. It was this lack of confidence in identifying metacercariae recovered from fishes and the lack of known good criteria for distinguishing the adults that prompted the present study. Collections of metacercariae from a variety of hosts and locations were made, from which all subsequent life-cycle stages were obtained. The project aims were to establish the identity of the forms occurring in British fishes, by applying discriminatory techniques to the experimentally reared life-stages. In addition to traditional methods, techniques with little previous application to these genera were used and included, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), chaetotaxy, principal components analysis (PCA), and karyology. Furthermore, behavioural aspects such as the release patterns of cercariae from their molluscan hosts were studied to investigate whether they would prove to be of diagnostic value. Metacercariae obtained from the sampling survey were tentatively identified, using all currently employed methods for their determination, i. e. morphology, nature of cyst, host and site specificities, as Ichthyocotylurus erraticus (Rudolphi, 1809), I. variegatus (Creplin, 1825), Apatemon gracilis (Rudolphi, 1819) and A. annuligerum (Nordmann, 1832). Material collected from Finland was considered to contain both Ichthyocotylurus spp. recovered in the U. K., as well as I. platycephalus (Creplin, 1825) and <b>I.</b> <b>pileatus</b> (Rudolphi, 1802). The Ichthyocotylurus spp. were found to be more host specific than A. gracilis, although A. annuligerum was considered oioxenic to perch Perea fluiatilis L. Records of I. erraticus from gwyniad Coregonus lavaretus (L.) and grayling Thymallus thymallus (L.), and A. gracilis from arctic charr Salvelinus alpinus (L.) constitute first listings from Britain. The large number of sensilla present on the body surface of these metacercariae, observed by SEM and chaetotaxy, precluded their diagnostic use. PCA was, however, found to be of value for distinguishing between species and determining morphological variation within a species. I. erraticus, I. variegatus and A. gracilis adults were successfully reared in experimental hosts using metacercariae from a variety of fish hosts, sites within a single fish host and geographical sites. The adults obtained enabled clarification of the identities assigned to the metacercariae. Those metacercariae believed to represent <b>I.</b> <b>pileatus</b> and A. annuligerum failed to establish in experimental hosts. Herring gulls and lesser black-backed gulls proved to be extremely good experimental hosts for both Ichthyocotylurus spp., with the vast majority of infections establishing and providing high yields of eggs and adults. These infections yielded information on the establishment, development, fecundity, site specificity, longevity and morphological variability of the adults. Aspects of the morphology and biology of I. variegatus adults recorded were found to support its validity as a species discrete from I. platycephalus which was in some doubt. The experimental hosts used for A. gracilis infections, domestic and mallard ducklings, were found to be less satisfactory. Challenges were performed with A. gracilis metacercariae from three sources, rainbow trout, salmon parr and stone loach. The latter source was the only one to result in egg producing adults, with specimens exhibiting normal morphology and demonstrating an increased longevity over adults raised from salmonid metacercariae. These findings suggest that the metacercarial host may affect the successful completion of the life-cycle. Eggs of known origin were collected for all three cultured strigeid species, enabling further life-cycle studies, these were incubated and miracidia successfully raised. Developmental periods were found to be temperature dependent and differed for the three species at 20 °C: A. gracilis < I. erraticus < I. variegatus. Light microscopy revealed the morphology of all three species to be identical, as were the epidermal plate formulae and chaetotaxy, indicated by silver-staining. The nomenclature for the distribution of miracidial sensilla derived by Dimitrov et al. (1989) was amended to enable a full description of these species. Osmotic shock resulted in an improved deciliation of the miracidia compared to sonication and subsequent SEM observation confirmed the arrangement of body surface structures, while revealing sensilla forms. Behavioural aspects of I. variegatus miracidia were examined, with a maximum longevity (< 11 hours) recorded at the lowest temperature studied (l 0 degrees C), and host finding demonstrated to occur by an increased turning response in the presence of substances emitted from the susceptible snail host, following an initial unresponsive dispersal phase. Ichthyocotylurus cercariae were found in naturally infected Valvata piscinalis which constitutes the first record in Britain of cercariae of this genus. Cercariae of I. erraticus and I. variegatus were successfully raised experimentally from miracidia of known identity and origin within naive, experimentally raised V. piscinalis hosts, while A. gracilis cercariae were obtained from laboratory reared Lymnaea peregra. Cercarial developmental periods within the molluscan host were found to be temperature dependent and markedly different for the strigeid genera investigated, as were their behaviour and morphology. The Ichthyocotylurus spp. exhibit a distinct diurnal emergence rhythm from their molluscan host, being shed during the hours of daylight, while A. gracilis cercariae demonstrate a reciprocal pattern, emerging during the hours of darkness. Behavioural contrasts were also observed in longevities, emergence strategies (route of exit) and swimming behaviour. The two Ichthyocotylurus spp. were extremely similar, the only cercarial features found to be of diagnostic use were: {{the presence or absence of}} eye-spots; their differing developmental periods from miracidium to cercaria; the number and distribution of sensilla when compared by PCA; and their differing longevities at 20 degrees C. Characters considered to be of value in differentiating between strigeid cercariae at the species level, including the armature, chaetotaxy pattern and resting posture, did not differ between these two species. SEM observations enabled descriptions of the variety and structure of sensilla present on different life-stages, while transmission electron microscopy revealed the internal structure of cercarial sensory structures. Experimentally raised cercariae were found to be infective and the life-cycle was completed for the three strigeid species. Host specificities were observed for I. erraticus and A. gracilis, being particularly stringent for the latter species, while site specificities recorded were as observed in natural infections. Metacercarial maturation periods (for encystment) were highly temperature dependent, being comparable for the two Ichthyocotylurus spp. and more rapid than for A. gracilis specimens. Karyological studies were performed on the cercariae-releasing parthenitae of I. erraticus, I. variegatus and A. gracilis, the identity of which was confirmed through lifecycle studies. The chromosome number and morphology for the three species was described and enabled the ready discrimination of I. erraticus and I. variegatus cercariae which had proved to be problematical using comparisons of gross morphology. The strigeids described here and from all other sources have been found to possess 20 chromosomes in diploid sets. Behavioural and developmental characteristics were found to be of taxonomic value for the separation of morphologically similar species at all life-stages. The fine surface structures of the strigeids investigated using SEM and chaetotaxy revealed many similarities at the species level, but provided evidence for their use in the separation of higher taxa. All comparisons of morphology were enhanced by the ability of PCA to discern subtle variation while karyological investigations provided precise species determinations. The two latter techniques in particular may greatly aid systematicians investigating taxonomic problems within other digenean families...|$|R
