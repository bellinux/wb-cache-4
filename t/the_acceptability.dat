Social acceptability of products and services was estimated based on the importance levels of secondary requirements obtained from survey results and the characteristics evaluation of secondary requirements with physical/engineering viewpoints. Our new assumption is that <b>the</b> social <b>acceptability</b> of products/services consists of subjective/psychological acceptability as well as physical/engineering acceptability. We estimated social <b>acceptability</b> quantitatively using <b>the</b> same methodology as suggested last year but took subjective/psychological acceptability in consideration. In the case where the calculated values were close to that of directly asked values, suggesting that <b>the</b> subjective/psychological <b>acceptability</b> was negligent in comparison with <b>the</b> physical/engineering <b>acceptability,</b> <b>the</b> social <b>acceptability</b> was determined by physical/engineering aspects.

500|$|The graphic {{depiction}} {{of violence in}} The Last of Us generated substantial commentary from critics. Engadget writer Ben Gilbert found the game's persistent focus on combat was [...] "a necessary evil to lead the game's fragile protagonist duo to safety", {{as opposed to being}} used as a method to achieve objectives. Kotakus Kirk Hamilton wrote that the violence was [...] "heavy, consequential and necessary", as opposed to gratuitous. USGamer's Anthony John Agnello wrote that the game consistently reinforces the negativity associated with violence, intentionally making players feel uncomfortable while in violent combat. He stated that the deaths within the game were not unnecessary or unjustified, making the story more powerful. Kelly of Computer and Video Games stated that, despite the [...] "incredibly brutal" [...] combat, the violence never felt gratuitous. Eurogamers Welsh echoed similar remarks, stating that the violence is not [...] "desensitized or mindless". Matt Helgeson of Game Informer observed that the game's violence leads to players questioning the morality of their choices. Joystiq's Mitchell wrote that the violence is [...] "designed to be uncomfortable", stating that it contributes to Joel's character. Prior to the release of the game, Keith Stuart of The Guardian wrote that <b>the</b> <b>acceptability</b> of the violence would depend on its context within the game.|$|E
