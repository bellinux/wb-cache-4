Dean began ordering elements of the division, including much of his headquarters, to retreat via train to Taegu, although he remained behind. By this time, several M24 Chaffee light tanks {{had been sent to}} reinforce the division from A Company of the 78th Tank Battalion. Regardless of the additional tanks, on 20 July, North Korean armored units pushed American forces back from Taejon Airfield, several miles northwest of Taejon, overwhelming the last American units defending the Kum River and forcing the remnants of the division into Taejon itself.

When Ottoman rule was firmly reestablished in 1841, Nablus prospered as a center of trade.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} years of the republic, Istanbul was {{overlooked}} in favor of Ankara, selected as Turkey's capital to distance the new, secular country from its Ottoman history. From the late 1940s and early 1950s, Istanbul underwent great structural change, as new public squares, boulevards, and avenues were constructed throughout the city, sometimes at the expense of historical buildings. The population of Istanbul began to rapidly increase in the 1970s, as people from Anatolia migrated <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> <b>to</b> find employment in the many new factories that were built on the outskirts of the sprawling metropolis. This sudden, sharp rise in the city's population caused a large demand for housing, and many previously outlying villages and forests became engulfed into the metropolitan area of Istanbul.|$|E
5|$|Lepanto {{was removed}} from front-line service in 1902 and {{converted}} into a gunnery training ship; to aid in this task, the ship received a variety of light weapons that trainees {{would go on to}} use in the fleet. Italia was modernized in 190508, losing two of her funnels and several of her small-caliber guns; from 1909 to 1910, she served as a torpedo training ship. Both ships were reactivated in September 1911 after the outbreak of the Italo-Turkish War, initially assigned to the 5th Division. After the capture of Tripoli in October, Italia and Lepanto were sent <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> <b>to</b> provide gunfire support for the soldiers defending it. Lepanto was stricken from the naval register on 26 May 1912, before the war ended, but she was reinstated on 13 January 1913 as an auxiliary. She did not remain in service long, being stricken again on 27 March 1915 and broken up for scrap.|$|E
5|$|Pennsylvania, {{which had}} {{abolished}} slavery in 1780, required any slaves brought <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> <b>to</b> be freed after six months' residency.

Through 1796, 500 slaves from Saint-Domingue gained {{freedom in the}} city. Because of the violence accompanying the revolution on the island, Philadelphians, {{many of whom had}} southern ties, and residents of the Upper South worried that free people of color would encourage slave insurrections in the U.S.|$|E
