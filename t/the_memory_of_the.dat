Later on Tsar Samuil moved the capital from Preslav in the northeast to Ohrid in the southwest. <b>The</b> <b>memory</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> great victory over Basil II was preserved thirty years later in the Bitola inscription of Ivan Vladislav (1015–1018), the son of Aron.|$|E
5|$|In the Holy Roman and Byzantine empires, {{imperial}} purple was a colour {{reserved for}} emperors, kings and bishops, and purple parchment was rarely used for writing. This document {{is regarded as}} one of the most luxurious and beautiful examples of the use of purple parchment. In 2005, the document was proposed for inclusion in <b>the</b> <b>Memory</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> World Register, but was not included.|$|E
50|$|Taylor once commented in an {{interview}} that he was sick <b>of</b> acting out <b>the</b> nostalgic reminiscences <b>of</b> other people. He has done this in a number <b>of</b> films including <b>The</b> Nostradamus Kid, which was based, apparently, on <b>the</b> <b>memories</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Australian author Bob Ellis, a young David Helfgott in Shine, the protagonist in John Birmingham's memoir He Died with a Felafel in His Hand, and Almost Famous, based on <b>the</b> <b>memories</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> film's writer and director, Cameron Crowe.|$|R

5|$|It {{appears that}} the victory of Michael III over the Rus' was invented by the Byzantine historians in the mid-9th century or later and became {{generally}} accepted in the Slavic chronicles influenced by them. However, <b>the</b> <b>memory</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> successful campaign was transmitted orally among the Kievans and may have dictated Nestor's account of Oleg's 907 campaign, which is not recorded in Byzantine sources at all.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the site}} was founded to honour <b>the</b> <b>memory</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Newfoundland Regiment, it also {{contains}} a number of memorials as well as four cemeteries maintained by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission; that of Y Ravine Cemetery, Hawthorn Ridge Cemeteries No. 1 and No. 2 and the unusual mass burial site of Hunter's Cemetery. Beyond being a popular location for battlefield tours the site {{is also an important}} location in the burgeoning field of First World War battlefield archaeology, because of its preserved and largely undisturbed state. The ever-increasing number of visitors to the Memorial has resulted in the authorities taking measures to control access by fencing off certain areas of the former battlefield.|$|E

Inspired by actual events, the bittersweet tale will take viewers on a journey through childhood memories and associations, theirs and mine. Part documentary, part interactive memoir the project will create a narrative thread using <b>the</b> <b>memories</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> protagonists juxtaposed with <b>the</b> <b>memories</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same events submitted by people they met along the way...|$|R

5|$|But {{above all}} Mario Vargas Llosa uses the fictional Urania to {{facilitate}} the novel's attempt at remembering the regime. The novel opens and closes with Urania's story, effectively framing the narrative {{in the terms of}} remembering the past and understanding its legacy in the present. In addition, because of her academic study {{of the history of the}} Trujillo regime, Urania is also confronting <b>the</b> <b>memory</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> regime for the country as a whole. This is in keeping with one purpose of the book, which is to ensure that the atrocities of the dictatorship and the dangers of absolute power will be remembered by a new generation.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{violence}} of the suppression, the government and local lords were relatively circumspect in restoring order after the revolt, and continued to be worried about fresh revolts for several decades. Few lords took revenge on their peasants except through the legal processes of the courts. Low-level unrest continued for several more years. In September 1382 there was trouble in Norfolk, involving an apparent plot against the Bishop of Norwich, and in March the following year there was an investigation into a plot to kill the sheriff of Devon. When negotiating rents with their landlords, peasants alluded to <b>the</b> <b>memory</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> revolt and the threat of violence.|$|E
5|$|In 1962, {{the trust}} {{successfully}} lobbied {{for the house}} to become a national historic landmark. In 1972, the Trust donated the property to the National Park Service and it became the Longfellow National Historic Site {{and open to the}} public as a house museum. On display are many of the original nineteenth century furnishings, artwork, over 10,000 books owned by Longfellow, and the dining table around which many important visitors gathered. Everything on display was owned by the Longfellow family. The site was renamed to Longfellow House–Washington's Headquarters National Historic Site on December 22, 2010, to ensure that the connection to Washington was not lost in <b>the</b> <b>memory</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> general public.|$|E

5|$|In {{people with}} AD, the {{increasing}} impairment {{of learning and}} memory eventually leads to a definitive diagnosis. In a small percentage, difficulties with language, executive functions, perception (agnosia), or execution of movements (apraxia) are more prominent than memory problems. AD does not affect all memory capacities equally. Older memories of the person's life (episodic memory), facts learned (semantic memory), and implicit memory (<b>the</b> <b>memory</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> body {{on how to do}} things, such as using a fork to eat or how to drink from a glass) are affected to a lesser degree than new facts or memories.|$|E
5|$|In the Byzantine {{period the}} {{evolution}} of the port is halted due to the frequent invasions by the migratory people, the trade was fading and the traders were looking for other more secure markets like Venice or Genoa but many constructions in the port maintain the name genovese in <b>the</b> <b>memory</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> merchants from the Italian city. After a brief period when the port was under Romanian rule, the Dobruja region was occupied by the Ottoman Empire. In 1857, the Turkish authorities leased the port and the Cernavodă–Constanța Railway to the British company Danube and Black Sea Railway and Kustendge Harbour Company Ltd.|$|E
5|$|In the {{following}} year, under Prince Henry of Prussia, Hülsen was entrusted {{with the defense}} of occupied Saxony, and was appointed commander-in-chief on 21 April, when the prince was removed to Silesia. At this point, <b>the</b> <b>memory</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> old general evidently diminished, for the king gave him a major general to assist his command. On 29 October 1762 at the Battle of Freiberg, the last great battle of the Seven Years' War, he could not participate as planned, since his replacement had not yet arrived, but he advanced to Pretzschendorf after the battle.|$|E
40|$|<b>The</b> {{revealing}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> labor {{situation in}} Detroit plays {{a vital role}} in explaining its past and future state.

The construction and demolition process is engaged in labor. We propose that <b>the</b> material <b>of</b> Detroit (<b>the</b> <b>memories</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> labors that once occurred) be collected and archived. This database of material can inspire a community and begin to reveal <b>the</b> culture <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city...|$|R

40|$|What {{does it mean}} to {{bear witness}} to <b>the</b> <b>memories</b> <b>of</b> {{previous}} generations’ trauma victims? What lessons should we learn from those who came before us to ensure a happier future? This thesis explores <b>the</b> trauma and <b>memories</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> deceased or older generation found in J. K. Rowling’s Harry Potter series. I intend to analyze <b>the</b> character <b>of</b> Harry Potter as he interacts with <b>the</b> <b>memories</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> previous generation, which he is able to resurrect in embodied forms through <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> magic. By testifying to <b>the</b> <b>memories</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> previous generations’ trauma, Harry is able to break <b>the</b> cycle <b>of</b> violence and create a seemingly happy ending to his life’s story. Through critically studying Harry Potter as a transgenerational narrative, readers are able to learn how to bear witness to <b>the</b> <b>memories</b> <b>of</b> those with whom they associate in their own live and create a more empathetically inclined world...|$|R
5|$|The Moroccan Division Memorial is {{dedicated}} to <b>the</b> <b>memory</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> French and Foreign members of the Moroccan Division, killed during the Second Battle of Artois in May 1915. The monument was raised by veterans of the division and inaugurated on 14 June 1925, having been built without planning permission. Excluding the various commemorative plaques at the bottom front facade of the memorial, campaign battles are inscribed on the left- and right-hand side corner view of the memorial. The veterans of the division later funded the April 1987 installation of a marble plaque that identified the Moroccan Division as the only division where all subordinate units had been awarded the Legion of Honour.|$|E
5|$|The Pechenegs {{destroyed}} the Hungarians' dwelling places. Those {{who survived the}} double attack left the Pontic steppes and crossed the Carpathians {{in search of a}} new homeland. <b>The</b> <b>memory</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> destruction brought by the Pechenegs seems to have been preserved by the Hungarians. The Hungarian name of the Pechenegs (besenyő) corresponds to the old Hungarian word for eagle (bese). Thus the 14th-century Hungarian chronicles' story of eagles compelling the Hungarians' ancestors to cross the Carpathians most probably refers to the Pechenegs' attack.|$|E
5|$|The defence {{mechanism}} relies on <b>the</b> <b>memory</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> would-be predator; {{a bird that}} has once experienced a foul-tasting grasshopper will endeavour to avoid a repetition of the experience. As a consequence, aposematic species are often gregarious. Before {{the memory of a}} bad experience attenuates, the predator may have the experience reinforced through repetition. Aposematic organisms often move in a languid fashion, as they have little need for speed and agility. Instead, their morphology is frequently tough and resistant to injury, thereby allowing them to escape once the predator is warned off.|$|E

5|$|After the war, <b>the</b> {{military}} service <b>of</b> Hawaiians, including James Wood Bush and many others, was largely forgotten, disappearing from <b>the</b> collective <b>memories</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> American Civil War and <b>the</b> history <b>of</b> Hawaii.

5|$|The tragedy {{became part}} of the Albanian folk song {{repertoire}} relating to the migration of Albanians abroad. The leading figures of this practice were local intellectuals called rapsods related the mythistory of kurbet before World War II with the migration. They make use of metaphors and performance devices taken from oral folk poetry and death laments which react on the migrations to fix them in <b>the</b> <b>memory</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> community. This became a tool for responding to the loss of life for the tragedy of Otranto and other tragic events.|$|E
5|$|After {{his time}} on the Kentucky Court of Appeals, Hines {{returned}} to practicing law in Frankfort, Kentucky. In 1886, Hines began writing a series of four articles discussing the Northwest Conspiracy for Basil W. Duke's Southern Bivouac magazine. The magazine was dedicated to <b>the</b> <b>memory</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lost Cause of the Confederacy, but was less adversarial than similar Southern magazines, gaining a larger Northern readership than similar journals. The first of the articles was printed in the December 1886 issue. However, after consulting with former Confederate president Jefferson Davis at Davis' home in Mississippi, Hines did not name anybody on the Northern side who assisted in the conspiracy. After writing the first article, Hines was attacked for not being more forthcoming regarding all the participants from both newspapers' reviewers (particularly from the Louisville Times) and Southern readers, which discouraged Hines from publishing any more accounts of the Northwest Conspiracy.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{controversy}} and celebrity surrounding the case, the judicial duel between Carrouges and Le Gris {{was the last}} ever permitted by the French government and as such a well attended and infamous event, it soon attracted near-legendary status. In France <b>the</b> <b>memory</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> duel far outlasted its participants, primarily a result of it being recorded soon after by the contemporary chronicler Jean Froissart. Over the following century, vivid and imaginative accounts were carried in the chronicles of Jean Juvénal des Ursins and the Grandes Chroniques de France {{as well as by}} Jehan de Waurin and others, many embellishing the story with imaginative twists. The factual details of the case are unusually well recorded for a medieval trial as the records of the Parlement de Paris have survived intact and Jacques Le Gris' lawyer Jean Le Coq kept meticulous notes on the case which still exist. In addition to a clear view of proceedings these notes also contain Le Coq's own concerns about his client, whose innocence Le Coq deemed highly suspect.|$|E
