50|$|Proportional {{counters}} and end-window Geiger-Muller tubes {{have a very}} high efficiency for all ionising particles that reach the fill gas. Nearly every initial ionising event in the gas will result in <b>Townsend</b> <b>avalanches,</b> and thereby an output signal.

50|$|Depending on the {{characteristics}} of the specific tube (manufacturer, size, gas type, etc.) the voltage range of the plateau will vary. In this region, the potential difference in the counter is strong enough to allow the creation of multiple avalanches. A lower voltage is not sufficient to cause a complete discharge along the anode, and individual <b>Townsend</b> <b>avalanches</b> are the result as the tube tries to act as a proportional counter. If the applied voltage is higher than the plateau, a continuous glow discharge is formed and the tube cannot detect radiation.|$|R
50|$|The Geiger-Müller {{tube and}} the {{proportional}} counter both use a {{phenomenon known as}} a <b>Townsend</b> <b>avalanche</b> to multiply {{the effect of the}} original ionizing event by means of a cascade effect whereby the free electrons are given sufficient energy by the electric field to release further electrons by ion impact.|$|E
50|$|These {{isotopes}} produce {{ionizing radiation}} of alpha and beta type. This radiation causes high ionization inside the lamp {{without being able}} to escape from the lamp. High ionisation makes arc starting via <b>Townsend</b> <b>avalanche</b> much easier. Moreover, the presence of thorium in electrodes reduces the work function which again results in easier arc starting and sustaining.|$|E
5000|$|The first Townsend {{coefficient}} ( [...] α [...] ), {{also known}} as first <b>Townsend</b> <b>avalanche</b> coefficient is a term used where secondary ionisation occurs because the primary ionisation electrons gain sufficient energy from the accelerating electric field, or from the original ionising particle.

A NITPC can operate {{at very high}} reduced drift fields without diffusion runaway, and the readout digitization sampling rate requirement is considerably relaxed due to the low drift speed of negative ions. The initiation of <b>Townsend</b> <b>avalanches</b> to allow gas gain in these devices has not been understood until now.

However, the field is strong enough to prevent re-combination of the ion pairs and causes positive ions to drift towards the cathode and electrons towards the anode. This is the [...] "ion drift" [...] region. In the immediate vicinity of the anode wire, the field strength becomes large enough to produce <b>Townsend</b> <b>avalanches.</b> This avalanche region occurs only fractions of a millimeter from the anode wire, which itself is of a very small diameter.

It is employed a technique previously developed in our laboratory consisting in using the nozzle as a large-sized Langmuir probe. Based {{on the behavior of}} the ion current signal and simple estimations, it is concluded that (1) the non-equilibrium plasma inside the nozzle is far from the steady state in time, in contrast to what is frequently assumed. The power supply ripple was identified as the main fluctuations source and (2) large-scale plasma fluctuations inside the nozzle could cause transient (total duration of the order of 100 μs) <b>Townsend</b> <b>avalanches</b> developing in the space-charge layer located between the arc plasma and the nozzle wall. Such events trigger the so called non-destructive double-arcing phenomena without appealing to the presence of insulating films deposited inside the nozzle orifice, as was previously proposed in the literature. © 2011 American Institute of Physics.

50|$|When the {{electric}} field approaches the breakdown field, the electrons gain enough energy between collisions to ionize the gas atoms, knocking an electron off the atom. At the breakdown field, {{there is a}} balance between the production of new electrons (due to impact ionization) and the loss of electrons (due to attachment).Above the breakdown field, the number of electrons starts to grow exponentially, and an electron avalanche (<b>Townsend</b> <b>avalanche)</b> forms.|$|E

50|$|A {{streamer}} discharge, {{also known}} as filamentary discharge, {{is a type of}} transient electrical discharge. Streamer discharges can form when an insulating medium (for example air) is exposed to a large potential difference. When the electric field created by the applied voltage is sufficiently large, accelerated electrons strike air molecules with enough energy to knock other electrons off them, ionizing them, and the freed electrons go on to strike more molecules in a chain reaction. These electron <b>avalanches</b> (<b>Townsend</b> discharges) create ionized, electrically conductive regions in the air near the electrode creating the electric field. The space charge created by the electron avalanches gives rise to an additional electric field.This field can enhance the growth of new avalanches in a particular direction.Then the ionized region grows quickly in that direction, forming a finger-like discharge called a streamer.|$|R
50|$|The Townsend {{discharge}} or <b>Townsend</b> <b>avalanche</b> is a gas {{ionisation process}} where free electrons are accelerated by an electric field, collide with gas molecules, and consequently free additional electrons. Those electrons are in turn accelerated and free additional electrons. The {{result is an}} avalanche multiplication that permits electrical conduction through the gas.

50|$|The chamber {{is filled}} with {{carefully}} chosen gas, such as an argon/methane mix, such that any ionizing particle that passes through the tube will ionize surrounding gaseous atoms. The resulting ions and electrons are accelerated by the electric field across the chamber, causing a localised cascade of ionization known as a <b>Townsend</b> <b>avalanche.</b> This collects on the nearest wire and results in a charge proportional to the ionisation effect of the detected particle.

40|$|Analogous to {{terrestrial}} {{dust devils}}, charged dust in Mars dust devils should become vertically stratified in the convective features, creating large scale E-fields. This E-field in a Martian-like atmosphere {{has been shown}} to stimulate the development of a <b>Townsend</b> discharge (electron <b>avalanche)</b> that acts to dissipate charge in regions where charge build-up occurs. While the stratification of the charged dust is a source of the electrical energy, the uncharged particulates in the dust population may absorb a portion of these avalanching electrons, thereby inhibiting dissipation and leading to the development of anomalously large E-field values. We performed a laboratory study that does indeed show the presence of enhanced E-field strengths between an anode and cathode when dust-absorbing filaments (acting as particulates) are placed in the avalanching electron flow. Further, the E-field threshold condition to create an impulsive spark discharge increases to larger values as more filaments are placed between the anode and cathode. We conclude that the spatially separated charged dust creates the charge centers and E-fields in a dust devil, but the under-charged portion of the population acts to reduce Townsend electron dissipation currents, further fortifying the development of larger-than-expected E-fields...|$|R

40|$|The corona on {{high voltage}} {{overhead}} lines {{apart from other}} aspects, {{are known to be}} a source of electromagnetic noise. The basic mechanism behind corona discharge is an electron avalanche. The rapid spatial and temporal rate of charge separation in the avalanche results in dynamic electromagnetic field spanning a wide frequency spectrum ranging up to GHz. The literature relating basic avalanche process to the resulting electromagnetic field is rather limited and available ones deal only with far field component of an isolated avalanche. However, the near field components of the corona dominate in dictating the induced currents in the supporting conductor. These induced currents propagate along the lines and hence can be a strong source of electromagnetic noise. Therefore, a complete knowledge on the corona produced electromagnetic field i. e. the near and far field components are essential for evaluating the resulting electromagnetic noise. The present work is aimed to take a step forward and for this starting form <b>Townsend's</b> model for <b>avalanche</b> and retarded potentials, an expression for the total field due to an isolated electron avalanche is deduced.
