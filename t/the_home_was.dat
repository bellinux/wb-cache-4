They phoned Matt Pomposelli of Henderson, Nevada and told him that he and his family had won the vacant home. <b>The</b> <b>home</b> <b>was</b> officially presented to Pomposelli on the May 22 episode of Raw.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, {{and after}} Perry Ellwood died in 1943, May Ellwood again altered the home; {{to save on}} fuel oil, she had the upper floors of the house closed off. During this period, the library functioned as a guest room and a {{bathroom}} was added across the library's west wall. The bathroom was removed before the house opened as a museum in 1967. The library's plaster cornice and other architectural details have been restored based on a 1912 photograph. In 1964 <b>the</b> <b>home</b> <b>was</b> donated {{to the city of}} DeKalb and converted into a museum.|$|E
5|$|First {{owned by}} Eldon {{resident}} Charles Dibble after its construction in 1881 and 1882, <b>the</b> <b>home</b> <b>was</b> (with one 1897 exception) a private residence {{until the late}} twentieth century. After a thirty-year preservation effort culminated with the donation {{of the house in}} 1991 to the State Historical Society of Iowa, the site now includes the original house in its 1930 form and a visitors center. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. Since 1991, various caretaker-occupants have continued to rent the home privately.|$|E

5|$|The Glidden Barn, located to {{the rear}} and east of <b>the</b> <b>home,</b> <b>was</b> {{thought to have been}} added to the National Register of Historic Places when the {{original}} nomination for the house was approved in 1973. However, in the late 1990s, the Illinois Historic Preservation Agency revealed that the nomination included only the house. The Glidden Historical Center initiated the process of adding the barn to the Register. Those moves were approved by the Illinois Historic Sites Advisory Council in 2002 and the barn officially became part of the National Register.|$|E
5|$|The Joseph F. Glidden House {{is located}} in the United States in the DeKalb County, Illinois city of DeKalb. It was the home to the famed {{inventor}} of barbed wire Joseph Glidden. The barn, still located on the property near several commercial buildings, is said to be where Glidden perfected his improved version of barbed wire which would eventually transform him into a successful entrepreneur. The Glidden House was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. <b>The</b> <b>home</b> <b>was</b> designed by another barbed wire patent holder in DeKalb, Jacob Haish.|$|E

The home, which represents the mid-Georgian architectural style, is seasonally open to the public.|$|E
5|$|William F. Wayman {{designed}} the structure with Victor Batchelar building the home, while Charles F. Walters {{designed the}} grounds.

5|$|Without an {{acceptable}} {{home for the}} governor, the state purchased the house of Dr. John H. Sanders {{to serve as a}} residence for the Governor in 1837. The location, on the corner of Market and Illinois Streets in Indianapolis, proved to be damp and unhealthy because of the wetland conditions of the area during that time. Governor James Whitcomb blamed the conditions for his wife's death. <b>The</b> <b>home</b> <b>was</b> abandoned in 1861 during the term of Oliver Morton, who briefly lived in the house but refused to stay. The house was sold during his term and eventually destroyed.|$|E

5|$|After <b>the</b> <b>home</b> <b>was</b> {{placed on}} the National Register of Historic Places in 1974 (the result of an {{application}} by an Eldon farmer), the owner refurbished the house, installing an indoor bathroom and electricity and restoring the windows and wallpaper. Local politicians believed such work coupled with a new museum and education center could provide a major boost to local tourismâ€”one state senator hoped {{for as many as}} 100,000 visitors per year. After the house's owner eventually turned over the property to the State Historical Society of Iowa in 1991, an effort was made to move the house to Living History Farms outside Des Moines, but Eldonians fought to keep it within their city limits. The house was renovated in 1992, with boosters hoping to see the house become a pop-culture tourism attraction, much like the Field of Dreams site in similarly rural Dyersville. Today the American Gothic House Center hosts approximately 15,000 visitors per year, which does not account for additional after-hours visitors.|$|E
5|$|Hundreds of Iowa {{children}} were left homeless by the Civil War. On November 16, 1865, the Iowa Soldiers' Orphans' Home (renamed the Annie Wittenmyer Home in 1949) was opened. The first 150 children arrived from Keokuk, Iowa. Starting in 1876, children from broken homes {{as well as}} orphans from all of Iowa's ninety-nine counties were taken in at the home. <b>The</b> <b>home</b> <b>was</b> a self-contained community, containing residences, a school, tailor shop, and a chapel. The home had three separate fires during its course. On November 9, 1887, at three oâ€™clock in the morning, the third fire started. The building burnt to the ground. The next dayâ€™s Morning Democrat Gazette pointed out that if home was not set up with several different buildings as houses, all 350 children at the time would have been homeless, and some may have not survived the fire. After 110 years of service, the home closed in 1975. It is estimated that well over 12,000 {{children were}} helped by the Home during its operation.|$|E
5|$|In August 1906, a {{group of}} Cleveland Baptists {{incorporated}} an organization, the Baptist Home of Northern Ohio, to establish a retirement home for elderly Baptists. Ten months later, Southworth sold his house to the organization, which was supported financially by industrialist and philanthropist John D. Rockefeller, who was a Baptist. With the aid of local churches, <b>the</b> <b>home</b> <b>was</b> opened on October 16, 1907. According to the 1910 census, the Baptist Home served fourteen residents {{at the end of}} 1910, at which time the entire property was worth $15,000. The former Southworth residence was not long a retirement home: the Baptist Home moved to a new location in 1919 and sold the Southworth House in the same year. Since that time, the house has been used {{for a wide range of}} purposes.|$|E

5|$|Longfellow {{returned}} to the United States in 1836 and took up the professorship at Harvard. He was required to live in Cambridge {{to be close to}} the campus and, therefore, rented rooms at the Craigie House in the spring of 1837. <b>The</b> <b>home</b> <b>was</b> built in 1759 and was the headquarters of George Washington during the Siege of Boston beginning in July 1775. Elizabeth Craigie owned the home, the widow of Andrew Craigie, and she rented rooms on the second floor. Previous boarders included Jared Sparks, Edward Everett, and Joseph Emerson Worcester. It is preserved today as the Longfellow Houseâ€“Washington's Headquarters National Historic Site.|$|E
5|$|The Miller House is a Mid-Century modern home {{designed}} by Eero Saarinen and located in Columbus, Indiana. The residence {{was commissioned by}} American industrialist, philanthropist, and architecture patron J. Irwin Miller and his wife Xenia Simons Miller in 1953.

5|$|The {{governors}} remained {{without an}} official residence until 1919 {{when the state}} purchased a home located at 101 East 27th St., Indianapolis, for $65,000 and furnished it for an additional $20,000. It was built by Henry Kahn in 1908 and had the design of an English country house. The home had a Gothic interior with high, beamed ceilings and luxurious Wilton carpeting. After a brief renovation, <b>the</b> <b>home</b> <b>was</b> inhabited by the governor starting in 1919 and remained so until 1945.
