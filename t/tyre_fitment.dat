5000|$|Both {{versions}} had thinner glass, lighter seats, and 14" [...] Magnesium alloy wheels. The standard <b>tyre</b> <b>fitment</b> was 145/80 R14 T76 Bridgestone Ecopias or Continental Winter Tyres using very {{flat wheel}} covers to minimize turbulence. The engine block was also {{made from a}} light alloy, so {{even though it was}} a diesel, it weighed just 100 kg.|$|E
50|$|Due to {{the change}} of axles, the 4x4 LTs came with {{completely}} different wheel rims to standard LTs. All 4x4 LTs have 6 stud tube type split-rims in 6.5J width. The standard <b>tyre</b> <b>fitment</b> on these rims is 7.00x16 or 7.50x16. The biggest tyre that these rims will take is 9.00x16 (or 255/100/16), which will give another 6 cm of ground clearance, but that will require arch modifications in the front. Mefro has a 16x8J ET0 rim in their portfolio, that will fit the 4x4 LT, but these can't be bought directly. Owners have managed {{to get hold of}} these rims over a group buy. The Mefro rims will then allow to run 285/75/16 tyres on the 4x4 LT.|$|E
5000|$|The KB Centuras {{sold and}} {{assembled}} in Australia {{not only had}} a 1,981 cc version of the 4-cylinder Simca engine but were also available with Australian-made 6-cylinder pushrod 3,523/4,014 cc hemi engines and BorgWarner 3-speed automatic and 3- or 4-speed manual gearboxes. The four offered 122 hp (SAE), the sixes 142/167 hp (SAE) respectively. The KB series was sold in XL and GL trims, the latter having more equipment, including tachometer, clock, low fuel light (rare for 1975), rear bumper overriders, console (no storage) and optional vinyl roofs. There were no rear demister fitted, although a Smiths unit was fitted by some dealers. The KB model's European pedigree was obvious, with instrumentation in the opposite order and steering column controls on opposite sides. All KB GL spec cars came equipped with a tachometer, however it was optional on XL spec cars (whereas later KC cars only gained a tachometer through special order, {{or as part of}} the Sports option package) Interior flow ventilation was improved over the larger Valiant models, as the Centura had two face-level ventilation outlets. Although the A55 6 cylinder Centura Sports Package was fitted to some vehicles ( [...] included body stripes, styled wheels, woodgrain instrument cluster with tachometer, clock and Boca Raton cloth trim), it was common to see dealer fitted options including the styled road wheel option, and stencilled side stripes and bonnet black outs. The sixes also came with larger brakes (60 mm ventilated front discs and 25.4 mm rear finned drums) and a tandem brake reservoir. The six-cylinder Hemi cars used a 5-stud wheel bolt pattern, and the early 4-cylinder cars used a 4-stud wheel bolt pattern and only featured solid unventilated brake discs. Later 4-cylinder cars shared the same brakes and stud pattern as the 6 cylinder cars, and thus the same wheels. All Centura models were factory fitted with rack-and-pinion steering, however there was no power steering option. Steering could be heavy, so correct <b>tyre</b> <b>fitment</b> and pressures were a must. Factory / dealer fitted air, with the unit located below the heater controls was available but seldom optioned. Very few Centura's left the dealership with e33 engine code although a few examples do exist. One owned by a previous valiant production worker who ordered the option from new, it is now a sought after collectors item.|$|E
5000|$|The {{bodywork}} was {{beefed up}} with wider lightweight aluminium front and steel rear overhangs, these covered a substantially widened track {{at both the}} front and rear requiring longer drive shafts unique to the Racing Puma. A front aerodynamic air splitter and modified wider front bumper with sports grill. The wheels are Speedline Corse Turini alloys; 17" [...] x 7.5 (with an ET28 Offset) and use 215/40 17 <b>tyres</b> (original <b>fitment</b> <b>tyres</b> were Michelin SXGT 215/40 R17), this increases the width from 1674mm to 1770mm. The S1600 rally Puma is just 35mm wider than this.|$|R
5000|$|Originally {{introduced}} in early 1968 as the Roadmaster K81 rear tyre by Dunlop Rubber Co. Ltd, the tyre was renamed [...] "TT100" [...] {{because it was}} the first production tyre to reach a lap speed of 100 mph over the Isle of Man TT race course when Malcolm Uphill rode his works Thruxton Bonneville to victory in 1969 with a fastest lap of 100.37 mph during the 750 cc class production race. The feat was repeated in 1971 when Ray Pickrell averaged 100.01 mph on a Triumph Trident Slippery Sam replica, a modified version of the motorcycle the tyre was designed for. The <b>tyres</b> were standard <b>fitment</b> on production models of BSA and Triumph triple motorcycles.|$|R
30|$|From Table  1, {{bottleneck}} station can {{be identified}} as workstation 28, i.e., <b>tyre</b> <b>fitment.</b> First five critical workstations in this plant are 28, 34, 36, 21 and 18 having process times as 92.34, 91.85, 91.49, 91.38 and 91.25  s, respectively. Process time of workstation 28 is reduced to 90  s by maintaining inventory of rims, investing in spares and new tools, etc. Workstation 34 (Diesel and Battery fitment) now becomes a bottleneck station having process time as 91.85  s. Maintenance of hoist, availability of parts and provision of high speed dispensing pump could reduce the process time to 88  s. In these circumstances, bottleneck is at workstation 36, i.e., Bonnet fitment. Thus, bottleneck keeps shifting to other workstations after improvements.|$|E
40|$|In {{this era}} of {{globalisation}} and the consequent increase in social, economic and physical mobility, small businesses are transforming into sites of increasing language contact (Harris and Bargiela-Chiappini 2003). This study explores situated language practices within two small multilingual businesses. The first is a bicycle rental and repair shop located in Amsterdam (the Netherlands), which is {{a city with a}} dynamic multilingual society. The second is a <b>tyre</b> <b>fitment</b> centre in Grahamstown (South Africa), which is a city characterised by a stable triglossia of English, Xhosa and Afrikaans. Using Linguistic Ethnography (Rampton 2007) as my data collection method, I spent a total of eight weeks in these businesses. For the analysis I draw on Spencer-Oatey’s (2000 b; 2011) Rapport Management Framework and sociolinguistics of globalisation (Blommaert 2010). This combination allowed me to explore situated language practices in relation to a contemporary context of increased globalisation. The analysis is structured using Spencer-Oatey’s (2000 b) concept of rapport orientations. The orientations are presented as one of the key factors that influence the choice for a certain strategy. The orientations thus seemed a constructive way of showing how the observed strategies were employed by the participants of this study and what function they fulfilled in a certain context. However, difficulties emerged during the analysis with applying this concept to some of the more elaborate and complex data. As a result my argument developed into two different strands. The first demonstrates how individuals turn to their multilingual repertoires to negotiate agency and power relationships in small business discourse. The analysis reveals that people at times deliberately promote and maintains discordant relations, which can be understood as a rational response to the individual’s social and economic context. The second discusses the problems that emerged during my analysis with applying rapport management orientations to my data. I propose theoretical developments, warranted by my data, to create an Enhanced Rapport Management Framework suitable for the analysis of complex small business discourse...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with producing a simple method to design low volume roads (LVR) {{by means of a}} rationale which accounts for permanent deformation development in granular layers. Rutting is regarded as the main distress mode in unsealed and thinly sealed pavements. Hence, it is desirable that it be analytically approached rather than empirically, as in most design methods. The overall aim of this PhD thesis was to look into the behaviour of in-service roads and from a newly developed process, to advance, in a systematic manner, the elements required to produce a simple mechanistic design procedure. The study took as its basis an assessment of the proximity of the stress distribution in the pavement to the material’s failure envelope. After a literature review on unbound granular materials mechanical behaviour and on low volume roads pavement design methods, Chapters 4 and 5 discuss full scale trials carried out in Scotland on typical forest roads. The overall goal of the trials carried out within the Roads Under Timber Transport project was to establish the effect of weather and seasonal effects on the rutting of forest roads and to improve their performance while enabling the roads to be economically constructed and maintained. It appears that most of the rutting occurring in the sites surveyed came shortly after their construction/resurfacing, leading to the assumption that workmanship may be a highly important variable. Lack of compaction of the layer {{could be one of the}} likely reasons for the high initial rutting rates. Establishing the effect of weather on rutting further to the existing knowledge was, however, difficult to achieve; this was mainly due to the difficulties faced in monitoring traffic conditions. A newly developed method was needed to quantify permanent deformation development due to wandering traffic on a non-level pavement; this was achieved by the use of wheel path areas, and seemed to be a way forward in the analysis of rutting in unsealed roads. Accelerated pavement trials are reported that aimed to evaluate the performance of aggregate under soaked conditions and the relative pavement deformation caused by different timber haulage vehicles. A road segment simulating a standard forest road section was constructed in a purpose-built facility located at the Ringour Quarry facility. Ten different trials were carried out combining three different aggregate materials and five types of vehicles. <b>Tyre</b> <b>fitment,</b> axle configuration and tyre pressure were assessed and demonstrated to play an important role on the study of rutting development. Conclusions drawn from the results suggest that management of the tyre inflation pressure and axle overload may be one of the most economic means of managing pavement deterioration in the forest road network. A mechanistic analysis of a variety of unsealed pavements was carried out in Chapter 6; and the newly proposed methodology is described in Chapter 7. With changing loading conditions – e. g. as a consequence of the introduction of Tyre Pressure Control Systems and super single tyres – more detailed analyses are required, so that their effect can be analytically assessed. Then an analytical method is introduced for evaluating the stress-strain condition in thinly surfaced or unsurfaced pavements as typically used in LVR structures. It aims to improve the understanding of the effect of tyre pressure and contact area in regard to permanent deformation. To achieve this, several scenarios were modelled using Kenlayer software varying aggregate material, thickness, stiffness, tyre pressure & arrangement. The results usually show a fairly well defined locus of maximum stresses. By comparing this stress envelope with failure envelope, conclusions could be established about the more damaging effect of super singles over twin tyres and, likewise, the greater damage inflicted by high tyre pressures compared to that incurred by lower tyre pressures. Finally, the framework of the proposed method contributes to LVR pavement design procedures mainly due to its simplicity. It still treats the pavement analytically, permitting a more fundamental description of the behaviour of granular layers than in simple linear elastic analysis, but by simplifying the elasto-plastic analysis for routine use it thereby reduces demands of material characterization and computational skills, thus increasing its utility in practical application.
