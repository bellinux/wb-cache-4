5|$|At 04:00 on August 9 word reached Tokyo <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union {{had broken}} the Neutrality Pact, {{declared}} war on Japan, and launched an invasion of Manchuria.|$|E
5|$|In 1954, the Soviet Union {{suggested}} that it should join NATO to preserve peace in Europe. The NATO countries, fearing <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union's motive was to weaken the alliance, ultimately rejected this proposal.|$|E
5|$|The fact <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> {{government}} has {{enabled me to}} be here—and the Soviets know my views—is symbolic of the breach with Stalinism that perestroika represents.|$|E
25|$|The Yugoslav {{party on}} its side claimed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> had {{corrupted}} <b>the</b> conference documentation, <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> had tried to portray {{a greater degree of}} unity between the parties than what had actually been the case at the conference.|$|R
5000|$|The U.S. did not {{understand}} <b>that</b> Israel saw <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union as its number one threat; that even before he became President Nixon’s National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger had told Israeli leaders <b>that</b> <b>the</b> U.S. would not help Israel if <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> attacked it; <b>that</b> Israeli missiles targeted <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union from 1971 on; <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> had added four Israeli cities to their target list; <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> had threatened Israel after the 1973 war because Israel kept breaking ceasefires with Egypt.|$|R
5|$|Note, however, that Malik did {{not know}} (had not been informed) <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> were {{preparing}} to attack.|$|R
5|$|As the United States was {{initiating}} the Marshall Plan, Kennan and the Truman administration hoped <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union's rejection of Marshall aid would strain {{its relations with}} its Communist allies in Eastern Europe. Kennan initiated a series of efforts to exploit the schism between the Soviets and Josip Broz Tito's Yugoslavia. Kennan proposed conducting covert action in the Balkans to further decrease Moscow's influence.|$|E
5|$|In 2015, Japan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs declassified {{diplomatic}} documents {{which revealed}} that {{two months after}} the catastrophe, a high-ranking official of the U.S. administration confidentially informed Japan's diplomats <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union had mistaken the aircraft with an American reconnaissance plane.|$|E
5|$|In August 1957, the US assented to {{a two-year}} testing {{moratorium}} {{proposed by the}} Soviet Union, but required that it be linked to restrictions on the production of fissionable material with military uses, a condition <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union rejected. While Eisenhower insisted on linking a test ban to a broader disarmament effort (e.g., the production cut-off), Moscow insisted on independent consideration of a test ban.|$|E
5000|$|The FBI gets {{word that}} Anton is missing and realizes <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> {{are trying to}} extract him.|$|R
50|$|He claimed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> United States and <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union met in 1978 {{to discuss}} South Africa's nuclear weapons programme, and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> {{proposed}} a pre-emptive strike on the Pelindaba plant.|$|R
25|$|The treaty {{also had}} a secret supplement, which {{specified}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> could station only up to 20,000 of their troops.|$|R
5|$|In June 1988, the {{archaeologist}} {{and leader}} of the Christian Conservative Party of the BPF Zyanon Paznyak discovered mass graves of victims executed in 1937–41 at Kurapaty, near Minsk. Some nationalists contend that this discovery is proof <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> government was trying to erase the Belarusian people, causing Belarusian nationalists to seek independence.|$|E
5|$|The goal of {{his policy}} was to {{withdraw}} all the U.S. forces from Europe. The settlement reached {{would give the}} Kremlin sufficient reassurance against the establishment of regimes in Eastern Europe hostile to the Soviet Union, tempering the degree of control over that area <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> leaders {{felt it necessary to}} exercise.|$|E
5|$|After {{four years}} in Washington, he spent four years as Deputy Chief of Mission (DCM), the number two position, at Embassy Moscow. These years {{cemented}} his reputation within the State Department as a Soviet expert. In early 1976, the State Department made public the fact <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union had been beaming microwaves at the Moscow Embassy from a nearby building for many years. This caused concern about possible health effects of the low-level microwave radiation. Ironically, it was Soviet research that documented the psychological symptoms of sensitivity to microwave exposure. In the United States, the standards for safe exposure to microwaves were much more lenient than in the Soviet Union.|$|E
50|$|In 1984, the CIA both {{suffered}} from terrorism directed at it, and also supported anti-Soviet guerrillas in Afghanistan <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> considered terrorists.|$|R
50|$|An American {{secret agent}} {{is sent to}} <b>the</b> USSR {{discover}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> intend launching an ICBM sneak attack against the United States.|$|R
50|$|Historian David Glantz asserts <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> {{launched}} a First Jassy-Kishinev Offensive {{in this area}} between 8 April and 6 June. This attack failed.|$|R
5|$|An award-winning {{documentary}} about the escape was made by Claude Lanzmann, entitled Sobibor, 14 Octobre 1943, 16 heures. The revolt was also dramatized in the 1987 British TV movie Escape from Sobibor, in which Rutger Hauer received a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role (Television) for his portrayal of Pechersky. Pechersky however {{did not attend the}} premiere of the movie; his widow later stated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> government denied him permission to travel to the United States.|$|E
5|$|By {{the winter}} of 1939, the Soviets further reduced their demands and sent Boris Stein to negotiate. Stein and Erkko met five times. Erkko {{rejected}} the Soviet proposals, saying <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> demands would {{mean the end of}} the Finnish neutrality policy and displease the Germans. When the chairman of the Finnish Defense Council C.G.E. Mannerheim was informed of the negotiations, he opined that Finland should give up the Suursaari islands because their defence would anyway be impossible during a war, but his arguments did not persuade the majority of the Finnish government. Stein departed Helsinki empty-handed on 6 April.|$|E
5|$|Contemporaneously to {{establishment}} {{of the office of}} the President, representatives of the Congress of People's Deputies voted to remove Article 6 from the Soviet constitution which stated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union was a one-party state controlled by the Communist Party which, in turn, played the leading role in society. This vote weakened the Party and its hegemony over the Soviet Union and its people. Upon death, resignation, or removal from office of an incumbent President, the Vice President of the Soviet Union would assume the office, though the Soviet Union collapsed before this was actually tested. After the failed August Coup the Vice President was replaced by an elected member of the State Council of the Soviet Union.|$|E
5000|$|Maslennikov's border troops {{took part}} in the {{occupation}} of Poland in September 1939. In October of the same year, Maslennikov was engaged in the planning of occupation of the Baltic states and in the German-Soviet commission on repatriation from former Poland and Baltic states. According to the German reports, Maslennikov openly admitted <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> [...] "need no wealthy Ukrainians and Belarusians, only the proletariat"; this, incidentally, led Germans to assume <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> did not care about the Jews at all.|$|R
5|$|Von Neumann's {{assessment}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> had a lead in missile technology, considered pessimistic at the time, {{was soon}} proven correct in the Sputnik crisis.|$|R
50|$|An {{attempt to}} revive the film later during World War II was {{suppressed}} on <b>the</b> grounds <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> were then allies of the West.|$|R
5|$|German {{operations}} in the Atlantic also suffered. By May 1943, as Allied counter-measures became increasingly effective, the resulting sizeable German submarine losses forced a temporary halt of the German Atlantic naval campaign. In November 1943, Franklin D. Roosevelt and Winston Churchill met with Chiang Kai-shek in Cairo and then with Joseph Stalin in Tehran. The former conference determined the post-war return of Japanese territory and the military planning for the Burma Campaign, while the latter included agreement that the Western Allies would invade Europe in 1944 and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union would declare war on Japan within three months of Germany's defeat.|$|E
5|$|Glasnost {{reforms in}} the same year brought about a {{relaxation}} of press censorship; consequently reports started to appear in the Soviet press suggesting <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> military knew the location of the wreckage and had possession of the flight data recorders. On December 10, 1991, Senator Jesse Helms of the Committee on Foreign Relations, wrote to Boris Yeltsin requesting information concerning the survival of passengers and crew of KAL007 including the fate of Congressman Larry McDonald.|$|E
5|$|In 1949 the Armenian Academy of Sciences began major {{excavations}} of the Garni fortress site led by Babken Arakelyan. Architectural historian Alexander Sahinian {{focused on}} the temple itself. It was not until almost twenty years later, on December 10, 1968, <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Armenian government approved the reconstruction plan of the temple. A group led by Sahinian began reconstruction works in January 1969. It was completed by 1975, almost 300 {{years after it was}} destroyed in an earthquake. The temple was almost entirely rebuilt using its original stones, except the missing pieces which were filled with blank stones intended to be easily recognisable. In 1978 a monument dedicated to Sahinian was erected not far from the temple.|$|E
50|$|Von Neumann's {{assessment}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> had a lead in missile technology, considered pessimistic at the time, {{was soon}} proven correct in the Sputnik crisis.|$|R
50|$|There is {{compelling}} evidence <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> have sponsored {{a number of}} revolutionary and separatist-irredentist groups, especially in El Salvador, where they directly delivered arms.|$|R
5000|$|Hersh alleges <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> {{learned about}} and communicated to Egyptian President Anwar Sadat Israeli threats {{to use the}} Samson Option in the 1973 war.|$|R
5|$|In November 1940 Stalin sent Molotov to Berlin to meet Ribbentrop and Adolf Hitler. In January 1941, the British Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden visited Turkey in {{an attempt}} to get the Turks to enter the war on the Allies' side. Though the purpose of Eden's visit was anti-German rather than anti-Soviet, Molotov assumed otherwise, and in a series of conversations with the Italian Ambassador Augusto Rosso, Molotov claimed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union would soon be faced with an Anglo-Turkish {{invasion}} of the Crimea. The British historian D.C. Watt argued that on the basis of Molotov's statements to Rosso, it would appear that in early 1941, Stalin and Molotov viewed Britain rather than Germany as the principal threat.|$|E
5|$|Later, the Finnish statesman J.K. Paasikivi commented <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> attack, {{without a}} {{declaration}} of war, violated three different non-aggression pacts: the Treaty of Tartu of 1920, the Non-aggression Pact between Finland and the Soviet Union signed 1932 and again in 1934, and further the Charter of the League of Nations. The invasion was judged as illegal by the League of Nations, which expelled the Soviet Union on December 14. Following the Soviet attack, C.G.E. Mannerheim was appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Finnish Defense Forces. Furthermore, the Finnish government changed as Risto Ryti was appointed {{the new prime minister}} and Väinö Tanner as foreign minister.|$|E
5|$|Norwegian Prime Minister Einar Gerhardsen {{visited the}} Soviet Union in May 1965, in which Soviet Premier Alexei Kosygin warned against the {{installation}} and stated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union {{would build a}} counter-station. In June, the Soviet Consul in Barentsburg came on an inspection to the installation, and on 2 July a Soviet helicopter crashed at the construction site after having, presumably unintentionally, touched a mast. Soviet demands to have permanent Soviet inspectors of the facility were rejected. The Svalbard Treaty does not include any verification procedure, and as such no signatories {{have the right to}} conduct inspections.|$|E
50|$|When Stalin and Churchill met {{face-to-face}} in October 1944, Stalin told Churchill <b>that</b> <b>the</b> lack of <b>Soviet</b> {{support was}} {{a direct result of}} a major reverse in the Vistula sector in August, which had to be kept secret for strategic reasons. All contemporary German sources assumed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> were trying to link up with the resistance, and they believed it was their defence <b>that</b> prevented <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> advance rather than a reluctance to advance on the part of <b>the</b> <b>Soviets.</b> Nevertheless, as part of their strategy the Germans published propaganda accusing both <b>the</b> British and <b>Soviets</b> of abandoning <b>the</b> Poles.|$|R
2500|$|In <b>the</b> meantime, <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> {{immediately}} summoned <b>the</b> Bulgarian {{ambassador to}} the Foreign Ministry, stating <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> needed to do {{a deal with the}} Bulgarians before they joined <b>the</b> Axis and <b>that</b> Germany was attempting to make them a puppet state. [...] The Bulgarians turned down the offer and leaked it to Germany. [...] Hitler still hoped to dissuade Stalin from giving guarantees to Bulgaria if they could solve the Bosporus issue and pressed <b>the</b> Bulgarian ambassador <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> could be persuaded against resistance if the Bulgarians joined the pact, while warning about the horrors of a Soviet occupation.|$|R
5000|$|Starting in late 1985 {{and through}} 1986, {{a series of}} events turned opinion against Excalibur. One of the many {{arguments}} used to support Excalibur, and SDI as a whole, was <b>the</b> suggestion <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> were working on the same ideas. In particular, they pointed out <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> published numerous papers on x-ray lasers until 1977 when they suddenly stopped. They argued this was because they had also begun an x-ray laser weapons program, and stated <b>that</b> this meant <b>the</b> US had to continue their own.|$|R
