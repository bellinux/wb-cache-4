But I was happy to do it – it's way more fun being bad than good!" [...] The episode also marks the final appearance by Ed Begley, Jr., after his character is killed. The mystery surrounding his murder would be the next major story arc.|$|E
500|$|Hurley {{worries that}} the Hatch {{implosion}} turned Desmond into the Hulk, a Marvel Comics character who turned large and green upon being exposed to Gamma rays.

[...] Hurley's numbers are also partially visible. Dominic Monaghan as his character Charlie, says, while {{trying to figure out}} who Locke needs to speak to: [...] "Trees? Yea I heard they are wonderful conversationalists", a reference to Monaghan's work in The Lord of the Rings, in which he talks to trees.|$|E

500|$|In the 1991 MTV special {{hosted by}} Kurt Loder titled Breakfast with Madonna, Loder {{described}} the video as [...] "amazing", then asked Madonna if {{her father had}} seen it. Madonna responded, [...] "To <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth,</b> I don't know if he's seen it. I'm sort of afraid to ask." [...] After MTV world-premiered the video on November 11, 1989, they wanted {{to pull it off}} broadcast until the scene with the lips shut was removed. Madonna disagreed and told them that she would cancel future deals with the channel, prompting MTV to air the video again. The music video has been honored by Rolling Stone as one of [...] "The 100 Top Music Videos", placed at number66. In 1991, the video received a nomination at the 33rd Grammy Awards, in the category of Best Short Form Music Video. Madonna's vision of reconciliation in the music videos of both [...] "Oh Father" [...] and her 1986 single [...] "Papa Don't Preach" [...] was later included in the third level of Madonna Studies, a controversial development of a field in media studies during the 1990s. The music video for [...] "Oh Father" [...] is commercially available on Madonna's The Immaculate Collection (1990) DVD/VHS compilation.|$|E
500|$|As the {{nominations}} for the 66th Primetime Emmy Awards approached, early media reports named True Detective among several potential miniseries candidates, {{due to a}} revision made by the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences that recognized film and miniseries content as distinct categories. By March 2014, HBO had submitted True Detective as a drama series contender, an unconventional move given the show's anthology format and fierce competition {{from the likes of}} Breaking Bad and House of Cards. HBO's decision was censured by FX president John Landgraf, who remarked to reporters at a press event: [...] "My own personal point of view is that a miniseries is a story that ends, a series is a story that continues. To <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth,</b> I think it’s actually unfair for HBO to put True Detective in the drama series category because essentially you can get certain actors to do a closed-ended series – a la Billy Bob Thornton in Fargo or Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson in True Detective – who you can’t get to sign on for a seven-year [...] deal." [...] Nevertheless, True Detective emerged as a frontrunner heading into the Primetime Emmy season, and in July 2014, was nominated for twelve awards; its closest rival, Breaking Bad, received sixteen nominations. The series ultimately won five Emmy awards: Outstanding Directing (Fukunaga), Outstanding Casting, Outstanding Main Title Design, Outstanding Make-Up, and Outstanding Cinematography.|$|E
500|$|The {{producers}} asked United Artists for financing, but {{the studio}} would only put up $1 million. Later, the UK arm of United Artists provided an extra $100,000 {{to create the}} climax where Dr. No's base explodes. As {{a result of the}} low budget, only one sound editor was hired (normally there are two, for sound effects and dialogue), and many pieces of scenery were made in cheaper ways, with M's office featuring cardboard paintings and a door covered in a leather-like plastic, the room where Dent meets Dr. No costing only £745 to build, and the aquarium in Dr. No's base being magnified stock footage of goldfish. Furthermore, when art director Syd Cain found out his name was not in the credits, Broccoli gave him a golden pen to compensate, saying {{that he did not want}} to spend money making the credits again. Production designer Ken Adam later told UK daily newspaper The Guardian in 2005: [...] "The budget for Dr No was under $1m for the whole picture. My budget was £14,500. I filled three stages at Pinewood full of sets while they were filming in Jamaica. It wasn't a real aquarium in Dr No's apartment. It was a disaster to <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> because we had so little money. We decided to use a rear projection screen and get some stock footage of fish. What we didn't realise was because we didn't have much money the only stock footage they could buy was of goldfish-sized fish, so we had to blow up the size and put a line in the dialogue with Bond talking about the magnification. I didn't see any reason why Dr No shouldn't have good taste so we mixed contemporary furniture and antiques. We thought it would be fun for him to have some stolen art so we used Goya's Portrait of the Duke of Wellington, which was still missing at the time. I got hold of a slide from the National Gallery - this was on the Friday, shooting began on the Monday - and I painted a Goya over the weekend. It was pretty good so they used it for publicity purposes but, just like the real one, it got stolen while it was on display." ...|$|E

She told an interviewer, [...] "...it {{was a lot of fun}} at first, but I'm really tired nowadays. To <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth,</b> I think I'm over-exerting myself right now.

As an actress {{you want to}} get roles you can get your teeth into. I leave it at the gates when I leave work. Years ago, with the storyline when Kat told Zoe Slater she was her real mother, I found it tougher because I was new to the game. But I've been doing it a lot longer now, and can detach myself from it. You have to." [...] On a lighter note, Wallace added: [...] "There are two babies playing Tommy, called Ralph and Shane, and they're dressed in outfits like zebra-skin babygros and little denim jackets – that's the Alfie (Shane Richie) influence. They keep going for Kat's big earrings and they're always grabbing at the chicken fillets I have to wear." ...|$|E

[...] Several titles for the film were announced, and on May 22, 1935, MGM announced that the title would be The Hands of Orlac. The Mad Doctor of Paris was also suggested, but the studio eventually settled on the original title of Mad Love. Shooting finished on June 8, 1935, one week over schedule. After the initial release, MGM cut about fifteen minutes of scenes from the film. Cut scenes included the surgery to get Rollo's hands, a pre-credit warning scene similar to the one in Frankenstein, and Isabel Jewell's entire portrayal of the character Marianne.|$|E
2500|$|According to the Markan account, {{the perfume}} was the purest of spikenard. Some of the onlookers were angered because this {{expensive}} perfume {{could have been}} sold for a year's wages, which Mark enumerates as 300 denarii, and the money given to the poor. The Gospel of Matthew states that the [...] "disciples were indignant" [...] and John's gospel states that it was Judas Iscariot who was most offended (which is explained by the narrator as being because Judas was a thief and desired the money for himself). In the accounts, Jesus justifies Mary's action by stating that they would always have the poor among them and {{would be able to}} help them whenever they desired, but that he would not always be with them and says that her anointing was done to prepare him for his burial. As one commentator notes, [...] "Mary seems to have been the only one who was sensitive to the impending death of Jesus and who was willing to give a material expression of her esteem for him. Jesus' reply shows his appreciation of her act of devotion." [...] The accounts in Matthew and Mark adds these words of Jesus, [...] "I <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth,</b> wherever this gospel is preached throughout the world, what she has done will also be told, in memory of her".|$|E
