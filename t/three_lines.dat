5|$|Gergonne's insight {{was that}} if a line L1 could be {{constructed}} such that A1 and B1 were guaranteed to fall on it, those two points could be identified as the intersection points of L1 with the given circle C1 (Figure6). The remaining four tangent points would be located similarly, by finding lines L2 and L3 that contained A2 and B2, and A3 and B3, respectively. To construct a line such as L1, two points must be identified that lie on it; but these points need not be the tangent points. Gergonne was able to identify two other points {{for each of the}} <b>three</b> <b>lines.</b> One of the two points has already been identified: the radical center G lies on all <b>three</b> <b>lines</b> (Figure6).|$|E

5|$|Sinden made {{changes for}} the third period. He benched Awrey and the Jean Ratelle line, going with <b>three</b> <b>lines.</b> In the third, Clarke scored to bring Canada within one. The Canadians {{attempted}} to get the equalizer, and Yvan Cournoyer put a puck off the post, but the Soviets broke out afterwards and Boris Mikhailov scored on the counter-attack to restore the two-goal lead with six minutes to play. Mikhailov skated across the Canadian net about 20 feet out, lured Dryden away from the net, then back-handed the puck into the net between his legs. The strategy of <b>three</b> <b>lines,</b> combined with the heat in the arena, had left the Canadians exhausted by then and the Soviets scored twice in the final minutes to finish with a 7–3 victory.|$|E

5|$|Due {{to a low}} {{supply of}} petrol, bus traffic was {{replaced}} by electric tramways during the war. The trams experienced therefore an increase in ridership, from 64 million passengers per year in 1939 to 151 million in 1944. The <b>three</b> <b>lines</b> of Holmenkolbanen had together a ridership of 9.5billion in 1939, 10.9billions in 1940, 21 billions in 1943 and at the peak 22.6 billion passengers in 1945. In addition to the regular tram passenger services, Oslo Sporveier started to transport goods across the city in tram wagons.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 18th century and early 19th century Warsaw grew quickly. As Poland {{was going through}} a period of turmoil and {{constant}} devastating wars, it lacked modern permanent fortifications. To make up for it, <b>three</b> <b>lines</b> of earthworks, ramparts and palisades were constructed {{on both sides of the}} Vistula. The earthworks, usually several metres high and constructed mostly of sand and clay, were reinforced with gabions and surrounded by a dry moat, a stockade and a line of trous de loup.|$|E
5|$|Lines {{of poems}} are often {{organized}} into stanzas, which are denominated {{by the number}} of lines included. Thus a collection of two lines is a couplet (or distich), <b>three</b> <b>lines</b> a triplet (or tercet), four lines a quatrain, and so on. These lines may or may not relate to each other by rhyme or rhythm. For example, a couplet may be two lines with identical meters which rhyme or two lines held together by a common meter alone.|$|E

5|$|Polish {{headquarters}} {{decided to}} man the outer line of defences, the furthest from the densely populated areas. The {{reason was that}} in the 1830s 53 percent of buildings (out of 3,148 houses in Warsaw) were made of wood and a fire could easily destroy the city. In case the enemy broke through all <b>three</b> <b>lines</b> of defences, the city centre was also fortified with 30 barricades, embrasures cut through the walls of several buildings and mines hidden beneath major street crossings.|$|E

He has stated that he prefers formations that use four lines of players (as opposed to <b>three</b> <b>lines</b> in the classic 4–4–2) due to the added depth in defence and presence in midfield, and was inspired to use the formations by Carlo Ancelotti. He has also stated that he prefers the 4–3–3 formation to the 4–4–2 formation, and has criticised the way he perceives 4–4–2 to be 'ingrained in the culture' of English football. He {{is known to be}} extremely thorough and meticulous in preparing his players for games.|$|E
