5|$|Outside these countries, Bennett {{remained}} almost unknown as a musician, {{although his}} reputation as a conductor led Berlioz <b>to</b> <b>invite</b> him to join his Société Philharmonique, and the Dutch composer Johannes Verhulst solicited his support for the Netherlands Society for Encouragement of Music.

In his 2008 book on the Natchez revolt, Arnaud Balvay wrote that more likely than not, the conspiracy claim was false because of incoherence in primary sources.|$|E

5|$|Achaea {{was now in}} turmoil, {{and some}} cities were close to revolt; many {{residents}} were angered at Aratus' decision <b>to</b> <b>invite</b> the Macedonians into the Peloponnese.

Encouraged by this development, Cleomenes invaded Achaea and seized the cities of Pellene, Pheneus and Penteleium, effectively splitting the Achaean League in half. The Achaeans, concerned about developing treachery in Corinth and Sicyon, dispatched their mercenaries to garrison the cities {{and then went to}} Argos to celebrate the Nemean Games.|$|E

5|$|Author Robert Rodriguez {{writes that}} {{the content of the}} five loops has {{continued}} <b>to</b> <b>invite</b> debate among commentators, however, and that the manipulation applied to each of the recordings has made them impossible to decipher with authority. Based on the most widely held views, he says that, aside from McCartney's laughter and the B flat major chord, the sounds were two loops of sitar passages, both reversed and sped up, and a loop of Mellotron string and brass voicings. In their book Recording the Beatles, Kevin Ryan and Brian Kehew list two loops of sitar recordings yet, rather than Mellotron, list a mandolin or acoustic guitar, treated with tape echo.|$|E
5|$|Demerits: However, competencies, {{efficiency}} and effectiveness can be unclear and contradictory, especially {{when dealing with}} oversimplified matters. In a dehumanized bureaucracy, inflexible in distributing the job-scope, with every worker having to specialize from day one without rotating tasks for fear of decreasing output, tasks are often routine and can contribute to boredom. Thus, employees can sometimes {{feel that they are}} not part of the organization's work vision and missions. Consequently, they do not have any sense of belonging in the long term. Furthermore, this type of organization tends <b>to</b> <b>invite</b> exploitation and underestimate the potential of the employees, as creativity of the workers is brushed aside in favour of strict adherence to rules, regulations and procedures.|$|E

5|$|Germany {{failed to}} {{recognize}} Lithuania as an independent state, and the Lithuanian delegation was not invited to the Brest-Litovsk negotiations that started on December 22, 1917, between the Central Powers and Russia in order to settle territorial claims. During the first and final official joint session between the Council and the German authorities, it was {{made clear that the}} Council would serve only as an advisory board. This situation gave additional backing to those Council members who were seeking independence without any ties to other countries. The prime concern at this point was <b>to</b> <b>invite</b> back those members who had left the Council. Negotiations were undertaken that led to the reformulation of previous versions of the Act.|$|E
