5|$|During the 1930 s, {{reform was}} {{gradually}} legislated by the British; Congress won {{victories in the}} resulting elections. The next decade was beset with political turmoil: Indian participation in World War II, the Congress' final push for non-cooperation, and an upsurge of Muslim nationalism led by the All-India Muslim League. The escalating political tension was capped by Independence in 1947. The jubilation was <b>tempered</b> <b>by</b> the bloody partition of the subcontinent into India and Pakistan.|$|E
5|$|George Pullman and William Halliday {{familiarized}} {{themselves with}} their industrial operations, giving {{attention to the}} minutest details. Their labor forces, <b>tempered</b> <b>by</b> the demands of industry in America, expected to work hard {{in exchange for the}} necessities of life. Cooperation between managers and workers created a higher standard of living, which in turn, encouraged better working conditions.Good housing also helped promote good work habits.|$|E
5|$|However, {{potentially}} severe {{restrictions on}} free speech, {{some of which}} are elaborated upon below, may act as a disincentive to people expressing political views. These restrictions inevitably have a bearing on how representative democracy is upheld, and have also been said to impact the content of free speech as opposition parties are <b>tempered</b> <b>by</b> the fear of defamation suits.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{demonstrate}} that temper-ing Markov chain Monte Carlo samplers for Bayesian models by recursively subsampling observations without replacement can im-prove {{the performance of}} baseline samplers in terms of effective sample size per computa-tion. We present two <b>tempering</b> <b>by</b> subsam-pling algorithms, subsampled parallel tem-pering and subsampled tempered transitions. We provide an asymptotic analysis of the computational cost of <b>tempering</b> <b>by</b> subsam-pling, verify that <b>tempering</b> <b>by</b> subsampling costs less than traditional tempering, and demonstrate both algorithms on Bayesian ap-proaches to learning the mean of a high di-mensional multivariate Normal and estimat-ing Gaussian process hyperparameters. ...|$|R

5|$|In {{the latter}} half of 1660, Charles's joy at the Restoration was <b>tempered</b> <b>by</b> the deaths of his {{youngest}} brother, Henry, and sister, Mary, of smallpox. At around the same time, Anne Hyde, the daughter of the Lord Chancellor, Edward Hyde, revealed that she was pregnant by Charles's brother, James, whom she had secretly married. Edward Hyde, who had not known of either the marriage or the pregnancy, was created Earl of Clarendon and his position as Charles's favourite minister was strengthened.|$|E
5|$|Shelby {{had hoped}} {{to be given the}} {{contract}} to produce the Tiger in America, but Rootes was somewhat uneasy about the closeness of his relationship with Ford, so it was decided to build the car in England. The Rootes factory at Ryton did not have the capacity to build the Tiger, so the company contracted the job to Jensen in West Bromwich. Any disappointment Shelby may have felt was <b>tempered</b> <b>by</b> an offer from Rootes to pay him an undisclosed royalty on every Tiger built.|$|E
5|$|The British {{governments of}} 1954–58 (under Conservatives Winston Churchill, Anthony Eden, and Harold Macmillan) also quietly {{resisted}} a test ban, despite the British public favoring a deal, until the US Congress approved expanded nuclear collaboration in 1958 and until after Britain had tested its first hydrogen bombs. In their view, testing was necessary if the UK nuclear program were {{to continue to}} develop. This opposition was <b>tempered</b> <b>by</b> concern that resistance to a test ban might lead the US and Soviet Union to pursue an agreement without Britain having any say in the matter.|$|E

5|$|The Crimean War of 1854–55 and the Italian War of 1859 {{disrupted}} {{relations among}} Great Britain, France, Austria, and Russia. In {{the aftermath of}} this disarray, the convergence of von Moltke's operational redesign, von Roon and Wilhelm's army restructure, and Bismarck's diplomacy influenced the realignment of the European balance of power. Their combined agendas established Prussia as the leading German power {{through a combination of}} foreign diplomatic triumphs—backed up by the possible use of Prussian military might—and an internal conservativism <b>tempered</b> <b>by</b> pragmatism, which {{came to be known as}} Realpolitik.|$|E
5|$|Villagers {{gathered}} around the burning windmill cheer the apparent death of the Monster (Boris Karloff). Their joy is <b>tempered</b> <b>by</b> the realization that Henry Frankenstein (Colin Clive) is also apparently dead. Hans (Reginald Barlow), father of the girl the creature drowned in the previous film, {{wants to see the}} Monster's bones. He falls into a flooded pit underneath the mill, where the Monster– having survived the fire– strangles him. Hauling himself from the pit, the Monster casts Hans' wife (Mary Gordon) to her death. He next encounters Minnie (Una O'Connor), who flees in terror.|$|E
5|$|A third {{attempt was}} planned for September 13; bad weather delayed {{attempts}} until September 16. However, General Schuyler was {{by this time}} so ill that he thought it necessary to withdraw to Ticonderoga. He left that day, turning full command of the invasion over to Montgomery. Schuyler {{was not the only}} one falling ill; the bad weather, and the swampy, malaria-infested terrain of Île-aux-Noix was also taking a toll on the troops, as more of them became ill as well. The bad news was <b>tempered</b> <b>by</b> good; an additional 250 troops, in the form of a company of Green Mountain Boys under Seth Warner, and another company of New Hampshire men under Colonel Timothy Bedel, arrived at Île-aux-Noix.|$|E

5|$|After World War I, {{in which}} {{approximately}} one million Indians served, a new period began. It {{was marked by}} British reforms but also repressive legislations, by more strident Indian calls for self-rule, and by {{the beginnings of a}} nonviolent movement of non-co-operation, of which Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi would become the leader and enduring symbol. During the 1930s, slow legislative reform was enacted by the British; the Indian National Congress won victories in the resulting elections. The next decade was beset with crises: Indian participation in World War II, the Congress's final push for non-co-operation, and an upsurge of Muslim nationalism. All were capped by the advent of independence in 1947, but <b>tempered</b> <b>by</b> the partition of India into two states: India and Pakistan.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the evening, key {{warships}} {{that remained}} in government hands included Bahias sister , the aging cruiser , and the eight new destroyers of the Pará class. Their potential power, however, was dwarfed by the dreadnoughts—each of which outgunned all of the warships alone—and was severely <b>tempered</b> <b>by</b> personnel issues. First, naval officers were suspicious of even the enlisted men who remained loyal to the government. Officers took over all of the positions that would be involved in direct combat, and the numbers of enlisted men were reduced wherever possible. Further complicating matters were missing weapon components, such as the destroyer's torpedoes, which could not be fired without firing caps, yet the caps were not where they were supposed to be. When caps were finally located and delivered, they did not fit the newer torpedoes carried by the destroyers. The correct caps were fitted only two days after the rebellion began.|$|E
5|$|In the {{documentary}} {{of the film}} titled A World Unseen, Iñárritu has stated that for the main themes of the film he revisits the issues and concerns of intense parental and filial relations, which audiences of his previous films readily recognize as a recurrent theme in his previous work. Regarding the theme of revenge seen throughout The Revenant, Iñárritu has stated that the approach of vengeance seen in the film needs to be significantly <b>tempered</b> <b>by</b> anyone {{who would want to}} see vengeance as either an effective or useful moral to be applied in life. In the end, Iñárritu states, there can only be disappointment and lack of fulfillment for anyone who looks to revenge as providing a higher purpose for living or a life defining purpose.|$|E

60|$|He thus amused his mother's mind, and soothed her {{irritable}} <b>temper</b> <b>by</b> {{marks of}} consideration and regard, and sustained {{her in a}} very dignified and lofty position in the royal household, while yet he confided to her very little substantial power.|$|R
60|$|Cronshaw {{was often}} so ill-humoured that Philip could only keep his <b>temper</b> <b>by</b> remembering {{all the time}} that this {{irritability}} was a symptom of the disease. Upjohn came sometimes before Philip was in, and then Cronshaw would complain of him bitterly. Upjohn listened with complacency.|$|R
5|$|Penelope's {{story is}} an attempt at {{narrative}} justice to retribute Helen for her erroneously idealised image in the Odyssey as the archetypal female. Penelope acts like a judicial arbiter, a position she held in Ithaca {{as the head of}} state and, during Odysseus' absence, as head of the household. The ancient form of justice and punishment, which was swift and simple {{due to the lack of}} courts, prisons, and currency, is <b>tempered</b> <b>by</b> more modern concepts of balanced distributions of social benefits and burdens. Penelope's chosen form of punishment for Helen is to correct the historical records with her own bias by portraying her as vain and superficial, as someone who measures her worth by the number of men who died fighting for her.|$|E
5|$|Ruth's legendary {{power and}} charismatic {{personality}} {{made him a}} larger-than-life figure during the Roaring Twenties. During his career, he {{was the target of}} intense press and public attention for his baseball exploits and off-field penchants for drinking and womanizing. His often reckless lifestyle was <b>tempered</b> <b>by</b> his willingness to do good by visiting children at hospitals and orphanages. After his retirement as a player, he was denied a managerial job in baseball, most likely due to poor behavior during parts of his playing career. In his final years, Ruth made many public appearances, especially in support of American efforts in World War II. In 1946, he became ill with cancer, which claimed his life two years later.|$|E
5|$|The {{aircraft}} was initially {{powered by the}} Pegasus 6 engine which {{was replaced by the}} more powerful Pegasus 11 during the Harrier GR.1 to GR.3 upgrade process. The primary focus throughout the engine's development was on achieving high performance with as little weight as possible, <b>tempered</b> <b>by</b> the amount of funding that was available. Following the Harrier's entry to service the focus switched to improving reliability and extending engine life; a formal joint US–UK Pegasus Support Program operated for many years and spent a £3-million annual budget to develop engine improvements. Several variants have been released; the latest is the Pegasus 11–61 (Mk 107), which provides 23,800lbf (106kN) thrust, more than any previous engine.|$|E

5|$|The {{municipal}} corporation of Madurai has {{an area of}} 147.97km2. Madurai is hot and dry for eight months of the year. Cold winds are experienced during February and March as in the neighbouring Dindigul. The hottest months are from March to July. The city experiences a moderate climate from August to October, <b>tempered</b> <b>by</b> heavy rain and thundershowers, and a slightly cooler climate from November to February. Fog and dew are rare, occurring only during the winter season. Being equidistant from mountains and the sea, it experiences similar monsoon pattern with Northeast monsoon and Southwest monsoon, with the former providing more rain during October to December. The average annual rainfall for the Madurai district is about 85.76cm.|$|E
5|$|The will, Balzac cautions, is a {{destructive}} force that seeks only to acquire power unless <b>tempered</b> <b>by</b> knowledge. The shopkeeper presents a foil for Valentin's future self, offering study and mental development {{as an alternative}} to consuming desire. Foedora also serves as a model for resistance to the corruption of will, insofar as she seeks at all times to excite desire in others while never giving in to her own. That Valentin is happiest living in the material squalor of his tiny garret– lost in study and writing, with the good-hearted Pauline giving herself to him– underscores the irony of his misery {{at the end of the}} book, when he is surrounded with the fruits of his material desire.|$|E
5|$|Belgrano {{also studied}} living languages, {{political}} economy, and public rights. The authors that most influenced him were Pedro Rodríguez de Campomanes, Gaspar Melchor de Jovellanos, Adam Smith, and François Quesnay. Belgrano translated Quesnay's book Maximes générales de gouvernement economique d'un royaume agricole (General Maxims of the Economical Government in an Agricultural Kingdom) to Spanish. His main {{interest in the}} works of such authors were ideas that referred to the public good and popular prosperity. Like many South American students, he became interested in physiocracy, which stated that new wealth came from nature, that agriculture was an economic activity that generated more income than one needed, and that the state should not interfere at all with it. By that time, South America had plenty of natural resources and a very strict state interventionism in the economy. Belgrano developed the idea that the principles of physiocracy and those stated by Adam Smith could be applied together in the viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata. In the development of this approach he was influenced by Fernando Galliani, who promoted the study of particular cases over theoric generalisations, and Antonio Genovesi, who thought that the absolute freedom promoted by physiocrats should be <b>tempered</b> <b>by</b> a moderate intervention by the state, such as the provision of free education for some. During his time in Europe, Belgrano became president of an Academy within the University of Salamanca devoted to Roman legislation, forensic practice and political economy.|$|E
