5|$|On June 20, 2014, Deadline {{announced}} {{the cast of}} the eight lead characters, along with Freema Agyeman, Naveen Andrews, Daryl Hannah, Alfonso Herrera and Eréndira Ibarra. For the roles of those characters living outside of America, the filmmakers wanted to assemble a cast of international actors that matched the nationality of their respective characters, if possible. For example, Doona Bae, Tina Desai, and Max Riemelt are from Seoul, Mumbai, and Berlin like their respective characters. Because the eight leads share the same birthday, the actors selected were all somewhere between mid-20s and mid-30s. The filmmakers {{wanted to write a}} Chinese, Japanese or Korean character and since the Wachowskis had worked with Bae on Cloud Atlas and Jupiter Ascending before, they decided on creating a Korean character for her. Bae expressed worry to them on signing on Sense8 because the proposed five-season plan could mean she would {{have to be able to}} film action scenes for the next 10 years, which would be difficult if she ever decided to get married and got pregnant. She joined the cast after the showrunners told her not to worry as they would kill off her character for her if that ever happened. Jamie Clayton is a trans woman like the character she plays. She was attracted to Sense8 because of the opportunity to play a transgender character that was written and directed by a transgender filmmaker, and because she was a fan of science fiction and Straczynski. Tuppence Middleton knew the Wachowskis were writing Sense8 while working with them on Jupiter Ascending but she did not <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> ask her to play a role. Max Riemelt was cast at the recommendation of director Tom Tykwer, who had been wanting to work with the actor for a long time. Daryl Hannah was brought in to read for Whispers, because they were thinking of making him an androgynous character at the time, but when she arrived she was told they'd like her to read for the role of Angelica. In November, Deadline wrote than Christian Oliver had joined the cast as a recurring villain. Oliver said he was excited to play a villain for the Wachowskis for a second time, after Speed Racer. Joe Pantoliano, who previously played in the Wachowskis' Bound and The Matrix, was cast in a small uncredited role as Will's father.|$|E
25|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the Bear's Super Bowl victory the two made a pact that they would return to the golf course every year until the Bears repeated as Super Bowl Champions.

500|$|Potter and Warne agreed {{volume of}} nursery rhymes {{would be created}} in 1905 but she also brought his {{attention}} to a story she had previously written, writing to him, [...] "I think 'Mrs. Tiggy' would be all right; it is a girl's book ... {{there must be a}} large audience of little girls. I <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> like the different clothes." [...] She began the illustrations in the summer once he agreed to the concept.|$|E

500|$|He {{also began}} {{studying}} revolutionary politics including the Marxist theory of Henri Lefebvre, who {{introduced him to}} the Communist poet Louis Aragon in 1928. Berni continued corresponding with Aragon after leaving France, later recalling, [...] "It is a pity that I have lost, among the many things I have lost, the letters that I received from Aragon all the way from France; if I had them today, I <b>think,</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> be magnificent documents; because in that correspondence we discussed topics such as the direct relationship between politics and culture, the responsibilities of the artist and the intellectual society, the problems of culture in colonial countries, the issue of freedom." ...|$|E
500|$|Explaining why {{he chose}} {{to make a film}} about Scientology, Gibney told Reuters that he {{considered}} it [...] "an important topic. Not only about this church of Scientology, which everybody's fascinated with partially because of the celebrities, but partially because of the way that the church seems to turn people to do things that I <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> normally never do if had they not entered the church." [...] Gibney, Wright, and the former Scientologists who appeared in the film told a post-screening question-and-answer session that they hoped the film would raise public awareness about the alleged abuses committed by the Church of Scientology, and would prompt the media and law enforcement agencies to investigate further. Gibney later called in a Los Angeles Times opinion piece for Scientology's tax exemption to be revoked {{in the light of the}} allegations of abuse documented in the film.|$|E
500|$|Musically, Dig Me Out was {{considered}} rockier than its predecessor. Weiss' drumming style {{was influenced by}} traditional rock and roll bands such as The Rolling Stones, The Beatles, and The Kinks, as well as numerous blues rock musicians such as Lightnin' Hopkins, Muddy Waters, Billy Boy Arnold, and Bessie Smith, among others. Both Tucker and Brownstein remarked that Weiss became {{an essential part of}} the band's sound. According to Tucker, [...] "Musically, she's completed our band. She's become the bottom end and the solidness that we've really wanted for our songwriting". In addition to playing drums, Weiss provides hand claps and tambourine in [...] "Turn It On". Dig Me Out also contains more guitar and vocal interplay by Tucker and Brownstein than Call the Doctor. As Brownstein explains, [...] "If you were to separate our guitar parts I don't necessarily <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> fully stand on their own. Our songs [...] aren't really complete until the other person has put their part over it, and their vocals".|$|E

500|$|In 1899, that {{prediction}} suddenly came true. At {{the age of}} forty-two, Elgar {{produced the}} Enigma Variations, which were premiered in London under the baton of the eminent German conductor Hans Richter. In Elgar's own words, [...] "I have sketched a set of Variations on an original theme. The Variations have amused me because I've labelled them with the nicknames of my particular friends ... {{that is to say}} I've written the variations each one to represent the mood of the 'party' (the person) ... and have written what I <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> have written – if they were asses enough to compose". He dedicated the work [...] "To my friends pictured within". Probably the best known variation is [...] "Nimrod", depicting Jaeger. Purely musical considerations led Elgar to omit variations depicting Arthur Sullivan and Hubert Parry, whose styles he tried but failed to incorporate in the variations. The large-scale work was received with general acclaim for its originality, charm and craftsmanship, and it established Elgar as the pre-eminent British composer of his generation.|$|E
500|$|The {{circumstances}} of the sinking were featured by a BBC programme. According to this, the despatch of Gloucester, alone and low on fuel and anti-aircraft ammunition (less than 20% remaining), into danger was a [...] "grievous error". Furthermore, the failure to attempt to rescue survivors after dark was [...] "contrary to usual Navy practice". A survivor commented [...] "The tradition in the Navy is that when a ship has sunk, a vessel is sent back to pick up survivors under cover of darkness. That did not happen {{and we do not}} know why. We were picked up by Germans." [...] On 30 May 1941, {{in a letter to the}} First Sea Lord, Sir Dudley Pound, Cunningham wrote, [...] "The sending back of Gloucester and Fiji to the Greyhound was another grave error and cost us those two ships. They were practically out of ammunition but even had they been full up I <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> have gone. The Commanding Officer of Fiji told me that the air over Gloucester was black with planes." ...|$|E
500|$|In January 2017, PewDiePie {{began to}} receive {{criticism}} for his non-gaming videos. In one, he seemingly {{uses the word}} nigga, which caused #PewdiepieIsOverParty to trend worldwide on Twitter. A few days later, PewDiePie created further controversy, when he uploaded a video featuring him reviewing the website Fiverr, which allows people to sell a service for $5 USD. In the video, PewDiePie shows his reaction to a duo he had paid to display the message [...] "DEATH TO ALL JEWS" [...] on a sign, as a joke and attempt to highlight the ridiculous things which can be provided as a paid service on the Internet. He immediately apologised within the same video stating, [...] "I am sorry. I didn't <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> actually do it. I feel partially responsible," [...] adding [...] "I'm not anti-Semitic, [...] so don't get the wrong idea. It was a funny meme, and I didn't think it would work, okay." [...] PewDiePie received criticism from some users in the video's comment section, {{as well as from}} some media outlets. As a result of this video, both PewDiePie and the duo were banned from Fiverr, prompting the latter to upload an apology video stating that they did not understand the meaning of the sign, and that they were sorry to all Jews.|$|E

500|$|Her {{marriage}} to O'Malley was well received; Staci Krause of IGN wrote: [...] "Their {{relationship has been}} a roller coaster and {{it was nice to}} see this turn of events, as she really is a perfect contrast to George." [...] Discussing the character in terms of her relationship with Hahn, Williams was largely positive, assessing that: [...] "The story line offered both the drama Grey's is known for and a truthfulness network television has rarely achieved when it comes to lesbian relationships." [...] Trish Doolan and Nikki Weiss, invited by GLAAD to consult with Grey's Anatomy producers on the storyline, praised the effort put into researching the issue by the writers and actors involved, though were more negative on the scene which saw Hahn kiss Callie in an elevator in front of Mark Sloan. Weiss commented: [...] "I just felt like, if they really cared about each other, I don't <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> do that as a stunt. That seemed a little, I don't know, forced. [...] was more like a conquest, like he could have [...] too or something." [...] LGBT website AfterEllen.com agreed with this view, criticizing the way the scene was edited so as to keep cutting to Sloan's point of view, as though [...] "privileging the male gaze." [...] AfterEllen.com included Torres in their list of the Top 50 Lesbian and Bisexual Characters, ranking her at No. 6 and in their Top 50 Favorite Female TV Characters. The character was also listed in Wetpaint's [...] "10 Hottest TV Doctors on TV".|$|E
500|$|After {{completing}} the film, Hillenburg {{wanted to end}} the series [...] "so [...] wouldn't jump the shark." [...] "We're working on episodes 40 through 60 right now, and I always looked at that as a typical run for an animated show. [...] lasted about that long, for example. And I thought now {{was a good time}} to step aside and look at a different project. I personally think it's good not to go to the point where people don't want to see your show anymore," [...] Hillenburg said in 2002. However, Nickelodeon wanted to produce more episodes: [...] "The show was such a cash cow for the station that it couldn't afford not to," [...] storyboard director Sam Henderson observed. Initially Hillenburg doubted that the network would continue the show without him, saying: [...] "I think [...] respect that my contribution is important. I <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> want to maintain the original concept and quality." [...] Consequently, he resigned as the showrunner and appointed his trusted staff member Paul Tibbitt to the role. Although he no longer has a direct involvement in the production of SpongeBob SquarePants, he still retains a position as an executive producer and maintains an advisory role, reviewing each episode. While he was on the show, Hillenburg voiced Potty the Parrot and sat in with Derek Drymon at the record studio to direct the voice actors while they were recording. During the fourth season, Tibbitt took on voicing for Potty, while Andrea Romano replaced the two as the voice director.|$|E
500|$|Mary Macnamara of the Los Angeles Times has {{praised the}} {{character}} highly, writing: [...] "Hahn {{is a terrific}} character, sassy and professional, with an appropriately acerbic view of the various romantic shenanigans. She {{also seems to be}} a carefully considered stand-in for viewers choking on the soapy silt of last season, a way for the writers to move forward without messing with the hugely successful brand. (Don’t get too nervous, Brooke, but the future of TV's once highest-rated drama may be in your hands.)" [...] Discussing the character in terms of her relationship with Callie Torres, AfterEllen.com were also largely positive, assessing that: [...] "The story line offered both the drama Grey's is known for and— despite some marginally exploitative threesome talk— a truthfulness network television has rarely achieved when it comes to lesbian relationships." [...] Trish Doolan and Nikki Weiss, invited by GLAAD to consult with Grey's Anatomy producers on the storyline, praised the effort put into researching the issue by the writers and actors involved, though were more negative on the scene which saw Hahn kiss Callie in an elevator in front of Mark Sloan. Weiss commented: [...] "I just felt like, if they really cared about each other, I don't <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> do that as a stunt. That seemed a little, I don't know, forced. [...] was more like a conquest, like he could have [...] too or something." [...] AfterEllen.com agreed with this view, criticizing the way the scene was edited so as to keep cutting to Mark's point of view, as though [...] "privileging the male gaze." [...] Smith, however, has refuted this interpretation, stating that; [...] "Frankly, when I played that scene, I played it as, [...] "You think that if you walked in the room and we were together, we would just be on you, but we wouldn't." [...] So that's why I kissed her. In that moment, I swear to God, when I was playing it, that's what I was thinking. You know there's a bit of a competition between all the guys in the boys club and my character anyway, so when that happened it was sort of like, [...] "Oh yeah, you wouldn't be intimidated, uh huh. OK, well, check this out." ...|$|E

If he chooses the suggested answer and it proves to be correct, the audience member will also receive a prize of €500. This lifeline is also implemented in the Costa Rican version, after the first milestone is reached. Starting in its thirteenth season, the U.S. syndicated version uses a variant of this lifeline, called [...] "Plus One", which allows the contestant to bring a companion with them for help, rather than having them select their companion from the audience.|$|E

2500|$|After Epstein's death, Silvers was {{the sole}} editor until his own death in 2017. Asked about who might succeed him as editor, Silvers told The New York Times, [...] "I can think of several {{people who would be}} {{marvelous}} editors.

[...] In 2008, the Review celebrated its 45th anniversary with a panel discussion at the New York Public Library, moderated by Silvers, discussing [...] "What Happens Now" [...] in the United States after the 2008 election of Barack Obama as president. Panelists included Review contributors such as Didion, Wills, novelist and literary critic Darryl Pinckney, political commentator Michael Tomasky, and Columbia University professor and contributor Andrew Delbanco. The 45th anniversary edition of the Review (November 20, 2008) began with a posthumous piece by Edmund Wilson, who wrote for the paper's first issue in 1963.|$|E
2500|$|In January 2012, Moloney told Sue Yeap from The West Australian {{that while}} Sonya {{was the one}} for Toadie, he did not <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> not be getting married anytime soon. The actor {{believed}} Toadie did not need {{a piece of paper}} and a ring to tell the world that Sonya was [...] "the love of his life." [...] Sonya and Toadie begin planning to have a baby and Morey stated that she was [...] "deliriously broody" [...] at the prospect of her character becoming pregnant. She admitted that she loved the journey the couple had been on as they try to start a family, although she thought Sonya might go over the top with the situation, which would make it hard for those around her. She also believed that Sonya and Toadie would make [...] "wonderful parents" [...] because of the amount of thought they had put into the decision. She added that Toadie has always wanted a child of his own, while Sonya wanted to make up for her past problems. After failing to fall pregnant, Sonya gave up hope that she and Toadie would naturally conceive a child and she went through a [...] "mourning process", before trying to move on. During a blood drive, Sonya was asked to take a pregnancy test and it came back positive. Both Sonya and Toadie were shocked, but delighted to learn that they were expecting a baby.|$|E
2500|$|Tobias {{has stayed}} up all night, and is making himself a morning cocktail. Agnes comes down from her room. [...] She tells Tobias that it is his role {{to make all the}} {{decisions}} with regards to what to do about Edna and Harry. She reminds Tobias of the time when he prevented her from getting pregnant after the death of their son. Claire, Julia, Tobias, and Agnes all discuss their versions of why Harry and Edna are there and what they should do about it. Harry and Edna join them, and everyone in the room is drinking. Edna announces that Harry wants to talk to Tobias alone, and the women exit. Harry tells Tobias that if the circumstances were reversed, he and Edna don’t <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> allow Tobias and Agnes to live at their house, {{in spite of the fact}} that they are best friends. Harry asks Tobias, “You don’t want us, do you, Toby?” [...] Tobias answers that he does not really want Harry and Edna to stay there but that because they are friends, Harry and Edna have the right to be there. [...] He goes with Harry to get their suitcases and put them back in their car. Agnes says to Edna, “Everything becomes… too late, finally.” The play ends on Agnes’s rumination that people sleep at night because they are afraid of the dark: “They say we sleep to let the demons out—to let the mind go raving mad…And when the daylight comes again... comes order with it.” ...|$|E
