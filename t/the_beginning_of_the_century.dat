At <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>century,</b> artists from around the world, including Picasso, Modigliani, and Matisse made Paris their home.

5|$|By {{the start}} of the 13th century, royal {{authority}} over Suffolk had been firmly established, after Henry II crushed the Bigods in the revolt of 1173–1174, Orford being heavily garrisoned during the conflict, with 20 knights being based there. Upon the collapse of the rebellion, Henry ordered the permanent confiscation of Framlingham Castle. The political importance of Orford Castle diminished after Henry's death in 1189, although the port of Orford grew in importance, however, handling more trade than the more famous port of Ipswich by <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>century.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the 18thcentury, {{the horse}} {{population}} of Finland vastly diminished in both numbers and quality. At <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>century,</b> during the Great Northern War campaigns of Charles XII, the Finnish cavalry {{was larger than}} at any other time in history, and almost every usable horse of Finland was needed. Horses were used by the cavalry, infantry, and for transporting supplies. Horses serving in the Swedish military never returned to Finland; even the animals provided to the last remaining Swedish reinforcement regiments were taken to Sweden in 1714, and to Norway in 1718.|$|E

5|$|Neoclassicism or {{increasingly}} Nordic Classicism {{continued to}} thrive at <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>century</b> until about 1930 {{as can be}} seen in Kay Fisker's Hornbækhus apartment buildings (1923) and Hack Kampmann's police headquarters (1924). Its development was no isolated phenomenon, drawing on existing classical traditions in the Nordic countries, and from new ideas being pursued in German-speaking cultures. It can thus be characterised as a combination of direct and indirect influences from vernacular architecture (Nordic, Italian and German) and Neoclassicism.|$|E
5|$|This {{magnificent}} {{and tragic}} satire criticizes {{the prototype of}} the Latin American dictator who appeared in several places at <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>century</b> and has since reappeared, his existence being fostered by the mechanism of tyranny which, for the common man, makes every day a hell on earth. The passionate vigour with which Asturias evokes the terror and distrust which poisoned the social atmosphere of the time makes his work a challenge and an invaluable aesthetic gesture.|$|E
5|$|Around <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>century</b> {{there were}} a number of major {{restoration}} projects on British castles. Before the outbreak of the First World War work was undertaken at Chepstow, Bodiam, Caernarfon and Tattershal; after the end of the war various major state funded restoration projects occurred in the 1920s with Pembroke, Caerphilly and Goodrich amongst the largest of these. This work typically centred on cutting back the vegetation encroaching on castle ruins, especially ivy, and removing damaged or unstable stonework; castles such as Beaumaris saw their moats cleaned and reflooded. Some castles such as Eilean Donan in Scotland were substantially rebuilt in the inter-war years. The early UK film industry took an interest in castles as potential sets, starting with Ivanhoe filmed at Chepstow Castle in 1913 and starring US leading actor King Baggot.|$|E

5|$|At <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>century,</b> Gaudí {{was working}} on {{numerous}} projects simultaneously. They reflected his shift to a more personal style inspired by nature. In 1900, he received an award for the best building of the year from the Barcelona City Council for his Casa Calvet. During {{the first decade of}} the century Gaudí dedicated himself to projects like the Casa Figueras (Figueras house, better known as Bellesguard), the Park Güell, an unsuccessful urbanisation project, and the restoration of the Cathedral of Palma de Mallorca, for which he visited Majorca several times. Between 1904 and 1910 he constructed the Casa Batlló (Batlló house) and the Casa Milà (Milá house), two of his most emblematic works.|$|E
5|$|The British {{proposed}} {{the demolition of}} the fortifications {{a number of times}} in the 19th century. The first proposal was made by Major-General Henry Pigot at <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>century.</b> In 1853, a proposal was made to demolish Saint James Cavalier {{to make way for a}} military hospital. In 1855, Sir John Lysaght Pennefather {{proposed the}} construction of a citadel on the high ground of the Sciberras peninsula, on the site of the Valletta Land Front and the surrounding area. In 1872, the demolition of the city's outworks was proposed, while the demolition of the entire land front was suggested in 1882. Eventually, the fortifications were left largely intact, and the only part that was demolished was St. Madeleine's Lunette, which was located near the entrance to the city (on the site now occupied by the Triton Fountain).|$|E
5|$|When Gifu {{was founded}} in 1889, {{it was a small}} city that {{experienced}} moderate growth as Japan industrialized at <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>century.</b> During Japan's military buildup in the 1930s, the city became an industrial center and experienced exponential growth. Gifu remained prosperous in the post-war years, until its population started to decline like many Japanese cities in the 1980s and '90s. Though the city has shown a large increase in population in recent years, this trend results largely from the inclusion, for the first time, of the population of Yanaizu, which added about 13,000 people to Gifu's numbers. Foreign residents of the city, who number over 9,000, also factor into this growth. Shortly after this change, however, the city's economic revival strengthened and the population began to show a true increase.|$|E

5|$|As {{sovereign}} of Madagascar, Ranavalona III {{became a}} pawn in the endgame of the maneuvering {{that had been}} taking place between the British and French since <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>century.</b> The tension between France and Madagascar had grown especially acute {{in the three years}} prior to Ranavalona's succession, with an intensification of attacks in the months prior to her coronation. In February 1883 the northwestern coast was bombarded, followed by the occupation of Mahajanga by the French in May, and bombardment and capture of Toamasina in June. Attacks along the northern coast were ongoing at the time Ranavalona III was crowned in the summer of 1883. Shortly after the French initiated this latest round of hostilities, Prime Minister Rainilaiarivony decided to engage Lieutenant Colonel Digby Willoughby, a Briton who had gained combat experience in the Anglo-Zulu War (but without having {{been a member of the}} British armed forces), to oversee the nation's military affairs and train the queen's army to defend the island against the seemingly inevitable French invasion.|$|E
5|$|By the 9th century, {{the crisis}} of the Classic Maya {{collapse}} was sweeping across the region, with populations plummeting and city after city falling into silence. Increasingly endemic warfare in the Maya region caused Tikal's supporting population to heavily concentrate close to the city itself, accelerating the use of intensive agriculture and the corresponding environmental decline. Construction continued at <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>century,</b> with the erection of Temple 3, the last of the city's major pyramids, and the erection of monuments to mark the 19th K'atun in 810. The beginning of the 10th Bak'tun in 830 passed uncelebrated, and marks the beginning of a 60-year hiatus, probably resulting from the collapse of central control in the city. During this hiatus, satellite sites traditionally under Tikal's control began to erect their own monuments featuring local rulers and using the Mutal emblem glyph, with Tikal apparently lacking the authority or the power to crush these bids for independence. In 849, Jewel K'awiil is mentioned on a stela at Seibal as visiting that city as the Divine Lord of Tikal but he is not recorded elsewhere and Tikal's once-great power {{was little more than a}} memory. The sites of Ixlu and Jimbal had by now inherited the once exclusive Mutal emblem glyph.|$|E
5|$|Hay Castle was {{substantially}} {{expanded in}} the 17th century, creating a Jacobean mansion. Two explanations {{have been offered}} by historians for this redevelopment. One option is that {{during the first half}} of the 17th century, Howell Gwynne built a manor house to the west of the old keep, which was replaced by a new mansion in 1660 by James Boyle of Hereford. Another reverses this sequence, suggesting that James Boyle left the castle to Howell Gwynne in 1603, and that the mansion was built at <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>century.</b> In either case, the Jacobean building was two storeys tall, three with its facade included, and featured seven dormer gables in a Dutch style and a large staircase. It was built from stone and incorporated the upper floors of the old keep into its design. Formal gardens were constructed outside the keep either around the start of the 17th century or after 1660. In 1702, the house was divided up among different tenants, and passed into the hands of the local Wellington family. Until 1812, the basement of the keep was used to supplement the town gaol.|$|E
