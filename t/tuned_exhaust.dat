25|$|Both the 2702 and 2703 use {{free air}} or fan cooling, with Bing 34mm slide carburetors. The {{cylinder}} walls are electrochemically coated with Nikasil. Standard starting is recoil start. Reduction drive systems available are the G-50 gearbox with reduction ratios of 2.16:1, 2.29:1, 2.59:1, 3.16:1, or 3.65:1, or a multi-element cog belt drive.

25|$|Fetters {{strongly}} {{denied that}} the design had safety issues and issued statements indicating that all accidents were due to improper maintenance, failure of builders to carry out rotor tracking and balancing or lack of piloting skills. In response to customer complaints in 1998 Fetters did add a <b>tuned</b> <b>exhaust</b> system to increase engine output, stronger transmission gears and a mast support kit to reduce vibrations.|$|E
25|$|On April 3, 2006 Symphony Aircraft {{announced}} that a <b>tuned</b> <b>exhaust</b> system made by Power Flow Systems would be offered as an option on the SA-160. This US$1600 option was forecast to give a 10% improvement in rate of climb to about 781ft/min, an increased optimal cruise speed of about 5 knots to about 133 knots, or 0.5 to 1.5 US gallon per hour decrease in fuel burn, down to about 7.5 US gallons per hour.|$|E

50|$|The S63 is BMW's Motorsport {{division}} {{version of}} the N63, which debuted in the BMW X6 M. The S63 uses two twin-scroll turbochargers plus a pulse <b>tuned,</b> cross-engine <b>exhaust</b> manifold to keep constant exhaust pulses flowing to the turbos at every 180 degree rotation.|$|R
50|$|Expansion {{chambers}} {{were invented}} and successfully manufactured by Limbach, a German engineer, in 1938, to economize fuel in two stroke engines. Germany was running short of petrol, {{which was at}} that stage produced using coal and sewerage transformation. An unexpected bonus was that the two stroke engines using <b>tuned</b> <b>exhausts</b> produced far more power than if running with a normal silencer.After {{the end of the}} second world war, some time passed before the concept was re-developed by East German Walter Kaaden during the Cold War. They first appeared in the west on Japanese motorcycles after East German motorcycle racer Ernst Degner defected to the west while racing for MZ in the 1961 Swedish Grand Prix. He later passed his knowledge to Japan's Suzuki.|$|R
25|$|Edgar Rose's German parents {{escaped with}} him from Essen to Czecoslavakia ahead of Hitler and then to Ankara again ahead of Hitler. Edgar grew up in Ankara and then {{attended}} Robert College where he studied engineering and learned English. He was accepted at MIT {{and worked in the}} Lubrication Lab which was then run by Charlie Strang. Strang, a former boat racer was hired to run the engineering dept. at Mercury Outboards by Carl Kiekhaefer. Strang hired Edgar, who in 1958 designed the first <b>tuned</b> <b>exhaust</b> system on a production outboard. Strang and Rose left Mercury ca. 1963 and were hired by OMC, Outboard Marine Corp. where Rose became chief engineer until his retirement in 1990. Edgar Rose's parents are buried in Vienna.|$|E
2500|$|The KFM 107 is a {{conventional}} twin-cylinder engine {{that is very}} compact and light weight at only [...] in its 107s version. The engine features single capacitor discharge ignition, a single Tillotson butterfly-type carburetor, integral fuel pump, <b>tuned</b> <b>exhaust</b> system and reed valve induction. It was offered with 2:1 belt drive reduction system. Starting is electric starter or recoil starter.|$|E

5000|$|Engines are {{commonly}} set {{to increase their}} power output when under load. This permits low speeds but very good speed stability, so the climb performance is excellent. The original scheme used was {{to take advantage of}} the tendency of a nominally two-stroke glow engine to change from running in a four-stroke when set with extremely rich mixtures, to running in a two-stroke when the load increases. This is called a [...] "4-2 break". More recently, <b>tuned</b> <b>exhausts</b> have been used to provide regulation of the speed in flight. Combined with propellers of relatively low pitch, this has permitted much more control over the engine's speed and power response to maneuvering. Electric system contain feedback control system that govern the RPM of the motor to a constant value regardless of load.|$|R
40|$|A J- 65 {{engine was}} {{run with a}} <b>tuned</b> {{sound-absorbing}} <b>exhaust</b> duct to study the internal and jet components of rear quadrant noise.

50|$|Post INRC, most top drivers {{switched}} to the Maruti Gypsy for its off-road and Four-wheel drive capabilities. The highly modified Group A (II) IND category allowed tuners the flexibility to choose between {{a wide range of}} cam shafts, <b>tuned</b> <b>exhausts</b> and heavily modified cylinder heads. Till 1992, MRF was the principal choice of tyres for most Maruti Gypsys and twin Weber carburetors were the preferred choice for the fully modified class. For the 1994 season S. Karivardhan opted for computer programmable Electronic Fuel Injection for Hari Singh's Team JK Gypsy and they were dominant during that period, prompting N. Leelakrishnan to follow suit in EFI systems for his Rally cars. Alarmed at the high budgets and top speeds of the top runners, FMSCI for 1996 season finally outlawed the Group A (II) IND category and reverted to Group A (I) IND category which restricted engine modifications and the regular stock Group N category. The loud intake and screaming exhaust note with crackling backfire were missed by many rally fans.|$|R
25|$|The 2006 Shelby GT-H {{and later}} Shelby GT {{were based on}} the {{standard}} GT model, but modified by Carroll Shelby International to produce 319hp (238kW) by means of a Ford Racing air intake, performance <b>tune,</b> and upgraded <b>exhaust</b> system.|$|R

50|$|The Kawasaki 440/A engine, {{produced}} by Kawasaki, is a 436 cc piston port engine utilizing 38 mm Mikuni VM series carburetors and a <b>tuned</b> dual <b>exhaust.</b> While this engine {{is no longer}} competitive in road racing, it is still widely used in Solo II and Autocross events. Like all F500 engines, except for the AMW, the Kawasaki was originally produced as a snowmobile engine. It {{has been out of}} production since the early 1980s. Parts for these engines are becoming more difficult to find.|$|R

50|$|Launched in 1979 and {{designed}} by Triumph's Tom Higham, the Triumph T140D Bonneville Special was a styling exercise {{inspired by the}} Yamaha XS 650 Special. Several T140D features such as the top-mounted rear disc caliper and revised grabrail became standard on the T140E. The Bonneville Specials were finished in gold-pinstriped black with a stepped seat and seven-spoke US-made Lester mag-alloy wheels and a <b>tuned</b> two-into-one <b>exhaust</b> for the US market. The T140D had polished fork sliders and a shortened chrome mudguard fixed in place by its central bracing strip.|$|R
5000|$|Renault {{abandoned}} {{plans to}} contest the World Rally Championship which it won in 1973. Instead, the factory developed a high-performance version of the 17 coupé at the Alpine Competition Factory which used many of the A110 bits to compete in [...] "selected" [...] European events. The Gordini-developed engine had two twin-choke Webers, a hot cam, an 11.5 compression ratio, big valves and <b>tuned</b> extractor <b>exhaust</b> system. The body was very light, featured fibreglass doors, boot and bonnet panels, plus plastic windows and a stripped interior. The factory said the car's weight was lowered by more than 25 percent.|$|R

5000|$|A <b>tuned</b> <b>exhaust</b> {{system is}} an exhaust system for an {{internal}} combustion engine which improves its efficiency by using precise geometry to reflect the pressure waves from the exhaust valve or port back to the valve or port {{at a particular time}} in the cycle.|$|E
50|$|A {{variable}} <b>tuned</b> <b>exhaust</b> {{system has}} been used on several motorcycles, including models by Honda, Kawasaki and Suzuki, often in combination with a variable timing exhaust port.

50|$|It is this {{phenomenon}} {{that enables the}} so-called “ram tuning” to occur, and it is what is being “tuned” by <b>tuned</b> intake and <b>exhaust</b> systems.

5000|$|The {{original}} design remit was to achieve 180 bhp using a 1.7-litre Zetec SE {{equipped with a}} turbocharger. However, due to spiralling project costs, this was not achieved and eventually the Racing Puma engineers were forced to keep their changes within a normally aspirated engine. The majority of the engine remained unchanged from the 1.7 Zetec SE used in the standard Puma. Only the camshafts, air intake (with the unique edition number engraved on it), a specially <b>tuned</b> complete <b>exhaust</b> system by Janspeed, and a revised engine management software helped to increase power by 30 hp, reducing the 0-62 mi/h km/h time to 7.8 seconds.--> ...|$|R
