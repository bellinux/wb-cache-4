Definition of <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>intestinal</b> core <b>microbiota,</b> i. e. the number and the identity of bacteria that are shared among different individuals, is currently {{one of the main}} research questions. Here we apply a high-throughput phylogenetic microarray, for a comprehensive and high-resolution microbiota analysis, and a novel computational approach in a quantitative study of the core microbiota in over 100 individuals. In the approach presented we study how the criteria for the phylotype abundance or prevalence influence the resulting core in parallel with biological variables, such as the number and health status of the study subjects. We observed that the core size is highly conditional, mostly depending on the depth of the analysis and the required prevalence of the core taxa. Moreover, the core size is also affected by biological variables, of which the health status had a larger impact than the number of studied subjects. We also introduce a computational method that estimates the expected size of the core, given the varying prevalence and abundance criteria. The approach is directly applicable to sequencing data derived from intestinal and other host-associated microbial communities, and can be modified to include more informative definitions of core microbiota. Hence, we anticipate its utilization will facilitate the conceptual definition of the core microbiota and its consequent characterization so that future studies yield conclusive views on the <b>intestinal</b> core <b>microbiota,</b> eliminating the current controversy...|$|R
40|$|Background/Aim: <b>The</b> <b>human</b> <b>intestinal</b> <b>microbiota</b> {{plays an}} {{important}} role in modulation of mucosal immune responses. To study interactions between intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) and commensal bacteria, a functional metagenomic approach was developed. One interest of metagenomics is to provide access to genomes of uncultured microbes. We aimed at identifying bacterial genes involved in regulation of NF-kappa B signaling in IECs. A high throughput cell-based screening assay allowing rapid detection of NF-kappa B modulation in IECs was established using the reporter-gene strategy to screen metagenomic libraries issued from <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>intestinal</b> <b>microbiota.</b> Methods: A plasmid containing the secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) gene under the control of NF-kappa B binding elements was stably transfected in HT- 29 cells. The reporter clone HT- 29 /kb-seap- 25 was selected and characterized. Then, a first screening of a metagenomic library from Crohn's disease patients was performed to identify NF-kappa B modulating clones. Furthermore, genes potentially involved in the effect of one stimulatory metagenomic clone were determined by sequence analysis associated to mutagenesis by transposition. Results: The two proinflammatory cytokines, TNF-alpha and IL- 1 beta, were able to activate the reporter system, translating the activation of the NF-kappa B signaling pathway and NF-kappa B inhibitors, BAY 11 - 7082, caffeic acid phenethyl ester and MG 132 were efficient. A screening of 2640 metagenomic clones led to the identification of 171 modulating clones. Among them, one stimulatory metagenomic clone, 52 B 7, was further characterized. Sequence analysis revealed that its metagenomic DNA insert might belong to a new Bacteroides strain and we identified 2 loci encoding an ABC transport system and a putative lipoprotein potentially involved in 52 B 7 effect on NF-kappa B. Conclusions: We have established a robust high throughput screening assay for metagenomic libraries derived from <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>intestinal</b> <b>microbiota</b> to study bacteria-driven NF-kappa B regulation.

The main virulence factor {{responsible for the}} more serious disease is the Shiga toxin 2 (Stx 2), which is released in the gut after oral ingestion of the organism. Although it is accepted {{that the amount of}} Stx 2 produced by E. coli O 157 :H 7 in the gut is critical for the development of disease, the eukaryotic or prokaryotic gut factors that modulate Stx 2 synthesis are largely unknown. In this study, we examined the influence of prokaryotic molecules released by a complex human microbiota on Stx 2 synthesis by E. coli O 157 :H 7. Stx 2 synthesis was assessed after growth of E. coli O 157 :H 7 in cecal contents of gnotobiotic rats colonized with human microbiota or in conditioned medium having supported the growth of complex human microbiota.

Nevertheless, even with well-characterised ecosystems like <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>intestinal</b> <b>microbiota</b> {{it is challenging to}} assign genus and species level taxonomy to 16 S rRNA amplicon reads. A part of the explanation may lie in the sheer size of the search space where competition from a multitude of highly similar sequences may not allow reliable assignation at low taxonomic levels. However, when studying a particular environment such as the human intestine, {{it can be argued that}} a reference database comprising only sequences that are native to the environment would be sufficient, effectively reducing the search space.

Four months after inoculation, enumeration of coprostanoligenic bacteria, fecal coprostanol levels and composition of the fecal microbial communities were studied in gnotobiotic rats and {{compared with those of}} <b>the</b> <b>human</b> donors. Combination of culture (most probable number enumeration of active bacteria) and biochemical approaches (extraction followed by gas chromatography of sterols) showed that gnotobiotic rats harbored a coprostanoligenic bacterial population level and exhibited coprostanoligenic activities similar to those of <b>the</b> corresponding <b>human</b> donor. On <b>the</b> other hand, molecular approaches (whole-cell hybridization with fluorescently labeled 16 S rRNA-targeted oligonucleotide probes, and temporal temperature gradient gel electrophoresis of bacterial 16 S rRNA gene amplicons) demonstrated that gnotobiotic rats reproduced a stable microbial community, close to <b>the</b> <b>human</b> donor microbiota at the group or genus levels but different at the dominant species level. These results suggest that the gnotobiotic rat model can be used to explore <b>the</b> still unknown <b>human</b> <b>intestinal</b> <b>microbiota</b> involved in luminal cholesterol metabolism, including regulation of expression of its activity and impact on health...|$|R

Over the past five years, {{an increasing number of}} studies have clearly described the importance of this highly metabolically active commensal bacterium as a component of the healthy human microbiota. Changes in the abundance of F. prausnitzii have been linked to dysbiosis in several human disorders. Administration of F. prausnitzii strain A 2 - 165 and its culture supernatant have been shown to protect against 2, 4, 6 -trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS) -induced colitis in mice. Here, we discuss the role of F. prausnitzii in balancing immunity in the intestine and the mechanisms involved...|$|E
40|$|SummaryThe Bacteroides are a numerically {{dominant}} genus of <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>intestinal</b> <b>microbiota.</b> These organisms harbor a rare bacterial pathway for {{incorporation of}} exogenous fucose into capsular polysaccharides and glycoproteins. The infrequency of glycoprotein synthesis by bacteria prompted {{a more detailed}} analysis of this process. Here, we demonstrate that Bacteroides fragilis has a general O-glycosylation system. The proteins targeted for glycosylation include those predicted {{to be involved in}} protein folding, protein-protein interactions, peptide degradation as well as surface lipoproteins. Protein glycosylation is central to the physiology of B. fragilis and is necessary for the organism to competitively colonize the mammalian intestine. We provide evidence that general O-glycosylation systems are conserved among intestinal Bacteroides species and likely contribute to the predominance of Bacteroides in the human intestine...|$|E
40|$|<b>The</b> <b>human</b> <b>intestinal</b> <b>microbiota</b> {{plays a major}} {{beneficial}} role in immune {{development and}} resistance to pathogens. The use of antibiotics, however, can cause the spread of antibiotic resistance genes within the resident intestinal microbiota. Important vectors for this are integrons. This review therefore focuses on the integrons in non-pathogenic bacteria as a potential source for the development and persistence of multidrug resistance. Integrons are a group of genetic elements which are assembly platforms that can capture specific gene cassettes and express them. Integrons in pathogenic bacteria have been extensively investigated, while integrons in the intestinal microbiota have not yet gained much attention. Knowledge of the integrons residing in the microbiota, however, can potentially aid in controlling the spread of antibiotic resistance genes to pathogens...|$|E
40|$|Human flora-associated (HFA) mice {{have been}} {{considered}} a tool for studying the ecology and metabolism of <b>intestinal</b> bacteria in <b>humans,</b> although they have some limitations as a model. Shifts in dominant species of microbiota in HFA mice after <b>the</b> administration of <b>human</b> <b>intestinal</b> <b>microbiota</b> was revealed by 16 S rRNA gene sequence and terminal {{restriction fragment length polymorphism}} (T-RFLP) analyses. Characteristic terminal restriction fragments (T-RFs) were quantified as the proportion of total peak area of all T-RFs. Only the proportion of the T-RF peak at bp 366, identified as the Gammmaproteobacteria group and the family Coriobacteriaceae, was reduced in this study. Increased T-RFs over time at bp 56, 184, and 196 were affiliated with the Clostridium group. However, most of the isolated bacteria with unique population shifts were phylotypes. The vertical transmission of the <b>intestinal</b> <b>microbiota</b> of the mouse offspring was also investigated by dendrogram analysis derived from the similarity of T-RFLP patterns among samples. As a result, the <b>intestinal</b> <b>microbiota</b> of HFA mice and their offspring reflected the composition of individual <b>human</b> <b>intestinal</b> bacteria with some modifications. Moreover, we revealed that human-derived lactobacilli (HDL), which {{have been considered}} difficult to colonize in the HFA mouse intestine in previous studies based on culture methods, could be detected in the HFA mouse intestine by using a lactic acid bacterium-specific primer and HDL-specific primers. Our results indicate that the <b>intestinal</b> <b>microbiota</b> of HFA mice represents a limited sample of bacteria from <b>the</b> <b>human</b> source and are selected by unknown interactions between the host and bacteria...|$|R
40|$|Background: Bacteroides sp. are {{dominant}} {{constituents of}} <b>the</b> <b>human</b> and animal <b>intestinal</b> <b>microbiota</b> require porphyrins (i. e., protoporphyrin IX or iron-charged heme) for normal growth. The highly stimulatory effect of porphyrins on Bacteroides growth {{lead us to}} propose their use as a potential determinant of bacterial colonization. However, showing a role for porphryins would require sensitive detection methods that work in complex samples such as feces. Results: We devised a highly sensitive semi-quantitative porphyrin detection method (detection limit 1 - 4 ng heme or PPIX) {{that can be used}} to assay pure or complex biological samples, based on Bacteroides growth stimulation. The test revealed that healthy colonized or non-colonized murine and human hosts provide porphyrins in feces, which stimulate Bacteroides growth. In addition, a common microbiota constituent, Escherichia coli, is shown to be a porphyrin donor, suggesting a novel basis for intestinal bacterial interactions. Conclusions: A highly sensitive method to detect porphyrins based on bacterial growth is devised and is functional in complex biological samples. Host feces, independently of their microbiota, and E. coli, which are present in the intestine, are shown to be porphryin donors. The role of porphyrins as key bioactive molecules can now be assessed for their impact on Bacteroides and other bacterial populations in the gut...|$|R
