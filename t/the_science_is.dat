500|$|In February 2004, the Union of Concerned Scientists {{published}} a report accusing the Bush administration of manipulating science for political purposes, listing more than 20 alleged incidents of censoring scientific results or applying {{a litmus test}} in the appointment of supposedly scientific advisory panel members.

[...] The Union of Concerned Scientists issued a revised version of their report after Marburger's statement was published. Marburger also called the report's conclusions illusory {{and the result of}} focusing on unrelated incidents within a vast government apparatus, and attributed the controversy as being related to the upcoming elections. It was noted that Marburger enjoyed close personal relationships with President Bush, White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card and Office of Management and Budget Director Joshua Bolten, attesting to his active involvement within the administration.|$|E

2500|$|The {{poles of}} the Earth are more {{sensitive}} to {{any change in the}} planet's climate {{than the rest of the}} planet. [...] In the face of ongoing global warming, the poles are warming faster than lower latitudes. [...] The primary cause of this phenomenon is ice-albedo feedback, whereby melting ice uncovers darker land or ocean beneath, which then absorbs more sunlight, causing more heating. The loss of the Arctic sea ice may represent a tipping point in global warming, when 'runaway' climate change starts, but on this point <b>the</b> <b>science</b> <b>is</b> not yet settled. According to a 2015 study, based on computer modelling of aerosols in the atmosphere, up to 0.5 degrees Celsius of the warming observed in the Arctic between 1980 and 2005 is due to aerosol reductions in Europe.|$|E
2500|$|Reconciliation ecology is {{the branch}} of ecology which studies ways to {{encourage}} biodiversity in human-dominated ecosystems. Michael Rosenzweig first articulated the concept in his book Win-Win Ecology, based {{on the theory that}} there is not enough area for all of earth’s biodiversity to be saved within designated nature preserves. Therefore, humans should increase biodiversity in human-dominated landscapes. By managing for biodiversity in ways that do not decrease human utility of the system, it is a [...] "win-win" [...] situation for both human use and native biodiversity. <b>The</b> <b>science</b> <b>is</b> based in the ecological foundation of human land-use trends and species-area relationships. It has many benefits beyond protection of biodiversity, and there are numerous examples of it around the globe. Aspects of reconciliation ecology can already be found in management legislation, but there are challenges in both public acceptance and ecological success of reconciliation attempts.|$|E

He supported the repeal of the Minerals Resource Rent Tax and carbon tax, but opposed the Abbott Government's proposed paid parental leave and [...] "direct action" [...] on climate change schemes as [...] "bad in principle" [...] and [...] "a waste of taxpayers' money", respectively. The LDP's position on climate change is that the scientific evidence is not yet [...] "compelling" [...] and that [...] "changes in human activity could realistically reverse those consequences", but the party [...] "would favour market-based options" [...] if <b>the</b> <b>science</b> <b>is</b> confirmed by further study. Notably, Leyonhjelm has proposed charging a fee for permanent residency in Australia, as a way of discouraging people smuggling. He also supports same-sex marriage, and the decriminalisation of marijuana and assisted suicide. In his [...] "Agribuzz" [...] column, he generally advocates deregulating the Australian agriculture industry, including removing barriers to free trade, genetically modified organisms, and foreign ownership of Australian land.|$|E

60|$|These {{facts are}} {{correctly}} {{indicated by the}} expression tendency. All laws of causation, in consequence of their liability to be counteracted, require to be stated in words affirmative of tendencies only, and not of actual results. In those sciences of causation which have an accurate nomenclature, there are special words which signify a tendency to the particular effect with which <b>the</b> <b>science</b> <b>is</b> conversant; thus pressure, in mechanics, is synonymous with tendency to motion, and forces are not reasoned on as causing actual motion, but as exerting pressure. A similar improvement in terminology would be very salutary in many other branches of science.|$|E
