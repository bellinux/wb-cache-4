5|$|Von Neumann {{founded the}} field of game theory as a {{mathematical}} discipline. Von Neumann proved his minimax theorem in 1928. This theorem establishes that in zero-sum games with perfect information (i.e. in which players know at each time all moves <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> <b>place</b> so far), there exists a pair of strategies for both players that allows each to minimize his maximum losses, hence the name minimax. When examining every possible strategy, a player must consider all the possible responses of his adversary. The player then plays out the strategy {{that will result in}} the minimization of his maximum loss.|$|E
5|$|Interferometric {{synthetic}} aperture radar (InSAR) is a radar technique used in geodesy and remote sensing. Satellite {{synthetic aperture}} radar images of a geographic feature are taken on separate days, and changes <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> <b>place</b> between radar images taken on the separate days are recorded as fringes similar to those obtained in holographic interferometry. The technique can monitor centimeter- to millimeter-scale deformation resulting from earthquakes, volcanoes and landslides, and also has uses in structural engineering, in particular for the monitoring of subsidence and structural stability. Fig20 shows Kilauea, an active volcano in Hawaii. Data acquired using the space shuttle Endeavour's X-band Synthetic Aperture Radar on April 13, 1994 and October 4, 1994 were used to generate interferometric fringes, which were overlaid on the X-SAR image of Kilauea.|$|E

25|$|Discussion {{around the}} Law and its wording {{constantly}} reappears on {{private and public}} agendas in Israel and in the Diaspora. The Knesset has repeatedly debated proposals to amend the Law of Return, and it has indeed been amended {{a number of times}} over the years. These modifications reflect the changes <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> <b>place</b> in Israeli society, the shifts <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> <b>place</b> in political dialogue both inside Israel itself, and the political discourse between Israel and the Diaspora. The present law constitutes an expression of permanent trends {{as well as of the}} Israeli legislative system's ability to adapt itself to changing circumstances.|$|E

Several patient and therapist factors appear to predict suitability for different psychotherapies.|$|E

25|$|Despite all {{the legal}} changes <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> <b>place</b> since the 1940s and {{especially}} in the 1960s (see Desegregation), the United States remains, to some degree, a segregated society, with housing patterns, school enrollment, church membership, employment opportunities, and even college admissions all reflecting significant de facto segregation. Supporters of affirmative action argue that the persistence of such disparities reflects either racial discrimination or the persistence of its effects.|$|E
