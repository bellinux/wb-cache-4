40|$|Abstract. By weakly {{ambiguous}} (finite) transducers we mean those transducers that, although being ambiguous, may {{be viewed}} to be at arm’s length from unambiguity. We define input-unambiguous (IU) and input-deterministic (ID) transducers, and transducers with finite codomain (FC). IU <b>transductions</b> are characterized by nondeterministic bimachines and ID <b>transductions</b> can be represented as a composition of sequential functions and finite substitutions. FC <b>transductions</b> are recognizable and can be expressed as finite unions of subsequential func-tions. We place these families along with uniformly ambiguous (UA) and finitely ambiguous (FA) <b>transductions</b> in a hierarchy of ambiguity. Fi-nally, we show that restricted nondeterministic bimachines characterize FA <b>transductions.</b> Perhaps {{the most important aspect}} of this work con-sists in defining nondeterministic bimachines and describing their power by linking them with weakly ambiguous finite transducers (IU and FA). ...|$|R
40|$|Two {{classes of}} tree {{transducers}} (finite-state automata which read trees and output trees) are studied: “top-down” transducers, which read trees from the root toward the leaves, and “bottom-up” transducers, which read trees from the leaves toward the root. The closure properties of each class under composition are investigated, and some decomposition theorems are presented. It is {{shown that the}} two classes can be decomposed into the same two simple classes of <b>transductions.</b> Consequently, for every n, the composition of n <b>transductions</b> in one direction can always be realized by the composition of n + 1 <b>transductions</b> in the other direction.

5|$|Enzymes serve a {{wide variety}} of {{functions}} inside living organisms. They are indispensable for signal <b>transduction</b> and cell regulation, often via kinases and phosphatases. They also generate movement, with myosin hydrolyzing ATP to generate muscle contraction, and also transport cargo around the cell as part of the cytoskeleton. Other ATPases in the cell membrane are ion pumps involved in active transport. Enzymes are also involved in more exotic functions, such as luciferase generating light in fireflies. Viruses can also contain enzymes for infecting cells, such as the HIV integrase and reverse transcriptase, or for viral release from cells, like the influenza virus neuraminidase.|$|E
5|$|In {{ordinary}} circumstances, <b>transduction,</b> conjugation, {{and transformation}} involve transfer of DNA between individual bacteria {{of the same}} species, but occasionally transfer may occur between individuals of different bacterial species and this may have significant consequences, such as the transfer of antibiotic resistance. In such cases, gene acquisition from other bacteria or the environment is called horizontal gene transfer and may be common under natural conditions. Gene transfer is particularly important in antibiotic resistance as it allows the rapid transfer of resistance genes between different pathogens.|$|E
5|$|Many {{proteins}} {{are involved}} in the process of cell signaling and signal <b>transduction.</b> Some proteins, such as insulin, are extracellular proteins that transmit a signal from the cell in which they were synthesized to other cells in distant tissues. Others are membrane proteins that act as receptors whose main function is to bind a signaling molecule and induce a biochemical response in the cell. Many receptors have a binding site exposed on the cell surface and an effector domain within the cell, which may have enzymatic activity or may undergo a conformational change detected by other proteins within the cell.|$|E
