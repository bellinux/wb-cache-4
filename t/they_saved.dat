5|$|In the 1630s, {{the texts}} of these annals were {{compiled}} into a single, enormous compendium, known as the Annals of the Four Masters. In the process, the authors sometimes modified the chronology and content {{of some of the}} materials, and is thus chronologically untrustworthy. However, it is recognised that <b>they</b> <b>saved</b> for posterity material that would otherwise have been lost, and the entry contains the longest annalistic account of the battle.|$|E
5|$|In the 2012–13 Iraqi Premier League, {{under the}} {{management}} of Nazar Ashraf, Al-Talaba returned to their poor performance of the 2010–11 season, finishing in the 14th place with 35 points, only one point away from relegation, with only nine wins, eight draws, and 17 losses. <b>They</b> <b>saved</b> the club from being relegated in the 33rd round against Al-Naft where they won 2–1 and also because of Al-Kahraba's loss to Zakho in the last round. Al-Talaba passed the round of 32 of the 2012–13 Iraq FA Cup where they were up against Al-Zawra'a, drawing 0–0 in the first leg and winning 3–1 in the second leg before the tournament was abandoned.|$|E
5|$|The moral {{defense of}} the attacks on Japanese cities rests on an {{argument}} that <b>they</b> <b>saved</b> lives by shortening the war. The USSBS concluded {{that the effects of}} strategic bombing and blockade would have forced Japan to surrender by the end of 1945 even if atomic bombs had not been used and the Soviet Union had remained neutral. Historian E. Bartlett Kerr supported this assessment, and argued that the firebombing of Japan's major cities was the key factor motivating Hirohito's decision to end the war. American historian Barrett Tillman has also written that area attacks were unavoidable because, owing to the limitations of their bombsight and the high winds common over Japan, the B-29s were incapable of bombing individual targets without also causing widespread damage to surrounding areas.|$|E

5|$|Turley {{began working}} as a {{financial}} planner in 1957, by selling life insurance. He also operated a bowling alley in Bel Air, Maryland, and an insurance firm in Baltimore. In 1977, Turley joined with Arthur L. Williams, Jr. and five others to found A. L. Williams & Associates, an insurance company. At A. L. Williams, agents advised clients to purchase term life insurance, rather than cash value life insurance, and invest the money <b>they</b> <b>saved</b> in mutual funds. The company became Primerica Financial Services, and was later bought out by Citigroup in 1989. He retired from the business in 2001, and sold half of his business to his son and the other half to Lynn Webb, a senior national sales director.|$|E
5|$|Grace's first {{match was}} for the United South of England Eleven (USEE) against Twenty of Rochdale from Thursday, 2 May to Saturday, 4 May at Butcher's Meadow in Rochdale. The match was drawn after USEE had been behind on first innings. Although <b>they</b> <b>saved</b> the game, largely because Grace scored 57 in the second innings, {{it was not an}} auspicious {{performance}} by a team that included W. G. and Fred Grace along with five players who had taken part in the inaugural Test series in Australia the previous year: Henry Charlwood, Harry Jupp, James Lillywhite, Billy Midwinter and James Southerton. From Rochdale, Grace travelled by train to London for his next fixture on Monday, 6 May and Tuesday, 7 May which was for MCC at Lord's against a team called the Colts of England. It was another odds match with 11 against 22 and another draw. Grace made scores of 15 and 9. His team included A. N. Hornby, Alfred Shaw and Fred Morley.|$|E

25|$|The Russians {{probably}} lost {{one-third of}} their cavalry and admitted {{the loss of}} 2,114 foot soldiers. The French claimed 9–12 guns and 40 caissons captured while the Russians said <b>they</b> <b>saved</b> two cannons. The French cavalry commanders reported losing 150 horsemen and Gérard reported only 30 casualties. Pahlen's survivors dispersed over the French countryside. Another authority stated that Pahlen lost 2,000 men and 10 guns. The Reval and Selenginsk Regiments lost so many men that they were withdrawn to Plock in Poland to reorganize.|$|E

25|$|Boulton and Watt's {{practice}} {{was to help}} mine-owners and other customers to build engines, supplying men to erect them and some specialised parts. However, their main profit from their patent was derived from charging a licence fee to the engine owners, based {{on the cost of}} the fuel <b>they</b> <b>saved.</b> The greater fuel efficiency of their engines meant that they were most attractive in areas where fuel was expensive, particularly Cornwall, for which three engines were ordered in 1777, for the Wheal Busy, Ting Tang, and Chacewater mines.|$|E
25|$|The {{rules of}} the race are fairly similar to the actual race. Teams receive money, fly to a {{location}} and complete various tasks.

However, teams all leave the Pit Stop at the same time. The tasks are represented by a large collection of minigames.|$|E

25|$|At least 540 Navajos {{served in}} the Marine Corps during World War II, about 400 of whom were trained as code talkers. Because many of them lacked birth certificates, it was {{impossible}} to verify the age of some recruits. After the war it was revealed that boys as young as fifteen had enlisted. Navajo code talkers fought in every major campaign of the Pacific theater between 1942 and 1945; from Guadalcanal to Okinawa. <b>They</b> <b>saved</b> countless lives with their simple transmissions and also helped hasten the war's end. Their code was never broken and continued to be used by American forces during the Korean War and {{at the beginning of the}} Vietnam War.|$|E

When Susan {{fell in love with the}} human resistance fighter David Campbell, the Doctor left her behind to allow her to build a life for herself on 22nd century Earth (The Dalek Invasion of Earth), although he promised to return some day. The Doctor, Ian and Barbara were then joined by Vicki, whom <b>they</b> <b>saved</b> in The Rescue from the planet Dido.|$|E
25|$|The {{order of}} the Knights of St. John was {{originally}} established to set up outposts along the route to the Holy Land, to assist pilgrims going in either direction. Owing to the many confrontations that took place, one of their main tasks was to provide medical assistance, and even today the eight-pointed cross is still in wide use in ambulances and first aid organisations. In return for the many lives <b>they</b> <b>saved,</b> the Order received many newly conquered territories {{that had to be}} defended. Together with the need to defend the pilgrims in their care, this gave rise to the strong military wing of the knights. Over time, the Order became strong and rich. From hospitallers first and military second, these priorities reversed. Since much of the territory they covered was around the Mediterranean region, they became notable seamen.|$|E

25|$|In 1938, the {{unemployed}} Oskar Schindler joined the Nazi Party {{and moved to}} Kraków, leaving his wife in Zwittau. There he gained ownership of an enamelware factory that had lain idle and in bankruptcy {{for many years and}} that he renamed Deutsche Emaillewaren-Fabrik, where he principally employed Jewish workers because they were the cheapest. However, he soon realized the true brutalities of the Nazis, and the Schindlers started protecting his Jewish laborers. Initially, <b>they</b> <b>saved</b> the workers by bribing the SS guards; later, they listed their employees as essential factory workers, manufacturing munitions for the Reich. When conditions worsened and they started running out of money, she sold her jewels to buy food, clothes, and medicine. She looked after sick workers in a secret sanatorium in the factory in Brünnlitz with medical equipment purchased on the black market.|$|E
25|$|On 16 November 2011 SIS {{warned the}} {{national}} transitional council in Benghazi after discovering details of planned strikes, said foreign secretary William Hague. 'The agencies obtained firm intelligence, {{were able to}} warn the NTC of the threat, and the attacks were prevented,' he said. In a rare speech on the intelligence agencies, he praised the key role played by SIS and GCHQ in bringing Gaddafi's 42-year dictatorship to an end, describing them as 'vital assets' with a 'fundamental and indispensable role' in keeping the nation safe. 'They worked to identify key political figures, develop contacts with the emerging opposition and provide political and military intelligence. 'Most importantly, <b>they</b> <b>saved</b> lives,' he said. The speech follows criticism that SIS had been {{too close to the}} Libyan regime and was involved in the extraordinary rendition of anti-Gaddafi activists. Mr Hague also defended controversial proposals for secrecy in civil court involving intelligence material.|$|E
25|$|Paget's {{migration}} from England {{took him into}} a war zone, as the Dutch {{were in the midst}} of the Eighty Years' War to secure their independence from Spain. It also took him into Dutch employment, although initially under English direction. For two years Paget was chaplain to the English troops fighting under Sir John Ogle and Sir Horace Vere. Ogle commanded one of four units and was second-in-command of the whole force, while Vere commanded another and had overall leadership of the English contingents, which since 1598 had been paid by the Dutch and formed part of the Dutch army. 1605 saw the English troops fighting well outside the Netherlands, alongside a Scottish force as well as Dutch troops, at Mülheim an der Ruhr, where <b>they</b> <b>saved</b> the day and suffered heavy casualties. Paget must have had a strenuous period of pastoral work and preaching in such difficult circumstances.|$|E
