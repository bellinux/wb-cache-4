Zoologist Jonathan Kingdon considered the chirp of the cheetah as similar <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>soft</b> roar of the lion, and its churr as the latter's loud roar. The churr, is staccato and has a shorter range than the chirp. A study showed that churrs comprise 3to 15 separate pulses and last 0.1to 1.3 seconds.|$|E
5|$|Operations {{along the}} Vimy Ridge were {{accompanied}} by extensive underground excavations. The Arras–Vimy sector was conducive to tunnelling owing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>soft,</b> porous yet extremely stable nature of the chalk underground. Underground warfare had been conducted on the Vimy sector since 1915. Bavarian engineers had blown twenty mines in the sector by March 1915. By early 1916, German miners had gained an advantage over their French counterparts. British tunnelling companies of the Royal Engineers took over progressively from the French between February and May 1916.|$|E
5|$|Hamilton {{was again}} fastest {{in the second}} {{practice}} on Friday afternoon, while Rosberg was unable to partake due to a water leak on his car. Hamilton's time of 1:31.660 was over three-tenths of a second faster than that of second places Daniel Ricciardo. Fellow Red Bull driver Max Verstappen was third, ahead of Vettel, all within one second of the fastest time. Ferrari split their practice strategy, with Kimi Räikkönen running the hard-compound tyre early in the session, while Vettel used the softer medium compound, before both switched <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>soft</b> tyres. At their home race, McLaren had a mixed session. While Fernando Alonso placed a good sixth, teammate Jenson Button had {{to take to the}} garage for repairs twice, before coming out on track again late in the session, eventually setting the ninth fastest time. Daniil Kvyat was 13th fastest, but damaged his front wing when he went over a kerb at Club corner.|$|E

Räikkönen's running was interrupted for a while when he was called back into the pitlane to investigate a fuel system problem, but {{was able to get}} back out. Fernando Alonso was seventh fastest for McLaren, but needed a replacement of his car's plank after running wide over artificial grass surrounding the track. His teammate, Jenson Button, also experienced problems, having to stop {{at the end of the}} pitlane early in the session with an electrical issue. Renault's problem from the first session continued: Jolyon Palmer, back in his car in place of Ocon, suffered a tyre failure on the start-finish straight, bringing out red flags in the process. Renault and tyre supplier Pirelli were left puzzled over the failure, as in this incident, no sign of a cut from debris was found.|$|E

Examples include biting the cheek, tongue, or lips, or rubbing a fingernail, pen, or toothpick inside the mouth. Tearing (and subsequent ulceration) of the upper labial frenum may be a sign of child abuse (non-accidental injury).

25|$|According to George Orwell, {{coal miners}} could develop {{characteristic}} tattoos owing to coal dust getting into wounds. This can also occur with substances like gunpowder. Similarly, a traumatic tattoo {{occurs when a}} substance such as asphalt is rubbed into a wound {{as the result of}} some kind of accident or trauma. These are particularly difficult to remove as they tend to be spread across several layers of skin, and scarring or permanent discoloration is almost unavoidable depending on the location. An amalgam tattoo is when amalgam particles are implanted in <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>soft</b> tissues of the mouth, usually the gums, during dental filling placement or removal; another example of such accidental tattoos {{is the result of a}} deliberate or accidental stabbing with a pencil or pen, leaving graphite or ink beneath the skin.|$|E
25|$|Muskox Ovibos moschatus (umingmar, maskar in Nunivak Cup'ig). Alaska's {{original}} muskox were hunted {{to extinction}} in the mid-1800s - perhaps by whalers and others. They had originally ranged Alaska's arctic and western coastal tundra. In 1935-1936 the U.S. Biological Survey brought 31 muskoxen from Greenland to Nunivak Island {{in an effort}} to reestablish the species in Alaska and as a means for subsistence living. Because the animals were federally protected, and since the Nunivaarmiut were afraid of them, they added nothing to the local economy until 40 years later. when Nunivak women learned to make fine items of clothing from the underwool of the muskox (qiviut). The muskox are large animals that look a lot like bison, but have wool like sheep, and has a two-layered coat, and qiviut refers specifically <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>soft</b> underwool beneath the longer outer wool. The first modern hunting season was in 1975. Today the Nunivak herd numbers around 600 animals, down from a high of around 700 animals in 1968.|$|E

Hamilton set the fastest lap of the race at one minute and 50.417 seconds on lap 39 to pull out a 5.8 second advantage over Vettel. Sutil's car developed a water leak and retired two laps later to prevent the risk of his engine failing. Button drew closer to Bottas while Hülkenberg moved ahead of Kvyat for 11th position. Pérez took advantage of a battle between Ericsson and Kvyat and overtook both drivers for 14th on lap 49.|$|E

When the lamellae are at ϕ= 90 ° with the loading axis, the deformation is carried out mainly by systems of the transverse type which should have high critical stresses while parallel systems should have low CRSS and mixed type systems are expected to be in between.

25|$|In 1896 the Midland Railway {{obtained}} {{an act of}} Parliament authorising it {{to build}} a through railway from its main line at Royston to connect with its existing tracks at Bradford Foster Square.

The Midland's cash offer of £6,000 {{for the purchase of}} Ripley property was unacceptable to the Ripley Trust who also felt that there was a direct threat <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>soft</b> water supply to the dye works. An Arbitration hearing in 1900 awarded the Ripley Trust £14,000 for 3 acres of land in Ripley Ville. This included 4 terraces of houses and a strip of land across Ladywell Fields. After another Act of Parliament in 1912 and several changes of plan the Midland Railway decided, in the changed economic circumstances after the Great War, to abandon the scheme. Bradford Corporation (who were wholly in favour of the scheme and deeply regretted its abandonment) agreed to buy all the land acquired by the Midland. This included, in addition to much land in the centre of the city, the four terraces of houses in Ripley Ville and Ladywell fields. Ladywell Fields were designated as a public park. Management of the four terraces of houses passed to the Borough's housing department.|$|E
25|$|As {{dental plaque}} or biofilm accumulates on the teeth near {{and below the}} gums, there is {{a shift in the}} {{composition}} of the biofilm from essentially streptococcus to an actinomyces dominant plaque. Motile bacteria is also seen more frequently. As this happens, inflammation sets in the gingiva. Initially, this takes the form of gingivitis, which represents inflammation confined <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>soft</b> tissues above the bone level. Inflammation in the gingiva can remain at the gingivitis level for a long period and will not progress to periodontitis, unless in the presence of local conditions or generalized host susceptibility. When this shift occurs, the immune system's response to plaque accumulation shifts from a predominantly neutrophilic mediated response to lymphocytic and plasma cell-mediated response. Clinically, the gingiva presents swelling, redness and a tendency to bleed. This modifies the environment, leading to changes in the composition of the biofilm itself. As this happens, a predominantly gram-negative environment is established, with periodontal pathogens emerging. These include A. actinomycetemcomitans, the red complex bacteria (P. gingivalis, T. forsythia, T. denticola) {{and to a lesser extent}} the orange complex bacteria (F. nucleatum, P. micros, P. intermedia, P. nigrecens, E. nodatum and S. constellates). Strongest bacterial association to chronic periodontitis is with P. gingivalis. Numerous virulence factors have been identified for this pathogen. This allows P. gingivalis to elude defense mechanism and perpetuate inflammation inside the periodontium. Prolonged inflammation in the periodontium leads to an apical shift in the attachment of the gingiva to the tooth with deepening pockets and bone loss around the teeth. Untreated periodontitis progresses unevenly over time but results in loss of function, tissue destruction, and tooth loss.|$|E
