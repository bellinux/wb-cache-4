Selected LAB (LAB 1821) were Gram-positive, rods, catalase negative, and were identified to be Lactobacillus plantarum {{based on their}} biochemical characteristics and a 16 S rRNA analysis. Fresh rice straw was ensiled with two isolated LAB (1821 and 1841), two commercial inoculants (HM/F and P 1132) and no additive as a control. Results After 2 months of storage at ambient temperature, rice straw silages <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> <b>additives</b> were well-preserved, the pH values and butyric and acetic acid contents were lower, and the lactic acid content and lactic/acetic acid ratio were higher {{than those in the}} control (p 0. 05) effect on acid detergent fiber or neutral detergent fiber contents.

Formic acid (3 ml/kg) or {{lactic acid bacteria}} (8 · 10 5 /g) with cellulolytic enzymes were applied only to forages with low and intermediate DM levels. Forages were ensiled in laboratory silos (1700 ml) and were stored at 25 °C for 30 or 90 days. After 90 days of storage, L. monocytogenes could not be detected in any silo, except one with the high dry matter grass without additive. After 30 days of storage, between 10 2 and 10 6 cfu L. monocytogenes /g silage were isolated from the untreated silages. Increasing the DM content from 200 to 540 g/kg did not reduce listeria counts possibly because of the lower production of fermentation acids (higher pH). In silages <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> <b>additives,</b> counts of L. monocytogenes were always lower than in silages without additive. In wet silages (DM 200 g/kg) both additives were effective, but in the wilted silages (DM 430 g/kg) only the bacterial additive reduced listeria counts below detection level.

Twenty-four Holstein cows were grouped in blocks of three cows, according to parity order and milk production level, in multiple 3 × 3 Latin Square design to evaluate three types of ration (63 % roughage and 37 % concentrate in dry matter - DM) : ration with silage treated with urea (5. 0 g/kg of fresh forage - FF) + sodium benzoate (0. 5 g/kg FF); ration with silage inoculated with Lactobacillus buchneri (5 × 104 cfu/g FF); ration with fresh sugarcane. Each evaluation period consisted of two weeks for adaptation and one week for data collection. Cows fed rations with silages treated with urea + benzoate and L. buchneri showed lower DM intake (18. 5 vs 21. 4 kg/day) and lower milk production (17. 4 vs 18. 6 kg/day) in comparison to those fed fresh forage ration. Fat content was higher in the milk of cows fed silage inoculated with L. buchneri compared to cows in the fresh forage group resulting in similar 3. 5 % fat corrected milk (FCM) among cows in both groups. Cows fed ration with silage treated with urea + benzoate presented intermediate fat content in milk but inferior FCM production compared to animals fed fresh sugarcane.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to study the conditions that maximize the formation of char when sugar cane bagasse (SCB) is pyrolysed. It has been proposed that char produced from biomass may be crushed and then suspended in water to produce a char-water fuel suitable as a heavy oil replacement. Experiments were conducted by thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) and Fourier transfer infrared spectrometry (FTIR) to measure the effect of the chemical additives diammonium phosphate (DAP) or monoammonium phosphate (MAP) on the mass-loss processes of SCB when heated between 100 °C and 700 °C under nitrogen. The additives were impregnated on the SCB as aqueous solutions at concentrations of between 0. 01 M and 1. 0 M. For untreated bagasse, char yield was 18 wt % at 400 °C and 16. 5 wt % at 700 °C. For treated SCB, it was observed that the additives initiated mass loss at lower temperatures and produced significantly larger yields of char than untreated bagasse. When heated to 450 °C, the char yield increased with additive concentration. If heated above 450 °C, another mass loss occurred between 450 °C and 600 °C, but only for those SCB samples <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> <b>additives</b> at concentrations greater than 0. 1 M. Thus, when heated to 700 °C the maximum yield of char occurred for SCB sample treated with 0. 1 M additives. Analyses of the evolved pyrolysis gases using FTIR showed that treated SCB, at concentrations greater than 0. 1 M DAP or MAP, contained less hydrocarbon species and were enriched in water consistent with the catalytic degradation of the SCB. When treated with higher concentrations of additives, gases that evolved at temperatures above 450 °C were rich in phosphoric acid esters and aromatic and unsaturated phosphonic acid species...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} fat content, aging time and {{additives}} application methods on color, lipid oxidation and volatiles of irradiated ground beef were determined. Two different methods, mixing or spraying, of applying ascorbic acid, alpha-tocopherol, and sesamol; ground beef with 3 different aging times; and ground beef with 3 different fat contents {{were used in}} the study. Beef patties were prepared, <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> <b>additives,</b> placed on Styrofoam trays, wrapped with oxygen permeable plastic film, treated with electron beam irradiation at 0 or 2. 5 kGy, and displayed under fluorescent light at 4 °C. Color, lipid oxidation, volatiles, oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) and carbon monoxide (CO) production were determined. Irradiation accelerated lipid oxidation, reduced beef redness and produced off-odor volatiles. Beef redness (a* values) was decreased by irradiation without any influence from the application methods, fat contents and aging times. Ascorbic acid was effective in maintaining beef redness after irradiation. Lipid oxidation was accelerated by irradiation regardless of application method or fat content. Aging, however, influenced lipid oxidation where lipid oxidation increased as aging increased. Combinations of ascorbic acid, alpha-tocopherol or sesamol were effective in slowing down lipid oxidation. Adding sesamol to the combination of ascorbic acid + alpha-tocopherol made it more effective in slowing down lipid oxidation especially during late storage. Irradiation increased total volatiles production, which was not affected by fat contents. Volatiles aldehydes were tripled in amount as beef aging increased. Beef patties treated with spray application produced more hydrocarbons and alcohols than patties treated with mixing. Ascorbic acid + alpha-tocopherol was effective in reducing the produced volatiles. ORP were reduced by irradiation without being influenced by fat contents or aging times. Beef treated with mixing application had lower ORP compared with beef treated with spraying. Ascorbic acid + alpha-tocopherol was effective in reducing ORP.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{describe}} and compare timothy (Phleum pratense L.) and red clover (Trifolium pratense L.) as forage for dairy cattle {{on the basis of}} the chemical composition and the in vitro degradation characteristics. Initially the degradation characteristics determined with an in vitro gas production technique and an in vitro filter bag technique were compared. Both techniques were found to be interesting tools for providing relevant degradation parameters for feed evaluation models. Thereafter the degradation characteristics and nutritive value of forages of timothy and red clover were described with recordings of in vitro gas production and chemical analysis. Analysis of the herbage of red clover and timothy showed that red clover contained lower concentrations of neutral detergent fibre (NDF) and had lower degradability of neutral detergent fibre (NDFD) on all harvest occasions. Red clover had on average a higher maximal fractional degradation rate (FDRmax) of the whole forage compared to timothy. The FDRmax for the NDF in red clover was not different from that in timothy. In timothy the components soluble in neutral detergent solution had a higher FDRmax compared to those in red clover. Timothy and red clover were conserved as direct cut silages with the addition of conservation additives. It was found that timothy and red clover herbage responded differently to the silage additives. Silages <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> <b>additives</b> had a shorter time until half of the gas was produced, as well as a shorter time until the maximal fractional degradation rate was reached, indicating a faster in vitro degradation compared to that of untreated silages. The use of additives improved the NDFD in silage with red clover but not that in the silage of pure timothy. The relationships between the feed characteristics and the relative silage intake in dairy cows were evaluated. It was found that the preparation technique for silage samples was important and that wet silage samples had a higher gas production and different kinetics compared to dried samples. It was concluded that chemical analysis in combination with the in vitro gas production technique can be a cost-efficient tool for relative prediction of silage intake based on feed characteristics. The predictions can be used to compose feed rations that will optimize silage intake in relation to milk production and to improve conservation management...|$|E

Lactic acid content of silages <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> FJLB was stable at 14 d of fermentation and constant until 45 d of ensiling. At 45 d of ensiling, neutral detergent fiber (NDF) and acid detergent fiber (ADF) of silage <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> cassava meal were significantly lower (p< 0. 05) than the others. In the feeding trial, the intake of silage increased (p< 0. 05) in the cow fed <b>with</b> the <b>treated</b> silage.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to explore the potential use of pulp (by-product) from coffee processing and Na-bentonite (commercial product) for minimizing the environmental risk of Zn, Pb and Cd in soil collected from a former mine and zinc-lead smelter. The effects of soil amendments on the physicochemical properties of soil, the structural and functional diversity of the soil microbiome as well as soil enzymes were investigated. Moreover, biomass of Festuca arundinacea Schreb. (cultivar Asterix) and the uptake of trace elements in plant tissues were studied. The outdoor pot set contained the following soils: control soil (initial), untreated soil (without additives) with grass cultivation and soils <b>treated</b> (<b>with</b> <b>additives)</b> with and without plant development. All of the selected parameters were measured at the beginning of the experiment (t 0), after 2 months of chemical stabilization (t 2) and at the end of the aided phytostabilization process (t 14). The obtained results indicated that both amendments efficiently immobilized the bioavailable fractions of Zn (87 - 91 %) and Cd (70 - 83 %) at t 14; however, they were characterized by a lower ability to bind Pb (33 - 50 %). Pulp and Na-bentonite drastically increased the activity of dehydrogenase (70 - and 12 -fold, respectively) at t 14, while the activities of urease, acid and alkaline phosphatases differed significantly depending on the type of material that was added into the soil. Generally, the activities of these enzymes increased; however, the increase was greater for pulp (3. 5 - 6 -fold) than for the Na-bentonite treatment (1. 3 - 2. 2 -fold) as compared to the control. Soil additives significantly influenced the composition and dynamics of the soil microbial biomass over the experiment. At the end, the contribution of microbial groups could be ordered as follows: gram negative bacteria, fungi, gram positive bacteria, actinomycetes regardless of the type of soil enrichment. Conversely, the shift in the functional diversity of the microorganisms in the treated soils mainly resulted from plant cultivation. Meanwhile, the highest biomass of plants at t 14 was collected from the soil with Na-bentonite (6. 7 g dw- 1), while it was much lower in a case of pulp treatment (1. 43 - 1. 57 g dw- 1). Moreover, the measurements of the heavy metal concentrations in the plant roots and shoots clearly indicated that the plants mainly accumulated metals in the roots but that the accumulation of individual metals depended on the soil additives. The efficiency of the accumulation of Pb, Cd and Zn by the roots was determined to be 124, 100 and 26 % higher in the soil that was enriched with Na-bentonite in comparison with the soil that was amended with pulp, respectively. The values of the soil indices (soil fertility, soil quality and soil alteration) confirmed the better improvement of soil functioning after its enrichment with the pulp than in the presence of Na-bentonite...|$|E
40|$|Thermal {{power station}} in most {{countries}} is saddled {{with the problem of}} fly ash disposal and unless suitable avenues are found for its proper use, this would pose a gigantic problem to the power sector. Disposal of huge quantities of fly ashes without proper care causes considerable impact on the environment particularly the one leading to soil and groundwater contamination. On the other hand, fly ashes have many desirable properties which can find applications in civil engineering, especially in geotechnical engineering. The pozzolanic reactivity is one of the important properties of fly ashes that enhance its application. Thought the fly ashes with self – pozzolanic property are well utilized, fly ashes with insufficient free lime, such as class F fly ashes are being grossly underutilized and they form a considerable portion of fly ashes that are disposed. Yet another factor restricting the use of fly ash is the concern about the leachability of lime under field conditions particularly under saturated or partially saturated conditions. Hence an attempt is made in this thesis, to reduce the lime leachability of class F fly ashes with different additives. Thus, selection of right amounts of additives to reduce the lime leacability is an important aspect studied in this thesis. Effect of such as strength, compressibility, and CBR value is also investigated. Another simple way to reduce the problem of disposal of fly ash is to utilize it for the construction of waste disposal sites particularly for lining solid waste disposal facilities in place of the natural clay materials which are very often procured by excavating and transporting from far off places. Also, the capacities of fly ashes to sorb heavy metal that are likely to be present in the leachates generated from the industrial wastes have been studied. Of the other factors limiting the generous use of fly ashes is the leachability of several trace elements present in them. Hence the leachability of trace metals from fly ashes under different practical situations, before and after incorporating the selected additives for improving the engineering properties of fly ashes, has been studied. The thesis is presented in 10 chapters. 	The relevant background for the studies and scope of the work is given Chapter 1. Sources of the fly ashes collected for the investigating along with their physical and chemical properties are presented in chapter 2. Two low line fly ashes are collected directly from the electronic precipitators of the thermal power plants located at Neyvelli town of the Tamil nadu and Maddanur town of Andhra Pradesh, India, named NFA and MFA respectively. MFA has greater finer particle content than NFA. The particles of MFA Have rougher surface compared to those of NFA. Both of fly ashes have predominantly quartz and mullite phase in them. The silica, total lime and carbon contents which have major influence on the pozzolanic reactivity of fly ashes vary considerably in the both the fly ashes. Lime leachability is taken as the amount of lime that is converted into soluble form (by dissociation into calcium and hydroxyl ions) under a standardized condition. It can be used to asses the long term sustainability of the strength achieved in fly ashes with lime. Lime leachability studies have been conducted on the fly ashes stabilized with different additives in specially designed moulds. Results presented in Chapter 3 showed that leachability of lime in fly ashes increases with the increase in lime content though it is not in proportion to the increase in lime content. This is because the solubility of lime is less and is independent of the total lime present. The marginal reduction in leachability is mainly due to cemented matrix of fly ash inhibiting the leaching of time. The higher the strength of the matrix the lower is the leachability. Further it is made clear that at any lime content presence of gypsum reduces the time leachability which has been attributed to the transformation of pozzolanic compounds into less soluble form than the compounds formed with lime alone. With the increase in curing period, the amount of lime that leaches from the lime-stabilized fly ashes as well as those treated with gypsum to a considerable extent. The nature of alteration does not seem to change with time as revealed by a good correlation between lime leachability ratios obtained after 7 days and 14 days of curing periods. Chapter 4 presents the results of unconfined compressive strength tests carried out on fly ashes with varying lime and gypsum contents, before soaking and also soaking in several heavy metal solutions, along with the durability to the cycle of wetting and drying. The results revealed that the strength of low lime fly ashes increases with lime content significantly up to the optimum lime content of about 2. 5 – 5 % and gradually thereafter. Addition of gypsum of 1 – 2. 5 % increases the strength of fly ashes further at any lime content. Increase in strength with gypsum, which is quite significant at lower lime contents initially, is observed for a considerable period (up to 180 days) at higher lime contents. The increase in strength is as high as 40 -fold in some instances. This increase in strength which is also more durable has been attributed to the formation of calcium – sodium – aluminium - silicate hydrate along with calcium silicate hydrate. Further, it is observed that fly ash which responds better to lime stabilization shows accelerated gain in strength due to the addition of gypsum at early curing periods than the fly ash that responds solely to lime. Decrease in lime leachability ratio is a good indication of the increased strength along with the increased durability. California Bearing Radio (CBR) values are of great significance in the utilization of fly ashes in bulk quantities for the construction of road and railway embankments and pavements. Studies conducted to determine the CBR values of fly ashes with different lime and gypsum contents after curing for different time periods are described in chapter 5. The CBR values are observed to increase with lime alone significantly up to 2. 5 % and only marginally beyond. But the increase in CRB values is considerable with gypsum at any lime content. The increase in CBR value is particularly more with 2. 5 % gypsum for fly ashes with 2. 5 % lime. The CBR values of stabilized fly ashes are generally higher for 5 mm depth of penetration than those for 2. 5 mm one due to the high stiffness of the matrix formed even at low strain levels. The loss in CBR values with soaking is relatively more at lower curing the periods due to the improper cementation of particles. Even after this significant loss in CBR values, fly ashes with 2. 5 % lime and 2. 5 % gypsum register the maximum values after curing under soaked condition. Unlike in the case of unconfined compressive strength, lime leachability values could not be well correlated with the CBR values of fly ashes with different lime and gypsum contents since many more factors influence the CBR values than those of unconfined compressive strength alone. Chapter 6. brings out the effects of addition of lime alone and lime along with gypsum on the compressibility behaviour of the fly ashes. Since the fly ashes when <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> <b>additives</b> develop strength and exhibit lower compression with the passage of time, consolidation testing with conventional duration of load increment may not be appropriate. Hence an attempt has been made to assess the minimum duration of load increment necessary to study the compressibility characteristics of such materials. Thus the compressibility behaviour of fly ashes with additives has been studied using conventional consolidation test with different durations of load increments varying from 30 minutes to 48 hours. The results indicated that 30 minutes of duration of load increment can be used to assess the compressibility behaviour of such materials. The effect of lime which reduces the compression is seen to be maximum from the results obtained with the load duration increment of 30 minutes but gradually reduce with higher duration of load increment. It has also been observed that the rate of decrease in the compressibility is maximum up to 2. 5 % lime and thereafter gradual. The compressibility of lime –treated fly ashes further reduces when gypsum is incorporated, the optimum gypsum percentage being 2. 5. This reduction in the compressibility of fly ashes enhanced by incorporating lime and gypsum makes them versatile in the construction of embankments and for structural fills, particularly reducing the time required in between laying of each lift. It has been brought out that decrease in the lime leachability decreases the compressibility of fly ashes. 	Fly ash has potential application in the construction of base liners of waste containment facilities. While most of the fly ashes improve in the strength with curing, the ranges of hydraulic conductivities they attain may often not meet the basic requirement of a liner material. Attempts to reduce the hydraulic conductivity by adding lime as gypsum along with lime to both the fly ashes are presented in chapter 7. Hydraulic conductivities of the compacted specimens have been determined in the laboratory using the falling head methods. It has been observed that the addition of gypsum reduces the hydraulic conductivity of the lime treated fly ashes. The reduction in the hydraulic conductivity of the fly ashes containing gypsum is significantly more of sample with high amounts of lime contents (as high as 1000 times) than those with lower amounts of lime. However, there is relatively more increases in the strengths of the samples with the inclusion of gypsum to the fly ashes even at lower lime contents. This {{is due to the fact}} that excess lime added to fly ash is not effectively converted in to pozzolanic compounds. Even the presence of gypsum is observed not to activate these reactions with excess lime. On the other hand the higher amount of lime in the presence of gypsum is observed to produce more cementitious compounds which block the pores in the fly ash. Amount of lime leached in the found to be directly related to the hydraulic conductivity inspite of many –fold variations in the hydraulic conductivity achieved by curing fly ash with lime and gypsum. The consequent reduction on the hydraulic conductivity of fly ash would be beneficial in reducing the leachability of trace elements in the fly ash when used as base liner. Fly ash contains trace metals and other substances in the sufficient quantities which may leach out over a period of time. The study has been extended to examine the leachability of a few selected trace metals viz., Cd, Cu, Cr, Mn, Pb and Zn from fly ash before and after incorporating additives has been reported in chapter 9. The standard laboratory leaching test for the combustion residues developed by Van der Sloot et al. has been employed to study the leachabilities of trace elements as a function of liquid to solid (L/S) ratio and pH. The leachability test were conducted on the powdered fly ash samples obtained from unconfined compressive strength tests, conducted after a curing period of 28 and 180 days. It observed that, there is a marked reduction in the relative leachabilities of trace elements present, at the end of 28 days which reduced only marginally at the end of 180 days. Chapter 9 reports the retention capacities of fly ashes for copper, lead and zinc metals ions. Various parameters like contact time, initial concentration and pH have been varied and their effect on retention mechanism studied. The retention order of metals ions, Cu+ 2 > Pb+ 2 >Zn+ 2, is observed to be the same for both the fly ashes at all pH values. The dominant mechanisms responsible for the retention are precipitation at higher pH’s as hydroxides and adsorption at lower pH’s Due to presence of silica and alumina oxide surface in fly ash. First order kinetic plots have revealed that the rate constant value increases with increase in initial concentration and pH. Langmuir adsorption isotherms have been plotted to study the maximum adsorption isotherms have been plotted to study the maximum adsorption capacities for metal ions under different conditions. The older indicates that the adsorption is predominantly by silica surface than that by alumina or iron oxide surfaces. This thesis demonstrates that incorporation of gypsum along with lime in the optimal proportions not only reduces the lime leachability but also greatly enhances the strength and CBR values, reduces the compressibility and minimizes the leaching of trace elements present in them enhancing the potential of fly ashes for many applications. Detailed conclusions are presented in chapter 10. The study greatly helps in promoting the use of fly ashes for many geotechnical and geo-environmental applications...|$|E
40|$|An attempt {{has been}} made to examine the role of fly ash content (0 - 30 %) to control {{undesirable}} strength loss in lime-treated expansive soil containing gypsum (0 - 6 %) after curing for different periods up to one year.

Presence of increasing amounts of gypsum accelerates early strength gain initially, but reduces long-term strength gain in soil-lime-fly ash mixes. Fly ash improves the strength of lime-treated gypseous soil. However, beneficial use of fly ash to improve the strength of lime treated gypseous soil depends on the amount of gypsum present in the soil and length of curing periods. Micro-analyses (XRD and SEM) revealed that the strength development is controlled by reaction products formed such as cementitious compounds and ettringite crystals...|$|R

The Pareto-ANOVA optimization method {{was used to}} obtain the optimum parameter conditions for the machining process. Experiments were carried out using oblique dry CNC turning. The machining parameters of cutting speed, feed rate and depth of cut were optimized according to surface roughness values. The results indicated that a cutting speed of 250 m/min, a feed rate of 0. 05 mm/rev, and a depth of cut of 0. 15 mm were the optimum CNC dry turning conditions. The results also indicated that Sr and Sb had {{a negative effect on}} workpiece machinability. The workpiece containing Bi exhibited the lowest surface roughness value, likely due to the formation of pure Bi that acted as lubricant during turning.

40|$|Abstract. The {{cold flow}} {{properties}} of rapeseed-based biodiesel (RME) were studied by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), multifunctional low temperature tester and thermal analysis. Two approaches for reducing {{cold filter plugging point}} (CFPP) of RME were investigated: blending <b>with</b> winter petrodiesel, <b>treating</b> <b>with</b> cold flow improver (CFI) additives {{and the effect}} of CFI to combustion characteristics of RME. A good correlation model was proposed for prediction CFPP by RME blending ratio. The study shows that the RME was mainly composed of fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) : C 14 : 0 –C 24 : 0, C 16 : 1 –C 22 : 1, C 18 : 2 and C 18 : 3. The mass fraction of saturated fatty acid methyl esters (SFAME) and unsaturated fatty acid methyl esters (UFAME) was 14. 69 % and 83. 40 %, respectively. The CFPP of RME was- 7 °C. Blending with- 10 petrodiesel (- 10 PD) decreased the CFPP to- 12 °C. <b>Treating</b> <b>with</b> CFI <b>additives</b> (volume fraction ≤ 1. 5 %) decreased the CFPP of RME and RME/- 10 PD to- 11 and- 28 °C, respectively.
