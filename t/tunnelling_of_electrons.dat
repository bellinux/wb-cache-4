In recent years, much attention has been given to current noise in light-emitting diodes and laser diodes.

We give a review of experiments in this area with special emphasis on the ability of such devices to produce subshot-noise currents and light beams. Finally we consider the noise properties of a class of mesoscopic devices based on the quantum <b>tunnelling</b> <b>of</b> an <b>electron</b> into and out of a bound state.
