5|$|Ewes {{generally}} reach {{sexual maturity}} at {{six to eight}} months of age, and rams generally at four to six (ram lambs have occasionally been known to impregnate their mothers at two months). Ewes enter into oestrus cycles about every 17 days, which last for approximately 30 hours. In addition to emitting a scent, they indicate readiness through physical displays towards rams. <b>The</b> <b>phenomenon</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> freemartin, a female bovine that is behaviorally masculine and lacks functioning ovaries, is commonly associated with cattle, but does occur to some extent in sheep. The instance of freemartins in sheep may be increasing {{in concert with the}} rise in twinning (freemartins are the result of male-female twin combinations).|$|E

5|$|Today, {{the great}} {{majority}} of the cardinals are archbishops of the main metropolitan dioceses of the world and reside in their countries. Apart from the exclusive right of the election of the new pope, their dignity is purely honorific. However, originally the College of Cardinals was simply a college of the clergy of the City of Rome, constituted of the bishops of the seven dioceses (called suburbicarian sees) bordering the diocese of Rome (cardinal-bishops), priests of the parochial churches of Rome (cardinal-priests) and deacons heading the ecclesiastical regions of the city of Rome (cardinal-deacons). Unlike today, the cardinals had real jurisdiction over the dioceses, parochial churches (called tituli) or deaconries to which they were attached. <b>The</b> <b>phenomenon</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> external cardinalate in the late Middle Ages constituted the first exception to the rule, that cardinals – members of the clergy of the diocese of Rome – cannot serve simultaneously in another, external church, which is now common practice.|$|E

25|$|Prior to 1914, however, {{many foreign}} films were imported. In {{the era of}} the silent film there were no {{language}} boundaries and Danish and Italian films were particularly popular in Germany. The public's desire to see more films with particular actors led to the development in Germany, as elsewhere, of <b>the</b> <b>phenomenon</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> film star; the actress Henny Porten was one of the earliest German stars. Public desire to see popular film stories being continued encouraged the production of film serials, especially in the genre of mystery films, which is where the director Fritz Lang began his illustrious career.|$|E
25|$|In {{continuous}} time dynamical systems, chaos is <b>the</b> <b>phenomenon</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spontaneous {{breakdown of}} topological supersymmetry {{which is an}} intrinsic property of evolution operators of all stochastic and deterministic (partial) differential equations. This picture of dynamical chaos works not only for deterministic models but also for models with external noise, which is an important generalization from the physical point of view because in reality all dynamical systems experience influence from their stochastic environments. Within this picture, the long-range dynamical behavior associated with chaotic dynamics, e.g., the butterfly effect, {{is a consequence of}} the Goldstone's theorem in the application to the spontaneous topological supersymmetry breaking.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>phenomenon</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> social {{sharing of}} {{emotions}} extends beyond just {{the realm of}} psychology; it also has been considered {{in the context of}} anthropology. Because an emotional episode is shared with a group of people, it becomes part of a shared knowledge within that group. As discussed above, knowledge of an event experienced by a single person can extend to more than 50 people via secondary and tertiary social sharing, thus the event has become a shared part of a relatively large group of people. Yet, an event can be extended to even larger groups of people, perhaps even whole communities or even nations, when the event is very intense one or when many people concurrently experience the event.|$|E
25|$|After World War II, Orange County {{experienced}} dramatic growth, {{the formation}} of many new municipalities, {{and the expansion of}} existing municipalities through annexation of neighboring county territory. With economic development driving expansion, cities sought to annex prosperous neighborhoods and commercial districts; neighborhoods that were less prosperous, neighborhoods with older housing stock and large families drawn by its affordability, and neighborhoods largely populated by Mexicans found themselves bypassed by city governments reluctant to provide services to aging residential districts, or to increase their minority population. Cities set their sights on the most economically productive or promising county territory; in turn, many residents of unincorporated areas resisted potential tax increases, sought to preserve community identity, and sought to preserve perceived (and often disputed) advantages of their neighborhoods' unincorporated status. Thus was born <b>the</b> <b>phenomenon</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> county island, either partially or wholly surrounded by municipal territory.|$|E

25|$|This {{is one of}} {{the major}} themes of Petty's writings, summed up by his use of the phrase vadere sicut vult, whence we get laissez-faire. As {{mentioned}} earlier, the motif of medicine was also useful to Petty, and he warned against over-interference by the government in the economy, seeing it as analogous to a physician tampering excessively with his patient. He applied this to monopolies, controls on the exportation of money and on the trade of commodities. They were, to him, vain and harmful to a nation. He recognised the price effects of monopolies, citing the French king's salt monopoly as an example. In another work, Political Arithmetic, Petty also recognised the importance of economies of scale. He described <b>the</b> <b>phenomenon</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> division of labour, asserting that a good is both of better quality and cheaper, if many work on it. Petty said that the gain is greater 'as the manufacture itself is greater'.|$|E
25|$|The {{growth of}} the {{drive-in}} theater market {{was one of the}} major spurs to the expansion of the independent low-budget film industry. As of January 1, 1945, there were 96 drive-ins in the United States; a decade later, the number had passed 3,700. Unpretentious pictures with simple, familiar plots and reliable shock effects—that is, B pictures in both production values and aesthetic spirit if not by the older, more precise industrial definition—were ideally suited for auto-based film viewing, with all its attendant distractions. <b>The</b> <b>phenomenon</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> drive-in movie became one of the defining symbols of American popular culture in the 1950s. Over the course of the decade, many local television stations began showing B genre films in late-night slots, popularizing the notion of the midnight movie. In the spring of 1954, Los Angeles TV station KABC expanded on the concept by having an appropriately offbeat host introduce the films: on Saturday nights, The Vampira Show, with Maila Nurmi as the titular MC, screened low-budget horror and suspense movies, including at least one that would become a cult classic—Edgar G. Ulmer's Detour, produced in 1945 for $117,000. Variations on the Vampira format were soon running at stations around the country.|$|E

On January 26, 1945, a bulletin of the Żydowska Agencja Prasowa (Jewish News Agency) reported that 48 individuals had emerged from hiding and referred to them as jaskiniowcy, or [...] "cavemen". The term [...] "Robinsons" [...] soon became common, {{a reference to the}} fictional castaway Robinson Crusoe in the Daniel Defoe novel.

500|$|<b>The</b> <b>phenomenon</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> [...] "external" [...] cardinalate was revived {{during the}} Great Western Schism, {{but in another}} form and for other reasons.

These cardinals continued to reside in their countries. Additionally, the curial cardinals in 13th century started to cumulate a great number of the benefices, {{from the time of the}} Schism including also the episcopal sees. After the Council of Trent (1545–1563), the cardinals occupying external bishoprics were generally obliged to reside in them. Today, the majority of the cardinals are simultaneously diocesan archbishops or bishops, and they have no real jurisdiction over their titular churches at Rome.|$|E
