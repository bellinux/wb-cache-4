Little is known of two of <b>these</b> <b>men,</b> <b>and</b> {{it is difficult to determine}} which faction, if any, they belonged to. Edwin, probably ruling in Sussex, and perhaps also parts of Kent and Surrey, was buried at Abingdon, an abbey patronised by Ælfhere. Æthelmær, who oversaw Hampshire, held lands in Rutland, perhaps suggesting links to Æthelwine.|$|E
5|$|S {{is about}} {{voyeurism}} {{as it relates}} to underground films. Interviews with horror film directors and Carol J. Clover, a writer on the horror genre, are weaved between clips from horror films. In the beginning of the film, clips show the directors and Clover commenting on a horror film that is not shown onscreen and with the title not mentioned. The film then moves on to Petty's meetings with Eric Rost (Erik Marcisak), Bill Zebub, and Fred Vogel. He interviews <b>these</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> actress Debbie D., while clips from horror films and facts and opinions provided by Clover about the genre are interspersed.|$|E

The liners Britannic, Largs Bay and Tamaroa were available in Freetown to carry 8,528 of <b>these</b> <b>men,</b> <b>and</b> it was decided to sail the troopship SS California directly from the Clyde to provide the remaining berths.|$|E

5|$|There were {{tensions}} between Bute {{and the new}} industrialists around the region, including ironmasters such as John Guest, {{the master of the}} Dowlais Ironworks. Bute was a financial competitor or landlord with many of <b>these</b> <b>men,</b> <b>and</b> keen to drive as good a deal as possible in his negotiations with them. He also had political differences, seeing himself as a benevolent feudal lord in South Wales, and perceiving the local iron-masters as arrogant, power-hungry individuals, abusing their economic power towards communities and workers.|$|E
5|$|Unknown {{to either}} side at Saratoga, General Lincoln and Colonel John Brown had staged an attack against the British {{position}} at Fort Ticonderoga. Lincoln had collected 2,000 men at Bennington by early September. Brown and a detachment of 500 men captured poorly defended positions between Ticonderoga and Lake George, and then spent several days ineffectually bombarding the fort. <b>These</b> <b>men,</b> <b>and</b> some of the prisoners they freed along the way, {{were back in the}} American camp by September 29.|$|E
5|$|In November 1887, Tchaikovsky {{arrived in}} Saint Petersburg {{in time to}} hear several of the Russian Symphony Concerts, one of which {{included}} the first complete performance of {{the final version of}} his First Symphony and another the premiere of the revised version of Rimsky-Korsakov's Third Symphony. Before this visit he had spent much time keeping in touch with Rimsky-Korsakov and those around him. Rimsky-Korsakov, along with Alexander Glazunov, Anatol Lyadov and several other nationalistically-minded composers and musicians, had formed a group called the Belyayev circle. This group was named after timber merchant Mitrofan Belyayev, an amateur musician who became an influential music patron and publisher after he had taken an interest in Glazunov's work. During Tchaikovsky's visit, he spent much time in the company of <b>these</b> <b>men,</b> <b>and</b> his somewhat fraught relationship with The Five would meld into a more harmonious one with the Belyayev circle. This relationship would last until his death in late 1893.|$|E

5|$|In {{spite of}} the failure of the negotiations, the conspirators succeeded in overthrowing the {{democracy}} and imposing the oligarchic government of the Four Hundred, among the leaders of which were Phrynichus and Pisander. At Samos, however, a similar coup instigated by the conspirators did not go forward so smoothly. Samian democrats learned of the conspiracy and notified four prominent Athenians: the generals Leon and Diomedon, the trierarch Thrasybulus, and Thrasyllus, at that time a hoplite in the ranks. With the support of <b>these</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> the Athenian soldiers in general, the Samian democrats were able to defeat the 300 Samian oligarchs who attempted to seize power there. Further, the Athenian troops at Samos formed themselves into a political assembly, deposed their generals, and elected new ones, including Thrasybulus and Thrasyllus. The army, stating that they had not revolted from the city but that the city had revolted from them, resolved to stand by the democracy while continuing to prosecute the war against Sparta.|$|E
5|$|Only just {{escaping}} capture, Blücher {{crossed the}} forest of Vertus and took up positions at Étoges with Prince Urusov's division, which had been left there in reserve. Russian General Udom, with 1,800 men and 15 cannon, was instructed to cover the position, by occupying the park at Étoges. Udom's men were exhausted after the long retreat and fighting and, seeing that night had fallen, thought themselves in safety. However, Doumerc's cuirassiers, formed unseen in the night, surprised <b>these</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> a single charge was enough to send the panicked men fleeing. Prince Urusov, 600 men and eight artillery pieces were captured during this action, with the French sailors' regiment from Lagrange's division subsequently entering the village of Étoges. Blücher abandoned this position too and made a hasty retreat towards Vertus and Bergères. He then opted for a speedy night march {{and the next day}} he managed to bring his remaining men to Châlons, where he was joined by Yorck's and Sacken's corps.|$|E

25|$|After {{some time}} {{the reason for}} the {{presence}} of voluntary police officers had changed. No longer were <b>these</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> women called into service only for emergencies. More and more they became part of the regular teams of police officers and started doing all sorts of regular police tasks. As of 1994, along with the first great reform of the Dutch police, police volunteers were fully integrated into the 25 regional police forces. Between 1994 and 2010, new voluntary police officers were no longer equipped with a pistol. Those who started before 1994 were allowed to keep their pistol, as long as they kept up training. Since 2005, all voluntary police officers are equipped with pepper spray. As of today, voluntary police officers are again equipped with a pistol, after having acquired a full police diploma, successfully completed several years of field-experience as an unarmed officer, and completed an additional police safety training. In 2012 the initial training program for new voluntary police officers was changed, reducing the training from three years down to one year. Dutch voluntary police officers hold the same police powers and wear the same uniform as their professional counterparts.|$|E
25|$|Before {{the search}} of Berdella's {{property}} had concluded, the Kansas City Police Department assembled a special task force of 11 detectives and one sergeant to focus exclusively on Berdella's case. This task force extensively researched Berdella's history, discovering {{that he was a}} well-known individual among Kansas City's male hustlers, having earned a reputation for preying on transient young men. Several of these male prostitutes were also reluctant to accept him as a client both because of his penchant for drugging, injecting, and torturing his sexual partners and acquaintances, and also because he had long been considered a suspect in the disappearance of the two men whose personal possessions had been found in his house (Jerry Howell and Walter James Ferris). Missing person reports had been filed in relation to both <b>these</b> <b>men,</b> <b>and</b> Berdella had been extensively questioned in relation to both of these disappearances. In both instances, he had denied having {{anything to do with the}} individual's disappearance. Despite being considered a prime suspect in both cases, and being placed under surveillance, police had been unable to find any solid evidence linking him to either man's disappearance, and in both instances, after giving his initial statement to police, Berdella had indignantly refused to talk further without a lawyer present. He would later have his lawyer threaten to file harassment accusations against police unless their questioning and surveillance of him ceased.|$|E
