2500|$|The PC {{version of}} the game {{received}} praise for its faithful reproduction of gameplay from the console versions. [...] The addition of keyboard and mouse gameplay received mixed views from critics. [...] Game Revolution's Josh Laddin felt that the keyboard controls were frustrating and said, [...] "the keyboard controls aren't as intuitive as a gamepad." [...] However Marko Djordjevic of GameFocus disagreed and stated, [...] "once you get <b>the</b> <b>hang</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> [...] it feels exactly as you’d expect." [...] Djordjevic further appreciated that the cooperative gameplay was ported over from the console versions.|$|E
2500|$|Different {{versions}} of the show could be heard in different contexts. [...] The television broadcast began with pre-show announcements by the producer, John Browell, and introduction of the participants, followed by warm-up routines by the cast. [...] The broadcast proper begins with Spike Milligan, Peter Sellers and Harry Secombe each trying and failing to lead the other two in saying [...] "It's great to be back." [...] This {{was the start of}} the show from the radio audience's point of view. [...] Announcer Andrew Timothy then intervenes with [...] "They haven't quite got <b>the</b> <b>hang</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> yet, but after another smoke they should be switched on." ...|$|E

60|$|Presently he leant {{back and}} gave {{himself up to}} the {{business}} of trying to imagine just exactly what Miss Walshingham could have thought of him when she saw him. Doubts about the precise effect of the grey flannel suit began to trouble him. He turned to the mirror over the mantel, and then got into a chair to study <b>the</b> <b>hang</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trousers. <b>It</b> looked all right. Luckily, she had not seen the Panama hat. He knew that he had the brim turned up wrong, but he could not find out which way the brim was right. However, that she had not seen. He might perhaps ask at the shop where he bought it.|$|R

"I'd foller arter ye, Mr. Hamlin, in a buggy," [...] he interpolated, in gentle deprecation of his {{unwieldy}} {{and difficult}} bulk, [...] "but I'm sorter kept yer with my wife--who is powerful weak along of a pore small baby--about so long--the same not bein' a fammerly man yourself, you don't kinder get <b>the</b> <b>hang</b> <b>of.</b> I thought <b>it</b> might please ye {{to know that}} I got bail yesterday for thet Mr. Perkins--ez didn't kill that thar Ramirez--the same havin' killed hisself--ez waz fetched out on the trial, which I reckon ye didn't get to hear.

6000|$|Your {{cupboard}} has come, {{and it is}} most beautiful: it {{is certainly}} worth a lot of money, and is just {{what we have been}} looking for in all the shops for quite a while: so your present falls very pat. It is to go in our bedroom I think; but perhaps my wife will think <b>it</b> too much <b>of</b> a good thing to be put so much out of the way, so I shall not put it in its place till her return. I am so well that I am afraid to speak <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> being a coward as to boasting. I take walks in the wood daily, and have got back to my work after a long break. The story I wrote you about was one you read to me in Cassell's Family Paper long ago when it came out. It was astonishing how clearly I remembered it all, pictures, characters, and incidents, though the last were a little mixed and I had not <b>the</b> least <b>the</b> <b>hang</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> story. <b>It</b> was very pleasant to read it again, and remember old days, and the weekly excursion to Mrs. Hoggs after that precious journal.

60|$|In the age which {{directly}} {{followed that}} of the Puritans, their cause or themselves were little likely to have justice done them. Charles Second and his Rochesters were {{not the kind of}} men you would set to judge what the worth or meaning of such men might have been. That there could be any faith or truth {{in the life of a}} man, was what these poor Rochesters, and the age they ushered in, had forgotten. Puritanism was hung on gibbets,--like the bones of the leading Puritans. Its work nevertheless went on accomplishing itself. All true work <b>of</b> a man, <b>hang</b> <b>the</b> author <b>of</b> <b>it</b> on what gibbet you like, must and will accomplish itself. We have our Habeas-Corpus, our free Representation of the People; acknowledgment, wide as the world, that all men are, or else must, shall, and will become, what we call free men;--men with their life grounded on reality and justice, not on tradition, which has become unjust and a chimera! This in part, and much besides this, was the work of the Puritans.|$|R

6000|$|... "Just the same," [...] he muttered, {{with a slow}} {{shake of}} the head, [...] "I don't get <b>the</b> <b>hang</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> There's {{something}} wrong so far as we're concerned--my wife an' me, I mean. Maybe I'll get hold of it after a while." ...|$|E

6000|$|They {{walked a}} long way that afternoon.

60|$|Between Iffley and Oxford is {{the most}} {{difficult}} bit of the river I know. You want to be born on that bit of water, to understand it.
