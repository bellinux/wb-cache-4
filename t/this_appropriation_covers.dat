50|$|Exploiters {{appropriate}} another's surplus labour, {{which is}} the amount of labour exceeding what is necessary for the reproduction of a worker's labour power and basic living conditions. In other terms, this entails the worker being able to maintain living conditions sufficient to be able to continue work. Marx does not attempt to tie this solely to capitalist institutions; he notes how historically, there are accounts of <b>this</b> <b>appropriation</b> of surplus labour in institutions with forced labour, like those based on slavery and feudal societies. However, the difference he emphasizes is the fact that when <b>this</b> <b>appropriation</b> of surplus labour occurs in societies like capitalist ones, it is occurring in institutions having abolished forced labour and resting on free labour. This comes from Marx's labour theory of value which states that value is intrinsic in a product according to the amount of labour that has been spent on producing the product.|$|R
