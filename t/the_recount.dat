5|$|Preliminary {{reports on}} {{election}} night, November 4, were that Coleman was leading by over 700 votes, {{but by the}} official results, certified on November 18, 2008, Coleman led by only 215 votes. As the two candidates were separated by less than 0.5 {{percent of the votes}} cast, the Minnesota Secretary of State, Mark Ritchie, authorized an automatic recount provided for in Minnesota election law. In <b>the</b> <b>recount,</b> ballots and certifying materials were examined by hand, and candidates could file challenges to the legality of ballots or materials for inclusion or exclusion In <b>the</b> <b>recount.</b> On January 5, 2009, the Minnesota State Canvassing Board certified the recounted vote totals, with Franken ahead by 225 votes.|$|E
5|$|After regular {{ballots were}} counted, Pryce led Kilroy by over 3,500 votes with about 19,000 {{provisional}} ballots outstanding. The Franklin county absentee and provisional ballots were not counted until approximately {{two weeks after}} the election. On Monday November 27, nearly three weeks after Election Day, Pryce was declared the winner by a 1,054 vote margin that mandated a recount. After two recounts and all of the votes were counted, Congresswoman Deborah Pryce (R) prevailed over Democratic challenger Mary Jo Kilroy. The Franklin County Board of Elections announced the results Monday morning December 11, 2006. Pryce (R) gained 25 votes and Kilroy (D) gained 18 votes in <b>the</b> <b>recount</b> of votes in Franklin, Union, and Madison Counties in Ohio. Pryce won with 50.20% of the vote by a 110,739–109,677 margin. Kilroy felt her campaign was slowed by the early candidacy of fellow Franklin County Commissioner Paula Brooks, who eventually withdrew. Immediately after losing in 2006, she announced she would recontest the seat in 2008.|$|E
5|$|Despite its {{opposition}} to parliamentary democracy, Zbor participated in the 1935 Yugoslav parliamentary elections. It offered 8,100 candidates throughout Yugoslavia. On 5 May the Yugoslav government first announced {{the results of the}} elections, which showed that 72.6 percent of the eligible electorate had cast a total of 2,778,172 ballots. The party of Bogoljub Jevtić had received 1,738,390 (62.6%) votes and 320 seats in parliament and the Opposition Bloc led by Vladko Maček had received 983,248 (35.4%) votes and 48 seats. Zbor finished last in the polls, with 23,814 (0.8%) votes, and had acquired no seats in parliament. Of all the votes it had received, 13,635 came from the Danube Banovina, in which Ljotić's home district of Smederevo was located. The election results initially published by authorities caused an upheaval amongst the public, forcing the government to publish the results of a recount on 22 May. <b>The</b> <b>recount</b> showed that 100,000 additional ballots that had not been recorded on 5 May had been cast and that Jevtić's party had received 1,746,982 (60.6%) votes and 303 seats, the Opposition Bloc had received 1,076,345 (37.4%) and 67 seats, and that Zbor had received 24,008 (0.8%) votes and again no seats.|$|E

5|$|Meyer is {{challenged}} {{in the general}} election by Southern Senator Bill O'Brien. The election ends in an Electoral College tie, but with Meyer having won the popular vote. After an ambiguous result in Nevada, the Meyer camp successfully campaigns for a recount. <b>The</b> <b>recount</b> backfires, and O'Brien keeps Nevada as a victory, as well as overtakes the popular vote. Congress must then decide who will be the President. After the House of Representatives fails to elect the President, Meyer agrees to be Vice President for her running mate Tom James, however the Senate instead elects O'Brien's running mate Laura Montez as Vice President. Due to the tied vote in the House, the office of the President is left vacant, meaning that now as Vice President, Montez immediately ascends to the presidency. As a result, James makes plans to return to the private sector while Meyer, now completely out of office, contemplates her future.|$|E
