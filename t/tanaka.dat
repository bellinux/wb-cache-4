5|$|Balls Mahoney faced Masato <b>Tanaka</b> in {{the second}} Extreme Rules match of the night. Mahoney got the early {{advantage}} after throwing a beer can {{in the face of}} <b>Tanaka.</b> <b>Tanaka</b> gained the advantage after executing a superplex off the top rope. Mahoney won the match after hitting <b>Tanaka</b> with a steel chair. Before the WWE Championship match, Eugene came to the ring to cut a promo. He reminded the fans that he was Eric Bischoff's nephew, before being interrupted by The Sandman. Sandman hit Eugene repeatedly with his Singapore cane, leaving Eugene to run to the back, with The Sandman chasing after him.|$|E
5|$|After {{the project}} was accepted, Hinoue {{consulted}} Key's former main scenario writer Jun Maeda on various game scenario writers to employ for Rewrite. However, the one writer Hinoue wanted on {{the project was}} Romeo <b>Tanaka,</b> who {{she had become a}} fan of after she played FlyingShine's 2003 visual novel Cross Channel, written by <b>Tanaka.</b> While he did not initially accept the offer, <b>Tanaka</b> decided to take the project when he was given the time he needed to do the job. When he accepted it, <b>Tanaka</b> was still unaware that Maeda had stepped down as Key's main scenario writer, and he became more interested when he was told that he would write Rewrites overall story.|$|E

50|$|At 22:40 on 30 November, <b>Tanaka's</b> force arrived off Guadalcanal and {{prepared}} to unload the supply barrels. Meanwhile, Wright's warships were approaching through Ironbottom Sound from the opposite direction. Wright's destroyers detected <b>Tanaka's</b> force on radar and the destroyer commander requested permission to attack with torpedoes. Wright waited four minutes before giving permission, allowing <b>Tanaka's</b> force to escape from an optimum firing setup. All of the American torpedoes missed their targets. At the same time, Wright's cruisers opened fire, quickly hitting and destroying one of the Japanese guard destroyers. The rest of <b>Tanaka's</b> warships abandoned the supply mission, increased speed, turned, and launched a total of 44 torpedoes {{in the direction of}} Wright's cruisers.|$|R

5|$|Monolith Soft {{was founded}} by Tetsuya Takahashi, a {{developer}} who had previously worked at Nihon Falcom and later at Square, in which the latter was merged into Enix in 2003 to form Square Enix. While at Square, {{he and his wife}} Kaori <b>Tanaka</b> (also known as Soraya Saga) would {{contribute to the development of}} multiple titles including entries in the Final Fantasy series. Following their work on Final Fantasy VI, Takahashi and <b>Tanaka</b> created a proposal for Final Fantasy VII; while deemed to dark for the Final Fantasy series, they were allowed to develop it as their own project titled Xenogears. Takahashi's ambition and drive prompted Final Fantasy creator Hironobu Sakaguchi, then Executive Vice President at Square, to appoint him as director. Takahashi also wrote the script with <b>Tanaka.</b> Following the release of Xenogears, Takahashi became dissatisfied with Square's business approach at the time, which prioritized their major intellectual properties including Final Fantasy. This left Takahashi with no funding or creative room to develop further independent projects or continue his planned Xenogears series.|$|E

5|$|Around 21:30 on August 14, Hatanaka's rebels {{set their}} plan into motion. The Second Regiment of the First Imperial Guards {{had entered the}} palace grounds, {{doubling}} {{the strength of the}} battalion already stationed there, presumably to provide extra protection against Hatanaka's rebellion. But Hatanaka, along with Lt.Col. Jirō Shiizaki, convinced the commander of the 2ndRegiment of the First Imperial Guards, Colonel Toyojirō Haga, of their cause, by telling him (falsely) that Generals Anami and Umezu, and the commanders of the Eastern District Army and Imperial Guards Divisions were all in on the plan. Hatanaka also went to the office of Shizuichi <b>Tanaka,</b> commander of the Eastern region of the army, to try to persuade him to join the coup. <b>Tanaka</b> refused, and ordered Hatanaka to go home.

40|$|The {{morphological}} and karyological {{characters of}} Lysimachia ohsumiensis are {{compared with those}} of L. japonica, L. <b>tanakae</b> and L. tashiroi of sect, nummularia of Japan. L. ohsumiensis has yellow flowers with black-dots and striae. This species has the smallest leaves among the four species, but the multicellular hairs on the leaves are long and thick. L. ohsumiensis, L. <b>tanakae</b> and L. tashiroi have five stamens and a chromosome number of 2 n= 24, while L. japonica has five equal stamens and a chromosome number of 2 n = 20. This suggests that L. ohsumiensis is more closely related to L. <b>tanakae</b> and L. tashiroi than to L. japonica. Further, it suggests that L. ohsumiensis is more closely related to L. <b>tanakae</b> than to L. tashiroi judging- from its karyotype and presence of axillary flowers...|$|R

5|$|At the time, {{the only}} other {{scenario}} writer on the project was Yūto Tonokawa of Key, who previously contributed on Key's sixth game Little Busters!. <b>Tanaka</b> was tasked with drawing up the entire scenario framework, and during this time, Takahiro Baba suggested that one more heroine route {{be added to the}} story to bring the total to six, but to do that they had to hire another writer. Ryukishi07 of 07th Expansion, the creators of the Higurashi no Naku Koro ni and Umineko no Naku Koro ni game franchises, was brought in as the third scenario writer after Baba suggested in late 2007 that Key ask him to join the staff for Rewrite. Ultimately, <b>Tanaka</b> wrote the story leading up to the heroine's routes, Kotori's and Akane's scanarios, the Moon and Terra routes, and the bonus Oppai route. Tonokawa wrote Chihaya's and Sizuru's routes, and Ryukishi07 wrote Lucia's story. <b>Tanaka</b> initially planned on the length of Rewrites story to be on about the same scale as Key's second game Air, but as it increased in size, he later attempted to keep it close to the scale of Little Busters!.|$|E
