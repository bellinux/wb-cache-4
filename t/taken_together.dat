5|$|During this period, Ray {{composed}} {{films on}} the British Raj period (such as Devi), {{a documentary on}} Tagore, a comic film (Mahapurush) and his first film from an original screenplay (Kanchenjungha). He also {{made a series of}} films that, <b>taken</b> <b>together,</b> are considered by critics among the most deeply felt portrayals of Indian women on screen.|$|E

5|$|In November 1922, notices of new {{bills to}} be placed before Parliament were {{published}} by the W, and by the UERL's subsidiaries the London Electric Railway (LER) and the City and South London Railway (C, {{now part of the}} London Underground's Northern line). <b>Taken</b> <b>together,</b> the bills brought significant changes to the plans for the Wimbledon to Sutton line.|$|E
5|$|It {{has some}} {{properties}} that are {{unusual for a}} metal; <b>taken</b> <b>together,</b> these are sometimes used as a basis to classify aluminium as a metalloid. Its crystalline structure shows some evidence of directional bonding. Aluminium bonds covalently in most compounds. The oxide Al2O3 is amphoteric, and a conditional glass-former. Aluminium can form anionic aluminates, such behaviour being considered nonmetallic in character.|$|E
5|$|Pre-historic {{finds in}} the parish of Eccles include dugout boats found at Barton-upon-Irwell, an arrowhead, a spear and axes at Winton, which <b>taken</b> <b>together</b> appear to suggest the {{existence}} of a hunting and travelling society. Human habitation in the area may extend as far back as 6000BC, with two separate periods of settlement on Chat Moss, the first around 500BC and the second during the Romano-British period.|$|E

5|$|Relative {{to their}} high standards, UConn {{struggled}} {{during the first}} two years following Taurasi's graduation in 2004. Some of its highly touted recruits did not play up to expectations while others suffered injuries. <b>Taken</b> <b>together</b> during the three years 2005–2007, UConn never made a Final Four, something that has become almost routine (17 final fours in 22 years from 1995 to 2016).|$|E
5|$|<b>Taken</b> <b>together,</b> {{women are}} oftentimes seen less {{valuable}} than men. With lower {{involvement in the}} public sphere—as exemplified by the labour and political participation rates—and the stigma of being less valuable within a family, women face a unique form of gender discrimination.|$|E
5|$|Histological {{examination}} {{reveals that}} pachycephalosaurid domes {{are composed of}} a unique form of fibrolamellar bone which contains fibroblasts that {{play a critical role}} in wound healing, and are capable of rapidly depositing bone during remodeling. Peterson et al. (2013) concluded that <b>taken</b> <b>together,</b> the frequency of lesion distribution and the bone structure of frontoparietal domes, lends strong support to the hypothesis that pachycephalosaurids used their unique cranial structures for agonistic behavior. CT scan comparisons of the skulls of Stegoceras validum, Prenocephale prenes, and several head-striking artiodactyls have also supported pachycephalosaurids as being well-equipped for head-butting.|$|E

40|$|One way of {{constructing}} a 2 -(11, 5, 4) design is to <b>take</b> <b>together</b> all the blocks of 2 -(11, 5, 2) designs having no blocks in common. We show that 58 non-isomorphic 2 -(11, 5, 4) designs {{can be so}} made and that through extensions by complementation these can be packaged into just 12 non-isomorphic reducible 3 -(12, 6, 4) designs...|$|R
5|$|In any case, the {{succession}} of Nyuserre seems to have gone smoothly. A seal bearing both Nyuserre's and Menkauhor's names has been uncovered in the mortuary complex of Nyuserre's mother Khentkaus II. A further seal {{is believed to have}} both Nyuserre's and Djedkare's names on it, Djedkare Isesi being Nyuserre's second successor. <b>Taken</b> <b>together</b> these seals reveal that, at the very least, Menkauhor and Djedkare did not perceive Nyuserre as an antagonist.|$|E
5|$|Levodopa and {{proteins}} use {{the same}} transportation system in the intestine and the blood–brain barrier, thereby competing for access. When they are <b>taken</b> <b>together,</b> {{this results in a}} reduced effectiveness of the drug. Therefore, when levodopa is introduced, excessive protein consumption is discouraged and well balanced Mediterranean diet is recommended. In advanced stages, additional intake of low-protein products such as bread or pasta is recommended for similar reasons. To minimize interaction with proteins, levodopa should be taken 30 minutes before meals. At the same time, regimens for PD restrict proteins during breakfast and lunch, allowing protein intake in the evening.|$|E
5|$|Protecting both quarterbacks was {{a strong}} {{offensive}} line anchored by All-American guard Rodney Hudson, a two-time winner of the Jacobs Blocking Trophy, a four-time recipient of all-conference honors and {{a finalist for the}} Outland Trophy. Hudson and the offensive line also protected Florida State's running backs. Foremost among these was sophomore Chris Thompson, who led the team with 687rushing yards. Thompson was predicted to start the ACC Championship game because of his performance in the regular season and because fellow running backs Ty Jones and Jermaine Thomas were injured. <b>Taken</b> <b>together,</b> Florida State's offense was 52nd in total offense, accumulating 391yards per game.|$|E

6000|$|Here was the {{opportunity}} to tell him all, and vindicate the justice of his theories! But he shrank from it again; and now, adding to the confusion, was a singular sense of dread at the mental labor of explanation. He only smiled painfully, and began to move away. [...] "Look you!" [...] said Masters, peremptorily, [...] "ye want about three fingers of straight whiskey to set you right, and you've got to take it with me. D--n it, man, {{it may be the}} last drink we <b>take</b> <b>together!</b> Don't look so skeered! I mean--I made up my mind about ten minutes ago to cut the whole d--d thing, and light out for fresh diggings. I'm sick of getting only grub wages out o' this bill.

5|$|Somewhat later, andesitic lavas {{poured out}} {{from what is}} now Reading Peak and mainly flowed {{to the south and}} east, {{reaching}} the head of Warner Valley. By this time, the park's eastern portion had been transformed into a relatively flat plain. The activity was followed by an eruption of the Eastern basalts from volcanoes east of the park. These thick flows have subsequently eroded to produce rugged hills that limit the park on the east. <b>Taken</b> <b>together,</b> these various flows built the lava plateau that the Lassen volcanic area is located on.|$|E
5|$|<b>Taken</b> <b>together</b> {{with the}} other sources above, this Hospital {{must be seen as}} a {{significant}} medieval establishment. It served a number purposes; especially the provision of a sub-monastic care home for locals. There is no clear evidence about the inclusion of women. The location of the hospital adjacent to a river crossing on the drove road indicates that it was a travellers inn. The hospital at Soutra Aisle in the Scottish Borders served a similar purpose. In addition to being a Traveller's Inn, {{it may have been a}} Chantry for the Cathedral in Old Aberdeen.|$|E

These abstract sounds, used {{almost as a}} form of Musique concrète, were recorded on West Hollywood, California's Sunset Strip specifically for the album.

5|$|Freemasonry, as {{it exists}} in various forms all over the world, has a {{membership}} estimated by the United Grand Lodge of England at around six million worldwide. The fraternity is administratively organised into independent Grand Lodges (or sometimes Grand Orients), each of which governs its own Masonic jurisdiction, which consists of subordinate (or constituent) Lodges. The largest single jurisdiction, in terms of membership, is the United Grand Lodge of England (with a membership estimated at around a quarter million). The Grand Lodge of Scotland and Grand Lodge of Ireland (<b>taken</b> <b>together)</b> have approximately 150,000 members. In the United States, total membership is just under two million.|$|E

The pilot episode aired on November 7, 2011 across Europe and Latin America on Fox International Channels, ranking #1 or #2 among all Pay-TV in most metered markets across Latin America and Europe for its time slot. In the UK, it premiered on non-terrestrial channel FX, with 128,200 viewers. The episode was seen by 3.2 million viewers total in 59 countries.|$|E
