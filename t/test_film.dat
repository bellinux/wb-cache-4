5|$|A life-size {{model of}} the light cycle was put on display at a booth at Fan Expo 2009 in Toronto, Ontario from August 28–30, 2009, along with a special {{presentation}} of material from the production. The conceptual art shown at Comic-Con was shown in the session, along with some <b>test</b> <b>film</b> of the martial artists who play a more athletic style of Disc Wars. A segment from the film showed Flynn's son entering the now-decrepit arcade, playing a Tron stand-up arcade video game, noticing a passage in {{the wall behind the}} Tron game and entering it, the passage closing behind him. Flynn's son makes the visit to the arcade after Alan Bradley receives a page from the disconnected phone number of the arcade. The footage was used later as part of the trailer released on March 5, 2010.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, Gerry Anderson {{supervised}} {{the production of}} a short computer-animated <b>test</b> <b>film,</b> Captain Scarlet and the Return of the Mysterons, to explore the possibility of updating a number of his 1960s Supermarionation series for a 21st-century audience. The working title was Captain Scarlet – The New Millennium. Produced in London by the Moving Picture Company, the film features Francis Matthews and Ed Bishop reprising the roles of Captains Scarlet and Blue. Made using a combination of Maya 3D computer graphics software and motion-capture technology, the plot commences a few years after the Mysterons end their hostilities against Earth, but the reappearance of Captain Black sets the stage for a revival of the war with Mars. Although the film has yet to receive a home video release, it was publicly screened at a Fanderson convention in 2000 and at a science lecture in 2001.|$|E
500|$|Plans {{for a full}} CGI Captain Scarlet {{television}} series to follow the <b>test</b> <b>film</b> finally resulted in Gerry Anderson's New Captain Scarlet. A reboot of the original series, this was first broadcast in the United Kingdom on the Saturday-morning CITV programme, Ministry of Mayhem, from 12 February 2005. Produced by [...] "Anderson Entertainment" [...] and the [...] "Indestructible Production Company", the animation used to create the series is billed in the credits as [...] "Hypermarionation" [...] to acknowledge the 1960s puppet technique, Supermarionation.|$|E
40|$|Physical {{properties}} {{were investigated}} of ODPA-p-PDA polyimide films, including their lower molecular weight versions with phthalimide endcaps. Free volume, determined by low energy positron annihilation in the <b>test</b> <b>films,</b> {{was the major}} parameter of interest since all other physical properties are ostensibly related to it. It affects the dielectric constant {{as well as the}} saturation moisture pickup of the <b>test</b> <b>films.</b> An empirical relation was developed between the free volume and molecular weight of the <b>test</b> <b>films,</b> comparable to the Mark-Houwink relation between the polymer solution viscosity and the molecular weight. Development of such a relation constitutes a unique achievement since it enables researchers to estimate the molecular weight of an intractable polymer in solid state for the first time...|$|R
40|$|We have {{developed}} a highly efficient scheme for generating high fluxes of slow positrons. These positrons have been successfully used to measure lifetimes in thin <b>test</b> <b>films.</b> The lifetime data {{have been used to}} develop two structure-property models for the <b>test</b> <b>films.</b> The first model relates the free volume cell size to the molecular weight of the polymer repeat unit. The second model relates the free volume fraction to the dielectric constant of the polymer film...|$|R

2500|$|Robinson and Young {{went to the}} {{shooting}} location–a park–to do a <b>test</b> <b>film,</b> which essentially involved them [...] "mucking about, 'Tangoing' each other;" [...] as they [...] "messed around" [...] they decided the [...] "little slap" [...] just wasn't powerful enough, so they exaggerated it; Robinson recalled that [...] "if you watch the ad, the Orange Man's arms go way back before he slaps {{the person in the}} face." [...] Seminal American jazz poet Gil Scott-Heron was hired to perform the voice who says the slogan at the end because of [...] "his deep, charismatic voice;" [...] Scott-Heron {{was the first person to}} see the final advert, and, much to the relief of a fearful Robinson, he loved it.|$|E

40|$|Most {{products}} are boxes, bottles and bags. The printability of biodegradable film {{has not been}} fully investigated.

Water-based flexo ink {{was used to test}} printability on PLA films. The influence of anilox roll and plate screen ruling was also considered. The print qualities were reported as dot shape, tone reproduction, and mottle. This study showed that biodegradable films could achieve similar quality compared to common packaging films. While printed at different screen rulings, clear PLA showed the highest dot gain and white PLA showed the lowest. All <b>tested</b> <b>films</b> appeared to have similar quality in keeping dot shape.
