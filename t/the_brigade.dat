5|$|As a British {{withdrawal}} from France {{at the earliest}} opportunity had been the original intent, <b>the</b> <b>brigade</b> boarded ships bound for Italy eleven days after landing. The operation had cost <b>the</b> <b>brigade</b> 362 casualties, but this did not hinder their next mission in Greece two months later. Only 126 replacements were required to bring <b>the</b> <b>brigade</b> back up to full strength.|$|E
5|$|During its {{deployment}} to Iraq, <b>the</b> <b>brigade</b> undertook many responsibilities, including providing logistics for airdrops {{and major}} combat operations including Operation Marne Torch. <b>The</b> <b>brigade</b> {{also created a}} Combat Logistics Patrol academy, training for combat situations during convoy operations, including improvised explosive device detection and removal, and first aid. <b>The</b> <b>brigade</b> also dispatched optometry teams to soldiers {{in the region to}} ensure they had all the eyesight testing they needed. <b>The</b> <b>brigade</b> returned to the continental United States in early 2008 {{along with the rest of}} the 82d Airborne Division, and was recognized by President George W.

5|$|In 2003 {{and into}} 2004, <b>the</b> <b>brigade</b> {{deployed}} {{for the first}} time to Afghanistan as part of Operation Enduring Freedom. As the only aviation brigade in the theater, <b>the</b> <b>brigade</b> provided air support for all U.S. Army units operating in the country. The brigade's mission at that time focused on close air support, medevac missions, and other duties involving combat with Taliban and Al-Qaeda forces in the country. <b>The</b> <b>brigade</b> returned to Fort Drum in 2004.|$|E
5|$|In April 2007, <b>the</b> <b>brigade</b> was alerted that {{it could}} be {{deployed}} to Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom {{by the end of the}} year. Four months later they were alerted that they would be heading to Iraq in 2008. <b>The</b> <b>brigade</b> mobilized in October of that year and trained in infantry techniques at army posts in Oklahoma and Arkansas. The 39th Infantry Brigade was also alerted for deployment during this time and deployed to Iraq in late 2007. During its rotation, <b>the</b> <b>brigade</b> was charged with turning over military facilities and Forward Operating Bases to the Iraqi Army as well as the Iraqi Police Force. <b>The</b> <b>brigade</b> returned to the United States in October 2008.|$|E
5|$|In January 1945 the 2nd Parachute Brigade was {{withdrawn}} from further operations and relocated to Italy. After {{the war ended}} in Europe, <b>the</b> <b>brigade</b> returned to the United Kingdom and reformed as a conventional brigade, losing its additional supporting arms. It had been planned for <b>the</b> <b>brigade</b> {{to go to the}} Far East and join the 44th Indian Airborne Division, fighting in Burma against the Japanese. However, the war ended before they departed, and instead <b>the</b> <b>brigade</b> was assigned to the 6th Airborne Division, which had been sent to Palestine. Leaving the United Kingdom <b>the</b> <b>brigade</b> arrived in Palestine on 22 October, and were based around Gaza.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> six reserve <b>brigades</b> in <b>the</b> Army's 2nd Division {{have also}} been {{assigned}} a new role.

500|$|On 16 September 2009, <b>the</b> <b>brigade's</b> Airborne {{status was}} {{terminated}} and the [...] "Airborne" [...] tab on <b>the</b> <b>brigade's</b> shoulder sleeve insignia was removed.|$|R
5000|$|Following a {{reorganization}} of the Croatian Army, <b>the</b> 4th <b>Brigade</b> was downsized to battalion size becoming the 2nd Motorized Battalion [...] "Spiders" [...] of <b>the</b> Motorized Guard <b>Brigade.</b> <b>The</b> Motorized Guard <b>Brigade</b> is composed of several other units, <b>the</b> 1st Guards <b>Brigade</b> (<b>the</b> [...] "Tigers"), <b>the</b> 2nd Guards <b>Brigade</b> (<b>the</b> [...] "Thunders") and <b>the</b> 9th Guards <b>Brigade</b> (<b>the</b> [...] "Wolves"), which have similarly been downsized. This was done to preserve unit histories and lineages rather than just disbanding <b>the</b> excess <b>brigades.</b>|$|R
5|$|In September 1944, <b>the</b> <b>brigade</b> formed part of {{the second}} day's {{parachute}} landings at the Battle of Arnhem, part of Operation Market Garden. Problems reaching the bridges in Arnhem forced the divisional commander, Major-General Roy Urquhart, to divert one of the brigade's battalions to assist the 1st Parachute Brigade. After a short delay <b>the</b> <b>brigade</b> headed out for its objective. When only halfway there, however, the remaining two battalions were confronted by prepared German defences. <b>The</b> <b>brigade,</b> having suffered heavy losses, was eventually forced to withdraw. The next day, weakened by fighting at close quarters and now numbering around 150 men, <b>the</b> <b>brigade</b> eventually reached the divisional position at Oosterbeek.|$|E
5|$|On 10October1945, <b>the</b> <b>brigade</b> {{arrived at}} the port of Haifa, and after {{disembarking}} moved to Gaza. After a short period of acclimatisation, the 6th Airlanding Brigade was deployed in the Samaria region, with <b>the</b> <b>brigade</b> headquarters at Lydda airfield. At the same time, the 6th Battalion, Gordon Highlanders, based at Tulkarm, came under the brigade's command. The first incident in <b>the</b> <b>brigade</b> area was on 31 October, when parties of armed Jews planted explosives on rail lines, which killed four and wounded eight when they exploded. Following attacks on coastguard stations, believed to be by members of the Palmach, over the night of 24/25November, <b>the</b> <b>brigade</b> carried out two operations to search settlements for those responsible. On 29March1946 <b>the</b> <b>brigade</b> was relocated to Jerusalem in preparation for leaving the division. On 3April the 1st Parachute Brigade, which had been assigned to the division, arrived in Palestine. Their arrival made the glider formation surplus to requirements, so on 15April <b>the</b> <b>brigade</b> was renumbered 31st Independent Infantry Brigade, and was no longer part of the British airborne forces.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{organized}} {{as a part}} of the 95th Infantry Division for World War I, <b>the</b> <b>brigade</b> never saw combat in that conflict. Kept active and in the reserve through much of the 20th century, <b>the</b> <b>brigade</b> in name was reorganized into a different unit for fighting during World War II. Seeing numerous moves, activations and deactivations, <b>the</b> <b>brigade</b> has been used principally as a training unit for most of its existence. Reactivated again in 2006, <b>the</b> <b>brigade</b> is now primarily responsible for training provincial reconstruction teams and their supporting elements for deployment to the War in Afghanistan.|$|E

5|$|The 173rd {{participated in}} various {{operations}} {{with the objective}} of ensuring security and subduing Taliban insurgents in the mountainous regions along Afghanistan's border with Pakistan, near the Hindu Kush. Throughout their 15-month deployment, <b>the</b> <b>brigade</b> participated in more than 9,000 patrols throughout the region. Journalist Sebastian Junger and photographer Tim Hetherington were embedded with Battle Company of 2nd Battalion which saw extensive action in the Korengal Valley. Junger later wrote a highly acclaimed book, War, and, with Hetherington, produced the award-winning documentary, Restrepo, about the deployment. Only two weeks before <b>the</b> <b>brigade</b> was to return to Europe, a platoon of 45 soldiers from <b>the</b> <b>brigade</b> stationed in the Dara-I-Pech district was attacked by a large force of insurgents during the Battle of Wanat. Though the platoon was able to drive the insurgents back with air support, the fight resulted in 9 soldiers killed and 16 wounded; the deadliest attack on troops in the country since 2005. <b>The</b> <b>brigade</b> repositioned the base three days later.
