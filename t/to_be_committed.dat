5|$|On 12 July the Soviets {{launched}} Operation Kutuzov, their counter-offensive {{upon the}} Orel salient, which threatened the flank and rear of Model's 9th Army. The 12th Panzer Division, thus far held in reserve and slated <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>committed</b> {{to the northern}} side of the Kursk salient, along with the 36th Motorized Infantry, 18th Panzer and 20th Panzer Divisions were redeployed to face the Soviet spearheads.|$|E
5|$|Believing she {{has finally}} lost her sanity, Jenni {{resolves}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>committed.</b> She tells Eric {{that the entire}} property will be meticulously searched for the skull as a last resort. Mickey secretly steals the skull and brings it to Snow before Eric can retrieve it. That night, Eric prepares to murder Jenni and stage it as a suicide. Jenni sees Marion's ghost in Mickey's greenhouse and flees back to the house, where Eric begins throttling her. The ghost appears and chases Eric outside, corners and attacks him, drowning him in the decorative pond.|$|E
5|$|May's {{squadron}} {{was attached}} as a direct-reporting unit {{to the newly}} promoted General Twiggs' 1st Texas Division, which was <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>committed</b> to {{the north side of}} Monterrey. On September 21, Taylor launched his attack on the city, but failed to synchronize his two forces. Poor Mexican leadership allowed the Americans to avert disaster, and after some intense urban fighting, General Ampudia offered Taylor an eight-week ceasefire that was highly favorable to the Mexicans. Taylor accepted, which caused President James K. Polk, furious at the agreement, to transfer most of his forces to Winfield Scott.|$|E

5|$|On June 15, 1928, Horch {{arranged}} for the American Bond and Mortgage Company to underwrite a bond of $1,925,000 to cover costs. The bonds, which were linked {{to the price of}} gold, were certificates held under a trust mortgage with the Chatham Phenix National Bank and Trust Company. Prospective purchasers of the bonds were told that Horch and an associate guaranteed payment of principal and interest personally and that the income from rentals was expected far to exceed expenses, including both interest costs and amounts <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>committed</b> to the sinking fund.|$|E
5|$|After the {{proclamation}} of the People's Republic of Romania on 30 December 1947, {{the existence of}} all parties other than the PCR had become purely formal, and, after the elections of 28 March the one-party state was confirmed by legislation. He was arrested on 5 May 1950, and held in the notorious Sighet prison (alongside three of his brothers — Ștefan Tătărescu included — and his former collaborator Bejan). His son Tudor, who was living in Paris, suffered from schizophrenia after 1950, and had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>committed</b> to an institution (where he died in 1955). Sandra Tătărescu Negropontes was also imprisoned in 1950, and released three years later, upon the death of Joseph Stalin.|$|E
5|$|Despite initial {{skepticism}} in the West, the new Soviet leader proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>committed</b> to {{reversing the}} Soviet Union's deteriorating economic condition instead of continuing {{the arms race}} with the West. Partly {{as a way to}} fight off internal opposition from party cliques to his reforms, Gorbachev simultaneously introduced glasnost, or openness, which increased freedom of the press and the transparency of state institutions. Glasnost was intended to reduce the corruption {{at the top of the}} Communist Party and moderate the abuse of power in the Central Committee. Glasnost also enabled increased contact between Soviet citizens and the western world, particularly with the United States, contributing to the accelerating détente between the two nations.|$|E

5|$|The Battle of Bardia {{brought to}} the fore the {{simmering}} hostility between regular officers and reservists. Frank Berryman, the 6th Division's General Staff Officer (Grade 1), and Alan Vasey, the Deputy Assistant Adjutant and Quartermaster General (DA), were eager for Robertson to do well and show that Staff Corps officers could make good commanders, and if {{that could be done}} at the expense of an old-style reservist like Stanley Savige, so much the better. They pushed for Robertson's 19th Infantry Brigade, then in reserve, <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>committed</b> when the attack by Savige's 17th Infantry Brigade slowed down. The abrupt manner in which this was done generated antipathy between Robertson and Savige.|$|E
5|$|Towards 15:00, {{after hours}} of resistance, the Russian army was in dire straits, but the French forces were {{exhausted}} and had neither the necessary stamina nor the necessary will to carry out another assault. At this crucial juncture, Murat's chief of staff, General Augustin Daniel Belliard rode straight to the Emperor's Headquarters and, according to General Ségur who wrote {{an account of the}} campaign, told him that the Russian line had been breached, that the road to Mozhaysk, behind the Russian line, was visible through the gaping hole the French attack had pierced, that an enormous crowd of runaways and vehicles were hastily retreating, and that a final push would be enough to decide the fate of the Russian army and of the war. Generals Daru, Dumas and Marshal Louis Alexandre Berthier also joined in and told the Emperor that everyone thought the time had come for the Guard <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>committed</b> to battle.|$|E
5|$|The AN {{comprised}} one {{battalion of}} infantry of 1,000men hurriedly enlisted in Sydney, plus 500naval reservists and ex-sailors who {{would serve as}} infantry. The 1st Battalion, AN was commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Russell Watson, while the naval reservists were formed into six companies under Commander Joseph Beresford. Also included were two machine gun sections, a signals section and a medical detachment. Another battalion of militia from the Queensland-based Kennedy Regiment—which had been dispatched to garrison Thursday Island—also contributed 500volunteers. Recruitment began on 11 August, with the {{very few of the}} infantry having had previous military experience. Under the overall command of Colonel William Holmes, the force departed Sydney on 19 August aboard HMAS Berrima and halted at Palm Island off Townsville until a New Zealand force, escorted by the battlecruiser HMAS Australia, cruiser HMAS Melbourne and the French cruiser Montcalm, occupied Samoa on 30 August. The AN then moved to Port Moresby, where it met the Queensland contingent already aboard the transport Kanowna. The force sailed for German New Guinea on 7 September, although Kanowna was left behind when her stokers refused to work. The militia were also left in Port Moresby after Holmes decided they were not sufficiently trained or equipped <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>committed</b> to the anticipated fighting.|$|E

25|$|MacArthur {{deployed}} the AIF {{divisions in}} secondary assignments during 1944–45, where they often fought what many {{considered to be}} pointless battles.
