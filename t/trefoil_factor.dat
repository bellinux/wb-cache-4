50|$|Trefoil factors (TFF) are {{secretory}} {{products of}} mucin producing cells. They {{play a key}} role in the maintenance of the surface integrity of oral mucosa and enhance healing of the gastrointestinal mucosa by a process called restitution. TFF comprises the gastric peptides (TFF1), spasmolytic peptide (TFF2), and the intestinal <b>trefoil</b> <b>factor</b> (TFF3, this protein). They have an important and necessary role in epithelial restitution within the gastrointestinal tract. Significant amounts of TFF are present in human milk. Evidence has been presented that TFF3 isolated from milk strongly correlates with downregulation of IL-6 and IL-8 in human intestinal epithelial cells. On the other hand, TFF3 activated the epithelial cells in culture to produce beta defensins 2 (hBD2) and beta defensins 4 (hBD4). These findings suggest that TFF can activate intestinal epithelial cells and could actively participate in the immune system of breastfed babies by inducing the production of peptides related to innate defence, such as defensins.|$|E

TFF 3 is also synthesized in the hypothalamus and has anxiolytic or anxiogenic activities when {{injected into the}} rat amygdala.

Generally, TFF 3 -positive cells are co-localized in oxytocin-producing cells and not in vasopressin-producing cells. Relatively large amounts of TFF 3 —but not TFF 1 and TFF 2 —are present in the posterior lobe of the human pituitary, where it is probably released into the bloodstream. Furthermore, TFF 3 was also detectable in human postmortem cerebrospinal fluid. —Jagla, W. ...|$|R
40|$|<b>Trefoil</b> <b>factors</b> (TFFs), in {{particular}} TFF 1, are classical estrogen-regulated genes and {{have served as}} markers of estrogen gene regulation by various environmental estrogens. TFFs are also regulated by several other factors including growth hormone (hGH), insulin-like growth factor- 1 (IGF- 1), epidermal growth factor (EGF) and various oncogenic stimuli. TFFs are secreted proteins present in serum and possess the potential to act as growth factors promoting cell survival, anchorage-independent growth and motility. Recent compelling evidence has emerged from experimental and clinical studies to indicate a pivotal role of TFFs in oncogenic transformation, growth and metastatic extension of common human solid tumours.

40|$|Abstract. <b>Trefoil</b> <b>factor</b> 2 (TFF 2) is {{a member}} of <b>trefoil</b> <b>factor</b> family found to be overexpressed in many cancers {{including}} cholangiocarcinoma (CCA). The majority of studies have focused on wild-type TFF 2 (wtTFF 2) expression, but informa-tion regarding alternative splicing variants of TFF 2 mRNA has not been reported. In this study, we aimed to identify and quantify a novel TFF 2 splice variant in cholangiocarcinoma (CCA). Seventy-eight tumors and 15 normal adjacent tissues were quantified for the expression of the TFF 2 splice variant relative to wild-type (wt) TFF 2 mRNA using quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (QRT-PCR). The ratio of TFF 2 splice variant against wtTFF 2 was analyzed for associations with clinical parameters. We found a novel TFF 2 splice variant, exon 2 skipping (∆EX 2 TFF 2), resulting in a stop codon (TAG) at exon 1. The ∆EX 2 TFF 2 /wtTFF 2 ratio in tumors was significantly higher than in normal tissue (P< 0. 01). Interestingly, high ∆EX 2 TFF 2 /wtTFF 2 ratio was significantly associated with good prognosis compared with low ratio (P= 0. 017). In contrast, the presence of wtTFF 2 protein was associated with poor survival of CCA patients (P= 0. 034).

40|$|<b>Trefoil</b> <b>factors</b> (TFFs) are {{gastrointestinal}} peptides {{playing an}} essential role in the epithelial restitution. Among the three known TFF peptides, TFF 1 is characterized by three disulfide bonds producing a compact globular structure and an extended and disordered tail formed by amino- and carboxy-termini. The presence of a cysteine surrounded by several nega- tively charged residues in this region of the protein, highly conserved in different species, suggests the possible formation of a metal-binding site. Affinity chromatography and mass spectrometric analyses allowed us to demonstrate a selective binding affinity of TFF 1 for copper. The binding induces conformational changes in the tertiary structure as demon- strated by circular dichroism experiments, while limited proteolysis revealed an altered access to the cleavage sites in the amino- and carboxy-termini. The results of this study reveal a new property of TFF 1 and suggest that copper could influence its biological activities by interfering with the dimerization of the peptide and/or the interaction with mucins or putative TFF receptors. ￼￼￼# 2007 Elsevier Inc.

One day after DSS treatment the colonic and cecal tissues and fecal samples were collected and analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR. Whey protein significantly increased cecal LGG content. MUC 1 expression was induced by DSS and soy protein dramatically suppressed it. TFF 3 was upregulated by DSS and decreased by soy and whey protein. Soy protein also reduced the inflammatory scores, TNF-α and prevented colon shortening. LGG did not have effect on these parameters.

30|$|<b>Trefoil</b> <b>factors</b> 2 / 3 (TFF 2 and TFF 3) {{are members}} of the trefoil family which are {{expressed}} in gastrointestinal mucosa. TFF 3 is expressed in fetal human and newborn rat pancreas. Strong expression of TFF 3 was found in islets and some pancreatic duct cells. There was significant expression of TFF 3 mRNA in human islet samples examined. Exogenous TFF 3 promoted islet cell attachment and migration, but had no effect on proliferation (Jackerott et al., 2006). However, over-expression of TFF 3 in a RIN cell line and rat islets using recombinant adenovirus lead to an increased proliferation which can be arrested by knockdown of TFF 3 using siRNA. Mediated by SDF- 1 α/CXCR 4 signaling, another family member TFF 2 promotes cell proliferation through increasing ERK 1 / 2 phosphorylation in rat INS- 1 cells, mouse MIN 6 cells, and mouse islets (Orime et al., 2013). As TFF 2 is not expressed in pancreatic islets (Jackerott et al., 2006), circulating TFF 2 may enhance pancreatic β-cell expansion by interacting with its receptor. The serum TFF 2 levels are reportedly increased during pregnancy (Samson et al., 2008; 2011). Thus, TFF 2 might contribute to pancreatic β-cell expansion during pregnancy.|$|R
