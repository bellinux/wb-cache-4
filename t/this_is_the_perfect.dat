The Ganesha idols include {{the images of the}} eight avatars of Ganesha described in Mudgala Purana – Vakratunda, Mahodara, Ekadanta, Vikata, Dhrumavarna, Vighnaraja and Lambodara – positioned in eight corners of the temple. Some of the images are installed by the Yogendra Ashram followers. One more noteworthy Ganesha idol is of [...] "Sakshi Vinayaka" [...] who is [...] "a witness" [...] to the prayers offered to Mayureshwara. Traditionally, first [...] "Nagna Bhairava" [...] is prayed then Mayureshwara and then Sakshi Vinayaka. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>perfect</b> sequence for prayers offered here.|$|E

He noted his love of the experience, as it permitted him to grow closer with the series' actors and [...] "actually work with them on a level that [...] before and really get down there with them." [...] Wyman was originally supposed to direct several episodes the previous year and earlier in the season, but found he was too busy. He explained, [...] "Then an episode was coming up that we were thinking about writing and I really felt close to it. [...] The opportunity came up where somebody had fallen out and I felt that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>perfect</b> time because everything was completely under control. [...] It allowed me to go and do it. [...] It's an episode that's really close to me. [...] It's about love and it's about all the great things that we talk about on Fringe." ...|$|E

Bergman said:I thought immediately, ‘Didn’t they do a movie?’ It’s like, they seemed so perfect for each other! Their personalities, you have a rabbit and a tortoise. You get a hysteric, a person who seems to have no feelings whatsoever…and I hate constructing plots, hate it more than anything, but I love constructing characters, and <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>perfect</b> thing where <b>the</b> characters <b>were</b> <b>the</b> plot.

50|$|Acompáñame (English: Accompany me) is {{a studio}} album by Mexican pop singers Yuri and Mijares. Released on 25 April 2006, {{the idea to}} record {{together}} came after both had previously performed at the Auditorio Nacional in Mexico City. The album consisted mostly {{of some of the}} most beloved Spanish love songs from the 1980s. <b>The</b> lead single <b>was</b> non-cover track “Y Llegaste Tú". In interviews, Yuri stated that, “Upon the initial invitation by Mijares to record together, I felt <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>perfect</b> moment for <b>this</b> record”. It went on to sell more than 100,000 earning Platinum disc.|$|R
2500|$|Burke herself {{described}} the song as [...] "reggae meets R." [...] According to the singer, {{the song was}} inspired by her British Jamaican background and new convertible. Burke told The Sun, [...] "I really {{wanted to have a}} tune I could take down my roof to, drive along and be proud of. I didn't really want to do a ballad. I love the summer and <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>perfect</b> track to dance to." [...] "Start Without You" [...] is an uptempo R song which draws from reggae fusion and dancehall influences, with a length of three minutes and thirty-three seconds, penned by RedOne, Bilal Hajji, Savan Kotecha, and Julian Bunetta. It is infused with power pop melodies in the chorus. Many critics have noted the song's resemblance to a nursery rhyme, that is Polly Wolly Doodle, but the mood reminds of Boney M's Hooray! Hooray! It's a Holi-Holiday.|$|E

50|$|After {{initially}} becoming {{interested in}} {{the music of the}} trance and pop duo fripSide, Mototaka Segawa of the band Move approached fripSide's Satoshi Yaginuma at the Animelo Summer Live concert in August 2010 wanting to collaborate with him. Around the same time, Segawa took notice of Maon Kurosaki, who at the time had just released her debut album H.O.T.D. under Geneon in September 2010. Segawa contacted Kurosaki through Yaginuma, because fripSide is also under Geneon. When Yaginuma received the request to create an ending theme for the 2011 anime television series Shakugan no Shana Final, he thought <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>perfect</b> chance to collaborate with Segawa and Kurosaki.|$|R
50|$|Geldof {{explained}} how he wrote <b>the</b> song:I <b>was</b> doing a radio interview in Atlanta with Johnnie Fingers {{and there was}} a telex machine beside me. I read it as it came out. Not liking Mondays as a reason for doing somebody in is a bit strange. I was thinking about it {{on the way back to}} the hotel and I just said 'Silicon chip inside her head had switched to overload'. I wrote that down. And the journalists interviewing her said, 'Tell me why?' It was such a senseless act. It <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>perfect</b> senseless act and <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>perfect</b> senseless reason for doing it. So perhaps I wrote <b>the</b> <b>perfect</b> senseless song to illustrate it. It wasn't an attempt to exploit tragedy.|$|R

60|$|And as we see, the {{establishment}} of the upper love-and-cognition circuit inevitably provokes the lower sex-sensual centers into action, even though there be no correspondence on the sensual plane between the two individuals concerned. Then see what happens. If {{you want to see the}} real desirable wife-spirit, look at a mother with her boy of eighteen. How she serves him, how she stimulates him, how her true female self is his, is wife-submissive to him as never, never it could be to a husband. This is the quiescent, flowering love of a mature woman. It is the very flower of a woman's love: sexually asking nothing, asking nothing of the beloved, save that he shall be himself, and that for his living he shall accept the gift of her love. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>perfect</b> flower of married love, which a husband should put in his cap as he goes forward into the future in his supreme activity. For the husband, it is a great pledge, and a blossom. For the son also it seems wonderful. The woman now feels for the first time as a true wife might feel. And her feeling is towards her son.|$|E
60|$|Now, {{we may see}} this, {{above all}}, in The adorable Name of Jesus. That name, above all others, ought to show us what a name means; {{for it is the}} name of the Son of Man, the one perfect and sinless man, the pattern of all men; and {{therefore}} it must be a perfect name, and a pattern for all names; and it was given to the Lord not by man, but by God; not after He was born, but before He was conceived in the womb of the blessed Virgin. And therefore, it must show and mean not merely some outward accident about Him, something which He seemed to be, or looked like, in men's eyes: no, the Name of Jesus must mean what the Lord was in the sight of His Father in Heaven; what He was in the eternal purpose of God the Father; what He was, really and absolutely, in Himself; it must mean and declare the very substance of His being. And so, indeed, it does; for The adorable Name of Jesus means nothing else but God the Saviour--God who saves. This is His name, and was, and ever will be. This Name He fulfilled on earth, and proved it to be His character, His exact description, His very Name, in short, which made Him different from all other beings in heaven or earth, create or uncreate; and therefore, He bears His name to all eternity, for a mark of what He has been, and is, and will be for ever--God the Saviour; and <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>perfect</b> name, the pattern of all other names of men.|$|E

25|$|Commonly misconceived as {{a weapon}} {{designed}} to kill populations and leave infrastructure intact, these bombs (as mentioned above) are still very capable of leveling buildings over a large radius. The intent of their design was to kill tank crews – tanks giving excellent protection against blast and heat, surviving (relatively) very close to a detonation. And with the Soviets' vast tank battalions during <b>the</b> Cold War, <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>perfect</b> weapon to counter them. The neutron radiation could instantly incapacitate a tank crew out to roughly the same distance that the heat and blast would incapacitate an unprotected human (depending on design). The tank chassis would also be rendered highly radioactive, temporarily preventing its re-use by a fresh crew.|$|R
25|$|Gryce and {{the other}} {{personnel}} from the Hampton Band returned to New York in November 1953, where the hard bop scene {{was just beginning to}} gain traction. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>perfect</b> time for Gryce to arrive on the scene. Soon after his return, he recorded with Henri Renaud, and Art Blakey recorded seven of Gryce's songs for EmArcy records. Gryce formed a quintet with Farmer in March 1954, which first recorded for Prestige Records in May of that year. Personnel included pianist Horace Silver, bassist Percy Heath, and Drummer Kenny Clarke. Gryce's works with Farmer are some of his most influential and best known. In June of that year Gryce again recorded with Farmer, this time exclusively as composer and arranger. By the time Farmer and Gryce began their third project, they had hit their creative stride.|$|R

While most of the Shanghai Cable 02 players had a season of playing third tier football Xu Genbao's desire to immediately merge them into the Shanghai Shenhua would prove to be a disaster during his reign and his temper did not bring out the best from his players. With Shenhua flirting with relegation he was essentially sacked from his post as manager with Wu Jingui taking over.
