25|$|A {{significant}} {{advantage of}} asset-backed securities for loan originators (with associated disadvantages for investors) {{is that they}} bring together a pool of financial assets that otherwise could not easily be traded in their existing form. By pooling together a large portfolio of these illiquid assets they can be converted into instruments that may be offered and sold freely in the capital markets. The <b>tranching</b> of these securities into instruments with theoretically different risk/return profiles facilitates marketing of the bonds to investors with different risk appetites and investing time horizons.|$|E

50|$|The coupon stream {{from the}} {{mortgage}} collateral {{can also be}} restructured (analogous {{to the way the}} principal stream is structured). This coupon stream allocation is performed after prepayment <b>tranching</b> is complete. If the coupon <b>tranching</b> is done on the collateral without any prepayment <b>tranching,</b> then the resulting tranches are called 'strips'. The benefit is that the resulting CMO tranches can be targeted to very different sets of investors. In general, coupon <b>tranching</b> will produce a pair (or set) of complementary CMO tranches.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Tranching</b> {{refers to}} the {{creation}} of different classes of securities (typically with different credit ratings) from the same pool of assets. It is an important concept, because it is the system used to create different investment classes for the securities. <b>Tranching</b> allows the cash flow from the underlying asset to be diverted to various investor groups. The Bank for International Settlements Committee on the Global Financial System explains <b>tranching</b> as follows: [...] "A key goal of the <b>tranching</b> process is to create at least one class of securities whose rating is higher than the average rating of the underlying collateral pool or to create rated securities from a pool of unrated assets. This is accomplished through the use of credit support (enhancement), such as prioritization of payments to the different tranches." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{simplest}} coupon <b>tranching</b> is {{to allocate}} the coupon stream to an IO, {{and the principal}} stream to a PO. This is generally only done on the whole collateral without any prepayment <b>tranching,</b> and generates strip IOs and strip POs. In particular FNMA and FHLMC both have extensive strip IO/PO programs (aka Trusts IO/PO or SMBS) which generate very large, liquid strip IO/PO deals at regular intervals.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Tranching</b> can add {{complexity}} to deals. Beyond {{the challenges}} posed by {{estimation of the}} asset pool's loss distribution, <b>tranching</b> requires detailed, deal-specific documentation {{to ensure that the}} desired characteristics, such as the seniority ordering the various tranches, will be delivered under all plausible scenarios. In addition, complexity may be further increased by the need to account for the involvement of asset managers and other third parties, whose own incentives to act in the interest of some investor classes {{at the expense of others}} may need to be balanced.|$|E
50|$|All the <b>tranches</b> {{together}} make up what {{is referred}} to as the deal's capital structure or liability structure. They are generally paid sequentially from the most senior to most subordinate (and generally unsecured), although certain <b>tranches</b> with the same security may be paid pari passu. The more senior rated <b>tranches</b> generally have higher bond credit ratings (ratings) than the lower rated <b>tranches.</b> For example, senior <b>tranches</b> may be rated AAA, AA or A, while a junior, unsecured tranche may be rated BB. However, ratings can fluctuate after the debt is issued and even senior <b>tranches</b> could be rated below investment grade (less than BBB). The deal's indenture (its governing legal document) usually details the payment of the <b>tranches</b> in a section often referred to as the waterfall (because the moneys flow down).|$|R
5000|$|To {{deal with}} the problem {{investment}} bankers [...] "recycled" [...] the mezzanine <b>tranches,</b> selling them to underwriters making more structured securities—CDOs. Though the pool that made up the CDO collateral might be overwhelmingly mezzanine <b>tranches,</b> most of the <b>tranches</b> (70 to 80%)of the CDO were rated not BBB, A-, etc., but triple A. The minority of the <b>tranches</b> that were mezzanine were often bought up by other CDOs, concentrating the lower rated <b>tranches</b> still further. (see chart on [...] "The Theory of How the Financial System Created AAA-rated Assets out of Subprime Mortgages") ...|$|R
5000|$|To use up the MBS <b>tranches</b> {{lower in}} payback {{priority}} {{that could not}} be rated triple-A and that a conservative fixed income market would not buy, investment banks developed another security - known as the collateralized debt obligation (CDO). Although the CDO market was smaller, it was crucial because unless buyers were found for the non-triple-A or [...] "mezzanine" [...] <b>tranches,</b> it would not be profitable to make a mortgage-backed security in the first place. These CDOs pooled the leftover BBB, A-, etc. rated <b>tranches,</b> and produced new <b>tranches</b> - 70% to 80% of which were rated triple A by rating agencies. The 20-30% remaining mezzanine <b>tranches</b> were sometimes bought up by other CDOs, to make so-called [...] "CDO-Squared" [...] securities which also produced <b>tranches</b> rated mostly triple A.|$|R
5000|$|All of the {{available}} principal payments go to the first sequential tranche, until its balance is decremented to zero, then to the second, and so on. There are several reasons {{that this type of}} <b>tranching</b> would be done: ...|$|E
50|$|Synthetic CDOs were {{criticized in}} particular, {{because of the}} {{difficulties}} to judge (and price) the risk inherent {{in that kind of}} securities correctly. That adverse effect roots in the pooling and <b>tranching</b> activities on every level of the derivation.|$|E
50|$|This type of <b>tranching</b> has a bond (often {{called a}} PAC or TAC bond) which has even less {{uncertainty}} than a sequential bond by receiving prepayments {{according to a}} defined schedule. The schedule is maintained by using support bonds (also called companion bonds) that absorb the excess prepayments.|$|E
50|$|This type of tranche {{supports}} other <b>tranches</b> by {{not receiving}} an interest payment. The interest payment {{that would have}} accrued to the Z tranche is used {{to pay off the}} principal of other bonds, and the principal of the Z tranche increases. The Z tranche starts receiving interest and principal payments only after the other <b>tranches</b> in the CMO have been fully paid. This type of tranche is often used to customize sequential <b>tranches,</b> or VADM <b>tranches.</b>|$|R
40|$|Based on {{a sample}} of 3254 {{floating}} rate <b>tranches</b> from 617 ABS-CDOs (collateralized debt obligations backed by asset-backed securities), this paper tests the “rating overdependence” hypothesis – i. e., that ratings of structured products are a sufficient statistic (in terms of predicting future credit performance) for yield spreads at origination. The paper’s findings are fourfold. First, yield spreads at issuance predict future performance of ABS-CDO <b>tranches</b> even after controlling for {{the information contained in}} ratings. Second, the ability of yield spreads to predict future performance, however, is driven exclusively by ratings below AAA (and, to a lesser extent, also by the lowest priority AAA <b>tranches),</b> whereas spreads of super senior AAA <b>tranches</b> show no information content. Third, the predictive ability of yield spreads is lower for <b>tranches</b> from later vintages and for <b>tranches</b> from deals with more complex collateral pools. Fourth, the conditional correlation between ratings and spreads, in turn, is increasing in time and higher for <b>tranches</b> from complex deals. In sum, the evidence indicates that investors in (especially AAA) <b>tranches</b> from later and more complex deals have avoided performing costly due diligence on the securities they bought...|$|R
40|$|We {{estimate}} {{holdings of}} highly-rated <b>tranches</b> of mortgage securitizations of American deposit-taking banks {{ahead of the}} credit crisis and evaluate hypotheses that have been advanced to explain these holdings. We find that holdings of highly-rated <b>tranches</b> were economically trivial for the typical bank, but banks with greater holdings performed more poorly during the crisis. Though univariate comparisons show that banks with large trading books had greater holdings, the holdings of highly-rated <b>tranches</b> are not higher for banks with large trading books in regressions that control for bank size. The ratio of highly-rated <b>tranches</b> holdings to assets increases with bank assets, but not for banks with more than $ 50 billion of assets. This evidence is inconsistent with explanations for holdings of highly-rated <b>tranches</b> that emphasize the incentives of banks deemed "too-big-to-fail". Further, the evidence does not provide support for "bad incentives" theories of holdings of highly-rated <b>tranches.</b> We find, however, that banks active in securitization held more highly-rated <b>tranches.</b> Such a result can be consistent with regulatory arbitrage {{as well as with}} securitizing banks holding highly-rated <b>tranches</b> to convince investors of the quality of these securities. Our evidence supports the latter hypothesis. ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{most common}} form of credit {{protection}} is called credit <b>tranching.</b> In the simplest case, credit <b>tranching</b> means that any credit losses will be absorbed by the most junior class of bondholders until the principal value of their investment reaches zero. If this occurs, the next class of bonds absorb credit losses, and so forth, until finally the senior bonds begin to experience losses. More frequently, a deal is embedded with certain [...] "triggers" [...] related to quantities of delinquencies or defaults in the loans backing the mortgage pool. If a balance of delinquent loans reaches a certain threshold, interest and principal that would be used to pay junior bondholders is instead directed to pay off the principal balance of senior bondholders, shortening the life of the senior bonds.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Tranching</b> can be {{very helpful}} in many {{different}} circumstances. For those investors that have to invest in highly rated securities, {{they are able to}} gain [...] "exposure to asset classes, such as leveraged loans, whose performance across the business cycle may differ from that of other eligible assets." [...] So essentially it allows investors to further diversify their portfolio.|$|E
50|$|Some bonds {{cover the}} risk that {{multiple}} losses will occur. The first-second event bond (Atlas Re) was issued in 1999. The first third event bond (Atlas II) was issued in 2001. Subsequently, bonds triggered by fourth through ninth losses have been issued, including Avalon, Bay Haven, and Fremantle, each of which apply <b>tranching</b> technology to baskets of underlying events. The first actively managed pool of bonds and other contracts ("Catastrophe CDO") called Gamut was issued in 2007, with Nephila as the asset manager.|$|E
5000|$|This {{simply means}} <b>tranches</b> that pay down [...] The coupons on the <b>tranches</b> {{would be set}} so that in {{aggregate}} the <b>tranches</b> pay {{the same amount of}} interest as the underlying mortgages. The <b>tranches</b> could be either fixed rate or floating rate. If they have floating coupons, they would have a formula that make their total interest equal to the collateral interest. For example, with collateral that pays a coupon of 8%, you could have two <b>tranches</b> that each have half of the principal, one being a floater that pays LIBOR with a cap of 16%, the other being an inverse floater that pays a coupon of 16% minus LIBOR.|$|R
5000|$|To sell these [...] "mezzanine" [...] <b>tranches,</b> {{investment}} bankers pooled them to form another security—known as a collateralized debt obligation (CDO). Though {{the raw material}} of these [...] "obligations" [...] {{was made up of}} BBB, A−, etc. <b>tranches,</b> the CRAs rated 70% to 80% of the new CDO <b>tranches</b> triple A. The 20-30% remaining mezzanine <b>tranches</b> were usually bought up by other CDOs, to make so-called [...] "CDO-Squared" [...] securities which also produced <b>tranches</b> rated mostly triple A by rating agencies. This process was disparaged as a way of transforming [...] "dross into gold" [...] or [...] "ratings laundering" [...] by at least some business journalists.|$|R
5000|$|On July 10, 2007, in [...] "an {{unprecedented}} move", Moody's downgraded 399 subprime {{mortgage-backed securities}} {{that had been}} issued the year before. Three months later, it downgraded another 2506 <b>tranches</b> ($33.4 billion). By {{the end of the}} crisis, Moody's downgraded 83% of all the 2006 Aaa mortgage backed security <b>tranches</b> and all of the Baa <b>tranches.</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{significant}} {{advantage of}} asset-backed securities for loan originators (with associated disadvantages for investors) {{is that they}} bring together a pool of financial assets that otherwise could not easily be traded in their existing form. By pooling together a large portfolio of these illiquid assets they can be converted into instruments that may be offered and sold freely in the capital markets.

50|$|A {{special case}} of {{parallel}} <b>tranching</b> {{is known as}} the IO/PO split. IO and PO refer to Interest Only and Principal Only. In this case, one tranche would have a coupon of zero (meaning that it would get no interest at all) and the other would get all of the interest. These bonds could be used to speculate on prepayments. A principal only bond would be sold at a deep discount (a much lower price than the underlying mortgage) and would rise in price rapidly if many of the underlying mortgages were prepaid. The interest only bond would be very profitable if few of the mortgages prepaid, but could get very little money if many mortgages prepaid.|$|E
5000|$|Tranches {{allow for}} the [...] "ability to create one or more classes of {{securities}} whose rating {{is higher than the}} average rating of the underlying collateral asset pool or to generate rated securities from a pool of unrated assets". [...] "This is accomplished through the use of credit support specified within the transaction structure to create securities with different risk-return profiles. The equity/first-loss tranche absorbs initial losses, followed by the mezzanine tranches which absorb some additional losses, again followed by more senior tranches. Thus, due to the credit support resulting from <b>tranching,</b> the most senior claims are expected to be insulated - except in particularly adverse circumstances - from default risk of the underlying asset pool through the absorption of losses by the more junior claims." ...|$|E
50|$|Another {{interesting}} {{characteristic of}} synthetic CDOs {{is that they}} are not usually fully funded like money market funds or other conventional investments. In other words, a synthetic CDO covering $1 billion of credit risk will not actually sell $1 billion in notes, but will raise some smaller amount. That is, only the most risky <b>tranches</b> are fully funded and the less risky <b>tranches</b> are not; after all, the entire point of structuring risk into <b>tranches</b> is that the less risky <b>tranches</b> are supposed to be inherently less likely to suffer default.|$|R
5000|$|The rise of [...] "ratings arbitrage"—i.e. pooling low-rated <b>tranches</b> to make CDOs—helped push {{sales of}} CDOs to about $500 billion in 2006, {{with a global}} CDO market of over USD $1.5 trillion. CDO was the {{fastest-growing}} sector of the structured finance market between 2003 and 2006; the number of CDO <b>tranches</b> issued in 2006 (9,278) was almost {{twice the number of}} <b>tranches</b> issued in 2005 (4,706).|$|R
50|$|A common analogy {{compares the}} cash {{flow from the}} CDO's {{portfolio}} of securities (say mortgage payments from mortgage-backed bonds) to water flowing into cups of the investors where senior <b>tranches</b> were filled first and overflowing cash flowed to junior <b>tranches,</b> then equity <b>tranches.</b> If {{a large portion of}} the mortgages enter default, there is insufficient cash flow to fill all these cups and equity tranche investors face the losses first.|$|R
50|$|The {{principal}} (and associated coupon) stream for CMO collateral can {{be structured}} to allocate prepayment risk. Investors in CMOs {{wish to be}} protected from prepayment risk as well as credit risk. Prepayment risk is the risk that the term of the security will vary according to differing rates of repayment of principal by borrowers (repayments from refinancings, sales, curtailments, or foreclosures). If principal is prepaid faster than expected (for example, if mortgage rates fall and borrowers refinance), then the overall term of the mortgage collateral will shorten, and the principal returned at par will cause a loss for premium priced collateral. This prepayment risk cannot be removed, but can be reallocated between CMO tranches so that some tranches have some protection against this risk, whereas other tranches will absorb more of this risk. To facilitate this allocation of prepayment risk, CMOs are structured such that prepayments are allocated between bonds using a fixed set of rules. The most common schemes for prepayment <b>tranching</b> are described below.|$|E
40|$|Securitizations usually involve {{creating}} multiple tranches of {{a single}} issue with different characteristics which are sold as separate securities. This paper provides the first systematic testing of theoretical explanations of the extent and nature of <b>tranching</b> using a proprietary and comprehensive database of over 5000 separate tranches of European securitizations raising a total of $ 1 trillion. We find increasing use of <b>tranching</b> through our sample period, and support for asymmetric information and market segmentation explanations for <b>tranching.</b> We also show that <b>tranching</b> can increase prices for the issue as a whole...|$|E
40|$|We use data {{comprising}} over 100, 000 {{loans from}} 115 countries during 1995 - 2009 to examine {{factors that affect}} the extent of loan <b>tranching,</b> {{and the range of}} tranche spreads. The data show five factors that drive them: asymmetric information, borrower risk, transaction costs, the presence of institutional investors, and the legal system. <b>Tranching</b> is more extensive and generates greater differences in spreads between tranches of a same loan when asymmetric information and risk are more pronounced. Economic and institutional factors driving <b>tranching</b> are more directly applicable to non-investment grade loans. For developing countries, the data highlight factors that affect the extent of <b>tranching</b> but such factors show little sensitivity to the pricing of the relative spreads. ...|$|E

40|$|We {{examine whether}} rating {{agencies}} (Moody’s and S&P) reward large issuers of mortgage-backed securities, who bring substantial business, by granting them unduly favorable ratings. We also study whether {{and when the}} market begins to realize this incentive. For both AAA and non-AAA rated <b>tranches</b> sold by large issuers, their prices drop more than similar <b>tranches</b> sold by smaller issuers. These differences are concentrated during the market boom years of 2004 through 2006. The initial yield on the <b>tranches</b> sold by large issuers is lower than that on the <b>tranches</b> sold by small issuers during 2000 - 2003, but these patterns reverse during 2004 - 2006...|$|R
50|$|Establishing a senior/subordinated {{structure}} {{is one of}} the most popular techniques to create internal credit enhancement.
