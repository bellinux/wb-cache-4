5|$|Though Scott drew heavily {{upon his}} wife's intense {{personality}} in his writings, {{much of the}} conflict between them stemmed from <b>the</b> <b>boredom</b> and isolation Zelda experienced when Scott was writing. She would often interrupt {{him when he was}} working, and the two grew increasingly miserable throughout the 1920s. Scott had become severely alcoholic, Zelda's behavior became increasingly erratic, and neither made any progress on their creative endeavors.|$|E

5|$|Although {{she enjoyed}} {{motherhood}} and assumed {{primary responsibility for}} rearing the children, Stanton found herself unsatisfied and even depressed {{by the lack of}} intellectual companionship and stimulation in Seneca Falls. Throughout this period of removal from the woman’s movement, Stanton kept in touch with Susan B. Anthony, and writing Anthony’s speeches became one of Stanton’s primary modes of involvement in the movement from afar. Additionally, Stanton often wrote Anthony letters about the difficulties of balancing domestic and public life, especially in a prejudiced society. As another antidote to <b>the</b> <b>boredom</b> and loneliness, Stanton became increasingly involved in the community and, by 1848, had established ties to similarly minded women in the area. By this time, she was firmly committed to the nascent women's rights movement and was ready to engage in organized activism.|$|E

25|$|The lecture circuit {{business}} proved lucrative {{enough for}} Lowe {{to seek out}} the education he so lacked as a child. He tried studying medicine to fulfill his grandmother's wish, but <b>the</b> <b>boredom</b> redirected him to his first interest, aviation with the use of lighter-than-air gases. American balloonists used coke gas to inflate limp silk bags, as opposed to the original French balloons which were cotton weave over rigid frameworks that were stood over fires to collect hot smoke (hot air). By the late 1850s Lowe had become a foremost balloon builder and continued his lucrative business as a showman giving balloon rides to passersby and funfair attendees.|$|E
25|$|Throughout most {{of human}} {{prehistory}} and history, listening to recorded music was not possible. Music {{was made by}} common people during both their work and leisure, as well as during religious activities. The work of economic production was often manual and communal. Manual labor often included singing by the workers, which served several practical purposes. It reduced <b>the</b> <b>boredom</b> of repetitive tasks, it kept the rhythm during synchronized pushes and pulls, and it set the pace of many activities such as planting, weeding, reaping, threshing, weaving, and milling. In leisure time, singing and playing musical instruments were common forms of entertainment and history-telling—even more common than today, when electrically enabled technologies and widespread literacy make other forms of entertainment and information-sharing competitive.|$|E

25|$|Although the {{headquarters}} of the force remained at Fort Selkirk, over the course of October and November 1898, 72 men and one of the Maxim guns were sent to Dawson City to support the mounted police. The Dawson detachment protected the gold held by the various banks in the town, guarded prisoners, helped to construct local hospitals, and took part in fighting fires - the town was built from wood and particularly vulnerable to conflagration. They also carried out some ceremonial duties. The Selkirk garrison was considered to be quite isolated and men were moved between the two sites over the winter to reduce <b>the</b> <b>boredom.</b> During the warmer months of 1899, weekly military exercises were carried out by the force and a rifle range was constructed.|$|E
25|$|The patrol bases were hurriedly created. One of {{the young}} lieutenants who flew from Marfa Field {{in the summer of}} 1919 remembered the flying field as a pasture at the eastern edge of town. Its five hangars were made from canvas. A double row of ten or twelve tents served as officer and enlisted {{quarters}} and sheltered flight headquarters and supply. The lieutenant, Stacy C. Hinkle, recalled his tour of duty on the border as “a life of hardship, possible death, starvation pay, and a lonely life without social contacts, in hot, barren desert wastes, tortured by sun, wind, and sand.” <b>The</b> <b>boredom</b> was as bad as the physical hardship and discomfort, the sole recreation being drinking and gambling. Even so, Hinkle thought the airmen better off than the poor fellows at cavalry outposts up and down the border.|$|E
25|$|Although {{admired by}} his contemporaries, {{he was also}} criticized for using his highly {{efficient}} secret police to spy not only on criminals but also on ordinary citizens. His services opened private letters sent through the mail, which was a frequent practice in Europe at the time, and spied on families. Sartine was thus aware {{of all sorts of}} scandals in the city, notably sexual scandals, and he sent daily reports to the king containing saucy and intimate details about courtiers, clerics, and private citizens, which were said to amuse the king and relieve him from <b>the</b> <b>boredom</b> of court life. Furthermore, his political police was known for its efficiency in detecting agitators, dissenters, anticlerical propagandists, and other people perceived as trouble makers, who were imprisoned without trial through the lettres de cachet. Some sources say that there were never more political prisoners at the Bastille and at the fortress of Vincennes than under his tenure.|$|E

25|$|The Salinas {{prepare to}} attend a ball, {{one of the most}} {{important}} of the Palermo social season. The Prince is both excited and concerned about the evening to come. It will be the first time Angelica and her beauty are to be presented to the public. However, he remains concerned that Don Calogero will make a complete fool of both himself and the Salinas. When Angelica (looking beautiful) and Don Calogero (looking acceptable) arrive shortly after, Angelica, thanks to detailed training in etiquette given to her by Tancredi, makes a huge social success. The Prince, after being satisfied that Angelica has been accepted, wanders through the rooms of the Palazzo Ponteleone where the ball is being held, becoming increasingly gloomy at the callowness of the young men, <b>the</b> <b>boredom</b> in the older men, and the silliness of the girls. The Prince notices Tancredi and Angelica dancing happily together, oblivious to the other's desperation, ambition, and greed. As he watches, the Prince comes to realize and accept, if only for a moment, that whatever happiness the lovers feel is to be celebrated, no matter what.|$|E
25|$|In {{the summer}} of 425 BC, an Athenian fleet {{commanded}} by Eurymedon and Sophocles, with Demosthenes aboard as an advisor, sailed from Athens to campaign in Sicily and assist Athens' democratic allies at Corcyra. Demosthenes held no official position at the time, but was a strategos-elect for the Hellenic year that would begin in midsummer 425, and the two generals had been instructed {{to allow him to}} use the fleet around the Peloponnese if he wished. Once the fleet was at sea, Demosthenes revealed his plan, which he had previously kept secret; he wished to land at and fortify Pylos, which he believed to be a particularly promising site for a forward outpost. (Pylos was a good distance from Sparta by march, and commanded an excellent harbour in the Bay of Navarino.). The generals rejected this plan, but Demosthenes caught a stroke of luck when a storm blew and drove the fleet to the shore at Pylos. Even then the generals refused to order the fortification of the promontory, and Demosthenes was similarly rebuffed when he attempted to appeal directly to the troops and subordinate commanders; only when <b>the</b> <b>boredom</b> of waiting out the storm overcame the Athenians did they set to work building fortifications. Once they began, however, the Athenians worked hard and quickly, and the promontory was fortified and defensible within a few days. The fleet sailed off towards Corcyra, where a Spartan fleet of 60 ships was operating, leaving Demosthenes with five ships and their complements of sailors and soldiers to defend the new fort.|$|E
25|$|Within the Big Five {{model of}} personality, need for {{cognition}} {{has been found}} to relate positively to openness to experience most strongly and to a more moderate extent to conscientiousness, particularly the competence and achievement striving facets, and to relate inversely to an extent to neuroticism. Regarding Cloninger's temperament traits, need for cognition has been related negatively to harm avoidance and positively to persistence and was unrelated to reward dependence or novelty seeking. Need for cognition has only a weak positive relationship with sensation seeking, specifically a weak correlation with <b>the</b> <b>boredom</b> susceptibility subscale but no relationship to the other subscales. Need for cognition has a modest inverse correlation with negative affect. NFC had no significant correlation with a broad measure of overall positive affect, although it was positively correlated with feelings of activity, interest, and alertness. Need for cognition has been positively related to other, theoretically unrelated, personality characteristics such as self-esteem, masculine sex-role attitudes, and absorption. It is also negatively related to social anxiety (more strongly in females than males). It has been speculated that people who more carefully analyse their world feel a greater sense of mastery, and hence greater self-esteem, although {{it is also possible that}} higher self-esteem may lead to greater motivation to engage in thinking. Need for cognition may be related to masculine sex-role due to the stereotype associating masculinity with rationality. Regarding absorption, people high in need for cognition may find it easier to devote their attentional processes exclusively to intellectual tasks. Regarding social anxiety, it is possible that greater attention to cognitive activity may be associated with reduced attention to social cues associated with negative evaluation.|$|E

500|$|Although {{the basic}} idea for the song had been {{discussed}} during the band's flight to England, it didn't actually begin to take shape until the Byrds' November 1965 tour of the U.S. [...] To alleviate <b>the</b> <b>boredom</b> of traveling from show to show during the tour, Crosby had brought along cassette recordings of Ravi Shankar's music and the John Coltrane albums Impressions and Africa/Brass, which were on constant rotation on the tour bus. [...] The influence of these recordings on the band would manifest itself in the music of [...] "Eight Miles High" [...] and its B-side [...] "Why".|$|E
500|$|After {{graduating from}} {{secondary}} school in 1925, Hergé {{enrolled in the}} École Saint-Luc art school, but finding the teaching boring, he left after one lesson. He hoped for {{a job as an}} illustrator alongside Ickx at Le Vingtième Siècle (The Twentieth Century)—a conservative [...] "Catholic Newspaper of Doctrine and Information"—but no positions were available. Instead he got a job in the paper's subscriptions department, starting in September 1925. Despising <b>the</b> <b>boredom</b> of this position, he enlisted for military service before he was called up, and in August 1926 was assigned to the Dailly barracks at Schaerbeek. Joining the first infantry regiment, he was also bored by his military training, but continued sketching and producing episodes of Totor.|$|E
500|$|Amid <b>the</b> <b>boredom</b> of {{the largely}} eventless drift, the crew ate well; ship's stores were boosted by regular hunting parties [...] which brought a harvest of seal and polar bear meat.
