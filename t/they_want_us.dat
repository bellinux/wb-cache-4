Speaking to the Oxford Union on the alleged overshadowing of the EU debate by [...] "UKIP and Tory backbenchers", he said:I took {{the view that}} having fought [...] that we should now work with them, and co-operate, {{and that was my}} first thought about it. Then how I saw how the European Union was developing, it was very obvious that what they had in mind was not democratic. ... And the way that Europe has developed is that the bankers and the multinational corporations have got very powerful positions, and if you come in on their terms, they will tell you what you can and cannot do. And that is unacceptable. My view about the European Union has always been not that I am hostile to foreigners, but that I am in favour of democracy ... I think they're building an empire there, <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>us</b> {{to be a part of}} their empire and I don't want that.|$|E

[...] In September 2011, Pompeo reported that she is open to the idea of extending her contract, if invited. She told TV Guide: [...] "I would never turn up my nose at [...] As long as the stories are honest and truthful, and Patrick [...] and I feel there is material for us to be passionate about, it still beats a 9-to-5 job any day. If I hear from the fans that <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>us</b> to keep going, then I would continue because we owe them everything." [...] E! Online reported in May 2012, that Pompeo, as well as all original cast members have signed on for two more years. With the Huffington Post announcement of season nine having officially been renewed, the contract is set into place for Pompeo to return.|$|E

The season's executive producers were series creator Stephen Hillenburg and Paul Tibbitt, who also acted as the series' showrunner. On March 13, 2008, during the broadcast of the sixth season, the network renewed the show for a seventh season, with 26 episodes in order. Cyma Zarghami, president of Nickelodeon & MTVN Kids and Family Group, said, [...] "The strength of the Nickelodeon brand comes from how we embrace everything important to kids, and how we are with them virtually everywhere <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>us</b> to be. Our open philosophy to give audiences access to everything they love, and our commitment to making relevant and innovative content, have put us at the top of cable, VOD and online. Nickelodeon has strong momentum as a brand and as a business, and we have a great foundation built on great talent and relationships with some of the best creative leaders in our industry." ...|$|E

[...] "The first leftist to go before the Evin commission were those with light, and even completed, sentences." [...] These had no warning of what was in store and many died.|$|R

500|$|Merton Council {{had been}} recommending that Wimbledon {{move to a}} site in nearby Beddington, but this {{proposal}} fell through soon after the move to Selhurst Park. With the inflation in costs {{brought on by the}} foundation of the FA Premier League in 1992, the club soon began to lose money heavily. Rumours that the groundshare would eventually result in the Dons and the Eagles merging led Hammam to say [...] "I’d rather die and have vultures eat my insides than merge with Crystal Palace". In 1992 the Greyhound Racing Association offered to redevelop Wimbledon Stadium (less than a mile from Plough Lane) into a 15,000-seater dog racing and football ground. Hammam was outraged two years later when the council, attempting to retain the Plough Lane site for public use, refused to sanction its sale for a supermarket redevelopment that Hammam said would finance a new ground at the dog racing site. Hammam angrily declared he would look elsewhere, and threatened to change the club's name and remove the double-headed eagle device, a symbol of Wimbledon Borough, from the team's badge. [...] "We have been betrayed," [...] he told the press. [...] "The council say <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>us</b> back, {{but when it comes to}} taking action they don't want to know." ...|$|E
2500|$|Three days later, in the 1986-02-18 Hackney Gazette, Tim Cooper took up Akass's story. He went to Beevers Nursery {{and asked}} parents there what their {{reaction}}s, in turn, {{were to the}} Hackney council statement, itself {{a reaction to the}} claim that Beevers had issued a ban. Cooper's story reported one of the nursery playleaders as saying [...] "We're run by parents and if <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>us</b> to stop singing it, we would. But there have been no complaints so far, though someone once suggested it could be racist." [...] Cooper later stated that there had been no such ban, but that the statement issued by Millwood and Hackney council had given the story the impetus that it was then to run with: ...|$|E
2500|$|Another strong {{theme from}} {{the album is}} peer pressure, {{particularly}} due to the band's part-Christian-part-mainstream status. The song [...] "Gravity" [...] refers to the opposing influences of Heaven and the secular world pulling the band in opposite directions, whilst [...] "Metamorphis" [...] further explores [...] "the fact that out in the world, although {{everybody wants to be}} their own selves, we're pulled this way and that. Everyone you meet wants you to be something or another. The song asks God to help us to be our own true selves, as God sees us, not the way folk pressure us to be what <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>us</b> to be." [...] "Bliss" [...] deals with accusations of selling out; in the words of Stu G, [...] "we know exactly where we want to go, we want to take our music to the world and have it recognized as being as good as anything that's out there. But we're not going to compromise or back away from our integrity as Christians." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Anti-Defamation League {{has called}} Buchanan an [...] "unrepentant bigot" [...] who [...] "repeatedly demonizes Jews and {{minorities}} and openly affiliates with white supremacists." [...] "There's no doubt," [...] said Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist Charles Krauthammer, [...] "he makes subliminal appeals to prejudice." [...] Buchanan denies {{that he is}} antisemitic, {{and a number of}} his journalistic colleagues, including Murray Rothbard, Justin Raimondo, [...] Jack Germond, Al Hunt and Mark Shields, have defended him against the charge. As a member of the Reagan White House, he is accused of having suppressed the Reagan Justice Department's investigation into Nazi scientists brought to America by the OSS's Operation Paperclip. In the context of the Gulf War, on September 15, 1990, Buchanan appeared on The McLaughlin Group and said that [...] "there are only two groups that are beating the drums for war in the Middle East – the Israeli defense ministry and its 'amen corner' in the United States." [...] He also said: [...] "The Israelis want this war desperately because they want the United States to destroy the Iraqi war machine. <b>They</b> <b>want</b> <b>us</b> to finish them off. They don't care about our relations with the Arab world." [...] Furthermore, on The McLaughlin Group Buchanan has also made such comments as “‘Capitol Hill is Israeli occupied territory’ and ‘If you want to know ethnicity and power in the United States Senate, 13 members of the Senate are Jewish folks who are from 2 percent of the population. That is where real power is at…’” ...|$|E
2500|$|Taboos {{are most}} urgent for {{avoiding}} harm and losses. Inner Commands of the Book of Changes, Ch'ih-sung tzu's Classic, and The Life-dealing Amulets of the Ho-t'u-chi are unanimous {{in saying that}} the gods of heaven and earth who {{are in charge of}} misdeeds make deductions from people's three-day reckonings according to the degree of their wrongdoing. As these reckonings decrease, a man becomes poorer and falls ill; frequently he suffers anxiety. When no more are left, he dies. Since there are hundreds of things that may give rise to deductions, I cannot give a complete account. It is also said that there are Three Corpses [...] in our bodies, which, though not corporeal, actually are of a type with our inner, ethereal breaths, the powers, the ghosts, and the gods [...] <b>They</b> <b>want</b> <b>us</b> to die prematurely. (After death they become a man's ghost and move about at will to where sacrifices and libations are being offered.) Therefore, every fifty-seventh day of the sixty-day cycle they mount to heaven and personally report our misdeeds to the Director of Fates. Further, during the night of {{the last day of the}} month the hearth god also ascends to heaven and makes an oral report of a man's wrongs. For the more important misdeeds [...] a whole period of three hundred days is deducted. For the minor ones they deduct one reckoning , a reckoning being three days. Personally, I have not yet been able to determine whether this is really so or not, but that is because the ways of heaven are obscure, and ghosts and gods are hard to understand. (6, tr. Ware 1966:115-6) ...|$|E

5000|$|Despite their {{exposure}} at the clubs, {{an appearance on}} the television music variety show Shindig!, and more college dates, a breakthrough eluded them and they disbanded by July 1966. [...] Band members felt that the material and direction given to them by record producers were partly to blame. According to Faryar: [...] "I think Herbie their manager steered us into some situations, like with Charlie Calello, where <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>us</b> to think this kind of song, <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>us</b> to {{think that kind of}} song, and we did not thrive in the hands of that kind of direction. We were most successful inventing our own stuff". [...] Yester added: [...] "I wished we would have recorded that folk-rock album, but we never did. The group didn't embrace original material as readily as I thought it should have. If we would have stuck with Chip's and my songs, we would have gotten further in the folk-rock days".|$|R
