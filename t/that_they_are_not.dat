5|$|Each state elects two {{senators}} by statewide popular vote every six years. The {{terms of the}} {{two senators}} are staggered so <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> elected in the same year. Utah's senators are elected in the years from classes I and III. Senators were originally chosen by the Utah House of Representatives until the Seventeenth Amendment came into force in 1913.|$|E
5|$|H3 and H6 do {{not share}} such a convincing suite of Heinrich event {{symptoms}} as events H1, H2, H4, and H5, which has led some researchers to suggest <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> true Heinrich events. That would make Gerard C. Bond's suggestion of Heinrich events fitting into a 7,000-year cycle ("Bond events") suspect.|$|E
5|$|The {{courage and}} obstinacy {{with which the}} Americans fought were the astonishment of everyone, and we now became fully {{convinced}} <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> that contemptible enemy we had hitherto imagined them, incapable of standing a regular engagement {{and that they would}} only fight behind strong and powerful works.|$|E

5|$|Although {{initially}} {{created to}} address the needs of the Chinese-language media market, the media organizations have expanded into dozens of additional languages; The Epoch Times newspaper is distributed across over 30 countries in 17 languages, and NTD Television has a satellite or cable presence in North America, Europe, and Asia, and produces programs in 18 languages. The organizations maintain <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> formally affiliated with Falun Gong, which lacks both a centralized organization and funds. However, most of their staff are Falun Gong practitioners, and many contribute on a volunteer basis.|$|E
5|$|Based on the 2005 British film Kinky Boots, {{written by}} Geoff Deane and Tim Firth and {{inspired}} by true events, the musical {{tells the story}} of Charlie Price. Having inherited a shoe factory from his father, Charlie forms an unlikely partnership with cabaret performer and drag queen Lola to produce a line of high-heeled boots and save the business. In the process, Charlie and Lola discover <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> so different after all.|$|E
50|$|After 1989, the Orthodox Church {{tried to}} explain their {{behaviour}} during the Communist-ruled era. Patriarch Teoctist said <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> collaborators, but rather <b>they</b> <b>were</b> trying to defend {{what was left of}} religion in Romania. In a contradictory statement, Teoctist argued <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> alone in collaboration with the Communist authorities and that every Romanian adult collaborated, one way or the other, with them.|$|R

5|$|Fishers are generalist predators. Although {{their primary}} prey is snowshoe hare and porcupine, {{they are also}} known to {{supplement}} their diet with insects, nuts, berries, and mushrooms. Since they are solitary hunters, their choice of prey is limited by their size. Analyses of stomach contents and scat have found evidence of birds, small mammals, and even moose and deer—the latter two indicating <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> averse to eating carrion. Fishers have been seen to feed on deer carcasses. While the behavior is not common, fishers {{have been known to}} kill larger animals, such as wild turkey, bobcat, and lynx.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, the self-titled 1988 album by {{the band}} Method Actor, which {{featured}} Cassidy, was re-released by the band's guitarist and producer David Lourim with Cassidy's name displayed prominently on the cover. The Cassidy family and Blix Street Records {{filed a lawsuit}} against Lourim, claiming that Cassidy's name was used in a misleading fashion and that Blix Street has exclusive rights to her recordings. Lourim had Cassidy's written permission to release the album, and eventually the cover was changed to look like the original LP album while already released copies were affixed with a sticker indicating <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> solo Eva Cassidy albums.|$|E

5|$|Several common {{birds in}} North America, {{such as the}} house sparrow, the rock pigeon, the European {{starling}} and the mute swan are introduced species, meaning <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> native to this continent but were brought here by humans from Europe or elsewhere. Introduced species are marked on this list as (I). There may be species that have individual escapees or small feral populations in North America that are not on this list. This {{is especially true of}} birds that are commonly held as pets, such as parrots and finches.|$|E
5|$|The shared {{repetitive}} {{nature of}} the phrasing of the texts, apart from Gv and I, suggests to Pozdniakov <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> integral texts, and cannot contain the varied contents which would be expected for history or mythology. In the following table of characters in the Pozdniakov & Pozdniakov inventory, ordered by descending frequency, the first two rows of 26 characters account for 86% of the entire corpus.|$|E
5|$|Transandinomys is a genus of rodents in {{the tribe}} Oryzomyini of family Cricetidae. It {{includes}} two species—T.bolivaris and T.talamancae—found in forests from Honduras in Central America {{south and east}} to southwestern Ecuador and northwestern Venezuela in northern South America. Until 2006, its members {{were included in the}} genus Oryzomys, but phylogenetic analysis showed <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> closely related to the type species of that genus, and they have therefore been placed in a new genus. They may be most closely related to genera like Hylaeamys and Euryoryzomys, which contain very similar species. Both species of Transandinomys have had eventful taxonomic histories.|$|E

While there, he overhears a {{conversation}} between Chi-Ling Cheung (a secret agent of the People's Republic of China) and Byrdoy Tolstov (a professor in applied physics and chemistry). Tolstov reveals <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> mining for uranium, but that they are experimenting with a special compound called tri-nepheline. Tolstov's daughter Alexandria is being held hostage at Security Headquarters (HQ), and Cord rescues her {{with the help of}} Chi, who is suspected of being a spy. Afterwards, Cord plants a bug on a secure server and removes a hard drive containing information relating to the VFF. Cord {{goes to the}} Containment Facility to apprehend Nagarov.|$|E
5|$|Demerits: However, competencies, {{efficiency}} and effectiveness can be unclear and contradictory, especially {{when dealing with}} oversimplified matters. In a dehumanized bureaucracy, inflexible in distributing the job-scope, with every worker having to specialize from day one without rotating tasks for fear of decreasing output, tasks are often routine and can contribute to boredom. Thus, employees can sometimes feel <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> part of the organization's work vision and missions. Consequently, {{they do not have}} any sense of belonging in the long term. Furthermore, this type of organization tends to invite exploitation and underestimate the potential of the employees, as creativity of the workers is brushed aside in favour of strict adherence to rules, regulations and procedures.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though the}} GRC scheme is {{intended}} to ensure minority representation in Parliament, {{it can be said}} that the scheme emphasizes racial consciousness and hence widens the gap between races. It may undermine the esteem of minority candidates as they would not be sure if they are elected on their own merit, or due to the scheme and the merits of the rest of the team of MPs. This would result in minority candidates resenting that they are dependent on the majority to enter Parliament, and the majority candidates believing that minority candidates have insufficient ability. It has also been claimed that the GRC scheme demeans the majority of Singaporeans as it assumes <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> able to see the value or merit of minority candidates, and only vote for candidates with whom they share a common race, culture and language.|$|E

Ice-TV stated <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> able to hire them due to a {{withdrawal}} from two European sponsors. Boey explained that this was the reason for his departure from the show. Ice-TV was replaced by activeTV as the production company for the show's second cycle.|$|R

5|$|Lana {{attempts}} to convince everyone {{that it is}} just a rumour by dating Brendan Bond (Michael Wahr). When Sky finds out that Lana is planning to have sex with Brendan during a party, Sky tries to stop her. Lana tells Sky to leave, but then decides to tell Brendan that she cannot have sex with him because she likes girls. Lana receives anonymous notes in her locker praising her for being brave. However, she is also targeted by a gang of girls who threaten to cut her hair off. Susan decides to get the school involved in a tolerance campaign, but many of the parents protest about it. Sky and Lana begin drawing a cartoon strip together called Freak Girl and The Enigma and Buffy Only (Laura Gordon), the editor of a gay magazine, becomes interested in publishing it. Buffy later asks Lana out on a date, but comes to realise <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> right for each other.|$|E
5|$|Legislative: The {{legislature}} of India is the bicameral parliament. It operates under a Westminster-style {{parliamentary system}} and comprises the upper house called the Rajya Sabha ("Council of States") {{and the lower}} called the Lok Sabha ("House of the People"). The Rajya Sabha is a permanent body that has 245 members who serve in staggered six-year terms. Most are elected indirectly {{by the state and}} territorial legislatures in numbers proportional to their state's share of the national population. All but two of the Lok Sabha's 545 members are directly elected by popular vote; they represent individual constituencies via five-year terms. The remaining two members are nominated by the president from among the Anglo-Indian community, in case the president decides <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> adequately represented.|$|E
5|$|Studies on induced animal {{models of}} human diseases. Here, an animal is treated {{so that it}} {{develops}} pathology and symptoms that resemble a human disease. Examples include restricting {{blood flow to the}} brain to induce stroke, or giving neurotoxins that cause damage similar to that seen in Parkinson's disease. Such studies can be difficult to interpret, and it is argued <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> always comparable to human diseases. For example, although such models are now widely used to study Parkinson's disease, the British anti-vivisection interest group BUAV argues that these models only superficially resemble the disease symptoms, without the same time course or cellular pathology. In contrast, scientists assessing the usefulness of animal models of Parkinson's disease, as well as the medical research charity The Parkinson's Appeal, state that these models were invaluable and that they led to improved surgical treatments such as pallidotomy, new drug treatments such as levodopa, and later deep brain stimulation.|$|E
