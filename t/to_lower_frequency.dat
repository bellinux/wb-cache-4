2500|$|Digital audio, {{programmable}} control: Both {{the audio}} circuit and the additional control circuits are fully digital. The hearing professional programs {{the hearing aid}} with an external computer temporarily connected to the device and can adjust all processing characteristics on an individual basis. Fully digital circuitry allows implementation of many additional features not possible with analog circuitry, {{can be used in}} all styles of hearing aids and is the most flexible; for example, digital hearing aids can be programmed to amplify certain frequencies more than others, and can provide better sound quality than analog hearing aids. Fully digital hearing aids can be programmed with multiple programs that can be invoked by the wearer, or that operate automatically and adaptively. These programs reduce acoustic feedback (whistling), reduce background noise, detect and automatically accommodate different listening environments (loud vs soft, speech vs music, quiet vs noisy, etc.), control additional components such as multiple microphones to improve spatial hearing, transpose frequencies (shift high frequencies that a wearer may not hear <b>to</b> <b>lower</b> <b>frequency</b> regions where hearing may be better), and implement many other features. Fully digital circuitry also allows control over wireless transmission capability for both the audio and the control circuitry. Control signals in a hearing aid on one ear can be sent wirelessly to the control circuitry in the hearing aid on the opposite ear to ensure that the audio in both ears is either matched directly or that the audio contains intentional differences that mimic the differences in normal binaural hearing to preserve spatial hearing ability. Audio signals can be sent wirelessly to and from external devices through a separate module, often a small device worn like a pendant and commonly called a “streamer”, that allows wireless connection to yet other external devices. This capability allows optimal use of mobile telephones, personal music players, remote microphones and other devices. With the addition of speech recognition and internet capability in the mobile phone, the wearer has optimal communication ability in many more situations than with hearing aids alone. This growing list includes voice activated dialing, voice activated software applications either on the phone or on the internet, receipt of audio signals from databases on the phone or on internet, or audio signals from television sets or from global positioning systems. The first practical, wearable, fully digital hearing aid was invented by Maynard Engebretson, Robert E Morley, Jr. and Gerald R Popelka. Their work resulted in US Patent 4,548,082, [...] "Hearing aids, signal supplying apparatus, systems for compensating hearing deficiencies, and methods" [...] by A Maynard Engebretson, Robert E Morley, Jr. and Gerald R Popelka, filed in 1984. This patent formed the basis of all subsequent fully digital hearing aids from all manufacturers, including those produced currently.|$|E

5000|$|With {{more people}} {{becoming}} fluent in multiple languages, the word frequency effect could present differently {{in a first}} language than a second language. One study examined differences in reading across participants who were bilingual in Spanish and English. The participants had varying levels of competence in the second language with more fluent participants demonstrating a stronger word frequency effect. [...] As the word frequency effect increased in both languages, total reading time decreased. In L1 (first language) there were higher skipping rates than in L2 (second language). This suggests that lower frequency words in L2 were harder to process than both high and low frequency words in L1. Familiarity of the language plays {{a large role in}} reacting to the frequency of words. [...] Reaction rates of bilingual adults could also be impacted by age. Older adults were significantly slower to respond <b>to</b> <b>lower</b> <b>frequency</b> words but were faster to process higher frequency words.|$|E
5000|$|With a {{combination}} of voltage-gated calcium channels and calcium sensitive K+ channels, the cells set up an oscillation in voltage and oscillate {{in response to a}} depolarizing stimulus. Ca++ enters the cell and depolarizes it, opening K+ channels which allow K+ to leave and hyperpolarize the cell. Since the exit of K+ from the cell is delayed, the voltage increases, but then with the exit of the K+ the cell overshoots the membrane potential and hyperpolarizes. Different cells have different delays for K+ leaving and thus the voltage oscillates at different frequencies. The delays can be as short as 0.7 ms or as long as 150 ms, whereas the Ca++ [...] entry always occurs within about 1 ms (Fettiplace, 1987). Thus by varying the length of delay for K+ to leave, cells' ion concentrations can oscillate at specific frequencies. Cells with higher oscillating frequencies respond best to higher-frequency sounds, while those with lower frequencies respond best <b>to</b> <b>lower</b> <b>frequency</b> ones. Which cells resonate best with a given sound tells the brain what the frequency of the sound is. Hair cells that respond to high frequency stimuli send information to specific neurons, and the information remains segregated in the brain. Thus, information about sound frequency is preserved, rather than being lost as it would if all information from different hair cells converged on the same neuron or group of neurons.|$|E

40|$|The {{process of}} reading multisyllabic words aloud from print was {{examined}} in 4 experiments. Experiment 1 used multisyllabic words that vary {{in terms of}} the consistency of component spelling-sound correspondences. The stimuli were regular, regular inconsistent, and exception words analogous to the monosyllabic items used in previous tudies. Both regular inconsistent and exception words produced longer naming latencies than regular words. In Experiment 2 these differences between word types were found to be limited <b>to</b> <b>lower</b> <b>frequency</b> items. Experiment 3 showed that effects of number of syllables on naming latency are also limited <b>to</b> <b>lower</b> <b>frequency</b> words. In the final experiment, consistency effects were obtained for both higher and lower frequency words when the stimulus display forced subjects to use syllabic units. Thus, frequency modulates the effects of two aspects of lexical structure [...] consistency of spelling-sound correspondences and number of syllables. The results uggest that the naming of multisyUabic words draws on some of the same knowledge representations and processes as monosyllabic words; however, naming does not require syllabic decomposition. The results are discussed in the context of current models of naming. The process of reading words aloud from print has bee...|$|E
