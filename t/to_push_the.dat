The player's objective {{is to put the}} ingredients into the cooking bowl before they either fall into the dustbins on either side or knock the player into the bowl. As a defence, Charlie the Cook can shoot flour sacks, which will push the ingredients further in the direction they are moving in. Bombs may also spawn in the game, which will allow the player <b>to</b> <b>push</b> <b>the</b> ingredients further than conventional flour sacks. The player has <b>to</b> <b>push</b> <b>the</b> right variety of ingredients into the bowl, which changes for each level.
