Michelle Im, {{writing for the}} Eye of the Tiger referred to the character as [...] "bubbly and spirited", and commented, [...] "Not only was [...] able to nail those vibratos and belting notes in her songs, it was actually her singing them." [...] The Coast News review of the film wrote that Bell [...] "earns top marks" [...] for instilling a spirited sensibility in the clumsy but well-meaning Anna. Cinenerd, a film critic for Blogcritics, commended the actress' singing ability, stating that she and Menzel [...] "sing their hearts out, with two showstoppers in Let it Go and For the First Time in Forever". Colin Covert of Colorado Springs' The Gazette considered Bell's performance as a [...] "flawless delivery". Matt Goldberg extolled the relationship between Anna and her elder sister Elsa, writing, [...] "There's so much to love about Frozen, but {{at the top of}} the list is the emphasis on [...] and Elsa's relationship. Anna still has an infatuation with the charming Hans and romantic chemistry with the flustered Kristoff, but her greatest love is for her sister. [...] is mostly scared and guilt-ridden. She's an incredibly sympathetic character, and it's a fresh spin on depicting estrangement between siblings. Anna has so much life and enthusiasm, and we want to see her share it with Elsa." [...] Magdalena Lachowicz of The Heights referred to this sisterly bond as [...] "what truly makes the film and the moral that comes with it", commenting, [...] "the plot is set up to lead the viewer into thinking that it needs to be true love's kiss—something which Anna then goes to seek. This journey sends her on a difficult adventure in which she learns about both sacrifice and love." [...] Debbie Lynn Elias of Culver City Observer commented, [...] "Female driven with confidence and positivity, Elsa and Anna are like two sides of a coin, both strong, albeit one through power and confidence and the other through clumsy sticktuitiveness and love," [...] while Stephen Holden from The New York Times appreciated that instead of a romantic attachment, it was a sisterly love and devotion that drove the story, which departed greatly from traditional Disney formula. Noah Lee described Anna and Elsa's relationship as [...] "genuine", saying, [...] "watching those themes of family and love versus isolation and fear <b>touched</b> <b>my</b> heart in more ways than one." ...|$|E

He turned around in the crowd and asked, “Who <b>touched</b> <b>my</b> clothes?” [...] “You see the people crowding against you,” his disciples answered, “and yet you can ask, ‘Who touched me?’ ” But Jesus kept looking around to see who had done it.Then the woman, knowing {{what had happened to}} her, came and fell at his feet and, trembling with fear, told him the whole truth. [...] He said to her, “Daughter, your faith has healed you. Go in peace and be freed from your suffering.” ...|$|E

Basso received support {{from a number of}} people including Lance Armstrong. Basso made the announcement to the media in those terms: [...] "I have a bad announcement to give to you guys," [...] Basso said. [...] "On stage 5, I had a really small crash but in the crash I <b>touched</b> <b>my</b> testicle on the saddle and for a few days, I felt a small pain. Yesterday we spoke with the doctor of the Tour de France and we decided to go to make a special analysis in the hospital and the examination gave me bad news. I have a small cancer in the left testicle." ...|$|E

He landed at Le Havre {{and found the}} cathedral at Rouen striking: [...] "the great lion of the north of France ... transcending all that my imagination had pictured.” He reached Paris in December, began to study French, and visited the Louvre [...] "with a throb," [...] describing how his ignorance of art made him feel [...] "cabined cribbed, confined" [...] until repeat visits allowed works by Raphael and Leonardo to change his understanding: [...] "They <b>touched</b> <b>my</b> mind, untutored as it is, like a rich strain of music." [...] He mastered French in six months and attended lectures at the Sorbonne on subjects ranging from geology to Greek history to criminal law. In his journal for January 20, 1838, he noted that one lecturer [...] "had quite a large audience among whom I noticed two or three blacks, or rather mulattos--two-thirds black perhaps--dressed quite à la mode and having the easy, jaunty air of young men of fashion...." [...] who were [...] "well received" [...] by the other students after the lecture. He continued: ...|$|E

Reading a magazine story about a woman's struggle with an eating disorder prompted Barlow to follow the same path. She ate very little and worked out [...] "for {{two or three hours}} per day". Eventually she reached emotional exhaustion. [...] "When I was nineteen, I found myself one day with my cheek pressed against the cold tile of the bathroom floor, with nothing left to give, no energy no hope: I was done trying. As I lay there, God <b>touched</b> <b>my</b> heart. He revealed to me that all my destructive efforts to shrink my body were not making me feel any better about myself [...] I was so completely grateful for His healing that I pledged on that spot to love and serve Him {{for the rest of my}} life." ...|$|E
