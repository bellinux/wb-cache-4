40|$|Part 1 : Simulation, Optimization, Monitoring and Control TechnologyInternational audienceWinter wheat seedtime is {{important}} for wheat growth. It affects the wheat yield and quality. The objective {{of this study is}} monitoring the winter wheat seedtime through remote sensing imagery. Two HJ- 1 B images and one Landsat 5 TM image were used in this study. Three Vegetation Indices, DVI, SAVI and RDVI were calculated. The correlation about the wheat seedtime and VIs were analyzed. The result indicated that wheat growth was negatively correlated with seedtime. Wheat VIs during 40 - 60 days after sowing is best for seedtime monitoring. The correlation coefficient for DVI of November 22 th HJ- 1 B and seedtime reached - 0. 51. The seedtime for whole wheat plant field of Beijing area was inverted through the model.

Applying time-series analytical mechanisms to fuel, biofuel and agricultural commodity prices and production, we estimate the long-rung relationship between energy prices, bioenergy production and the global land use change.

Today, the accumulated amount of oil emulsions and sludge in the nature is estimated to be 1. 2 billion tons. Every year, about 30, 000 hectares of land is damaged (Energy and environment review, 2000). High emission of oil as well as extreme climate conditions have caused large-scale degradation of north ecosystems. Area where oil is extracted intensively are polluted with varies technological components used in the process of prospecting and exploiting oil deposits and especially in the process of oil transportation. The main pollutants are oil, drilling waste and boring solutions (Kapelkina et al, 1998). Oil pollution is connected with oil pipe-lines from oil wells to a basic collector; with oil leakage from protection pools they are overfilled and less often with accident which take place during oil well exploitation and repairing.

In 2003, there were 810 organic business units farming on 255 <b>thousands</b> <b>ha</b> of agricultural land in the Czech Republic, which is 5. 97 % out of the total area of agricultural land in the Czech Re-public. The extent of organic agriculture expanded great-ly in the last decade. Growth can be seen regarding the organically farmed area {{as well as the}} number of organic farms, especially after 1997. Organic farmers are mainly focused on permanent grasslands and cattle breeding. Organic permanent grasslands represented the area of 231 683 ha in 2003, which is 90. 86 % out of total organic land in the Czech Republic. Organic farming on arable land represents only 19 637 ha, what is only 7. 70 % out of total organic land area. Organic agriculture is mainly practised by private farmers, they represent around 92 % out of total number of the certified organic business units. GOALS AND METHODOLOGY The goal {{of this paper is to}} analyse the present state of government support for organic products ‘ supply in the Czech Republic as well as in foreign countries, especial-ly in the EU member countries. The level of government support is considered according to the following crite-ria: – Absolute level of support provided in the Czech Re-public for the development of organic agriculture and evaluation of its effectiveness, – The level of support provided in the Czech Republic as well as in the EU countries per area unit of organic land, – Supports stimulating the expansion of organic agricul-ture by the way of other measures favouring particular-ly organic agriculture in some EU countries.
