2500|$|Innis {{writes that}} the {{military}} organization that expelled the Hyksos enabled the Egyptians to establish and expand an empire that included Syria and Palestine, and that eventually reached the Euphrates. Egyptian administrators used papyrus and a postal service to run the empire, but adopted cuneiform as a more efficient script. The pharaoh Akhnaton tried to introduce Aten, the solar disk as the one true god, a system of worship that would provide a common ideal for the whole empire. But the priests and the people resisted [...] "a single cult in which duty to the empire was the chief consideration." [...] Priestly power, Innis writes, resulted from religious control over the complex and difficult art of writing. The monarch's attempts to maintain an empire extended in space were defeated by a priestly monopoly over knowledge systems concerned with time --- systems {{that began with the}} need for accurate predictions about when the Nile would overflow its banks. Innis argues that priestly theocracy gradually cost Egypt its empire. [...] "Monopoly over writing supported an emphasis on religion and the <b>time</b> <b>concept,</b> which defeated efforts {{to solve the problem of}} space." ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{takes into}} {{consideration}} the main views underlying {{the theory of the}} resource based firm within strategy studies, underscoring their fundamental monotemporal nature and proposing a way to elaborate a multi-temporal view of the firm. By analyzing the link between the <b>time</b> <b>concepts</b> used as bases for the formulation of studies within the strategy field and the types of actor behavior implicitly (or explicitly) entailed by such <b>time</b> <b>concepts,</b> the paper shows the inadequacy of any one of the two monotemporal views of the resource-based firm to encompass all of the main actor behaviors on which the firm’s survival and success increasingly rests. The paper draws on the Austrian process view in economic studies to formulate a methodological framework which consents the elaboration of a multi-temporal view of the resource based firm, in which different <b>time</b> <b>concepts</b> are bridged and in which all main actor behaviors crucial for prolonged firm success are encompassed. Finally, the paper shows how the multi-temporal view of the firm consents with the re-interpretation and maintenance of both the static and the dynamic concepts elaborated within the strategy literature and, eventually, also expands the causal relationships between strategic management {{and a number of other}} areas of inquiry in the management field, such as time-space relationships, the relationship between strategy and entrepreneurship, and the relationship between the former and the evolutionary perspective...|$|R

50|$|Given two events, we {{can always}} say whether one of them {{occurred}} earlier, later or simultaneously. The concept, on which the chronological order of events is based, is called Kaal (Time). Time is an abstract entity and is conceived only through the changes that take, place around us. The Prakriti (Nature) undergoes a continuous transformation or change right {{from the moment of}} the creation of the universe till its dissolution. These changes indicate the incessant flow of time. Even during the dissolution when no change, whatever, occurs, time does not cease to exist. Like all other conscious and inert objects, <b>time</b> <b>concept</b> also rests with the Supreme Being who decides the duration of the dissolution based on this concept alone.

50|$|The Same <b>Time</b> <b>concept</b> {{requires}} dynamically {{different strategies}} {{from that of}} the Classic game. An attack from 2 or more territories to a single enemy territory is called a 'Mass Invasion'. If two different players attack a territory that fails to defend them, then a 'Spoils of War' battle ensues {{at the end of the}} turn between the two armies who fought for the territory in question. A player may only move through one territory at a time when attacking, although each player is granted a 'Surge Attack', which can be used to thrust a designated number of soldiers from a newly acquired territory into a neighboring one. If two armies meet when attacking, a 'Border Clash' battle occurs, which is the first to be resolved.|$|E
50|$|The chain {{was founded}} in Eugene, Oregon, United States, in 1959 by Ron Fraedrick, who opened the first {{restaurant}} near his alma mater, the University of Oregon, at 13th Avenue and High Street in January 1960. In 1962, the first Taco Time franchise opened in Tacoma, Washington. By {{the end of the}} decade, the company had 48 restaurants in seven Western states. In 1978, the company franchised its first international restaurant, in Lethbridge, Alberta. In 1979, Taco Time Northwest, became a licensee with the rights to franchise and operate the Taco <b>Time</b> <b>concept</b> independently. Taco Time Northwest's operating region includes Western Washington from Longview to the Canada-United States border and the eastern Washington cities of Wenatchee and Moses Lake. Taco Time has since expanded, now holding more than 300 franchises in the United States, Canada, Kuwait, and Curaçao/Netherlands Antilles. During the 1990s, there were also multiple locations in Greece.|$|E
5000|$|Before 1988 (see below) most events {{specified}} a [...] "bogey time" [...] {{for each}} competitive section, or [...] "selective", in the rallying jargon. This {{was a time}} set for the section, that, if achieved, would result in no time penalty being applied. Bogey times were usually calculated to be impossible, or just barely possible to achieve, and in doing so, would require speeds vastly {{in excess of the}} speed limit. The theory was that nobody would achieve these times, so in theory nobody would necessarily be breaking the law - and of course the organisers would be easily able to determine the running order of the finishers. The problem was that in practice cars had become so highly developed (and the bogey <b>time</b> <b>concept</b> gave them a strong incentive to do so) that bogey times were regularly being achieved, leading to shorter bogey times, and ever higher speeds.|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1991 This thesis {{offers a}} textual {{analysis}} of Emily Bronte's novel Wuthering Heights and, {{to a lesser}} extent, her poems {{in an effort to}} understand fully the complicated relationship of gender to time that characterizes her artistic imagination. The study emphasizes the interplay of religious, psychological and sexual forces inherent in her narrative, and their effect when portraying cyclical and linear <b>concepts</b> of <b>time.</b> Narrators' and characters' interactions serve by themselves and as dyads to represent a concept of mythical or eternal time that manifests itself within historical or chronological <b>time.</b> These <b>time</b> <b>concepts</b> differ and complement each other through aspects of wholeness and differentiation. References to Julia Kristeva's psycholinguistic theory and to C. G. Jung's archetypes give support for a unique space and female <b>concept</b> of <b>time</b> within a male discourse. Kristeva's exemplification of <b>time</b> <b>concepts</b> as linear/chronological for the male gender and cyclical/eternal for the female gender happens to be specially relevant to the 19 th century, when the patriarchal socio-symbolic order, inhibited, undermined, and/or circumscribed the participation of the feminine within the social contract...|$|R
