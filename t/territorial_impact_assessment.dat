40|$|<b>Territorial</b> <b>impact</b> <b>assessment</b> has {{recently}} gained attention {{as a tool}} to improve the coherence of sector policies with territorial cohesion objectives. The paper presents a method for <b>territorial</b> <b>impact</b> <b>assessment</b> and the results of applying this method on Slovenian energy policy. A two phase approach first disaggregates the problem into a three-dimensional matrix, consisting of policy measures, territorial objectives and territorial units. The synthesis phase aggregates measures and objectives in physical, economic or socio-cultural groups and observes their interrelation through an input-output matrix. The results have shown that such a two level approach is required to obtain complete and useful information for policy developers. In contrast to the relatively favourable evaluation of individual measures on the first level of assessment, the synthesis has revealed substantial and systemic weaknesses: considerable imbalance of energy policy favouring territorial effectiveness and mainly neglecting territorial identity as well as its counterproductiveness in reducing regional disparities. <b>Territorial</b> <b>impact</b> <b>assessment</b> Territorial cohesion Slovenia Energy policy...|$|E

40|$|Report Commissioned by the Ministry of VROM. Since {{the start}} of the making of the ESDP, back in 1989, there has been {{interest}} in a ‘Territorial impact assessment’. This interest has been revamped now that the Territorial Cohesion green paper is out. Yet, at the EU level there is still little guidance on how a TIA might be done and on what it actually is or could be. This report aims to ask and answer a set of fundamental questions {{that need to be addressed}} before engaging into developing an EU TIA instrument. We start with an historic overview discussing early initiatives and pleas to carry out <b>territorial</b> <b>impact</b> <b>assessment</b> at the European level. We continue by addressing the question what can understood under the heading of territorial impact. The next section focuses on <b>territorial</b> <b>impact</b> <b>assessment</b> in a multilevel context. Section 5 addresses the EU’s impact assessment procedure in detail.

40|$|There is {{no single}} or common {{definition}} or even understanding of <b>Territorial</b> <b>Impact</b> <b>Assessment</b> (TIA). Generally, the concept {{is described as a}} method based on a multi-criteria scenario and indicator approached analysis which will provide information about the territorial impact of a policy. The conceptual background of TIA is focused on Territorial Cohesion (TC), which, in turn, also lacks a single definition. TC has a strong connection to Services of General Interest (SGI) as these services are a crucial element of the Cohesion Policy. Key elements of TC are social, economic and territorial cohesion stressing a spatial coverage as well as fair and universal access of SGI regardless which region you live in. As the definition of SGI is wide and vague, a clear classification of these services is difficult to be set. In this sense, a structured theoretical framework regarding SGI was developed within the ESPON project SeGI - Indicators and perspectives for services of general interest in territorial cohesion and development. This paper is a spin-off of the ESPON SeGI project and aims at discussing the applicability of <b>territorial</b> <b>impact</b> <b>assessment</b> on services of general interest. The following four research questions are proposed to be answered: (1) how does TIA relate with SGI? (2) To what extend can TIA be applied for assessing SGI? (3) Should the territorial impact be differently assessed for different SGI? (4) Are there any external factors that make TIA difficult to use for assessing the territorial impact of SGI? Previous research and EU policy documents constitute the empirical material in this study. The analysis is focused on an ex ante evaluation of TIA and on the methodology of critical evaluation. The findings suggest a rather limited applicability as an undefined concept (TIA) is based on another undefined concept (TC) to measure the impact on a vaguely defined concept (SGI). Moreover, the particularities of each SGI may be related to economic and social changes that could be or not territorially reflected. So, using TIA for all services of general interest is difficult as various external factors interfere without having a territorial impact.

30|$|Despite these {{aspirations}} {{for the development}} of integrated approaches, the reality remains that urban intelligence at the local level is generally poorly developed in the critical areas of <b>territorial</b> <b>impact</b> <b>assessment</b> and urban planning. Agencies addressing the management of urban regions have a critical need to integrate large sets of data across the sectoral domains of land-use, transport, health, etc. in order to respond to the political demands for sustainable cities, but this is rarely achieved effectively. Furthermore, the complexities surrounding data integration to secure reliable intelligence increase further when the typical framework conditions for interagency collaboration on territorial planning issues requires intercity or intra-regional comparisons and assessments. Failure to secure policy integration can be attributed to a variety of factors including notably organisational and procedural barriers associated with the sectoral responsibilities for land-use, transport and environment, primarily in a horizontal perspective at the local level, and in a vertical perspective between government agencies responsible for policy development from local, to regional, national and EU levels.|$|E

40|$|Beyond {{a direct}} impact on land use (LU) patterns, European Commission (EC) {{policies}} often have substantial impacts on various domains. In order to uphold and improve the quality of legislation, a thorough ex-ante impact assessment of EC policies should therefore evaluate policy proposals on all three domains of sustainability: economy, environment and society (OECD 2010). However, straightforward impact assessment of EC policies is often not possible because various policy domains are inherently intertwined. For example, a trade policy can have {{a direct impact}} on the agricultural sector, and new transport infrastructures can influence economic growth, while both policies, together and individually, may affect land use. To make the impact assessment challenge even greater, various policies may either propagate or compensate impacts, thus causing non-linear interactions. Such complex dynamics can only be grasped by an elaborate impact assessment effort. In 2002 the EC introduced an Impact Assessment (IA) procedure to provide “evidence for political decision-makers on {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} possible policy options by assessing their potential impacts” (EC 2002). This procedure has to be applied to all Commission initiatives that aim to quantify economic, social and environmental impact.
