25|$|Marjorie Barnard met Flora Eldershaw, {{who was a}} {{year ahead}} of her, in her first year at the University of Sydney. Marjorie Barnard wrote of their first meeting as being ot entirely happy. I was the greenest of green 'freshers'. Flora was {{established}} in her second year. Chance had given me the locker immediately above hers. Its untidy contents frequently spilled out into her more ordered domain. My then meager person was continually underfoot, and Flora's brown eyes flashed with indignation more often than <b>they</b> <b>smiled.</b> But within the year we were close friends. She widened my horizons and quickened my mind. Later this friendship was to withstand what everyone agrees to be the acid test of collaboration in writing.|$|E
500|$|Georgene L. Troseth and {{her colleagues}} at Vanderbilt University studied how {{toddlers}} use information gained from prerecorded video and from interactions with a person through closed-circuit video, and found that two-year-olds do not learn as much from prerecorded videos because the videos lack social cues and personal references. Two-year-olds who viewed a pretaped video with instructions about {{how to find a}} toy in an adjoining room by a non-interactive researcher did not use the information, even though <b>they</b> <b>smiled</b> and responded to questions. Troseth speculated that their research had implications for interactive educational shows like Blue's Clues, which although was [...] "on the right track" [...] due {{to the way in which}} the host invites interaction with the show's viewers, did not provide children with the social cues to solve real-world problems. Troseth stated that repetition, repeated exposure, and familiarity with the show's host may increase children's ability to learn facts and to use strategies they learn from Blue's Clues to solve new problems. Her research suggested that Blue's Clues engaged young children and elicited their active participation because they mimicked social interaction. A longitudinal study published in 2005 found that early exposure to Blue's Clues to children between six and thirty months of age was positively linked with vocabulary and expressive language later learned.|$|E
