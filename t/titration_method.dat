50|$|A {{thermometric}} titration {{is one of}} {{a number}} of instrumental titration techniques where endpoints can be located accurately and precisely without a subjective interpretation on the part of the analyst as to their location. Enthalpy change is arguably the most fundamental and universal property of chemical reactions, so the observation of temperature change is a natural choice in monitoring their progress. It is not a new technique, with possibly the first recognizable thermometric <b>titration</b> <b>method</b> reported early in the 20th century (Bell and Cowell, 1913). In spite of its attractive features, and in spite of the considerable research that has been conducted in the field and a large body of applications that have been developed; it has been until now an under-utilized technique in the critical area of industrial process and quality control. Automated potentiometric titration systems have pre-dominated in this area since the 1970s. With the advent of cheap computers able to handle the powerful thermometric titration software, development has now reached the stage where easy to use automated thermometric titration systems can in many cases offer a superior alternative to potentiometric titrimetry.|$|E

40|$|The {{determination}} of ionic surfactants {{was carried out}} {{on the basis of}} ion association between ionic dyes and ionic surfactants in an aqueous medium. Three kinds of dyes (tetrabromophenolphthalein ethyl ester(TBPE), methyl orange analogues and nitrophenylazophenol analogues) were used as novel ion-association reagents. The ion-association constants between cationic surfactants (Q(+)) with dyes (D(-)) and anionic surfactants (A(-)) were obtained. It was found that the hydrophobic interaction {{plays an important role in}} the formation of stable ion associates. On the basis of the ion association accompanying a color change, the analytical methods for the {{determination of}} ionic surfactants, such as a batchwise spectrophotometric method, a flow-injection method and a photometric <b>titration</b> <b>method,</b> were developed in the presence of a small amount of nonionic surfactant in an aqueous medium.
