5|$|Between {{the large}} pendentives {{that support the}} vault are windows, six {{on each side of}} the chapel. There were two more windows in each end of the chapel, now closed, and those above the High Altar covered by the Last Judgement. Above each window is an arched shape, {{referred}} to as a lunette and above eight of the lunettes at the sides of the chapel are triangular spandrels filling <b>the</b> <b>spaces</b> <b>between</b> the side pendentives and the vault, the other eight lunettes each being below one of the corner pendentives.|$|E
5|$|The Moon is in {{synchronous}} rotation with Earth, always {{showing the}} same face, with its near side marked by dark volcanic maria that fill <b>the</b> <b>spaces</b> <b>between</b> the bright ancient crustal highlands and the prominent impact craters. As {{seen from the}} Earth, it is the second-brightest regularly visible celestial object in Earth's sky, after the Sun. Its surface is actually dark, although compared to the night sky it appears very bright, with a reflectance just slightly {{higher than that of}} worn asphalt. Its gravitational influence produces the ocean tides, body tides, and the slight lengthening of the day.|$|E
5|$|The {{house is}} built with stone foundations, {{and the main}} {{structure}} is made of oak timbers, joined together using mortice and tenon joints, and held in place with oak pegs.

The black and white appearance from the timber framing construction dates from the Tudor period, though some parts have been repaired in later years.|$|E

5000|$|Word spacing in {{typography}} {{refers to}} the size of <b>the</b> <b>space</b> <b>between</b> words. It should be distinguished from letter-spacing (<b>the</b> <b>spacing</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> letters within each word) and sentence <b>spacing</b> (<b>the</b> <b>spacing</b> <b>between</b> sentences). Typographers may modify <b>the</b> <b>spacing</b> of letters or words in a body of type to aid readability and copy fit, or for aesthetic effect. In web browsers and standardized digital typography <b>the</b> word <b>spacing</b> is controlled by the CSS1 word-spacing property.|$|R

5|$|Most {{bacteria}} {{enter the}} lungs via small aspirations of organisms {{residing in the}} throat or nose. Half of normal people have these small aspirations during sleep. While the throat always contains bacteria, potentially infectious ones reside there only at certain times and under certain conditions. A minority of types of bacteria such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Legionella pneumophila reach the lungs via contaminated airborne droplets. Bacteria can spread also via the blood. Once in the lungs, bacteria may invade <b>the</b> <b>spaces</b> <b>between</b> cells and between alveoli, where the macrophages and neutrophils (defensive white blood cells) attempt to inactivate the bacteria. The neutrophils also release cytokines, causing a general activation of the immune system. This leads to the fever, chills, and fatigue common in bacterial pneumonia. The neutrophils, bacteria, and fluid from surrounding blood vessels fill the alveoli, resulting in the consolidation seen on chest X-ray.|$|E
5|$|The new Ibrox had a {{capacity}} of 44,000 and was opened with an Old Firm game played on 19 September 1981. By this time, however, the development cost had risen to £10 million, which depleted the club financially. This resulted in a difficult period {{in the history of}} Rangers, as the average attendance fell to 17,500 in the 1981–82 season, including a crowd of only 4,500 for a game against St Mirren. The redeveloped stadium was partly blamed for this, as some fans felt that the new ground lacked atmosphere due to <b>the</b> <b>spaces</b> <b>between</b> the stands. This was during a period of low attendances in Scottish football in general. Despite the relatively low attendance at Ibrox, Rangers had the highest average home attendances in the Premier Division in both 1983–84 and 1984–85.|$|E
5|$|The plumage of {{the house}} sparrow is mostly {{different}} shades of grey and brown. The sexes exhibit strong dimorphism: the female is mostly buffish above and below, while the male has boldly coloured head markings, a reddish back, and grey underparts. The male has a dark grey crown {{from the top of}} its bill to its back, and chestnut brown flanking its crown on the sides of its head. It has black around its bill, on its throat, and on <b>the</b> <b>spaces</b> <b>between</b> its bill and eyes (lores). It has a small white stripe between the lores and crown and small white spots immediately behind the eyes (postoculars), with black patches below and above them. The underparts are pale grey or white, as are the cheeks, ear coverts, and stripes {{at the base of the}} head. The upper back and mantle are a warm brown, with broad black streaks, while the lower back, rump and uppertail coverts are greyish brown.|$|E
50|$|There {{are four}} or five {{accepted}} and cognate meanings of spandrel in architectural and art history, mostly relating to <b>the</b> <b>space</b> <b>between</b> a curved figure and a rectangular boundary - such as <b>the</b> <b>space</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> curve of an arch and a rectilinear bounding moulding, or the wallspace bounded by adjacent arches in an arcade and the stringcourse or moulding above them, or <b>the</b> <b>space</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> central medallion of a carpet and its rectangular corners, or <b>the</b> <b>space</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> circular face of a clock and {{the corners of the}} square revealed by its hood.

5|$|Through his {{magazines}} and books, Robinson challenged many gardening traditions and introduced new ideas {{that have become}} commonplace today. He is most linked with introducing the herbaceous border, which he referred to by the older name of 'mixed border'—it included a mixture of shrubs, hardy and half-hardy herbaceous plants. He also advocated dense plantings that left no bare soil, with <b>the</b> <b>spaces</b> <b>between</b> taller plants filled with what are now commonly called ground cover plants. Even his rose garden at Gravetye was filled with saxifrage between and under the roses. Following {{a visit to the}} Alps, Robinson wrote Alpine Flowers for Gardens, which for the first time showed how to use alpine plants in a designed rock garden.|$|E
5|$|As in {{the rest}} of Italy, the finest and most {{decorated}} rooms were those on the piano nobile, reserved for guests and entertaining. Entered formally from the external Baroque double staircase, these rooms consisted of a suite of large and small salons, with one very large salon being the principal room of the house, often used as a ballroom. Sometimes the guest bedrooms were sited here too, {{but by the end of}} the 18th century they were more often on a secondary floor above. If decorated during the Baroque era, the rooms would be profusely ornamented. Walls were frequently mirrored, the mirrors inset into gilded frames in the walls, often alternating with paintings similarly framed, while moulded nymphs and shepherdesses decorated <b>the</b> <b>spaces</b> <b>between.</b> Ceilings were high and frescoed, and from the ceiling hung huge coloured chandeliers of Murano glass, while further light came from gilded sconces flanking the mirrors adorning the walls. One of the most notable rooms in this style is the Gallery of Mirrors in Palermo's Palazzo Valguarnera-Gangi (Illustration 17). This room with its frescoed ceiling by Gaspare Fumagalli is, however, one of the few Baroque rooms in this Baroque palazzo, which was (from 1750) extended and transformed by its owner Marianna Valguarnera, mostly in the later neoclassical style.|$|E
5|$|In general, A.subrubescens can be {{distinguished}} from other Albatrellus species by its white cap that becomes orange when bruised, its simple-septate hyphae, small amyloid spores, and habitat under pines. In the field, Albatrellus ovinus is difficult to differentiate from A.subrubescens due to its similar appearance. A.ovinus usually lacks the violet color often seen in the cap and stem of A.subrubescens. Microscopic characteristics {{can be used to}} reliably distinguish the two species: the spores of A.subrubescens are amyloid, in contrast to those of A.ovinus, and A.ovinus spores are smaller, typically 3.8–4.6 by 3.3–3.5µm. Other similar species include A.tianschanicus, described from the Altai Mountains in East-Central Asia, and the Japanese species A.cantharellus. Unlike A.subrubescens, these species have hairy scales on the surface of their caps, and the scales are darker than <b>the</b> <b>spaces</b> <b>between</b> the scales. Also, the scales of A.subrubescens are not much darker than the area between the scales. Both of these Asian species have larger spores than A.subrubescens: those of A.cantharellus are 4.5–7 by 4–5.5µm, while those of A.tianschanicus are 5–7 by 4–5µm.|$|E
50|$|Typography {{includes}} type design, modifying type glyphs {{and arranging}} type. Type glyphs (characters) are created and modified using illustration techniques. Type arrangement is {{the selection of}} typefaces, point size, tracking (<b>the</b> <b>space</b> <b>between</b> all characters used), kerning (<b>the</b> <b>space</b> <b>between</b> two specific characters) and leading (line spacing).|$|R

5|$|All puzzles {{are based}} on a {{mechanic}} of tracing a path through a maze-like route from a starting point, represented as a circle, to a goal point, represented as a line segment with a rounded end, without crossing one's path. The goal of these puzzles is not always to simply complete the maze but to find the right path that completes the puzzle correctly. Mazes may have several starting points and goals; the player may have to find the right starting point that can complete the maze, or they may {{have to figure out how}} to reach a specific end point to trigger an event in the surrounding environment such as moving a platform. The puzzles include a symbolic language that denotes the mechanics for that maze. For example, puzzles that present mazes with black and white squares in <b>the</b> <b>spaces</b> <b>between</b> traceable paths require the player to find a path through the maze that separates these squares by color. Other puzzles require the player to use the environment to determine how to solve the puzzle, such as studying a nearby tree with branches that mimic the puzzle, or by observing symbols on nearby floors and walls that align with the puzzle's configuration. The puzzles within each island section {{are based on}} common mechanic, often with a sequence of puzzles appearing early in each section that are designed to help the player identify and understand the mechanic and meaning of the symbols. Later puzzles combine two or more different mechanics into the same puzzle using the consistent symbolic language.|$|E
5|$|Structure A-3 is {{a temple}} {{platform}} {{located in the}} centre of the south plaza. It has a stairway ascending each of its four sides. Five stelae are associated with this structure, one located at the base of each stairway and a fifth inside the building surmounting the platform. Three large jade cobbles were interred under the central stela. This structure and its associated stelae were dedicated in AD 849 by king Wat'ul Chatel (also known as Aj B'olon Haab'tal). StructureA-3 has the remains of a corbeled vault, the only surviving example at Seibal. The arrangement of the radial pyramid with its associated stelae was highly innovative. The radial temple form was ancient in the Maya region, dating back to the Late Preclassic, but Wat'ul Chatel placed upon it a square shrine with four doors, one opening onto each of the stairways. The temple building contained three vaulted chambers oriented north-south, with doors joining each chamber along an east-west axis. The cornice of the temple supported a brightly coloured stucco frieze. The frieze collapsed with the temple in ancient times. Archaeologists were able to recover portions of the fallen frieze and attempt a reconstruction of how it originally appeared. Each of the four doors was originally topped by a larger-than-life sculpture of king Wat'ul Chatel. Twelve smaller figures were spaced around the cornice, one at each corner with an additional figure positioned half-way between each corner and the central figure of the king. It is not known who these smaller figures represented. <b>The</b> <b>spaces</b> <b>between</b> the figures were occupied by panels with cross-hatch designs and sculpted vegetation and animals. Old gods sat in the centre of each of the sixteen panels, including Itzamna and Pawatun. StructureA-3 was built over an earlier platform structure.|$|E
