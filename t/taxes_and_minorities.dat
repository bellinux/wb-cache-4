40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{coordination and}} profit allocation in a profit-center organization using a single transfer price. The model includes compensations, <b>taxes,</b> <b>and</b> <b>minority</b> interests of two divisions deciding on capacity and sales. The analysis covers arm’s length transfer prices which are either administered by central management or negotiated by the divisions. Administered transfer prices refer to past transactions and therefore maximize firm-wide profit net of divisional compensations, <b>taxes,</b> <b>and</b> <b>minority</b> profit shares only for given decentralized decisions. From an ex-ante perspective, it is shown that {{adverse effects on}} coordination may result in inefficient divisional profits of which all stakeholders suffer. We motivate a positive effect of advance pricing agreements, intra-firm guidelines, and restrictive treatments {{of changes in the}} firm’s accounting policy. By contrast, negotiations ignore compensations, <b>taxes,</b> <b>and</b> <b>minority</b> shares but yield efficient divisional profits. Negotiations seem compelling as they perfectly reflect the arm’s length principle. Moreover, common practices such as arbitration or one-step pricing schemes allow the firm to engage in manipulation {{at the expense of other}} stakeholders...|$|R

At a glance Chapter 2 provides an overview of the <b>tax</b> <b>and</b> transfer system in Australia, and develops a conceptual framework for examining income redistribution via the <b>tax</b> <b>and</b> transfer system. Chapter 3 looks at the existing state of evidence on the incidence of <b>taxes</b> <b>and</b> transfers on both annual and life cycle bases.

40|$|In {{the world}} today there is a {{tendency}} that women <b>and</b> <b>minority</b> groups are under-represented in political decision-making. In order {{to come to terms with}} the under-representation of women <b>and</b> <b>minorities</b> many countries are taking measures to increase the number of women <b>and</b> <b>minority</b> representatives. However,there is an ongoing debate on whether increased number of group representatives lead to increased representation of group interests. The question is if women <b>and</b> <b>minority</b> representatives are more responsive to their respective group’s interests compared to other representatives. In this study, I have conducted asurvey with members of the Jordanian House of Representatives in order to investigate whether women <b>and</b> <b>minority</b> representatives are more responsive to their respective group’s interests compared to other representatives. The survey has been designed to capture representatives’ priorities and attitudes towards certain policy areas and issues. The results from the survey show that women <b>and</b> <b>minority</b> representatives to a certain extent are more responsive to their respective group’s interests compared to other representatives, indicating that an increased number of women <b>and</b> <b>minority</b> representatives would lead to increased representation of women <b>and</b> <b>minority</b> interests. Furthermore,this study finds that female representatives are more responsive to women’s interests when it comes to priorities than when it comes to attitudes, whereas representatives from the Christian minority are more responsive to Christian issues when it comes to attitudes than when it comes to priorities. These results indicate that there are differences between different groups when it comes to the representation of their groups’ interests. Thus, research on one group might not be directly transferable to other groups...|$|R

Income is variable <b>and</b> the <b>tax</b> <b>and</b> {{transfer system}} is nonlinear-i. e., marginal tax rates vary. We show that, as a consequence, the <b>tax</b> <b>and</b> transfer system punishes (and rewards) income variability. We calculate {{the effect of}} the nonlinearity for several components of the U.

We conclude that the <b>tax</b> <b>and</b> transfer system punishes and rewards variability {{in a manner that is}} both substantial and capricious. ...|$|R

They involve numeric size, power/status, and counternormative position, but size is most commonly used in experimental research to manipulate minority/minority status. Does this practice mirror real-world conceptualizations? To address this question, 77 participants were asked to describe majority <b>and</b> <b>minority</b> groups using a structured openended measure. Content analysis of their responses revealed that majority <b>and</b> <b>minority</b> groups were conceptualized along eight dimensions, which included power, number, distinctiveness, social category, group context, dispositions, and being the source or target of behavior. Although these dimensions were relevant to both majorities <b>and</b> <b>minorities,</b> they often were applied differentially. Also, minorities were associated with more divergent thinking and viewed more negatively than were majorities. On the basis of these findings, a new typology of groups was proposed that could be used in future experimental research to advance our understanding of majorities <b>and</b> <b>minorities...</b>|$|R
