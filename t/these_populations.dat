5|$|Population ecology {{studies the}} {{dynamics}} of species populations and how <b>these</b> <b>populations</b> interact with the wider environment. A population consists of individuals {{of the same species}} that live, interact, and migrate through the same niche and habitat.|$|E
5|$|There are 27 known populations {{within this}} region, but only nine of <b>these</b> <b>populations</b> contain more than 10 {{individual}} plants, and only five populations {{have more than}} 100. Ten populations are now presumed extinct. The total number of plants is estimated at around 1000.|$|E
5|$|If genetic {{differentiation}} between populations develops, gene flow between populations can introduce traits or alleles which are disadvantageous {{in the local}} population and this may lead to organisms within <b>these</b> <b>populations</b> evolving mechanisms that prevent mating with genetically distant populations, eventually resulting in the appearance of new species. Thus, exchange of genetic information between individuals is fundamentally important {{for the development of}} the biological species concept.|$|E

5|$|Studies have {{demonstrated}} that geographically separated R.brevipes populations (globally and continentally) develop significant genetic differentiation, suggesting that gene flow between <b>these</b> <b>populations</b> is small. In contrast, there was little genetic differentiation observed between populations sampled from a smaller area (less than approximately 1000meters). R.brevipes {{is one of several}} Russula species that associates with the myco-heterotrophic orchid Limodorum abortivum.|$|E
5|$|The {{distinct}} {{populations of}} loggerheads have unique characteristics and genetic differences. For example, Mediterranean loggerheads are smaller, on average, than Atlantic Ocean loggerheads. North Atlantic and Mediterranean loggerhead sea turtles are descendants of colonizing loggerheads from Tongaland, South Africa. South African loggerhead genes are still present in <b>these</b> <b>populations</b> today.|$|E
5|$|The sterile diploid {{hybrid of}} A.montanum and A.platyneuron, which resembles A.bradleyi except for its {{abortive}} spores and smaller sori, was not collected until 1972, at Crowder's Mountain, Georgia. Even though the diploid hybrid is rarely collected, allozyme {{studies show that}} A.bradleyi has multiple origins; that is, different populations of A.bradleyi have originated from the chromosome doubling of independently formed diploids. Despite their independent origins, <b>these</b> <b>populations</b> are probably interfertile and not reproductively isolated from one another.|$|E

5|$|Before {{the early}} 17th century, the western Petén had been heavily {{populated}} by Ch'ol and Ch'olti' Maya {{and was an}} important trade route for the Itza. By the mid-17th century, <b>these</b> <b>populations</b> had been devastated by war, disease and the enforced movement of the inhabitants into colonial settlements, negating the economic importance of the region for the Itza. At {{the same time the}} Kejache were becoming important intermediaries between the Itza and Yucatán. The Putun Acalan subgroup of the Kejache had previously traded directly with the Itza but had been relocated by the Spanish. The remaining Kejache, devastated by disease and subject to the intense attentions of Spanish missionaries, were no longer able to supply the Itza directly and became middlemen instead.|$|E
5|$|For Asian stocks, {{resident}} {{groups may}} {{exist in the}} Yellow Sea and East China Sea, and the Sea of Japan (though <b>these</b> <b>populations</b> are critically endangered and the population off China, Korea, and Japan are either near extinction or in very small numbers). Very small increases in sightings have been confirmed off Shiretoko Peninsula, Abashiri, and Kushiro in Hokkaido, Tsushima, Sado Island, off Maiduru in the Sea of Japan since in late 2000s as whales in Sea of Okhotsk might have started recolonizing into former habitats (for coastal Sakhalin, as well). Whales possibly used to migrated into Seto Inland Sea.|$|E
5|$|Many {{facets of}} the {{interaction}} between sea otters and the human economy are not as immediately felt. Sea otters have been credited with contributing to the kelp harvesting industry via their well-known role in controlling sea urchin populations; kelp is used in the production of diverse food and pharmaceutical products. Although human divers harvest red sea urchins both for food and to protect the kelp, sea otters hunt more sea urchin species and are more consistently effective in controlling <b>these</b> <b>populations.</b> The health of the kelp forest ecosystem is significant in nurturing populations of fish, including commercially important fish species. In some areas, sea otters are popular tourist attractions, bringing visitors to local hotels, restaurants, and sea otter-watching expeditions.|$|E

5|$|Modern whaling {{was more}} {{efficient}} than open-boat whaling, employing steam-powered ships and exploding harpoons. Initially, modern whaling activity focused on large baleen whales, but as <b>these</b> <b>populations</b> were taken, sperm whaling increased. Spermaceti, the fine waxy oil produced by sperm whales, was in high demand. In both the 1941 to 1942 and 1942 to 1943 seasons, Norwegian expeditions took over 3,000 sperm whales {{off the coast of}} Peru alone. After World War II, whaling continued unabated to obtain oil for cosmetics and high-performance machinery, such as automobile transmissions.|$|E
5|$|Oryzomys populations from Texas to Nicaragua form {{a single}} Cytb clade, {{within which the}} average {{sequence}} divergence is 1.28%, and Hanson and colleagues proposed that the name Oryzomys couesi be restricted to this clade. <b>These</b> <b>populations</b> correspond to two subspecies recognized by Goldman (O.c.aquaticus and O.c.couesi) and an island form he retained as a species (O.cozumelae). Two other subspecies Goldman recognized, O.c.richmondi and O.c.peragrus, and a third, O.c.pinicola, that was described after Goldman's paper occur in the same region, but have not been studied genetically.|$|E
5|$|Studies {{have shown}} that smaller-sized P. rebeli from Hungary {{normally}} eclose {{at the end of}} June or mid-July; however, when <b>these</b> <b>populations</b> are studied in laboratories, they do not eclose until late August. This has led researchers to speculate that P. rebeli larvae that do not receive adequate food can still fully develop in one year and act as a functioning adult. However, they are unlikely to be bivoltine (producing two broods in one season). This hypothesis is supported by the fact that certain researchers claim that P. rebeli larvae can have continuous development.|$|E
30|$|Moreover, we {{enrolled}} a mixed {{population of}} neurological and non-neurological ICU patients.

5|$|The IUCN {{currently}} recognizes {{only one}} species of giraffe with nine subspecies. In 2001, a two-species taxonomy was proposed. A 2007 {{study on the}} genetics of Giraffa, suggested they were six species: the West African, Rothschild's, reticulated, Masai, Angolan, and South African giraffe. The study deduced from genetic differences in nuclear and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) that giraffes from <b>these</b> <b>populations</b> are reproductively isolated and rarely interbreed, though no natural obstacles block their mutual access. This includes adjacent populations of Rothschild's, reticulated, and Masai giraffes. The Masai giraffe was also suggested to consist of possibly two species separated by the Rift Valley.|$|E
5|$|The IUCN {{states that}} about half of the {{estimated}} total population lives in protected areas and 30% on private land. Protected areas that support major populations include Omo (Ethiopia), Serengeti, Katavi, Ruaha and Selous-Kilombero (Tanzania), Kafue and North Luangwa (Zambia), Nyika (Malawi), Etosha (Namibia), Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park (Botswana/South Africa) and Ukhahlamba Drakensberg Park (South Africa). Most of <b>these</b> <b>populations</b> appear to be stable. Relatively large numbers of common eland now live on private land, particularly in Namibia, Zimbabwe and South Africa, reflecting its value as a trophy animal. Common elands have also been widely domesticated in Zimbabwe, South Africa and Kenya, as well as in Russia and Ukraine.|$|E
5|$|The third {{biological}} control agent to target Neoscapteriscus in Florida was the South American nematode Steinernema scapterisci. Small-scale releases proved it could persist for years in mole-cricket-infested sandy Florida soils. Its use as a biopesticide against Neoscapteriscus was patented, making it attractive to industry. Industrial-scale production on artificial diet allowed large-scale trial applications in pastures and on golf courses, which succeeded in establishing populations in several counties, and <b>these</b> <b>populations</b> spread, but sales were disappointing, and the product was withdrawn from the market in 2014.|$|E
5000|$|By 2013 {{there were}} four camps in Maban County, South Sudan, hosting {{refugees}} and internally displaced people. Yusuf Batil camp was home to 37,000 refugees, Doro camp to 44,000, Jamam camp to 20,000 and Gendrassa camp 10,000. <b>These</b> <b>population</b> numbers are subject to fluctuation during the ongoing violence in the country.|$|R
5000|$|Many natural populations undergo multi-year {{cycles of}} abundance. In some cases <b>these</b> <b>population</b> cycles are {{spatially}} organised into a periodic travelling wave. This behaviour {{has been found}} in voles in Fennoscandia and Northern UK, geometrid moths in Northern Fennoscandia, larch budmoths in the European Alps and red grouse in Scotland.|$|R
50|$|Both <b>these</b> <b>population</b> {{statistics}} reflect {{population growth}} across England and Wales. Comparing this to Dundraw, {{it can be}} seen that the smaller population of the village has fluctuated a lot more than the rest of the country. In the district of Allerdale there is a total estimated population of 94,000 (as of mid-2010).|$|R
5|$|The three coves to {{the east}} of Helvellyn are all {{important}} sites for remnant populations of arctic-alpine plants. Species such as downy willow (Salix lapponum), mountain avens (Dryas octopetala), alpine mouse-ear (Cerastium alpinum), alpine meadowgrass (Poa alpina) and others have been able to survive in these coves since the last glaciation through a combination of rocks rich in basic minerals, a harsh micro-climate, and inaccessibility to grazing sheep on cliff ledges. However, <b>these</b> <b>populations</b> are small and are not reproducing well. Natural England has introduced a recovery plan for them.|$|E
5|$|Fossil {{evidence}} of the tammar wallaby exists from the late Pleistocene era—remains {{were found in the}} Naracoorte Caves. The mainland and island dwelling tammars split from each other 7,000–15,000 years ago, while the South Australian and Western Australian animals diverged around 50,000 years ago. The tammar wallabies on Flinders Island had greyer coats and thinner heads than the Kangaroo Island tammars, which are larger than the East and West Wallabi Islands animals. The island tammars were once thought to be a separate species from the mainland population. A 1991 examination of tammar skulls from different parts of the species' range found that populations can be divided into three distinct groups; one group made of populations from mainland Western Australia, East and West Wallabi Islands, Garden Island and Middle Island; a second group comprising populations from Flinders Island, 19th century mainland Southern Australia and New Zealand; and a third group consisting solely of the Kangaroo Island population. The Western Australia Department of Environment and Conservation listed <b>these</b> <b>populations</b> as subspecies; M. e. derbianus, M. e. eugenii and M. e. decres respectively.|$|E
5|$|Genetic {{analysis}} of Sumatran rhino populations has identified three distinct genetic lineages. The channel between Sumatra and Malaysia {{was not as}} significant a barrier for the rhinos as the Barisan Mountains {{along the length of}} Sumatra, for rhinos in eastern Sumatra and Peninsular Malaysia are more closely related than the rhinos {{on the other side of}} the mountains in western Sumatra. In fact, the eastern Sumatra and Malaysia rhinos show so little genetic variance, the populations were likely not separate during the Pleistocene, when sea levels were much lower and Sumatra formed part of the mainland. Both populations of Sumatra and Malaysia, however, are close enough genetically that interbreeding would not be problematic. The rhinos of Borneo are sufficiently distinct that conservation geneticists have advised against crossing their lineages with the other populations. Conservation geneticists have recently begun to study the diversity of the gene pool within <b>these</b> <b>populations</b> by identifying microsatellite loci. The results of initial testing found levels of variability within Sumatran rhino populations comparable to those in the population of the less endangered African rhinos, but the genetic diversity of Sumatran rhinos is an area of continuing study.|$|E
