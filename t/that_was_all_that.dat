5|$|Limited {{computer}} power: There was {{not enough}} memory or processing speed to accomplish anything truly useful. For example, Ross Quillian's successful work on natural language was demonstrated with a vocabulary of only twenty words, because <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> would fit in memory. Hans Moravec argued in 1976 that computers were still millions of times too weak to exhibit intelligence. He suggested an analogy: artificial intelligence requires computer power {{in the same way}} that aircraft require horsepower. Below a certain threshold, it's impossible, but, as power increases, eventually it could become easy. With regard to computer vision, Moravec estimated that simply matching the edge and motion detection capabilities of human retina in real time would require a general-purpose computer capable of 109 operations/second (1000 MIPS). As of 2011, practical computer vision applications require 10,000 to 1,000,000 MIPS. By comparison, the fastest supercomputer in 1976, Cray-1 (retailing at $5 million to $8 million), was only capable of around 80 to 130 MIPS, and a typical desktop computer at the time achieved less than 1 MIPS.|$|E

25|$|We are now {{left with}} two sons from Antonio's first {{marriage}} {{who worked in}} the family shop: Omobono and Franceso. As Omobono had left the dwelling aged eighteen in search of new employment possibilities in Naples, he left Antonio to pay for much of his living expenses. In this sense, his father had never really forgiven him for leaving home. Just as Paolo, he would inherit six violins. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> was written on the will for him. As For Francesco, who was named his father's successor, he would inherit the rest of his father's belongings, the rest of the estate. This included all of the wood tools, stencils, finished violins, patterns, not to mention, his father's reputation.|$|E

25|$|Treaties {{obtained}} from local chiefs in Africa were not aimed at having them accept their subjugation − superior force did that (just {{as it had}} for the chiefs themselves, earlier) − but were solely to impress on rival colonial powers {{that they had the}} means to convince their own populations of the justice of any military action they might have to take to defend their claim to civilize the area, and <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> mattered. The idea of democracy was spreading in Europe all throughout the nineteenth century, and, increasingly, governments were required to take account of public opinion. Public opinion in Europe could be a powerful motivator of colonial actions, as the Fashoda Incident a few years later demonstrated.|$|E
2500|$|Japan's {{military}} leaders discovered {{the value of}} aircraft while participating in World War I. It was necessary to import all of its military aircraft and engines as there was no aviation manufacturing industry in Japan at that time. [...] The Imperial Japanese {{did not want to}} rely on foreign products, yet <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> was available. [...] To remedy this, Japan began importing state-of-the-art aircraft from around the world, and after close examination and study they incorporated the best features of each into their own design, thereby creating a uniquely superior Japanese designed and built product.|$|E

Stressing that Blanton should not be judged for his beliefs, Robbins again vehemently criticized the validity and poor quality of the audio recordings presented, and the selectivity of the sections which had been introduced into evidence. Robbins also discredited the testimony of FBI agent William Fleming, who had earlier testified as to a government witness claiming he had seen Blanton {{in the vicinity of}} the church shortly before the bombing.|$|E
