5|$|The video {{opens with}} shots of a dank {{underground}} sewer. Stevens {{and a group}} of women walk through the sewer and put on sunglasses before climbing out of manholes and shafts. A large crowd of women, with Stevens leading them, parades down <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>as</b> men observe the spectacle. The women begin spraying each other with bottles of water, before Stevens returns to the sewer. Throughout the video, sequences of Stevens {{and a group of}} backup dancers performing in the sewer are shown.|$|E
5|$|A {{detachment}} of 18 {{men of the}} 1st The Royal Dragoons, commanded by Captain Methuen, arrived in Ely from Bury on 23 May in the late afternoon. They marched through <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>as</b> a show of force, remaining all night. The following afternoon, 24 May, the troops marched on Littleport, led by Sir Henry Bate Dudley and John Bacon, a Bow Street constable. They were followed by the Royston troop of volunteer yeomanry cavalry summoned earlier by Henry Law, and a militia of gentlemen and inhabitants of Ely.|$|E

5|$|Large crowds {{started to}} gather {{early in the}} day {{including}} many people who had travelled to Bristol to see the spectacle. There was a general atmosphere of anticipation as the Royal Emblem was unfurled. The processional route had been cleaned and Temple Street decorated with flags, banners, flowers and ribbons. Boys of the City School and girls of Red Maids were stationed in a neat orderly formation down {{the entire length of the}} Exchange. The route was a mass of colour and everybody was out on <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>as</b> it was a public holiday. The atmosphere of gaiety even allowed thoughts to drift away from the problems of political dissension in London.|$|E
5|$|The loop was {{originally}} proposed in 1986 {{as part of}} a downtown revitalization effort. Almost from the beginning before the highway was commissioned in 1989, it was affected by controversial proposals. The first was related to suggestions by community leaders to rename city streets in honor of Martin Luther King, Jr. Another controversy dealt with rebuilding <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>as</b> part of a downtown beautification project; the downtown business community protested the original scope of construction, and the Lansing City Council threatened to cancel the project in response to the controversy. In 2010, additional controversies surfaced regarding the posting and enforcement of speed limits on city streets in Michigan, including the streets that make up the Capitol Loop.|$|E
5|$|A new student, Hilary van Doren, {{joins the}} school's Dance {{department}} and seduces Leroy. Bruno and Mr. Shorofsky debate {{the merits of}} traditional orchestras versus synthesized instruments. Bruno's father plays his music (the title song) outside the school, inspiring the student body to dance in <b>the</b> <b>streets.</b> <b>As</b> an acting exercise, the {{students are asked to}} divulge a painful memory. Montgomery discusses discovering his homosexuality, while coming out in front of his classmates; Doris relates her humiliation at being forced by her stage mother to sing at a child's birthday party; and Ralph tells of learning about the death of his idol Freddie Prinze. Miss Berg drops Lisa from the Dance program, and after seemingly considering suicide in a New York City Subway station, Lisa drops her dance clothes on the subway tracks and decides to join the Drama department.|$|E

50|$|In {{the early}} 1920s this {{reconfiguration}} of American city transport infrastructure around the automobile, at the instigation of traffic engineers, {{resulted in the}} rewriting of an old English common law (which had previously defined <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>as</b> a space where all users were equal) to define <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>as</b> a space which privileges cars, allocating them {{the right of way}} (except at intersections).|$|R

5|$|There {{was little}} warning in New Richmond. The tornado was {{completely}} illuminated by lightning, {{but it was}} visible {{for only a few}} minutes before it reached the town, as the view was largely obstructed by buildings and large trees. Initially, several of the town's residents recalled hearing a faint rumble in the distance which many mistook for the sound of a passing train. Before long the tornado became more visible, and those who did come to realize the danger approaching began to alert those around them, and panic ensued in <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>as</b> people scrambled to take shelter. Despite the best efforts of the storm's early spotters, a great many of the town's residents were not fully aware of the oncoming storm until it was almost upon them. Shortly after 6 PM, the tornado tore into the southwest corner of the city. This neighborhood was where many of the town's wealthiest and most influential residents lived, many of them having first come to the area as pioneers from New England in the 1850s. They included the owners of some of New Richmond's most prominent businesses, residing in stately homes built in styles derived from those seen back east. Within a few moments, as many as fifty homes were leveled in this area.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} mainly shot on Kodak Vision3 250D film stock. Scenes where Oscar is alive were {{shot in the}} super 35 format with Arricam LT cameras, and the rest in super 16 with an Aaton XTR Prod. The cinematographer was Benoît Debie, who also shot Irréversible. As in Irréversible, Noé was {{reluctant}} to use artificial lighting that would destroy the illusion if the camera was turned around. Thanks to Tokyo's many neon signs, very little additional lighting was required for the exterior scenes, {{despite the fact that}} many were shot late at night. For the interior scenes Debie mainly used practical, in-frame light sources. Some exceptions were made. One was that the moods of the characters were meant to be indicated by different colours, ranging from orange to purple with occasional greens. For this, Debie used a set of red, green, and blue programmable disco lights, which allowed for all different hues. The disco lights were easy to hide. They were also used for simulation of neon flashes, and to add a tint of red to the dressing-room scenes. Another exception was the use of strobe lights, which were programmed together with the coloured lights. Blue colour was avoided throughout, since the filmmakers did not associate it with dreams. Noé was the film's camera operator, except for a few shots of Oscar running in <b>the</b> <b>streets,</b> <b>as</b> they required a taller cameraman. In those scenes, the camera was held by Debie.|$|E
25|$|Channel 4 News {{also had}} similar maps that {{progressively}} tracked the damage in <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>as</b> well. News channels also {{were able to}} utilise this public service to capture live footage {{on the streets and}} inform citizens of dangerous or crowded areas.|$|E

Hundreds of people panicked and ran through <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>as</b> the earthquake struck, with eyewitnesses stating that most people were crying and screaming as their memories of the massive earthquake in 2004 were triggered. Many stated that the shaking {{was similar to the}} 2004 quake. Hundreds of people evacuated to higher ground, fearing that a tsunami would occur.|$|E
25|$|Huddersfield Festival of Light {{takes place}} {{annually}} in December, {{usually in the}} town centre adjacent to the railway station. Each year there is a performance by a theatre company. The finale is a firework display. The 2007 show was performed by French company Plasticiens Volants, which used large inflatable sea creatures in a parade through <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>as</b> they {{told the story of}} 'Pearl'. The 2005 and 2008 performances were by the Valencian artists Xarxa Teatre.|$|E
25|$|Shoaib Malik first played tape-ball cricket in <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>as</b> a child.

25|$|Initially, {{investigators}} believed, if Donati {{had planned}} the Gardner theft {{it was to}} settle a gambling debt owed by a former security guard at the museum, who told him how lax the security was. Kurkjian offered another explanation for why Donati robbed the museum: he felt unsafe on <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>as</b> long as Ferrara remained in custody, and hoped to use the art to bargain for his freedom, as Connor had done to reduce his sentence by arranging {{for the return of}} the BMFA's Rembrandt 15 years earlier.|$|E
25|$|Schmeichel {{is the son}} {{of former}} Denmark {{international}} goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel.

He attended Hulme Hall Grammar School in Cheadle Hulme, Stockport, Greater Manchester and he also attended Saint Julian's School in Portugal while his father played for Sporting CP in Lisbon. When Alex Bruce, son of Kasper's father's former Manchester United teammate Steve Bruce, joined Kasper at Leeds United, the move saw the two players re-unite after both had previously played football together on <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>as</b> children after school.|$|E
