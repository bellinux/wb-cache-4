5|$|The {{hijacking}} {{occurred on}} board Braathens SAFE Flight 139 {{en route from}} Trondheim Airport, Værnes to Oslo Airport, Fornebu. The aircraft was a Boeing 737–205, named Harald Gille (after Harald IV of Norway) with registration LN-SUG. The day before the hijacking, Huseby graduated from upper secondary school, where he studied health and social work. That evening, he purchased an air gun in Trondheim. The weapon was in his hand luggage when boarding the aircraft at Trondheim Airport, Værnes, {{where there was no}} security control. He selected a seat {{at the rear of the}} aircraft. While airborne, the hijacker showed a female flight attendant the air gun, and asked her to inform the captain that he wanted control over the aircraft, but that otherwise all was to proceed as planned. <b>The</b> <b>flight</b> <b>attendant</b> and later the hijacker used the intercom to communicate with the pilot.

5000|$|The NTSB {{noted in}} its report that {{despite the fact that}} <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> crew did not {{communicate}} with the cabin crew during the emergency sequence, <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> <b>attendants</b> on their own initiative briefed and prepared the passengers for an emergency landing as the plane glided down. Just prior to touchdown, with no prior notice or cue from <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> crew that <b>the</b> plane was about to crash land, <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> <b>attendants</b> [...] "saw trees" [...] in the windows, and immediately yelled to the passengers a final [...] "brace for impact!" [...] command. <b>The</b> <b>flight</b> <b>attendants</b> also helped evacuate the passengers from the burning plane after the crash landing. The NTSB concluded that:The <b>flight</b> <b>attendants</b> acted commendably for initiating a comprehensive emergency briefing of the passengers for their protection in preparation for a crash landing. This contributed to the number of survivors.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>flight</b> <b>attendant</b> and {{two male}} {{passengers}} {{escaped from the}} burning wreck before rescuers arrived.

25|$|The Taiwanese report {{stated that}} the relief pilot (Crew Member 3, or CM-3) said in an {{interview}} that he was the first to leave the cockpit and the last to leave the aircraft (Pg. 108/508).
