This research was carried out by survey method. Data consist of primary and secondary data to calculate the production and quality of agricultural by products in Aceh Besar Regency. The production of agricultural by products was calculated based on dry matter, crude protein and <b>total</b> <b>digestible</b> nutrient. Animal capacity which is calculated based on agricultural by products with the following measurement; 1 animal unit consumes dry matter with the average of 6, 25 kg/day (2. 282, 25 kg/year), crude protein with average of 0, 06 kg/day (240, 9 kg/year) and <b>total</b> <b>digestible</b> nutrient with the average of 4, 3 kg/day (1. 569, 5 kg/year).

Pro-vitamin A content of the beet top silage was 1 - 2 mg. per 100 g. The silage was found to be a favourite feed with live-stock. Beet top silage contained 544 mg. oxalic acid per 100 g. The nutrient loss in fermentation process was 24 per cent in organic matter and 9 per cent in crude protein. The results of digestion experimets on rabbits showed that the digestibility coefficient of organic matter was 78 per cent; the digestible crude protein was 2 per cent and the <b>total</b> <b>digestible</b> nutrient 10. 4 per cent(cf. Table 9). 2) The beet tops lost 24 per cent of organic matter, 17 per cent of crude protein and 86 per cent of carotene during 10 days of sun-curing. The results of digestion experiments on rabbits showed that the digestibility coefficient of organic matter was 66 per cent, lower than that of fresh beet tops or beet top silage. The sun-cured beet tops were less palatable to rabbits than the fresh beet tops or the beet top silage. The contents of digestible crude protein and <b>total</b> <b>digestible</b> nutrient were 8. 4 per cent and 42. 0 per cent respectively. 3) A good silage was able to be prepared from beet pulp.

Bulls were randomly assigned to one of four treatments: 0, 5, 10, and 15 % (dry matter basis) of crude glycerol in the diet. Initially, 20 bulls were slaughtered to serve as a reference to estimate initial empty body weight, which allowed for carcass gain calculation. Bulls were weighed at the beginning, at two-thirds, and at the end of the experiment for performance calculations. Carcass measurements were obtained by ultrasound. Fecal output was estimated using indigestible neutral detergent fiber as an internal marker. Data were analyzed using the mixed procedures in SAS 9. 2 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). Intake of dry matter, organic matter, and neutral detergent fiber decreased linearly (P 0. 05) intakes of crude protein, non-fiber carbohydrates, and <b>total</b> <b>digestible</b> nutrients. Digestibility of dry matter, organic matter, neutral detergent fiber, and <b>total</b> <b>digestible</b> nutrients increased quadratically (P 0. 05). These results suggest that crude glycerol may be included in finishing beef diets at levels up to 15 % without impairing performance and carcass characteristics...|$|R
40|$|Nutritive {{evaluation}} of corn silage provides a unique challenge {{because it contains}} variable proportions of grain and stover that differ in chemical and physical characteristics. Although it can vary from 30 to 70 %, most corn silage con-tains about 50 % corn grain. Grain contributes more of the <b>total</b> <b>digestible</b> nutrients (TDN) in corn silage than the stover because it contains relatively digestible starch. The stover in corn silage is relatively mature and high in neutral detergent fiber (NDF) at harvest. Stover {{is a source of}} energy from digestible NDF and, depending on the length of chop, it can provide physically effective NDF (peNDF) to stimulate chewing activity and ruminal function...|$|R
40|$|Forage {{quality testing}} was {{completed}} on annual forages grown during 1998 and/or 1999. Included were spring cereals, legumes and summer annuals like sorghum and millets. Using a single cut harvest system when {{the majority of}} summer annuals had produced seed heads, crude protein (CP) was generally more than 8 % and <b>total</b> <b>digestible</b> nutrients (TDN) more than 63 % of dry matter. Annual legumes had 12 to 18 % CP and more than 63 % TDN. Pearl and irrigated foxtail millets had higher crude protein levels than sorghum forages, but nitrate levels were also higher. Some mineral contents varied by location and associated management...|$|R
