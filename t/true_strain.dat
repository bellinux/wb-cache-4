In the love of books, as in everything else, Diane and Henri II. were inseparable. The interlaced H and D are scattered over the covers of their volumes; the lily of France is twined round the crescents of Diane, or round the quiver, the arrows, and the bow which she adopted as her cognisance, in honour of the maiden goddess. The books of Henri and of Diane remained in the Chateau d'Anet till the death of the Princesse de Conde in 1723, when they were dispersed. The son of the famous Madame de Guyon bought the greater part of the library, which has since been scattered again and again. M.

40|$|Based on Continuum Damage Mechanics (CDM), a damage {{model for}} glass-bead-filled {{modified}} polyphenylene oxide (GB/PPO) {{has been proposed}} to describe its damage behavior at various levels of tensile strain by considering the reduction of effective loading area. Hence, an equation for prediction of effective elastic modulus of the damaged GB/PPO composites {{in terms of the}} three principal <b>true</b> <b>strains</b> was derived. The tensile properties and damage behaviors of the GB/PPO composites with different volume percentages of glass beads were investigated using standard tensile tests and load-unload tests, respectively. The addition of glass beads increases Young's modulus of PPO but has a weakening effect on its tensile strength. A maximum value of tensile work to break and tensile strain at break was found when 5 vol% of glass beads with a mean diameter of 11 mu m was blended with PPO. These results were justified through microscopic examination of the fracture surfaces of the tensile specimens by using a scanning electron microscope (SEM). In-situ observations of the strain damage processes were made through the SEM equipped with a tensile stage to determine the strain at fully debonding of glass beads. The volumetric strain of GB/PPO composites increases because of micro-cavitation during strain damage.
