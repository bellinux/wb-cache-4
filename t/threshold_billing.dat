5000|$|A taper, for example, {{may work}} with every pound earned over the {{relevant}} <b>threshold</b> being <b>billed</b> at say 50p. If the market rent were deemed £4,000 {{more than the}} current rent {{a year for the}} tenant, and that tenant earns £31,000 (outside London) they would pay £500 extra rental a year towards that market rent.

This model classified correctly 95. 0 % of the males and 81. 8 % of the females (overall success was 90. 3 %).

50|$|He has {{had three}} bills {{drawn from the}} member's ballot. In September 2010, his Smoke-free Environments (Removing Tobacco Displays) Amendment Bill was drawn from the member's ballot, {{attempting}} to ban the display of tobacco products and smoking accessories at points of sale. The bill's objective was subsequently adopted in a Government bill which came into force 23 July 2012. Lees-Galloway's Electoral (Adjustment of <b>Thresholds)</b> Amendment <b>Bill</b> was also drawn from the member's ballot in February 2013. It proposed amendments to the Electoral Act 1993, implementing {{the recommendations of the}} Electoral Commission with respect to the party vote threshold. In October 2013, his Land Transport (Safer Alcohol Limits for Driving) Amendment Bill, was drawn and progressed to First Reading. This bill would have lowered the allowable blood alcohol content (BAC) from 0.08g to 0.05g per 100mls of blood when driving. The Government announced their own legislation that would do the same after Lees-Galloway's bill was drawn. The legislation was passed July 2014.|$|R
40|$|Various {{legislative}} bills {{associated with}} the reauthorization of the federal Higher Education Act have included provisions that target colleges and universities that persistently increase tuition at rates beyond a set <b>threshold.</b> Under these <b>bills,</b> such institutions would be publicly identified and subject to sanctions, although the details of these sanctions have varied from bill to bill. For example, versions of the College Cost Reduction Act of 2007 would assign affordability alert status to institutions that increase tuition at {{more than twice the}} rate of inflation over a three-year period and do not meet exemption conditions. This analysis uses publicly available tuition and fees information to answer three questions: (a) which universities have had tuition increases greater than twice the rate of inflation in recent years; (b) how does the rate of change in tuition divided by the rate of inflation relate to tuition; and (c) are the institutions charging the highest tuition most frequently those that would be subject to sanctions...|$|R

The views expressed in this Working Paper {{are those of the authors}} and do not necessarily represent those of the IMF or IMF policy. Working Papers describe research in progress by the authors and are published to elicit comments and to further debate. The paper explores the extent to which the pressure of debt service on other spending items may push governments to embark on fiscal consolidation beyond what is strictly necessary to secure solvency. The empirical analysis identifies <b>thresholds</b> of interest <b>bill</b> indicators beyond which governments appear to shift to policies aimed at durably curbing the debt trajectory. Hence, in the current context of high inherited public debts, countries experiencing rising borrowing costs and interest payments would be more likely to enact more aggressive fiscal consolidations than warranted by strict solvency concerns. Conversely, those benefiting from persistently low interest rates despite rising debt stocks would likely opt for a more gradual fiscal consolidation path than what solvency considerations would normally dictate...|$|R
40|$|Since {{the late}} 1990 s, {{conditional}} cash transfers (CCTs) have been broadly disseminated {{as one of}} the best practices in social protection. Brazil has been a pioneer in this area and today h{{as one of the}} largest CCTs in the world, covering 26 per cent of the population. Created by the government at the end of 2003, Bolsa Família stemmed from a reform of previous programmes that had been in place since the beginning of 2000. The debate about income security and cash transfers in Brazil, however, started much earlier. In 1991, Senator Eduardo Suplicy of the Worker’s Party put forward a bill to create a negative income tax, in the form of a supplementary income for every person over 25 years of age whose gross monthly income fell below a certain <b>threshold.</b> Although the <b>bill</b> was unanimously approved by the Senate, the Chamber of Deputies never voted on it. Still, the idea made its way through academic and political circles, where the proposal to combine a minimum incom...|$|R
5000|$|Medicare and Medicaid {{currently}} pay clinicians {{the same}} amount regardless of results. But there is a pilot program to increase payments for doctors who deliver high-quality care at lower cost, while reducing payments for those who deliver low-quality care at higher cost. There’s a program that would pay bonuses to hospitals that improve patient results after heart failure, pneumonia, and surgery. There’s a program that would impose financial penalties on institutions with high rates of infections transmitted by health-care workers. Still another would test a system of penalties and rewards scaled {{to the quality of}} home health and rehabilitation care. Other experiments try moving medicine away from fee-for-service payment altogether. A bundled-payment provision would pay medical teams just one thirty-day fee for all the outpatient and inpatient services related to, say, an operation. This would give clinicians an incentive to work together to smooth care and reduce complications. One pilot would go even further, encouraging clinicians to band together into “Accountable Care Organizations” that take responsibility for all their patients’ needs, including prevention—so that fewer patients need operations in the first place. These groups would be permitted to keep part of the savings they generate, as long as they meet quality and service <b>thresholds.</b> The <b>bill</b> has ideas for changes {{in other parts of the}} system, too. Some provisions attempt to improve efficiency through administrative reforms, by, for example, requiring insurance companies to create a single standardized form for insurance reimbursement, to alleviate the clerical burden on clinicians. There are tests of various kinds of community wellness programs. The legislation also continues a stimulus-package program that funds comparative-effectiveness research—testing existing treatments for a condition against one another—because fewer treatment failures should mean lower costs.|$|R

MP Claude Gravelle, noted in House of Commons debates: [...] "the Conservatives decided to include things {{that have nothing to}} do with cyberbullying. For example, there is a subclause on terrorists and something else on people who steal cable television signals, which has absolutely nothing to do with cyberbullying". Meanwhile, Senator Mobina Jaffer argued in debates of the Senate, [...] "Amanda Todd's and Rehtaeh Parsons’ lives would have been no different if this bill had been enacted earlier". This legislation will make it illegal to distribute images of a person, in any way without their consent. It is said this could also violate people's privacy by giving authorities more power to watch what they are doing online. Police now only need [...] "reasonable grounds for suspicion" [...] to get a warrant. These warrants can now include allowing police to access online data, phone records and digital tracking. [...] "The bill also grants immunity to telecoms that voluntarily hand over data, a sticking point raising privacy concerns."

The use of wildlife rehabilitation for conservation is growing, but quantitative criteria are rarely used to guide whether and when to remove animals from the wild. Since 2006, large numbers of African penguin Spheniscus demersus chicks have been abandoned annually when adults enter moult with dependent young still in the nest. As part of conservation initiatives for this endangered species, these chicks were collected and hand reared to fledging age. Post-release survival has been well documented; {{in this study we}} develop models to predict survival of individuals during rehabilitation with the aim of improving hand-r earing success and guiding the use of scarce resources. For 1455 chicks abandoned between 2008 and 2013, we assessed whether a chick body condition index (BCI) could predict outcome (death or release) and time spent in rearing. In addition, for a subset of 173 chicks in 2012, we assessed whether BCI at admission influenced chick growth rates during rehabilitation and examined whether the use of additional structural measurements and sex provided additional power to predict outcome. Models predicted an 82. 9 % (95 % confidence interval: 73. 3 – 89. 5 %) release rate for chicks admitted with a BCI > 0, the proposed guideline for removal from colonies. This fell below 50 % for BCIs  <  − 1. 05; 66 % of chicks were admitted with BCIs between these <b>thresholds.</b> Adding <b>bill</b> length to BCI improved the relative model fit, but in both cases only ~ 70 % of rehabilitation outcomes were correctly predicted. Chicks that grew more quickly {{were more likely to be}} released and, for those that were released, had lower BCI at admission suggesting compensatory growth. Chicks were generally removed at an appropriate time to ensure successful hand-rearing. However, 32 % were admitted in good condition, highlighting the importance of using adaptive management to guide wildlife rehabilitation and the allocation of conservation resources.
