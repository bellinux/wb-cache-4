In addition, positive ions slowly drift westward and negative ions drift eastward, giving rise to a ring current. This current reduces the magnetic field at the Earth's surface. Particles that penetrate the ionosphere and collide with the atoms there give rise to <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> <b>of</b> the aurorae and also emit X-rays.|$|E
5|$|The scenes {{on board}} the Queen Anne were filmed aboard the famous {{passenger}} liner RMS Queen Mary, which has long {{been used as a}} hotel. The X-Files crew spent a total of eleven days filming on the Queen Mary, and erected wrap-around scaffolding on the bridge in order to block out <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> <b>of</b> nearby Long Beach, California. To make it look like it was raining during the scenes on the bridge, the crew installed large sprinkler systems to provide a constant supply of water. Unhappy with the remodeled style of the ship's corridors and ballroom, Carter had portions of the ship recarpeted and redecorated to give the finished episode a late-1930s style.|$|E
5|$|Many of Royal Oaks crew who {{had managed}} to jump from the sinking ship were dressed {{in little more than}} their nightclothes and were {{unprepared}} for the chilling water. A thick layer of fuel oil coated the surface, filling men's lungs and stomachs and hampering their efforts to swim. Of those who attempted the half-mile (800 m) swim to the nearest shore, only a handful survived. Gatt switched <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> <b>of</b> Daisy 2 on and he and his crew managed to pull 386 men from the water, including Royal Oaks commander, Captain William Benn. The rescue efforts continued for another {{two and a half hours}} until nearly 4:00am, when Gatt abandoned the search for more survivors and took those he had to Pegasus. Although aided by boats from Pegasus and the harbour, he was responsible for rescuing almost all the survivors, an act for which he was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, the only military award made by the British in connection with the disaster.|$|E

5|$|Scientifically, the light-observation {{experiments}} were unsuccessful, as both target locations {{were covered by}} thick cloud cover. However, Schirra was able to view lightning near Woomera, and noted <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> <b>of</b> a city {{a few hundred miles}} from Durban. The filtered photography for the Weather Bureau worked as planned, with 15photographs taken; the conventional color photography was less successful, with several of the 14photographs unusable due to overexposure or excess cloud cover. In the end, the conventional photographs were not used for scientific examination due to these problems. Schirra noted that the sheer amount of cloud coverage, worldwide, could provide problems for future activity of this kind; however, Africa, and the south-western United States, were perfectly clear. Postflight medical examination of Schirra disclosed nothing significant other than a degree of orthostatic hypotension caused by sitting inside the cramped capsule for hours.|$|E

White reflectors on the street sweep around Ciara and she is surrounded by dancers, many of whom are from the film, as they ascend a dark staircase and enter the club. When everyone arrives on the roof, Ciara meets up with Chamillionaire for his verse, and thereafter Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan, the stars of Step Up, make appearances in dance sequences. <b>The</b> <b>lights</b> <b>of</b> the cityscape begin to pulse to the music, and rain falls on the crowd.
