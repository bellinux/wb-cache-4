5|$|The {{chairman}} of <b>the</b> <b>Subcommittee</b> on Regulatory Affairs, Stimulus Oversight and Government Spending, U.S. Representative Jim Jordan held hearings on January 25, 2012, to investigate why the NHTSA opened a formal investigation only {{five months after}} the first postcrash battery fire occurred in June. <b>The</b> <b>subcommittee</b> of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform wanted to determine if government officials, including from NHTSA, purposely held back information on the Volt fire for political reasons.

5|$|The United States Senate {{inquiry into}} {{the sinking of the}} RMS Titanic was opened at the hotel on April 19, 1912 and {{continued}} there for some time in the Myrtle Room, before moving on to Washington, D.C.. John Jacob Astor IV {{was one of the people}} who perished on its ill-fated journey.

5|$|In 1998 Congressman Lamar S. Smith, {{chairman}} of <b>the</b> <b>Subcommittee</b> on Immigration and Claims, held {{hearings on the}} compensation issue.

5|$|In January 2003, Emanuel {{was named}} to the House Financial Services Committee and sat on <b>the</b> <b>sub{{committee}}</b> that oversaw Freddie Mac. A few months later, Freddie Mac Chief Executive Officer Leland Brendsel was forced out and the committee and subcommittee commenced {{more than a year of}} hearings into Freddie Mac. Emanuel skipped every hearing allegedly for reasons of avoiding any appearance of favoritism, impropriety, or conflict of interest.|$|E
5|$|Senator McCarthy's zeal {{to uncover}} {{subversion}} and espionage led to disturbing excesses. His browbeating tactics destroyed careers {{of people who}} were not involved in the infiltration of our government. His freewheeling style caused both the Senate and <b>the</b> <b>Subcommittee</b> to revise the rules governing future investigations, and prompted the courts to act to protect the Constitutional rights of witnesses at Congressional hearings.... These hearings are a part of our national past that we can neither afford to forget nor permit to reoccur.|$|E
5|$|Beginning {{with only}} two {{teachers}} and 26 students in a single classroom in Towner Road, the new association rapidly expanded over the 1960s, building special schools at Margaret Drive and Jurong, a sheltered workshop at Geylang, a residential home at Tampines {{as well as their}} main administration centre, Lee Kong Chian Centre. SARC started a subcommittee for services for those with less severe intellectual disabilities in 1971 and a youth volunteering group the year after; <b>the</b> <b>subcommittee</b> was split into an independent organisation, the Association for the Educationally Subnormal (AESN), in 1976. In 1983 SARC launched the first early intervention programme in Singapore, prompting other organisations to follow suit and set up an adjunct subcommittee that became Special Olympics Singapore.|$|E

5000|$|On September 5, 2014, <b>the</b> Senate Permanent <b>Subcommittee</b> on Investigations {{released}} its {{report on the}} controversy. [...] <b>The</b> <b>subcommittee's</b> majority report, authored by subcommittee chairman Senator Carl Levin and submitted for <b>the</b> <b>subcommittee's</b> Democrats, concurred with TIGTA's finding that inappropriate screening criteria were used but {{concluded that there was}} no intentional wrongdoing or political bias {{in the use of the}} criteria. The majority faulted TIGTA for omitting from its report that liberal groups were also selected for additional screening and that previous TIGTA inquiries found no indication of political bias at the IRS. [...] <b>The</b> <b>subcommittee's</b> Republican minority submitted a dissenting report authored by ranking member Senator John McCain which broadly validated the TIGTA report and accused the majority of minimizing bias against conservative groups, noting that most of the groups targeted for additional scrutiny were conservative.|$|R

5|$|In January 1971, Kennedy {{lost his}} {{position}} as Senate Majority Whip when he lost the support of several members and was defeated by Senator Robert Byrd of West Virginia, 31–24. He would later tell Byrd that the defeat was a blessing, as it allowed him {{to focus more on}} issues and committee work, where his best strengths lay and where he could exert influence independently from the Democratic party apparatus, and began a decade as chairman of <b>the</b> <b>Subcommittee</b> on Health and Scientific Research of the Senate Labor and Public Welfare Committee.|$|E
5|$|In June <b>the</b> <b>subcommittee</b> met {{to mark up}} the bill. Bordallo's {{amendment}} {{tightening the}} language prohibiting vessel transport of fins was passed by voice vote. A week later the full committee, after adding an amendment by Faleomavaega requiring that fins {{be attached to the}} carcasses, sent the bill to the full House. In July it was passed by voice vote and referred to the Senate, where it was sponsored by John Kerry of Massachusetts. It was read twice and referred to the Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation. No further action was taken before the 110th Congress adjourned, and the bill died.|$|E
5|$|Senators raised {{concerns}} that the Congress could either abuse such authority or neglect to enact any such legislation after the adoption of this proposal. Tennessee Senator Estes Kefauver, the Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Constitutional Amendments, a long-time advocate for addressing the disability question, spearheaded the effort until {{he died of a}} heart attack on August 10, 1963. Senator Keating was defeated in the 1964 election, but Senator Roman Hruska of Nebraska took up Keating's cause as a new member of <b>the</b> <b>Subcommittee</b> on Constitutional Amendments.|$|E

5|$|The {{assassination}} of John F. Kennedy showed {{the need for}} a clear way for determining presidential disability {{in the context of the}} Cold War. The new President, Lyndon B. Johnson, had once suffered a heart attack and – with the office of Vice President to remain vacant until the next term began on January 20, 1965 – the next two people in the line of succession were the 71-year-old Speaker of the House John McCormack and the 86-year-old Senate President pro tempore Carl Hayden. Senator Birch Bayh succeeded Kefauver as Chairman of <b>the</b> <b>Subcommittee</b> on Constitutional Amendments and set about advocating for a detailed amendment dealing with presidential disability.|$|E
5|$|There {{was also}} a growing public {{awareness}} in the U.S. of military activities in Laos. During October 1969, Senator Stuart Symington (D-MO) chaired hearings of <b>the</b> <b>Subcommittee</b> of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Security Agreements and Commitments Abroad. The testimony of subpoenaed witnesses revealed the history of U.S. involvement in the covert commitment to Laos. Due to the closed nature of the sessions and its heavily censored transcript, however, {{the nature and extent}} of that commitment was still very little understood by the American public.|$|E
5|$|A liberal {{member of}} Congress, Tierney voted {{along with other}} Democratic Representatives from Massachusetts. He sat on the House Committee on Education and Labor, where his {{priorities}} included green energy and increased college access. He co-authored several pieces of legislation, including the Green Jobs Act of 2007 and the College Affordability and Accountability Act of 2008. He is {{the former chairman of}} <b>the</b> <b>Subcommittee</b> on National Security and Foreign Affairs, where he helped establish the Commission on Wartime Contracting in Iraq and Afghanistan. From 1996 to 2012, Tierney comfortably won re-election in each cycle. He faced tougher challenges after his wife Patrice was convicted of felony tax fraud in 2010, narrowly defeating his Republican opponent in 2012. In the 2014 election, he lost the Democratic primary to Seth Moulton, who went on to hold the seat in the general election.|$|E
