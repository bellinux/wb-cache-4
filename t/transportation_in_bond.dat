25|$|McDonnell's {{campaign}} {{also turned}} to transportation, {{a major issue}} in heavily congested areas of Virginia, advocating issuing $3 billion <b>in</b> <b>transportation</b> <b>bonds</b> that had been approved by the Virginia General Assembly in 2007, but not funded with a revenue source, modernizing the Virginia Department of Transportation, and encouraging public-private partnerships to improve infrastructure. He supported widening I-66 inside the Beltway, improving I-95, and finishing the Metrorail to Dulles Airport project.|$|R
25|$|On April 30, 2010, McDonnell {{authorized}} issuing $493 million <b>in</b> <b>transportation</b> <b>bonds</b> <b>in</b> May 2010 and {{an additional}} $1.493 billion over the five years to finance previously approved transportation projects. The bonds {{were a part of}} a transportation package enacted three years previously, but had not been issued while Republican State Delegate Robert Marshall filed a lawsuit challenging the their constitutionality while certain transportation notes issued during the Gilmore Administration had not yet been paid off. Critics noted that Virginia lacked a revenue source to amortize the bonds. On December 9, 2010, McDonnell announced a revised transportation funding plan which included both $1.8 billion <b>in</b> <b>bonds</b> that had been approved in 2007, as well as an additional $1.1 billion which he proposed to pay back from future federal transportation funds. He also proposed to spend $150 million of the 2009–2010 budget surplus and $250 million in reserves to protect against gasoline tax revenue shortfalls. On January 9, 2011, McDonnell proposed funding projects to address traffic congestion in Northern Virginia and Hampton roads by diverting 0.25% of the sales tax collected in those areas from the General Fund into the transportation fund. Legislation was required to implement the proposal, and Democrats responded that the revenues were needed in the General Fund for schools and public safety and that the projected revenues were insufficient to make a difference on highway needs.|$|R

500|$|The city of Santee faced {{problems}} {{in the construction of}} the freeway from SR125 to SR67. As early as 1995, it was clear that the environmental impact report was delayed and that there would be funding difficulties. SANDAG allocated $23milliondollars (about $ in [...] dollars) in 1999 to purchase properties needed for the right-of-way. In 2001, SANDAG gave $138million (about $ in [...] dollars) to the expansion of SR52 to SR67, which was necessary for extending the freeway past Cuyamaca Street. But by 2003, the transportation committee of SANDAG voted to delay the project due to decreased state funding. The city of Santee was required to make improvements to Forester Creek to accommodate potential flooding, which cost $30million (about $ in [...] dollars); the work began in May2006. Funding issues were finally resolved in 2006 with voter-approved statewide <b>transportation</b> <b>bonds.</b> <b>In</b> 2007, highway construction costs increased; that year, the SANDAG transportation committee voted to fund the construction, taking money from a planned reversible lanes project on SR52.|$|R
