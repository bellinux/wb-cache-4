5|$|In {{the wake}} of the hurricane, the road {{networks}} of the affected countries remained severely disrupted for extended periods of time, hampering relief efforts in badly flooded regions. Government and emergency officials opened shelters and distributed food for the thousands that had lost <b>their</b> <b>homes</b> <b>or</b> sources of income. Throughout Central America and Mexico, 116people lost their lives and 16 others went missing. The disaster left swaths of private property, infrastructure, and farmland in complete ruins, leading to damage costs of more than $170million (1993USD).|$|E
5|$|More than 300 {{hours of}} footage was {{recorded}} by {{the students and the}} two Iraqi associate producers. It was transcribed, translated and edited into a 90-minute film. Getting the tapes out of Iraq proved difficult for Winter and O'Mahoney, who remained in the UK. They had to rely on journalists from many news agencies, especially those in the BBC News's Baghdad Bureau high-risk team, to smuggle the tapes out of Iraq. When curfews were enforced, weeks passed before the producers received new footage because it was impossible for anybody to leave <b>their</b> <b>homes</b> <b>or</b> the country.|$|E

5|$|Native North Americans {{were among}} the first to {{influence}} fire regimes by controlling their spread near <b>their</b> <b>homes</b> <b>or</b> by lighting fires to stimulate the production of herbaceous foods and basketry materials. Fire creates a heterogeneous ecosystem age and canopy structure, and the altered soil nutrient supply and cleared canopy structure opens new ecological niches for seedling establishment. Most ecosystems are adapted to natural fire cycles. Plants, for example, are equipped with a variety of adaptations to deal with forest fires. Some species (e.g., Pinus halepensis) cannot germinate until after their seeds have lived through a fire or been exposed to certain compounds from smoke. Environmentally triggered germination of seeds is called serotiny. Fire plays a major role in the persistence and resilience of ecosystems.|$|E
5|$|The JNA, {{supported}} by the paramilitaries and the TO, entered Lovas unopposed {{on the morning of}} 10 October. According to court testimony of one of the paramilitaries {{who took part in the}} events, the troops moving against Lovas were told to expect 300–400 ZNG troops defending the village. Once the attacking force entered the village, the troops continued to throw grenades and shoot at houses at random for several hours. During the assault, 22 civilians were killed in <b>their</b> <b>homes</b> <b>or</b> back yards. In the immediate aftermath of the takeover of Lovas, Croat civilians were required to wear white armbands and their houses were marked using white sheets. The marked houses were looted and torched by the TO and paramilitaries. Authority in the village was turned over to Ljuban Devetak, a member of the Dušan Silni paramilitaries. He was styled as the commander of the village, but the JNA remained in overall control of the entire region. Over the following week, 23 more civilians were killed by the paramilitaries and the TO troops in improvised detention facilities. The improvised prisons were also used for torture and abuse of captives, including war rape, causing serious injuries to 18 civilians.|$|E
5|$|The {{collision}} {{occurred at}} 8:45am. While {{the damage to}} Mont Blanc was not severe, it toppled barrels that broke open and flooded the deck with benzol that quickly flowed into the hold. As Imos engines kicked in, she quickly disengaged, which created sparks inside Mont-Blancs hull. These ignited the vapours from the benzol. A fire started at the water line and travelled quickly {{up the side of}} the ship as the benzol spewed out from crushed drums on Mont-Blancs decks. The fire quickly became uncontrollable. Surrounded by thick black smoke, and fearing she would explode almost immediately, the captain ordered the crew to abandon ship. A growing number of Halifax citizens gathered on the street or stood at the windows of <b>their</b> <b>homes</b> <b>or</b> businesses to watch the spectacular fire. The frantic crew of Mont-Blanc shouted from their two lifeboats to some of the other vessels that their ship was about to explode, but they could not be heard above the noise and confusion. As the lifeboats made their way across the harbour to the Dartmouth shore, the abandoned ship continued to drift and beached herself at Pier 6 near the foot of Richmond street.|$|E

5|$|Workers {{distributed}} about 4,100tons of {{food and}} 200,000litres of milk to the affected victims, by both land and air. In Veracruz, only 9helicopters were utilized to distribute food and water to isolated areas. About 948tons of medicine was also distributed. Helicopters assisted in transporting people to shelters. In Veracruz alone, 34people were rescued by boat and 1,131 by aircraft. In Puebla and Veracruz, 9,551troops were stationed to assist in relief work, utilizing 48helicopters, 4Hercules planes, and 10boats. Between Veracruz and Hidalgo, the Department of Social Development distributed about 18,500mattresses and other relief items. Workers quickly made repairs to highways, and by October19, all of the 28damaged federal highways were provisionally reopened; some of the reopened highways had to undergo additional construction work. The military worked to reopen other roads. In Veracruz, the Director of the Federal Electricity Commission noted that repairs to electrical systems were difficult {{in the immediate aftermath}} of the floods. Planes flew generators into Gutiérrez Zamora, Veracruz, mainly for hospitals, and by October20, 90% of the affected areas had their power restored. President Zedillo announced on October11 that the government would begin building new houses, part of the Emergency Housing Program initiative. In Puebla, the initial stages of the program would involve rebuilding 1,200houses and moving 500houses to safer lands. The Mexican government estimated that the housing program would help 37,000families. Mexico's agricultural ministry provided assistance for farmers to replant lost crops. Through the Temporary Employment Program, the federal government temporarily hired about 1million people who lost <b>their</b> <b>homes</b> <b>or</b> farms. Students gradually returned to school after repairs were made, and by October28, over 800,000students who were affected were able to return to school, including all of Oaxaca and Hidalgo. The area in Teziutlán, Puebla affected by the mudslide was never rebuilt, due to being labeled a high-risk area.|$|E
