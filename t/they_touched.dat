5|$|By August 3, Colonel Warren {{concluded}} the entire effort was futile and dangerous. The unprotected sailors were stirring up radioactive material and contaminating their skin, clothing, and, presumably, their lungs. When {{they returned to}} their support ship living quarters, they contaminated the shower stalls, laundry facilities, and everything <b>they</b> <b>touched.</b> Warren demanded an immediate halt to the entire cleanup operation. He was especially concerned about plutonium, which was undetectable on site.|$|E
5|$|In Scotland, Anne {{sometimes}} exploited court factionalism {{for her own}} ends, {{in particular}} by supporting the enemies of the Earl of Mar. As a result, James did not trust her with secrets of state. Henry Howard, active in the highly secret diplomacy concerning the English succession, subtly reminded James that though Anne possessed every virtue, Eve was corrupted by the serpent. In practice, Anne was little interested in high politics unless <b>they</b> <b>touched</b> {{on the fate of}} her children or friends.|$|E
5|$|Undaunted by {{this lack}} of {{confidence}} from his peers, Johnson continued to campaign to retain his office. Although his campaign was more vigorous than that of Van Buren, his behavior {{on the campaign trail}} raised concern among voters. He made rambling, incoherent speeches. During one speech in Ohio, he raised his shirt in order to display to the crowd the wounds he received during the Battle of the Thames. Charges he leveled against Harrison in Cleveland were so poorly received that <b>they</b> <b>touched</b> off a riot in the city.|$|E

5|$|During {{the latter}} half of the 1950s, the KWI met several times to discuss the need for a self-determined Indonesian Roman Catholic hierarchy. At these annual meetings, <b>they</b> <b>touched</b> on {{administrative}} and pastoral issues, including the translation of songs into Indonesian languages. In 1959 Cardinal Gr√©goire-Pierre Agagianian visited the country to see the Church's preparations. The KWI formally requested their own hierarchy in a May 1960 letter; this letter received a reply from Pope JohnXXIII dated 20March 1961, which divided the archipelago into six ecclesiastical provinces: two in Java, one in Sumatra, one in Flores, one in Sulawesi and Maluku, and one in Borneo. Semarang became the seat of the province of Semarang, and Soegijapranata its archbishop. He was elevated on 3January 1961.|$|E
5|$|Mariano {{was told}} that this refined cloth was {{restricted}} for use only by the bishop of the city. Mariano {{went to see the}} prelate, who was surprised by the request. He ordered an inquiry of Manuel, directed by the priest of Oncogate (Quispicanchi), a village close to the mountain. On June 12, 1783, the commission ascended Qullqipunku with Mariano; they found Manuel dressed in white and shining with a bright light. Blinded, they retreated, returning with a larger party. On their second try they reached the boy. But when <b>they</b> <b>touched</b> him, he was transformed into a tayanka bush (Baccharis odorata) with the crucified Christ hanging from it. Thinking the party had harmed his friend, Mariano fell dead on the spot. He was buried under the rock where Manuel had last appeared.|$|E
25|$|The Viking program {{consisted}} {{of a pair of}} American space probes sent to Mars, Viking 1 and Viking 2. Each spacecraft was composed of two main parts: an orbiter designed to photograph the surface of Mars from orbit, and a lander designed to study the planet from the surface. The orbiters also served as communication relays for the landers once <b>they</b> <b>touched</b> down.|$|E

25|$|In early powered radios, the {{headphone}} {{was part}} of the vacuum tube's plate circuit and carried dangerous voltages. It was normally connected directly to the positive high voltage battery terminal, and the other battery terminal was securely grounded. The use of bare electrical connections meant that users could be shocked if <b>they</b> <b>touched</b> the bare headphone connections while adjusting an uncomfortable headset.|$|E
25|$|From December 1970 through January 1971, the Raiders {{underwent}} retraining courses. After {{a few minor}} actions, in April 1971, 24 Raiders disguised in NVA garb {{provided with}} three 81mm mortars, were inserted north of Mu Gia to attack a NVA rest area. The Raiders' landing zone had been used previously by the MR 4 Raiders, {{but now it was}} occupied by North Vietnamese troops. The incoming Raiders were caught under fire as soon as <b>they</b> <b>touched</b> down and their CIA adviser lost all radio contact with them. Five weeks later, the first {{of a small group of}} only five survivors made it back to friendly territory.|$|E
25|$|Numerous {{stories are}} {{associated}} with the time preceding her death. The elderly Sister Bourgeoys was said to have given up her life to God in order to save that of a younger member of the Congregation who had fallen ill. After intense prayer, it is said that the young nun was cured and Marguerite fell terribly ill, dying soon thereafter. Her appeal continued after her death, as she was well known and highly regarded. The convent held an afternoon visitation open to the public; people treasured objects that <b>they</b> <b>touched</b> to her hands at this time, which became considered spiritual relics. Her body was kept by the parish of Ville-Marie, but her heart was removed and preserved as a relic by the Congregation.|$|E

25|$|The {{sacrifice}} {{of a bear}} for Artemis started with the Brauron cult. Every year a girl between five and ten years of age was sent to Artemis' temple at Brauron. The Byzantine writer Suidos relayed the legend in Arktos e Brauroniois. A bear was tamed by Artemis and introduced {{to the people of}} Athens. <b>They</b> <b>touched</b> it and played with it until one day a group of girls poked the bear until it attacked them. A brother of one of the girls killed the bear, so Artemis sent a plague in revenge. The Athenians consulted an oracle to understand how to end the plague. The oracle suggested that, in payment for the bear's blood, no Athenian virgin should be allowed to marry until she had served Artemis in her temple ('played the bear for the goddess').|$|E
500|$|Players {{create their}} own avatars when {{beginning}} the game. Different skin tones, facial features, clothing, and hairstyles are available for customizing these player representations. Players also receive a special linking book, a volume {{that serves as a}} portal to a personal world or Age, known as Relto. The main objective of the game is to explore and restore power to other Ages; players must also find seven [...] "journey cloths". These cloths serve as save points in lieu of a game-saving option; characters are transported to the last cloth <b>they</b> <b>touched</b> when they restart. As in previous Myst games, player characters cannot die. For example, falling off a cliff sends characters back to Relto. The personal Age serves as a hub in Uru, containing a bookshelf with linking books to Ages players have explored, as well as avatar customization options and game information.|$|E
500|$|As the {{two planes}} {{approached}} Darwin, word was received that a Japanese air raid was in progress there. The two B-17s therefore flew on to Batchelor Airfield, where <b>they</b> <b>touched</b> down at 09:30. MacArthur awarded Silver Stars to the crews {{of the two}} bombers. Brett's chief of staff, Brigadier General Ralph Royce, was on hand to greet them, and Brett had sent two Australian National Airways DC-3s {{to bring them to}} Melbourne. However, Jean now refused to fly any further, so MacArthur asked for a motorcade to take them to the nearest railway station, which was at Alice Springs, [...] away. Sutherland had received word of an incoming Japanese air raid, and asked Morhouse to intervene. Morhouse told MacArthur that Arthur, who had suffered badly from seasickness and airsickness, was on an intravenous feed, and could not guarantee that he would survive the trip across the desert. MacArthur then agreed to take the planes to Alice Springs. Sutherland had Huff hurry everyone onto the aircraft, which took off as the air raid siren sounded.|$|E

2500|$|Europe changed Weston's palette again. His colors became lighter, and {{his work}} more abstract. He and Faith made side-trips to Paris, France and became acquainted with {{painters}} working there. Captivated by etching, Weston learned the technique and began to experiment with it. During a stay at the beach with friends, Weston watched as <b>they</b> <b>touched.</b> He quickly sketched out the various positions and embraces they engaged‚Äîin until a skiff loaded with local fishermen became too interested, and the cavorting nude couple had to reclothe themselves for the day. Weston transformed the sketches into etchings, which he called 'the Love Series.' ...|$|E
2500|$|This project used sand-filled {{geotextile}} tube groins {{that were}} originally {{to remain in}} place for up to 3 years. A pipe was to transport sand from deeper water to the beach. The pipe was anchored by concrete blocks attached by fibre straps. A video showed the blocks bouncing off the coral in the current, killing whatever <b>they</b> <b>touched.</b> In places the straps broke, allowing the pipe to move across the reef, [...] "planing it down". Bad weather exacerbated the damaging movement and killed the project. The smooth, cylindrical geotextile tubes could be difficult to climb over before they were covered by sand.|$|E
