25|$|Audi's 'trademark' quattro {{permanent}} (or semi-permanent, {{dependent on}} gearbox type) four-wheel drive system {{was the only}} offering for the drivetrain. This normally distributes the engine torque as a 'default' 50:50 between front and rear axles, but can automatically dynamically apportion up to a bias of 20:80 to 80:20 front and rear. The automatic transmission utilizes a hydraulically controlled multi-plate clutch to apportion drive between front and rear axles, whereas the manual transmission variants utilize a <b>Torsen</b> type 1 Torque Sensing center differential. The rear axle final drive unit contains a <b>Torsen</b> type 1 Torque Sensing differential, instead of the more common hypoid open differential.|$|E
25|$|The LSD option, found {{standard}} on the pre-facelift GPX Limited Edition, {{was of a}} viscous type. However, by 1997 this option for the facelift models, found {{standard on}} the GP Version R, {{was similar to that}} of a <b>Torsen</b> type.|$|E
25|$|A special {{version of}} the 1JZ-GTE {{equipped}} JZA70, the 2.5 Twin Turbo R, had a <b>Torsen</b> differential, Bilstein suspension, larger diameter sway bars, Recaro seats, Momo wheel and gear knob and matching interior trim. The front lip included front brake ducts. The Twin Turbo R introduced the color option Jade Mica Green. This model was the fastest production A70.|$|E
25|$|The Boss 302 Laguna Seca edition is {{a further}} {{upgraded}} version of the Boss 302. Additions include Recaro sport seats, a <b>Torsen</b> limited-slip rear differential (both optional on the standard Boss 302), revised suspension tuning with unique spring and damper rates, and a larger rear stabilizer. The Laguna Seca model loses its rear seats, which are replaced by a cross-car X-brace to increase structural rigidity approximately 10%. It rides on 19X9-inch front and 19X10 inch rear light-weight alloy wheels with R-compound ultra high-performance tires. Ford Racing front brake ducts help cool the brakes.|$|E
25|$|At the 2015 North American International Auto Show a more refined, {{hardcore}} {{and limited}} production {{version of the}} GT350 was unveiled called the GT350R, it still has the GT350's 5.2-liter flat-plane crank V8, making a rated 526hp and 429lb.-ft. of torque, but items like the air conditioning, the stereo, the trunk floorboard, all the carpeting, the rear seats, and the backup camera have been removed. The GT350R is also equipped with carbon-fiber wheels that each weigh approximately 15 pounds less than the aluminum wheels on the GT350. Overall, the GT350R is 130lbs. lighter than the GT350. A larger splitter and rear wing help improve downforce, with the wing drawing the car's weight balance more rearwards. A <b>Torsen</b> limited-slip differential with a 3:73 axle ratio helps handling further. Serial #001 was sold at the 2015 Barrett-Jackson Scottsdale Auction for $1,000,000 with the proceeds to benefit the JDRF.|$|E

[...] This latest incarnation of the <b>Torsen</b> quattro, first seen in the B7 RS 4, can automatically dynamically apportion up to a maximum 100% torque to the rear axle, or up to 80% to the front, dependent on traction conditions.|$|E

2500|$|A {{six-speed}} {{manual transmission}} (parts code prefix: 01E, identification code: FDP) (gear ratios—1st: 3.500, 2nd: 1.889, 3rd: 1.320, 4th: 1.034, 5th: 0.806, 6th: 0.684), cooled by a NACA duct {{in the engine}} undertray, and Audi's Torsen-based quattro system, using the <b>Torsen</b> T-1 [...] "automatic torque biasing" [...] (ATB) center differential, with a 50:50 default bias were standard. [...] Final drive ratio was 4.111.|$|E
2500|$|Two years later, Audi, {{unveiled}} the second duo generation, the Audi 100 Duo – likewise {{based on the}} Audi 100 Avant quattro. Once again, this featured an electric motor, a [...] three-phase machine, driving the rear roadwheels. This time, however, the rear wheels were additionally powered via the <b>Torsen</b> centre differential from the main engine compartment, which housed a 2.0-litre four-cylinder engine.|$|E
2500|$|The S2000 was {{introduced}} in 1999 for the 2000 model year and was given the chassis designation of [...] "AP1". It features a front mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout with power delivered by a [...] inline four-cylinder DOHC-VTEC engine. The engine (codenamed F20C) produces outputs of , and [...] depending on the target market. The engine is mated to a six-speed manual transmission and <b>Torsen</b> limited slip differential. The S2000 achieved what Honda claimed as the highest specific output normally aspirated production automobile engine in the world. The most powerful version; the JDM F20C was rated at 250 ps (247 hp) or 125 ps per L {{as a result of}} a higher 11.7:1 compression ratio.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{focus of}} the B7 RS 4 was on the {{introduction}} of the latest development of Audi's 'trademark' quattro permanent four-wheel drive system. [...] This utilised the 'third generation' asymmetric/dynamic <b>Torsen</b> T-3 'automatic torque biasing' (ATB) centre differential, featuring a 'default' 40:60 front-to-rear torque split under normal conditions. [...] Audi stressed that this would result in a more neutral response in corners, and a more dynamic driving experience. [...] Also, a more aggressive Torque Bias Ratio (TBR) was used, and set to 4:1, as opposed to 2:1 (and later variants 3:1 TBR) on standard A4. [...] That means that one side of the differential can handle up to 80%, while the other side would have to only handle 20% of applied torque.|$|E

2500|$|The {{preferred}} form of LSD for drifting is {{the clutch}} type, in [...] "two-way" [...] form, for its consistent and aggressive lockup behavior under all conditions (acceleration and deceleration). Some drift cars use a spool [...] "differential", which actually has no differential action at all - the wheels are locked to each other. Budget-minded drifters may use a welded differential, where the side gears are welded {{to give the}} same effect as a spool. This {{makes it easier to}} break rear traction because it reduces maximum traction in all situations except traveling in a straight line. Welded differentials have an inherent risk involved: due to the tremendous amount of internal stress the welds may fail and the differential completely lock up leaving the rear wheels immobilized. Helical torque-sensing differentials such as the <b>Torsen</b> or Quaife (available on cars in certain stock trims such as S15, FD3S, MX-5, JZA80, UZZ3x) are also adequate. It is common for drifters to change the final gear ratio {{depending on the type of}} track layout.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Torsen</b> T3 centre {{differential}} {{combines a}} {{planetary gear set}} with a <b>Torsen</b> differential in a compact package developed for centre differential installations. Unlike the T2 <b>Torsen</b> where the torque split is a nominal 50:50, in the T3 <b>Torsen</b> the torque split, due {{to the use of}} the planetary gear set, is an actual asymmetric 40:60 front-rear torque split (i.e., when grip is equal on both front and rear axles, 40% of torque is sent to the front axle, and 60% to the rear). As with the T1 <b>Torsen,</b> torque will be distributed dynamically depending on tractive conditions, but with an actual (rather than nominal) static bias. The T3 allows handling characteristics and vehicle dynamics more akin to rear-wheel drive cars. This asymmetric <b>Torsen</b> was first introduced in the highly acclaimed 2006-model (B7) Audi RS4. The Type 3 <b>torsen</b> was used in the Audi S4 and RS4 B7 manual transmissions from 2006 to 2008, as well as the S6, S8, and Q7 models from 2007.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Torsen</b> {{differential}} {{was purchased}} by Toyoda Machine Works Ltd. which eventually merged with another company to form JTEKT <b>Torsen</b> North America.|$|E
50|$|The first Ford company {{vehicle to}} use a <b>Torsen</b> {{differential}} was the 2002 Ford Ranger FX4, renamed in 2003+ years to FX4 Level II, all of which used T-2R in the rear differential only. Starting in 2012, the Ford F-150 SVT Raptor uses a front <b>Torsen</b> differential and the Ford Mustang Boss 302 uses a rear <b>Torsen</b> differential.|$|E
