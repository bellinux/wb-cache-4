5|$|The Sun is a G-type {{main-sequence star}} that {{comprises}} about 99.86% {{of the mass}} of the Solar System. <b>The</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>has</b> an absolute magnitude of +4.83, estimated to be brighter than about 85% of the stars in the Milky Way, most of which are red dwarfs.|$|E
50|$|In {{the first}} round of the Eastern Conference Playoffs, <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>had</b> to face <b>the</b> Washington Mystics. Since <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> better record, the series would be played with game 1 at Washington, game 2 at Connecticut, and game 3 (if needed) at Connecticut. <b>The</b> <b>Sun</b> swept <b>the</b> Mystics and game 3 was not needed.In the second round of the Eastern Conference Playoffs, <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>had</b> to face rival Detroit Shock. Again, <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> better record and the series would be played with game 1 at Detroit and games 2 and 3 (if needed) at Connecticut. Even though <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>had</b> a better record in the regular season, Detroit had managed to beat Connecticut in all four of the season meetings. Surprisingly, <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> won game two of the series but went on to lose game three on their home court. Detroit {{advanced}} to the WNBA Finals. Had Connecticut advanced, it would have been the third consecutive season <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>had</b> made it to the WNBA Finals.|$|R

In the regular season, <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>had</b> beaten <b>the</b> Monarchs in both meetings. It was not enough, however. The Monarchs beat <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> 3 games to 1 to win the WNBA Finals.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Spurs and <b>Suns</b> <b>have</b> met 10 {{times in}} the playoffs. All of these {{meetings}} occurred from 1992 onwards. The Spurs have won 6 series and <b>the</b> <b>Suns</b> <b>have</b> won 4.|$|R
5|$|The {{enormous}} {{effect of}} the Sun on Earth has been recognized since prehistoric times, and <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>has</b> been regarded by some cultures as a deity. The synodic rotation of Earth and its orbit around the Sun are the basis of solar calendars, {{one of which is}} the predominant calendar in use today.|$|E
5|$|Astronomers {{estimate}} that the Solar System {{as we know it}} today will not change drastically until <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>has</b> fused almost all the hydrogen fuel in its core into helium, beginning its evolution from the main sequence of the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram and into its red-giant phase. Even so, the Solar System will continue to evolve until then.|$|E
5|$|Phoenix {{contains}} HE0107-5240, possibly one of {{the oldest}} stars yet discovered. It has around 1/200,000 the metallicity that <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>has</b> and hence must have formed very early {{in the history of the}} universe. With a visual magnitude of 15.17, it is around 10,000 times dimmer than the faintest stars visible to the naked eye and is 36000 light years distant.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>has</b> eight known planets. This {{includes}} four terrestrial planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars), two gas giants (Jupiter and Saturn), and two ice giants (Uranus and Neptune). The Solar System also {{has at least}} five dwarf planets, an asteroid belt, numerous comets, {{and a large number}} of icy bodies which lie beyond the orbit of Neptune.|$|E
5|$|The Sun {{is about}} halfway through its main-sequence stage, during which nuclear fusion {{reactions}} in its core fuse hydrogen into helium. Each second, more than four million tonnes of matter are converted into energy within the Sun's core, producing neutrinos and solar radiation. At this rate, <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>has</b> so far converted around 100 times the mass of Earth into energy, about 0.03% of the total mass of the Sun. The Sun will spend a total of approximately 10 billion years as a main-sequence star. The Sun is gradually becoming hotter during its time on the main sequence, because the helium atoms in the core occupy less volume than the hydrogen atoms that were fused. The core is therefore shrinking, allowing the outer layers of the Sun to move closer to the centre and experience a stronger gravitational force, according to the inverse-square law. This stronger force increases {{the pressure on the}} core, which is resisted by a gradual increase in the rate at which fusion occurs. This process speeds up as the core gradually becomes denser. It is estimated that <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>has</b> become 30% brighter in the last 4.5 billion years. At present, it is increasing in brightness by about 1% every 100 million years.|$|E
5|$|The corona is {{the next}} layer of the Sun. The low corona, near the surface of <b>the</b> <b>Sun,</b> <b>has</b> a {{particle}} density around 1015m−3 to 1016m−3. The average temperature of the corona and solar wind is about 1,000,000–2,000,000 K; however, in the hottest regions it is 8,000,000–20,000,000 K. Although no complete theory yet exists {{to account for the}} temperature of the corona, at least some of its heat is known to be from magnetic reconnection.|$|E

In the first two games, the Celtics attempted 58 free throws while <b>the</b> <b>Suns</b> <b>had</b> 44.|$|R
5|$|After the red-giant branch <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>has</b> {{approximately}} 120 {{million years}} of active life left, but much happens. First, the core, full of degenerate helium ignites violently in the helium flash, {{where it is}} estimated that 6% of the core, itself 40% of the Sun's mass, will be converted into carbon within a matter of minutes through the triple-alpha process. The Sun then shrinks to around 10 times its current size and 50 times the luminosity, with a temperature a little lower than today. It will then have reached the red clump or horizontal branch, but a star of the Sun's mass does not evolve blueward along the horizontal branch. Instead, it just becomes moderately larger and more luminous over about 100 million years as it continues to burn helium in the core.|$|E
5|$|Cockatoos are diurnal {{and require}} {{daylight}} {{to find their}} food. They are not early risers, instead waiting until <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> <b>has</b> warmed their roosting sites before feeding. All species are generally highly social and roost, forage and travel in colourful and noisy flocks. These vary in size depending on availability of food; in times of plenty, flocks are small and number a hundred birds or less, while in droughts or other times of adversity, they may swell up to contain thousands or even {{tens of thousands of}} birds; one record from the Kimberley noted a flock of 32,000 little corellas. Species that inhabit open country form larger flocks than those of forested areas.|$|E
5|$|Eclipses {{can occur}} {{only when the}} Sun is within about 15 to 18 degrees of a node, (10 to 12 degrees for central eclipses). This is {{referred}} to as an eclipse limit. In the time it takes for the Moon to return to a node (draconic month), the apparent position of <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>has</b> moved about 29 degrees, relative to the nodes. Since the eclipse limit creates a window of opportunity of up to 36 degrees (24 degrees for central eclipses), it is possible for partial eclipses (or rarely a partial and a central eclipse) to occur in consecutive months.|$|E

5|$|Grasshoppers are {{affected}} by diseases caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi and protozoa. The bacteria Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa have both been implicated in causing disease in grasshoppers, as has the entomopathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana. This widespread fungus {{has been used to}} control various pest insects around the world, but although it infects grasshoppers, the infection is not usually lethal because basking in <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> <b>has</b> the result of raising the insect's temperature above a threshold tolerated by the fungus. The fungal pathogen Entomophaga grylli is able to influence the behaviour of its grasshopper host, causing it to climb {{to the top of a}} plant and cling to the stem as it dies. This ensures wide dispersal of the fungal spores liberated from the corpse.|$|E
5|$|Gravitational {{interaction}} with nearby stars and galactic tides modified cometary orbits {{to make them}} more circular. This explains the nearly spherical shape of the outer Oort cloud. On the other hand, the Hills cloud, which is bound more strongly to <b>the</b> <b>Sun,</b> <b>has</b> not acquired a spherical shape. Recent {{studies have shown that the}} formation of the Oort cloud is broadly compatible with the hypothesis that the Solar System formed as part of an embedded cluster of 200–400 stars. These early stars likely played a role in the cloud's formation, since the number of close stellar passages within the cluster was much higher than today, leading to far more frequent perturbations.|$|E
5|$|In 1984, Physicist Richard A. Muller {{postulated}} that <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>has</b> a heretofore undetected companion, either a brown dwarf or a red dwarf, in an elliptical orbit within the Oort cloud. This object, known as Nemesis, was hypothesized {{to pass through}} {{a portion of the}} Oort cloud approximately every 26million years, bombarding the inner Solar System with comets. However, to date no evidence of Nemesis or the Oort cloud have been found, and many lines of evidence (such as crater counts), have thrown their existence into doubt. Recent scientific analysis no longer supports the idea that extinctions on Earth happen at regular, repeating intervals. Thus, the Nemesis hypothesis is no longer needed to explain current assumptions.|$|E

Since <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> better record, the series would be played with game 1 at New York, game 2 at Connecticut, and game 3 (if needed) at Connecticut.

5|$|In a 2009 {{interview}} with the Discovery Channel, Mike Brown noted that, {{while it is not}} impossible that <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>has</b> a distant planetary companion, such an object would have to be lying very far from the observed regions of the Solar System to have no detectable gravitational effect on the other planets. A Mars-sized object could lie undetected at 300AU (10 times the distance of Neptune); a Jupiter-sized object at 30,000AU. To travel 1000AU in two years, an object would need to be moving at 2400km/s– faster than the galactic escape velocity. At that speed, any object would be shot out of the Solar System, and then out of the Milky Way galaxy into intergalactic space.|$|E
5|$|Kepler-8 {{is a star}} {{located in}} the {{constellation}} Lyra {{in the field of}} view of the Kepler Mission, a NASA-led operation tasked with discovering terrestrial planets. The star, which is slightly hotter, larger, and more massive than <b>the</b> <b>Sun,</b> <b>has</b> one gas giant in its orbit, Kepler-8b. This gas giant is larger than Jupiter, but is less massive, and thus more diffuse. The planet's discovery was announced to the public on January 4, 2010 along with four other planets. As the fifth confirmed planetary system verified by Kepler, it helped demonstrate the capabilities of the Kepler spacecraft.|$|E
5|$|Planetary geologists have {{measured}} the relative quantities of oxygen isotopes in {{samples from the}} Earth, the Moon, Mars, and meteorites, but were long unable to obtain reference values for the isotope ratios in the Sun, {{believed to be the}} same as those of the primordial solar nebula. Analysis of a silicon wafer exposed to the solar wind in space and returned by the crashed Genesis spacecraft has shown that <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>has</b> a higher proportion of oxygen-16 than does the Earth.
