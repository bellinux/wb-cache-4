5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Iranian</b> Constitutional Revolution in 1905 {{triggered}} <b>the</b> <b>Iranian</b> women's movement, which {{aimed to}} achieve women's equality in education, marriage, careers, and legal rights. However, during <b>the</b> <b>Iranian</b> revolution of 1979, {{many of the}} rights that women had gained from the women's movement were systematically abolished, such as the Family Protection Law.|$|E
5|$|On 1 November 2012, two Iranian Su-25s fired cannon bursts at a USAF MQ-1 Predator drone 16 {{nautical}} miles off <b>the</b> <b>Iranian</b> coast. <b>The</b> <b>Iranian</b> government has {{claimed that the}} drone violated its airspace.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Iranian</b> {{government}} accused Israel of {{complicity in}} the killings. In 2011 and 2012, Iranian authorities arrested a number of Iranians alleged to have carried out the assassination campaign on behalf of Mossad (the Israeli intelligence service). Western intelligence services and U.S officials reportedly confirmed the Israeli connection. In June 2012, <b>the</b> <b>Iranian</b> government was confident that it had arrested all the assassins.|$|E
50|$|Facing declining {{morale and}} with the Shatt-al-Arab {{waterway}} still blocked by <b>the</b> besieged <b>Iranians,</b> Saddam ordered <b>the</b> Iraqi troops to attack in June, 1981. <b>The</b> <b>Iranians</b> had reinforced <b>the</b> garrison with 15,000 troops, including the Pasdaran, regular army, and local Khuzestani Arab fighters. Iraq unleashed an offensive against the city, using 60,000 troops and tanks, outnumbering <b>the</b> <b>Iranians</b> 4-1. Despite that, <b>the</b> <b>Iranians</b> defeated <b>the</b> Iraqi assaults. <b>The</b> <b>Iranians</b> used their Chieftain tanks to help defeat the Iraqis.|$|R
50|$|With such static defenses, the Iraqis had {{effectively}} made frontal assault {{through the}} flat lands {{virtually impossible for}} <b>the</b> <b>Iranians.</b> Thus <b>the</b> <b>Iranians</b> would launch their amphibious attacks.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} morning hours of 23 May 1982, <b>the</b> <b>Iranians</b> began <b>the</b> drive towards Khorramshahr across the Karun River. This part of Operation Beit ol-Moqaddas was spearheaded by the 77th Khorasan {{division}} with tanks along with the Revolutionary Guard and Basij. <b>The</b> <b>Iranians</b> hit <b>the</b> Iraqis with destructive air strikes and massive artillery barrages, crossed the Karun River, captured bridgeheads, and launched human wave attacks towards the city. Saddam's defensive barricade collapsed; in less than 48 hours of fighting, the city fell and 19,000 Iraqis surrendered to <b>the</b> <b>Iranians.</b> A total of 10,000 Iraqis were killed or wounded in Khorramshahr, while <b>the</b> <b>Iranians</b> suffered 30,000 casualties. During the whole of Operation Beit ol-Moqaddas, 33,000 Iraqi soldiers were captured by <b>the</b> <b>Iranians.</b>|$|R
5|$|According to Shahbazi. the Zu'l-faqar and {{the lion}} {{decorated}} <b>the</b> <b>Iranian</b> flags at the time. It seems that {{towards the end}} of Fath' Ali Shah’s reign the two logos were combined and the lion representing Ali was given Ali's saber, Zu'l-faqar.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the private}} American {{intelligence}} agency Stratfor,a fifth Iranian scientist was poisoned by Mossad in 2007. However, in 2014 the scientist's sister accused <b>the</b> <b>Iranian</b> government of involvement in her brothers killing.|$|E
5|$|Although aid {{operations}} {{continued for}} some time, <b>the</b> <b>Iranian</b> government ceased rescue work on May 14. No more survivors {{were expected to}} be found in the rubble.|$|E
50|$|It {{marked the}} first time that <b>the</b> <b>Iranians</b> had {{successfully}} invaded and occupied Iraqi territory. <b>The</b> <b>Iranians</b> defeated several Iraqi Republican Guard counter-offensives and managed to hang on to their foothold.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Iranians</b> {{attacked}} <b>the</b> vital oil-producing Majnoon Island by landing troops by helicopters {{onto the}} islands and severed the communication lines between Amarah and Basra. <b>The</b> <b>Iranians</b> continued theattack towards Qurna.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Iranians</b> {{launched}} their {{assault on the}} peninsula at night, their men arriving on rubber boats. After taking <b>the</b> Faw, <b>the</b> <b>Iranians</b> built a pontoon bridge and began to dig in.|$|R
5|$|Beginning in July 2014, Hezbollah sent an {{undisclosed}} number of technical advisers and intelligence analysts to Baghdad {{in support of}} <b>the</b> <b>Iranian</b> intervention in Iraq (2014–present). Shortly thereafter, Hezbollah commander Ibrahim al-Hajj was reported killed in action near Mosul.|$|E
5|$|He {{also added}} Sindh and Sin of the Indian subcontinent (Al-Hind) to the list. This general {{statement}} of al Masudi is fully {{supported by the}} medieval geographers who make mention of fire temples in most of <b>the</b> <b>Iranian</b> towns.|$|E
5|$|Radio Free Europe {{reported}} that the novel {{is a favorite of}} Mohammad-Ali Abtahi, <b>the</b> <b>Iranian</b> pro-democracy activist, who read it (in the Persian translation by Gholamhossein Mirza-Saleh) shortly after being released from prison in 2009.|$|E
50|$|Thus <b>the</b> <b>Iranians</b> were {{eventually}} {{driven out of}} their positions, and the highway retaken by the Iraqis; however, the latter sustained massive losses {{in the air as}} a result. Operation Badr resulted in 10,000 casualties for Iraq and 15,000 casualties for Iran and the Iraqi counterattacks were able to force <b>the</b> <b>Iranians</b> back to their previous lines, sustaining almost as heavy casualties as <b>the</b> <b>Iranians.</b>|$|R
50|$|Strategically, {{the attack}} had brought <b>the</b> <b>Iranians</b> {{within sight of}} their primary targets, but the Iraqis always held the upper hand against <b>the</b> poor <b>Iranian</b> attacks. In <b>the</b> end, <b>the</b> <b>Iranians</b> had lost thousands, and had only succeeded in {{capturing}} relatively worthless land (with the exception of Majnoon Island). In the end Iran failed to permanently occupy Iraqi lands or to defeat the Iraqi military, it wasn't long before <b>the</b> <b>Iranians</b> {{came to realize that}} victory was out of reach. Khomeini accepted the truce.|$|R
50|$|The Iraqis had easily {{defeated}} <b>the</b> <b>Iranians.</b> While <b>the</b> <b>Iranians</b> {{had been}} a powerful force prior to the revolution, the damage inflicted by the revolution had {{made it possible for}} the Iraqis to gain a victory like this. Nevertheless, a centralized and inflexible Iraqi command and lack of foresight resulted in a failure to capitalize on their victory, which saved <b>the</b> <b>Iranians</b> from a total rout. The Iraqis primarily dug in their tanks into the ground to act as static artillery, and while that worked at the fighting around Dezful and Susangerd, it meant that they were unable to follow up their victory and destroy <b>the</b> <b>Iranians.</b> Instead, they remained dug in as <b>the</b> <b>Iranians</b> withdrew. A minor Iraqi counterattack with helicopters and some armor was beaten back by <b>Iranian</b> forces near <b>the</b> town of Shush which lay just behind the Karkheh river on the line of advance to Dezful.|$|R
5|$|The {{daffodil}} is {{the national}} flower of Wales, associated with Saint David's Day (March 1). The narcissus is also a national flower symbolising the new year or Newroz in <b>the</b> <b>Iranian</b> culture.|$|E
5|$|According to Oan Ali Mohammed, {{suppression}} of the Arab sovereignty movement was the spark {{that led to his}} desire to attack <b>the</b> <b>Iranian</b> Embassy in London. The plan was inspired by the Iran hostage crisis in which supporters of the revolution held the staff of the American embassy in Tehran hostage.|$|E
5|$|Although President Jimmy Carter {{tried to}} place another {{limit on the}} arms race with a SALT II {{agreement}} in 1979, his efforts were undermined by the other events that year, including <b>the</b> <b>Iranian</b> Revolution and the Nicaraguan Revolution, which both ousted pro-US regimes, and his retaliation against Soviet intervention in Afghanistan in December.|$|E
50|$|The {{battle of}} Khorramshahr {{was the first}} major {{engagement}} between Iraqi and <b>Iranians</b> forces in <b>the</b> war. After occupying the city on October 26, the city remained in Iraqi hands until April 1982, when <b>the</b> <b>Iranians</b> launched Operation Beit ol-Moqaddas (Persian: بیت المقدس) to recapture the Khuzestan province. The first attack (April 30 to May 12) consisted of 70,000 Revolutionary Guard troops and succeeded in pushing the Iraqis out of the Ahvaz-Susangerd area. The Iraqis withdrew back to Khorramshahr and, on May 20, launched a large counter-attack against <b>the</b> <b>Iranians,</b> which was repulsed. <b>The</b> <b>Iranians</b> then launched an all-out assault on Khorramshahr, capturing two of the defense lines in the Pol-e No and Shalamcheh region. <b>The</b> <b>Iranians</b> gathered near <b>the</b> Shatt al-Arab (known as Arvand Rud in Iran) waterway, surrounding the city and, thus, beginning the second siege. <b>The</b> <b>Iranians</b> finally recaptured <b>the</b> city on May 24 after two days of bitter fighting and heavy losses, capturing 19,000 soldiers from a demoralized Iraqi Army after the fighting was over.. As a result, the Iraqis now know May 24 as “bad lucky Day”, although <b>the</b> <b>Iranians</b> celebrate <b>the</b> day as the Liberation of Khorramshahr.|$|R
50|$|However, the operation, {{which was}} {{intended}} as the breakthrough operation, was bogged down by a superior Iraqi defence. <b>The</b> <b>Iranians</b> would succeed in capturing individual Iraqi lines of defence, but <b>the</b> <b>Iranians</b> would be too exhausted materially and physically to move before the Iraqis could support the next line of the defence. Eventually, by <b>the</b> 24th, <b>the</b> <b>Iranians</b> were unable to advance any further towards the highway, and were still 10 miles from the highway. The operation was called off on the 24th.|$|R
5000|$|The Indo-Aryans {{split-off}} around 1800-1600 BCE from <b>the</b> <b>Iranians,</b> where-after {{they were}} defeated and {{split into two}} groups by <b>the</b> <b>Iranians,</b> who dominated <b>the</b> Central Eurasian steppe zone and [...] "chased them to the extermities of Central Eurasia." [...] One group were the Indo-Aryans who founded the Mitanni kingdom in northern Syria (ca.1500-1300 BCE). The other group were the Vedic people, who were pursued by <b>the</b> <b>Iranians</b> [...] "across <b>the</b> Near East to the Levant (the lands of the eastern Mediterranean littoral), across Iran into India." ...|$|R
5|$|During the 1980 {{assault on}} <b>the</b> <b>Iranian</b> Embassy, SAS {{soldiers}} used CS gas (that was contained within Stun Grenades) to incapacitate the hostiles who {{had kept the}} building under siege for six days. All the remaining hostages were saved and {{all but one of}} the hostiles were eliminated, with the other being taken into custody.|$|E
5|$|Halab's {{location}} {{has always}} been a factor in its prominence as an economic center. Yamhad's economy was based on trade with <b>the</b> <b>Iranian</b> Plateau, Mesopotamia, Cyprus and Anatolia, with the city of Emar as its port on the Euphrates, and Alalakh with its proximity to the sea as its port on the Mediterranean.|$|E
5|$|In 2001 <b>the</b> <b>Iranian</b> {{government}} {{collaborated with}} the Cheetah Conservation Fund, the IUCN, Panthera, United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), and the Wildlife Conservation Society on the Conservation of Asiatic Cheetah Project (CACP) to protect the natural habitat of the Asiatic cheetah and its prey, to ensure that development projects do not hamper its survival, and to highlight {{the plight of the}} Asiatic cheetah. Iran declared 31August as National Cheetah Day in 2006.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Iranians</b> were {{completely}} {{taken by surprise}} during the battle, and had failed to regroup to counterattack. They were outnumbered 6:1 in infantry and had virtually no armor. Many, if not most, were killed or sickened by Iraqi mass chemical weapons bombardments. They fought stubbornly at first, but then began to retreat. Iraqi fighter jets bombed {{two of the three}} pontoon bridges crossing the Shatt-al-Arab, causing chaos among <b>the</b> <b>Iranians.</b> Less than two days into <b>the</b> attack, <b>the</b> <b>Iranians</b> had been driven from the Faw peninsula.|$|R
50|$|In re-taking <b>the</b> city, <b>the</b> <b>Iranians</b> {{captured}} approximately 19,000 {{soldiers from}} a demoralized Iraqi Army. On the other hand, Saddam Hussein {{was shocked and}} furious by the defeat in Khorramshahr and {{at the fact that}} <b>the</b> <b>Iranians</b> had pushed on despite sustaining heavy casualties. <b>The</b> <b>Iranians</b> had even been forced to commit their reserves in order to keep on driving back <b>the</b> Iraqis. <b>Iranians</b> had shown incredible determination. Saddam ordered the execution of a number of top Iraqi officers responsible for the defense of the city.After the defeat at Khorramshahr, Saddam Hussein executed several of his top generals, such as the commander of the 9th Division.|$|R
50|$|In {{preparation}} for Operation Beit ol-Moqaddas, <b>the</b> <b>Iranians</b> had launched numerous air raids against Iraq air bases, destroying 47 jets (including Iraq's brand new Mirage F-1 fighter jets from France); this gave <b>the</b> <b>Iranians</b> air superiority over the battlefield while {{allowing them to}} monitor Iraqi troop movements.|$|R
5|$|In 2005–2006 the British Museum {{mounted a}} major {{exhibition}} on the Persian Empire, Forgotten Empire: the World of Ancient Persia. It {{was held in}} collaboration with <b>the</b> <b>Iranian</b> government, which loaned the British Museum a number of iconic artefacts in exchange for an undertaking that the Cyrus Cylinder would be loaned to the National Museum of Iran in return.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, the Port of Mogadishu's {{management}} reportedly {{reached an}} agreement with representatives of <b>the</b> <b>Iranian</b> company Simatech Shipping LLC to handle vital operations at the seaport.

5|$|In February 2012, President Obama froze {{all assets}} of <b>the</b> <b>Iranian</b> {{government}} in the U.S., which included the Citibank account alleged {{to be controlled by}} Bank Markazi. However, there were concerns that existing laws were insufficient for the account to be used to settle the judgments. Bank Markazi claimed that the account was not an asset of Bank Markazi, but its intermediary, Clearstream, in relation to both TRIA and New York state property law.|$|E
50|$|The CIA {{had hoped}} that Shahwani's INIS could be an {{effective}} national force and a deterrent to Iranian meddling. To mount effective operations against <b>the</b> <b>Iranians,</b> Shahwani recruited <b>the</b> chief of the Iran branch of the Saddam Hussein-era Mukhabarat. That made <b>the</b> <b>Iranians</b> and their Shiite allies nervous.|$|R
50|$|On 25 December 1986, Iran {{launched}} Operation Karbala-4 (Karbala {{referring to}} Hussein ibn Ali's Battle of Karbala). According to Iraqi General Ra'ad al-Hamdani, {{this was a}} diversionary attack. <b>The</b> <b>Iranians</b> launched an amphibious assault against the Iraqi island of Umm al-Rassas in the Shatt-Al-Arab river, parallel to Khoramshahr; they then set up a pontoon bridge and continued the attack, eventually capturing it in a costly success and failing to advance further; <b>the</b> <b>Iranians</b> had 60,000 casualties, while the Iraqis 9,500. The Iraqi commanders exaggerated Iranian losses to Saddam and {{it was assumed that}} <b>the</b> main <b>Iranian</b> attack on Basra had been fully defeated and that it would take <b>the</b> <b>Iranians</b> six months to recover. When <b>the</b> main <b>Iranian</b> attack, Operation Karbala 5 began, many Iraqi troops were on leave.|$|R
50|$|On 21 July, <b>the</b> <b>Iranians</b> {{tried again}} with a second thrust and managed to {{penetrate}} through the Iraqi defence lines once again. However, only 13 km (8.1 mi) from Basra, <b>the</b> poorly equipped <b>Iranian</b> forces were surrounded on three sides by Iraqis with heavy weaponry. Some were captured, while many were killed. The Iraqi counter-attack once again pushed <b>the</b> <b>Iranians</b> back to their starting point where fighting slowed to a stalemate. Only a last-minute attack by Iranian Cobra helicopters stopped the Iraqis from routing <b>the</b> <b>Iranians</b> completely. Three more similar Iranian attacks occurred around the Khorramshar-Baghdad road area {{towards the end of}} the month, but none were significantly successful.|$|R
