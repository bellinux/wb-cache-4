This research also shows that the laws governing pollution in <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>sea</b> are not effective and hence have contributed to the vulnerability of <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>sea.</b> Chapter one describes the problem generally while taking into account what other authors or authorities have said about this problem of deliberate oil discharge into <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>sea,</b> critical analysis of the legal frame work has been discussed in chapter two, challenges of eradicating the problem of deliberate or intentional oil discharge in the selected countries has been analyzed in chapter three, while conclusion and recommendations of what should be done have been set out in chapter four...|$|R

5|$|Following Jutland, Barham {{was under}} repair until 5 July 1916. On {{the evening of}} 18 August, the Grand Fleet put to sea in {{response}} to a message deciphered by Room 40 that indicated that <b>the</b> <b>High</b> <b>Seas</b> Fleet, minus II Squadron, would be leaving harbour that night. The German objective was to bombard Sunderland on 19 August, based on extensive reconnaissance conducted by Zeppelins and submarines. The Grand Fleet sailed with 29 dreadnoughts and 6 battlecruisers while the Germans mustered 18 dreadnoughts and 2 battlecruisers. Throughout the next day, Jellicoe and Vice-Admiral Reinhard Scheer, commander of <b>the</b> <b>High</b> <b>Seas</b> Fleet, received conflicting intelligence; after reaching the location in the North Sea where they expected to encounter <b>the</b> <b>High</b> <b>Seas</b> Fleet, the British turned north in the erroneous belief that they had entered a minefield. Scheer turned south again, then steered south-eastward to pursue a lone British battle squadron sighted by an airship, which was in fact the Harwich Force of cruisers and destroyers under Commodore Reginald Tyrwhitt. Realising their mistake, the Germans changed course for home. The only contact came in the evening when Tyrwhitt sighted <b>the</b> <b>High</b> <b>Seas</b> Fleet but was unable to achieve an advantageous attack position before dark, and broke off contact. The British and the German fleets returned home; the British lost two cruisers to submarine attacks, and one German dreadnought had been torpedoed. After returning to port, Jellicoe issued an order that prohibited risking the fleet in the southern half of the North Sea due to the overwhelming risk from mines and U-boats unless the odds of defeating <b>the</b> <b>High</b> <b>Seas</b> Fleet in a decisive engagement were favourable.|$|E

40|$|Observations of {{sea level}} and {{precipitation}} in Malmö, Sweden {{in the southeastern}} part of the sound Öresund {{have been used to}} estimate the probabilities of local compound events of <b>high</b> <b>sea</b> level and large daily and hourly rains. There are observations of sea level and daily rains extending back to 1930. The observations of short-term rainfall are from 1980 and onwards. Most large rainfalls come in the summer, while <b>the</b> <b>highest</b> <b>sea</b> levels are in the autumn and in <b>the</b> winter. <b>The</b> <b>highest</b> observed <b>sea</b> level is about 130 cm above mean sea level, and the largest daily rain is close to 100 mm.

From the statistics of daily rains, hourly rains and sea level, extreme values for each of them have been computed. For events with frequency higher than one per four years the probabilities of combined events sea level - rainfall are determined directly from the observations. For more rare events, marginal distributions of sea level and rainfall are determined. Copulas and conditional probabilities are used. When the sea level exceeds 20 cm above mean sea level, daily rains exceeding 10 mm are almost independent of the sea level and so are hourly rains exceeding 5 mm.
