5|$|The strict {{sense of}} values and <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> of devotion to a cause, which became so {{characteristic}} of him in later life, were derived, in part at least, from the instruction imparted so zealously and unquestioningly inside the severely unadorned walls of the Baptist Church at Otterville.|$|E

But no commodity will bear threepence, or will bear a penny, when <b>the</b> general <b>feelings</b> {{of men are}} irritated, and two {{millions of people are}} resolved not to pay. <b>The</b> <b>feelings</b> of <b>the</b> colonies were formerly <b>the</b> <b>feelings</b> of Great Britain. Theirs were formerly <b>the</b> <b>feelings</b> of Mr. Hampden when called upon for the payment of twenty shillings. Would twenty shillings have ruined Mr. Hampden's fortune? No! but the payment of half twenty shillings, on the principle it was demanded, would have made him a slave.|$|R
5|$|Bashō was {{introduced}} to poetry at a young age, and after integrating himself into the intellectual scene of Edo (modern Tokyo) he quickly became well known throughout Japan. He made {{a living as a}} teacher; but then renounced the social, urban life of the literary circles and was inclined to wander throughout the country, heading west, east, and far into the northern wilderness to gain inspiration for his writing. His poems were influenced by his firsthand experience of the world around him, often encapsulating <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> of a scene in a few simple elements.|$|E
5|$|Do I wish I {{had never}} endured post-partum depression? Absolutely. But {{to deny the}} {{experience}} is to deny who I am.

The initial boxing sequences were shot from a spectator's view outside of the ring but later sequences were filmed more intimately from inside the ring. Cinematographer Patrick Cady used camera rigs that allowed the actors to hit him or the camera itself to mimic <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> of being hit.|$|E

5|$|In Retford, MacMillan was {{introduced}} to ballet by a local dance teacher, Jean Thomas. He had already had lessons in Scottish dancing in Dunfermline and tap dancing in Great Yarmouth, and he took to ballet immediately. In 1942 his mother died, which caused him acute and lasting distress. His father was a distant figure, and the boy's only close family relationship was with an elder sister. His obituarist in The Times suggests that <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> of being an outsider, displayed in many of MacMillan's ballets, had its roots in his childhood.|$|E
5|$|It {{was some}} time {{afterward}} when the thought flashed upon {{my mind that}} the disturbances I had observed {{might be due to}} an intelligent control.

5|$|Lyrically {{the songs}} {{reflected}} the band members' experiences {{growing up in}} Belleville. Farrar and Tweedy romanticized tales about unemployment, alcoholism, and <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> {{of living in a}} small town in an effort to emulate the profundity of songwriters such as Woody Guthrie. Musically, No Depression was influenced by the start-stop musical pattern of the Minutemen. The cover of the album features a blurry photo of the band, taken by J. Hamilton, reminiscent of the albums released on Folkways Records.|$|E
50|$|Many {{instances}} of interpersonal emotion regulation, {{such as those}} described above, are dyadic; in other words, they involve one person trying to influence <b>the</b> <b>feelings</b> of another person. However, interpersonal emotion regulation can occur between larger social groups. For example, in the workplace a leader might try to influence <b>the</b> <b>feelings</b> of {{a whole group of}} followers to make them feel more enthusiastic and motivated. Or in support groups, the whole group might work together to influence <b>the</b> <b>feelings</b> of a member to make the member feel less anxious or depressed.|$|R

5|$|Mehldau has {{expressed}} an interest in, and knowledge of, philosophy and literature. In a 2003 interview he commented on romanticism and nostalgia, linking pleasure and pain to musical expression: I love {{the part of the}} Orpheus myth where he is allowed to take his wife out of Hades on the condition that he doesn't look back at her for the trip on the river Styx. When he can't help himself, he looks back, and she is pulled back downstream away from him, taken away forever. Music is that moment right when he looks at her: seeing something that you love for an instant being taken away forever. There's an element of folly to the whole thing – you look even though you know you shouldn't. Music kind of yokes together <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> of attainment and <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> of loss at the same time.|$|E

5|$|The {{conflict}} between Pistrucci and William Wyon {{continued into the}} late 1840s, and sometimes featured in the press, contributing to <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> that all was not well at the Mint. A Royal Commission on reform of the Royal Mint was appointed in 1848. Pistrucci submitted a report, in which he settled some old scores. The reforms abolished the positions of chief engraver (Wyon died in 1851) and chief medallist, with Pistrucci appointed a modeller and engraver to the Mint, to receive a salary in addition to payment for any work done.|$|E
5|$|The {{score for}} the demo was {{composed}} by Mathew Valente, {{who had been with}} the project since its Nintendo 64 version. The score was to consist in arrangements of the official Chrono Trigger soundtrack written by Yasunori Mitsuda, Nobuo Uematsu and Noriko Matsueda. Valente's goal was to retain <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> of the original music while enhancing it for a modern platform. Most of the arrangements were created in the Impulse Tracker format, then converted to MIDI and enhanced with a number of tools.|$|E
40|$|To {{examine a}} model of {{relationships}} between feelings of gratitude and prosocial motivation in adolescents, a survey of 414 second grade {{of high school students}} and 191 undergraduate students in Thailand was conducted using a multi-aspect questionnaire about gratitude. The questionnaire measured the following items involved in hypothetical helping situations: (a) perception on gains for a recipient, cost of a benefactor, desirability of the favor, and obligation to give help as cognitive variables affecting <b>the</b> <b>feelings</b> of gratitude; (b) <b>the</b> <b>feelings</b> of gratitude which include feelings of appreciativeness, indebtedness, and general positive; and (c) enhancement of prosocial motivation on recipients as a consequence of gratitude. Results indicated that, in high school and undergraduate students, appreciativeness is <b>the</b> only <b>feeling</b> that showed positive correlation to the enhancement of prosocial motivation, whereas the perception on the cost of a benefactor and the gain of a recipient showed positive correlation to <b>the</b> <b>feelings</b> of appreciativeness. In addition, both groups of students reported more degree of <b>the</b> <b>feelings</b> of appreciativeness and enhancement of the prosocial motivation when regarding their father and mother’s help rather than that of friends. It is also discussed that <b>the</b> <b>feelings</b> of appreciativeness correlated with a concept of respect which probably strengthens the potential of gratitude in promoting prosocial motivation...|$|R

Codemasters approached Peter Williamson of Supersonic Software and had him produce the sequel. Williamson had just completed Cosmic Spacehead and wanted to do something new. It was intended for the sequel to reproduce <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> {{of the original}} and add as many new features as possible. The original was used for reference, and the code and graphics were produced from the beginning. Williamson explained that it was hoped that they could capture and go beyond that the original game offered, and the game's success was anticipated. Darling wanted it {{to be more than a}} mere continuation of the first.|$|E
5|$|During {{his time}} as a student, Gaudí was able to study a {{collection}} of photographs of Egyptian, Indian, Persian, Mayan, Chinese and Japanese art owned by the School of Architecture. The collection also included Moorish monuments in Spain, which left a deep mark on him and served as an inspiration in many of his works. He also studied the book Plans, elevations, sections and details of the Alhambra by Owen Jones, which he borrowed from the School's library. He took various structural and ornamental solutions from nazarí and mudéjar art, which he used with variations and stylistic freedom in his works. Notably, Gaudí observed of Islamic art its spatial uncertainty, its concept of structures with limitless space; its feeling of sequence, fragmented with holes and partitions, which create a divide without disrupting <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> of open space by enclosing it with barriers.|$|E
5|$|I {{must confess}} that, like many others, I {{did not come}} painlessly to the Natural History. For years I was {{put off by the}} aura of {{sanctity}} and bluffness which seemed to surround it.
