40|$|This study {{examines}} how the importing process time affects export patterns at an establishment level. We first theoretically discuss {{the effects of}} import time on not only exports but also <b>export</b> <b>shipment</b> frequency and <b>exports</b> per <b>shipment.</b> Then, we derive some propositions regarding those effects. Next, by employing highly detailed customs data for Thailand from 2007 to 2011, we empirically investigate those propositions. In this study, the time to import is measured at an establishment level using {{the difference between the}} dates on which import shipments arrived in ports and then were released from the container yard. Our main finding is that a longer time reduces <b>total</b> <b>exports,</b> particularly through decreasing export frequency. Significantly negative effects on <b>exports</b> per <b>shipment</b> appear in some specific cases. A longer time to import also reduces total imports, particularly through decreasing import frequency...|$|R

In 1995, expectations {{arising from the}} new discoveries of sizable oil reserves and double-digit growth in the non-oil economyâ€”led by the timber industryâ€”dominated economic developments. However, the fiscal position was again expansionary, as the fiscal deficit grew to 5 percent of GDP, exacerbating imbalances and adding to external payments arrears. Total budgetary revenue {{as a share of}} GDP fell and noninterest expenditure increased sharply including unclassified spending on the order of 3 percent of GDP.

40|$|A {{number of}} stylized facts have been {{documented}} about the extensive margin of trade— whether to export or not, and, if so, how many products to how many destinations. We note {{that some of the}} reported facts would be expected to arise if <b>exports</b> <b>shipments</b> were randomly allocated across categories (e. g., product codes, destination countries). They are, thus, not informative of the underlying economic decisions. We formalize the random assignment of shipments to categories as balls falling into bins, reproducing the structure inherent to disaggregate trade data. The balls-and-bins model quantitatively reproduces the prevalence of zero productlevel trade flows across export destinations. The model also accounts for firm-level facts: as in the data, most firms export a single product to a single country but these firms represent a tiny fraction of <b>total</b> <b>exports.</b> In contrast, the balls-and-bins cannot match the small fraction of exporters among U. S. firms and overpredicts their size premium relative to non-exporters. We argue that the balls-and-bins model is a useful statistical tool to discern the interesting facts in disaggregated trade data from patterns arising mechanically through chance. ...|$|R

The empirical analysis, based on the vector error correction modelling (VECM), suggests that both <b>total</b> <b>exports</b> and manufacturing exports have both long run and contemporaneous effects on the growth of GDP as well as manufacturing output. According to the non-nested tests, <b>total</b> <b>exports</b> emerges as the engine of export-led growth (i. e., GDP). For manufacturing output, however, both <b>total</b> <b>exports</b> and manufacturing exports emerge as engines of growth.
