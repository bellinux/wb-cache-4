5|$|On January 6, 1917, Rutherford, aged 47, {{was elected}} {{president}} of the Watch Tower Society, unopposed, at the Pittsburgh convention. By-laws passed by both the Pittsburgh convention and the board of directors stated that <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>would</b> be the executive officer and general manager of the Society, giving him full charge of its affairs worldwide.|$|E
5|$|Anyone who {{has ever}} studied the history of American diplomacy, {{especially}} military diplomacy, knows that you might start in a war with certain things on your mind as a purpose {{of what you are}} doing, but in the end, you found yourself fighting for entirely different things that you had never thought of before... In other words, war has a momentum of its own and it carries you away from all thoughtful intentions when you get into it. Today, if we went into Iraq, like <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>would</b> like us to do, you know where you begin. You never know where you are going to end.|$|E
5|$|The {{assassination}} of Abraham Lincoln was deemed a fluke {{due to the}} Civil War, and Garfield, like most people, saw no reason why {{the president should be}} guarded; Garfield's movements and plans were often printed in the newspapers. Guiteau knew <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>would</b> leave Washington for a cooler climate on July 2, and made plans to kill him before then. He purchased a gun he thought would look good in a museum, and followed Garfield several times, but each time his plans were frustrated, or he lost his nerve. His opportunities dwindled to one—Garfield's departure by train for New Jersey on the morning of July 2, 1881.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} the Richmond {{convention}} opened, Randolph had abandoned the Anti-Federalist cause, which damaged efforts by Mason and Henry to co-ordinate with their counterparts in New York. Mason moved that the convention consider the document clause by clause, which may have played {{into the hands of}} the Federalists, who feared what the outcome of an immediate vote might be, and who had more able leadership in Richmond, including Marshall and Madison. Nevertheless, Broadwater suggested that as most delegates had declared their views before the election, Mason's motion made little difference. Henry, far more a foe of a strong federal government than was Mason, took the lead for his side in the debate. Mason spoke several times in the discussion, on topics ranging from the pardon power (which he predicted <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>would</b> use corruptly) to the federal judiciary, which he warned would lead to suits in the federal courts by citizens against states where they did not live. John Marshall, a future Chief Justice of the United States, downplayed the concern regarding the judiciary, but Mason would later be proved correct in the case of Chisholm v. Georgia (1793), which led to the passage of the Eleventh Amendment.|$|E
5|$|Illinois Senator Lyman Trumbull, {{leader of}} the Moderate Republicans and Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, was anxious to reach an {{understanding}} with the President. He ushered through Congress a bill extending the Freedmen's Bureau beyond its scheduled abolition in 1867, and the first Civil Rights Bill, to grant citizenship to the freedmen. Trumbull met several times with Johnson, and was convinced <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>would</b> sign the measures (Johnson rarely contradicted visitors, often fooling those who met with him into thinking he was in accord). In fact, the President opposed both bills as infringements on state sovereignty. Additionally, both of Trumbull's bills were unpopular among white Southerners, whom Johnson hoped to include in his new party. Johnson vetoed the Freedman's Bureau bill on February 18, 1866, {{to the delight of}} white Southerners and the puzzled anger of Republican legislators. He considered himself vindicated when a move to override his veto failed in the Senate the following day. Johnson believed that the Radicals would now be isolated and defeated, and that the Moderate Republicans would form behind him; he did not understand that Moderates too wanted to see African Americans treated fairly.|$|E
5|$|Spirit Splash occurs the Friday {{before the}} Homecoming game, {{and serves as}} a pep rally where {{students}} descend into the pond to demonstrate school spirit. Spirit Splash began in 1995 when then-Student Body President Miguel Torregrossa was pushed into the Reflecting Pond by one of his cabinet members and fellow students followed suit. Along with the thousands of students who attend, there are members of the community, local dignitaries, alumni, children and even dogs who come to join in on the festivities. Knightro, the Marching Knights, cheerleaders, student athletes, and dancers all participate in the pep rally, usually followed by a concert. Spirit Splash was made possible in part by weight testing performed on the Reflecting Pond in preparation for President Richard Nixon's visit to the university to speak at its 1973 commencement. It was determined {{that the best way to}} protect <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>would</b> be to hold commencement in the pond itself, after being drained, so that Secret Service agents could be stationed on the roofs of the adjacent buildings.|$|E
50|$|During these summits <b>the</b> <b>presidents</b> <b>would</b> hold {{meetings}} on energy, infrastructure, {{education and social}} policies, in addition to defining a transitional formula until {{the full force of}} the treaty, which must still be approved by legislatures, comes into effect. Foreign ministers are to meet every six months.|$|R

5|$|The Presidency was {{established}} in 1990 and <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>would,</b> according to the altered constitution, be elected by the Soviet people by direct and secret ballot. However, {{the first and only}} Soviet President, Mikhail Gorbachev, was elected by the democratically elected Congress of People's Deputies. In connection with the dissolution of the Soviet Union national elections for the office of President never took place. To be elected to the office a person must have been a Soviet citizen and older than thirty-five but younger than sixty-five years. The same person could not be elected president for more than two terms. The Presidency was the highest state office, and was the most important office in the Soviet Union by influence and recognition, eclipsing that of Premier and General Secretary. With the establishment of the Presidency executive power was shared between the President and the Prime Minister. The Presidency was given broad powers, such as being responsible for negotiating the membership of the Cabinet of Ministers with the Supreme Soviet; the Prime Minister, however, was responsible for managing the nomenklatura and economic matters.|$|E
5|$|The {{committee}} also shortened the president's term {{from seven}} years to four years, freed the president to seek re-election after an initial term, and moved impeachment trials from the courts to the Senate. They also created {{the office of the}} vice president, whose only roles were to succeed a president unable to complete a term of office, to preside over the Senate, and to cast tie-breaking votes in the Senate. The committee transferred important powers from the Senate to the president, for example the power to make treaties and appoint ambassadors. One controversial issue throughout much of the Convention had been the length of the president's term, and whether the president was to be term limited. The problem had resulted from the understanding that <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>would</b> be chosen by Congress; the decision to have the president be chosen instead by an electoral college reduced the chance of the president becoming beholden to Congress, so a shorter term with eligibility for re-election became a viable option.|$|E
25|$|A National Commission of Security Guarantees presided by <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>would</b> {{have the}} goal of {{designing}} and monitoring public and criminal policy on the dismantlement of all criminal organizations and persecution of other criminal conducts threatening the peace agreement.|$|E

25|$|The Supreme Prosecutors' Office of Korea (SPO), in laying {{charges against}} Choi and two former presidential aides, have alleged that President Park colluded {{with the three}} in certain {{criminal}} activities. <b>The</b> <b>president</b> <b>would</b> be questioned by prosecutors, {{the first time this}} has occurred with a serving South Korean president.|$|E
25|$|Pennsylvania’s 1776 Constitution, {{which lasted}} until 1790, {{provided}} for a Supreme Executive Council consisting of twelve members chosen by popular ballot. The council and the unicameral legislature would elect a president from {{the members of}} the council, but <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>would</b> hold little authority over the council even in regards to military power.|$|E
25|$|John Wesley was the {{longtime}} {{president of the}} Methodist Conference, but after his death {{it was agreed that}} in future, so much authority would not be placed in the hands of one man. Instead, <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>would</b> be elected for one year, to sit in Wesley's chair. Successive Methodist schisms resulted in multiple presidents, before a united conference assembled in 1932.|$|E

25|$|In The Federalist Papers, James Madison {{explained}} {{his views on}} {{the selection of the}} president and the Constitution. In Federalist No. 39, Madison argued the Constitution was designed to be a mixture of state-based and population-based government. Congress would have two houses: the state-based Senate and the population-based House of Representatives. Meanwhile, <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>would</b> be elected by a mixture of the two modes.|$|E
25|$|As {{agreed on}} May 11, 2016, the final {{agreement}} {{would be considered}} as a special agreement under the terms of common article 3 of the Geneva Conventions and registered, following its signature, before the Swiss Federal Council in Bern. Afterwards, <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>would</b> make a unilateral declaration {{in the name of the}} Colombian State before the Secretary General of the UN, relating the final agreement to Resolution 2261 of January 25, 2016.|$|E
25|$|The {{referendum}} {{would go}} ahead, {{but since the}} impeachment vote failed, the Congress of People's Deputies sought to set new terms for a popular referendum. The legislature's version of the referendum asked whether citizens had confidence in Yeltsin, approved of his reforms, and supported early presidential and legislative elections. The parliament voted {{that in order to}} win, <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>would</b> need to obtain 50 percent of the whole electorate, rather than 50 percent of those actually voting, to avoid an early presidential election.|$|E
50|$|In {{the case}} of the United States electing a married woman as <b>President,</b> her husband <b>would</b> presumably be {{addressed}} as either First Man or First Gentleman, while <b>the</b> <b>President</b> herself <b>would</b> presumably be addressed as Madam President.|$|R

50|$|During Augusto Pinochet's {{military}} regime from 1973 to 1989, the University experienced many profound changes. On 2 October 1973, Decree number 50 of 1973 stated that <b>the</b> University's <b>presidents</b> <b>would</b> be {{designated by the}} {{military regime}}.|$|R
25|$|As {{early as}} 1852, Dr. John M. Bernhisel, Utah's Mormon {{delegate}} to Congress, {{had suggested that}} an impartial committee be sent to investigate the actual conditions in the territory. This call for an investigation was renewed during the crisis of 1857 by Bernhisel and even by Senator Stephen A. Douglas. However, <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>would</b> not wait. Under massive popular and political pressure, President Buchanan decided to take decisive action against the Mormons soon after his inauguration on 4 March 1857.|$|E
25|$|The GWMNMA {{also made}} some {{organizational}} changes. Between 1910 and 1951, the association had had just three presidents (Shyrock, Watres, and Arn). The GWMNMA {{board of directors}} decided that imposing term limits on the office of <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>would</b> give board members {{a chance to become}} president and implement new ideas more frequently. In 2004, the GWMNMA amended its constitution to impose a limit of three one-year terms on presidents of the association. In 2008, the number of presidential terms limit was reduced further to two one-year terms.|$|E
