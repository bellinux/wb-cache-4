5|$|After scoring 43 in {{the first}} innings, the second Test in Lahore came down to a run-chase for Australia, with Harvey and Norm O'Neill {{seemingly}} on schedule to win before time ran out. However, the Pakistani fielders began <b>to</b> <b>waste</b> <b>time</b> {{in an attempt to}} foil an Australian victory. They swapped the cover and midwicket fielders very slowly whenever the left and rightt-handed combination of Harvey and O'Neill took a single and changed the batsman on strike. To counter this, Harvey deliberately backed away from a straight ball and let himself be bowled, throwing his wicket away for 37. This allowed Benaud to come in and bat with O'Neill so that the two rightt-handed batsmen would give the Pakistanis no opportunity <b>to</b> <b>waste</b> <b>time</b> by switching the field. Australia won the match with minutes to spare. Harvey scored 54 and 13 not out in the drawn third Test at Karachi. Australia took the series 2–0, but would not win another Test in Pakistan until 1998. Harvey ended the series with 273 runs at 54.60.|$|E

5|$|Liverpool kicked-off {{the second}} half, and within 13 seconds they had scored {{to lead the}} match 3–0. Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher kicked {{the ball into the}} Bayern half, defender Thiam missed his header, which meant the ball dropped to Owen, who {{controlled}} the ball with his right foot and then put the ball into the Bayern goal with his left foot. Bayern reduced the deficit in the 57th minute when Salihamidžić scored. He headed the ball into the Liverpool goal from Bayern's first corner of the match to reduce the deficit to two goals. Midway through the half both teams made substitutions. Bayern replaced Sforza, Claudio Pizarro and Salihamidžić for Niko Kovač, Carsten Jancker and Roque Santa Cruz respectively. Liverpool substituted Gerrard and Riise for Igor Bišćan and Danny Murphy respectively. Liverpool started to pass the ball around their midfield and defence in an attempt <b>to</b> <b>waste</b> <b>time,</b> however in the 82nd minute Bayern scored again. Substitute Jancker headed into the Liverpool goal from a cross by Elber. Immediately afterwards Bayern had an opportunity to equalise, however Lizarazu's shot was straight at Liverpool goalkeeper Sander Westerveld. No further goals were scored and the referee blew for full-time with the final score 3–2 to Liverpool.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} season O'Neill was Australia's leading batsman {{during the}} 1959–60 tour to Pakistan and India, {{where he was}} a part of the last Australian team to win a Test on Pakistani soil for 39 years. After a quiet match in the First Test eight-wicket win in Dacca in East Pakistan (now Bangladesh), in which he scored two and 26 not out, O'Neill played a key role in the victory in the Second Test in Lahore that was to Australia's last in Pakistan until 1998. O'Neill made his maiden Test century of 134 in the first innings to give Australia a 245-run lead. He then took his maiden Test wicket in Pakistan's second innings, that of Shujauddin. This left Australia chasing a target of 122 in the last two hours on the final day. The chase was on schedule with O'Neill partnering Neil Harvey when the Pakistanis began wasting time to prevent an Australian victory. This was implemented by swapping fielders very slowly when the left and rightt-handed combination of Harvey and O'Neill took a single, and overs began taking seven minutes instead of three. To counter this, Harvey deliberately backed away when a ball was aimed at the stumps and threw away his wicket by letting himself be bowled for 37. This allowed Benaud to come in and bat with O'Neill so that the two rightt-handed batsmen would give no opportunity <b>to</b> <b>waste</b> <b>time</b> by switching the field. Benaud then threatened Pakistani captain Imtiaz Ahmed with a formal complaint over the time-wasting, and proceesings returned to their normal pace. Australia made the target with a few minutes to spare, with O'Neill on 43. O'Neill failed to make double figures in the final Test, which was drawn, but ended the series with 218 runs at 72.66. In another tour match, against the President's XI, O'Neill scored an unbeaten 52 in a low-scoring match as Australia stumbled to their target of 116 with only three wickets in hand.|$|E

A subject lacking earth signs will lack common sense and practicality and find it difficult to finish anything they start. They may be scatty, unrealistic and clumsy, hopeless with money and unreliable. Planets in the 2nd, 6th and 10th houses and an emphasis on fixed signs in the chart will help to compensate for this lack.|$|E
25|$|The fourth Test, {{in front}} of Hutton's home crowd, was Hutton's least {{successful}} of the series. Having been put into bat by Hassett, the first time an Australian captain had fielded first against England since 1909, Hutton was bowled second ball by a Yorker from Lindwall. England never recovered, batting very slowly to score 167 and after the first innings, Australia led by 99 with three days left. Hutton scored only 25 in the second innings but England batted for a long time, assisted by rain, leaving Australia 177 in 115 minutes to win the game. The tourists were winning easily when Hutton asked Bailey to use the negative tactic of leg theory, bowling wide of leg stump to {{make it hard to}} score runs, while using a long run-up <b>to</b> <b>waste</b> <b>time.</b> Only twelve overs were bowled in the last 45 minutes, then considered slow, Australia lost a wicket and the tactics resulted in Australia being 30 short of their target when the game ended. Wisden noted that only a defensive policy had prevented England losing. Hutton was criticised for negativity by the Australian press, but Bill Bowes wrote that the gravity of the situation justified Hutton's tactics.|$|E
25|$|In many cases, an {{objection}} {{to a request}} for unanimous consent will compel a vote. While forcing a single vote {{may not be an}} effective delaying tool, the cumulative effect of several votes, which take at least 15 minutes apiece, can be substantial. In addition to objecting to routine requests, senators can force votes through motions to adjourn and through quorum calls. Quorum calls are meant to establish {{the presence or absence of}} a constitutional quorum, but senators routinely use them <b>to</b> <b>waste</b> <b>time</b> while waiting for the next speaker to come to the floor or for leaders to negotiate off the floor. In those cases, a senator asks for unanimous consent to dispense with the quorum call. If another senator objects, the clerk must continue to call the roll of senators, just as they would with a vote. If a call shows no quorum, the minority can force another vote by moving to request or compel the attendance of absent senators. Finally, senators can force votes by moving to adjourn, or by raising specious points of order and appealing the ruling of the chair.|$|E

25|$|Even in the non-international tour matches, Lawry's {{team could}} not escape controversy. The next match against South Zone at Bangalore {{generated}} more allegations of cheating. Australia's reserve wicketkeeper Ray Jordon claimed that Alan Connolly had bowled Prasanna. Prasanna disagreed but eventually walked after Jordon repeatedly insisted that he was out. The Australians then had an altercation {{in the dressing room}} after some members accused Jordon of cheating, asserting that the delivery had missed the stumps. Lawry scored 120 in the first innings, his only century of the tour, as his colleagues collapsed to be all out for 195. This gave South a 44-run lead and they declared at 6/255 on the final day. Australia needed to bat for only two hours on the final day to salvage a draw, but a collapse had them at 8/90 with an hour left with Lawry still at the crease. Gleeson came out to bat and talked with both umpires at length before taking guard; he later claimed to teammates that he had threatened to hit the umpires in the head if they gave him out. Gleeson then padded every ball away without attempting a shot, but every leg before wicket appeal was rejected. In an attempt <b>to</b> <b>waste</b> <b>time,</b> Lawry pulled away from the wicket when a woman in a colourful sari walked into front of the sightscreen, leading to allegations that he had insulted Indian womanhood. In any case, the crowd expressed dismay at the Australian tactics by rioting and throwing rocks at the players. The match ended early because of the crowd trouble and Australia avoided being the first international team to lose to an Indian zone.|$|E
500|$|In June 1958 Monteux {{conducted}} the London Symphony Orchestra (LSO) in three concerts, {{described by the}} orchestra's historian Richard Morrison as [...] "a sensation with players, press and public alike."

This applause, moreover, broke out just before the interval. English audiences are not as a rule inclined <b>to</b> <b>waste</b> <b>time</b> applauding at or during an interval: they usually have other things to do." [...] Monteux considered British concertgoers [...] "the most attentive in the world", and British music critics [...] "the most intelligent". However, a disadvantage of conducting a London orchestra was having to perform at the Festival Hall, of which he shared with Beecham and other conductors an intense dislike: [...] "from the conductor's rostrum it is impossible to hear the violins".|$|E
500|$|Hassett’s {{winning run}} looked {{at an end}} when Australia was exposed to a sticky wicket in the Third Test. The hosts had reached 2/240 {{at the end of}} the first day before rain hit and made the pitch {{extremely}} difficult for batting. The next day, Hassett had <b>to</b> <b>waste</b> <b>time</b> to keep South Africa batting on the poor surface so that Australia’s batsmen would not be exposed to the worst conditions. He then told his bowlers to perform badly so that the hosts would not realise how difficult the pitch was and declare so that Australia would have to face the sticky wicket. Despite Hassett’s subterfuge, the pitch was so poor that South Africa fell to be 311 all out, but Australia had gained extra time. The tourists made only 75, but then dismissed the hosts for 99, Hassett using defensive tactics to slow the scoring and keep South Africa batting as the pitch slowly improved. Australia chased down the target of 336 with five wickets in hand to secure a highly unlikely win. The local newspaper, The Natal Mercury said that [...] "Renowned for their fighting qualities as a cricketers, the occasion brought the best out of the Australians ... That indomitable spirit to win through, no matter what the circumstances may be, was in most marked evidence." ...|$|E

500|$|Raiden's role in Metal Gear Solid 2 {{has been}} {{analyzed}} by several writers, who emphasized {{how he is}} intended to represent the actual player. Early in the game, when Raiden's virtual reality training is mentioned, the game shows scenes from the previous game Metal Gear Solid where the players took control of Solid Snake. Raiden's interaction with veteran Solid Snake identify the former as [...] "a Metal Gear fan". As the game progresses it is stated that Raiden [...] "has become Snake", having developed skills similar to his from {{taking part in the}} Big Shell's fights which resembled the Metal Gear Solids Shadow Moses Island. Later in the game, Raiden is told by a character to [...] "Turn off the console" [...] which confuses both the player and him. While this was first interpreted as a fourth wall-breaking joke, the game's climax goes deeper into Raiden's connection with the player. When being forced by his superiors to kill the game's antagonist, Solidus Snake, the player is told by the designers to finish the game. Both player and Raiden take different paths at the game's end. The former is told not <b>to</b> <b>waste</b> <b>time</b> playing games; the latter's character is expanded with his decision to move on with his life, rejecting his previous identity by discarding the dog tags the player wore in the beginning.|$|E
500|$|In {{response}} to Barber's letter, Preston wrote to Saint-Gaudens, [...] "there are no presses anywhere, in mints or in use among silversmiths, which can bring up your proposed relief {{at a single}} stroke."

[...] At that time, the Mint was intensely busy generating designs for new coinage for Cuba and the Philippines, and Barber was reluctant <b>to</b> <b>waste</b> <b>time</b> on what he considered an experimental piece which would never be coined for circulation. [...] Experimental dies were made from the plaster model. [...] Approximately 24pieces were struck as patterns; even though the Mint used a medal press, set for maximum pressure, it still took up to nine strokes of the press to fully bring out the design. [...] These patterns are today known as the [...] "Ultra High Relief" [...] or [...] "Extra High Relief" [...] pieces, and only about 20 are known—one sold in a 2005 auction for $2,990,000. [...] On , 1907, the President wrote Saint-Gaudens, [...] "It has proved hitherto impossible to strike them by one blow, which is necessary under the conditions of making coins of the present day."

500|$|Red foxes either {{establish}} stable home ranges within particular {{areas or}} are itinerant with no fixed abode. [...] They use their urine to mark their territories. A male fox raises one hind leg and his urine is sprayed forward {{in front of}} him, whereas a female fox squats down so that the urine is sprayed in the ground between the hind legs. Urine {{is also used to}} mark empty cache sites, used to store found food, as reminders not <b>to</b> <b>waste</b> <b>time</b> investigating them. [...] The use of up to 12 different urination postures allows them to precisely control the position of the scent mark. Red foxes live in family groups sharing a joint territory. In favourable habitats and/or areas with low hunting pressure, subordinate foxes may be present in a range. Subordinate foxes may number one or two, sometimes up to eight in one territory. These subordinates could be formerly dominant animals, but are mostly young from the previous year, who act as helpers in rearing the breeding vixen's kits. Alternatively, their presence has been explained as being in response to temporary surpluses of food unrelated to assisting reproductive success. Non-breeding vixens will guard, play, groom, provision and retrieve kits, an example of kin selection. Red foxes may leave their families once they reach adulthood if the chances of winning a territory of their own are high. If not, they will stay with their parents, at the cost of postponing their own reproduction.|$|E

500|$|In particular, the console's {{status as}} an add-on and poor timing after the {{announcement}} of the Saturn has been identified by reviewers as being responsible factors for fracturing the audience for Sega's video game consoles in terms of both developers and consumers. [...] Allgame notes that [...] "very add-on whittled away at the number of potential buyers and discouraged third-party companies from making the games necessary to boost sales." [...] GamePro criticized the concept of the add-on, noting the expenses involved in purchasing the system. [...] According to reviewer Blake Snow, [...] "Just how many 16-bit attachments did one need? All in all, if {{you were one of the}} unlucky souls who completely bought into Sega's add-on frenzy, you would have spent a whopping $650 for something that weighed about as much as a small dog." [...] Writing for GamesRadar, Reparaz noted that [...] "developers—not wanting <b>to</b> <b>waste</b> <b>time</b> on a technological dead-end—abandoned the 32X in droves. Gamers quickly followed suit, turning what was once a promising idea into an embarrassing footnote in console history, as well as an object lesson in why console makers shouldn't split their user base with pricey add-ons." [...] Reparaz went on to criticize Sega's decision to release the 32X, noting that [...] "(u)ltimately, the 32X was the product of boneheaded short-sightedness: its existence put Sega into competition with itself once the Saturn rolled out." [...] Writing for IGN, Buchanan also notes that [...] "Notice that we haven't seen many add-ons like the 32X since 1994? I think the 32X killed the idea of an add-on like this—a power booster—permanently. And that's a good thing. Because add-ons, if not implemented properly, just splinter an audience." ...|$|E
500|$|The Chancery and {{its growing}} powers soon {{came to be}} resented by Parliament and the nobility; Carne {{says that it is}} {{possible}} to trace a general [...] "trend of opposition" [...] during the Plantagenet period, particularly from members of the clergy, who were more used to Roman law than equity. From the reign of Richard II, the House of Commons regularly complained about the work of the Court, and in 1390 it petitioned the King to pronounce that the Court could not act contrary to the common law, nor annul a judgement without due process. At the same time, it asked that no writ could be issued that would compel a man to appear before the Court; if it was, the clerk who issued it would lose his job and the Lord Chancellor would be fined £100. The King gave evasive answers to the requests, and made no decision. The Commons did succeed in making some changes to the Court's procedure, however; in 1394 the King assented to their request that victorious defendants in the Court have their costs recompensed from the other side, and in 1341 the King, on their application, allowed the Lord Chancellor to send cases directly to the common law courts, to avoid the common law judges having <b>to</b> <b>waste</b> <b>time</b> travelling. Kerly suggests that many complaints from the Commons came from lawyers of the common law, aggrieved at the Chancery's extended jurisdiction that overlapped with that of the common law. These complaints from the Commons did not prevent the Court from successfully functioning; in 1393, for example, it was considered prominent enough that the House of Lords sent two cases there to be dealt with.|$|E
