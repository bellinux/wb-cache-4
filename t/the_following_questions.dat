2500|$|In {{order to}} conduct this study, the {{pharmaceuticals}} were grouped by their therapeutic action {{in order to}} help participants identify them. [...] The eight therapeutic groups are listed below: antibacterials, antidepressants, antihistamines, antiepileptics, hormone treatments, and lipid regulators. [...] Next, a survey was created to examine the disposal patterns of the participants and their perception of the existing risk or threat against the environment. [...] Respondents were asked <b>the</b> <b>following</b> <b>questions</b> in part one of the survey: 1. When and how they disposed of pharmaceuticals. 2. How they perceive the risk to the environment posed by pharmaceuticals. 3. To differentiate between the risks associated with different classed of pharmaceuticals. [...] Part two of the survey involved each of the eight pharmaceutical groups described above individually. Finally, the third part asked information about the age, sex, profession, postcode, and education of participants. [...] The sample size of participants was precise in comparison to the actual distribution of males and females in the UK: Sample- 54.8 percent were female and 45.2 percent male vs. Actual- the UK of 51.3 percent female to 48.7 percent male. [...] Results showed that when a medication must be discarded, 63.2 percent of participants throw them in a bin, 21.8 percent return them to a pharmacist, and 11.5 percent dispose of them via the toilet/sink, while the remaining 3.5 percent keep them. [...] Only half of the respondents felt like pharmaceuticals could potentially be harmful to the environment. [...] Upon examination of factors relevant to risk perception, there was no definite link found between perception and education or income.|$|E
2500|$|After the USA PATRIOT Act {{was passed}} it {{remained}} controversial, {{and began to}} be questioned by some members of Congress. On June 13, 2002 the House Committee on the Judiciary {{wrote a letter to}} Attorney General Ashcroft asking 50 questions about the use and effectiveness of the Act. In the letter they stated that [...] "he Committee is interested in hearing from you [...] and FBI Director Robert F. Mueller concerning the Department of Justice’s use of [...] and their effectiveness. In light of the broad scope of the Act, we are initially seeking written responses to <b>the</b> <b>following</b> <b>questions,</b> and we plan to schedule a hearing in the near future to allow further public discussion of these and other issues relating to the Department of Justice’s activity in investigating terrorists or potential terrorist attacks." [...] Only 28 questions were answered publicly, with 7 answered under separate cover to the Committee. Meanwhile, organisations such as the ACLU, the EFF and EPIC had not stopped opposing the most controversial parts of the Act. Three months after the official response to the Select Committee on the Judiciary, EPIC filed a Freedom of Information (FOI) request seeking the information that was not released by the U.S. Department of Justice. While the Department of Justice released a number of records in response to the request, they didn't release all the material, asserting that certain responsive records were exempt from disclosure. In order to gain access to these records, the ACLU and EPIC brought a civil action against the Department of Justice, and on November 26 U.S. District Judge Ellen Segal Huvelle ordered the Department of Justice to complete its processing of the FOI request by January 15, 2003.|$|E

60|$|These {{preliminaries}} settled {{to their}} mutual satisfaction, {{the two girls}} began to discourse of their several hopes and projects. Hetty made her new friend more fully acquainted with her intentions in behalf of her father, and, to one in the least addicted to prying into the affairs, Hist would have betrayed her own feelings and expectations {{in connection with the}} young warrior of her own tribe. Enough was revealed on both sides, however, to let each party get a tolerable insight into the views of the other, though enough still remained in mental reservation, to give rise to <b>the</b> <b>following</b> <b>questions</b> and answers, with which the interview in effect closed. As the quickest witted, Hist was the first with her interrogatories. Folding an arm about the waist of Hetty, she bent her head so as to look up playfully into the face of the other, and, laughing, as if her meaning were to be extracted from her looks, she spoke more plainly.|$|E
6000|$|Lamenting, as I do, {{that the}} matter {{has not had}} so full and free a {{discussion}} as it requires, I mean to omit none of the points which seem to me necessary for consideration, previous to an arrangement which is forever to decide the form {{and the fate of}} Europe. In the course, therefore, of what I shall have the honor to address to you, I propose <b>the</b> <b>following</b> <b>questions</b> to your serious thoughts.--1. Whether the present system, which stands for a government, in France, be such as in peace and war affects the neighboring states in a manner different from the internal government that formerly prevailed in that country?--2. Whether that system, supposing its views hostile to other nations, possesses any means of being hurtful to them peculiar to itself?--3. Whether there has been lately such a change in France as to alter the nature of its system, or its effect upon other powers?--4. Whether any public declarations or engagements exist, {{on the part of the}} allied powers, which stand in the way of a treaty of peace which supposes the right and confirms the power of the Regicide faction in France?--5. What the state of the other powers of Europe will be with respect to each other and their colonies, on the conclusion of a Regicide peace?--6. Whether we are driven to the absolute necessity of making that kind of peace? ...|$|E
