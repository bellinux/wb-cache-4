500|$|The {{open-ended}} {{nature of}} the lyrics has led to many interpretations. Journalist Michael Campbell believed the lyrics send [...] "a message of hope" [...] and wish for a [...] "world that is not divided by class, wealth, race, or any other arbitrary criterion". With regard to the place Bono was referring to in the song, he said, [...] "I'm not sure, really, about that. I used {{to think it was}} Belfast..." [...] Journalist Niall Stokes believes the title was influenced by Bono's and his wife Ali's visit to Ethiopia as volunteer aid-workers. Bono has expressed mixed opinions about the open-ended lyrics: [...] "I can look at it now and recognize that [...] {{has one of the most}} banal couplets in the history of pop music. But it also contains some of the biggest ideas. In a curious way, that seems to work. If you get any way heavy about these things, you don't communicate. But if you're flip or throwaway about it, <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>do.</b> That's one of the paradoxes I've come to terms with." ...|$|E
500|$|Rihanna {{explains}} {{what they do}} {{when they get to}} a city: [...] "Sometimes we get to the city that morning. We sometimes come straight to the venue. We pull up, everybody comes out, you shower, <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> your sound check. Then it's time to get ready. Hair, makeup, that's the fun part." [...] Rihanna then shows her dressing room, makeup artists and costumes. She explains how she loves wearing black on stage because she is [...] "good girl gone bad and black is kind of gothic and rock n' roll". Rihanna explains how she is nervous before the beginning of the show because of the atmosphere where all of her fans are screaming her name. According to her, the beginning of the show is up-tempo and loud, before becoming a little bit [...] "mellow" [...] at the middle of it. The show then gets [...] "on party" [...] again with their techno club set-list. The encore consists of [...] "Question Existing" [...] and [...] "Umbrella". According to Rihanna, [...] "Question Existing" [...] is a very personal song which American singer Ne-Yo wrote [...] "on behalf of entertainers". She concluded that it is very hard for her to call herself a superstar. The Documentary Feature ends with Rihanna announcing that in the end of 2008 she will be hitting the studio again and [...] "she won't be away for too long".|$|E
2500|$|On March 10, 2004 Lindner {{complained that}} critics of his remarks were not {{focusing}} on the real motives of his bill and his speech. He said [...] "that homosexuality, the rise in sexually transmitted diseases, and comprehensive sexual health education could prompt a future 'holocaust' in Minnesota". On the House floor he said, [...] "hat I am trying to prevent is the holocaust of our children getting STDs, AIDS, and various other diseases {{that are going to}} affect their lives. If you want to sit around here and wait until America becomes another African continent, well, <b>then,</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> that, but I'm {{going to do something about}} it." [...] Whatever his intentions, Lindner’s new remarks only managed to offend more Jews and Gays, while upsetting many African-Americans within Minnesota.|$|E
