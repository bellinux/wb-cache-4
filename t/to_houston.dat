5|$|Once {{construction}} on Phase 2 of the Second Avenue Subway, which runs from 105th Street to 125th Street and Lexington Avenue, is completed, {{it is expected}} that construction will then take place on Phase 3.

The line would continue down Second Avenue <b>to</b> <b>Houston</b> Street, where the third phase would end. However, no funding has been committed to this phase.
