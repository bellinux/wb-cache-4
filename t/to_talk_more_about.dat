Elaine then reveals that she has recently met a man using a stake out.|$|E
5|$|Otjes's {{approach}} is more empirical {{than that of}} many contributors to Political Animals and Animal Politics. He examines the Dutch Party for the Animals (PvdD), which, in 2006, won two seats in the House of Representatives. Otjes explores whether the PvdD's presence has changed {{the amount of time}} more established parties spent on animal issues by examining both parliamentary speeches and motions before and after the introduction of the PvdD members. He finds that established parties began <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> animal issues in 2006, and that this could be attributed to conflict between the PvdD and the established parties. Though Otjes allows that his study's relevance may seem limited, he concludes that smaller parties can affect government agenda by remaining focused on their own primary concern.|$|E
500|$|In 1999, when Aronofsky turned 30 years old, {{his parents}} were {{diagnosed}} with cancer. He began reflecting on human mortality, [...] "That was a really heavy-duty emotional time. I know it's a very young age, but turning thirty marks when your twenties are over and you could start considering, 'Wow, {{one of these days}} I'm actually going to die.'" [...] While his parents overcame cancer, he began to focus on the concept of a young man saving a loved one from a life-threatening disease. He shared the concept with Handel, his undergraduate school roommate at Harvard University. Handel earned a Ph.D in neuroscience from New York University but was uncertain about a future in neuroscience. He recalled the discussion, [...] "Darren and I just started talking about the story. We kept wanting <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> it as the story kept getting bigger. I decided to make some life choices to continue working with Darren, because it was so much fun." ...|$|E

Contestants were asked to cook one sausage and one egg whilst answering {{a series of questions}} about themselves and why they {{wanted to be part of}} the show. A second part of the process was a screen test where they had <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> what they would do if they had their own show and deliver a tagline or marketing slogan that summarises their personality and character.|$|E

60|$|At length {{the curious}} mood changed, but I did not venture <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> any <b>more</b> <b>about</b> music, and before very long we {{repaired}} to the eating-room, where, {{for the next}} two or three hours, we occupied ourselves very agreeably with those processes which, some new theorist informs us, constitute our chief pleasure in life.|$|R

60|$|Whatever talent or genius the Pomeranian artist might possess, it {{certainly}} failed to receive commercial sanction. The portfolio remained bulky with unsold sketches, and the “Euston Siesta,” as the wits of the Nuremberg nicknamed the large canvas, {{was still in}} the market. The outward and visible signs of financial embarrassment began to be noticeable; the half-bottle of cheap claret at dinner-time gave way to a small glass of lager, and this in turn was displaced by water. The one-and-sixpenny set dinner receded from an everyday event to a Sunday extravagance; on ordinary days the artist contented himself with a sevenpenny omelette and some bread and cheese, and there were evenings when he did not put in an appearance at all. On the rare occasions when he spoke of his own affairs it was observed that he began <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> Pomerania and less about the great world of art.|$|E
25|$|If Agnes is the fulcrum, then Tobias is {{the energy}} behind the fulcrum that works at keeping a balance in this {{dysfunctional}} family. He is constantly asking people <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>more</b> kindly <b>about</b> one another. Or, in the least, it is Tobias who keeps silent while fury flares around him. It is also Tobias who serves everyone drinks, {{as if trying}} to soften the edges of their grievances with alcohol.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} {{nothing of the}} sort," [...] she answered. [...] "Of course, the last week has been a strain, {{but we are not}} going <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> any <b>more</b> <b>about</b> that.

60|$|Beaton {{scarcely}} {{understood it}} himself, {{perhaps because he}} was not yet twenty-seven. He only knew that his will was somehow sick; that it spent itself in caprices, and brought him no happiness from the fulfilment of the most vehement wish. But he was aware that his wishes grew less and less vehement; he began to have a fear that some time he might have none at all. It seemed to him that if he could once do something that was thoroughly distasteful to himself, he might make a beginning in the right direction; but when he tried this on a small scale, it failed, and it seemed stupid. Some sort of expiation was the thing he needed, he was sure; but he could not think of anything in particular to expiate; a man could not expiate his temperament, and his temperament was what Beaton decided to be at fault. He perceived that it went deeper than even fate would have gone; he could have fulfilled an evil destiny and had done with it, however terrible. His trouble was that he could not escape from himself; and, for the most part, he justified himself in refusing to try. After he had come to that distinct understanding with Alma Leighton, and experienced the relief it really gave him, he thought for a while that if it had fallen out otherwise, and she had put him in charge of her destiny, he might have been better able to manage his own. But as it was, he could only drift, and let all other things take their course. It was necessary that he should go to see her afterward, to show her that he was equal to the event; but he did not go so often, and he went rather oftener to the Dryfooses; it was not easy to see Margaret Vance, except on the society terms. With much sneering and scorning, he fulfilled the duties to Mrs. Horn without which he knew he should be dropped from her list; but one might go to many of her Thursdays without getting many words with her niece. Beaton hardly knew whether he wanted many; the girl kept the charm of her innocent stylishness; but latterly she wanted <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> social questions than about the psychical problems that young people usually debate so personally. Son of the working-people as he was, Beaton had never cared anything about such matters; he did not know about them or wish to know; he was perhaps too near them. Besides, there was an embarrassment, at least on her part, concerning the Dryfooses. She was too high-minded to blame him for having tempted her to her failure with them by his talk about them; but she was conscious of avoiding them in her talk. She had decided not to renew the effort she had made in the spring; because she could not do them good as fellow-creatures needing food and warmth and work, and she would not try to befriend them socially; she had a horror of any such futile sentimentality. She would have liked to account to Beaton in this way for a course which she suspected he must have heard their comments upon, but she did not quite know how to do it; she could not be sure how much or how little he cared for them. Some tentative approaches which she made toward explanation were met with such eager disclaim of personal interest that she knew less than before what to think; and she turned the talk from the sisters to the brother, whom it seemed she still continued to meet in their common work among the poor.|$|E
5000|$|The term [...] "cone of silence" [...] {{was used}} in one episode of Everybody Loves Raymond (Boy's Therapy), by Frank Barone (Peter Boyle), after his wife Marie (Doris Roberts) said that she couldn't wait <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> his therapy session that he just got back from, Frank {{told her that he}} needed a [...] "cone of silence" [...] {{whenever}} he felt bad Frank coming on.|$|E
50|$|In 2009, Grunberg {{launched}} Talk About It, {{a website}} dedicated to epilepsy education and awareness, featuring many of Greg's co-stars and celebrity friends, including Garner, Larter, Pasdar, Ramamurthy, Ventimiglia, Panettiere, {{as well as}} Zachary Quinto, Chris Pine, Dr. Drew Pinsky, Ron Rifkin, and John Mayer.

50|$|The groups {{then decided}} to hold an {{in-person}} retreat <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>more</b> in-depth <b>about</b> what an alliance could do. Thanks to the Restaurant Opportunities Centers United, which raised funds from the Ford Foundation, nine organizations came together in Chicago in July 2009 to officially create the Food Chain Workers Alliance. In addition to the groups listed above, Just Harvest USA, the Restaurant Opportunities Center of New York, and the United Food and Commercial Workers Local 1500 also participated. NWAWJC could not attend but afterwards confirmed their membership in the Alliance.|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{have reason}} to be patriotic," [...] she said, [...] "or rather, we had," [...] she added, with a curious note of sadness in her tone. [...] "But, come, I do not desire <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about my country.

50|$|The second {{approach}} {{focuses on}} content, examining maternal speech {{for the specific}} subject matter introduced to the conversation. The content approach has been primarily used to investigate gendered patterns in maternal speech {{as they relate to}} children’s speech. For example, Fivush and colleagues observed that mothers talked more about emotions with girls than boys, especially when those conversations concerned experiences of sadness. Other research has shown {{that by the end of}} preschool, girls tend <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> emotions, and sadness in particular, when compared to boys.|$|E

50|$|After the war, Nina's {{mother and}} sisters {{returned}} to Moscow {{and found her}} diary tucked away in their apartment. They kept it safe and later gave it to Alexei for safe-keeping once {{he was released from}} Stalin's prisons in 1955. The diary stayed private until 1962, when the family allowed a Soviet magazine to publish it. This was possible only because the new Soviet leader, Nikita Khrushchev, began allowing citizens <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>more</b> openly <b>about</b> their experiences during the Stalin years. Many journals, diaries and memoirs started to emerge. Two years later, Nina's diary was released in Russian book form. Then, in 1968, it was released in English by American publisher, Crown Books. It became a bestseller.|$|R
40|$|This {{longitudinal}} {{study examined the}} reciprocal effects of the frequency of parent-adolescent communication on tobacco-related issues (smoking-specific communication), and adolescents' smoking. Participants were 428 Dutch older and younger siblings between 13 and 16 years old. Smoking-specific communication did not affect youth smoking in general; however, among younger, but not older, siblings, smoking-specific communication {{was associated with a}} higher likelihood of smoking over time. In addition, when adolescents already smoked parents started <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>more</b> frequently <b>about</b> smoking-related issues with their older and younger adolescents later on. Neither the quality of smoking-specific communication, the quality of parent-adolescent relationship, nor parental smoking moderated these reciprocal effects. In conclusion, prevention campaigns encouraging parents to undertake smoking-specific communication might not be desirable...|$|R
