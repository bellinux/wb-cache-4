5|$|Atomic {{exchange}} involves {{exchange between}} an adatom and an adjacent atom within the surface lattice. As {{shown in figure}} 4, after an atomic exchange event the adatom has taken {{the place of a}} surface atom and the surface atom has been displaced and has now become an adatom. This process may take place in both heterodiffusion (e.g. Pt adatoms on Ni) and self-diffusion (e.g. Pt adatoms on Pt). It is still unclear from a theoretical point of view why the atomic exchange mechanism is more predominant in some systems than in others. Current theory points towards multiple possibilities, including tensile surface stresses, surface relaxation about the adatom, and increased stability of the intermediate {{due to the fact that}} both atoms involved maintain high levels of coordination <b>throughout</b> <b>the</b> <b>process.</b>|$|E
40|$|The spatial {{distribution}} of ion channels within amacrine cells of the tiger salamander retina was studied using patch recording in the retinal slice preparation. By focally puffing kainate, GABA and glycine at amacrine cell <b>processes</b> in <b>the</b> inner plexiform layer, {{it was determined that}} the cell's glutamate receptors were located in a confined region of <b>the</b> <b>processes</b> near <b>the</b> soma, while glycine and GABA receptors were located <b>throughout</b> <b>the</b> <b>processes.</b> Likewise, similar techniques in conjunction with voltage steps demonstrated that voltage-gated sodium channels were located <b>throughout</b> <b>the</b> cell and were shown to generate sodium-dependent spikes, while only <b>the</b> <b>processes</b> contained voltage-gated calcium channels. These results suggest that this form of transient amacrine cell collects its excitatory synaptic inputs in a region confined to a central annular region near the soma, that the signal is actively propagated throughout its processes by voltage-gated sodium channels and that calcium-dependent neurotransmitter release of glycine from this neuron can occur throughout its processes. Thus, excitatory signals are collected in <b>the</b> <b>processes</b> near <b>the</b> soma, inhibitory signals <b>throughout</b> <b>the</b> <b>processes</b> and excitation is probably propagated <b>throughout</b> <b>the</b> <b>processes</b> of <b>the</b> amacrine cell...|$|R
