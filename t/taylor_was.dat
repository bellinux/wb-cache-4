Lawrence <b>Taylor</b> <b>was</b> the standard bearer, and set a single–season team record with 20.5 sacks. In addition to winning an unprecedented third Defensive Player of the Year Award, <b>Taylor</b> <b>was</b> named NFL MVP by the Associated Press, becoming only the second defensive player to win the award.|$|E
5|$|Anthony <b>Taylor</b> <b>was</b> {{the referee}} for the final.

5|$|As {{it had in}} {{the third}} quarter, Stanford's offense scored quickly. In only three plays, the Cardinal {{advanced}} 72yards. A 34-yard run by Stepfan <b>Taylor</b> <b>was</b> followed by one stopped for no gain, then Luck completed a 38-yard throw to Fleener for Stanford's second touchdown of the quarter. The score and extra point improved Stanford's lead to 40–12 with 6:05 remaining in the game. Tech's subsequent drive went three-and-out after Tyrod <b>Taylor</b> <b>was</b> sacked twice, and Stanford got the ball again at its 46-yard line.|$|E
5|$|Captain Cliff Taylor and Acting First Officer John Hutchinson {{had managed}} to safely land their {{aircraft}} which, having lost an engine, was on fire carrying about 22,000 gallons of fuel, in the most testing of circumstances and almost certainly saved 121 lives. <b>Taylor</b> <b>was</b> recommended for an award by BOAC, but following {{the publication of the}} official inquiry report in August 1969, the decision was taken at ministerial level not to recognise any member of the flight crew. Both Taylor and Hutchinson received, along with First Officer Francis Kirkland and Check Captain Geoffrey Moss, but not Flight Engineer Thomas Hicks, commendations from BOAC, and Captain <b>Taylor</b> <b>was</b> awarded the British Airline Pilots Association Gold Medal.|$|E

5|$|Taylor rebounded in {{the early}} stages of what many thought would be his final season in 1992. Through close to nine games <b>Taylor</b> <b>was</b> on pace for 10 sacks and the Giants were 5–4. However, a {{ruptured}} Achilles tendon suffered in a game on November 8, 1992 against Green Bay sidelined him for the final seven games, during which the team went 1–6. Before the injury Taylor had missed only four games due to injury in his 12-year career. Throughout the 1992 season, and the ensuing offseason, <b>Taylor</b> <b>was</b> noncommittal about his future, alternately saying he might retire, then later hinting he wanted a longer-term contract.|$|E

5|$|A poorly educated but {{politically}} astute lawyer, Taylor began {{climbing the}} political ladder by holding local offices {{in his native}} Butler County. Though he was a Republican in an overwhelmingly Democratic state, divisions in the majority party resulted in his election as Attorney General of Kentucky on a ticket with the Commonwealth's first Republican governor, William O. Bradley. Four years later, <b>Taylor</b> <b>was</b> elected in 1899 to the governorship.|$|E

5|$|After the World Cup, <b>Taylor</b> <b>was</b> disheartened by {{both her}} own, and England's, lack of success. She bemoaned that the sacrifices {{she had made}} had come to nothing, and after talking to psychologists, she {{realised}} {{that she needed to}} readdress her work–life balance. An amateur violinist, she was accepted into the Reading Orchestra, and by early 2006 was working out of the University of Reading as a performance management consultant.|$|E

5|$|Although Taylor {{recorded}} nine {{sacks and}} made the All-Pro team {{for the third consecutive}} season in 1983, the Giants struggled. The team went 3–12–1, and Parcells received heavy criticism from fans and the media. <b>Taylor</b> <b>was</b> forced to play inside linebacker for part of the season, a position which allowed him less pass rushing opportunities, when Carson was injured. Frustrated by the losing, Taylor began acting out by arriving late for meetings, and not participating in conditioning drills in practice. After the season, <b>Taylor</b> <b>was</b> involved in a fight for his services between the Giants and the New Jersey Generals of the United States Football League. <b>Taylor</b> <b>was</b> given a $1 million interest-free, 25-year loan by Generals owner Donald Trump on December 14, 1983, with the provision that he begin playing in the USFL in 1988. Taylor regretted the decision, and less than a month later attempted to renege. His agent was able to negotiate by meeting with Trump personally and then the Giants which resulted in allowing Taylor to go with the Giants. Taylor got a 6-year $6.55-million package that also included a $1 million interest-free loan. The main results of these negotiations were threefold: 1) Taylor returned the $1 million to Trump, 2) the Giants paid Trump $750,000 over the next five seasons, and 3) the Giants gave Taylor a new six-year, $6.2-million-dollar contract.|$|E
5|$|As Bradley's term {{drew to a}} close, {{potential}} Republican {{candidates to}} succeed him were initially few. Some saw Kentucky's 18,000-vote plurality for William Jennings Bryan in the 1896 presidential election as {{a sure sign that}} the state would vote Democratic in 1899. Others were not interested in being on the defensive against the inevitable Democratic attacks on Bradley's administration. Still others were intimidated by the prospect of being defeated by the machinery of the Goebel Election Law. Sitting attorney general William S. <b>Taylor</b> <b>was</b> the first to announce his candidacy and soon secured the support of Senator Deboe. Later candidates included Hopkins County judge Clifton J. Pratt and sitting state auditor Sam H. Stone. The former was Bradley's choice, but <b>Taylor</b> <b>was</b> a skilled political organizer and was able to create a strong political machine amongst the county delegations. He seemed the favorite to win the nomination.|$|E
5|$|Depressed by {{his lack}} of {{widespread}} appreciation and suffering from writer's block, Ochs did not record any further albums. He slipped deeper into depression and alcoholism. His personal problems notwithstanding, Ochs performed at the inaugural benefit for Greenpeace on October 16, 1970, at the Pacific Coliseum in Vancouver, BC. A recording of his performance, along with performances by Joni Mitchell and James <b>Taylor,</b> <b>was</b> released by Greenpeace in 2009.|$|E

5|$|During the campaign, <b>Taylor</b> <b>was</b> {{attacked}} by Democratic opponents {{because of his}} party's support from black voters and its ties to big business, including the Louisville and Nashville Railroad. They also charged that Governor Bradley had run a corrupt administration. Republicans answered with charges of factionalism and use of political machinery by Democrats. In particular, they derided the Goebel Election Law, which Taylor claimed subverted {{the will of the}} people.|$|E
5|$|Florida State {{kicked off}} {{following}} the score, and Tech's offense began work from its 18-yard line. Though quarterback <b>Taylor</b> <b>was</b> sacked {{on the first}} play of the drive, the Hokies recovered the lost yardage and gained a first down with the final play of the quarter. With one quarter remaining in the game, Tech held a 35–24 lead.|$|E
5|$|Hull {{began the}} 2002–03 {{season with a}} number of defeats, which saw relegation look more likely than promotion, and Mølby was sacked in October as Hull languished fifth from bottom in the league.
