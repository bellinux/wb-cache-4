2500|$|A mock station, named Beacon Hill, was {{installed}} in late 2010 at Beacon Hill School in Wallsend, North Tyneside. It features a building painted like a Metro train, with working passenger doors, standing at a recreated station building, which features a lifelike ticket hall with working ticket machines, a recreated platform area with <b>tactile</b> <b>paving,</b> authentic passenger seating, yellow litter bins and railings and an illuminated Metro [...] "cube" [...] outside. The 'station' {{was installed}} at the school in association with Nexus to assist with teaching local children how to travel by Metro, encouraging safe independent travel.|$|E
2500|$|The {{final design}} was then {{submitted}} to the National Capital Planning Commission on June 24, 2010. By this time, the southernmost glass wall had been eliminated to provide for better east-west pedestrian flow through the site (leaving the memorial with just three glass panels). The placement of the remaining glass walls was adjusted, {{and the number of}} glass panels reduced from 70 to 49. Per the request of the Commission of Fine Arts, the height of the [...] "Wall of Gratitude" [...] was reduced from [...] to [...] At the request of the National Park Service, this wall was now composed of granite, which was more durable than marble. The American elms planned for Washington Avenue were replaced with gingko, and the pole-mounted lights and ground-level lighting for the glass panels eliminated. Small LED lights were added to the top and back of each glass panel, and LED lights were used to underlight each granite bench. Accessibility elements for special-needs individuals were also incorporated into the submitted final design. All crosswalks now had <b>tactile</b> <b>paving</b> and audible crosswalk signals. Seating height within the memorial was adjusted to be more accessible to the physically impaired, and the memorial planners had reached an agreement with the Architect of the Capitol to provide special needs parking south of the memorial site. To assist those who were visually impaired, the memorial now also provided an audio tour, accessed for free via cell phone, which described the memorial's art and components and provided an interpretive description of them.|$|E

5000|$|The Department of Transport {{guidance}} on the installation {{and use of}} <b>tactile</b> <b>paving</b> places a heavy emphasis {{on the role of}} contrast. The guidance repeatedly states that <b>tactile</b> <b>paving</b> should be chosen to provide strong color contrast with the surrounding paving material as studies have shown that this aids partially sighted individuals. Most <b>tactile</b> <b>paving</b> is available in a range of colors and materials making good color contrast easy to achieve with appropriate choice of tactile paving.There are only two cases where the color of a tactile has a specific meaning: ...|$|E

50|$|In the {{metropolitan}} cities of Mumbai and Delhi, warning and directional blocks, resembling those in Japan, have been installed in sidewalks leading to, and inside metro stations. Delhi Metro {{is the most}} accessible public transport infrastructure in the country. It has <b>tactile</b> <b>paving</b> from entry to exit. Such tiles can also be located on pavements near shopping plazas, and particularly around the Delhi University campus. These tiles come in yellow. Although, the tiles within the metro stations are continually cared-for, the maintenance of those set over the sidewalks is generally neglected. The Jawaharlal Nehru University, Delhi also has <b>tactile</b> <b>paving</b> on its walkways.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} <b>tactile</b> <b>paving</b> {{was developed}} by Seiichi Miyake in 1965. The paving was first introduced in a street in Okayama city, Japan, in 1967. Its use gradually spread in Japan and then around the world.|$|E

50|$|<b>Tactile</b> <b>paving</b> (also called {{truncated}} domes, detectable warnings, Tactile Ground Surface Indicators, detectable warning surfaces) is {{a system}} of textured ground surface indicator found on footpaths, stairs and train station platforms to assist pedestrians who are visually impaired.|$|E
50|$|According to {{the census}} data, 7.1% of people walk to work (more {{than twice the}} Ballarat average). Pedestrian {{facilities}} include a network of footpaths on most streets, some such as Lydiard and Doveton Crescent being upgraded with <b>tactile</b> <b>paving</b> for disability access.|$|E
50|$|An {{important}} element of sidewalk design is accessibility for persons with disabilities. Features that make sidewalks more accessible include curb ramps, <b>tactile</b> <b>paving</b> and accessible traffic signals. The Americans with Disabilities Act requires accessibility improvement on new and reconstructed streets within the US.|$|E
50|$|Efforts {{have also}} been made to improve {{pedestrianisation}} within Pulau Tikus, such as the <b>tactile</b> <b>paving</b> of the roadside pedestrian walkways for the visually-impaired, {{and the use of}} natural or man-made barriers between the road and the pedestrian walkway to improve the safety of pedestrians.|$|E
50|$|India {{has one of}} {{the largest}} {{population}} of people with disabilities. Still the development of pedestrian walkways with <b>tactile</b> <b>paving</b> is at infancy in the country. Government of India has launched Accessible India Campaign to make the nation's infrastructure more inclusive and accessible on 2015.|$|E
50|$|The {{platforms}} {{are covered}} and accessible via lifts and stairways. The platform roofs were renewed from October 2009 to January 2011 and the platforms were fitted with <b>tactile</b> <b>paving.</b> The station building includes shops and a ticket office.

50|$|The {{station in}} its present {{location}} was constructed as part of renovations to the neighbouring Carindale shopping centre in the 1990s. Subsequent renovations to the station have included minor improvements, such as the addition of electronic passenger information displays, improved CCTV surveillance and <b>tactile</b> <b>paving</b> as well as changes to access between the bus station and the shopping centre.|$|E
50|$|The lozenge <b>tactile</b> <b>paving</b> units {{should be}} {{installed}} {{to a depth}} of 400mm parallel to the platform edge and a minimum of 500mm back from the edge. It should never be installed closer to the edge than this because pedestrians may not have sufficient time to stop walking once they have detected the tactile warning surface.|$|E
50|$|Tactile {{surfacing}} patterns (or tactile pavings) may be laid flush {{within the}} adjacent footways (US: sidewalks), so that visually impaired pedestrians can locate the control box and cone device and {{know when they}} have reached the other side. In Britain, different colours of <b>tactile</b> <b>paving</b> indicate different types of crossings; yellow (referred to as buff coloured) is used at non-controlled (no signals) crossings, and red is used at controlled (signalised) locations.|$|E
50|$|Government {{actions are}} {{sometimes}} taken {{to make public}} places more accessible to blind people. Public transportation is freely available to the blind in many cities. <b>Tactile</b> <b>paving</b> and audible traffic signals can make it easier and safer for visually impaired pedestrians to cross streets. In addition to making rules about who can and cannot use a cane, some governments mandate the right-of-way be given to users of white canes or guide dogs.|$|E
50|$|In 2006, {{work was}} {{completed}} on {{the renovation of}} the passenger building.
