50|$|A <b>Technical</b> <b>Data</b> <b>Management</b> System (TDMS) is {{essentially}} a Document management system (DMS) pertaining to the management of technical and engineering drawings and documents.

Proper Technical Document Management Systems are essential for executions within large organisations with large scale projects involving engineering. For example, TDMS is a vital function for the successful management of Integrated Steel Plants (ISP), Automobile factories, Aero-space facilities, Infrastructure companies, City Corporations, Research Organisations, etc. In such organisations, Technical Archives or Technical Documentation Centres are created as central facilities for effective management of technical data and records.TDMS functions are {{similar to that of}} conventional archive functions in concepts, except that the archived materials in this case are essentially engineering drawings, survey maps, technical specifications, plant and equipment data sheets, feasibility reports, project reports, operation and maintenance manuals, standards, etc.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn {{the current}} {{environment}} of military operations requesting short development timelines to counter insurgent tactics, the engineering team often searches {{for ways to}} deliver the “ 80 % solution”, typically in 6 - 12 months. These are labeled rapid development projects. A content analysis of best practices in commercial product development literature, where time to market is often a driving factor, was accomplished showing varying emphasis of systems engineering (SE) technical and technical management processes. This analysis confirms a preconceived notion of “plan upfront and early” by emphasizing Stakeholder Requirements Definition, Architecture Design and Technical Planning. A purposive sampling of Air Force Research Laboratory rapid development project managers and engineers was conducted to identify important SE processes and then compared to the literature content analysis. The results of this sampling did not strongly emphasize one process over another, however Architecture Design and Implementation scored higher among Technical Processes. Decision Analysis, Technical Planning, <b>Technical</b> Assessment and <b>Data</b> <b>Management</b> scored slightly higher among Technical Management Processes. Anecdotal evidence also emphasized iterating prototype designs based on early customer feedback, focusing mostly on managing critical risks and holding frequent early reviews until trust is built in the team...|$|R
40|$|INFORMATION Towards {{a process}} <b>technical</b> <b>data</b> <b>management</b> Abstract. Often, the {{development}} of Computer Aided Process Engineering (CAPE) for Manufacturing Engineering Departments (MED) leads to isolated Databases (DB) because of the past vertical orientation of system design (one database- one application). This usually caused {{a tremendous amount of}} data redundancy, heterogeneous manufacturing DB and, as a result, a configuration of manufacturing design that was far from optimal. Our objective here is to overcome those difficulties, by proposing a new Information System scheme, based on the construction of two models with interactions in two directions: the "Business Model " is a representation of business processes according to different views of the company: Function, Activity, Milestone … and at different levels of detail: Conceptual, Logical and Physical. The second one consists in modeling the trade objects (common and specific) with their mutual interactions. Eventually, this project should lead to a standardization of process specification (resource and operation stated references) with special emphasis on the data handled during the engineering stage. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} drivers, {{development}} and global deployment of intelligent water metering {{in the urban}} context. Recognising that intelligent metering (or smart metering) {{has the potential to}} revolutionise customer engagement and management of urban water by utilities, this paper provides a summary of the knowledge-base for researchers and industry practitioners to ensure that the technology fosters sustainable urban water management. To date, roll-outs of intelligent metering have been driven by the desire for increased data regarding time of use and end-use (such as use by shower, toilet, garden, etc.) {{as well as by the}} ability of the technology to reduce labour costs for meter reading. Technology development in the water sector generally lags that seen in the electricity sector. In the coming decade, the deployment of intelligent water metering will transition from being predominantly "pilot or demonstration scale" with the occasional city-wide roll-out, to broader mainstream implementation. This means that issues which have hitherto received little focus must now be addressed, namely: the role of real-time data in customer engagement and demand management; data ownership, sharing and privacy; <b>technical</b> <b>data</b> <b>management</b> and infrastructure security, utility workforce skills; and costs and benefits of implementation.

40|$|The paper {{summarizes}} {{the work and}} results of ALTER-Net {{in the field of}} information management and knowledge transfer which aimed to facilitate data sharing. Data sharing can broadly be considered through three aspects: technical, content, and legal. Within ALTER-Net the focus of information management was on the technical aspect. The proposed information management framework consists of the following components: metadata collection (LTER InfoBase), definition of a common domain model and ontology (SERONTO) and the technical concept of the data integration framework. The semantic mediation system, as important part of the data integration framework, based on existing tools was successfully tested using SERONTO as the common ontology for integration. The paper highlights the experiences of ALTER-Net in the fields of (1) the <b>technical</b> framework for <b>data</b> <b>management,</b> (2) the support and collection of metadata about the LTER infrastructure, (3) the work on anthologies as the common domain model, and (4) the proof of concept for the semantic mediation system.
