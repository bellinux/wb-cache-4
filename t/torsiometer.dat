40|$|This study {{evaluated}} a new tibial <b>torsiometer</b> that {{is universally}} applicable to all limb sizes and requires no special training, jigs, or radiographic equipment. To compare {{the reliability of}} measurements obtained with the <b>torsiometer,</b> 160 tibias were evaluated with both the <b>torsiometer</b> and computed tomography. Results for both methods were identical in 51 tibias, within 1 ° in 66 tibias, and within 2 ° in 43 tibias. The {{difference between the two}} methods was not significantly different. No significant differences were found among examiners. This device should prove to be useful for the quantification of tibial torsion...|$|E
40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were carried out}} to evaluate the "Pilodyn Wood Tester" (which operates by measuring the penetration of a steel striker pin) for non-destructive assessment of wood density in living trees. Results were compared with those from the recently developed <b>Torsiometer</b> method as regards accuracy for predicting the wood density measured from increment cores. In the first trial, 10 -year-old radiata pine clones were tested (25 clones, 5 ramets/clone, 2 measurements/ramet). The Pilodyn {{was by far the}} most rapid method and the penetration data gave a correlation coefficient of — 0. 96 with wood density on a clone mean basis. The <b>Torsiometer</b> gave a correlation of 0. 78. The second study was in a 31 -year-old radiata pine plantation where 25 stems were assessed at four breast height sampling points by the three methods used in the first trial. Again the Pilodyn results were obtained more rapidly and were more closely related to mean tree outerwood density (r = — 0. 86 as compared to 0. 79 for the <b>Torsiometer).</b> The Pilodyn Wood Tester appears to have a high potential for the rapid measurement of wood density in large numbers of stems and would be particularly useful for ranking groups of trees such as clones or families by density classes...|$|E
40|$|A seismic <b>torsiometer</b> is {{described}} {{which is based}} on the reception by a photosensitive transducer of a light flux modulated by a relative rotation of the optical axes of two polaroids. The torsional vibrations of the polaroid fixed to the shaft are transmitted to the other polaroid (which at the same time is the seismic mass of the apparatus) by means of elastic lamellas. The device can work as accelerometer, vibrometer or frequency meter, depending on the value of the ratio between the proper oscillation frequency of the seismic system and the measured vibration frequency...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of three chapters. After a brief introduction on the general aspects of polymer characterization and viscoelasticity in the first chapter, all major features of this research project are described in the following two chapters. The second chapter deals exclusively with the nonlinearly thermo-mechanical creep behavior of (bisphenol A) polycarbonate under pure shear loading at different temperatures (0 °C to 140 °C). The shear creep in the linearly viscoelastic range was measured with a <b>torsiometer</b> for reference purposes and a master curve, along with a shift factor curve, were deduced. While the master curve is well defined with no detectable deviation, the shift factor can be represented by two straight line segments interrupted at the β transition temperature of polycarbonate. The shear creep tests in the nonlinearly viscoelastic range were conducted on an Arcan specimen geometry at different temperatures and under different stress levels, utilizing digital image correlation for the recording of the creep strains. The difference between the nominal stress and the actual stress distribution in the Arcan specimen was explored via numerical simulations (ABAQUS) by assuming linear quasi-elastic and quasi-plastic analysis {{in place of the}} as yet uncertain material characterization. Isochronal plots were created from the creep data. Nonlinearly viscoelastic behavior starts to take effect near 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{aerospace}} and automotive {{industries are}} facing a significant risk for cumulative trauma disorders from high-repetition, long-duration tasks. Additional risk factors such as shocks, vibrations and sustained uncomfortable postures oftentimes contribute to musculoskeletal, neurological injuries associated with the hand-arm system. The power tools used for the operation reduce the comfort and working efficiency of the operators, thus lowering their health and safety {{and the quality of}} operation. This paper investigates the fastening operation on the assembly line of a major aerospace company for quantifying hand-arm vibrations with the objective of developing a dynamic model of the hand-arm system. The model will be used to ascertain the effect of the various risk factors {{on the quality of the}} operation. Experiment Setup A system of three tri-axial accelerometers is used to collect vibrations entering the hand-arm system and their positioning follows the ISO- 5349 standard. Reaction force during the operation is measured using a force sensor. The posture of the hand-arm system is measured using two goniometers and one <b>torsiometer.</b> The pilot study conducted has two subjects and one pistol-grip power tool. The experiment setup and positions of various sensors is depicted in Figure 1. [] Analysis Method The analysis consists of transmissibility of vibrations and frequency weighted acceleration based on the recommendations of the ISO- 5349 standard [1, 2].

40|$|Introduction: The use of {{reciprocating}} movement was claimed {{to increase the}} resistance of nickel-titanium (NiTi) file to fatigue in comparison with continuous rotation. Recently 2 new brands of NiTi files have been marketed {{for use in a}} RM mode. The {{purpose of this study was}} to compare the cyclic fatigue resistance and torsional resistance of these 2 files, Reciproc and WaveOne. Methods: Cyclic fatigue test with a simultaneous pecking motion was performed with the instrument (n = 10 each) operating in the recommended reciprocation motion until fracture for the Reciproc R 25 and WaveOne Primary files. ProTaper F 2 was tested in continuous rotation to serve as a control for comparison. The number of cycles to fracture (NCF) was determined by measuring the time to fracture. The length of the fragment was measured and the fracture surface was examined by using scanning electron microscopy. Torsional strength was measured by using a <b>torsiometer</b> after fixing the apical 5 mm of the instrument rigidly. Statistical analysis was performed by using one-way analysis of variance. Results: The results showed that Reciproc had a higher NCF and WaveOne had a higher torsional resistance than the others. Both reciprocating files demonstrated significantly higher cyclic fatigue and torsional resistances than ProTaper (P <. 05). The fractographic analysis showed typical features of cyclic fatigue and torsional failure for all instruments. Conclusions: The 2 brands of NiTi file for use with a reciprocation motion seem to have superior mechanical properties. © 2012 American Association of Endodontists. postprin...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the in vitro {{torsional}} stress characteristics of Twisted Files (SybronEndo, Orange, CA) with two milled files of similar cross section, EndoSequence (Brasseler USA, Savannah, GA) and ProFile Vortex (DENTSPLY Tulsa Dental, Tulsa, OK). Files of size 25 /. 06 and 30 /. 06 from the three file types were compared (n= 20 /group). Torsional stress resistance was evaluated by measuring the torque in gram-centimeters (g-cm) and angle of rotation (degrees) required for instrument separation with use of a <b>torsiometer</b> instrument. The fractured files were examined using SEM to look at deformation and fracture surface characteristics. The data was analyzed with ANOVA to determine statistical differences. The three file types showed a statistically significant difference in both maximum torsional stress and angle of rotation prior to failure. Twisted Files displayed the least amount of torsional stress resistance and the highest angle of rotation. The 30 /. 06 size files of all three types withstood more torsional stress than the size 25 / 06 files of the same type. Within each file design, there was not a statistically significant difference in angular rotation between the 25 /. 06 and 30 /. 06 groups. The SEM analysis of all three file types revealed dimpling near the center of rotation on the fractured surface indicative of torsional stress. The novel techniques used in manufacturing Twisted Files do not make them more resistant to torsional stress as compared with milled nickel-titanium endodontic files of similar cross-sectional design...|$|E
40|$|Wrist-hand orthoses (WHOs) are {{commonly}} prescribed {{to manage the}} functional deficit associated with the wrist {{as a result of}} rheumatoid changes. The common presentation of the wrist is one of flexion and radial deviation with ulnar deviation of the fingers. This wrist position Results in altered biomechanics compromising hand function during activities of daily living (ADL). A paucity of evidence exists which suggests that improvements in ADL with WHO use are very task specific. Using normal subjects, and thus in the absence of pain as a limiting factor, the impact of ten WHOs on performing five ADLs tasks was investigated. The tasks were selected to represent common grip patterns and tests were performed with and without WHOs by right-handed, females, aged 20 - 50 years over a ten week period. The time taken to complete each task was recorded and a wrist goniometer, elbow goniometer and a forearm <b>torsiometer</b> were used to measure joint motion. Results show that, although orthoses may restrict the motion required to perform a task, participants do not use the full range of motion which the orthoses permit. The altered wrist position measured may be attributable to a modified method of performing the task or to a necessary change in grip pattern, resulting in an increased time in task performance. The effect of WHO use on ADL is task specific and may initially impede function. This could have an effect on WHO compliance if {{there appears to be no}} immediate benefits. This orthotic effect may be related to restriction of wrist motion or an inability to achieve the necessary grip patterns due to the designs of the orthoses...|$|E
40|$|Prefabricated wrist-hand orthoses (WHOs) are {{commonly}} prescribed {{to manage the}} functional deficit and compromised grip strength {{as a result of}} rheumatoid changes. It is thought that an orthosis which improves wrist extension, reduces synovitis and increases the mechanical advantage of the flexor muscles will improve hand function. Previous studies report an initial reduction in grip strength with WHO use which may increase following prolonged use. Using normal subjects, and thus in the absence of pain as a limiting factor, the impact of ten WHOs on grip strength was measured using a Jamar dynamometer. Tests were performed with and without WHOs by right-handed, female subjects, aged 20 - 50 years over a ten week period. During each test, a wrist goniometer and a forearm <b>torsiometer</b> were used to measure wrist joint position when maximum grip strength was achieved. The majority of participants achieved maximum grip strength with no orthosis at 30 ° extension. All the orthoses reduced initial grip strength but surprisingly the restriction of wrist extension did not appear to contribute in a significant way to this. Reduction in grip must therefore also be attributable to WHO design characteristics or the quality of fit. The authors recognize the need for research into the long term effect of WHOs on grip strength. However if grip is initially adversely affected, patients may be unlikely to persevere with treatment thereby negating all therapeutic benefits. In studies investigating patient opinions on WHO use, it was a stable wrist rather than a stronger grip reported to have facilitated task performance. This may explain why orthoses that interfere with maximum grip strength can improve functional task performance. Therefore while it is important to measure grip strength, it is only one factor to be considered when evaluating the efficacy of WHOs...|$|E
40|$|AbstractOver {{the past}} 3 decades, Nickel-Titanium (NiTi) {{instruments}} {{have become an}} important part of the armamentarium for shaping phase of root canal treatment. NiTi endodontic files have increased flexibility and strength compared with stainless steel instruments, but they seem to be vulnerable to fracture in clinical situations. Many variables might contribute to file separation, but the 2 main causes are cyclic fatigue and torsional stress. Heat treatment (thermal processing) is one of the most fundamental approaches toward adjusting the transition temperatures of NiTi alloys and affecting the fatigue and torsional resistance of NiTi endodontic files. In recent years, novel thermo-mechanical processing and manufacturing technologies such as controlled memory wire (CM-wire), M-Wire and electrical discharge machining (EDM) have been developed to optimize the microstructure of NiTi alloys and their mechanical properties. Aim of this work was to investigate the torsional resistance (maximum torque load, and angular rotation) of NiTi instruments made by different thermo-mechanical and manufacturing processes. One-hundred new Hyflex EDM One- File (# 25 / 0. 08, CM-wire and EDM process), WaveOne Primary (# 25 / 0. 08, M-wire), ProTaper Next X 2 (# 25 / 0. 06, M-wire), Hyflex CM (# 25 / 0. 06, CM-wire) and F 6 SkyTaper(# 25 / 0. 06, conventional NiTi) files were used. Torque and angle of rotation at failure of new instruments (n = 20) were measured using a <b>torsiometer</b> according to ISO 3630 - 1 for each brand. Data were analyzed using the analysis of variance test and the Student- Newman-Keuls test for multiple comparisons. The fracture surface of each fragment was examined with a scanning electron microscope. Files made by CM wire size # 25, 0. 06 taper (Hyflex CM) showed same torque load and angular rotation to fracture than conventional NiTi (F 6 SkyTaper) (P >. 05); instead CM files (manufacturing by grinding or EDM process) recorded lower maximum torque load (P. 05) but significantly higher angular rotation (P <. 05) to fracture than M-wire instruments size # 25, 0. 06 taper (ProTaper Next). Hyflex EDM One-File and Hyflex CM have same torque load and angular rotation to fracture than F 6 SkyTaper due to the higher flexibility and cross-sectional area of CM files tested than conventional NiTi one. Moreover CM files showed lower torque load and higher angular rotation to fracture than M-wire instruments due to the flexibility of CM alloy. M-wire instruments showed same torque load but significantly lower angular rotation than conventional NiTi files due to the same flexibility and higher cross-sectional area of the files tested...|$|E
