25|$|In {{the years}} {{leading up to}} the {{creation}} of the residential school's, the Sons of Freedom had become a concern for the province of British Columbia as a whole; they seemed <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> with any sort of government, in addition to the laws and policies that were being enforced. Public and Authorities were unhappy because the Sons Of Freedom did not register their births, deaths or marriages that occurred within their communities; in addition to the fact that they weren't sending their children to public schools. Public alarm was increasing, based on the fears that the unruly incidents of nude protests, burning of homes and buildings and bombings of bridges and railways, were not being attended to by the RCMP.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{purpose of}} this study was to survey left-handed (LH) dental {{students}} and interns concerning whether they face any problems in their dental education or in their practice of dentistry. The questionnaires were distributed in four dental colleges in different regions in Saudi Arabia. The questionnaire was comprised of sixteen questions to assess the following issues: demo-graphic information, difficulties in dental school or dental practice due to left-handedness, preferred hand in performing different dental procedures, and musculoskeletal complications. The study found that the percentage of LH dental students was around 7 percent (110 out of 1, 660). More than half of these participants (n= 56) reported that being LH is not <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> in general, while when performing the required dental work, around 51 percent (n= 56) agreed <b>to</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem.</b> The majority (68 percent; n= 75) reported that they <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> with <b>having</b> RH instructors, and 84. 5 percent (n= 93) responded that their institution is not properly equipped to accommodate LH students. Only 34 percent (n= 37) agreed that using facilities of an RH dentist may cause musculoskeletal complications to an LH dentist. The results of this study suggest that dental schools should provide LH students with appropriate equipment and a proper learning environment...|$|R
