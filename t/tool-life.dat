40|$|It {{is known}} that {{estimating}} the wear level at a future time instant and obtaining an updated evaluation of the <b>tool-life</b> density is essential to keeping machined parts at the desired quality level, reducing material waste, increasing machine availability, and guaranteeing the safety requirements. In this regard, the present paper aims at showing that the <b>tool-life</b> model that Braglia and Castellano [23] developed can be successfully adopted to probabilistically predict the future tool wear and to update the <b>tool-life</b> density.

40|$|In {{this paper}} a novel {{approach}} to the derivation of the <b>tool-life</b> distribution, when the tool useful life ends after a progressive wear process, is presented. It {{is based on the}} diffusion theory and exploits the Fokker-Planck equation. The Fokker-Planck coefficients are derived {{on the basis of the}} injury theory assumptions. That is, tool-wear occurs by detachment of small particles from the tool working surface, which are assumed to be identical and time-independent. In addition, they are supposed to be small enough to consider the detachment process as continuous. The tool useful life ends when a specified total volume of material is thus removed. <b>Tool-life</b> distributions are derived in two situations: (i) both Fokker-Planck coefficients are time-dependent only, and (ii) the diffusion coefficient is neglected and the drift is wear-dependent. Theoretical results are finally compared to experimental data concerning flank wear land in continuous turning of a C 40 carbon steel bar adopting a P 10 type sintered carbide insert. The adherence to the experimental data of the <b>tool-life</b> distributions derived exploiting the Fokker-Planck equation is satisfactory. Moreover, the <b>tool-life</b> distribution obtained when the diffusion coefficient is neglected and the drift is wear-dependent is able to well-represent the wear behavior at intermediate and later times...|$|E

40|$|To {{clarify the}} {{characteristics}} of corrosive wear of coated high-speed steel tools in high moisture-content Douglas-fir (Psuedotsuga menziesii Franco) cutting, <b>tool-life</b> tests were conducted with a whirling disc-machine. Three kinds of coated tools and uncoated tools were prepared. Both rake faces and clearance faces of the tools were coated with either TiN, TiCN, or CrN by physical vapor deposition (PVD) method. The thickness of thin-film for each coated tool was 2 - 3 μm. In the <b>tool-life</b> tests, electrical-potential of + 1 kV, 0 V, or — 1 kV {{was applied to the}} tool by use of a direct-current power supply. From scanning electron microscope observations conducted after the <b>tool-life</b> tests, delamination of thin-film for each coated tool was viewed. The degree of delamination was the largest under + 1 kV, and the smallest under — 1 kV. Among measurements of tool wear, edge recession under 0 V for CrN-coated tools was the smallest among all of the tools. The CrN-coated tool was superior to the other tools in reducing the progression of edge recession. The differences in edge recession under — 1 kV for the three kinds of coated tools were not detectable. The tool-wear progression under + 1 kV for all tools occurred quickly. By regarding edge recession at — 1 kV as being caused by a mechanical wear mechanism, the ratio of corrosive wear to the total edge recession under 0 V could be obtained. The value for uncoated tools was 55 % and was the largest. The value for CrN-coated tools was 43 % and was the smallest. 本研究では，高速度鋼工具のすくい面と逃げ面にTiN，TiCN，またはCrNを被膜した各コーティング高速度鋼工具と無処理工具を用いて，ベイマツ高含水率材の平削り加工を 3 種類の通電条件下で行い，コーティング高速度鋼工具の腐食摩耗特性を調べた｡ 工具に直流電圧を与えない 0 Vの通常切削では，工具摩耗量は無処理工具が最も大きく，CrNコーティング工具が最も小さい工具摩耗量を示した｡また，- 1 kVのカソード電圧下での工具摩耗量は，いずれの工具もカソード防食効果によって著しく小さくなり，通常切削の場合の約 1 / 2 の値を示し，供試工具による違いはほとんど認められなかった。さらに，+ 1 kVのアノード電圧下での工具摩耗量は， 0 Vの場合の約 3 倍，- 1 kVの場合の 5. 1 ～ 6. 1 倍の値を示し，TiNコーティング工具とCrNコーティング工具の工具摩耗量は，無処理工具よりも小さくなっていた。通常切削における工具摩耗に占める腐食摩耗の割合を求めると，無処理工具は約 55 %，TiCNコーティング工具は 54 %で無処理工具と大差ないが，TiNコーティング工具は 48 %であり，CrNコーティング工具は 43 %で最も小さい値を示した...|$|E

The basic structure of the system consisted of the following five modules: design, monitoring, pattern and diagnosis, knowledge base, and update and learning. The design module provides the recommended operating conditions and the predicted <b>tool-life.</b> The monitoring module captures, digitizes and transforms the vibration signals from the drilling process. The pattern and diagnosis module is the most essential component of the system. It includes a routine that calculates four primary descriptors (features) and two secondary descriptors.

It was found that only one of the four primary descriptors is sufficient to develop the system and the tool replacement is made when the grade of 2 ̆ 7 unnormal 2 ̆ 7 drilling is predominant. The two fuzzy algorithms are both capable of classifying the vibration signals with a percentage of success of greater than 83 and 90, respectively.

However, while machining the titanium alloys using solid carbide tools, even with jet infusion of coolant lower tool life was vividly seen. The high temperatures generated at the tool–work interface causes adhesion of work-material on the cutting edges; hence, shorter tool life was reported. To reduce the high tool–work interface temperature positive rake angle, higher primary relief and higher secondary relief were configured on the ball nose end-mill cutting edges. However, after an initial working period, the growth of flank wear facilitates higher cutting forces followed by work-material adhesion on the cutting edges. Therefore, {{it is important to}} blend the strength, sharpness and surface integrity on the cutting edges so that the ball nose end mill would demonstrate an extended <b>tool-life.</b> Presently, validation of tool geometry is very tedious as it requires extensive machining experiments. This paper illustrates a new feature-based ball-noseend-mill–work interface model with correlations to the material removal mechanisms by which the tool geometry optimization becomes easier. The data are further deployed to develop a multi-sensory feature extraction/correlation model to predict the performance using wavelet analysis and Wagner Ville distribution. Conclusively, this method enables to evaluate the different ball nose end mill geometry and reduces the product development cycle time...|$|E
40|$|The {{capability}} of drill status monitoring {{has a strong}} economic potential, since large benefits can be obtained when exploiting tools up to their real end-of-life; {{this can be done}} once the decay mechanism is clearly defined and understood. A large amount of research activities has been devoted so far in the last decades, particularly for drilling operations, since tool management, usually, relies on a conservative evaluation of <b>tool-life,</b> because of the empirical approach in evaluating the effects of failure mechanisms bringing to sudden failures or decay; this fact leads to an unnecessarily high number of changes and to increase of cost impacts. For this reasons, particularly in automated production systems, efforts in research should be devoted on the measurement of drill-status, which reflects directly on surface features and indirectly {{on the quality of the}} holes manufactured. This paper presents a benchmark of a large number of existing drill-decay measurement techniques (DDMT) proposed so far in scientific papers and contributions, providing an up-to-date analysis of main factors which characterized the applicability of DDMT to automated production systems as well as the pro and cons of principal technologies available. The outcome of the work is thus a technical requirement specification useful to provide new hints for realising a reliable wear monitoring system for drilling operations, potentially applicable to automated production system...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. High speed steels have {{a leading}} {{position}} {{in the group of}} tool materials today in regard to their special properties. The article deals with the cutting life of tools, which cutting tips were produced from high speed steels. The test were realized at Faculty of Manufacturing Technologies TU Kosice with the seat in Presov, in collaboration with Institute of Material Research of Slovak Academy of Sciences in Kosice. As the method for <b>tool-life</b> investigation was selected the simple radial lathe-turning test. The measured values were statistically processed and submitted to the remoteness testing according to Grubbs. The results of the experiments are graphically presented as a dependence of cutting life on the cutting speed for five types of high speed steels. The base material for four of them was high speed steel STN 19 830 produced via powder metallurgy. It was modified by additional alloying elements, so in this way originated next variations of this steel listed above. Measured data were compared with the fifth type of high speed steel with similar chemical composition, but this type was produced via classical approach- by casting metallurgy. The know-how of the investigated relation will enable to the producers to make a good decision about what type of tool material should be used at the machining in specific conditions in order to achieve good quality of machined surface while achieving the required level of energy consumption...|$|E
