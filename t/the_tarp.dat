25|$|On October 7, 2008, the Federal Reserve further {{expanded}} the collateral it will loan against to include commercial paper {{using the new}} Commercial Paper Funding Facility (CPFF). The action made the Fed a crucial source of credit for non-financial businesses in addition to commercial banks and investment firms. Fed officials said they'll buy {{as much of the}} debt as necessary to get the market functioning again. They refused to say how much that might be, but they noted that around $1.3 trillion worth of commercial paper would qualify. There was $1.61 trillion in outstanding commercial paper, seasonally adjusted, on the market as of October 1, 2008, {{according to the most recent}} data from the Fed. That was down from $1.70 trillion in the previous week. Since the summer of 2007, the market has shrunk from more than $2.2 trillion. This program lent out a total $738 billion before it was closed. Forty-five out of 81 of the companies participating in this program were foreign firms. Research shows that Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) recipients were twice as likely to participate in the program than other commercial paper issuers who did not take advantage of <b>the</b> <b>TARP</b> bailout. The Fed incurred no losses from the CPFF.|$|E

500|$|On Friday, November 23, 2007, Heinz Field hosted four WPIAL {{championship}} {{football games}} which were followed {{the day after}} with a game between Pitt and South Florida. After discussion with the NFL, Steelers ownership {{made the decision to}} re-surface the field for their nationally televised game against the Miami Dolphins. A layer of sod was laid overtop the [...] Desso GrassMaster surface. The field's condition was exacerbated by 1½inches of rain after the new sod had been laid, which did not allow <b>the</b> <b>tarp</b> to be removed from the field until 70 minutes before the game began. The field conditions during the game ended up being so bad that at one point during the game, a punt by Dolphins punter Brandon Fields ended up sticking into the turf without bouncing. The Steelers won the game 3–0, with a field goal by Jeff Reed with 17seconds remaining in regulation; it was the NFL's first 3-0 game since 1993 and the longest two teams went without scoring since the New York Giants and Detroit Lions played to a scoreless tie on November 11, 1943. Scott Brown, of the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, called the field a [...] "veritable mud pit". While Gene Upshaw, head of the National Football League Players' Association, also criticized the field citing a 2006 survey of NFL players that ranked Heinz Field as the second worst field in the league. Steelers receiver Hines Ward called the playing conditions [...] "horrendous" [...] after the game. However, the following day Ward and other Pittsburgh players lobbied to keep the natural surface stating, [...] "I think everybody wants to keep the grass." [...] Since that season, the Steelers have played their game on the weekend following Thanksgiving on the road at the team's request.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the seismic}} {{vulnerability}} of the old press box, the University of California dismantled the structure and installed a temporary facility that stood until the 2010 season. The installation of the temporary press box brought the stadium's capacity down to 73,347 and then down to 72,516 for the 2004 season. California brought the seating capacity further down to 67,537 with tarps being placed over four sections (one in each corner). The university did remove <b>the</b> <b>tarps,</b> however, for important games allowing a full 72,516 to attend.
