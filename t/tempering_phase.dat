The structure is obtained from the heating of low or medium carbon steel in the region α + γ (temperatures between A 1 -A 3), then follow by holding process within a certain time and cooled quickly (quench) in water,brine or oil. The result has a microstructure of martensite and ferrite {{as well as a}} few otherstructures. The steel usually has high tensile strength, good elongation and there is no discontinuity yield. The problem is how the influence of parameters milling process on surface roughness the dual phase carbon steel The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the outcome Freis CNC cutting conditions due to the formation process of double and <b>tempering</b> <b>phase</b> that begins with the process of forging (forging) on carbon steel. This study used AISI 1045 steel Ø 16 mm x 150 mm diameter, which was forged at a temperature of 950 oC- 900 oC to form a rectangular cross section with a size of 10 mm x 16 mm x 180 mm. Dual-phase heating was continued at a temperature of 770 ºC, arrested at 90 2 ̆ 7 and cooled rapidly in oil, followed by atempering process 600 ⁰C/ 30 2 ̆ 7. The process of cutting was done by cutting finishing with feeding 0. 12; 0. 14; 0. 16 mm / put and depth of cut 0. 4; 0. 6; 0. 8 mm while roughing cuts by feeding 0. 2; 0. 4; 0. 6 mm / put and depth of cut 1. 2, 1. 4;a 1. 6 amm. The result Depth of cut can affect the deflection. The deflection could be increased by increasing the depth of cut. The results obtained increase the level of surface roughness. On the depth of cut 0. 4 mm with feeding 0 : 16 mm / put the value obtained average roughness Ra 0. 64 μm, including group N 6 roughness when compared with 0. 8 mm depth of cut with the same feeding value of average roughness Ra 1. 08 μm including N 7. Surface roughness increased by feeding could affect the feeding of 0. 12 mm / put and 0. 16 mm / put, 0. 2 mm / put and 0. 6 mm /put because the distance from the cutting peak roughness increases, so the roughness of the rough and the process of finishing cuts on carbon steel dual phase is more subtle than on the untreated carbon steel with the same cutting parameters...|$|E

40|$|Ferritic-martensitic (F/M) steels {{are known}} to have greater {{resistance}} to void swelling, higher thermal conductivities and lower thermal expansion coefficients than austenitic steels do. The strength and swelling resistance of F/M alloys can be further improved through adding fine dispersions of various yttria oxides. The majority of such oxide-dispersion-strengthened (ODS) alloys introduce dispersoids in ferrite phases. However, previous studies have shown that in the absence of dispersoids, the ferrite phase is significantly less swelling resistant than the <b>tempered</b> martensite <b>phase.</b> A dual-phase 12 Cr ODS alloy with improved corrosion and oxidation resistance exhibits promising microstructural stability and void swelling resistance under 3. 5 MeV Fe^ 2 + ion irradiation at elevated temperatures. Dispersoids were originally present in both ferrite and tempered martensite grains, with the latter having a wider range of dispersoid sizes. In both phases dispersoids larger than 10 nm in diameter are incoherent with the matrix, while smaller dispersoids exhibit coherency. Beyond radiation damage of 60 displacements per atom (dpa), dispersoids in both phases appear to approach a near-identical equilibrium size, which depends on irradiation temperature. The evolution of dispersoids under irradiation was found {{to be related to the}} interface configuration. Grain morphology was found to be stable under irradiation up to a peak dpa of 800. Compared to other ferritic-martensitic alloys, the ion-induced swelling of this alloy is quite low, arising from swelling resistance associated with both tempered martensite and dispersoids in both phases.

40|$|The {{hypothesis}} of thermal damage mechanisms by short-term local friction heating of rail or wheel steels leading to initiation of cracks, specifically squats (in some works called studs) in rails and crack clusters in wheels {{has given the}} inspiration for this study. A Finite Element (FE) model incorporating phase transformation from near pearlitic steel to austenite, and then to martensite was developed to examine developing strength and stress fields. Thermal strains on heating, cooling and phase transformations are naturally included, and the FE model also incorporates shrinkage due to tempering of the martensite during subsequent heat pulses. The material behaviour implemented in the model has been rationalised from experiments done on near pearlitic wheel steels, however the qualitative results are deemed applicable also for local thermal damage on pearlitic rail steels.

Plating process was made by applying current of density (40 Amp / dm 2) and the range of solution temperature was (50  55 oC) with different time periods (1 - 5 hr). A low carbon steel type (Ck 15) was used as substrate for hard chromium electroplating. Solid carburization was carried out for hard chromium plating specimen at temperature (925 oC) with time duration (2 hr) to be followed with quenching and <b>tempering.</b> The <b>phase</b> analysis was conducted by using X ray diffraction. The examination results show that the chromium carbides in plating layer were (Cr 23 C 6, Cr 7 C 3). The microhardness of hard chromium plating specimen was measured, and the results show that the high hardness was about (907 HV). After solid carburization the hardness values increase and the results show that the higher hardness for chromium plating layer on low carbon steel surface was (1276 HV). Wear apparatus type (Pin on Disc) was used to study dry sliding wear properties of low carbon steel (As received) and hard chromium plating specimens and solid carburized. The effect of applied normal load on wear rate was studied with weighting method using five normal loads (5, 10, 15, 20, 25 N) at constant sliding speed (2. 198 m / sec).

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this thesis {{is to improve the}} {{fundamental}} knowledge of non-isothermal <b>tempering</b> of martensite <b>phase</b> and its effects on the reduction in hardness (softening) with respect the base metal occurring at the heat affected zone (HAZ) of resistance spot welded dual-phase (DP) steels. This thesis also aims at understanding the influence of HAZ-softening on the joint performance of various DP steel grades. The tempering of martensite occurring at the sub-critical HAZ (SC-HAZ) of resistance spot welded DP 600, DP 780 and DP 980 steels has been systematically evaluated by microhardness testing through Vickers indentation and the degree of tempering has been correlated to the HAZ-softening. From the joint performance analysis of similar and dissimilar steel grade combinations assessed through standardized testing methods, three important issues have been targeted: a) the joint strength (maximum load to failure), b) the location of failure (failure mode), and c) the physical characteristic of the weld that determines certain type of failure (weld nugget size). In addition, a partial tensile test has been conducted in order to evaluate the initiation of failure in dissimilar steel grade combinations. It has been shown that HAZ-softening lowered the weld size at which transition from interfacial to pullout failure mode takes place along with increased load-bearing capacity and higher energy absorption. Thus, it is concluded from mechanical testing that HAZ-softening benefits the lap-shear tensile joint performance of resistance spot welded DP steels by facilitating pullout failures through failure initiation at the SC-HAZ (tempered region). Instrumented nanoindentation testing was employed to further investigate HAZ-softening along the SC-HAZ by evaluating individual phases of ferrite matrix and tempered martensite islands. Although the ferrite matrix presented a slight reduction in hardness at nanoscale, higher reduction in hardness (softening) resulted for tempered martensite; thus confirming that tempered martensite is the major contributor to softening at micro-scale. A comparison between nanohardness and microhardness testing made at different distances from the line of lower critical temperature of transformation (Ac 1) allowed revealing the actual extension of the SC-HAZ. In this regard, good correlation was obtained between nanohardness results along the SC-HAZ and the microstructural changes analyzed by electron microscopy (i. e., the tempering of martensite occurring at various distances far from Ac 1 was correlated to low temperature <b>tempering</b> of dual <b>phase</b> steels). An in-depth analysis of the <b>tempering</b> of martensite <b>phase</b> at high temperature in DP steel subjected non-isothermal conditions i. e., rapid heating, extremely short time at peak temperature and rapid cooling (resistance spot welding), has been carried out mainly through analytical transmission electron microscopy (TEM). In addition, an isothermal tempering condition (i. e., slow heating and long time at peak temperature) in DP steel has been evaluated for complementing the analysis. Both non-isothermal and isothermal conditions have been correlated to the softening behaviour. TEM analysis of the base metal in the DP steel indicated that the morphology of the martensite phase is dependent on its carbon content, and its tempering characteristics are similar to that of equal carbon containing martensitic steel. The isothermally tempered structure is characterized by coarsening and spheroidization of cementite (θ) and complete recovery of the martensite laths; whereas precipitation of fine quasi-spherical intralath θ-carbides, coarser plate-like interlath θ-carbides, decomposition of retained austenite into elongated θ-carbides, and partial recovery of the lath structure were observed after non-isothermal tempering of DP steel. This difference in tempering behaviour is attributed to synergistic effect of delay in cementite precipitation due to higher heating rate, and insufficient time for diffusion of carbon that delays the third stage of tempering process (cementite coarsening and recrystalization) during non-isothermal. The finer size and the plate-like morphology of the precipitated carbides along with the partial recovery of the lath structure observed after non-isothermal tempering strongly influenced the softening behaviour of DP steel. The chemical analysis of θ-carbides through extraction replicas for three different DP steels revealed that the chemistry of the carbides is inherited from the parent DP steel during non-isothermal tempering at high temperature confirming that non-isothermal tempering DP steel is predominantly controlled by carbon diffusion...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{different}} tempering temperatures on the microstructure and mechanical properties of air-quenched high boron {{white cast iron}} was studied. The {{results indicate that the}} high boron white cast iron comprises dendritic matrix and inter-dendritic M 2 B boride; and the matrix comprises martensite and pearlite. After quenching in the air, the matrix is changed into lath martensite; but only 1 -μm-size second phase exists in the matrix. After <b>tempering,</b> another second <b>phase</b> of several tens of nanometers is found in the matrix, and the size and quantity increase with an increase in tempering temperature. The two kinds of second precipitation phase with different sizes in the matrix have the same chemical formula, but their forming stages are different. The precipitation phase with larger size forms during the austenitizing process, while the precipitation phase with smaller size forms during the tempering process. When tempered at different temperatures after quenching, the hardness decreases with an increase in the tempering temperature, but it increases a little at 450 ℃ due to the precipitation strengthening effect of the second phase, and it decreases greatly due to the martensite decomposition above 450 ℃. The impact toughness increases a little when tempered below 300 ℃, but it then decreases continuously owing to the increase in size and quantity of the secondary precipitate above 300 ℃. Considered comprehensively, the optimum tempering temperature is suggested at 300 ℃ to obtain a good combination of hardness and toughness...|$|R
40|$|Understanding the {{precipitation}} reaction {{is very important}} since precipitation hardening {{is one of the}} most effective strengthening mechanisms in metallic alloys. In martensitic steels, a tempering heat treatment is often performed. During <b>tempering</b> various new <b>phases</b> are precipitated and the spatial and temporal evolution of these precipitates strongly influences the properties of the steel, such as strength/ductility, creep, fatigue and hot corrosion resistance. Therefore, the possibility of quantitative modelling of the precipitation process will provide many opportunities for advanced materials and process design and optimization as well as service life assessments. The Fe-C-Cr system forms the basis for tool steels and is consequently used in many applications such as e. g. metal forming operations. They are characterized by a high hardness and good toughness, even at elevated temperatures. In the present work, the as-quenched martensitic microstructures of four Fe-C-Cr alloys with varying Cr and C contents were characterized by Light Optical Microscopy (LOM) and Electron Microscopy. The effects of Cr and C on the morphology of martensite were investigated. It was found that Cr addition had a similar effect as C on the martensitic morphology and on the ratio of high-angle grain boundary (HAGB) to low-angle grain boundary (LAGB). However, the micro-hardness was unaffected by the Cr addition whilst it was strongly influenced by the C addition. In addition, a quantitative experimental characterization of the precipitates formed during tempering of the martensite was performed. The Langer-Schwartz theory combined with the Kampmann-Wagner-Numerical (KWN) method, as implemented in the software TC-PRISMA, was used to predict the precipitation of carbides after tempering in one of the model alloys: Fe- 0. 15 C- 4. 0 Cr (mass%). The microstructure characterization of the as-quenched material provided vital input parameters for the modelling work and a comparison was made between the modelling predictions and the experimental results.

40|$|The {{mechanical}} {{performance of}} Dual Phase (DP) and Complex Phase (CP) steels was investigated by SEM analysis, tensile testing, Forming Limit Curve investigation and flange formability testing. The alloys of interest were Dual Phase (DP) untempered, Dual <b>Phase</b> (DP) <b>tempered</b> and Complex <b>Phase</b> (CP) steels. Phase content {{analysis showed that}} {{the distribution of the}} ferrite and martensite phases was the same for the two DP alloys, but the grain size and condition (tempered/untempered) for the martensite islands was much different in the two alloys. In the tempered DP steel, the smaller grain size for the martensite and the tempering process resulted in increased elongation, more formability and ability to form a flange (flangeability). In CP steels the soft ferrite phase is replaced by harder bainite, yielding a bainitic-martensitic microstructure. Bainite reduced the total elongation of the alloy during tensile testing, reduced the formability (especially under plane strain conditions) of the alloy but improved the flangeability of the alloy. Under flanging conditions, CP steels deformed to higher strains, at tighter radii with minimum springback. Microstructural inspections at the outer radius of the flanged specimens revealed that in CP steels bainite deforms similarly to martensite, therefore the strain partitioning is smaller in CP steels in comparison to DP steels. Plastic deformation in CP steels upon flanging occurs with the formation of strong slip bands in both martensite and bainite. In contrast, the martensite and ferrite grains in DP steels deform quite differently leading to strong strain localisations. Void nucleation and cracking occurred at the martensite islands or within the soft ferrite phase next to the martensite islands. In CP steels no voids or damage was observed within the matrix. A special case study was done with a thicker and stronger alloy, a Martensitic 1400 steel to reveal the flangeability limits for advanced high strength steels. Neither cracks nor damage were observed visually on the flanged specimens. However SEM observations at the outer radius of the flanged samples revealed significant void growth at inclusion sites and cracks nucleating within the matrix adjacent to the inclusions. ...|$|R
40|$|The ceramic {{assemblage}} {{from previous}} excavations at Crystal River (8 CI 1), a Woodland period mound center on Florida’s west-central coast, exhibits variation in temper and surface treatments indicative of distinct pottery traditions and, perhaps, social groups. I analyzed ceramics from recent, better controlled excavations at Crystal River and the neighboring and partially contemporaneous site of Roberts Island (8 CI 41), using the theoretical framework of communities of practice to evaluate this claim. Analysis suggests {{that while some}} degree of diversity in paste was maintained through all four phases, there was greater homogeneity of paste, {{as well as more}} mixing of paste categories, during Phases 2 and 3. The former was an interval marked by intensive settlement at Crystal River, and the dominance of limestone tempered pottery suggests the emergence of a common, locally-based pottery making tradition. A switch to sand as a <b>tempering</b> agent in <b>Phase</b> 3 probably reflects greater dispersal of settlement, and specifically a shift to the occupation of coastal islands. Trends in surface treatments may also appear to reflect changes in settlement, although the pattern here is less straightforward owing to broader trends in ceramic decoration. The vast majority of pottery in each phase is plain, but plain pottery is particularly dominant (and the diversity of surface treatments correspondingly low) during the peak in settlement in Phase 2. As with temper, this may suggest that pottery making practices converged, as initially disparate groups lived together in closer proximity, perhaps creating a common social identity. As settlement became more dispersed in Phase 3, pottery making traditions again became more diverse. This perhaps reflects increased isolation of households, although it no doubt also stems from a regional trend toward more variety in ceramic decoration. In Phase 4, plain pottery again became dominant, a trend typical of the terminal Late Woodland. In general, the analysis suggests that temper and surface treatment track changes in settlement, and thus might be reasonably inferred to also track the extent to which potters shared pottery making practices, and perhaps social identities. Communities of practice thus provides a useful framework for understanding how social identities are expressed through technological and stylistic practices...|$|R
40|$|The main aim of {{this project}} is to {{investigate}} the microstructures of different matrix samples and correlate to the wear system response by varying matrix microstructure. SG iron {{is used for the}} production of different automobile parts such as camshaft and gears. SG iron is most important member among different members of cast iron family due to its high strength, toughness together with ductility. The main reason of this high ductility is presence of nodular structure of graphite that is present in it unlike present in grey cast iron as the flakes. In grey cast iron, stress concentration is high at the corners of these flakes but has been removed in the case of spheroidal graphite cast iron with the nodular shape. As a result of this its ductility increases along with toughness. In order to obtain the optimum wear resistance of SG cast iron, the current investigation involves annealing, normalizing, quench & tempering and austempering heat treatments leading to transformation of as-cast matrix to ferritic, pearlitic, tempered martensitic and coarse upper bainitic matrices respectively. Specimens having different alloying elements were austenitized to 1000 °C for soaking time 90 min, followed by furnace cooling, air cooling, oil and salt bath quenching followed by air cooling for respective heat treatments. Vickers hardness test was conducted over the samples under 20 Kg followed by wear test was carried over DUCOM TR- 208 M 1 ball on plate type wear monitor under 10 N, 30 N and 50 N loads respectively in dry sliding condition for the sliding distance of 7. 54 m with the speed 0. 063 m/s. The hardness was maximum for quenched & tempered specimen in case of SG- 02 samples due to presence of <b>tempered</b> martensitic matrix <b>phase</b> while, in case of SG- 01, normalized specimen has maximum hardness due to presence of pearlitic matrix phase. The lowest hardness was observed to be for annealed sample with ferritic matrix phase. On the other hand hardness of ferritic, pearlitic and bainitic matrices was observe to be in between these range, also marginal difference was observed in as-cast and tempered martensitic matrices. The cause of this difference is that in as-cast specimen of iv SG- 01 has bull’s eye ferritic/pearlitic matrix which may cause its hardness increases, whereas in case of as-cast sample of SG- 02 fully ferritic phase is obtained as a result of which hardness decreases. For quench & tempered as well as austempered specimens of SG- 01 has lower hardness value in comparison of that of in SG- 02 because of more percentage of C, Mn, Ni, Cr, Mo and Si in SG- 02 specimens that has tendency of strengthening solid solution of ferrite in ductile cast iron. It was observe that when sample of as-cast specimen subjected to load in between 10 N- 20 N it lost its weight continuously, while with increase in load to 30 N subsequently weight gain was observe. This weight gain is due to the formation of oxide layer. There was no weight loss or gain observe for normalized specimen however in case of austempered specimen weight gain was observe for 20 N and 30 N due to formation of oxide which can be investigated by means of EDAX analysis. Finally it has been concluded that for the samples having ferritic, pearlitic, bainitic matrices phase, adhesive wear is main wear mechanism along with shallow pits are produced due to delamination and deposited over the sites where graphite nodules have already formed before...|$|R
