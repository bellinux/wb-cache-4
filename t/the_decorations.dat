5|$|<b>The</b> <b>decorations</b> were in wood, stucco and stone, {{including}} marble, with geometrical and floral {{patterns and}} arabesques with Samarran and Byzantine origins. <b>The</b> <b>decorations</b> were {{more complex than}} the earlier Islamic forms and more carefully adapted to structural constraints. The imposing architecture and decoration of Fatimid buildings such as the al-Hakim mosque provided a backdrop that supported the dual role of the Fatimid caliph as both religious and political leader.|$|E
5|$|Arthur, Prince of Wales, son of Henry VII, married Catharine of Aragon in St Paul's on November 14, 1501. Chroniclers are profuse {{in their}} {{descriptions}} of <b>the</b> <b>decorations</b> {{of the cathedral}} and city on that occasion. Arthur died five months later, {{at the age of}} 15, and the marriage was later to prove contentious during the subsequent reign of his brother, Henry VIII.|$|E
5|$|Construction of {{the temple}} began in 2000 and it was {{finished}} in 2005. Most of the construction was done by Church volunteers, who provided funding and a skilled workforce. The structure was designed by Church members and the design was revised by architects to ensure compliance with building codes. <b>The</b> <b>decorations</b> and ornaments were also designed and installed by Church members. The temple serves as a central congregation for southeastern Texas.|$|E

Martha {{promptly}} arrives and fills the house with the Christmas decorations Marge has always dreamed of, but the other family members end up as part of <b>the</b> <b>decorations</b> instead of being able to enjoy the holiday with her. Marge quickly realizes that it is Homer and the children that make Christmas special for her, so Martha gets rid of all <b>the</b> <b>decorations</b> with a magic wand. Marge then wakes up on Christmas Day to find that her family has brought her the ingredients for breakfast in bed. Their attempts to cook it go awry, so they go out for breakfast instead.|$|E
5|$|Groves had {{previously}} been nominated for the Distinguished Service Medal {{for his work on}} the Pentagon, but to avoid drawing attention to the Manhattan Project, it had not been awarded at the time. After the war, <b>the</b> <b>Decorations</b> Board decided to change it to a Legion of Merit. In recognition of his work on the project, the Belgian government made him a Commander of the Order of the Crown and the British government made him an honorary Companion of the Order of the Bath.|$|E
5|$|In late August 1917, {{the rotary}} engine F.I {{prototype}} {{was assigned to}} Voss as his personal aircraft. In his childhood, Voss had flown Japanese fighting kites with his cousins in Krefeld; <b>the</b> <b>decorations</b> on the kites gave him the inspiration to paint the nose cowling of his triplane with two eyes, eyebrows and a moustache. The arrival of the new fighter brought celebrities visiting. On 31 August, Anthony Fokker escorted German Chancellor Georg Michaelis and Major General Ernst von Lossberg to see and film the new triplane. On 9 September, Crown Prince Wilhelm would also visit Jasta 10.|$|E

5|$|On 2 December 2007, nine VCs {{were among}} 100 medals stolen from locked, {{reinforced}} glass cabinets at the QEII Army Memorial Museum in Waiouru, New Zealand with {{a value of}} around NZD$20 million. Charles Upham's VC and Bar was among these. A reward of NZ$300,000 was posted {{for information leading to}} the recovery of <b>the</b> <b>decorations</b> and conviction of the thieves, although at the time there was much public debate about the need to offer reward money to retrieve the medals. On 16 February 2008 New Zealand Police announced all the medals had been recovered.|$|E
5|$|The Scottish {{architect}} George Wittet {{combined the}} elements of the Roman triumphal arch and the 16th-century architecture of Gujarat. The monument's design is a combination of Hindu and Muslim architectural styles. The arch is of Muslim style while <b>the</b> <b>decorations</b> are of Hindu style. The Gateway of India is built from yellow basalt and reinforced concrete. The stone was locally obtained, and the perforated screens were brought from Gwalior. The gateway faces out to Mumbai Harbour from the tip of Apollo Bunder.|$|E
5|$|Elsa {{plans to}} give Anna a {{surprise}} birthday party {{with the help}} of Kristoff, Sven, and Olaf; but while Anna is led on a party treasure hunt by a string that winds through the kingdom, Elsa has caught a cold, and unknowingly produces a group of small living snowmen with each sneeze, who begin to dismantle the birthday party's decorations while Kristoff tries to stop them. While Elsa takes Anna on the hunt, Kristoff, Sven, and Olaf try to control the snowmen and fix <b>the</b> <b>decorations</b> in time for Anna and Elsa's return. After Elsa nearly falls off a clock tower, Anna convinces her to take rest. While Anna enjoys the party, Elsa sneezes a giant snowball through an alphorn, inadvertently stunning Hans overseas; whereupon Elsa rests in bed under Anna's care. Olaf, Kristoff, and Sven escort the small snowmen to Elsa's ice palace, where they stay with her snow-giant doorkeeper Marshmallow.|$|E

5|$|It {{was common}} for Christie to greet a {{returning}} submarine at the pier, and to award decorations {{to the crew}} on the spot. This bypassed naval award boards, and annoyed Kinkaid and Lockwood, possibly because confirmation of sinkings was accomplished by Ultra, the reading of coded Japanese radio traffic, and news of awards given so quickly could constitute a security breach. Complicating the matter was the fact MacArthur awarded army decorations to naval personnel; like Christie, he {{took it upon himself}} to authorize <b>the</b> <b>decorations</b> rather than to go through the standard review procedures. These events compelled Kinkaid to forbid Christie to give pierside awards, and to keep Christie from recommending the award of army medals to navy personnel. These events would ultimately contribute to Christie's dismissal as Commander of Submarines in Fremantle.|$|E
5|$|Overton {{was told}} {{he would not be}} given <b>the</b> <b>decorations</b> he had earned in Korea, {{including}} the awards from his previous tour which had not yet been written up. Overton had twice been pinned with a Distinguished Flying Cross personally by Fifth Air Force commander Lieutenant General Glenn O. Barcus, and he had been considered for several Silver Star Medals. Overton was also given a bad efficiency report which characterized him as insubordinate. Overton lost his temporary rank of captain. The military delayed official recognition of his credits and ace status until December 1953. He became one of 40 US aces during the war. Overton resigned his commission before the war ended.|$|E
5|$|Ted Williams, {{whose mother}} was of Mexican {{heritage}} enlisted on May 22, 1942. Williams received his wings and commission in the Marine Corps on May 2, 1944. He was in Hawaii awaiting orders {{as a replacement}} pilot when the war ended. Williams returned to the States in December 1945 and was discharged from the Marines on January 28, 1946. On May 2, 1952, Williams was recalled to active duty due to the Korean War. After completing jet refresher training in the F9F Panther at Cherry Point, North Carolina, Williams joined VMF-311 in Korea. He flew 37 combat missions and had a narrow escape when he crash-landed a flak-damaged aircraft. Among <b>the</b> <b>decorations</b> he received was the Air Medal with two Gold Stars for meritorious achievement. Williams returned to the States and relieved from active duty with the rank of captain on July 28, 1953. Williams, who played professional baseball with the Boston Red Sox, was elected to baseball's Hall of Fame in 1966.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Decoration</b> for Officers of the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve, post-nominal letters VD until c. 1947 and VRD thereafter, {{was instituted}} in 1908. It could be awarded to {{part-time}} commissioned {{officers in the}} United Kingdom's Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve after twenty years of service as efficient and thoroughly capable officers. <b>The</b> <b>decoration</b> was a Naval version of <b>the</b> Volunteer Officers' <b>Decoration</b> and its successor, <b>the</b> Territorial <b>Decoration.</b>|$|R

25|$|Three ribbons {{are used}} with <b>the</b> <b>decoration.</b> In <b>the</b> United Kingdom, an {{alternative}} ribbon is used when <b>the</b> <b>decoration</b> is awarded to {{officers of the}} Honourable Artillery Company, while a new regular ribbon was introduced in 1967.|$|R
5|$|The Australia was not {{expected}} to arrive in Hawaii until October 31. Plans for Kalākaua's homecoming celebration in Hawaii had begun in August, and included every organized civic and labor union group, {{as well as the}} student body of every school on Oahu. The general public was {{invited to participate in the}} festivities. Honolulu was in the final stages of preparation on October 29, when the Australia flying Kalākaua's royal flag sailed past Diamond Head, making its way to Honolulu Harbor. As the alert quickly spread across Oahu, a battery of guns began firing along the waterfront from Diamond Head to the port, and a frenzied scramble began to complete <b>the</b> <b>decorations.</b> After 281 days of constant travel, Hawaii's last king was home.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>decorations</b> are {{all high}} quality and often highly complex. In one decoration, which {{occupies}} a one-inch square {{piece of a}} page, there are 158 complex interlacements of white ribbon with a black border on either side. Some decorations can only be fully seen with magnifying glasses, although lenses of the required power are not {{known to have been}} available until hundreds of years after the book's completion. The complicated knot work and interweaving found in Kells and related manuscripts have many parallels in the metalwork and stone carving of the period. Since their gradual rediscovery from the 19th century on, these designs have also had an enduring popularity. Many of these motifs are used today in popular art including jewellery and tattoos.|$|E
5|$|The major {{religious}} activities (or pujas) performed every morning are mahabhishek (ablution), abhishek, gitapath and bhagavat puja, {{while in the}} evening the pujas include geet govinda and aarti. Recital in vedic scripts like Ashtotram and Sahasranama is practiced during all the rituals. After aarti, <b>the</b> <b>decorations</b> are removed from the image of Badrinath and sandalwood paste is applied to it. The paste from the image {{is given to the}} devotees the next day as prasad during the nirmalaya darshan. All the rituals are performed in front of the devotees, unlike those in some Hindu temples, where some practices are hidden from them. Sugar balls and dry leaves are the common prasad provided to the devotees. From May 2006, the practise of offering Panchamrit Prasad, prepared locally and packed in local bamboo baskets, was started.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> Volunteer Officers' <b>Decoration</b> {{continued}} to be awarded in some Crown Dependencies until <b>the</b> Efficiency <b>Decoration</b> was instituted in September 1930. Bermuda was the last Dependency to award <b>the</b> <b>decoration</b> in 1930.|$|R

5|$|The {{process of}} {{awarding}} the Victoria Cross may {{take place in}} two ways: One is through a recommendation by <b>the</b> <b>Decorations</b> and Commendations Advisory Committee, which {{is a part of}} the Department of National Defence and has six members, one appointed by the governor general and the rest by the chief of the Defence Staff. Alternatively, a field commander can submit a name for consideration, though permission must be obtained from the governor general before the award can be presented. Recipients are entitled to receive an annuity from the federal Canadian Crown; per the Canadian gallantry awards order issued in January 2005, members of the Canadian Forces or those who joined the British forces while domiciled in Canada or Newfoundland prior to 31 March 1949, after receiving the Victoria Cross, be granted C$3,000 each year. Previously, Canadians who were posthumously awarded the British Victoria Cross were given special headstones at their burial sites in Commonwealth War Graves and other cemeteries.|$|E
5|$|Two Stars of David {{were added}} {{to the center of the}} facade. One is seen in the old {{photograph}} (above left), over a palmette ornament at the top of the window arch. The other, mounted above the top of the gable, remains visible in the modern photograph (top). The unusual cupola-like structure on legs seen above the gable in the old photograph, now gone, was also added by the synagogue, as was the square structure on which it sat. The panel with a large Hebrew inscription over the main doors was added in this period, before the older photograph. <b>The</b> <b>decorations</b> to the upper parts of the central section of the facade survived until at least 1974, as did the tracery to the square windows on the towers; this Gothic ornamentation was removed after it deteriorated.|$|E
5|$|After Christie's {{return from}} his second combat patrol, Admiral Chester Nimitz {{recommended}} he and Lockwood meet in Brisbane and discuss joint submarine operations. During the visit, Lockwood and Christie discussed technical issues, {{as well as}} the establishment of advanced bases in Mios Woendi and Saipan. However, the meeting also resulted in some kind of personal rift between the two men. They had already clashed over the Mark 6 exploder and the Mark 14 torpedo, and some of Lockwood's staff believed Christie's ride in Harder was a risky and unnecessary stunt. After meeting with Lockwood, Christie met with MacArthur and related the events of Dealey's fifth war patrol to the general. MacArthur then decided to award Dealey a Distinguished Service Cross, and Christie the Silver Star. Additionally at this meeting, Christie found out his earlier recommendation for an army decoration to Griffith had apparently been blocked by Kinkaid. Despite Kinkaid's order regarding army decorations, MacArthur insisted on granting medals to the two men. Although Christie did not request <b>the</b> <b>decorations,</b> he was put on the spot and felt compelled to report the entire affair to Kinkaid. In the end, the general awarded the medals, displeasing Kinkaid.|$|E
