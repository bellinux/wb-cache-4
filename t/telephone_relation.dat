In accordance with Article 30 of the International Telecommunication Convention, Nairobi, 1982, the standard rates given in this Recommendation are expressed in the monetary unit of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Special Drawing Right (SDR), and in gold fran...|$|R

40|$|Within {{mainstream}} social psychology, consumer {{behavior has}} been explained mainly {{in terms of}} the theory of planned behavior (TPB). Recently, some authors suggested that selfidentity dimensions can explain different types of intentions. To compare the predictive power of a tentative new model of self-expressive consumer behavior with that of the TPB, three studies were conducted in which, besides the classical variables of the model of TPB, variables concerning self-identity were also taken into account. Three independent samples (N 1 = 257, N;! = 214, N 3 = 298) were recruited to study the intention to buy fashionable watches, trendy backpacks, and cellular <b>telephones</b> in <b>relation</b> to the aforementioned variables derived from TPB and from identity theory. Data analyses, based on structural equation modeling, show that identity variables contribute significantly to the explanation of purchase intention...|$|R
50|$|In June 2014, Article 21 of Directive 2011/83/EU on Consumer Rights {{came into}} force. It states Member States shall ensure that where the trader {{operates}} a telephone {{line for the}} purpose of contacting him by <b>telephone</b> in <b>relation</b> to the contract concluded, the consumer, when contacting the trader is not bound to pay more than the basic rate. HM Government enacted Article 19 concerning credit and debit card surcharges much earlier than originally scheduled, and the bulk of the directive in July 2013. However, draft legislation banning 084, 087 and 09 numbers for customer service use wasn't published until August 2013. In the initial draft, various sectors such as finance, passenger transport, roundsmen, gambling and package travel were proposed to be exempt, but the FCA subsequently ruled that the financial sector should be included, and their Call Charges Rule Rule GEN 7.2 came into force on 26 October 2015.|$|R
40|$|In the interwar {{period the}} British Post Office, or the General Post Office (GPO), {{was the largest}} {{organisation}} and employer in Britain. In the 1930 s the GPO employed over 250, 000 workers. The organisation was in fact several businesses. Its primary activities revolved around communication, principally postal services, telegraphs and <b>telephone.</b> In <b>relation</b> to the former the interwar period, and particularly the 1930 s, witnessed a massive growth in international postal services via airmail. In addition, the GPO operated a major bank, the Post Office Savings Bank, and oversaw the broadcasting license for the British Broadcasting Corporation whic h it represented in Parliament. Finally the GPO {{was responsible for the}} payment of government benefits, including old age pensions. With the increase in social welfare from the liberal reforms of 1906 - 14 onwards, the GPO for many people in Britain became the embodiment and symbol of the state.

Information sources included interviews with <b>telephone</b> company public <b>relations</b> personnel, company publications, and other publications. The five chapters deal with the history and development of the company and its public relations program, and the organization, functions, and operations of the public relations department. With a long and varied history of public relations activities, the company executes numerous activities for employees, customers, educational institutions, the community, stockholders, and the media. The study recommends that the department establish a committee to formulate long-range public relations goals, initiate a management orientation program, and advertise in area high school and college publications...|$|R

40|$|Based on {{our field}} and desk-research, {{this paper will}} discuss the current {{situation}} of mobile <b>telephones</b> in <b>relation</b> to electronic publishing?a convergence that remains yet to be developed [...] {{with a view to}} the feasibility of interactive electronic publishing availability in these devices. Our paper offers a special focus on the different modes of stakeholder organization that exist in Japan and Europe, given that the main actors involved in the field of mobile Internet, i. e. telecom operators, handset manufacturers and content providers, interact very differently inthese two regions. There are marked distinctions between the Japanese model, which is strictly coordinated by one player, and the European model, which makes more use of open standards without a dominant party. The result has been that electronic publishing content has taken off rapidly in Japan, with an abundance of services available, while in Europe it is virtually non-existent. The relevance of the contrastive approach is important to follow the current developments of the mobile industry and the telecom joint ventures in the European Union, especially now that in 2003 the leading Japanese telecom players are beginning to act as stakeholders in the EU region. The authors conclude that neither the Japanese nor the EU models?being so different from one another, will predominate in the future; the best model will be one that combines business elements from both...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Moderate {{hypothermia}} in neonates with hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy {{might improve}} survival and neurological outcomes {{at up to}} 18 months of age, although complete neurological assessment at this age is difficult. To ascertain more precisely the effect of therapeutic hypothermia on neonatal cerebral injury, we assessed cerebral lesions on MRI scans of infants {{who participated in the}} Total Body Hypothermia for Neonatal Encephalopathy (TOBY) trial. METHODS: In the TOBY trial hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy was graded clinically according to the changes seen on amplitude integrated EEG, and infants were randomly assigned to intensive care with or without cooling by central <b>telephone</b> randomisation. The <b>relation</b> between allocation to hypothermia or normothermia and cerebral lesions was assessed by logistic regression with perinatal factors as covariates, and adjusted odds ratios (ORs) were calculated. The TOBY trial is registered, number ISRCTN 89547571. FINDINGS: 325 infants were recruited in the TOBY trial between 2002 and 2006. Images were available for analysis from 131 infants. Therapeutic hypothermia was associated with a reduction in lesions in the basal ganglia or thalamus (OR 0. 36, 95 % CI 0. 15 - 0. 84; p= 0. 02), white matter (0. 30, 0. 12 - 0. 77; p= 0. 01), and abnormal posterior limb of the internal capsule (0. 38, 0. 17 - 0. 85; p= 0. 02). Compared with non-cooled infants, cooled infants had fewer scans that were predictive of later neuromotor abnormalities (0. 41, 0. 18 - 0. 91; p= 0. 03) and {{were more likely to have}} normal scans (2. 81, 1. 13 - 6. 93; p= 0. 03). The accuracy of prediction by MRI of death or disability to 18 months of age was 0. 84 (0. 74 - 0. 94) in the cooled group and 0. 81 (0. 71 - 0. 91) in the non-cooled group. INTERPRETATION: Therapeutic hypothermia decreases brain tissue injury in infants with hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy.
