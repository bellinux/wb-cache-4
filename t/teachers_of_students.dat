40|$|It {{is common}} in the {{implementation}} <b>of</b> <b>teacher</b> accountability systems to use a procedure known as Empirical Bayes shrinkage to adjust the teacher value-added estimates by their level of precision. Because value-added estimates based on fewer students and students with "hard-to-predict" achievement will be less precise, the procedure could have differential impacts on {{the probability that the}} <b>teachers</b> <b>of</b> fewer <b>students</b> or students with hard-to-predict achievement will be assigned consequences. This paper investigates how shrinkage affects the value-added estimates <b>of</b> <b>teachers</b> <b>of</b> hard-to-predict <b>students,</b> focusing on the context of threshold-based accountability systems. We found that the achievement of particular groups <b>of</b> <b>students</b> [...] students with low prior achievement and who receive free lunch [...] is harder to predict. <b>Teachers</b> <b>of</b> these types <b>of</b> <b>students</b> tend to have less precise value-added estimates, and shrinkage increases their estimates' precision. Shrinkage also reduces the absolute value of the value-added estimates <b>of</b> <b>teachers</b> <b>of</b> hard-to-predict <b>students.</b> However, in our data, we found that shrinkage has no statistically significant effect on the relative probability that <b>teachers</b> <b>of</b> hard-to-predict <b>students</b> receive consequences...|$|R

Research has proven that schools with a high suspension rate {{do not have a}} successful academic outcome. A study of school-wide implementation of classroom meetings in a lower-income Sacramento, CA elementary school over a four-year period showed that suspensions decreased (from 64 annually to 4 annually), vandalism decreased (from 24 episodes to 2) and teachers reported improvement in classroom atmosphere, behavior, attitudes and academic performance. (Platt, 1979) A study of parent and teacher education programs directed at parents and <b>teachers</b> <b>of</b> <b>students</b> with [...] "maladaptive" [...] behavior that implemented Positive Discipline tools showed a statistically significant improvement in the behavior of students in the program schools when compared to control schools. (Nelsen, 1979) Smaller studies examining the effects of specific Positive Discipline tools have also shown positive results. (Browning, 2000; Potter, 1999; Esquivel) Studies have repeatedly demonstrated that a student’s perception of being part of the school community (being [...] "connected" [...] to school) decreases the incidence of socially risky behavior (such as emotional distress and suicidal thoughts / attempts, cigarette, alcohol and marijuana use; violent behavior) and increases academic performance. (Resnick et al., 1997; Battistich, 1999; Goodenow, 1993) There is also significant evidence that teaching younger students social skills has a protective effect that lasts into adolescence. Students that have been taught social skills are more likely to succeed in school and less likely to engage in problem behaviors. (Kellam et al., 1998; Battistich, 1999) ...|$|E

However, little research exists to support best practices in the evaluation of special education teachers. The evaluation of special education teachers involves many unique challenges which are especially apparent when evaluating <b>teachers</b> <b>of</b> <b>students</b> with lowincidence disabilities. The tools and processes being proposed by the state are born from research within general education and, consequently, may not be effective in meeting the unique challenges of evaluating special education teachers. The perceptions of special education administrators regarding the effectiveness of tools/systems currently being used in Michigan to evaluate <b>teachers</b> <b>of</b> <b>students</b> with lowincidence disabilities are examined in this study. In addition, the perceptions of special education administrators regarding the importance of certain evaluation components within evaluation tools/systems to be used with <b>teachers</b> <b>of</b> <b>students</b> with low-incidence disabilities are also examined. The perceived effectiveness varied across respondents. However, the perceived effectiveness of evaluation tools was higher when the tool had been modified specifically for <b>teachers</b> <b>of</b> <b>students</b> with low-incidence disabilities.
