5|$|As hats {{go out of}} fashion, the {{anthropomorphic}} bear Popol the Hatter {{heads into}} the American West with his wife Virginia and blue donkey, Bluebell. Setting up camp {{in the land of}} the Bunnokee, a tribe of anthropomorphic rabbit Native Americans, he does good business there. This infuriates the Bunnokee medicine man, whose feather headdress business has declined as a result. He and the Chief of the Bunnokees conspire to eradicate the economic threat, launching war against Popol. Using <b>technology</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> more advanced than the Bunnokee's bow and arrows, Popol defeats the rabbits' initial attacks, but they retaliate by abducting Virginia and threatening to torture her. Popol then rescues her, and together they escape, coming upon a river in which they discover gold.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the fact}} that {{reserves}} of crude oil are non-commercial, Jordan has the 5th largest oil-shale reserves in the world, which could be commercially exploited in the central and northwestern regions of the country. Official figures estimate the kingdom's oil shale reserves at more than 70 billion tonnes. Attarat Power Plant, which will start construction in late 2017, is a $2.2 billion oil shale-dependent power plant that will be completed in 2020 with a total capacity of 470 megawatts. The project {{is part of the}} kingdom's visionary plan that aims to diversify its energy resources by 2025. The extraction of shale oil had been delayed by a couple of years due to: the advanced level of <b>technology</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> required for extraction; and the relatively higher cost.|$|E

25|$|Gaseous {{diffusion}} is {{a technology}} {{used to produce}} enriched uranium by forcing gaseous uranium hexafluoride (hex) through semi-permeable membranes. This produces a slight separation between the molecules containing 235U and 238U. Throughout the Cold War, gaseous diffusion {{played a major role}} as a uranium enrichment technique, and as of 2008 accounted for about 33% of enriched uranium production, but in 2011 was deemed an obsolete <b>technology</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> steadily being replaced by the later generations of technology as the diffusion plants reach their ends-of-life. In 2013, the Paducah facility in the US ceased operating, it was the last commercial 235U gaseous diffusion plant in the world.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we {{test the}} {{hypothesis}} <b>that</b> health <b>technology</b> assessment units located in hospitals {{tend to be}} more optimistic toward <b>technologies</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> currently in use in their organization than <b>technologies</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> not. The data include 108 health technologies assessed in 87 full-scale health technology assessment reports produced by the four main local health technology assessment units in Quebec (Canada) on behalf of decision makers from the same facility. We found that 58 (53. 7 percent) of the 108 technologies were currently in use within the hospital during their assessment. Based on the assessors' interpretation of the scientific evidence regarding the efficacy of the technologies, 67. 3 percent of the <b>technologies</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> in use in the hospital during the evaluation were effective (56 percent for those <b>that</b> <b>were</b> not currently being used), but the difference is not statistically significant (chi-square 1. 38; p = 0. 24). Controlling for the efficacy judgment, the type of technologies (i. e. preventive, diagnostic, therapeutic or organizational), the number of technologies assessed in the report and the assessment unit, we found <b>that</b> the <b>technologies</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> currently in use in the facility during the evaluation were 62 percent more likely to be recommended favorably by the assessment unit than the <b>technologies</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> not currently being used (RR = 1. 62; 95 percent CI = 1. 06 - 1. 88). This suggests that the local health <b>technology</b> units <b>that</b> <b>were</b> examined in the study tended to be more optimistic toward <b>technologies</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> currently in use in their hospital {{at the time of the}} evaluation...|$|R

25|$|It {{has been}} {{concluded}} that heat pumps are the single technology that {{could reduce the}} greenhouse gas emissions of households better than every other <b>technology</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> available on the market. With a market share of 30% and (potentially) clean electricity, heat pumps could reduce global CO2 emissions by 8% annually. Using {{ground source heat pumps}} could reduce around 60% of the primary energy demand and 90% of CO2 emissions in Europe in 2050 and make handling high shares of renewable energy easier. Using surplus renewable energy in heat pumps is regarded as the most effective household means to reduce global warming and fossil fuel depletion.|$|E
25|$|Both {{the current}} UK {{coalition}} {{government and the}} previous Labour Government expressed concerns about the rising costs of {{a survey of the}} whole population conducted once every ten years. Meanwhile, the accuracy and utility of a snapshot of the whole UK population once every ten years compared to continued surveying was being questioned. A rapidly changing society, evolving user requirements and new opportunities were emerging as drivers for change. These concerns and opportunities encouraged the UK Government to investigate alternative methods of population data collection; to identify the best way to provide small area population, and socio-demographic statistics in the future by taking advantages of the more advanced <b>technology</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> becoming available, and also to make use of existing sources of demographic data already being collected by the private sector.|$|E
25|$|Marlin (DRM) is a <b>technology</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> {{developed}} and maintained {{in an open}} industry group known as the Marlin Developer Community (MDC) and licensed by the Marlin Trust Management Organization (MTMO).

25|$|Device {{fingerprinting}} is {{a fairly}} new <b>technology</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> useful in fraud prevention and safeguarding any information from one's computer. Device fingerprinting uses data from the device and browser sessions to determine the risk of conducting business with the person using the device. This technology allows companies to better assess the risks when business is conducted through sites that include, e-commerce sites, social networking and online dating sites and banks and other financial institutions. ThreatMetrix {{is one of the}} leading vendors of device fingerprinting. This company employs a number of techniques to prevent fraud. For example, ThreatMetrix will pierce the proxy to determine the true location of a device. Due to the growing number of hackers and fraudsters using 'botnets' of millions of computers that are being unknowingly controlled, this technology will help not only the companies at risk but the people who are unaware their computers are being used.|$|E
25|$|In {{the third}} book, , Artemis (in what he {{considers}} to be his last criminal act before his father recovers from his injuries) creates the C Cube, a mini super-computer based on the People's <b>technology</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> decades ahead of human technology. He plans {{to make a deal}} with Chicago technology businessman Jon Spiro over the Cube, but Spiro double-crosses Artemis, steals the Cube, and wounds Domovoi Butler in the process. Along with Holly Short and Foaly, Artemis succeeds in healing Butler and ensuring that Spiro does not discover the existence of the People through use of the C Cube. The C Cube is recovered, with the help of Foaly, Holly, Juliet (Butler's sister), and Mulch. But to gain the help of Foaly, Holly, and their Fairy technology, Artemis has to agree to Butler's, Juliet's and his own memories being wiped by the People, to avoid future misadventures.
