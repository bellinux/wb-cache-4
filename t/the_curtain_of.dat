25|$|There are two islands on {{the crest}} of the falls that are large enough to divide <b>the</b> <b>curtain</b> <b>of</b> water even at full flood: Boaruka Island (or Cataract Island) near the western bank, and Livingstone Island near the middle—the point from which Livingstone first viewed the falls. At less than full flood, {{additional}} islets divide <b>the</b> <b>curtain</b> <b>of</b> water into separate parallel streams. The main streams are named, in order from Zimbabwe (west) to Zambia (east): Devil's Cataract (called Leaping Water by some), Main Falls, Rainbow Falls (the highest) and the Eastern Cataract.|$|E

25|$|Sewage liquor is {{run into}} deep tanks with {{diffuser}} grid aeration {{systems that are}} attached to the floor. These are like the diffused airstone used in tropical fish tanks but on a much larger scale. Air is pumped through the blocks and <b>the</b> <b>curtain</b> <b>of</b> bubbles formed both oxygenates the liquor and also provides the necessary mixing action. Where capacity is limited or the sewage is unusually strong or difficult to treat, oxygen may be used instead of air. Typically, the air is generated by some type of blower or compressor.|$|E

25|$|In Mark, Jesus is crucified {{along with}} two rebels, and the day goes dark for three hours. Jesus calls out to God, then gives a shout and dies. <b>The</b> <b>curtain</b> <b>of</b> the Temple is torn in two. Matthew follows Mark, adding an {{earthquake}} and the resurrection of saints. Luke also follows Mark, though he describes the rebels as common criminals, one of whom defends Jesus, who in turn promises that he (Jesus) and the criminal will be together in paradise. Luke portrays Jesus as impassive {{in the face of}} his crucifixion. John includes several of the same elements as those found in Mark, though they are treated differently.|$|E

500|$|Despite all {{the concern}} over these {{military}} threats, the weather presented the gravest danger. At {{the beginning of}} the operation, pilots in the first wave reported the weather as [...] scattered, [...] overcast with [...] visibility, except in haze over Saigon, where visibility decreased to one mile. This meant that scattered clouds existed below their flight path while a solid layer of clouds more than two miles above their heads obscured the sun. <b>The</b> <b>curtain</b> <b>of</b> haze over Saigon so altered the diminished daylight that line of sight visibility was only a mile. The weather conditions deteriorated as the operation continued.|$|E

500|$|The Atlantic torpedo is aplacental viviparous: the {{developing}} embryos are sustained by yolk, which is later supplemented by protein and fat-enriched histotroph ("uterine milk") {{produced by the}} mother. Females have two functional ovaries and uteruses, and a possibly biennial reproductive cycle. After a year-long gestation period, females bear up to 60 pups during the summer; the litter size increases {{with the size of}} the female. When the embryo is [...] long, it has a pair of deep notches {{at the front of the}} disc marking the origin of the pectoral fins, and <b>the</b> <b>curtain</b> <b>of</b> skin between the nostrils has not yet developed; on the other hand, the eyes, spiracles, dorsal fins, and tail have reached adult proportions. Newborn rays measure [...] long, and still have the anterior notches in the disc. Males and females reach sexual maturity at lengths of [...] and [...] respectively.|$|E
500|$|A typical {{eruption}} {{along the}} Great Rift and similar basaltic rift systems {{starts with a}} curtain of very fluid lava shooting up to [...] high along {{a segment of the}} rift up to [...] long. As the eruption continues, pressure and heat decrease and the chemistry of the lava becomes slightly more silica rich. <b>The</b> <b>curtain</b> <b>of</b> lava responds by breaking apart into separate vents. Various types of volcanoes may form at these vents: gas-rich pulverized lava creates cinder cones (such as Inferno Cone– stop 4), and pasty lava blobs form spatter cones (such as Spatter Cones– stop 5). Later stages of an eruption push lava streams out through the side or base of cinder cones, which usually ends the life of the cinder cone (North Crater, Watchmen, and Sheep Trail Butte are notable exceptions). This will sometimes breach part of the cone and carry it away as large and craggy blocks of cinder (as seen at North Crater Flow– stop 2– and Devils Orchard– stop 3). Solid crust forms over lava streams and lava tubes (a type of cave), and are created when lava vacates its course (examples can be seen at the Cave Area– stop 7).|$|E

The Australian Stokes mortar crews ran short of bombs and the battalion was engaged from behind its right flank. From the German rear, a large number of troops advanced in close order and were engaged with small-arms fire.|$|E

2500|$|A {{decade after}} the gentle, {{laughing}} satire of The Rape of the Lock, Pope wrote his masterpiece of invective and specific opprobrium in The Dunciad. [...] The story {{is that of the}} goddess Dulness choosing a new Avatar. [...] She settles upon one of Pope's personal enemies, Lewis Theobald, and the poem describes the coronation and heroic games undertaken by all of the dunces of Great Britain in celebration of Theobald's ascension. [...] When Pope's enemies responded to The Dunciad with attacks, Pope produced the Dunciad Variorum, with a [...] "learned" [...] commentary upon the original Dunciad. In 1743, he added a fourth book and changed the hero from Lewis Theobald to Colley Cibber. [...] In the fourth book of the new Dunciad, Pope expressed the view that, in the battle between light and dark (enlightenment and the Dark Ages), Night and Dulness were fated to win, that all things of value were soon going to be subsumed under <b>the</b> <b>curtain</b> <b>of</b> unknowing.|$|E
