5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} {{the west coast}} of Africa on October3. It tracked westward, reaching the Caribbean Sea on October10. By October13, a large area of convection persisted from Hispaniola southwestward through Panama, and {{over the next few days}} the convection organized and concentrated in the northwestern Caribbean Sea. An anticyclone became established near Jamaica on October15, which created a favorable upper-level environment for <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>by</b> reducing wind shear. Around the same time, a low-level trough emerged from the Intertropical Convergence Zone, heading north off the coast of Nicaragua. Early on October 16, the system developed into a broad tropical depression about halfway between Central America and Jamaica.|$|E
5|$|Although the Sun dominates <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>by</b> mass, it {{accounts}} for only about 2% of the angular momentum. The planets, dominated by Jupiter, account {{for most of the}} rest of the angular momentum due to the combination of their mass, orbit, and distance from the Sun, with a possibly significant contribution from comets.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, {{there would be}} a {{continuing}} need for fast freight locomotives, capable of operating on both electrified and non-electrified routes, without impeding the intensive use of <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>by</b> passenger trains. Suburban electrification used electric multiple units, which had no equivalent freight design. Although Bulleid built two prototype electric locomotives in 1941, these were, as yet, unproven, and freight haulage would be undertaken by steam traction for the foreseeable future.|$|E

In the 2010–11 school year, 46,191 students were enrolled in the public school system. DCPS has one of the highest-cost yet lowest-performing school systems in the country, both in terms of infrastructure and student achievement.

5|$|On September 13, {{despite being}} in an {{extremely}} hostile environment with very high wind shear, convection redeveloped {{near the center of}} Fred, and regeneration into a tropical cyclone was seen as a possibility. Two days later, the NHC noted that environmental conditions could become marginally favorable for redevelopment of the system. On September16, the circulation of Fred became less defined and only intermittent convection persisted around <b>the</b> <b>system.</b> <b>By</b> September17, the remnant circulation became increasingly disorganized and the system dissipated later that day without regenerating into a tropical cyclone. However, several hours later, a new area of low pressure formed in association with the remnants of Fred roughly 525mi (845km) south of Bermuda. The remnant low finally dissipated on September19, roughly 520mi (835km) southwest of Bermuda.|$|E
5|$|Parsons Transportation Group {{was awarded}} a $138million {{contract}} in November 2011 to design and install CBOSS by October 2015. Parsons began physical work on CBOSS in September 2013, starting with the installation of a fiber optic line along the Caltrain right-of-way. The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) approved Caltrain's plans in 2014 and Caltrain noted that CBOSS was due to enter revenue service {{by the end of}} 2015. Because Caltrain had multiple goals for CBOSS, including increased safety, improved operational efficiency, and ensured interoperability with other rail providers (Caltrain shares tracks with Union Pacific, Altamont Corridor Express, and Amtrak), implementation was challenging and Caltrain, the busiest commuter rail service on the West Coast, still had not fully implemented <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>by</b> the end of 2016.|$|E
5|$|Reception {{towards the}} {{introduction}} of Takedowns was highly positive. Reviewers admired the impact that Takedowns had in transforming the boost mechanic and shifting the game's focus to a more aggressive style of driving. GamesTM {{pointed out that the}} hostile behaviour of AI rivals supplemented <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>by</b> presenting more opportunities to perform Takedowns, culminating in an intense and dramatic racing experience. Lopez explained that Burnout 3 had intelligently integrated elements of vehicular combat games by introducing Takedowns. Gerstmann commended the game's use of Impact Time and Aftertouch mechanics, which he believed made crashing an entertaining aspect of the game unlike other racers. IGN's Fran Mirabella III was amazed by the crash system; he considered it to be far ahead of anything that had been done before.|$|E

5|$|Tropical Storm Claudette {{originated}} from a tropical wave that moved off {{the west coast}} of Africa on August7. On August11, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) began monitoring the wave when it was located roughly 600mi (965km) east of the Lesser Antilles. Disorganized shower and thunderstorm activity was associated with the westward moving wave; however, the NHC did not anticipate further development of <b>the</b> <b>system.</b> <b>By</b> the afternoon of August12, little convective activity remained with the wave. Strong upper-level wind shear created an unfavorable environment for the system to re-organize as it tracked through the eastern Caribbean Sea.|$|E
5|$|Around 06:00UTC, Bopha passed 100km (65mi) {{south of}} Babeldaob island in Palau while at its initial peak. Shortly {{thereafter}} {{it made its}} closest approach the nation, tracking roughly 55km (35mi) south of Angaur island. After clearing Palau, Bopha ultimately intensified further before making a devastating landfall on Mindanao in the Philippines. The JTWC estimated its peak intensity at 280km/h (175mph), a Category5 on the SSHWS. The storm resulted in up to 1,901fatalities {{in the country and}} tremendous infrastructural damage. Land interaction substantially weakened <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>by</b> the time it emerged over the Sulu Sea. Turning north, Bopha briefly weakened to a tropical storm on December6 before undergoing another period of rapid intensification. After reaching its tertiary peak on December7, hostile wind shear caused dramatic weakening. In a 24‑hour span, the typhoon's central pressure rose by 55mbar (hPa; 1.62inHg) while its winds fell from 170km/h (105mph) to 75km/h (45mph). Bopha soon degraded to a tropical depression and dissipated off the northwestern coast of Luzon early on December9.|$|E

5|$|Bret {{originated}} from a tropical wave that moved off {{the west coast}} of Africa on August5. The wave tracked generally westward, interacting with an upper-level low on August15 in the western Caribbean Sea, and spawned a low-pressure area. Convective activity developed around the low, and by August18 the system was over the Yucatán Peninsula. Later that day, the disturbance emerged into the Bay of Campeche and a Hurricane Hunter reconnaissance mission into the system revealed that it had matured into a tropical depression around 1:00pm CDT (1800UTC), the third of the 1999 season. Initially, moderate wind shear prevented the depression from strengthening as it moved slowly and erratically in response to weak steering currents over <b>the</b> <b>system.</b> <b>By</b> August19, the wind shear relented, allowing deep convection to develop over the center; later that day, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) upgraded the system to a tropical storm, assigning it the name Bret. A small tropical cyclone, Bret gradually strengthened for several days as it tracked towards the north. By the morning of August20, rainbands began to form.|$|E
5|$|By 19 March Fay's track {{had turned}} to the west-southwest, {{and over the next}} day it {{continued}} to strengthen in due to favourable upper level outflow and weak vertical sheer. On 21 March, Fay became a Category5 cyclone on the Australian Region Tropical Cyclone Intensity Scale. A mid-latitude trough caused the steering ridge to weaken, and subsequently, Fay to turn to the south. Over the next two days, the environmental shear around the cyclone decreased, which would normally have led to intensification; however, as the shear decreased, the cyclone also moved over an area of dry air, weakening <b>the</b> <b>system.</b> <b>By</b> 23 March, Fay had moved in a loop, and the system weakened to a Category 2. Over the next day, favourable outflow counteracted the dry air that had weakened the system, and a banding eye feature was observed on satellite imagery. Fay then encountered moister air as it moved southward, leading it to re-intensify on 25 March. A weak eye of 10 nm was observed on 26 March which grew to 15nm as the day went on. Strengthening into a Category 4 system early on 27 March, Fay made landfall on the Pilbara coast between 8am and 9am AWST (0000 and 0100UTC) with winds of , weakening below cyclone strength somewhere between the towns of Nullagine and Telfer.|$|E
5|$|By late on May 29, a weak trough {{over the}} Yucatán Peninsula {{produced}} {{a small area}} of convection over the Yucatán Channel. Convection increased {{in association with the}} trough, and the next day a broad envelop of cyclonic turning developed within <b>the</b> <b>system.</b> <b>By</b> May 30, the moisture from the trough extended from Nicaragua through the southeastern Gulf of Mexico, with the greatest area of convection near Cuba. A westward moving tropical wave spawned a broad area of low pressure on May 30, and by May 31 a circulation developed within the system to the southeast of Cozumel, Mexico. The low moved north-northeastward, and gradually became better organized despite high amounts of vertical wind shear. The deep convection became more concentrated near the center, and it is estimated the system developed into a tropical depression at 1200UTC on June 1 just to the northwest of the western tip of Cuba. Operationally, it was not classified until eleven hours later.|$|E
