5|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, the American Kennel Club {{explored}} {{the possibility of}} recognising <b>the</b> <b>Jack</b> Russell terrier. This move was opposed by <b>the</b> <b>Jack</b> Russell Terrier Club of America as {{they did not want}} the breed to lose its essential working characteristics. <b>The</b> <b>Jack</b> Russell Terrier Breeders Association formed and petitioned the AKC; the breed's admission was granted in 2001. Under the AKC recognised standard, the size of the breed was narrowed from the previous club's standard, {{and the name of the}} AKC recognised Jack Russell terrier was changed to Parson Russell terrier, with <b>the</b> <b>Jack</b> Russell Terrier Breeders Association renamed to the Parson Russell Terrier Association of America.|$|E

5|$|In 2011, an Australian ant allergy venom {{study was}} conducted, {{with the goal}} of {{determining}} which native Australian ants were associated with ant sting anaphylaxis. It showed that <b>the</b> <b>jack</b> jumper ant was responsible for the majority of patients' reactions to Myrmecia ant stings. Of the 265 patients who reacted to a sting from an ant belonging to the Myrmecia genus, 176 were from <b>the</b> <b>jack</b> jumper. 15 from M. nigrocincta and three from M. ludlowi, while 56 patients had reacted to other Myrmecia ants. The study concluded that four native species of Australian ants caused anaphylaxis. Apart from Myrmecia species, the green-head ant (Rhytidoponera metallica) was also responsible for several systemic reactions.|$|E

5|$|The {{extent of}} <b>the</b> <b>jack</b> jumper sting problem differs among areas. Allergy {{prevalence}} rates are significantly lower in highly urbanised areas and much higher in rural areas. These ants represent a hazard towards {{people in the}} southern states of Australia, due to {{a high proportion of}} the population having significant allergies to the ant's sting. The ant is a significant cause of major insect allergies, responsible for most anaphylaxis cases in Australia, and rates of anaphylaxis are twice those of honeybee stings. One in three million annually die of general anaphalaxis in Australia alone. Over 90% of Australian ant venom allergies have been caused by <b>the</b> <b>jack</b> jumper.|$|E

5|$|Being a hunt-driven dog, <b>the</b> <b>Jack</b> Russell {{will usually}} pursue most creatures that it encounters. This {{includes}} the skunk, and the breed {{is prone to}} skunk toxic shock syndrome. The chemical in the skunk spray is absorbed by the dog and causes the red blood cells to undergo haemolysis, which can occasionally lead to fatal anaemia and kidney failure. If sprayed underground, it can also cause chemical burning of the cornea. Treatments are available to flush the toxin out of the dog's system.|$|E
50|$|A spinet is a {{harpsichord}} {{with the}} strings set {{at an angle}} (usually about 30 degrees) to the keyboard.

50|$|A jacking gear (also {{known as}} a turning gear) is a device placed on the main shaft of an engine or the rotor of a turbine. <b>The</b> <b>jacking</b> gear rotates <b>the</b> shaft or rotor and {{associated}} machinery (such as reduction gears and main turbines), to ensure uniform cool-down. Without turning, hogging or sagging can occur. Additionally, <b>the</b> <b>jacking</b> gear's assistance in rotation can be used when inspecting the shaft, reduction gears, bearings, and turbines. As an auxiliary function, <b>the</b> <b>jacking</b> gear also helps to maintain a protective oil membrane at all shaft journal bearings.|$|R

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough UniversityIn this research work, {{a comprehensive review of}} investigations into pipe jacking operations, and in particular the forces generated during the process, is presented. The factors affecting these forces were examined and their influence was studied in order to give a clear indication on the their magnitude and behaviour. A model scale testing facility, based on a 1. 8 m X 1. 5 m X 1. 5 m high steel tank, has been developed together with hydraulic jacking facilities and scale model pipes of 200 mm diameter having both steel and concrete surfaces. In this facility <b>the</b> actual pipe <b>jacking</b> operation can be simulated, so that a study of <b>the</b> <b>jacking</b> forces could be made with the use of appropriate instrumentation techniques and computerised data recording. A series of tests was conducted to examine the influence of several parameters on <b>the</b> <b>jacking</b> forces, such as overcut ratio, type of soil, type of pipe surface, overburden pressure, and <b>the</b> rate of <b>jacking.</b> These parameters were in relation to <b>the</b> distance <b>jacked.</b> Two granular soils, uniformly graded Leighton Buzzard sand and well-graded River sand, were used as the material surrounding the pipeline, that is the material through which <b>the</b> pipes were <b>jacked.</b> Laboratory analysis on the soil materials was conducted and the relationship between results obtained from these tests and scale model testing were established. The interface friction between the surface of the pipeline and the surrounding soil was determined. The results show a peak in <b>the</b> <b>jacking</b> forces at <b>the</b> start of <b>the</b> <b>jacking</b> process, followed by a decrease and leveling off as <b>the</b> <b>jacking</b> continued. <b>The</b> graph is very similar to the stress/strain relationship of a typical granular soil. Both steel and concrete pipes were used in the tests to detennined the influence of pipe surface, and to a lesser degree pipe joint, characteristics. Higher forces were recorded for concrete pipes. <b>The</b> <b>jacking</b> rate was kept constant and consistent for all tests. It was found to have little effect on the magnitude of <b>the</b> <b>jacking</b> forces. <b>The</b> <b>jacking</b> forces were measured automatically using a computer. The results show a clear trend of increase in <b>the</b> <b>jacking</b> forces when <b>the</b> overburden pressure and jacking length were increased. Tests using different overcut ratios have indicated that a minimum jacking force might be achieved at a specific overcut ratio. The results of this research show that <b>the</b> <b>jacking</b> forces are influenced by a number of parameters. These include the overburden pressure, overcut ratio, pipe diameter, <b>jacking</b> length and <b>the</b> influence of the surrounding material. This is fully demonstrated by establishing a method of jacking forces prediction, termed herein the Loughborough Method...|$|R
