5|$|<b>The</b> <b>feathers</b> are outgrowths of the {{epidermis}} and {{are found}} in localized bands from where they fan out over the skin. Large flight feathers are found on the wings and tail, contour feathers cover the bird's surface and fine down occurs on young birds and under the contour feathers of water birds. The only cutaneous gland is the single uropygial gland near {{the base of the}} tail. This produces an oily secretion that waterproofs <b>the</b> <b>feathers</b> when the bird preens. There are scales on the legs, feet and claws on the tips of the toes.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>feathers</b> of Archaeopteryx were asymmetrical. This {{has been}} {{interpreted}} as evidence {{that it was a}} flyer, because flightless birds tend to have symmetrical feathers. Some scientists, including Thomson and Speakman, have questioned this. They studied more than 70 families of living birds, and found that some flightless types do have a range of asymmetry in their feathers, and that <b>the</b> <b>feathers</b> of Archaeopteryx fall into this range. The degree of asymmetry seen in Archaeopteryx is more typical for slow flyers than for flightless birds.|$|E
5|$|The female is {{very similar}} to the male but the upper parts are {{somewhat}} more brownish and <b>the</b> <b>feathers</b> on the crown have narrower black central stripes.

5|$|Bee-eaters spend around 10% {{of their}} day on comfort activities. These include sunning themselves, dust bathing and water bathing. Sunning {{behaviour}} helps warm birds in the morning, reducing the need to use energy to raise their temperature. It also has a social aspect, as multiple birds adopt the same posture. Finally, it may help stimulate parasites in <b>the</b> <b>feathers,</b> making them easier to find and remove. Due to their hole-nesting lifestyle, bee-eaters accumulate a number of external parasites such as mites and flies. Together with sunning, bouts of dust bathing (or water bathing where available), as well as rigorous preening, keep <b>the</b> <b>feathers</b> and skin in good health. Bathing with water involves making shallow dives into a water body and then returning to a perch to preen.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1985, a group {{including}} astronomer Fred Hoyle and physicist Lee Spetner {{published a}} series of papers claiming that <b>the</b> <b>feathers</b> on the Berlin and London specimens of Archaeopteryx were forged. Their claims were repudiated by Alan J. Charig {{and others at the}} Natural History Museum in London. Most of their evidence for a forgery was based on unfamiliarity with the processes of lithification; for example, they proposed that, based on the difference in texture associated with <b>the</b> <b>feathers,</b> feather impressions were applied to a thin layer of cement, without realizing that feathers themselves would have caused a textural difference. They also misinterpreted the fossils, claiming that the tail was forged as one large feather, when visibly this is not the case. In addition, they claimed that the other specimens of Archaeopteryx known at the time did not have feathers, which is incorrect; the Maxberg and Eichstätt specimens have obvious feathers.|$|E
50|$|Although {{there are}} many {{different}} parts to a <b>feather,</b> all of <b>the</b> parts fall into two subsections of <b>the</b> <b>feather.</b> <b>The</b> two main sections of <b>the</b> <b>feather</b> are <b>the</b> shaft and the vane.|$|R

5|$|Males {{and females}} {{are similar in}} appearance. Juvenile birds are {{slightly}} browner than the adults, with buff or brown edges to <b>the</b> <b>feathers</b> of the wings and back.

5000|$|Feathers {{begin to}} form from feather follicles, which are invaginations {{starting}} in the epidermis down to the dermis. It is in the dermis that the follicle and the pulp cavity begin to form <b>the</b> <b>feather.</b> <b>The</b> pulp cavity is the space that contains <b>the</b> <b>feather</b> follicle. <b>The</b> <b>feather</b> filament soon grows out of the follicle; {{this is due to}} cell proliferation, which is an increased number of cells as a result cell growth and division, at the follicle base. These new cells form two different tissues. There is the sheath, which is <b>the</b> main <b>feather</b> tissues and pulp caps. The sheath is the supportive layer that surrounds <b>the</b> <b>feather,</b> which falls off as it grows. Similarly, the pulp caps, which protect the dermal core, also fall off as <b>the</b> <b>feather</b> grows. <b>The</b> main <b>feather</b> tissues later unfurl, which causes the disposal of the sheath and the pulp caps as it assumes its functional shape. As <b>the</b> <b>feather</b> grows, its spathe, which is where the rachis and vanes attach, continues to form. When spathe is finished developing, the calamus begins to form within the base of the spathe. The calamus is the quill of <b>the</b> <b>feather,</b> which is <b>the</b> bottom portion that stays mainly within the pulp cavity. From there, <b>the</b> <b>feather</b> is fully developed and will remain as such until molting occurs, causing it to fall off. Feathers fall off during molting, which occurs in the at different times through the year {{depending on the type of}} bird. Birds can molt for seasonal, reproductive and many other reasons ...|$|R
50|$|As <b>the</b> pin <b>feather</b> grows longer, <b>the</b> {{blood supply}} is {{concentrated}} in only {{the base of the}} shaft, and the tip of the shaft encases <b>the</b> <b>feather</b> itself, in a waxy coating.

5|$|The bill of the {{specimen}} is black with a yellowish tip, and the cere is also black, with feathers {{on the upper}} side, almost to the nostrils. The lores are naked, and {{the upper part of}} the head is sooty black. The rest of the head is mostly brownish-black. <b>The</b> <b>feathers</b> of the nape and the neck are slightly bifurcated and have a dark green gloss, the latter with coppery reflections. <b>The</b> <b>feathers</b> of the neck are elongated (sometimes referred to as hackles), and some of those on the sides and lower part have paler spots near the tips. Most of <b>the</b> <b>feathers</b> on the upperparts and wings are dark brown or brownish-black with a dark green gloss. Almost all of these feathers have a triangular, yellowish-buff spot at their tips. The spots are almost whitish on some of the scapular feathers, vague and dark on the primary feathers. The underside of the wings is black with browner flight feathers, which have a pale spot or band at the tips. The breast is brownish-black with a faint green sheen. The tail is blackish with a dark green sheen, brownish-black on the underside, with a narrow, cinnamon-coloured band at the end. This differs from the rust-coloured tail-tip apparently shown in the drawing owned by Lever, and Latham's own illustration. The legs are small and slender, have long toes, large claws, and a comparatively short tarsus, whereas the Nicobar pigeon has shorter claws and a longer tarsus.|$|E

25|$|On {{the basis}} of the Teotihuacan iconographical depictions of <b>the</b> <b>feathered</b> serpent, {{archaeologist}} Karl Taube has argued that <b>the</b> <b>feathered</b> serpent was a symbol of fertility and internal political structures contrasting with the War Serpent symbolizing the outwards military expansion of the Teotihuacan empire. Historian Enrique Florescano also analyzing Teotihuacan iconography argues that <b>the</b> <b>Feathered</b> Serpent was part of a triad of agricultural deities: the Goddess of the Cave symbolizing motherhood, reproduction and life, Tlaloc, god of rain, lightning and thunder and <b>the</b> <b>feathered</b> serpent, god of vegetational renewal. <b>The</b> <b>feathered</b> serpent was furthermore connected to the planet Venus because of this planet's importance {{as a sign of the}} beginning of the rainy season. To both Teotihuacan and Mayan cultures, Venus was in turn also symbolically connected with warfare.|$|R

5|$|The {{triangular}} {{spots of}} the spotted green pigeon {{are not unique}} among pigeons, but are also seen in the spot-winged pigeon (Columba maculosa) and the speckled pigeon (C. guinea), and {{are the result of}} lack of melanin deposition during development. The yellow-buff coloured spots are very worn, while less worn feathers have white tips; this indicates that the former were stained during life or represent a different stage of plumage, and that the latter were fresher. The plumage of the spotted green pigeon was distinct in being very soft compared to that of other pigeons, perhaps due to the body feathers being proportionally long. The hackles were not as elongated as those of the Nicobar pigeon, and <b>the</b> <b>feathers</b> did not differ from those of other pigeons in their microstructure. The plumage was also distinct in being very pigmented, except for the tips of <b>the</b> <b>feathers,</b> and even the down was dark, unlike that of most other birds (a feature otherwise seen in aberrant plumage).|$|E
5|$|The {{upper parts}} are {{generally}} light greyish brown with dark brown centres to <b>the</b> <b>feathers,</b> giving {{the appearance of}} stripes.

The underparts are whitish with faint streaks on the belly. <b>The</b> <b>feathers</b> of the upper breast and throat are long and pointed, giving the head a spiky appearance. The wing and tail are both moderately long with rounded tips. The bill is short, with a sharp pointed appearance, dark blue-grey grading to a grey-black at the tip and around the nostrils. Legs and feet are blue-grey with black claws. The bare skin around the eye is dark brown and the iris a dark black-brown.|$|E
5|$|When the ducklings {{were ready}} for slaughter, the duckers would {{generally}} kill them on their own premises. The slaughter would generally {{take place in the}} morning, to ensure the ducks would be ready for market in the evening. To keep the meat as white as possible, the ducks would be suspended upside down and their necks broken backwards, and held in this position until their blood had run towards their heads. They were kept in this position for ten minutes before being plucked, as otherwise their blood would collect in those parts of the body from which <b>the</b> <b>feathers</b> had been plucked. The plucking was generally carried out by the women of the household. The plucked carcasses would be sent to market, and <b>the</b> <b>feathers</b> would be sold direct to London dealers.|$|E
