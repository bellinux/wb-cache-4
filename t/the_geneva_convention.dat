5|$|At its peak, {{the camp}} held 8,000American {{soldiers}} (along {{with a small}} number of soldiers and civilians from other nations including the United Kingdom, Norway, and the Netherlands), making it the largest POW camp in the Philippines. This number dropped significantly as able-bodied soldiers were shipped to other areas in the Philippines, Japan, Japanese-occupied Taiwan, and Manchukuo to work in slave labor camps. As Japan had not yet ratified <b>the</b> <b>Geneva</b> <b>Convention,</b> the POWs were transported out of the camp and forced to work in factories to build Japanese weaponry, unload ships, and repair airfields.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to these first-person accounts, she also incorporates court reports and testimony in her research.

Portions of the book are addressed to parents and provide resources and advice on how to select better choices instead of programs in the tough love teen industry, and the book includes an appendix aimed at educating parents on how to find help for their teenagers.|$|E
5|$|In late 1953, the United States Senate Committee on Government Operations, led by Joseph McCarthy, {{conducted}} {{an investigation of}} up to 1,800 reported incidents of war crimes allegedly committed throughout the Korean War.

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Geneva</b> <b>Conventions</b> {{guarantee}} combatants <b>the</b> {{right not}} {{to be put on}} trial for fighting in a war - unless they commit a war crime (a grave breach) or other crime (e.g., captured behind enemy lines out of proper uniforms or insignia while carrying out espionage or sabotage operations). Most held under <b>the</b> <b>Geneva</b> <b>Conventions</b> are not accused of a crime and therefore it would be a war crime under <b>the</b> <b>Geneva</b> <b>Conventions</b> to give them a trial. This protection against getting a trial is fully consistent with human rights law because human rights law prohibits putting people on trial when there is no crime to try them for. <b>The</b> <b>Geneva</b> <b>Conventions</b> however guarantee that anyone charged with a war crime or other crime must get a fair trial.|$|R

5|$|Most French {{prisoners of}} war were not held in camps {{for most of the}} war, but instead, over 93 percent of French {{prisoners of war}} lived and worked on Kommandos of work details. Under the terms of <b>the</b> <b>Geneva</b> <b>Convention</b> NCOs were, like officers, {{exempted}} from work during captivity, but Germans often forced them to work. Workers were fed but virtually their entire wages were paid directly to the German army and prisoners were only allowed to retain 70 pfennigs per day.|$|E
5|$|The Behar {{survivors}} were maltreated {{by members}} of Tones crew.

5|$|In his roles at the ICTY and ICTR he had {{to design}} prosecutorial {{strategies}} for both those ground-breaking tribunals, from scratch. In doing so, he sought to be scrupulously even-handed – a goal he was more easily able to achieve at ICTY than at ICTR. He built his strategy at both courts {{to a large degree}} on that pursued by the prosecutors at the Nuremberg Tribunal of 1945–46. He served as the chief prosecutor of the two tribunals until September 1996. Among his most notable legal achievements as chief prosecutor was securing the recognition of rape as a war crime under <b>the</b> <b>Geneva</b> <b>Convention.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{city was}} well {{organized}} for defense, {{and in the}} Battle for Brest Middleton's units went about capturing it methodically. The defense {{of the city was}} under German Generalleutnant Hermann Ramcke with whom Middleton carried on a dialog during the siege. Ramcke sent Middleton a map showing where several hundred American prisoners were being held in the city, but also slyly placed on the map a number of red crosses where the Allies knew some good bombing targets were located, such as ammunition depots. Middleton wrote back to Ramcke telling him to remove some of the bogus red crosses, or some terms of <b>the</b> <b>Geneva</b> <b>Convention</b> might have to be ignored. Middleton also reminded Ramcke of the Allies' superior artillery and air power.|$|E
5|$|Ambulances {{may also}} carry an emblem (either {{as part of}} the passive warning {{markings}} or not), such as a Red Cross, Red Crescent or Red Crystal (collective known as the Protective Symbols). These are symbols laid down by <b>the</b> <b>Geneva</b> <b>Convention,</b> and all countries signatory to it agree to restrict their use to either (1) Military Ambulances or (2) the national Red Cross or Red Crescent society. Use by any other person, organization or agency is in breach of international law. The protective symbols are designed to indicate to all people (especially combatants in the case of war) that the vehicle is neutral and is not to be fired upon, hence giving protection to the medics and their casualties, although this has not always been adhered to. In Israel, Magen David Adom, the Red Cross member organization use a red Star of David, but this does not have recognition beyond Israeli borders, where they must use the Red Crystal.|$|E
