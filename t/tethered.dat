5|$|Hunting with cheetahs {{became more}} {{prevalent}} toward the seventh centuryAD. In the Middle East, the cheetah would accompany the nobility to hunts in special seats behind saddles. Cheetahs {{continued to be}} associated with royalty and elegance in western Asia till as late as the 19th century. The first phase of taming would take several weeks, in which the cheetah would be kept <b>tethered</b> and made to get accustomed to human beings. Next, the cheetah would be tempted with food and trained to mount horses. Finally, its hunting instincts would be aroused by slaughtering animals before it. The whole process could take as long as a year to complete. In eastern Asia, the records are confusing as regional names for the leopard and the cheetah may be used interchangeably. The earliest depiction of cheetahs from eastern Asia dates back to the Tang dynasty (7th to 10th centuriesAD); paintings depict <b>tethered</b> cheetahs as well as cheetahs mounted on horses. Chinese emperors would use cheetahs, as well as caracals, as gifts. In the 13th and the 14th centuries, the Yuan rulers bought numerous caracals, cheetahs, and tigers from the western parts of the empire and Muslim merchants, in return for gold, silver, cash, and silk. According to the Ming Shilu, the subsequent Ming dynasty (14th to 17th centuries) continued this practice. The cheetah gradually entered Eurasia toward the 14th century, though they never became as popular as they had in the Middle East. The Mughal ruler Akbar the Great (1556–1605) is said to have kept as many as 1000 cheetahs. However, his son Jahangir wrote in his memoirs, Tuzk-e-Jahangiri, that only one of them gave birth to cubs. Mughal rulers trained cheetahs as well as caracals in a similar way as the West Asians, and used them to hunt gameespecially blackbuck. The rampant hunting severely affected the populations of wild animals.|$|E

50|$|Momentum Exchange <b>Tethers</b> {{are one of}} many {{applications}} for space <b>tethers.</b> Momentum Exchange <b>Tethers</b> come in two types; rotating and non-rotating. A rotating <b>tether</b> will create a controlled force on the end-masses of the system due to centrifugal acceleration. While the <b>tether</b> system rotates, the objects on {{either end of the}} <b>tether</b> will experience continuous acceleration; the magnitude of the acceleration depends on the length of the <b>tether</b> and the rotation rate. Momentum exchange occurs when an end body is released during the rotation. The transfer of momentum to the released object will cause the rotating <b>tether</b> to lose energy, and thus lose velocity and altitude. However, using electrodynamic <b>tether</b> thrusting, or ion propulsion the system can then re-boost itself with little or no expenditure of consumable reaction mass.|$|R
40|$|A <b>tether</b> of {{sufficient}} strength, {{capable of being}} lengthened or shortened and having appropriate apparatuses for capturing and releasing bodies at its ends, {{may be useful in}} propulsion applications. For example, a <b>tether</b> could allow rendezvous between spacecraft in substantially different orbits without using propellant. A <b>tether</b> could also allow co-orbiting spacecraft to exchange momentum and separate. Thus, a reentering spacecraft (such as the Shuttle) could give its momentum to one remaining on orbit (such as the space station). Similarly, a <b>tether</b> facility could gain momentum from a high I(sub sp) /low thrust mechanism (which could be an electrodynamics <b>tether)</b> and transfer than momentum by means of a <b>tether</b> to payloads headed for many different orbits. Such a facility would, in effect, combine high I(sub sp) with high thrust, although only briefly. An electrodynamic <b>tether</b> could propel a satellite from its launch inclination to a higher or lower inclination. <b>Tethers</b> could also allow samples to be taken from bodies such as the Moon. Three types of <b>tether</b> operations are illustrated. The following topics are discussed: (1) <b>tether</b> characteristics; (2) <b>tether</b> propulsion methods [...] basics, via momentum transfer, and electrodynamic <b>tether</b> propulsion; and (3) their use in planetary exploration...|$|R
40|$|This paper proposes utilising the {{distributed}} Lorentz {{forces that}} are induced in an electromagnetic <b>tether</b> as a control actuator for controlling the <b>tether</b> motion. The control input governing {{the magnitude of the}} applied actuator force is the current being conducted within the <b>tether.</b> A wave-absorping controller is also proposed to suppress the unstable high order modes that tend to be initiated by electromagnetic forces. The absorption of travelling waves along the <b>tether</b> may be achieved by proper movement of the <b>tether</b> attachment point on the main satellite. A mission function control law is presented for controlling the <b>tether</b> length and in- and out-of-plane librations, derived from a model that treats the <b>tether</b> as an inextensible rigid rod. The control law is numerically simulated in a continuum model of the <b>tether</b> system. It is shown that the out-of-plane motion of the <b>tether</b> can be effectively damped by appropriate control of the <b>tether</b> current for inclined orbits. The effect of <b>tether</b> flexibility does not significantly alter the time history of the <b>tether</b> librations, but causes significant bowing that grows into instability of the lateral modes. It is shown that this instability can be effectively suppressed by applying the proposed waveabsorbing controller...|$|R

40|$|The ProSEDS {{conductive}} <b>tether</b> design incorporates {{two distinct}} types of <b>tethers</b> from a plasma interaction viewpoint. The 200 m {{closest to the}} Delta 11 spacecraft is insulated from the plasma, and the remaining 5000 m is semi-bare. This latter portion is semi-bare {{because it has a}} conductive coating applied to the wires to permit electron collection while also regulating the overall <b>tether</b> temperature. Because the <b>tether</b> possesses these two distinct types of <b>tethers,</b> a transition point exists between the two types that form a triple point with the space plasma. Insulated <b>tethers</b> can suffer from a second plasma interaction if the insulation is weakened or breached, such as by pinholes caused by small particle debris strikes.

Volunteer testing was performed with 37 subjects on 16 different vehicles using 2 forward-facing child restraints (Britax Marathon 70 or the Evenflo Triumph), with each subject performing 8 child restraint installations {{on a set}} of four vehicles. Vehicles were selected to provide a variety of general <b>tether</b> locations (filler panel, upper seatback, lower seatback, floor, or roof), as well as a variety of recommended <b>tether</b> routings with respect to the head restraint: under, over, around. Simple instruction regarding the LATCH system was provided after the fourth trial. Subjects used the <b>tether</b> in 89 % of the 294 forward-facing trials and attached the <b>tether</b> correctly in 57 % of installations. Subjects were more likely to use the <b>tether</b> if they were less than age 40, had previous <b>tether</b> experience, if the <b>tether</b> was located on a filler panel, and if the vehicle did not have any potentially confusing hardware. In addition, <b>tether</b> use was 83 % in the first four trials and increased to 95 % in the last four trials after instruction was provided. Subjects had the greatest difficulty in the pickup truck, which use loops of webbing as a router for the installed position and the <b>tether</b> anchor for the adjacent position; the <b>tether</b> was attached correctly in only 11 percent of installations. <b>Tethers</b> {{were more likely to be}} used when the <b>tether</b> anchor was located on the filler panel of sedans, which had a use rate of 95 percent, compared to when the anchor was located on the floor, roof, or seatback, which had use rates ranging from 79 to 89 percent. <b>Tethers</b> were less likely to be attached correctly when there was potentially confusing hardware present, 47 percent, compared to 70 percent. In addition, <b>tether</b> anchors located on the filler panel or mid seatback had higher rates of correct attachment, 60 and 69 percent, respectively, than those on the floor, roof, or lower seatback, which all had correct attachment rates lower than 50 percent. No vehicle <b>tether</b> hardware characteristics or vehicle manual directions were associated specifically with correct <b>tether</b> routing and head restraint position. Installations involving the single <b>tether</b> strap were 10 times as likely to have the <b>tether</b> attached correctly and 1. 7 times as likely to be routed correctly and have the head restraint positioned correctly, compared with installations with the v-shaped <b>tether.</b> Lack of instruction in most vehicle owner’s manuals regarding the routing of a V-style <b>tether</b> more challenging to use. With the single strap-style <b>tether,</b> it was more straightforward to have the <b>tether</b> strap flat and pull it tight, as well as to route it as directed. With the V-style <b>tether,</b> the adjustment hardware was often located underneath or close to the head restraint when installed in the vehicle, making it difficult to tighten. Recommendations to reduce <b>tether</b> misuse include labeling <b>tether</b> anchors, eliminating confusing hardware, allowing any head restraint position (including removal), providing instruction for routing V-style <b>tethers,</b> allowing options in <b>tether</b> routing, and redesigning <b>tether</b> anchors/routers found in pickup trucks...|$|R
