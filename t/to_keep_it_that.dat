Marcus also told Earp's biographers and others that Earp never drank, did not own gambling saloons, and that he never provided prostitutes to customers, although strong evidence to the contrary exists.|$|E

The label ran into difficulty {{over the use of}} the Museo del Prado-owned painting, which was incorrectly perceived in the US as being anti-religious, featuring immoral scenes, and was thus rejected or poorly stocked by many record shops. The original painting is in colour although it appeared on the LP in monochrome due to a printing error for the original layout and the band opted <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> way. Another section of the same Bosch painting (in colour) had previously been used as an album cover two years before by Pearls Before Swine on their debut One Nation Underground.|$|E

[...] The two characters went on to have a brief sexual relationship, resulting in Connie becoming pregnant with Sam's child. Once the revelation of Connie's pregnancy had been made, Chambers asserted of the tension between the separated couple: [...] "Some of the scenes with Connie work amazingly well because we do genuinely get worked up and we like <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> way until filming is finished. It's a useful tip to let the frustrations come through in your work - it makes good viewing." ...|$|E

In 1953, with the tour in Atlanta, there was controversy over [...] "You've Got to Be Carefully Taught". [...] Two Georgia state legislators, Senator John D. Shepard and Representative David C. Jones, objected to the song, stating that though South Pacific was a fine piece of entertainment, that song [...] "contained an underlying philosophy inspired by Moscow", and explained, [...] "Intermarriage produces half-breeds.

[...] They stated that they planned to introduce legislation to outlaw such communist-inspired works. The Northern press had a field day; Hammerstein, when asked for comment, responded {{that he did not}} think the legislators were representing their constituents very well, and that he was surprised at the suggestion that anything kind and decent must necessarily originate in Moscow. In part because of the song, touring companies of South Pacific had difficulty getting bookings in the Deep South.|$|E

After Wyatt died in 1929, Josephine traveled to Boston, Massachusetts to try to persuade the publisher to stop the release of the book. Although the biography became a bestseller, it was later strongly criticized for fictionalizing Earp's life and was found to be markedly inaccurate. As late as 1936, Josephine took legal action to suppress certain details of her and Wyatt's life in Tombstone. During those later years of her life, in addition to burnishing the life and legend of husband Wyatt Earp, [...] "she scripted a history of make believe to hide a number of things of which she was not terribly proud." ...|$|E

It had only refused to do so once previously, in 1984. Towards the end of 1998 the Parliament's Committee on Budgetary Control initially refused to discharge the community's budget for 1996 over what it saw as the arrogance of the Commission in its refusal to answer questions relating to financial mismanagement. Paul van Buitenen, a whistle-blower working in the Commission, had sent the Parliament a report alleging that widespread fraud and cover ups, stating: [...] "I found strong indications that [...] [...] [...] auditors have been hindered in their investigations and that officials received instructions to obstruct the audit examinations [...] [...] [...] The commission is a closed culture and they want <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> way, and my objective is to open it up, to create more transparency and to put power where it belongs – and that's in the democratically-elected European Parliament."

He tried <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>it</b> up <b>that</b> <b>to</b> belong to the working class was a thoroughly jolly thing--for those who were used to <b>it.</b> He declared <b>that</b> all who wanted to alter our laws or our ideas about property or our methods of production were envious and base and all who wanted any change between the sexes, foolish or vicious. He tried to go on disposing of socialists, agitators, feminists, women's suffragists, educationists and every sort of reformer with a good-humoured contempt. And he found an increasing difficulty in keeping his contempt sufficiently good-humoured. Instead of laughing down at folly and failure, he had moments when he felt that he was rather laughing up--a little wryly--at monstrous things impending. And since ideas are things of atmosphere and the spirit, insidious wolves of the soul, they crept up to him and gnawed the insides out of him even as he posed as their manful antagonist.|$|R

2500|$|First, the Information and Consultation of Employees Regulations 2004, require {{undertakings}} with 50 or {{more employees}} to inform and consult on probable {{developments in the}} enterprise, changes to job structures, and contract changes - especially redundancies. Employees must voluntarily initiate an [...] "information and consultation procedure". If they do, but employers cannot find a negotiated agreement, a [...] "standard procedure" [...] model requires between 2 and 25 elected employee representatives having {{the right to be}} consulted on an ongoing basis: that is, an elected work council. A negotiated agreement can cover more issues than the model (for instance, to integrate health and safety issues in one council) if the parties choose. Crucially, consultation is not merely an exercise in management telling staff about their decisions, but requires meaningful dialogue [...] "with a view to reaching an agreement". This is [...] "an obligation to negotiate", similar to a duty to bargain in good faith. To start a procedure, at least 15 employees or 10 per cent of staff (whichever is higher) can request it. Occasionally, there could be a [...] "pre-existing" [...] council, or procedure in writing, covering all employees. If so, if it is not as good as the new method requested, and if the employer wants <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> way, a ballot must be held where over 50 per cent of staff favour a new procedure. For example, in Stewart v Moray Council, after 500 teachers requested a new procedure (over 10 per cent of staff, but under 40 per cent), the employer argued that a ballot had to be held, because the existing collective agreement with the union had a protocol on information and consultation. The Employment Appeal Tribunal, rejecting the employer's claim, held the pre-existing procedure was not good enough to force a ballot, because it did not explain how the views of staff would be sought. Employer currently face penalties up to £75,000 for failure to comply with the rules, though it is far from clear this is sufficient to ensure an [...] "effective remedy" [...] under EU law.|$|E
