5|$|Several {{terrestrial}} starlings, {{including those}} in the genus Sturnus, have adaptations of the skull and muscles that help with feeding by probing. This adaptation is most strongly developed in the common starling (along with the spotless and white-cheeked starlings), where the protractor muscles responsible for opening the jaw are enlarged and the skull is narrow, allowing the eye to be moved forward to peer {{down the length of}} the bill. This technique involves inserting the bill into the ground and opening it as a way of searching for hidden food items. Common starlings have the physical traits <b>that</b> <b>enable</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> use this feeding technique, which has undoubtedly helped the species spread far and wide.|$|E

25|$|In the United States, {{suburban}} infrastructure evolved {{during an}} age of relatively easy access to fossil fuels, {{which has led to}} transportation-dependent systems of living. Zoning reforms that allow greater urban density as well as designs for walking and bicycling can greatly reduce energy consumed for transportation.

25|$|However, trauma differs between individuals, {{according}} to their subjective experiences. People will react to similar events differently. In other words, not all people who experience a potentially traumatic event will actually become psychologically traumatized. This discrepancy in risk rate {{can be attributed to}} protective factors some individuals may have <b>that</b> <b>enable</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> cope with trauma, they are related to temperamental and environmental factors. Some examples are mild exposure to stress early in life, resilience characteristics, and active seeking of help.|$|E
25|$|Pure {{water is}} usually {{described}} as tasteless and odorless, although humans have specific sensors that {{can feel the}} presence of water in their mouths, and frogs {{are known to be}} able to smell it. However, water from ordinary sources (including bottled mineral water) usually has many dissolved substances, that may give it varying tastes and odors. Humans and other animals have developed senses <b>that</b> <b>enable</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> evaluate the potability of water by avoiding water that is too salty or putrid.|$|E

These microorganisms may survive exposure to such conditions for weeks, months, years, or even centuries. Extremophiles are microbial life forms that thrive outside the ranges where life is commonly found. They excel at exploiting uncommon sources of energy. While all organisms are composed of nearly identical molecules, evolution has enabled such microbes {{to cope with this}} wide range of physical and chemical conditions. Characterization of the structure and metabolic diversity of microbial communities in such extreme environments is ongoing.|$|E

They are immune to mortal weapons in either form. Types of Demons include standard and succubi.|$|E
25|$|Photography and {{videography}} are the mainstays of recording, {{which has}} become much more convenient with the advent of reasonably priced digital still and HD video cameras. Cameras, including video cameras can be provided with special underwater housings <b>that</b> <b>enable</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> be used for underwater videography. Low visibility underwater and distortion of image due to refraction mean that perspective photographs can be difficult to obtain. However, it is possible to take a series of photographs at adjacent points and then combined into a single photomontage or photomosaic image of the whole site. 3D photogrammetry has also become a very popular way to image underwater cultural materials and shipwreck sites.|$|E
500|$|They are {{aggressive}} and fearless birds, and although only [...] in length, they will attack much larger species that enter their nesting territory, including crows and birds of prey.

500|$|Although {{well behind}} the insects, chelicerates {{are one of}} the most diverse groups of animals, with over 77,000 living species that have been {{described}} in scientific publications. Some estimates suggest that there may be 130,000 undescribed species of spider and nearly 500,000 undescribed species of mites and ticks. While the earliest chelicerates and the living Pycnogonida (if they are chelicerates) and Xiphosura are marine animals that breathe dissolved oxygen, the vast majority of living species are air-breathers, although a few spider species build [...] "diving bell" [...] webs <b>that</b> <b>enable</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> live under water. Like their ancestors, most living chelicerates are carnivores, mainly on small invertebrates. However, many species feed as parasites, herbivores, scavengers and detritivores.|$|E
500|$|According to a {{reviewer}} at California Newsreel, [...] "Few musical {{groups have}} expressed so eloquently or consistently {{the aspirations of}} their people as the Malagasy septet Mahaleo."

[...] A Radio France Internationale journalist asserts, [...] "In the highlands of Madagascar, building a bonfire without playing or singing Mahaleo seems quite simply inconceivable, so strongly has this group's musical repertoire taken hold in Malagasy people's hearts." ...|$|E
500|$|Battles {{take place}} on a grid-based battlefield, with turns being given for players and enemies. During an attack, the view {{transitions}} from a top-down perspective to a third-person view. Environments and terrain vary between levels, ranging from mountainous regions to flatlands. A unique ability members of each kingdom's royal family have {{is the ability to}} use Dragon Veins, which are special map tiles <b>that</b> <b>enable</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> alter the environment in favor of their side. Like previous games in the series, Fire Emblem Fates features a [...] "weapon triangle" [...] - a system where certain weapons have advantages over others. However, in Fates the triangle differs from previous installments, with swords and magic defeating axes and bows, axes and bows besting lances and hidden weapons, and lances and hidden weapons overpowering swords and magic. Weapons in Fates do not have a limited number of uses before they break; instead, stronger weapons will lower some of the user's abilities. For instance, while the Brave Sword allows its user to attack twice, it also lowers their defense and magic defense stats.|$|E

2500|$|Sama-Bajau {{are also}} noted for their {{exceptional}} abilities in free-diving, with physical adaptations <b>that</b> <b>enable</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> see better and dive longer underwater.

Some Bajau intentionally rupture their eardrums {{at an early age}} to facilitate diving and hunting at sea. Many older Sama-Bajau are therefore hard of hearing. Sama-Bajau women also use a traditional sun-protecting powder called burak or borak, made from water weeds, rice and spices.|$|E
2500|$|On July 13, 2017, Romero {{released}} the first poster for Road of the Dead and discussed the plot {{for the movie}} saying [...] "it's set in a sanctuary city where this fat cat runs a haven for rich folks, {{and one of the}} things that he does is stage drag races to entertain them," [...] Romero told Rue Morgue. [...] "There's a scientist there doing genetic experiments, trying to make the zombies stop eating us, and he has discovered that with a little tampering, they can recall certain memory skills <b>that</b> <b>enable</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> drive in these races. It's really The Fast and the Furious with zombies". Romero died three days later, and the status of the film is currently unknown.|$|E

2500|$|Another {{important}} pedagogical {{feature of}} GCE is learning through communicative practices {{outside the classroom}} that [...] "harness [...] the educational force of the wider culture". If students are encouraged [...] "to see themselves as political agents", educators assume {{they are more likely}} to acquire the knowledge, skills and abilities <b>that</b> <b>enable</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> [...] become agents of change. Another important element of the student-centered participatory nature of GCED, is that students, through their engagement with others via Social Network Services, create their own forms of global citizenship through dialogue, learning, and action. This is [...] an important element, for example, in the activities of grassroots organizations like 'GIN' (Global Issues Network), which involves students and teachers in projects that address global issues such as human rights, trade rules, and deforestation. Such student-driven, student-led projects combine both the 'global consciousness' and 'global competence' aspects of GCED.|$|E
2500|$|The primary {{behaviour}} {{to distinguish}} the saltwater crocodile from other crocodiles is its tendency to occupy salt water. Though other crocodiles also have salt glands <b>that</b> <b>enable</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> survive in saltwater, a trait which alligators do not possess, most other species do not venture out to sea except during extreme conditions. The only other species to display regular seagoing behaviour is the American crocodile (C. acutus), but the American version is still {{not considered to be}} as marine-prone as the saltwater crocodile. As its alternate name [...] "sea-going crocodile" [...] implies, this species travels between areas separated by sea, or simply relies on the relative ease of travelling through water in order to circumvent long distances on the same land mass, such as Australia. In a similar fashion to migratory birds using thermal columns, saltwater crocodiles use ocean currents to travel long distances. In a study, 20 crocodiles were tagged with satellite transmitters; 8 of these crocodiles ventured out into open ocean, in which one of them travelled [...] along the coast â from the North Kennedy River on eastern coast of Far North Queensland, around Cape York Peninsula, to the west coast in the Gulf of Carpentaria â in 25 days. Another specimen, a -long male, travelled [...] in 20 days. Without having to move around much, sometimes simply by floating, the current-riding behaviour allows for the conservation of energy. They will even interrupt their travels, residing in sheltered bays for a few days, when the current is against the desired direction of travel, until the current changes direction. Crocodiles also travel up and down in river systems, periodically.|$|E
