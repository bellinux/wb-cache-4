5|$|Non-reductive Physicalism is {{the view}} that mental {{properties}} form a separate ontological class <b>to</b> <b>physical</b> properties: mental states (such as qualia) are not reducible <b>to</b> <b>physical</b> states.

5|$|In 1865, Cancellor's {{death was}} used in a medical journal article {{discussing}} adult hydrocephalus. Despite Willis' statement that Cancellor had no pre-existing medical condition that would have caused or contributed to his death, author Samuel Wilks suggested not only that Cancellor had hydrocephalus, {{but that he was}} consequently more susceptible <b>to</b> <b>physical</b> injury as a result. He pointed to the autopsy finding of fluid in Cancellor's brain to support his assertions and argued that this effusion would have caused physical weakness.|$|E
5|$|In Hubbard's {{efforts to}} shift from a psychotherapeutic to a spiritual program, he {{introduced}} the concept of thetans: a set of godlike, non-corporeal entities capable of creating and shaping universes, later trapped in the MEST and confined, by reincarnation, <b>to</b> <b>physical</b> bodies. Hugh Urban of Ohio State University states that these teachings bear similarities to Gnosticism, although he doubts that Hubbard was well versed in Gnostic thought.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} whether adherence <b>to</b> a lifestyle <b>physical</b> activity intervention predicted weekly participation {{in at least}} 150 min of moderate <b>to</b> vigorous <b>physical</b> activity among 244 sedentary healthy adults.

Markers of adherence were attendance, homework completion, and self-monitoring for a group-based intervention and telephone call completion, homework completion, and self-monitoring for a telephone and mail-delivered intervention. For both interventions, adherence significantly predicted moderate <b>to</b> vigorous <b>physical</b> activity. Adherence <b>to</b> lifestyle <b>physical</b> activity interventions ought to be encouraged to increase the likelihood that participants will engage in an adequate amount of physical activity for health benefits to occur...|$|R

5|$|The first French Spaniel is speculated to have {{appeared}} following the Crusades of the 11th century, {{and it was}} these breeds of dogs that were described in Gaston III of Foix-Béarn's 14th-century work Livre de Chasse.

This in turn meant that the pre-existing French Spaniel split into several types specific to their own regions, which were classified according <b>to</b> <b>physical</b> appearance and hunting abilities.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} the relationship between motor skill competence, and physical activity in 8 – 9 years-old girls (N= 352).

Regression analysis revealed that locomotor proficiency accounted for 20 % (P = 0. 001) of variance associated with self-reported moderate <b>to</b> vigorous <b>physical</b> activity.

5|$|As medical {{professionals}} become better {{informed about the}} interdependent relationship between physical, emotional, social, and spiritual pain, and the demonstrated benefit <b>to</b> <b>physical</b> pain from alleviation of these other forms of suffering, they may be inclined to question the patient and family about interpersonal relationships.

5|$|Booth {{was then}} {{selected}} for the Ashes tour of England in 1961; he and Victorian opening batsmen Bill Lawry, the two uncapped batsmen in the team, were regarded as the last two players chosen. Booth quickly gained a reputation for his attention <b>to</b> <b>physical</b> fitness. He led the Australians in their morning exercises during the sea voyage, which captain Richie Benaud made optional. After scoring 37 and seven against Worcestershire in his first match on English soil, Booth broke through for his first century for Australia, scoring 113 against Cambridge University in his fifth match in England. He made 59 against the Marylebone Cricket Club, but was overlooked {{for the first three}} Tests.|$|E
5|$|Crisis Core uses a {{real-time}} {{combat system}} in which the player can move Zack around, initiate attacks, special abilities and spells, use items, and block or dodge attacks. Zack's abilities in battle are set by what materia he currently has equipped. Up to six materia can be equipped at any one time, which can impart special attacks, magic spells, or passive bonuses such as health increases or the ability to display the statistics of the current foe in combat. Materia are gained throughout the game through exploration, as rewards from side missions, as spoils of battle, or from shops. Materia can be fused together to make more powerful versions with improved bonuses; for example, fusing an attack materia with an elemental magic materia can create a new attack skill materia that inflicts elemental magic damage in addition <b>to</b> <b>physical</b> damage. Special items collected in the game can also be used in materia fusion to further increase the materia's power.|$|E

5|$|Doubt {{about the}} {{possibility}} of a mechanistic explanation of thought drove René Descartes, and most other philosophers along with him, to dualism: the belief that the mind is to some degree independent of the brain. There has always, however, been a strong argument in the opposite direction. There is clear empirical evidence that physical manipulations of, or injuries to, the brain (for example by drugs or by lesions, respectively) can affect the mind in potent and intimate ways. In the 19th century, the case of Phineas Gage, a railway worker who was injured by a stout iron rod passing through his brain, convinced both researchers and the public that cognitive functions were localised in the brain. Following this line of thinking, a large body of empirical evidence for a close relationship between brain activity and mental activity has led most neuroscientists and contemporary philosophers to be materialists, believing that mental phenomena are ultimately the result of, or reducible <b>to,</b> <b>physical</b> phenomena.|$|E
5|$|During the Chou Dynasty, {{the upper}} class {{considered}} daughters-in-law as commodities of the husband's parents, not the husbands. This meant that wives had to be subservient to parents-in-law. They were expected to have impeccable manners, including refraining from coughing and sneezing {{in the presence of}} their husbands' parents. Wives could not leave their rooms or accept gifts from relatives without permission. Refusal to turn gifts over to parents-in-law lead <b>to</b> <b>physical</b> abuse and expulsion from the family. In addition, wives were required to serve in-laws, including helping them bathe, arranging their bedding, and cooking. People placed a strong emphasis on food preparation in Ancient China. Cooking {{was one of the most}} time-consuming tasks for wives because of traditional rituals and high expectations for the taste and appeal of food.|$|E
5|$|In New Jersey, {{increasing}} winds caused blowing and drifting of {{the snow}} and led to near-blizzard conditions. Behind the storm, very cold and gusty weather lingered. New Jersey Transit shut down bus service in northern portions of the state, and rail lines had 20-minute delays. Most injuries in the state were related <b>to</b> <b>physical</b> strain while shoveling, snow blower accidents or slips and falls. As the snowfall was of a light nature, few trees limbs and electrical wires were downed by the storm. GPU Energy reported only around 5,500 power outages. A countywide state of emergency was declared in Sussex County, as vehicles were sliding off roadways. Several other traffic accidents and delays were reported throughout the state, and in Somerset County, a few roads were closed due to the snow. A Red Cross shelter was opened for residents of a Spotswood trailer park.|$|E
