5000|$|The {{earliest}} reliable {{date for}} the <b>wheeled</b> <b>plough</b> in the Danish region is from the 11th century, at the location Sønder Vium.Hoff comment that [...] "These sporadic ploughmarks give no information on the structure and function of the agricultural system." ...|$|R
50|$|In {{the same}} section ("Agricultural systems") Hoff gathers textual {{evidence}} from the Danish landscape laws indicate usage of the <b>wheeled</b> <b>plough,</b> but also a terminological uncertainty that is later resolved - i.e. reflecting a time of transition.The period of transition is not exactly determined by Hoff, but the period 12th-14th century may be suggested.|$|R
60|$|They rode on in silence. No {{one had a}} mind to speak, and the mournful soughing of {{the wind}} in the pine-trees seemed to check the words on every lip. The dull thud of hoofs in the soft road, the clang of steel bits and buckles, the {{snorting}} of the horses alone answered the wind, and also the monotonous creaking of the <b>wheels</b> <b>ploughing</b> through the ruts.|$|R
60|$|There was no trail. All {{before was}} red sand, hollows, slopes, levels, dunes, {{in which the}} horses sank above their fetlocks. The <b>wheels</b> <b>ploughed</b> deep, and little red streams trailed down from the tires. Naab trudged on foot with the reins in his hands. Hare essayed to walk also, soon tired, and floundered behind till Naab ordered him to ride again. Twilight came with the horses still toiling.|$|R
50|$|Ploughing too was a {{communal}} affair. The heavy <b>wheeled</b> <b>plough</b> needed for northern soils was expensive, as were horses or oxen {{to pull it}} so a team of horses and plough worked successive strips of an open field for different peasants. The long narrow shape of the strips reflected the difficulty of turning the team at each end. In addition to the open fields, each village or manor had common land where peasants had right to graze cattle, collect wood, cut turf and at times catch fish.|$|R
25|$|The {{upper parts}} of the frame carry (from the front) the {{coupling}} for the motive power (horses), the coulter and the landside frame. Depending {{on the size of}} the implement, and the number of furrows it is designed to plough at one time, a forecarriage with a wheel or wheels (known as a furrow wheel and support wheel) may be added to support the frame (<b>wheeled</b> <b>plough).</b> In the case of a single-furrow plough there is only one wheel at the front and handles at the rear for the ploughman to steer and manoeuvre it.|$|R
40|$|There is various type of {{controller}} that {{able to use}} {{in control}} a balancing of <b>two</b> <b>wheels</b> mobile robot. In term to control the <b>two</b> <b>wheels</b> mobile robot, there are four criteria’s that need to consider. The four criteria’s that control the balancing of <b>two</b> <b>wheels</b> mobile robot are position, speed, angle, and angle rate. From state space equation, <b>two</b> <b>wheels</b> mobile robot is presented using MATLAB application. Linear quadratic regulator (LQR) and Pole place are designed to control the balancing of <b>two</b> <b>wheels</b> mobile robot. Disturbance is applied to angle rate to test the balancing of robot. Simulation on MATLAB application is analyzed and the LQR and Pole placement controller performance are compared {{to find out the}} best controller for <b>two</b> <b>wheels</b> mobile robot model...|$|R

The {{finite element model}} of <b>two</b> <b>wheels</b> scooter is generated. Finite element analysis of driving system on <b>two</b> <b>wheels</b> scooter is investigated. The stress and strain of driving system is investigated. The stress diagram and the strain diagram are obtained. The method and {{the result can be}} used as a reference of innovative design of <b>two</b> <b>wheels</b> scooter...|$|R
5000|$|Instead of {{the normal}} {{emergency}} procedure of a belly landing, pilot Herron attempted a conventional wheels-down landing {{on a patch of}} flat terrain that [...] "looked like a meadow" [...] on {{the southern end of the}} island. Whilst he was successful in executing the three-point landing, the appearance of flat, solid ground on Kiriwina turned out to be deceptive; it was actually a bog. The nose <b>wheel</b> <b>ploughed</b> into the marsh, the front strut ripped loose, and the Plexiglas nose of the Marauder buried itself in the muck, causing the bomber to flip over onto its back.|$|R
5000|$|The wellknown Viking {{settlement}} of Danelagen (Danelaw) {{testify to the}} enduring presence of Scandinavians on the British Isles from the 9th century onwards {{and the idea of}} Viking settlers introducing the <b>wheeled</b> <b>plough</b> may well be one of the possible congruencies of history.Hoffs evaluation [...] of the Danish landscape laws take in many aspects. In the section [...] "The cultivated land", subsection [...] "Agricultural systems" [...] (Der bewirtschaftete Boden, Anbausysteme) Hoff draw up lines of agricultural development stemming a period of circa 1000 years (2nd - 12th century)—regions mentioned include Denmark, the Netherlands, North-West Germany and England.|$|R
50|$|Some hockey skates {{and other}} skates include a HiLo setup. HiLo setups {{resemble}} a flat setup in that all 4 wheels touch {{the ground at}} the same time. Unlike a flat setup, however, different wheel sizes are used. The front <b>two</b> <b>wheels</b> will be smaller than the back <b>two</b> <b>wheels.</b> This is possible because of the location of the axles on the frame itself. One example is a Bauer frame that has <b>two</b> <b>wheels</b> in the front that are 76mm and <b>two</b> <b>wheels</b> in the back that are 80mm.|$|R

50|$|Five {{people were}} killed and many others injured in an {{accident}} at Aligarh railway station on Sunday evening (19 June 2011). The accident took place when a goods train was passing a crowded platform. According to officials, a brake lever snapped from the train and the <b>wheel</b> <b>ploughed</b> into passengers waiting at the platform. There were many people waiting for the Delhi-Tundla passenger train on the platform. The hand brake and the connecting rod had come loose and the protruding object turned deadly for the victims. While two people died on the spot, three others succumbed to their injuries in hospital. At least six other injured people were admitted to Aligarh Muslim University Medical College Hospital.|$|R

25|$|Throughout {{this century}} {{there was also}} a rapid growth of the rural population, {{resulting}} in a larger force of farm labor which consequently allowed the great monasteries to develop new agricultural lands. This, coupled with the improvement of farming equipment and techniques, such as the introduction of the heavy <b>wheeled</b> <b>plough,</b> resulted in an increase in productivity that impacted the people's lifestyles. The distribution of this increased productivity between peasants and lords was regulated by the establishment of foros or lifelong contracts, frequently spanning several generations or vozes. The economic and social transformations led to profound changes in mindset. In the towns, it initiated a religious and intellectual renewal under the mendicant orders, most notably the Franciscans, who instituted social reforms.|$|R
