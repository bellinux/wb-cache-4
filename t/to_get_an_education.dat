5|$|In 1941, the University of Oklahoma and Norman city {{officials}} established Max Westheimer Field, a university airstrip, and then leased {{it to the}} U.S. Navy as a Naval Flight Training Center in 1942. The training center was used for training combat pilots during World War II. A second training center, known as Naval Air Technical Training Center, and a naval hospital were later established to the south. In the years following World War II the airstrip was transferred back to the university's control. Today the airstrip is called the University of Oklahoma Westheimer Airport. Following the war the remaining military presence and post-war veterans who came to Norman <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>an</b> <b>education</b> again grew the city's population, which was 27,006 by 1950. The Navy again utilized the bases in a lesser capacity from 1952 to 1959 {{in support of the}} Korean War effort.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of his father's death in 1901, the family fortunes were at a low ebb and Bruce went into the family business after leaving high school. The young Bruce was ambitious and determined <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>an</b> <b>education.</b> With loaned money, {{he moved to the}} United Kingdom with his mother and sister and enrolled in Trinity Hall, Cambridge in 1902. He was a popular if average student, heavily involved in the athletic life of the college, including {{as a member of the}} Cambridge rowing crew that won the Boat Race in 1904. Rowing remained one of his great passions, and he continued to coach crews (including several for the Henley Royal Regatta) and write on the subject for much of his life. Ernest Bruce had remained in Australia to take charge of the family's business interests. In 1906, he lobbied the directors of the company to have his brother Stanley take over the chairmanship of Paterson, Laing and Bruce, and was ultimately successful. Despite being just 23, he proved an able chairman, and with Stanley in London managing the exporting and financial interests, and Ernest managing the importation and sales operations in Melbourne, the financial fortunes of the business and the family rapidly recovered. During these years, Bruce also trained and worked as a solicitor and then as a barrister in the London with the firm of Ashurst, Morris, Crisp & Co. His work for the firm took him to Mexico in 1908 and Colombia in 1912, which fostered an interest in international affairs.|$|E
25|$|In ancient China, {{women were}} under-appreciated. This opinion was {{deeply rooted in}} the mind of Lanying’s family. Compared with her little sisters, she was quite lucky because she was the first baby. All of her sisters were sent to be child brides or killed. She was often mistreated and was not allowed <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>an</b> <b>education.</b> Before she was 6 years old, Lanying was {{required}} to wash all the clothes and cook for whole family. At age of six, she wanted to go to school because she wanted to escape the traditional pattern for women at her time, which was doing housework and chatting with other women all day. The only way to do was <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>an</b> <b>education.</b> However, her mother, who was deeply influenced by gender schema from society and controlled her life, did not allow that. So Lanying locked herself in her room and swore that she would not eat if she was not allowed to go to school. Her mother was moved by her insistence, so she finally got the chance <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>an</b> <b>education.</b>|$|E

25|$|Taiwanese {{literature}} {{mainly focused}} on the Taiwanese spirit and the essence of Taiwanese culture. People in literature and the arts {{began to think about}} issues of Taiwanese culture, and attempted to establish a culture that truly belonged to Taiwan. The significant cultural movement throughout the colonial period were led by the young generation who were highly educated in formal Japanese schools. Education played such a key role in supporting the government and to a larger extent, developing economic growth of Taiwan. However, despite the government prime effort in elementary education and normal education, there was a limited number of middle schools, approximately 3 across the whole country, so the preferred choices for graduates were leaving for Tokyo or other cities <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>an</b> <b>education.</b> The foreign education of the young students was carried out solely by individuals' self-motivation and support from family. Education abroad got its popularity, particularly from Taichung county, with the endeavor for acquiring skills and knowledge of civilization even under the situation of neither the colonial government nor society being able to guarantee their bright future; with no job plan for these educated people after their return.|$|E

2500|$|Colonization {{and slavery}} by European {{countries}} inspired colorism and racism, {{led by the}} belief that people with dark skin were uncivilized, inferior, and should be subordinate to the lighter-skinned invaders.

2500|$|Penn {{was educated}} first at Chigwell School, by private tutors whilst in Ireland, and later at Christ Church, Oxford.

Children from poor families {{had to have a}} wealthy sponsor <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>an</b> <b>education.</b> Penn's education heavily leaned on the classical authors and [...] "no novelties or conceited modern writers" [...] were allowed including William Shakespeare. Foot racing was Penn's favourite sport, and he would often run the more than three-mile (5km) distance from his home to the school. The school itself was cast in an Anglican mode– strict, humourless, and somber– and teachers had to be pillars of virtue and provide sterling examples to their charges. Though later opposing Anglicanism on religious grounds, Penn absorbed many Puritan behaviours, and was known later for his serious demeanor, strict behavior and lack of humor.|$|E
