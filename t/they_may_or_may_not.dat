5|$|The {{electron}} affinity of an atom {{is the amount}} of energy released when an electron is added to a neutral atom to form a negative ion. Although {{electron affinity}} varies greatly, some patterns emerge. Generally, nonmetals have more positive electron affinity values than metals. Chlorine most strongly attracts an extra electron. The electron affinities of the noble gases have not been measured conclusively, so <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>or</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> have slightly negative values.|$|E
5|$|The highest {{resolution}} Voyager 2 images {{revealed a}} pronounced clumpiness in the arcs, with a typical separation between visible clumps of 0.1° to 0.2°, which corresponds to 100–200km along the ring. Because the clumps were not resolved, <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>or</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> include larger bodies, but are certainly associated with concentrations of microscopic dust {{as evidenced by}} their enhanced brightness when backlit by the Sun.|$|E

50|$|After {{the heavily}} {{polished}} studio production incorporating drum machines on Madness's previous album, Mad Not Mad (1985), the 1986 demos {{seemed to indicate}} a more organic back to basics approach towards song writing as with their earlier works.

25|$|Square step cuts whose corners are not {{truncated}} {{are known}} as carré; they are also characteristic of antique jewelry. They may resemble the square-shaped Princess cut in passing, but a carré's lack of fire and simpler facets are distinctive. <b>They</b> <b>may</b> <b>or</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> have a culet. In Western jewelry dating to {{before the advent of}} brilliant-type cuts, very shallow step-cut stones were used as lustrous covers for miniature paintings: these are known in the antique trade as portrait stones. Characteristic of Indian jewelry are lasque diamonds, which may be the earliest form of step cut. They are flat stones with large tables and asymmetric outlines.|$|E
25|$|Usher {{syndrome}} {{has three}} clinical subtypes, denoted as I, II, and III. People with Usher I are born profoundly deaf, {{and begin to}} lose their vision {{in the first decade}} of life. They also exhibit balance difficulties, and learn to walk slowly as children, due to problems in their vestibular system. People with Usher II are not born deaf, but do have hearing loss. They do not seem to have noticeable problems with balance; they also begin to lose their vision later (in the second decade of life) and may preserve some vision even into middle age. People with Usher syndrome III are not born deaf, but experience a gradual loss of their hearing and vision; <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>or</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> have balance difficulties.|$|E
25|$|Sephardic Bnei Anusim are the {{descendants}} of Sephardi Jewish nominal converts (conversos) to Catholicism who immigrated to the New World escaping the Spanish Inquisition in Spain and Portugal. Following {{the establishment of the}} Inquisition in the Iberian colonies, again they hid their ancestry and beliefs. Their numbers are difficult to ascertain as most are at least nominally Catholic, having been converted by force or coercion, or married into the religion. Collectively, people of Sephardic Bnei Anusim Jewish descent in Latin America is in the millions. Most would be of mixed ancestry, although a few claim some communities may have been able to maintain a degree of endogamy (marrying only other Crypto-Jews) throughout the centuries. <b>They</b> <b>may</b> <b>or</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> consider themselves Jewish, some may continue to preserve some of their Jewish heritage in secrecy, many others may not even be aware of it. The majority would not be halakhically Jewish, but small numbers of various communities have formally returned to Judaism over the past decade, legitimizing their status as Jews. See also Anusim.|$|E

[...] Andrea W. of Yahoo! Voices was also receptive of the potential pairing. She wrote, [...] "Chloe and Kevin make a wonderful couple and I surly hope they overcome all of the obstacles <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>or</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> face.

500|$|Lasting {{until the}} final day without ever being kicked out or leaving for another reason is treated as an {{impressive}} feat on the series due {{to the level of}} violence and hostility. If the cast members engage in violence towards each other or break other rules, <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>or</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> be evicted under the show's policy, which is enforced by the producers. Security guards apparently live in the house behind the scenes as they jump into camera shot to break up the many violent altercations that break out on the series. Beyond the common occurrence of violence and combat, other reasons for the premature exits of cast members have been from bullying, ostracism and alienation {{from the rest of the}} housemates, problems at home, court proceedings, or their own narcissism. On some occasions, multiple [...] "bad girls" [...] may wish to leave the show; this has happened in all seasons. If a [...] "bad girl" [...] departs early in the season, a [...] "replacement Bad Girl" [...] is introduced within one or two episodes.

2500|$|Commenting on his {{association}} with the S/M subgenre of Nikkatsu's Roman Pornos, Konuma said, [...] "In general, the roman porn audience wants to see something they can't experience in everyday life. These people get excited about seeing acts which <b>they</b> <b>may</b> - <b>or</b> <b>may</b> {{not want to do}} to their wives or mates. Things they {{would never be able to}} really do without ending up in jail or divorce. For example, I was often assigned to make movies with rape scenes. I am not a person who could possibly perform rape. I want to see a lady's happy face while having sex... Movies are fantasies. Sometimes they might be ugly, but they're still fantasies.

40|$|The {{focus of}} this section is on the trends and {{prospects}} for the competitiveness of the region's SMEs, based on {{a review of the}} literature (as distinct from original research). In this context, the key dynamic shaping the prospects of Asia- Pacific SMEs relates to the globalization of production. This is changing the competitive environment for the region's SMEs in both international markets and at home. Therefore, at the core of the story is the need to understand the nature of globalization and its implications for the competitive performance of Asia-Pacific SMEs. From this perspective, small traditional firms serving only small local markets are not primary interest here, except insofar as <b>they</b> <b>may</b> evolve, <b>or</b> <b>may</b> be forced to evolve, into competitive enterprises in the above context.
