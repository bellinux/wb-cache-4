25|$|In November 2011, after 44 years, a {{compilation}} box {{set of the}} Beach Boys' Smile sessions was finally released by Capitol Records. Parks was personally absent from The Smile Sessions advertising campaign and liner notes, and {{refused to comment on}} the box set, despite initially giving his approval. In promotional interviews for The Smile Sessions and the Beach Boys' 50th Reunion Tour, Mike Love suggested <b>that</b> <b>Smile</b> collapsed due to substance abuse, and that the project was heavily influenced by Parks' drug use. One interview included an off-the-cuff comment by Brian Wilson saying that it was Parks who introduced him to LSD and amphetamines, something Parks has previously denied. Later in 2011, Parks formally responded to these claims via his web site in a post that accused Love of Mammon and historical revisionism. In February 2013, The Smile Sessions {{went on to win the}} Grammy Award for Best Historical Album.|$|E
500|$|During his career, Stewart was {{regarded}} as one of the hardest bodycheckers in the National Hockey League. [...] He also carried the heaviest stick in the league, explaining that [...] "I don't use it for scoring. I use it for breaking arms". [...] Stewart was known for his large grin when hitting opponents; teammate Ted Lindsay noted [...] "when he had <b>that</b> <b>smile,</b> it was time for the opposition to look out". [...] He led the league with 73 penalty minutes in 1945–46, and in the late 1940s, his rivalry with Milt Schmidt of the Boston Bruins was so intense that their physical interactions occasionally overshadowed the games themselves.|$|E
500|$|As a {{freshman}} at Virginia Tech, Garland {{was named to the}} 2011 All-Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) Academic Team along with Kyle Singler, Mason Plumlee, Ryan Kelly, and Tyler Zeller. He earned a grade-point average of above 3.00 for the previous semester and maintained it as a cumulative average through his academic career. He was also one of 2,835 student-athletes recognized by the ACC on its 2010–11 Academic Honor Roll. Garland majored in university studies at Virginia Tech, but majored in sociology at La Salle University. He recalled the final months of his senior year at La Salle, saying, [...] "I was really focused on graduating school and locking down my grades for graduation. I was focused on the next step, but I had to graduate school. That degree is very big to me. I told my mom I was going to graduate college and I just wanted to put <b>that</b> <b>smile</b> on her face".|$|E

500|$|In early May 1967, Taylor {{announced}} <b>that</b> <b>Smile</b> {{had been}} scrapped, but the Beach Boys were still under pressure and {{a contractual obligation}} to record and present an album to Capitol. On June 2, Brian declared to his bandmates {{that most of the}} material recorded for Smile was now off-limits. According to Carl, [...] "Brian just said, 'I can't do this. We're going to make a homespun version of it instead. We're just going to take it easy. I'll get in the pool and sing. Or let's go in the gym and do our parts.' That was Smiley Smile." [...] In interviews conducted over the next year, Brian intimated that he had run out of ideas [...] "in a conventional sense", and that he was [...] "about ready to die". He says: [...] "I decided not to try any more, and not try and do such great things ... And we had so much fun. The Smiley Smile era was so great, it was unbelievable. Personally, spiritually, everything, it was great. I didn't have any paranoia feelings." [...] Carl described the end product as [...] "a bunt instead of a grand slam".|$|E
500|$|After {{months of}} {{recording}} and media hype, the original Smile project was shelved due to corporate pressures, technical problems, internal power struggles, and legal stalling. Business partner David Anderle attempted to form Brother Records, an independent label, {{with the intention}} of giving [...] "entirely new concepts to the recording industry, and to give the Beach Boys total creative and promotional control over their product." [...] A March 1967 lawsuit seeking $255,000 (equivalent to $ in [...] ) was launched against Capitol Records over neglected royalty payments. Within the lawsuit, there was also an attempt to terminate the band's contract with Capitol before its November 1969 expiry. Band quarrels led Parks to leave the project in April 1967, with Anderle following suit weeks later. Dennis Wilson explained that the group had become [...] "very paranoid about the possibility of losing our public.... Drugs played a great role in our evolution but as a result we were frightened that people would no longer understand us, musically." [...] Brian said <b>that</b> <b>Smile</b> leftovers like [...] "Surf's Up" [...] were left unreleased because he lacked a [...] "commercial feeling" [...] for those songs, surmising that [...] "Maybe some people like to hang on to certain songs as their own little songs that they've written, almost for themselves. You know, what they've written is nice for them... {{but a lot of people}} just don't like it." [...] Carl Wilson reflected on the period: [...] "To get that album [...] out, someone would have needed willingness and perseverance to corral all of us. Everybody was so loaded on pot and hash all of the time that it's no wonder the project didn't get done." ...|$|E
2500|$|Healthy in Paranoid Times has {{a lighter}} sound and tone, and is less metaphorical than Our Lady Peace's pre-2002 releases. The second single, however, [...] "Angels/Losing/Sleep" [...] has vocalist Raine Maida singing {{at a higher}} pitch, making the jarred, falsetto-like voice Raine Maida and Our Lady Peace was {{formerly}} known for. Other songs, like [...] "Boy", also have a lighter melody and vocals, instead of the heavier sounds on Gravity. The album mostly deals with current world events, and discusses issues such as war and {{the current state of}} the world, rather than the social and relationship themes featured on Gravity; however, some songs still features the social and relationship themes, which can be found in songs like Picture and Apology. It has been classified as a politically charged album. In particular, the song [...] "Wipe <b>That</b> <b>Smile</b> Off your Face" [...] was confirmed to be written about George W. Bush.|$|E

2500|$|In 1921, Veach was {{the subject}} of a motivational tactic by new player-manager Cobb. Cobb {{believed}} that Veach, who came to bat with a smile and engaged in friendly conversation with umpires and opposing pitchers, was too easygoing. Tigers historian Fred Lieb described Veach as a [...] "happy-go-lucky guy, not too brilliant above the ears", who [...] "was as friendly as a Newfoundland pup with opponents as well as teammates". (Fred Lieb, [...] "The Detroit Tigers") Hoping to light a fire in Veach, Cobb persuaded Harry Heilmann, who followed Veach in the batting order, to taunt Veach from the on-deck circle. [...] "I want you to make him mad. Real mad[...] [...] [...] hile you're waiting, call him a yellow belly, a quitter and a dog. … Take <b>that</b> <b>smile</b> off his face". The tactic may have worked, as Veach had career-highs in RBIs (126) and home runs (16), and his batting average jumped from [...]308 to [...]338. Cobb had promised to tell Veach about the scheme when the season was over, but never did. When Heilmann tried to explain, Veach reportedly snarled, [...] "Don't come sucking around me with that phony line". Veach never forgave Heilmann. (Al Stump, Cobb: The Life and Times of the Meanest Man Who Ever Played Baseball (1994), pp.327–328.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Wilson's romanticized portrayals {{were only}} amplified after Taylor {{announced}} <b>that</b> <b>Smile</b> was [...] "scrapped" [...] in May 1967. Later that month, he terminated his employment {{with the group}} in order to focus his attention on organizing the June 16–18 Monterey Pop Festival, an event the Beach Boys declined to headline at the last minute. In 1968, Jazz & Pops Gene Sculatti wrote that Wilson was [...] "currently {{at the center of}} an intense contemporary rock controversy, involving the academic 'rock as art' critic-intellectuals, the AM-tuned teenies, {{and all the rest of}} us in between. ... the California sextet is simultaneously hailed as genius incarnate and derided as the archetypical pop music copouts". On December 14, 1967, Wenner printed an influential article in Rolling Stone that denounced the [...] "genius" [...] label, which he called a [...] "promotional shuck" [...] and an attempt to compare Wilson with the Beatles. He wrote: [...] "Wilson believed [...] and felt obligated to make good of it. It left Wilson in a bind; a bind which meant that a year elapsed between Pet Sounds and their latest release, Smiley Smile. ... The Beach Boys are just one prominent example of a group that has gotten hung up on trying to catch The Beatles. It's a pointless pursuit." [...] Subsequently, many discerning rock fans began excluding the group from [...] "serious consideration".|$|E
2500|$|In a June 2003 interview, Maida {{explained}} that lyrically, his {{words on the}} album would follow the music and would be very much {{a product of the}} times. [...] "I think it's {{going to be a little}} more raw, a little bit more in your face, not a lot of relationship stuff," [...] he says, noting that fans would get a preview of a couple of the tracks, [...] "Wipe <b>That</b> <b>Smile</b> Off Your Face" [...] and [...] "Walking In Circles", on the current tour. [...] "My head, with what's going on in the world and being able to reflect on all the (stuff) that I've done in the last few years in terms of going to Iraq, working very closely with War Child, I'm in that mode. I'm not angry, but kind of frustrated." [...] After observing the plight in Sudan and Darfur, Maida returned with a different outlook on his lyrics and became more outspoken. “There were some [...] that were way too over the top and preachy,” he admits, “and I had to pull a lot of stuff back. This isn’t a solo record for me, this is Our Lady Peace, so I have three people that I contend with in terms of how far I can go with saying things.” Bassist Coutts added [...] "A lot of things he was talking about lyrically were things that we discussed as a band in spending all that time together. I also think that becoming a father also let him deal with issues that he hadn't dealt with before. Although there are some of the darkest lyrics ever on this record, I think there are also some very positive ones as well." [...] The content of the album's lyrics have led it to be classified as a politically charged album, which the band hasn't denied.|$|E

2500|$|The band {{returned}} to Rock's Plantation Studios in Hawaii in May 2003 {{to begin the}} first recording sessions for the album. Their intention was to record an album even more simplified than Gravity and even closer in sound to what they sounded like live, an overall different record. [...] "I think we all knew going into it {{that it was an}} important record for us," [...] said Duncan Coutts. [...] "I think that when you get more than ten years into a band, It has to be a rebirth for us. We didn't want to go and remake any of our past records." [...] In one month, they recorded 12 songs live off the floor, most in two or three takes each. Following these sessions, several of the songs including [...] "Walking in Circles", [...] "No Warning" [...] and [...] "Wipe <b>That</b> <b>Smile</b> Off your Face" [...] were premiered live. After touring concluded for the year, the band was set to finish the album that October in time for a January 2004 release. While satisfied with the recorded material at first, with time the band became more critical of it and decided they would only be demos. They felt strongly about the songs [...] "Picture", [...] "Will the Future Blame Us?" [...] and [...] "Angels/Losing/Sleep" [...] but felt {{that the rest of the}} songs didn't live up to them. [...] "Even though we loved the energy of what we'd done, not enough of the songs were making the hair stand up on the back of your neck and so we realized that we needed to do more work," [...] bass player Duncan Coutts explained. They decided to postpone the album's release until June and then August to continue recording.|$|E
