5|$|On June 1, 2010, {{by a vote}} of 5–4, the Supreme Court {{reversed}} the Sixth Circuit's decision. In the Opinion of the Court, written by Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy, the Court ruled that Thompkins' silence during the interrogation did not invoke his right <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> <b>silent</b> and that he had waived his right <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> <b>silent</b> when he knowingly and voluntarily made a statement to police.|$|E

5|$|The Twittys {{and their}} {{supporters}} criticized a perceived lack of progress by Aruban police. The Twittys' own actions in Aruba were also criticized, and the Twittys were accused of actively stifling any evidence that might impugn Holloway's character by asking her fellow students <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> <b>silent</b> about the case and using their access to the media to push {{their own version of}} events. The Twittys denied this.|$|E

5|$|The U.S. Constitution's Fifth Amendment {{gives an}} {{individual}} suspected of crime a {{right not to}} be forced, by police or other government officials, into giving up evidence that would show {{he or she was}} guilty of a crime. Based on this constitutional prohibition against self-incrimination and to prevent coerced testimony by police or other government officials, the Supreme Court ruled in Miranda v. Arizona that an individual who was being held by police and was not free to leave had to be told of his/her right <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> <b>silent.</b> After Berghuis, a subsequent case, Salinas v. Texas, considered a suspect who was not being held against his will by police officers, but who had instead agreed to accompany officers and discuss a case upon their request. It extended Berghuis by ruling that in such a situation and prior to any arrest, the individual was not required to be explicitly told about his/her right <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> <b>silent</b> under the Fifth Amendment.|$|E
5|$|Endeavour then resumed her voyage westward {{along the}} coast, picking {{a path through}} {{intermittent}} shoals and reefs {{with the help of}} the pinnace, which was rowed ahead to test the water depth. By 26 August she was out of sight of land, and had entered the open waters of the Torres Strait between Australia and New Guinea, earlier navigated by Luis Váez de Torres in 1606. To keep Endeavours voyages and discoveries secret, Cook confiscated the log books and journals of all on board and ordered them <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> <b>silent</b> about where they had been.|$|E
5|$|Kris Donnelly {{became the}} fourth {{person to be}} {{confirmed}} as a housemate when he was selected by Lisa, who had earned the privilege to choose by answering a ringing phone.

5|$|Thompkins appealed his {{conviction}} {{on grounds that}} included suppression of his admission—that he had invoked and not waived his right to remain silent—and deficient representation related to improper jury instructions, but the Michigan Court of Appeals rejected Thompkins' Miranda claim. Thompkins then filed a writ of habeas corpus in federal District Court but it denied his request. However, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed the District Court's decision, holding that the state court was unreasonable in finding an implied waiver of Thompkins' right <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> <b>silent.</b>|$|E

Stanton's young nephew Daniel was lifted through an open window so that he could unbar the doors from the inside. Even though the first session had been announced as being exclusively for women, some young children of both sexes had been brought by their mothers, and about 40 men were there expecting to attend. The men were not turned away, but were asked <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> <b>silent.</b> Mary Ann M'Clintock, Jr., 26 years old, was appointed secretary, to take notes.|$|E

25|$|Claude Malhuret {{was elected}} {{as the new}} {{president}} of Medicins Sans Frontieres in 1977, and soon after debates began over the future of the organisation. In particular, the concept of témoignage ("witnessing"), which refers to speaking out about the suffering that one sees as opposed <b>to</b> <b>remaining</b> <b>silent,</b> was being opposed or played down by Malhuret and his supporters. Malhuret thought MSF should avoid criticism of the governments of countries in which they were working, while Kouchner believed that documenting and broadcasting the suffering in a country was {{the most effective way to}} solve a problem.|$|R
5|$|Loughner, a 22-year-old Tucson {{man who was}} {{fixated on}} Giffords, was arrested at the scene. Federal {{prosecutors}} filed five charges against him, including the attempted assassination {{of a member of}} Congress and the assassination of a federal judge. Loughner previously had been arrested (but not convicted) once on a minor drug charge and had been suspended by his college for disruptive behavior. Court filings include notes handwritten by Loughner indicating he planned to assassinate Giffords. Loughner did not cooperate with authorities, invoking his right <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> <b>silent.</b> He was held without bail and indicted on 49 counts. In January 2012, Loughner was found by a federal judge to be incompetent to stand trial based on two medical evaluations, which diagnosed him with paranoid schizophrenia. Judged still incompetent to stand trial on May 25, finally on August 7, Loughner had a hearing at which he was judged competent. He pleaded guilty to 19 counts, and in November 2012 was sentenced to life in prison.|$|E
5|$|Sophie/Dogface Victoria Reade (born 18 May 1989) is a glamour {{model from}} Nantwich, Cheshire, has {{appeared}} in Hot Shots Calendar and was {{the winner of the}} series.

On Day 33 Big Brother told Reade that she had <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> <b>silent</b> until 2am as punishment for discussing nominations; she failed to keep quiet and therefore faced the public vote. Reade had a romantic relationship with Kris in the House. On Day 39 she and Siavash were punished by Big Brother for talking about nominations, and told they were not allowed to swear before 3pm; they both failed and faced eviction. On Day 72, as a special prize, Dogface (Reade) legally changed her name back to Sophie. Since Day 88, Sophie was the bookies' favourite to win. She left the house to huge cheers and a lively crowd chanting her name.|$|E

50|$|The {{spiral of}} silence theory is a {{political}} science and mass communication theory proposed by the German political scientist Elisabeth Noelle-Neumann, which stipulates that individuals have a fear of isolation, which results from {{the idea that a}} social group or the society in general might isolate, neglect, or exclude members due to the members' opinions. This fear of isolation consequently leads <b>to</b> <b>remaining</b> <b>silent</b> instead of voicing opinions. Media is an important factor that relates to both the dominant idea and people's perception of the dominant idea. The assessment of one's social environment may not always correlate with reality.|$|R

40|$|Reflecting a {{traditional}} bias against defendants 2 ̆ 7 trial testimony, the modern American criminal justice system, which now recognizes {{a constitutional right}} to testify at trial, unabashedly encourages defendants to waive that right and <b>remain</b> <b>silent.</b> As a result, a large percentage of criminal defendants decline to testify, forcing juries to decide the question of the defendant 2 ̆ 7 s guilt without ever hearing from the person most knowledgeable on the subject. This Article contends that the inflated percentage of silent defendants in the American criminal trial system is a needless, self-inflected wound, neither required by the Constitution nor beneficial to the search for truth. Consequently, the Article proposes two alternative reforms designed to eliminate, or at least minimize, the legal inducements <b>to</b> <b>remaining</b> <b>silent</b> at trial. The reforms, if adopted, would encourage a greater number of defendants to testify (and be cross-examined), funneling more factual information into the crucible of the adversary process, and thereby increasing the reliability of trial outcomes...|$|R
