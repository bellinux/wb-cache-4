25|$|Although <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>times</b> when {{it makes}} sense to use the bind {{operator}} >>= directly in a program, it is more typical to use a format called do-notation (perform-notation in OCaml, computation expressions in F#), that mimics the appearance of imperative languages. The compiler translates do-notation to expressions involving >>=.|$|E
25|$|<b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>times</b> when an uninitiated dog {{owner or}} a new enthusiast {{mistakes}} the Koolie as a shy, reserved or even a timid animal. The Koolie's temperament needs to be understood in proper context when one seeks an optimal match of skills and demeanour. Koolies are intelligent animals, and the most experienced handlers know well that they need guidance in training. A steady and supportive approach will be productive, proving the Koolie's adaptability in diverse situations when given time.|$|E

At the moment graduate students in museum studies are working to develop an inventory of the collection. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>times</b> when they host small exhibitions of works in the collection {{but there is no}} allotted gallery space for this. Undergraduate students mostly interact with the collection through their classes; aside from that most of their experiences with this collection come from the public sculptures around campus.|$|E

Although it is difficult, Musashi agrees that <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>times</b> in which the long sword must be used with two hands, but one whose skill is good enough should not need it. The idea of using two long swords starting with something new and difficult but will adapt to after much use.|$|E
25|$|Vector {{graphics}} formats are complementary to raster graphics. Raster graphics is {{the representation}} of images as an array of pixels and is typically used for {{the representation of}} photographic images. Vector graphics consists in encoding information about shapes and colors that comprise the image, which can allow for more flexibility in rendering. There are instances when working with vector tools and formats is best practice, and instances when working with raster tools and formats is best practice. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>times</b> when both formats come together. An understanding of the advantages and limitations of each technology {{and the relationship between}} them is most likely to result in efficient and effective use of tools.|$|E

25|$|The player {{follows the}} war effort through all four countries, with its own COs, {{over the course of}} the game. Starting with having only one choice of a CO to advise, Andy, the player will have a choice of two more Orange Star COs, Max and Sami, to advise as the story progresses, each with their own {{advantages}} and disadvantages. Depending on which CO is chosen by the player to advise, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>times</b> when a mission is split into a choice of two or three, where the maps and dialog could be different. After completing that mission, the story paths could split up, depending on which CO was chosen in that previous mission, with the story differing from the other path, eventually leading back to the main path.|$|E
25|$|Unger has {{presented}} {{a number of}} general institutional proposals that aim to restructure the world trade regime and introduce new alternatives in the market economy. For international and global trade, Unger calls for the need to experiment with different property rights regimes, where multiple forms will coexist in the same market system and not be tied to individual property rights and contractual labor. Generally, rather than maximizing the free trade as the goal, Unger sees the need to build and open the world economy in way that reconciles global openness with national and regional diversification, deviation, heresy, and experiment, where {{the idea is to}} support alternatives by making the world safer for them. For national economies, he rejects the need to require the free flow of capital, for <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>times</b> when {{it may be necessary to}} restrict capital flows. Rather, he puts the emphasis on the free flow of people. Labor should be allowed to move freely throughout the world.|$|E
25|$|If all looting is wrong, as {{in theory}} it is, {{then they have}} been to blame: but <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>times</b> when {{the laws of nature}} assert {{themselves}} over the laws of civilization, and this was a case in point. You must remember that these men had just endured a long siege, that they had been bereft of everything they possessed and that they had hundreds of men, similarly destitute, who were dependent upon them. What was their position? Had they come to me and said, 'Give us money and food,' I could only have replied in the negative, or, at all events, to the effect that I could not feed their converts, and so they took the law into their own hands. It has been a case of poetical or primitive justice. But, granted that this sort of justice was admissible, I do not admit that the missionaries abused it. I have not heard of a single instance of a missionary looting for any purpose other than that of feeding themselves and their converts who were dependent on them.|$|E

25|$|At {{the end of}} {{the first}} period, MacLean hosts Coach's Corner, {{featuring}} himself and former NHL Coach of the Year Don Cherry. On Coach's Corner, Cherry analyzes the game's first period, shares his opinions on current issues surrounding the sport or league, and gives tips on various points of hockey, with MacLean acting as Cherry's foil. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>times</b> in which Cherry tends to be controversial; for example, in 2003, Cherry stated that the majority of players wearing facial protection in the NHL are French-Canadians and Europeans (though a study done by a lawyer confirmed Cherry's assertion). In any case, this controversy led to Coach's Corner being put on a seven-second delay for the rest of the season by the CBC. The seven-second delay has been subsequently removed from the broadcast, although the segment is still only shown live during the telecast of the first game that enters the first intermission. The Coach's Corner segment is followed by a recap of other games going on during the evening. There are also interviews with players in between periods, during which the players often brandish towels with the HNIC logo on it.|$|E
25|$|Doro's {{character}} {{plays an}} important role in the novel because he has total control over all of the other characters. Part of the reason that Doro has so much control is because he determines whether one lives or dies. Doro has the gift and curse of being able to take on the body of anyone he desires. This is a gift because he is immortal, but it is a curse because when a body gets old, it is mandatory that he changes bodies in order to live. In order for Doro to survive, he must kill. This causes the other characters to be very wary of how they behave around Doro because they know that their life can be over at any moment. Another reason that Doro has so much control is because he is a man. The fact that he is a man makes it much easier for him to control other women, especially Anyanwu. Anyanwu is physically strong enough to fight Doro, but <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>times</b> where she does not retaliate against his physical abuse. Doro uses sex to draw women close to him and to create an emotional bond that makes it hard for them to leave.|$|E

500|$|In March 2001, Aaliyah {{finished}} {{recording the}} album after having filmed her part in Queen of the Damned for four months, which ultimately delayed the album's release. In Australia, she also did {{a photo shoot}} for Aaliyah with photographers Jeff Dunas, Jonathan Mannion, David LaChapelle, and Albert Watson. Aaliyah handled five pythons at the shoot and developed an affinity for snakes, finding them [...] "dangerous, but quite beautiful" [...] and representative of her on the album. She revisited the snake theme in her music video for [...] "We Need a Resolution" [...] in April and told MTV, [...] "They live in solitude, [...] <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>times</b> in my life [...] I {{just want to be}} by myself. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>times</b> I can't even figure myself out. I feel they are very complex creatures, [...] at the same time, they're sexy, too. That's why they represent Aaliyah pretty well." [...] She described the record as [...] "a good reflection of [...] and the person [...] today", saying in an interview for Jet magazine, [...] "I am a young adult now, and I think this album shows my growth vocally." [...] Aaliyah was mastered by Bernie Grundman at his studio in Los Angeles.|$|E
500|$|By 1972, {{after being}} a {{performer}} for nearly ten years, Morrison began experiencing stage fright when performing for audiences of thousands, {{as opposed to}} the hundreds as he had experienced in his early career. He became anxious on stage and had difficulty establishing eye contact with the audience. He once said in an interview about performing on stage, [...] "I dig singing the songs but <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>times</b> when it's pretty agonising for me to be out there." [...] After a brief break from music, he started appearing in clubs, regaining his ability to perform live, albeit with smaller audiences.|$|E

In the following decades <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>times</b> when the Ottomans succeeded to storm Tabriz, and <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>times</b> when the Persians successfully captured Baghdad.

500|$|Squidward is {{depicted}} as a bitter, very unfortunate, desperate, somewhat depressed, curt, arrogant, occasionally selfish, turquoise octopus. He lives in the underwater city of Bikini Bottom in a moai situated between SpongeBob SquarePants' pineapple house and Patrick Star's rock. Squidward detests his neighbors for their perpetual laughter and boisterous behavior, though SpongeBob and Patrick are oblivious to Squidward's animosity towards them and regard him as a friend, [...] though <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>times</b> when {{at least one of}} them is slightly aware of it, notably in the episode [...] "SB-129" [...] when Patrick voiced suspicion and was beginning to believe Squidward's hatred of them was real.|$|E
500|$|William Kowalski in The Globe and Mail {{questioned}} why {{the book}} was not released as a memoir as <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>times</b> when Irving appears to have modeled Danny [...] "literally after himself". He complained that it was these passages that tended to [...] "bog down" [...] the story. Kowalski called the novel [...] "a flawed but mature work by {{one of our most}} accomplished writers". For Rene Rodriguez in the Los Angeles Times, the highlight of {{the book was}} the attention it gave to the bond between Dominic and his son, but she did feel that the details of the creative process should have been relegated to an essay.|$|E

Francis finishes Deal's sentences, joking that her response to hearing of the teacher's activities {{was to try to}} join the team. Albini later observed the use of studio banter on Surfer Rosa: [...] "It's on their record forever so I think now they are obliged to say that they're ok with it, but I honestly don't know that that idea would've ever come up if I hadn't done it. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>times</b> when things like that are revealing and entertaining and I kind of felt it was a bit gimmicky on this record." ...|$|E
