40|$|As {{a result}} of the {{difficulties}} in negotiating the liberalization of trade globally, countries seek liberalization among smaller groups. We describe open regionalism as one such attempt to do this, and show why after a decade of success it ran into the ground as a strategy. The formation of discriminatory regional free-trade areas (FTAs) is sometimes seen as another response to this problem. This paper point outs what is wrong with this response [...] that it distorts trade patterns and thereby sets up an unpleasant prisoner's dilemma [...] and suggests some ways forward. We propose the formation of open trading arrangements (OTAs) and the establishment of a Trade Transparency Commission in each country that is participating in an OTA. We also suggest global regulation of <b>trade</b> <b>diversions</b> caused by all FTAs, whether OTAs or not. Ultimately, the return to health of the global trading system will require expanded understanding of the basic insight of economics, that liberalization enhances the welfare of citizens of the liberalizing country...|$|R

A studyhas been driven on the Brazil trade with Argentina so as to characterize its evolution {{from the end of}} 80 s, that it to say before the entry in application of the Asuncion agreement. By resorting to several indicators (commercial balance, Spearman coefficient, Grubel -Lloyd indicator), a slow but indisputable evolution of the Brazilian foreign trade structure has been put in obviousness. The relatively high level of the Mercosur common external rate lifts the question of the importance of <b>trade</b> <b>diversions</b> create by this regional integration zone. A crossed analysis of revealed comparative advantages and regional preference indicators shows a significant deviation phenomenon of trade. Like the preferential commercial agreement EEC - Spain of 1970 that has prepared the Spanish adhesion (with important diversionsof trade to the disadvantage of Maghreb countries), the Asuncion treaty would have to be perceived by international organisms (World Bank, WTO) as instituting a transitory protectionism of "infant zone" to allow the economic correction of developing countries.

The originality of this research lies in the spectrum of agreements covered (big customs unions as well as bilateral free trade areas) and in its objective. We try {{to find out if the}} new zones boost trade between member countries and also with all the partners of the sub-continent. This question is essential as the choice between continental and sub-continental integration is still not clearly established. Our findings show evidence that all the selected groups (Mercosur, Andean Community, Group of 3, Free trade areas Bolivia-Mexico and Chile-Mexico) generate internal trade creations. Except for the Chile-Mexico agreement, the impact on the imports and on the exports with the rest of Latin America is also positive. The new groups represent building blocks (net trade makers) for the Latin American region. The revival of the regionalization process of the 90 ’s thus entails an expansion of trade on the whole sub-continent. This result constitutes an argument for a South American free trade area which would precede an exposure to North American competition within the framework of the Free trade area of Americas. building / stumbling blocks, gravity model, Latin America, <b>trade</b> creation / <b>diversion,</b> <b>trade</b> integration...|$|R
