5|$|During the 19th century, the Inns {{began to}} stagnate; little {{had been changed}} since the 17th century in terms of legal {{education}} or practice, except that students were no longer bound to take the Anglican sacrament before their call <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bar.</b> In 1852 the Council of Legal Education was established by the Inns, and in 1872 a formal examination for the call <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bar</b> was introduced. Gray's Inn itself suffered more than most; as in the 18th century, the fortunes of its members declined, and many barristers who had been called <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bar</b> at the Inn transferred to others.|$|E
5|$|Gray's Inn's {{internal}} records {{date from}} 1569, {{at which point}} there were four types of member; {{those who had not}} yet been called <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bar,</b> Utter Barristers, Ancients and Readers. Utter Barristers were those who had been called <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bar</b> but were still studying, Ancients were those who were called <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bar</b> and were allowed to practise and Readers were those who had been called <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bar,</b> were allowed to practise and now played a part in educating law students at the Inns of Chancery and at Gray's Inn itself. At the time Gray's Inn was the odd one out amongst the Inns; the others did not recognise Ancients as a degree of barrister and had Benchers roughly corresponding to the Readers used at Gray's Inn (although the positions were not identical).|$|E

5|$|In 1733 the {{requirements}} for a call <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bar</b> were significantly revised in a joint meeting between the Benchers of Inner Temple and Gray's Inn, revisions accepted by Lincoln's Inn and Middle Temple, although they were not represented. It is not recorded what these changes were, but after a further discussion in 1762 the Inns adopted a rule that any student with a Master of Arts or Bachelor of Laws degree from the universities of Oxford or Cambridge could be called <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bar</b> after three years as a student, and any other student could be called after five years. An {{attempt was made to}} increase the quality of legal education at Gray's Inn; in 1753 a barrister, Danby Pickering, was employed to lecture there, although this agreement ended in 1761 when he was called <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bar.</b>|$|E
5|$|On February 3, 1883, Gordon {{became the}} second {{woman to be}} {{admitted}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bar</b> of the United States Supreme Court, after Belva Lockwood.|$|E
5|$|The period saw the {{establishment}} of a regular system of legal education. In {{the early days of the}} Inn, the quality of legal education had been poor—readings were given infrequently, and the standards for call <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bar</b> were weak and varied. During the Elizabethan age readings were given regularly, moots took place daily and barristers who were called <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bar</b> were expected to play a part in teaching students, resulting in skilled and knowledgeable graduates from the Inn.|$|E

5|$|The 18th {{century was}} not a {{particularly}} prosperous time for the Inn or its members, and few notable barristers were members during this period. Some noted members include Sir Thomas Clarke, the Master of the Rolls, Sir James Eyre, Chief Justice of the Common Pleas and Samuel Romilly, a noted law reformer. In 1780 the Inn {{was involved in the}} case of R v the Benchers of Gray's Inn, a test {{of the role of the}} Inns of Court as the sole authority to call students <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bar.</b> The case was brought to the Court of King's Bench by William Hart, a student at the Inn, who asked the court (under Lord Mansfield) to order the Inn to call him <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bar.</b> Mansfield ruled that the Inns of Court were indeed the only organisations able to call students <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bar,</b> and refused to order the Inns to call Hart.|$|E
