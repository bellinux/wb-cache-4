5|$|During Modi's {{second term}} <b>the</b> <b>rhetoric</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{government}} shifted from Hindutva to Gujarat's economic development. Modi curtailed {{the influence of}} Sangh Parivar organisations such as the Bharatiya Kisan Sangh (BKS) and the Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP), entrenched in the state after the decline of Ahmedabad's textile industry, and dropped Gordhan Zadafia (an ally of former Sangh co-worker and VHP state chief Praveen Togadia) from his cabinet. When the BKS staged a farmers' demonstration Modi ordered their eviction from state-provided houses, and his decision to demolish 200 illegal temples in Gandhinagar deepened the rift with the VHP. Sangh organisations were no longer consulted or informed in advance about Modi's administrative decisions. Nonetheless, Modi retained connections with some Hindu nationalists. Modi wrote a forward to a textbook by Dinanath Batra released in 2014, which stated that ancient India possessed technologies including test-tube babies.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>rhetoric</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> French Revolution {{inspired}} many Irishmen {{to fight}} for similar principles of liberty, equality, and brotherhood in their own nation; liberty in this context largely meant independence from Great Britain. With these goals in mind, in 1791 Dublin lawyer Wolfe Tone founded the Society of United Irishmen. Allying itself with the French Republic, the society was suppressed by the British authorities and forced to go underground when war broke out between France and Great Britain in 1793. Tone and other members secretly travelled to France to convince the French National Convention to invade Ireland. Such an invasion, they argued, could rely on support from large numbers of Irish irregulars, and if successful would strike a severe blow to the British war effort—perhaps even severe enough to force Britain to seek peace.|$|E

25|$|The {{painting}} has a chromatic harmony that {{is incredibly}} rich, expressive and radiant. On the black mourning garments of the nobles are projected the gold-embroidered vestments, thus creating an intense ceremonial character. In the heavenly space {{there is a}} predominance of transparent harmonies of iridescence and ivoried greys, which harmonize with the gilded ochres, while in the Madonna's maforium (mantle) deep blue is closely combined with bright red. <b>The</b> <b>rhetoric</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> expressions, the glances and the gestural translation make the scene very moving.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>rhetoric</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nudism and anti-nudism {{movements}} emphasizes {{freedom from}} many of the normal constraints which regulate human interaction in nudist settings, although for different reasons. Using data from French and German beaches, this hypothesis was tested using five different indicators. Little significant variation between nudists and non-nudists within French and German settings is found in their patterns of interactional spacing, while more significant main effects for differences of cultures are found regardless of nudity status. As a subculture, nudists would appear to differ from nonnudists only in their propensity to like to sunbathe in the nude. Their nude status would appear to have none of the de-inhibiting effects often attributed to nudism. By contrast, clear cultural differences between German and French cultures are shown consistent with Hall's high-low context distinction and the Francoeur's hot-cool sexuality continuum.|$|E
500|$|Wollstonecraft applies this feminist {{critique}} to Burke's language {{throughout the}} Reflections. As Johnson argues, [...] "her pamphlet {{as a whole}} refutes the Burkean axiom 'to make us love our country, our country ought to be lovely'"; Wollstonecraft successfully challenges Burke's rhetoric of the beautiful with <b>the</b> <b>rhetoric</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rational. She also demonstrates how Burke embodies the worst of his own ideas. He becomes the hysterical, illogical, feminine writer, and Wollstonecraft becomes the rational, masculine writer. Ironically, in order to effect this transposition, Wollstonecraft herself becomes passionate at times, for example, in her description of slavery (quoted above).|$|E

500|$|Wollstonecraft's Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark is {{a deeply}} {{personal}} travel narrative. The twenty-five letters cover {{a wide range of}} topics, from sociological reflections on Scandinavia and its peoples to philosophical questions regarding identity to musings on her relationship with Imlay (although he is not referred to by name in the text). Using <b>the</b> <b>rhetoric</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sublime, Wollstonecraft explores the relationship between the self and society. Reflecting the strong influence of Rousseau, Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark shares the themes of the French philosopher's Reveries of a Solitary Walker (1782): [...] "the search for the source of human happiness, the stoic rejection of material goods, the ecstatic embrace of nature, and the essential role of sentiment in understanding". While Rousseau ultimately rejects society, however, Wollstonecraft celebrates domestic scenes and industrial progress in her text.|$|E
500|$|Bryan's {{speech is}} {{considered}} one of the most powerful political addresses in American history. Stanley Jones, however, suggested that even if Bryan had never made it, he would still have been nominated. Jones deemed the Democrats likely to nominate a candidate who would appeal to the Populist Party, and Bryan had been elected to Congress with Populist support. According to rhetorical historian William Harpine in his study of <b>the</b> <b>rhetoric</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1896 campaign, [...] "Bryan's speech cast a net for the true believers, but only for the true believers." [...] Harpine suggested that, [...] "by appealing in such an uncompromising way to the agrarian elements and to the West, Bryan neglected the national audience who would vote in the November election". [...] Bryan's emphasis on agrarian issues, both in his speech and in his candidacy, may have helped cement voting patterns which kept the Democrats largely out of power until the 1930s.|$|E
500|$|Although Wollstonecraft argues against {{excessive}} sensibility, <b>the</b> <b>rhetoric</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Rights of Woman is {{at times}} heated {{and attempts to}} provoke the reader. Many of the most emotional comments in the book are directed at Rousseau. For example, after excerpting a long passage from [...] (1762), Wollstonecraft pithily states, [...] "I shall make no other comments on this ingenious passage, than just to observe, {{that it is the}} philosophy of lasciviousness." [...] A mere page later, after indicting Rousseau's plan for female education, she writes [...] "I must relieve myself by drawing another picture." [...] These terse exclamations are meant to draw the reader to her side of the argument (it is assumed that the reader will agree with them). While she claims to write in a plain style so that her ideas will reach the broadest possible audience, she actually combines the plain, rational language of the political treatise with the poetic, passionate language of sensibility to demonstrate that one can combine rationality and sensibility in the same self. Wollstonecraft defends her positions not only with reasoned argument but also with ardent rhetoric.|$|E

40|$|How can we most usefully {{appropriate}} <b>the</b> <b>rhetorics</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{new economy}} to advance a contemporary understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{production and consumption}} of creative and informational content?

This piece takes an explicitly policy orientated line and tendentiously tracks a genealogy and some possible preferred futures for the creative industries beyond their framing within a cultural policy problematic. I track <b>the</b> fate <b>of</b> creative and informational content as it passes across three grids of understanding: ‘culture’, ‘services’ and ‘knowledge’. These grids also serve as historical and/or possible rationales for state intervention in the creative industries as well as industry’s own understandings of their nature and role...|$|R
500|$|The album's fourth track, [...] "Don't Stop", is {{characterized}} by a pulsating bass overlaid with strings punctuating and accompanying the riffs in sustained and glissandi gestures. <b>The</b> <b>rhetoric</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> track is displayed by Madonna's commands: [...] "Don't stop doin' what you're doin' baby, Don't stop, keep movin' keep groovin'". The next track [...] "Inside of Me" [...] starts with the same tempo as [...] "Don't Stop", with guitars, sustained strings, [...] "throbbing" [...] bass and jazz-y keyboards, with Madonna singing in a breathy vocal register. The singing conjures an erotic imagery as she sings on the chorus, [...] "Even though you're gone, love still carries on", however the lyrics were interpreted as both about her deceased mother, or a long-lost lover. The strings and an occasional saxophone sample makes [...] "Inside of Me" [...] a direct continuation of [...] "Erotica", with an interval where the drums drop off, exposing Madonna's vocals. On the sixth track, [...] "Human Nature", Madonna confronts chauvinism as she sings, [...] "And I'm not sorry, I'm not your bitch, don't hang your shit on me", while telling herself in whispered tones to [...] "express yourself, don't repress yourself". Consisting of heavy bass and looping drum sounds in its four chord sequence, the song finds Madonna delivering a nasal tone reminiscent of 90s soul style. Together with [...] "Survival", the song became a vehicle for Madonna to lyrically vent off her frustrations regarding the controversies surrounding her.|$|E
