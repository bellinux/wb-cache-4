5|$|In a dark match {{before the}} {{pay-per-view}} broadcast, Adam Bomb pinned Kwang. As the broadcast opened, the commentators, Vince McMahon (fresh off his federal trial acquittal, one month earlier) and Jerry Lawler, announced that The Headshrinkers had dropped the tag team title to Diesel and Shawn Michaels, {{and that the}} belts would {{not be on the}} line at SummerSlam. Throughout the broadcast, Nielsen and his co-star from The Naked Gun, George Kennedy, appeared backstage in skits <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>solve</b> <b>the</b> mystery of the two Undertakers.|$|E
5|$|In 1942, <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>solve</b> <b>the</b> {{problem of}} lack of a {{suitable}} mobile 152mm howitzer, the design bureau headed by F. F. Petrov started to work privately on a new howitzer, based on the carriage of the M-30 and {{the barrel of the}} M-10 (which was fitted with a muzzle brake {{in order to reduce the}} recoil and thus prevent damage to the lighter carriage). The approach allowed production to begin on the new howitzer almost immediately from the stockpile of parts for both earlier guns. Given the war situation and shortages of artillery, this solution was both elegant and expedient.|$|E
5|$|After {{losing a}} Casket match to Yokozuna at the 1994 Royal Rumble, The Undertaker {{did not appear}} in the WWF for several months. In reality, he was given time off to allow a back injury to heal. The WWF foreshadowed his return by airing videos of people who claimed to have seen The Undertaker. Eventually, DiBiase, who {{introduced}} The Undertaker to the WWF in 1990, claimed to have brought The Undertaker back to the WWF. but Paul Bearer informed him that DiBiase’s Undertaker was an impostor and that Bearer had located the true Undertaker. This led to a match at SummerSlam pitting The Undertaker against The Undertaker. In the buildup to the match, Leslie Nielsen perform short segments <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>solve</b> <b>the</b> mystery of how two Undertakers could exist in a spinoff of his roles on Police Squad! and The Naked Gun films.|$|E

5|$|While Richard {{was still}} in Sicily, word reached {{the king of the}} {{disputes}} between William Longchamp, whom Richard had left in England, and John, Richard's younger brother. On 2 April 1191 Richard sent Coutances back from Sicily to England. The archbishop landed in England on 27 June, after a short detour to Rome. Coutances received a release from his crusading vow, and returned to England in the company of Richard's mother, Queen Eleanor of Aquitaine. He had a number of royal documents authorising him to settle the disputes, and on 28 July a settlement was reached that left Longchamp in control, although John still retained sufficient power to make Longchamp's grip on the government somewhat insecure. In September, however, Longchamp imprisoned Richard's bastard half-brother, Geoffrey, Archbishop of York, who was attempting to return to England after having been banished by the king. The imprisonment renewed memories of the murder of Thomas Becket almost 20years earlier, and Geoffrey was quickly released. Longchamp was brought to a council, headed by Coutances and a number of the clerical and lay lords of England, which took place on 5 October 1191 at Loddon Bridge on the River Thames. Longchamp was deposed and exiled, largely because Coutances had a royal document ordering the magnates to obey Coutances' if the archbishop's advice was resisted by Longchamp, which it had been. Although the medieval chronicler Richard of Devizes accused Coutances of duplicity, and of trying to play both sides against the other, the evidence suggests that Coutances was genuinely <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>solve</b> <b>the</b> dispute in the king's interest. Longchamp fled to Normandy, and he was excommunicated by Coutances.|$|E

Later that night, Olivia, who {{lives next door}} to Jill and Kate, is {{attacked}} and murdered by Ghostface as Jill and Kirby watch in horror. Sidney and Jill rush in to save Olivia, but the killer injures them and gets away; Sidney and Jill are taken to the hospital. In the hospital's parking garage, Ghostface murders Rebecca. Gale, <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>solve</b> <b>the</b> murders, enlists the help of two high school movie fanatics, Charlie Walker and Robbie Mercer, who explain that the killer is using the rules of movie remakes to murder. Charlie concludes that the killer will likely strike at a party being held that night.|$|E
25|$|Shortwave signals {{presented}} {{a problem for}} RDF because the skywave signal can be simultaneously received from several hops, making it appear as if the transmitter is at several different bearings. The solution had already been studied, although not in order to solve this specific problem. In 1917 Frank Adcock was <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>solve</b> <b>the</b> problem of making large antennae suitable for use with the radiogoniometer at even the longest wavelengths. He developed a system using four very tall masts, connected together electrically to form two virtual loops. This eliminated the need to connect {{the tops of the}} antennae, which were otherwise difficult to connect together for very large antennae. However, it was later found that the underground connections between the antennae shielded them from skywaves, allowing only the direct-line groundwave to reach the goniometer.|$|E

At the end of the argument, Eva finally admits to herself and Che that she is dying and can't go on for much longer. Afterwards, Eva finally understands that Perón loves her for herself, not just for what she can do for him and his career ("You Must Love Me").|$|E
25|$|Sardesai, Venkataraghavan and Solkar were rested and Govindraj {{played his}} first match. He took 2 for 20 in 12 overs {{in his opening}} spell. By tea, Robins' XI had lost seven wickets for 148. Chris Old and Kerry O'Keeffe added 71 for the ninth wicket when the innings was {{declared}} {{half an hour before}} the close. Still <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>solve</b> <b>the</b> problem of the opening batsmen, India picked all the four openers in the touring party. Gavaskar and Baig opened, Jayantilal went in at one down and Mankad at five. After the quick exit of Baig and Jayantilal, Wadekar scored 45 with nine fours, four of them in a Greig over. Viswanath scored a hundred in 200 minutes with 15 fours. Robins' XI declared just before tea setting India 182 in around two hours. Baig scored 38 with six fours after which the match ended in a draw.|$|E
25|$|In March 1921, {{the plans}} for a {{plebiscite}} were abandoned. Neither Lithuania, which was afraid of a negative result, nor Poland, which {{saw no reason to}} change status quo, wanted the plebiscite. The parties could not agree in which territory to carry out the vote and how Żeligowski's forces should be replaced by League's forces. The League of Nations then moved on from <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>solve</b> <b>the</b> narrow territorial dispute in the Vilnius Region to shaping the fundamental relationship between Poland and Lithuania. During 1921, Belgian Paul Hymans suggested several Polish–Lithuanian federation models, all rejected by both sides. In January 1922, parliamentary election to the Wilno Diet (Sejm wileński) resulted in a landslide Polish victory. In its first session on February 20, 1922, the Diet voted for incorporation into Poland as the Wilno Voivodeship. Polish Sejm accepted the resolution of the Diet. The League of Nations ended its efforts to mediate the dispute. After Lithuanians seized the Klaipėda Region in January 1923, the League saw recognition of Lithuanian interest in Klaipėda as adequate compensation for the loss of Vilnius. The League accepted the status quo in February 1923 by dividing the neutral zone and setting a demarcation line, which was recognized in March 1923 as the official Polish–Lithuanian border. Lithuania did not recognize this border.|$|E

Animals, instead of aliens, are featured as characters in the game. Chung explained that he did so because [...] "any fantastical creature design I came up with would pale in comparison to already-existing designs made by other people." [...] Therefore, instead of <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>solve</b> <b>the</b> problem of creating compelling alien characters, he switched to animals: [...] " [...] have certain built-in characteristics, they were fairly unique in how they weren't typically associated with space adventures." [...] In an interview with SquareGo, Chung revealed that board games such as Axis and Allies and Arkham Horror had an influential role in the game's development process.|$|E

Russia accused Georgia of <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>solve</b> <b>the</b> Abkhazia problem by force and of sending its troops in the Georgian-controlled upper Kodori Valley in Abkhazia. Russia announced it would increase its military {{in the region and}} threatened to [...] "retaliate" [...] militarily to Georgia's efforts.

2500|$|Unplanned {{content is}} an 'in the moment' idea, [...] "a spontaneous, {{tactical}} reaction." [...] (Cramer, 2014, p.6). The content could be trending {{and not have}} the time to take the planned content route. The unplanned content is posted sporadically and is not calendar/date/time arranged (Deshpande, 2014). Issues with unplanned content revolve around legal issues and whether the message being sent out represents the business/brand accordingly. If a company sends out a Tweet or Facebook message too hurriedly, the company may unintentionally use insensitive language or messaging that could alienate some consumers. For example, celebrity chef Paula Deen was criticized after she made a social media post commenting about HIV-AIDS and South Africa; her message was deemed to be offensive by many observers. The main difference between planned and unplanned is the time to approve the content. Unplanned content must still be approved by marketing managers, but in a much more rapid manner e.g. 1–2 hours or less. Sectors may miss errors because of being hurried. When using unplanned content Brito (2013) says, [...] "be prepared to be reactive and respond to issues when they arise." [...] Brito (2013) writes about having a, [...] "crisis escalation plan", because, [...] "It will happen". The plan involves breaking down the issue into topics and classifying the issue into groups. Colour coding the potential risk [...] "identify and flag potential risks" [...] also helps to organise an issue. The problem can then be handled by the correct team and dissolved more effectively rather than any person at hand <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>solve</b> <b>the</b> situation.|$|E
