5|$|Pottier {{also won}} the fourth stage.

When he saw the first other cyclists passing by, Pottier mounted his bicycle again, went after them, and won the stage. By this point, Pottier was leading the overall {{classification}} firmly. The winner of the 1905 Tour de France, Louis Trousselier, had had a bad first half of the Tour, and was many points behind. Trousselier rediscovered his form {{in the second half of}} the race, won the 7th, 9th, 10th and 11th stages, and was challenging the second place of Georges Passerieu. Passerieu defended his position by winning the 12th stage. In the last stage, Pottier showed his strength by winning the stage, after finishing together in Paris with Passerieu.|$|E
5|$|At the 2012 World's Best 10K he came third, {{beaten by}} Sammy Kitwara and Vincent Chepkok.

A run at the 2012 London Marathon saw him perform better than he did in 2010, but he lost touch with the leading pack after <b>the</b> <b>halfway</b> <b>point</b> and came fourteenth with a time of 2:10:41 hours. He was chosen as Eritrea's flag bearer at the 2012 London Olympics and ran in the 10,000 metres final. He set the pace early on in the race but was defeated in the sprint finish, finishing in sixth place some three seconds behind the winner Mo Farah. After the Olympics he ran at the 2012 World Half Marathon Championships. He dominated the race from just beyond the 5km point, and won it convincingly in a time of 1:00:19 hours, 32 seconds ahead of the runner-up, Deressa Chimsa. Only two weeks later he entered the Great Birmingham Run, but he appeared tired and finished third in a race where the top three all dipped under Haile Gebrselassie's course record.|$|E

5|$|Australia had {{previously}} won {{medals in the}} event, but was not {{regarded as one of}} the favourites for the gold, as the Soviet Union, Great Britain, and Sweden all fielded more decorated swimmers over the component legs of the relay. After the backstroke leg, Australia was in fourth place and more than a second in arrears of the Soviet leaders. However, Evans was the fastest among the breaststrokers and moved the team into second position at <b>the</b> <b>halfway</b> <b>point</b> in the race; and Tonelli, a makeshift butterflyer, completed his leg in a time much faster than his previous best, allowing Australia to keep the Soviet lead reasonable. Australia's anchor swimmer Brooks overtook his more credentialled Soviet counterpart Sergey Koplyakov in the latter half of the final leg to secure a narrow victory. The quartet disbanded after the Olympics due to Tonelli's retirement, although some of the members continued to be present in the relay team at various times alongside new swimmers. By 1986, all four members of the 1980 team had retired from international competition.|$|E
5|$|Players can unlock Vincent by <b>the</b> <b>halfway</b> <b>point</b> of Final Fantasy VII, when Cloud Strife and {{his allies}} find him {{sleeping}} in a coffin {{in the basement of}} Shinra Mansion in Nibelheim. Cloud mentions his quest to stop the game's antagonist, Sephiroth, who Vincent recognizes as the son of Lucrecia Crescent. Vincent joins the group when he learns that they may eventually meet up with Hojo, against whom Vincent has an unexplained vendetta. Later, Vincent finds Lucrecia inside a cave, and his backstory is partly revealed. Vincent {{was a member of the}} Turks, an elite group of Shinra agents. While serving as Lucrecia's guard, he fell in love with her, but she ultimately decided to remain faithful to Hojo, who persuaded her to use her unborn baby in his experiments. When protesting about the nature of these experiments, Vincent was shot by Hojo, who subsequently began to experiment on him as well. This resulted in him not aging and having the ability to transform in various demons. Not being able to protect Lucrecia, Vincent felt a strong guilt which led him to his isolation. Overcome by guilt, Lucrecia sealed herself away in Mako crystals. Upon entering the cave in the game, Lucrecia revives and asks Vincent if Sephiroth is still alive, but Vincent lies and tells her that he is dead.|$|E
5|$|Windle's {{performances}} qualified {{him for the}} 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, {{where he}} was slated to swim four events: the 400m and 1500m freestyle and the 4×100m and 4×200m freestyle relays. Windle's first event was the 4×100m freestyle relay, where he combined with Dickson, Peter Doak, and John Ryan to win Australia's heat {{in a time of}} 3min 40.6s, which lagged behind the United States' winning heat time by 1.8s. Windle anchored the team as Australia came from second at <b>the</b> <b>halfway</b> <b>point</b> to win their heat. The Australians were the second fastest qualifier for the finals. However, the United States improved their time by a further 5.6s in the final, but Australia could only improve their time to 3min 39.1s, leaving them third behind the Americans and Germans. Australia were in second place for the first two legs, until Germany moved into the silver medal position at the last change by 0.1s. A distance swimmer, Windle could not keep up with his German anchorman counterpart, and Australia fell 1.9s behind the silver medalists {{by the end of the}} race.|$|E
