30|$|A further {{difficulty}} arising {{during the}} analysis of towers with <b>truss</b> <b>elements</b> {{is the possibility of}} unstable assemblies forming a mechanism. During the FE solution phase, this will cause rigid body motion and the numerical solution will fail to converge. This fact is highlighted in [20] and [21]. This issue has most influence on dynamic analyses such as in a modal analysis, which is used to determine the natural frequencies of the structure. Modelling with <b>truss</b> <b>elements</b> means that the analytical structure has more dynamic degrees of freedom than in the actual case [21, 22, 23, 24]. Two possible solutions to overcome this problem are to either use dummy members in the model to suppress the unwanted degrees of freedom or to replace the <b>truss</b> <b>elements</b> with beam elements. The dummy members usually have a small axial stiffness which is large enough to eliminate any mechanisms that tend to form, while the use of beam elements retains the bending stiffness at the connections [21]. The work in [21] focused on the different results that can be obtained even using linear analysis by just changing the element types. The lattice tower was modelled using either a model made up of solely beam elements or using a model made up of combined beam and <b>truss</b> <b>elements.</b> The main legs were modelled using beam elements, while the bracing members were modelled using <b>truss</b> <b>elements.</b> Ref. [21] reports that the eigenvalue buckling capacity of the structure with a full beam element model was overestimated when compared to the combined beam and truss model. Caution in the element choice is therefore advised.|$|R

30|$|Currently VecTor 2 {{program does}} not have a {{specific}} element for modeling FRP materials. However, FRP fabric or sheets can be modeled using either smeared tension-only reinforcement layer or discrete tension-only <b>truss</b> <b>elements.</b> If the bond between FRP fabric and concrete is to be considered, only discrete <b>truss</b> <b>elements</b> can be used. FRP material is essentially elastic; i.e. prior to reaching the ultimate strength the material stress–strain relationship is linear and after that the material fails in a brittle manner. As the FRP material remains elastic, no special consideration needs to be given to the cyclic behavior. Essentially, loading and reloading follow the same path.|$|R

This form reveals how to generalize the element stiffness to 3-D space trusses by simply extending the pattern that is evident in this formulation. After developing the element stiffness matrix in the global coordinate system, they must be merged into a single “master” or “global” stiffness matrix. When merging these matrices together there are two rules that must be followed: compatibility of displacements and force equilibrium at each node. These rules are upheld by relating the element nodal displacements to the global nodal displacements.|$|E
30|$|Reinforcement can {{be modeled}} using either a smeared or a {{discrete}} representation. If bond-slip of reinforcement {{is to be}} considered, the use of discrete <b>truss</b> <b>elements</b> is unavoidable. On the other hand, when the longitudinal or transverse bars are sufficiently well distributed, smeared reinforcement is appropriate. Smeared reinforcement can be defined based on rebar percentage and rebar direction. The smeared reinforcement layer behaves as a unidirectional (in the specified direction) material. In order to model the discrete reinforcement, two-node <b>truss</b> bar <b>element</b> with four degrees of freedom is used.|$|R

40|$|The {{results of}} an {{experimental}} investigation into the behaviour of precast hybrid FRP-concrete, two-panel truss girders under static loading are presented. The investigation {{is part of a}} comprehensive research program on the development of a corrosion-free system for short and medium span bridges. The truss girders consist of pretensioned concrete chords connected by vertical and diagonal <b>truss</b> <b>elements</b> made of glass FRP tubes filled with concrete. The <b>truss</b> <b>elements</b> are reinforced and connected to the top and bottom chords by means of long double-headed steel or glass FRP bars. The top and bottom chords are also reinforced with glass FRP stirrups and double-headed longitudinal bars. This new system is expected to reduce the initial and maintenance costs and enhance the durability of bridges, and thus, extend their useful life. Moreover, by replacing the solid concrete web of traditional precast I-girders with the <b>truss</b> <b>elements,</b> the weight of the structure is significantly reduced, and thus, longer spans can be achieved and the number of supporting piers and size of the substructure can be reduced. The main objective of the research presented herein was to examine the efficiency of the FRP in comparison to steel reinforcement. The work included fabricating and testing three large-scale two-panel truss girders with an overall depth of 1. 32 m and length of 2. 83 m. The test parameters included the type and amount of reinforcement. The girders were tested under monotonic loading up to failure. The tests showed excellent results in terms of strength, stiffness, and connection performance of the truss girders...|$|R
