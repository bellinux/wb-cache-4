5|$|To {{promote the}} game, Valve has {{produced}} three machinima trailers depicting {{the game in}} play. <b>The</b> <b>trailers</b> are themed around wartime propaganda news reports for both Germany and the United States. To convey this effect, <b>the</b> <b>trailers</b> make extensive usage of the Source engine's capabilities for film grain, color correction, motion blur and depth of field, as well as sepia toning. The first trailer was released {{as part of the}} game's post-release marketing on December 20, 2005. Entitled Prelude to Victory, the trailer depicted a large firefight in the game as a report from the German perspective, complete with a commentator speaking in the German language. Two further trailers were released to promote the major update to Day of Defeat: Source {{in the second quarter of}} 2006. <b>The</b> <b>trailers,</b> both from the American viewpoint, displayed how the new detonation gameplay worked, emphasising teamwork as the key to success, as well as introducing the viewer to the two new maps added by the update. To further create interest in the game, Valve has opened Day of Defeat: Source to three free weekends, the first taking place on February 10, 2006, the second on July 8, 2006 and the third on July 4, 2008, where anyone with a Steam account could download and play the game for a maximum of 48 hours free of charge.|$|E
5|$|Death Proof and Planet Terror were {{released}} separately on DVD in the United States. <b>The</b> <b>trailers</b> were omitted from Death Proof, {{with the exception}} of Machete which was from Planet Terror. Death Proof was released on September 18, 2007, with Planet Terror following on October 16, 2007. Both were two-disc special editions featuring extended versions of the films. Robert Rodriguez stated in his 10-Minute Film School that a box set of the two films would be available soon, and that his 10-Minute Cook School would appear on it. This release would also reportedly include Hobo with a Shotgun. A six-DVD edition of the film was released on March 21, 2008 in Japan, featuring the films in both their individual extended versions and in the abridged double feature presentation along with previously-unreleased special features.|$|E
50|$|The current {{controlling}} the brakes from the towing vehicle is {{originating in the}} battery/alternator of the towing vehicle via the brake controller and then transferred via wiring through the electric brake pin in <b>the</b> <b>trailer</b> connector through <b>the</b> <b>trailer</b> wiring to <b>the</b> electromagnet and back through <b>the</b> <b>trailer</b> wiring to <b>the</b> <b>trailer</b> connector and to the towing vehicle chassis/frame through the ground pin in <b>the</b> <b>trailer</b> connector.|$|R
5|$|The lack of {{gameplay}} {{information was}} also criticized. Laura Parker found <b>the</b> <b>trailer</b> disconnected from <b>the</b> actual game, with <b>the</b> <b>trailer</b> being misleading by not showing any in-game information, {{and with the}} game failing to deliver the same emotional effect as <b>the</b> <b>trailer.</b> Daemon Hatfield from IGN similarly thought that <b>the</b> <b>trailer</b> was not useful in assessing the game's quality and expressed concerns that the game {{would not be as}} entertaining and interesting as <b>the</b> <b>trailer.</b> Upon release, many reviewers thought that <b>the</b> <b>trailer</b> had set expectation too high for the actual game, and that the game ended up not meeting expectations.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>trailer</b> for Into <b>the</b> Darkness {{was filmed}} in early August. <b>The</b> <b>trailer</b> {{was shot in}} two days, around the 8th and 9th, in Middle Tennessee with an {{estimated}} budget of $12K. Locations included Great Falls at Rock Island State Park, Lost Creek Waterfall and Cave, and Cumberland Caverns. The director of photography, Nate Tieman of Los Angeles, filmed <b>the</b> <b>trailer</b> using <b>the</b> Red One camera. <b>The</b> <b>trailer</b> was directed by Dustin Masters and produced by Paul Moser of Moser Productions LLC. They only needed part of the cast to make <b>the</b> <b>trailer.</b> <b>The</b> actors playing the leads and other actors playing key characters to better set up the scenes that participated in <b>the</b> <b>trailer</b> include: Kiowa Gordon, Wolfgang Weber, Anna Enger, Dalal Bruchmann, Russ Russo, Ronnie Patel, Brad Kaplan, Candace Keaton, Samuel Doak, Jade Moser and Darian O'Rear. <b>The</b> <b>trailer</b> is set to debut in October and behind the scenes images have been released on the film's official sites. The first cast promotional image featuring the main four was released on September 8, 2009. The promotional poster for <b>the</b> <b>trailer</b> is rumored to be released {{a week before the}} debut of <b>the</b> <b>trailer.</b>|$|R
5|$|Jonathan Nolan {{designed}} the film's official website. As with the marketing strategy of The Blair Witch Project, the website {{was intended to}} provide further clues and hints to the story, while not providing any concrete information. After a short intro on the website, the viewer is shown a newspaper clipping detailing Leonard's murder of Teddy. Clicking on highlighted words in the article leads to more material describing the film, including Leonard's notes and photographs as well as police reports. The filmmakers employed another tactic by sending out Polaroid pictures to random people, depicting a bloody and shirtless Leonard pointing at an unmarked spot on his chest. Since Newmarket distributed the film themselves, Christopher Nolan edited the film's trailers himself. Sold to inexpensive cable-TV channels like Bravo and A, and websites such as Yahoo and MSN, <b>the</b> <b>trailers</b> were key to the film gaining widespread public notice.|$|E
5|$|The Incredible Hulk joined Toronto's Green-Screen initiative, to help cut carbon {{emissions}} and waste created during filming. Producer Gale Anne Hurd acknowledged the Hulk, being green, {{was a popular}} environmental analogy, and Norton himself was an environmentalist. Hybrid and fuel efficient vehicles were used, with low sulfur diesel as their energy source. The construction department used a sustainably harvested, locally sourced yellow pine instead of lauan for the sets, and also used zero-or low-VOC paint. The wood was generally recycled or given to environmental organizations, and paint cans were handed to waste management. In addition, they used cloth bags, biodegradable food containers, china and silverware food utensils, a stainless steel mug for each production crew member, a contractor who removed bins, recycled paper, biodegradable soap and cleaners in <b>the</b> <b>trailers</b> and production offices, and the sound department used rechargeable batteries. The Incredible Hulk became the first blockbuster film to receive the Environmental Media Association's Green Seal, which is displayed during the end credits.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>trailer</b> for <b>the</b> {{film was}} {{released}} online in early February 2016. <b>The</b> <b>trailer</b> garnered {{close to a}} million views by February 22, 2016. By April 15, 2016, the views garnered by <b>the</b> <b>trailer</b> counted almost 4 million.|$|R
5000|$|Music helps set {{the tone}} and mood of <b>the</b> <b>trailer.</b> Usually <b>the</b> music used in <b>the</b> <b>trailer</b> is not from the film itself (the film score {{may not have been}} {{composed}} yet). The music used in <b>the</b> <b>trailer</b> may be: ...|$|R
50|$|A rolloader crane is a loader crane {{mounted on}} a chassis with wheels. This chassis can ride on <b>the</b> <b>trailer.</b> Because <b>the</b> crane can move on <b>the</b> <b>trailer,</b> {{it can be a}} light crane, so <b>the</b> <b>trailer</b> is allowed to {{transport}} more goods.|$|R
25|$|In the 1950s bushrangers reappeared in the Gundagai area, {{jumping into}} <b>the</b> <b>trailers</b> of heavy {{transports}} moving along the Hume Highway and throwing contents out to nearby accomplices.|$|E
25|$|BE (car {{with heavy}} trailer) = The driver may use a heavy trailer {{for his or}} her car. There is no limit {{concerning}} the number of trailers, although restricted by the maximum length of an equipage. Licenses issued before 2013 have no weight limit on <b>the</b> <b>trailers,</b> licenses issued since 2013 are limited to 3.5 tonnes total trailer weight. Even if licenses have no weight limit, the towing vehicles and <b>the</b> <b>trailers</b> have such limits, which can be up to 3.5 tonnes for some cars.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>trailers</b> were {{constructed}} principally of aluminium alloy on a steel underframe. The cars were arranged internally with two saloons separted by {{male and female}} toilets. Entrance doors and vestibules were provided at each end.|$|E
50|$|When {{used for}} {{launching}} and retrieving small boats, <b>the</b> <b>trailer</b> {{is placed in}} the water. The boat may be either floated on and off <b>the</b> <b>trailer</b> or pulled off. When recovering the boat from the water, it is winched back up <b>the</b> <b>trailer.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> first <b>trailer</b> was {{released}} on 29 March 2007 at 22:00 UTC. At <b>the</b> time <b>the</b> <b>trailer</b> {{was released}}, Rockstar's servers for <b>the</b> <b>trailer's</b> official website became almost immediately overloaded.|$|R
50|$|Sony Music India {{released}} <b>the</b> <b>trailer</b> on 5 October 2015. One {{day before}} the official release, <b>the</b> <b>trailer</b> was leaked on the video sharing website YouTube on 4 October which was later removed by YouTube. <b>The</b> <b>trailer</b> garnered about two lakh views in two days.|$|R
25|$|From 1917 the {{modified}} trailers were rebuilt. The carriages and undercarriages {{of two and}} two units were split and merged to make a larger unit, to create ten new trailers. These were numbered 356 through 365. They were at first used on the Lilleaker Line. KES was merged with KSS in 1924 to form Oslo Sporveier and <b>the</b> <b>trailers</b> were transferred to the new company. There the ex-motor trailers were renumbered 474 through 483. They continued in service until 1949, when {{the closing of the}} Korsvoll Line and the Rodeløkka Line created surplus rolling stock which could be retired. <b>The</b> <b>trailers</b> were scrapped from April 1951 to March 1952.|$|E
25|$|The {{accommodation}} was of {{the open}} saloon type, then a novelty in Britain; there were gate entrances {{at the end of}} the vehicles. <b>The</b> <b>trailers</b> seated 56 persons, and the motor coaches seated 46, with a raised section over the motor bogie.|$|E
25|$|Videos that parody <b>the</b> <b>trailers</b> of {{upcoming}} movies, featuring Marvel and DC characters. Most of {{them are}} a drugged Spider-Man's dreams, which seem to entertain the heroes with an exception for Batman (although {{he appeared to be}} the one to start the trend in the first place).|$|E
5000|$|On July 9, 2014, the book's author, E. L. James, said on Twitter that <b>the</b> film's <b>trailer</b> {{would be}} {{released}} on July 24, 2014. Beyoncé debuted a teaser for <b>the</b> <b>trailer</b> on her Instagram account five days before <b>the</b> <b>trailer's</b> release. On July 24, Dornan and Johnson were on The Today Show to present part of <b>the</b> <b>trailer</b> appropriate for morning television; <b>the</b> full <b>trailer,</b> which contained more racy scenes, was released later the same day on the internet (200 days before its initial theatrical release). <b>The</b> <b>trailer</b> featured {{a new version of}} [...] "Crazy in Love" [...] by Beyoncé, which was scored and arranged by her frequent collaborator Boots. <b>The</b> <b>trailer</b> was viewed 36.4 million times in the week after its July 24 release.

And by late February, Fifty Shades of Grey related material garnered over 329 million views including 113 million views for its official trailer. A second trailer was released on November 13, 2014. A third trailer aired during Super Bowl XLIX, on February 1, 2015.|$|R
50|$|Nick also frees {{the infant}} T. rex and {{takes it to}} <b>the</b> <b>trailer</b> to mend its broken leg. After {{securing}} Kelly with Eddie, Ian realizes the infant's parents are searching for it and rushes to <b>the</b> <b>trailer.</b> As soon as Ian arrives, the infant's parents emerge {{on both sides of}} <b>the</b> <b>trailer.</b> <b>The</b> infant is released to the adult T. rexes, which then attack <b>the</b> <b>trailer,</b> pushing it over the edge of a nearby cliff. Eddie soon arrives, but as he tries to pull <b>the</b> <b>trailer</b> back over <b>the</b> edge with an SUV, the adult T. rexes return and devour him. <b>The</b> <b>trailer</b> and <b>the</b> SUV both plummet off the cliff and are destroyed. Ian, Sarah, and Nick are rescued by the InGen team, along with Kelly. With both groups' communications equipment and vehicles destroyed, they team up to search for the old InGen compound's radio station on foot.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>trailer</b> {{advertising}} Mr. Burns' {{search for}} an heir is a loose parody of <b>the</b> <b>trailer</b> for Toys, a 1992 comedy starring Robin Williams.|$|R
25|$|The first Chicken, no. 33, was {{met with}} dissatisfaction by the employees. They were built without air brakes, which meant that the {{conductor}} would have to traverse a full tram to reach the emergency brake should the motorman fall unconscious. The railway authorities sided with the employees, requiring the company to rebuild the unit. A similar concern was raised concerning <b>the</b> <b>trailers.</b> As air brakes are fail safe, <b>the</b> <b>trailers</b> would automatically brake should the trailer become disconnected. With the need for pressurized air system in place, the advantages of pneumatic door were reaped. However, the pneumatics systems largely ate up the costs savings of rebuilding material. Most of the work was carried out at Sagene Depot, and was carried out between mid-1954 to 1958.|$|E
25|$|Smaller {{container}} cranes, such as straddle carriers, {{are used}} at railway sidings to transfer containers from flatcars and well cars to semi-trailers or vice versa. Both {{the rolling stock}} and <b>the</b> <b>trailers</b> may pass under the base. Smaller container cranes are also used at break-of-gauge transloading facilities.|$|E
25|$|The Nevada Supreme Court {{upheld the}} right of a county to legalize prostitution, and several {{counties}} followed suit. Conforte converted <b>the</b> <b>trailers</b> into a permanent structure with 54 bedrooms. Mustang I had a spa room with jacuzzi. The swimming pool was for adult play.|$|E

The [...] "TCSZ" [...] on <b>the</b> <b>trailer</b> is <b>the</b> AAR {{reporting}} mark for Triple Crown Service. <b>The</b> <b>trailer</b> number beginning with 464 indicates that <b>the</b> <b>trailer</b> was built approximately 1999-2002, and weighs only 1000 lb more than a regular highway-only trailer.|$|R
40|$|Stability of {{a vehicle}} and tire wear is {{affected}} by the movement inference between the tractor and <b>the</b> <b>trailer</b> when <b>the</b> <b>trailer</b> is turning. Therefore, to solve the problem, Compliant Steering (CS) system is used. The system makes the rear-wheel of <b>the</b> <b>trailer</b> steer. After establishing a dynamic model of <b>the</b> <b>trailer</b> and <b>the</b> CS system, the simulation result shows that the system has a smaller lateral force. This smaller force at the hinge point indicates movement inference is reduced and motion response is far better. Furthermore, this paper contains the analysis of the influence of the key parameters of CS system and the speed on the moving characteristics of <b>the</b> <b>trailer...</b>|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>trailers</b> also {{received}} a renovation from 1921 to 1925, although the body and interior remained intact. The main upgrades included new connectors {{to allow them to}} run in multiple with newer trams and track brakes. With these upgrades <b>the</b> <b>trailers</b> normally ran with SS trams. One trailer was requisitioned by the German occupation forces and moved to the Stettin Tramway. It was numbered 519 and remained in service until 1945. One trailer collided on 16 May 1944 and was subsequently retired. The remaining nineteen units remained in service until May 1966 and October 1967, respectively. Many of the older undercarriages were rebuilt to maintenance of way material. This included five ballast cars, six flatcars and various other specialized vehicles. As of 1996 many were still in use.|$|E

25|$|Another {{special feature}} is a Turner Classic Movies documentary, Becoming Attractions: <b>The</b> <b>Trailers</b> of Humphrey Bogart. Hosted by TCM's Robert Osborne, the 45-minute feature traces Bogart's {{evolution}} from a heavy in the 1930s to a romantic leading {{man in the}} 1940s, and his return to playing bad men late in that decade.|$|E
5000|$|A trailer coupler is used {{to secure}} <b>the</b> <b>trailer</b> to <b>the</b> towing vehicle. <b>The</b> <b>trailer</b> coupler {{attaches}} to <b>the</b> <b>trailer</b> ball. This forms a {{ball and socket connection}} to allow for relative movement between the towing vehicle and trailer while towing over uneven road surfaces. <b>The</b> <b>trailer</b> ball is mounted to the rear bumper or to a draw bar, which may be removable. The draw bar is secured to <b>the</b> <b>trailer</b> hitch by inserting it into the hitch receiver and pinning it. The three most common types of couplers are straight couplers, A-frame couplers, and adjustable couplers. Bumper-pull hitches and draw bars can exert tremendous leverage on the tow vehicle making it harder to recover from a swerving situation.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>trailer</b> premiered on Saturday, 3 September 2016 at the Days of the Dead Convention. Shortly {{after the}} premier, horror site Bloody Disgusting hosted <b>the</b> <b>trailer.</b>|$|R
