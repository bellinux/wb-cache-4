5|$|And, it is {{a mistake}} <b>to</b> <b>think,</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> most {{hardened}} sinner, who oweth his possessions or titles to any such wicked arts of thieving, can have true peace of mind, under the reproaches of a guilty conscience, and amid the cries of ruined widows and orphans.|$|E
5|$|With {{approximately}} {{two minutes of}} normal time left, the referee's whistle blew for an infringement. Stein however appeared <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> final whistle had been blown, as he rose from his seat and began {{to make his way}} towards the Welsh bench to shake hands with England. However, as he got up, he then fell to his knees before collapsing to the ground. He was immediately carried to the stadium's medical room where attempts were made to resuscitate him.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Mulder's mother Teena {{is found}} dead in her home. It is found she overdosed on {{sleeping}} pills after she burned all her pictures of Samantha and placed tape around her baseboards and turned the gas in the oven on. Mulder believes she was murdered and has Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) do an autopsy. Later, Mulder visits the mother who was convicted twelve years prior. She tells him that Samantha is a walk-in, a kind spirit who takes children {{so that they may}} be shielded from potential harm in their life. The mother tells Mulder that the children are safe, but she has no idea where they are. After hearing this, Mulder believes his mother probably also wrote a note after his sister's disappearance. He begins <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> alien abduction never happened, and that his mother figured this out, which is why she was murdered. However, after performing the autopsy, Scully tells Mulder that it was definitely suicide, because she was ill with Paget's carcinoma.|$|E

60|$|He seemed <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that,</b> {{considering}} <b>the</b> {{great risk}} he was taking, a hundred per cent per annum {{was not an}} exorbitant usury.|$|R

5|$|The economic, {{social and}} {{cultural}} dislocation of ordinary people, the economic hardship of an economy in transition, and the pressures of meteorological disasters all contributed to growing problems in Central Europe. The failure {{of most of the}} governments to deal with the food crisis of the mid-1840s, caused by the potato blight (related to the Great Irish Famine) and several seasons of bad weather, encouraged many <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> rich and powerful had no interest in their problems. Those in authority were concerned about the growing unrest, political and social agitation among the working classes, and the disaffection of the intelligentsia. No amount of censorship, fines, imprisonment, or banishment, it seemed, could stem the criticism. Furthermore, it was becoming increasingly clear that both Austria and Prussia wanted to be the leaders in any resulting unification; each would inhibit the drive of the other to achieve unification.|$|E
5|$|When Tsar Nicholas II of Russia, George's {{first cousin}} (their mothers were sisters), was overthrown in the Russian Revolution of 1917, the British {{government}} offered political asylum to the Tsar and his family, but worsening {{conditions for the}} British people, and fears that revolution might come to the British Isles, led George <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> presence of the Romanovs {{would be seen as}} inappropriate. Despite the later claims of Lord Mountbatten of Burma that Prime Minister Lloyd George was opposed to the rescue of the Russian imperial family, the letters of Lord Stamfordham suggest that it was GeorgeV who opposed the idea against the advice of the government. Advanced planning for a rescue was undertaken by MI1, a branch of the British secret service, but because of the strengthening position of the Bolshevik revolutionaries and wider difficulties with the conduct of the war, the plan was never put into operation. The Tsar and his immediate family remained in Russia, where they were murdered by Bolsheviks in 1918. The following year, Nicholas's mother (George's aunt) Maria Feodorovna (Dagmar of Denmark) {{and other members of the}} extended Russian imperial family were rescued from the Crimea by a British warship.|$|E
25|$|Some Muslim {{scholars}} puzzled {{over the}} mention of offerings in the narrative of Cain and Abel. Offerings and sacrifices were ordained only after the revelation of the Torah to Moses. This led some scholars, such as Said ibn al-Musayyib, <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> sons of Adam mentioned in the Quran are actually two Israelites, not Cain and Abel.|$|E
60|$|I began <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> all <b>the</b> vagrants in New England were {{converging}} to the camp-meeting and {{had made}} this wagon, their rendezvous by the way.|$|R
6000|$|... "Am I presumptuous, child, <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> haply <b>the</b> {{meditation}} {{in which}} I found you rapt was for one, unworthy though he be, who went hence but some few days since?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{know there}} is a difficulty. I know that. But I am {{inclined}} <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> in <b>the</b> interests of the parish I am bound to issue a commission of inquiry." ...|$|R
25|$|While {{the murderer}} of Patrick's {{assistant}} {{was killed and}} immediately sent to heaven because he was forgiven by Patrick, future murderers were to be pardoned as Patrick would not be around to assure their forgiveness and ascent to heaven. There is, however, no reason <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> events described actually occurred although they do provide insight into how the Brehons thought about their own law.|$|E
25|$|However, {{with the}} {{technological}} advances, {{the government has}} received the ability to invade privacy in more subtle ways; further, {{there is no reason}} <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> rate of such technological advances will slow down. “Can it be that the Constitution affords no protection against such invasions of individual security?”, Brandeis asks. He answers that a clear negative answer is evident in Boyd v. United States.|$|E
25|$|After the {{traditional}} three-day wait before {{one can see}} an African big chief, Msiri received them courteously on 17 December 1891. Gifts were presented and negotiations started. Both sides feigned the possibility of future compliance with the other's demands. Msiri wanted gunpowder and removal of Legat, Stairs wanted to fly the Free State flag over Bunkeya. Stairs seemed <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Le Marinel letter indicated Msiri's acquiescence, but it was vague, and Msiri repudiated any such interpretation.|$|E
6000|$|... "They haven't," [...] {{admitted}} Nasmyth whimsically. [...] "As {{a matter}} of fact, they very seldom do. Still, I wouldn't like you <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> was <b>the</b> only reason I am glad to get back." ...|$|R
60|$|And {{it is by}} {{no means}} {{distressing}} <b>to</b> <b>think,</b> <b>that</b> though <b>the</b> people who may be in this country three thousand years hence may possibly find some of our monuments, they will discover none of our bodies.|$|R
6000|$|ROBERTS: [...] "They're {{very nice}} young newly married people. He's {{something}} or other {{of some kind of}} manufactures. And Mrs. Miller is disposed <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> all <b>the</b> other ladies are as fond of him as she is." ...|$|R
25|$|It {{is tempting}} <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> notion of {{function}} problems is much richer than {{the notion of}} decision problems. However, this is not really the case, since function problems can be recast as decision problems. For example, the multiplication of two integers can be expressed as the set of triples (a,b,c) such that the relation a×b=c holds. Deciding whether a given triple {{is a member of}} this set corresponds to solving the problem of multiplying two numbers.|$|E
25|$|First, {{the north}} flank engaged the Song forces but were repulsed. The Yuan then began playing festive music, leading the Song <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Yuan forces {{were having a}} banquet and {{lowering}} their guard. At noon Zhang Hongfan attacked from the front, hiding additional soldiers under large pieces of cloth. Once Zhang Hongfan's boats neared the Song fleet, the Yuan sounded the horn of battle, revealing the soldiers under the fabric.|$|E
25|$|A multinomial discrete-choice {{model can}} examine the {{responses}} to these questions (model G, model H, model I). However, these models are derived under the concept that the respondent obtains some utility for each possible answer and gives the answer that provides the greatest utility. It might be more natural <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> respondent has some latent measure or index associated with the question and answers in response to how high this measure is. Ordered logit and ordered probit models are derived under this concept.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{had never}} {{imagined}} {{that he would}} have been impetuous. And he seems <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> even <b>the</b> business of getting himself married would not justify him staying away from Parliament. He is a rigid martinet in all matters of duty." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Why,' he said, 'don't you {{remember}} Tom Thorne, whose father the squire turned {{out of the}} public house? And <b>to</b> <b>think,</b> now, <b>that</b> <b>the</b> squire's daughters are waiting on me. This is a piece of luck.|$|R
6000|$|I began <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> in <b>the</b> {{confusion}} he {{had given}} us the slip, when presently from {{the far end of}} the line, for we were still all tied to our stakes, I heard the voice of Sammy, hoarse, it is true, but quite cheerful now, saying: ...|$|R
25|$|Clarkson visited The Lively, an African trading ship. Although not a slave ship, {{it carried}} cargo {{of high quality}} goods: carved ivory and woven textiles, beeswax, and produce such as palm oil and peppers. Impressed by the high quality of {{craftsmanship}} and skill expressed in these items, Clarkson was horrified <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> people who could create such items were being enslaved. He bought samples from the ship and started a collection to which he added over the years. It included crops, spices and raw materials, along with refined trade goods.|$|E
25|$|It {{would seem}} {{reasonable}} <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> regular spacing and size uniformity {{of fish in}} schools would result in hydrodynamic efficiencies. However, experiments in the laboratory have failed to find any gains from the hydrodynamic lift created by the neighbours of a fish within a school, though it is still thought that efficiency gains do occur in the wild. Landa (1998) argues that {{the leader of a}} school constantly changes, because while being in the body of a school gives a hydrodynamic advantage, being the leader means you are the first to the food.|$|E
25|$|Today, the Ten Commandments {{are heard}} in the synagogue three times a year: as they come up during the {{readings}} of Exodus and Deuteronomy, and during the festival of Shavuot. The Exodus version is read in parashat Yitro around late January–February, and on the festival of Shavuot, and the Deuteronomy version in parashat Va'etchanan in August–September. In some traditions, worshipers rise for {{the reading of the}} Ten Commandments to highlight their special significance though many rabbis, including Maimonides, have opposed this custom since one may come <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Ten Commandments are more important {{than the rest of the}} Mitzvot.|$|E
5000|$|Unfazed, Niven {{turned to}} the {{audience}} and quipped, [...] "Well, ladies and gentlemen, that was almost bound to happen... But isn't it fascinating <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> probably <b>the</b> only laugh <b>that</b> man will ever get in his life is by stripping off and showing his shortcomings?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's what worried me, until I {{thought of}} the slippers," [...] said the Scarecrow. [...] "You'll have <b>to</b> <b>THINK,</b> Dorothy; <b>that's</b> <b>the</b> {{only way to get}} a good idea. If I hadn't such {{wonderful}} brains, I'd never have thought of those straw foot-decorations." ...|$|R
25|$|In 11Q13 Melchizedek is {{referred}} to as god the divine judge. Melchizedek in the bible was the king of Salem. At least some in the Qumran community seemed <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> at <b>the</b> end of days Melchizedek would reign as their king. The passage is based on Psalm 82.|$|R
25|$|In 1982, {{evolutionary}} biologist Daniel H. Janzen {{concluded that}} the avocado {{is an example of}} an 'evolutionary anachronism', a fruit adapted for ecological relationship with now-extinct large mammals (such as giant ground sloths or gomphotheres). Most large fleshy fruits serve the function of seed dispersal, accomplished by their consumption by large animals. There are some reasons <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> fruit, with its mildly toxic pit, may have coevolved with Pleistocene megafauna to be swallowed whole and excreted in their dung, ready to sprout. No extant native animal is large enough to effectively disperse avocado seeds in this fashion.|$|E
25|$|It {{seemed to}} strike an {{extraordinary}} {{balance between the}} psychological and the supernatural {{in such a way}} as to lead you <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> supernatural would eventually be explained by the psychological: 'Jack must be imagining these things because he's crazy.' This allowed you to suspend your doubt of the supernatural until you were so thoroughly into the story that you could accept it almost without noticing...It's not until Grady, the ghost of the former caretaker who axed to death his family, slides open the bolt of the larder door, allowing Jack to escape, that you are left with no other explanation but the supernatural.|$|E
25|$|Paneb {{was accused}} of many charges of sexual assault and adultery, though there are many ambiguities in the text which make {{the exact nature of}} the charges unclear. The charges are special in that they are alleged by his son Aapehty to the door-keepers, who are the people who stand {{at the door of the}} tomb at work-sites, but also serve various other functions, {{including}} possible legal functions. Though Černý seems <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> door-keepers might have served the role of bailiffs, A.G. McDowell, a prominent Egyptologist in the study of Deir el-Medina, speculates that the door-keepers' legal function was small, and that Aapehty only testified to them because they stood in a public part of the worksite.|$|E
50|$|According to {{the former}} President of Romania Traian Băsescu, who does not {{appreciate}} Crown Princess Margareta's husband, <b>the</b> Romanians seem <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> were <b>the</b> monarchy restored, Radu would become their king, something which, according to Băsescu, impacts negatively the Romanians' public perception {{of the idea of}} monarchy.|$|R
