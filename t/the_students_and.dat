5|$|Sources differ {{about the}} cities hosting {{some of the}} early IMOs. This may be partly because leaders are {{generally}} housed well away from <b>the</b> <b>students,</b> <b>and</b> partly because after the competition the students did not always stay based in one city {{for the rest of the}} IMO. The exact dates cited may also differ, because of leaders arriving before <b>the</b> <b>students,</b> <b>and</b> at more recent IMOs the IMO Advisory Board arriving before the leaders.|$|E
5|$|By the {{following}} day a deal was brokered between <b>the</b> <b>students</b> <b>and</b> university officials, and on April 20, the takeover ended, with the administration ceding {{to some of the}} Afro-American Society's demands. The students emerged making a black-power salute and with guns in hand (the guns had been brought into Willard Straight Hall after the initial takeover). James A. Perkins, president of Cornell during the events, would resign soon after the crisis.|$|E

30|$|The {{research}} questions were addressed using students’ eighth grade mathematics achievement, the instructional practices reported by their teachers, {{as well as}} information about <b>the</b> <b>student</b> body in <b>the</b> sampled schools.

5|$|In 1901 he was {{appointed}} as {{a research fellow at}} the Royal Frederick University.

In 1908 he took his dr.philos. degree on the thesis Die Stellung Norwegens und Schwedens im Deutsch-Dänischen Konflikt 1863–1864. Opponents at the dissertation were Ebbe Hertzberg and Yngvar Nielsen.|$|E
5|$|In January 1966, {{university}} students {{under the banner}} of KAMI, begin demonstrations against the Sukarno government voicing demands for the disbandment of PKI and control of hyperinflation. The students received support and protection with the army, with Suharto often engaging in coordination meetings with student leaders. Street fights broke out between <b>the</b> <b>students</b> <b>and</b> pro-Sukarno loyalists with the pro-Suharto students prevailing due to army protection.|$|E

Supporters of the government won the June elections by a large majority. The May 1968 events in France resulted in the break-up of the University of Paris into 13 independent campuses.|$|E

50|$|As the {{instructors}} freefall with <b>the</b> <b>student,</b> {{they are able}} to correct <b>the</b> <b>student's</b> body position <b>and</b> other problems during freefall by communicating with <b>the</b> <b>student</b> with hand signals in freefall <b>and</b> debriefing <b>the</b> <b>student</b> <b>and</b> conducting corrective training after the jump. Later levels only require one instructor <b>and</b> involve <b>the</b> <b>student</b> learning to perform aerial maneuvers such as turns, forward movement, flips, and fall rate control.

5|$|La Papillote, the school's student newspaper, was {{established}} in 1979.

The editor-in-chief position is held by a current student, and the paper uses submissions from students, chefs, and outside professionals.|$|E

5|$|Freshmen were {{expected}} to build the early Bonfires to help prove their worth. For almost two decades, the students constructed Bonfire from debris and wood acquired through various, sometimes illicit, means, including appropriating lumber intended for a dormitory in 1912. In 1935, a farmer reported that students carried off his entire barn as fuel for Bonfire. To prevent future incidents, the university made Bonfire a school-sanctioned event. The following year, for the first time, the school provided axes, saws, and trucks for <b>the</b> <b>students</b> <b>and</b> pointed them toward a grove of dead trees {{on the edge of}} town.|$|E

5|$|More than 300 {{hours of}} footage was {{recorded}} by <b>the</b> <b>students</b> <b>and</b> the two Iraqi associate producers. It was transcribed, translated and edited into a 90-minute film. Getting the tapes out of Iraq proved difficult for Winter and O'Mahoney, {{who remained in}} the UK. They {{had to rely on}} journalists from many news agencies, especially those in the BBC News's Baghdad Bureau high-risk team, to smuggle the tapes out of Iraq. When curfews were enforced, weeks passed before the producers received new footage because it was impossible for anybody to leave their homes or the country.|$|E
5|$|Nanako is {{an extreme}} tomboy with an {{insensitive}} personality. Like Akira Uehara, she becomes popular with <b>the</b> <b>students</b> <b>and</b> Akira's parents after the exchange due to her personality and Akira's masculine appearance. Initially Nanako intended {{to return to her}} body after having fun as a male and was very strict on how Akira treated her body. She resolves to stay in Akira's body and relents her body's ownership to Akira after she falls completely in love with her friend, Makoto Shiina. Her parents learn about the exchange and are supportive of the statusquo as they accept Nanako's hopelessness as a female. She is voiced by Miyuki Sawashiro in the three radio dramas and is portrayed by Mai Takahashi in the live action film.|$|E
5|$|On Sunday, February 25, 1917, Danebod Folk School {{burned to}} the grown. Fortunately, the fire burned slowly. <b>The</b> <b>students</b> <b>and</b> the quickly summoned neighbors had time to rescue much of the {{furniture}} and other items of high value. Nearby buildings were saved, but the Folk School was beyond rescue. In the fall of 1917, nine months after the disastrous fire, a new and larger Folk School was dedicated. Speakers at the dedicatory exercises were Pastor Knudsen, C.P. Højbjerg, Aage Møller, P.Rasmussen, and Kristian Østergaard. Meanwhile, a terrible epidemic of influenza swept the county, and all churches and schools were temporarily closed {{in an effort to}} halt the deadly disease; but many people died. Another catastrophe followed on August21, 1918, when a devastating tornado tore through Lincoln County. It was the fourth most deadly tornado in Minnesota history and took the lives of 36 people and injured a dozen more.|$|E

5|$|Other {{victims were}} college students, {{many of whom}} were {{expelled}} from their institutions and had their careers destroyed, academic teachers who tried to defend <b>the</b> <b>students</b> <b>and</b> the academic institutions themselves: Warsaw University had several departments administratively dissolved. Liberal intelligentsia members, Jewish or not, were removed from the government and other places of employment. Leftist intellectuals and student leaders lost what was left of their faith in the ostensibly socialist government. Finally the party itself was purged of many thousand suspect members, people who somehow did not fit the new environment of intolerance and hatred. The 1968 purges meant also the beginning of a large scale generational replacement of the party executive membership, a process that continued into the early 1970s, after Gomułka's departure. The prewar communist cadres were removed and people whose careers were formed in People's Poland took their place, which, early in his term, gave Gomułka's successor Edward Gierek one of the youngest in Europe elites of power.|$|E
5|$|The Ascensio Scholarum, {{inherited}} from the College of St Omer, in its present form, is the opening address of the headmaster {{at the beginning of}} the year to the entire school gathered in the Academy Room. Previously, it was a formal transition for pupils from one playroom to the next {{at the beginning of the}} year, which involved a pupil from each year announcing to the playroom of the year below them that the next playroom had been vacated by the senior pupils. <b>The</b> <b>students</b> <b>and</b> their belongings would then move up to their next playroom.|$|E
5|$|The Philaletheis Society (often {{shortened}} to Philaletheis or just Phil {{and founded}} as The Philalethean Society) {{is a student}} theatre group at Vassar College {{in the town of}} Poughkeepsie, New York, and the school's oldest student organization. Founded in December 1865, Phil began as a college literary society and its first leader was college president John Howard Raymond. Control of the organization was swiftly handed to <b>the</b> <b>students</b> <b>and</b> the group split into three chapters, each with a distinct focus. The group maintained its literary focus until the 1890s, by which point dramatic productions had taken over in popularity. The tradition of producing four and later three plays per year continued into the mid-twentieth century, but in 1958, the organization disbanded due to lack of interest. It was revived in 1975, first as an arm of student government and then as an independent student organization.|$|E
