40|$|Diver <b>visibility</b> {{analyses}} <b>and</b> predictions, <b>and</b> water <b>transparency</b> in general, are {{of significant}} military and commercial interest. This {{is especially true}} in our current state, where ports and harbors are vulnerable to terrorist attacks from a variety of platforms both on and below the water (swimmers, divers, AUVs, ships, submarines, etc.). Aircraft hyperspectral imagery has been previously used successfully to classify coastal bottom types and map bathymetry and it is time to transition this observational tool to harbor and port security. Hyperspectral imagery is ideally suited for monitoring small-scale features and processes in these optically complex waters, because of its enhanced spectral (1 - 3 nm) and spatial (1 - 3 meters) resolutions. Under an existing NOAA project (CICORE), a field experiment was carried out (November 2004) in coordination with airborne hyperspectral ocean color overflights to develop methods and models for relating hyperspectral remote sensing reflectances to water <b>transparency</b> <b>and</b> diver <b>visibility</b> in San Pedro and San Diego Bays. These bays were focused areas because: (1) San Pedro harbor, with its ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, is the busiest port in the U. S. and ranks 3 rd in the world and (2) San Diego Harbor {{is one of the largest}} Naval ports, serving a diverse mix of commercial, recreational and military traffic, including more than 190 cruise ships annual. Maintaining harbor and port security has added complexity for these Southern California bays, because of the close proximity to the Mexican border. We will present in situ optical data and hyperspectral aircraft ocean color imagery from these two bays and compare and contrast the differences and similarities. This preliminary data will then be used to discuss how water <b>transparency</b> <b>and</b> diver <b>visibility</b> predictions improve harbor and port security...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} Council of Ministers and the Convention's/IGC's dossier on the Council's system. Acknowledging that {{supranational}} influence is contingent upon both the context and actual strategies employed by supranational actors in an IGC, I focus {{on an issue}} where the member states strategic positions are under review. I argue that the Nice IGC's outcome {{is the product of}} a trend of member states who already during the Maastricht reforms started to base their preferences on a non-agreed type measure. Budding on the findings about the Nice IGC, the paper moves on to discuss different readings of the Council system and to analyze their empirical validity.

This research study reports ªndings of a design exploration into the ways an information and communication platform could be developed to increase communication among parents, guard-ians, and educators about the left-behind children. We draw on the results of interviews and design activities with 27 migrant parents, children, educators, and guardians living in or with ties to Jamaica. We highlight how hybrid ap-proaches to designing social spaces (merging voice-based and online platforms) could improve access and meet the users ’ differing needs. Moreover, increasing access opportunities would facilitate the (re) building of trust networks and improve a parent’s awareness of their child’s needs.

40|$|With {{specific}} {{regard to}} {{corporate social responsibility}} (CSR), this thesis aims to answer how is social media changing {{the relationship between the}} consumer and the corporation? As indicated by Edelman's 2014 Trust Barometer, global trust in government is at an all time low (41 %). Dwindling trust in global politics coupled with expanding corporate influence in political decision making, as signaled by the United States Supreme Court's 2010 ruling in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, has led me to believe that corporations should be held more responsible for their societal impacts. CSR has long been considered the way in which companies should demonstrate their interest in society and the welfare of their consumers. However, Milton Friedman's widely accepted stockholder theory of business management, which suggests a firm's social role is to act in the monetary interest of its shareholders, has relegated CSR to the periphery of business strategy. With social media's meteoric rise in popularity, firms that want their brands to remain relevant and profitable are forced to maintain a presence on SNS. The <b>transparency</b> <b>and</b> <b>visibility</b> provided by social media's three aforementioned traits require highly visible brands to both market themselves and mitigate any potential scandals or shocks to their business...|$|E

ROOT's TGeo geometry {{is used as}} internal representation, shared among several geometry views. Each view is represented by a GUI list-tree widget, implemented as a flat vector to allow for fast searching, selection, and filtering by material type, node name, and shape type. Display of logical and physical volumes is supported. Color, <b>transparency,</b> <b>and</b> <b>visibility</b> flags can be modified for each node or for a selection of nodes. Further operations, like opening of a new view or changing of the root node, can be performed via a context menu. Node selection and graphical properties determined by the list-tree view can be visualized in any 3 D graphics view of Fireworks. As each 3 D view can display any number of geometry views, a user is free to combine different geometry-view selections within the same 3 D view. Node-selection by proximity to a given point is possible. A visual clipping box can be set for each geometry view to limit geometry drawing into a specified region. Visualization of geometric overlaps, as detected by TGeo, is also supported.

Universities in New Zealand are increasingly under scrutiny as sites of public investment. This presents a socio-political necessity for academic <b>transparency,</b> <b>and</b> <b>visibility</b> inevitably becomes a matter of architecture through the universities’ physical presence; the façade. Preoccupations with the aesthetics of a building’s envelope, {{and the pursuit of}} technological advancement, has led to a singular understanding of the façade as a mechanical boundary. This research challenges the hermetic nature of the contemporary façade and its legitimacy as a subject matter of architectural design within the overall architectural discourse. Drivers for this project include the need to revisit historical precedents, the ambivalence of the label ‘façade’, and a speculative siting as a campus expansion of Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand. The design response to the site’s topography via the theory-charged, re-oriented, and as a heterogeneous space, and threshold redefined, façade enables a novel way of projecting a building’s image without depleting the façade’s autonomy. This is achieved through a rigorous iterative modelling methodology. That in turn provokes an ambitious urban campus complex scaling the site between Wellington city and Kelburn Campus. The architectural outcome provides a sophisticated symbolism of the meaning of University when moving through the campus expansion: one transitions from experiencing the visual indication of how learning occurs to the personal experience of it.

We studied the diet composition and factors affecting the diet of Nile tilapia in two tropical lakes where cyanotoxins were present. Particle-bound microcystins were present in all analysed water samples, ranging in concentration from 0. 00012 to 1. 11 and from 0. 006 to 0. 254 μgL− 1 in Murchison Bay in Lake Victoria and Lake Mburo, respectively. Detritus and phytoplankton were the main dietary components of the Nile tilapia, with phytoplankton contributing to over 30 % by volume of stomach contents. The cyanobacteria Microcystis spp., which are also the most likely source of microcystins in the lakes, accounted for more than 80 % of ingested phytoplankton. Microcystis spp. were also the most abundant cyanobacteria in both lakes (> 60 %). We found no significant relationship between the contribution of phytoplankton in Nile tilapia diet and the concentration of microcystins in the water but we found a close association between water transparency and the contribution of insects to Nile tilapia diets in Murchison Bay. Our results further show that none of the other measured environmental variables was a good predictor of diet items in Nile tilapia. Adult Nile tilapia in our study lakes, rely heavily on filter feeding, particularly under conditions of low water transparency, trapping detritus and phytoplankton cells especially colonies.

Analysts believe that utilization of e-procurement can lead to enormous cost saving and efficiency in procurement process. E-procurement also enlarges customer base, broadens the search for raw materials to lower its production cost. Though, it has benefited the global business tremendously, its expected growth rate has been moving downwards. While E-procurement {{can be used for}} the purchase of indirect or direct materials, the risks associated with the e-procurement has been holding the companies from adopting it. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to understand the e-procurement process by focusing on benefits, risks, practices and strategies of e-procurement and its emerging usages in the current business to business (B 2 B) environment. A qualitative method was used for the case studies in which two companies each from India and Sweden were studied and analysed. The results showed that cost benefit was the main driver for companies to implement e-procurement. Other benefits included were <b>transparency</b> <b>and</b> <b>visibility</b> across process, better internal and external relations and streamlined buying process. The problems of implementation and integration of existing infrastructure and security and control risks were holding back companies from wide usage of e-procurement.
