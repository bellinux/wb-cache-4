40|$|The {{behaviour}} {{of tungsten}} (W) plasma-facing components (PFCs) {{has been investigated}} in the plasma edge of the TEXTOR tokamak to study melt-layer ejection, macroscopic tungsten erosion from the melt layer {{as well as the}} changes of material properties such as grain-size and abundance of voids or bubbles. The parallel heat flux at the radial position of the exposed <b>tungsten</b> <b>tile</b> in the plasma ranges around q(parallel to) similar to 45 MWm(- 2) causing samples to be exposed at an impact angle of 35 degrees to 20 - 30 MW m(- 2). Locally the temperature reached up to 6000 K, high levels of evaporation and boiling are causing significant erosion in the form of continuous fine spray or droplet ejection. The amount of fine-spray tungsten emission depends strongly on the material properties: {{in the case of the}} tungsten-tantalum alloy the effect of spraying and droplet emission is significantly higher at even low temperatures when compared with regular tungsten or even ultra-high purity tungsten which shows almost no spraying at all. Differences in the material composition, grain structure and size may be related to the different evolution of macroscopic erosion. In addition the re-solidified material is studied and strong differences in terms of re-crystallized grain size and evolution of the grain structure and grain orientation are observed.

40|$|Abstract. A modular He-cooled {{divertor}} {{concept for}} DEMO {{is being investigated}} at Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe (FZK) {{within the framework of}} the EU power plant conceptual study. The design goal is to reach a heat flux of at least 10 MW/m 2. The reference design HEMJ (helium-cooled modular divertor with jet cooling) consists of a hexagonal <b>tungsten</b> <b>tile</b> which is brazed to a thimble made of W- 1 %La 2 O 3. The cooling is realized by impingement jets of high pressure helium through an array of small jet holes located at the top of a cartridge made of ODS Eurofer. The current divertor work programme focuses on manufacture and high-heat-flux tests of prototypical tungsten mock-ups to demonstrate the manufacturability and the performance of the design. The tests were performed in a combined helium loop and Tsefey EB facility at Efremov. The first two high-heat-flux test series on 1 -finger mock-ups in 2006 - 2007 already confirmed the divertor performance. Clear progress was achieved in the continuation third high-heat-flux test series in 2008 after the quality in mock-up manufacturing has been significantly improved. Technological study on fabrication of a 9 -finger module of stain less steel was also successfully performed. First thermo-hydraulic tests showed uniform distribution of mass flow rates which agrees well with calculation results. 1.

40|$|In {{the frame}} of the ITER-like Wall (ILW) for the JET tokamak, a {{divertor}} row made of bulk tungsten material has been developed for the position where the outer strike point is located in most of the foreseen plasma configurations. In the absence of active cooling, this represents a formidable challenge when one considers the temperature reached by tungsten (T-W,T-surf > 2000 degrees C) and the vertical gradient partial derivative T/partial derivative z= 5 x 10 (4) K/m. As the development is drawing to an end and most components are in production, actual 1 : 1 prototypes are exposed to an ion beam with a power density around 7 MW/m(2) on the plasma-facing surface. Advantage is taken of the flexibility of the MARION facility to bombard the tungsten stack under shallow angles of incidence (similar to 6 degrees) with a powerful beam of ions and neutrals (> 70 MW/m(2) on axis). The shallow angles are important, with respect to the toroidal wetted surface, for properly simulating the expected performance under actual tokamak conditions. The MARION tests have been used to validate for a few typical cases the thermal calculations that were steadily developed along with the <b>tungsten</b> <b>tile</b> and, at the same time, to gather information on the actual temperatures of individual components. The latter is an important factor to a finer estimation of the power handling capabilities. (C) 2011 EURATUM. Published by Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that {{transient}} thermal shock loads induce crack networks on tungsten samples especially at low base temperatures. To achieve test conditions which are more relevant for the performance of tungsten-armoured plasma facing components in next step thermonuclear fusion devices <b>tungsten</b> <b>tiles</b> were exposed to high flux hydrogen-plasma in the linear plasma generator Pilot-PSI and the high heat flux ion beam test facility MARION. Subsequently, the cyclic transient heat load tests were done in the electron beam facility JUDITH 1. The induced damages after these combined tests were examined by microscopically means, profilometry and metallography. The comparison of the obtained results and damage characteristics with those obtained after thermal shock loading show that the preloading of tungsten targets with high flux hydrogen-plasma has significant influence on the thermal shock behaviour of tungsten in terms of crack distance, width, and depth as well as cracked area. Furthermore the plasma parameters, in particular pulse duration and sample temperature during loading, have strong impact on the damage pattern after thermal shock loading. © 2013 Elsevier B. V.

It {{is necessary to}} develop a method of gasification of boron-carbon film which deposits during B 4 C sputtering. In this paper {{the results of the}} first stage investigation of gasification methods of boron-carbon films are presented. Two gasification methods of films are investigated: interaction with the ozone-oxygen mixture and irradiation in plasma with the working gas composed of oxygen, ethanol, and, in some cases, helium. The gasification rate in the ozone-oxygen mixture at 250 °C for B/C films with different B/C ratio and carbon fiber composite (CFC), was measured. For B/C films the gasification rate decreased with increasing B/C ratio (from 45 nm/h at B/C= 0. 7 to 4 nm/h at B/C= 2. 1; for CFC – 15 μm/h). Films gasification rates were measured under ion irradiation from ethanol-oxygen-helium plasma at different temperatures, with different ion energies and different gas mixtures.

40|$|State {{of the art}} {{and motivations}} Material choice for the plasma facing {{components}} in fusion experiments is determined by competing desirables: {{on the one hand}} the material should have a high thermal conductivity, high threshold for melting and sputtering, and low erosion rate under plasma contact, {{and on the other hand}} as a plasma impurity it should not cause excessive radiative energy loss. For the ITER tokamak, currently under construction at Cadarache, France [1], Tungsten (symbol W, atomic number 74) is the favoured material for the wall regions of highest particle and heat load in a fusion reactor vessel, with beryllium for regions of lower heat and particle load. ITER is to start operation with a W-Be or W wall for the main D-D and D-T experi-mental programme. In support of ITER and looking ahead to the prospect of a fusion reactor, other experimental plasma groups are also considering tungsten, including the ASDEX-Upgrade tokamak which now operates with an all-W wall and at JET (Joint European Torus) facility in Oxford.

40|$|Within the ITER-like wall {{project at}} Joint European Torus (JET), the {{original}} plasma facing tiles in the divertor region made of carbon fibre composite (CFC) {{will be replaced}} by tungsten coated CFC and bulk <b>tungsten</b> <b>tiles.</b> The main constraint of the bulk tungsten concept is to accommodate the power and energy handling requirements, the electromagnetic (EM) forces and the mechanical requirements of the existing remote handling system. Through a number of intermediate design options the "lamella" option has been developed, consisting of plasma facing tiles, an inconel wedge holding the tiles and an inconel interface plate attaching the wedge to the JET CFC base plate. In order to minimize eddy currents the wedge must be equipped with slits and the W-lamellae are isolated from each other. Defined electrical contacts from the lamellae via the wedge to the base plate define the path of the halo currents. The pairs of lamellae are isolated from each other by insulating spacers and tie rods keep the stack of tungsten lamellae and ceramic-coated spacers together. Eight tungsten lamella stacks are attached to the wedge via eight "rails. " This paper reports on calculation of the electromagnetic (EM) loads in the block components and of the stress-strain state of the block, subjected to the worst combination of EM loads, by 3 D finite element (FE) electromagnetic and stress analyses. As a result of these studies the level of initial pre-tension of the joint elements has been checked against possible detachment. The bending of the load bearing components has proved to be moderately low compared with the structural material allowable limits. (C) 2007 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Since 2011 the JET tokamak {{has been}} {{operated}} {{with a metal}} ITER-like wall (JET-ILW) including castellated beryllium limiters and lamellae-type bulk <b>tungsten</b> <b>tiles</b> in the divertor. This has allowed for a large scale test of castellated plasma-facing components (PFC). Procedures for sectioning the limiters into single blocks of castellation have been developed. This facilitated morphology studies of morphology of surfaces inside the grooves for limiters after experimental campaigns 2011 – 2012 and 2013 – 2014. The deposition in the 0. 4 – 0. 5 [*]mm wide grooves of the castellation is 'shallow'. It reaches 1 – 2 [*]mm into the 12 [*]mm deep gap. Deuterium concentrations are small (mostly below 1 [*][*]×[*][*] 1018 cm− 2). The estimated total amount of deuterium in all the castellated limiters does not exceed the inventory of the plasma-facing surfaces (PFS) of the limiters. There are only traces of Ni, Cr and Fe deposited in the castellation gaps. The same applies to the carbon content. Also low deposition of D, Be and C has been measured {{on the sides of}} the bulk tungsten lamellae pieces. Modelling clearly reflects: (a) a sharp decrease in the measured deposition profiles and(b) an increase in deposition with the gap width. Both experimental and modelling data give a strong indication and information to ITER that narrow gaps in the castellated PFC are essential. X-ray diffraction on PFS has clearly shown two distinct composition patterns: Be with an admixture of Be–W intermetallic compounds (e. g.

40|$|Impurity {{transport}} {{within the}} inner JET divertor has been modelled with ERO {{to estimate the}} transport to and the resulting deposition at remote areas. Various parametric studies involving divertor plasma conditions and strike point position have been performed. In JET-ILW (beryllium main chamber and tungsten divertor) beryllium, flowing from the main chamber into the divertor and then effectively reflected at the <b>tungsten</b> divertor <b>tiles,</b> is transported to remote areas. The tungsten flux to remote areas in L-Mode is {{in comparison to the}} beryllium flux negligible due to small sputtering. However, tungsten is sputtered during ELMs in H-Mode conditions. Nevertheless, depending on the plasma conditions, strike point position and the location of the remote area, the maximum resulting tungsten flux to remote areas is at least ∼ 3 times lower than the corresponding beryllium flux. Modelled beryllium and tungsten deposition on a rotating collector probe located below tile 5 is in good agreement with measurements if the beryllium influx into the inner divertor is assumed to be in the range of 0. 1 % relative to the deuterium ion flux and erosion due to fast charge exchange neutrals is considered.

Currently, PFCs {{are made by}} multi-material assembly and rely on <b>tungsten</b> armour <b>tile</b> (high heat flux side) which needs to be cooled by the attachment to a heat sink (Cu-alloys). The interfaces in multi-material assembly are unfavourable for the application (high working temperature, thermal fatigue). The use of FGM can be a new promising way. The {{aim of this study}} is to analyze the effect of a composition/grain size variation on the liquid phase migration during liquid phase sintering of FGM, in order to control the final composition profile. Bi-layer materials are processed by powder metallurgy route. W-Cu compositions with 10 and 20 wt%Cu and with different W-particle sizes are processed starting with attritor-milled W-CuO powder mixtures which are reduced at 350 degrees C. Analysis of copper liquid phase migration for different composition/grain size associations indicates that the phenomenon is driven by differential sinterability in the gradient. The copper liquid migration depends on the differences in sinterability, on the available liquid and open porosity in the structure beyond the melting point of copper. From these analyses, a way to control the gradient profile of W-Cu structure can be proposed...|$|R
40|$|Since 1998 an {{increasing}} area of <b>tungsten</b> coated <b>tiles</b> has been {{installed at the}} central column of ASDEX Upgrade, reaching 7. 1 m² in 2001 / 2002. The tiles were coated commercially by plasma arc deposition to a thickness of 1 μm. Post mortem analysis of the W-coating showed a strong erosion, which is attributed to ion sputtering, due to its two-dimensional variation. During the campaigns with W-coated central column, almost no negative influence on the plasma performance was found. Only during direct plasma wall contact or for reduced clearance in divertor discharges spectroscopic evidence for tungsten influx could be found. Effective sputtering yields of about 10 ⁻³ were derived, pointing to a strong contribution by light intrinsic impurities to the total W-sputtering. The increased W-content during plasma current ramp up decreases after X-point formation and the flux consumption during current ramp is only marginally enhanced compared to the graphite wall case. The W concentrations ranged from below 10 ⁻⁶ up to a few times 10 ⁻⁵. In discharges with increased density peaking, a tendency for impurity accumulation was observed, which affected only a closely localized central region.

These numbers are lower boundaries, because the W was locally completely eroded. The tungsten erosion is inhomogeneous on a microscopic level and depends on the micro-topography of the rough surface: large erosion with complete disappearance of the W layer is observed on plasma-facing areas of microscopic ridges, while a smaller erosion and sometimes even deposition of carbon is found {{on the far side of}} ridges and in pores.

40|$|Abstract. The {{material}} for plasma facing {{components of a}} future fusion device is still not decided. At present most experiments use graphite, because of its good thermo mechanical properties and the low radiation potential of carbon. Due to the high erosion yield and,especially, due to the codeposition with tritium, its use in a fusion reactor is still questionable. Based on the good experience using tungsten as divertor material in ASDEX Upgrade [1, 2], which demonstrated that a divertor tokamak can be operated with a tungsten divertor without reduction of the performance, a step by step strategy was followed. Main sources of the carbon are predicted at the inner heat shield, which covers the central column. <b>Tungsten</b> test <b>tiles</b> confirm the erosion at this position due to charge exchange neutral, but also a non negligible ion sputtering component. A first step was done by siliconisation. In ASDEX Upgrade the maximal silicon concentration was 0. 002. Consequently {{the performance of the}} experiment was not influenced by silicon radiation. A second step was done by tungsten coating of 1 : 2 m 2 of the inner heat shield. Experiments are done without subsequent wall coating, which would cover the tungsten. Spectroscopically measured central tungsten densities are always below 5106 and mostly below the detection limit. Again no influence on the plasma performance parameters are found. Extrapolation to ITER conditions yields concentrations, which will not prohibit successful operation. The next step in ASDEX Upgrade will be a mostly tungsten covered inner heat shield at the next experimental campaign...|$|R
40|$|Carbon {{sources in}} the main chamber of ASDEX Upgrade, {{especially}} the 12 guard limiters at the low field side (LFS), were determined spectroscopically using recently installed lines of sight. Absolute photon fluxes were measured for spectral lines in the visible wavelength range referring to all spin systems of C + 1 and C + 2. A simple transport model for carbon enabled the simulation of the radial distribution of carbon radiation and {{the determination of the}} effective inverse photon efficiency, which was used for the evaluation of ion fluxes. The model also predicts the fraction of eroded particles that are transported out of the plasma before further ionization occurs. Comparison of the calculated losses with measurements showed good agreement in L-mode cases, whereas in H-mode cases the CIII/CII radiation ratio was too high by a factor 1. 5. The contribution of each spin system to the ion flux was independently measured. For C + 1 and C + 2 the spin system distribution was found to be close to equilibrium. The line-of-sight-integrated photon fluxes were spatially separated for many lines of sight by Zeeman-analysis and differential measurements. This allowed us to determine the total influx from the high field side and LFS. Surprisingly, the carbon source at the inner heatshield was larger than the carbon influx from the limiter source at the LFS. This is very pronounced for the H-mode case investigated, where 60 – 80 % of the carbon atoms emerge from the heatshield. This source is due to recycling or re-erosion of carbon, which probably originates from the limiters, because 85 % of the heatshield area consisted of <b>tungsten</b> coated <b>tiles...</b>|$|R
