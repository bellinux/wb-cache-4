25|$|Article 14 {{does not}} define the offence of {{contempt}} and hence by necessary implication it {{is left to}} the courts <b>to</b> <b>define</b> <b>it.</b> Justice Loh stated that, in defining the offence, judges must be cognizant that the definition must be circumscribed by Article 14, to ensure {{a balance between the}} freedom of speech and the offence. Neither can be defined in a way that renders the other otiose.|$|E

Though {{the importance of this}} model and its influence on media studies is not to be denied, later thinkers have criticized this emphasis on structure over agency, because it neglects the ability of audiences of this media to question the prevailing notions represented.|$|E

25|$|The Deccan {{region has}} {{historically}} lacked an enduring geo-political centre, {{and has been}} defined in various ways. Geographers have attempted <b>to</b> <b>define</b> <b>it</b> using indices such as rainfall, vegetation, soil type or physical features. When considering physical features, it is taken to be the area bounded by the Narmada River, the Eastern Ghats and the Western Ghats. The 16th century historian Firishta defined Deccan as the territory inhabited by the native speakers of Kannada, Marathi, and Telugu languages. Richard M. Eaton (2005) also settled on this linguistic definition.|$|E
25|$|Greg Madden {{is found}} dead weeks later. In {{the months that}} follow, Zach and Kendall enjoy their time with the newborn child. Problems arise here and there, but none {{like that of the}} Satin Slayer, a serial killer murdering the women of Fusion, a {{cosmetics}} company run by Kendall and her friends who helped <b>to</b> <b>define</b> <b>it.</b> The Satin Slayer takes Kendall hostage, and when it is revealed that the Satin Slayer is actually Zach's estranged father, Alexander Cambias, Sr., thought to be dead, but obviously still very much alive and that all he wanted is for Zach to have followed in his footsteps, Zach does everything in his power to save Kendall, as it all culminates on a balcony outside of a hotel room. Zach's father sets a contraption around Kendall's neck, which will kill her if its detonator goes off. Zach and Alexander struggle as Zach gets a hold of the detonator and will not let it go, even as he is shot in the arm by Alexander. Zach is able to sneak a spare knife from the sheath at his ankle and throw it hard enough at Alexander so that Alexander drops his gun. Zach rescues Kendall. He is determined to kill his father, but help soon arrives, and Alexander is sent to jail.|$|E
25|$|From {{the late}} 1990s onwards, the {{majority}} of the population has been part of the growing middle class. But according to Mexico's National Council for the Evaluation of Social Development Policy (CONEVAL) from 2006 to 2010 the portion of the population who were in poverty rose from 19% to 46% (52 million persons). However, rather than Mexico’s economy crashing, international economists attribute the huge increase in the percentage of population living below the country's poverty line to the CONEVAL changing the standards used <b>to</b> <b>define</b> <b>it,</b> pointing out that the percentage of people living in poverty according Mexico’s national poverty line is around 40 times higher than the one reported by the World Bank’s international poverty line, with the difference between the two being the biggest in the world. It is pondered then if it wouldn't be better for countries in the situation of Mexico to adopt more internationalized standards to measure poverty so the numbers obtained could be used to make accurate international comparisons. According to the OECD's own poverty line (defined as the percentage of a country's population who earns half or less of the national median income) 21.5% of the Mexico's population lives in situation of poverty. This is also reflected by the fact that infant mortality in Mexico is three times higher than the average among OECD nations, and the literacy levels are in the median range of OECD nations. Nevertheless, according to Goldman Sachs, by 2050 Mexico will have the 5th largest economy in the world.|$|E

500|$|In a {{study of}} media and popular culture in South Asia, author Mahasveta Barua draws a {{parallel}} between the film's metaphorical representation of the mother as nation, and the metonymic identification with India that Indira Gandhi, India's only woman prime minister, sought and tried for during her tenure (1966–77, and 1980–84). In his book Terrorism, Media, Liberation, John David Slocum argues that like Satyajit Ray's classic masterpiece Pather Panchali (1955), Khan's Mother India has [...] "vied for alternative definitions of Indianness". However, he emphasises that the film is an overt mythologising and feminising of the nation in which Indian audiences have used their imagination <b>to</b> <b>define</b> <b>it</b> in the nationalistic context, given that in reality the storyline is about a poverty-stricken peasant from northern India, rather than a true ideal of a modernising, powerful nation.|$|E

500|$|The {{coupling}} factor represents the primary property of a directional coupler. [...] Coupling factor {{is a negative}} quantity, it cannot exceed [...] for a passive device, and in practice does not exceed [...] since more than this would result in more power output from the coupled port than power from the transmitted port – in effect their roles would be reversed. [...] Although a negative quantity, the minus sign is frequently dropped (but still implied) in running text and diagrams and a few authors {{go so far as}} <b>to</b> <b>define</b> <b>it</b> as a positive quantity. [...] Coupling is not constant, but varies with frequency. [...] While different designs may reduce the variance, a perfectly flat coupler theoretically cannot be built. [...] Directional couplers are specified in terms of the coupling accuracy at the frequency band center.Vizmuller, p.101 ...|$|E

500|$|New {{species have}} been {{identified}} {{due to differences in}} morphology, karyotypes, cytochrome b sequences, and other genetic tests, as well as several combinations of these. [...] When nuclear DNA (nDNA) was tested in conjunction with mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in mouse lemurs, a few species, such as Claire's mouse lemur (Microcebus mamiratra) were demonstrated to be indistinguishable from other closely related species. [...] In such cases, nDNA did not vary, but the mtDNA that had been used <b>to</b> <b>define</b> <b>it</b> as a species was still distinct. [...] Differences in results between nDNA, which is inherited from both parents, and mtDNA, which is inherited from the mother, was attributed to female philopatry, where females remain within or close to the home range into which they were born while males disperse. [...] Since the isolated population known as Claire's mouse lemur has distinct mtDNA, but not nDNA, it is likely to contain a population descended from a related group of females, but which still disperses and interbreeds with nearby populations.|$|E

500|$|Core intent {{would be}} where the {{defendant}} acted either to cause at least grievous bodily harm to the victim, or where the defendant acted to achieve some other aim, where the death caused was a necessary means to that other end. In general, the jury is directed that [...] "intent" [...] is to be taken as meaning what it does in ordinary life, and that the judge should not attempt <b>to</b> <b>define</b> <b>it</b> in other terms. However, following R v Woollin, {{it is also possible}} for a jury to convict if they [...] "feel sure that death or serious injury was a virtual certainty (barring some unforeseen intervention) {{as a result of the}} defendant's actions and that the defendant appreciated that such was the case" [...] known as [...] "oblique intent". Despite appearing to present an alternative to the primary, core sense of intent, courts have generally seen Woollin as allowing the jury to infer core intent from the evidence of virtual certainty. The jury are entitled to convict in these circumstances, and they should not be directed that they, finding virtual certainty, must convict. However, if it is difficult to imagine circumstances where a jury would find virtual certainty but not convict, which would support this complicating factor. The exception for medical care is mentioned as a general principle for homicide.|$|E

500|$|The term [...] "New Wave" [...] did {{not meet}} with {{universal}} approval among those who were regarded as part of it.

[...] Merril was a key advocate for the New Wave, and popularized it in her anthology England Swings SF, which appeared in 1968; she spent almost a year in London, living near Moorcock, when researching the anthology in 1966–1967. [...] Merril and writer Christopher Priest were among those who used the term [...] "New Wave" [...] to describe the work being done in New Worlds, but Aldiss was not the only writer to object to the term, and it never received a generally accepted definition. [...] Critic Brian Attebery characterizes it as a [...] "disruptive, existentially fraught and formally daring" [...] style; Peter Nicholls hesitates <b>to</b> <b>define</b> <b>it</b> but comments that [...] "perhaps the fundamental element was the belief that sf could and should be taken seriously as literature". [...] In a 1967 interview, Ballard, one of the writers most closely associated with the New Wave, described modern U.S. sf as extrovert and optimistic, and contrasted it with [...] "the new science fiction, that other people apart from myself are now beginning to write", which he saw as [...] "introverted, possibly pessimistic rather than optimistic, much less certain of its own territory." ...|$|E
