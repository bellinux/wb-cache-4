40|$|Two-way time-of-arrival (TW-ToA) is {{a widely}} used ranging {{protocol}} that can provide the distance between <b>tow</b> <b>devices</b> without time synchronization.

In this paper, a cooperative positioning protocol [1] is studied, which can improve positioning accuracy compared to the conventional TW-ToA based positioning systems and also facilitate positioning with fewer packet transmissions; hence, it can prolong battery life on average. The maximum likelihood estimator is obtained for the cooperative technique and the limits on the positioning accuracy are quantified in terms of the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB).

Nine female and ten male backstroke swimmers completed eight maximum speed trials.

Eight elite male swimmers with a FINA (Federation Internationale de Natation) rank of 900 þ completed five passive (streamline tow) and five net force (arms and leg swimming) trials. Three 50 -Hz cameras were used to video each trial and were synchronized to the kinetic data output from a force-platform, upon which a motorized <b>towing</b> <b>device</b> was mounted.

At a mean velocity of 1. 92 +/- 0. 06 m. s - 1, the mean passive drag for the swimmers was 80. 3 +/- 4. 0 N, and the mean net force was 262. 4 +/- 33. 4 N.

Twenty elite front-crawl swimmers Federation Internationale de Natation (FINA ranking 908 ± 59) were tested {{to identify the}} influence of both gender and breathing. A total of six randomised free-swimming trials were conducted: (i) three breathing, (ii) three non-breathing.

For the net drag force profile, only three females and zero males exhibited a symmetrical minimum net drag force; and only four females and two males demonstrated a symmetrical maximum net drag force index. No differences existed within the non-breathing condition. There was a small (5. 2 %) difference in the location of maximum net drag force, when stratifying by gender. During the breathing condition, gender also influenced the percentage of overlap for the breathing stroke by 25. 2 %, and 14. 6 % for the non-breathing stroke.

Twenty elite swimmers completed a total of six randomised front-crawl towing trials: (i) three breathing trials and (ii) three non-breathing trials. The net drag force was measured using an assisted <b>towing</b> <b>device</b> mounted upon a Kistler force platform, and this equipment towed the swimmer at a constant speed. The net drag force profile was used to create a stroke symmetry index for each swimming trial. Analysis using the symmetry indices identified that the majority of participants demonstrated an asymmetrical instantaneous net drag force stroke profile in both the breathing and non-breathing conditions, despite no significant differences in the time from finger-tip entry to finger-tip exit. Within the breathing condition, the faster swimmers compared to the slower swimmers demonstrated a lesser percentage of overlap between stroke phases on their breathing stroke side. During the non-breathing condition, the faster participants compared to the slower swimmers recorded a reduction in the percentage of overlap between stroke phases and less duration in the underwater stroke on their breathing stroke side.

40|$|Background The key {{difference}} between the Olympic and Paralympic Games {{is the use of}} classification systems within Paralympic sports to provide a fair competition for athletes with a range of physical disabilities. In 2009, the International Paralympic Committee mandated the development of new, evidence-based classification systems. This study aims to assess objectively the swimming classification system by determining the relationship between passive drag and level of swimming-specific impairment, as defined by the current swimming class. Methods Data were collected on participants at the London 2012 Paralympic Games. The passive drag force of 113 swimmers (classes 3 – 14) was measured using an electro-mechanical <b>towing</b> <b>device</b> and load cell. Swimmers were towed on the surface of a swimming pool at 1. 5  m/s while holding their most streamlined position. Results Passive drag ranged from 24. 9 to 82. 8  N; the normalised drag (drag/mass) ranged from 0. 45 to 1. 86  N/kg. Significant negative associations were found between drag and the swimming class (τ=− 0. 41, p< 0. 01) and normalised drag and the swimming class (τ=− 0. 60, p< 0. 01). The mean difference in drag between adjacent classes was inconsistent, ranging from 0  N (6 vs 7) to 11. 9  N (5 vs 6). Reciprocal Ponderal Index (a measure of slenderness) correlated moderately with normalised drag (rP=− 0. 40, p< 0. 01). Conclusions Although swimmers with the lowest swimming class experienced the highest passive drag and vice versa, the inconsistent difference in mean passive drag between adjacent classes indicates that the current classification system does not always differentiate clearly between swimming groups...|$|R

To compare the effects of pre- and post- four week speed training protocol on 40 -yard sprint times in female collegiate soccer players. Twelve (19. 5 + 1. 5 y) normal weight (BMI: 22. 7 + 3. 4 kg·m- 2) and body composition (BF: 27. 75 + 3. 8 %) active white female collegiate soccer players participated in a four week training protocol which implemented primary and secondary speed training methods.
