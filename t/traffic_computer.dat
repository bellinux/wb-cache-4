5000|$|Before {{the end of}} 1968, {{all but one of}} the ML 4000s were {{scrapped}} at Sacramento. The survivor, number 9113 (originally numbered 9010) {{was converted}} into a [...] "camera car" [...] between 1968 and 1969 at the Sacramento Locomotive Works. It emerged as SPMW #1, but was later renumbered SPMW 1166 due to SP's <b>traffic</b> <b>computer</b> requiring 4 digits. In June 1969, it was finally renumbered to SP 8799. Its purpose was to record films for a computerized locomotive simulator for engineer training. The most drastic change in appearance was the locomotive's short hood (or [...] "nose"). It was completely rebuilt to house camera equipment and heavy, thick steel was used for collision protection. The front transmission was removed to house a generator to power the camera equipment. The generator drew fuel from the locomotive's original fuel tank. The two engines and rear transmission, though disabled, remained in the engine for weight. All of the controls remained in the cab so that it could control a locomotive pushing behind it, much like a cab car is used on a commuter train. The camera car could be put on the lead of any train, but it mostly made special trips with just one locomotive behind it for power. SP 8799 was based out of SP's West Colton Yard in Southern California until it was retired in 1984.|$|E

In June 1969 it was renumbered to SP 8799, in standard Southern Pacific locomotive lettering configuration. The most drastic change in appearance was the locomotive's short hood (or [...] "nose"), which had been removed. In its place, a custom structure was fabricated to house twin Mitchell 35-millimeter film cameras and Nagra III timecode magnetic recording equipment, with stand-up headroom and two seats salvaged from another KM for operators. Heavy, thick steel was used for collision protection and to replace lost weight. The front Voith L830rU transmission was removed to create space for the camera enclosure, while the Number 1 radiator compartment was emptied of radiators and ancillary equipment to house an Onan skid-mount generator to power the camera equipment. The two engines and rear transmission were simply disabled, principally being retained for weight. All gearboxes and Cardan (universal) shafts were removed; gears were left in place on the six axles. All of the controls remained in the cab {{so that it could}} control a locomotive pushing behind it, much like a cab car is used on a commuter train. The camera car could be put on the lead of any train, but it primarily operated as special trips with just one locomotive behind it for power.

We first present a resource negotiation and pricing (RNAP) protocol and architecture to enable users to select and dynamically renegotiate network services. We develop mechanisms within the RNAP architecture for the network to dynamically formulate prices and communicate pricing and charging information to the users. We then outline a general pricing strategy in this context. We discuss candidate algorithms by which applications (singly, {{or as part of}} a multiapplication system) can adapt their rate and QoS requests, based on the user-perceived value of a given combination of transmission parameters. Finally, we present experimental results to show that usage- and congestion-dependent pricing can effectively reduce the blocking probability, and allow bandwidth to be shared fairly among applications, depending on the elasticity of their respective bandwidth requirements.

40|$|Part 2 : WorkshopInternational audienceBotnets are {{collections}} of compromised computers which {{have come under}} the control of a malicious person or organisation via malicious software stored on the computers, and which can then be used to interfere with, misuse, or deny access {{to a wide range of}} Internet-based services. With the current trend towards increasing use of the Internet to support activities related to banking, commerce, healthcare and public administration, it is vital to be able to detect and neutralise botnets, so that these activities can continue unhindered. In this paper we present an overview of existing botnet detection techniques and argue why a new, composite detection approach is needed to provide efficient and effective neutralisation of botnets. This approach should combine existing detection efforts into a collaborative botnet protection framework that receives input from a range of different sources, such as packet sniffers, on-access anti-virus software and behavioural analysis of network <b>traffic,</b> <b>computer</b> sub-systems and application programs. Finally, we introduce ContraBot, a collaborative botnet detection framework which combines approaches that analyse network traffic to identify patterns of botnet activity with approaches that analyse software to detect items which are capable of behaving maliciously...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Orthogonal {{frequency}} division multiplexing (OFDM) {{is an important}} technique to support high speed transmission of broadband traffic in wireless networks, especially broadband wireless local area networks (LANs). Based on OFDM, a new multiple access scheme, called OFDM-TDMA with subcarrier allocation (OFDM-TDMA/SA), is introduced in this paper. It provides more flexibility in resource allocation than other multiple access schemes such as OFDM-TDMA, OFDM-{{frequency division}} multiple access (OFDM-FDMA), and (orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA). With OFDM-TDMA/SA, a medium access control (MAC) is designed for broadband wireless LANs. It optimizes bit allocation in subcarriers so that maximum bits are transmitted in each OFDM symbol under a frequency selective fading environment. The OFDM-TDMA/SA MAC protocol also supports three classes of traffic such as guaranteed, controlled-load, and best effort services. Based on the optimum subcarrier bit-allocation algorithm and considering heterogeneous QoS constraints of multimedia traffic, a hierarchical scheduling scheme is proposed to determine the subcarriers and time slots in which a mobile terminal can transmit packets. In such a way, the OFDM-TDMA/SA MAC protocol maximizes system throughput in a frequency selective fading environment and guarantees QoS of multimedia <b>traffic.</b> <b>Computer</b> simulation is carried out to evaluate {{the performance of the}} OFDM-TDMA/SA MAC protocol. Results show that the new MAC protocol outperforms other MAC protocols for OFDM-based wireless LANs...|$|E

40|$|With {{the rapid}} {{development}} of INTERNET and high speed ATM networks, people {{pay much attention}} on packet switched access when setting up a wireless local area network. Information sources of diverse rate such as video, text, voice, fax, E-mail are packetized in order to flow through the packet switched networks. Traditional circuit switched access does not performance efficiently for bursty packet traffic nature. As a result, a packet-based wireless Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol that can support information of diverse rate is essential for a wireless LAN. Packet Reservation Multiple Access (PRMA) is a potential candidate for the a 3 rd generation wireless LAN that support multimedia information. The user capacity of a PRMA LAN is high because it can take the advantage of statistical multiplexing gain from bursty packet traffic. However, the potential of conventional PRMA is not fully released. We propose methods of improving the performance (e. g. packet delay, packet drops, user capacity) of PRMA under various traffic conditions. Since data traffic is becoming as important as voice traffic, we analyze a PRMA data LAN with our proposed mathematical model. We also use computer simulations to study {{the performance of a}} PRMA data LAN. As it is getting common that voice and data traffic co-exist in the same wireless LAN, we propose a new voice/data PRMA protocol, which use dynamic transmission probability and gives speech users a higher priority and data users reservation, can improve both the performance of data and voice <b>traffic.</b> <b>Computer</b> simulations have proven that our proposed protocol can introduce data users into the LAN without disturbing the performance of speech users very much. Our PRMA implementation proposals perform better than conventional PRMA in many ways...|$|E
40|$|During {{a one-year}} {{supervision}} phase the function {{and operation of}} dynamic axle load weighing equipment was to be investigated at five measuring points on motorways in Hesse according to the bending plate principle {{in conjunction with a}} <b>traffic</b> <b>computer</b> centre, and during this period any longterm data and sporadic data collected on individual vehicles was to be analysed. An evaluation system was to be developed for the long-term data, and this was to be programmed {{in the form of a}} database. Furthermore, correlations between axle load distributions and the vehicle mix, depending on the traffic characteristics of a section, were to be investigated. During the test operation the accuracy of the dynamic axle load equipment was to be checked with the aid of static weighing equipment (wheel load measuring equipment), and the experience gained during the practical operation of the equipment systems was to be documented. The documentation of all breakdowns and malfunctions showed limited breakdown times of a total of one to three weeks for each of the five measuring points during a stipulated eight-month analysis period. In the initial phase there were a few breakdowns and malfunctions in the equipment due to hardware and software errors, which were immediately remedied through exchanging the respective defect electronic components and improving the software - in particular to adapt it to the TLS requirements. With regard to the accuracy of the axle load measurements compared to the static measuring results, relatively limited deviations were determined, and the long-term stability of the calibration setting was proved over a period of six months. After initial difficulties, the equipment system with bending plates which was used for these measurements was hence able to prove its suitability, above all with regard to the further expansion of the network.

40|$|Abstract: Xunet 2 is a {{collaborative}} research {{program with a}} goal of understanding the fundamental issues {{in the performance of}} ATM networks.

This paper describes these service requirements and matches them with performance guarantees that can be provided by the scheduling discipline supported by an experimental ATM switch. The scheduler supports per-virtual-circuit queueing and several priorities of round robin service in order to segregate real-time and non-real-time traffic and provide fair sharing for bursty <b>computer</b> <b>traffic.</b> Detailed simulations show that real-time traffic can be efficiently integrated with non-real-time traffic using appropriate call admission policies and enhancements to traditional round robin scheduling.
