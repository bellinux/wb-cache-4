25|$|These curves {{indicate}} that a spin transition has occurred in a metal complex as temperature changed. The gradual <b>transition</b> <b>curve</b> {{is an indication that}} not all metal centers within the complex are undergoing the transition at the same temperature. The abrupt spin change with hysteresis indicates a strong cooperativity, or “communication”, between neighboring metal complexes. In the latter case, the material is bistable and can exist in the two different spin states with a different range of external stimuli (temperature in this case) for the two phenomena, namely LS → HS and HS → LS. The two-step transition is relatively rare but is observed, for example, with dinuclear SCO complexes for which the spin transition in one metal center renders the transition in the second metal center less favorable.|$|E

50|$|The phase {{separation}} temperature (and hence, the cloud point) {{is dependent on}} polymer concentration. Therefore, temperature-composition diagrams are used to display thermoresponsive behavior {{over a wide range}} of concentrations. Phases separate into a polymer-poor and a polymer-rich phase. In strictly binary mixtures the composition of the coexisting phases can be determined by drawing tie-lines. However, since polymers display a molar mass distribution this straightforward approach may be insufficient.During the process of {{phase separation}} the polymer-rich phase can vitrify before equilibrium is reached. This depends on the glass transition temperature for each individual composition. It is convenient to add the glass <b>transition</b> <b>curve</b> to the phase diagram, although it is no real equilibrium. The intersection of the glass <b>transition</b> <b>curve</b> with the cloud point curve is called Berghmans point. In the case of UCST polymers, above the Berghmans point the phases separate into two liquid phases, below this point into a liquid polymer-poor phase and a vitrified polymer-rich phase. For LCST polymers the inverse behavior is observed.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} a locally optimal transition approach for computing a curve to smooth a corner defined by linear tool path, which generates curvature-continuous tool path in real time. Taking the locality of the optimization problem into account, transition unit including four data points of linear tool path is defined. With {{the aid of}} transition unit, the locally optimal model based on the sum of curvature extremes of two <b>transition</b> <b>curves</b> is constructed. On this basis, the objective of optimization is reformulated as a quadratic equation with respect to transition length under constraints of the lengths of linear segments and the threshold of approximation error. Unlike conventional numerical optimization problems, the locally optimal joint-point of two <b>transition</b> <b>curves</b> can be analytically determined {{with the help of}} the quadratic equation. And then the <b>transition</b> <b>curves</b> are easily obtained. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, simulations on two linear tool paths are carried out respectively. The simulation results show that the feedrate obtained by the proposed approach is higher than that obtained by conventional methods. Hence, the machining efficiency is improved...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In {{this paper}} {{a new model}} of {{hysteresis}} is described. This new model allows to describe a wider class of rate independent hystereses than the previous Classic and nonlinear Preisach models. The broader area of applicability arises from the relaxation of the minor loops equal chord requirement by introducing a less stringent property SVEC(same-vertexes-equal-chords). The new model allows one to t n-order <b>transition</b> <b>curves,</b> whereas the former models allow only for tting of rst and second-order <b>transition</b> <b>curves.</b> Due to this fact this new model improves upon existing results. The model structure has been developed to be easily implemented in inverse hysteresis control schemes, widely used for hysteretic systems regulation. Copyright c 2005 IFA...|$|R
40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{active control}} of parametrically excited systems. Parametric resonance is {{observed in a}} wide range of applications and can lead to high levels of unwanted motion. For example, in cable-stayed bridges, the vibration of the deck excites the cables axially, inducing a periodically time-varying tension. If the frequency of deck vibration is about twice the natural frequency of the cable, a parametric resonance occurs and leads to a large-amplitude swinging motion of the cable. To tackle the consequences of parametric instability, active vibration control employing a piezoelectric actuator is proposed in this article. We consider a beam subjected to an axial harmonic load that represents a parametrically excited system with a periodically varying stiffness. Using both analytical and experimental methods, we assess the stability of the beam and propose active control aimed at relocating the <b>transition</b> <b>curves</b> and hence stabilising the system via velocity feedback and pole placement. Analytical relationship between the <b>transition</b> <b>curves</b> and the poles of the system is derived. <b>Transition</b> <b>curves</b> can be assigned to a prescribed location using appropriate velocity and displacement control gains. Finally, we demonstrate the proposed approach with experiments on a beam equipped with a macro fibre composite patch...|$|R
