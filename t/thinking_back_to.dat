Mike then hears Jake calling for help, seriously injured, but alive and conscious, floating in the water. The four survive the harsh encounter and make it back to land. Hoagie then flies Ellen back to Amity Island.|$|E

Kant's concept of Perpetual Peace is arguably seen as the starting point of contemporary liberal thought.|$|R

60|$|But in {{the days}} I write of I had no {{conception}} of this, and I am sure that my blindness to so plain a fact kept me even from seeking and knowing the highest beauty in the things I worshipped. I believe that if I had been sensible of it I should hays read much more of such humane Italian poets and novelists as Manzoni and D'Azeglio, whom I perceived to be delightful, without dreaming {{of them in the}} length and breadth of their goodness. Now and then its extent flashed upon me, but the glimpse was lost to my retroverted vision almost as soon as won. It is only in <b>thinking</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> there that I can realize how much they might always have meant to me. They were both living in my time in Italy, and they were two men whom I should now like very much to have seen, if I could have done so without that futility which seems to attend every effort to pay one's duty to such men.|$|E

40|$|This elegant, witty, and cagy book {{falls into}} no {{established}} category. Part intellectual autobiography, part historiographical debate, part reflections {{on a career}} of engaged accomplishment, <b>Thinking</b> <b>Back</b> seems <b>to</b> me, as a student and friend of Woodward's and therefore not entirely nonpartisan, an essay of irresistable charm. Woodward's job during World War II was making sense of naval battle reports. Here, he summarizes intellectual conflicts, {{with an eye to}} shaping the terms in which his life's work will ultimately be seen. Too subtle to engage in straightforward apologetics, he is more concerned with explaining the circumstances in which his major books were produced and with making clear what he intended, generally and in detail, in each. Disarmingly generous to some critics, especially younger ones, he is cooly withering toward others...|$|R
40|$|The {{roots of}} {{semiotic}} <b>thinking</b> go <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the first civilizations of the Fertile Crescent and Ancient Greece.

In this article {{we are going to}} examine Saussure's dyadic model of the linguistic sign, Yuri Lotman's ideas on primary and secondary modeling systems and his concept of semiosphere, as well as Peirce's triadic sing doctrine. Finally, we are going to examine Peirce's understanding of the process of sign-action or semiosis. I argue that through that concept we are able to transcend the boundaries of physics, linguistics and culture...|$|R

The book brought together three earlier interests that guided Schwarz’s work: democratic representation, {{the content of}} public policies, {{and their impact on}} the economy and opportunity for Americans. Schwarz develops a philosophical narrative that reveals the vital moral interconnection of the three areas of interest within a tradition of American <b>thinking</b> that reaches <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the nation’s founding philosophy. Schwarz discovered that this philosophy corresponded closely with the policies that the government had been adopting and implementing.|$|R

50|$|In {{addition}} to his journalism and participation in various international forums, Wolf had also attempted to influence opinion with his books; he has stated that his 2004 book, Why Globalization Works, {{was intended to be}} a persuasive work rather than an academic study. By 2008, Wolf had become disillusioned with theories promoting what he came to see excessive reliance on the private sector. While remaining a pragmatist free of binding commitments to any one ideology, Wolf's views partially shifted away from free market <b>thinking</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the Keynesian ideas he had been taught as a youth.|$|E
50|$|Whether {{considering}} the first systems of written communication with Sumerian cuneiform to Mayan numerals, or the feats of engineering with the Egyptian pyramids, systems <b>thinking</b> can date <b>back</b> <b>to</b> antiquity.

50|$|Because {{his death}} was a suicide, the {{department}} refuses an honor guard at the funeral. Frank Pembleton, unwilling to attend the church funeral after his faith was shaken on a recent case, stands alone in his dress blues on the station house steps, saluting the fallen detective as the procession goes by. Lewis carries a lot of guilt over Crosetti's death, <b>thinking</b> <b>back</b> constantly <b>to</b> see {{if there had been}} any hint of Crosetti's suicidal tendencies beforehand. His death also deeply affects the other detectives in the squad (especially during the third season), as the reasons for Crosetti's suicide are never explained. The episode itself mentioned job stress, the divorce, and a possible gambling addiction as possible motives; but never confirmed any specific reason. The actor who played Crosetti, Jon Polito, also expressed a certain discomfort with the character's committing suicide. Because NBC aired some of the Season 3 episodes out of order, a mention of a still living Crosetti appeared after the episode that revealed the suicide.|$|R
