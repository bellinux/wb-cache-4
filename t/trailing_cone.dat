50|$|Trailing cones (or {{trailing}} wires as {{they are}} often incorrectly called or trailing static cones), were first developed and tested in the 1950s and 1960s as a simple means of calibrating the static pressure (altitude reporting) error of an aircraft's pitot-static system. It does this by giving an accurate measurement of the ambient atmospheric pressure (static pressure) well clear of the aircraft's fuselage. The <b>trailing</b> <b>cone</b> system trails generally 1 to 1.5 times the wing span length behind the aircraft via a high-strength pressure tube. Static pressure is measured forward of the cone by several static ports. The cone stabilizes and aligns the ports relative to the freestream airflow.|$|E

This paper presents the results of a pitot-static calibration for a meteorological research sensor package mounted on the wing of a Cessna 208 B Grand Caravan.

40|$|Abstract. <b>Trailing</b> <b>cone</b> {{method is}} {{generally}} used for atmospheric pressure measurement among airspeed calibration, {{of which the}} accuracy is not high enough and the hysteresis error is conspicuous. So a long-distance outboard precision airspeed calibration method is put forward. This paper focuses on the study on parametric design of static tube which is the sensing element of the newmethod. The flow field of the static tube is simulated and analyzed to get pressure coefficient Cp curve in flight test environment by using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) technology. Based on the simulation result and considering the impact of front and rear connectors, the main geometric paramters of static tube is determined and optimized.

40|$|Accurate static {{pressure}} measurements are {{a prerequisite for}} safe navigation and precise air data measurements on aircraft. Pressure is also fundamental for wind and air temperature analysis in meteorology. Static pressure measurement by aircraft is disturbed by aerodynamics {{and needs to be}} corrected using calibration. In this paper we compare {{static pressure}} measured by means of a <b>trailing</b> <b>cone</b> (TC) in the atmosphere behind two different jet aircraft at flight levels up to 450 with data from numerical weather predictions (NWP). The height is derived from differential Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) measurements. The GNSS height is compared to NWP geopotential height. The NWP data were provided by the Integrated Forecast System (IFS) of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). When computing the geopotential with latitude/height dependent gravity the pressure/height differences are - 0. 01 +- 0. 15 hPa and 0. 6 +- 2. 8 m. This pressure accuracy implies NWP temperature errors < 0. 1 K on average below 10 km altitude. The TC measurements provide a first quantification of the case-specific accuracy of NWP pressure-geopotential relationships. The method of comparing operational pressure/GNSS measurements on aircraft with NWP analysis or predictions can be used to test the height keeping performance of aircraft after or during operation...|$|E
40|$|A {{method is}} {{described}} that estimates the {{error in the}} static pressure measurement on an aircraft from differential pressure measurements on the hemispherical surface of a Rosemount model 858 AJ air velocity probe mounted on a boom ahead of the aircraft. The theoretical predictions for how the pressure should vary {{over the surface of}} the hemisphere, involving an unknown sensitivity parameter, leads to a set of equations that can be solved for the unknowns – angle of attack, angle of sideslip, dynamic pressure and the error in static pressure – if the sensitivity factor can be determined. The sensitivity factor was determined on the University of Wyoming King Air research aircraft by comparisons with the error measured with a carefully designed sonde towed on connecting tubing behind the aircraft – a <b>trailing</b> <b>cone</b> – and the result was shown to have a precision of about ± 10 Pa over a wide range of conditions, including various altitudes, power settings, and gear and flap extensions. Under accelerated flight conditions, geometric altitude data from a combined Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) and inertial measurement unit (IMU) system are used to estimate acceleration effects on the error, and the algorithm is shown to predict corrections to a precision of better than ± 20 Pa under those conditions. Some limiting factors affecting the precision of static pressure measurement on a research aircraft are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Accurate static {{pressure}} measurements are {{a prerequisite for}} safe navigation and precise air data measurements on aircraft. Pressure is also fundamental to assess winds and air temperature and, hence, important for meteorology. The direct {{static pressure}} measurement by aircraft is disturbed by the aircraft aerodynamics {{and needs to be}} corrected using proper calibration. In this paper we compare static pressure measured by means of a <b>trailing</b> <b>cone</b> (TC) in the undisturbed atmosphere behind two different jet aircraft (Dassault FALCON 20 E and Gulfstream 550 “HALO”) at flight levels (FL) from 40 to 450 during 6 flights on different days with data from numerical weather predictions (NWP). The height is derived from differential Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) measurements. The GNSS height is compared to NWP geopotential height. The NWP data were provided by the Integrated Forecast System (IFS) of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). The IFS model assumes constant gravity g. For constant g, the pressure differences (at same height) have mean values and standard deviations of 0. 40 ± 0. 17 hPa for 159 individual measurements of 43 ± 31 s duration each.

40|$|We present {{polarization}} {{data for}} 32 mainly southern pulsars at 8. 4 GHz. The observations {{show that the}} polarization fraction is low in most pulsars at this frequency except for the young, energetic pulsars which continue to show polarization fractions in excess of 60 per cent. All the pulsars in the sample show evidence for conal emission with only one third also showing core emission. Many profiles are asymmetric, with either the leading or the <b>trailing</b> part of <b>cone</b> not detectable. Somewhat surprisingly, the asymmetric profiles {{tend to be more}} polarized than the symmetrical profiles. Little or no pulse narrowing is seen between 1 and 8. 4 GHz. The spectral behaviour of the orthogonal polarization modes and radius to frequency mapping can likely account for much of the observational phenomenology.

40|$|Accurate static {{pressure}} measurements {{are essential for}} safe navigation. Aircraft {{static pressure}} measurements need to be calibrated and verified. We recently compared <b>trailing</b> <b>cone</b> static pressure measurements behind two different jet aircraft up to flight level 450 during 6 flights on different days with numerical weather prediction (NWP) data. The GNSS height {{above mean sea level}} measured during these flights is compared to NWP geopotential height. The NWP data were provided by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). The height differences at same pressure are 0. 6 ± 2. 8 m on average. The corresponding pressure difference was determined to be - 0. 01 ± 0. 15 hPa. The method of comparing operational pressure/GNSS measurements on aircraft with NWP analysis or predictions can be used for testing the height keeping performance of aircraft after or during operation. Here we present an application example of the method. We show static pressure measured by research instruments on the German atmospheric research aircraft HALO compared to ECMWF analysis for 57 hours of data from an atmospheric research project over Europe in 2014. The method is used to derive corrected static pressure data. The corrected pressure also leads to a slightly better agreement between temperature measurements and ECMWF data which differed more when using the uncorrected pressure data as input for interpolation in the NWP data...|$|E
40|$|Pressure-based {{airspeed}} and altitude {{measurements for}} aircraft typically require calibration of the installed system {{to account for}} pressure sensing errors such as those due to local flow field effects. In some cases, calibration is used to meet requirements such as those specified in Federal Aviation Regulation Part 25. Several methods are used for in-flight pitot-static calibration including tower fly-by, pacer aircraft, and <b>trailing</b> <b>cone</b> methods. In the 1990 s, the introduction of satellite-based positioning systems to the civilian market enabled new inflight calibration methods based on accurate ground speed measurements provided by Global Positioning Systems (GPS). Use of GPS for airspeed calibration has many advantages such as accuracy, ease of portability (e. g. hand-held) and the flexibility of operating in airspace without the limitations of test range boundaries or ground telemetry support. The current research was motivated by {{the need for a}} rapid and statistically accurate method for in-flight calibration of pitot-static systems for remotely piloted, dynamically-scaled research aircraft. Current calibration methods were deemed not practical for this application because of confined test range size and limited flight time available for each sortie. A method was developed that uses high data rate measurements of static and total pressure, and GPSbased ground speed measurements to compute the pressure errors over a range of airspeed. The novel application of this approach is the use of system identification methods that rapidly compute optimal pressure error models with defined confidence intervals in nearreal time. This method has been demonstrated in flight tests and has shown 2 - bounds of approximately 0. 2 kts with an order of magnitude reduction in test time over other methods. As part of this experiment, a unique database of wind measurements was acquired concurrently with the flight experiments, for the purpose of experimental validation of the optimization method. This paper describes the GPS-based pitot-static calibration method developed for the AirSTAR research test-bed operated as part of the Integrated Resilient Aircraft Controls (IRAC) project in the NASA Aviation Safety Program (AvSP). A description of the method will be provided and results from recent flight tests will be shown to illustrate the performance and advantages of this approach. Discussion of maneuver requirements and data reduction will be included as well as potential applications...|$|E

This section {{is not intended to}} be all inclusive; readers should review AGARDograph 300, Volume 1, "Calibration of Airdata Systems and Flow Direction Sensors" for more detailed information. [11 - 1] References 11 - 2, 11 - 3, and 11 - 4 also supply pertinent information to better understand airdata measurement and calibration and related terminology. Airdata are vital to successfully complete an aircraft's mission and are derived from the air surrounding the aircraft. These airdata encompass indicated and true airspeed, pressure altitude, ambient air temperature, angles of attack and sideslip, Mach number, and rate of climb. Typically, pitot and static pressures are sensed and converted (by mechanical means in the instruments themselves) into indications on the altimeter, vertical speed indicator, airspeed indicator, and Machmeter. Similarly, measured local flow angles establish angles of attack and sideslip, and the outside air temperature is measured and indicated in the cockpit. (Instruments that can perform the conversion, such as airspeed indicators, altimeters, and Machmeters, do not correct for errors in the input values.) These measured parameters are commonly input to the airdata computer which, using appropriate algorithms and correction factors (or calibrations, as discussed later), can provide other parameters, such as true airspeed, required by the aircraft's avionics or flight control system. The presence of the aircraft in the airstream causes input errors to the measuring instruments - the aircraft disturbs the air that it flies through, thereby also disturbing the airdata measurements. Figure 11 - 1 shows the airflow around an airplane wing. The air above the wing has lower pressure than the ambient air, while the pressure below the wing is higher than the ambient air. Compressibility and shock waves also disturb the air and affect the measurements. Compressibility effects become important above approximately Mach number 0. 3. As a result the static pressure around an airplane varies considerably with location. Local flow angles also differ from the free-stream flow direction. In straight-and-level flight the airflow rises to the wing leading edge and falls below the trailing edge, causing errors in flow direction measurements. To some extent these errors can be studied in wind tunnels, but wind-tunnel measurements cannot replace in-flight measurements...|$|E
