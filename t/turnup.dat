But, I hope, we are not so weak and blind to be deluded at this time of day, with such poor evasions. I could, if it were proper, demonstrate the very time when those two verses were composed, and name the author, who was no other than the famous Mr. Swan, so well known for his talent at quibbling, and was as virulent a Jacobite as any in England. Neither could he deny the fact, when he was taxed for it in my presence by Sir Harry Button-Colt, and Colonel Davenport, at the Smyrna coffee-house, on the 10th of June, 1701. Thus it appears to a demonstration, that those verses were only a blind to conceal the most dangerous designs of that party, who from the first years after the happy Revolution, used a cant way of talking in their clubs after this manner: [...] "We hope, to see the cards shuffled once more, and another king TURN UP trump:" [...] And, [...] "When shall we meet over a dish of TURNUPS?" [...] The same term of art was used in their plots against the government, and in their treasonable letters writ in ciphers, and deciphered by the famous Dr. Wallis, as you may read in the trials of those times. This I thought fit to set forth at large, and in so clear a light, because the Scotch and French authors have given a very different account of the word <b>TURNUP,</b> but whether out of ignorance or partiality I shall not decree; because I am sure, the reader is convinced by my discovery. It is to be observed, that this cry was sung in a particular manner by fellows in disguise, to give notice where those traitors were to meet, in order to concert their villainous designs.|$|E

It is concluded that CCO in very massive main sequence stars produces a great expansion of the stellar envelope if d/H(p) is large but not excessively large.

The muscle is exposed to its insertion on the humerus. Next the part of the muscles that originates from the spina scapulae, the posterior one third to one half, is isolated from the anterior portion of the muscle. The insertion of the posterior deltoid is then elevated of the muscle and the distance between the mobilized deltoid tendon to the olecranon is measured to determine the length of the interposition graft needed. The interposition graft must now be harvested from its donor site. It should be 5 to 10 cm longer than the gap.After this a longitudinal incision should be made over the triceps tendon in which two transverse slits are made. One end of the graft should be wrapped around the posterior deltoid and sutured securely to it, after which the grafted is passed through an intercutaneous tunnel towards the triceps tendon, woven through the transverse slits and sutured securely to the triceps tendon and itself.Once the graft is securely in place, the wound is closed and a long armcast is applied with the elbow at 10 degrees of flexion.|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} UV <b>turnup</b> in early-type galaxies from coadded IUE spectra {{reaching}} an unprecedented {{signal to noise}} ratio. Some spectral groups resulted with strong or moderate UV <b>turnup,</b> while in others it is very weak or absent. We study the relationships of the UV turn up intensity with absolute magnitude, X-ray and Hα luminosities. Galaxies in the strong UV <b>turnup</b> groups are systematically bright, and have high X-ray and Hα luminosities; however, some other galaxies with the latter properties do not exhibit a significant UV turn up. The spectral groups with an important intermediate age component are far-UV weak. The contribution from an intermediate age population with varying strength might explain why some red stellar population early-type galaxies present the UV turn up while others do not. The available spectral groups have been further coadded into one with strong UV <b>turnup</b> and another one without it, and we analyse their difference. We compare the spectral slope of the isolated UV <b>turnup</b> with IUE spectra of various hot sources which had been proposed in previous studies to explain it. We conclude that only very hot stars like sdO and sdB subdwarfs, some nuclei of planetary nebulae or DO white dwarfs, have the proper slope to explain the UV <b>turnup.</b> The UV <b>turnup</b> as detected through the IUE aperture is not featureless: it presents absorptions similar to those observed in the galaxies with weak far-UV flux. These features {{appear to be the}} λ 1400 Å and λ 1600 Å ones, characteristic of moderately cool white dwarfs (DA 5), which indicates that these stars are dominant flux contributors between λ 1300 - 2000 Å in the farUV weak groups. The cooling time of DA 5 stars together with the evolutionary time since they left the main sequence, imply that they evolved from low-mass stars possibly associated with the initial burst of star formation in early-type galaxies and/or merger events at intermediate ages. On the other hand, two possible scenari are discussed for the origin of the hot component which causes the UV turn up, one related to late stages of normal evolution of low-mass stars, and another related to past nuclear activity events and jets which might have blown away the atmospheres of red giants in the central parts of the galaxies, exposing the hot stellar cores and mimicking a spectral distribution like that of the hottest stars observed...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. | We analyse the UV {{properties}} of early-type galaxies from their UV spectra in the IUE library, including both normal and active nuclei. We co-added the spectra, {{and hence the}} objects into groups of similar spectral properties in the UV, also taking into account their properties in the visible/near-infrared ranges. Although, owing {{to the presence of}} a residual xed pattern noise, IUE data cannot be improved by co-addition as expected for spectra containing only random noise, this procedure still provided spectra of higher signal/noise ratio than in previous studies, often based on individual spectra and therefrom derived colour indices. Thanks to the co-adding procedure, information on spectral features can now be assessed. The red stellar population groups exhibit a far-UV flux at dierent levels. The higher ones denote the presence of the UV <b>turnup,</b> which possibly exhibits absorption features, at least as detected through the IUE aperture. As to the blue stellar population groups and/or AGNs, we have carried out simple syntheses with UV star cluster templates and galaxy spectra in order to infer the properties such as burst ages and contamination by an active nucleus. It has been possible to derive information on the extinction law aecting some internally reddened galaxies; there are cases where the presence of the 2200 A absorption feature suggests a reddening law similar to the Galactic one, and others without the 2200 A feature, suggesting that it is rather an SMC type law which applies, then...|$|E

Twenty stars are detected on the UIT image of M 67, including 11 blue stragglers, seven white dwarf candidates, and the yellow giant [...] white dwarf binary S 1040. The ultraviolet photometry of the blue stragglers F 90 (S 975) and F 131 (S 1082) suggests that these stars have hot subluminous companions. We present a semi-empirical integrated ultraviolet spectrum of M 67, and show that the blue stragglers dominate the integrated spectrum at wavelengths shorter than 2600 A. The number of white dwarfs in M 67 is roughly consistent with the number expected from white dwarf cooling models. Eight candidate sdB/sdO stars are detected in NGC 6791, and two are detected in NGC 188. The luminosity range 1. 10 < log L/Lsun < 1. 27, derived from the ultraviolet photometry of the six sdB candidates, is consistent with theoretical models of metal-rich hot horizontal branch (HB) stars. The fraction of hot HB stars in both NGC 6791 and NGC 188 is about 30 %, implying that the integrated spectra of both clusters should show a UV <b>turnup</b> at least as strong as that observed in any elliptical galaxy.

40|$|The {{differential}} energy {{spectra of}} cosmic-ray protons and He nuclei have been measured at energies up to 315 MeV/nucleon using balloon- and satellite-borne instruments. These spectra are presented for solar quiet {{times for the}} years 1966 through 1970. The data analysis is verified by extensive accelerator calibrations of the detector systems and by calculations and measurements of the production of secondary protons in the atmosphere. The spectra of protons and He nuclei in this energy range are dominated by the solar modulation of the local interstellar spectra. The transport equation governing this process includes as parameters the solar-wind velocity, V, and a diffusion coefficient, K(r,R), which {{is assumed to be}} a scalar function of heliocentric radius, r, and magnetic rigidity, R. The interstellar spectra, j D, enter as boundary conditions on the solutions to the transport equation. Solutions to the transport equation have been calculated for a broad range of assumed values for K(r,R) and j D and have been compared with the measured spectra. It is found that the solutions may be characterized in terms of a dimensionless parameter, ψ(r,R) = ∞ ∫ r V dr'/(K(r',R). The amount of modulation is roughly proportional to ψ. At high energies or far from the Sun, where the modulation is weak, the solution is determined primarily by the value of ψ (and the interstellar spectrum) and is not sensitive to the radial dependence of the diffusion coefficient. At low energies and for small r, where the effects of adiabatic deceleration are found to be large, the spectra are largely determined by the radial dependence of the diffusion coefficient and are not very sensitive to the magnitude of ψ or to the interstellar spectra. This lack of sensitivity to j D implies that the shape of the spectra at Earth cannot be used to determine the interstellar intensities at low energies. Values of ψ determined from electron data were used to calculate the spectra of protons and He nuclei near Earth. Interstellar spectra of the form j D α (W - 0. 25 m) - 2. 65 for both protons and He nuclei were found to yield the best fits to the measured spectra for these values of ψ, where W is the total energy and m is the rest energy. A simple model for the diffusion coefficient was used in which the radial and rigidity dependence are separable and K is independent of radius inside a modulation region which has a boundary at a distance D. Good agreement was found between the measured and calculated spectra for the years 1965 through 1968, using typical boundary distances of 2. 7 and 6. 1 A. U. The proton spectra observed in 1969 and 1970 were flatter than in previous years. This flattening could be explained in part by an increase in D, but also seemed to require that a noticeable fraction of the observed protons at energies as high at 50 to 100 MeV be attributed to quiet-time solar emission. The <b>turnup</b> in the spectra at low energies observed in all years was also attributed to solar emission. The diffusion coefficient used to fit the 1965 spectra is in reasonable agreement with that determined from the power spectra of the interplanetary magnetic field (Jokipii and Coleman, 1968). We find a factor of roughly 3 increase in ψ from 1965 to 1970, corresponding to the roughly order of magnitude decrease in the proton intensity at 250 MeV. The change in ψ might be attributed to a decrease in the diffusion coefficient, or, if the diffusion coefficient is essentially unchanged over that period (Mathews et al., 1971), might be attributed to an increase in the boundary distance, D. ...|$|E
