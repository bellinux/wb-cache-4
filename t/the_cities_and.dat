5|$|Achaea {{was now in}} turmoil, {{and some}} cities were close to revolt; many {{residents}} were angered at Aratus' decision to invite the Macedonians into the Peloponnese. Some also hoped that Cleomenes would introduce constitutional changes in their cities. Encouraged by this development, Cleomenes invaded Achaea and seized the cities of Pellene, Pheneus and Penteleium, effectively splitting the Achaean League in half. The Achaeans, concerned about developing treachery in Corinth and Sicyon, dispatched their mercenaries to garrison <b>the</b> <b>cities</b> <b>and</b> then went to Argos to celebrate the Nemean Games.|$|E

The genuine importance of the motorway as a transit route will be demonstrated upon completion of proposed expansion of Port of Rijeka and Rijeka transport node, since the A4 represents an integral part of the RijekaZagrebBudapest transport route.|$|E

He returned to Syria by summer, where he found that Piso had either ignored or revoked his orders to <b>the</b> <b>cities</b> <b>and</b> legions.

5|$|Some of the Bay Area Rapid Transit System's current {{coverage}} area was once served by an electrified streetcar and suburban train system called the Key System. This early 20th-century system once had regular transbay traffic across the lower {{deck of the}} Bay Bridge, but the system was dismantled in the 1950s and operated its last transbay crossing in 1958. By the mid-1950s, that system had been dismantled in favor of highway travel. A 1950s study of traffic problems in the Bay Area concluded the most cost-effective solution for the Bay Area's traffic woes would be to form a transit district charged with the construction and operation of a new, high-speed rapid transit system linking <b>the</b> <b>cities</b> <b>and</b> suburbs.|$|E

The nation was deeply divided into Colorado and Blanco camps. These partisan groups formed in the 1830s and arose out of patron–client relationships fostered by local caudillos in <b>the</b> <b>cities</b> <b>and</b> countryside.
