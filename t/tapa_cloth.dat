2500|$|Between {{the years}} 1928-1932 he painted {{a group of}} {{paintings}} he called [...] "Stylized". In his Orange Grove painting he used familiar motifs in a highly stylized rendition of orange groves found everywhere {{at the time in}} Florida. The round form of the orange tree mimicked by the round oranges themselves broken up by the lines of palm fronds, fences and crates. The lake is repeating the line of the arched trunk hanging over it. The grouping of leaves each is repeating cleverly the whole form of the lake. The ornamental form of Euphorbias was a persistent stimulus which produced three important paintings. In one, Euphorbia expressed a freer flowing style with its long undulating branches waving as a Bali dancer would, leading to the creation of The Dancers. In fact the Bali mask in the painting suggests a comparison. The very young Bali girls perform their ceremonial dances by undulating motion of the arms rather than of the feet or body. Mulford tried to show that the plant does the same thing in ten years what the Bali dancer can do in ten minutes. The motion of the plant is solidified and has the duration of many years, while the dance of the little girl is observed in but a fleeting glimpse of each movement. It is a unity of life's expressions with each form finding its happiness in expressing its rhythm within the limits of its timing. Another painting, Polynesian took as its pivot the five points of a talkative Stapelia whose form symbolizes heaven and sun. The pattern of the plant was echoed in the Polynesian <b>tapa</b> <b>cloth</b> which was the inspiration for the painting and is seen in the background. The angular Padilanthus was used as well to compose symphony of harmonious form. The idea of the painting was to build a symphonic interpretation of these motifs from their original primitive representations, reappearing again in living form. The few simple motifs are found repeated in each object with a natural simplicity which the artist has caught and tried to reproduce. Between the years 1930 and 1935 Mulford's paintings took on a combination of stylized and decorative style. The [...] "Philosophical" [...] series was started between 1932 and 1936. In Self Defense, every living thing has its own protection. This begins with the flowering date palm and its maze of thousand spikes or thorns pointing in every direction guarding reproduction from conception to maturing of egg cells that we call seeds or fruit. After this painting was completed, Mulford made a frame to hold it but immediately the frame seemed to defeat the purpose of the expression to be illustrated. The palm was confined. This led to painting the fronds on the frame, extending them {{up and out of the}} frame. He helped develop the Nyack Country Club in New York between the years 1932-1934. He used elephants to move and plow the dirt. Being the sensitive man that he was he observed that each elephant had his own personality and it was reflected in their eyes. His elephant painting reflects this insight. In Mimicry the artist sympathetically depicts the parallel relationship between one of the lizard's mannerisms and that of the Anthurium. The little tendrils and feet of the lowest white leaved vine compared to the little feet of the lizard. The appearance is very much the same. The leaves and flower in the painting represents the Aracae family, of which the calla lily is a member. They are among the earliest and simplest forms of plants. The lizard as well is a very early and simple form of the reptiles. The painting is filled with subtle repetitions with colors suggesting a deep primeval forest with its many hidden forms. He described the motivation behind the Climbers. It had been motivated by a huge, old, gnarled vine growing outside his studio at Tropical Arts. The vine in his painting climbs up the tree trunk for light and air. A small tendril is the intelligence part of the vine. It is the guide for its motivation. Likewise the small tender tongue of the snake is the sensitive ear and nose which guide the snake to quiet resting places. The parallel means of motivation of these two forms create the similar shape of their bodies and a similar type of intelligence. The vine and snake are both elemental and early forms of life, assembled in harmonious composition in this painting. His series Impressions of Mexico was completed between 1936 and 1938.|$|E

6000|$|... "Ain't they lovely, Sall?" [...] asked Brown, {{wiping the}} {{perspiration}} from his brow with {{the sleeve of}} his coat. That same coat, by the way, was very disreputable--threadbare and worn,--being four years old on the lowest calculation, and having seen much rough service, for Brown had an objection to the <b>tapa</b> <b>cloth,</b> and said he would stick to the old coat as long as it would stick to him. The truth is he felt it, with his worn canvas trousers and Guernsey shirt, to be in some sense a last link to [...] "home," [...] and he was loath to part with them.|$|E
6000|$|Neither must it be {{imagined}} {{that these women}} were condemned to be the laborious drudges who are fitly described as [...] "hewers of wood and drawers of water." [...] They did indeed draw {{a good deal of}} water in the course of each day, but they spent much time also in making the <b>tapa</b> <b>cloth</b> with which they repaired the worn-out clothes of their husbands, or fabricated petticoats for themselves and such of the children as had grown old enough to require such garments. But besides these occupations, they spent a portion of their time in prattling gossip, which, whatever the subject might be, was always accompanied {{with a great deal of}} merriment and hearty laughter. They also spent no small portion of their time in the sea, for bathing was one of the favourite amusements of the Pitcairners, young and old.|$|E
6000|$|They {{found that}} Tippahee's people at Wangaroa had accused the tribe of the Bay of Islands of leading the English to murder their chief, {{that there was}} in {{consequence}} a deadly feud, and that several desperate battles had been fought. Marsden {{knew that if he}} came as the friend of Duaterra and his tribe alone, party spirit would entirely alienate the rest of the islanders, and he therefore determined at once to prove that he came not as the ally of one party, but as the friend of both. He therefore determined to prove to the Wangaroans his confidence in them by not only landing among them unarmed, but actually spending the night among them. His friend Mr. Nicholas accompanied him in this, one of the most intrepid actions ever performed, when it is remembered that this tribe consisted of the cannibals who had eaten his own countrymen, and had of late been freshly provoked. The two gentlemen supped in Hunghi's hut on potatoes and fish, and then quietly walked over to the hostile camp, where they met with a friendly welcome. One of the natives who had sailed in an English vessel was able to interpret, and with his assistance Mr. Marsden explained the purpose of the missionaries, and the desirableness of peace. Maories appreciate being spoken to at length and with due respect, and they listened politely, making speeches in their own fashion in return, until towards eleven, when most had gone to rest. The two Englishmen wrapped themselves in their great coats and lay down, the interpreter bidding them lie near him. It was a clear night, countless stars shining above, the sea in front smooth, all around a forest of spears stuck upright in the earth, and on the ground the multitude of human beings in their scanty loose garb of <b>tapa</b> <b>cloth</b> lying fast asleep, while the man who had come as an apostle to them spent the night in thought and prayer. Such a scene can never be forgotten! ...|$|E
50|$|Polynesia {{is another}} {{important}} area of collections. Two select collections {{that contribute to the}} Polynesian collection are the Snow Collection and the Clark Collection. Both of these contain a number of <b>tapa</b> <b>cloths</b> and mats. The Snow Collection also displays many examples of jewelry and fans and the Dacosta Clark Collection contains spears, blades and clothing. Other Polynesian collections contain a variety of baskets, carved figurines and totems, and ceremonial clothing. These objects provide {{a deeper understanding of the}} cultures of Fiji, Hawaii, Samoa, Tonga and Australia.|$|R

50|$|The ancient Hawaiian economy became complex over time. People {{began to}} {{specialize}} in specific skills. Generations of families became committed to certain careers: roof thatchers, house builders, stone grinders, bird catchers who would make the feather cloaks of the alii, canoe builders. Soon, entire islands began {{to specialize in}} certain skilled trades. Oahu became the chief kapa (<b>tapa</b> bark <b>cloth)</b> manufacturer. Maui became the chief canoe manufacturer. The island of Hawaii exchanged bales of dried fish.|$|R
50|$|Māori made {{textiles}} from {{a number}} of plants, including harakeke, wharariki, tī kōuka, tōī, pingao, kiekie and toetoe—although the paper mulberry was introduced by Māori, who knew it as aute, it seems not to have thrived and bark <b>cloth</b> (<b>tapa)</b> was always rare.|$|R

60|$|But {{now they}} came to the mouth of the harbour and Mrs Macphail joined them. The ship turned sharply and steamed slowly in. It was a great land-locked harbour big enough to hold a fleet of battleships; and all around it rose, high and steep, the green hills. Near the entrance, getting such breeze as blew from the sea, stood the governor's house in a garden. The Stars and Stripes dangled languidly from a flagstaff. They passed two or three trim bungalows, and a tennis court, and then {{they came to}} the quay with its warehouses. Mrs Davidson pointed out the schooner, moored two or three hundred yards from the side, which was to take them to Apia. There was a crowd of eager, noisy, and good-humoured natives come {{from all parts of the}} island, some from curiosity, others to barter with the {{travellers}} on their way to Sydney; and they brought pineapples and huge bunches of bananas, <b>tapa</b> <b>cloths,</b> necklaces of shells or sharks' teeth, kava-bowls, and models of war canoes. American sailors, neat and trim, clean-shaven and frank of face, sauntered among them, and there was a little group of officials. While their luggage was being landed the Macphails and Mrs Davidson watched the crowd. Dr Macphail looked at the yaws from which most of the children and the young boys seemed to suffer, disfiguring sores like torpid ulcers, and his professional eyes glistened when he saw for the first time in his experience cases of elephantiasis, men going about with a huge, heavy arm or dragging along a grossly disfigured leg. Men and women wore the lava-lava.|$|R

40|$|This practice-based thesis {{argues that}} {{recognising}} {{the role of}} time in drawing {{is crucial to the}} development of theory relevant to contemporary drawing practice, and contributes to a new critical foundation for drawing&# 146;s future direction. It examines the role of time in the process of drawing and in the act of viewing drawing. Further, it explores the temporal dimension of the drawn line itself. It argues for seeing drawing as a speculative act, a mode of thinking which involves movement and the body. The thesis produces an explanatory schema to reframe contemporary practices in terms of an &# 145;expanded field of drawing&# 146;. This draws upon the pivotal work of Rosalind Krauss in her characterisation of the expanded field of sculpture. The Klein Group diagram developed in this thesis shows the renewed significance of the temporal dimension in 21 st Century drawing practices. The drawer&# 146;s relation to time in exploratory drawing is examined through a detailed analysis of the processes of practitioners. Through this the thesis demonstrates the drawer&# 146;s alternation between discontinuous moments in and out of time in the act of making a drawing. It also applies metaphors from anthropological studies of modes of transport, to argue that the freehand drawn line may be seen as a means of re-connecting to a sense of temporality that is abstracted out in a culture based on straight lines as timeless vectors. This research was provoked by an early personal experience in New Zealand, of viewing freehand drawing in Polynesian <b>tapa</b> <b>cloths.</b> Focussing particularly on the improvised, freehand &# 145;hiapo&# 146; works of Niue, the thesis examines the temporal effects of repetition and variation in these works. It argues that both the example of the &# 145;seafaring line&# 146;, and ideas surrounding the temporal and indexical aspects of these works, have renewed relevance for contemporary drawing practice. The studio component of this research both demonstrates and critically engages with ideas developed in this thesis. These ideas are investigated through the production of pyrographic drawings on paper: improvised, exploratory works made using heat and flame. The thesis explores the role of repetition and spatialisation of indexical elements in the representation of time, and how time plays a crucial role in improvisation in the drawing process...|$|R

Next day we walked out with this interesting man, and were much entertained and instructed by his conversation as we rambled through the cool, shady groves of bananas, citrons, limes, and other trees, or sauntered among the cottages of the natives, and watched them while they laboured diligently in the taro-beds or manufactured the <b>tapa,</b> or native <b>cloth.</b> To some of these Jack put questions, through the medium of the missionary; and the replies were such as to surprise us at the extent of their knowledge.
