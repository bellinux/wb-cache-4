500|$|In April 2016, the ABC-owned {{cable network}} Freeform {{announced}} Marvel's Cloak & Dagger, {{based on the}} characters of the same name, with a straight-to-series order for 2018. The network confirmed that the series would be [...] "its first venture into the Marvel Cinematic Universe", and described the show as a [...] "superhero love story", a premise that Variety called [...] "a seamless fit for Freeform" [...] given the network's target audience of [...] "Becomers" [...] (the 14-34 age demographic). This younger-skewing content was continued with the comedy series Marvel's New Warriors ordered in April 2017, with Freeform executive Karey Burke saying, Marvel [...] "started to see our strength with young adults and together we could create a pipeline for content that was specific to our audience that felt younger than what they're doing at the other channels... It was important <b>to</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> {{to find the right}} characters that felt like they would speak directly to Freeform's audience. The Avengers wouldn't work here but the about-to-be-Avengers works here." [...] Loeb noted that it was [...] "exciting" [...] to Marvel [...] "to be able to explore the world of the hero and how it affects someone who {{is trying to figure out}} who they are as opposed to already knows who they are and now their whole life has to take a left. That's the journey we're going on with these kinds of characters" [...] in Cloak & Dagger, New Warriors and Hulu's Runaways. In November 2017, it was announced that New Warriors would no longer air on Freeform and was being shopped to other networks.|$|E

Adalgisa tells her that she'll never leave Gaul and only agreed to the request in order to do what was good for Norma. (Duet, Adalgisa: Vado al campo, ed all'ingrato Tutti io reco i tuoi lamenti.) In the duet, Adalgisa agrees to go to the Roman camp and tell Pollione of Norma's grief but her hope is to persuade him to return to Norma. She then renounces Pollione: (Duet: Mira, o Norma / [...] "O Norma, look at your dear children of yours on your knees. Be moved by pity for them, even if you have no pity for yourself.")

40|$|At {{the outset}} of this essay, we need <b>to</b> {{position}} ourselves. <b>Both</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> have long histories as educators who work with schools and communities on issues of crucial importance <b>to</b> them. <b>Both</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> are part <b>of</b> a tradition of critical education that seeks to democratize {{the ways in which}} knowledge, teaching, participation, funding, and so much else are now dealt with in education. And <b>both</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> see clear relations between acting in the educa-tional arena and acting in the larger society. Because of this, we have also been influenced in various ways by work that is similar to or comes out of a tradition exemplified by Paulo Freire. Having said this, however, neither <b>of</b> <b>us</b> is simply Freirian or an unquestioning “disciple ” of Freire. These introductory points are important, given what we shall say in our analysis of the arguments made in the book about which we will speak. The publication and distribution of Pedagogy of the Oppressed (Freire, 1974) was a landmark event in the field of education. Since its original pub-lication and subsequent translation into many languages, Freire has influ-enced millions of people worldwide as the corpus of his work has been disseminated during the past 30 -plus years. Pedagogy of the Oppressed alone has sold more than 750, 000 copies since its publication in 1970 (Contiuum International Publishing Group, 2005), and a review of the lit-erature would find that a cottage industry of publishing and research that numbers in the thousands has sprung around the political and pedagogical contributions of Paulo Freire (Apple, 1999; Schugurensky, 1998). For better or worse, such widespread distribution of Freire’s work has meant that his words and ideas have been reinterpreted within settings that are rad-ically different from his original context of Brazil in the early 1960 s, an...|$|R

[...] Appearances are made by Bieber's friend, Christian Beadles, as well as rapper Lil Romeo and singer/actress Jasmine Villegas, whose appearance further fuelled media speculation Villegas and Bieber were romantically involved after a previous appearance in his music video for 'Baby'. Jocelyn Vena of MTV News reviewed the video, [...] "Here's the play-by-play: While Kingston and the lady in question are flirting out on the deck, Bieber is chilling inside. But, wait — there she is flirting with Bieber while Kingston is hanging out, wondering where she went. The fickle girl eventually leaves Bieber to chill with Kingston, and then — boom — there she is with Bieber again. And, well, you get it. Of course, the 'eenie-meenie-miny-moe lover' eventually gets caught. While she's chatting up Kingston, along comes Bieber, and her game is blown. The dudes are cool with it.

40|$|The {{advances}} in Internet and information technologies {{in the last}} ten years have brought about a structural change in the way information is aggregated, transformed, and then disseminated. Most people of the older generation prefer to get their news the old-fashioned way i. e., from newspapers and magazines. The younger generation, on the other hand, logs on to online sources for their information needs. There is genuine concern that as the older generation moves on, the old media will also gradually disappear. The rise of the new media has put the old (print) media establishment on the defensive. The new is not displacing the old, however; rather, it is transforming the old by forcing it to accept transparency, responsiveness and e$ciency. Increased competition is making the old media to pull up its socks and provide the additional value demanded by a free market where the number of players has multiplied.

40|$|The {{journey of}} this book started more than 10 years ago. At this time, the {{efficacy}} of cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) in treating anxiety and mood disorders was well established. However, the efficacy of CBT in treating problem gambling was still unclear. In addition, due to changes in government policies and social factors gambling, in particular casino and electronic machine gambling were legalized and thus, widely accessible {{to the public in}} general. Thus, problem gambling and in particular the treatment of problem gambling became an important issue. Professor Oei is one of the earlier researchers examining the efficacy of CBT for the treatment of addictive behaviours, in particular alcohol addiction (Jackson & Oei, 1978; Oei & Jackson, 1980; 1982; 1984). When Dr. Raylu arrived at the University of Queensland in 1999, the journey {{of this book}} began. We decided <b>to</b> collaborate.

50|$|NH 9 {{begins in}} the west where VT 9 crosses the Connecticut River from Brattleboro, Vermont, into Chesterfield, New Hampshire. The highway meanders {{its way through the}} large town (by area) en route to Keene, home of Keene State College. NH 9 enters the {{southern}} part of the city and intersects with the triplex of NH 10, NH 12, and NH 101, the latter of which has its western terminus here. NH 9 joins NH 10 and NH 12, bypassing downtown Keene to the west. After about a mile, NH 12 splits off to the northwest. Two miles later, NH 10 follows suit and NH 9 continues northeast, crossing through parts of Roxbury, Sullivan, and Nelson en route to Stoddard, where NH 9 intersects with NH 123. The two routes overlap for about a mile before NH 123 splits northwest, while NH 9 continues east. The highway passes along the northern edge of Antrim, intersecting and overlapping with NH 31. The two routes cross into the town of Hillsborough, where NH 31 splits off to the northwest and NH 9 becomes a semi-limited access highway (not quite up to super-two standards due to a number of at-grade intersections). One mile (1.6 km) to the east, NH 9 interchanges with US 202 and the two routes form the first of two lengthy concurrencies. US 202 and NH 9 bypass downtown Hillsborough to the north, as well as the neighboring town of Henniker, before entering Hopkinton. US 202 and NH 9 intersect NH 127 near the town line and continue east to one of two partial interchanges with I-89. The first interchange allows the following movements: US 202/NH 9 east to I-89 south, US 202/NH 9 west to I-89 north, I-89 north to US 202/NH 9 west, and I-89 south <b>to</b> <b>both</b> directions <b>of</b> <b>US</b> 202/NH 9. The highway continues into town, intersecting the southern terminus of NH 103 (a secondary highway paralleling I-89 north) before intersecting I-89 again, with southbound-only access to the Interstate highway. US 202 and NH 9 enter the city of Concord from the west and roughly parallel I-89 until reaching downtown. The two highways intersect the northern terminus of NH 13 before meeting US 3 downtown. US 202 and NH 9 turn north onto US 3 for about six blocks before NH 9 turns east onto Loudon Road, intersecting with I-93 (US 202 continues along US 3 to meet I-393 just to the north). NH 9 runs as Loudon Road parallel to I-393 (which also carries US 4 and US 202), with access possible via NH 132 (East Side Drive) and NH 106 (Sheep Davis Road - NH 106 is also the route to New Hampshire Motor Speedway, which lies 9.5 mi to the north).

40|$|Since the {{implementation}} of the USA Patriot Act in October 2001, public trust in the U. S. federal government to protect individuals 2 ̆ 7 right to privacy has been affected negatively. Many studies have addressed this topic, but few have delved deeply into the reasons behind the distrust. The purposes of this qualitative study were, to explore the perceptions and attitudes of U. S. citizens regarding the effect of the USA Patriot Act on their right to privacy, to determine whether a loss of trust in the government occurred, and to identify the factors contributing to the lack of trust. The theoretical foundation for this study was Rawl 2 ̆ 7 s Social Perspective of Public Trust, Sax 2 ̆ 7 s Augmentation of Social Contract Theory, and Ajzen 2 ̆ 7 s Theory of Planned Behavior. The central research question pertained to the views of U. S. citizens about the federal government 2 ̆ 7 s use of electronic surveillance to monitor their communication without their knowledge. A generic qualitative study design was employed using purposeful, semi-structured interviews of 20 purposely sampled adult male and female U. S. citizens. Data from the interviews were coded and categorized for thematic analysis. When confronted with the lesser known specifics of the electronic surveillance provision of the USA Patriot Act, participants were more likely to reject the government interference as an invasion of privacy. This study can provide guidance for the democratic basis of policymaking designed to protect U. S. citizens. The implication for social change includes providing information <b>to</b> policymakers <b>of</b> <b>both</b> the <b>US</b> and organizations <b>of</b> various sizes regarding the polarized views and lack of trust pertaining to electronic surveillance among U. S. public. This information can be used to implement program or campaign to foster trust...|$|R
