40|$|The study {{examined}} the incremental validity of thinking styles in predicting academic achievement after controlling for personality and achievement motivation in the hypermedia-based learning environment. Seventy-two Chinese college students from Shanghai, the People's Republic of China, took part in this instructional experiment. The End-Of-Semester test was designed to examine the students' achievement {{in the course of}} General Psychology. The results partially supported the hypotheses concerning the relationships between students' Type I and II thinking styles and their academic achievement in Type I test (including analysis, problem-solving, and essay tests) and <b>Type</b> <b>II</b> <b>test</b> (including multiple-choice and cloze tests), and showed that some Type III styles were significantly related to their academic achievement. Hierarchical regression analysis indicated that the capacity of thinking styles for explaining and predicting academic achievement was sometimes over and above the sum of personality traits and achievement motivation.

40|$|AbstractDeficiency of argininosuccinate {{synthetase}} (ASS) causes citrullinemia. <b>Type</b> <b>II</b> citrullinemia {{is found}} in most patients with adult-onset citrullinemia in Japan, and ASS is deficient specifically in the liver. Previous {{studies have shown that}} the decrease of hepatic ASS activity is caused by a decrease in enzyme protein with normal kinetic properties and that there are no apparent abnormalities in the amount, translational activity, and nucleotide sequence of hepatic ASS mRNA. Recent results of homozygosity testing indicate that the primary defect of <b>type</b> <b>II</b> citrullinemia is not within the ASS gene locus. In this present work, to understand the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of <b>type</b> <b>II</b> citrullinemia, we have characterized the alterations of gene expression in the liver of <b>type</b> <b>II</b> patients using the recently developed mRNA differential display method. Some cDNA bands expressed differently in <b>type</b> <b>II</b> citrullinemia patients and control were selected, cloned, and sequenced. Nucleotide sequence analysis and homology searching revealed an interesting clone which has 99 % homology with the human pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor (hPSTI). Northern blot and RT-PCR analyses showed that the expression of hPSTI mRNA increased significantly in the liver of all <b>type</b> <b>II</b> patients <b>tested.</b> Furthermore, the concentration of hPSTI protein was found to be higher in the liver of <b>type</b> <b>II</b> citrullinemia than in control.

40|$|Freight Wing Incorporated {{utilized}} the opportunity presented by this DOE category one Inventions and Innovations grant to successfully research, develop, test, patent, market, and sell innovative fuel and emissions saving aerodynamic attachments for the trucking industry. A {{great deal of}} past scientific {{research has demonstrated that}} streamlining box shaped semi-trailers can significantly reduce a truck's fuel consumption. However, significant design challenges have prevented past concepts from meeting industry needs. Market research early in this project revealed the demands of truck fleet operators regarding aerodynamic attachments. Products must not only save fuel, but cannot interfere with the operation of the truck, require significant maintenance, add significant weight, and must be extremely durable. Furthermore, SAE/TMC J 1321 tests performed by a respected independent laboratory are necessary for large fleets to even consider purchase. Freight Wing used this information to create a system of three practical aerodynamic attachments for the front, rear and undercarriage of standard semi trailers. SAE/TMC J 1321 <b>Type</b> <b>II</b> <b>tests</b> preformed by the Transportation Research Center (TRC) demonstrated a 7 % improvement to fuel economy with all three products. If Freight Wing is successful in its continued efforts to gain market penetration, the energy and environmental savings would be considerable. Each truck outfitted saves approximately 1, 100 gallons of fuel every 100, 000 miles, which prevents over 12 tons of CO 2 from entering the atmosphere.

Methods: Immunohistochemistry and western blotting were used for detecting and locating trypsin isoforms in the vitreous and retina of human donor eyes. The capability of the retina to produce these trypsins was analyzed with polymerase chain reaction. Whether the different trypsins degraded <b>type</b> <b>II</b> collagen was <b>tested</b> in vitro. The sizes of the in vitro induced <b>type</b> <b>II</b> collagen degradation products were compared to those present in the vitreous of human eyes of different ages.

Using immunohistochemistry, trypsin- 2 was detected in microglial cells located in the vitreous and the retina. All trypsin isoforms degraded <b>type</b> <b>II</b> collagen and produced degradation products of similar sizes as those present in the vitreous.

The results show that: When {{two parts of the}} stone combinations in the test specimens are combined in a minor angle (30 °~ 60 °) (type I), under sustained loading without failure, acoustic emission amplitude will increase during steady creep stage with surface crack opening and propagating. When two parts of the stone combinations in the test specimens are combined in a large angle (60 °~ 90 °) (<b>type</b> <b>II),</b> under sustained loading without failure, the test specimens show two varied features. On one hand, acoustic emission amplitude will decrease significantly during steady creep stage, with surface crack opening and propagating which will mainly occur during decelerated creep stage. On the other hand, acoustic emission amplitude is rather fluctuating during sustained load stage which leads to separation and drop of parts of the test specimen. One common trait of these two types of test specimens is that, the whole decelerated creep and steady creep stages show relatively stable acoustic emission amplitude before destruction.

40|$|Chondroadherin (the 36 -kD protein) is a leucine-rich, {{cartilage}} {{matrix protein}} known to mediate adhesion of isolated chondrocytes. In {{the present study}} we investigated cell surface proteins involved in the interaction of cells with chondroadherin in cell adhesion and by affinity purification. Adhesion of bovine articular chondrocytes to chondroadherin-coated dishes was dependent on Mg 2 + or Mn 2 + but not Ca 2 +. Adhesion was partially inhibited by an antibody recognizing β 1 integrin subunit. Chondroadherin-binding proteins from chondrocyte lysates were affinity purified on chondroadherin-Sepharose. The β 1 integrin antibody immunoprecipitated two proteins with molecular mass ∼ 110 and 140 kD (nonreduced) from the EDTA-eluted material. These results indicate that a β 1 integrin on chondrocytes interacts with chondroadherin. To identify the α integrin subunit(s) involved in interaction of cells with the protein, we affinity purified chondroadherin-binding membrane proteins from human fibroblasts. Immunoprecipitation of the EDTA-eluted material from the affinity column identified α 2 β 1 as a chondroadherin-binding integrin. These results are in agreement with cell adhesion experiments where antibodies against the integrin subunit α 2 partially inhibited adhesion of human fibroblast and human chondrocytes to chondroadherin. Since α 2 β 1 also is a receptor for collagen <b>type</b> <b>II,</b> we <b>tested</b> the ability of different antibodies against the α 2 subunit to inhibit adhesion of T 47 D cells to collagen <b>type</b> <b>II</b> and chondroadherin.

Recently {{it has been}} proved that motor dysfunction {{in the form of}} skeletal muscle dysfunction does occur in <b>type</b> <b>II</b> DM. However very few studies have assessed the upper limb skeletal muscle dysfunction. Objectives: The study was aimed to assess the hand grip strength, endurance in type 2 DM patients and compare the same with age matched healthy controls. We also correlated glycosylated Hb and duration of illness with the hand grip strength and endurance in the patients. Materials and Methods: Hand grip dynamometer was used to measure the hand grip strength and endurance in sixty diagnosed patients of <b>type</b> <b>II</b> DM. Similar <b>tests</b> were performed in age matched healthy controls. Blood samples were collected for blood glucose fasting, postprandial levels and Hb 1 AC in both the groups. Comparisons between patients and controls, and correlations were done by applying suitable tests. Results: The hand grip muscle strength and endurance in <b>type</b> <b>II</b> DM patients were significantly lower as compared to the normal controls (P 0. 05). Conclusions: The present study shows that <b>type</b> <b>II</b> DM patients suffer from skeletal muscle dysfunction in the form of reduced hand grip strength and endurance. Hence the treating Physician should not be ignorant about these disabilities. In addition to the strict measures to control the blood glucose levels, interventions to improve the muscle mass and strength in these patients should be undertaken...|$|R

40|$|How do {{the errors}} of {{regulators}} – approving bad products, or rejecting good ones – {{depend upon the}} submission strategies and characteristics of submitting private entities or firms? We develop a model of approval regulation in which both firm and regulator are uncertain about the underlying quality of a product, but where the firm is better informed than the regulator. The model predicts that the commission of regulatory error depends heavily upon the induced submission strategies of firms, and in particular {{on the amount of}} time that firms take to experiment with their products before submitting them. Specifically, our analysis predicts that when experimentation is short and experimental costs are high, Type I errors (approving bad products) should be disproportionately associated with products submitted by firms with lower experimentation costs (larger firms), and <b>Type</b> <b>II</b> errors (rejecting good products) should be concentrated among products submitted by smaller firms. However, when experimentation is long and experimental costs are low, Type I errors should be concentrated among small firms, while <b>Type</b> <b>II</b> errors will be concentrated among larger firms.

Little is known about how <b>type</b> <b>II</b> diabetes, another prevalent age-related medical condition, and presbycusis interact. The present investigation aimed to comprehensively characterize the nature of hearing impairment in aged <b>type</b> <b>II</b> diabetics. Hearing <b>tests</b> measuring both peripheral (cochlea) and central (brainstem and cortex) auditory processing were utilized. The majority of differences between the hearing abilities of the aged diabetics and their age-matched controls were found in measures of inner ear function. For example, large differences were found in pure-tone audiograms, wideband noise and speech reception thresholds, and otoacoustic emissions. The greatest deficits tended to be at low frequencies. In addition, there was a strong tendency for diabetes to affect the right ear more than the left. One possible interpretation is that as one develops presbycusis, the right ear advantage is lost, and this decline is accelerated by diabetes. In contrast, auditory processing tests that measure both peripheral and central processing showed fewer declines between the elderly diabetics and the control group.

40|$|Intracellular {{triglyceride}} (TG) is {{an important}} energy source for skeletal muscle. However, recent evidence suggests that if muscle contains abnormally high TG stores its sensitivity to insulin may be reduced, and this could predispose to <b>type</b> <b>II</b> diabetes. To <b>test</b> this hypothesis, we measured muscle lipid content in 27 women aged 47 to 55 years (mean, 52) and related it to their glucose tolerance, insulin resistance, and muscle insulin sensitivity as measured by insulin activation of glycogen synthase, an insulin-regulated enzyme that is rate-limiting for insulin action in muscle. Both muscle TG content and intracellular lipid determined by Oil red O staining of muscle fibers were negatively associated with glycogen synthase activation (r =. 43, P =. 03 and r = -. 47, P =. 02, respectively). In addition, intracellular lipid correlated with features of the insulin resistance syndrome, including an increased waist to hip ratio (r =. 47, P =. 01) and fasting nonesterified fatty acids ([NEFA] r =. 44, P =. 04). These data demonstrate that increased muscle TG stores are associated with decreased insulin-stimulated glycogen synthase activity.

While small molecules have been heavily tested as inhibitors of amyloidogenesis, peptides have emerged as potential inhibitors. In this work, the ability of a set of designed hairpin peptides to inhibit the amyloidogenesis of two different systems, α-synuclein (implicated in Parkinson’s Disease) and human amylin (implicated in <b>Type</b> <b>II</b> Diabetes) is <b>tested.</b> Using circular dichroism and thioflavin T fluorescence, the ability of these peptides to inhibit amyloidogenesis is tested. The binding loci of these inhibitors to α-synuclein are also explored. The use of peptides as antimicrobials on the other hand is not a novel concept. However, most antimicrobial peptides, both natural and designed, rely heavily on covalent stabilizations in order to maintain secondary structure. In this study, non-covalent stabilizations are applied to a couple of natural as well as designed antimicrobials in order to study the effects of secondary structure stabilization on biological activity...|$|R
40|$|Given {{samples from}} {{distributions}} p and q, a two-sample test determines whether {{to reject the}} null hypothesis that p = q, based {{on the value of}} a test statistic measuring the distance between the samples. One choice of test statistic is the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD), which is a distance between embeddings of the probability distributions in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. The kernel used in obtaining these embeddings is critical in ensuring the test has high power, and correctly distinguishes unlike distributions with high probability. A means of parameter selection for the two-sample test based on the MMD is proposed. For a given test level (an upper bound on the probability of making a Type I error), the kernel is chosen so as to maximize the test power, and minimize the probability of making a <b>Type</b> <b>II</b> error. The <b>test</b> statistic, test threshold, and optimization over the kernel parameters are obtained with cost linear in the sample size. These properties make the kernel selection and test procedures suited to data streams, where the observations cannot all be stored in memory. In experiments, the new kernel selection approach yields a more powerful test than earlier kernel selection heuristics. ...|$|R

40|$|Cartilage is an {{avascular}} tissue, {{which becomes}} vascularized during arthritis. The main component of cartilage is collagen <b>type</b> <b>II.</b> We {{want to know}} if collagen <b>type</b> <b>II</b> has antiangiogenic properties or if chondrocytes release antiangiogenic factors responsible for avascular cartilage. Evidence shows that endothelial cells produce matrix metalloproteinases that degrade collagen <b>type</b> <b>II</b> and express integrins to attach to collagen <b>type</b> <b>II.</b> Thus making vessel ingrowth possible and suggesting that collagen <b>type</b> <b>II</b> in itself is not antiangiogenic. Our second question deals with the feasibility of printing collagen <b>type</b> <b>II</b> using a fiber deposition system. Collagen type I gels have been printed simply diluted with DMEM or by adding thickeners such as alginate, fibrinogen or hyaluronic acid. As collagen <b>type</b> I and <b>II</b> are similar, we suggest printing collagen <b>type</b> <b>II</b> mixed with chondrocytes and if necessary the thickeners. In conclusion, collagen <b>type</b> <b>II</b> is not antiangiogenic and it is feasible to print collagen <b>type</b> <b>II</b> scaffolds...|$|R

40|$|The {{production}} of autoantibodies to citrullinated <b>type</b> <b>II</b> collagen and the citrullination of <b>type</b> <b>II</b> collagen were analyzed in rheumatoid arthritis. Autoantibodies to citrullinated <b>type</b> <b>II</b> collagen were detected in 78. 5 % of serum samples from 130 rheumatoid arthritis patients. Autoantibodies to native noncitrullinated <b>type</b> <b>II</b> collagen were detected in 14. 6 % of serum samples, {{all of which}} were positive for anti-citrullinated <b>type</b> <b>II</b> collagen antibodies. Serum samples were also positive for anti-citrullinated <b>type</b> <b>II</b> collagen antibodies in 1 of 31 systemic lupus erythematosus patients and 2 of 55 patients with osteoarthritis of the knee. In contrast, sera samples from 24 systemic sclerosis patients, 21 dermatomyositis/polymyositis patients, 21 ankylosing spondylitis patients, and 18 psoriatic arthritis patients were all negative for anti-citrullinated <b>type</b> <b>II</b> collagen antibodies. Anti-citrullinated <b>type</b> <b>II</b> collagen antibodies and fragments of citrullinated <b>type</b> <b>II</b> collagen were found in the synovial fluid obtained from affected knee joints of 15 rheumatoid arthritis patients. Moreover, anti-citrullinated <b>type</b> <b>II</b> collagen antibodies were isolated from the synovium of affected knee joints in 8 rheumatoid arthritis patients using antigen/antibody immunocomplex dissociation buffer but not by using standard buffers. These findings indicate that autoantibodies that react with citrullinated <b>type</b> <b>II</b> collagen are specifically produced and that immunocomplexes composed of fragments of citrullinated <b>type</b> <b>II</b> collagen and autoantibodies are deposited in the inflamed articular synovium in rheumatoid arthritis patients. Assaying for the presence of anti-citrullinated <b>type</b> <b>II</b> collagen antibodies may therefore be useful for diagnosing rheumatoid arthritis, and the deposition of these immunocomplexes in the articular synovium may be involved in pathogenesis...|$|R
