5|$|Compounding in Khmer is {{a common}} derivational process that <b>takes</b> <b>two</b> forms, {{coordinate}} compounds and repetitive compounds. Coordinate compounds join two unbound morphemes (independent words) of similar meaning to form a compound signifying a concept more general than either word alone. Coordinate compounds join either two nouns or two verbs. Repetitive compounds, {{one of the most}} productive derivational features of Khmer, use reduplication of an entire word to derive words whose meaning will depend on the class of the reduplicated word. A repetitive compound of a noun indicates plurality or generality while that of an adjectival verb could mean either an intensification or plurality.|$|E
5|$|Dengue fever is a mosquito-borne {{tropical}} disease {{caused by the}} dengue virus. Symptoms typically begin three to fourteen days after infection. This may include a high fever, headache, vomiting, muscle and joint pains, and a characteristic skin rash. Recovery generally <b>takes</b> <b>two</b> to seven days. In {{a small proportion of}} cases, the disease develops into the life-threatening dengue hemorrhagic fever, resulting in bleeding, low levels of blood platelets and blood plasma leakage, or into dengue shock syndrome, where dangerously low blood pressure occurs.|$|E
5|$|Egg-laying <b>takes</b> <b>two</b> {{different}} forms {{depending on the}} species. The female in some families has a sharp-edged ovipositor with which she slits open a stem or leaf of a plant {{on or near the}} water, so she can push her eggs inside. In other families such as clubtails (Gomphidae), cruisers (Macromiidae), emeralds (Corduliidae), and skimmers (Libellulidae), the female lays eggs by tapping {{the surface of the water}} repeatedly with her abdomen, by shaking the eggs out of her abdomen as she flies along, or by placing the eggs on vegetation. In a few species, the eggs are laid on emergent plants above the water, and development is delayed until these have withered and become immersed.|$|E

5|$|Incubation <b>takes</b> <b>two</b> weeks. The hatched young, called squabs, are {{strongly}} altricial, being helpless at hatching {{and covered with}} down. Both parents feed the squabs pigeon's milk (dove's milk) for the first 3–4 days of life. Thereafter, the crop milk is gradually augmented by seeds. Fledging takes place in about 11–15 days, before the squabs are fully grown but after {{they are capable of}} digesting adult food. They stay nearby to be fed by their father for up to two weeks after fledging.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{original}} slogans of the Whopper advertised by Burger King was There are 1024 ways to have a Whopper; the claim {{is based on an}} exponential function of whether the sandwich has the ingredient or not, represented by a binary number of 0 or 1, raised to the power of number of possible ingredients at the time, ten, thus 210 =1,024. This claim was later expanded to There are 221,184 possible ways for a customer to order a Whopper sandwich. Other slogans include It <b>takes</b> <b>two</b> hands to handle a Whopper and Burger King: Home of the Whopper.|$|E

5|$|Coulter {{appeared}} as a contestant on the Australian reality television show Celebrity Circus in May 2005, alongside eight other celebrities. The show's task was to train contestants as circus performers. In February 2008, she was a mentor on the third season of the celebrity singing show, It <b>Takes</b> <b>Two,</b> and was partnered with professional golfer and tennis player Scott Draper. Coulter and Draper were the third duo to be eliminated from the competition on 4 March. Later that year, she returned to Australian Idol as a host and reporter alongside James Mathison and Andrew Günsberg. Coulter co-hosted the show for two seasons, and received a nomination at the 2009 Logie Awards for Most Popular New Female Talent. Coulter became a mentor for the first season of The Voice Australia in 2012, and paired up with coach Seal to prepare the contestants in his team for the show's battle rounds. In 2014, Coulter became a contestant on the fourteenth season of Dancing with the Stars Australia and was partnered with professional dancer Jarryd Byrne. She {{made it to the}} grand finale and placed third in the competition. Coulter hosted the television program Life Changing Adventures, which premiered on 7Two on 11 June 2017.

5|$|Given {{the depths}} {{at which it}} lives, the goblin shark poses no danger to humans. A few {{specimens}} have been collected alive and brought to public aquariums, though they only survived a short time. One was kept at Tokai University and lived for a week, while another was kept at Tokyo Sea Life Park and lived for two days. Its economic significance is minimal; the meat may be dried and salted, while the jaws fetch high prices from collectors. At one time, the Japanese also used it for liver oil and fertilizer. This shark is not targeted by any fisheries, but is occasionally found as bycatch in bottom gillnets and trawls, hooked on longlines, or entangled in fishing gear. Most captures are isolated incidents; {{one of the few}} areas where it is caught regularly is off southern Japan, where around 30 individuals (mostly juveniles) are taken each year. A black scabbardfish (Aphanopus carbo) fishery off Madeira also <b>takes</b> <b>two</b> or three goblin sharks annually. In April 2003, over a hundred goblin sharks were caught off northwestern Taiwan; the cause of the event was unknown, though observers noted it was preceded by a major earthquake. The species had never been recorded in the area before, nor has it been found in such numbers since. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed the goblin shark under Least Concern. In addition to its wide range, most of its population is thought to reside in unfished environments because few adults are caught. Therefore, it is not believed to be threatened by human activity.|$|E
