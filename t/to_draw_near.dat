5|$|Further success {{followed}} in early 1777 with {{the capture of}} the 18-gun American privateer General Montgomery. News had reached England that this vessel was off the island of Madeira in March, having sailed from the Port of Philadelphia in February with a crew of 100 men. Levant was sent in pursuit, with her crew sighting the General Montgomery at midday on 8 March. Captain Murray ordered Levant to fly false colours, hoisting a Dutch flag to avoid alerting the privateer's crew. General Montgomery had also disguised herself by flying a British flag. For several hours the Americans allowed Levant <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> <b>near,</b> finally turning to flee when Murray fired a warning shot. A seven-hour chase ensued, extending into the night with the two ships often within musket shot but unable to bring their broadside cannons to bear. At around 1:00am the wind strengthened and Levant was able to overhaul her prey, forcing the out-gunned Americans to surrender. Nine of General Montgomerys crew enlisted aboard Levant, with the remainder being conveyed to Portsmouth where they remained imprisoned in poor conditions {{until the end of}} the war.|$|E
500|$|Napoleon had {{delayed the}} start of the battle owing to the sodden ground, which would have made {{manoeuvring}} cavalry and artillery difficult. In addition, many of his forces had bivouacked well to the south of La Belle Alliance. At 10:00, in response to a dispatch he had received from Grouchy six hours earlier, he sent a reply telling Grouchy to [...] "head for Wavre [...] in order <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> <b>near</b> to us [...] " [...] and then [...] "push before him" [...] the Prussians to arrive at Waterloo [...] "as soon as possible".|$|E
500|$|As {{the musical}} prelude climaxes, Woglinde and Wellgunde are seen {{at play in}} the depths of the Rhine. Flosshilde joins them after a gentle {{reminder}} of their responsibilities as guardians of the gold. They are observed by the Nibelung dwarf Alberich who calls out to them: [...] "I'd like <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> <b>near</b> if you would be kind to me". The wary Flosshilde cries: [...] "Guard the gold! Father warned us of such a foe". When Alberich begins his rough wooing the maidens relax: [...] "Now I laugh at my fears, our enemy is in love", says Flosshilde, and a cruel teasing game ensues. First, Woglinde pretends to respond to the dwarf's advances but swims away as he tries to embrace her. Then Wellgunde takes over, and Alberich's hopes rise until her sharp retort: [...] "Ugh, you hairy hunchbacked clown!" [...] Flosshilde pretends to chastise her sisters for their cruelty and feigns her own courtship, by which Alberich is quite taken in until she suddenly tears away to join the others in a mocking song. Tormented with lust, Alberich furiously chases the maidens over the rocks, slipping and sliding as they elude him, before he sinks down in impotent rage. At this point the mood changes: as a sudden brightness penetrates the depths, a magical golden light reveals, for the first time, the Rhinegold on its rock. The maidens sing their ecstatic greeting to the gold, which rouses Alberich's curiosity. In response to his question Woglinde and Wellgunde reveal the gold's secret: measureless power would belong to the one who could forge a ring from it. Flosshilde scolds them for giving this secret away, but her concerns are dismissedâ€”only someone who has forsworn love can obtain the gold, and Alberich is clearly so besotted as to present no danger. But their confidence is misplaced; in his humiliation Alberich decides that world mastery is more desirable than love. As the maidens continue to jeer his antics he scrambles up the rock and, uttering a curse on love, seizes the gold and disappears, leaving the Rhinemaidens to dive after him [...] bewailing their loss.|$|E

2500|$|A Midrash {{noted that}} [...] , and [...] say that Levites [...] "30 {{years old and}} upward" [...] did service in the tent of meeting, while [...] says, [...] "from 25 years old and upward they shall go in to perform the service {{in the work of}} the tent of meeting." [...] The Midrash deduced that the {{difference}} teaches that all those five years, from the age of 25 to the age of 30, Levites served apprenticeships, and from that time onward they were allowed <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> <b>near</b> to do service. The Midrash concluded that a Levite could not enter the Temple courtyard to do service unless he had served an apprenticeship of five years. And the Midrash inferred from this that students who see no sign of success in their studies within a period of five years will never see any. Rabbi Jose said that students had to see success within three years, basing his position on the words [...] "that they should be nourished three years" [...] in ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the fourth}} reading ( [...] , aliyah), in chapter [...] when Moses was keeping his {{father-in-law}} Jethro's flock at {{the mountain of}} God, Horeb (another name for the Biblical Mount Sinai), the angel of God appeared {{to him in a}} flame {{in the midst of a}} bush that burned but was not consumed. God called to Moses from the bush, and Moses answered: [...] "Here I am." [...] God told Moses not <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> <b>near,</b> and to take off his shoes, for the place on which he stood was holy ground. God identified as the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, reported having seen the Israelites' affliction and heard their cry, and promised to deliver them from Egypt to Canaan, a land flowing with milk and honey. God told Moses that God was sending Moses to Pharaoh to bring the Israelites out of Egypt, but Moses asked who he was that he should do so. God told Moses that God would be with him, and after he brought them out of Egypt, he would serve God on that mountain. Moses asked God whom he should say sent him to the Israelites, and God said [...] "I Will Be What I Will Be" [...] ( [...] , Ehyeh-Asher-Ehyeh), and told Moses to tell the Israelites that [...] "I Will Be" [...] ( [...] , Ehyeh) sent him. God told Moses to tell the Israelites that the Lord ( [...] , YHVH), the God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, had sent him, and this would be God's Name forever. The fourth reading ( [...] , aliyah) ends here.|$|E

6000|$|... "Or," [...] added Mrs. Wilson, striving <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> <b>nearer</b> <b>to</b> her subject, [...] "with {{a closer}} veil of hypocrisy, wear even an {{affectation}} of principle and moral feeling {{that would seem}} to forbid such a departure from duty in favor of custom." ...|$|R

60|$|Impatiently {{they waited}} for the new-comer to appear, and though he seemed <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> <b>nearer</b> at every shout, his {{progress}} was very slow.

60|$|I now {{sought to}} get speech of my comrades. But so obstreperous was the crowd, {{that it was}} next to impossible.

60|$|Presently {{it seemed}} to her that above the gentle clapper of the waters she could hear a rustle and the scrunching of the fine gravel under {{carefully}} measured footsteps.

60|$|Then {{they began}} <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> <b>near</b> the land, far, however, {{very far from}} {{the place where they}} had {{intended}} to go. Rollo observed that Jonas was looking out very eagerly towards the shore, and he asked him what he was looking for.|$|E
