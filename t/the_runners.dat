5|$|An {{option to}} ride on {{a seat in the}} tenders of the DRR's {{locomotives}} is available upon request at Main Street, U.S.A. Station at the start of each operating day. The option to ride in the DRR's Lilly Belle parlor car is also available upon request at Main Street, U.S.A. Station when a Disneyland employee is available to monitor the passengers aboard it and no heavy rain is falling. The DRR's roundhouse, which cannot normally be viewed by the public, is made available for viewing to participants of specific runDisney events where the race course organized for <b>the</b> <b>runners</b> goes past the facility.|$|E
5|$|In February, Sakanaction {{were named}} {{as one of}} the ten iTunes Japan Sound of 2009 artists: musicians who iTunes Japan staff {{expected}} to make it big in 2009. At Life Music Award 2009, a Tokyo FM competition based on radio DJ nominations, Sakanaction were <b>the</b> <b>runners</b> up for the Best Impact of Life award for most surprising act, however lost to 9mm Parabellum Bullet. In the 2009 CD Shop Awards, the album was chosen {{as one of the}} ten finalists.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fifth}} inning, deGrom allowed a leadoff walk to Alex Gordon and {{subsequent}} single to Alex Rios before Alcides Escobar's RBI single tied the game. Ben Zobrist's groundout moved <b>the</b> <b>runners</b> up and after Lorenzo Cain lined out to center, Eric Hosmer's two-run single put the Royals up 3-1. Kendrys Morales's single moved Hosmer to third and Mike Moustakas's single made it 4-1 Royals.|$|E
50|$|The pitcher may, without limit, {{throw the}} ball to <b>the</b> <b>runner's</b> base. <b>The</b> <b>runner</b> must return to that base or risk being tagged out; but the {{underlying}} strategy is thereby to dissuade <b>the</b> <b>runner</b> from too big a lead-off; that is, to hold <b>the</b> <b>runner</b> on his original base.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Runner</b> is {{a reality}} {{television}} competition, which consists of teams of two ("Chaser Teams") attempting to catch a runner, whose goal is to race across the USA. The race is divided into daily segments, which end when <b>the</b> <b>Runner</b> gets to <b>the</b> Safe Zone or is caught. If <b>the</b> <b>Runner</b> is caught, <b>the</b> Chase Team who caught <b>the</b> <b>Runner</b> is awarded <b>the</b> <b>Runner's</b> bounty, which starts at $15,000 and increases by $15,000 every day. If <b>the</b> <b>Runner</b> {{makes it to the}} end without getting caught, <b>the</b> <b>Runner</b> is awarded $500,000. The viewers are also eligible to win money. Every day, the Chase Teams give out $1,000 in [...] "Chaser Cash" [...] to whomever they deem worthy of it. <b>The</b> <b>Runner</b> also gives out $1,000 daily in [...] "Runner Cash" [...] to whomever they deem worthy.|$|R
50|$|Later, <b>the</b> <b>Runner</b> battled Thanos, {{who sought}} to collect all of the Infinity Gems. Through the Infinity Gems, Thanos {{bypassed}} the Elder's immunity to aging. Thanos changed <b>the</b> <b>Runner</b> to an old man and then reverted him to infancy and took the Space Gem from him. Thanos used <b>the</b> infant <b>Runner</b> as a pawn in his conflict with the Collector; Thanos gave <b>the</b> <b>Runner</b> to <b>the</b> Collector {{in exchange for the}} Reality Gem. When Thanos left, he restored <b>the</b> <b>Runner</b> back to adulthood; the Collector and <b>the</b> <b>Runner</b> then fought each other.|$|R
5|$|The Rangers {{lost to the}} Blue Jays in {{five games}} in the Division Series after {{squandering}} a 2-0 series lead. Hamels received a no-decision in Game 2 {{as he left the}} game tied, but the Rangers won in 14 innings. Hamels started Game 5, and was pulled {{in the bottom of the}} 7th inning while the Rangers were leading 3-2; the Jays subsequently scored 4 runs to win 6-3, and Hamels was charged with the loss as he was responsible for <b>the</b> <b>runners</b> on base.|$|E
5|$|The late-afternoon race {{started at}} the foot of the Capitoline Hill {{staircase}} and finished at the Arch of Constantine, just outside the Colosseum. The course twice passed Piazza di Porta Capena, where the Obelisk of Axum was then located. When <b>the</b> <b>runners</b> passed the Obelisk the first time Abebe Bikila was at the rear of the lead pack, which included, among others, Rhadi Ben Abdesselam of Morocco.|$|E
5|$|He then {{falls asleep}} {{continuing}} {{to play the}} note. A dream sequence of the opening scene of the film Chariots of Fire shows the characters running across a beach, though Mr. Bean dreams he is running with them. He begins to fall behind, until he hails a car to overtake all the others. Now running in front, Bean ensures he wins the race on the beach by tripping one of <b>the</b> <b>runners</b> trying to overtake him, whereupon he crosses the line with elation, and then wakes up. Finding {{that the rest of}} the orchestra have stopped playing while he continued his one recurring note, Bean, with encouragement from Rattle, plays an extended flourish and lastly touches a note that makes a flatulent sound, then stops.|$|E
50|$|Assuming {{that the}} jet {{velocity}} {{is higher than}} <b>the</b> <b>runner</b> velocity, if <b>the</b> water is not to become backed-up in runner, then due to conservation of mass, the mass entering <b>the</b> <b>runner</b> must equal <b>the</b> mass leaving <b>the</b> <b>runner.</b> <b>The</b> fluid {{is assumed to be}} incompressible (an accurate assumption for most liquids). Also it is assumed that the cross-sectional area of the jet is constant. The jet speed remains constant relative to <b>the</b> <b>runner.</b> So as <b>the</b> jet recedes from <b>the</b> <b>runner,</b> <b>the</b> jet velocity relative to <b>the</b> <b>runner</b> is: −(Vi − u) = −Vi + u. In the standard reference frame (relative to the earth), the final velocity is then: Vf = (−Vi + u) + u = −Vi + 2u.|$|R
5000|$|Progressively {{increasing}} {{speed in}} any race allows {{the opportunity to}} implement another strategy that will help increase <b>the</b> <b>runner's</b> speed. This strategy calls for <b>the</b> <b>runner</b> to focus in on the person directly ahead and <b>the</b> <b>runner</b> telling him/herself that he/she will pass them by a certain point. Even without implementing the other strategies, <b>the</b> <b>runner</b> can still pass people as they, <b>the</b> other <b>runners,</b> are slowing down from going out too fast in the beginning.|$|R
5000|$|Similar to a Pickle, or [...] "Rundown" [...] {{in a game}} of baseball, 2 basemen throw a {{ball back}} and forth. A third player who is it remains safely {{touching}} a base, until he/she decides to make a play (run) for the other base. Either of the two basemen must physically tag <b>the</b> <b>runner</b> with <b>the</b> ball in hand to count <b>the</b> <b>runner</b> out. This is done by tossing the ball {{back and forth between the}} basemen, forcing <b>the</b> <b>runner</b> to change direction, while the basemen close the distance to <b>the</b> <b>runner,</b> until either <b>the</b> <b>runner</b> is safe at a base, or successfully tagged. When successfully tagged, <b>the</b> <b>runner</b> and <b>the</b> baseman exchange places, and the game continues.|$|R
5|$|In the women's event, Germany's Silke Kraushaar {{leads the}} medal count with three, {{one of each}} color. Steffi Martin and Sylke Otto—at 36, the oldest female {{individual}} gold medalist at the Winter Games—are the only lugers with two gold medals in their career. Ortrun Enderlein, representing the Unified Team of Germany, {{was the first woman}} to win the singles event in 1964. She {{was on the verge of}} defending her title at the 1968 Grenoble Games, having the best overall time after all the runs, but was disqualified together with fellow countrywomen Anna-Maria Müller (2nd) and Angela Knösel (4th) when it was discovered that <b>the</b> <b>runners</b> in their sleds had been illegally heated before the runs. Müller made up for this by taking the gold medal at the following Games, in Sapporo, Japan.|$|E
5|$|He {{scored a}} {{striking}} {{victory at the}} 2006 IAAF World Road Running Championships in Debrecen, Hungary, finishing the 20km race in 56:01 – a time which was second only to Haile Gebrselassie's world record and was forty seconds faster than the silver medallist Robert Kipchumba. It was first time that an Eritrean had won a major world title in sport. As Zersenay did not possess a strong sprint finish (crucial for success on the track) commentators suggested that a move to the marathon distance seemed an obvious career progression, but he downplayed the idea, stating {{that he would not}} change distances in the near future. He closed the season with a run at the New Year's Eve 10km road race: the San Silvestre Vallecana in Madrid. Zersenay and Eliud Kipchoge were awarded the same time of 26:54, but Kipchoge was announced as the race winner. Although this was faster than Haile Gebrselassie's world record of 27:02 at the time, it was not ratifiable as <b>the</b> <b>runners</b> benefited from the race's downhill circuit.|$|E
5|$|In 1974, {{they won}} the Northern League Cup, beating Ashington 2–1 in the final at Crook. In the summer of 1978, Chris Waddle started playing for the club. In the summer of 1980, while Waddle was working in a sausage factory, he was sold to Newcastle United for the fee of £1,000. Tow Law Town were runners-up in the 1988–89 season, before finally winning the league again in 1994–95, sitting 14 points clear {{at the end of}} the season. They missed out on <b>the</b> <b>runners</b> up spot the {{following}} year on goal difference. Harry Hodgson had long served as Chairman of the club, but stood down at the end of 1995–96, but as of 2011 he still remains a member of the committee. John Flynn took over as Chairman. At the end of 1996–97, Harry Dixon, another long standing official at the club, stood down as treasurer, but stayed on as the club's president. Kevin McCormick took over as treasurer.|$|E
50|$|If <b>the</b> <b>runner</b> breaks {{too soon}} (before the pitcher {{is obliged to}} {{complete}} a pitch), the pitcher may throw to a base rather than pitch, and <b>the</b> <b>runner</b> is usually picked off by being tagged out between the bases. Past this moment, any delay in <b>the</b> <b>runner's</b> break makes {{it more likely that}} the catcher, after receiving the pitch, will be able to throw <b>the</b> <b>runner</b> out at <b>the</b> destination base.|$|R
50|$|Former {{third baseman}} Matt Williams used a {{different}} technique. On {{more than one}} occasion, he asked <b>the</b> <b>runner</b> to step off the base so that Williams could sweep the dirt off it, then tagged out <b>the</b> <b>runner</b> when <b>the</b> <b>runner</b> complied. This worked twice.|$|R
50|$|If <b>the</b> <b>runner</b> slides, <b>the</b> catcher {{will often}} make a {{sweeping}} motion with his glove to quickly tag <b>the</b> <b>runner</b> out. Otherwise, <b>the</b> catcher must brace for impact {{and keep the}} ball in his glove or hand in order to tag <b>the</b> <b>runner</b> out.|$|R
5|$|Somalia {{received}} universality places (a wildcard {{for athletes}} {{who have not}} attained qualification standards) from the International Association of Athletics Federations to send one male and one female athlete to the 2012 Summer Olympics. The two athletes that were selected to represent Somalia at the London Games were Mohamed Hassan Mohamed in the men's 1500 metres and Zamzam Mohamed Farah in the women's 400 metres. Along with the two athletes, the country's delegation was led by chef de mission Omar Barajab. The athletes' training at Mogadishu Stadium and in the city's roads (which was for six days a week) was hampered {{by the death of}} the country's National Olympic Committee (NOC) president Aden Yabarow Wiish in a suicide bombing in April 2012, but their coach Ahmed Ali encouraged <b>the</b> <b>runners</b> not to let the event influence their training. Both competitors were not confirmed until July 2012 because the NOC did not wish to jeopardise their safety by making them targets. Long-distance runner Abdinasir Said Ibrahim had been due to compete but withdrew because of extreme stress caused by unsafe roads which lowered his mental morale. Farah was selected as the flag bearer for both the opening and closing ceremonies.|$|E
5|$|The {{beginning}} {{to the race}} highlighted {{the dominance of the}} Kenyan and Ethiopian runners as they set a high tempo from the outset. By the time the first 5km marker was passed, Australia's Nikki Chapple was the only athlete left in the leading pack to come from outside the two historically strong nations. A few kilometres later, she dropped back from the pack and at the 10km mark five Ethiopians and four Kenyans had a fifteen-second advantage {{on the rest of the}} field. As the race reached the midway point, the temperature began to increase and the heat and humidity reduced the pace of <b>the</b> <b>runners.</b> The conditions took their toll on some of the leaders in this section of the race. Chepchirchir slowed considerably while Meseret Mengistu, Joyce Chepkirui and Fate Tola were the next to gradually lose contact with the front runners. Kiplagat, Dire, Arusei and Feyse Tadese were the sole contenders remaining as the race headed towards the final stages, but Kiplagat and Dire soon left the other two trailing a few minutes later.|$|E
5|$|With Kate {{convicted for}} Pope's murder, Merc plans {{a way for}} Faith to ambush the police convoy {{transporting}} her to prison, and Faith helps to free Kate. She gives Kate her comms unit that she and Merc use and tells her that he will guide her back to his hideout. When Faith returns to the hideout, she finds it in ruins, with Merc dying and Kate recaptured. In his dying words, Merc tells Faith that Kate {{is now at the}} Shard, which contains Mayor Callaghan's office and the servers that run the city's surveillance systems. With Miller's help, Faith is able to enter the Mayor's private offices, and destroys the servers that will unlock the rooftop security door. She gains access to the roof, but Miller is killed. On the roof, she finds Kate held at gunpoint by Jacknife. Jacknife reveals that he too is part of Project Icarus, and {{has been part of the}} plan all along to lure <b>the</b> <b>Runners</b> out of hiding. When Jacknife tries to take Kate onto a waiting helicopter, Faith jumps on before it can leave, knocking Jacknife out of the helicopter to fall to his death but also damaging the helicopter in the process. Faith helps Kate to escape safely from the falling helicopter.|$|E
50|$|A fielder may {{employ the}} hidden ball trick when a runner is on base. Variations {{of the play}} exist: they all involve a fielder holding the ball without <b>the</b> <b>runner's</b> knowledge, waiting for <b>the</b> <b>runner</b> to lead off of his base, and then tagging <b>the</b> <b>runner.</b>|$|R
50|$|Once {{through the}} Honeycomb Maze, <b>the</b> <b>runner</b> raised <b>the</b> visor and entered a small {{briefing}} room. Here, the Lady of the Maze reappeared to give <b>the</b> <b>runner</b> instructions {{on what to}} do inside the Chamber of Knowledge, which <b>the</b> <b>runner</b> entered using one of the two Power Sticks.|$|R
50|$|Once <b>the</b> <b>runner</b> {{had passed}} <b>the</b> Mirror Maze, <b>the</b> <b>runner</b> {{had to find}} two of several Power Sticks that were hidden in the {{mountains}} between the Mirror Maze and the Honeycomb Maze. (Occasionally there was a Power Stick hidden in the Mirror Maze itself.) Once <b>the</b> <b>runner</b> found two, they entered the Honeycomb Maze. In this section, <b>the</b> <b>runner</b> had to lower their visor and rely on the partner to guide them through the network of doors and walls.|$|R
5|$|Jock Stein {{had been}} the manager of Scotland since the {{resignation}} of Ally MacLeod in 1978, and had managed to ensure qualification for the 1982 World Cup in Spain. However, over the period there had been little other success, either in the European Championships, which Scotland had failed to qualify for twice, or the British Home Championship, which had led to criticism leading into the next competition, the 1986 World Cup. As a consequence, Stein was facing significant pressure to ensure qualification for his team for the tournament, given the route that have been provided to Scotland by the qualifying draw. Group 7 {{was one of three}} UEFA qualifying groups with only four teams – in each of these groups, the second placed teams would advance to a play-off round. For the second placed team in Group 7, this meant a two-legged play-off against the winner of the OFC tournament, likely to be Australia, which was seen as a much easier proposition than <b>the</b> <b>runners</b> up in Group 1 and Group 5, who would have to face each other. As a consequence, the defeat to Wales in Glasgow had led to significant criticism directed at Stein, who was aware that failure to get a result against Wales would likely cost him his job. He was not helped by the fact that a number of his senior players, including Graeme Souness (his captain), Kenny Dalglish, Alan Hansen and Steve Archibald would all miss the game through injury or suspension. Stein was also taking diuretics to manage heart failure at the time but had, in the build-up to the game, decided to stop taking them to try and remained focused and negate any potential side-effects the medication might have. Despite his enthusiasm for the job and for football, the strain on Stein, combined with his poor health, had led to him indicating that he would step down after the World Cup Finals in Mexico.|$|E
25|$|For {{the entire}} {{distance}} of the race, thousands line {{the sides of the}} course to cheer <b>the</b> <b>runners</b> on, encourage them, and provide free water and snacks to <b>the</b> <b>runners.</b>|$|E
25|$|A ferocious {{thunderstorm}} {{breaks the}} spell and <b>the</b> <b>runners</b> continue.|$|E
50|$|Inside the Chamber of Knowledge, <b>the</b> <b>runner</b> {{was asked}} three {{different}} {{true or false}} questions by three of the six different guardians. A correct answer caused {{one of the three}} gates blocking the way out to open. If <b>the</b> <b>runner</b> answered incorrectly, <b>the</b> same guardian asked another true or false question. If <b>the</b> <b>runner</b> missed this question, one more true or false question was asked. If <b>the</b> <b>runner</b> missed all three, the gate automatically opened after five seconds. Once all three gates were open, <b>the</b> <b>runner</b> exited <b>the</b> chamber (and the maze itself) by inserting his/her remaining power stick into a holder at the finish line to stop the clock.|$|R
50|$|Obstacles {{along the}} way include Slip Zones which will slow <b>the</b> <b>Runner</b> down if he tries to cross over them, Pitfalls which will break under <b>the</b> <b>Runner's</b> weight and drop him into the holes beneath them, and Crackers which will launch <b>the</b> <b>Runner</b> up into <b>the</b> air and cause him to land on his back. Later rounds also feature Jumbo Tires that bounce towards <b>the</b> <b>Runner,</b> Walls that emerge from the ground before {{receding}} back into it, Cubes that move through particular columns of tiles, Mice that attempt to jump onto <b>the</b> <b>Runner</b> and slow him down, and Chess Knights and Kings that bounce from one tile to another.|$|R
5000|$|... a runner, {{attempting}} a stolen base, is safe because a fielder {{is charged with}} an error on catching the ball, and in {{the judgment of the}} official scorer, <b>the</b> <b>runner</b> would have been out if the ball had been caught. (This official scoring is almost never made; an error is usually only charged if a bad throw or catch allows <b>the</b> <b>runner</b> to take an additional base, e.g., <b>the</b> <b>runner</b> attempts to steal second, the ball goes into the outfield, and <b>the</b> <b>runner</b> takes third as well. In such an instance <b>the</b> <b>runner</b> is credited with a steal of second, with the error accounting for the advance to third.) ...|$|R

25|$|Carousel Productions, the {{organizer}} of Miss Philippines Earth, changed the ranking of <b>the</b> <b>runners</b> up and winners since 2009. The judges selected 10 finalists who competed {{for the top}} five. The top five candidates vied for the grand crown (Miss Philippines Earth) and the four other equal crowns. The remaining five finalists who failed to advance {{in the top five}} served as <b>the</b> <b>runners</b> up of the pageant.|$|E
50|$|The turbine {{geometry}} (nozzle-runner-shaft) assures {{that the}} water jet is effective. The water acts on <b>the</b> <b>runner</b> twice, {{but most of the}} power is transferred on the first pass, when the water enters <b>the</b> <b>runner.</b> Only ⅓ of the power is transferred to <b>the</b> <b>runner</b> when <b>the</b> water is leaving the turbine.|$|R
