40|$|Introduction: This {{study was}} {{performed}} to address the pathological roles of the skeletal renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in <b>type</b> <b>1</b> diabetes-induced <b>osteoporosis</b> {{and the effects of}} the angiotensin II <b>type</b> <b>1</b> receptor blocker losartan on bones in diabetic mice. Materials and methods: Bone histomorphology was detected by H&E staining, Safranin O staining and X-ray radiography. Micro-CT was performed for the analysis of bone parameters. Gene and protein expression were determined by RT-PCR and immunoblotting. Results: <b>Type</b> <b>1</b> diabetic mice displayed osteopenia phenotype, and losartan treatment had no osteoprotective effects on diabetic mice as shown by the reduction of bone mineral density and microarchitectural parameters at the proximal metaphysis of the tibia. The mRNA expression of AGT, renin receptor and ACE, and protein expression of renin and AT 1 R were markedly up-regulated in the bones of vehicle-treated diabetic mice compared to those of non-diabetic mice. The treatment with losartan further significantly increased the expression of AGT, renin, angiotensin II and AT 1 R, and reduced the expression of AT 2 R receptor as compared to those of diabetic mice. Conclusion: Local bone RAS functionally {{played a role in the}} development of <b>type</b> <b>1</b> diabetic <b>osteoporosis,</b> and losartan had no bone-sparing function in diabetes mice because of enhance skeletal RAS activity.

30|$|Of the {{classical}} therapeutic methods currently available to treat non-unions, amputation is {{the treatment of}} last resort [11]. Even when other treatment options are available, the choice is complex since at a more phenomenological level the outcome of bone healing depends on many mechanical and biological risk factors, such as excess motion, the interfragmentary gap size [12], the type of fracture [12 – 14], the particular bone [11], location of the trauma within the bone [11], loss of blood supply [15]. Additional injuries such as severe periosteal and soft-tissue trauma [13, 14] {{as well as other}} preexisting patients risk factors including old age [16], cachexia and malnutrition [17], immune compromise [18], genetic disorders (e.g. neurofibromatosis <b>type</b> <b>1</b> [19]), <b>osteoporosis</b> [20], anticoagulants [21], smoking [22] and anti-inflammatory agents [23], may also compromise the optimal treatment.|$|R
40|$|In {{diabetic}} patients, {{the risk}} of fracture is high because of im-paired bone formation. However, {{the details of the}} mechanisms in the development of diabetic osteoporosis remain unclear. In the current study, we investigated the role of plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI) - 1 in the pathogenesis of <b>type</b> <b>1</b> diabetic <b>osteoporosis</b> by using PAI- 1 –deficient mice. Quantitative com-puted tomography analysis showed that PAI- 1 deficiency pro-tected against streptozotocin-induced bone loss in female mice but not in male mice.

40|$|<b>Type</b> <b>1</b> {{diabetic}} <b>osteoporosis</b> {{results from}} impaired osteoblast activity and death. Therefore, anti‐resorptive treatments may not effectively treat bone loss in this patient population. Intermittent parathyroid hormone (PTH) treatment stimulates bone remodeling and increases bone density in healthy subjects. However, PTH effects {{may be limited}} in patients with diseases that interfere with its signaling. Here, we examined the ability of 8 and 40 [*]µg/kg intermittent PTH to counteract diabetic bone loss. PTH treatment reduced fat pad mass and blood glucose levels in non‐diabetic PTH‐treated mice, consistent with PTH‐affecting glucose homeostasis. However, PTH treatment did not significantly affect general body parameters, including the blood glucose levels, of <b>type</b> <b>1</b> diabetic mice. We found that the high dose of PTH significantly increased tibial trabecular bone density parameters in control and diabetic mice, and the lower dose elevated trabecular bone parameters in diabetic mice. The increased bone density was due to increased mineral apposition and osteoblast surface, {{all of which are}} defective in <b>type</b> <b>1</b> diabetes. PTH treatment suppressed osteoblast apoptosis in diabetic bone, which could further contribute to the bone‐enhancing effects. In addition, PTH treatment (40 [*]µg/kg) reversed preexisting bone loss from diabetes. We conclude that intermittent PTH may increase <b>type</b> <b>1</b> diabetic trabecular bone volume through its anabolic effects on osteoblasts. J. Cell.

40|$|AbstractHuman T-cell leukemia virus <b>type</b> <b>1</b> (HTLV- 1) {{infection}} is endemic in Japan and several countries in South America, Caribbean and Africa. Endocrine and metabolic disorders have been variably {{reported to be}} associated with human T-cell leukemia virus <b>type</b> <b>1</b> (HTLV- 1) infection. Therefore, the aim of this article was to critically evaluate the current knowledge of the endocrine and metabolic disorders associated with HTLV- 1 infection. The literature search used PubMed, Web of Science, and LILACS databases in the past 10 years, utilizing, in various combinations, the following keywords: HTLV- 1, adult T-cell leukemia, diabetes mellitus, GLUT- <b>1,</b> <b>osteoporosis,</b> hypercalcemia, autoimmune thyroid disorders, diabetes insipidus, inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion; pseudohypoparathyroidism; pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism. The proven endocrine manifestations of the HTLV- 1 infection are calcium disorders which occur in some patients with acute HTLV- 1 /Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma. The few reports about thyroid, parathyroid, antidiuretic hormone and diabetes mellitus are insufficient to prove a causal association with HTLV- 1 infection. The evidence for an association between endocrine disorders and HTLV- 1 infection in general, and in asymptomatic patients is lacking. Given all these uncertainties, the endocrine expression of the HTLV- 1 infection composes a promising research line for understanding the pathophysiology of this infection...|$|R

This study measured the effects of rhBMP- 2 treatment on osteogenesis by observing the dose-dependent effect of localized delivery of rhBMP- 2 on biomechanical parameters of bone using a hydroxyapatite/tri-calcium phosphate (HA/TCP) carrier in a T <b>1</b> DM-related <b>osteoporosis</b> animal model.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{evaluate}} {{the need for}} a randomised study of treatment of spinal osteoporosis with human parathyroid peptide in the secondary prevention of crush fractures; to study the effect of human parathyroid hormone peptide 1 - 34 plus sex hormones on vertebral body cancellous bone; and, separately, to determine the effect of relatively low doses of sodium fluoride plus calcium on spinal bone mineral density. DESIGN [...] Open study of patients with primary or postmenopausal osteoporosis. All patients had serial bone densitometry of the spine by quantitative computed tomography and dual photon absorptiometry as well as serial densitometry of the radial midshaft (cortical) and radial distal (trabecular) bone by quantitative computed tomography. Changes in the spinal bone not forming the spongiosa of the vertebral bodies ("cortical" bone) were determined from {{the difference between the two}} axial measurements, after correction to the same units of measurement. SETTING [...] Northwick Park Hospital and Medical Research Council Clinical Research Centre. PATIENTS [...] 24 Patients who fulfilled the conventional criteria for <b>type</b> <b>1</b> (vertebral) <b>osteoporosis</b> not secondary to recognised causes other than sex hormone deficiency and with at least one crush or wedge vertebral fracture and a spinal bone density (quantitative computed tomography) less than 80 mg/cm 3 or two or more fractures. Twelve patients received human parathyroid peptide and 12 sodium fluoride; they were not randomised. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Trends in axial and peripheral bone mass values determined by linear, time dependent regression analyses. RESULTS [...] The patients receiving the peptide showed a substantial increase in vertebral spongiosa (mean 25. 6 mg/cm 2 two years after the start of treatment). No significant changes were seen in spinal cortical or radial bone density. The patients receiving sodium fluoride showed roughly equal increases in cancellous and cortical bone over the same period (mean increase in vertebral spongiosa 16. 1 mg/cm 3). No significant changes were seen in radial bone. CONCLUSIONS [...] Treatment of postmenopausal women with human parathyroid peptide selectively increases spinal cancellous bone density by amounts that may prove useful in secondary prevention. Peptide treatment should now be tested in a randomised study in which the important end point is prevention of fractures as the usefulness of sodium fluoride in this context is doubtful...|$|R

40|$|Skeletal {{homeostasis}} {{is dependent}} upon the delicate balance between bone formation and bone resorption. Bone loss often {{occurs as a result}} of an imbalance between bone resorption and bone formation. <b>1</b> <b>Osteoporosis,</b> a chronic and slowly developing condition, is characterized by a reduction of bone mass and micro-architectural integrity, making patients more susceptible to fractures. <b>1</b> <b>Osteoporosis</b> generally occurs with increasing age and in post-menopausal women. Paget’s disease, a localized disorder marked by a rapid increase in bone turnover, results in woven (rather than lamellar) bone, which is susceptible to fracture. 2 The pathogenesis of osteoporosis, fragility fractures and metabolic bone disease is associated with many factors: genetic, environmental, biomechanical, chronic disease and the effects of endogenous hormones. 1 Bone turnover markers represent these events as either a) enzymes of bone formation and resorption; or b) products of bone matrix metabolism (primarily <b>type</b> I collagen). <b>1</b> Osteocalcin (OC), the most abundant non-collagenous protein in bone which comprises 1 - 2 % of the total bone protein, is an excellent marker of bone formation; 2, 3 serum OC concentrations have a strong correlation with bone formation rates. 4 Bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (bone ALP) is a useful marker of active bone formation; it has only 3 - 5 % cross-reactivity with liver-specific alkaline phosphatase. 5 Deoxypyridinolines (DPD), the natural cross-linked amino acids of the collagen fibrils, are excreted in urine and indicate active bone resorption. 4, 6 N-telopeptides (NTX-I), the amino-terminal cross-linked pyridinolines, are another useful measure of bone resorption. 3 The “s...|$|R

Double immunolabeling with antibodies to cytokeratin 14 and neurofibromatosis <b>type</b> <b>1</b> protein suggested an association of intermediate type cytoskeleton and neurofibromatosis <b>type</b> <b>1</b> protein. The presence of neurofibromatosis <b>type</b> <b>1</b> protein in cell preparations treated with cytoskeletal buffer indicated a high affinity interaction between intermediate filaments and neurofibromatosis <b>type</b> <b>1</b> protein. Further studies utilizing double immunolabelings revealed that the intense neurofibromatosis <b>type</b> <b>1</b> tumor suppressor signal on intermediate filaments was temporally limited to the period in keratinocyte differentiation in which the formation of desmosomes takes place.

40|$|<b>Type</b> <b>1</b> fimbriae and flagella {{have been}} {{previously}} shown {{to contribute to}} the virulence of uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) within the urinary tract. In this study, the relationship between motility and <b>type</b> <b>1</b> fimbrial expression was tested for UPEC strain CFT 073 by examining the phenotypic effect of fimbrial expression on motility and the effect that induction of motility has on <b>type</b> <b>1</b> fimbrial expression. While constitutive expression of <b>type</b> <b>1</b> fimbriae resulted in a significant decrease in motility and flagellin expression (P < 0. 0001), a loss of <b>type</b> <b>1</b> fimbrial expression did not result in increased motility. Additionally, hypermotility and flagellar gene over- and underexpression were not observed to affect the expression of <b>type</b> <b>1</b> fimbriae. Hence, it appeared that the relationship between <b>type</b> <b>1</b> fimbrial expression and motility is unidirectional, where the overexpression of <b>type</b> <b>1</b> fimbriae dramatically affects motility and flagellum expression but not vice versa. Moreover, the constitutive expression of <b>type</b> <b>1</b> fimbriae in UPEC cystitis isolate F 11 and the laboratory strain E. coli K- 12 MG 1655 also resulted in decreased motility, suggesting that this phenomenon is not specific to CFT 073 or UPEC in general. Lastly, by analyzing the repression of motility caused by constitutive <b>type</b> <b>1</b> fimbrial expression, it was concluded that the synthesis and presence of <b>type</b> <b>1</b> fimbriae at the bacterial surface is only partially responsible for the repression of motility, as evidenced by the partial restoration of motility in the CFT 073 fim L-ON ΔfimAICDFGH mutant. Altogether, these data provide further insight into the complex interplay between <b>type</b> <b>1</b> fimbrial expression and flagellum-mediated motility...|$|R

All subjects were interviewed regarding their sexual practices and tested for HIV <b>type</b> <b>1.</b> Fifty-seven of the 187 sexual partners were infected with HIV <b>type</b> <b>1.</b> The strongest risk factor for HIV <b>type</b> <b>1</b> infection among these partners was unprotected receptive anal intercourse with a known HIV <b>type</b> <b>1</b> -infected index subject (odds ratio (OR) = 7. 2, 95 % confidence interval (Cl) 3. 1 - 16. 3). The risk of unprotected receptive anal intercourse was highest among partners of HIV-infected index subjects who had a T lymphocyte subset ratio of 0. 50 or less (OR = 11. 4, 95 % Cl 3. 0 - 43. 5) compared with partners of HIV <b>type</b> <b>1</b> -infected index subjects with a T cell ratio of greater than 0. 50 (OR = 5. 3, 95 % Cl 1. 9 - 15. 2).

40|$|OBJECTIVE—The {{incidence}} of <b>type</b> <b>1</b> diabetes is increasing. Delivery by cesarean section {{is also more}} prevalent, and {{it is suggested that}} cesarean section is associated with <b>type</b> <b>1</b> diabetes risk. We examine associations between cesarean delivery, islet autoimmunity and <b>type</b> <b>1</b> diabetes, and genes involved in <b>type</b> <b>1</b> diabetes susceptibility. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS—Cesarean section was examined as a risk factor in 1, 650 children born to a parent with <b>type</b> <b>1</b> diabetes and followed from birth for the development of islet autoantibodies and <b>type</b> <b>1</b> diabetes. RESULTS—Children delivered by cesarean section (n = 495) had more than twofold higher risk for <b>type</b> <b>1</b> diabetes than children born by vaginal delivery (hazard ratio [HR] 2. 5; 95 % CI 1. 4 – 4. 3; P = 0. 001).

40|$|Glycogen {{storage disease}} (GSD) <b>type</b> <b>1,</b> {{which is caused}} by the {{deficiency}} of glucose- 6 -phosphatase (G 6 Pase), is an autosomal recessive disease with heterogenous symptoms. Two models of G 6 Pase catalysis have been proposed to explain the observed heterogeneities. The translocase-catalytic unit model proposes that five GSD <b>type</b> <b>1</b> subgroups exist which correspond to defects in the G 6 Pase catalytic unit (1 a), a stabilizing protein (1 aSP), the glucose- 6 -P (1 b), phosphate/pyrophosphate (1 c), and glucose (1 d) translocases. Conversely, the conformation-substrate-transport model suggests that G 6 Pase is a single multifunctional membrane channel protein possessing both catalytic and substrate (or product) transport activities. We have recently demonstrated that mutations in the G 6 Pase catalytic unit cause GSD <b>type</b> <b>1</b> a. To elucidate whether mutations in the G 6 Pase gene are responsible for other GSD <b>type</b> <b>1</b> subgroups, we characterized the G 6 Pase gene of GSD <b>type</b> <b>1</b> b, 1 c, and 1 aSP patients. Our results show that the G 6 Pase gene of GSD <b>type</b> <b>1</b> b and 1 c patients is normal, consistent with the translocase-catalytic unit model of G 6 Pase catalysis. However, a mutation in exon 2 that converts an Arg at codon 83 to a Cys (R 83 C) was identified in both G 6 Pase alleles of the <b>type</b> <b>1</b> aSP patient. The R 83 C mutation was also demonstrated in one homozygous and five heterogenous GSD <b>type</b> <b>1</b> a patients, indicating that <b>type</b> <b>1</b> aSP is a misclassification of GSD <b>type</b> <b>1</b> a. We have also analyzed the G 6 Pase gene of seven additional <b>type</b> <b>1</b> a patients and uncovered two new mutations that cause GSD <b>type</b> <b>1</b> a...|$|R
