Sometimes, {{the most visible}} life sign is the spines, which attach to ball-and-socket joints and can point in any direction. In most urchins, touch elicits a prompt reaction from the spines, which converge toward the <b>touch</b> <b>point.</b> Sea urchins have no visible eyes, legs, or means of propulsion, but can move freely over hard surfaces using adhesive tube feet, working {{in conjunction with the}} spines. Regular sea urchins don't have any favourite walking direction.|$|E

50|$|During a 2009 {{study at}} Korea Electronics Technology Institute, a virtual touch screen system was built using the <b>touch</b> <b>point</b> {{tracking}} technique {{based on the}} time of flight (TOF) camera and the Kalman filter. To address the widespread problem in conventional virtual touch screen systems (i.e. responding sensitively to even the slightest hand movement and failing to recognize the <b>touch</b> <b>point</b> accurately), the study had applied the Kalman filter tracking technique to predict and track the <b>touch</b> <b>point</b> consecutively. Being forecast and recognized, the predicted <b>touch</b> <b>point</b> was bound to exist all the time, but an abrupt movement of <b>touch</b> <b>point</b> was likely to be recognized only insensitively.

40|$|The {{appearance}} of <b>touch</b> <b>points</b> in state constrained optimal control problems with general vector-valued control is studied. Under {{the assumption that}} the Hamiltonian is regular, <b>touch</b> <b>points</b> for first-order state inequalities are shown to exist only under very special conditions.

40|$|Energy band {{structure}} of the bilayer graphene superlattices with zero-averaged periodic δ-function potentials are studied within the four-band continuum model. Using the transfer matrix method, studies are mainly focused on examining the <b>touching</b> <b>points</b> between adjacent minibands. For the zero-energy <b>touching</b> <b>points</b> the dispersion relation derived shows the Dirac-like double-cone shape with the group velocity which is periodic in the potential strength P with the period of π and becomes anisotropic at relatively large P. From the finite-energy <b>touching</b> <b>points</b> we have identified those located at zero wave-number. It was shown that for these finite-energy <b>touching</b> <b>points</b> the dispersion is direction-dependent {{in the sense that}} it is linear or parabolic in the direction parallel or perpendicular to the superlattice direction, respectively. We have also calculated the density of states and the conductivity that demonstrate a manifestation of the <b>touching</b> <b>points</b> of interest. Comment: Submitted to JPC...|$|R

5000|$|Television {{advertising}} is a visual <b>touch</b> <b>point</b> that companies {{pay for the}} audience to see almost anywhere, their home, waiting area, malls, and any other place televisions could be available. This <b>touch</b> <b>point</b> {{has a very strong}} effect on the audience that for some it could be equivalent of a salesperson (Fill, et al.,2013). Television advertisement can be highly captive and adsorbent. It has the advantages of Multi-sensory appeal; sound, music, dialogue, movement, photos, written scripture, product and so on ("Television advertising pros and cons" [...] n.d.). These high-impact visuals create a perfect brand image in audience's mind (Fill et al.,2013). Television advertisement is excellent paid <b>touch</b> <b>point</b> for mass marketing. It reaches way more audience than newspaper, magazine or radios ("Television advertising pros and cons" [...] n.d.). These days, companies can choose a target market segment not only for the specific audience demographically but also geographically; specific local areas. (Leigh, n.d.). This is a huge advantage of Television advertisement. But when it comes to disadvantages for this paid touch pint there is long list too. First of all, it is the most expensive paid <b>touch</b> <b>point</b> a company can choose. It finishes the advertisement budgets of small businesses really quickly ("Television advertising pros and cons" [...] n.d.). Initial production cast for the commercial is also very high (Fill, et al.,2013). It includes paying writers, actors, film industry, advertisement agency and soon ("Television advertising pros and cons" [...] n.d.). Second biggest problem with this paid <b>touch</b> <b>point</b> is that it is very short lived. Indeed, some seconds. Multiple studies also show that most audience can't recall the commercials they see on T.V (Fill, et al., 2013). This is also because during a commercial break audience are shown heaps of different commercial messages. Regardless of all these disadvantages many big companies, with big budgets, prefer this paid <b>touch</b> <b>point</b> in order to target mass audience ("Television advertising pros and cons" [...] n.d.).|$|E
