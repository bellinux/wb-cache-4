5|$|Regarding public housing, Tufaro {{called for}} renovations rather than {{demolishing}} vacant buildings, which drew criticism, as Housing Commissioner Daniel P.

O'Malley promised to enforce provisions of the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977, which require banks to invest in poor neighborhoods. Tufaro further proposed a plan for school vouchers and to drug test students, which drew opposition from the Baltimore <b>Teachers</b> <b>Union</b> and from O'Malley, who favored expanding pre-kindergarten and after-school programs, while making summer school mandatory. When discussing the problem of HIV/AIDS in Baltimore, which disproportionately affects African Americans, both O'Malley and Tufaro promised to continue the city's needle exchange program.|$|E
5|$|Schools {{have been}} the center of {{controversy}} over both the anthem and the national flag. The Tokyo Board of Education {{requires the use of}} both the anthem and flag at events under their jurisdiction. The order requires school teachers to respect both symbols or risk losing their jobs. Some have protested that such rules violate the Constitution of Japan, but the Board has argued that since schools are government agencies, their employees have an obligation to teach their students how to be good Japanese citizens. As a sign of protest, schools refused to display the Hinomaru at school graduations and some parents ripped down the flag. Teachers have unsuccessfully brought criminal complaints against Tokyo Governor Shintarō Ishihara and senior officials for ordering teachers to honor the Hinomaru and Kimigayo. After earlier opposition, the Japan <b>Teachers</b> <b>Union</b> accepts the use of both the flag and anthem; the smaller All Japan Teachers and Staffs Union still opposes both symbols and their use inside the school system.|$|E
40|$|While {{traditional}} {{debates about}} <b>teacher</b> <b>unions</b> {{have focused on}} their dual roles (industrial and professional), this report suggests that such duality is outdated, {{and it is important}} to recognize that <b>teacher</b> <b>unions</b> in North America now focus on a multiplicity of areas. To understand them, it is necessary to analyze the range of <b>teacher</b> <b>union</b> focuses, understand the nature and extent of <b>teacher</b> <b>union</b> focuses, and evaluate the utility of each <b>teacher</b> <b>union</b> focus. This report examines five directions that <b>teacher</b> <b>unions</b> should consider and discuss, each of which is derived from analysis of the literature. They include: <b>teacher</b> <b>unions</b> should reduce their level of engagement in reactive stances, especially with governments and the media; the professional focus on <b>teacher</b> <b>unions</b> benefits from collaboration with external groups and organizations, and this collaboration should be increased; the professional focus of <b>teacher</b> <b>unions</b> in North America has a subordinate and an acquiescent place in union structures, an...|$|R
40|$|What factors affect student performance? Research {{before the}} 1980 s {{focused on the}} effects of student {{background}} and socioeconomic status on educational performance. More recent studies have begun to focus on more complex links—particularly that of the role of <b>teachers</b> <b>unions</b> in public education. This study theoretically focuses on the bureaucratization of public schools and one contributor to bureaucratization is claimed to be <b>teachers</b> <b>unions.</b> This study, therefore, assesses the role of <b>teacher</b> <b>unions</b> in the bureaucratization of public schools by observing the relationship between <b>teacher</b> <b>unions</b> and educational performance. I find no statistical significance in this relationship and also conflicting directions of impact, depending on which measure of unionization is used. These results help explain major discrepancies in previous studies and they contest previous thinking regarding which areas of student learning are most affected by unionization. I argue in favor of an alternate framework to assess the role of <b>teachers</b> <b>unions</b> in education—particularly changing the unit of analysis to the district level. Lastly, the role of <b>teachers</b> <b>unions</b> in increasing bureaucratization is not supported by these results. Instead, these results arguably suggest that <b>teachers</b> <b>unions</b> effectively separate their rent-seeking quality from their role as educators...|$|R

On August 8, 2012, the CTU voted 90% to authorize a strike. On September 10, the CTU began a strike after CTU President Lewis declared that negotiations with the city were not succeeding. On September 14, the CTU reached a tentative agreement with the city which included preferences for teachers who have been laid off due to a school closing to be hired in another school and student test scores having less of a role in teacher evaluations than the city had originally planned. This tentative agreement did not hold, and the strike continued, after which Emanuel announced his intention to seek a legal injunction, forcing teachers back to work. On September 17, Emanuel's efforts to end the strike stalled as the walkout went into the second week. Delegates from the CTU voted to end the strike on September 18, 2012, and students began their return to the schools the following day.|$|E

40|$|This {{study is}} based on a need for <b>teacher</b> <b>union</b> {{involvement}} in the management of schools to enhance effective teaching and efficient learning. The rationale behind it was to disclose the current perceptions of school managers concerning <b>teacher</b> <b>union</b> involvement in the management of schools in the Vryheid region, with a view to determining the extent to which their perceptions of <b>teacher</b> <b>unions</b> could be positively influenced to allow for proper consultative school management as well as active participation of <b>teacher</b> <b>union</b> members in the decision-making process. The study revealed that the school managers' perceptions and attitudes are central to <b>teacher</b> <b>union</b> involvement in the management of schools. If negative, no effective participatory school management can materialise. The role of the perceptions and attitudes of school managers in the realisation of the goal of participative school management is indispensable.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{ingrained}} into the American consciousness that {{our public schools}} are failing and our students are underachieving. This is something we all know. What is less clear is why American schools are failing. Time and time again, we come back to teachers, who {{have been identified as}} the single greatest factor in determining the success of the student. Teachers can make the {{difference in the lives of}} students and help secure our economic future. <b>Teachers</b> <b>unions</b> speak for these teachers, thus, in our search for a scapegoat, <b>teachers</b> <b>unions</b> often rank at the top. Right or wrong, it is a serious accusation to say that <b>teachers</b> <b>unions</b> are responsible for the failure of the American education system. Teachers, and consequently <b>teachers</b> <b>unions,</b> have the power to greatly impact education reform. After assessing the state of education in the United States and establishing teachers unions’ role in the bigger picture of education, I will first explore the source of <b>teachers</b> <b>unions</b> political power: their large membership and their money. <b>Teachers</b> <b>unions</b> are among the largest unions in the country and the NEA (National Education Association), specifically, is the highest political contributor of all public sector unions. To assess their political influence, I will show where and how they use their money with the intention of evaluating whether or not they overstep their boundaries as a typical labor union. The next important variable to consider when evaluating the impact of <b>teachers</b> <b>unions</b> is their classification as a public sector union. Private and public sector unions operate under different sets of laws and thus have different rules and strategies for collective bargaining. I will examine how their public sector status impacts their influence on hotly contested education reform issues, such as teacher performance pay, teacher evaluations based on student achievement, school vouchers, and charter schools. What makes <b>teachers</b> <b>unions</b> different from other labor unions? And do these differences give <b>teachers</b> <b>unions</b> a detrimental amount of control over education reform...|$|R
