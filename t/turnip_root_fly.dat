Both the effects on egg laying, and the effect of natural enemies was studied.

If these benefits are realized they can improve the sustainability of the system, as cycling, diversity, stability and capacity are enhanced. These changes bring the system to more closely resemble natural systems. Within three experimental years, hairy vetch (Vicia villosa Roth.), fall rye (Secale cereale L.), yellow sweet clover (Melilotus officinalis L.) and white clover (Trifolium repens L.) were grown as cover crops with cauliflower (Brassica oleracea L. var. botrytis), and compared to monoculture cauliflower. In {{an effort to reduce}} competition between the cauliflower and cover crops, the cover crops were either mowed or rototilled prior to transplanting the cauliflower. The effects of the cover crops on weeds, allelopathy, cabbage and turnip root flies (Delia radicum L. and D. floralis Fall.), beneficial arthropods and cauliflower yield were investigated. Monoculture and rototilled hairy vetch plots showed the highest number of weeds throughout the experiment. Mowed plots showed the lowest weed densities.

40|$|The <b>turnip</b> <b>root</b> <b>fly</b> (Delia floralis) is a pest insect in the {{northern}} temperate regions of the world. If uncontrolled, it can cause severe problems {{in the production of}} brassica crops. This thesis examines how intercropping of cabbage (Brassica oleracea) and red clover (Trifolium pratense) affects the different life cycle stages of D. floralis. Such knowledge about the mechanisms involved is needed for developing intercropping systems with optimal pest reduction. A field trial was performed in Umeå, northern Sweden (63 º 45 ’N; 20 º 15 ’E), to study the effects of intercropping on D. floralis oviposition behaviour, and the impact of predators and parasitoids on D. floralis in the field. Intercropping was found to reduce D. floralis oviposition compared with monoculture. Furthermore, analysis of the spatial distribution of eggs within plots showed that the difference in egg numbers was greatest close to the border between the cultivation systems. This indicates that the effect of intercropping can be enhanced if D. floralis is provided with an alternative oviposition site. Natural enemies, in this case mainly predators, significantly reduced the final pupal numbers of D. floralis but this effect did not differ between the cultivation systems. However, the study showed {{that it is possible to}} retain the predation pressure in intercropped systems despite lower predator activity-densities and D. floralis egg numbers. A greenhouse experiment was performed to investigate effects of intercropping on development of D. floralis at different larval and intercropping densities and to analyse different aspects of host plant quality in the same system. It was found that D. floralis pupal weight decreased in response to both intercropping and larval density. This impaired larval development is likely to be explained by changes in host plant quality, which included decreased biomass, lower root nitrogen levels, higher root fibre content and altered glucosinolate concentrations. Information on plant responses to herbivory in competitive plant systems can be valuable in identifying quality aspects that are negative for insect development, which may further improve pest insect regulation in these systems...|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanism}} of Cr(VI) -induced toxicity in {{plants and animals}} has been assessed for mitochondrial bioenergetics and membrane damage in <b>turnip</b> <b>root</b> and rat liver mitochondria. By using succinate as the respiratory substrate, ADP/O and respiratory control ratio (RCR) were depressed {{as a function of}} Cr(VI) concentration. State 3 and uncoupled respiration were also depressed by Cr(VI). Rat mitochondria revealed a higher sensitivity to Cr(VI), as compared to turnip mitochondria. Rat mitochondrial state 4 respiration rate triplicated in contrast to negligible stimulation of turnip state 4 respiration. Chromium(VI) inhibited the activity of the NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I) from rat liver mitochondria and succinate-dehydrogenases (complex II) from plant and animal mitochondria. In rat liver mitochondria, complex I was more sensitive to Cr(VI) than complex II. The activity of cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV) was not sensitive to Cr(VI). Unique for plant mitochondria, exogenous NADH uncoupled respiration was unaffected by Cr(VI), indicating that the NADH dehydrogenase of the outer leaflet of the plant inner membrane, in addition to complexes III and IV, were insensitive to Cr(VI). The ATPase activity (complex V) was stimulated in rat liver mitochondria, but inhibited in <b>turnip</b> <b>root</b> mitochondria. In both, turnip and rat mitochondria, Cr(VI) depressed mitochondrial succinate-dependent transmembrane potential (Deltapsi) and phosphorylation efficiency, but it neither affected mitochondrial membrane permeabilization to protons (H+) nor induced membrane lipid peroxidation. However, Cr(VI) induced mitochondrial membrane permeabilization to K+, an effect that was more pronounced in <b>turnip</b> <b>root</b> than in rat liver mitochondria. In conclusion, Cr(VI) -induced perturbations of mitochondrial bioenergetics compromises energy-dependent biochemical processes and, therefore, may contribute to the basal mechanism underlying its toxic effects in plant and animal cells. © 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

There was a significant reduction in cabbage <b>root</b> <b>fly</b> damage in fenced plots whereas no such effect could be found with carrot rust fly. The structure of the overhang {{at the top of the}} fence and the mobility of this particular species may be important elements to consider in fence design. The length of the overhang also seemed to be important for cabbage <b>root</b> <b>fly</b> (Delia radicum) control, as a statistically significant treatment effect was observed only when the overhang was 35 cm long. Using radish as a test crop, the fences reduced damage by 55 % in the second year of the trial.

40|$|Since 2007 Applied Plant Research (PPO) investigates {{whether the}} carrot <b>root</b> <b>fly</b> (Psila rosae) can be disorientated by {{applying}} strong smelling oils. A mature carrot <b>root</b> <b>fly</b> {{can find a}} carrot field by smell. The {{question is whether the}} smell of carrots may be masked by strong smelling oils so that the carrot <b>root</b> <b>fly</b> can not find the carrot plants. In 2008 we found an indication that strong smelling oil can reduce onion <b>root</b> <b>fly</b> damage. In the untreated plot 7 % of the roots were affected by the carrot <b>root</b> <b>fly</b> and in the treated plot (masked by strong smelling oil) 1 % of the roots were affected. In 2009 on 6 carrot fields and one root parsley field demonstrations were created by Dutch organic farmers to reduce carrot fly damage. In all the 6 carrot fields the <b>root</b> <b>fly</b> damage was too little to determine differences. The maximum percentage of infected carrot roots was below 3 %. As a result, the effect of oregano-oil could not be determined. In the parsley root field damage was sufficiently high to see effects of the oil treatment. In the patch protected by onion oil 1. 5 % of the roots were affected. At a distance of 150 m from this patch no infected roods were found. At a distance of 270 m from the patch 11. 5 % of the roots were affected. The oils used have a natural origin (extracted from plants). The method is selective because only insects reacting on the carrot smell are affected. They have more difficulty in finding carrot fields, or can not find them at all. If this method functions well, it can be used in organic and conventional cultivation of carrots...|$|R

D. floralis can cause severe economical and production damage to Brassica crops if left uncontrolled. The main objective of this thesis was to test if pellets with cyanobacteria have a repellent effect on D. floralis and comparing its effect to another product with known effect, garlic granules (Ecospray Ltd, UK). If by chance the pellets themselves have an effect, they were added as a treatment. Field trials were performed in Ås, Norway to investigate whether cyanobacteria or garlic have a repellent effect on D. floralis. None of the treatments {{reduced the number of}} eggs D. floralis laid. Wind tunnel trials were performed at NIBIO, Ås, to see if the treatments had repellent effect in a more controlled environment. Adult females of D. floralis had 10 minutes in the wind tunnel, exposed to the same materials as in the field. No {{significant differences were found between}} treatments in the wind tunnel. GC-EAD trials were performed at NIBIO to see if the treatments induced any response on the antennae of D. floralis. Headspace was collected from; cyanobacteria, garlic, pellets with cyanobacteria and pellets without cyanobacteria. Samples were scanned with GCMS as to show which volatiles were present. For every trial, a new antenna was taken from D. floralis females > 7 days of age. There were no repeated antennal responses to volatiles from; pure cyanobacteria, pellets with cyanobacteria or pellets without. 3 different antennae showed responses to the same volatiles of garlic; Allyl disulfide, Allyl trisulfide, 3 -vinyl- 1, 2 -dithiacyclohex- 4 -ene and Undecyl acetate (ISTD). The GCMS results from the samples show, that in the process of making pellets with cyanobacteria some volatiles disappear. We can conclude from all the results that pellets with cyanobacteria have no repellent effect on D. floralis females...|$|E

The post-alighting behaviour exhibited by D. radicum and D. floralis infers that oviposition site selection is primarily based upon positive stimuli present on the leaf surface. Ranking of four genotypes of plants for antixenotic resistance to oviposition by D. radicum and D. jloralis {{was found to be}} the same for both fly species, tested in the laboratory (swede cv Doon Major, most susceptible; kale cv Fribor, most resistant) and varied x 80 (D. floralis) and x 5 (D. radicum). Field experiments showed that oviposition (which was dominated by D. radicum) varied x 2 between plant genotypes (swede cv Doon Major, most susceptible; swede cv GRL aga, most resistant). Testing of Brassica leaf surface extracts, applied to surrogate plants, indicated that leaf surface chemicals strongly influence the site of oviposition of D. floralis. Methanol soluble polar compounds are the most stimulatory element for D. floralis and a fraction which contained aliphatic glucosinolates stimulated oviposition strongly although glucosinolates were not the primary oviposition stimulant. Collaborative experiments indicate that "CIF" (cabbage identification factor) is probably present in this fraction. The concentrations of Brassica root sugars are generally reduced by the damage of both D. radicum and D. floralis and appear to influence larval development. The percentages of plant fibre and lignin in the roots of Brassicas rise following the damage of D. floralis. The concentrations of individual glucosinolates in Brassica roots arc radically altered by the damage of D. floralis and D. radicum. D. floralis damage resulted in a rise in the concentration of aromatic glucosinolates and a fall in the concentration of aliphatic glucosinolates. D. radicum damage generally resulted in an elevated concentration of both aliphatic and aromatic glucosinolates. There was no clear evidence that glucosinolatc profiles were associated with different levels of antibiotic resistance to D. radicum and D. floralis. GRL aga (SCRI breeding line) was consistently resistant to the oviposition and larval feeding of D. radicum and D. floralis both in the laboratory and in the field. It was shown that the use of end-of-season chemical analysis to assess the influence of plant chemistry on insect development or host plant resistance in field experiments and the use of damage indexes based on the percentage of a plant root damaged by D. radicum may be flawed...|$|E

In the context of developing new strategies for crop protection, several studies have previously demonstrated the possibility to limit insect density on crops using either host or non-host plants that release attractive or repellent VOCs, respectively. The cabbage <b>root</b> <b>fly,</b> Delia radicum, is an important pest of brassicaceous crops for which control methods have to be implemented. Several studies have shown that plant odors influence cabbage <b>root</b> <b>fly</b> behavior, but only few VOCs have been identified so far.

Toxic secondary compounds {{are part of}} the chemical defense arsenal of plants against a range of antagonists, and are subject to genetic variation. Plants also produce primary metabolites (amino acids, nutrients, sugars) that function as essential compounds for growth and survival. Wild cabbage populations growing on the Dorset coast of the UK exhibit genetically different chemical defense profiles, even though they are located within a few kilometers of each other. As in other Brassicaceae, the defensive chemicals in wild cabbages constitute, among others, secondary metabolites called glucosinolates. Here, we used five Dorset populations of wild cabbage to study the effect of belowground herbivory by the cabbage <b>root</b> <b>fly</b> on primary and secondary chemistry, and whether differences in chemistry affected the performance of the belowground herbivore. There were significant differences in total root concentrations and chemical profiles of glucosinolates, amino acids, and sugars among the five wild cabbage populations.

In the present study, we compared the absorption and translocation differences of Se (IV) selenite and Se (VI) selenate in turnip. The results showed that Se treatment, either by soil addition (0. 2 – 2 mg Se kg− 1 dry soil) or by foliar spraying (50 – 200 mg L− 1 Se), could significantly increase the Se concentrations in turnips, and 0. 5 mg Se (IV) or Se (VI) kg− 1 dry matter in soils could improve the biomasses of turnips. Moreover, turnip absorbed significantly more Se (VI) than Se (IV) at the same concentration and also transferred much more Se (VI) from roots to leaves. Based on the Se concentrations, as well as the bioconcentration factors and translocation coefficients, we considered that turnip might be a potential Se indicator plant. Subsequently, we estimated the daily Se intake for adults based on the Se concentrations in <b>turnip</b> <b>roots.</b> The results indicated that Se (IV) should be more suitable as an artificial Se fertilizer for turnips, although the levels found in most samples in this study could cause selenosis to humans.

Recently, populations have been discovered in which the emergence of first generation flies was protracted, lasting until mid-July. The project aimed to investigate the incidence of late emergence in Devon and to examine the ways in which late emergers differed from early emergers in their progress through diapause. A new emergence trap was developed and used in conjunction with yellow water traps to monitor the emergence of cabbage <b>root</b> <b>fly</b> populations at locations of contrasting agricultural practice. Late emergence was widespread in Devon, occurring later (up to September), and in a greater proportion of some populations than any previously reported. The phenomenon appears to be a response to the planting of brassicas in June, as flies emerging at the normal time {{may not be able to}} locate a host crop. Emergence in a substantial proportion of one population was delayed for a year. This has not been been previously reported in cabbage <b>root</b> <b>fly</b> and represents a 'sit and wait' strategy associated with short-lived habitats, occurring in patches often separated by considerable distances but which frequently reappear in approximately the same location. A gas chromatography technique was developed which is capable of individually monitoring the respiration rates of large numbers of pupae.
