40|$|International {{migration}} has {{now become}} everyday phenomena that {{attract the attention of}} many <b>countries</b> in the world, either directly involved as sending <b>countries,</b> <b>transit</b> <b>countries,</b> recipient <b>countries,</b> and the combination of the three or is not directly involved. Indonesia is one of the <b>countries</b> directly involved in International migration issues {{that need to be addressed}} tactically and strategically. This study is based on a literature review, and interviews with relevant resource persons, including those directly involved in the ratification process. This research broadly finds that the Indonesian government to ratify the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of Migrant Workers is above the economic interests and political considerations. From the economic aspect, the Indonesian government sought to show its commitment to maintain foreign investment in Indonesia through the protection of foreign workers (TKA) which is driving investment in order to maintain economic growth in Indonesia. As for the political aspect, Indonesia seeks to improve the bargaining position to the <b>countries</b> of destination placement of Indonesian workers (TKI) that these <b>countries</b> provide maximum protection for Indonesian workers overseas...|$|R
50|$|The UK {{action plan}} on {{tackling}} human trafficking {{has discovered that}} many victims arrive into the United Kingdom on inexpensive airlines and often into small airports where there is less security surveillance. Other methods of transportation for victims of trafficking are by train, boat, bus, car, and even on foot. There are many different routes, including the Albanian, Nigerian, Moldavian, Russian-Ukrainian, and the Eastern Mediterranean route to name a few. Children victims of trafficking {{have been known to}} enter into the UK through different airports such as London City, Stansted, and Belfast International airport. They have also been discovered to have traveled to England, Scotland, and Northern Ireland airports. Before entering into the United Kingdom, victims of trafficking generally pass through <b>transit</b> <b>countries.</b> A <b>transit</b> <b>country</b> is a <b>country</b> that a trafficker will pass through on the way to their final destination. <b>Countries</b> that have very high volumes of traffickers being transited include Albania, Bulgaria, Hungary, Italy, Poland, and Thailand. Children from China have the highest proportion of victims according to studies, and travel on different routes before reaching the United Kingdom.

50|$|Europe has {{the highest}} number of sex slaves per capita in the world. In general, <b>countries</b> who are members of the European Union are {{destinations}} for individuals to be sex trafficked whereas the Balkans and Eastern Europe are source and <b>transit</b> <b>countries.</b> <b>Transit</b> <b>countries</b> are picked for their geographical location. This is because the locations the traffickers pick usually have a weak border control, the distance from the destination <b>countries,</b> corrupt official, or the organized crime groups are in on the sex trafficking. In 1997 alone as many as 175,000 young women from Russia, as well as the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, were sold as commodities in the sex markets of the developed <b>countries</b> in Europe and the Americas The European Union reported that from 2010-13 30,146 individuals were identified and registered as human trafficking victims. Of those registered, 69 percent of the victims were sexually exploited and more than 1,000 were children. Although many sex trafficked individuals are from outside of Europe, two-thirds of the 30,146 victims were EU citizens. Despite this high proportion of domestic sex slaves, the most common ethnicities of women who are trafficked to the United Kingdom are Chinese, Brazilian, and Thai. Moldova is a known <b>country</b> in Europe for women, children and men to be subjected to sex trafficking. Girls from Moldovan become sex slaves starting at the age of 14. On average, they have to sleep with 12 to 15 men. The national Bureau of Statistics in Moldova says that in 2008 there were almost 25,000 victims of trafficking. When the women from Moldova are being trafficked for sex, they {{are most likely to be}} sent to <b>countries</b> such as, Russia, Cyprus, Turkey, and other Middle Western and Eastern European <b>countries.</b> This is because, in Russia, it is said that the government is well aware about people being sex trafficked and maybe even promote it. 85 percent of the victims leave their <b>country</b> to find a better job to support their family, but they are tricked into becoming a sex slave and are forced to become a prostitute. The International Organization for Migration (IOM) asked victims what <b>country</b> they came from and sixty one percent of the victims came from Moldova, 19 percent came from Romania, and the rest came from Albania, Bulgaria, Russia, and Ukraine. More than 60 percent of the victims had a secondary school education or better, and 21 was the age average.|$|R

On the other hand China clearly understands that without cooperation with Russia, without her the Chinese Silk Road project will be incomplete, if not realizable. Northern corridor of the new Silk Road extends from Western China through Kazakhstan to Russia, Orenburg, and then, according to today's China - to St. Petersburg and the Baltic Sea, as well as through Belarus via Warsaw and further - into Western Europe. It is so to say "traditional line" of the Great Silk Road.

40|$|International {{trafficking}} in persons is often facilitated by the movement of victims through one or more <b>transit</b> <b>countries</b> {{in order to reach}} a destination <b>country</b> where the victim will ultimately be subjected to sexual exploitation or forced labour. Despite this recognized pattern, there has been a relative lack of attention paid to the response of <b>transit</b> <b>countries</b> in addressing their role in this transnational criminal activity and systematic human rights abuse. This working paper begins by identifying several characteristics common to <b>transit</b> <b>countries,</b> including: (1) geographic proximity by land, sea, or air to attractive destination countries; (2) insufficient legislation and weak enforcement against {{trafficking in}} persons and migrant smuggling; (3) liberal immigration policies; and (4) an operational criminal infrastructure to facilitate illegal entry to, and exit from, a <b>country.</b> The case study of Canada as a <b>transit</b> <b>country</b> to the United States is presented, both to better understand the nature of the problem between these two jurisdictions and to explore the responses that officials have provided to date. <b>Transit</b> <b>countries</b> face heightened challenges compared to origin and destination <b>countries,</b> particularly with respect to distinguishing between trafficked persons and smuggled migrants. By synthesizing the legal obligations in the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children and the Protocol Against the Smuggling of Migrants by Land, Sea and Air into terms that are relevant to <b>transit</b> <b>countries,</b> a comprehensive set of standards emerge to enhance their ability to prevent trafficking, prosecute traffickers and protect victims. Policies and programs that have been adopted by some <b>transit</b> <b>countries</b> are then highlighted, demonstrating how these standards can be implemented to engage <b>transit</b> <b>countries</b> in a more comprehensive response to {{trafficking in persons}}. While Canada and the United States have undertaken important bilateral efforts to combat trafficking in persons, the following recommendations are proposed to improve their joint response, including: 1. Increase training and capacity of border officials to identify potential trafficking victims in transit; 2. Continue to cooperate in joint enforcement activities to disrupt illegal movement across the shared border; 3. Enhance mutual legal assistance and engage in cross-border human trafficking investigations and prosecutions to dismantle the entire network involved in identified cases; 4. Ensure victims of human trafficking in transit are afforded assistance and protection, including support made increasingly available through enhanced cross-border cooperation between governmental and non-governmental victim support organizations; 5. Build public awareness in border areas about human trafficking, the needs of victims, and information on where to report suspicious activity; and 6. Cooperate with major source <b>countries</b> as well as enhance trilateral cooperation between Canada, the United States, and Mexico to prevent human trafficking.
