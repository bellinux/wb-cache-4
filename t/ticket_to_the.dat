25|$|The Arlanda Line in its {{entirety}} {{is owned by the}} state-owned Arlanda Infrastructure, which also owns platforms 1 and 2 at StockholmC. A-Train holds a monopoly on the right to transport passengers from Stockholm to Arlanda; other train operators only have the right to transport passengers to the airport from other towns and cities. In 2008, the cost of a boarding or embarking passenger at ArlandaC was SEK75. This results in a ticket from Uppsala to Arlanda costing SEK136, while a ticket on the same train but traveling onwards to StockholmC only costs SEK64. Similarly the cost of a <b>ticket</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> airport with the Arlanda Express is considerably higher than that of a ticket to Uppsala, which is twice as far away.|$|E

In addition to Steelers and Packers fans left without seats, the suit includes Cowboys fans who paid $100,000 for personal seat licenses, only to have to watch the Super Bowl in metal folding chairs without a view of the stadium's giant video replay board. The NFL at first offered $2,400 to fans who did not receive a replacement seat, but later offered tickets to a future Super Bowl with airfare and hotels included.|$|E

Though as late as 1932 he was still hailed by the press as “ilustrado joven”, in August 1933 he was placed in the tuberculosis-treatment Real Sanatorio de Guadarrama, where he died early 1934. His funeral and related commemorative homage feasts staged across Spain helped to mobilize support and demonstrated growing dynamics of Carlism.
