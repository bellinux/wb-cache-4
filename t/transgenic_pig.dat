50|$|Most of {{the known}} phytases belong to a class of enzyme called {{histidine}} acid phosphatases (HAPs). HAPs have been isolated from filamentous fungi, bacteria, yeast, and plants. All members of this class of phytase share a common active site sequence motif (Arg-His-Gly-X-Arg-X-Pro) and have a two-step mechanism that hydrolyzes phytic acid (as well as some other phosphoesters). The phytase from the fungus Aspergillus niger is a HAP and {{is well known for}} its high specific activity and its commercially marketed role as an animal feed additive to increase the bioavailability of phosphate from phytic acid in the grain-based diets of poultry and swine. HAPs have also been overexpressed in several transgenic plants as a potential alternative method of phytase production for the animal feed industry and very recently, the HAP phytase gene from E. coli has been successfully expressed in a <b>transgenic</b> <b>pig.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{incretin}} hormones GIP (glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide) and glucagon-like peptide- 1 (GLP- 1) {{mediate the}} so-called incretin effect, which describes the phenomenon that glucose given orally causes a higher insulin response {{compared to an}} isoglycemic intravenous glucose load. The insulinotropic action of GIP is reduced to almost absent in type 2 diabetes patients, while the action of GLP- 1 is vastly preserved. GIPRdn <b>transgenic</b> <b>pigs</b> were generated by lentiviral genetransfer to establish a large animal model to investigate the effects of an impaired insulinotropic action of GIP on glucose homeostasis. At the age of 5 months GIPRdn <b>transgenic</b> <b>pigs</b> showed a disturbed oral glucose tolerance going along with reduced insulin secretion. Eleven-month-old GIPRdn <b>transgenic</b> <b>pigs</b> exhibited an impaired intravenous glucose tolerance and reduced insulin secretion {{as well as a}} significantly reduced total β-cell volume compared to controls. In this work different age classes (11 weeks, 5 months, 1 - 1. 4 years) of GIPRdn transgenic were investigated to obtain detailed data about physiological and morphological characteristics. To proof specifity of the GIPRdn GIP/Exendin 4 stimulation tests were carried out in 11 week-old GIPRdn <b>transgenic</b> <b>pigs.</b> The insulinotropic action of intravenously injected porcine GIP was impaired, while this of Exendin- 4, a GLP- 1 mimetic, was enhanced in GIPRdn <b>transgenic</b> <b>pigs</b> compared to controls. Marked alterations in the expression profile of the GIPR and the GLP- 1 R were excluded as no apparent differences of immunohistochemically stained pancreas sections for GIPR and GLP- 1 R were detectable between GIPRdn <b>transgenic</b> <b>pigs</b> and controls at any age group. The effects of the impaired insulinotropic action of GIP on glucose metabolism were investigated by oral and intravenous glucose tolerance tests. Eleven-week-old GIPRdn <b>transgenic</b> <b>pigs</b> exhibited significantly reduced oral glucose tolerance with a delay in insulin secretion compared to controls. The area under the insulin curve (AUC insulin) during the first 45 minutes following glucose load was 31 % smaller in <b>transgenic</b> <b>pigs</b> compared to controls. The total amount of insulin secretion was not different between the two groups indicating that GIPRdn expression initially only interferes with the incretin effect. This was supported by the fact that intravenous glucose tolerance and insulin secretion in <b>transgenic</b> <b>pigs</b> were not different from controls. Five-month-old GIPRdn <b>transgenic</b> <b>pigs</b> exhibited a tendency towards reduced intravenous glucose tolerance and reduced insulin secretion in response to an intravenous glucose challenge. To determine the reason for the alterations in glucose metabolism quantitative stereological analyses of the pancreas were performed. In 11 -week-old <b>pigs,</b> <b>transgenic</b> and control groups showed similar β-cell mass. However, pancreatic -cell mass was reduced by almost 40 % in 5 -month-old and by 60 % in adult (1 1. 4 years) GIPRdn <b>transgenic</b> <b>pigs</b> compared to controls. Furthermore, the cellular composition of the islets was analyzed by quantitative stereological investigations. The relative volumes of α- and -cells in the islets were increased in 1 - 1. 4 -year-old GIPRdn <b>transgenic</b> <b>pigs</b> but the absolute volumes of these non-β-cell populations were not different from those of age-matched controls. To investigate the reason for the reduced pancreatic β-cell mass in GIPRdn <b>transgenic</b> <b>pigs,</b> β-cell proliferation and apoptosis rate was determined performing a double-immunohistochemistry for insulin and the proliferation marker Ki 67 and cleaved caspase- 3, respectively. Eleven-week-old GIPRdn <b>transgenic</b> <b>pigs</b> showed significantly less Ki 67 positive cell nuclei compared to controls, whereas proliferation rates in 5 month-old and 1 - 1. 4 -year-old GIPRdn <b>transgenic</b> <b>pigs</b> reached no statistical significance. No differences were shown in the apoptosis rates of GIPRdn <b>transgenic</b> <b>pigs</b> compared to controls at any age, although a trend of higher numbers of cleaved caspase- 3 positive β-cells was visible in 1 - 1. 4 -year-old GIPRdn <b>transgenic</b> <b>pigs.</b> In conclusion, GIPRdn <b>transgenic</b> <b>pigs</b> exhibit a comparable situation as in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients like impaired insulinotropic action of GIP, disturbed glucose tolerance and reduced β-cell mass. Moreover, the results of this work demonstrate an essential role of GIP for the physiological expansion of β-cell mass. In this context GIPRdn <b>transgenic</b> <b>pigs</b> represent a valuable model for further investigations on type 2 diabetes mellitus including diet studies and therapeutic trials...|$|R

The N-glycans of hPC are complex di- and tri-sialylated structures, and we measured 78 % site occupancy at Asn- 329 (the Asn-X-Cys sequon). The N-glycans of tg-PC are complex sialylated structures, but less branched and partially sialylated.

40|$|Transgenic pigs {{have become}} an {{attractive}} research model {{in the field of}} translational research, regenerative medicine, and stem cell therapy due to their anatomic, genetic and physiological similarities with humans. The development of fluorescent proteins as molecular tags has allowed investigators to track cell migration and engraftment levels after transplantation. Here we describe the development of two <b>transgenic</b> <b>pig</b> models via SCNT expressing a fusion protein composed of eGFP and porcine Histone 2 B (pH 2 B). This fusion protein is targeted to the nucleosomes resulting a nuclear/chromatin eGFP signal. The first model (I) was generated via random insertion of pH 2 B-eGFP driven by the CAG promoter (chicken beta actin promoter and rabbit Globin poly A; pCAG-pH 2 B-eGFP) and protected by human interferon-beta matrix attachment regions (MARs). Despite the consistent, high, and ubiquitous expression of the fusion protein pH 2 B-eGFP in all tissues analyzed, two independently generated Model I transgenic lines developed neurodegenerative symptoms including Wallerian degeneration between 3 - 5 months of age, requiring euthanasia. A second transgenic model (II) was developed via CRISPR-Cas 9 mediated homology-directed repair (HDR) of IRES-pH 2 B-eGFP into the endogenous beta-actin (ACTB) locus. Model II transgenic animals showed ubiquitous expression of pH 2 B-eGFP on all tissues analyzed. Unlike the pCAG-pH 2 B-eGFP/MAR line, all Model II animals were healthy and multiple pregnancies have been established with progeny showing the expected Mendelian ratio for the transmission of the pH 2 B-eGFP. Expression of pH 2 B-eGFP was used to examine the timing of the maternal to zygotic transition after IVF, and to examine chromosome segregation of SCNT embryos.

"May 2013 "The Ubiquitin Proteasome System (UPS) participates in many biological processes involving substrate-specific proteolysis, and can be linked to various pathologies and genetic diseases. Unfortunately, {{little is known about the}} interactions of proteasomal subunits with other sperm proteins or structures. Through a joint effort between Dr. Prather, Dr. Wells, and Dr. Sutovsky's labs, a novel <b>transgenic</b> <b>pig</b> model with Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) fused to the 20 S proteasomal core subunit α-type 1 (PSMA 1) was created, hypothesizing that the PSMA 1 -GFP fusion protein will be incorporated into functional sperm proteasomes. The first objective of this thesis was to confirm the presence of these PSMA 1 -GFP fusion proteins in the transgenic boar sperm and tissues. The second objective was to identify proteasome-interacting proteins that may regulate sperm proteasomal activity during fertilization or may be the substrates of proteasomal proteolysis during fertilization. A novel interaction with seminal plasma/sperm membrane glycoprotein, MFGE 8, and the 26 S proteasome was revealed. Therefore, a possible role for this interaction was investigated: that the 26 S proteasome mediates the degradation of MFGE 8, which allows the gradual release of spermatozoa from the sperm oviductal reservoir prior to fertilization. Furthermore, GFP affinity purification was used to isolate enzymatically active proteasomes which could be used to study sperm-oocyte interactions or wherever the UPS is involved. It was concluded that this <b>transgenic</b> <b>pig</b> model can be used to study proteasome localization, proteasome interacting proteins, and tissue specific proteasome isolation in all areas of UPS research...|$|E
40|$|Neurodegeneration is a {{hallmark}} of many neurological diseases, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and the polyglutamine diseases, which are all caused by misfolded proteins that accumulate in neuronal cells of the brain. Although apoptosis is believed to contribute to neurodegeneration in these cases, genetic mouse models of these diseases often fail to replicate apoptosis and overt neurodegeneration in the brain. Using nuclear transfer, we generated transgenic Huntington's disease (HD) pigs that express N-terminal (208 amino acids) mutant huntingtin with an expanded polyglutamine tract (105 Q). Postnatal death, dyskinesia and chorea-like movement were observed in some transgenic pigs that express mutant huntingtin. Importantly, the transgenic HD pigs, unlike mice expressing the same transgene, displayed typical apoptotic neurons with DNA fragmentation in their brains. Also, expression of mutant huntingtin resulted in more neurons with activated caspase- 3 in <b>transgenic</b> <b>pig</b> brains than that in transgenic mouse brains.

Recent attention has been focused on safety concerns regarding neo transgene expression. In this study, neo transgenic and non-transgenic piglets were randomly assigned into Group A and Group B to evaluate effects of neo transgene by studying changes in gut microbiota using high-throughput sequencing. Group A pigs were fed a standard diet supplemented with antibiotic neomycin; Group B pigs were fed a standard diet. We examined horizontal transfer of exogenous neo gene using multiplex PCR; and investigated if the presence of secreted NPT II (neo expression product) in the intestine could lead to some protection against neomycin in <b>transgenic</b> <b>pigs</b> by monitoring different patterns of changes in gut microbiota in Group A animals. The unintended effects of neo transgene on gut microbiota were studied in Group B animals. Horizontal gene transfer was not detected in gut microbiota of any <b>transgenic</b> <b>pigs.</b> In Group A, a significant difference was observed between <b>transgenic</b> <b>pigs</b> and non-transgenic pigs in pattern of changes in Proteobacteria populations in fecal samples during and post neomycin feeding. In Group B, there were significant differences in the relative abundance of phyla Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria, and genera Lactobacillus and Escherichia-Shigella-Hafnia between <b>transgenic</b> <b>pigs</b> and non-transgenic pigs. We speculate that the secretion of NPT II from transgenic tissues/cells into gut microbiota results in the inhibition of neomycin activity and the different patterns of changes in bacterial populations. Furthermore, the neo gene also leads to unintended effects on gut microbiota in <b>transgenic</b> <b>pigs</b> that were fed with basic diet (not supplemented with neomycin).

40|$|Hemophilia B is the {{congenital}} {{bleeding disorder}} caused by deficiency in functional coagulation factor IX (FIX) and about 28, 000 patients worldwide in 2012. And current treatment {{is restricted to}} protein-replacement therapy, which required FIX concentrates for patients’ life-time. Approximately 1 billion units FIX were consumed in 2012. However, still about 70 - 80 % patients, mostly in developing countries, received inadequate or no treatment because of the unavailable and/or unaffordable FIX concentrates. Considering safety reasons, e. g. transmission of blood-borne diseases, the recombinant human FIX (rFIX) is recommended other than the plasma-derived FIX. However, only one rFIX is currently available on the market. The complexity of the FIX protein and its post-translational modifications (PTMs) cause the limit quantity and unaffordable high price of the recombinant human FIX. We previously reported successfully expressing recombinant human FIX in the milk by mammary gland of <b>transgenic</b> <b>pig</b> (tg-FIX) and established a lab-scale purification protocol to achieve active tg-FIX. The expression of tg-FIX level was about 2 - 3 g/L and with 10 - 20 % specific activity. The final purified high acidic tg-FIX had the specific activity closed to the normal human plasma derived FIX. In this study, efforts were aim to further increase the yield of the active tg-FIX from the <b>transgenic</b> <b>pig.</b> First, we investigated degradation/activation of the tg-FIX in the milk by predominant milk-borne protease, plasmin. This provided us the data in decreasing the degradation and activation of final products. Then, to process the excessive non-active pro-peptide attached tg-FIX, we bio-engineered the mammary gland by introducing truncated human furin gene. The co-expressed recombinant furin cleaved pro-peptide of tg-FIX both in mammary epithelium, it also secreted and cleaved the pro-peptide in milk. This bio-engineering has been proved not interfering the over-expression of the tg-FIX and its specific activity. Finally, to mass producing active tg-FIX, we established the large scale purification protocol. The purified active tg-FIX was achieved within four chromatography steps with full specific activity. Not like the previous one, the active tg-FIX was further enriched and the contaminant activated tg-FIX was totally eliminated. This study made progress in producing recombinant human FIX economically. Advisor: William H. Velande...|$|E

The cardiac function resulted preserved. Our data are in agreement with what was already shown by other groups using different experimental models. In conclusion, we encourage the use of new sources of transgenic animals, pointing out the importance of morphological analysis in evaluation of xenograft...|$|E

The technology of pig somatic NT, including {{in vitro maturation}} of oocytes, isolation and treatment of donor cells, artificial activation of reconstructed oocytes, embryo culture and embryo transfer, has been intensively studied in recent years, resulting in birth of cloned pigs in many labs. While it provides an efficient method for producing transgenic pigs, more importantly, {{it is the only}} way to produce gene-targeted pigs. So far pig cloning has been successfully used to produce transgenic pigs expressing the green fluorescence protein, expand <b>transgenic</b> <b>pig</b> groups and create gene targeted pigs which are deficient of alpha- 1, 3 -galactosyltransferase. The production of pigs with genetic modification by NT is now in the transition from investigation to practical use. Although the efficiency of somatic cell NT in pig, when measured as development to term as a proportion of oocytes used, is not high, it is anticipated that the ability of making specific modifications to the swine genome will result in this technology having a large impact not only on medicine but also on agriculture...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE. TO further {{characterize}} the retinas of Pro 347 Leu rhodopsin transgenic pigs, {{a model for}} human retinitis pigmentosa. METHODS. Retinas from normal and transgenic pigs, newborn to 20 months old, were processed for light and electron microscopic immunocytochemical examination. RESULTS. At birth, rod numbers were normal in the transgenic retinas, but their outer segments were short and disorganized and their inner segments contained stacks of rhodopsin-positive membranes. The newborn rod synapses lacked synaptic vesicles and ribbons and had numerous rhodopsin-positive, filopodia-like processes that extended past the cone synapses into the outer plexiform layer. Rod cell death was apparent by 2 weeks and was pronounced in the mid periphery and central regions by 6 weeks. Far peripheral rods were initially better preserved, but by 9 months virtually all rods had degenerated. Cones degenerated more slowly than rods, but by 4 weeks the cone synapses were shrunken and some mid peripheral cones had lost their immunoreactivity for phosphodiesterase-y, arrestin, and recoverin. From 9 months to 20 months, the cone outer segments shortened progressively, and more cones lost immunoreactivity for these proteins. CONCLUSIONS. The rhodopsin <b>transgenic</b> <b>pig</b> retina shares many cytologic features with huma...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: <b>Transgenic</b> <b>pigs</b> with {{rhodopsin}} (Pro 347 Leu) mutation exhibited rod-cone degeneration. We {{compared the}} pathologic {{characteristics of the}} rod degeneration versus those of the cone cells. METHODS: The posterior and peripheral retinas of these <b>transgenic</b> <b>pigs</b> of age 4, 6, 8, 12, 24 and 33 weeks and normal pigs of age 4 and 8 weeks were studied by light and EM and morphometry. RESULTS: The pathologic changes observed in the posterior and peripheral retinas of the <b>transgenic</b> <b>pigs</b> could be conveniently described in 3 phases: I) an initial phase of rapid and extensive degeneration of the rod cells in the first 6 weeks of age; II) an acute phase of cone cell degeneration involving {{approximately half of the}} population and lingering rod degeneration in the 6 to 12 weeks of age; and III) a partial cone recovery to be followed by a chronic degenerative phase of the remaining cones cells from 12 to 33 weeks of age. CONCLUSION: Our study showed that the degenerative changes of rod cells could be differentiated from those of the cone cells. Cone and rod populations degenerated along different time schedule with different pathologic features. Hence, treatment for retinitis pigmentosa might vary with the different stages of the disease...|$|R
40|$|<b>Transgenic</b> <b>pigs</b> {{have been}} {{engineered}} to express human CD 59 (hCD 59) {{in order to}} suppress hyperacute rejection of xenotransplants in human recipients. In this study, porcine endogenous retrovirus (PERV) was produced in a porcine cell line expressing hCD 59 {{in order to examine}} the effect of this complement control protein on PERV neutralization by human sera. hCD 59 was found to be incorporated into PERV particles produced from engineered ST-IOWA cells. PERV incorporation of hCD 59 resulted in a dramatic inhibition of complement-mediated virolysis by human serum. However, incorporation of hCD 59 had no effect on neutralization of PERV by human serum, as measured in infectivity assays. Our results suggest that the use of organs from hCD 59 <b>transgenic</b> <b>pigs</b> will inhibit complement-mediated virolysis, but will not compromise the protective effects of human sera on the neutralization of PERV particles...|$|R
40|$|Xenotransplantation using <b>transgenic</b> <b>pigs</b> as {{an organ}} source is a {{promising}} strategy to overcome shortage of human organ for transplantation. Various genetic modifications {{have been tried}} to ameliorate xenograft rejection. In the present study we assessed effect of transgenic expression of human heme oxygenase- 1 (hHO- 1), an inducible protein capable of cytoprotection by scavenging reactive oxygen species and preventing apoptosis caused by cellular stress during inflammatory processes, in neonatal porcine islet-like cluster cells (NPCCs). Transduction of NPCCs with adenovirus containing hHO- 1 gene significantly reduced apoptosis compared with the GFP-expressing adenovirus control after treatment with either hydrogen peroxide or hTNF-a and cycloheximide. These protective effects were diminished by co-treatment of hHO- 1 antagonist, Zinc protoporphyrin IX. We also generated <b>transgenic</b> <b>pigs</b> expressing hHO- 1 and analyzed expression and function of the transgene.

40|$|Background: Pigs are {{an optimal}} animal for {{conducting}} biomedical research {{because of their}} anatomical and physiological resemblance to humans. In contrast to the abundant resources available {{in the study of}} mice, few fluorescent protein-harboring porcine models are available for preclinical studies. In this paper, we report the successful generation and characterization of a transgenic DsRed-Monomer porcine model. Methods: The transgene comprised a CMV enhancer/chicken-beta actin promoter and DsRed monomeric cDNA. Transgenic pigs were produced by using pronuclear microinjection. PCR and Southern blot analyses were applied for identification of the transgene. Histology, blood examinations and computed tomography were performed to study the health conditions. The pig amniotic fluid progenitor/stem cells were also isolated to examine the existence of red fluorescence and differentiation ability. Results: Transgenic pigs were successfully generated and transmitted to offspring at a germ-line transmission rate of 43. 59 % (17 / 39). Ubiquitous expression of red fluorescence was detected in the brain, eye, tongue, heart, lung, liver, pancreas, spleen, stomach, small intestine, large intestine, kidney, testis, and muscle; this was confirmed by histology and western blot analyses. In addition, we confirmed the differentiation potential of amniotic fluid progenitor stem cells isolated from the <b>transgenic</b> <b>pig...</b>|$|E

40|$|Triglycerides are the {{majority}} lipid component of most biochemical mixtures and are virtually water insoluble. Lipid removal is desired prior to protein purification processing to decrease nonspecific fouling of downstream chromatographic matrices. <b>Transgenic</b> <b>pig</b> milk {{was used as}} a model system to study delipidation from therapeutic protein sources. The majority of triglycerides was extracted from stable lipid micelles and removed with a method that can be incorporated in downstream protein purification processing without denaturing the target protein. An efficient delipidation treatment used TNBP, a non-polar solvent, to extract lipid micelles and then phase transfer milk lipids into a TNBP-swelled dextran particulate. A batch incubation of a whey/TNBP mixture with pre-swollen Sephadex LH- 20 or hydroxyalkoxypropyl dextran (HAPD) o beads at 4 C for 24 hours removed 67 + 2 % (0. 645 mg triglycerides/ml Sephadex LH- 20) and 71 + 1 % (0. 628 mg triglycerides/ml HAPD) of the triglycerides present in the skimmed transgenic whey, respectively. Fully swollen beads removed 20 % more triglycerides than beads which were wetted but not swollen in TNBP, indicating that a larger phase volume and internal adsorption of the lipids onto the Sephadex matrix dominates over surface adsorption.

40|$|Since large animal {{transgenesis}} {{has been}} successfully attempted {{for the first time}} about 25 years ago, the technology has been applied in various lines of <b>transgenic</b> <b>pigs.</b> Nevertheless one of the concerns with the technology - animal welfare - has not been approached through systematic assessment and statements regarding the welfare of <b>transgenic</b> <b>pigs</b> have been based on anecdotal observations during early stages of transgenic programs. The main aim {{of the present study was}} therefore to perform an extensive welfare assessment comparing heterozygous transgenic animals expressing GFP with wildtype animals along various stages of post natal development. The protocol used covered reproductory performance and behaviour in GFP and wildtype sows and general health and development, social behaviour, exploratory behaviour and emotionality in GFP and wildtype littermates from birth until an age of roughly four months. The absence of significant differences between GFP and wildtype animals in the parameters observed suggests that the transgenic animals in question are unlikely to suffer from deleterious effects of transgene expression on their welfare and thus support existing anecdotal observations of pigs expressing GFP as healthy. Although the results are not surprising in the light of previous experience, they give a more solid fundament to the evaluation of GFP expression as being relatively non-invasive in pigs. The present study may furthermore serve as starting point for researchers aiming at a systematic characterization of welfare relevant effects in the line of <b>transgenic</b> <b>pigs</b> they are working with...|$|R
40|$|A型血友病為主要遺傳性血液凝固異常疾病之一，根據統計，全球約五千名男性中即有一位罹病。此疾病為一X染色體性聯遺傳疾病，起因為體內缺乏凝血機制中內在途徑所需的第八號凝血因子或該因子表現量異常，導致患者無法於出血時自體正常啟動凝血功能；此凝血因子於正常機制中，會切除其基因片段中的B區域並釋出以完成活化，並且進一步協助誘發下游第十凝血因子的活化，續以誘發凝蛋白的產生。目前臨床上的治療方式大多給予患者外源性的重組型第八凝血因子。於先前的研究中，研究人員已發現，於體外細胞表現系統中，與全長人類第八凝血因子相比，重組型第八凝血因子基因片段上B區域的刪除可有效提升功能性第八凝血因子蛋白的產率，因此本研究團隊以此概念利用胚胎顯微注射技術順利產製出兩頭B區域刪除之第八凝血因子（BDD-hFVIII）基因轉殖母豬。本實驗著重於分析及探討B區域刪除之第八凝血因子轉殖豬在染色體上目標基因表現的型態與其第八凝血因子分泌至乳汁中的蛋白表現，並對所產出的B區域刪除之第八凝血因子做活性分析。我們的研究結果證實這兩頭BDD-hFVIII基因轉殖豬，不僅本身攜帶BDD-hFVIII基因，且可藉由性腺傳遞將此外源性蛋白遺傳至部份子代。於母豬泌乳期中，可持續性的於乳汁中檢測到第八凝血因子，其產量隨著泌乳天數增加而減少。進一步結果顯示，於乳清中所得到的BDD-hFVIII蛋白與全長之hFVIII同樣具有凝血活性。Hemophilia A {{is one of}} {{the major}} {{inherited}} bleeding disorders approximately one in five thousands males in worldwide. This X-linked disease is caused by a deficiency or abnormality in coagulation Factor VIII, which B-domain will be deleted and released during activation, and then induced activation of Factor X. Recombinant human Factor VIII is the major clinical treatment for patients. In previous study, researchers found that the production of functional FVIII is elevated extremely with B domain-deleted recombinant human Factor VIII compared to full length human Factor VIII in vitro. Therefore, our research team had successfully produced two line of <b>transgenic</b> <b>pigs</b> carrying B domain-deleted human Factor VIII (BDD-hFVIII) by embryonic microinjection technology. To investigate the blood clotting function and efficiencies of B domain-deleted human factor VIII produced in the milks of <b>transgenic</b> <b>pigs,</b> we examined the integration patterns of BDD-hFVIII gene in <b>transgenic</b> <b>pigs</b> and detected the production of BDD-hFVIII in pig's milks. The function and biochemical character of BDD-hFVIII is tested by clotting activity assays. Our results confirm the BDD-hFVIII <b>transgenic</b> <b>pigs</b> not only carry BDD-hFVIII gene, but also germ line- transmit this target gene to the part of their offspring. The BDD-hFVIII protein can be found in pig's milks which were collected from lactating <b>transgenic</b> <b>pigs,</b> and the production levels are decreased day by day. We also elucidate that the blood clotting function of BDD-hFVIII is the same with intact hFVIII. 中文摘要 [...] i 英文摘要 [...] ii 目次 [...] iii 表次 [...] vi 圖次 [...] . vii 壹、 文獻檢討 [...] 1 一、血友病…………………………………………………… [...] ………… [...] … 1 （一）A型血友病 [...] 1 （二）B型血友病… [...] . 2 （三）C型血友病…… [...] . 2 （四）von Willbrand氏症 [...] 2 二、人類第八凝血因子…………………………………………………… [...] . … 7 （一）生化物理特性…… [...] . 7 1.
