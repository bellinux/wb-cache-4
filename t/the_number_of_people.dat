40|$|Objective: To {{examine the}} {{relationship}} between <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> walking or bicycling and the frequency of collisions between motorists and walkers or bicyclists. The common wisdom holds that <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> collisions varies directly with the amount of walking and bicycling. However, three published analyses of collision rates at specific intersections found a non-linear relationship, such that collisions rates declined with increases in <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> walking or bicycling...|$|R

About 1.5% of children in the United States (one in 68) are diagnosed with ASD , a 30% increase from one in 88 in 2012. The rate of autism among adults aged 18 years and over in the United Kingdom is 1.1%. <b>The</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> diagnosed has been increasing dramatically since the 1980s, partly due to changes in diagnostic practice; the question of whether actual rates have increased is unresolved.|$|E
5|$|However, recent {{research}} {{supports the idea}} that the lead found in the water came from the supply pipes, rather than another source of contamination.

5|$|Treatment of TB uses {{antibiotics}} to {{kill the}} bacteria. Effective TB treatment is difficult, due to the unusual structure and chemical composition of the mycobacterial cell wall, which hinders the entry of drugs and makes many antibiotics ineffective. The two antibiotics most commonly used are isoniazid and rifampicin, and treatments can be prolonged, taking several months. Latent TB treatment usually employs a single antibiotic, while active TB disease is best treated with combinations of several antibiotics {{to reduce the risk}} of the bacteria developing antibiotic resistance. People with latent infections are also treated to prevent them from progressing to active TB disease later in life. Directly observed therapy, i.e., having a health care provider watch the person take their medications, is recommended by the WHO in an effort to reduce <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> not appropriately taking antibiotics. The evidence to support this practice over people simply taking their medications independently is of poor quality. There is no strong evidence indicating that directly observed therapy improves <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> who were cured or <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> who complete their medicine. Moderate quality evidence suggests that there is also no difference if people are observed at home versus at a clinic, or by a family member versus a health care worker. Methods to remind people of the importance of treatment and appointments may result in a small but important improvement.|$|E
5|$|Violent crime, {{including}} murder, {{has occurred}} on the trail in a few instances. Most have been crimes by non-hikers who crossed paths relatively randomly with the AT hiker-victims.

5|$|Afterwards, local townspeople went to {{see what}} happened, and 100 to 200 people who got near to the {{meteorite}} crater soon reported feeling sick. First responding police officers arriving to investigate the scene also fell ill. After the initial event of September 15, <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> falling ill increased, requiring physicians to establish auxiliary medical tents for the Carancas health center. Patients were treated for dermal injuries, nausea, headaches, diarrhea and vomiting. The death of nearby livestock was also reported.

Four days after the meteorite impact and the unexplained illness, most villagers reported having recovered.|$|E
5|$|Another crisis {{broke in}} September 1949 when the Air Force picked up {{signs of the}} Soviet Union's RDS-1 nuclear test. Bacher joined Oppenheimer, Parsons, General Hoyt Vandenberg, the Atomic Energy Commissioners and a British {{delegation}} under William Penney to discuss what to do. The recent devaluation of the British pound had already triggered a financial crisis, and there was concern about how the markets would react to the news. Oppenheimer and Bacher saw the evidence of a nuclear test as conclusive, and Bacher in particular came down strongly {{on the side of}} making a public announcement, as <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> who already knew made a leak almost inevitable. Truman made the announcement a few days later.|$|E
5|$|Approval for the mission, codenamed Operation Chariot, {{was given}} on 3 March 1942.

Consequently, it was decided the navy would have to provide a ship of their own. The RAF complained that the raid would draw heavily on their resources; the number of aircraft assigned by RAF Bomber Command was reduced {{time and time again}} before the day of the raid. British Prime Minister Winston Churchill further complicated matters when he ordered that bombing should only take place if targets were clearly identified.|$|E
