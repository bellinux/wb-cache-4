50|$|Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) is a {{metropolitan}} area in Maharashtra state, {{consisting of the}} state capital Mumbai and its satellite towns. Developing {{over a period of}} about 20 years, it consists of nine municipal corporations and fifteen smaller municipal councils. The entire area is overseen by the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA), a Maharashtra State Government organisation in charge of <b>town</b> <b>planning,</b> <b>development,</b> transportation and housing in the region. The MMRDA was formed to address the challenges in planning and development of integrated infrastructure for the metropolitan region. The areas outside Brihan Mumbai (Greater Mumbai) and Navi Mumbai have lacked organised development. Navi Mumbai, developed as one of the largest planned cities in the world, was promoted by a Maharashtra Government-owned company, City and Industrial Development Corporation (CIDCO). The region has had problems related to haphazard and illegal development as a result of rapid urbanisation. Villages along the NH3 in Bhiwandi Taluka are examples of haphazard developments in the MMR, with some of the largest warehousing areas in India. Government agencies such as the Town Planner and Collector of Thane have had challenges in addressing unorganised development.The region has an area of 4,355 km² and with a population of 20,748,395, it is among the most populous metropolitan areas in the world.|$|E

40|$|The role of <b>town</b> <b>planning</b> (<b>development</b> {{control in}} particular) in urban design issues {{relating}} to new development is poorly understood and undervalued. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate to what extent the planning process made a difference to outcomes, and what factors relating process and use of policy were more likely to lead to positive outcomes. Views of key players in the statutory planning decision-making process, in four case-study towns, were obtained through semi-structured interviews. The case-study towns included Ludlow, Dorchester, Chichester and Durham. An example of a 'successful' and an 'unsuccessful' major new development was examined for each town. The findings indicate that planning can play a significant role in securing a successful outcome, but organizational and political issues, as well as varying skill levels, can hinder the role and give rise to negative perceptions. It is clear that many factors have to work together to help ensure good outcomes, and there is no quick fix. Opportunities for improvement in the design input by planning, including local development frameworks, are considered...|$|E
