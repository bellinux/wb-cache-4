We report herein our observations on the catalytically nature of 2, 4 -dimethylpentadienyl rare earth metal complexes. Under standard conditions the complexes are catalytically inactive. In order to successfully activate the coordinatively saturated complexes aluminium <b>trialkyls</b> AlMe 3, AlEt 3, and Al(i-Bu) 3, aluminoxanes methylaluminoxane (MAO), hexaisobuthylaluminoxane (HiBAO) and modified methylaluminoxane with an Al(i-Bu) 3 additive (MMAO) and diethylaluminium bromide were employed as cocatalysts. The actual catalyst is believed to be a soluble mono(2, 4 -dimethylpenta-dienyl) neodymium(III) dianion complex, through which an insertion of 1, 3 -butadiene in the pentadienyl-neodymium(III) bond causes the catalysis of the chain growth to be initiated. From these investigations a substantial further insight into the chemistry of (2, 4 -dimethylpentadienyl) lanthanide(III) complexes was gained and the special applicability of the neodymium complexes for the preparation of highly active catalyst for the 1, 4 -cis-polymerization of 1, 3 -butadienes was demonstrated...|$|R

40|$|The {{polymerization}} of allene {{induced by}} organoaluminum-vanadium oxytrichloride catalysts {{has been investigated}} in aliphatic hydrocarbons and at normal pressure. For the catalysts investigated, the polymerization activity decreases at decreasing order of alkylation of the aluminum alkyl: AIR 3 > AIR 2 X > AIRX 2 (R is Et or i-Bu; X is halogen). Compared with other aluminum <b>trialkyls,</b> trimethylaluminum shows a low activity. For the Al-i-Bu 3 -VOCl 3 system, the effects of catalyst ratio, reaction time, and temperature have been studied. The polyallenes obtained are generally highly crystalline and melt between 115 and 125 ½C. The structure of the polymers was investigated {{by means of an}} NMR-infrared analysis. The activity of the initiating systems has been related to reactions taking place between the catalyst components. It is concluded that active catalysts are formed under conditions that favor the formation of vanadium (I 1 or 111) -aluminum complexes of a relatively low solubility and stability. A polymerization mechanism is proposed in which the propagation starts with a coordination of the monomer with a vanadium center. In the next step the monomer is inserted into the vanadium-carbon bond of the growing polymer chain. It is assumed that the chain grows at the central carbon atom of the monomer unit. Vinyl and internal double bonds may have been formed as a result of isomerization of the chain end by a proton shift. © 1968, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} a broad {{study of the}} co-ordination chemistry and reactions of indium trihalides and <b>trialkyls.</b> Particular emphasis has been placed upon indium compounds which also contain phosphorus. A detailed study of the 1 : 1 complexes formed between indium triiodide and several phosphine ligands is described. X-ray crystallographic studies showed that these complexes are tetrahedral monomers in the solid state. This is the first conclusive proof that indium triiodide will form monomeric tetrahedral complexes. N. m. r. studies have also been carried out on these complexes. Also described are the results of X -ray diffraction studies on two other phosphine complexes. InCI 3 (PMe 3) 2 and (InI 3) 2 (Diphos) 3. The latter complex is the first example of a trigonal bipyramidal structure that has been reponed for any indium triiodide complex. The reactions between methyllithium and two indium triiodidephosphine complexes are described. This {{proved to be a}} useful method for preparing methylated derivatives of these complexes. The reactions between indium triiodide and LiPBut 2 are also described. Three equivalents of this reagent yielded In(PBut 2) 3, which was shown by X-ray crystallography to be an example of a rare monomeric three coordinate indium compound.

40|$|The {{first part}} of this PhD was devoted to the {{structural}} characterization of methylaluminoxane (MAO). Initially the work focused upon MAO formation by studying the hydrolysis reaction of trimethylaluminium (TMA), with a greater interest in the initial reaction steps of TMA with H 2 O. This was attempted by using 1 H VT NMR spectroscopy and by combining infrared spectroscopy with the matrix isolation technique. Low temperature NMR experiments successfully led to the identification of the AlMe 3 ·H 2 O adduct as the first intermediate, followed by formation of Me 2 AlOH, when THF was employed as a solvent. Another approach focused on the characterization of MAO by developing a fast and reliable method for quantification of the TMA content of commercial MAO solutions via 1 H-NMR spectroscopy with addition of donors. This research also showed that MAO contains a small amount of certain structures, which upon addition of THF or pyridine can lead to the formation of cationic species [AlMe 2 L 2]+. The second part of this work was devoted to the enhancement of MAO’s catalytic efficiency by kinetic studies on 1 -hexene. The primary aim was to produce MAO soluble in aliphatic hydrocarbons by addition of branched or long chain aluminium <b>trialkyls,</b> which proved to be effective solubilizing agents, and by modification of MAO with long chain silanols. Addition of silanols led to polymers with lower. Differences in productivity, polymer molecular weight and number of active species were shown to be primarily a linear function of the TMA concentration. An important part of this PhD was the development of a synthetic route towards ethyl-iso-butylaluminoxane (EBAO) and use in 1 -hexene polymerization. This is the first study where EBAO is successfully used as a soluble component in 1 -hexene polymerization in heptane and leads to comparable or even higher productivities and higher number average molecular weights compared to the MAO catalytic systems...|$|R

The investigation of the solution structure of 1 - 3 by means of VT 1 H NMR spectroscopy revealed fluxional exchange between coordinated and noncoordinated pyrazolyl rings, producing interconversion between the two enantiomers. The activation enthalpy (¢H#) for racemization processes (10. 1 (0. 2 kcalâmol- 1 (1); 11. 6 (0. 3 kcalâmol- 1 (2); 14. 1 (0. 2 kcalâmol- 1 (3)) was dependent on steric hindrance at the aluminum center. Reaction of 1 or 2 with B(C 6 F 5) 3 proceeds through net alkyl abstraction, forming the expected cationic aluminum complexes [(bpzmp) AlR]+[RB(C 6 F 5) 3]- (R) Me (4); R) Et (5)), in which the bpzmp fragment acts as a tridentate ligand. The ionization reaction of 3 with Lewis acidic compounds (B(C 6 F 5) 3 or [Ph 3 C][B(C 6 F 5) 4]) proceeds by net â-H abstraction from the isobutyl group, forming [(bpzmp) AliBu]+[HB(C 6 F 5) 3]- (6) along with isobutene; in contrast, reaction with the Bro¨nsted acid [HNMe 2 Ph][B(C 6 F 5) 4] proceeds by protonolysis of the isobutyl group. Complex 4 is active in ringopening polymerization of -caprolactone (-CL), producing high-molecular-weight polymers. The 1 H NMR monitoring of the reaction between 4 and -CL in 1 : 1 molar ratio showed that the initiation involves monomer insertion into the Al-O bond of the bpzmp fragment, forming the intermediate [(bpzphe) AlMe]+- [MeB(C 6 F 5) 4]- (bpzphe) 2, 4 -di-tert-butyl- 6 -(bis(3, 5 -dimethylpyrazol- 1 -yl) methyl) phenyl 6 -hydroxyhexanoate (8).

50|$|The {{mechanism}} of the Suzuki reaction is best viewed {{from the perspective of}} the palladium catalyst. The first step is the oxidative addition of palladium to the halide 2 to form the organopalladium species 3. Reaction with base gives intermediate 4, which via transmetalation with the boron-ate complex 6 (produced by reaction of the boronic acid 5 with base) forms the organopalladium species 8. Reductive elimination of the desired product 9 restores the original palladium catalyst 1 which completes the catalytic cycle. The Suzuki coupling takes place in the presence of a base and for a long time the role of the base was never fully understood. The base was first believed to form a <b>trialkyl</b> borate (R3B-OR), in the case of a reaction of an trialkylborane (BR3) and alkoxide (−OR); this species could be considered as being more nucleophilic and then more reactive towards the palladium complex present in the transmetalation step.
