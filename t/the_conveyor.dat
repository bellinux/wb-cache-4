5|$|The jetty {{facilities}} used two cranes to offload coal, {{with the capacity}} of unloading two ships at one time, {{at a rate of}} 480 tonnes an hour. Coal was also delivered by rail to the east of the station using the Brighton Main Line which passes near the site. Coal was usually delivered to the jetty, rather than by rail. A conveyor belt system was then used to take coal to the coal storage area or directly to the station's boiler rooms. <b>The</b> <b>conveyor</b> belt system consisted of a series of bridges connected by towers. The coal storage area was a large concrete box capable of holding 75,000 tonnes of coal. This had an overhead gantry with a conveyor belt attached to <b>the</b> <b>conveyor</b> belt system, for taking coal from the coal store to the boiler rooms.|$|E

50|$|Vertical lift {{conveyors}} contain two adjacent, parallel conveyors for simultaneous {{upward movement}} of adjacent surfaces of <b>the</b> parallel <b>conveyors.</b> One of <b>the</b> <b>conveyors</b> normally has spaced apart flites for transporting bulk food items. <b>The</b> dual <b>conveyors</b> rotate in opposite directions, but are operated from one gear box to ensure equal belt speed.

5|$|The left edge of <b>the</b> <b>conveyor</b> belt is sharp due {{to higher}} density air moving {{in from the}} west forcing a sharp slope to the cold front. An area of {{stratiform}} precipitation develops poleward of the warm front along <b>the</b> <b>conveyor</b> belt. Active precipitation poleward of the warm front implies potential for greater development of the cyclone. A portion of this conveyor belt turns to the right (left in the Southern Hemisphere), aligning with the upper level westerly flow. However, the western portion of this belt wraps around the northwest (southwest in the Southern Hemisphere) side of the cyclone, which can contain moderate to heavy precipitation. If the air mass is cold enough, the precipitation falls {{in the form of}} heavy snow. Theory from the 1980s talked about the presence of a cold conveyor belt originating north of the warm front and flowing along a clockwise path (in the northern hemisphere) into the main belt of the westerlies aloft, but there has been conflicting evidence {{as to whether or not}} this phenomenon actually exists.|$|E
5|$|The two establishments were {{constructed}} in South East Northumberland {{as part of}} an incentive to lower the high unemployment numbers. The site was also chosen because of the Ellington and Lynemouth collieries. Ellington Colliery sunk in 1909, with Lynemouth Colliery sinking 18 years later. However, in 1968, the two collieries were connected underground by the Bewick Drift, from which coal was brought to the surface. The Drift had no rail connection, and so coal was sent to the washery at Lynemouth by conveyor belt. The power station was constructed nearby the end of <b>the</b> <b>conveyor</b> belt.|$|E

5|$|Gases {{from the}} furnace are cleaned using {{selective}} non-catalytic reduction (SNCR), spray absorbers and active carbon injection. These processes remove nitrogen oxides, acidic gasses, dioxins and heavy metals from the plants emissions. The remaining gases are passed through fine-fabric bag filters to remove and solid particles, {{before it is}} released from the chimney. Each incineration line has its own independent stack in the chimney, and the flue gases are continuously monitored before being released. This information is relayed to the control room. The remaining fly ash from the filters contains particles from the incineration, lime from the spray absorbers, salt and carbon dust, and so is stored in a sealed silo until it is taken from the site for disposal. Incinerator bottom ash left on the incineration grate after the burning is moved by converyor to a bunker. Whilst on <b>the</b> <b>conveyor,</b> a magnet removes ferrous metal from the ash for recycling. The remaining ash is then used as an aggregate in the construction industry.|$|E
5|$|Polar front {{theory is}} {{attributed}} to Jacob Bjerknes, and was derived from a coastal network of observation sites in Norway during World War I. This theory proposed that the main inflow into a cyclone was concentrated along two lines of convergence, one ahead (or east) of the low and another trailing equatorward (south in the Northern Hemisphere and north in the Southern Hemisphere) and behind (or west) of the low. The convergence line ahead of the low became known as either the steering line or the warm front. The trailing convergence zone {{was referred to as}} the squall line or cold front. Areas of clouds and rainfall appeared to be focused along these convergence zones. A conveyor belt, also referred to as the warm conveyor belt, is a term describing the flow of a stream of warm moist air originating within the warm sector (or generally equatorward) of an extratropical cyclone in advance of the cold front which slopes up above and poleward (north in the Northern Hemisphere and south in the Southern Hemisphere) of the surface warm front. The concept of <b>the</b> <b>conveyor</b> belt originated in 1969.|$|E

40|$|Despite the {{popularity}} of the conveyor-belt model for portraying the airflow through midlatitude cyclones, questions arise as to the path of <b>the</b> cold <b>conveyor</b> belt, <b>the</b> lower-tropospheric airflow poleward of and underneath the warm front. Some studies, beginning with Carlson’s analysis of the eastern U. S. cyclone of 5 December 1977, depict <b>the</b> cold <b>conveyor</b> belt moving westward, reaching the northwest quadrant of the storm, turning abruptly anticyclonically, rising to jet level, and departing the cyclone downstream (hereafter, the anticyclonic path). Other studies depict <b>the</b> cold <b>conveyor</b> belt reaching <b>the</b> northwest quadrant, turning cyclonically around the low center, and remaining in the lower troposphere (the cyclonic path). To clarify the path of <b>the</b> cold <b>conveyor</b> belt, <b>the</b> present study reexamines Carlson’s analysis of <b>the</b> cold <b>conveyor</b> belt using an observational and mesoscale numerical modeling study of the 5 December 1977 cyclone. This reexamination raises several previously unappreciated and underappreciated issues. First, airflow {{in the vicinity of the}} warm front is shown to be composed of three different airstreams: air-parcel trajectories belonging to <b>the</b> ascending warm <b>conveyor</b> belt, air-parcel trajectories belonging to the cyclonic path of <b>the</b> cold <b>conveyor</b> belt that originate from the lower troposphere, and air-parcel trajectories belonging to the anticyclonic path of <b>the</b> cold <b>conveyor</b> belt that originate within the midtroposphere.

25|$|Tectonic {{plates are}} {{composed}} of oceanic lithosphere and thicker continental lithosphere, each topped by its own kind of crust. Along convergent boundaries, subduction, or one plate moving under another, carries the lower one down into the mantle; the material lost is roughly balanced by the formation of new (oceanic) crust along divergent margins by seafloor spreading. In this way, the total surface of the lithosphere remains the same. This prediction of plate tectonics is {{also referred to as}} <b>the</b> <b>conveyor</b> belt principle.
