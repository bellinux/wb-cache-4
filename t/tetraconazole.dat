5000|$|Cercospora {{leaf spot}} infects sugarbeets by {{overwintering}} {{in the soil}} from the year's previous crop. It can survive {{up to two years}} without a sugarbeet crop being planted. Once attached to the plant the fungus penetrates the tissue and begins to infect and kill nearby tissue. As the disease progresses these individual rotted spots begin to come together to form massive areas of dead tissue. This causes severely infected leaves to eventually die. The plant responds by attempting to re-grow the leaf and using nutrients within the plant. This results in lowered sugar content and stunted growth. Losses due to the disease can be as high as 42%.

Before lowering the existing MRLs on pome fruits from 0. 3 mg/kg to 0. 2 mg/kg, grapes from 0. 5 mg/kg to 0. 07 mg/kg and wheat from 0. 1 mg/kg to and 0. 04 mg/kg, Germany suggested awaiting the finalisation of the ongoing review of the existing MRLs of <b>tetraconazole,</b> whereas they proposed to raise the existing MRLs in the liver of swine and ruminants from 1 mg/kg to 1. 5 mg/kg and 2 mg/kg, respectively. Germany drafted an evaluation report in {{accordance with}} Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 396 / 2005, which was submitted to the European Commission and forwarded to EFSA. According to EFSA the data are sufficient to derive a MRL proposal of 0. 2 mg/kg on apples, 0. 07 mg/kg on grapes and 0. 02 mg/kg (LOQ) on wheat. Before the MRLs are lowered it should be confirmed that no more critical GAPs are currently authorised at EU level for these crops. Taking into account the intended and the existing uses of <b>tetraconazole,</b> EFSA proposes to raise to 1. 5 mg/kg and 3 mg/kg the existing MRLs for swine and ruminant liver, respectively. The data also support the lowering of the existing MRLs in swine, bovine, sheep and goats meat, fat and kidney and in ruminant milk. Adequate analytical enforcement methods are available to control the residues of <b>tetraconazole</b> in the commodities under consideration. Based on the risk assessment results, EFSA concludes that the proposed uses of <b>tetraconazole</b> on the crops under consideration will not result in a consumer exposure exceeding the toxicological reference values for <b>tetraconazole</b> and therefore is unlikely to pose a consumer health risk...|$|E

In particular, imibenconazole, triflumizole and hexaconazole showed RORγ inverse agonistic activity at concentrations of 10 ^[- 6] M. However, unlike T 0901317, these fungicides failed to show any LXRα/β agonistic activity. Next, five azole-type fungicides, showing ROR inverse agonist activity, were tested on IL- 17 mRNA expression in mouse T lymphoma EL 4 cells treated with phorbol myristate acetate and ionomycin. The quantitative RT-PCR analysis revealed that these fungicides suppressed the expression of IL- 17 mRNA without effecting RORα and RORγ mRNA levels. In addition, the inhibitory effect of imibenconazole {{as well as that of}} T 0901317 was absorbed in RORα/γ-knocked down EL 4 cells. Taken together, these results suggest that some azole-type fungicides inhibit IL- 17 production via RORα/γ. This also provides the first evidence that environmental chemicals can act as modulators of IL- 17 expression in immune cells...|$|E
40|$|Rainfall-induced {{peaks in}} {{pesticide}} concentrations can occur rapidly. Low frequency sampling may therefore largely underestimate maximum pesticide concentrations and fluxes. Detailed storm-based sampling of pesticide concentrations in runoff water to better predict pesticide sources, transport pathways and toxicity within the headwater catchments is lacking. High frequency monitoring (2  min) of seven pesticides (Dimetomorph, Fluopicolide, Glyphosate, Iprovalicarb, Tebuconazole, <b>Tetraconazole</b> and Triadimenol) and one degradation product (AMPA) were assessed for 20 runoff events from 2009 to 2012 at the outlet of a vineyard catchment in the Layon catchment in France. The maximum pesticide concentrations were 387  μg L−  1. Samples {{from all of}} the runoff events exceeded the legal limit of 0. 1  μg L−  1 for at least one pesticide (European directive 2013 / 39 /EC). High resolution sampling used to detect the peak pesticide levels revealed that Toxic Units (TU) for algae, invertebrates and fish often exceeded the European Uniform principles (25 %). The point and average (time or discharge-weighted) concentrations indicated up to a 30 - or 4 -fold underestimation of the TU obtained when measuring the maximum concentrations, respectively. This highlights the important role of sampling methods for assessing peak exposure. High resolution sampling combined with concentration-discharge hysteresis analyses revealed that clockwise responses were predominant (52 %), indicating that Hortonian runoff is the prevailing surface runoff trigger mechanism in the study catchment. The hysteresis patterns for suspended solids and pesticides were highly dynamic and storm- and chemical-dependent. Intense rainfall events induced stronger C-Q hysteresis (magnitude). This study provides new insights into the complexity of pesticide dynamics in runoff water and highlights the ability of hysteresis analysis to improve understanding of pesticide supply and transport...|$|E
40|$|Imidacloprid is {{the most}} widely used {{insecticide}} in agriculture. In this study, we used feeding methods to simulate in-hive exposures of formulated imidacloprid (Advise® 2 FL) alone and mixtures with six representative pesticides for different classes. Advise, fed at 4. 3 mg/L (equal to maximal residue detection of 912 ppb active ingredient [a. i. ] in pollen) induced 36 % mortality and 56 % feeding suppression after 2 -week feeding. Treatments with individual Bracket (acephate), Karate (λ-cyhalothrin), Vydate (oxamyl), Domark (<b>tetraconazole),</b> and Roundup (glyphosate) at residue level had a mortality range of 1. 3 - 13. 3 %, statistically similar to that of control (P> 0. 05). The additive/synergistic toxicity was not detected from binary mixtures of Advise with different classes of pesticides at residue levels. The feeding of the mixture of all seven pesticides increased mortality to 53 %, significantly higher than Advise only but still without synergism. Enzymatic data showed that activities of invertase, glutathione S-transferase, and acetylcholinesterase activities in imidacloprid-treated survivors were mostly similar to those found in control. Esterase activity mostly increased, but was significantly suppressed by Bracket (acephate). The immunity-related phenoloxidase activity in imidacloprid-treated survivors tended to be lower, but most treatments were statistically similar to the control. Increase of cytochrome P 450 activity was correlated with Advise concentrations and reached significant difference at 56 mg/L (12 ppm a. i.). Our data demonstrated that residue levels of seven pesticide in pollens/hive may not adversely affect honey bees, but long term exclusive ingestion of the maximal residue levels of imidacloprid (912 ppb) and sulfoxaflor (3 ppm a. i.) may induce substantial bee mortality. Rotating with other insecticides is a necessary and practical way to reduce the residue level of any given pesticide...|$|E
40|$|Imidacloprid is {{the most}} widely used {{insecticide}} in the world. In this study, we used spraying methods to simulate field exposures of bees to formulated imidacloprid (Advise® 2 FL) alone and binary mixtures with seven pesticides from different classes. Synergistic toxicity was detected from mixtures of Advise (58. 6 mg a. i. /L imidacloprid) +Domark (512. 5 mg a. i. /L <b>tetraconazole),</b> Advise+Transform (58. 5 mg a. i. /L sulfoxaflor), and Advise+Vydate (68 mg a. i. /L oxamyl), and mortality was significantly increased by 20 %, 15 %, and 26 % respectively. The mixtures of Advise+Bracket (88. 3 mg a. i. /L acephate) and Advise+Karate (62. 2 mg a. i. /L L-cyhalothrin) showed additive interaction, while Advise+Belay (9. 4 mg a. i. /L clothianidin) and Advise+Roundup (1217. 5 mg a. i. /L glyphosate) had no additive/synergistic interaction. Spraying bees with the mixture of all eight pesticides increased mortality to 100 %, significantly higher than all other treatments. Except Bracket which significantly suppressed esterase and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activities, other treatments of Advise-only and mixtures with other pesticides did not suppress enzyme activities significantly, including invertase, glutathione S-transferase (GST), and esterase and AChE. Immunity-related phenoloxidase (PO) activities in survivors tended to be more variable among treatments, but mostly still statistically similar to the control. By using specific enzyme inhibitors, we demonstrated that honey bees mainly rely on cytochrome P 450 monooxygenases (P 450 s) for detoxifying Advise, while esterases and GSTs play substantially less roles in the detoxification. This study provided valuable information for guiding pesticide selection in premixing and tank mixing in order to alleviate toxicity risk to honey bees. Our findings indicated mixtures of Advise with detoxification-enzyme-inducing pesticides may help bees to detoxify Advise, while toxicity synergists may pose further risk to bees, such as the Bracket which not only suppressed esterase and AChE activities, but also increased toxicity to bees...|$|E
40|$|The “Australasian-type ” of soybean rust, Phakopsora pachyrhizi, {{has been}} known to devastate {{soybeans}} since the beginning of last century, however, until fairly recently it has been restricted to South East Asia, India and Australia. In the late 1990 s, it entered Africa and thereafter moved down the continent to severely reduce commercial production, until good fungicidal control limited yield loss. In 2001, P. pachyrhizi was discovered in South America where it has since caused acute yield loss. This presence alerted the United States Department of Agriculture to develop a coordinated national action plan to counter soybean rust prior to its arrival in the United States. Under this plan, fungicide studies are to be done in countries where soybean rust is prevalent by international collaborators, so that suitable fungicides may be registered for control of the pathogen once it arrives. This report details an experiment involving an evaluation of eight fungicides, either sprayed two or three times on a soybean cv. planted at three sites in Zimbabwe during the 2002 - 03 summer. This season was unfortunately characterized by below-normal rainfall. Rust symptoms were only appeared at two sites on unsprayed plants after early pod-fill (a late infection), and on plants sprayed twice with mancozeb, propiconazole, BAS 500, BAS 516 and chlorothalonil at the Gwebi site. The disease did not cause net yield loss at these sites, but did cause significant kernel mass reductions. Spraying was shown to effectively improve the kernel mass, with BAS 500, BAS 516, <b>tetraconazole,</b> and chlorothalonil, the most consistently effective. Despite these results, no firm conclusion can be drawn about the relative fungicide efficacies- the late arrival of P. pachyrhizi, the low resulting rust severity and the lack of correlation between the yield components negating a determination. The experiment needs to be repeated under higher disease pressure in wetter conditions, as previously experienced at these sites...|$|E

40|$|O tratamento de sementes tem como objetivo tradicional erradicar ou reduzir os fungos associados às sementes, além de protegê-las de patógenos presentes no solo. Algumas doenças que ocorrem na parte área das plantas podem ser manejadas através do tratamento das sementes com produtos sistêmicos. Essa forma de controle tem sido utilizada há muitos anos, visando o controle de fungos biotróficos em arroz e trigo. A ferrugem asiática da soja é a {{principal}} doença que ataca a cultura, a qual necessita de ferramentas eficientes para seu manejo. O objetivo desta dissertação foi verificar a contribuição do tratamento de sementes de soja com produtos fitossanitários no manejo da ferrugem asiática. Desta forma, produtos fitossanitários foram aplicados às sementes de soja em diferentes doses, a fim de se verificar os efeitos fitotóxicos sobre sementes e plântulas que eventualmente fossem causados pelos mesmos. As maiores doses não fitotóxicas de cada tratamento foram selecionadas, novamente aplicadas às sementes e distribuídas em campo experimental, onde se verificou o efeito do tratamento das sementes isoladamente ou com a aplicação foliar de fungicidas foliares, no manejo da ferrugem asiática da soja. Ciproconazol + azoxistrobina (10, 0 + 25, 0 g i. a. / 100 kg de sementes), difenoconazol (50, 0), epoxiconazol (2, 5), fluquinconazol (50, 0), flutriafol (10, 0), flutriafol TS (5, 0), flutriafol + tiofanato metílico (10, 0 + 50, 0), tebuconazol (10, 0), tebuconazol + trifloxistrobina (10, 0 + 5, 0), tetraconazol (10, 0), triticonazol (25, 0), acibenzolar-S-methyl (50, 0) e pó de rocha (2, 0) não apresentaram fitotoxicidade e foram comparados em campo. Ciproconazol + azoxistrobina (25, 0 + 10, 0 g i. a. / 100 kg de sementes) e epoxiconazol (2, 5) diminuíram a emergência das plântulas de soja em campo. No ensaio somente com tratamento de sementes, sem aplicação de fungicida foliar, tebuconazol e tebuconazol + trifloxistrobina diminuíram a ferrugem asiática em plantas de soja. Quando se integrou a pulverização foliar de fungicidas, fluquinconazol, tebuconazol e tebuconazol + trifloxistrobina, diminuíram a severidade da ferrugem asiática da soja. Apesar de não aumentar o rendimento da cultura, o tratamento de sementes pode contribuir no manejo da ferrugem asiática da soja, mantendo a segurança e o rendimento do produtor. Seed treatment has as traditional objective to eradicate or to reduce fungi associated with seeds {{and to protect}} them from soilborne pathogens. Some diseases that occur in the aerial part of plants may be managed through seed treatment with systemic products. This kind of control has been used for many years, aiming the control of biotrophic fungi in rice and wheat. Soybeanś asian rust is the main disease that attacks the culture, which needs efficient tools for its management. The objective {{of this study was to}} verify the contribution of soybean seed treatment with phytosanitary products in the management of asian rust. In this case, phytosanitary products were applied to soybean seeds in different doses, aiming to verify the phytotoxicity effects onto seeds and seedlings that eventually would be caused by these products. The highest non phytotoxic doses of each treatment were selected, applied again to seeds and these were distributed on experimental field, where it was verified the effect of each seed treatment with and without foliar application of fungicides, in the management of soybeanś asian rust. Ciproconazol + azoxystrobin (10, 0 + 25, 0 g a. i. / 100 kg of seeds), difenoconazol (50, 0), epoxiconazol (2, 5), fluquinconazole (50, 0), flutriafol (10, 0), flutriafol TS (5, 0), flutriafol + thiophanate-methyl (10, 0 + 50, 0), tebuconazole (10, 0), tebuconazole + trifloxystrobin (10, 0 + 5, 0), <b>tetraconazole</b> (10, 0), triticonazole (25, 0), acibenzolar-S-methyl (50, 0) and rock powder (2, 0) did not present phytotoxicity and were compared in field. Ciproconazol + azoxystrobin (25, 0 + 10, 0 g a. i. / 100 kg of seeds) and epoxiconazol (2, 5) decreased the seedlingś emergency in field. In the experiment with only seed treatment, with no foliar fungicide application, tebuconazole and tebuconazole + trifloxystrobin decreased asian rust in soybean plants. When the application of foliar fungicide was integrated, fluquinconazole, tebuconazole and tebuconazole + trifloxystrobin the asian rust severity decreased.

40|$|The {{chemical}} control {{is the main}} strategy for controlling the soybean asian rust. Thus, information about the efficiency of fungicides {{as well as the}} residual effect on seeds are needed to guide its correct use in the field. The aim of this work was to evaluate the efficiency of different active ingredients to control the asian rust, as well as their influence on the physiological and sanitary quality of soybean seeds. The experiment was conducted in Mafra, SC, in the 2010 / 2011 growing season, using the cultivars Syngenta 3358 RR and Nidera 6411 RR. The experimental design was randomized blocks with four replications of 14 treatments for the Syngenta cultivar and 15 treatments for the Nidera cultivar. The evaluated active ingredients were: tebuconazole (0, 5 L p. c. ha- 1), cyproconazole (0, 3 L p. c. ha- 1), azoxystrobin + cyproconazole (0, 3 L p. c. ha- 1) + Nimbus 0, 5 %v/v, pyraclostrobin + epoxiconazole (0, 5 L p. c. ha- 1) + Assist 0, 5 L. ha- 1, trifloxystrobin + tebuconazole (0, 5 L p. c. ha- 1) + Aureate 0, 5 L. ha- 1, picoxystrobin + cyproconazole (0, 3 L p. c. ha- 1) + Nimbus 0, 45 L. ha- 1, trifloxystrobin + cyproconazole (0, 15 L p. c. ha- 1) + Aureate 0, 5 L. ha- 1, azoxystrobin + <b>tetraconazole</b> (0, 5 L p. c. ha- 1) + Nimbus 0, 5 L. ha- 1, trifloxystrobin + prothioconazole (0, 4 L p. c. ha- 1) + Aureate 0, 4 L. ha- 1, pyraclostrobin + metconazole (0, 5 L p. c. ha- 1) + Assist 0, 5 L. ha- 1, pyraclostrobin + epoxiconazole (0, 6 L p. c. ha- 1) + Lanzar 0, 3 %v/v, azoxystrobin (0, 35 L p. c. ha- 1) + Assist 0, 5 %v/v, azoxystrobin + tebuconazole (0, 5 L p. c. ha- 1) + Assist 0, 5 %v/v, oxicarboxim (1, 2 L p. c. ha- 1) + Silwett 0, 05 %. The fungicides were applied at flowering (R 2 stage) and {{at the beginning of the}} grain formation (R 5. 2 stage). It was evaluated: rust severity at seven and 14 days after the second fungicide application; yield (kg ha- 1), thousand seed weight (g), germination (%), electrical conductivity (µS. cm- 1. g- 1), accelerated aging (%), and seed health, through the Blotter Test. The results indicate that the triazole fungicides combined with strobilurins are more effective in controlling the asian rust. Fungicides do not affect in the physiological and sanitary quality of seeds of both cultivars.
