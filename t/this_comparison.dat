25|$|In {{the hub of}} {{the wheel}} are three animals: a pig, a snake, and a bird. They {{represent}} the three poisons of ignorance, aversion, and attachment, respectively. The pig stands for ignorance; <b>this</b> <b>comparison</b> is based on the Indian concept of a pig being the most foolish of animals, since it sleeps in the dirtiest places and eats whatever comes to its mouth. The snake represents aversion or anger; this is because it will be aroused and strike at the slightest touch. The bird represents attachment (also translated as desire or clinging). The particular bird used in this diagram represents an Indian bird that is very attached to its partner. These three animals represent the three poisons, which are the core of the bhavacakra. From these three poisons, the whole cycle of existence evolves.|$|E
25|$|In {{the initial}} setup, every {{detected}} neutrino {{would have been}} produced sometime in a 10,500nanoseconds (10.5microseconds) range, since this was {{the duration of the}} proton beam spill generating the neutrinos. It was not possible to isolate neutrino production time further within the spill. Therefore, in their main statistical analyses, the OPERA group generated a model of the proton waveforms at CERN, took the various waveforms together, and plotted the chance of neutrinos being emitted at various times (the global probability density function of the neutrino emission times). They then compared this plot against a plot of the arrival times of the 15,223 detected neutrinos. <b>This</b> <b>comparison</b> indicated neutrinos had arrived at the detector 57.8nanoseconds faster than if they had been traveling {{at the speed of light}} in vacuum. An alternative analysis in which each detected neutrino was checked against the waveform of its associated proton spill (instead of against the global probability density function) led to a compatible result of approximately 54.5nanoseconds.|$|E

25|$|Due to his {{prolific}} goalscoring, consistency, {{and spectacular}} strikes, Ibrahimović is regarded {{by many in}} the sport {{to be one of the}} best players in the world and one of the most complete strikers of his generation; he has also drawn praise from managers and teammates for his leadership and longevity, as well as his fitness, professionalism, and dedication in training. Although he has been criticised for his work-rate in big matches, in particular in his youth, throughout his career he has scored in some of the biggest matches in football, including the Milan Derby in Italy, El Clásico in Spain, Le Classique in France, and the Manchester Derby and North-West Derby in England, as well as in UEFA Champions League and UEFA Euro Championship games, against some of the strongest opponents in football, also winning titles in several different countries; he is the only player to have scored for six different clubs in the Champions League. Known for his extroverted personality, despite his reputation as a footballer, he has been criticised, however, for his arrogance, aggression and rebellious character at times. Ibrahimović has frequently been compared to Dutch legend Marco van Basten, due to their similar playing style and proclivity for scoring from powerful shots and volleys; despite <b>this</b> <b>comparison,</b> Ibrahimović has stated that his main influence was his idol, former Brazilian superstar Ronaldo, whom he regards as the greatest player of all time.|$|E
25|$|Although Behn assures {{that she}} is not looking to {{entertain}} her reader with the adventures of a feigned hero, she does exactly this to enhance and romanticize the stories of Oroonoko. Ramesh Mallipeddi stresses that spectacle was the main mediator for the representation of alien cultures in Restoration England. Therefore, Behn describes Oroonoko’s native beauty as a spectacle of 'beauty so transcending' that surpassed 'all those of his gloomy race'. She completely romanticizes Oroonoko’s figure by portraying him as an ideal handsome hero; however due to the color of his skin, his body is still constricted within the limits of exoticism. Oroonoko has all the qualities of an English royal, but his ebony skin and country of origin prevent him from being a reputable European citizen. Due to these foreign qualities, his Englishness is incomplete. He has the English-like education and air, but lacks the skin color and legal status. Behn uses this conflicting description of Oroonoko to infuse some European familiarity into his figure while still remaining exotic enough. She compares Oroonoko to well-known historical figures like Hannibal and Alexander and describes Oroonoko’s running, wrestling and killing of tigers and snakes. Albert J. Rivero states that <b>this</b> <b>comparison</b> to great Western conquerors and kings translates and naturalizes Oroonoko’s foreignness into familiar European narratives. These historical allusions and romantic gallant feats allowed English readers to relate this exotic character with their own Western history and narrative tradition.|$|E
