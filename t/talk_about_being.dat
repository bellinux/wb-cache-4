It was released on December 2, 2008, by Jive Records as the second single from the album. Written by Dr. Luke, Claude Kelly and Benny Blanco, [...] "Circus" [...] is a metaphor for the public's perception of Spears' life.

[...] "Circus" [...] is an uptempo electropop and dance-pop song with elements of pop rock and [...] "half-rapped" [...] vocals.

[...] "Just Dance" [...] talks about being intoxicated in a party, with lyrics like [...] "What's going on on the floor? / I love this record, baby but I can't see straight anymore".

500|$|During {{his initial}} audition, Johnston {{claimed that he}} was bullied and victimised {{from the age of}} six because of his singing. When asked how he dealt with the issue, he stated [...] "I carry on singing." [...] There were claims in the Daily Mail, a UK-based tabloid newspaper, that the programme's {{producers}} had deliberately overstated the extent of Johnston's bullying as a [...] "sob story", suggesting that sympathy rather than his singing got him many of the votes. However, in The Times, Johnston's success story was described as [...] "the stuff of fairytales", as he was successful despite having been raised in [...] "poverty". Johnston said he did not <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>being</b> bullied because he was told to do so by producers, but [...] "because I believed it would help people who were going through what I had gone through be stronger". Johnston has subsequently visited schools and elsewhere to help other victims of bullying. He said [...] "I want to use my experience of bullies to help other kids".|$|E
2500|$|Stone was {{introduced}} to Gary Kellgren, a recording engineer working at several New York City recording studios on sessions for musicians such as Frank Zappa and Jimi Hendrix. Stone and Kellgren met because Kellgren's wife Marta was seven months pregnant and scared of the upcoming birth. Mutual friends thought that the two couples could <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>being</b> parents and ease Marta's worry. Though they were [...] "diametrically opposed" [...] in nature, with Stone all business and Kellgren very creative, the two quickly became friends. During his lunch hours, Stone visited Kellgren in the studio, and {{began to see that}} Kellgren was not making full use of his genius. Stone noticed that Kellgren was getting only 4 percent of the money that studios were charging, and he helped Kellgren raise that to 20 percent.|$|E

We lost, and we'll see what happens in the off-season." [...] As the interview session went on, he eventually became emotional and left the clubhouse area to compose himself. Girardi said, [...] "This guy, when you look at what he did in this series, he was awesome. He's had a tremendous career, and I'm sure he's going to continue to play, and I don't know what's going to happen." [...] Girardi added, [...] "But you <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>being</b> proud of players — what he went through this year and what he gave us in the postseason, I don't think there's a prouder moment that I've had of Jorge." ...|$|E

Lady Julia wishes it. You would be doing what everybody about you wants you to do. And why should you not do it? It isn't that you dislike me.

Or say you've swung a deal and have to pay your rent and office force, and you can't get the commission that's due you on an accomplished sale. And your clerks dash in and want a raise, under threat of quitting, just at the moment when you're wondering how you'll raise the money to pay them their present salaries on time!

You <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>being</b> cut to a pattern--well, ain't the pattern all right? When you're in Rome you've got to do as the Dagoes do. This town {{seems to me to}} have other alleged metropolises skinned to flag stations. According to the railroad schedule I've got in mind, Chicago and Saint Jo and Paris, France, are asterisk stops--which means you wave a red flag and get on every other Tuesday. I like this little suburb of Tarrytown-on-the-Hudson. There's something or somebody doing all the time. I'm clearing $8,000 a year selling automatic pumps, and I'm living like kings-up. Why, yesterday, I was introduced to John W. Gates. I took an auto ride with a wine agent's sister. I saw two men run over by a street car, and I seen Edna May play in the evening. Talk about the West, why, the other night I woke everybody up in the hotel hollering. I dreamed I was walking on a board sidewalk in Oshkosh. What have you got against this town, Jack? There's only one thing in it that I don't care for, and that's a ferryboat." ...|$|E
