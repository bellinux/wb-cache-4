25|$|Negotiations {{to find a}} {{solution}} to <b>the</b> <b>Cyprus</b> <b>problem</b> have been taking place on and off since 1964. Between 1974 and 2002, the Turkish Cypriot side was seen by the international community as the side refusing a balanced solution. Since 2002, the situation has been reversed according to US and UK officials, and the Greek Cypriot side rejected a plan which would have called for the dissolution of the Republic of Cyprus without guarantees that the Turkish occupation forces would be removed. The latest Annan Plan to reunify the island which was endorsed by the United States, United Kingdom and Turkey was accepted by a referendum by Turkish Cypriots but overwhelmingly rejected in parallel referendum by Greek Cypriots, after the Greek Cypriot Leadership and Greek Orthodox Church urged the Greek population to vote No.|$|E
25|$|Turkey's {{accession}} talks {{have since been}} stalled {{by a number of}} domestic and external problems. Both Austria and France have said they would hold a referendum on Turkey's accession. In the case of France, a change in its Constitution was made to impose such a referendum, but later another constitutional change has enabled the parliament (if a large majority of its members agrees) to prevent such a referendum. The issue of Cyprus continues to be a major obstacle to negotiations. European officials have commented on the slowdown in Turkish reforms which, combined with <b>the</b> <b>Cyprus</b> <b>problem,</b> led the EU’s Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn in March 2007 to warn of an impending ‘train crash’ in the negotiations. Due to these setbacks, negotiations again came to a halt in December 2006, with the EU freezing talks in 8 of the 35 key areas under negotiation.|$|E

However, he stated that he did not think that the lack of representation of women as negotiators had been a factor in the lack of solution in Cyprus, and blamed the Greek Cypriot side as a [...] "block" [...] against a fair solution. He claimed that the Greek Cypriots did not approach a fair solution because they wanted to keep [...] "abusing" [...] the title of the Republic of Cyprus that they [...] "usurped" [...] unilaterally.|$|E
2500|$|The 2005 EU Progress Report stated that: [...] "On 29 July 2005, Turkey {{signed the}} Additional Protocol {{adapting}} the EC Turkey Association Agreement to the accession of 10 new countries on 1 May 2004. At the same time, Turkey issued a declaration stating that {{signature of the}} Additional Protocol did not amount to recognition of the Republic of Cyprus. On 21 September, the EU adopted a counter-declaration indicating that Turkey’s declaration was unilateral, did not form part of the Protocol and had no legal effect on Turkey’s obligations under the Protocol. The EU declaration stressed that recognition of all Member States was a necessary component of the accession process.

2500|$|On the Christmas Eve of 1963, intercommunal clashes {{broke out}} in Cyprus.

A [...] "peace-making force" [...] established under British command was unable {{to put an end}} to the fighting, and a conference on Cyprus held in London in January 1964 ended in disagreement. On 4 March 1964, amid the danger of broader hostilities, the Security Council unanimously authorized Thant to establish a UN Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP), with a limited three-month mandate to prevent the recurrence of fightings and to restore order. The Council further asked the secretary-general to appoint a mediator to seek a peaceful settlement of <b>the</b> <b>Cyprus</b> <b>problem.</b> Thant appointed Galo Plaza Lasso as mediator but when his report was rejected by Turkey in March 1965, Plaza resigned and the function of mediator lapsed.|$|E

40|$|In December 2002 the EU Member States {{announced}} that if by December 2004 Turkey {{would meet the}} criteria set by Copenhagen European Council, accession negotiations would start “without delay”. This decision comes forty after the pre-accension agreement – the association agreement signed in Ankara in 1963 – and almost twenty years after the official request for accession, presented by Turkey in 1987. Although the Copenhagen criteria set requisites to be met by each candidate Country both on an economic and political level, {{in the case of}} Turkey the political aspects prevailed. In fact, given its size, comparable to Germany’s, and its cultural roots, the perspective of an enlargement to Turkey opened, since the beginning, a wide debate on the future identity of the European union, still in fieri.

The accentuation of existing patriarchal structures and essentialist gender role binarisms by masculinist and heteronormative nationalist discourses is a prevalent phenomenon in Cyprus, as it in other locales that face analogous ethnonational problems. However, a preliminary glance at filmic spaces suggests that in Cypriot films women assume diverse and significant roles, which both intensify and emasculate predominant discourses. This chapter evaluates gender issues in Cypriot films from the 1960 s to the 2010 s and examines the possible significance of filmic spaces as areas where alternative constructions of female subjectivity and agency could be negotiated. It examines films based on three categories of female subjectivities and women’s agency – or lack thereof: a) women-as-victims of predominant discourses, b) women as (co) perpetrators of predominant discourses and c) women as agents...|$|R

40|$|In <b>the</b> European Union, <b>Cyprus's</b> <b>problems</b> are not new; {{the country}} {{has a long history}} of {{instability}} and war. Ten years later, the same debate is being held all over again, just from a different point of view. Cyprus is emblematic of this current financial crisis because the banking system is much bigger than GDP. Concerns about the sluggish economic performance aside, as well as the usual gap between northern and southern regions, people are ill at ease with the EU. Getting the European Union to finance a deficit is very tempting because it seems to be a politically and socially painless option, but can we count on the EU to devise such a smoothly running system? Cyprus’ case is interesting on many levels, from the debate concerning the limits of cohesion policy to the need of finding new solutions for helping the economies of the European periphery. It raises the question of whether a real fiscal and politic union is possible, in light of the actual geoeconomics and geopolitical dynamics between the EU, Turkey and Russia. The aim of this paper is to explore the possible mechanisms for a convergence and integration of Cyprus in order to go beyond fiscal burden sharing, and considers a new approach to reduce regional disparities that takes into consideration local details. Something considered to be an important starting point to paving the way to new policies and outlining strategies in the search for real convergence involving changes in the objectives of economic convergence...|$|R
