5|$|The Wembley Stadium {{scene in}} the film 28 Weeks Later was {{actually}} filmed at the Millennium Stadium. Although the outside is footage of Wembley, the inside is all filmed in Cardiff. The effects team on the film edited the footage <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>look</b> more like Wembley.|$|E
5|$|The mule, {{especially}} its fur, was intensely textured and detailed <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>look</b> visually rough and bristly, and the mule itself weary and worn. The same techniques {{were applied to}} the red and yellow adornments draped and hung over the animal.|$|E
5|$|Gandhi {{joined the}} Indian National Congress and was {{introduced}} to Indian issues, politics and the Indian people primarily by Gokhale. Gokhale was a key leader of the Congress Party {{best known for his}} restraint and moderation, and his insistence on working inside the system. Gandhi took Gokhale's liberal approach based on British Whiggish traditions and transformed it <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>look</b> Indian.|$|E

"For my project, {{there are}} two inspirations, the one is I think I really need to express {{something}} about culture in my design, {{try to find the}} culture meanings from Chinese folk art, actually, it is not hard, because Chinese folk art related with culture very close. The other thing is I should think about how <b>to</b> <b>make</b> my artwork more related with people’s daily life, I should try <b>to</b> <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> like a thing in nowadays." ...|$|R

50|$|FaceApp is {{a mobile}} {{application}} for iOS and Android developed by Russian company Wireless Lab which uses neural network technology to automatically generate highly realistic transformations of faces in photographs. The app can transform a face <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> smile, <b>look</b> younger, look older, or even change gender. FaceApp was launched on iOS in January 2017 and on Android in February 2017.|$|R
5|$|Ono later bought 'Mendips' {{and donated}} it to The National Trust. It was renovated <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>look</b> {{as it was}} in the 1950s when Lennon lived there, and Ono paid a visit before it was opened to the public. Lennon's cousin, Michael Cadwallader, had advised the National Trust on how the house looked when the Smiths lived there.|$|E
5|$|Around 1800 three folly walls {{had been}} added to the {{existing}} ruined walls {{on the east side of}} the castle <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>look</b> more impressive from Norton Priory, the home of SirRichard Brooke. One of these walls was demolished around 1906. During the Victorian era a sunken garden and two bowling greens were constructed within the castle enclosure. In 1977 the castle was leased to Halton Borough Council. In 1986–87 the site of the castle was excavated.|$|E
5|$|Deimatic {{behaviour}} {{is found}} in cephalopods including the common cuttlefish Sepia officinalis, squid such as the Caribbean reef squid (Sepioteuthis sepioidea) and bigfin reef squid (Sepioteuthis lessoniana), octopuses including the common octopus Octopus vulgaris and the Atlantic white-spotted octopus (Octopus macropus), and the paper nautilus (Argonauta argo). Deimatic cephalopod displays involve suddenly creating bold stripes, often reinforced by stretching out the animal's arms, fins or web <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>look</b> as big and threatening as possible.|$|E
50|$|Looking at the {{statistics}} might suggest this game was close, but Nebraska was comfortably leading 31-0 in the 4th when Cornhusker reserves {{took over and}} allowed Colorado to put up some numbers of their own <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> not <b>look</b> so bad. Despite nearly matched final offensive yardage and first down totals, the Buffaloes were unable to overcome a painful 1-5 turnover deficit.|$|R
50|$|In {{the final}} scene when Catlan is crushed by the Dallas defense (actually portrayed by Saints players Mike Tilleman, Dave Rowe and Fred Whittingham), neither Heston nor the {{producer}} felt the hit on him was realistic enough, so Heston asked them to cut loose <b>to</b> really <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>look</b> authentic. On the second take, the trio slammed the actor to the ground, breaking three of his ribs.|$|R
5000|$|In [...] "Todd Packer", after Pam gets Andy a new {{computer}} and they scratch it up as <b>to</b> not <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>look</b> brand new, Pam claims that she {{found it in the}} warehouse. Darryl subtly confronts Pam later regarding finding the computer in the warehouse. As he knows everything that's in the warehouse and where, he leverages Pam into giving him more sick days.|$|R
5|$|For {{scenes in}} the film that {{featured}} the moon in the background, a circle was drawn on a screen which was lit <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>look</b> like the moon. Though having other lights were not possible, Bartley made sure that all the characters in such scenes had their shadows away from the moon. Despite this, many of the transformations of elements in this film were shown using dissolve techniques. No lights were hidden behind the painted moon, {{as a source for}} lighting.|$|E
5|$|Hugo Weaving, who {{portrayed the}} Red Skull, wore a latex mask {{conceived}} by prosthetic makeup designer David White. The visual effects team had to manipulate his face considerably, as the mask was bulky {{and they wanted}} <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>look</b> like tight skin wrapped around a very bony structure. They thinned out Weaving's cheeks and lower lip, hollowed out his eyes, and removed his eyelashes and nose to make him appear more like the Red Skull character.|$|E
5|$|Inside {{the truck}} Monk sees a broken Turkish figurine and remembers the vacuum bag was empty. He deduces that Teresa, while {{cleaning}} Merrigan's office, broke a figurine, which contained heroin. When Merrigan saw the broken figurine {{he realized that}} the vacuum bag was filled with heroin. When he found the drug on the vacuum bag, he killed Teresa. He spread the patient files and later he threw a rock at Dr. Kroger's house <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>look</b> like the killer was one of Dr. Kroger's patients.|$|E
5000|$|The Times of India panned the film, as {{they felt}} that it was [...] "far too content being plain and passable. Replete with amateur jokes, the writing is worse than that of {{laughter}} shows." [...] The Free Press Journal also criticized BHK Bhalla@Halla.com, writing that it was [...] "A threadbare situational comedy that tries hard <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> all <b>look</b> funny but fails miserably." ...|$|R
25|$|Before the {{cancellation}} of the Goodson-Todman game show Snap Judgment on NBC in 1969, that program's set was changed in order <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> resemble the <b>look</b> of the CBS Password. Goodson-Todman did this to correspond to rule changes that, in fact, made Snap Judgment identical to Password.|$|R
50|$|Players use the laptops {{to input}} their {{decisions}} into the game. Thus, two (or more) persons can play one role together, though this means {{they will use}} the same laptop. <b>To</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> easier <b>to</b> <b>look</b> up information during the game, each team is also given a reference document containing all of the customer and strategy information.|$|R
5|$|The boat chase {{was another}} scene that {{required}} very little CGI. Machine FX worked on replacing {{a few shots}} of visible stuntmen with a digital version of Craig's head, and recreated the boats Bond jumps over on his motorcycle <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>look</b> more dangerous. Crowd creation was done for the Tosca scene by Machine FX, to make the performance look like it had sold out. Forster edited the opera scene to resemble The Man Who Knew Too Much. In total, there are 900+ visual effects shots in Quantum of Solace.|$|E
5|$|Though set in {{the modern}} day, the film uses various {{unconventional}} techniques to make the films look like those that were shown in grindhouse theaters in the 1970s. Throughout both feature-length segments and the fake trailers, the film is intentionally damaged <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>look</b> {{like many of the}} exploitation films of the 1970s, which were generally shipped around from theater to theater and usually ended up in bad shape. To reproduce the look of damaged film reels in Planet Terror, five of the six 25,000-frame reels were edited with real film damage, plug-ins, and stock footage.|$|E
5|$|To this end, {{a crew of}} 12 {{prepared}} a ship that had been seized in Gibraltar. They disguised vertical logs of wood with headwear, to make the Spaniards believe that the vessel was fully crewed. <b>To</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>look</b> more heavily armed, additional portholes were cut in the hull and logs placed to resemble cannons. Barrels of powder {{were placed in the}} ship and grappling irons laced into the ships rigging, to catch the ropes and sails of Magdalen and ensure the vessels would become entangled.|$|E
2500|$|Originally, Lucas {{envisioned the}} planet of Tatooine, {{where much of}} the film would take place, as a jungle planet. Gary Kurtz {{traveled}} to the Philippines to scout locations; however, because of the idea of spending months filming in the jungle would make Lucas [...] "itchy", the director refined his vision and made Tatooine a desert planet instead. Kurtz then researched all American, North African, and Middle Eastern deserts, and found Tunisia, near the Sahara desert, as the ideal location. In the director's commentary of the 2004 DVD edition of A New Hope, Lucas said he wanted <b>to</b> also <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>look</b> more [...] "spacy" [...] or outer space-like in style.|$|R
5000|$|Rahul Desai of the Mumbai Mirror wrote ″This is {{the kind}} of {{middling}} film that one doesn't know what <b>to</b> <b>make</b> of. <b>It</b> <b>looks</b> clean, simple and doesn't boast of any highs or lows. Everything, including the change of heart(s), is predictable. To be fair, the screenplay doesn't aspire to blow your socks off. Even director Nupur Asthana (Mujhse Fraaandship Karoge) seems to have made her peace with that.″ He ended with ″Bewakoofiyaan isn't Nupur Asthana's best effort (out of two), but I'm still going to look forward to her next. All she needs is an ambitious screenplay and a voice—perhaps her own?″ ...|$|R
5000|$|Ian Jane of DVD Talk wrote [...] "Despite the ridiculousness of {{the script}} and the mediocrity of the acting, Madhouse has enough gore and ludicrous set pieces <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> worth a <b>look</b> for slasher fans." [...] Tom Becker of DVD Verdict opined, [...] "Little touches of audacity notwithstanding, Madhouse ends up being a mediocre chiller with some unintentional laughs." ...|$|R
5|$|Central Saint Giles {{provides}} 66,090m² {{of floor}} space – almost {{double that of}} the old St Giles Court – split between two separate buildings. The 15-storey west block is for residential use, providing 109 flats of which 53 are designated as affordable. The much larger horseshoe-shaped eastern block, standing 11 storeys high, encircles a publicly accessible courtyard comprising 27% of the site's area. It provides 37,625m² of office space with {{by far the largest}} floor plates of any office block in the West End of London, with 4,000m² on all but the top two floors. At ground level, 2,276m² of space is available for retail outlets and restaurants. The block is irregularly shaped with recesses, projections and roof terraces intended <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>look</b> more interesting and to break up its bulk.|$|E
5|$|The Royal Mail Case or R v Kylsant & Otrs was a noted English {{criminal}} case in 1931. The {{director of the}} Royal Mail Steam Packet Company, Lord Kylsant, had falsified a trading prospectus {{with the aid of}} the company accountant <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>look</b> as if the company was profitable and to entice potential investors. Following an independent audit instigated by HM Treasury, Kylsant and John Moreland, the company auditor, were arrested and charged with falsifying both the trading prospectus and company records and accounts. Although they were acquitted of falsifying records and accounts, Kylsant was found guilty of falsifying the trading prospectus and sentenced to twelve months in prison. The company was then liquidated, and reconstituted as The Royal Mail Lines Ltd with the backing of the British government.|$|E
5|$|The scenes {{on board}} the Queen Anne were filmed aboard the famous {{passenger}} liner RMS Queen Mary, which has long {{been used as a}} hotel. The X-Files crew spent a total of eleven days filming on the Queen Mary, and erected wrap-around scaffolding on the bridge in order to block out the lights of nearby Long Beach, California. <b>To</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>look</b> like it was raining during the scenes on the bridge, the crew installed large sprinkler systems to provide a constant supply of water. Unhappy with the remodeled style of the ship's corridors and ballroom, Carter had portions of the ship recarpeted and redecorated to give the finished episode a late-1930s style.|$|E
50|$|The second Maccabiah {{were held}} on from April 2 to 10, 1935 despite {{official}} opposition by the British Mandatory government. The games were held after {{only three years}} instead of four as was customary in the Olympics. They decided on three years in order <b>to</b> not <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>look</b> like they were imitating the Olympics. Additionally, the Maccabiah served a more important goal - during the first Maccabiah {{a large portion of}} the athletes stayed in Israel, effectively bypassing the British White Paper. The organizers were hoping the second Maccabiah would function as a way to allow more athletes <b>to</b> <b>make</b> Aliyah. During the second games over 1,300 athletes from 28 nations participated.|$|R
50|$|After {{the success}} of the 1st Maccabiah in 1933, the Maccabi World Union decided to host a second Maccabiah. In order <b>to</b> not <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>look</b> like they were imitating the Olympic Games, the 2nd Maccabiah took place 3 years after the first, in the spring of 1935. Eretz Yisrael enjoyed that year a {{relative}} economic boom. Tel Aviv has grown and main streets were paved. The stadium also has grown and added many new viewing locations. The second Maccabiah resulted in the settlement's first swimming pool (50 meters) in Bat Galim, Haifa. The pool was used throughout the games in the swimming competitions (during the 1st Maccabiah, the swimming competitions took place in the sea).|$|R
50|$|Penn State {{played the}} Akron Zips in its home opener. Akron was unranked, however the team {{finished}} as the 2005 MAC Champions. Anthony Morelli threw a 42-yard touchdown {{on his first}} pass attempt of his first start. Penn State won the game 34-16. Akron kept it respectably close {{for a while before}} Penn State pulled away with a commanding 34-9 lead, allowing a late Zips touchdown <b>to</b> once again <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>look</b> respectable.|$|R
5|$|Aside from humans, {{octopuses}} may be preyed on by fishes, seabirds, sea otters, pinnipeds, cetaceans, {{and other}} cephalopods. Octopuses typically hide or disguise themselves by camouflage and mimicry; some have conspicuous warning coloration (aposematism) or deimatic behavior. An octopus may spend 40% {{of its time}} hidden away in its den. When the octopus is approached, it may extend an arm to investigate. 66% of Enteroctopus dolfleini in one study had scars, with 50% having amputated arms. The blue rings of the highly venomous blue-ringed octopus are hidden in muscular skin folds which contract when the animal is threatened, exposing the iridescent warning. The Atlantic white-spotted octopus (Callistoctopus macropus) turns bright brownish red with oval white spots all over in a high contrast display. Displays are often reinforced by stretching out the animal's arms, fins or web <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>look</b> as big and threatening as possible.|$|E
5|$|Detective Gordon Eaves (Lewis Fitz-Gerald) {{is sent to}} the Bay. Hugo, who {{is hiding}} at Martha's farm, overhears him and {{recognises}} him as the cop that he and the others paid off when he was involved in the people smuggling racket. Martha makes this aware to Angelo who agrees to go to Martha's farm with Eaves. On the way, Eaves threatens Angelo to go along with his plans. Eaves shoots Hugo and then flees the scene. Hugo is rushed indoors and Martha phones local doctor, Rachel Armstrong (Amy Mathews). Eaves is caught by Angelo, Tony and Charlie Buckton (Esther Anderson). Angelo then arrests both Hugo and Martha. As Angelo is driving them to the police station, he suddenly stops and lets them out. He tells Hugo to punch him <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>look</b> like he and Martha had overpowered him and escaped. Martha thanks Angelo for letting them leave together. Hugo and Martha use Angelo's police car to escape and they flee the Bay, leaving behind their family and friends.|$|E
5|$|In the White House, Clinton placed donated {{handicrafts}} {{of contemporary}} American artisans, such as pottery and glassware, on rotating {{display in the}} state rooms. She oversaw {{the restoration of the}} Blue Room to be historically authentic to the period of James Monroe and the Map Room to how it looked during World War II. Working with Arkansas interior decorator Kaki Hockersmith over an eight-year period, she oversaw extensive, privately funded redecoration efforts around the building, often trying <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>look</b> brighter. These included changing the look of the Treaty Room, a presidential study, to along 19th century lines. Overall the redecoration brought mixed notices, with Victorian furnishings for the Lincoln Sitting Room being criticized the most. Clinton hosted many large-scale events at the White House, including a state dinner for visiting Chinese dignitaries, a New Year's Eve celebration {{at the turn of the}} 21st century and a state dinner honoring the bicentennial of the White House in November 2000.|$|E
50|$|The two become fast {{friends who}} {{spend much of}} their time {{together}} engaged in philosophical conversation, but their friendship comes to an abrupt halt when the two are involved in an incident with a local landowner who claims they are trespassing on his land. Ryan throws a rock at the man, causing him to fall and break his neck on a rock. The two manage <b>to</b> successfully <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>look</b> like an accident, but the incident forces Barret to pull away from his friendship with Ryan. This causes Ryan to become very emotional, and to purchase a black market gun. Barret soon agrees that they should put the incident behind them and continue to be friends, but Ryan becomes increasingly morose and attached to Barret.|$|R
5000|$|In {{commenting on}} the home video release of Skid Marks, DVD Verdict called the film a [...] "cheap-'n'-cheesy low-ball, gross-out comedy", and wrote that the two rival {{companies}} names, Bayside Ambulatory Life Services and Downtown Intensive Care create acronyms that clue viewers to the general tone of the film {{and most of its}} humor. They felt that it was an unremarkable indie film that was [...] "frequently funny" [...] but more often [...] "frequently stupid," [...] seeming to be aimed at a junior high school audience. They offered that the DVD release was decent and its image [...] "reasonably good given the $1.98-style budget", and that [...] "the producers don't try to obviously fake things <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> all <b>look</b> higher level than it is." ...|$|R
50|$|The seawall in {{the park}} (which was built in 1972) is deteriorating and has changed the {{environment}} on the beach. Large logs and native vegetation had {{been added to the}} upper beach <b>to</b> both <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>look</b> natural and limit access to the beach. A Beach Habitat Restoration project started in 2004 that has already removed 1/3 of the seawall and restored a more natural beach on {{the southern end of the}} park. The northern portion started in September 2013 and concluded in the Summer of 2014. During this time, the city has also acquired a 10 acre parcel on the southern edge of the park and added it to the system. In addition to the beach restoration some work was done on removing invasive plant species, trails were improved and facilities were upgraded.|$|R
