A proponent of their theory was the FBI agent who killed McCoy. [...] "When I shot Richard McCoy," [...] he said, [...] "I shot D. B. Cooper at the same time." ...|$|E
500|$|Christiansen {{enlisted in}} the army in 1944 and was trained as a paratrooper. The war had ended {{by the time he}} was {{deployed}} in 1945, but he made occasional training jumps while stationed in Japan with occupation forces in the late 1940s. After leaving the army he joined Northwest Orient in 1954 as a mechanic in the South Pacific, and subsequently became a flight attendant, and then a purser, based in Seattle. Christiansen was 45 years old at the time of the hijacking, but he was shorter (5ft. 8 in.), thinner (150 pounds), and lighter complected than eyewitness descriptions. Christiansen smoked (as did the hijacker), and displayed a particular fondness for bourbon (Cooper's preferred beverage). He was also left-handed. (Evidence photos of Cooper's black tie show the <b>tie</b> <b>clip</b> applied from the left side, suggesting a left-handed wearer.) Flight attendant Florence Schaffner told a reporter that photos of Christiansen fit her memory of the hijacker's appearance more closely than those of other suspects she had been shown. (Tina Mucklow, who had the most contact with Cooper, has never granted a press interview.) ...|$|E

The use of <b>tie</b> <b>clips</b> gained prominence during the 1920s, during which period the use of straight ties made of delicate materials such as silk became more fashionable, and they largely came to replace the more traditional tie pin.|$|R

5000|$|The first {{documented}} {{appearance of}} the expression “To give the shirt off one’s back,” happened in 1771 as an idiom that indicates extreme desperation or generosity and is still in common usage. In 1827 Hannah Montague, a housewife in upstate New York, invents the detachable collar. Tired of constantly washing her husband’s entire shirt when only the collar needed it, she cut off his collars and devised a way of attaching them to the neckband after washing. It wasn't until the 1930s that collar stays became popular, although these early accessories resembled <b>tie</b> <b>clips</b> more than the small collar stiffeners available today. They connected the collar points to the necktie, keeping them in place ...|$|R

She then completed the look with silk knit jerseys, ballet shoes, headbands and tight cardigans. Lelia Delval, the hairstylist for Populaire, gave Bejo a red wig to wear, which the actress liked so much, she dyed her real hair red for her next film.

50|$|Its first ascent was in 1965 by JFK's brother Robert F. Kennedy, with a {{party of}} {{experienced}} mountaineers sponsored by the National Geographic Society and led by Jim Whittaker. Upon reaching {{the peak of the}} summit, Kennedy left some of his brother's PT-boat <b>tie</b> <b>clips,</b> a copy of his brother's Inaugural Presidential Address, and a John F. Kennedy medallion. This route from the Cathedral Glacier to the south is now considered a routine climb for experienced glacier travelers, having little technical difficulties other than navigation of extensive crevasse fields and avoidance of avalanches. Since then, other routes have been completed, including the highly technical North Buttress, first climbed in 1968 using siege tactics (placing fixed ropes and returning to a base camp), and finally in 2001 in purely alpine style (continuous ascent from bottom to summit with no fixed ropes).|$|R
50|$|Prior to the 1922 World Series, {{players on}} the World Series-winning team were given keepsakes, such as a pin or pocketwatch fob. The first World Series ring {{was given to the}} members of the New York Giants {{following}} their victory in the 1922 World Series over the New York Yankees. When the Yankees won the 1923 World Series, players were given a commemorative pocketwatch. The Yankees first gave rings to their players following the 1927 World Series. Rings became an annual tradition in the 1930s, as every World Series-winning team has given rings to its players since 1932. In past years, players often requested other items in place of rings, including cufflinks and <b>tie</b> <b>clips.</b> Frankie Crosetti and Tommy Henrich requested shotguns from the Yankees following World Series championships. Grover Cleveland Alexander reportedly pawned his 1926 World Series ring.|$|R
5000|$|Each field {{agent is}} {{outfitted}} with a miniature scanner disguised {{as a piece of}} jewelry, which can be magnetically attached to special cuff links, <b>tie</b> <b>clips,</b> rings or pendants. This device continuously monitors the agent's progress, transmitting audio, video, and physical telemetry to Probe Control. These images were stabilized and rotated to permit real-time observation by a team of specialists at Probe Control who analyze the data, consult databases worldwide, and immediately provide information covertly to the field agent via a subcutaneous ear piece (or [...] "earjack") implanted in the agent's mastoid process. (First-generation earjacks had platinum housings, later replaced with zirconium for unspecified reasons.) The agent can respond to Probe Control either audibly (via the microphone in the scanner) or by tapping out code with a dental implant, even when they don't have their scanner operating.|$|R

50|$|To make a ponytail, some, {{most or all}} of {{the hair}} on the head is pulled away from the face, {{gathered}} and secured {{at the back of the}} head with a hair <b>tie,</b> <b>clip,</b> or other similar device and allowed to hang freely from that point. It gets its name from its resemblance to the undocked tail of a horse or pony. Ponytails are most commonly gathered at the middle of the back of the head, or the base of the neck. Depending on fashions, they may also be worn at the side of the head (which is sometimes considered formal) which is worn over one ear, or on the very top of the head (allowing the hair to fall down the back or one side of the head).|$|E

40|$|Abstract BACKGROUND: Conventional {{techniques}} for hemostasis during thyroidectomy rely on knot <b>tying,</b> <b>clips,</b> and electrocoagulation. Recently, the Harmonic FOCUS Shear (Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Inc, Cincinnati, OH) {{was developed for}} thyroidectomy. METHODS: Between December 2007 and March 2008, 62 consecutive patients (45 women, 17 men; mean age 50. 9 years) undergoing thyroidectomy were randomized into 2 groups: group A, where the FOCUS was used, and group B, where electrocoagulation and clamp-and-tie technique were used. RESULTS: The 2 groups were similar in terms of age, sex ratio, indication for surgery, and thyroid volume. Operative time was significantly shorter in group A. Significantly fewer <b>clips</b> and <b>ties</b> were used, and postoperative pain and suction balloon amount were also significantly lower in the FOCUS group. The only postoperative complication was a patient with transient hypocalcemia in group B. CONCLUSIONS: FOCUS is a reliable and safe tool for thyroidectomy. Its utilization {{is associated with a}} shorter operative time, less blood loss, and less postoperative pain. Copyright 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R
