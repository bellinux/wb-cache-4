5|$|Before {{the end of}} the war, {{architect}} Charles Holden drew up {{plans to}} redevelop <b>the</b> <b>city</b> centre, but locals were so opposed that the Citizens' Defence Association was formed and swept to power in the 1945 municipal elections. Rebuilding of <b>the</b> <b>city</b> centre eventually began 10years after the war. A ring road was constructed in stages outside <b>the</b> <b>city</b> walls some time afterwards to alleviate growing traffic problems in <b>the</b> <b>city</b> centre, which was later pedestrianised. The biggest expansion of <b>the</b> <b>city</b> occurred in the 1960s, {{with the arrival of the}} University of Kent at Canterbury and Christ Church College.|$|E
5|$|Despite Canterbury's walls, a Viking army {{successfully}} attacked <b>the</b> <b>city</b> in 835, killing {{many of the}} inhabitants.

Roger's account may be an exaggeration, but the story shows that <b>the</b> <b>city</b> walls were in sufficiently good condition for such a story to be considered plausible at the time.

2500|$|During the Middle Ages many towns were founded, {{especially}} in the climatically more favoured lower plateau. In 1500 there were already 130 towns, connected by a dense road-network. With the raise of the industrialisation in the early 19th century [...] <b>the</b> <b>cities</b> {{became more and more}} important. In 1860 a drastic population growth of <b>the</b> <b>cities</b> started which lasted for about 100 years. In the 1970s, however, an outmigration from <b>the</b> <b>cities</b> started. Therefore, <b>the</b> municipalities surrounding <b>the</b> <b>cities</b> grew disproportionately, whereas <b>the</b> <b>cities</b> themselves lost inhabitants.

The first public school for blacks in <b>the</b> <b>city</b> was held in facilities rented from St. Paul Methodist Church. The Mississippi Legislature amended <b>the</b> <b>city</b> charter in January 1888 to allow <b>the</b> <b>city</b> to maintain its own municipal school district, and in March of the same year $30,000 in bonds was approved for <b>the</b> <b>city</b> to build new public schools. From this bond, the Wechsler School was built in 1894, becoming the first brick public school building in the state built for blacks.|$|E
