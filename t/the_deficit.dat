40|$|This paper gauges {{the causal}} {{relationship}} between external and budget deficits by using Blanchard's overlapping generations model. This model sests <b>the</b> twin <b>deficits</b> hypothesis (i. e. {{there is a}} positive relationship between <b>the</b> <b>deficits)</b> and <b>the</b> Ricardian equivalence hypothesis (i. e. there is no link between <b>the</b> <b>deficits).</b> This model also implies that consumers forecast future budget deficits using (at least) the history of <b>the</b> two <b>deficits.</b> This implication is used to derive time series restrictions, which are testable for given comsumer's planning horizons. For the relevant horizon, the response of <b>the</b> external <b>deficit</b> to an increase in <b>the</b> budget <b>deficit</b> is computed. For the Canadian and the U. S. economies, the relevant horizons can be as long as 83 years. However, given the persistence of <b>the</b> budget <b>deficits,</b> these horizons produce responses that are statistically significant. These findings reconcile the mixed results obtained in previous analyses. This paper is available at ftp://crefe. dse. uqam. ca/pub/cahiers/cah 31. ps The whole WP list is at [URL]...|$|R

5|$|The {{government}} {{estimated that}} oil would average $124 a barrel {{for the year}} {{but as a result}} of lower oil production, caused by maintenance of two of the three offshore oil rigs, the province would record a deficit of $258 million. Marshall stated that while he could have eliminated <b>the</b> <b>deficit</b> in one year through cuts, the government decided that they would run a deficit for two years before going back to surpluses. The government also announced that over the next 10 years they would embark on a “core mandate analysis” to restrain growth in program spending to the rate of inflation, and reduce Newfoundland and Labrador’s debt level to the all-province average. Just three months after the budget was delivered Dunderdale announced that the government would cut back on travel and leave some vacant positions unfilled due to a drop in oil prices. On the day of her news conference brent crude, a close reference point for oil produced offshore Newfoundland, stood at $103 a barrel, which was up from $90 the previous month. For every $1 drop in the price of oil below government estimates results in nearly $20 million less being funnelled into the provincial treasury, which meant <b>the</b> <b>deficit</b> for the year was expected to climb by several hundred million dollars. By the time Finance Minister Marshall released his mid-year economic update on December 13, 2012, it was estimated that <b>the</b> <b>deficit</b> would total $726 million for that fiscal year.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{entering}} the crisis {{with a low}} level of public debtroughly 40% of GDPand a moderate deficit compared to many European nations, the UK's ability to take discretionary fiscal action was limited by the burden of bank bail-outs on public finances. The tax revenue from financial services, which was conservatively estimated at 13.9% of UK tax income in 2007, fell alarmingly as the crisis affected bank profits. This contributed to a significant rise in <b>the</b> <b>deficit</b> to an estimated £175billion (12.4% of GDP) in 2009–10 and a rise in the national debt to above 80% of GDP at its peak. The UK had significant automatic stabilisers which contributed far more than discretionary action and more than most other countries.|$|E

Bayern replaced Sforza, Claudio Pizarro and Salihamidžić for Niko Kovač, Carsten Jancker and Roque Santa Cruz respectively. Liverpool substituted Gerrard and Riise for Igor Bišćan and Danny Murphy respectively. Liverpool started to pass the ball around their midfield and defence in an attempt to waste time, however in the 82nd minute Bayern scored again. Substitute Jancker headed into the Liverpool goal from a cross by Elber. Immediately afterwards Bayern had an opportunity to equalise, however Lizarazu's shot was straight at Liverpool goalkeeper Sander Westerveld. No further goals were scored and the referee blew for full-time with the final score 3–2 to Liverpool.|$|E
