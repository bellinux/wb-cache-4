5|$|In the 2016 Honolulu mayoral {{elections}} {{the main}} three candidates again took opposing views on rail. Charles Djou, former mayor Peter Carlisle, and incumbent Kirk Caldwell all ran for mayor with the stated goal of finishing rail.

25|$|This current {{makes the}} railgun behave as an electromagnet, {{creating}} {{a magnetic field}} inside the loop formed by the length of <b>the</b> <b>rails</b> up to <b>the</b> position of the armature.

Since the current is {{in the opposite direction}} along each <b>rail,</b> <b>the</b> net magnetic field between <b>the</b> <b>rails</b> (B) is directed at right angles to the plane formed by the central axes of <b>the</b> <b>rails</b> and <b>the</b> armature. In combination with the current (I) in the armature, this produces a Lorentz force which accelerates the projectile along <b>the</b> <b>rails,</b> away from <b>the</b> power supply.

40|$|Abstract — We {{estimate}} the temperature distribution in <b>the</b> <b>rails</b> of an electromagnetic rail gun (EMG) {{due to the}} confinement of the current in a narrow surface layer resulting from the skin effect. In order to obtain analytic results, we assume a simple geometry for <b>the</b> <b>rails,</b> an electromagnetic skin effect boundary edge that propagates with the accelerating armature, and a current carrying channel controlled by magnetic field diffusion into <b>the</b> <b>rails.</b> We compute <b>the</b> temperature distribution in <b>the</b> <b>rails</b> at <b>the</b> time that the armature leaves <b>the</b> <b>rails.</b> For <b>the</b> range of exit velocities, from 1500 m/s to 5000 m/s, we find the highest temperatures are near the gun breech. After a single gun firing, the temperature reaches the melting temperature of <b>the</b> metal <b>rails</b> in a layer of finite thickness near the surface of <b>the</b> <b>rails,</b> for rails made of copper or tantalum. We plot {{the thickness of the}} melt layer as a function of position along <b>the</b> <b>rails.</b> In all cases, the thickness of the melt layer increases with gun velocity, making damage to <b>the</b> gun <b>rails</b> more likely at higher velocity. We also calculate the efficiency of the EMG as a function of gun velocity and find that the efficiency increases with increasing velocity, but only if the length of the gun is sufficiently long. The thickness of the melted layer also decreases with increasing rail length. Therefore, there is a tradeoff: for rails of sufficient length, the gun efficiency increases with increasing velocity but the melted layer thickness in <b>the</b> <b>rails</b> also increases.

50|$|A major {{obstacle}} to doing so is thermal expansion: <b>the</b> <b>rails</b> expand in higher temperatures.

50|$|Railguns use two {{parallel}} metal rails {{connected to a}} power supply.

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>rails</b> {{leading up}} to a stub switch are not secured to the {{sleepers}} for several feet, and <b>rail</b> alignment across <b>the</b> gap is not positively enforced.

Yet another disadvantage is that in very hot weather, expansion of the steel in <b>the</b> <b>rails</b> can cause <b>the</b> movable <b>rails</b> to stick to <b>the</b> stock <b>rails,</b> making switching impossible until <b>the</b> <b>rails</b> have cooled and contracted.|$|R
