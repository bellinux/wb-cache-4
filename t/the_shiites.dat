5|$|After Ali's death, the Shias of Iraq {{declared}} Ali's {{eldest son}} Hasan {{the successor to}} Ali, thus proclaiming him as their new caliph. However, Hasan {{was not interested in}} becoming caliph, and to prevent further bloodshed, he signed the Hasan–Muawiya treaty and abdicated in favor of Muawiyah, who became the first caliph of the Umayyad caliphate. Muawiyah died in Medina at the age of forty-five in 669, and was succeeded by Yazid I in 61 AH (680 CE) but Hasan's brother Husayn ibn Ali refused to accept Yazid's leadership. After being invited by <b>the</b> <b>Shiites</b> of Iraq in the same year, Husayn started his march to Iraq. However, during their stay at Karbala, his army was massacred by Yazid at the Battle of Karbala on 10 Muharram (10 October) and his death is commemorated by Shia every year during Muharram.|$|E
25|$|The Shia Muslims {{are around}} 27%–29% {{of the total}} population. The Speaker of Parliament is always a Shi'a Muslim, {{as it is the}} only high post that Shi'as are {{eligible}} for. <b>The</b> <b>Shiites</b> are largely concentrated in northern and western Beqaa, Southern Lebanon and in the southern suburbs of Beirut.|$|E
25|$|This {{eventually}} {{meant that}} many Abbasid caliphs were {{relegated to a}} more ceremonial role than under the Umayyads, as the viziers began to exert greater influence, {{and the role of}} the old Arab aristocracy was slowly replaced by a Persian bureaucracy. During Al-Mansur's time control of Al-Andalus was lost, and <b>the</b> <b>Shiites</b> revolted and were defeated a year later at the Battle of Bakhamra.|$|E

25|$|Saddam was {{captured}} by U.S. forces on 13 December 2003. He remained in custody by United States forces at Camp Cropper in Baghdad, along with eleven senior Ba'athist officials. Particular attention was paid during the trial to activities in violent campaigns against the Kurds in the north during the Iran–Iraq War, against <b>the</b> <b>Shiites</b> {{in the south in}} 1991 and 1999 to put down revolts, and in Dujail after a failed assassination attempt on 8 July 1982, during the Iran–Iraq War. Saddam asserted in his defense that he had been unlawfully overthrown, and was still the president of Iraq.|$|E
25|$|Iraqi Republican Guard {{encountered}} resistance {{as soon as}} {{they entered}} the city. As a result of the mostly-Sunni Republican Guard's resentment of <b>the</b> <b>Shiites,</b> it was said that the tanks bore placards saying, “No More Shia After Today.” The main targets included the main Shia shrines and the al-Husseini hospital. At the hospital, doctors treated the wounded while people continually rushed in to donate blood and medicine, despite the concentrated shelling from the loyalist forces on the city outskirts. The rebels put up a stiff resistance in defending the hospital. Once it fell, the army rounded up doctors, nurses, and took them away for execution. Patients were thrown out of windows and reports surfaced of bulldozers burying bodies on the hospital grounds.|$|E
25|$|Some Sunni {{scholars}} {{do believe}} in Raj’a, believing in the return of number of people such as Seven Sleepers synchronous {{with the appearance of}} the Mahdi. Jalaluddin Al-Sayuti wrote about the raj`a but in a different way from <b>the</b> <b>Shiites.</b> According to his book The Possibility of Seeing the Prophet and the Angels (Arabic: تنوير الحلك في إمكان رؤية النبي والملك,) Suyuti claims to have seen the Prophet Muhammad over 70 times while he was awake. According to him, in contrast to Shiite belief, the return of the Prophet Muhammad is not limited to a specific time in the future. Al-Sayuti did not mention if any other religious figures will return after death before the resurrection. According to Abu 'Abdullah Al-Qurtubi, raj`a is understood as the lack of physical presence of a prophet, who marks his apparent death by absence in the physical world but will reappear, from time to time, to those who are pure in heart. The Maliki scholar Ibn al-Arabi, known for his exegesis of the Sunan al-Tirmidhi, stated that seeing and hearing the prophets while awake is possible for the pure believer.|$|E

500|$|Although New Jersey {{performed}} her job expertly {{during the}} intervention in Lebanon some {{have criticized the}} decision to have New Jersey shell Druze and Syrian forces.

2500|$|All of this, {{according}} to British foreign correspondent Robert Fisk, served to generate ill will against the MNF among Lebanese Muslims and especially among <b>the</b> <b>Shiites</b> {{living in the}} slums of West Beirut. Lebanese Muslims believed the MNF, and the Americans in particular, were unfairly siding with the Maronite Christians {{in their attempt to}} dominate Lebanon. As a result, this led to artillery, mortar, and small arms fires being directed at MNF peacekeepers by Muslim factions. Operating under the peacetime rules of engagement, MNF peacekeepers—primarily U.S. and French forces—used minimum use of force as possible in order to avoid compromising their neutral status. Until October 23, 1983, there were ten guidelines issued for each U.S. Marine member of the MNF: ...|$|E
2500|$|The Human Rights Watch {{noted that}} the {{condition}} of religious minorities deteriorated sharply in 2012, with the government {{unwilling or unable to}} provide protection against attacks by extremists or to reign in abuses committed by its own security forces. Mass anti-Christian violence recently occurred in the 2009 Gojra riots and in the 2013 Joseph Colony riot and the 2013 Gujranwala riot. Recent anti-Shia violence includes the February 2012 Kohistan Shia Massacre, the August 2012 Mansehra Shia Massacre and the particularly deadly January 2013 and February 2013 Quetta bombings. The Ahmadiyya community in Pakistan was targeted in the similarly deadly May 2010 attacks on Ahmadi mosques in Lahore; the New York Times noted on that occasion that [...] "Minority sects like the Ahmadis and <b>the</b> <b>Shiites</b> and have come under increasing pressure as religious extremism has taken hold, fomented by sectarian groups like Jaish-e-Mohammad and Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, formerly state-sponsored organizations." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1206, Genghis Khan {{established}} a powerful dynasty among the Mongols of central Asia. During the 13th century, this Mongol Empire conquered {{most of the}} Eurasian land mass, including both China {{in the east and}} much of the old Islamic caliphate (as well as Kievan Rus') in the west. Hulagu Khan's destruction of Baghdad in 1258 is traditionally seen as the approximate end of the Golden Age. Mongols feared that a supernatural disaster would strike if the blood of Al-Musta'sim, a direct descendant of Muhammad's [...] uncle Al-‘Abbas ibn ‘Abd al-Muttalib, and the last reigning Abbasid caliph in Baghdad, was spilled. <b>The</b> <b>Shiites</b> of Persia stated that no such calamity had happened after the deaths of Husayn ibn Ali; nevertheless, as a precaution and in accordance with a Mongol taboo which forbade spilling royal blood, Hulagu had Al-Musta'sim wrapped in a carpet and trampled to death by horses on 20 February 1258. The Caliph's immediate family was also executed, with the lone exceptions of his youngest son who was sent to Mongolia, and a daughter who became a slave in the harem of Hulagu.|$|E
2500|$|In late 2006 {{or early}} 2007, in what {{journalist}} Seymour Hersh called The Redirection, the United States changed its {{policy in the}} Muslim world, shifting its support from the Shia to the Sunni, {{with the goal of}} [...] "containing" [...] Iran and as a by-product bolstering Sunni extremist groups. Richard Engel, who is an NBC News Chief Foreign Correspondent, wrote an article in late 2011 alleging that the United States Government is pro-Sunni and anti-Shia. During the Iraq War, the United States feared that a Shiite-led, Iran-friendly Iraq could have major consequences for American national security. However, nothing can be done about this as Iraq's Shiite government were democratically elected. Shadi Bushra of Stanford University wrote that the United States’ support of the Sunni monarchy during the Bahraini uprising {{is the latest in a}} long history of US support to keep <b>the</b> <b>Shiites</b> in check. The United States fears that Shiite rule in the Persian Gulf will lead to anti-US and anti-Western sentiment as well as Iranian influence in the Arab majority states. One analyst told CNN that the US strategy on putting pressure on Iran by arming its Sunni neighbors is not a new strategy for the United States.|$|E

[...] In one particular case, the DOD had asked the CIA to identify military targets to bomb. [...] One target the CIA identified was an underground shelter. [...] The CIA didn't {{know that it was}} a civilian bomb shelter. [...] In a rare instance the CIA correctly determined that the coalition forces efforts were coming up short in their efforts to destroy SCUD missiles. [...] Congress took away the CIA's role in interpreting spy-satellite photos, putting the CIA's satellite intelligence operations {{under the auspices of the}} military.

[...] At the end of the war, the CIA reported that there could be an uprising against Saddam, based on intelligence gained from exiles. [...] Former DI, and current President Bush called on <b>the</b> <b>Shiites</b> and Kurds to rise up against Saddam, while, at the same time, withdrawing any support against Saddam.
