5|$|Recently, {{new ways}} of {{handling}} the agung have emerged, including grasping {{a portion of the}} boss rather than the flange <b>to</b> <b>dampen</b> or using regular strokes upon the busel while striking the surrounding gong surface with the opposite, wooden end of the beater. The latter technique, called katinengka, is used by downriver musicians to produce metallic sounds during kulintang performances.|$|E
5|$|Sound that {{travels through}} the outer ear {{impacts on the}} eardrum, and causes it to vibrate. The three {{ossicles}} bones transmit this sound to a second window (the oval window) which protects the fluid-filled inner ear. In detail, the pinna of the outer ear helps to focus a sound, which impacts on the eardrum. The malleus rests on the membrane, and receives the vibration. This vibration is transmitted along the incus and stapes to the oval window. Two small muscles, the tensor tympani and stapedius, also help modulate noise. The two muscles reflexively contract <b>to</b> <b>dampen</b> excessive vibrations. Vibration of the oval window causes vibration of the endolymph within the vestibule and the cochlea.|$|E
5|$|The game's 15 {{missions}} {{take place}} in large levels that can be confronted in multiple ways. Guards may be knocked out with a blackjack or killed with a bow or sword, and their fallen bodies may be picked up and hidden. In addition to human enemies, the game features security automatons and surveillance cameras. While completing objectives such as frameups and blackmail, the player steals valuables {{that may be used}} to purchase thieving gear between missions. The player's main tools are specialized arrows, including water arrows to douse lights, moss arrows <b>to</b> <b>dampen</b> the player character's footsteps and rope arrows to reach higher ground.|$|E

5|$|Though {{the tale}} of Maya Sita told in the Ramayana adaptations is absent from the original, the concept of Maya Sita first appears in the epic itself. In the battle between Rama and Ravana, Indrajit – the son of Ravana – creates an {{illusion}}ary Sita (Maya Sita) and kills {{her in front of}} Rama's monkey general Hanuman, as a war tactic <b>to</b> <b>dampen</b> the spirits of Rama's army. The fooled Hanuman reports it to Rama, who is also dejected by the news. However, they soon realise that it must be an illusion of Indrajit. Another surrogate Sita appears in a later interpolation of the epic. At the end of the Ramayana, a golden image of Sita is subsisted for the real Sita to be on side of Rama in sacrifices, after Sita's abandonment by Rama when her chastity is questioned by his subjects.|$|E
5|$|Born {{into an old}} {{political}} family, Playford was {{the fifth}} Thomas Playford and the fourth to have lived in South Australia; his grandfather Thomas Playford II had served as premier in the 19th century. He {{grew up on the}} family farm in Norton Summit before enlisting in the Australian Imperial Force in World War I, fighting in Gallipoli and Western Europe. After serving, he continued farming until his election as a Liberal and Country League (LCL) representative for Murray at the 1933 state election. In his early years in politics, Playford was an outspoken backbencher who often lambasted LCL colleagues and ministers and their policies, and had a maverick strategy, often defying party norms and advocating unadulterated laissez faire economics and opposing protectionism and government investment, in stark contrast to his later actions as premier. With the resignation of the LCL's leader, Richard Layton Butler, Playford ascended to the premiership in 1938, having been made a minister just months earlier in an attempt <b>to</b> <b>dampen</b> his insubordination. Playford inherited a minority government and many independents to deal with, and instability was expected; Playford was seen as a transitional leader. However, Playford dealt with the independents adroitly and went on to secure a one-seat majority at the next election.|$|E
5|$|Swiatek and Breen {{described}} the Alabama half dollar as {{caught up in}} the presidential election of 1920, as a Republican administration might not be willing to put the Democrat Wilson on a coin, or might insist on the new incumbent appearing, something likely <b>to</b> <b>dampen</b> sales in Alabama, part of the Democratic Solid South. The Republican, Ohio Senator Warren G. Harding, won the election and was inaugurated in March 1921. On June 29, 1921, Owen wrote to Baker, suggesting a new pair of honorees for the coin: Kilby, the state's chief executive {{at the time of the}} 1919 centennial, and the State of Alabama's first governor, William Bibb. Cartoonist Frank Spangler of the Montgomery Advertiser prepared sketches of the new design. At James Fraser's suggestion, the plaster models were created by his wife, Laura Gardin Fraser, who was a noted sculptor in her own right. She shipped her completed work to the Commission of Fine Arts on September 22, 1921, and gained members' approval; the models were then sent to the Philadelphia Mint for use in making coinage dies. Laura Fraser thus became the first woman to design a coin, not only of the U.S., but of any country.|$|E

50|$|FASTKD2 {{has been}} linked to {{mitochondrial}} encephalomyopathy associated with cytochrome c oxidase deficiency (mitochondrial complex IV deficiency). Nonsense mutations in FASTKD2 produce a truncated protein that cuts off the RAP domain and part of the FAST domains, leading <b>to</b> <b>dampened</b> sensitivity <b>to</b> apoptotic stimuli. Moreover, breast cancer cells are protected against apoptosis by stimulating NRIF3/DD1 expression or DIF-1 knockdown, which thus suppresses the proapoptotic function of FASTKD2. The proapoptotic function is similarly observed in prostate cancer cells, but not in other cells; it is suggested that susceptibility to FASTKD2-mediated apoptosis requires certain factors to associate with the DIF-1 complex to bind. Thus far, activating and enhancing expression of FASTKD2 may prove effective in killing breast and prostate cancer cells.|$|R

40|$|International audienceA {{method is}} {{proposed}} for calculating the periodic solutions of non-linear mechanical systems with analytical non-linearities. The Jordan normalization procedure {{for the case}} of non-linear autonomous systems is described and generalized <b>to</b> <b>dampened</b> harmonically excited oscillators. Non-linear modes for Hamiltonian systems are introduced; normal forms simplify the analysis of bifurcation. It is shown how to extend, the modal synthesis procedure: the proposed non-linear modes obtained from free vibrations are used to construct a superposition technique to describe the forced response of harmonically excited systems. These results are tested for one- and two-degrees-of-freedom systems with cubic non-linearities. The results are compared with expressions obtained by classical analytical methods (averaging or multiple scales methods) or Runge-Kutta numerical methods...|$|R

Adding 2% of its weight with boric acid is reputed to significantly increase stability and shelf life, through resistance <b>to</b> <b>dampening</b> through ambient humidity. Other ratios such as 6 KNO3/3 Al/2 S and 5 KNO3/2 Al/3 S also exist and work. All ratios have similar burn times and strength, although 5 KNO3/3 Al/2 S seems to be dominant.|$|R
50|$|While {{incidents}} of racial tension in Omaha {{have been reported}} through its history, the worst was the Omaha Race Riot of 1919. This followed Red Summer, when other major industrial cities such as Chicago were also inflamed by severe race riots, arising from social, job and housing tensions after World War I. In Omaha an African-American laborer named Will Brown was lynched, the city's mayor was almost lynched, and four other people were murdered. Although the U.S. Army arrived to restore order, many observers believed torrential rains contributed more <b>to</b> <b>dampening</b> emotions and sparing the city more damage. Some feared that related rioting might occur in other Midwestern United States, particularly in Chicago; but none did.|$|R

50|$|Alternatively, victim {{derogation}} {{and other}} strategies {{may only be}} ways to alleviate discomfort after viewing suffering. This {{would mean that the}} primary motivation is not to restore a belief in a just world, but to reduce discomfort caused by empathizing. Studies have shown that victim derogation does not suppress subsequent helping activity and that empathizing with the victim plays a large role when assigning blame. According to Ervin Staub, devaluing the victim should lead to lesser compensation if restoring belief in a just world was the primary motive; instead, there is virtually no difference in compensation amounts whether the compensation precedes or follows devaluation. Psychopathy has been linked to the lack of just-world maintaining strategies, possibly due <b>to</b> <b>dampened</b> emotional reactions and lack of empathy.|$|R
