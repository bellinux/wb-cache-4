50|$|Wheeler {{knew that}} since the outlaws were in the Chiricahuas and most-likely heading south to cross the border, {{they would have to}} go through Apache Pass in order <b>to</b> <b>enter</b> Mexico. <b>Accordingly,</b> Wheeler and his men {{abandoned}} the pursuit and went to Tombstone on April 7, 1917, to drop off the confiscated whiskey, and on the next day they went to Apache Pass and succeeded in capturing two of the outlaws, who were then put in the Gleeson Jail. One of the prisoners was the gang's leader, Santiago Garcia. When asked why he opened fire on Wheeler and Gibson, Garcia said that he thought the lawmen were rival bootleggers and he was afraid that his cargo would be hijacked. According to Garcia, he and his men retreated only when they found out that Wheeler and Gibson were lawmen.|$|R

He started out as a druggist (a business in which he was engaged for two decades), was briefly an editor of a small newspaper, served as President of the Tioga National Bank, and was interested in the lumbering business in Michigan. He also acted as President of the Southern Central and other railways.|$|R

40|$|Widening {{access to}} {{education}} has been a central priority of the Scottish Government since 2010, {{with the objective of}} assisting those from disadvantaged backgrounds <b>to</b> <b>enter</b> higher education. <b>Accordingly,</b> the Scottish Funding Council introduced the 'ACES' project that specifically seeks to increase access to the creative arts and architecture. In parallel, a new educational system has been developed in Scotland over the last decade, titled 'Curriculum for Excellence'. Its introduction has raised concerns of underrepresentation in curricular areas such as art and design, and consequently of a potential limiting of access to architecture education. In response, Robert Gordon University (RGU) in Aberdeen developed a joint project between its schools of Architecture & Built Environment and Art & Design, involving partnerships with regional secondary education providers. This paper explains the ACES project at RGU, and raises broader questions provoked by this work about the accepted orthodoxies for entry to architecture education...|$|R

25|$|Boston in {{the early}} nineteenth century was a hotbed of {{political}} foment. Howe’s father was a Democrat who considered Harvard University a den of Federalists, and refused to allow his sons <b>to</b> <b>enter</b> the university. <b>Accordingly,</b> in 1818, Howe's father had him enrolled at Brown University. Most of his time there was spent engaged in practical jokes and other hi-jinx and, years later, Howe told his children that he regretted that he hadn’t more seriously applied himself to his studies. One of his classmates, Alexis Caswell, became a doctor and future president of Brown University; he described Howe by the following: “He showed mental capabilities which would naturally fit him for fine scholarship. His mind was quick, versatile, and inventive. I do not think he was deficient in logical power, but the severer studies did not seem to be congenial to him.” After graduating from Brown in 1821, Howe attended Harvard Medical School, taking his degree in 1824.|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Church and Dogma History)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2004. The Wesley Deaconess {{order in}} the Caribbean has been reorganised to permit men to serve in this way {{alongside}} the women. Most of the modem Orders have taken this decision, although approaching it in different ways. For the Caribbean church there were two principal issues; that of being members of an Order, and that of a clear parity with the presbyteral ministers. These issues have been addressed in a different manner {{to that of other}} Methodist churches, but {{it is too early to}} comment as to how well the changes have worked. The matter of membership of an Order has been addressed by recognising that there is a desire for a religious Order within the church and allowing ministers to opt into it should they desire. Parity has been resolved in a related process, according to which everybody offers themselves as candidates for ministry of the Church and, if accepted, is ordained into one ministry. Each minister has the option to choose which role they wish <b>to</b> <b>enter,</b> being stationed <b>accordingly.</b> Doctora...|$|R

50|$|The {{railroad}} {{was originally}} chartered as the Muncy Creek Railway on May 21, 1864. It {{was intended to}} provide a railroad outlet for Laporte, the newly established county seat of Sullivan County, via the valley of Muncy Creek. Some surveying, and possibly even grading, was done, but the new corporation {{ran out of money}} around 1867 and remained quiescent for several years. Interest in the railroad did not resume until 1871, when the Catawissa Railroad, later part of the Reading system, completed its line up the east bank of the West Branch Susquehanna River, passing through Muncy and Halls. Muncy, near the mouth of Muncy Creek, was an established town and would have been the logical terminus of the railroad. However, residents of Muncy feared the railroad would compete with an existing plank road to Hughesville and refused it permission <b>to</b> <b>enter</b> the town. <b>Accordingly,</b> the railroad was built from Halls to Hughesville in 1872, but money for further work was again lacking. The railroad was extended to Picture Rocks in 1875 using wooden rails to save money. However, the wooden rails could not withstand the weight of trains and the extension was abandoned in early 1876. The Muncy Creek Railway continued to struggle along until 1881, when the bondholders petitioned to have it placed in receivership. It was foreclosed on August 9, 1882, and reorganized on September 1, 1882 as the Williamsport and North Branch Railroad.|$|R
