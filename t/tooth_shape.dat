5|$|<b>Tooth</b> <b>shape</b> {{depends on}} the shark's diet: those that feed on mollusks and {{crustaceans}} have dense and flattened teeth used for crushing, those that feed on fish have needle-like teeth for gripping, and those that feed on larger prey such as mammals have pointed lower teeth for gripping and triangular upper teeth with serrated edges for cutting. The teeth of plankton-feeders such as the basking shark are small and non-functional.|$|E
5|$|An {{estimate}} of a horse's age {{can be made}} from looking at its teeth. The teeth continue to erupt throughout life and are worn down by grazing. Therefore, the incisors show changes as the horse ages; they develop a distinct wear pattern, changes in <b>tooth</b> <b>shape,</b> and changes in the angle at which the chewing surfaces meet. This allows a very rough {{estimate of}} a horse's age, although diet and veterinary care can also affect the rate of tooth wear.|$|E
5|$|The jaws {{contained}} {{sharp teeth}} which were compressed laterally and unequal {{in size and}} shape, and this variation of <b>tooth</b> <b>shape</b> is known as heterodonty. The teeth on the premaxillae (bones at the very tip of the upper jaw) were slender, unlike those of the maxillae (the main tooth-bearing bones in the upper jaw) which had a straight posterior edge. The upper jaw bore 30 teeth, with each premaxilla carrying about 4 teeth and each maxilla 11, while the lower jaw held 22 teeth.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigated}} a 12 -slot/ 11 -pole flux switching {{permanent magnet}} (FSPM) machine used for electric vehicles (EVs). Five novel rotor <b>teeth</b> <b>shapes</b> are proposed and researched {{to reduce the}} cogging torque and torque ripple of the FSPM machine. These rotor <b>teeth</b> <b>shapes</b> are notched <b>teeth,</b> stepped teeth, eccentric teeth, combination of notched and stepped teeth, and combination of notched and eccentric teeth. They are applied on the rotor and optimized, respectively. The influences of different rotor <b>teeth</b> <b>shapes</b> on cogging torque, torque ripple and electromagnetic torque are analyzed by the 2 -D finite-element method (FEM). Then, the performance of FSPMs with different rotor <b>teeth</b> <b>shapes</b> are compared and evaluated comprehensively from the points of view of cogging torque, torque ripple, electromagnetic torque, flux linkage, back electromotive force (EMF), and so on. The {{results show that the}} presented rotor <b>teeth</b> <b>shapes,</b> especially the combination of stepped and notched teeth, can greatly reduce the cogging torque and torque ripple with only slight changes in the average electromagnetic torque...|$|R

5|$|The {{spinner shark}} was {{originally}} described as Carcharias (Aprion) brevipinna by Johannes Peter Müller and Friedrich Gustav Jakob Henle in their 1839 Systematische Beschreibung der Plagiostomen, {{based on the}} mounted skin of a 79-cm-long specimen collected off Java. This species was subsequently moved to the genera Aprion, Squalus, and Aprionodon before being placed within the genus Carcharhinus. The <b>tooth</b> <b>shape</b> and coloration of this species varies significantly with age and between geographical regions, which caused much taxonomic confusion. Other common names include blacktipped shark, great blacktip shark, inkytail shark, large blacktip shark, long-nose grey shark, longnose grey whaler, and smoothfang shark.|$|E
5|$|Based on {{similarities}} in morphology, <b>tooth</b> <b>shape,</b> and behavior, the closest {{relatives of the}} spinner shark were originally {{believed to be the}} blacktip shark and the graceful shark (C. amblyrhynchoides). However, this interpretation was not supported by Gavin Naylor's 1992 allozyme analysis, which suggested that these similarities are the product of convergent evolution and that the closest relative of the spinner shark is the copper shark (C. brachyurus). In a 2007 ribosomal DNA study, the spinner shark was found to be the most genetically divergent of all the requiem shark species examined save for the tiger shark (Galeocerdo cuvier), being less related to other Carcharhinus species than the lemon shark (Negaprion brevirostris).|$|E
5|$|The Caribbean reef shark (Carcharhinus perezii) is {{a species}} of requiem shark, {{belonging}} to the family Carcharhinidae. It {{is found in the}} tropical waters of the western Atlantic Ocean from Florida to Brazil, and is the most commonly encountered reef shark in the Caribbean Sea. With a robust, streamlined body typical of the requiem sharks, this species is difficult to tell apart from other large members of its family such as the dusky shark (C. obscurus) and the silky shark (C. falciformis). Distinguishing characteristics include dusky-colored fins without prominent markings, a short free rear tip on the second dorsal fin, and <b>tooth</b> <b>shape</b> and number.|$|E

5|$|The puffadder shyshark is more slender {{than other}} shysharks, with a short, broad, dorsally {{flattened}} {{head and a}} narrowly rounded snout. The large, oval-shaped eyes have cat-like slit pupils, a simple nictitating membrane (a protective third eyelid), and a prominent ridge underneath. The nostrils are very large, {{with a pair of}} greatly expanded, triangular flaps of skin in front that are fused together and reach the mouth. There is a deep groove connecting the excurrent (outflow) opening of each nostril to the mouth, obscured by the nasal flaps. The mouth is short with furrows at the corners on both jaws. There are 26–30 tooth rows in the upper jaw and 27–33 tooth rows in the lower jaw. <b>Tooth</b> <b>shape</b> is sexually dimorphic: those of males are longer and three-pointed, while those of females are shorter and five-pointed. Unusually, the two halves of the lower jaw are connected by a special cartilage, which allows a more even distribution of teeth and may increase bite strength.|$|E
25|$|In cichlid taxonomy, {{dentition}} {{was formerly}} {{used as a}} classifying characteristic. However, this was {{complicated by the fact}} that in many cichlids, <b>tooth</b> <b>shape</b> changes with age, due to wear, and cannot be relied upon. Genome sequencing and other technologies transformed cichlid taxonomy.|$|E
25|$|The Acme thread form has a 29° {{thread angle}} with a thread height {{half of the}} pitch; the apex (or crest) and valley (or root) are flat. This shape is easier to machine (faster cutting, longer tool life) than is a square thread. The <b>tooth</b> <b>shape</b> also has a wider base which means it is {{stronger}} (thus, the screw can carry a greater load) than a similarly sized square thread. This thread form also allows {{for the use of}} a split nut, which can compensate for nut wear.|$|E
25|$|Hybodonts have a {{wide variety}} of <b>tooth</b> <b>shapes.</b> This variety {{suggests}} that they took advantage of multiple food sources. It is thought that some hybodonts which had wider, flatter, teeth specialized in crushing hard-shelled prey. Well-developed wear facets on teeth from Lissodus suggest that some hybodontiforms crushed their food. Species described from Thailand have a range of <b>teeth</b> <b>shapes,</b> suggesting multiple feeding habits. Bulbous teeth were used for crushing hard shelled bottom-dwelling prey.

25|$|Hybodonts are {{generally}} described and identified based on {{size and shape}} of teeth and fin spine fossils. Hybodonts are recognized as having teeth with a prominent cusp which is higher than lateral cusplets. Species of hybodonts are often determined based on their teeth fossils which {{are more likely to be}} preserved the rock record than the remainder of the sharks’ skeleton. Teeth are abundant in the fossil record because sharks shed them throughout their lifetime and teeth are resistant to erosion. Hybodont teeth are often preserved as incomplete fossils because the base of the tooth is not well attached to the crown. Hybodonts were initially divided into two groups based on their <b>tooth</b> <b>shape.</b> One group had teeth with acuminate cusps that lacked a pulp cavity; these are called osteodont teeth. The other group had a different cusp arrangement and had a pulp cavity, these are called orthodont teeth. For example, the hybodont species Heterophychodus steinmanni have osteodont teeth with vascular canals of dentine which are arranged vertically parallel to each other, also called ‘tubular dentine’. The crowns of these osteodont teeth are covered with a single layer of enameloid.|$|E
500|$|The tawny {{nurse shark}} was first {{described}} by French naturalist René-Primevère Lesson as Scyllium ferrugineum, based on a [...] long specimen from New Guinea. His short account was published in 1831 in Voyage au tour du monde, sur la corvette La Coquille. A more detailed description, along with an illustration, was published by German naturalist Eduard Rüppell in 1837 as Nebrius concolor, based on a specimen from the Red Sea. Both names were retained, often in separate genera (Ginglymostoma and Nebrius respectively), until they were synonymized by Leonard Compagno in 1984. Compagno recognized that the <b>tooth</b> <b>shape</b> differences used to separate these species {{were the result of}} differences in age, with N. concolor representing younger individuals.|$|E
500|$|The {{silvertip shark}} was {{originally}} described as Carcharias albimarginatus by German naturalist Eduard Rüppell, in the 1837 Fische des Rothen Meeres (Fishes of the Red Sea). The name was later changed to the currently valid Carcharhinus albimarginatus. The specific epithet {{is derived from}} the Latin albi meaning [...] "white", and marginatus meaning [...] "to enclose with a border", in reference to the distinct white fin margins. In 1960, a -long immature male caught off Ras Muhammad in the Red Sea was designated as the type specimen. Based on similarities in morphology, <b>tooth</b> <b>shape,</b> and vertebral characters, Garrick (1982) proposed the grey reef shark as the closest relative of the silvertip shark. This interpretation was corroborated by Lavery (1992), based on allozyme data.|$|E
50|$|In later years, the {{importance}} of dentition in assessing the age of horses led to veterinary dentistry being used a method of fraud, with owners and traders altering the teeth of horses to mimic the <b>tooth</b> <b>shapes</b> and characteristics of horses younger than the actual age of the equine.|$|R

500|$|The {{pectoral}} fins are large, pointed, and falcate (sickle-shaped). The first {{dorsal fin}} is tall, with a pointed apex and a concave trailing margin; its origin lies about {{even with the}} tips of the pectoral fins. The second dorsal fin is small and low, and positioned about opposite to the anal fin. There is usually no ridge between the dorsal fins. The caudal fin has a well-developed lower lobe and a deep ventral notch near the tip of the upper lobe. This species is bronze to olive-gray above with a metallic sheen and sometimes a pink cast, darkening towards the fin tips and margins but not conspicuously so; the color fades quickly to a dull gray-brown after death. The underside is white, which extends onto the flanks as a prominent band. The copper shark is easily mistaken for other large Carcharhinus species, particularly the dusky shark (C. obscurus), but can be identified by its upper <b>tooth</b> <b>shape,</b> absent or weak interdorsal ridge, and lack of obvious fin markings.

500|$|Crocodilians {{range in}} size from the Paleosuchus and Osteolaemus species, which reach , to the {{saltwater}} crocodile, which reaches [...] and weighs up to , though some prehistoric species such as the late Cretaceous Deinosuchus were even larger at up to about [...] and [...] They tend to be sexually dimorphic, with males much larger than females. Though there is diversity in snout and <b>tooth</b> <b>shape,</b> all crocodilian species have essentially the same body morphology. They have solidly built, lizard-like bodies with elongated, flattened snouts and laterally compressed tails. Their limbs are reduced in size; the front feet have five digits with little or no webbing, and the hind feet have four webbed digits and a rudimentary fifth. The skeleton is somewhat typical of tetrapods, although the skull, pelvis and ribs are specialised; in particular, the cartilaginous processes of the ribs allow the thorax to collapse during diving and the structure of the pelvis can accommodate large masses of food, or more air in the lungs. Both sexes have a cloaca, a single chamber and outlet {{at the base of the}} tail into which the intestinal, urinary and genital tracts open. It houses the penis in males and the clitoris in females. The crocodilian penis is permanently erect and relies on cloacal muscles for eversion and elastic ligaments and a tendon for recoil. The testes or ovaries are located near the kidneys.|$|E
500|$|Overall, the fossa has {{features}} {{in common with}} three different carnivoran families, leading researchers to place it {{and other members of}} Eupleridae alternatively in Herpestidae, Viverridae, and Felidae. Felid features are primarily those associated with eating and digestion, including <b>tooth</b> <b>shape</b> and facial portions of the skull, the tongue, and the digestive tract, typical of its exclusively carnivorous diet. The remainder of the skull most closely resembles skulls of genus Viverra, while the general body structure is most similar to that of various members of Herpestidae. The permanent dentition is [...] (three incisors, one canine, three or four premolars, and one molar on each side of both the upper and lower jaws), with the deciduous formula being similar but lacking the fourth premolar and the molar. The fossa has a large, prominent rhinarium similar to that of viverrids, but has comparatively larger, round ears, almost as large as those of a similarly sized felid. Its facial vibrissae (whiskers) are long, with the longest being longer than its head. Like some mongoose genera, particularly Galidia (which is now in the fossa's own family, Eupleridae) and Herpestes (of Herpestidae), it has carpal vibrissae as well. Its claws are retractile, but unlike those of Felidae species, they are not hidden in skin sheaths. It has three pairs of nipples (one inguinal, one ventral, and one pectoral).|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{forensic}} dentistry {{is to identify}} people based on their dental records, mainly as radiograph images. In this paper we attempt to set forth the foundations of a biometric system for semi-automatic processing and matching of dental images, with the final goal of human identification.

2500|$|Hybodontiformes, {{also called}} hybodonts, are an extinct subset of Elasmobranchii (sharks, skates and rays) which existed from the Devonian to the Miocene. They form {{the group of}} sharks closest to neoselachians, the clade of modern sharks and rays. Hybodonts were named and are {{distinguished}} based on their conical <b>tooth</b> <b>shape.</b> They comprised the main group of Jurassic sharks in Europe and North America.

2500|$|The {{crown of}} the tooth, which is {{influenced}} by the shape of the inner enamel epithelium, also takes shape during this stage. Throughout the mouth, all teeth undergo this same process; it is still uncertain why teeth form various crown shapes—for instance, incisors versus canines. There are two dominant hypotheses. The [...] "field model" [...] proposes there are components for each type of <b>tooth</b> <b>shape</b> found in the ectomesenchyme during tooth development. The components for particular types of teeth, such as incisors, are localized in one area and dissipate rapidly {{in different parts of the}} mouth. Thus, for example, the [...] "incisor field" [...] has factors that develop teeth into incisor shape, and this field is concentrated in the central incisor area, but decreases rapidly in the canine area. The other dominant hypothesis, the [...] "clone model", proposes that the epithelium programs a group of ectomesenchymal cells to generate teeth of particular shapes. This group of cells, called a clone, coaxes the dental lamina into tooth development, causing a tooth bud to form. Growth of the dental lamina continues in an area called the [...] "progress zone". Once the progress zone travels a certain distance from the first tooth bud, a second tooth bud will start to develop. These two models are not necessarily mutually exclusive, nor does widely accepted dental science consider them to be so: it is postulated that both models influence tooth development at different times.|$|E
5000|$|When {{comparing}} dental morphology {{the focus}} is on overall size and <b>tooth</b> <b>shape.</b> To measure the size and shape, Penrose's size and shape statistic is used. To calculate tooth size, the sum of the tooth area is taken. Factor analysis is applied to tooth size to achieve <b>tooth</b> <b>shape.</b> Results have shown that tooth size of Andaman islanders is closest to the tooth size of Chinese and Japanese people [...] Therefore, the indodont dental morphology of the Andamanese indicates a retention of dental morphology from Southeast Asians in early-mid Holocene.|$|E
