40|$|By oral {{infestation}} in man, their definite host, {{the large}} taenias (T. solium and T. saginata) of the Taeniidae family, Cyclophyllidea order, Cestoidea class, may cause {{two different types}} of disease: <b>teniasis</b> and cysticercosis. Although infestation in these parasitic diseases always takes place by ingestion, the manifestations or localizations within the oral region are extremely rare and, therefore, are hardly ever mentioned in studies of oral pathology...|$|E

40|$|The taeniasis-cysticercosis {{complex is}} a long known {{zoonotic}} parasitosis characteristic of underdeveloped countries. In addition to its public health significance, this parasitosis is cause of economic losses to the beef production chain, and synonymous of technical inadequacy {{in relation to the}} adoption of Good Agricultural Practices. The occurrences of both human <b>teniasis</b> and bovine cysticercosis could and should be controlled with basic sanitary measures. However, there is much variation in the occurrence of the disease in cattle, characterizing a low rate of technical development as well as problems related to the adoption of basic sanitation measures. This review describes, in details, the causative agent and its epidemiological chain, besides raising current information about the occurrence of bovine cysticercosis in different regions of Brazil, aiming at the adoption of prophylactic measures by different segments responsible. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Human {{trichinellosis}} and <b>teniasis</b> (Taenia solium) are meat-borne helminthic infections with a {{wide distribution}} throughout the world. However, there is little information on the prevalence of these infections in Papua New Guinea. In 1999, serum samples were collected from 97 people in 6 villages in the remote Bensbach area of Papua New Guinea. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot analyses were used to detect anti-Trich-inella immunoglobulin (Ig) G and anti-cysticercus IgG in this population. The prevalence of Trichinella antibodies among inhabitants of the Bensbach area was 28. 9 % (28 of 97; 67. 8 % in men), suggesting a high consumption of poorly cooked meat. The higher prevalence of infection for Trichinella in men compared with women {{may be explained by}} the inclination of men to eat undercooked pork while hunting. All serum samples were negative for cysticercus antibodies. This is to our knowledge the first serosurvey showing anti-Trichinella antibodies in a human population living in Papua New Guinea (Australian region) ...|$|E
