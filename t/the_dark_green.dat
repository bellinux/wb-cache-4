Space in the Piccadilly line building that was formerly used for operational purposes or as the exit to the street is now used for retail purposes. During the 2000s, the deep-level parts of the station underwent refurbishment with areas of damaged wall tiles being replaced. <b>The</b> <b>dark</b> <b>green</b> and cream tiled walls of the Piccadilly line's lower level passages and platforms were restored, with damaged tiles being replaced by reproductions to match the original designs.|$|E
5|$|The {{standard}} EVA Air livery utilizes dark green, signifying durability, and orange, representing technological innovation. The tail globe logo {{is intended}} to represent stability and reliability, and its positioning on the tail, with one corner off the edge, represents service innovation. The EVA Air livery was updated in 2002, adding a larger typeface {{and the use of}} green covering the aircraft below the window line. The tail design and logo remained unchanged. In late 2015, EVA Air redesigned their livery and tail logo, using <b>the</b> <b>dark</b> <b>green</b> color on the belly, and cancelled the orange line {{on the edge of the}} tail to highlight the corporate identity. It's the third generation livery of EVA Air, symbolizing their ambition to connect Taiwan to the world.|$|E

25|$|The geology of the Lizard {{peninsula}} is unusual, {{in that it}} is mainland Britain's only {{example of}} an ophiolite, a section of oceanic crust now found on land. Much of the peninsula consists of <b>the</b> <b>dark</b> <b>green</b> and red Precambrian serpentinite, which forms spectacular cliffs, notably at Kynance Cove, and carved and polished serpentine ornaments are sold in local gift shops. This ultramafic rock also forms a very infertile soil which covers the flat and marshy heaths of the interior of the peninsula. This is home to rare plants, such as the Cornish Heath, which has been adopted as the county flower.|$|E

500|$|... "For Whom the Bell Tolls" [...] {{begins with}} a bell tolling, {{followed}} by a marching riff and high-register bass melody. The chromatic introduction, which Burton wrote before he joined Metallica, is often mistaken for an electric guitar but is actually Burton's bass guitar augmented with distortion and a wah-wah pedal. The lyrics were inspired by Ernest Hemingway's 1940 novel of the same name, which explores the horror and dishonor of modern warfare. [...] "For Whom the Bell Tolls" [...] was released as a promotional single in two versions, an edit on side A and the album version on side B. [...] "Fade to Black" [...] is a power ballad whose lyrics contemplate suicide. Hetfield wrote the words because he felt powerless after the band's equipment was stolen before the January 1984 show in Boston. Musically, the song {{begins with a}}n acoustic guitar introduction overlaid with electric soloing. The song becomes progressively heavier and faster, ending with multi-layered guitar solos. The ballad's arpeggiated chords and reserved singing was inconvenient for thrash metal bands {{at the time and}} disappointed some of Metallica's fans. The song's structure foreshadows later Metallica ballads, [...] "Welcome Home (Sanitarium)", [...] "One" [...] and [...] "The Day That Never Comes.

The exact timing varies across New South Wales, but flowering can begin as early as August in the northern parts of its range, and finish in November in the southern, more elevated areas. Spot flowering may also occur around March in autumn. Containing up to 250 individual flowers, the domed flowerheads are crimson in colour and measure [...] in diameter. They are cupped in a whorl of leafy bracts which are [...] long and also red. Variations are not uncommon; some flowerheads may be more globular or cone-shaped than dome-shaped, and the bracts may be whitish or dark red.
