5|$|In {{the last}} two books of the work (Books XXXVI and XXXVII), Pliny {{describes}} many different minerals and gemstones, building on works by Theophrastus and other authors. The topic concentrates on the most valuable gemstones, and he criticises <b>the</b> <b>obsession</b> with luxury products such as engraved gems and hardstone carvings. He provides a thorough discussion of the properties of fluorspar, noting that it is carved into vases and other decorative objects. The account of magnetism includes the myth of Magnes the shepherd.|$|E
5|$|The novel {{started a}} new era of {{literature}} after the downfall of President Suharto and ignited the sastra wangi (literally 'fragrant literature') literary movement as well as an influx of sexually themed literary works by women. Utami disagrees with the label sastra wangi, stating that it reflects <b>the</b> <b>obsession</b> of the press with the women writers and not their work.|$|E

The unbalanced treatment of animal coloration in Concealing-Coloration in the Animal Kingdom encapsulates Thayer's partial understanding and his rejection of other theories.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} {{traditional}} pastimes {{have emerged in}} Madagascar. Moraingy, a type of hand-to-hand combat, is a popular spectator sport in coastal regions. It is traditionally practiced by men, but women have recently begun to participate. The wrestling of zebu cattle, which is named savika or tolon-omby, is also practiced in many regions. In addition to sports, {{a wide variety of}} games are played. Among the most emblematic is fanorona, a board game widespread throughout the Highland regions.

5000|$|Obsessive-compulsive {{disorder}} involves unwanted {{thoughts or}} {{images that are}} unsettling or interfere with an individual's life, followed by actions that temporarily relieve the anxiety caused by <b>the</b> <b>obsessions</b> (APA 2000). Obsessions are involuntary, repetitive, and unwelcome. Attempts to suppress or neutralize obsessions do not work and in fact make <b>the</b> <b>obsessions</b> more severe, as {{trying to make sense}} of obsessions only gives them more attention and [...] "fuel".

25|$|The Sino-Soviet rift and <b>the</b> <b>obsession</b> with Khrushchev's {{revisionism}} {{looms large}} in {{the coming of the}} Cultural Revolution, as Mao saw revisionism and de-Stalinization as a threat not only to his own position but also to the very survival of the Chinese Communist Party as a revolutionary force. Accordingly, an appreciation of Kang's role as a supporter of Mao's line in this period helps explain his return to very near the pinnacle of power a few years later.|$|E

5000|$|Obsessive-compulsive {{disorder}} comprises thoughts, images or urges {{that are}} unwanted, distressing, interfere with a person's {{life and that}} are commonly experienced as contradicting a persons' beliefs and values. Such intrusive thoughts are frequently followed by compulsive behaviors aimed at [...] "neutralizing" [...] the feared consequence of the intrusions and temporarily relieve the anxiety caused by <b>the</b> <b>obsessions.</b> Attempts to suppress or [...] "neutralize" [...] obsessions increase rather than decrease the frequency and distress caused by <b>the</b> <b>obsessions.</b>|$|R
40|$|Obsessive-compulsion diorder (ocd) is {{characterized}} by recurrent obsessions and/or compulsions. Obsessions are intrusive and unwanted thoughts, images or feelings which elicit considerable anxiety and discomfort. Commonly recurring themes in obsessions are aggression, blasphemy, death and (unacceptable) sexual urges. Compulsions are repetitive, ritualistic behaviours or mental acts that are performed to reduce or neutralise the anxiety that is elicited by <b>the</b> <b>obsessions.</b> <b>The</b> most frequently encountered compulsions are ordering, counting, checking and washing. When the patient resists carrying out the compulsions, anxiety usually increases. Patients generally recognize that <b>the</b> <b>obsessions</b> and compulsions are excessive and irrational. Nevertheless, <b>the</b> <b>obsessions</b> and com-pulsions cause marked distress, are timeconsuming and interfere signiicantly with the person’s social or occupational life. Many patients experience both obsessions and compulsions; only a minority presents with either obsessions or compulsions (Foa & Kozak). Ocd is classiied in dsm- 4 as an anxiety disorder, although not all clinicians agree on this categorization (Nelson & Chouinard) ...|$|R
40|$|We {{assessed}} {{the effectiveness of}} using <b>the</b> <b>obsessions</b> of children with autism to reduce their inappropriate behaviors. Baseline consisted of a traditional differential reinforcement of other behaviors (DRO) in which food reinforcers were provided contingent upon a period of nonoccurrence of the inappropriate behaviors. Then, three treatment conditions were assessed using a multielement design. One condition provided objects of obsession as reinforcers for periods of nonoccurrence of the inappropriate behaviors. A second condition also provided <b>the</b> <b>obsessions</b> as reinforcers, but in conjunction with mild reductive procedures (verbal “no”, time-out). A final condition used the food reinforcers of baseline, but with mild reductive procedures. Results indicated that all three treatment conditions were {{more effective than the}} traditional food DRO of baseline. The most effective condition was <b>the</b> <b>obsessions</b> plus mild reductive procedures. Results are discussed in terms of recommendations for effective treatment planning...|$|R
25|$|Having {{signed for}} Real Madrid for €46million, his jersey sales broke all records {{on the first}} day, such was <b>the</b> <b>obsession</b> and hype {{surrounding}} him. Ronaldo {{was part of the}} Galácticos era, which included Zinedine Zidane, Luís Figo, Roberto Carlos, Raúl and David Beckham. He was sidelined through injury until October 2002 but the fans kept on chanting his name. Ronaldo scored twice in his debut for Real Madrid. He received a standing ovation at the Santiago Bernabéu. That same reception was observed {{on the night of the}} final game of the season against Athletic Bilbao, where Ronaldo scored again to seal his first season with 23 league goals and the La Liga title for 2003. He also won an Intercontinental Cup in 2002 and Spanish Super Cup in 2003.|$|E
25|$|Modigliani's {{connection}} with the movement was through Guglielmo Micheli, his first art teacher. Micheli {{was not only a}} Macchiaiolo himself, but had been a pupil of the famous Giovanni Fattori, a founder of the movement. Micheli's work, however, was so fashionable and the genre so commonplace that the young Modigliani reacted against it, preferring to ignore <b>the</b> <b>obsession</b> with landscape that, as with French Impressionism, characterized the movement. Micheli also tried to encourage his pupils to paint en plein air, but Modigliani never really got a taste for this style of working, sketching in cafés, but preferring to paint indoors, and especially in his own studio. Even when compelled to paint landscapes (three are known to exist), Modigliani chose a proto-Cubist palette more akin to Cézanne than to the Macchiaioli.|$|E
25|$|Because of {{this growing}} trend, {{companies}} such as Sanrio came out with merchandise like Hello Kitty. Hello Kitty was an immediate success and <b>the</b> <b>obsession</b> with cute continued to progress in other areas as well. More recently, Sanrio has released kawaii characters with deeper personalities that appeal to an older audience, such as Gudetama and Aggretsuko. These characters have enjoyed strong popularity as fans are drawn to their unique quirks {{in addition to their}} cute aesthetics. The 1980s also saw the rise of cute idols, such as Seiko Matsuda, who is largely credited with popularizing the trend. Women began to emulate Seiko Matsuda and her cute fashion style and mannerisms, which emphasized the helplessness and innocence of young girls. The market for cute merchandise in Japan used to be driven by Japanese girls between 15 and 18 years old. No longer limited to teenagers, the spread of making things as cute as possible, even common household items, is embraced by people of all ages.|$|E

25|$|With {{the growth}} of the {{wellness}} industry in recent years, social media platforms have witnessed an assortment of fitness influencers and trends. Followers obsessively pursue these diet and exercise regimes posted as a way to remain healthy, while the influencers hope it generates body positivity in return. Yet, these bloggers and companies have received numerous criticism because the “drive for “wellness” and “clean eating” has become stealthy covers for more dieting and deprivation”. Likewise, reports have also shown that the messages delivered by “fitspiration” websites are sometimes identical to the “thinspiration” or pro-anorexia types. This is evident through “language inducing guilt about weight or the body, and promoted dieting”. Although the wellness trend may not lead to eating disorders, the marketing of restrictive diets to young women as a form of self care could potentially cause “increasingly disordered eating” , whereby they became more concerned with ingredients and limited certain types of food. This illness is better known as Orthorexia; which is <b>the</b> <b>obsession</b> with the right and wrong types of food.|$|E
25|$|EU as a {{security}} provider: Management of post Soviet-er{{a security}} tensions in bordering States (Ukraine, Georgia and Balkan States) has exposed deep-rooted structural weaknesses of European Union institutions. European Union's collective response on matters ranging from {{the management of the}} exodus of refugees from war-torn Libya, Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, participation in NATO-led interventions, action against non-State entities (Islamic State & Al-Qaeda), etc. suffers from differing priorities of 28 European Union member States. The paucity of strategic vision within the European Council, nationality-quota based allotment of senior bureaucratic positions within the Institutions of the European Union, and the capacity of minor European countries to unduly influence policy choices of the European Union is problematic. Decision taking by Brussels-based European stake-holders is cumbersome and severely limited due to intra-EU politics and <b>the</b> <b>obsession</b> with Byzantine Community method consensus-based decision making procedures. The Ukrainian crisis exposed the shortcomings of the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) and outlined the limits of German military clout. Public disenchantment with the political outcomes of recent military interventions in Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya has emptied political support for accrued European Union involvement in the Syrian and Ukrainian crisis. Further strengthening of European Union sanctions regime against Russia faces internal dissent from several EU member States (Austria, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Greece, Cyprus, Spain, Hungary, Italy, Portugal, Finland) besides being largely ignored by European multinationals (German and Italian companies have most investment exposure in Russia) who bypass the sanctions regime by trading with Russia via third-countries (Turkey, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Israel). A 2015 Pew Research survey indicated that Europeans are by and large not favourable to a military deployment by their country under the terms of NATO Article 5 to protect a fellow member country which comes under attack.|$|E

Before the pair could develop the script, the Writers Guild of America (WGA) went on strike and Maibaum was unable to {{continue}} writing, leaving Wilson {{to work on the}} script on his own. The script—initially called Licence Revoked—was written with Dalton's characterisation of Bond in mind; <b>the</b> <b>obsession</b> with which Bond pursues the drug lord villain Franz Sanchez on behalf of Bond's friend, the CIA/DEA agent Felix Leiter and his dead wife is seen as being because of Bond's own [...] "brutally cut-short marriage".|$|E
