In the late 1930s, some local affiliates proposed shifting <b>their</b> <b>emphasis</b> from civil liberties appellate actions, to becoming a legal aid society, centered on store front offices in low income neighborhoods. The ACLU directors rejected that proposal. Other ACLU members wanted the ACLU to shift focus into the political arena, and to {{be more willing to}} compromise their ideals in order to strike deals with politicians. This initiative was also rejected by the ACLU leadership.|$|E
5|$|Among the {{described}} subspecies, a 1989 morphometrical {{study by}} Humphrey and Setzer separated only two—O. p. natator from much of Florida (including O. p. coloratus, O. p. planirostris, O. p. sanibeli, and O. p. floridanus, {{as well as}} O. p. argentatus) and O. p. palustris {{from the rest of}} the range (including O. p. texensis). However, Whitaker and Hamilton in their 1998 book on the Mammals of the Eastern United States recognized O. p. planirostris and O. p. sanibeli as separate subspecies, but merged all others into O. p. palustris, and placed O.argentatus as a separate species; their classification was based on <b>their</b> <b>emphasis</b> of overwater gaps as agents of biological diversification and a critique of shortcomings in Humphrey and Setzer's study, not on a reanalysis of the data.|$|E

5|$|In 1856, while Tchaikovsky {{was still}} at the School of Jurisprudence and Anton Rubinstein lobbied aristocrats to form the RMS, critic Vladimir Stasov and an 18-year-old pianist, Mily Balakirev, met and agreed upon a {{nationalist}} agenda for Russian music, one that would take the operas of Mikhail Glinka as a model and incorporate elements from folk music, reject traditional Western practices and use exotic harmonic devices such as the whole tone and octatonic scales. They saw Western-style conservatories as unnecessary and antipathetic to fostering native talent. Eventually, Balakirev, César Cui, Modest Mussorgsky, Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov and Alexander Borodin {{became known as the}} moguchaya kuchka, translated into English as the Mighty Handful or The Five. Rubinstein criticized <b>their</b> <b>emphasis</b> on amateur efforts in musical composition; Balakirev and later Mussorgsky attacked Rubinstein for his musical conservatism and his belief in professional music training.

5|$|Nineteenth-century Egyptologists {{studied the}} temples intensively, but <b>their</b> <b>emphasis</b> was on {{collection}} of artifacts {{to send to}} their own countries, and their slipshod excavation methods often did further harm. Slowly the antique-hunting attitude toward Egyptian monuments gave way to careful study and preservation efforts. The government also took greater control of archaeological activity as Egypt's independence from foreign powers increased. Yet even in recent times the ancient remains have faced threats. The most severe was {{the construction of the}} Aswan High Dam in the 1960s, which threatened to submerge the temples in what had been Lower Nubia beneath the newly formed Lake Nasser. A major effort by the United Nations disassembled some of the threatened monuments and rebuilt them on higher ground, and the Egyptian government gave several of the others, such as Dendur, Taffeh, and Debod, as gifts to nations that had contributed to the preservation effort. Nevertheless, several other temples vanished beneath the lake.|$|E

In the first section I explore Lacanian ideas of extimacy, excess and Möbius subjectivity to subvert a simplistic self-other dichotomy and briefly consider some implications of this subversion for neoliberal educational policy. In the second part of the paper, I extend the critique of neoliberal education policy by examining it through the lens of Lacan’s four discourses. This involves viewing neoliberal policy agendas in terms of “discourses of mastery, ” before turning to “discourses of thinking otherwise ” as a way of thinking what “the other side of education ” might look like...|$|R
