5|$|According to Peter Woolley, {{director}} of Fairleigh Dickinson University's PublicMind poll, {{the situation of}} the election was similar to the 1990 election, when underdog Senate candidate Christie Whitman, a Republican, nearly defeated well-known Senator Bill Bradley due to Democratic Governor Jim Florio's sales- and income-tax increases. By August, Woolley concluded <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>tax</b> increase had had no effect on Menendez's re-election chances.|$|E

5|$|Senate Majority Leader Dole and Gingrich {{appointed}} Kemp {{to head a}} {{tax reform}} commission, (the Kemp Commission), in response to voter concern <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>tax</b> code had become too complicated. Kemp championed many issues including the flat tax, which he formally proposed after he was appointed. The proposal included some politically popular income tax deductions, such as mortgage interest, but it remained fairly general. Among the 1996 Republican Party candidates, both Steve Forbes and Phil Gramm proposed the flat tax.|$|E

40|$|Proponents of estate, inheritance, {{and gift}} (EIG) <b>taxes</b> admit <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>taxes</b> {{generate}} little revenue, but claim <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>taxes</b> provide a social benefit by preventing {{the accumulation of}} wealth {{in the hands of}} generational dynasties. Evidence presented here suggests that EIG taxes actually cost states more in lost revenue than they generate, that they negatively impact smaller firms disproportionately versus larger firms, and <b>that</b> they promote <b>the</b> concentration of wealth by preventing small businesses from being passed on to heirs...|$|R
5|$|The DAP {{sought to}} {{pressure}} Robert Lau Hui Yew over the government's proposed Goods and Services Tax, arguing <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>tax</b> would increase prices for consumers {{in one of}} Malaysia's poorest states. The DAP, through its leader Lim Kit Siang also pressured Hui Yew to speak up against the government's education policy, claiming that Hui Yew's choice to have his children educated overseas demonstrated his {{lack of confidence in}} Malaysian education. On education, the DAP also criticised SUPP's involvement in the sale of the Laila Taib College, previously known as United College Sarawak, to the Yayasan Sarawak (Sarawak Foundation) for the price of one ringgit, when the local Chinese population had donated money to fund the college's building.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} of diversifying revenues, as three-fourths of revenue gathered was from commerce with Great Britain, Hamilton attempted once again during his Report on Public Credit when presenting it in 1790 to implement an excise tax both imported and domestic spirits. The taxation rate was graduated {{in proportion to}} the whiskey proof, and Hamilton intended to equalize the tax burden on imported spirits with imported and domestic liquor. In lieu of the excise on production citizens could pay 60 cents by the gallon of dispensing capacity, along with an exemption on small stills used exclusively for domestic consumption. He realized the loathing <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>tax</b> would receive in rural areas, but thought of the taxing of spirits more reasonable than land taxes.|$|E
5|$|More than 175 {{people showed}} up for a rancorous public hearing over the {{purchase}} on April6, 2011. During the hearing, members of the Rosendale town board determined <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>tax</b> income from the entire property was {{much less than the}} cost of renting part of it for parking. Residents brought up several issues, such as the liability the town would assume from falling rocks, and sinkholes. Other issues discussed were the lack of road access to the parking lot, and whether the property should be used commercially. An individual living adjacent to the property, Brett Hansen, expressed a strong desire to buy it and build additional parking lots, as well as an amphitheater. Proponents of the purchase described how ownership of Joppenbergh would allow Rosendale to connect the Wallkill Valley Rail Trail with Main Street, and how property values near the mountain would increase. The town board agreed to the purchase in a 3–2 vote on April13.|$|E

5|$|The chief tax {{imposed by}} Charles was a feudal levy known as ship money, which proved even more unpopular, and lucrative, than {{poundage}} and tonnage before it. Previously, collection of ship money had been authorised only during wars, and only on coastal regions. Charles, however, {{argued that there}} was no legal bar to collecting the tax for defence during peacetime and throughout the whole of the kingdom. Ship money, paid directly to the Treasury of the Navy, provided between £150,000 to £200,000 annually between 1634 and 1638, after which yields declined. Opposition to ship money steadily grew, but the 12 common law judges of England declared <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>tax</b> was within the king's prerogative, though some of them had reservations. The prosecution of John Hampden for non-payment in 1637–38 provided a platform for popular protest, and the judges only found against Hampden by the narrow margin of 7–5.|$|E
25|$|A tax protester {{is someone}} who refuses to pay a tax {{claiming}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>tax</b> laws are unconstitutional or otherwise invalid. Tax protesters are different from tax resisters, who refuse to pay taxes as a protest against the government or its policies, not out of a belief <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>tax</b> law itself is invalid. The United States has a large and organized culture of people who espouse such theories. Tax protesters also exist in other countries.|$|E

25|$|This {{pressure}} on the lower classes was compounded by the recent poll tax on sheep. This would have affected the region significantly, the West Country being an area of sheep farming.

25|$|House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt {{said the}} middle class will not benefit enough from the tax cut and the wealthy will reap unfairly high benefits.

25|$|Critics {{indicate}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>tax</b> revenues {{would have}} been considerably higher if the tax cuts had not been made.

The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has estimated that extending the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts (which were scheduled to expire in 2010) would cost the U.S. Treasury nearly $1.8 trillion in the following decade, dramatically increasing federal deficits.|$|E
25|$|The Bush {{administration}} had claimed, {{based on the}} concept of the Laffer Curve, <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>tax</b> cuts actually paid for the themselves by generating enough extra revenue from additional economic growth to offset the lower taxation rates.
