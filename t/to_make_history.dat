After touring India in 1976 Hadlee, plagued by stomach troubles, had decided never to play cricket there again, however the opportunity <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>history</b> was too strong a lure to pass up. He duly captured the record, and his 374th test wicket, in the first test of the series. In the second test a 10 wicket haul helped New Zealand to a rare test win in India, although the series was eventually lost 2–1.|$|E

25|$|The 2007 Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race saw Wild Oats XI {{equal the}} 59-year-old record of Morna, by winning a hat-trick of line honours titles.

The 2008 race was not without difficulty for the crew though, as they picked up debris in Sydney Harbour which added excess drag, and also collided with a two-metre (6.5foot) shark. The crew felt that the collision may have actually assisted them by dislodging the snag from their hull.|$|E

500|$|This was a Team {{of history}} makers. Torah Bright became Australia's most {{successful}} female Winter Olympian {{by adding a}} silver medal to her gold from Vancouver in 2010. In Sochi, Bright was the only athlete to attempt three Snowboard events at the one Olympics: Slopestyle, Halfpipe and Snowboard Cross. David Morris, Australia’s only male Aerialist at the Sochi Games wrote his own piece of Olympic history by completing a double-full full-full (quad twisting somersault) in the men’s Freestyle Skiing – Aerials super-final. Morris scored 110.41 points for his jump and was awarded the silver medal. He was later honoured for his achievement by carrying the Australian flag in the Closing Ceremony. Aerials teammate and defending Olympic Aerial Skiing Champion Lydia Lassila was in Sochi <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>history.</b> Lydia chose to execute a jump in the women’s super-final that no other woman {{in the history of}} the sport had attempted in competition, a quad twisting triple somersault. The high degree of difficulty jump scored her 72.12 points and the bronze medal. This historical effort has taken the sport of women’s Aerials to a whole new level. Lassila is also the first mother to win a Winter Olympic medal for Australia. [...] Bobsleigh’s Jana Pittman became the first female Olympian to compete in both a Summer and Winter Olympics. Callum and Aimee Watson became the first siblings to compete at the same Games in Cross Country. Alex Almoukov pulled off the best ever performance by a male Australian biathlete when he finished 45th in the 20km Individual. Other historic bests were John Farrow finishing 17th in the men’s Skeleton, Belle Brockhoff, eighth in the women’s Snowboard Cross and Kent Callister, ninth in the men’s Snowboard Halfpipe.|$|E

2500|$|Priestley's {{philosophy}} {{was founded on}} the fervent belief that {{a thorough understanding of}} history was necessary not only to worldly success but also to spiritual growth. He wrote: [...] "my view was, not merely <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>history</b> intelligible to persons who may choose to read it for amusement, but ... to facilitate its subserviency to the highest uses to which it can be applied: to contribute to its forming the able statesman and the intelligent and useful citizen." [...] His abiding interest in history, particularly modern history, sets Priestley apart from his contemporaries. Priestley {{was the first person to}} advocate the serious study of modern history; no other British university was teaching the subject at the time and Oxford would not begin until 1841.|$|E

A recurring theme of War and Peace is that certain events are just fated to happen, and there is nothing that a leader can do to challenge destiny, a view of history that dramatically discounts leadership as a factor in history. During the Soviet period, historians engaged in what Lieven called huge distortions <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>history</b> fit with Communist ideology, with Marshal Kutuzov and Prince Bagration transformed into peasant generals, Alexander I alternatively ignored or vilified, and the war becoming a massive [...] "People's War" [...] fought by the ordinary people of Russia with almost no involvement {{on the part of the}} government. During the Cold War, many Western historians were inclined to see Russia as [...] "the enemy", and there was a tendency to downplay and dismiss Russia's contributions to the defeat of Napoleon. As such, Napoleon's claim that the Russians did not defeat him and he was just the victim of fate in 1812 was very appealing to many Western historians.|$|E

2500|$|In 1896 the {{association}} appointed a [...] "Committee of Seven" [...] {{to develop a}} national standard for college admission requirements {{in the field of}} history. Before this time, individual colleges defined their own entrance requirements. After substantial surveys of prevailing teaching methods, emphases and curricula in secondary schools, the Committee published [...] "The Study of History in Schools" [...] in 1898. Their report largely defined the way history would be taught {{at the high school level}} as a preparation for college, and wrestled with issues about how the field should relate to the other social studies. The Committee recommended four blocks of Western history, to be taught in chronological order—ancient, medieval and modern European, English, and American history and civil government—and advised that teachers [...] "tell a story" [...] and [...] "bring out dramatic aspects" [...] <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>history</b> come alive.he student who is taught to consider political subjects in school, who is led to look at matters historically, has some mental equipment for a comprehension of the political and social problems that will confront him in everyday life, and has received practical preparation for social adaptation and for forceful participation in civic activities.... The pupil should see the growth of the institutions which surround him; he should see the work of men; he should study the living concrete facts of the past; he should know of nations that have risen and fallen; he should see tyranny, vulgarity, greed, benevolence, patriotism, self-sacrifice, brought out in the lives and works of men. So strongly has this very thought taken hold of writers of civil government, that they no longer content themselves with a description of the government as it is, but describe at considerable length the origin and development of the institutions of which they speak.|$|E

60|$|Another {{interesting}} {{feature of}} recent times {{is the importance}} attached to historical and biographical works, which have increased so rapidly since 1876 that there is now no period of American life and no important character or event that lacks its historian. The number of such works is astonishing, but their general lack of style and broad human interest places them outside {{of the field of}} literature. The tendency of recent historical writing, for example, is to collect facts about persons or events rather than to reproduce the persons or events so vividly that the past lives again before our eyes. The result of such writing is <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>history</b> a puppet show in which dead figures are moved about by unseen economic forces; meanwhile the only record that lives in literature is the one that represents history as it really was in the making; that is, as a drama of living, self-directing men.|$|E
