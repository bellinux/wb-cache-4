5|$|In September 2000, Harries' {{portfolio}} {{was significantly}} expanded {{when he was}} appointed Granada's controller of drama, following the resignations of Sue Hogg and Simon Lewis. 2002 commissions included Doctor Zhivago and Henry VIII. ITV would provide only £750,000 for each hour of the serials, so Harries approached US broadcaster WGBH <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> remaining funds. Following the merging of Granada Films with Granada Productions in 2002, Harries' brief was expanded to include films.|$|E

5|$|Richard Sheridan {{continued}} as theatre owner {{during the entire}} lifetime of this third building. He had grown in stature as a statesman during this time, but troubled finances were to be his undoing. The 1794 rebuilding had cost double the original estimate of £80,000, and Sheridan bore {{the entirety of the}} debt. Productions were more expensive to mount in the larger structure, and increased audience revenues failed <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> difference.|$|E
5|$|The players {{went out}} on strike in week 3. The main demand was free agency for all players with at least four years of service. The weekend's games were {{cancelled}} as the owners prepared teams of replacement players. According to owner Hugh Culverhouse, {{it would not be}} feasible <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> cancelled games, with the TV networks already having their schedules set for the open weekend following the season.|$|E
5|$|Aside from {{reinforcing}} Luso-Rhodesian relations, the Lisbon {{appointment was}} designed to secure the African nation a diplomatic foothold in Europe outside of Britain's reach and to help Salisbury find new trading partners and diplomatic allies on the continent. Among other things, the Rhodesians intended <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> shortfalls in military equipment caused by the undeclared Anglo-American arms embargo. Reedman, the former minister for immigration and tourism, was also a retired officer of the British Royal Air Force (where he {{had been involved in}} bomber research), and an experienced engineer and businessman: all the right ingredients, the government thought, for someone in the position to source European aircraft, weapons and other equipment, while also representing Rhodesian interests in mainland Europe.|$|E

5|$|During this time, Johnson's {{future was}} {{uncertain}} {{because his father}} was deeply in debt. To earn money, Johnson began to stitch books for his father, {{and it is likely}} that Johnson spent much time in his father's bookshop reading and building his literary knowledge. The family remained in poverty until Sarah Johnson's cousin, Elizabeth Harriotts, died in February 1728 and left enough money to send Johnson to university. On 31 October 1728, a few weeks after he turned 19, Johnson entered Pembroke College, Oxford. The inheritance did not cover all of his expenses at Pembroke, but Andrew Corbet, a friend and fellow student at Pembroke, offered <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> deficit.|$|E
5|$|Florida State's offense {{returned}} to the field with 4:35 remaining and needing to score rapidly in order <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> 18-point deficit, the game's largest. The Seminoles began their drive with their passing offense, trying three passes in four plays. Quarterback Manuel completed two of those three pass attempts, gaining 37 yards and advancing deep into Virginia Tech territory. A pass interference penalty against Virginia Tech advanced the Seminoles to the Tech 11-yard line, and three rushing plays later, running back Ty Jones crossed the goal line for a touchdown. The score came with 1:40 remaining in the quarter and brought the score to 35–24.|$|E
5|$|On 31 October 1728, a {{few weeks}} after he turned 19, Johnson entered Pembroke College, Oxford as a fellow-commoner. The {{inheritance}} did not cover all of his expenses at Pembroke, but Andrew Corbet, a friend and student at Pembroke, offered <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> deficit. Corbet left Pembroke soon after Johnson arrived, so this source of aid disappeared. To meet the expenses, Michael Johnson allowed his son to borrow a hundred books from his bookshop, at a great cost to himself, and these books were not fully returned to Michael until many years later.|$|E

5|$|Originally, the French {{team were}} {{scheduled}} to play a team from the United States, but the latter withdrew from the competition as three of their team were {{taking place in the}} hammer throw at the same time. The Scandinavians were accepted as late entrants by the organisers, and their team was composed primarily of athletes who were competing in other events, though it also included a journalist, Edgar Aabye, <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> numbers. The mixed team won each of the first two pulls against the French in a best-of-three contest to win the gold medal. Due to a second, unofficial, match subsequently taking place between the United States and the Scandinavians, some records have erroneously listed the United States as gold medalists.|$|E
5|$|Portions of {{the film}} were shot {{on a beach in}} Qantab, on the {{corniche}} in Qurum, and at the Shangri-La's Barr Al Jissah Resort & Spa in Muscat. When director Milan Luthria became ill with a virus, shooting was postponed for three days. <b>To</b> <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> lost time Luthria persuaded Kumar to work on two consecutive Sundays, {{the first time he had}} worked on a Sunday since Priyadarshan's 2006 Bhagam Bhag. The remainder {{of the film}} was shot on location in Khala, on the Sassoon Docks and at Mukesh Mills in Mumbai. The shoot was wrapped up by January 2013.|$|E
5|$|The 18th Battalion {{was formed}} in September 1939 {{under the command of}} Lieutenant Colonel John Gray. It was the first of three {{infantry}} battalions designated <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> first echelon of the 2nd New Zealand Division, destined for overseas service. Its personnel, all volunteers, were drawn from the Northern Military District, which took in the upper half of the North Island of New Zealand. They were formed into four rifle companies, designated A to D and corresponding to the Auckland, Hauraki/Bay of Plenty/Rotorua, Northland and Waikato districts. A headquarters company included the specialist support troops; signallers, anti-aircraft and mortar platoons, pioneers and transport as well as administrative personnel.|$|E

5|$|The 20th Battalion {{was formed}} in Christchurch at Burnham Military Camp in early October with Lieutenant Colonel Howard Kippenberger, an {{experienced}} Territorial Force soldier. It {{was the last of}} the three infantry battalions designated <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> first echelon of the 2nd New Zealand Division, destined for overseas service. Its personnel, all volunteers, were from the South Island of New Zealand. They were formed into four rifle companies, designated A to D and corresponding to the Canterbury, Southland, Nelson-Marlborough-West Coast and Otago districts. A headquarters company included the specialist support troops; signallers, anti-aircraft and mortar platoons, and transport personnel.|$|E
5|$|The foreign {{exchange}} rules also oblige Icelandic residents to deposit any new foreign currency they receive with an Icelandic bank. There is anecdotal evidence that some Icelandic exporters had been operating an informal offshore {{foreign exchange}} market, trading pounds and euros for krónur outside {{the control of}} any regulator and starving the onshore market of foreign currency. Hence the Central Bank had to sell €124 million of currency reserves in November 2008 <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> difference, compared with an estimated trade surplus of €13.9 million.|$|E
5|$|This eventuality was foreseen. At the three-power Bermuda Conference with President Dwight D. Eisenhower in December 1953, the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, {{suggested}} that the United States allow Britain {{to have access to}} American nuclear weapons <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> shortfall. There were several technical and legal issues. For American bombs to be carried in British aircraft, the United States would have to disclose their weights and dimensions, while their delivery would require data concerning their ballistics. The release of such information was restricted by the McMahon Act. Further down the line, there would also be issues of custody, security and targeting.|$|E

Will and Vince D'Angelo (Bobby Cannavale) have since reconciled, and are raising a son, Ben. Karen and Jack grow tired {{of the fact that}} Will and Grace are not {{speaking}} with each other, so they lure them to the same place and force them <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>up.</b> <b>The</b> four meet at Will and Vince's apartment, and even though Will and Grace have a pleasant evening together, they find that too much has changed between them, and drift apart.|$|E
5|$|After Urilla's death, Wyatt {{went through}} a {{downward}} spiral and {{had a series of}} legal problems. On March 14, 1871, Barton County filed a lawsuit against Earp and his sureties. Earp was in charge of collecting license fees for Lamar, which funded local schools, and he was accused of failing to turn in the fees. On March 31, James Cromwell filed a lawsuit against Earp, alleging that Earp had falsified court documents about the amount of money collected from Cromwell to satisfy a judgment. <b>To</b> <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> difference between what Earp turned in and Cromwell owed (which he claimed to have paid), the court seized Cromwell's mowing machine and sold it for $38. Cromwell's suit claimed that Earp owed him $75, the estimated value of the machine.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} early sauropodomorphs, {{it has been}} {{proposed}} that Massospondylus had cheeks. This theory was proposed {{because there are a}} few large holes for blood vessels on the surfaces of the jaw bones, unlike the numerous small holes present on the jaws of cheekless reptiles. The cheeks would have prevented food from spilling out when Massospondylus ate. Crompton and Attridge (1986) described skulls of Massospondylus as possessing pronounced overbites and suggested the presence of a horny beak on the tip of the lower jaw <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> difference in length and account for tooth wear on the teeth {{at the tip of the}} snout. However, the difference in length may be a misinterpretation based on crushing in a top–bottom plane, and the possession of a beak is considered unlikely in recent studies.|$|E
