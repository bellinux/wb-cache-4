5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>Ethics</b> Committee {{ruled that}} Cranston had acted {{improperly}} by {{interfering with the}} investigation by the FHLBB. He had received {{more than a million}} dollars from Keating, including $850,000 to the voter registration groups closely affiliated with him; he had done more arm-twisting than the other Senators on Keating's behalf; and he was the only senator officially rebuked by the Senate in this matter.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>Ethics</b> Committee's {{investigation}} {{began on}} November 17, 1989. It focused on all five senators and lasted 22 months, with 9 months of active investigation and 7 weeks of hearings. The committee {{was composed of}} three Democratic senators, Howell Heflin (chair), David Pryor, and Terry Sanford, and three Republican senators, Warren Rudman (vice chair), Trent Lott, and Jesse Helms. Washington attorney Robert S. Bennett was appointed as special outside counsel to the committee, tasked with conducting the investigation.|$|E
5|$|Cranston {{was given}} the harshest penalty of all five senators. In November 1991, <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>Ethics</b> Committee voted {{unanimously}} to reprimand Cranston, instead of the more severe measure that was under consideration: censure by the full Senate. Extenuating circumstances that helped to save Cranston from censure included {{the fact that he}} was suffering from cancer, and that he had decided to not seek reelection, according to Heflin. The Ethics Committee took the unusual step of delivering its reprimand to Cranston during a formal session of the full Senate, with almost all 100 Senators present.|$|E
5000|$|Despite {{serving on}} <b>the</b> <b>Senate's</b> <b>Ethics</b> Subcommittee Senator Garcia {{has been criticized}} for using her public {{position}} to protect her bar's interests when cited for serving minors and serving intoxicated patrons.|$|R
500|$|In 1991, it {{was also}} {{revealed}} that Hatfield had failed to report a number of expensive gifts {{from the president of}} the University of South Carolina, James B. Holderman. Again, he apologized. But <b>the</b> <b>Senate's</b> <b>Ethics</b> Committee rebuked Hatfield for the latter act.|$|R
50|$|BPR was {{described}} in 2012 as having {{close ties to the}} Conservative Party of Canada. Leo Housakos was hired in late 2008 to oversee one of BPR's wholly owned subsidiaries and, shortly thereafter, was appointed to <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> of Canada by Canadian prime minister Stephen Harper. He remained employed with the BPR subsidiary until October 2009, when he was advised by <b>the</b> <b>Senate's</b> <b>ethics</b> officer that he could not simultaneously fill both roles. An investigation cleared him of any conflict-of-interest pertaining to his time with the firm.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>Ethics</b> Committee did not pursue, {{for lack}} of jurisdiction, any {{possible}} ethics breaches in McCain's delayed reimbursements to Keating for trips at the latter's expense, because they occurred while McCain was in the House. The House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct said that it too lacked jurisdiction, because McCain {{was no longer in}} the House. It said it did not require that McCain amend his existing financial disclosure forms for his House years, on the grounds that McCain had now fully reimbursed Keating's company.|$|E
5|$|On September 25, 1989, several Republicans from Ohio {{filed an}} ethics {{complaint}} against Glenn, charging {{that he had}} improperly intervened on Keating's behalf. The initial charges against the five Senators were made on October 13, 1989, by Common Cause, a public interest group, who asked for the U.S. Justice Department and <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>Ethics</b> Committee to investigate {{the actions of the}} senators relative to Lincoln and the contributions received from Keating and whether they violated the rules of the Senate or federal election laws. But the most public attention came from the House Banking Committee, whose new chair Henry B. Gonzalez held 50hours of hearings into the Lincoln failure and associated events.|$|E

5000|$|On May 25, 2007, Veja {{magazine}} accused Calheiros {{of accepting}} funds from a construction industry lobbyist, to {{pay child support}} for a child from a previous extramarital affair with broadcast journalist [...] In trying to justify {{the origin of the}} funds, subsequent investigations into Calheiros' business dealings led to other revelations of income tax fraud and the use of a proxy to buy a stake in a radio station. Calheiros was subject to a disciplinary inquiry by <b>the</b> <b>senate's</b> <b>ethics</b> committee on four different counts. On September 12, 2007, <b>the</b> <b>senate</b> voted by secret ballot against impeaching Calheiros on the lobbyist funds accusation. He still faces three separate inquiries on other charges. After the vote public outrage forced congress to eliminate secret ballot voting for ethics violations, meaning Calheiros' three other inquiries, if approved by the ethics committee, will be subject to an open ballot vote in <b>the</b> <b>senate</b> floor.|$|R
25|$|Following the AP report, Allen asked <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>ethics</b> {{committee}} for {{an opinion on}} whether he should have disclosed his options. The ethics committee ruled than Allen was not required to disclose his stock options, and did not err in not doing so.|$|E
25|$|In May 2011, <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>Ethics</b> Committee {{identified}} Coburn {{in their}} {{report on the}} ethics violations of Senator John Ensign. The report stated that Coburn knew about Ensign's extramarital affair and was {{involved in trying to}} negotiate a financial settlement to cover it up.|$|E
25|$|That {{same week}} <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>Ethics</b> Committee began an {{investigation}} into the matter, but dropped it the following month concluding that the dealings did not violate the Senate's standards of conduct or conflict-of-interest rules. Later that same month the Chronicle reported on another dealing by the Senator. Since 1999, Perata's campaign fund and various other political committees had paid Exit Strategies more than $743,000, according to campaign finance documents. Exit Strategies, a political direct mail firm, was launched in 1999 by Perata's son, Nick, and based at his father's Alameda County home. By their own accounting, Exit Strategies paid the senator nearly $138,000 during the same period for rent and consulting fees. <b>The</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>Ethics</b> Committee again ruled that this was not an actionable violation, but it raised questions into the propriety of the relationship.|$|E

50|$|Three {{days after}} his {{conviction}} for extortion, on February 28, MacKenzie resigned as Assistant Minority Floor Leader. However, he refused to resign his <b>Senate</b> seat. <b>The</b> conduct of MacKenzie and DiCarlo was referred to <b>the</b> newly formed <b>Senate</b> <b>Ethics</b> Committee, and on March 31, 1977, {{the day before the}} committee was to issue its report, MacKenzie resigned from <b>the</b> <b>Senate.</b>|$|R
25|$|On November 17, 1989, <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>Ethics</b> Committee {{investigation}} began of the Keating Five, Alan Cranston (D–CA), Dennis DeConcini (D–AZ), John Glenn (D–OH), John McCain (R–AZ), and Donald W.

Ensign and his family returned to Las Vegas after his resignation from the U.S. Senate, where he renewed his practice as a veterinarian and works at Boca Park Animal Hospital.|$|E
25|$|When <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>Ethics</b> {{committee}} {{needed someone}} to review Republican senator Bob Packwood's diaries, the committee chose Starr. In 1990, Starr was the leading candidate for the U.S.Supreme Court nomination after William Brennan's retirement. He encountered strong resistance from the Department of Justice leadership, which feared that Starr might not be reliably conservative as a Supreme Court justice. George H. W. Bush nominated David Souter instead of Starr.|$|E

25|$|From 1999 to 2005, Reid {{served as}} Senate Democratic Whip, as {{minority}} whip from 1999 to 2001, and again from 2003 to 2005. Reid was majority whip from 2001 to 2003, {{except for a}} brief period from January to May 2001. From 2001 to 2003, he served as chairman of <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>Ethics</b> Committee. Reid succeeded Tom Daschle as minority leader in 2005, and became majority leader after the 2006 election until 2015.|$|E
25|$|While Senator Pete Domenici had {{declared}} that he would seek re-election in New Mexico, {{he changed his mind}} and announced on October 4, 2007 that he was retiring {{at the end of his}} current term due to a degenerative brain disorder. Domenici normally would have been expected to win re-election easily, having won his current term with the support of two out of three New Mexico voters; however, he is to be investigated by <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>Ethics</b> Committee for his role in firing U.S. Attorney David Iglesias. Domenici's role in the developing scandal had reduced the probability he would have been re-elected, and a SurveyUSA poll showed his approval ratings at 41%, with 54% disapproving. The potential scandal may have also contributed to his decision to leave the Senate.|$|E
500|$|<b>The</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>Ethics</b> Committee {{ruled that}} the {{involvement}} of Glenn in the scheme was minimal, and {{the charges against him}} were dropped. He was only criticized by the Committee for [...] "poor judgment." ...|$|E
50|$|An ethics {{complaint}} was filed against Hartsell with <b>the</b> North Carolina <b>Senate</b> <b>Ethics</b> Committee alleging conflict-of-interest {{based on his}} past legal representation of a developer and the Water and Sewer Authority of Cabarrus County.

500|$|Not {{everyone}} {{was satisfied with}} <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>Ethics</b> Committee conclusions. Fred Wertheimer, president of Common Cause, which had initially demanded the investigation, thought {{the treatment of the}} senators far too lenient, and said, [...] " [...] action by <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>Ethics</b> Committee is a cop-out and a damning indictment of the committee," [...] and [...] "The U.S. Senate remains on the auction block to the Charles Keatings of the world." [...] Joan Claybrook, president of Public Citizen, called it a [...] "whitewash". Jonathan Alter of Newsweek said it was a classic case of the government trying to investigate itself, labeling <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>Ethics</b> Committee [...] "shameless" [...] for having [...] "let four of the infamous Keating Five off with a wrist tap." [...] The New York Times ran several editorials criticizing the Ethics Committee for having let the senators off lightly. Margaret Carlson of Time suspected the committee had timed its first report to coincide with the run-up to the Gulf War, minimizing its news impact. One of the San Francisco bank regulators felt that McCain had gotten off too lightly, saying that Keating's business involvement with Cindy McCain was an obvious conflict of interest.|$|E
500|$|Regardless of {{the level}} of their involvement, both {{senators}} were greatly affected by it. McCain would write in 2002 that attending the two April 1987 meetings was [...] "the worst mistake of my life". Glenn described <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>Ethics</b> Committee investigation as the low point of his life.|$|E
500|$|<b>The</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>Ethics</b> Committee {{ruled that}} Riegle and DeConcini had acted {{improperly}} by {{interfering with the}} investigation by the FHLBB. Specifically, it said that even though neither of them violated any Senate rule, their conduct [...] "gave the appearance of being improper." [...] DeConcini was especially faulted for having {{taken the lead in}} the two meetings with the FHLBB.|$|E
5000|$|The {{official}} {{invitation for}} the event read: [...] "While this trip has proven itself to be an enjoyable one for delegation members in the past, it is, nevertheless, an official trip authorized by <b>the</b> House and <b>Senate</b> <b>Ethics</b> Committees [...] [...] [...] intended to {{provide an opportunity for}} Members of Congress and Congressional staff to inspect and evaluate the manner in which federal funds have been used to strengthen the area's tourism industry." ...|$|R
