5|$|The Flyers {{chose not}} to offer Oates a new {{contract}} following the loss, making him an unrestricted free agent. He signed a $3.5 million contract for the 2002–03 season, with an option for 2003–04, with <b>the</b> <b>Mighty</b> Ducks of Anaheim on July 1, 2002. He scored 45 points in 67 games with <b>the</b> <b>Mighty</b> Ducks, and added 13 points in 21 playoff games. Anaheim reached the 2003 Stanley Cup Finals, where in the third game of the series against the New Jersey Devils, Oates assisted on Ruslan Salei's overtime winning goal. It was Oates' ninth career playoff overtime point, tying him with Joe Sakic and Doug Gilmour for the NHL all-time lead. The Ducks ultimately lost the series in seven games.|$|E

5|$|A top {{prospect}} {{heading into}} the off-season, Kariya was projected to be selected between second and fifth overall in the 1993 NHL Entry Draft. Kariya went on to be chosen fourth overall by <b>the</b> <b>Mighty</b> Ducks of Anaheim, one of the League's two expansion teams. In addition to becoming Anaheim's first-ever draft pick, he also became the second-highest pick from Vancouver (after Barry Beck was chosen by the Colorado Rockies second overall in 1977). Following his draft, Kariya returned to the University of Maine for his sophomore year as team captain. He had been voted by his teammates for the role, along with defenceman Chris Imes. With Imes joining the United States' national team full-time in 1993–94, however, Kariya returned as the lone captain. Kariya was also committed to the Canadian national team {{in preparation for the}} 1994 Winter Olympics and left the Black Bears in December 1993. Following the Olympics, Kariya chose not to return to Maine, foregoing his remaining college hockey eligibility to turn professional with <b>the</b> <b>Mighty</b> Ducks. He finished the season with seven goals and 41 points over 23 games with the national team, as well as eight goals and 24 points over 12 games with Maine.|$|E
