He said that he wanted to write this no matter what and quickly drew up an outline for the premise of Ayu's scenario. At the time, Ayu's premise was the start of the entire Kanon story, though it was still very vague. Eventually, Hisaya was able to form her story into the style of a romance visual novel, and in the process the characters in the story started to multiply. Hisaya said that Ayu was the one character in Kanon that he felt he grasped the best, but noted {{it was very difficult to}} write her character due to Ayu being primarily energetic. Hisaya said that he is much better at writing about quiet characters, so Ayu gave him a lot of trouble.

This theory was first elaborated in <b>the</b> book <b>Natural</b> Symbols, <b>written</b> by anthropologist Mary Douglas in 1970. Douglas later worked closely with the political scientist Aaron Wildavsky, to clarify the theory.

In this paper we target this phenomenon and introduce the first dataset created from closed captions of YouTube product review videos {{as well as}} a new attention-RNN model for aspect extraction and joint aspect extraction and sentiment classification. Our model provides state-of-the-art performance on aspect extraction without requiring the usage of hand-crafted features on the SemEval ABSA corpus, while it outperforms the baseline on the joint task. In our dataset, the attention-RNN model outperforms the baseline for both tasks, but we observe important performance drops for all models in comparison to SemEval. These results, as well as further experiments on domain adaptation for aspect extraction, suggest that differences between speech and written text, which have been discussed extensively in the literature, also extend to the domain of product reviews, where they are relevant for fine-grained opinion mining.

40|$|The Jesuits {{that lived}} and worked in South America made {{important}} contributions to the knowledge about New World nature in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. This knowledge was reflected in several published and unpublished natural histories, as well as in herbals and letters that circulated among the members of the Society of Jesus. Although the production of knowledge about <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> world was not one of the stated goals of the Society of Jesus in South America, the work of José de Acosta (1540 - 1600), Bernabé Cobo (1580 - 1657), Alonso de Ovalle (1601 - 1651), Diego de Rosales (1603 - 1677) or Nicolás Mascardi (1624 - 1673), among others, demonstrate that the study of American nature was constant during the seventeenth century. All of them made their contributions to the study of American nature while fulfilling academic, pastoral or administrative duties within the different Jesuit missions and colleges in Peru, Chile, Bolivia, Argentina, and Paraguay. The variety of tasks that these South American Jesuits carried out allows us to understand the importance that the study of nature had for the spiritual, pastoral, missionary, and political goals of the Society of Jesus in South America. In this dissertation, I trace the links of Jesuit science in South America with contemporary scientific ideas and practices in Europe, as well as with native knowledge about <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> world. At <b>the</b> same time, I study how the colonial condition of South America shaped the institutional development of the order, which made possible the production of scientific knowledge by its members. By studying <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> histories <b>written</b> by <b>the</b> Jesuits in South America, I aim both to re-inscribe the science produced in the Spanish colonies within the larger frame of current debates about seventeenth century Jesuit science, and to understand the centrality that the study of nature had for the Jesuit educational and missionary agenda. ...|$|R
