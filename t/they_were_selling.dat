Regular tickets went on sale on July 19.

5|$|In March 1985, Partnair {{was granted}} {{concession}} for scheduled services from Fornebu via Notodden to Stavanger. The route was started on 15 August using a ten-seat Beechcraft 200 Super King Air and flew twice a day, {{five days a}} week. This route was made possible after an instrument landing system was installed at the airport. The NOK2 million cost had been paid for by Norsk Hydro, while Tinfos had paid NOK100,000 for new landing lights. The upgrades also included a new terminal, which included a café in the second story and seating for 14 people. Ticket sales and check-in was managed by NSB Reisebyrå, {{a subsidiary of the}} Norwegian State Railways. After five months, Partnair had lost NOK1.2 million on the route. In average, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>selling</b> three to four tickets per flight to Stavanger, and one to Oslo. From March 1986, the leg from Notodden to Oslo was dropped and the service to Stavanger reduced. However, the route proved unprofitable and was eventually terminated later the same month.|$|E

5|$|With {{the powers}} of the King's Clerk abolished, the bailiffs of Norwich set about {{regulating}} the operation of the market for what they felt was the greatest benefit to the city. To encourage fair competition among the market's traders, it was forbidden to sell foodstuffs before the Cathedral bell had tolled for Lady Mass (6.00am). The practice of forestalling (meeting merchants {{on their way to the}} market either to buy their goods for resale, or to prevent them from attending the market and thus make goods of the type <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>selling</b> scarce and hence more expensive) was forbidden. Trading anywhere other than in the market was strongly discouraged and the right to re-sell goods at a profit was restricted to Freemen of the city. The prices of bread and beer were fixed, and a set of standardised weights and measures was introduced, against which measures used by merchants would regularly be checked. Shortly after the transfer of the market to the city a market cross was erected near the centre of the main market (opposite the present day entrance to Davey Place), the design of which is not recorded.|$|E

The problem was accelerated because the sales force lacked intricate knowledge of the industries <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>selling</b> to.|$|E
25|$|The Europeans found a large {{supply of}} ivory, but found the local Bari had little {{interest}} in anything <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>selling.</b> As a result, the merchants often turned to force, seizing the ivory, even this proved not to be economical and the merchant ventures had little success. Christian missionaries also established posts in the region, with the Catholic Apostolic Vicariate of Central Africa, covering the region. The missionaries also had little impact on the region in the early 19th century.|$|E

25|$|In 1986 the new Ontario {{government}} announced {{their intention to}} sell UTDC to Lavalin, a large engineering company in Montreal. Lavalin purchased the company for only CAD$50 million, less than the $70 million spent on the UTDC by the government up to 1981. The sale was highly controversial at the time, due to several non-performance payments due to the early problems on the ICTS {{that had to be}} paid out by the government, to the tune of $39 million. Soon after, Hawker Siddeley announced that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>selling</b> their remaining interest in Can-Car to Lavalin as well.|$|E

25|$|To collect {{revenue from}} commerce, the state {{installed}} customs checkposts (sungachavadi) along the highways and the ports. In the ports, duty was collected on inland goods, before being exported, and on overseas goods {{meant for the}} local markets, which were stamped with the official seal before being allowed into the country. The volume of trade in the port cities was high enough to warrant a large workforce to monitor and assess the goods. The state issued licenses to liquor shops, which were required to fly the license flag outside their premises. Flags were used by foreign merchants too, to indicate the nature of goods <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>selling.</b> The state also kept records of the weights and counts of all the goods sold by merchants. One of {{the significant aspects of}} the state intervention in commerce was that it reinforced the authority of the ruler.|$|E
25|$|On 17 December 2007, Daimler {{announced}} that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>selling</b> their entire complex of 19 buildings at Potsdamer Platz to SEB Asset Management, a Frankfurt-based {{subsidiary of the}} Swedish banking group SEB. On 28 February 2008, Sony made a similar announcement, of impending sale to a consortium led by American investment banking giant (now bank holding company) Morgan Stanley. Both deals were finalised {{by the end of}} March 2008. Whilst the amounts involved have not been publicly disclosed, it is believed that neither Daimler nor Sony recouped all of their original investments (what Daimler managed to get was reportedly well short). The long-term benefits (or otherwise) of these sales, remain to be seen, but whilst they may have baffled many people at the time, they may turn out to have been a shrewd move, as Daimler and Sony have avoided being saddled with something they might have found much harder to sell at a later date, just when they needed the cash the most.|$|E

This decision {{was part of a}} partnership agreement they had with US-based real estate firm Clarion Partners. Fibra Uno agreed to inherit a US$74.3 million debt and pay US$200.5 million in trust certificates. Garza Treviño explained that as part of the trust law, Grupo Garza Ponce and Clarion Partners owned half of the assets that were sold, which meant that each part was to receive US$137.4 million for the transaction. Garza Treviño stated that the money would be used to construct two additional industrial parks. Fibra Uno's general director Gonzalo Robina clarified that of the 29 industrial parks acquired, 14 of them were in Nuevo León, 13 were in either Chihuahua and Tamaulipas, one in San Luis Potosí, and another one—valued at US$50 million, the highest of the transaction—was in Saltillo, Coahuila.|$|E

25|$|Result: Odyssey {{got off to}} {{a strong}} start, as team leader Patrick had a lot of {{experience}} in the fashion industry. However, as {{he was the only one}} on his team to know anything about it, he had to spend a lot of time telling the others what could sell, which left less time for him to lead the team. Patrick also designed a kimono/wetsuit, which drew customers to the stall, but failed to sell. Halfway through the day, Patrick made the decision to leave the shopping centre <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>selling</b> at to try their luck selling to retailers. They had little success doing this however, and had to resort to selling all their customized stock to one retailer for £40, losing nearly £100 on the cost of creating them. On the girls' team, Ashleigh led from the front and made firm decisions, but the clothes they chose did not sell as well as on the boys' team. Nonetheless, the sub-team at the shopping centre managed to attract many customers, and eventually the team made a profit of £453.36, while Odyssey made a profit of £330.37.|$|E
