After {{one third of the}} treatment period more than 99 % of the remaining tumour consists of doomed cells. Therefore, it would appear to be impossible to assess the therapeutic response of tumours directly from biopsy material taken during treatment. Nevertheless, attempts to study the therapeutic response during treatment have been made in order to obtain prognostic information on individuals so as to individualize treatment.

40|$|Background/Aims: Cardiac {{fibrosis}} after {{myocardial infarction}} (MI) {{has been identified}} as a key factor in the development of heart failure, but <b>the</b> <b>mechanisms</b> <b>undelying</b> cardiac fibrosis remained unknown. microRNAs (miRNAs) are novel mechanisms leading to fibrotic diseases, including cardiac fibrosis. Previous studies revealed that miR- 22 might be a potential target. However, the roles and mechanisms of miR- 22 in cardiac fibrosis remained ill defined. The present study thus addressed the impact of miR- 22 in cardiac fibrosis. Methods: After seven days following coronary artery occlusion in mice, tissues used for histology were collected and processed for Masson's Trichrome staining. In addition, cardiac fibroblasts were transfected with mimics and inhibitors of miR- 22 using Lipofectamin 2000, and luciferase activity was measured in cell lysates using a luciferase assay kit. Western blotting was used to detect the expression of collagen 1, α-SMA and TGFβRI proteins levels, and real time-PCR was employed to measure the Col 1 α 1, Col 3 α 1, miR- 22 and TGFβRI mRNA levels. Results: In this study, we found that miR- 22 was dynamically downregulated following MI induced by permanent ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery for 7 days, an effect paralleled by significant collagen deposition. Inhibition of miR- 22 with AMO- 22 resulted in increased expression of Col 1 α 1, Col 3 α 1 and fibrogenesis in cultured cardiac fibroblasts. Conversely, overexpression of miR- 22 in cultured cardiac fibroblasts significantly abrogated angiotensin II-induced collagen formation and fibrogenesis. Furthermore, we found that TGFβRI is a direct target for miR- 22, and downregulation of TGFβR may have mediated the antifibrotic effect of miR- 22. Conclusion: Our data clearly demonstrate that miR- 22 acts as a novel negative regulator of angiotensin II-induced cardiac fibrosis by suppressing the expression of TGFβRI in the heart and may represent a new potential therapeutic target for treating cardiac fibrosis...|$|R

Though following the Basis-based method, the new approach provides a nonlinear estimator by incorporating the feature of thresholding shrinkage. In an attempt to remove those significantly small coefficients measuring the detailed structure of <b>the</b> <b>undelying</b> curve while retain those large ones measuring the gross structure, we reconstruct the original model by an orthogonal transformation to detect those nonzero coefficients. The nonzero eigenvalue or singular values of the design matrix can be used as such indications for the smoothness of the underlying function is in proportion to the singular values. Consequently the use of singular value decomposition is proposed. This allows us to reduce high dimensionality and to find reasonable estimators. Then the minimization of the high-dimensional penalized least squares reduces to componentwise minimization problems and the solutions can be easily obtained with relevant thresholding rules and parameters as well. Therefore the selection of an optimal thresholding parameter and resulting thresholding rules is the crucial part of our method.

40|$|In 1996, the Australian {{electricity}} {{market was}} liberalised and the National Electricity Market Man-aging Company (NEMMCO) {{was established to}} manage the pool of electricity used by generators and retailers. Although the electricity market is new, the contracts traded over the counter and on exchange range from vanilla swaps to exotic options and other more complex contracts compared to capital mar-kets. Nevertheless, there is no standard methodology for pricing such contracts {{as is the case}} of products in nancial markets, where closed-form solutions of Black and Scholes type are commonly used. There has been substantial research aiming to produce a benchmark pricing methodology for forward electricity contracts. However, the forward pricing problem based on spot electricity prices remains unsolved because the underlying asset (electricity) is not storable (economically) and cannot be traded from one period to the next. In this paper, we 8 ̆ 5 rst examine the characteristics of NSW electricity pool prices and look at the relationship between the spot price average and the forward price. We then apply the theory of trading claims on non-tradeable assets (real options) to electricity. The resulting forward price depends on the volume underlying the contract, the spot price weekly averages for previous periods, the market price of risk and the interest rate. In conclusion, this paper sets up a new methodology for pricing electrcity forwards, where the resulting prices are more intuitive in capturing the market parameters as well as the characteristics of <b>the</b> <b>undelying</b> contract. ...|$|R

40|$|There {{are various}} {{situations}} where {{one has to}} deal with the problem of fitting a surface to a set of noisy measurement data, corresponding to points that are arbitrary distributed in a bounded area of the plane. For many applications it is important that the fitted surface preserves certain geometric properties of <b>the</b> surface <b>undelying</b> <b>the</b> data. In some cases, the shape preservation is essential for the fitted surface to be physically meaningful. In others, the use of a constrained surface fitting method can avoid improper bumps and holes that might be present in a surface fitted with the unconstrained method. In this thesis algorithms are presented for smoothing scattered data with a convexity, nonnegativity or monotonicity preserving surface or with a surface subject to boundary constrains. As for the approximating functions, Powell-Sabin (PS) splines on conforming triangles are used. These piecewise quadratics with C 1 -continuity are expressed as a linear combination of locally supported basis functions (B-splines) which are fairly easy to construct. Necessary and sufficient shape preserving conditions for the PS-splines are then formulated in terms of the B-spline coefficients. Due to the local support of the B-splines, these constraints are sparse, which can be exploited to efficiently solve the problem. In the presented algorithms a local refinement procedure for the trangulation problem is included that automatically takes account of the difficulties in the function underlying the data. Numerical examples are supplied to illustrate the profit of surface fitting by means of constrained Powell-Sabin splines. nrpages: xl+ 135 pagesstatus: publishe...|$|R

Our aim was to quantify the impacts of increased N inputs on soil C fluxes such as C mineralization and leaching of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from different litter materials and native SOM. We added 5. 5 g N m! 2 yr! 1 as NH 4 NO 3 over 1 year to two beech forest stands on calcareous soils in the Swiss Jura. We replaced the native litter layer with 13 C-depleted twigs and leaves (d 13 C: ! 38. 4 and ! 40. 8 &) in late fall and measured N effects on litter- and SOM-derived C fluxes. Nitrogen addition did not significantly affect annual C losses through mineralization, but altered the temporal dynamics in litter mineralization: increased N inputs stimulated initial mineralization during winter (leaves: + 25 %; twigs: + 22 %), but suppressed rates in the subsequent summer. The switch from a positive to a negative response occurred earlier and more strongly for leaves than for twigs (! 21 % vs. 0 %). Nitrogen addition did not influence microbial respiration from the nonlabeled calcareous mineral soil below the litter which contrasts with recent meta-analysis primarily based on acidic soils. Leaching of DOC from the litter layer was not affected by NH 4 NO 3 additions, but DOC fluxes from the mineral soils at 5 and 10 cm depth were significantly reduced by 17 %. The 13 C tracking indicated that litter-derived C contributed less than 15 % of the DOC flux from the mineral soil, with N additions not affecting this fraction. Hence, the suppressed DOC fluxes from the mineral soil at higher N inputs {{can be attributed to}} reduced mobilization of nonlitter derived ‘older’ DOC. We relate this decline to an altered solute chemistry by NH 4 NO 3 additions, an increased ionic strength and acidification resulting from nitrifi- cation, rather than to a change in microbial decomposition...|$|R

Induced overexpression of this gene mediated enhanced overall metastatic disease, and resulted in an increased incidence of spontaneous CNS metastases. In contrast, the overexpression of other highlighted genes, such as bcl 2 a 1, {{did not affect the}} incidence of CNS metastases but nevertheless appears to facilitate intracranial tumor growth. The pro-metastatic effect in the CNS associated with EDNRB appears to be mediated by the interaction with its ligands resulting in enhanced tumor cell proliferation and thus intracranial melanoma growth. That EDRNB contributes to melanoma metastasis is underscored by the fact that its therapeutic inhibition by the EDNRB-specific inhibitor, A 192621, translated into improved outcomes when treating mice with either visceral metastases or intracranial tumors. The identification of an influential role of EDNRB in CNS melanoma spontaneous metastasis may provide both a target for therapeutic intervention as well as a potential prognostic marker for patients having an increased predisposition for incidence of CNS melanoma metastases.

40|$|The {{object of}} this thesis {{is the study}} in depth of {{mortality}} and mortality crises as well as <b>the</b> <b>undelying</b> population dynamics. From the methodological point of view, this research stands at the crossroad between demography and historical demography, and takes {{the eighteenth and nineteenth}} centuries as its time span. The space scope is provided by the set of parishes that nowadays form the municipality of Castelo Branco, an inland town in the center of Portugal. The analysis of the population dynamics demanded a meticulous work in the formal and comparative critique of available sources, specially as far as the eighteenth century is concerned. As to the nineteenth century, better statistical sources are available, but the quality of these sources had to be tested all the same, and corrective techniques of population structures were essayed, so that a homogeneous analysis of their evolution along the century might be developed. The study of mortality crises, the focal point of this thesis, followed the general methodological guidelines developed in a set of works on this theme, namely thesis submitted for the degree of master or doctor in this faculty and in the universities of Evora and Oporto. However, other methodological orientations were also considered, which enable a comparative analysis of the results reached. The study in depth of so-called normal mortality was particularly focused on the second half of the nineteenth century. The methodology in use was, in this case, particular to contemporary demography, but special caution was taken as demanded by the nature of the statistical material of the period. The study of the spatial structure, from the point of view of death-rate variations, benefited from a long term analysis, which accowed the perception of the both geographical continuities and discontinuities as far as mortality is concerned.

In all cases, the onset temperature for gelation during cooling and the moduli recorded at 5 'C increased With increasing concentration of cosolute. However, both values were substantially lower for the liquid cosolutes than for mixtures with solid cosolutes at the same concentrations. The difference is attributed to inhibition of pectin-pectin interactions by pectin-cosolute interactions, which in turn are inhibited by cosolute-cosolute interactions. On heating there was an initial reduction in modulus, with the same temperature-course as the increase on cooling; for the solids, this was followed by an increase attributable to hydrophobic association of methyl ester substituents.

It is informed by an action research perspective using interviews and focus groups with yoga teachers and allied health professionals and the personal experiences of the researcher teaching yoga in an addiction recovery centre {{as well as a}} literature search on existing yoga and meditation programs used in addiction recovery and corrections. The research explores whether yoga could be applied as a complementary therapy in social work and how yoga assists in addiction recovery. Further it explores what programmatic requirements are needed for a constructive yoga program that addresses the needs of yoga teachers in this field and the participants who are very marginalised. The emerging themes and issues from the data and literature were explored and triangulation was used to draw one conclusion that was found consistently across all research methodologies. This was the importance of Kriya yoga. or the yoga of action, to achieve results with yoga as a complementary therapy.
