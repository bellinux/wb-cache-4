25|$|Surgery may be {{performed}} {{before or after}} other forms of treatment. Treatment before surgery {{is often described as}} neoadjuvant. In breast cancer, the survival rate of patients who receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy are no different to those who are treated following surgery. Giving chemotherapy earlier allows oncologists <b>to</b> <b>evaluate</b> <b>the</b> <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> the therapy, and may make removal of the tumor easier.

25|$|Studies {{have been}} {{performed}} <b>to</b> <b>evaluate</b> <b>the</b> <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> miRNAs as potential markers for cancers. MicroRNAs have shown promise in this area due to their stability and specificity to cells and tumors. A recent study investigated the use of miRNA as a biomarker in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, a form of pancreatic cancer. The study analyzed RNA from biopsied pancreatic cysts to identify deviations in expression of miRNAs. The study found that 228 miRNAs were expressed differently relative to normal pancreatic cells. Included in the findings was an association between hepatocellular carcinoma and the upregulation of miR-92a, a member of OncomiR-1.|$|E
25|$|Insulin pumps, cartridges, and {{infusion}} sets may be {{far more}} expensive than syringes used for insulin injection with several insulin pumps costing more than $6,000; necessary supplies can cost over $300. Another disadvantage of insulin pump use is {{a higher risk of}} developing diabetic ketoacidosis if the pump malfunctions. This can happen if the pump battery is discharged, if the insulin is inactivated by heat exposure, if the insulin reservoir runs empty, the tubing becomes loose and insulin leaks rather than being injected, or if the cannula becomes bent or kinked in the body, preventing delivery. Therefore, pump users typically monitor their blood sugars more frequently <b>to</b> <b>evaluate</b> <b>the</b> <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> insulin delivery.|$|E

25|$|Though no {{formulation}} of progesterone is approved for use via sublingual administration, {{a few studies}} have investigated the use of progesterone by this route. A study of sublingual progesterone for luteal support in patients undergoing embryo transfer found that after sublingual administration of 50 or 100nbsp&mg progesterone dissolved in a 1nbsp&mL suspension, peak levels of progesterone were reached in 30 to 60 minutes and were on average 17.61nbsp&ng/mL with the 100-mg dose. However, the duration was short and re-administration had to be done two or three times per day for adequate circulating levels of progesterone to be maintained throughout the day. Another study found that sublingual progesterone had to be administered at a dose of 400nbsp&mg every 8nbsp&hours to achieve circulating levels similar to those produced by 100nbsp&mg/day intramuscular progesterone. Further clinical research is necessary <b>to</b> <b>evaluate</b> <b>the</b> <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> progesterone via the sublingual route of administration.|$|E

While King George V and Ajax were scrapped, Centurion was demilitarized by the removal of her armament and was converted into a radio-controlled target ship. In addition to {{being used as a}} target for surface ships, Centurion was used <b>to</b> <b>evaluate</b> <b>the</b> <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> various types of aerial bombing. During the Second World War, she was rearmed with light weapons and was converted into a blockship in 1941. In preparation for that operation (subsequently cancelled), she was modified into a decoy with dummy gun turrets in an attempt to fool the Axis powers. Centurion was sent to the Mediterranean in 1942 to escort a convoy to Malta, although the Italians may have figured out the deception. The ship was scuttled off Omaha Beach in June 1944 to form a breakwater to protect a mulberry harbour built to supply the forces ashore.|$|E

500|$|Thunderer was {{the sixth}} ship {{of her name}} {{to serve in the}} Royal Navy and was laid down by the Thames Ironworks and Shipbuilding Company at their {{shipyard}} in Poplar, London on 13 April 1910 and launched on 1 February 1911. She was commissioned on 15 June 1912 at Devonport. Including her armament, her cost is variously quoted at £1,892,823 or £1,885,145. Thunderer and her sister ships comprised the Second Division of the 2nd Battle Squadron (BS) of the Home Fleet. The ship, together with her sisters [...] and , participated in the Parliamentary Naval Review on 9 July at Spithead. They then participated in training manoeuvres with Vice-Admiral Prince Louis of Battenberg commanding the [...] "Blue Fleet" [...] aboard Thunderer. On 13 November, the ship participated in comparative gunnery trials with Orion <b>to</b> <b>evaluate</b> <b>the</b> <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> the former's gunnery director. Thunderer decisively outshot the latter ship, although some of her success was because her director was above the smoke that obscured the target from Orions guns. The test was repeated in better conditions on 4 December and Orion performed much better, apparently beating Thunderer. The three sisters were present with the 2nd BS to receive the President of France, Raymond Poincaré, at Spithead on 24 June 1913. During the annual manoeuvres in August, Thunderer was the flagship of Vice-Admiral Sir John Jellicoe, commander of the [...] "Red Fleet".

500|$|Orion, {{named after}} the mythological hunter, Orion, was the fourth ship of her name {{to serve in the}} Royal Navy (RN). The ship was laid down at HM Dockyard, Portsmouth on 29 November 1909. She was {{launched}} on 20 August 1910, and was commissioned on 2 January 1912. Including her armament, her cost is variously quoted at £1,855,917 or £1,918,773. Orion was assigned to the 2nd division of the Home Fleet as the flagship of Rear-Admiral Sir Herbert King-Hall, the division's second-in-command. The ship was slightly damaged on 7 January when the pre-dreadnought battleship [...] broke loose from her [...] and collided with Orions bow. The division was redesignated as the 2nd Battle Squadron (BS) on 1 May. The ship, together with her sister ships [...] and , participated in the Parliamentary Naval Review on 9 July at Spithead. They then participated in training manoeuvres. King-Hall was relieved by Rear-Admiral Rosslyn Wemyss on 29 October.

2500|$|Biofeedback {{is often}} used <b>to</b> <b>evaluate</b> <b>the</b> <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> {{relaxation}} training, because it feeds back information to the chronic headache sufferer about the [...] "body's (biological) current state". One {{of the most common}} biofeedback tests is the Electromyograph (EMG), which evaluates the “electrical activity” produced by muscles. Biofeedback also can measure electrical brain activity through a test called the Electroencephalograph (EEG). Another test, called the thermograph, measures skin temperature, because when a person is relaxed they have increased blood flow and a higher temperature. Another method is BVP biofeedback training, which improves chronic headaches by teaching a patient how to regulate and decrease arterial pulse amplitudes by restricting the arteries. When tense, a person's sweat gland activity increases, which is measured by electrodermograph testing of the hands. Biofeedback methods have been proven to work. A study involving fifteen treatment sessions found that biofeedback was [...] "successful in reducing both frequency and severity of headache at discharge and over time". Biofeedback allows headache sufferers to identify problems and then seek to reduce them.|$|E
