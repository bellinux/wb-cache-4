5|$|Surrounding {{the floral}} tube and corona and reflexed (bent back) {{from the rest}} of the {{perianth}} are the six spreading tepals or floral leaves, in two whorls which may be distally ascending, reflexed (folded back), or lanceolate. Like many monocotyledons, the perianth is homochlamydeous, that is undifferentiated into separate calyx (sepals) and corolla (petals), but rather has six tepals. The three outer <b>tepal</b> segments may be considered sepals, and the three inner segments petals. The transition point between the floral tube and the corona is marked by the insertion of the free tepals on the fused perianth.|$|E

25|$|Fritillaria is a genus of {{herbaceous}} bulbous perennials. It is characterised by nodding (pendant) flowers, perianths campanulate (bell- or cup-shaped) with erect {{segments in}} upper part, a nectarial pit, groove or pouch {{at the base}} of the <b>tepal,</b> anthers usually pseudobasifixed, rarely versatile, fruit sometimes winged, embryo minute.|$|E
50|$|Hyacinthoides cedretorum {{differs from}} {{other species of}} Hyacinthoides in the {{strongly}} revolute (curved backwards) form of the <b>tepals,</b> with the stamens being attached to the <b>tepals</b> only at their bases; in other species, the stamens are fused to the <b>tepals</b> along much of their length, and the <b>tepals</b> form a bell-like shape. The anthers and pollen are typically violet-blue, but populations from the High Atlas mountains have creamy-yellow pollen.|$|R

The solitary fruits are nearly globular capsules, they fall down when ripe and open with a circumscissile lid. The vertical seed contains an annular embryo and copious perisperm (feeding tissue).|$|E
25|$|The spike-like inflorescences {{consist of}} glomerules {{of one to}} three flowers sitting in the axils of leaf-like bracts. The free flowers are hermaphrodite. The {{perianth}} consists of five herbaceous, slightly keeled <b>tepal</b> lobes which are connate at base. There are five stamens opposite to the tepals, their filaments are fused at base forming a disc. The ovary is semi-inferior with 2 stigmas.|$|E

5000|$|Species of Dipcadi {{grow from}} small bulbs. The solitary flower stem (scape) bears a loose raceme of green or brown flowers, {{sometimes}} with different colours at {{the tips of}} the three inner <b>tepals.</b> The raceme is usually one-sided. The <b>tepals</b> are joined at the base for up to two thirds of their length to form a tube. The ends of the <b>tepals</b> then curve outwards, particularly the outer three. The outer three <b>tepals</b> may have a rounded [...] "spur" [...] at their tips.

Acis species are relatively short, up to [...] in Acis autumnalis and [...] in Acis tingitana. The leaves are narrow; very narrow (filiform) in Acis trichophylla. The flower stalks (scapes) are solid.|$|R
50|$|Tulipa polychroma is a {{perennial}} bulbous plant that grows between 6 and 17 cm tall. The bulb {{is small and}} has a leathery tunic, with woolly hairs on the inside, which are normally visible at {{the upper end of}} the bulb.It has one to two straplike deeply channelled dark green leaves that are longer than the stem. Normally only a single flower appears, but sometimes double flowers are found as well. The bud is upright, the six <b>tepals</b> are between 3,0 to 4,5 cm long. The outer <b>tepals</b> are between 0.3 and 1.5 cm wide, the inner <b>tepals</b> are wider, up to 2.5 cm. The <b>tepals</b> are oval or slightly pointed. The cup-shaped flowers are pure white, with a bright yellow centre that takes up about a third of the flower. The outside of the outer <b>tepals</b> is light grey-green, the back of the inner <b>tepals</b> are very faintly striped down the middle in bluish green. The tips of both inner and outer <b>tepals</b> can have a reddish tinge. Filaments and anthers are yellow.It flowers in late February, in England it is normally the first of the species tulips to flower.|$|R
2500|$|The carpellate flowers {{have been}} {{interpreted}} differently. When the genus was first described, [...] the two carpels {{were considered to}} belong to a single flower, each [...] "female" [...] flower having two carpels just as the [...] "male" [...] flowers have two stamens. This interpretation has been accepted by some later researchers. The [...] "scales" [...] then correspond to tepals of the single flower. The alternative interpretation, preferred by von Balthazar et al., is that there are two flowers very close together, each with a single carpel. Only the smaller [...] "scale" [...] might then correspond to a <b>tepal.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Magnolia is {{an ancient}} genus. Appearing before bees did, the flowers are theorized to have evolved to {{encourage}} pollination by beetles. To avoid damage from pollinating beetles, the carpels of Magnolia flowers are extremely tough. [...] Fossilised specimens of M. acuminata have been found dating to 20 million years ago, and of plants identifiably belonging to the Magnoliaceae date to 95 million years ago. Another aspect of Magnolia considered to represent an ancestral state is that the flower bud is enclosed in a bract rather than in sepals; the perianth parts are undifferentiated and called tepals rather than distinct sepals and petals. Magnolia shares the <b>tepal</b> characteristic with several other flowering plants near {{the base of the}} flowering plant lineage such as Amborella and Nymphaea (as well as with many more recently derived plants such as Lilium).|$|E
2500|$|The scape bears {{at the top}} a pair of bract-like spathe valves usually fused {{down one}} side and joined by a papery membrane, {{appearing}} monophyllous (single). From between them emerges a solitary (rarely two), pendulous, nodding, bell-shaped white flower, held on a slender pedicel. The flower bears six free perianth segments (tepals) rather than petals, arranged in two whorls of three, the outer whorl being larger and more convex than the inner series. The outer tepals are acute to more or less obtuse, spathulate or oblanceolate to narrowly obovate or linear, shortly clawed and erect spreading. The inner tepals are much shorter (half to two thirds as long), oblong, spathulate or oblanceolate, somewhat [...] (claw like) and tapered to the base and erect. These tepals also bear green markings at the base, apex or both that when at the apex are bridge-shaped over the small sinus (notch) {{at the tip of}} each <b>tepal,</b> which are emarginate. Occasionally the markings are either green-yellow, yellow or absent, and the shape and size varies by species.|$|E
5000|$|In {{some plants}} the flowers have no petals, {{and all the}} <b>tepals</b> are sepals {{modified}} to look like petals. These organs are described as petaloid, for example, the sepals of hellebores. When the undifferentiated <b>tepals</b> resemble petals, they are {{also referred to as}} [...] "petaloid", as in petaloid monocots, orders of monocots with brightly coloured <b>tepals.</b> Since they include Liliales, an alternative name is lilioid monocots.|$|R
40|$|Crocus sativus is {{the source}} of saffron spice, the {{processed}} stigma which accumulates glucosylated apocarotenoids known as crocins. Crocins are found in the stigmas of other Crocuses, determining the colourations observed from pale yellow to dark red. By contrast, <b>tepals</b> in Crocus species display a wider diversity of colours which range from purple, blue, yellow to white. In this study, we investigated whether the contribution of crocins to colour extends from stigmas to the <b>tepals</b> of yellow Crocus species. <b>Tepals</b> from seven species were analysed by UPLC-PDA and ESI-Q-TOF-MS/MS revealing {{for the first time the}} presence of highly glucosylated crocins in this tissue. b-carotene was found to be the precursor of these crocins and some of them were found to contain rhamnose, never before reported. When crocin profiles from <b>tepals</b> were compared with those from stigmas, clear differences were found, including the presence of new apocarotenoids in stigmas. Furthermore, each species showed a characteristic profile which was not correlated with the phylogenetic relationship among species. While gene expression analysis in <b>tepals</b> of genes involved in carotenoid metabolism showed that phytoene synthase was a key enzyme in apocarotenoid biosynthesis in <b>tepals.</b> Expression of a crocetin glucosyltransferase, previously identified in saffron, was detected in all the samples. The presence of crocins in <b>tepals</b> is compatible with the role of chromophores to attract pollinators.

The relevant bracts are lanceolate and much longer than the <b>tepals.</b> Their color is red-purple, with darker longitudinal venation. The outer <b>tepals</b> are lanceolate and erect, forming an helmet-like structure. Their color is purple-red or pinkish, with veins of darker color. The internal lateral <b>tepals</b> are brownish-purple and almost entirely hidden by the helmet.|$|R
2500|$|The {{structure}} of the staminate flowers has been interpreted differently. The original describers of the species, Aaron Goldberg and Cirilo Nelson, considered that each staminate flower was basically just a single stamen, with a flattened filament about 3â€“5mm long grading into an anther about 2.5mm long. Two staminate flowers from the original specimen were re-examined by Andrew Doust and Peter Stevens. They concluded that each staminate flower definitely had two anthers, closely pressed together. They were unable to make a firm choice between two interpretations. The first is that the staminate flowers are basically as described by Goldberg and Nelson, except there are two stamens with fused or closely pressed filaments and anthers rather than one. The second, which they preferred, is that Goldberg and Nelson's [...] "filament" [...] is actually a pedicel (i.e. a stem on which {{the parts of the}} flower are carried) and that their [...] "anther" [...] consists of two closely pressed structures each made up of a <b>tepal</b> with a fused anther inside it. Either way, the flowers of Haptanthus hazlettii have [...] "a morphology unlike that of any other angiosperm".|$|E
