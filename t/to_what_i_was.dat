Sometimes it's like seeing {{exactly what was going}} through my head when I first had that spark in my head as a kid. Jon Favreau's {{bringing}} his own talent and vision with the adaptation, {{but at the same time}} it remains true <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> really trying to get at in the original story." ...|$|E
500|$|After the event, Jenner took an American flag from {{a spectator}} {{and carried it}} during the victory lap, {{starting}} a tradition that is now common among winning athletes. Abandoning vaulting poles in the stadium, with no intention of ever competing again, Jenner stated that: [...] "In 1972, I {{made the decision that}} I would go four years and totally dedicate myself <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> doing, and then I would move on after it was over with. I went into that competition knowing that would be the last time I would ever do this." [...] Jenner explained, [...] "It hurts every day when you practice hard. Plus, when this decathlon is over, I got {{the rest of my life}} to recuperate. Who cares how bad it hurts?" ...|$|E
500|$|Jaya Bachchan as Nandini Raichand, Yash's wife. She {{shares a}} close bond with her sons but {{remains in the}} shadow of her husband. According to Karan Johar, Jaya Bachchan was the [...] "obvious" [...] choice for the {{character}} of Nandini, and added that her [...] "acting prowess and stature" [...] were the other reasons for him preferring to cast her. The film also marked the return of Amitabh and Jaya Bachchan together on screen after a gap of 18 years. Of her character, she said that Nandini was an extension of her own self. She elaborated, [...] "My personal feelings towards Shah Rukh are similar <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> supposed to portray in the film. There's something about him that makes me want to mother him." [...] She added that she modelled her character on Karan's mother, Hiroo Johar, who [...] "is a very emotional and sentimental person." ...|$|E

500|$|The Cure {{released}} {{their debut}} album Three Imaginary Boys in May 1979. Because of the band's inexperience in the studio, Parry and engineer Mike Hedges {{took control of}} the recording. The band, particularly Smith, were unhappy with the album; in a 1987 interview, he admitted, [...] "a lot of it was very superficial â€“ I didn't even like it at the time. There were criticisms made that it was very lightweight, and I thought they were justified. Even when we'd made it, I wanted to do something that I thought had more substance to it". The band's second single, [...] "Boys Don't Cry", was released in June. The Cure then embarked as the support band for Siouxsie and the Banshees' Join Hands promotional tour of England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales between August and October. The tour saw Smith pull double duty each night by performing with the Cure and as the guitarist with the Banshees when John McKay quit the group in Aberdeen. That musical experience had a strong impact on him: [...] "On stage that first night with the Banshees, I was blown away by how powerful I felt playing that kind of music. It was so different to what we were doing with the Cure. Before that, I'd wanted us to be like the Buzzcocks or Elvis Costello; the punk Beatles. Being a Banshee really changed my attitude <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> doing." ...|$|E
2500|$|Saddam {{continued}} {{involvement in}} politics abroad. Video tapes retrieved after show his intelligence chiefs meeting with Arab journalists, including {{a meeting with}} the former managing director of Al-Jazeera, Mohammed Jassem al-Ali, in 2000. In the video Saddam's son Uday advised al-Ali about hires in Al-Jazeera: [...] "During your last visit here along with your colleagues we talked about a number of issues, and it does appear that you indeed were listening <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> saying since changes took place and new faces came on board such as that lad, Mansour." [...] He was later sacked by Al-Jazeera.|$|E
2500|$|With 19 Recordings {{continuing}} to manage him, DeWyze chose {{to take an}} optimistic view {{of the situation and}} saw it as an opportunity to finally make the record that he had always wanted to make. Feeling that he had been misunderstood as an artist, he returned to a folk rock sound, more comparable to what had been present on his independent albums. Many people were surprised to hear him release music in this style and drew comparisons to Mumford & Sons, but DeWyze responded, [...] "anyone can go back and listen <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> doing when I was sixteen or seventeen years old, {{those are the kind of}} records that I was making then. I just wasn't able to put them out there like I am now." ...|$|E

2500|$|Robinson {{walked a}} step ahead of us, but when he noticed me hurrying to catch up, he {{shortened}} his stride to accommodate mine. I kept reaching up for his hand, but he hadn't looked down and seemed unaware. Fannie called his attention <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> doing, so he stopped short, bent low over me, his eyes wide and rows of brilliant teeth showing in a wide smile. When he took my hand in his, it felt large and cool. For a few moments, we continued walking in silence. [...] "Can I call you Uncle Billy?" [...] I asked. [...] "Why sure you can", he replied... "But then I get to call you darlin.'" [...] It was a deal. From then on, whenever we walked together it was hand in hand, and I was always his [...] "darlin.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Along with Beatles bandmate John Lennon {{and their}} wives, George Harrison first took the hallucinogenic drug Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) in April 1965, when a dentist friend {{slipped it into}} their after-dinner coffee. The {{heightened}} perception induced by the hallucinogen inspired both musicians in their subsequent work with the Beatles, notably on the albums Revolver (1966) and Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967), and led directly to a shared interest in Eastern philosophical concepts and meditation. Harrison later said of the profound change he felt {{as a result of}} first taking the drug: [...] "I had such an overwhelming feeling of well-being, that there was a God, and I could see him in every blade of grass. It was like gaining hundreds of years of experience within twelve hours. It changed me, {{and there was no way}} back <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> before." ...|$|E
2500|$|Joy Division's Peter Hook, who saw {{the group}} in concert in Manchester in 1977, said: [...] "Siouxsie and the Banshees were one of our big {{influences}} [...] The Banshees first LP {{was one of my}} favourite ever records, the way the guitarist and the drummer played was a really unusual way of playing". Joy Division producer Martin Hannett saw a difference between the Banshees' first main lineup and the other bands of 1977: [...] "Any harmonies you got were stark, to say the least, except for the odd exception, like Siouxsie. They were interesting". The Cure's leader, Robert Smith, declared in 2003: [...] "Siouxsie and the Banshees and Wire were the two bands I really admired. They meant something." [...] He also pinpointed what the 1979 Join Hands tour brought him musically. [...] "On stage that first night with the Banshees, I was blown away by how powerful I felt playing that kind of music. It was so different to what we were doing with the Cure. Before that, I'd wanted us to be like the Buzzcocks or Elvis Costello, the punk Beatles.
