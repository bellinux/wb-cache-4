500|$|Sculptor Trygve Rovelstad (1903–1990), born to Norwegian {{immigrants}} in the United States, sought to erect a statue {{in his hometown of}} Elgin as a monument to those pioneers who had settled Illinois. The city leaders approved, and in 1934, a foundation was laid for the statue in Davidson Park, the site of the Giffords' first cabin. Rovelstad was unable to raise the money to construct and erect the statue, but having learned of recent commemorative coin issues, decided <b>this</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> means of funding the statue. The sculptor had a bill introduced in Congress in May 1935 to authorize a half dollar to celebrate Elgin's centennial and to honor the pioneer. [...] Nevertheless, the bill initially was not considered.|$|E
500|$|The episode premiered to {{generally}} positive reviews. Although initially cringing {{over the}} musical premise, Ramsey Isler of IGN called the episode [...] "admittedly fun" [...] because it [...] "gave us an indirect window to view how Walter feels about himself". In {{a review of}} the DVD, another critic from IGN later called it the [...] "worst overall episode" [...] of the season however, asking the question [...] "Musical numbers and Olivia Dunham: who thought <b>this</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> idea?" [...] Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly was also initially irritated after hearing Fox's musical plans, and consequently gave [...] "Fringe {{a lot of credit for}} pulling off this hour so cleverly" [...] Jennifer Walker from TV Fanatic thought the episode was [...] "bizarre" [...] to watch; it [...] "held our interest for the entire 60 minutes, but really failed to introduce any new information about Peter and the unknown man that has crossed into our dimension". MTVs John Wigler loved the [...] "noir" [...] element, and thought [...] "each and every participating [...] "Fringe" [...] cast member exhibited great musical ability. Overall, it was a very solid effort on everyone's part". Jane Boursaw of TV Squad loved the scenes between Walter and Ella, and thought [...] "it was downright brilliant to create a story within a story". While he praised the episode's production and the singing abilities of the cast, Kurt Anthony Krug of Mania.com wrote a negative review: [...] "All in all, what was supposed to be a fun filler episode before the question of where Peter went at the end of the last episode when he found out he was the Peter from an alternate reality – one of the turning points in the show’s mythology – fell flat". Sarah Stegall of SFScope enjoyed it, writing [...] "There was just enough music, and just enough dance, to season this story without overburdening it". She praised the risktaking it took to make the episode [...] "edgy and whimsical, casting aside the concrete conventions of television storytelling...Not only was it entertaining, but it moved the storyline forward on some important emotional fronts, as the characters deal with Peter's disappearance in ways that protect them, but reveal as well".|$|E

2500|$|Henry Vane {{was a young}} aristocrat, and {{possibly}} the most socially prominent person {{to come to the}} Massachusetts Bay colony in the 1630s. [...] He was born in 1613 to Henry Vane the Elder, a Privy counsellor of Charles I and therefore {{one of the most powerful}} men in England. [...] The younger Vane had an intense religious experience when he was in his teens which left him confident of his salvation, and his ensuing beliefs did not conform with the established Anglican Church. [...] He came to New England with the blessing of William Laud, who thought that <b>this</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> place for him to get Puritanism out of his system. [...] He was 22 years old when he arrived in Boston on 6 October 1635, and his devoutness, social rank, and character lent him an air of greatness. Winthrop called him a [...] "noble gentleman" [...] in his journal.|$|E

6000|$|The Queen {{was in high}} good humour, as she had a {{right to}} be. She gave Mr. Gladstone ample credit for his conciliatory spirit.

60|$|The {{lower half}} of the Plate {{explains}} itself. The last figure of all, Fig. 65, is of interest, because it was drawn for an intelligent little girl of only 11 years old, after she had been closely questioned by the father, and it was accompanied by elaborate coloured illustrations of months and days of the week. I thought <b>this</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> test case, so I let the matter drop for two years, and then begged the father to question the child casually, and to send me a fresh account.
