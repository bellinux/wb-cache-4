He was rumored to have Pierce's backing for Speaker of the House, but he again deferred to Boyd; Maryland's Augustus R. Sollers spoiled Boyd's unanimous election by voting for Breckinridge. Still not given a committee chairmanship, he was assigned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ways</b> and Means Committee, where he secured passage of a bill to cover overspending in fiscal year 1853–1854; {{it was the only}} time in his career that he solely managed a bill. His attempts to increase Kentucky's allocation in a rivers and harbors bill were unsuccessful but popular with his Whig constituents.|$|E
5|$|The Queen had {{to mediate}} between her {{brothers}} in 1555, when Charles decided to abdicate as emperor {{and leave the}} government of the Netherlands to his son Philip, despite Ferdinand's objections. When Mary learned of Charles's decision, she informed him that she too would resign. Both Charles and Philip urged her to remain in the post, but she refused. She chronicled the difficulties she had faced due to her gender, the fact that she could not act as she thought she should have because of disagreements with Charles, and her age. Furthermore, she did not wish to accommodate <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> of her nephew after years of getting used to Charles's demands. The actual reason for Mary's resignation was her numerous disagreements with her nephew. She asked for Charles's permission to leave the Netherlands upon her resignation, fearing that she would be drawn into politics again if she remained.|$|E

25|$|And this {{contradictory}} {{nature of}} media, is in turn due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> that media are mediated in modern-day culture: “In short, mass-mediated products {{are determined by}} various factors—the systems of ownership, the process of cultural production, the level of struggle, the state of consciousness in society at a given time, and so on. A dialectical method of analysis would involve studying all these factors within a concrete historical context so as to explain the multiple mediations that infuse a product of culture” (85). For many of these new thinkers, the very way that new forms of media are mediated by social actors, or way that these actors navigate the complex and contradictory forces of history, the material world, and culture through media {{is the key to}} the age old problem of mediation in Marxist theory.|$|E
25|$|More generally, {{tradition}} {{has been used}} as a way of determining the political spectrum, with right-wing parties having a stronger affinity <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> of the past than left-wing ones. Here, the concept of adherence tradition is embodied by the political philosophy of traditionalist conservatism (or simply traditionalism), which emphasizes the need for the principles of natural law and transcendent moral order, hierarchy and organic unity, agrarianism, classicism and high culture, and the intersecting spheres of loyalty. Traditionalists would therefore reject the notions of individualism, liberalism, modernity, and social progress, but promote cultural and educational renewal, and revive interest in the church, the family, the state and local community. This view has been criticised for including in its notion of tradition practices which are no longer considered to be desirable, for example, stereotypical views of the place of women in domestic affairs.|$|E

25|$|Broadcast 25 January 1995, {{the next}} {{instalment}} is devoted <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> in which plants reproduce. Pollen and a stigma {{are the two}} components needed for fertilisation. Most plants carry both these within their flowers and rely on animals to transport the pollen {{from one to the}} stigma of another. To do this, they attract their couriers with colour, scent and nectar. It isn't just birds that help pollination: some mammals and reptiles also do so. However, it is mostly insects that are recruited to carry out the task. To ensure that pollen is not wasted by being delivered to the wrong flower, some species of plant have developed exclusive relationships with their visitors, and the gentian and its attendant carpenter bees is one example. Since pollen can be expensive to produce in terms of calories, some plants, such as orchids, ration it by means of pollinia and a strategically placed landing platform. Other orchids offer no reward for pollination, but instead mislead their guests by mimicking their markings and aroma, thus enticing males to 'mate' with them (Pseudocopulation). The most extreme fertilisation method is one of imprisonment, and one plant that uses it is the dead horse arum. It is often found near gull colonies, and mimics the appearance and smell of rotting flesh. Blow-flies are attracted to it, and are forced to stay the night before being allowed to depart in the morning, laden with pollen. Finally, Attenborough introduces the world's largest inflorescence: that of the titan arum.|$|E

500|$|In Romania, {{starting}} in the 1970s, the Nicolae Ceaușescu regime used a nationalistic and questionable interpretation of ancient history (Protochronism) {{as a way to}} legitimize its own rule. For instance, Burebista, a great conqueror, was seen as merely a [...] "unifier" [...] of the Dacian people. In 1980 the Romanian government declared a celebration of the 2050th anniversary of the founding of the [...] "unitary and centralized" [...] Dacian state of Burebista, drawing comparisons with Ceaușescu's Romania and claiming an uninterrupted existence of the state from Burebista to Ceaușescu. The epic movie Burebista (1980) based on the king's life was released that year, celebrating him as the Romanian pater patriae. This commemoration led the press to note [...] "similarities" [...] between Burebista and Ceaușescu, and even professional historians such as Ion Horațiu Crișan spoke about Burebista in ways similar <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> party activists spoke about Ceaușescu.|$|E

Jeremy Strick, director of the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles, described the feminist art movement as [...] "the most influential international movement of any during the postwar period", and Peggy Phelan says that it [...] "brought about the most far-reaching transformations in both artmaking and art writing {{over the past four}} decades". Feminist artist Judy Chicago, who created The Dinner Party, a set of vulva-themed ceramic plates in the 1970s, said in 2009 to ARTnews, [...] "There is still an institutional lag and an insistence on a male Eurocentric narrative. We are trying to change the future: to get girls and boys to realize that women's art is not an exception—it's a normal part of art history." [...] A feminist approach to the visual arts has most recently developed through Cyberfeminism and the posthuman turn, giving voice <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> [...] "contemporary female artists are dealing with gender, social media and the notion of embodiment".|$|E
