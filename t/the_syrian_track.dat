5000|$|The Psalter of Quzhaya {{comprises}} 268 pages (without numbering eight, then 260 pages numbering in <b>Syrian</b> letters). <b>The</b> headers of {{the pages}} bear in red <b>the</b> <b>Syrian</b> <b>tracks</b> Ktobo d-mazmuré (Book of Psalms).

The texts are arranged on the sides in two columns, left and right in Syriac Garschuni. Since the Arabic text is longer, the characters have different sizes to obtain the parallelism. On the first page there is the signature of Sarkis (Sergius Risius Archiepiscopus Damascenus) with its coat of arms and the following information: [...] "The revered hermitage of the Sacred Valley of Qozhaya in Mount Lebanon, work of the master Pasquale Eli and low Youssef ibn Amimeh de Karmsaddé called deacon, in 1610, of the Lord."

This effort also included obtaining a new US commitment from the Clinton administration to the September 1975 Ford letter, in which it was stated that the US would give great weight to Israel remaining on the Golan Heights. According to the Israeli Hebrew daily, Maariv, Christopher wrote this renewed commitment in a formal letter of assurances to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on September 19, 1996.|$|R
5|$|The Mastiff RPVs went {{in first}} to cause <b>the</b> <b>Syrian</b> SAMs {{to turn on}} their radars by convincing <b>the</b> <b>Syrians</b> that many attack {{aircraft}} were overhead. Once the Mastiffs were <b>tracked</b> by <b>Syrian</b> radar, <b>the</b> <b>tracking</b> signals were relayed to another Scout outside of the missiles' range. The Scout then relayed the signal to E2C Hawkeye aircraft orbiting off the coast. The data gathered was analyzed by the E2Cs and Boeing 707 ECM aircraft. Once the SAM crews fired missiles at the drones, the F-15s and F-16s provided air cover while F-4 Phantoms attacked the SAM batteries, destroying them with AGM-78 and AGM-45 anti-radiation missiles. The rapid flight time of the missiles minimized the F-4s' exposure to <b>the</b> SAMs. <b>The</b> <b>Syrians</b> reportedly fired 57 SA-6s, to no effect.|$|R
