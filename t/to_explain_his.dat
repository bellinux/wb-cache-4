5|$|Along {{with their}} regular training, Bobrov had the Soviet players take boxing lessons in {{preparation}} for the series. The Soviets arrived in Montreal not long before the series, on August 30. Staying at Montreal's Queen Elizabeth Hotel, the team began two-a-day workouts at the St. Laurent Arena the next day. They were already acclimatized to the time zone as the team had been training on Montreal time for two weeks before travelling there. They brought 15 forwards, nine defencemen and three goaltenders. Veteran defenceman Vitaly Davydov did not accompany the team to Canada. The reason given was injury, but the media questioned if Davydov had fallen out of favour with Bobrov.

5|$|Blandy ordered Warren <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>his</b> {{position}} to 1,400 skeptical officers and sailors. Some found him persuasive, {{but it was}} August 9 before he convinced Blandy.

Blandy {{was aware of the}} health problems of radium dial painters who ingested microscopic amounts of radium in the 1920s, and the fact that plutonium was assumed to have a similar biological effect.

5|$|Henry now {{appeared}} to his contemporaries {{to be stronger}} than ever, and he was courted as an ally by many European leaders and asked to arbitrate over international disputes in Spain and Germany. He was nonetheless busy resolving some of the weaknesses that he believed had exacerbated the revolt. Henry set about extending royal justice in England to reassert his authority and spent time in Normandy shoring up support amongst the barons. The King also made use of the growing Becket cult to increase his own prestige, using {{the power of the}} saint <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>his</b> victory in 1174, especially his success in capturing William.|$|E
5|$|In the mid- to late 1970s Kujau, an able amateur artist, {{turned to}} {{producing}} paintings which he claimed were by Hitler, {{who had been}} an amateur artist as a young man. Having found a market for his forged works, Kujau created Hitler paintings depicting subjects his buyers expressed interest in, such as cartoons, nudes and men in action—all subjects that Hitler never painted, or would want to paint, according to Charles Hamilton, a handwriting expert and author of books on forgery. These paintings were often accompanied by small notes, purportedly from Hitler. The paintings were profitable for Kujau. <b>To</b> <b>explain</b> <b>his</b> access to the memorabilia he invented several sources in East Germany, including a former Nazi general, the bribable director of a museum and his own brother, who he re-invented as a general in the East German army.|$|E

5|$|A former {{employee}} of Chandler's {{testified that he}} bragged about dating three women on the bay that night, and that {{the next morning he}} arrived and delivered materials for a job by boat and immediately set out again. In an attempt to establish Chandler's whereabouts {{on the night of the}} murders, investigators found records of several ship-to-shore telephone calls made from his boat to his home between 1:00am and 5:00am, which may have been attempts <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>his</b> absence to his wife, and to provide himself with an alibi for the time of the murders. Chandler's daughter, Kristal May Sue, testified that her father had talked about killing three women, and that he was afraid of returning to Tampa. A maid, who worked at the motel where the Rogers women stayed, testified that she walked past Chandler on June 1 as she was heading for the Rogers' room for room service. She said that she did not realize the significance of this sighting until Chandler's arrest in 1992; the sighting has never been confirmed. Michelle's boyfriend and Hal Rogers also took the stand during trial.|$|E
5|$|Aldaris is {{a member}} of the ruling judicator caste of Protoss society; in StarCraft he acts as liaison between the player {{character}} and the Protoss government. He is voiced by Paul Eiding in both StarCraft and Brood War. Aldaris is a fanatical believer in the Khala and does not hesitate to judge others through a strict interpretation of its tenets. As a result, he is outraged by Tassadar's association with the dark templar, and following the outbreak of war between the judicator caste and the templar caste, commands the government forces against Tassadar. Aldaris captures Tassadar and puts him on trial for crimes of blasphemy and treason, though Tassadar is freed by Fenix, Raynor, and Zeratul. Aldaris later witnesses the rebels successfully penetrate the Zerg's core defenses, and wishes them luck in their final battle against the Overmind. In Brood War, Aldaris reluctantly allies with the dark templar when the Protoss flee Aiur for Shakuras. However, when Sarah Kerrigan is accepted as an ally by dark templar matriarch Raszagal, Aldaris is furious. While Artanis and Zeratul are absent, he discovers Raszagal is being mentally controlled by Kerrigan and instigates a rebellion amongst the Khalai refugees. When his insurrection is thwarted, the judicator tries <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>his</b> actions to Artanis and Zeratul, but is murdered by Kerrigan before he can reveal her involvement.|$|E
5|$|Argentina {{suffered}} {{a terrorist attack}} in 1994, the AMIA bombing targeting a Buenos Aires Jewish center, that killed 85 people and wounded 300. The investigation remained open for years, and prosecutor Alberto Nisman {{was appointed to the}} case. He accused Iran of organizing the attack, and the Hezbollah group of carrying it out. He intended to prosecute five Iranian officials, including former Iranian president Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, but Argentina signed a memorandum of understanding with Iran for a joint investigation. Nisman accused the president of signing that memorandum for oil and trade benefits, according to hundreds of hours of wiretaps. On 19 January 2015 he was found dead at his home, a day before a congressional hearing <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>his</b> accusation, which caused a great controversy. As of 2016, both the cases of the AMIA bombing and the death of Nisman remain unresolved, and the courts declined at the time to investigate his denunciation of Kirchner.|$|E
