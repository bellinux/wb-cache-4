25|$|The {{causes of}} {{corporate}} failure, {{at least in}} the market segment of the economy, all begin of the creation of credit and debt. Occasionally excessive debts are run up through outright embezzlement of the company's assets or fraud by <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>run</b> the business. Negligent mismanagement, which is found to breach the duty of care, is also sometimes found. More frequently, companies go insolvent because of late payments. Another business on which the company relied for credit or supplies could also be in financial distress, and a string of failures could be part of a broader macroeconomic depression. Periodically, insolvencies occur because technology changes which outdates lines of business. Most frequently, however, businesses are forced into insolvency simply because they are out-competed. In an economy organised around market competition, and where competition presupposes losers or contemplates excess, insolvencies necessarily happen. The variety of causes for corporate failure means that the law requires different responses to the particular issues, and this is reflected in the legal meaning of insolvency.|$|E

500|$|Bloomberg View {{columnist}} William Pesek said: [...] "Japan's {{corporate culture}} of denial, of ignoring problems {{and letting them}} fester, keeps running up against a globalized world that values agility, innovation and transparency. Olympus demonstrates all too painfully how much Old Japan tolerates a lack of accountability among senior executives; inadequate disclosure; a disinclination to challenge authority and absolute deference to corporate boards regardless of share performance." [...] While he also observed that {{the independence of the}} directors was inadequate, he said Japanese executives were much more moderately paid compared to American ones. [...] "Shareholders assume directors are smart, devoted people working for the good of Japan Inc. Tough questions are rarely asked." [...] Errol Oh of The Star said a company apology for a fall in the share price [...] "trivialises the possible wrongdoings and misplaces emphasis on an effect rather than the cause ... Takayama's remark on the 'inconvenience' of a fall in share price reflects a common flaw in the mindset of <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>run</b> listed companies. Somehow, they {{lose sight of the fact}} that they manage businesses, not share prices." ...|$|E
500|$|While telling Bart and Lisa about 1990, Homer says, [...] "Tracey Ullman was {{entertaining}} America with [...] crudely drawn filler material." [...] This is {{a reference}} to The Simpsonss debut as [...] "bumpers" [...] airing before and after commercials on The Tracey Ullman Show. The song [...] "Those Were the Days" [...] parodies the opening credits of the television show All in the Family. One of <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>run</b> over the saxophone is {{a man on a}} tricycle, who promptly falls over. This is {{a reference to}} the show Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In. At the beginning of the flashback, the song [...] "Don't Worry, Be Happy" [...] by Bobby McFerrin can be heard. In the flashback, Dr. Hibbert fashioned his hair and attire like Mr. T in The A-Team. Homer can be seen watching Twin Peaks and The Giant is then shown waltzing with the White Horse. In King Toot's music store, when Homer buys Lisa her first saxophone, there is a guitar in the background that is similar to Eddie Van Halen's [...] "Frankenstrat" [...] guitar. The photo beside Kent Brockman on the news has him modeled after the Coppertone Girl.|$|E

2500|$|The SWP {{described}} the Iraqi insurgency as a [...] "resistance" [...] movement against military occupation and endorsed George Galloway's support of Hezbollah, who they described as [...] "the resistance". In addition, the Muslim Association of Britain {{was accused of}} being a conservative Islamist body sharing only anti-western sentiments with groups like the SWP and Respect. Former Socialist Alliance and Stop the War activist and press officer Anna Chen saw Lindsey German's comment [...] "I'm in favour of defending gay rights, but I am not prepared to have it as a shibboleth, [...] people who ... won't defend George Galloway", as the party's equivalent of Labour's revision of Clause IV. According to John Rentoul, the SWP and its allies, were not against the war at all, but in favour of Saddam Hussein winning.

[...] Opined Mike Lupica, [...] "It was just the most famous disagreement we are ever likely to see in baseball, the most famous manager telling <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>run</b> the most famous team to take their job and shove it. [...] A manager finally fired the Yankees."

It is of no use pretending to them that you are on the Press, because they don't want the Press; they don't think anything of the Press.
