Chris Slade plays a steady drum beat throughout. On live performances, the song was introduced with a drum solo from Slade, leading into Franklin's opening bass line.

50|$|On May 22, 1968, a new {{construction}} permit was issued to Community <b>Telecasters</b> of Cleveland Inc. {{for a new}} station with the call letters WCTF-TV. The limited programming available and {{the rising cost of}} building WCTF kept delaying plans and the sign on date for the station. In August 1972, an agreement was made to sell the construction permit to Joseph T. Zingale. Zingale backed out of the agreement in February 1974 due to a price dispute. On January 1975, United Artists Broadcasting tried to buy the permit and move WUAB to channel 19, but Zingale filed a protest claiming that Community <b>Telecasters</b> still held the construction permit. In May 1976, The FCC took the WCTF-TV permit away from Community <b>Telecasters</b> during a review board. Zingale then tried to acquire the license for WCTF, but the dispute eventually caused the construction permit to be deleted by the FCC.|$|R
