50|$|Long-terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons {{are part}} of another {{mechanism}} through which exon shuffling takes place. They usually encode two open reading frames (ORF). The first ORF named gag is related to viral structural proteins. The second ORF named pol is a polyprotein composed of an aspartic protease (AP)which cleaves the polyprotein, an Rnase H (RH) which splits the DNR-RNA hybrid, a reverse transcriptase (RT) which produces a cDNA copy of the transposons RNA and a DDE integrase which inserts cDNA into the host's genome. Additionally LTR retrotransponsons are classified into five subfamilies: Ty1/copia, Ty3/gypsy, Bel/Pao, retroviruses and endogenous retroviruses. The LTR retrotransponsons require an RNA intermediate in their <b>transposition</b> <b>cycle</b> mechanism. Retrotransponsons synthesize a cDNA copy based on the RNA strand using a reverse transcriptase related to retroviral RT. The cDNA copy is then inserted into new genomic positions to form a retrogene. This mechanism has been proven {{to be important in}} gene evolution of rice and other grass species through exon shuffling.|$|E

A block {{is defined as a}} substring of the given permutation, which is also a substring of the identity permutation. Block Sorting has been proved to be NP-Hard.

In this work we present a different characterization of Block Sorting in terms of a <b>transposition</b> <b>cycle</b> graph. Then we suggest a heuristic, which we show to exhibit a 2 -approximation performance guarantee for most permutations...|$|E
40|$|Background: Mariner {{elements}} {{represent the}} most successful family of autonomous DNA transposons, being present in various plant and animal genomes, including humans. The introduction and co-evolution of mariners within host genomes imply a strict regulation of the transposon activity. Biochemical data accumulated {{during the past decade}} have led to a convergent picture of the <b>transposition</b> <b>cycle</b> of mariner elements, suggesting that mariner transposition does not rely on host-specific factors. This model does not account for differences of transposition efficiency in human cells between mariners. We thus wondered whether apparent similarities in <b>transposition</b> <b>cycle</b> could hide differences in the intrinsic parameters that control mariner transposition. Principal Findings: We find that Mos 1 transposase concentrations in excess to the Mos 1 ends prevent the paired-end complex assembly. However, we observe that Mos 1 transposition is not impaired by transposase high concentration, dismissing the idea that transposase over production plays an obligatory role in the down-regulation of mariner transposition. Our main finding is that the paired-end complex is formed in a cooperative way, regardless of the transposase concentration. We also show that an element framed by two identical ITRs (Inverted Terminal Repeats) is more efficient in driving transposition than an element framed by two different ITRs (i. e. the natural Mos 1 copy), the latter being more sensitive to transposase concentration variations. Finally, we show that the current Mos 1 ITRs correspond to the ancestra...|$|E

We used a combination of physicochemical approaches to describe the association of MOS 1 (an eukaryotic transposase) with its specific target DNA, an event corresponding to the first steps of the <b>transposition</b> <b>cycle.</b> Because the kinetic constants of the reaction are still unknown, we aimed to determine them by using quartz crystal microbalance on two sources of recombinant MOS 1 : one produced in insect cells and the other produced in bacteria. The prokaryotic-expressed MOS 1 showed no cooperativity and displayed a Kd of about 300 nM. In contrast, the eukaryotic-expressed MOS 1 generated a cooperative system, with a lower Kd (∼ 2 nm). The origins of these differences were investigated by IR spectroscopy and AFM imaging. Both support the conclusion that prokaryotic- and eukaryotic-expressed MOS 1 are not similarly folded, thereby resulting in differences in the early steps of transposition...|$|E
40|$|The Tn 10 transpososome is a DNA {{processing}} machine {{in which two}} transposon ends, a transposase dimer and the host protein integration host factor (IHF), are united in an asymmetrical complex.

Here, we demonstrate multiple pathways for Tn 10 transposition. We show that one series of events is favored over all others and involves cyclic changes in the affinity of IHF for its binding site. During transpososome assembly, IHF is bound with high affinity. However, the affinity for IHF drops dramatically after cleavage of the first transposon end, leading to IHF ejection and unfolding of the complex. The ejection of IHF promotes cleavage of the second end, which is followed by restoration of the high affinity state which in turn regulates target interactions...|$|E

The three investigated retransposons of Drosophila, having a different structure and consequence, induce the formation of the virus-simular particles, containing the TuI-element, not depending on the yeast promotor type, directing its expression, in the cells of the yeast. The heterologic induction of the particles formation is the results of the Drosophila transposons expression.

While transposon vectors mediate efficient transgene integration, expression {{may be limited}} by epigenetic silencing, and persistent transposase expression may mediate multiple <b>transposition</b> <b>cycles.</b> Here, we evaluated the delivery of the piggyBac transposase messenger RNA combined with genetically insulated transposons to isolate the transgene from neighboring regulatory elements and stabilize expression. A comparison of piggyBac transposase expression from messenger RNA and DNA vectors {{was carried out in}} terms of expression levels, transposition efficiency, transgene expression and genotoxic effects, in order to calibrate and secure the transposition-based delivery system. Messenger RNA reduced the persistence of the transposase to a narrow window, thus decreasing side effects such as superfluous genomic DNA cleavage. Both the CTF/NF 1 and the D 4 Z 4 insulators were found to mediate more efficient expression from a few transposition events. We conclude that the use of engineered piggyBac transposase mRNA and insulated transposons offer promising ways of improving the quality of the integration process and sustaining the expression of transposon vectors...|$|R

40|$|When {{supplied}} {{with high levels}} of the IS 911 -encoded transposase, IS 911 -based transposons can excise as circles in which the right and left terminal inverted repeats are abutted. Formation of the circle junction is shown here to create a promoter, p(junc), which is significantly stronger than the indigenous promoter, pIRL, and is also capable of driving expression of the IS 911 transposition proteins. High transposase expression from the circular transposon may promote use of the circle as an integration substrate. The results demonstrate that IS 911 circles are highly efficient substrates for insertion into a target molecule in vivo. Insertion leads to the disassembly of p(junc) and thus to a lower level of synthesis of the transposition proteins. The observation that normal levels of IS 911 transposition proteins supplied by wild-type copies of IS 911 are also capable of generating transposon circles, albeit at a low level, reinforces the idea that the transposon circles might form part of the natural <b>transposition</b> <b>cycle</b> of IS 911.

40|$|Transposable {{elements}} comprise {{more than}} 45 % {{of the human}} genome and long interspersed nuclear element 1 (LINE- 1 or L 1) is the only autonomous mobile element remaining acti ve. Since its identification, it has been proposed that L 1 contributes to the mobilizati on and amplification of other cellular RNAs and more recently, experimental demonstra- tions of this function has been described for many transcripts such as Alu, a nonautonomous mobile element, cellular mRNAs, or small noncoding RNAs. Detailed examination of th e mobilization of various cellular RNAs revealed distinct pathways by which they could be recruited during retrotransp osition; template choice or template switching. Here, by analyzing genomic structures and retro transposition signatures associated wi th small nuclear RNA (snRNA) sequences, we identified distinct recruiting steps during the L 1 retro <b>transposition</b> <b>cycle</b> for the formation of snRNA-processed pseudogenes. Interestingly, some of the identified recruiting steps take place in the nucleus. Moreover, after comparison to other vertebrate genomes, we established that snRNA a mplification by template switching is common to many LINE families from several LINE clades. Finally, we suggest that U 6 snRNA copies can serve as markers of L 1 retrotransposition dynamics in mammalian genomes. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E
40|$|We {{show that}} both {{flanking}} IS 256 elements carried by transposon Tn 4001 {{are capable of}} generating head-to-tail tandem copies and free circular forms, implying that both are active. Our {{results suggest that the}} tandem structures arise from dimeric copies of the donor or vector plasmid present in the population by a mechanism in which an IS 256 belonging to one Tn 4001 copy attacks an IS 256 end carried by the second Tn 4001 copy. The resulting structures carry abutted left (inverted left repeat [IRL]) and right (inverted right repeat [IRR]) IS 256 ends. Examination of the junction sequence suggested that it may form a relatively good promoter capable of driving transposase synthesis in Escherichia coli. This behavior resembles that of an increasing number of bacterial insertion sequences which generate integrative junctions as part of the <b>transposition</b> <b>cycle.</b> Sequence analysis of the IRL-IRR junctions demonstrated that attack of one end by the other is largely oriented (IRL attacks IRR). Our experiments also defined the functional tips of IS 256 as the tips predicted from sequence alignments, confirming that the terminal 4 bp at each end are indeed different. The appearance of these multiple plasmid and transposon forms indicates that care should be exercised when Tn 4001 is used in transposition mutagenesis.

The Tnt 1 family of retrotransposons has served as a model to evaluate the diversity among closely related elements within Solanaceae species and found that members of the family vary mainly in their U 3 region of the long terminal repeats (LTRs). Recovery of a full length genomic copy of Retrosol was performed through a PCR-based approach from wild potato, Solanum oplocense. Further characterization focusing on both LTR sequences of the amplified copy allowed estimating an approximate insertion time at 2 million years ago thus supporting the occurrence of <b>transposition</b> <b>cycles</b> after genus divergence. Copy number of Tnt 1 -like elements in Solanum species were determined through genomic quantitative PCR whereby results sustain that Retrosol in Solanum species is a low copy number retrotransposon (1 - 4 copies) while Retrolyc 1 has an intermediate copy number (38 copies) in S. peruvianum. Comparative analysis of retrotransposon content revealed no correlation between genome size or ploidy level and Retrosol copy number. The tetraploid cultivated potato with a cellular genome size of 1, 715 Mbp harbours similar copy number per monoploid genome than other diploid Solanum species (613 - 884 Mbp). Conversely, S. peruvianum genome (1, 125 Mbp) has a higher copy number.

40|$|Cut-and-paste (simple insertion) and replicative {{transposition}} pathways {{are the two}} classical paradigms by which transposable elements are mobilized. A novel variation of cut and paste, a two-step <b>transposition</b> <b>cycle,</b> has recently been proposed for insertion sequences of the IS 3 family. In IS 2 this variation involves {{the formation of a}} circular, putative transposition intermediate (the minicircle) in the first step. Two aspects of the minicircle may involve its proposed role in the second step (integration into the target). The first is the presence of a highly reactive junction formed by the two abutted ends of the element. The second is the assembly at the minicircle junction of a strong hybrid promoter which generates higher levels of transposase. In this report we show that IS 2 possesses a highly reactive minicircle junction at which a strong promoter is assembled and that the promoter is needed for the efficient completion of the pathway. We show that the sequence diversions which characterize the imperfect inverted repeats or ends of this element have evolved specifically to permit the formation and optimal function of this promoter. While these sequence diversions eliminate catalytic activity of the left end (IRL) in the linear element, sufficient sequence information essential for catalysis is retained by the IRL {{in the context of the}} minicircle junction.

Traditional approaches to in-place matrix <b>transposition</b> involve <b>cycle</b> following, which {{is difficult to}} parallelize, and on matrices of dimension m by n require O(mn logmn) work when limited to less than O(mn) auxiliary space. Our decomposition allows the rows and columns to be operated on independently during in-place transposition, reducing work complexity to O(mn), given O(max(m,n)) auxiliary space. This decomposition leads to an efficient and naturally parallel algorithm: we have measured median throughput of 19. 5 GB/s on an NVIDIA Tesla K 20 c processor. An implementation specialized for the skinny matrices that arise when converting Arrays of Struc-tures to Structures of Arrays yields median throughput of 34. 3 GB/s, and a maximum throughput of 51 GB/s.
