40|$|A {{traditional}} view of {{tax that}} viewed consumption taxes {{as a way}} to avoid <b>taxing</b> <b>savings</b> is flawed. A progressive spending tax stands between an income tax, which double-taxes all savings, and a wage tax, which ignores all savings. A progressive spending tax implements simultaneously two widely held norms about savings: the ordinary-savings norms, which holds that savings for emergencies or to smooth out uneven labour earnings through even consumption paths is commendable and ought not be ‘double-taxed’, and the yield-to-capital norm, which holds that savings that enable higher material lifestyles ought to bear some tax.

40|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 1990 s, there was a wave of interest in the connections between taxation and saving, culminating in a series of reports and reviews in 1994. So, for example, UK tax policy towards saving and investment has been reviewed {{in the context of the}} Industrial Finance Initiative; Finance Ministers had an extensive discussion at the IMF meeting in Madrid; under the German presidency of the EU, work has continued on a possible common basis for <b>taxing</b> <b>savings,</b> as initiated by Belgium last year; the IFS Capital Taxes Group concluded its deliberations with Proposals for the Taxation of Savings and Profits; and in the August issue of Fiscal Studies, Boadway and Wildasin surveyed much of the literature from the 1980 s. Then in November the OECD published an extensive survey on Taxation and Household Saving in each of its 24 Member countries in 1993, together with an analysis of what lessons might be learned for good design of tax policy from the literature and country experiences. This article summarises the report and considers what might be deduced from its conclusions. ...|$|E
40|$|With {{heterogeneity}} in both {{skills and}} preferences for the future, the Atkinson-Stiglitz result that savings {{should not be}} taxed with optimal taxation of earnings does not hold. Empirical evidence shows that on average people with higher skills save at higher rates. Saez (2002) suggests that with such positive correlation <b>taxing</b> <b>savings</b> can increase welfare. This paper analyzes this issue in a model with less than perfect correlation between ability and preference for the future. To have multiple types at the same earnings level, the number of types {{of jobs in the}} economy is restricted. Key to the analysis is that types who value future consumption less are more tempted to switch to a lower earning job. We show that introducing both a small savings tax on the high earners and a small savings subsidy on the low earners increase welfare, regardless of the correlation between ability and preference for the future. However, a uniform savings tax, as in the Nordic dual income tax, increases welfare only if that correlation is sufficiently high. There are also some results on optimal taxes that parallel the results on introducing small taxes. Originally published July 14, 2009. Revised January 27, 2010...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} contains three chapters {{and focuses}} on the optimal design of fiscal policy, both from a theoretical and from a quantitative perspective. In the first chapter, I address the optimal taxation of wealth {{in a class of}} dynastic overlapping-generations economies with heterogeneous mortality risk. Working individuals are indexed by skills which are private information. Skills not only determine earning abilities but also correlate with survival probability, so that more productive agents on average live longer. The analysis distinguishes between the tax treatment of two possible sources of wealth, namely, savings and bequests, and points to the mortality gradient as a crucial determinant for optimal wealth taxation. Specifically, due to differences in longevity: (i) savings should be marginally taxed, and (ii) bequests should be marginally subsidized at a rate that decreases with the age of the donor. I calibrate the model to U. S. data and quantitatively evaluate its tax implications. For the median worker, mortality differences create a force for marginally <b>taxing</b> <b>savings</b> by up to 1. 7 %, and for marginally subsidizing bequests by as much as 3. 4 %. These figures are robust to the value of the societal intergenerational discount factor and generate significant welfare gains...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} persistence and value relevance of earnings attributable to <b>tax</b> <b>savings</b> {{and the extent}} to which this persistence and value relevance differs from those of nontax earnings. After controlling for factors previously shown to be systematically associated with the tax component of earnings, results show that <b>tax</b> <b>savings</b> are significant and statistically persistent but statistically less persistent than earnings from nontax sources. Results also reveal that the persistence of <b>tax</b> <b>savings</b> changes across <b>tax</b> regimes whereas earnings from nontax sources remain relatively unchanged. Contextual analysis shows that (1) the persistence of <b>tax</b> <b>savings</b> is largely driven by firms in the pharmaceutical, oil and gas, financial services, insurance and real estate industries, (2) the persistence of <b>tax</b> <b>savings</b> is increasing in the R&D tax credit and (3) this persistence is increasing in settings where the ratio of foreign over domestic earnings is increasing. Additionally, the persistence and value relevance of <b>tax</b> <b>savings</b> is increasing for positive <b>tax</b> <b>savings,</b> implying a market reward (penalty) for lower (higher) <b>tax</b> <b>savings</b> (reported effective <b>tax</b> rates). When I compare the results from my valuation tests with those from my persistence tests, I find that <b>tax</b> <b>savings</b> are sometimes not persistent but value relevant and sometimes persistent but not value relevant whereas the persistence and value relevance of nontax earnings are always consistent. These findings are consistent with managerial opportunistic behavior, a market that suspects managerial opportunistic behavior or a stock market that does not understand fully the persistence of <b>tax</b> <b>savings</b> relative to nontax savings. Results from the Mishkin (1983) test show that the market appears to significantly overestimate both the persistence of <b>tax</b> <b>savings</b> and nontax earnings, implying that securities are mispriced. This potential mispricing appears to be more severe for <b>tax</b> <b>savings,</b> implying that, on average, the market does not appear to understand fully the persistence and value relevance of the tax component of earnings. Finally, this study reconciles some of the mixed results of prior research and carries significant implications for policy makers, firm management, market participants and accounting researchers...|$|R

30|$|We {{propose that}} {{countries}} {{take a more}} flexible approach {{to the design of}} unemployment benefits. The goal should be to find a better balance between efficiency and workers protection. This is likely to be achieved by a ’hybrid’ between UI and UISAs. The starting point would be to define the mandate of the program, that is the level of benefits (replacement rate and minimum benefit) to be offered at different levels of income and their duration (something that is not usually done in the case of UISAs where the benefit can be a lump sum and if it is a monthly payment the duration is constrained by the amount of savings in the account). The question is then how to finance the deficits that accumulate in some of the accounts. We have shown that there are four alternatives: (i) a pay-roll tax paid by employers; (ii) a tax on wages paid by workers; (iii) a tax on accounts with positive balances; and (iv) general revenues. We have argued that pay-roll taxes and taxes on wages can reduce formal employment (the latter can also be regressive relative to a tax on savings). Relying only on general revenues, on the other hand, can be considerably costly, while <b>taxing</b> <b>savings</b> at a 100 percent rate can reduce incentives to search and take jobs. The best option therefore seems to be to rely on a combination of a tax on savings (below 100 percent) and general revenues (e.g., revenues from a consumption tax, or a tax on wealth).|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} contains three chapters {{and focuses}} on the optimal design of fiscal policy, both from a theoretical and from a quantitative perspective. In the first chapter, “Wealth Taxation and Life Expectancy,” I address the optimal taxation of wealth {{in a class of}} dynastic overlapping-generations economies with heterogeneous mortality risk. Working individuals are indexed by skills which are private information. Skills not only determine earning abilities but also correlate with survival probability, so that more productive agents on average live longer. The analysis distinguishes between the tax treatment of two possible sources of wealth, namely, savings and bequests, and points to the mortality gradient as a crucial determinant for optimal wealth taxation. Specifically, due to differential mortality: (a) earned wealth should be marginally taxed, (b) transferred wealth via bequests should be marginally subsidized, and (c) marginal tax schedules on bequests and inter-vivos transfers should be separated. I calibrate the model to U. S. data and quantitatively evaluate its tax implications. For the median worker, mortality differences create a force for marginally taxing capital mortality differences create a force for marginally <b>taxing</b> <b>savings</b> by up to 1. 7 %, and for marginally subsidizing bequests by as much as 3. 4 %. These figures are robust to the value of the societal intergenerational discount factor and can yield significant welfare gains. In the second chapter, “Taxing Atlas: Using Firm Data to Derive Optimal Income Tax Rates” (joint with Laurence Ales and Jessie J. Wang), we analyze the optimal taxation of top labor incomes. Top income earners are modeled as managers who are heterogeneous across skills and operate a span-of-control technology, as in Rosen (1982). Managers privately observe their skill level, which increases the productivity of both effort and supervision, thus creating a scale-of-operations effect. We characterize optimal taxes in this environment and identify novel determinants linked to firm technology. Our main result is that to be consistent with U. S. firm data, the optimal top income tax rate should be roughly in line with the U. S. tax code, in contrast to previous results in the literature. In the third chapter, “Regional State Capacity and the Optimal Degree of Fiscal Decentralization” (joint with Martín Besfamille), we study the optimal degree of fiscal decentralization in a federation. In our environment, regional governments are characterized by two dimensions of state capacity; namely, administrative and fiscal. These gauge the ability to deliver public goods and to raise tax revenues, respectively. Two regimes are compared: partial and full decentralization. Under partial decentralization, regional governments have no tax powers and rely on central bailouts to refinance incomplete projects. Under full decentralization, regional governments refinance incomplete projects through capital taxes, in a context of tax competition. We show how the optimal degree of fiscal decentralization hinges on the relative magnitudes of each type of capacity. Specifically, for sufficiently low levels of fiscal capacity, bailing out regional governments is optimal regardless of the level of administrative ability. However, a combination of low levels of administrative capacity and high levels of fiscal capacity calls for fully decentralizing tax powers...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} three essays. The first two essays study the association between tax aggressiveness and financial reporting aggressiveness. There is an emerging debate about whether firms tradeoff between <b>tax</b> <b>savings</b> and reported earnings. Essay 1 examines this relationship in the Canadian context and finds that tax aggressiveness is negatively associated with financial reporting aggressiveness, suggesting {{the existence of a}} tradeoff. However, closely-held firms seem to be making no tradeoffs between <b>tax</b> <b>savings</b> and book income. This essay also finds that closely-held firms are more aggressive in pursuing <b>tax</b> <b>savings</b> compared to other firms. Essay 2 examines the tradeoff question in the North American context. I find that tax reporting aggressiveness is positively associated with financial reporting aggressiveness for U. S. firms (i. e., U. S. firms in general do not seem to tradeoff between the <b>tax</b> <b>savings</b> and book income), while negatively associated for Canadian firms (i. e., Canadian firms do seem to tradeoff between pursuit of <b>tax</b> <b>savings</b> and book income). Within the U. S. sub-sample, there is no difference in tradeoff behavior between closely-held and widely-held firms. Closely-held firms in Canada do not seem to tradeoff between book income and <b>tax</b> <b>savings,</b> thereby pursuing both tax aggressiveness and financial reporting aggressiveness simultaneously. Essay 3 focuses on financial reporting and examines the association between IFRS adoption and executive compensation. More specifically, I examine whether IFRS better reflects firms' and managers' performance. I find that accounting-based pay for performance sensitivity is stronger in the year of IFRS adoption. My results show that CFOs earned approximately $ 108, 000 more in the year of IFRS adoption.
