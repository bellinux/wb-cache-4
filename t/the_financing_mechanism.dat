In the {{comparative}} study the authors analyze {{the relationship between}} the amount of public funds used for <b>financing</b> higher education, <b>the</b> <b>financing</b> <b>mechanisms</b> and <b>the</b> performance obtained by these, within the European Union member states. The performance criteria used for the optimization of the equilibrium between financial resources and the results of public higher education are also established. For this purpose, a series of performance indicators are analyzed in some of the European Union member states.

30|$|Issues in <b>the</b> <b>financing</b> <b>mechanism</b> {{appear to}} have arisen in another {{innovative}} initiative of this type. German private hospital group Asklepios recently worked with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to create a nurse migration partnership with Tunisia called the TaPIG Project. Groups of Tunisian students arrived in Hamburg in late 2012 and early 2013 for six months of German language and culture training (paid by the Foreign Affairs Ministry) {{to be followed by}} three years of apprenticeship training in nursing, paid by Asklepios. <b>The</b> <b>financing</b> <b>mechanism</b> involved an additional component of a student loan to cover other expenses of the students, such as room and board during the language and culture training.

40|$|Urban goods {{movement}} and urban logistics {{started to be}} defined as a scientific discipline 20 years ago, where several actions in research, development, policy and deployment were started to be coordinated. However, most of the innovations and projects presented in that field are stopped or reduced because of a common constraint that becomes its worst enemy: <b>the</b> <b>financing</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> Although many studies deal with urban logistics, only a few of them show <b>the</b> difficulties at <b>financing,</b> but without entering in detail on <b>the</b> <b>financing</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> This chapter aims to present <b>the</b> main <b>financing</b> issues in urban logistics. First, the main categories of funding strategies that can be applied to urban logistics are presented, focusing on public-private interactions and collaborations.

40|$|In the 201 1 Budget Speech, <b>the</b> Minister of <b>Finance</b> {{announced}} that South Africa would be introducing National Health Insurance. The Minister described <b>the</b> <b>financing</b> <b>mechanisms</b> under consideration for funding National Health Insurance. The Minister {{also referred to}} eight countries, namely Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Thailand and Vietnam as examples of countries which had successfully implemented universal health coverage. These countries were selected {{for the purpose of}} the present research. The goal of this study was to analyse <b>the</b> health care <b>financing</b> <b>mechanisms</b> under consideration in South Africa to determine if they were in line with international trends and "best practice" in relation to South Africa's economic profile. To determine whether the economic situation in South Africa is comparable to the eight countries selected for the research, a high-level comparison was made of the economic profile of South Africa and the eight countries, based on certain demographic, macro-economic, health expenditure and health status indicators. <b>The</b> health care <b>financing</b> <b>mechanisms</b> used in <b>the</b> eight countries was also analysed. International trends suggested that health care should be financed primarily through pre-payment systems, that <b>financing</b> <b>mechanisms</b> should preferably be progressive in nature and that a large share of funding should be from government sources (albeit shared between general tax revenue and specific health care contributions). <b>The</b> <b>financing</b> <b>mechanisms</b> under consideration in South Africa reflect these norms. The health systems in the eight countries analysed all exhibited elements of "good performance" and also complied, to a large extent, with international trends, but the frnancing models used for funding health care in the eight countries were country-specific and could therefore not be compared directly or used to recommend a system for South Africa. Areas not addressed by this thesis include the implications of a centralised healthcare system, the implications of a single-payer system, the benefit package to be offered and its cost implications, the role of private healthcare providers and how the significant human resource scarcity and infrastructure backlogs will be addressed. ...|$|R

40|$|ABSRTACTFinancing {{technological}} complexes: {{a comparative}} study of Brazilian, Portuguese and Spanish casesThe intensely competitive and globalized market to which firms and countries now belong dictates an ongoing search for innovation. Among innovation stimulating environments, {{of which there are}} several initiatives in many countries, including Brazil, we find the so-called technology complexes. One of the biggest challenges for the implementation and operation of such complexes is to obtain funding. This leads to a question: what are <b>the</b> <b>financing</b> <b>mechanisms</b> available to <b>the</b> organizations that manage technology complexes for the planning, implementation and startup of such undertakings? To answer this question, this research study aimed at identifying <b>the</b> <b>financing</b> <b>mechanisms</b> employed in <b>the</b> aforementioned stages of the development of the following enterprises of this sort: in Brazil, Tecnopuc, Polo de Informática de São Leopoldo and Sapiens Parque; in Portugal, Biocant Park and Taguspark; and in Spain, Parque Tecnológico de Cartuja 93, Parque Tecnológico de Andalucia, Parque Científico de Barcelona, Parque Tecnológico de Bizkaia and Parque Tecnológico de Álava. What was observed in all cases was that in spite of the different management organizations, players and structures, the funding of the implementation phases was not only based on public and private sector resources, but also on partnerships. Moreover, the authors found that the funding model differences are mainly due to five factors: the participants in the managing organization; legal model of the managing organization; components belonging to the managing organization; attractiveness of the technology infrastructure and business anchors; and availability of public funds for the promotion of technological and economic development...|$|R

In the past, in Europe, <b>the</b> <b>financing</b> <b>mechanisms</b> had been involving negotiations between the public or private superior education institutions on the allocated funds, their calculation on the real costs supported by institutions and grants awarded, divided on budgetary categories. Nowadays, the public superior educational system <b>financing</b> <b>mechanisms</b> had suffered important kind of changes, if we consider the granted sums calculation formulas, {{as well as the}} measures for correlation of public <b>financing</b> quantum with <b>the</b> <b>financed</b> university performance. Each financing model presents strong points as well as weak ones, as there isn’t any perfect financing model which can be adapted to any country, because the choosing of the model usually implies a compromise between the different objectives that have to be reached by the higher education. Owed to public superior educational system financing system analysis from a few European countries (Romania, Great Britain, France, Denmark,), we may conclude that a perfect adaptable financing system for each European country doesn’t exist; the adaptability degree of these mechanisms depends on a different factors number, of a historic, social, legal, political and economical nature.

30|$|The {{all-around}} {{benefits in}} Table 1 are possible {{simply because the}} labor of a nurse is worth enormously more money in Germany than in Tunisia, {{and the cost of}} training a nurse is enormously lower in Tunisia than in Germany.

And two-track training requires little or no up-front cost to students and is thus accessible to students of any income level. Training for migrants costs origin-country taxpayers nothing and subsidizes the creation of professionals in the home country through the ‘home’ track, reducing fears of ‘brain drain’. Graduates who do not migrate pay much lower tuition, heavily subsidized by a small portion of migrant graduates’ earnings.

With a total cost-plus financing mechanism there is no incentive in being efficient and the price charged {{for the use of the}} new infrastructure is zero, the market quantity excessive, and the level of supranational financing disproportionate. In contrast, with a sunk cost-plus financing mechanism social optimal pricing is always implemented, though there is no incentive in being efficient.
