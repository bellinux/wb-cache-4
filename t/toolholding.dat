25|$|Schunk {{is one of}} {{the largest}} {{manufacturers}} of <b>toolholding</b> and automation equipment in the world. The company has a worldwide workforce of 1,440. Of these, 770 are in Lauffen and the nearby village of Hausen.|$|E
50|$|Some {{machines}} use smaller toolholders MK2 (Morse taper #2 - {{on older}} machines), ISO-30, HSK-63 or the tools just get {{held in a}} collet tool holder affixed directly to the spindle nose. ISO-30 and HSK-63 are rapid-change <b>toolholding</b> systems. HSK-63 has begun to supplant the ISO-30 as the rapid change standard in recent years.|$|E
5000|$|Because of the {{limitations}} on tooling design imposed {{by the fact that}} the workpiece mostly surrounds the tool, boring is inherently somewhat more challenging than turning, in terms of decreased <b>toolholding</b> rigidity, increased clearance angle requirements (limiting the amount of support that can be given to the cutting edge), and difficulty of inspection of the resulting surface (size, form, surface roughness). These are the reasons why boring is viewed as an area of machining practice in its own right, separate from turning, with its own tips, tricks, challenges, and body of expertise, despite the fact that they are in some ways identical.|$|E
50|$|Bridgeport manual milling {{machines}} {{have come in}} many types and sizes over the years, including (but not limited to) the C head (original), R head (heavy duty C head), M head, J head (and high speed, 5440 RPM version), 2J1 1/2 head (1.5 HP Vari-Speed), 2J2 (2HP Vari-speed), and Series II head (4HP Vari-speed). All of the heads offer variable speeds, the earlier ones via a step pulley (cone pulley) and the later ones via electrically or electronically modulated variable-speed drive. Typical table sizes are 9″ × 49″ (Y and X, respectively) and 10″ × 54″. Machine tapers for <b>toolholding</b> include Morse tapers (on early models) and the R8 taper (a widely used standard that Bridgeport created) on most models. Both Morse and R8 allow for both collets and solid holders; and a drill chuck can be held by either of the latter. Machine slides are of the dovetail type, and rotary bearings are mostly of the roller and ball types.|$|E
50|$|EMIS Health {{are off the}} A658 {{in central}} Yeadon, and are a main {{supplier}} of GP computer systems. Craftsman Tools on the A659 in Otley make <b>toolholding</b> systems and fixtures. Sinclairs make the Silvine brand of stationery at Otley. Allied Glass based in south Leeds at the A61/A639 junction, and also has a main plant at Knottingley east of town on the A645, makes glass bottles for whisky. Toggi outdoor clothing (equestrian) is at Confederation Park at the M621 junction 2 with the A643, and with Champion who make riding hats and body protectors; 600 Group, based near junction 2 of the M621, are the world's biggest manufacturer of manual and CNC lathes; it makes Colchester-Harrison lathes, and Pratt Burnerd International lathe-chucks with a lathe factory at Heckmondwike. Oliver Douglas, on the Tong Road Ind Estate off the B6154 in Wortley, make industrial (catering) washing machines. Perry Uniform makes many school uniforms for many independent schools next to the railway off the B6154 in Upper Armley. Sulzer Pumps UK have a large manufacturing facility on the A6110 near the A643 roundabout. Pland Stainless make large sinks for laboratories and hospitals. Leeds is the second largest manufacturing city in the UK, after London.|$|E
