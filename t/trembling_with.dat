25|$|Yama {{is often}} {{depicted}} as bowing to Shiva with folded hands {{and holding a}} noose in between them. He is depicted <b>trembling</b> <b>with</b> fear, with legs wide apart suggesting that {{he is trying to}} steady himself after being kicked by Shiva. Another configuration portrays him lying fainted on the ground after being kicked by Shiva. Shiva may be depicted as standing or dancing on the fallen Yama. Yama is sometimes mistaken as an apasmara (a dwarf) in this configuration and the image as that of Shiva as Nataraja, the Lord of Dance who is depicted trampling the apasmara.|$|E

500|$|Sherwood's {{earliest}} {{works are}} the sentimental novels Traditions (1795) and Margarita (1795); although both are more worldly than her later works, neither received much recognition. [...] By contrast, The History of Susan Gray, {{which was written}} for the girls of her Sunday school class in Bridgnorth, made Sherwood a famous author. Like Hannah More's tracts, the novel is designed to teach middle-class morality to the poor. [...] This novel—which Patricia Demers, a children's literature scholar, describes as a [...] "purified Pamela"—tells the story of Susan, an orphaned servant girl, who [...] "resists the advances of a philandering soldier; though <b>trembling</b> <b>with</b> emotion at the man's declaration of love and promise of marriage." [...] The reader is regularly reminded of the [...] "wages of sin" [...] since Susan's story is told from her deathbed. [...] A separate narrator, seemingly Sherwood, often interrupts the tale to warn readers against particular actions, such as becoming a [...] "bad woman." [...] Despite a didactic tone that is often distasteful to modern readers, Susan Gray was so popular {{at the time of}} its release that it was pirated by multiple publishers. In 1816, Sherwood published a revised and [...] "improved" [...] version, which Sarah Trimmer positively reviewed in The Guardian of Education. Sherwood wrote a companion story, The History of Lucy Clare, which was published in 1810.|$|E

2500|$|Heracles {{had visited}} Chiron to gain {{advice on how}} to catch the boar, and Chiron had told him to drive it into thick snow, which sets this Labour in mid-winter. [...] Having {{successfully}} caught the Boar, Heracles bound it and carried it back to Eurystheus, who was frightened of it and ducked down in his half-buried storage pithos, begging Heracles {{to get rid of the}} beast, a favourite subject for the vase-painters. Heracles obliged. Roger Lancelyn Green states in his Tales of the Greek Heroes that Heracles threw it in the sea. It then swam to Italy, where its tusks were preserved in the Temple of Apollo at Cumae. Three days later, Eurystheus, still <b>trembling</b> <b>with</b> fear, sent Heracles to clean the Augean stables.|$|E

2500|$|There was [...] "nothing incomplete" [...] in {{the works}} of Metzinger. His works were the [...] "fruit of a {{rigorous}} logic" [...] writes the author. When explaining the art of our epoch, [...] "his work {{will be one of the}} surest documents". Metzinger's paintings contained their own 'explanation'. For Apollinaire this was a case [...] "unique in the history of art". For Apollinaire, Metzinger had purity; [...] "his meditations take beautiful forms whose harmony tends to approach the sublime... entirely stripped of all that was known before him. [...] Each one of his pictures contains a judgment of the universe and his entire work resembles a nocturnal firmament when it is clear, free from all clouds and <b>trembling</b> <b>with</b> adorable lights. There is nothing incomplete in his works, poetry ennobles the smallest details." ...|$|E

"After the {{two parts}} which I have already explained, at the left of Our Lady and a little above, we saw an Angel with a flaming sword in his left hand; flashing, it gave out flames that looked as though they would set the world on fire; but they died out {{in contact with the}} splendour that Our Lady {{radiated}} towards him from her right hand: pointing to the earth with his right hand, the Angel cried out in a loud voice: 'Penance, Penance, Penance!' And we saw in an immense light that is God: 'something similar to how people appear in a mirror when they pass in front of it' a Bishop dressed in White 'we had the impression that it was the Holy Father'. Other Bishops, Priests, Religious men and women going up a steep mountain, at the top of which there was a big Cross of rough-hewn trunks as of a cork-tree with the bark; before reaching there the Holy Father passed through a big city half in ruins and half <b>trembling</b> <b>with</b> halting step, afflicted with pain and sorrow, he prayed for the souls of the corpses he met on his way; having {{reached the top of the}} mountain, on his knees at the foot of the big Cross he was killed by a group of soldiers who fired bullets and arrows at him, and in the same way there died one after another the other Bishops, Priests, Religious men and women, and various lay people of different ranks and positions. Beneath the two arms of the Cross there were two Angels each with a crystal aspersorium in his hand, in which they gathered up the blood of the Martyrs and with it sprinkled the souls that were making their way to God." ...|$|E
