5|$|For {{his last}} two starts of the year, Fantastic Light was sent to East Asia. In November, in the Japan Cup he stayed on {{strongly}} in the closing stages to finish a close third, beaten a neck and a nose by T M Opera O and Meisho Doto. Dettori reportedly felt that the slow pace {{was the reason for}} his defeat. Despite three successive defeats, Fantastic Light still managed to end the season with a major victory. In December he was sent to Sha Tin for the Hong Kong Cup and justified favouritism by leading in <b>the</b> <b>straight</b> <b>and</b> staying on strongly to beat Greek Dance and Jim and Tonic. The win earned Fantastic Light top place in the Emirates World Series, a competition in which points were awarded for performances in a number of international races.|$|E
5|$|Nagatos {{presence}} at Yokosuka was {{revealed to the}} Allies by photographs taken during the 10July raid on the Tokyo area. On 16July Halsey and Vice Admiral Bernard Rawlings, the commander of TF37, met to plan raids on the Tokyo area. Halsey was determined to sink {{the remnants of the}} IJN, and placed a particularly strong emphasis on attacking Nagato as she had been Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto's flagship during the attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941. Due to the battleship's position within a well defended harbor, the Third Fleet's planners assessed that aircraft which attempted <b>the</b> <b>straight</b> <b>and</b> level flight needed to launch torpedoes against her would suffer heavy losses, and so decided to use dive bombing tactics instead. As the landward side of the naval base was mountainous, the approaches which could be used by dive bombers were limited.|$|E
5|$|Massa made a {{pit stop}} on lap53, and rejoined behind Heidfeld in tenth. He {{subsequently}} set the fastest lap {{of the race}} on lap55, a 1:18.426. Meanwhile, Piquet was able {{to close the gap}} on Räikkönen to under a second, before losing time by running wide at turn five on lap60. Massa passed Heidfeld for ninth on the same lap, and began closing in on Webber. On lap65, Massa drafted down <b>the</b> <b>straight</b> <b>and</b> attempted to pass Webber, who defended his position by driving to the right. Crossing the track boundary into the end of the pit-lane, Massa managed to pass Webber, and out-braked him into turn one, to take eighth place. Alonso crossed the finish line on lap67 to take his second win of the season, five seconds ahead of Kubica. Räikkönen was third, ahead of Piquet, Trulli, Bourdais, Vettel and Massa. Webber took ninth on the line, ahead of Heidfeld, who struggled with a heavy car and failed to improve on a poor qualifying performance. Rosberg finished in front of Hamilton, in 11th. Barrichello and Button took the next two positions; both drivers blamed their Honda cars for their uncompetitive performance at the Fuji circuit. Nakajima finished last, in 15th, unable to recover after his forced pit-stop early in the race.|$|E

25|$|Another {{problem is}} the {{effectiveness}} of shear reinforcement. FRP rebar stirrups formed by bending before hardening generally perform relatively poorly in comparison to steel stirrups or to structures with straight fibres. When strained, the zone between <b>the</b> <b>straight</b> <b>and</b> curved regions are subject to strong bending, shear, and longitudinal stresses. Special design techniques are necessary {{to deal with such}} problems.|$|E
25|$|At Doncaster in September, Macaroni {{bypassed}} the St Leger and ran instead in the two-and-a-half mile Doncaster Cup.

25|$|On 29 July, Isonomy {{ran in the}} Goodwood Cup, {{in which}} he was asked to concede {{thirteen}} pounds to Parole. An outsider named The Bear set off in front and at one stage opened up a lead of two hundred yards. Isonomy finally caught up with the front-runner in <b>the</b> <b>straight</b> <b>and</b> pulled away in the closing stages to win easily by three lengths, with Parole third A few days later on 6 August he was sent to Brighton Racecourse for the two-mile Brighton Cup, in which he carried 136 pounds and started at odds of 1/10 against three opponents. After settling in third place he moved into the lead in <b>the</b> <b>straight</b> <b>and</b> went three lengths clear, before being eased down in the closing stages to record a three-quarter-length win over Paul's Cray. Isonomy was then sent north for the Ebor Handicap at York on 27 August, for which he was made 8/11 favourite. Despite the very difficult conditions ("mud and water flying in all directions"), and conceding at least thirty pounds to his opponents, he won impressively by eight lengths.|$|E
25|$|At Royal Ascot in June, Robert the Devil ran twice. On 15 June he {{ran in the}} Gold Cup {{over two}} and a half miles, in which his opponents {{included}} the 1880 2000 Guineas winner Petronel and the American-bred three-year-old Foxhall who had recently won the Grand Prix de Paris. Robert the Devil took the lead entering <b>the</b> <b>straight</b> <b>and</b> drew clear to win very easily by five lengths from Petronel. Two days later at the same meeting he won the Alexandra Plate over three miles.|$|E
25|$|Obviously {{it was one}} {{of those}} things that {{reinforce}} that I can't have alcohol. I got away from the one thing that kept me on <b>the</b> <b>straight</b> <b>and</b> narrow and that was my relationship with the Lord. That should always come first. Hopefully some good will come out of this. It just crossed my mind that night, 'Can I have a drink?' Obviously I can't and this reinforces that. Since that night, I have not had another thought like that. I know it's something I shouldn't do because it leads to other things.|$|E

25|$|In the 1990s, as the {{availability}} of the internet increased, many queercore zines, such as Noise Queen could be found online as well as in print. The queercore zine label Xerox Revolutionaries run by Hank Revolt, was available online and distributed zines from 2000 to 2005. Queercore forums and chatrooms, such as QueerPunks started up. The Queer Zine Archive Project is an internet database of scanned queer zines that continues to grow. All these developments allowed queercore to become a self-sustaining and self-determined subculture, expressing itself through a variety of mediums independent of <b>the</b> <b>straight</b> <b>and</b> gay establishment.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, Heart's Cry was campaigned internationally. In March he {{was sent}} to Dubai to contest the Dubai Sheema Classic at Nad Al Sheba. Ridden by Lemaire he contested the lead from the start, tactics which {{surprised}} his trainer Kojiro Hashiguchi. He went clear of the field in <b>the</b> <b>straight</b> <b>and</b> won by four and a quarter lengths from Collier Hill with the multiple Group One winners Ouija Board and Alexander Goldrun in fourth and fifth. In the August 2006 edition of the World Thoroughbred Racehorse Rankings, Heart's Cry was ranked the equal second best horse in the world, a pound behind Makybe Diva and equal with Electrocutionist and David Junior.|$|E
25|$|His main {{contribution}} to violin-making was {{his work on}} varnish. The purfling's joints are often cut on <b>the</b> <b>straight</b> <b>and</b> not on the bias as was traditional, in the middle in the pin. His brand is burnt at a length of 1cm. There is generally a black dot on the joint of the top under the bridge. He used an external mould. The stop is generally 193mm long. In this respect he follows to the French 18th-century tradition of a short stop (190mm), which was traditionally 195mm long in Italy and even 200mm long in Germany. The violin's serial number is inscribed in the middle inside the instrument. Its date (only the last two figures) in the upper paraph on the back. His violins of the first period have large edges and his brand was then burnt inside the middle bouts. The varnish varied from orange-red to red. After 1860, his varnish became lighter.|$|E

25|$|In June Camarine raced {{away from}} Newmarket {{for the first}} time when she ran in the Ascot Gold Cup over two and a half miles in front of a large and {{enthusiastic}} crowd which included the King. She was ridden by James Robinson and was opposed by the six-year-old Rowton, the winner of the 1829 St Leger and The Saddler, winner of the 1831 Doncaster Cup. Rowton, ridden by Sam Chifney, made the running from The Saddler, with Camarine held up in third before Robinson moved her up to challenge for the lead in the straight. After a particularly severe contest, Camarine and Rowton crossed the line together, with the judge calling a dead heat. The older horse hung away from the rails and appeared to have hampered the filly in the closing stages; it was only with some difficulty that Wood was persuaded not to lodge a formal objection. A run-off over the same course was arranged to decide the race, and Robinson again restrained the filly in the early stages before overtaking Rowton in <b>the</b> <b>straight</b> <b>and</b> winning by two lengths.|$|E
25|$|Heart's Cry {{returned}} in October to finish {{sixth in the}} Autumn Tenno Sho, {{in which he was}} ridden for the first time by Christophe Lemaire, before running in the Japan Cup a month later. Held up in the early stages, he was still fourteenth of the eighteen runners turning into the straight but then finished strongly and failed by a nose to catch the British runner Alkaased who won in a record time of 2:22.1. The beaten runners included Zenno Rob Roy, Ouija Board, Warrsan, Bago and Better Talk Now. On 25 December, Heart's Cry was one of sixteen runners invited to contest the Arima Kinen. The colt had gone ten races and nineteen months since his last win and started at odds of 16.1/1 while the undefeated three-year-old champion Deep Impact was made the 3/10 favourite. Lemaire rode the horse close to the lead before moving to the front in <b>the</b> <b>straight</b> <b>and</b> holding off the late challenge of Deep Impact to win by half a length.|$|E
25|$|In 1999 El Condor Pasa {{was sent}} to France where he was trained with the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe as his objective. On his first European outing he {{finished}} second to Croco Rouge in the Prix d'Ispahan at Longchamp Racecourse in May. Two months later he faced opponents from France, Germany and Britain in the Grand Prix de Saint-Cloud. Ebina sent the colt into the lead in <b>the</b> <b>straight</b> <b>and</b> he drew clear to win by {{two and a half}} lengths from Tiger Hill and Dream Well, with Sagamix and Borgia among those unplaced. On his final trial for the Arc he defeated Borgia and Croco Rouge in the Prix Foy at Longchamp in September. On 3 October, El Condor Pasa started the 18/5 second favourite for the Arc behind Montjeu, the three-year-old winner of both the Prix du Jockey Club and Irish Derby. El Condor Pasa led from the start and broke clear of the field in the straight to establish a three length advantage. Montjeu emerged as his only challenger, and although El Condor Pasa rallied when the French colt drew alongside him he was overtaken in the last hundred metres and beaten by half a length. The first two were six lengths clear of the third placed Croco Rouge.|$|E

25|$|The third Season sees Cheryl still battling to {{keep her}} family on <b>the</b> <b>straight</b> <b>and</b> narrow. Both the men in her life are inside – Wolf after turning himself in to the cops {{as part of his}} master plan to frame Judd; Judd from being framed by Wolf. She borrows money from Gary Savage to pay for a better lawyer for Judd, which results in his release but the debt causes a strain in their relationship. Aurora dies in a road {{accident}} while trying to hide her ex-boyfriend's drugs after Van called the police on him, spiraling Van into depression. Loretta is outraged when Hayden edits their film to be more explicit for commercial gain, breaks up with him as punishment, and harasses him after he flatly accepts it instead of trying to win her back. This escalates until he leaves, and she burns down his house. After Hayden has left, she discovers she is pregnant by him. Bruce breaks up with Pascalle after he sees her (edited to be more explicit than she actually performed) porn movie. Jethro finds love in Danielle, a single mother and ex-wife of Gary. Ted becomes suspicious of Gary and tracks down Wolf, only to find Gary is Wolf's half brother. Over the season Munter develops a relationship with Kasey and marries her in the final episode.|$|E
25|$|The African threadfish has {{the typical}} body {{structure}} of a large jack, with a distinctly angular, strongly compressed body. The major identifying feature of the species is its head profile, having a slight concavity near the eyes which distinguishes it from the African pompano. The dorsal profile of the fish is more curved than the ventral profile, and the body is deepest between {{the origins of the}} soft dorsal and soft anal fins. The first section of the dorsal fin consists of 5 to 7 visible spines, with the second section having one spine and 20 to 22 soft rays. The anal fin has two spines followed by a single spine and 18 or 19 soft rays. The pectoral fin is long and curved, extending beyond the junction of <b>the</b> <b>straight</b> <b>and</b> curved sections of the lateral line. Anterior to the caudal fin are two oblate keels {{on each side of the}} line of scutes. The body appears to be scaleless, but on closer inspection has minute, deeply embedded scales. The lateral line is strongly curved anteriorly, with a section of 6 to 11 scutes toward the tail. Juveniles and often adults have long, filamentous trailing first anal and dorsal fin spines, a trait of all members of Alectis. The species grows to at least 1 m in length.|$|E
25|$|The British prevailed at the Battle of Krabbendam near Alkmaar on 10 September, {{where the}} Batavians and French were routed. This defeat was {{partly due to}} sloppy staffwork that {{allocated}} one narrow road to the columns of both Batavian divisions {{that were supposed to}} converge on the hamlet of Krabbendam. This hamlet sat astride one of the few entry roads to the Zijpe polder in which Abercromby had set up an armed camp. The polder formed a natural redoubt with its dike acting as a rampart and its circular drainage canal as a moat. <b>The</b> <b>straight</b> <b>and</b> narrow road through Krabbendam formed one of the few easy entries, but it was easily defensible also. The original plan had this entry point attacked by both Batavian divisions, but because Daendels' division was forced to take a more easterly route, only the division of Dumonceau was brought to bear. This division could not be fully deployed {{due to the nature of}} the terrain and the Batavian forces were therefore again fed piecemeal into the battle. They were unable to prevail over the valiant defence of the British 20th Foot. Elsewhere, the French division of General Vandamme was likewise unable to overcome the obstacles of the canal and the dike behind it, that protected the British troops. Vandamme therefore failed to turn Abercromby's right flank as planned.|$|E
