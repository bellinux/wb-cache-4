5|$|Certain species form {{communities}} called microatolls, {{which are}} colonies whose <b>top</b> <b>is</b> dead and mostly {{above the water}} line, but whose perimeter is mostly submerged and alive. Average tide level limits their height. By analyzing the various growth morphologies, microatolls offer a low resolution record of sea level change. Fossilized microatolls can also be dated using Radiocarbon dating. Such methods can help to reconstruct Holocene sea levels.|$|E
5|$|North from Nethermost Pike is the {{depression}} of Swallow Scarth, above {{the head of}} Nethermost Cove. From here the ridge climbs again, turning to the west as the long plateau of Helvellyn <b>top</b> <b>is</b> reached. Southwards the ridge steps down over High Crag, and narrows as it swings east around Ruthwaite Cove to Dollywaggon Pike. A heavily eroded path runs along the ridge, but actually bypasses the top of Nethermost Pike to the west, as it leads to Helvellyn.|$|E
5|$|The summit area is {{triangular}} in {{plan with}} ridges {{running to the}} north, south and east. The actual <b>top</b> <b>is</b> toward the northern corner and set back a little from the drop to Nethermost Cove. There is a rash of stones on the summit although the surroundings are mostly covered in rough grass, and several small cairns have been built. Other than northward, where the bulk of Helvellyn intervenes, the view is extensive, {{with much of the}} Lake District visible. Further ground is brought into view from the summit of High Crag.|$|E

5000|$|A cone top (also {{called a}} cap-sealed can, cone-top, or conetop) {{is a type}} of can, {{especially}} a type of beverage can, introduced in 1935. Cone <b>tops</b> <b>were</b> designed in response to flat top beer cans as a hybrid between beer bottle and flat top can. Cone <b>tops</b> <b>were</b> especially attractive to smaller breweries which did not have the capital necessary to buy new canning machinery; cone <b>tops</b> could <b>be</b> filled on standard bottling equipment.|$|R

5|$|An {{important}} feature of Western Chalukya roof art {{is the use of}} domical ceilings (not {{to be confused with the}} European types that are built of voussoirs with radiating joints) and square ceilings. Both types of ceilings originate from the square formed in the ceiling by the four beams that rest on four pillars. The dome above the four central pillars is normally the most attractive. The dome is constructed of ring upon ring of stones, each horizontally bedded ring smaller than the one below. The <b>top</b> <b>is</b> closed by a single stone slab. The rings are not cemented but held in place by the immense weight of the roofing material above them pressing down on the haunches of the dome. The triangular spaces created when the dome springs from the centre of the square are filled with arabesques. In the case of square ceilings, the ceiling is divided into compartments with images of lotus rosettes or other images from Hindu mythology.|$|E
5|$|Aureoboletus mirabilis, {{commonly}} known as the admirable bolete, the bragger's bolete, and the velvet <b>top,</b> <b>is</b> an edible species of fungus in the Boletaceae mushroom family. The fruit body has several characteristics with which it may be identified: a dark reddish-brown cap; yellow to greenish-yellow pores on the undersurface of the cap; and a reddish-brown stem with long narrow reticulations. Aureoboletus mirabilis is found in coniferous forests along the Pacific Coast of North America, and in Asia. Unusual for boletes, A.mirabilis sometimes appears to fruit on the wood or woody debris of Hemlock, suggesting a saprobic lifestyle. Despite occasional appearances to the contrary, Aureoboletus mirabilis is mycorrhizal, and forms close mutualistic associations with hemlock roots.|$|E
5|$|The {{description}} {{provided by}} Blake to Humphrey {{explains that the}} work depicts the resurrection. The top of the work depicts Christ on the Throne of Judgement with Heaven opened up across the painting. Behind Christ are the heads of infants which represent creation coming from Jesus. Christ is surrounded by the four Zoas and seven angels that have vials filled with God's wrath. An image of a tabernacle with a cross inside is depicted above Christ. An image of baptism is to Christ's right and the Last Supper is to Christ's left with both representing eternal life. Further to Christ's right is {{the resurrection of the}} just and to the left is the resurrection and subsequent fall of the wicked. Adam and Eve are below Christ, and Abraham and Moses are nearby. Below Moses is Satan wrapped by the Serpent and in the centre is the book of death. At the <b>top</b> <b>is</b> the book of life, and the Christian Church is the figure of a woman on top of the moon.|$|E
5|$|The uniform worn for {{practicing}} aikido (aikidōgi) {{is similar}} to the training uniform (keikogi) used in most other modern martial arts; simple trousers and a wraparound jacket, usually white. Both thick ("judo-style"), and thin ("karate-style") cotton <b>tops</b> <b>are</b> used. Aikido-specific <b>tops</b> <b>are</b> available with shorter sleeves which reach to just below the elbow.|$|R
2500|$|The Red <b>Top</b> <b>was</b> faster, and {{had greater}} range and {{maneuvrability}} than the Firestreak, and its more sensitive infrared seeker enabled {{a wider range}} of engagement angles. Being more sensitive it could home in on a target that had been warmed by air friction heating. In the aftermath of the 1957 Defence White Paper, Red <b>Top</b> <b>was</b> initially seen to be a stopgap measure only until the Bloodhound Mk. II SAM came into service. This meant that some of the planned improvements to Red <b>Top</b> <b>were</b> never carried out, including all-aspect capability (as seen on the later AIM-9L/M Sidewinder). Red <b>Top</b> <b>was</b> only [...] "capable of all aspect homing against super-sonic targets."

5|$|The {{monument}} is of ashlar stone masonry, 25feet (7.6m) high, in the English Baroque style. On {{the south}} side is a slate tablet inscribed with a quotation from the account by Lord Clarendon (1609–1674) in his History of the Rebellion and Civil Wars in England of the Battle of Lansdowne (1643). On the north side are two poems. On <b>top</b> <b>is</b> a griffin (the crest and supporters of the Grenvilles) holding an escutcheon displaying the Grenville coat of arms: Gules, three clarions or. On another side are shown the Royal Arms of King Charles II (1660–1685) supported by the arms of Sir Bevil's eldest son and heir John Granville, 1st Earl of Bath (1628–1701) and by {{the arms of the}} latter's half first cousin General George Monck, 1st Duke of Albemarle, KG (1608–1670). Monck was the principal figure behind the Restoration of the Monarchy to King Charles II in 1660, in effecting which he was much assisted by Sir John Grenville, for which services both were elevated to the peerage.|$|E
5|$|The {{rear face}} is plainer, with no jewels, but still highly decorated; Cherry speculates {{that it may}} {{originally}} {{have been much more}} simple and not designed for viewing, with most of the other elements added after it was originally made. At the <b>top</b> <b>is</b> a medallion with the face of Christ set in a sunburst. The central round-topped area contains two doors, secured with a small gold pin, containing full-length gold figures in relief, chased in gold, a feature unique to this reliquary. On the left door is the archangel Saint Michael, spearing a dragon representing the devil. He was both the patron saint of the French monarchy, and also traditionally the person responsible for supervising the chaotic crowds at the Last Judgement, when he is often shown in art weighing souls in a pair of scales. On the right is Saint Christopher, carrying the Christ child on his shoulders, who raises his hand in blessing. There was a popular belief that sight of an image of Saint Christopher meant that a person would not die on that day without receiving the Last Rites, which may well explain his presence here.|$|E
5|$|The slug-like larva of Phoronis ovalis swims {{for about}} 4 days, creeps on the sea-bed for 3 to 4 days, then bores into a {{carbonate}} floor. Nothing {{is known about}} three species. The remaining species develop free-swimming actinotroch larvae, which feed on plankton. The actinotroch is an upright cylinder with the anus {{at the bottom and}} fringed with cilia. At the <b>top</b> <b>is</b> a lobe or hood, under which are: a ganglion, connected to a patch of cilia outside the apex of the hood; a pair of protonephridia (smaller and simpler than the metanephridia in the adult); the mouth; and feeding tentacles that encircle the mouth. After swimming for about 20 days, the actinotroch settles on the seabed and undergoes a catastrophic metamorphosis (radical change) in 30minutes: the hood and larval tentacles are absorbed and the adult lophophore is created round the mouth, and both now points upward; the gut develops a U-bend so that the anus is just under and outside the lophophore. Finally the adult phoronid builds a tube.|$|E

5|$|Tourism {{has been}} a more {{successful}} industry in the area.
