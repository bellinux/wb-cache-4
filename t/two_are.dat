5000|$|Franklin T. Lambert (2003) has {{examined}} the religious affiliations and beliefs of the Founders.

5|$|A {{recent study}} of raven {{mitochondrial}} DNA showed that the isolated population from the Canary Islands is distinct from other populations. The study did not include any individuals from the North African population, and its position is therefore unclear, though its morphology {{is very close to}} the population of the Canaries (to the extent that the <b>two</b> <b>are</b> often considered part of a single subspecies).|$|E

5|$|A second {{species of}} Voalavo, eastern voalavo, was named in 2005 from central Madagascar. Morphological {{differences}} between the <b>two</b> <b>are</b> subtle but consistent, and the cytochrome b sequences of the two species differ by about 10%. In mammals, closely related species regularly differ by less than 5% in their cytochrome b sequences, and a divergence of more than 5% within a single species suggests the presence of cryptic species.|$|E
5|$|According to the IUCN, further taxonomic {{investigation}} {{is required to}} confirm the black dogfish in the North Atlantic and the southeastern Atlantic represent the same species. A 2010 phylogenetic study by Nicolas Straube and colleagues, based on nuclear and mitochondrial DNA, found the black dogfish is the sister species of the whitefin dogfish (C.ritteri), and the <b>two</b> <b>are,</b> in turn, sister to the clade formed by the granular dogfish (C.granulatum) and combtooth dogfish (C.nigrum).|$|E

5|$|Altar 4 is a {{circular}} monument. It {{was also found}} {{in the northern part of}} the East Plaza and was associated with Stela 4.

Hieroglyphic texts are carved underneath the prisoners and upon the sides of the altar. The altar has been dated on stylistic grounds to the latter part of the 8th century AD.|$|E
5|$|Although Squidward, {{annoyed with}} SpongeBob's fear at the story, manages to {{convince}} him that he made the whole story up, the <b>two</b> <b>are</b> soon alarmed by strange occurrences that parallel the omens that signify the arrival of the Hash-Slinging Slasher later that night when the restaurant is empty. Although convinced at first that these occurrences are coincidence, Squidward grows more nervous as the occurrences continue.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the species}} was first named in 1904, it was {{included}} in Natterer's bat (Myotis nattereri) until molecular studies, first published in 2006, demonstrated that the <b>two</b> <b>are</b> distinct species. M.escalerai is most closely related to an unnamed species from Morocco. Unlike M.nattereri, which lives in small groups in tree holes, M.escalerai forms large colonies in caves. Females start to aggregate in late spring in maternity colonies, and their young are born in summer. The species spends each winter in hibernation colonies, usually in caves or basements.|$|E

5|$|As the <b>two</b> <b>are</b> {{otherwise}} unattested {{outside of}} Snorri's Prose Edda, suggestions {{have been made}} that Hj√∫ki and Bil may have been of minor mythic significance, or that they were made up outright by Snorri, while Anne Holtsmark (1945) posits that Snorri may have known or had access to a now lost verse source wherein Hj√∫ki and Bil personified the waxing and waning moon. Holtsmark further theorizes that Bil {{may have been a}} d√≠s (a type of female deity).|$|E
