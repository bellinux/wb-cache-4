30|$|The {{results of}} {{occupational}} pensions {{and the risk}} of forfeiture <b>on</b> work <b>engagement</b> controlling for establishment heterogeneity are presented in Columns 3 to 6 of Table 3. Controlling for observable establishment characteristics (Columns 3 and 4), the effect <b>on</b> <b>engagement</b> is still entirely driven by individuals facing the risk of forfeiture of pension savings. It increases work engagement by 0.15 standard deviations. A similar effect size is obtained in column 6, when including establishment-level fixed effects. After controlling for potential selection across establishments, the risk of forfeiture still has a large effect <b>on</b> work <b>engagement.</b> Suggesting that under the risk of forfeiture, pensions have an efficiency wage effect <b>on</b> <b>engagement.</b>|$|R

Dynamic equilibrium equations for the unsteady state are developed and {{the solution to}} the displacement fields and the stress fields for a crack propagating with high crack tip acceleration, deceleration and rapidly varying stress intensity factor. The influence of <b>transients</b> <b>on</b> the higher order terms of the stress fields are explicitly revealed. Using these stress components, isochromatic fringes around the propagating crack are generated for different crack speeds, crack tip accelerations and the time rate of change of stress intensity factor, and the effects of the <b>transients</b> <b>on</b> these fringes are discussed. The effects of the <b>transients</b> <b>on</b> the dynamic stress intensity factor are discussed when a crack propagates with high acceleration and deceleration. The effect of <b>transient</b> <b>on</b> the time rate of change of dynamic stress intensity factor below Rayleigh wave speed in an infinite body is also studied...|$|R

40|$|Scholars {{disagree}} {{about the impact}} of the Internet on civic and political engagement. Some scholars argue that Internet use will contribute to civic decline, whereas other scholars view the Internet as having a role to play in re-invigorating civic life. This article assesses the hypothesis that Internet use will contribute to further declines in civic life. This article also assesses whether Internet use has a significant effect on civic and political engagement. This paper employs a meta-analysis approach to current research in this area. In total, 38 studies (with 166 effects) are examined. The meta-data provide strong evidence against the Internet having a negative effect <b>on</b> <b>engagement.</b> However, the meta-data do not establish that Internet use will have a substantial impact <b>on</b> <b>engagement.</b> The effects of Internet use <b>on</b> <b>engagement</b> seem to increase across time.

40|$|Lower {{levels of}} {{academic}} achievement amongst children of lower SES have long interested researchers. Influences of SES are often addressed by studying predictors of achievement in economically advantaged and disadvantaged samples. Levels of engagement in school, argued to contribute to academic achievement independently of intelligence, {{have been found to}} be relatively lower amongst children from low SES families. Low SES is thus argued to have a destructive influence <b>on</b> <b>engagement</b> and achievement compared to the more constructive influences of high SES. The relative strength of influences of SES <b>on</b> <b>engagement</b> and academic achievement have been largely ignored. The present study used a difference-in-score approach to assess the strength of SES influences <b>on</b> <b>engagement</b> and achievement at different levels of SES. Regression analyses predicting difference in engagement and difference in grades were carried out, controlling for gender and IQ. SES influenced engagement more strongly at higher levels of SES, unifying siblings in their relatively high engagement levels independently of gender or IQ. A similar relation between SES and academic achievement was partially mediated by engagement, indicating that SES influenced engagement levels, which then contributed to academic achievement. This trend was evident only in the biologically-related sibling samples, indicating that the influences of SES <b>on</b> <b>engagement</b> and academic achievement are primarily genetic. The implications of these findings are discussed...|$|R

Sustainable labor {{participation}} {{is seen as}} one of the most important solutions to this problem. Sustainable labor participation is a concept which is influenced by a large variety of factors. That is why scientific research into this topic, often focusses on specific indicators of sustainable labor participation. In this study this specific indicator is ‘engagement’. Engagement is a positive indicator of sustainable labor participation. It also adds value for both employer and employee. And finally is of importance for sustainable labor participation via vitality. In relation to engagement, two antecedents are investigated, namely work related motives and HR instruments. HR instruments are not only expected to have a direct effect <b>on</b> <b>engagement,</b> but they are also expected to increase the effect of work related motives. The research was performed amongst participants of a respondents panel. Only the data from 153 respondents who worked for an employer were used for this study. The results show that, from the work related motives, only generativity motives have an effect <b>on</b> <b>engagement.</b> Growth motives have no effect. From the HR instruments only participation & autonomy have a direct effect <b>on</b> <b>engagement.</b> Although there was no direct effect from teamwork <b>on</b> <b>engagement,</b> teamwork appeared to amplify the positive effect of generativity motives. Participation & autonomy however turned out to have a negative effect on the relationship between generativity motives and engagement. These results show how important it is, that organizations learn to identify generativity motives. These can be an important determinant for engagement and enables organization to apply proper HR instruments, to increase the engagement of their employees...|$|R
