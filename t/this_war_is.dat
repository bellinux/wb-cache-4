25|$|<b>This</b> <b>war</b> <b>is</b> {{notorious for}} the British {{scorched}} earth policy, which was implemented {{when it became}} clear that the guerrilla tactics practiced by the republican Boer forces could not be overcome by conventional means. In 1901, Emily Hobhouse reported on the genocide which was taking place in the 45 British concentration camps for Boer women, children and elderly in which, over an 18-month period, 26,370 people would die, 24,000 of them boys and girls under 16. Exact mortality figures in the 64 concentration camps for black displaced farm workers and their families are not known, but was probably even worse.|$|E

500|$|Yugoslav and Serb {{propaganda}} portrayed Croatian separatists as genocidal Ustaše, who had illegally {{taken over}} Yugoslav territory and were threatening Serb civilians in a reprise of the anti-Serb pogroms of the Second World War. Kadijević later justified the JNA's offensive against Vukovar {{on the grounds}} that it was part of the [...] "backbone of the Croatian army" [...] and had to be [...] "liberated". The JNA's periodical Narodna Armija claimed after the battle that Vukovar [...] "had for decades been prepared to support German military penetration down the Danube." [...] Šešelj declared: [...] "We're all one army. <b>This</b> <b>war</b> <b>is</b> a great test for Serbs. Those who pass the test will become winners. Deserters cannot go unpunished.

On 8 November the unit was moved to RAF Leuchars and then on 29 November back to No. 11 Group RAF in the south at RAF Tangmere near Chichester in West Sussex. The squadron remained idle for the winter as The Blitz and the German night attacks began and lasted in to the following spring. Finucane billeted near Oving. While drinking at a nearby pub overlooking the harbour an air raid struck Southampton. Finucane heard the drone of German bombers over the Isle of Wight {{in the distance and}} watched as the pathfinders marked the city. They clambered into a Wolseley Hornet two-seater car and headed into the town to seek out acquaintances of a squadron-mate. After seeing the destruction in the city Finucane remarked: [...] "Until <b>this</b> <b>war</b> <b>is</b> won we must shoot every Jerry from the sky." ...|$|E
500|$|Some things {{explored}} in the album were Radke's personal experiences, which include his mother, {{the corruption of}} Las Vegas, and his incarceration in prison due to multiple run-ins with the law involving narcotics and battery charges related {{to the death of}} Michael Cook. Radke stated that he chose not to write any songs about love because, [...] "...I'm not going to lie ... and try to write songs on how much I love somebody. I do have love, but {{there will be a lot}} of songs about just what I’ve been through." [...] Several songs focused on his departure from Escape the Fate after they kicked him out and replaced him with former Blessthefall singer Craig Mabbitt, with songs on the album that directly attacked both Mabbitt and Escape the Fate bassist Max Green. Prior to the album's release, Radke discussed what he intended to say about Escape the Fate on certain tracks, stating in an interview that he believed that the band's first album without Radke, <b>This</b> <b>War</b> <b>Is</b> Ours, was named after the conflict over Mabbitt taking over Radke's position in Escape the Fate. The band has since claimed it was not written about Radke, but he did not believe them.|$|E

500|$|The {{cause of}} <b>this</b> <b>war</b> <b>is</b> uncertain. There is {{a passage in}} Bede's Ecclesiastical History that {{suggests}} Aethelhere of East Anglia {{was the cause of}} the war. On the other hand, {{it has been argued that}} an issue of punctuation in later manuscripts confused Bede's meaning on this point, and that he in fact meant to refer to Penda as being responsible for the war. cites the punctuation of an early version of Bede's history, the Leningrad manuscript (c. 746); he argues that it is more true to Bede's original meaning than the Moore manuscript (c. 737), which he believes was written in a hurried and careless fashion, but which has greatly influenced interpretations of the text. Although, according to Bede, Penda tolerated some Christian preaching in Mercia, it has been suggested that he perceived Bernician sponsorship of Christianity in Mercia and Middle Anglia as a form of [...] "religious colonialism" [...] that undermined his power, and that this may have provoked the war. Elsewhere the possibility has been suggested that Penda sought to prevent Oswiu from reunifying Northumbria, not wanting Oswiu to restore the kingdom to the power it had enjoyed under Edwin and Oswald. A perception of the conflict in terms of the political situation between Bernicia and Deira could help to explain the role of Aethelwald of Deira in the war, since Aethelwald was the son of Oswald and might not ordinarily be expected to ally with those who had killed his father. Perhaps, as the son of Oswald, he sought to obtain the Bernician kingship for himself.|$|E
500|$|Having just {{repelled}} the Serbian incursion into Bosnia, the Austro-Hungarian Army regrouped {{and positioned}} itself for one final invasion before winter set in. Potiorek was again placed {{in charge of}} Austro-Hungarian forces and was given command of the Austro-Hungarian 6th Army. The Austro-Hungarian 5th Army was commanded by Liborius Ritter von Frank. In total, the Austro-Hungarians had 450,000 troops at their disposal. The Serbian Army had 400,000 soldiers ready to face the Austro-Hungarian advance. In mid-October, the Austro-Hungarians launched another thrust into northwestern Serbia; Potiorek appeared confident. [...] "Soldiers of the 5th and 6th armies," [...] he said. [...] "The goal of <b>this</b> <b>war</b> <b>is</b> nearly attained—the complete destruction of the enemy. The three-month campaign is almost over; we must only break the enemy's last resistance {{before the onset of}} winter." [...] The Serbs were exhausted and demoralized. In a telegram to Putnik dated 27 October 1914, Stepanović complained that the 2nd Army did not have enough shells to resist the Austro-Hungarians effectively and requested that he be removed from his command; Putnik denied the request, but ordered all units to resist the Austro-Hungarian advance {{for as long as possible}} before retreating. This strategy had worked in Putnik's favour during the summer months, but heavy rainfall in September and early October had reduced all of Serbia's roads to [...] "muddy quagmires" [...] that made movement of troops, guns and wagons extremely difficult. Potiorek recognized that the Serbian Army was in a difficult situation; he was certain that a third invasion would bring him the decisive victory that he so desperately wanted. In Vienna and Sarajevo, Austro-Hungarian officials began planning for the occupation and dismantling of Serbia. The country was to be plundered and its territory used to bribe the neutral Balkan states into joining the Central Powers, with the Romanians getting the region of Timočka Krajina and the Bulgarians getting Macedonia and southeastern Serbia. The Austro-Hungarians intended to annex everything west of the Morava River, as well as the cities of Scutari (Shkodër) and Durazzo (Durrës) in northern Albania. The Serbs living west of the Morava—or [...] "the compact masses of the Serbian element", as the Austro-Hungarians called them—were to be expelled and replaced with Austrian settlers (colonisten), who would [...] "change the psychology , making Serbia more Habsburg [...] less Serbian in outlook." [...] Ludwig Thallóczy, section chief of the Austro-Hungarian Finance Ministry, wrote Potiorek in October, recommending [...] "the West Europeanization of the Serbs with a strong hand" [...] as soon as Serbia was occupied.|$|E

2500|$|Overtures were unquestionably made by Thebes for an {{alliance}} with Aegina c. 507 BC, but they came to nothing.

Herodotus had no Athenian victories to record after the initial success, and the fact that Themistocles was able to carry his proposal to devote the surplus funds of the state to the building of so large a fleet seems to imply that the Athenians were themselves convinced that a supreme effort was necessary.|$|E

By late January 1766, the Burmese armies had overcome numerically superior but poorly coordinated Siamese defences, and converged before the Siamese capital.|$|R

However, Block almost missed out on the meeting and required some assertive action on Block's part. Block was working on the rehearsal of a USO show when at one point realized the rest of Hope's group had disappeared. Block was enraged when he discovered they had left him behind while they went to meet General Eisenhower. Block rushed over to the hotel serving as Eisenhower's headquarters, only to see Hope's entire group descending the stairs, each with an autographed picture of the General.

2500|$|<b>This</b> <b>war</b> <b>is</b> {{perhaps the}} most famous Egyptian war heavily {{involving}} the naval strength of the empire, and it is the first to ever be well documented. During the reign of Rameses III which was in 1182 BCE to 1151 BCE, a new threat arose to challenge the Egyptians in a different way than what they were used to. A new people called the Sea People were arriving in the Levantine region and destroying its cities. Already the once mighty Hittites were destroyed by these people of mysterious origin and it soon became obvious that Egypt with all of its wealth would be next. Rameses III prepared a mighty fleet and planned to repulse the Sea Peoples in the Nile. In the account from the temple relief of Medinat Habu Ramises states, [...] "I prepared the river-mouth like a strong wall with warships, galleys, and light craft. They were completely equipped both fore and aft with brave fighters carrying their weapons, and infantry of all the pick of Egypt." ...|$|E
