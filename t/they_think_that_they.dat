6000|$|... "That {{certainly}} seems to decide it," [...] the general said. [...] "They {{have made a}} mistake indeed, if <b>they</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> will catch us napping." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps {{because the}} end is so near," [...] she replied. [...] "They know that I have strong English sympathies. Perhaps <b>they</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> would not bear the strain of the times which are coming." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I suppose, sir, <b>they</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> {{have the}} same right to sail on the ocean that others have. Seals and whales are the gifts of God, and one person has no more right to them than another." ...|$|E
60|$|The Frenchman {{took in the}} {{situation}} at a glance. They were ashore now, where <b>they</b> didn't <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> needed him further {{and the process of}} elimination had commenced. Well, it might as well come to a showdown now as later.|$|R
50|$|XV. That all {{men have}} a natural {{inherent}} right to emigrate from one state to another that will receive them, or {{to form a new}} state in vacant countries, or in such countries as they can purchase, whenever <b>they</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> thereby <b>they</b> may promote their own happiness.|$|R
60|$|Covered with blood--the {{blood of}} others--Crispin stood before them now. He was {{breathing}} hard and sweating at every pore, but still grim and defiant. His strength, he realized, was ebbing fast. Yet he shook himself, {{and asked them}} with a gibing laugh did <b>they</b> not <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> had better shoot him.|$|R
6000|$|... "That is to say, {{we think}} you cannot do so. People can do {{so many things that}} they don't think they can do; and can't do so many things that <b>they</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> can do! When will the dean be home?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And I {{can assure}} you that they are {{generally}} too well inclined to make free with the names of girls whom <b>they</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> like. You must not be surprised if I am unwilling that any man should make free with your name." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The time is just at hand now, cap. The redskins {{are tired}} of waiting. At least, <b>they</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> had better not put it off any longer. They know, {{as well as we}} do, that it won't do to wait till it gets dark.|$|E
25|$|That year {{hundreds}} of members {{returned to the}} church fellowship, many of them confessing <b>that</b> <b>they</b> did not <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> had ever really been converted before.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{suppose they}} feel pretty {{confident}} that our report {{is not likely}} to encourage an attack, and <b>they</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> if <b>they</b> were to blow us to pieces it would only make Captain Wilson the more determined to destroy them. At least that is the conclusion I came to as I rowed back last time." ...|$|R
50|$|The horrified girls believe Helga {{is doing}} this to them. <b>They</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> if <b>they</b> kill Drew, he will become a ghost just like Helga, making her happy enough to grant them mercy. They arrange for Drew and Helga to meet at the park the next night. However, {{in their attempt to}} shoot Drew, the girls accidentally shoot Helga instead.|$|R
60|$|I {{think that}} they are often too hard upon themselves. I believe that they are very often loving God with their whole hearts, when <b>they</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are not doing so. But still, it is well to be afraid of oneself, and {{dissatisfied}} with oneself.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes;--but {{the worst}} of it is, that when they suffer from this weakness, which you call sensitiveness, <b>they</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are made of finer {{material}} than other people. Men shouldn't be made of SÃ¨vres china, but of good stone earthenware. However, I don't want to abuse him, poor fellow." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{fasten the}} {{shutters}} pretty securely," [...] Fergus went on. [...] "They are three inches of solid oak, {{and you see}} these bars are all riveted at each end. I suppose <b>they</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> would {{have plenty of time}} to cut the rivet heads off, before any army could approach." ...|$|E
60|$|And again, How {{are they}} to believe {{concerning}} themselves, then when they put forth the first act of faith towards this righteousness for justification? Are <b>they</b> to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are righteous, or sinners? Sinners, doubtless, they are to reckon themselves, and as such to reckon themselves justified by this righteousness. And this is according to the sentence of God, as appeareth by such sayings.|$|R
6000|$|... "Of {{course they}} do, Colonel Osborne; and why shouldn't <b>they?</b> <b>Think</b> of all <b>that</b> <b>they</b> {{have to endure}} out in those horrible places. How {{would you like to}} live in the Mandarins?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No; <b>that's</b> my hope. <b>They</b> {{will know}} I had forty miles to ride to your station. Besides, {{had it not}} been that I was expecting the {{shepherd}} in for supplies, I might not have found it out for two or three days. So I expect <b>they</b> will <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are pretty safe from pursuit. They have never been followed far into the bush. It's nasty work, you see." ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{woman in}} the shop {{answered}} me without hesitation that {{it was to be}} at eight o'clock in the morning. [...] "You see, Watson, no mystery; everything above-board! In some way the legal forms have undoubtedly been complied with, and <b>they</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> have little to fear. Well, there's nothing for it now but a direct frontal attack. Are you armed?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They are {{ripe for}} mischief," [...] said Labienus. [...] "And who can wonder, {{when it is}} we {{soldiers}} who uphold the Empire upon our spears, while the lazy citizens at Rome reap all of our sowing. Why cannot a soldier have what a soldier gains? So long as they throw us our denarius a day, <b>they</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> have done with us." ...|$|E
6000|$|Claire raged: [...] "You know, {{this town}} really has aspirations. They're {{beginning}} to build such nice little bungalows, and there's a fine clean bank---- Then they permit this scoundrel to advertise the town among strangers, influential strangers, in motors, by serving food like this! I suppose <b>they</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> arrest criminals here, yet this restaurant {{man is a}} thief, to charge real money for food like this---- Yes, and he's a murderer!" ...|$|E
50|$|FileZilla {{was started}} as a {{computer}} science class project in {{the second week of}} January 2001 by Tim Kosse and two classmates.Before they started to write the code, they discussed under which license they should release the code. They decided to make FileZilla an open-source project because many FTP clients were already available, and <b>they</b> didn't <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> would sell a single copy if they made FileZilla commercial.|$|R
50|$|Braden and Jack {{learn of}} {{a large group of}} Dream Fighters who have {{disappeared}} over the years, known as The Nowhere Kids. One of them, Xavier, has the ability to strip an enemy's powers, something he did years before in the first Zyrvie War. Little do the Dream Fighters know that the Nowhere Kids are closer than <b>they</b> <b>think,</b> and <b>that</b> <b>they</b> have something planned for them.|$|R
5000|$|The book's {{title is}} a {{reference}} to some abuse survivors stating <b>that</b> <b>they</b> had never told anyone about their abuse due to various reasons such as threats of harm or <b>that</b> <b>they</b> did not <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> would be believed.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, my fair lord, {{they have}} learned their lesson," [...] said Chandos. [...] "Because we have had good fortune upon our feet at Crecy and {{elsewhere}} <b>they</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> have found the trick of it. But it is {{in my mind that}} it is very different to stand when you are assailed, as we have done, and to assail others when you must drag your harness for a mile and come weary to the fray." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{know well}} what such men are, and I know {{the evil that}} is done {{to them by the}} cramming they endure. They learn many names of things--high-sounding names, and they come to {{understand}} a great deal about words. It is a knowledge that requires no experience and very little real thought. But it demands much memory; and when they have loaded themselves in this way, <b>they</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are instructed in all things. After all, what can they do that is of real use to mankind? What can they create?" ...|$|E
60|$|Now Grandfather Frog is old {{and in the}} Smiling Pool he is {{accounted}} very, very wise. But {{the wisest}} sometimes become foolish when <b>they</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> know {{all there is to}} know. It was so with Grandfather Frog. It was he who was foolish and not Danny Meadow Mouse. You see Danny knew all the dangers on the Green Meadows, and how many sharp eyes were all the time watching for him. He had long ago learned {{that the only way to}} feel safe was to feel afraid. You see, then he was watching for danger every minute, and so he wasn't likely to be surprised by his hungry enemies.|$|E
6000|$|... "It isn't {{my fault}} {{that you are}} a study in contraries," [...] she laughed. [...] "But then {{politicians}} are rather like <b>that,</b> aren't <b>they?</b> I <b>think</b> really <b>that</b> <b>they</b> should be like surgeons, specialise all the time." ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>They</b> {{start to}} <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> have {{to survive in}} that world and change the [...] "future." [...] Otherwise, {{there will be no}} [...] "future." [...] <b>They</b> begin to <b>think</b> about the reasons why they are {{transferred}} to the future. <b>That</b> is because <b>they</b> are chosen to change the future.|$|R
60|$|That is the {{sensation}} persons generally experience {{when they first}} go up in a balloon. Not being used to rising in the air, <b>they</b> <b>think</b> at first <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are stationary, and that the earth {{and all the people}} and houses on it are falling below them.|$|R
60|$|I {{have often}} read in stories of {{boys who were}} fond of nature, and loved her sublimity and beauty, but I do not believe boys are ever {{naturally}} fond of nature. They want {{to make use of}} the woods and fields and rivers; and when they become men they find these aspects of nature endeared to them by association, and so <b>they</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were dear for their own sakes; but the taste for nature is as purely acquired as the taste for poetry or the taste for tomatoes. I have often seen boys wondering at the rainbow, but it was wonder, not admiration that moved them; and I have seen them excited by a storm, but because the storm was tremendous, not because it was beautiful.|$|E
60|$|The {{powers of}} this world will come and take away their place, and their power, and their station: but {{meanwhile}} the truth which <b>they</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> have stifled will rise again, for Christ, who is the truth, will raise it again; and it shall conquer and leaven the hearts of men till all be leavened; and while the scribes and Pharisees shall be cast into the outer darkness of discontented and hopeless bigotry, the kingdoms of the world, which they fancied were the devil's dominion, shall become the kingdoms of God and of his Christ, and be adopted into that holy and ever-growing Church, {{of which it is}} written, that the gates of hell shall not prevail against it, for in it is the Spirit of God to lead it into all truth.|$|E
60|$|I {{know many}} people do not think thus. They think of God as looking only at our faults; as extreme to mark what is done amiss; as never content with us; as always crying to men, Yes, you have done this and that well, and yet not quite well, for even in {{what you have done}} there are blots and mistakes; but this and that you have not done, and {{therefore}} you are still guilty, still under infinite displeasure. And <b>they</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> exalt God's holiness by such thoughts, and magnify His hatred of sin thereby. And they invent arguments to prove themselves right, such as this: That because God is an infinite being, every sin committed against Him is infinite; and therefore deserves an infinite punishment; which is a juggle of words of which any educated man ought to be ashamed.|$|E
6000|$|Imputed, that is, {{reckoned}} or accounted to him. And {{why should}} it not be accounted to him for righteousness? What did Christ bring it into the world for? for the righteous or for sinners? No doubt for sinners. And how must it be reckoned to them? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision; not as righteous, but as sinners. And how are they to consider of themselves, even then when they first are apprehensive of their need of this righteousness? Are <b>they</b> to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are righteous, or sinners? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; this morning. <b>They</b> little <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> can {{do nothing}} without my knowing it. He was there for nearly four hours, and she was dressed up in a white robe as Jael, with a turban on her head. Jael, indeed! I call it very improper, and I am quite {{astonished}} that Maria Clutterbuck should have lent herself to such a piece of work. That Maria was never very wise, of course we all know; but I thought that she had principle enough to have kept her from this kind of thing." ...|$|R
