40|$|Two radiometric {{calibration}} {{sources that}} are utilized by various groups are maintained and operated. One source is a 6 -ft diameter sphere {{and the other}} a 4 -ft diameter hemisphere. Both are internally coated with multiple layers of barium sulfate and house an array of 12 <b>tungsten</b> filament-quartz <b>iodine</b> <b>lamps</b> that provide a uniform diffuse target of radiance traceable to NBS. The lamps are baffled and arranged so that they {{are not part of the}} scene during calibrations. Both systems have a 10 -inch viewing aperture. The hemisphere is somewhat more versatile in that the aperture can be changed and the system is movable so calibrations can be done at other sites. Together, these systems have supported numerous GSFC projects and missions during this review period. They are listed...|$|R

40|$|Spectral {{responses}} of two humid mesic region glaciated soils, Chalmers {{silty clay loam}} and Fincastle silt loam, formed under prairie grass and forest vegetation, respectively, were measured both in the laboratory under controlled moisture equilibria, and in the field under various moisture and crop residue conditions. The Exotech Model 20 C spectroradiometer obtained spectral data in the 0. 52 to 2. 32 µm wavelength range in 0. 1 µm increments while used in an indoor configuration with a bidirectional reflectance factor reflectometer providing an artificial illumination source consisting of a 1000 watt <b>tungsten</b> <b>iodine</b> coiled filament <b>lamp</b> with transfer optics. Asbestos tension tables were used to maintain a pF 2 (approximately one-tenth bar) moisture equilibrium following saturation of crushed, sieved soil samples held in 10 -cm diam x 2 cm rings with 50 mesh wire bases. The same spectroradiometer was used outdoors under solar illumination to obtain spectral response from dry and moistened field plots with and without corn residue cover, representing the two different soils. Pressed BaSO₄ served as the reflectance standard indoors while a 1. 2 m square painted BaSO₄ panel (which in turn was compared to pressed BaSO₄) served as the calibration standard in the field. Detector height above the indoor samples was 2. 44 m using the 3 / 4 ° field of view mode, while measurements in the field were made at a 6. 1 m height using the 152 ̆ 7 field of view mode. Results indicate that laboratory-measured spectra of moist soil are directly proportional to the spectral response of that same moist bare soil in the field over the 0. 52 to 1. 75 µm wavelength range. The magnitude of differences in spectral response between identically treated Chalmers and Fincastle soils is greatest in the 0. 6 to 0. 8 µm transition region between the visible and near infrared, regardless of field condition or laboratory preparation studied...|$|R
50|$|Quartz <b>iodine</b> <b>lamps,</b> using {{elemental}} <b>iodine,</b> {{were the}} first commercial halogen lamps launched by GE in 1959. Quite soon, bromine {{was found to have}} advantages, but was not used in elemental form. Certain hydrocarbon bromine compounds gave good results. Regeneration of the filament is also possible with fluorine, but its chemical reactivity is so great that other parts of the lamp are attacked. The halogen is normally mixed with a noble gas, often krypton or xenon. The first lamps used only tungsten for filament supports, but some designs use molybdenum - an example being the molybdenum shield in the H4 twin filament headlight for the European Asymmetric Passing Beam.|$|R
50|$|A halogen lamp, {{also known}} as a {{tungsten}} halogen, quartz-halogen or quartz <b>iodine</b> <b>lamp,</b> is an incandescent lamp consisting of a tungsten filament sealed into a compact transparent envelope that is filled with a mixture of an inert gas and a small amount of a halogen such as iodine or bromine. The combination of the halogen gas and the tungsten filament produces a halogen cycle chemical reaction which redeposits evaporated tungsten to the filament, increasing its life and maintaining the clarity of the envelope. Because of this, a halogen lamp can be operated at a higher temperature than a standard gas-filled lamp of similar power and operating life, producing light of a higher luminous efficacy and color temperature. The small size of halogen lamps permits their use in compact optical systems for projectors and illumination.|$|R
500|$|Helium has a valence of {{zero and}} is {{chemically}} unreactive under all normal conditions. It is an electrical insulator unless ionized. As {{with the other}} noble gases, helium has metastable energy levels that allow it to remain ionized in an electrical discharge with a voltage below its ionization potential. Helium can form unstable compounds, known as excimers, with <b>tungsten,</b> <b>iodine,</b> fluorine, sulfur, and phosphorus when it is subjected to a glow discharge, to electron bombardment, or reduced to plasma by other means. The molecular compounds HeNe, HgHe10, and WHe2, and the molecular ions , , , and [...] have been created this way. HeH+ is also stable in its ground state, but is extremely reactive—it is the strongest Brønsted acid known, and therefore can exist only in isolation, as it will protonate any molecule or counteranion it contacts. This technique has also produced the neutral molecule He2, which has {{a large number of}} band systems, and HgHe, which is apparently held together only by polarization forces.|$|R
5000|$|A similar {{reaction}} {{like that}} of MoO2 is used in halogen lamps. The tungsten is evaporated from the tungsten filament and converted with traces of oxygen and iodine into the WO2I2, at the high temperatures near the filament the compound decomposes back to <b>tungsten,</b> oxygen and <b>iodine.</b>|$|R
50|$|The premier {{example is}} of the class is Mo6Cl142−. This dianion is {{available}} as a variety of salts by treating the polymer molybdenum(II) chloride with sources of chloride, even hydrochloric acid. A related example is W6I142− anion, which is obtained by reaction of <b>tungsten</b> hexacarbonyl with <b>iodine</b> at elevated temperatures.|$|R
40|$|Evaporation {{and skin}} {{temperature}} were measured in different series on 48 subjects with a cylindrical probe (Tewameter) above {{the skin of}} the lower leg, to assess the effect of visible incoherent polarized light (VIP) on human skin. The VIP-light was generated by a device from the company Bioptron. The experiments were performed on 24 participants of the Austrian moderate altitude study (AMAS 2000) in Obertauern (Austria, 1. 700 m above sea level) and 24 individuals living in Berlin. The following test series showed no correlation between evaporation and skin temperature. A solid consideration of the mean value concerning the evaporation is, due to large inter-individual differences in blank value as well as measured values after the light exposure, not sufficient. A closer examination of the evaporation suggests the fragmentation into 3 different groups showing a mild (group 1, 52 %), moderate (group 2, 29 %) and intensive response (group 3, 19 %). The mild group (group 1) showed virtually no change while the intensive group (group 3) had a high blank value as well as a strong increase after the light exposure. Isolated peaks of the evaporation were measured in few of the 24 subjects from Berlin after extending the measuring period to 62 min. The cause and a possible relation to the VIP-light exposure remains indistinct but could be conceivable. The feed-forward learning theory meaning an active scanning process of the environment by the organism could be an explanation. What is remarkable is a 2 °C temperature increase 40 min after the VIP-light exposure above the exposed skin surface in 79 % of the 24 subjects from Berlin. A possible explanation could be an increased cell and immune activity. The temperature increase was not observed by having the patient in a horizontal body position or after a placebo exposure with a quartz <b>iodine</b> <b>lamp...</b>|$|R

40|$|Aircraft {{measurements}} {{were made of}} trace gases, atmospheric particles, and condensed acid volatiles in the plume of El Chichon volcano, Chiapas, Mexico, in November 1982. Hydrogen sulfide was the primary gaseous sulfur species in the plume {{at the time of}} collection. Concentrations of 28 elements were determined by neutron activation analysis of particulate material from the plume. The volatile elements sulfur, chlorine, arsenic, selenium, bromine, antimony, <b>iodine,</b> <b>tungsten,</b> and mercury were enriched relative to bulk pyroclastic material by factors of 60 to 20, 000. Arsenic, antimony, and selenium were associated predominantly with small (not greater than 3 micrometer) particles. Calcium and sodium were present almost exclusively on larger particles and aluminum and manganese were bimodally distributed. Ashladen particulate material injected into the stratosphere during the early violent eruptions was enriched by factors of 10 to 30 relative to ash in some of the same elements observed in the quiescent plume...|$|R
