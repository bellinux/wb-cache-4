40|$|A {{mechanics}} of cutting analysis for orthogonal cutting with <b>tool</b> <b>flank</b> wear is presented {{based on an}} experimental investigation. It shows that <b>tool</b> <b>flank</b> wear does not statistically affect the basic cutting quantities such as the shear angle and shear stress, both qualitatively and quantitatively, but results in an additional rubbing or ploughing force on the wearland. Based on this finding, an orthogonal cutting force model is proposed which makes full use of the classical thin shear zone analysis for "sharp" tools. This model may {{form the basis for}} developing the predictive force models in practical operations. The study also shows that <b>tool</b> <b>flank</b> wear results in a substantial increase in the force components and that the thrust force is more sensitive to <b>tool</b> <b>flank</b> wear.

The machine-ability of titanium alloys is impaired by their high temperature chemical reactivity, low thermal conductivity and low modulus of elasticity. Polycrystalline cubic boron nitride represents a substitute tool material for turning titanium alloys due to its high hardness, wear resistance, thermal stability and hot red hardness. For determination of suitable cutting parameters in dry turning Ti- 6 AL- 4 V alloy by Polycrystalline cubic boron nitride cutting tools, the samples, 300 mm in length and 100 mm in diameter, were dry machined in a lathe.

40|$|The {{focus of}} this study is the turning of Al 2124 SiCp (45 % wt) Metal Matrix Composite using PCD, CBN-coated and CBN-uncoated tools. The {{machinability}} of Al 2124 SiCp (45 % wt) Metal Matrix Composite is evaluated by measurement of tool wear, surface finish and dimensional accuracy of the work-piece. Wear mechanisms and patterns of tools in turning of Al 2124 SiCp (45 % wt) Metal Matrix Composite are discussed. The experimental setup involved turning Al 2124 SiCp (45 % wt) 78. 0 mm long and 31. 8 mm diameter on a precision lathe at fixed feed rate, different depth of cut and cutting speed using PCD, CBN-coated and CBN-uncoated tools. The reinforcement of the matrix consists of SiC 5 - 8 µm in diameter. Experimental results reveal that abrasion and adhesion presented the most prevalent mode of wear among all the tools. Fracture was observed among CBN tools while chipping on PCD <b>tools.</b> <b>Flank</b> and crater wear were observed in all <b>tools</b> with <b>flank</b> wear more prevalent in both CBN-coated and CBN-uncoated. Wear among PCD tools was low as compared to CBN tools. Further analysis reveal that the outer layer of the CBN-coated tools wear off fast creating a good platform for adhesion of matrix material on to the tool. This further increases wear of the tool due to adhesive wear as the built-up edge breaks off from the tool. PCD tool presented better surface finish than CBN tools with CBN-coated performing better than CBN-uncoated. Due to high SiC content, discontinuous chips are formed which are also curled due to increase in temperature at cutting zone causing bimetallic effect on the chip. On dimensional accuracy it was observed that PCD tool produced lowest diameter error followed by CBN-uncoated and finally CBN-Coated. It is concluded that in machining Al 2124 SiCp (45 % wt) Metal Matrix Composite PCD tools are the best followed by CBN-coated and lastly CBN-uncoated...|$|R

The quality of surface finish was studied at various cutting parameters and at the two extreme stages of the machining process, i. e. {{at the beginning and}} end of the process. The objective is to evaluate the effect of a worn-out tool on the quality of surface finish. PVD-coated carbide tools were used in this study. Experiments were conducted at two cutting speeds, 35 and 55 m/min, two depths of cut, 0. 2 and 0. 25 mm, and a constant pitch of 2. 0 mm. The tool wear and the quality of surface finish were inspected visually by microscope. The <b>tool’s</b> <b>flank</b> wear was measured gradually and machining was stopped when the flank wear reached the rejection criterion of 0. 3 mm. The microstructure beneath the machined surface was also evaluated. It was found that, at the beginning of machining, there was only a feed mark on the surface finish. When the machining was prolonged until the tools reached the rejection criterion, a bad surface finish was produced. Metal debris, surface cavities and a boundary crack were observed. Results show that machining with a worn-out tool can cause microstructure alteration beneath the machined surface. The selection of cutting parameters and monitoring of tool wear are crucial in order to obtain a good surface finish.

In the high-speed cutting of Ti- 6 A 1 - 4 V, it is observed that the several chips adhere on the rake face of cutting edge. In addition, the output voltages from detector are obtained when the adhesion chips on the cutting edge pass through the measurement area of two-color pyrometer.

In this paper we proposed a novel work that is used to determine <b>tool</b> <b>flank</b> wear by observing the sound signals emitted during the turning process. The work-piece material we used here is steel and aluminum and the cutting insert was carbide material. Two different cutting speeds were used in this work. The feed rate and the cutting depth were constant whereas the flank wear was a variable. The emitted sound signal of a fresh tool (0 mm flank wear) a slightly worn tool (0. 2 - 0. 25 mm flank wear) and a severely worn tool (0. 4 mm and above flank wear) during turning process were recorded separately using a high sensitive microphone. Analysis using Singular Value Decomposition was done on these sound signals to extract the feature sound components.

40|$|Abstract Background Information about a {{transgene}} locus {{is one of}} {{the major}} concerns in transgenic research because expression of the transgene or a gene interrupted by the integration event could be affected. Thus, the flanking sequences obtained from transgenic plants need to be analyzed in terms of genomic context, such as genic and intergenic regions. This process may consist of several steps: 1) elimination of a vector sequence from the flanking sequence, 2) finding the locations in the target genome, and 3) statistics of the integration sites. These steps could be automated for flanking sequences from several dozens of transgenic plants generated in an ordinary targeted gene expression strategy. It would be indispensable in a genome-wide mutagenesis screen using T-DNA or transposons because these projects often generate several thousands of transgenic lines and just as many loci of the transgene among the transgenic plants. Results We present an open access web <b>tool,</b> <b>flanking</b> sequence tags validator (FSTVAL), to manage bulk flanking sequence tags (FSTs). FSTVAL automatically evaluates the FSTs and finds the best mapping positions of the FST against a known genome sequence. The statistics, in terms of genic and intergenic regions, are presented as a table, a distribution map, and a frequency graph along the chromosomes. Currently, 17 plant genome sequences, including Arabidopsis thaliana, Oryza sativa, and Glycine max, are available as reference genomes. We evaluated the utility and accuracy of the tool with 5, 144 rice FSTs. The whole process, from uploading the sequences to generating tables of insertions, required a few minutes, with less than 4 clicks in the web environment.

The tests were conducted until the drill was rejected when an average flank wear greater than 0. 10 mm was recorded. The results demonstrate that using a heat pipe in the drilling process can effectively perform thermal management comparable to the flooding coolant cooling used pervasively in the manufacturing industry, extending the tool life of the drill...|$|R
