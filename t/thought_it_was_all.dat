500|$|Most of the crowd, however, {{remained}} unpacified. They milled {{around the}} palace grounds with rumors abounding that the women's deputation had been duped – the queen would inevitably force the king to break any promises {{that had been}} made. Well aware of the surrounding dangers, Louis discussed the situation with his advisors. At about six o'clock in the evening, the king made a belated effort to quell {{the rising tide of}} insurrection: he announced that he would accept the August decrees and the Declaration of the Rights of Man without qualification. Adequate preparations to defend the palace were not made, however: the bulk of the royal guards, who had been deployed under arms in the main square for several hours facing a hostile crowd, was withdrawn {{to the far end of}} the park of Versailles. In the words of one of the officers: [...] "Everyone was overwhelmed with sleep and lethargy, we <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> over." [...] This left only the usual night guard of sixty-one Gardes du Corps posted throughout the palace.|$|E
500|$|The Queen {{reportedly}} felt a [...] "profound {{sense of}} disappointment" [...] in Blair for breaking with protocol by revealing {{in his memoirs}} sensitive details of private conversations he had with her during his time as Prime Minister. A spokesman for Buckingham Palace told a newspaper, [...] "No prime minister before has ever done this and {{we can only hope}} that it will never happen again." [...] The Sunday Express claimed, quoting [...] "renowned Royal biographer Hugo Vickers" [...] and other [...] "Royal insiders", that because of the book's contents, ElizabethII would withhold granting Blair the Order of the Thistle, an honour which is bestowed at the sovereign's personal prerogative and normally given almost automatically to leaders of Scottish descent after leaving office. Gordon Brown was said to be [...] "seething" [...] and [...] "dismayed" [...] over the criticism he received from Blair in the book, but had told aides not to criticise it. Ed Balls, a Brown ally who served in his government as Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families said, [...] "It would have been much better if the memoirs had been a celebration of success rather than recriminations. In that sense I <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> a bit sad. It was so one-sided. I didn't think it was comradely." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{strength}} of this argument did not exactly strike Feemy, but she <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> right, and said nothing.|$|E
6000|$|... "And thereby {{precipitate}} the catastrophe? Oh, give <b>it</b> <b>thought.</b> <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>it</b> needs. You <b>are</b> taking <b>it</b> {{for granted}} that nine o'clock is the hour appointed for King Monmouth's butchery." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, papa, I <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> had <b>been</b> <b>all</b> settled long ago! Mamma knew it, {{you knew}} it. Last July, mamma and you talked it over." ...|$|R
60|$|Colour {{suddenly}} faded out of {{the light}} streaming between the branches. And depression, always lying in ambush of the novelty of his freedom, began like mist to rise above his restless <b>thoughts.</b> <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> so devilish empty--this raft of the world floating under evening's shadow. How many sermons had he listened to, enriched with the simile of the ocean of life. Here they were, come home to roost. He had fallen asleep, ineffectual sailor that he was, and a thief {{out of the}} cloudy deep had stolen oar and sail and compass, leaving him adrift amid the riding of the waves.|$|R
6000|$|... "Your {{mother told}} me that in England people arrived very quietly; so I <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> right. Is one of those gentlemen your father?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I didn't {{know there}} was any woods in heaven," [...] said Mary, with a long breath. [...] "I <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> streets--and streets--AND streets." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And that is {{the reason}} Hugh and Westervelt were so cordial, and I <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> on account of the advance sale of The Morning!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, dear!" [...] The {{word was}} uttered {{with a low}} sigh. Then there was a pause, during which Lopez {{supported}} the sufferer. [...] "I <b>thought</b> that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> over with me at one moment." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{event was}} {{banned by the}} Shoreditch Borough Council. The only vote in favour of the bout going ahead came from a women member who stated “that if the girls wanted to maul each other, she <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{perfectly}} <b>all</b> right”.|$|R
6000|$|... “Oh, you rascal!” {{the captain}} said, {{pointing}} {{to an empty}} bottle lying in the bunk, “you <b>thought</b> that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> over, and so you emptied one of my bottles of aguardiente, and have slept like a hog all night.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> {{up with me}} yesterday," [...] he said, in an {{exhausted}} voice. [...] "They'd all given me up, hadn't you, Mrs. Foster?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then do {{you mean}} to say that there really is such a thing?" [...] Jackson said incredulously. [...] "Why I <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> a rag." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Mr. White,' said Lord Rotherwood, 'did ever {{you hear}} {{of a poor}} girl beset by an importunate youth, but his family <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> her fault?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Poor {{dear old}} Mary! There's a lesson against taking a letter on trust. I <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> would <b>be</b> <b>all</b> Cocksmoor, and {{would wait for}} a quiet moment! How good {{to come to me}} so soon, you dear old shipwrecked mariner!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not land at Ternate?" [...] {{the others}} exclaimed in consternation; for indeed, the {{work during the}} last few days had been very heavy, and they were rejoicing at the thought of an end to their labors [...] "Why, we <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> arranged, <b>all</b> along, we should stop at Ternate." ...|$|R
60|$|I think <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{the first}} time that ever I was angry with Amy in all my life; and when <b>all</b> <b>was</b> done, though she was a devilish jade in having such a <b>thought,</b> yet <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> of <b>it</b> the effect of her excess of affection and {{fidelity}} to me.|$|R
60|$|Several now ran on deck, and, for the moment, I <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> {{over with}} us; but we finally succeeded in {{restoring}} {{some degree of}} quiet.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Get sentence? D'you mean this?' She half {{closed her}} eyes, {{drew a deep}} breath, and shuddered. '"Notice" [...] I call it. Sir John <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> lies.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Have ye, Capting? Sure I <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> owin' {{to the bad}} manners o' that baste Dumps, {{which is}} for iver leadin' the other dogs into mischief." ...|$|E
60|$|Mr Powell, though {{moved to}} a certain extent, {{was by no means}} carried away. And just as he <b>thought</b> that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> over, the other, fidgeting in the darkness, was heard again explosive, bewildered but not very loud in the silence of the ship and the great empty peace of the sea.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't believe Jerry can be coming," [...] said Cecily in despair. [...] "I suppose {{his mother}} must have <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> dreadful, after <b>all,</b> to sell such a picture." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Sir Oswald," [...] Roger said, as {{they rode}} away, {{accompanied}} by twenty of Glendower's followers, under the orders of an officer; [...] "we have got out of that scrape better than could have been expected. When you and I were alone, {{in the midst of}} that crowd of Welshmen, I <b>thought</b> that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> over with us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What a shame! I <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> settled. What's the good, mamma, of Lord De Terrier being Prime Minister, if he can't make whom {{he likes}} a bishop?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'No. Father {{hated to}} hear of him' and never spoke about him if he could help it; and we <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> Mohun high notions because he wasn't quite a gentleman.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> a lie," [...] he said. The thought {{uppermost}} in {{his mind}} was the reiterated arguments of the morning. [...] "Have you a bandage on?" [...] he asked.|$|E
60|$|They {{spent the}} rest o' that day 'anging out of the winder, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> not till ha'-past four in the after-noon that Isaac, still wearing Peter's clothes and {{carrying}} a couple of large green plants under 'is arm, turned into the road, and from the way 'e <b>was</b> smiling they <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> must <b>be</b> <b>all</b> right.|$|R
60|$|Good-natured Humfrey, <b>thought</b> she, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> that I {{may not be}} mortified; {{but after}} <b>all</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> not those very good-natured people who best {{appreciate}} lofty actions. He is inviting Owen Sandbrook more because he thinks it would please papa, and because he compassionates him in his solitary lodgings, than because he feels {{the force of his}} glorious self-sacrifice.|$|R
6000|$|... "And that is {{just why}} you should be sorry for me," [...] said Anne, [...] "because the <b>thought</b> that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> my own fault <b>is</b> what makes <b>it</b> so hard. If I could blame it on anybody I would feel so much better. But {{what would you have}} done, Marilla, if you had been dared to walk a ridgepole?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is a trouble," [...] he says, [...] "that {{has come}} into my life only {{for a month or}} so--at least acutely again. I <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> over. There was someone----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "N--no, he didn't have that," [...] was {{the slow}} reply. [...] "But I <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> right. He {{looked like an}} honest chap. You had better notify the police at once." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course she's got a {{right to}} go out with whom she pleases," [...] he told himself. [...] "But still I thought--well I <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> fixed between us, that's all." ...|$|E
5000|$|Zaire {{were then}} the first sub-Saharan African team {{to qualify for the}} World Cup finals; however, during the tournament the players {{discovered}} they would not be paid. [...] "Most of the Brazilian players and the crowd <b>thought</b> that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> hilarious, amateur act. I just could scream 'you cursed!' for all them, because nobody there knew the pressure that we was living".|$|R
6000|$|... "I cannot bear {{this any}} longer," [...] she cried. [...] "I must {{ask you a}} question, and you must answer <b>it.</b> The <b>thought</b> of <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>is</b> driving me mad." ...|$|R
60|$|Norman paused, and coloured. He {{remembered the}} pain it {{had given him}} to find himself {{incapable}} of being of use to his father, {{and that he had}} resolved to conquer the weakness of nerve of which he was ashamed; but he did not like to connect this with his fastidious feelings of refinement. He would not own to himself that they were over nice, and, at the bottom of all this justification, rankled Richard's saying, that he who cared for such things was unfit for a clergyman. Norman's secret <b>thought</b> <b>was,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> very well for those who could only aspire to parish work in wretched cottages--people who could distinguish themselves were more useful at the university, forming minds, and opening new discoveries in learning.|$|R
