5|$|After {{the power}} outage was over, Hydro-Québec made {{numerous}} upgrades to its system {{in order to}} improve <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>grid.</b> Examples include the strengthening of electrical pylons and power poles, and increasing the power supply. This was done to enable the utility to restore power more rapidly {{in the case of a}} massive ice striking Quebec again. Hydro-Québec has stated that it is better-prepared to handle an ice storm with the same magnitude as the one of 1998.|$|E
5|$|Emergency {{management}} {{officials in}} Fredericton {{stated that it}} could be years before the city fully recovered from the storm. Power restoration in the province reached over 99 percent on July16 with only 750customers still out. However, a thunderstorm that evening revealed the weak nature of <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>grid</b> as outages jumped back over 4,000. The following week, Energy Minister Craig Leonard rebutted claims that a public review of NB Power was necessary, despite the longevity and severity of the power outages. New Brunswick's Liberal and Green parties both supported an independent review of the company, while Leonard claimed only an internal review was necessary. The total cost to restore and repair damage to <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>grid</b> wrought by the storm amounted to C$8.4million (US$7.5million). This ranked it as the second-costliest event for Nova Scotia Power from a tropical cyclone, only behind Hurricane Juan. New Brunswick Power reported even greater losses from Arthur with damage amounting to C$23million (US$20.1million). This marked the costliest disaster in the company's history, surpassing the December 2013 ice storm. In light of the severe damage, NB Power allocated an extra C$5.1million (US$4.5million) for tree trimming during the 2014-2014 fiscal year.|$|E

30|$|In current practice, flow-based {{simulations}} play {{an essential}} role in the security analysis of <b>power</b> <b>grids.</b> Given <b>the</b> generation and demand profiles, the steady-state analyses estimate <b>the</b> operation of <b>power</b> <b>grids.</b> Additionally, many countries require that <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>grids</b> should withstand <b>the</b> scheduled and unscheduled outages of its most critical lines or other components. In these contingency analyses, the component outages are also simulated to determine whether <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>grids</b> can still function properly under the failure and consequent loss of an element. However, as <b>power</b> <b>grids</b> grow in size and get more complex, the number of contingencies increases significantly, increasing the associated computational time. This motivates research towards alternative techniques (Bompard et al. 2009; Gutierrez et al. 2013; Hines et al. 2010 a).|$|R

5|$|Plug-in {{electric}} vehicles offer users {{the opportunity to}} sell electricity stored in their batteries back to <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>grid,</b> thereby helping utilities to operate more efficiently {{in the management of}} their demand peaks. A vehicle-to-grid (V2G) system would take advantage of the fact that most vehicles are parked an average of 95 percent of the time. During such idle times the electricity stored in the batteries could be transferred from the PEV to the power lines and back to the grid. In the U.S this transfer back to the grid have an estimated value to the utilities of up to $4,000 per year per car. In a V2G system it would also be expected that battery electric (BEVs) and plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) would have the capability to communicate automatically with <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>grid</b> to sell demand response services by either delivering electricity into the grid or by throttling their charging rate.|$|E
5|$|Accordingly, {{protective}} measures {{were taken in}} response. To save the transformers and other electrical equipment, <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>grid</b> {{was taken out of}} commission, as circuit breakers tripped all over Quebec and shut off the power. Within less than 90 seconds, this wave of breaking circuits left the entire transmission grid out of service. The collapsed power grid left six million people and the rest of Quebec without electricity for hours on a very cold night. Even though the blackout lasted around nine hours for most places, some locations were in the dark for days. This geomagnetic storm caused about C$10 million in damage to Hydro-Québec and tens of millions to the customers of the utility.|$|E

5|$|At 2:44 am EST on March 13, 1989, {{a severe}} {{geomagnetic}} storm, {{due to a}} coronal mass ejection from the Sun, struck Earth. Fluctuations within the magnetic field of the storm caused geomagnetically induced currents (GICs) to flow through Quebec's power lines, which are direct current, instead of the alternating current carried by the power lines. The insulating nature of the Canadian Shield igneous rock directed the GICs to the power lines. The conductors then forwarded this current to sensitive electrical transformers, which require a certain voltage amplitude and frequency to function properly. Although most GICs are relatively feeble, the nature of those currents destabilized the voltage of <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>grid</b> and current spikes erupted everywhere.|$|E

Although damage occurred at Vaitau School, it was utilized as an evacuation shelter. The primary school and college in Araura also suffered damage. The island's electrically run water supply was substantially effected. A total of 568homes lost access to clean water, with many waters tanks damaged or destroyed. Aitutaki's only hospital fared well through the storm, with some roof damage and flooded rooms. Infrastructural losses totaled to NZ$2.3million (US$1.6million), mainly stemming from <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>grid.</b> The agricultural sector sustained extensive damage, amounting to US$1.5million, with some crops experiencing a total loss. The severity of damage raised concerns about food security {{in the months after}} the storm. Particularly hard-hit was the mango crop, which was to be harvested two weeks after Pat struck. Approximately 60–75percent of the coconut trees and 75percent of java plum, mango, and kapok trees sustained damage. Most trees had at least one branch torn off and in most cases, multiple branches. Additionally, the blue lorikeet (Vini peruviana), a bird native to French Polynesia and the Cook Islands, population suffered dramatic losses due to the storm, with the population on Aitutaki dropping by more than 50percent.|$|E

5|$|Similar issues {{occurred}} in New Brunswick where 18,000customers remained without power through July11. More than 310crews remained deployed throughout the province with electricity {{expected to be}} fully restored by the following week. Costs to repair <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>grid</b> were estimated in excess of C$12million (US$11.1million). There was criticism that New Brunswick Power did not appropriately prepare for the storm and actually requested assistance from other public power companies and private contractors after the storm had struck. Two public buildings in Fredericton were utilized as recharging centers for residents to charge their phones and shower. An estimated 6,000people took advantage of this through July10. Shaved ice was later distributed from the Grant-Harvey Centre in the city while several waste disposal sites were opened for residents {{to get rid of}} spoiled food from power outages. Gaëtan Thomas, {{president and chief executive officer}} of NB Power, likened the effects of Arthur in the region to Hurricane Katrina along the United States Gulf Coast in August2005. He referenced that during Katrina, 50 percent of the affected region lost power, while in the wake of Arthur 57 percent of New Brunswick was in the dark over a similar geographic area. Earlier cuts to the company's tree-trimming budget were cited as a possible cause in the scale of damage. As such, their budget for trimming in 2015 was increased from C$6million to C$8million.|$|E

Private companies and other utilities from other parts of Canada and the United States were sent in to help Hydro-Québec undertake this massive restoration task, but these efforts were complicated by the widespread damage of <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>grid.</b> Blackouts in some areas lasted for 33 days, and 90% of those affected by the blackout had no power for more than seven days. Although power was fully restored to all locations in Quebec by February 8, 1998, it wasn't until mid-March that the power facilities were back in service. By then, much social and economic damage had occurred, such as ruined food and deaths resulting from lack of electric heating.|$|E

30|$|In this paper, we took {{a network}} science {{approach}} to investigate <b>the</b> vulnerability of <b>power</b> <b>grids</b> to malicious targeted attacks. First, we presented two different graph models for power grids: simple and weighted graphs. Subsequently, using these graph models, we ranked the importance of each node according to the standard and the extended centrality metrics that {{take into account the}} electrical properties of the grids such as the admittance of the transmission lines and the flow allocation according to <b>the</b> DC <b>power</b> flow equations. Via case studies in both real-world and test <b>power</b> <b>grids,</b> we show that <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>grids</b> are highly vulnerable to targeted attacks: sequentially removing the nodes with the highest centrality is a good strategy to fragment <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>grids,</b> and to maximally decrease its operational performance. In almost all <b>power</b> <b>grids</b> in our case study, removing approximately 15 % of the nodes according to the flow betweenness centrality destroys the network almost completely. Grid operators can use the proposed methodology to analyse the current vulnerability of their network to targeted attacks and to take necessary measures by protecting the important nodes in their networks.|$|R
