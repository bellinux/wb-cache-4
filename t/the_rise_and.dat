5|$|Before {{entering}} production, Kill the Irishman had {{a troubled}} development stage that lasted over a decade. Production commenced in 2009, with filming {{taking place in}} and around Detroit. The film chronicles <b>the</b> <b>rise</b> <b>and</b> fall of Danny Greene. He worked as a longshoreman in the Cleveland docks, until being chosen to serve as interim president in 1961. In 1964, {{he was convicted of}} embezzling $11,500 of the union's funds. After his conviction, Greene rose through the criminal underworld in Cleveland, and waged war on the Mafia for control of the city. After many failed attempts, Greene was assassinated on October 6, 1977 by contract killer Ray Ferritto. His death ultimately led to the demise of the Cleveland Mafia.|$|E
5|$|Development for {{the film}} {{initially}} began in 2000, when Universal Pictures and Imagine Entertainment purchased the rights to a New York magazine story about <b>the</b> <b>rise</b> <b>and</b> fall of Lucas. Two years later, screenwriter Steven Zaillian introduced a 170-page scriptment to Scott. Original production plans were to commence in Toronto for budget purposes; however, production eventually relocated permanently to New York City. Because of the film's rising budget Universal canceled production in 2004. After negotiations with Terry George, it was later revived with Scott at the helm in March 2005. Principal photography commenced {{over a period of}} five months from July to December 2006; filming took place throughout New York City and concluded in Thailand.|$|E
5|$|Frogs {{are valued}} as food by humans and also have many {{cultural}} roles in literature, symbolism and religion. Frog populations have declined significantly since the 1950s. More than {{one third of}} species {{are considered to be}} threatened with extinction and over one hundred and twenty are believed to have become extinct since the 1980s. The number of malformations among frogs is on <b>the</b> <b>rise</b> <b>and</b> an emerging fungal disease, chytridiomycosis, has spread around the world. Conservation biologists are working to understand the causes of these problems and to resolve them.|$|E

5|$|In 1827, he {{published}} two volumes of Personal Sketches of His Own Times. In 1830, by an address from both Houses of Parliament, he {{was removed from}} the Bench, in consequence of well-proven misappropriation of public moneys. The third volume of Personal Sketches appeared in 1833 as did the delayed volume of his Historic Memoirs. This book was subsequently reproduced in a cheaper form as <b>The</b> <b>Rise</b> <b>and</b> Fall of the Irish Nation. His works are interesting, racy, and valuable – although his statements of fact cannot always be depended on – containing much of personal incident, related in a fascinating style. He died at Versailles on 8 April 1834.|$|E
5|$|Innis {{examined}} <b>the</b> <b>rise</b> <b>and</b> fall {{of ancient}} empires {{as a way}} of tracing the effects of communications media. He looked at media that led to the growth of an empire; those that sustained it during its periods of success, and then, the communications changes that hastened an empire's collapse. He tried to show that media 'biases' toward time or space affected the complex interrelationships needed to sustain an empire. These interrelationships included the partnership between the knowledge (and ideas) necessary to create and maintain an empire, and the power (or force) required to expand and defend it. For Innis, the interplay between knowledge and power was always a crucial factor in understanding empire.|$|E
5|$|Jerusalem is {{recognized}} as a sacred site in Islam. Though the Quran does not mention Jerusalem by name, it has been understood by Islamic scholars since the earliest times that many passages in the Quran refer to Jerusalem. Jerusalem is also mentioned {{many times in the}} hadith. Some academics attribute the holiness of Jerusalem to <b>the</b> <b>rise</b> <b>and</b> expansion of a certain type of literary genre, known as al-Fadhail or history of cities. The Fadhail of Jerusalem inspired Muslims, especially during the Umayyad period, to embellish the sanctity of the city beyond its status in the holy texts. Others point to the political motives of the Umayyad dynasty which led to the sanctification of Jerusalem in Islam.|$|E
