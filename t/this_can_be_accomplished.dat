5|$|Analog {{computers}} {{work directly}} with physical quantities, so their addition mechanisms {{depend on the}} form of the addends. A mechanical adder might represent two addends as the positions of sliding blocks, in which case they can be added with an averaging lever. If the addends are the rotation speeds of two shafts, they can be added with a differential. A hydraulic adder can add the pressures in two chambers by exploiting Newton's second law to balance forces on an assembly of pistons. The most common situation for a general-purpose analog computer is to add two voltages (referenced to ground); <b>this</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>accomplished</b> roughly with a resistor network, but a better design exploits an operational amplifier.|$|E
5|$|While {{the initial}} steer torque and steer angle are both {{opposite}} the desired turn direction, {{this may not}} be the case to maintain a steady-state turn. The sustained steer angle is usually in the same direction as the turn, but may remain opposite to the direction of the turn, especially at high speeds. The sustained steer torque required to maintain that steer angle is usually opposite the turn direction. The actual magnitude and orientation of both the sustained steer angle and sustained steer torque of a particular bike in a particular turn depend on forward speed, bike geometry, tire properties, and combined bike and rider mass distribution. Once in a turn, the radius can only be changed with an appropriate change in lean angle, and <b>this</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>accomplished</b> by additional countersteering out of the turn to increase lean and decrease radius, then into the turn to decrease lean and increase radius. To exit the turn, the bike must again countersteer, momentarily steering more into the turn in order to decrease the radius, thus increasing inertial forces, and thereby decreasing the angle of lean.|$|E

Geometallurgy combines the geologic sciences with extractive metallurgy and mining.|$|E
25|$|First and foremost, {{the best}} {{protection}} against piracy {{is simply to}} avoid encountering them. <b>This</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>accomplished</b> by using tools such as radar, or by using specialised systems that use shorter wavelengths (as small boats are not always picked up by radar). An example of a specialised system is WatchStander.|$|E
25|$|The {{detection}} of many antigens can be dramatically improved by antigen retrieval methods that act by breaking {{some of the}} protein cross-links formed by fixation to uncover hidden antigenic sites. <b>This</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>accomplished</b> by heating for varying lengths of times (heat induced epitope retrieval or HIER) or using enzyme digestion (proteolytic induced epitope retrieval or PIER).|$|E

Multiple lines are often used, and outriggers can be used to spread the lines more widely and reduce their chances of tangling. Downriggers can also be used to keep the lures or baits trailing at a desired depth.|$|E
25|$|Creatine {{monohydrate}} {{is regarded}} as a necessity by most bodybuilders. Creatine monohydrate is the most cost-effective dietary supplement in terms of muscle size and strength gains. … There is no preferred creatine supplement, but it is believed that creatine works best when it is consumed with simple carbohydrates. <b>This</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>accomplished</b> by mixing powdered creatine with grape juice, lemonade, or many high glycemic index drinks.|$|E
25|$|Trephination {{involves}} an intentional and planned operation to open or bore into the skull on a live subject, using tools {{specifically designed for}} the purpose. <b>This</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>accomplished</b> by several techniques, such as drilling, incising and abrasion, {{or some combination of}} these.

25|$|Electromyography (EMG) is {{a method}} of {{detecting}} the electrical activity that occurs when muscles are activated, thus determining which muscles an animal uses for a given movement. <b>This</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>accomplished</b> either by surface electrodes (usually in large animals) or implanted electrodes (often wires thinner than a human hair). Furthermore, the intensity of electrical activity can correlate {{to the level of}} muscle activity, with greater activity implying (though not definitively showing) greater force.|$|E
25|$|As a {{critical}} component of restoring native riparian communities, restoration practitioners often have to remove invasive species and prevent them from reestablishing. <b>This</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>accomplished</b> through herbicide application, mechanical removal, etc. When restoration is to be done on long stretches of rivers and streams, it is often useful to begin the project upstream and work downstream so that propagules from exotic species upstream will not hamper restoration attempts. Ensuring the establishment of native species is considered vital in preventing future colonizations of exotic plants.|$|E

50|$|In {{computer}} vision and computer graphics, 4D reconstruction {{is the process}} of capturing the shape and appearance of real objects along a temporal dimension. <b>This</b> process <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>accomplished</b> either by active or passive methods and is also referred to as non-rigid or spatio-temporal reconstruction.|$|R
25|$|In other cases, {{it may be}} {{desirable}} to maintain some degree of compatibility with simple AM receivers, while still reducing the signal's bandwidth. <b>This</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>accomplished</b> by transmitting single-sideband with a normal or slightly reduced carrier. This mode is called compatible (or full-carrier) SSB or amplitude modulation equivalent (AME). In typical AME systems, harmonic distortion can reach 25%, and intermodulation distortion can be much higher than normal, but minimizing distortion in receivers with envelope detectors is generally considered less important than allowing them to produce intelligible audio.|$|E
25|$|Some aquarists modify water's alkalinity, hardness, or {{dissolved}} {{content of}} organics and gases, before adding {{it to their}} aquaria. <b>This</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>accomplished</b> by additives, such as sodium bicarbonate, to raise pH. Some aquarists filter or purify their water through deionization or reverse osmosis prior to using it. In contrast, public aquaria with large water needs often locate themselves near a natural water source (such as a river, lake, or ocean) to reduce the level of treatment. Some hobbyists use an algae scrubber to filter the water naturally.|$|E
25|$|The {{difficulty}} lies {{in creating}} schemes {{that are still}} secure, but do not require all n shares. For example, imagine that the Board of Directors of a company would like to protect their secret formula.

25|$|The {{treatment}} {{goal for}} individuals affected with OTC deficiency is {{the avoidance of}} hyperammonemia. <b>This</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>accomplished</b> through a strictly controlled low-protein diet, as well as preventative treatment with nitrogen scavenging agents such as sodium benzoate. The goal is to minimize the nitrogen intake while allowing waste nitrogen to be excreted by alternate pathways. Arginine is typically supplemented as well, {{in an effort to}} improve the overall function of the urea cycle. If a hyperammonemic episode occurs, the aim of treatment is to reduce the individual's ammonia levels as soon as possible. In extreme cases, this can involve hemodialysis.|$|E
25|$|When {{analyzing}} {{an inverse}} problem, obtaining a maximum likelihood model {{is usually not}} sufficient, as we normally also wish to have information on the resolution power of the data. In the general case {{we may have a}} large number of model parameters, and an inspection of the marginal probability densities of interest may be impractical, or even useless. But it is possible to pseudorandomly generate a large collection of models according to the posterior probability distribution and to analyze and display the models {{in such a way that}} information on the relative likelihoods of model properties is conveyed to the spectator. <b>This</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>accomplished</b> by means of an efficient Monte Carlo method, even in cases where no explicit formula for the a priori distribution is available.|$|E
25|$|There are {{instances}} where {{the use of}} a PHR would be beneficial to patients and may, therefore, override privacy concerns. Stage 1 of meaningful use of certified EHR systems requires that practices provide at least 50 percent of their patients with a copy of their health records upon request. While <b>this</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>accomplished</b> through a patient portal, this function can also be part of a larger system such as Kaiser Permanente's My Health Manager—a PHR that is integrated into the health system's patient portal. By June 2012, 3.9 million Kaiser members were enrolled in this program. For the first half of 2012, members viewed 2.5 million lab results, sent 1 million e-mails to physicians, and scheduled 230,000 appointments monthly, demonstrating ease of use and convenience.|$|E
