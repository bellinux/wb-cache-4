40|$|The July 2004 Agriculture Framework is {{the basis}} for {{negotiations}} of modalities in agriculture in the WTO. The significant new ideas on domestic support include an Overall Reduction applying to the sum of Total Aggregate Measurement of Support (<b>Total</b> <b>AMS),</b> de minimis AMSs, and blue box payments (i. e., all non-green support), tiered harmonizing reductions of overall distorting support and <b>Total</b> <b>AMS,</b> caps on product-specific AMSs, cap on and criteria for blue box payments, lower de minimis, and review of green box criteria. This paper assesses how several of these provisions might constrain the future (2014) distorting domestic support of USA, EU, Japan, Canada, Brazil, and China. Future support is projected, paying particular attention to U. S. and EU support. The analysis uses a hypothetical 90 - 80 - 70 - 60 reduction scenario to estimate the remaining entitlements to support and calculates the cuts the six Members can accommodate without affecting projected future support. It also estimates the maximum support that can be used within the commitments, considering that simply summing the <b>Total</b> <b>AMS</b> commitment and all de minimis allowances overestimates the amount of support that can be provided (a product's AMS can not at the same time be de minimis and counted in Current <b>Total</b> <b>AMS).</b> The six Members can accommodate large cuts in commitments on overall distorting support and <b>Total</b> <b>AMS.</b> A cut of 75 percent would not bite into the U. S. future support and a 79 percent cut would not constrain future EU- 15 support. Large cuts would not force the other four Members to reduce support from what they have notified or provided in recent years. Large cuts will prevent reversals of support reductions. Harmonizing tiered cuts can effectively address the support entitlements of the large subsidizers. Altogether the provisions of the 2004 Framework allow for substantial reductions in distorting support, and the Overall Reduction can be particularly effective. The reduction scenario examined for the six Members reduces their combined usable entitlements to all distorting support by about half (from $ 301 bill. in the base period to $ 148 bill. in 2014) when applied to <b>Total</b> <b>AMS,</b> de minimis, and blue entitlement separately. Applying also the Overall Reduction reduces the combined usable entitlements by a further $ 84 bill., bringing their allowed distorting support down to $ 65 bill. However, this requires that Members agree to sizeable percentage cuts in the commitments on Overall Reduction and on <b>Total</b> <b>AMS.</b> Agricultural and Food Policy, International Relations/Trade,...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} i. m. injection of testosterone undecanoate 1000 mg over 12 months on the Aging Male Symptom (AMS) scale scores in men with testosterone deficiency syndrome (TDS). PATIENTS AND METHODS A total of 120 men > 40 years old with TDS (total testosterone = 27) were randomized into i. m. injection of either placebo or testosterone undecanoate 1000 mg. In all, 56 and 58 participants from the active treatment and placebo groups, respectively completed the study. An i. m. injection of either placebo or testosterone undecanoate 1000 mg was given at weeks 0, 6, 18, 30 and 48. Self-administered AMS questionnaires were completed at weeks 0, week 18 and week 48. RESULTS Improvement in the <b>total</b> <b>AMS</b> score was significantly greater in the treatment group than {{in the placebo group}} (F: 4. 576, P = 0. 017) over the 48 -week period. The mean (SD) <b>total</b> <b>AMS</b> score was 38. 46 (11. 85) at baseline and 33. 59 (1. 69) at 48 weeks for the placebo group, and 41. 73 (12. 73) at baseline and 32. 61 (9. 67) at 48 weeks for the treatment group. The mean change in the <b>total</b> <b>AMS</b> score was - 12. 6 in the placebo group and - 21. 9 in the treatment group. The mean psychological and somatovegetative domain scores decreased significantly more in the treatment group than in the placebo group (- 2. 8 vs - 1. 2, P = 0. 03; and - 3. 2 vs - 1. 8, P = 0. 016). The difference in change between the randomized groups for the sexual domain scores followed the same trend, though the difference was not significant.

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{estimate}} the economic costs of avoidable mortality (AM) in Colombia {{during the period}} 1998 to 2011, with the human capital perspective valuing the productivity lost. MethodsThe information of cases of avoidable death was identified from the Colombian official general mortality database, and we estimated the potential productivity years of life lost, assuming a productive life span between 18 years and 57 years and 18 years and 62 years in women and men, respectively. Two scenarios were built: lower loss with the minimum wage, and higher loss with the per capita gross domestic product. Total costs for the period were reported by sex and health event. Average cost per 1000 people was also estimated. All costs were adjusted and reported in 2012 US dollars. ResultsSixty-eight percent of the <b>total</b> <b>AM</b> in Colombia during the period 1998 to 2011 occurred during or before the productivity age. The <b>total</b> <b>AM</b> costs were estimated to range between US $ 80. 5 million and US $ 150. 4 million. Higher costs of AM were incurred in men. Events from the injuries group caused the higher productivity lost. ConclusionsAll the avoidable deaths in Colombia have a huge economic impact from the productivity lost perspective, equivalent to between 1. 6 % and 3. 0 % of the annual gross domestic product.

40|$|International audienceINTRODUCTION: Detection of {{androgen}} deficiency is at least, {{based on}} specific questionnaires, defined by sexual, psychological, and somatic variables. Their relationships with sexual hormone levels are poorly understood. AIM: To assess the Aging Male Symptoms (AMS) score and sex hormone levels in normal and complaining men {{in order to}} define {{the relationship between the}} key parameters related to androgen deficiency. METHODS: Nine hundred and three men were interviewed via phone by a trained interviewer who completed the questionnaire; 539 men consulting for a checkup in a health center and 471 complaining men, who completed the AMS scale in clinical setting, were selected, after excluding subjects with major and/or chronic diseases, endocrine disorders, psychological dysfunctions, and metabolic syndrome. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: <b>Total</b> <b>AMS</b> score and psychological, somatic and sexual subscores, as a function of age. RESULTS: The AMS questionnaires the were completed in a clinical setting or via calling-up line were comparable. In both cases, <b>total</b> <b>AMS</b> scores and subscores were significantly dependent of age and were correlated to income. In normal men, the only two parameters that significantly changed with age were the AMS sexual subscore and bioavailable testosterone (BT). Complaining men aged more than 50 years old had a significantly higher <b>total</b> <b>AMS</b> scores, subscores, and BT level than normal men up to 60 years old, and these differences weakened with increasing age. In normal and complaining men, whatever the AMS sexual subscore, any variation in testosterone (T) and BT levels was observed. CONCLUSIONS: The AMS scale could be defined as a screening test for androgen deficiency symptoms in men between 50 and 65 years of age. The sexual AMS subscore and BT level are the key variables to identify those symptoms; the severity of sexual symptoms can not be explained by a BT level decrease...|$|E
40|$|Proposals on {{domestic}} support were submitted in the WTO agriculture negotiations by the USA, the EU, and the G- 20 in October 2005, {{based on the}} 2004 Framework agreement. This paper pays attention to the de minimis rules and the resulting de minimis allowances and projects future (2014) distorting support for the USA and the EU- 15. It calculates the constraints resulting from projected values of production combined with the U. S., EU and G- 20 proposals and compares their effectiveness in constraining components of distorting support and the projected future applied support. The de minimis rules {{make a difference in}} estimating how much distorting support can be provided in the future. Under the U. S. proposal the Overall commitment does not constrain either the USA or the EU. Under the EU and especially the G- 20 proposals the Overall commitment constrains distorting support to be less than the sum of the cap on blue and the maximum usable components. This maximum is smaller than the sum of the commitment on Total Aggregate Measurement of Support (AMS) and the de minimis allowances. The U. S. proposal constrains only one component (Current <b>Total</b> <b>AMS)</b> and this only for the EU. The EU proposal does not constrain projected future applied support in either the USA or the EU. The G- 20 proposal constrains the future Current <b>Total</b> <b>AMS</b> for both the USA and the EU. The G- 20 proposal constrains projected future Overall distorting support for the EU but not for the USA. Agricultural and Food Policy, International Relations/Trade,...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate the effect of testosterone replacement treatment (TRT) in testosterone deficiency syndrome (TDS) patients with metabolic syndrome. Materials and Methods: We reviewed the data of 200 men who were diagnosed with TDS and were undergoing TRT between August 2006 and August 2009. The 200 patients were divided into two groups (group 1 : 71 patients with metabolic syndrome, group 2 : 129 patients without metabolic syndrome) depending on metabolic syndrome, which was diagnosed according to the NCEP III criteria for Asians. Age, BMI (body mass index), waist circumference, serologic tests, AMS (the Aging Males ' Symptoms scale), and IIEF (International Index of Erectile Function) were measured. Results: In group 1, waist circumference and fasting glucose were significantly decreased; hemoglobin and total testosterone were increased; and the somatovegetative scale score of the AMS, the <b>total</b> <b>AMS</b> score, the erectile function score of the IIEF, the overall satisfaction score of the IIEF, and the total IIEF score were significantly improved after TRT.

40|$|Objective : To {{study the}} {{antimicrobial}} (AM) consumption, record the AM sensitivity pattern, and evaluate impact of "Reserve AM indent form" {{in the intensive}} care unit (ICU). Materials and Methods : The study was carried out in medical ICU over 4 months period at a tertiary care hospital. AM consumption was determined by defined daily dose (DDD) per 100 bed days for each month for consecutive 4 months. The average <b>total</b> <b>AM</b> consumption was calculated. The laboratory samples were processed, and the sensitivity pattern was determined. Some of the newer AM were categorised as "Reserve" and an indent form was made mandatory to be filled up prior to prescription. Results : The <b>total</b> <b>AM</b> consumption was 232 per 100 bed days. The commonly used AM were penicillin with b-lactamase inhibitor (21 &#x 0025;) followed by antifungal drugs (13. 4 &#x 0025;), cephalosporins and macrolides (11. 7 &#x 0025;) each. The most common organism isolated was Acinetobacter (26. 1 &#x 0025;) followed by Candida (23. 8 &#x 0025;) and Pseudomonas (21. 4 &#x 0025;). The average occupancy index was 0. 53, and the average duration of ICU stay was 6 days. The consumption of carbapenems (new AM) and antifungals decreased from 18. 8 / 100 to 10. 6 / 100 and 56. 1 / 100 to 22. 1 / 100 bed days, respectively, after the introduction of indent form. Conclusion : The "Reserve AM indent form" was helpful in reducing the AM consumption during the study period.

40|$|Maize (Zea mays L.) is an {{important}} crop in central Thailand where fallow is widely practiced and farmers are interested in crop rotation and beneficial soil biota. A pot experiment using a Typic Paleustult (topsoil + subsoil) from the National Corn and Sorghum Research Centre, Nakhonratchasima Province, Thailand was undertaken over three successive crops to evaluate effects of agronomic practices on populations of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi and to determine whether reintroduction of a local Glomus was beneficial to maintain maize yield. The three crops and their treatments were: (1) preceding crop: maize grown in all pots; (2) subexperiment 1 : agronomic practices [maize, fallow +/- soil disturbance, fallow with solarization, non-AM host (cabbage) ]; and (3) subexperiment 2 : maize +/- Glomus sp. 3 at three rates of P fertilization (0, 33, 92 kg P ha(- 1)). The AM-fungal community was established under the preceding crop. In subexperiment 1, the three fallow treatments decreased (30 %- 40 %) the <b>total</b> <b>AM</b> spore number in the topsoil whereas there was no change under maize or cabbage. Glomus, the dominant genus, showed sensitivity to fallow. In subexperiment 2, inoculation with Glomus sp. 3 enhanced <b>total</b> <b>AM</b> spore number and root colonization when applied following the three fallow treatments.

40|$|The Doha Development Round {{of trade}} {{negotiations}} in the WTO aims to achieve substantial reductions in trade-distorting domestic support. The Harbinson draft modalities were tabled in March 2003, followed by less detailed draft framework texts for modalities {{before and during}} the Cancún meeting in September 2003. The framework texts introduce new provisions not present in the Harbinson modalities or in earlier proposals, modify some provisions and eliminate others. The Harbinson modalities and the five 2003 framework texts (EC-US, del Castillo, G- 21, Derbez, and G- 21) show differences and similarities and show how certain provisions evolved over time in, e. g., the green box, the blue and revised blue box, deminimis, AMS and <b>Total</b> <b>AMS</b> commitments, and the sum of overall support. To assess the various provisions consistent assumptions are adopted for the numerical values of reductions and other parameters, which remain subject to negotiations. The resulting entitlements to provide support, after full implementation, are assessed for USA, the EU, Japan, Canada and Brazil. This shows the significance of tiered reduction commitments of <b>Total</b> <b>AMS,</b> as opposed to equal reductions for all. It also shows the significance of the size of any caps on the amounts exempted as de minimis or as blue box payments. This is particularly the case if the set of policies qualifying as exempt is made larger and perhaps more distorting by removing the production-limiting condition on blue box payments. Capping product-specific AMS amounts based on past amounts would lock in existing differences between those who provide high support to many individual products and those who provide low support to individual products. The "maximum distorting support" (MDS) is calculated for the five Members under the provisions of each of the six texts. The EC-US draft framework would allow about the same MDS as the Harbinson modalities, while the del Castillo and Derbez frameworks would result in a twenty percent reduction from Harbinson. The G- 20 framework (of September 9) would allow an MDS half as large as under Harbinson, and the G- 21 framework (September 14) would yield an MDS equal to two-thirds of Harbinson's. Overall the provisions of the draft texts are found to be dauntingly complex, with several constraints operating at the same time. The largest possible reduction of <b>Total</b> <b>AMS,</b> combined with better rules on exemptions, could be effective in achieving the substantial reduction of trade-distorting support. The overall reduction of all non-green support without exemptions could also, if the reduction is large enough, effectively achieve that substantial reduction articulated in the Doha objective on domestic support.

Economic analysis often overlooks the agreement's legally important distinctions. Few domestic support issues lead to dispute settlement proceedings. The Doha negotiations would result in more constraints on domestic support than the sole commitment on Total Aggregate Measurement of Support (AMS) in the present agreement: ceilings on overall trade-distorting support and blue box payments, and also product-specific caps. Some 18 members would reduce their <b>Total</b> <b>AMS</b> commitments, and 25 would reduce the de minimis percentages. Most members would not reduce their constraints at all or only little.

40|$|This study {{analyzed}} {{the cost to}} U. S. cotton producers of two policy alternatives under which the U. S. seeks to cut its <b>total</b> <b>AMS</b> payments for cotton by 60 %. We considered two scenarios; the U. S. decides to act unilaterally versus conducting the policy initiative along with multilateral tariff and subsidy eliminations from the Rest of the World. The study found a 12 % cut in target price and 8 % cut in loan rate are necessary to reach the 60 % AMS targeted reduction under the unilateral scenario. In that regards, U. S. net farm income decreases considerably despite an appreciation of U. S. farm price. Under a multilateral trade liberalization from the Rest of the World, a 9 % cut in the loan rate and 4 % in loan rate are enough to reach the AMS reduction threshold. The study found there is 20 % chance that net farm income would appreciate and 80 % chance that it would decline. However, the decline is less severe compared to the situation where the U.

Seedlings of P. lanceolata, colonized by one or other of the fungal symbionts, and nonmycorrhizal controls, were grown in mesh bags placed in pots containing pH-buffered sand (pH around 5 or 6).

The ferrimagnetic sub-fabric is generally insignificant in these rocks, contributing less than 10 % to the <b>total</b> <b>AMS.</b> AMS results for both the separated diamagnetic and paramagnetic subfabrics are consistent with the regional shear movement in the late-stage formation of the Helvetic nappes, as seen in the Morcles nappe, whose inverted limb indicate shear displacement towards the northwest. The diamagnetic anisotropy correlates well quantitatively with the calculated magnetic anisotropy based on the calcite texture. There is a gradational change in the degree of anisotropy related to the strain gradient along the shear zone. A more complex magnetic fabric, resulting from partial overprinting due to displacement along the Simplon–Rhône fault, is evident at one site near the root zone of the nappe. Partial overprinting of the magnetic fabric appears to have taken place in two locations farther up the shear zone as well. This late phase deformation is associated with recent exhumation of the Mont Blanc and Belledonne external massifs and orogen parallel extension, and is reflected by the AMS. Rocks with bulk susceptibility ∼ 0 SI, and simple mineral compositions are ideal for low temperature high-field torque, as this method helps to enhance the paramagnetic susceptibility and anisotropy, which may otherwise be masked by the mixed magnetic contributions of the composite magnetic fabric...|$|E

We present key elements and an overview of our analytical framework, assumptions of a baseline scenario, and some analytical results and observations arising from our analysis. The baseline scenario extends the classification of programs in WTO notifications to 2015. The framework consists of 65 spreadsheets, which are grouped into 4 analytical stages: calculation of program estimates by commodity; calculation of product-specific aggregate measurement of support by commodity; estimates of major U.

The main results of the baseline scenario suggest that the United States {{would be able to}} maintain its Uruguay Round commitments under relatively optimistic USDA Baseline assumptions. Because the U. S. overall value of production is projected to increase by almost 40 % from 2002 to 2015, de minimis allowances will rise to US$ 26 billion by 2015.

During laboratory chamber photooxidation experiments of diiodomethane (CH 2 I 2), particle nucleation was observed at CH 2 I 2 concentrations down to 15 ppt, which is comparable to the total gas-phase iodine species measured at coastal areas. Iodine oxides and oxyacids were observed in the aerosol mass spectra obtained by the AMS, consistent with the known gas-phase chemistry. Airborne measurements by the AMS during the ACE-Asia field study revealed that the non-refractory submicron aerosols in the pollution layers of the boundary layer up to 3700 m were mainly composed of sulfate, ammonium, and organics. These pollution plumes originated primarily from urban and industrial areas of China and Korea. The laboratory chamber experiments of oxidation of cycloalkenes, terpenes, and m-xylene provided the opportunity to study the Secondary Organic Aerosol (SOA) forming potential, i. e., yield, and determine SOA effective density and chemical composition. Evidence of acid-catalyzed heterogeneous chemistry in the ozonolysis of a-pinene was observed since the <b>total</b> <b>AMS</b> organic mass during the experiments with acidic seed particles had a greater contribution of higher molecular weight fragments. The mixtures of SOA compounds produced from similar precursors studied resulted in broadly similar AMS mass spectra. Thus, fragmentation patterns observed for biogenic vs. anthropogenic SOA can be potentially useful in determining the sources of ambient SOA...|$|E
40|$|Constraints on form should {{determine}} how organisms diversify. Owing to {{competition for the}} limited space within the body, investment in adjacent structures may frequently represent an evolutionary compromise. For example, evolutionary trade-offs between eye size and jaw muscles in cichlid fish of the African great lakes are thought to represent a constructional constraint that influenced the diversification of these assemblages. To test the evolutionary independence of these structures in Lake Malawi cichlid fish, we measured {{the mass of the}} three major adductor mandibulae (AM) muscles and determined the eye volume in 41 species. Using both traditional and novel methodologies to control for resolved and unresolved phylogenetic relationships, we tested the evolutionary independence of these four structures. We found that evolutionary change in the AM muscles was positively correlated, suggesting that competition for space in the head has not influenced diversification among these jaw muscles. Furthermore, there was no negative relationship between change in <b>total</b> <b>AM</b> muscle mass and eye volume, indicating that there has been little effect of the evolution of eye size on AM evolution in Lake Malawi cichlids. The comparative approach used here should provide a robust method to test whether constructional constraints frequently limit phenotypic change in adaptive radiations...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Extracellular calcium {{transients}} were monitored with 2 mM tetramethylmurexide at low calcium (250 <b>AM</b> <b>total,</b> 130 <b>AM</b> free), {{and action}} potentials were monitored together with developed tension at normal calcium (1. 3 mM) during {{the production and}} decay of post-stimulatory potentiation in rabbit left atrial strips. At normal calcium, the contractile potentiation produced by a brief burst of 4 Hz stimulation is lost in three to five post-stimulatory excitations, which correlate with a negative staircase of the late action potential. At low calcium, stimulation at 4 Hz for 3 - 8 s results in a net extracellular calcium depletion of 5 - 15 AM. At the subsequent potentiated contraction (1 - 45 s rest), total extracellular calcium increases by 4 - 8 AM. The contractile response at a second excitation is greatly suppressed and results in little or no further calcium shift; the sequence can be repeated immediately thereafter. Reducing external sodium to 60 mM (sucrose replacement) enhances post-rest contractions, supresses the late action potential, nearly eliminates loss of contractility and net calcium efflux at post-rest excitations, and markedly reduce...|$|R
40|$|This paper reviews recent {{agricultural}} policy changes in China and presents estimates of domestic {{support for the}} period 1996 - 2005. A set of relevant alternative subsidy-definition scenarios and their effects on the calculated levels of support are analyzed, and a projection of domestic support through 2013 is presented. The paper concludes {{with a discussion of}} new WTO rules that may be negotiated in the Doha Round and their implications for China. Based on standard WTO subsidy calculation methods, our results indicated that China's domestic support for the period 1996 - 2005 has been well below the limits agreed at its WTO accession. The market price support (MPS) component of the aggregate measure of support (AMS) in China has been below zero, and this has dwarfed the relatively small but positive non-product specific AMS and led to a zero current <b>total</b> <b>AMS</b> after de minimis. China has no AMS commitments but can provide trade-distorting domestic support to agricultural producers up to 8. 5 percent of the value of production (or RMB 561 billion). Thus there appears to be substantial room for China to extend its amber box subsidy measures through heavy use of the de minimis provision. We project domestic support notifications through 2013 based on specified assumptions about domestic policies, including changes in administered prices and commodity program coverage. New rules potentially negotiated in the Doha Round are expected to provide more constraints on subsidies. Due to China's developing country status, with no AMS commitments under the Uruguay Round Agreement on Agriculture the impacts of these new constraints are shown to be limited, although our projections indicate that China may exceed its WTO commitment levels under certain price and commodity coverage scenarios.

40|$|International audienceBesides granites of the {{ilmenite}} series, {{in which}} the anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility (AMS) is mainly controlled by paramagnetic minerals, the AMS of igneous rocks is commonly interpreted {{as the result of}} the shape-preferred orientation of unequant ferromagnetic grains. In a few instances, the anisotropy due to the distribution of ferromagnetic grains, irrespective of their shape, has also been proposed as an important AMS source. Former analytical models that consider infinite geometry of identical and uniformly magnetized and coaxial particles confirm that shape fabric may be overcome by dipolar contributions if neighboring grains are close enough to each other to magnetically interact. On these bases we present and experimentally validate a two-grain macroscopic numerical model in which each grain carries its own magnetic anisotropy, volume, orientation and location in space. Compared with analytical predictions and available experiments, our results allow to list and quantify the factors that affect the effects of magnetic interactions. In particular, we discuss the effects of (i) the infinite geometry used in the analytical models, (ii) the intrinsic shape anisotropy of the grains, (iii) the relative orientation in space of the grains, and (iv) the spatial distribution of grains with a particular focus on the inter-grain distance distribution. Using documented case studies, these findings are summarized and discussed in the framework of the generalized <b>total</b> <b>AMS</b> tensor recently introduced by Cañon-Tapia (Cañon-Tapia, E., 2001. Factors affecting the relative importance of shape and distribution anisotropy in rocks: theory and experiments. Tectonophysics, 340, 117 – 131.). The most important result of our work is that analytical models far overestimate the role of magnetic interaction in rock fabric quantification. Considering natural rocks as an assemblage of interacting and non-interacting grains, and that the effects of interaction are reduced by (i) the finite geometry of the interacting clusters, (ii) the relative orientation between interacting grains, (iii) their heterogeneity in orientation, shape and bulk susceptibility, and (iv) their inter-distance distribution, we reconcile analytical models and experiments with real case studies that minimize the role of magnetic interaction onto the measured AMS. Limitations of our results are discussed and guidelines are provided for the use of AMS in geological interpretation of igneous rock fabrics where magnetic interactions are likely to occur...|$|E
40|$|The United States, Canada and the Cairns Group {{proposed}} disciplines on distorting domestic {{support in}} agriculture at the WTO Committee on Agriculture in July and September 2002. This paper assesses the key {{features of the}} 2002 proposals: green box provisions, blue box provisions, de minimis exemptions, {{the starting point for}} reductions, the nature of the reduction commitment, the depth of cuts, the implementation period for cuts, down payments, overall caps, and special and differential treatment of developing countries. The maximum distorting support (the sum of the maximum de minimis support and any entitlement to AMS or <b>Total</b> <b>AMS</b> that remains after reduction) is calculated for the United States, the European Union, Brazil, and Canada, based on projected values of production at the end point of implementation. The 2002 proposals of the United States, Canada and the Cairns Group are similar in seeking to reduce or eliminate blue box support and to reduce support over five years in developed countries. The proposal of the Cairns Group is found to be extremely ambitious, allowing no support other than green box support in developed countries, combined with a reduced scope for exempting support on green box grounds. Developing countries could still provide distorting support up to de minimis levels. Canada's proposal would also require the elimination of AMS entitlements but is less extreme in that all Members could provide deminimis support as under present rules. Canada's proposal would improve the classification of green box and non-product-specific support, make green box support immune to the threat of countervail, and cap the sum of amber, blue and some green support. The U. S. proposal is found to be only modestly ambitious, perpetuating Members' AMS entitlements, albeit at lower, more harmonized levels. No change is proposed in the rules for classifying support in the green box or as non-product-specific versus product-specific, which would continue to exempt large amounts from commitment. The Cairns Group proposal would extend considerable leeway to developing countries as special and differential treatment, while the Canadian and U. S. proposals seek to discipline distorting support wherever it is provided. Altogether, Canada's proposal would appear to be more practical and more equitable and hence perhaps more effective than the proposals of the Cairns Group and the United States in bringing about substantial reductions in trade-distorting domestic support.

Phytoremeditation of mine tailings provides the most cost-effective means of alleviating their pollutant effects. Research has shown that successful revegetation of mine tailings can be optimised by providing appropriate microbial symbionts for the plants. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) status of trees currently being used for phytoremediation trials of mine tailings in the Welkom gold fields, and to determine the AM fungal diversity of these sites. The Acacia spp. analysed were growing on rehabilitated gold and uranium mine tailings which had undergone different rehabilitation regimes. Planted acacia trees which had been inoculated with crude AM fungal inocula were present on one mine tailing site as compared to the second mine tailing site on which the acacias were naturally colonisers and the site had been ameliorated with garden refuse. Root and slime samples were collected in early spring and half if each initial sample was used immediately for colonisation analysis and to identify AM fungi through molecular analysis of the small subunit rRNS gene sequences; the other half of each sample was used to produce trap cultures which were used later for colonisation and molecular analysis. <b>Total</b> <b>AM</b> fungal colonisation of initial samples for planted acacies was 19...|$|R
40|$|This work {{presents}} {{a study on}} Ibe electrochemical behavior of actinides (An = Am and Pu) and lanthanides (Ln = La and Nd) onto solid aluminum cathodes in a molten LiCI-KCl eutectic at 733 K. Cyclic voltammetiy of these elements onto A! woridog electrode is carried out to estimate the reduction potentials of An and Ln and to predict the efficiency of an An:Ln separation by eleclrolysis. Results show that the reduction of Am 3 1, Pu 3, LaJ, and Nd 3 ions leads {{to the formation of}} An-Al or Ln-Al surface alloys. Moreover, the difference in reduction potentials between An and Ln elements was found to be larger than on the classical molten cadmium or bismuth electrodes. Pu:Nd and Am:Nd electroseparauons were carried out using Al foam as cathode and a plutonium rod as anode. Efficient and feradaic reduction of actinides was achieved at a cathodic potential preventing Nd coreduction. After electrolysis, a compact and adherent deposit covered the cathode surface, and scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray analysis of the deposit indicated the existence of Ai-Pu or mixed Am-Pu-Al alloys. Analysis of the dissolved Al cathodes, after electrolytic separation of Am from Nd, showed that 536 mg of An (94 of the <b>total</b> <b>Am</b> present in the initial salt phase) had been deposited compared to less than 3 mg Nd.
