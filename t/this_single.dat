5|$|Much work on hypercomplex {{numbers and}} group {{representations}} {{was carried out}} in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, but remained disparate. Noether united these results and gave the first general representation theory of groups and algebras. Briefly, Noether subsumed the structure theory of associative algebras and the representation theory of groups into a single arithmetic theory of modules and ideals in rings satisfying ascending chain conditions. <b>This</b> <b>single</b> work by Noether was of fundamental importance for the development of modern algebra.|$|E
5|$|Prior to 1989 {{there were}} four local trains in each {{direction}} from Oslo to Hønefoss; followed by on rush hour service each, but <b>this</b> <b>single</b> service has since been terminated; mainly due to quicker travel times by coaches. The Ringerike Line would allow the Oslo Commuter Rail once again to serve Ringerike; other places served usually have one hourly service, with additional services in rush hour. Reducing travel time from Hønefoss to Oslo to 30 minutes would probably cause larger population growth in Ringerike.|$|E

5|$|The King Charles Spaniel (also {{known as}} the English Toy Spaniel) is a small dog breed of the spaniel type. In 1903, the Kennel Club {{combined}} four separate toy spaniel breeds under <b>this</b> <b>single</b> title.

5|$|The Ninth Fort, {{begun in}} 1903, {{was the first}} of its kind in the Empire. The {{structure}} was a trapezoid, encompassing one infantry rampart, and was equipped with two armored watchtowers, electricity, and ventilation. The walls of its cannon casemates were covered with cork to reduce firing noise. The cost of <b>this</b> <b>single</b> fort was 850,000 rubles.|$|E
5|$|The Northwest Territory {{was formed}} by the Congress of the Confederation on July 13, 1787, and {{included}} all land between the Appalachia and the Mississippi River, the Great Lakes and the Ohio River. <b>This</b> <b>single</b> territory became the states of Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin, and eastern Minnesota. The Northwest Territory act had all the newly acquired territory surveyed according to The Land Ordinance of 1785 for future development by the United States.

5|$|Although the durian is not {{native to}} Thailand, {{the country is}} {{currently}} {{one of the major}} exporters of durians, growing 781,000 tonnes of the world's total harvest of 1,400,000 tonnes in 1999, 111,000 tonnes of which it exported to Taiwan, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore and Canada. Malaysia and Indonesia follow, both producing about 265,000 tonnes each. Of this, Malaysia exported 35,000 tonnes in 1999. Chantaburi in Thailand each year holds the World Durian Festival in early May. <b>This</b> <b>single</b> province is responsible for half of the durian production of Thailand. In the Philippines, the centre of durian production is the Davao Region. The Kadayawan Festival is an annual celebration featuring the durian in Davao City. Other places where durian farms are located include Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, India, the West Indies, Florida, Hawaii, Papua New Guinea, the Polynesian Islands, Madagascar, southern China (Hainan Island), northern Australia, and Singapore.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternate}} {{video was}} shot for the song's remix. It too {{was directed by}} Carey, and was shot in black and white. The shot of Carey in a beret that would become the cover for <b>this</b> <b>single</b> is {{a scene from the}} video. The video features cameo appearances by Da Brat and Xscape. It begins with Carey and the duo spending time recording the song in Carey's in-home studio. In the video, Carey is wearing a large white, straw hat and features long golden hair. As the trio finishes the song, scenes of Carey by her pool are shown, with cameos made by her dog, Jack. Brat and Xscape are seen poolside with Carey, playing cards and drinking beer, as the trio further bond and laugh. Towards the end of the video, scenes of the trio in the studio are shows, and intermingled with snippets of Carey walking inside her mansion, shared with then husband Tommy Mottola. The video ends with Carey and Brat bonding by the studio and pool.|$|E
5|$|Once all {{the tissue}} {{compartments}} have reached saturation {{for a given}} pressure and breathing mixture, continued exposure will not increase the gas loading of the tissues. From this point onwards the required decompression remains the same. If divers work and live at pressure for a long period, and are decompressed {{only at the end}} of the period, the risks associated with decompression are limited to <b>this</b> <b>single</b> exposure. This principle has led to the practice of saturation diving, and as there is only one decompression, and it is done in the relative safety and comfort of a saturation habitat, the decompression is done on a very conservative profile, minimising the risk of bubble formation, growth and the consequent injury to tissues. A consequence of these procedures is that saturation divers are more likely to suffer decompression sickness symptoms in the slowest tissues, whereas bounce divers are more likely to develop bubbles in faster tissues.|$|E

5|$|The Northwest Territory {{was formed}} by the Congress of the Confederation on July 13, 1787, and {{included}} all land between the Appalachian Mountains, the Mississippi River, the Great Lakes and the Ohio River. <b>This</b> <b>single</b> territory became the states of Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin, and part of eastern Minnesota. The act established an administration to oversee the territory and had the land surveyed in accordance with The Land Ordinance of 1785. At the time the territory was created, {{there were only two}} American settlements in what would become Indiana: Vincennes and Clark's Grant. The population of the northwest included fewer than 5,000 Europeans. The Native American population was estimated to be near 20,000, but may have been as high as 75,000.|$|E
5|$|The hasty {{departure}} from Manchester degenerated into chaos. Mechanical failures {{and a lack}} of space to turn the locomotives meant that the seven trains on the northern track were unable {{to get out of the}} station. Only three carriages—the Duke's among them—managed to leave successfully. At around 6.30pm the Duke arrived in Roby, and went to spend the night at the Marquess of Salisbury's house at Childwall Hall. Meanwhile, the remaining 24 passenger carriages were eventually lashed together with rope and fastened to the three locomotives which remained usable, which hauled <b>this</b> <b>single</b> long train, carrying around 600 passengers, out of Manchester at a speed of around 5mph (8km/h), further slowed by crowds of people standing on the tracks and by grit and mud settling on the rails.|$|E
5|$|The {{pre-production}} Griffon I {{shared the}} R engine's bore and stroke, but was otherwise {{a completely new}} design that first ran in the Experimental Department in November 1939. Although <b>this</b> <b>single</b> engine was never flown, the production version, the Griffon II, first flew in 1941 installed in the Fairey Firefly. A {{significant difference between the}} R and the production Griffon was the re-location of the camshaft and supercharger drives {{to the front of the}} engine to reduce overall length. Another length-reducing measure was the use of a single magneto (the R had two, mounted at the rear), this again was moved to the front of the engine.|$|E

5|$|Bertrand-Bocandé became {{involved}} in local African politics during his time as Resident. When an intertribal conflict led to an armed raid of Carabane, he mediated the conflict. In 1850, the island's economic growth was disturbed because of an extensive livestock raid which precipitated further incidents the following year. In response to this conflict with the former owners of Carabane, the residents of Kagnout, Bertrand-Bocandé convinced the governor of Senegal to send a warship to Carabane to frighten off the raiders. <b>This</b> <b>single</b> ship failed to faze the island's opponents, therefore Bertrand-Bocandé requested a detachment of soldiers and several other ships from the governor. When these reinforcements arrived from Gorée, the conflict was successfully ended. A treaty was signed on March 25, establishing the sovereignty of France not only in Casamance, but also in Kagnout and Samatit. For {{his involvement in the}} conflict, Bertrand-Bocandé was accepted into the Légion d'honneur and was given a land concession. Bertrand-Bocandé left the island in 1857 for a leave of absence, but he abandoned his post as Resident in 1860. His tireless activity had a lasting effect on the island.|$|E
5|$|For the offensive, {{the corps}} was {{reinforced}} by the 368th Fighter Anti-Tank Artillery Regiment, the 71st Anti-Aircraft Artillery Regiment, and the 47th Engineer Battalion, and {{was to make a}} breakthrough on the first day in the area between the advance of the 48th Guards and 184th Rifle Divisions, seizing Yekaterinovka and advancing on Varvarovka and Alexeyevka {{by the end of the}} day. The attack was originally scheduled to begin on 12 January, but was moved back two days to account for railroad delays. By 13 January there were 122 tanks from the army still delayed by maintenance issues, mostly from the corps' 113th and 195th Brigades. This resulted from the Voronezh Front's initial offensive planning mandating that only the 12th Tank Corps would fight in the first attack, which transferred the new tanks of the 15th to the 12th and the 12th's worn-out tanks to the 15th, although it was later decided that the entire army would fight in the operation. As a result, the 15th had much less time to reorganize in preparation for the assault, and as a result of the 113th and 195th Brigades arriving in the concentration areas on 13 January with only between 10 and 12 tanks due to the delays, all of the serviceable tanks were transferred to the 88th Tank Brigade, which was brought up to a strength of 74 tanks. <b>This</b> <b>single</b> brigade constituted the entirety of the corps' armored troops involved in the first day's attack, as the 113th and 195th were placed in army reserve until their tanks arrived.|$|E
5|$|From 1997 to 2009 {{the main}} {{collection}} was housed in <b>this</b> <b>single</b> new {{building and the}} collection of British and overseas newspapers was housed at Colindale. In July 2008 the Library {{announced that it would}} be moving low-use items to a new storage facility in Boston Spa in Yorkshire and that it planned to close the newspaper library at Colindale, ahead of a later move to a similar facility on the same site. From January 2009 to April 2012 over 200km of material was moved to the Additional Storage Building and is now delivered to British Library Reading Rooms in London on request by a daily shuttle service. Construction work on the Newspaper Storage Building was completed in 2013 and the newspaper library at Colindale closed on 8 November 2013. The collection has now been split between the St Pancras and Boston Spa sites. The British Library Document Supply Service (BLDSS) and the Library's Document Supply Collection is based on the same site in Boston Spa. Collections housed in Yorkshire, comprising low-use material and the newspaper and Document Supply collections, make up around 70% of the total material the library holds. The Library previously had a book storage depot in Woolwich, south-east London, which is no longer in use.|$|E

5|$|If {{not for the}} {{presence}} of Haflinger stallions at a stud farm in Stadl-Paura in Upper Austria after World War I, the Haflinger might well not exist in Austria today. Despite these stallions, the Haflinger breeding programs were not on solid footing in Austria, with governmental focus on other Austrian breeds and private breeding programs not large enough to influence national breeding practices. During this time, the breed was kept alive through crosses to the Hucul, Bosnian, Konik and Noriker breeds. In 1919 and 1920, the remaining stallions were assigned throughout Austria, many to areas that had hosted private breeding farms before the war. In 1921, the North Tyrolean Horse Breeders' Cooperative was formed in Zams, and in 1922, the first Haflinger Breeders' Show was held in the same location. Many extant Austrian Haflinger mares were considered to be of too low quality to be used as brood mares, and every effort was made to import higher-quality brood mares from the South Tyrol herds now in Italy. In 1926, the first studbook was established in North Tyrol. In the late 1920s, other cooperatives were established for Haflinger breeders in Weer and Wildschönau, and were able to gain government permission to purchase 100 Haflinger mares from South Tyrol and split them between North Tyrol, Upper Austria and Styria. <b>This</b> <b>single</b> transaction represented one third of all registered mares in South Tyrol, and many others were sold through private treaty, leaving the two regions comparable in terms of breeding-stock populations. In 1931, another breeders' cooperative was established in East Tyrol in Austria, and Haflinger breeding spread throughout the entire Tyrolean province.|$|E
5|$|In 406 BC Alcibiades set {{out from}} Athens with 1,500 hoplites and a hundred ships. He failed to take Andros {{and then he went}} on to Samos. Later he moved to Notium, closer to the enemy at Ephesus. In the {{meanwhile}} Tissaphernes had been replaced by Cyrus the Younger (son of Darius II of Persia) who decided to financially support the Peloponnesians. This new revenue started to attract Athenian deserters to the Spartan navy. Additionally the Spartans had replaced Mindarus with Lysander, a very capable admiral. These factors caused the rapid growth of the Peloponnesian fleet {{at the expense of the}} Athenian. In search of funds and needing to force another decisive battle, Alcibiades left Notium and sailed to help Thrasybulus in the siege of Phocaea. Alcibiades was aware the Spartan fleet was nearby, so he left nearly eighty ships to watch them under the command of his personal helmsman Antiochus, who was given express orders not to attack. Antiochus disobeyed <b>this</b> <b>single</b> order and endeavored to draw Lysander into a fight by imitating the tactics used at Cyzicus. The situation at Notium, however, was radically different from that at Cyzicus; the Athenians possessed no element of surprise, and Lysander had been well informed about their fleet by deserters. Antiochus's ship was sunk, and he was killed by a sudden Spartan attack; the remaining ships of the decoy force were then chased headlong back toward Notium, where the main Athenian force was caught unprepared by the sudden arrival of the whole Spartan fleet. In the ensuing fighting, Lysander gained an entire victory. Alcibiades soon returned and desperately tried to undo the defeat at Notium by scoring another victory, but Lysander could not be compelled to attack the fleet again.|$|E
5|$|Phase Shifting Interferometry {{addresses}} {{several issues}} associated with the classical analysis of static interferograms. Classically, one measures {{the positions of the}} fringe centers. As seen in Fig.13, fringe deviations from straightness and equal spacing provide a measure of the aberration. Errors in determining the location of the fringe centers provide the inherent limit to precision of the classical analysis, and any intensity variations across the interferogram will also introduce error. There is a trade-off between precision and number of data points: closely spaced fringes provide many data points of low precision, while widely spaced fringes provide a low number of high precision data points. Since fringe center data is all that one uses in the classical analysis, all of the other information that might theoretically be obtained by detailed analysis of the intensity variations in an interferogram is thrown away. Finally, with static interferograms, additional information is needed to determine the polarity of the wavefront: In Fig.13, one can see that the tested surface on the right deviates from flatness, but one cannot tell from <b>this</b> <b>single</b> image whether this deviation from flatness is concave or convex. Traditionally, this information would be obtained using non-automated means, such as by observing the direction that the fringes move when the reference surface is pushed.|$|E
