2500|$|In June 1949, Hardwick {{died of a}} {{heart attack}} while clamming at Church's Beach on Cuttyhunk Island off the coast of Massachusetts. [...] A friend {{reported}} that Hardwick suddenly toppled into the water as they walked along the shore. [...] Shortly after Hardwick's death, sports columnist Grantland Rice wrote a column about Hardwick in which he observed:"Tack Hardwick has been a close friend of mine for 35 years. [...] Of all the college football players I've ever known since 1900, I would say he was top man in the matter of flaming spirit. [...] He loved football with an intensity beyond belief. [...] Tack was a great halfback and a great end. [...] But above all, as a real tribute, he was a greater blocker and a greater tackler. [...] He <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>once</b> <b>that</b> he would rather block or tackle than carry the ball to a touchdown. … If football had a weakness for Hardwick it was that the game was not quite rough enough." ...|$|E
2500|$|Working with Bing Crosby {{proved to}} be {{problematic}} from the start. Between scenes he barely interacted with leading lady Joan Fontaine, on loan from RKO Radio Pictures, who later recalled, [...] "Crosby wasn't very courteous to me ... There was never the usual costar rapport. I was a star at that time, but he treated me like he'd never heard of me." [...] The singer tended to ignore his director as well. According to Fontaine, [...] "It wasn't that he had anything against Mr. Wilder. He just didn't {{pay much attention to}} him. He <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>once</b> <b>that</b> he had some trouble understanding his funny accent." [...] Worst of all, Crosby tended to alter his dialogue, saying it [...] "as he felt it at the moment," [...] and Wilder was known for insisting his lines be delivered exactly as written. [...] "Bing Crosby operated for himself, not for the group or the film," [...] Wilder recalled. [...] "He was a big star, the biggest, and he thought he knew what was good for him." ...|$|E
2500|$|Wolfe has {{an aversion}} to {{physical}} contact, even shaking hands. Early in the first novel Archie explains why there is a gong under his bed that will ring upon any intrusion into or near Wolfe's own bedroom: [...] "Wolfe <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>once</b> ... <b>that</b> he really had no cowardice in him, he only had an intense distaste for being touched by anyone …" [...] When Jerome Berin, creator of saucisse minuit, repeatedly taps Wolfe on the knee, Archie grins at [...] "Wolfe, who didn't like being touched, concealing his squirm {{for the sake of}} sausages." [...] In Prisoner's Base, Wolfe speaks coldly as he tells the DA and Inspector Cramer that the despised Lieutenant Rowcliff [...] "put a hand on me. ... I will not have a hand put on me, gentlemen. I like no man's hand on me, and one such as Mr. Rowcliff's, unmerited, I will not have." [...] Wolfe's prejudices make it all the more surprising when, in [...] "Cordially Invited to Meet Death", Archie finds Wolfe in the kitchen with a woman who has solved the problem of preparing corned beef: [...] "Standing beside him, closer to him than I had ever seen any woman or girl of any age tolerated, with her hand slipped between his arm and his bulk, was Maryella." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Sewell," [...] {{the young}} man said abruptly, [...] "you <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>once</b> you-- <b>that</b> you {{sometimes}} had money put into your hands that you could lend." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I know,' said John, 'no {{one could}} expect it of you. Arthur <b>told</b> <b>me</b> at <b>once</b> <b>that</b> you were free from any shadow of blame, {{and no one}} thinks of imputing any.' ...|$|R
60|$|The {{next time}} I saw Ellesworth he <b>told</b> <b>me</b> at <b>once</b> <b>that</b> he {{regarded}} Albania as unable {{to stand by}} itself. So I gave him five dollars on the spot and left him.|$|R
6000|$|... "You <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>once</b> <b>that</b> you are {{conscious}} of leaving your body when in trance," [...] I said. [...] "Do {{you always have}} that sensation?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'A hundred dollars, I dare say. Dr. Wilkinson's cook <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>once</b> <b>that</b> he done {{something}} to a lady's eyes, and asked a thousand dollars for it.' ...|$|E
60|$|But you <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>once</b> <b>that</b> ants {{would fight}} and plunder each other's nests. And once we saw two hives of bees {{fighting}} in the air, and falling dead by dozens.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{mean that}} her {{engagement}} to Captain Aylmer makes it unnecessary {{for you to}} suppose that she is in want of any pecuniary assistance. You <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>once</b> before <b>that</b> you would feel yourself called upon {{to see that she}} wanted nothing." ...|$|R
60|$|It {{seemed to}} be {{the middle of the night}} when I was awakened by Lawrence Cavendish. He had a candle in his hand, and the {{agitation}} of his face <b>told</b> <b>me</b> at <b>once</b> <b>that</b> something was seriously wrong.|$|R
6000|$|... "You are teasing me," [...] she said. [...] "Our dear one <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>once</b> to {{remember}} <b>that</b> men serve always something greater than themselves--the idea." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, Uncle," [...] {{replied the}} child. [...] "But the Sawhorse never says much. He <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>once</b> <b>that</b> he can't talk and {{think at the}} same time, so he prefers to think." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>once</b> <b>that</b> if I {{bought a}} certain little dog, {{it would lead}} to my being everlastingly--you know what. She isn't so squeamish as I am, and said it out." ...|$|E
60|$|CHR. He <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>once</b> <b>that</b> he was {{resolved}} {{to go on}} pilgrimage, as we do now; {{but all of a}} sudden he grew acquainted with one Save-self, and then he became a stranger to me.|$|E
60|$|I left {{a little}} before closing time that night, and made my way, by a {{circuitous}} route, to my cousin's club. I was shown into the strangers' room, and Gilbert {{came to me in}} a few moments. His face <b>told</b> <b>me</b> at <b>once</b> <b>that</b> he had met with no success. He carefully closed the door, and came over to my side of the room.|$|R
60|$|It was {{produced}} without delay by the high-priest Larico, which <b>told</b> <b>me</b> at <b>once</b> <b>that</b> all this scene had been prepared. Upanqui {{took it from}} Larico, and beckoning Kari to him, with the priest's help bound it about his brow, thereby acknowledging him and restoring him as heir-apparent to the Empire. Then he {{kissed him on the}} brow and Kari knelt down and did his father homage.|$|R
6000|$|... "We've time yet," [...] {{said the}} inspector, glancing at his watch. [...] "I've a cab at the door, and it won't take us twenty minutes to Victoria. But about this picture: I thought you <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>once,</b> Mr. Holmes, <b>that</b> you {{had never met}} Professor Moriarty." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mocker did. He {{sang and}} sang, for he clearly loves to sing. When he {{finished}} Peter had another question ready. [...] "Somebody <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>once</b> <b>that</b> {{down in the}} South you are the best loved of all the birds. Is that so?" ...|$|E
60|$|CHRIS. He <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>once</b> <b>that</b> he was {{resolved}} {{to go on}} pilgrimage as we do now; {{but all of a}} sudden he grew acquainted with one Save-self, and then he became a stranger to me, for at that time he gave up going on pilgrimage.|$|E
6000|$|... "In {{the eyes}} of your misguided profession, statesmen and authors and emigrants and other public charges have no Rights of Privacy," [...] said she. [...] "Mr. Longfellow <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>once</b> <b>that</b> they were to name a brand of flour for him, {{and that he had}} no redress." ...|$|E
5000|$|In a 2000 {{episode of}} Family Guy, [...] "The Story on Page One", Peter Griffin tells Luke Perry that [...] "Dark Side of the Moon totally syncs {{up with the}} Wizard of Oz", to which Perry replies, [...] "You know, Shannen Doherty <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>once,</b> but I thought she was just being a bitch." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 18th.--Feeling {{weary and}} {{depressed}} this morning, I left Laura with Mrs. Vesey, {{and went out}} alone for one of my brisk midday walks, which I have discontinued too much of late. I took the dry airy road over the moor that leads to Todd's Corner. After having been out half an hour, I was excessively surprised to see Sir Percival approaching me {{from the direction of}} the farm. He was walking rapidly, swinging his stick, his head erect as usual, and his shooting jacket flying open in the wind. When we met he did not wait for me to ask any questions--he <b>told</b> <b>me</b> at <b>once</b> <b>that</b> he had been to the farm to inquire if Mr. or Mrs. Todd had received any tidings, since his last visit to Limmeridge, of Anne Catherick.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah! {{that was}} the way we came to have you! I must tell you, dear Sir Stephen always guessed. Once when he had quite vexed poor mamma by {{preventing}} her from joking you in her way about young ladies, he <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>once,</b> when he was young, he had liked some one who died or was married, I don't quite know which, and he thought it was the same with you, from something that happened when you withdrew your application for leave after your wound." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>once</b> <b>that</b> {{he had no}} friends, and no relations, and no name {{save the}} one which he had made for himself," [...] she said. [...] "I don't know whether he meant that Maddison was not his real name, or whether he meant simply his reputation." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, {{you don't}} tell me, Mr. Porter!" [...] exclaimed the lady, in astonishment. [...] "He <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>once</b> <b>that</b> {{he had lived}} with his folks up to {{the time he was}} about ten years old, and that then his parents had died and he had gone to live with an uncle." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{would think}} that you had stolen me," [...] she replied, [...] "and as he wishes me for himself, he will kill any other whom he thinks desires me. He killed Wettin a few days ago. My mother <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>once</b> <b>that</b> Wettin was my father. He was king. Now Buckingham is king." ...|$|E
6000|$|There he stood, {{rolling his}} eyes and hugging his kaross around him because of the cold, and {{something}} in his anxious, indeterminate expression <b>told</b> <b>me</b> at <b>once</b> <b>that</b> he knew {{himself to be a}} man in terrible danger. Just behind him, dark and brooding, his arms folded on his breast, his eyes fixed upon the ground, looking, to my moved imagination, like an evil genius, stood the stately and graceful Saduko. On his left was a young and sturdy white man carrying a rifle and smoking a pipe, whom I guessed to be John Dunn, a gentleman whom, as it chanced, I had never met, while behind were a force of Natal Government Zulus, clad in some kind of uniform and armed with guns, and with them a number of natives, also from Natal--"kraal Kafirs," [...] who carried stabbing assegais. One of these led John Dunn's horse.|$|R
6000|$|... "Did {{you ever}} hear {{anything}} like that? And he was so patient about it. It made me quite sorry for him. But he is exasperating, too, sometimes. Of course one would not do anything to vex him {{even if it were}} worth while. But it isn't. He's so jolly innocent that if you were to put your thumb to your nose and wave your fingers at him he would only wonder gravely to himself what got into you. He <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>once</b> quite simply <b>that</b> he found it very difficult to make out what made people always act so queerly. He's too dense to trouble about, and that's the truth." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{was only}} {{occasionally}} that we met alone; but ere long she confessed {{that she loved}} me. Without telling her my real name, I disclosed to her that I was of her own rank and that I had entered upon the disguise I wore {{in order to win}} her love. She was romantic, and was flattered by my devotion. I owned to her that hitherto I had been wild and reckless; and she <b>told</b> <b>me</b> at <b>once</b> <b>that</b> her father destined her for the son of an old friend of his, to whom it appeared she had been affianced while still a baby. She was positive that nothing would move her father. For the man she was to marry she entertained no kind of affection, and indeed had never seen him, as she had been brought up in a convent to the age of fifteen; and just before she had returned thence he had gone to finish his education at Padua.|$|R
6000|$|She {{coloured}} {{a little}} at the compliment, and said, lightly: [...] "Father <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>once</b> <b>that</b> Irishmen were great hands at compliments. He {{told me that there}} was some stone that people went to an old castle to kiss--I think that he called it the Blarney Stone--and after {{that they were able to}} say all sorts of absurd things." ...|$|E
60|$|Paul Ruttledge. Yes, I remember. I {{have seen}} them coming home there on a windy evening, tossing and {{whirling}} like the sea. They may have seen what I am looking for, they fly so far. A sailor <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>once</b> <b>that</b> he saw a crow three hundred miles from land, but maybe he was a liar.|$|E
6000|$|... "Leslie {{would never}} do that, Gilbert. Her sense of duty is very strong. She <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>once</b> <b>that</b> her Grandmother West always {{impressed}} upon her {{the fact that when}} she assumed any responsibility she must never shirk it, no matter what the consequences might be. That is one of her cardinal rules. I suppose it's very old-fashioned." ...|$|E
5000|$|Di Maggio {{made several}} {{declarations}} on {{the relation between}} the Mafia and politics. According to Di Maggio, Riina “personally <b>told</b> <b>me</b> more than <b>once</b> <b>that</b> it is not possible for a politician, at any level, to become a man of honour. It is not even possible for a man of honour to start a political career. On the basis of this rule, which was expressed to me in categorical terms, there is a substantial contempt on the part of Cosa Nostra towards politicians, who are not regarded as serious enough {{to become part of the}} organisation.” ...|$|R
6000|$|DEAR JOE,--It is {{ten days}} since Susy [Twichell] wrote {{that you were}} laid up with a sprained shoulder, since which time we have had no news about it. I hope that no news is good news, {{according}} to the proverb; still, authoritative confirmation {{of it will be}} gladly received in this family, if some of you will furnish it. Moreover, I should like to know how and where it happened. In the pulpit, as like as not, otherwise you would not be taking so much pains to conceal it. This is not a malicious suggestion, and not a personally-invented one: you <b>told</b> <b>me</b> yourself, <b>once,</b> <b>that</b> you threw artificial power and impressiveness into places in your sermons where needed, by [...] "banging the bible"--(your own words.) You have reached a time of life when it is not wise to take these risks. You would better jump around. We all have to change our methods as the infirmities of age creep upon us. Jumping around will be impressive now, whereas before you were gray it would have excited remark.|$|R
60|$|Another {{good plan}} is to start {{something}}. Something on a huge scale: something nobody ever thought of. For instance, one man I know <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>once</b> he was down in Mexico without a cent (he'd lost his five in striking Central America) and he noticed {{that they had no}} power plants. So he started some and made a mint of money. Another man that I know was once stranded in New York, absolutely without a nickel. Well, {{it occurred to him that}} what was needed were buildings ten stories higher than any that had been put up. So he built two and sold them right away. Ever so many millionaires begin in some such simple way as that.|$|R
