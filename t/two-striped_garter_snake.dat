50|$|The <b>two-striped</b> <b>garter</b> <b>snake</b> (Thamnophis hammondii) is {{a species}} of aquatic garter snake that lives in western North America.|$|E
50|$|Snakes {{found on}} the Ecological Reserve include: San Bernardino ring-necked snake, Hammond's <b>two-striped</b> <b>garter</b> <b>snake,</b> coastal rosy boa, Western yellow-bellied racer, California striped racer, San Joaquin coachwhip, red diamond rattlesnake, Southern Pacific rattlesnake, San Diego gopher snake, California kingsnake.|$|E
50|$|Open {{seven days}} a week from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., the Bolsa Chica Conservancy Interpretive Center offers live animal exhibits, aquaria, maps and {{information}} about Bolsa Chica and education programs on wetland science. The main room’s exhibits include live marine life species native to Bolsa Chica and the southern California coast, including bat stars, ochre stars, giant-spined stars, warty sea cucumbers, Kellet’s whelks, chestnut cowries, striped shore crabs, and California spiny lobster. A second exhibit room includes live reptiles such as California kingsnakes, San Diego gopher snake, coastal rosy boa, <b>two-striped</b> <b>garter</b> <b>snakes,</b> and alligator lizards. Throughout the center there are many examples of taxidermy including opossums, snakes and birds such as the great blue heron, California brown pelican, Cooper’s hawk, red-shouldered hawk, and Anna’s hummingbird.|$|R
40|$|For 33 years, {{only two}} {{specimens}} of the <b>garter</b> <b>snake</b> (Thamnophis couchi hammondi) were recorded for Santa Catalina Island {{and the status}} of this species remained unknown. In August 1974, a small population was discovered in the stream and reservoir in Cottonwood Canyon. The species apparently occurs nowhere else on the island. Unlike most <b>two-striped</b> mainland specimens, <b>garter</b> <b>snakes</b> on Santa Catalina lack any pattern, being a uniform olive-brown with pale buff lips and chins. In this respect they most closely resemble a different species from central Baja California and a conspecific population near Lompoc on the California mainland. The ecology of Cottonwood and other stream canyons on Santa Catalina is discussed, as are human impacts on <b>garter</b> <b>snakes,</b> and recommendations for conservation measures. Finally, rafting is proposed as a mechanism by which <b>garter</b> <b>snakes</b> from the Lompoc region might have founded the population on Santa Catalina Island...|$|R

50|$|The Santa Ana {{speckled}} dace (Rhinichthys osculus ssp.) used Strawberry Creek until {{the combination of}} low flows in the 2003 summer drought and the wildfire and floods in November/December of 2003 apparently wiped out the fish. The Santa Ana {{speckled dace}} are very rare and threatened by human activities such as water withdrawal, barriers to movement and isolation. The habitat supports many threatened, endangered, and Forest Service Sensitive species. The list includes, least Bell's vireo, southwestern willow flycatcher, <b>two-striped</b> <b>garter</b> <b>snake,</b> California spotted owl, and the southern rubber boa. Plans are being made to reintroduce the Santa Ana speckled dace and mountain yellow legged frog when water conditions are appropriate. The prolonged drought has had a significant affect on streams in southern California {{and their ability to}} support animal species that require surface water.|$|E
50|$|The Western {{pond turtle}} is an endemic species to the Arroyo Conejo and other creeks. Newbury Park {{is home to}} an {{abundance}} of reptiles, including lizards such as the Western fence lizard, Coast horned lizard, Common side-blotched lizard, Southern alligator lizard, Teiidae and the California legless lizard. There are eleven species of snake recorded in the Greater Thousand Oaks Area: Southern Pacific rattlesnake, Ring-necked snake, Western yellowbelly racer, California whipsnake, Coachwhip, Gopher snake, California kingsnake, <b>Two-striped</b> <b>garter</b> <b>snake,</b> Western Black-headed Snake, Lyre snake, and Night snake. Thousand Oaks proper is home to 171 recorded species of birds, including seventeen raptors such as the Barn owl, Cooper’s hawk, American kestrel, Prairie falcon, Red-shouldered hawk, Golden eagle, Great horned owl, White-tailed kite, California vulture, Northern harrier, Sharp-shinned hawk, Ferruginous hawk, Merlin and Screech owl. Commonly encountered bird species include the House sparrow, House finch, Brewer's blackbird, Common raven, California towhee, Acorn woodpecker, California quail, and the Red-tailed hawk.|$|E
50|$|The {{community}} of Santa Susana is {{adjacent to the}} Santa Susana Pass wildlife corridor, which connects the Simi Hills (and the Santa Monica Mountains) to the Santa Susana Mountains and further wilderness {{areas such as the}} Tehachapi Mountains and San Gabriel Mountains. It is home to an abundance of wildlife, including larger mammals such as numerous mountain lions, prairie wolves, bobcats, grey foxes and more common species such as the Virginia opossum, California raccoon, ring-tailed cat, California vole, desert cottontail, Botta's pocket gopher as well as the spotted- and striped skunk. Large undeveloped areas provide natural habitat to numerous species, and saves the wildlife of the Santa Monica Mountains from genetic isolation. As {{in the rest of the}} Simi Valley, large areas are assigned parks or open space preserves and are protected wildlife habitats. The dry semi-arid climate of Santa Susana also provides a habitat for numerous species adopted to arid climates and temperature extremes. It is home to numerous reptiles, including eleven species of snake: coachwhip, southern Pacific rattlesnake, San Diego night snake, striped racer, California black-headed snake, <b>two-striped</b> <b>garter</b> <b>snake,</b> San Diego gopher snake, coast mountain kingsnake, California kingsnake, coast patch-nosed snake and ringneck snake. Lizards found here are also plentiful, including the San Diego horned lizard, California horned lizard, San Diego alligator lizard, western fence lizard, California side blotched lizard, western skink, western whiptail, and silvery legless lizard. Birds in the area are mostly raptors, including the California vulture, turkey vulture, white-tailed kite, American kestrel, Cooper's hawk, sharp-shinned hawk, marsh hawk, red-tailed hawk, red-shouldered hawk, and the common nighthawk. Owl species include the great horned owl, short-eared owl, long-eared owl, barn owl, and the burrowing owl. There are also peacocks and numerous other species of wildlife found in the eastern Simi Valley. Scorpions are also common.|$|E

50|$|Dos Vientos Open Space is a 1,216 acres {{open space}} area in western Newbury Park, California. It {{contains}} more than 41 miles of trails used for cycling, hiking and equestrians. Originally {{a part of the}} Rancho Guadalasca Spanish Land Grant of 1836, the area is now an important wildlife movement corridor into the Santa Monica Mountains through the Point Mugu State Park. It provides a habitat for a variety of wildlife, including bobcats, mule deer, coyotes, eagles, hawks, barn owls, mountain lions, and more. It provides regional and internal trail connections, many trails offering panoramic views of the Conejo Valley, Oxnard Plain, Topatopa Mountains, Channel Islands, and the Pacific Ocean. Some of the endangered plant species found here include Conejo Buckwheat, Verity's liveforever, and Conejo Dudleya. The landscape is undeveloped, and dominated by coastal sage scrub, grassy hillsides, oak woodlands, and chaparral habitats.Besides numerous trail access points from the Dos Vientos Ranch neighborhood, the primary trailhead and parking lot is located at the Dos Vientos Community Park. Following the Park View Trail {{at the far end of}} the community park, one can either cross Via Ricardo to access the Powerline Trail (Edison Road Trail) across the road, which leads to the Conejo Mountain, or one can follow Via Ricardo to the left for 0.1 mile before entering the Vista Del Mar Trailhead. The Vista Del Mar Trail climbs up the Conejo Hills with overlook points with panoramic views of the Santa Monica Mountains, Boney Peak, Camarillo, Topatopa Mountains, Pacific Ocean, and the Channel Islands. It leads to Twin Ponds, which is two secluded ponds functioning as a designated conservation area for various migrating waterfowl species, birds such as mallards and ducks, freshwater fish species, as well as the Western Pond Turtle and the <b>Two-striped</b> <b>garter</b> <b>snake.</b> The ponds were originally built in the 1920s as part of an irrigation system for ranching and agriculture.|$|E
50|$|The Simi Hills are {{the most}} {{critical}} wildlife corridor linkage from the Santa Monica Mountains — to the Santa Susana Mountains, and beyond to the Topatopa Mountains, San Gabriel Mountains, and other Transverse Ranges further east. The Simi's undeveloped native habitat provides routes that protect larger land wildlife of the Santa Monicas from genetic isolation. Large sections of the Simi Hills are protected by parks and open space preserves. Animals in the area include mammals such as the Virginia opossum, ornate shrew, broad-footed mole, mountain lion, mule deer, bobcat, spotted and striped skunk, California badger, southern California weasel, California raccoon, ringtail cat, black bear, Botta's pocket gopher, desert cottontail, valley coyote, gray fox, California vole, brush rabbit, California ground- and California grey squirrel, {{as well as several}} species of mice (California pocket mouse, western harvest mouse, brush mouse, deer mouse, and house mouse), rats (agile kangaroo rat, dusky-footed woodrat, black rat, roof rat, and brown rat) and bats (long-eared myotis, long-legged myotis, California myotis, small-footed myotis, western pipistrelle, Brazilian free-tailed bat, western mastiff bat, and Tejon myotis). Some of the reptiles in the area include several species of snakes (coachwhip, southern Pacific rattlesnake, San Diego night snake, striped racer, California black-headed snake, <b>two-striped</b> <b>garter</b> <b>snake,</b> San Diego gopher snake, coast mountain kingsnake, California kingsnake, coast patch-nosed snake, ringneck snake) and lizards (western fence lizard, California side blotched lizard, western skink, western whiptail, San Diego horned lizard, California horned lizard, San Diego alligator lizard, silvery legless lizard). There are ten species of amphibians in Simi Valley: the California newt, western spadefoot, California toad, arroyo toad, California slender salamander, arboreal salamander, American bullfrog, California red-legged frog, California treefrog, and the Pacific treefrog.Birds in Simi Valley include Anna's hummingbird, Canada goose, mallard, California quail, common egret, great blue heron, American bittern, American coot, killdeer, mourning dove, roadrunner, belted kingfisher, black phoebe, barn swallow, cliff swallow, common raven, crow, white-breasted nuthatch, cactus wren, mockingbird, robin, cedar waxwing, phainopepla, starling, least Bell's vireo, hooded oriole, western tanager, several species of blackbird (western meadowlark, Brewer's blackbird and brown-headed cowbird) and woodpeckers (common flicker, Nuttall's woodpecker, acorn woodpecker, and yellow-bellied sapsucker). Raptors include turkey vulture, white-tailed kite, American kestrel, poor-will and several species of hawks (Cooper's hawk, sharp-shinned hawk, marsh hawk, red-tailed hawk, red-shouldered hawk, and the common nighthawk) and owls (great horned owl, short-eared owl, long-eared owl, barn owl, and the burrowing owl).

2500|$|San Francisco <b>garter</b> <b>snakes</b> forage {{extensively}} in aquatic habitats. Adult snakes feed primarily on California red-legged frogs (Rana draytonii), which are federally listed as threatened. They may also feed on juvenile bullfrogs (Rana catesbeiana), {{but they are}} unable to consume adults; in fact, adult bullfrogs prey on juvenile <b>garter</b> <b>snakes,</b> and may be a contributing factor in the population decline of the San Francisco <b>garter</b> <b>snake.</b> Newborn and juvenile San Francisco <b>garter</b> <b>snakes</b> depend heavily upon Pacific treefrogs (Pseudacris regilla [...] ) as prey. If newly metamorphosed Pacific treefrogs are not available, the young <b>garter</b> <b>snakes</b> may not survive.

40|$|A {{preliminary}} {{account of}} the relict mesophilic herpetofauna of the oases of central Baja California supports previous hypotheses of an historical ecological transformation of central Baja California from a mesic to a xeric region. The general herpetological pattern that emerges is that a treefrog (Hyla cadaverina and/or H. regilla), a slider turtle (Trachemys scripta), and the <b>two-striped</b> <b>garter</b> <b>snake</b> (Thamnophis hammondii) usually occur in a particular oasis. Occasionally, other mesophilic lizards and snakes are found, as well. The hypothesis we present is that these mesophilic taxa had a continuous transpeninsular distribution during earlier wetter periods, but with the rapid desertification of central Baja California in the last 8000 - 10, 000 years, these species have become restricted to the mesic refugia of oases in the central peninsular portion of their ranges. Unfortunately, many of the oases are being severely altered by direct and indirect human activities which, in some cases, have persisted for nearly 300 years since the Mission Period. Physical alterations include damming for irrigation, pumping for drinking water, and trampling by cattle. Biological alteration includes the introduction of non- native species of plants and animals. Such alterations {{have led to the}} extinction and/or decline of some of the mesophilic herpetofauna in some of the oases...|$|E
40|$|Several aquatic {{vertebrates}} {{have been}} introduced into freshwater systems in California over the past 100 years. Some populations of the <b>two-striped</b> <b>garter</b> <b>snake</b> (Thamnophis hammondii) have lived in sympatry with these species since their introduction; other populations have never encountered them. To assess the possible adaptation to a novel prey, we tested the predatory responses of T. hammondii from different populations to different chemosensory cues from native and introduced prey species. We presented chemical extracts from potential prey types and 2 control odors to individual snakes on cotton swabs and recorded the number of tongue flicks and attacks directed at each swab. Subject response was higher for prey odors than control substances. Odors from introduced centrarchid fish (Lepomis) elicited higher response levels than other prey types, including native anuran larvae (Pseudacris regilla). The pattern of response was similar for both populations of snakes (experienced and naïve, {{with respect to the}} introduced prey). We suggest that the generalist aquatic lifestyle of T. hammondii has allowed it to take advantage of increasing populations of introduced prey. Decisions on the management strategies for some of these introduced prey species should include consideration of how T. hammondii populations might respond in areas of sympatry...|$|E

5000|$|The saliva of {{a common}} <b>garter</b> <b>snake</b> may be toxic to {{amphibians}} and other small animals. <b>Garter</b> <b>snakes</b> were researched and studies show they have a mild venom in their saliva. For humans, a bite is not dangerous, though it may cause slight itching, burning, and/or swelling. Most common <b>garter</b> <b>snakes</b> also secrete a foul-smelling fluid from postanal glands when handled or harmed.|$|R
50|$|Like {{many species}} of North American <b>garter</b> <b>snake,</b> the western {{terrestrial}} <b>garter</b> <b>snake</b> possesses a mildly venomous saliva. Specimens collected from Idaho and Washington produced venom with myonecrotic (muscle tissue-killing) effects when injected into the gastrocnemius muscles of mice.
