We apply it to different field shapes used for Z. electroporation and electrofusion: rectangular <b>pulses,</b> <b>trapezoidal</b> <b>pulses</b> approximating rectangular pulses with finite rise time, Z. exponential pulses, and sine RF-modulated pulses. Using the described method, the course of induced transmembrane voltage is investigated for each selected pulse shape. All the studies are performed at different pulse durations, each for both the normal physiological and the low-conductivity medium. For all the pulse shapes investigated, it is shown that as the conductivity of extracellular medium is reduced, this slows down the process of transmembrane voltage inducement. Thus, longer pulses have to be used to attain the desired voltage amplitude, as the influence of the fast, short-lived phenomena on the induced voltage is diminished. Due to this reason, RF-modulation in such a medium is ineffective. The appendix gives a complete set of derived expressions and a discussion about possible simplifications. q 1998 Elsevier Science S.

30|$|FE {{sources have}} the {{potential}} for unprecedented temporal modulation. Compared to other one-dimensional nanomaterials, CNTs allow for near ballistic conduction making them ideally suited for such high-speed applications. Pulse X-ray sources are practically beneficial when imaging moving objects. The principle of operation is analogous to stroboscopic lighting in optical imaging. Conventional TE X-ray sources are generally not capable of rapid control; they cannot be pulsed much more rapidly than a few tens of milliseconds, without sophisticated gating mechanisms. The means of controlling the beam current in a TE source is by adjusting the filament current and hence temperature, which introduces time delays due to the finite cooling and heating time of the filament. Pulse sources are therefore generally implemented by switching the anode voltage, or by means of mechanically controlled shutters, the latter only allowing for relatively course control over the pulse shape, on period, and mark-to-space ratio, and will inevitably create a <b>trapezoidal</b> <b>pulse.</b> In the case of existing FE and TE sources, the short duration of the pulse must be compensated by increased power levels, resulting in significant engineering design constraints with regards to the resilience of the emitting material; conventional electron emitting materials degrade rapidly when used in such high power applications.|$|E

40|$|Charge-pumping (CP) {{measurement}} {{is performed}} on MOSFETs with their gates tied to sawtooth pulses. Influence of both rise time (tr) and fall time (tf) on the CP current {{of the devices}} with different channel lengths is investigated at different pulse frequencies. Results show that the dominant mechanism affecting the measurement accuracy is the energy range of interface-trap distribution Dit(E) swept by the gate signal for frequencies below 500 kHz and carrier emission for frequencies above 500 kHz. For frequencies higher than 600 kHz, incomplete recombination could be an additional mechanism when tf is too short. Hence, {{it is suggested that}} low frequency is more favorable than high frequency, especially for sawtooth pulses with long tr and short tf, due to little carrier emission and negligible geometric effects even for devices as long as 50 μm. However, if high frequency (e. g. 1 MHz) is required to obtain a sufficiently large S/N ratio in the CP current, sawtooth pulses with equal tr and tf should be chosen for the least carrier emission effect and thus more reliable results on interface-state density, Moreover, for both sawtooth and <b>trapezoidal</b> <b>pulses</b> with a typical amplitude of 5 V, a lower limit of 200 ns for tr and tf is necessary to suppress all the undesirable effects in devices shorter than at least 20 μm. published_or_final_versio...|$|R

40|$|The {{main goal}} of this work is to clarify and quantify, by means of {{mathematical}} analysis, the role of structural viscoelasticity in the biomechanical response of deformable porous media with incompressible constituents to sudden changes in external applied loads. Models of deformable porous media with incompressible constituents are often utilized to describe the behavior of biological tissues, such as cartilages, bones and engineered tissue scaffolds, where viscoelastic properties may change with age, disease or by design. Here, for the first time, we show that the fluid velocity within the medium could increase tremendously, even up to infinity, should the external applied load experience sudden changes in time and the structural viscoelasticity be too small. In particular, we consider a one-dimensional poro-visco-elastic model for which we derive explicit solutions in the cases where the external applied load {{is characterized by a}} step pulse or a <b>trapezoidal</b> <b>pulse</b> in time.

Interestingly, the loss of viscoelastic tissue properties has been associated with various disease conditions, such as atherosclerosis, Alzheimer's disease and glaucoma.

In the literature, there exist several methods {{for dealing with}} this problem. For instance, there exist random modulation techniques, and spread-spectrum techniques. Here, the harmonics of the PWM-waveform are smeared across a wider frequency domain and this causes the magnitude to decrease. Hence, an easier filtering of the harmonics is possible. A {{first part of this}} thesis consists of evaluating how these random and spread-spectrum techniques have advantages with respect to ordinary PWM. Both a theoretical study and an experimental can be performed. Induction motors, connected to a Voltage Source Inverter (VSI) are widely applied in industry. The motors are driven by square wave PWM voltages. The dv/dt’s of these voltages are very high (order 10 ^ 9 V/s). In three-phase inverters with three half-bridges, there is a common-mode (CM) voltage because the PWM-signals are inherently asymmetrical. These CM-voltage generates a leakage current, that flows through the parasitic capacitance between ground and motor, and through the motor cable. The problem is not only a bad EMC, {{but there is also a}} voltage across the motor axis and a bearing current which reduces the lifetime of the bearings. The seconds purpose of this thesis is to evaluate improved PWM-techniques for mitigating above mentioned problems in VSI-driven motors. The focus in this part is on techniques which reduce CM. Following parameters can be studied for comparing the different PWM-methods: leakage current, voltage across the axis, bearing current, CM at motor connections, conducted EMI at the output of the inverter, conducted EMI of high frequency in the motor cable, maximal modulation index, … References: [1] A.

Results of the survey indicate that adequate torso and extremity restraint is the primary variable in tolerance to rapidly applied accelerations. The harness, or restraint system, must be arranged to transmit the major portion of the accelerating force directly to the pelvic structure and not via the vertebral column. When the conditions of adequate restraint have been met, then the other variables, direction, magnitude, and onset rate of rapidly applied accelerations, govern maximum tolerance and injury limits.

The explicit method has been used extensively in order to effectively replicate the complex events due to its ability to solve highly non-linear problems with very less convergence issues and unconditional stability. However, the limiting factor being the computational time to carry out such analysis being very high. For quasi-static based problems, implicit methods have proven to be a good solution, as the computational time required in this method is shorter and the calculations cycles involved are fewer, but with an implication of conditional stability. Thus, its very important to understand the pros and cons of each integration scheme and choose the suitable one based on the application. In the current study, a methodology has been devised utilising both the schemes to arrive at a reliable dynamic load factor. The methodology involves carrying out the dynamic simulation first to replicate the dynamic event, followed by a modal transient analysis to understand the active modes at each time instant. The equivalent static loads are calculated based on the modal transient analysis and applied in static or quasi static analysis to obtain similar stress and strain patterns in the components and thus the dynamic load factor. In the pre-study of the thesis, simple geometries such as the beams were tested for 2 configurations, namely, cantilever and simply supported. The physical and load impulse characteristics were investigated. In the main study, the project involved analysing the loading conditions from the multi-body dynamics model of the vehicle chassis components and developing an FE model to study the response of the sun-assembly to the applied dynamic and static loads. The equivalent static loads were adjusted to achieve the same damage (stress and strain distribution) in the components. The above procedure was adopted for 2 load cases, namely, the side kerb impact and the pothole load case. Parametric study was conducted to investiiv gate the effect of each parameter on the output response. The components studied in this work are the upper and the lower control arms of SLA type suspension system. Some of the key findings from the thesis work are : • Fundamental frequency of the sub-assembly governs the maximum displacement response. • For the various load curves studied, namely triangular,sinusoidal, and <b>trapezoidal</b> <b>pulse</b> load, the maximum response was found to be mainly influenced by the average impulse acting on the system. • The maximum displacement of the system is majorly governed by the ratio of the impulse duration to the fundamental time period of the system in case of isosceles triangular impulses. • The dynamic peak load has negligible effect on the dynamic load factors.

40|$|A new {{data-driven}} approach {{using the}} {{frequency response function}} of a system is proposed for designing robust digital controllers for the injection bumper magnet (BSW) power supplies of the PS Booster. The powering of the BSW requires high precision 3. 4 kA to 6. 7 kA <b>trapezoidal</b> current <b>pulses</b> with 2 ms flat-top and 5 ms ramp-up and ramp-down time. The tracking error must remain within ± 50 parts-per-million (ppm) during the flat-top of the trapezoidal reference, and ± 500 ppm during the ramp-down. The BSW is powered with a four quadrant switch-mode power converter and the current through the magnet is controlled in closed-loop form with a 2 -degree-of-freedom controller at a sampling rate of 10 kHz. A convex optimization algorithm is performed for obtaining the controller parameters. The effectiveness of the method is illustrated by designing the controller for a full-scale prototype of the BSW system at CERN, {{which is in the}} framework of the LHC Injector Upgrade (LIU) project...|$|R
30|$|The second effect which {{contributes}} to the increase of the transient current response is the velocity overshoot effect in the regions {{very close to the}} contacts. During a very short time when the bias pulse is applied, the carrier velocities in these regions are higher than the peak velocity. This effect clearly appears in the HD models, but is completely absent from the DD models. The overshoot is absent in the DC regime. For the DD model, one can also see the difference between the DC current at U[*]=[*] 28 V (curve 2 in Figure 7) and the transient current corresponding to the plateau when the bias is also U 0 [*]=[*] 28 V (curve 2 in Figure 6). There is no physical reason for this difference. As was explained earlier, it is due to the convergence problems in the DD transient simulations for a <b>trapezoidal</b> bias <b>pulse</b> which in turn deteriorated the numerical accuracy of the simulation.|$|R
40|$|Korea Superconducting Tokamak Advanced Research (KSTAR) began {{operation}} in 2008 {{and is a}} fully superconducting tokamak using ITER-like superconductor. All of the SC coils, using cable-in-conduit conductors (CICCs), are cooled with forced-flow supercritical helium (SHe) at 4. 5 K and 5. 5 bar, to maintain a superconducting state. We consider here the central couple of the PF coils, which during operation is subjected to sharp current transients, which induce AC losses in the superconducting coils due to the change in magnetic field, {{which leads to the}} backflow of the helium. The thermal hydraulics due to one of the <b>trapezoidal</b> current <b>pulse</b> in the PF 1 L coil is analyzed, with ramp up rate of 1 kA/s and ramp down rate of 10 kA/s, with maximum current of 10 kA, using the recently developed 4 C code. The main thermal-hydraulic characteristics (evolution of temperatures, pressures, mass flow rates) at different coil locations are computed and compared with the measurements, showing that expected AC losses turns out to be much smaller that the experimental one...|$|R
