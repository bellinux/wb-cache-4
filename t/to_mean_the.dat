5|$|According to David Potter, Vaballathus {{inherited}} his father's exact titles. Hartmann {{points that}} there have been cases where a Greek word was translated directly to Palmyrene and a Palmyrene equivalent was also used <b>to</b> <b>mean</b> <b>the</b> same thing. The dedication to Odaenathus would be the using of a Palmyrene equivalent, while the inscription of Vaballathus would be the direct translation. Despite all the arguments, it cannot be certain without doubt that Odaenathus was a corrector.|$|E
5|$|Certain astronomical objects {{known as}} spiral nebulae such as M31 {{would later be}} {{recognized}} as conglomerations of stars when the true distance to these objects began to be discovered, {{and they would be}} deemed island universes. However, the word Universe was later understood <b>to</b> <b>mean</b> <b>the</b> entirety of existence, so this expression fell into disuse and the objects instead became known as galaxies.|$|E

30|$|Let us {{start with}} the {{definition}} of certainty. We follow Levhari and Weiss (1974) and interpret certainty in two alternative ways. First, we interpret it <b>to</b> <b>mean</b> that <b>the</b> future income of the individual is equal to its expected value. Alternatively, we interpret certainty <b>to</b> <b>mean</b> that <b>the</b> {{state of the world}} is known.|$|R
5|$|Yūgen (幽玄, {{profound}} sublimity): Yūgen is {{a concept}} valued in various forms of art throughout Japanese culture. Originally used to mean elegance or grace representing the perfect beauty in waka, yūgen is invisible beauty that is felt rather than seen in a work of art. The term is used specifically in relation to Noh <b>to</b> <b>mean</b> <b>the</b> profound beauty of the transcendental world, including mournful beauty involved in sadness and loss.|$|E
5|$|Distant {{regions of}} space {{are assumed to}} exist and {{to be part of}} reality as much as we are, even though we can never {{interact}} with them. The spatial region that we can affect and be affected by is the observable universe. The observable universe depends on the location of the observer. By traveling, an observer can come into contact with a greater region of spacetime than an observer who remains still. Nevertheless, even the most rapid traveler {{will not be able to}} interact with all of space. Typically, the observable universe is taken <b>to</b> <b>mean</b> <b>the</b> portion of the Universe that is observable from our vantage point in the Milky Way.|$|E
5|$|Later {{authors have}} used the term in a {{different}} sense, <b>to</b> <b>mean</b> <b>the</b> delimitation of species (not subspecies or taxa of other ranks), using whatever investigative techniques are available, and including sophisticated computational or laboratory techniques. Thus, Ernst Mayr in 1968 defined beta taxonomy as the classification of ranks higher than species.An understanding of the biological meaning of variation and of the evolutionary origin of groups of related species {{is even more important}} for the second stage of taxonomic activity, the sorting of species into groups of relatives ("taxa") and their arrangement in a hierarchy of higher categories. This activity is what the term classification denotes; it is also referred to as beta taxonomy.|$|E

5|$|Since {{dance is}} already an art form, “weapon dance as art” may seem redundant; yet, “art” is used here <b>to</b> <b>mean</b> <b>the</b> re-creation, say, of a folk weapon dance {{in a more}} {{professional}} staged venue, such as a ballet, or when an Australian, Native American, or African troupe of professional musicians and dancers present a reenactment on stage of a weapon dance, or when the use of weapons is introduced in stylized dance enactments of fighting. For example, recent ballets such as the New York City Ballet’s version of Romeo and Juliet (to the music of Sergei Prokofiev) employ highly choreographed sword-fight/dance sequences.|$|E
5|$|The Government of Singapore {{is defined}} by the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore <b>to</b> <b>mean</b> <b>the</b> Executive branch of government, which is made up of the President and the Cabinet of Singapore. Although the President acts in her {{personal}} discretion in the exercise of certain functions as a check on the Cabinet and Parliament of Singapore, her role is largely ceremonial. It is the Cabinet, composed of the Prime Minister and other Ministers appointed on his advice by the President, that generally directs and controls the Government. The Cabinet is formed by the political party that gains a simple majority in each general election.|$|E
5|$|The operas in the Bayreuth canon are {{the last}} ten of the {{thirteen}} that Wagner completed. He rejected the first three – Die Feen, Das Liebesverbot and Rienzi – as apprentice works. Although these have been staged elsewhere and Rienzi was very popular into the early 20th century, the works in the canon exceed them, both {{in the number of}} performances given and in the number of available recordings. The term Bayreuth canon is therefore sometimes taken <b>to</b> <b>mean</b> <b>the</b> composer's mature operas. Georg Solti was the first conductor to complete studio recordings of all the works in the canon, starting in 1958 with Das Rheingold and finishing in 1986 with Lohengrin.|$|E
5000|$|The phrase [...] "republican form (of government)" [...] in Article 139 {{has been}} {{interpreted}} broadly: it is read not only <b>to</b> <b>mean</b> that <b>the</b> head of state office cannot be hereditary, but also to encapsulates the principle of popular sovereignty. In other words, [...] "republic" [...] is interpreted <b>to</b> <b>mean</b> that <b>the</b> Italian Republic is also [...] "democratic".|$|R

25|$|The {{table below shows}} {{comparative}} gravitational accelerations at {{the surface}} of the Sun, the Earth's moon, each of the planets in the solar system. The “surface” is taken <b>to</b> <b>mean</b> <b>the</b> cloud tops of the gas giants (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune). For the Sun, the surface is taken <b>to</b> <b>mean</b> <b>the</b> photosphere. The values in the table have not been de-rated for the centrifugal effect of planet rotation (and cloud-top wind speeds for the gas giants) and therefore, generally speaking, are similar to the actual gravity that would be experienced near the poles.|$|E
2500|$|The Gemara {{taught that}} [...] {{provided}} {{the law of}} taking a beautiful captive only as an allowance for human passions. The Rabbis taught in a Baraita that taking a beautiful captive according to the strictures of [...] was better than taking beautiful captives without restriction, {{just as it was}} better for Jews to eat the meat of a ritually slaughtered ill animal than to eat the meat of an ill animal that had died on its own. The Rabbis interpreted the words [...] "and you see among the captives" [...] in [...] <b>to</b> <b>mean</b> that <b>the</b> provisions applied only if the soldier set his eye upon the woman when taking her captive, not later. They interpreted the words [...] "a woman" [...] in [...] <b>to</b> <b>mean</b> that <b>the</b> provisions applied even to a woman who was married before having been taken captive. They interpreted the words [...] "and you have a desire" [...] in [...] <b>to</b> <b>mean</b> that <b>the</b> provisions applied even if the woman was not beautiful. They interpreted the word [...] "her" [...] in [...] <b>to</b> <b>mean</b> that <b>the</b> provisions allowed him to take her alone, not her and her companion. They interpreted the words [...] "and you shall take" [...] in [...] <b>to</b> <b>mean</b> that <b>the</b> soldier could have marital rights over her. They interpreted the words [...] "to you to wife" [...] in [...] <b>to</b> <b>mean</b> that <b>the</b> soldier could not take two women, one for himself and another for his father, or one for himself and another for his son. And they interpreted the words [...] "then you shall bring her home" [...] in [...] <b>to</b> <b>mean</b> that <b>the</b> soldier could not molest her on the battlefield. Rav said that [...] permitted a priest to take a beautiful captive, while Samuel maintained that it was forbidden.–22a1. Brooklyn: Mesorah Publications, 1992[...]|$|R
30|$|In space science, we need <b>to</b> know <b>the</b> <b>mean</b> {{temperature}} on a planet. Unfortunately, it is {{very difficult}} <b>to</b> measure <b>the</b> <b>mean</b> temperature on a planet. Therefore, it is of theoretical significance <b>to</b> study <b>the</b> <b>mean</b> temperature on a planet by means of mathematics.|$|R
50|$|Although extreme {{individual}} measurements regress toward <b>the</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>the</b> second {{sample of}} measurements {{will be no}} closer <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mean</b> than <b>the</b> first. Consider the students again. Suppose their tendency is to regress 10% of the way toward <b>the</b> <b>mean</b> of 80, so a student who scored 100 the first day is expected to score 98 the second day, and a student who scored 70 the first day is expected to score 71 the second day. Those expectations are closer <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mean</b> than <b>the</b> first day scores. But the second day scores will vary around their expectations; some will be higher and some will be lower. This will make {{the second set of}} measurements farther from <b>the</b> <b>mean,</b> on average, than their expectations. The effect is the exact reverse of regression toward <b>the</b> <b>mean,</b> and exactly offsets it. So for every individual, we expect the second score to be closer <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mean</b> than <b>the</b> first score, but for all individuals, we expect the average distance from <b>the</b> <b>mean</b> <b>to</b> be <b>the</b> same on both sets of measurements.|$|R
25|$|The Thai {{name of the}} party, Prachathipat (ประชาธิปัตย์), {{is derived}} from the word prachathipatai (ประชาธิปไตย) which means democracy, {{democratic}} or democrat. The party said it wanted the term <b>to</b> <b>mean</b> <b>the</b> people in whom democracy is vested.|$|E
