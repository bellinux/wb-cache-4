5|$|Throughout the 1990s, {{progress}} accelerated {{towards a}} {{comprehensive test ban}} treaty (CTBT). Following a series of international meetings on the subject, the UN General Assembly approved resolution 50/64, which appealed for states to follow the PTBT and called for conclusion of the CTBT talks. In September 1996, the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty was signed and superseded the PTBT, though the PTBT is still in effect for states not party to the CTBT. The CTBT has yet to enter into force, as 8 required states have not ratified the treaty, including the US and China. France, Russia, and the UK have ratified the CTBT. <b>The</b> <b>technology</b> <b>for</b> detecting underground tests has significantly improved since the 1950s and 1960s, with monitors detecting tests down to 1 kiloton {{with a high degree of}} confidence.|$|E
