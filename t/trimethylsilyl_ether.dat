50|$|In {{this section}} of the Holton Taxol {{synthesis}} (Scheme 4), the oxetane D ring was completed and ring B was functionalized with the correct substituents. Allylic alcohol 34, obtained from deprotection of silyl enol ether 33 with hydrofluoric acid, was oxidized with osmium tetroxide in pyridine to give triol 35. After protection of the primary hydroxyl group, the secondary hydroxyl group in 36 was converted to a good leaving group using p-toluenesulfonyl chloride. Subsequent deprotection of the <b>trimethylsilyl</b> <b>ether</b> 37 gave tosylate 38, which underwent cyclization to give oxetane 39 by nucleophilic displacement of the tosylate that occurred with inversion of configuration.
