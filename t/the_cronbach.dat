30|$|A {{pre-test}} of {{the questionnaire}} was administered to 20 respondents randomly selected from the mobile telephone companies, <b>the</b> <b>Cronbach</b> alpha {{was used to test}} for consistency, and the table below (Table 2) shows the results of <b>the</b> <b>Cronbach</b> alpha test.|$|E
30|$|<b>The</b> <b>Cronbach</b> {{alpha of}} the {{composite}} variable is 0.59, indicating reasonably good internal consistency.|$|E
30|$|The {{internal}} consistency reliability of the three scales in NUEPS was determined {{in the study by}} calculating <b>the</b> <b>Cronbach’s</b> alpha reliability coefficient for the above sample. The results in Table  2 indicate that the {{internal consistency}} reliability ranged from 0.91 to 0.95 for the three NUEPS scales. For the whole scale, <b>the</b> <b>Cronbach’s</b> alpha (α) value was 0.98, and the half-split reliability of the scale was 0.93. For the ‘STA’ sub-dimension, <b>the</b> <b>Cronbach’s</b> alpha (α) value was 0.95, with a half-split reliability of 0.93. For <b>the</b> ‘SRP’, <b>the</b> <b>Cronbach’s</b> alpha (α) value was 0.95, and the half-split reliability was 0.90. Finally, for the ‘LAPI’ sub-dimension, <b>the</b> <b>Cronbach’s</b> alpha (α) value was 0.92, and the half-split reliability was 0.90. Thus, the {{internal consistency reliability}} of the measures used in this study can be considered as favorable.|$|R

3000|$|The {{findings}} above {{reveal that}} Cronbach alpha coefficient of LAKS in total was [...]. 91 {{which is a}} highly satisfactory value, and it shows that LAKS has a statistically high reliability {{to be used as}} a measurement tool. When the table is examined, it is also seen that <b>the</b> <b>Cronbach</b> alpha value for assessing reading appeared to be [...]. 88, again referring to a high level of reliability. <b>The</b> <b>Cronbach</b> alpha coefficient for assessing listening sub-construct was obtained as [...]. 78, which means that the scale has internal consistency at an acceptable level. <b>The</b> <b>Cronbach</b> alpha coefficient calculated for assessing writing sub-construct was found out as [...]. 49. Since the value is below the acceptable limit of [...]. 60 (Hulin et al. 2001), this construct resulted in a lower confidence in internal consistency. Finally, <b>the</b> <b>Cronbach</b> alpha coefficient for assessing speaking was found to be [...]. 65, which is again an acceptable value for the internal consistency.|$|E
30|$|<b>The</b> <b>Cronbach</b> alpha values {{found in}} study I (α[*]=[*]. 79) and in study II (α[*]=[*]. 78) {{are lower than}} the {{original}} version’s alpha value (α[*]=[*]. 90) (Przybylski et al., 2013) and than the alpha values of Spanish (α[*]=[*]. 85) and English (α[*]=[*]. 91) versions of the scale. However, these values are within the acceptable levels and very close to <b>the</b> <b>Cronbach</b> alpha value of the first Turkish version of the scale (α[*]=[*]. 81) by Gökler et al. (2016).|$|E
30|$|To {{check the}} {{reliability}} of {{the second part of the}} questionnaire, <b>the</b> <b>Cronbach</b> alpha test was used to measure internal consistency for each category.|$|E
3000|$|Reliability for the {{mathematics}} motivation scale was estimated by computing <b>the</b> <b>Cronbach’s</b> Alpha (α = . 83). This coefficient demonstrated high reliability for the scale. Further, {{an examination of}} “Cronbach’s Alpha if Item Deleted” suggested that <b>the</b> <b>Cronbach’s</b> Alpha increases to [...]. 84 upon deletion of two items in the scale. However, these items were retained since this increase was not significant enough to warrant their removal from the scale.|$|R
30|$|<b>The</b> <b>Cronbach’s</b> alpha {{measure of}} {{internal}} consistency reliability yielded satisfactory scores {{for each of the}} subscales and the entire scale.|$|R
30|$|<b>The</b> <b>Cronbach’s</b> α {{coefficient}} at 0.93 showed strong internal consistency. This result similar with Dutch and Greek versions (> 0.90). That {{seems the}} questionnaire is strongly reliable because <b>the</b> <b>Cronbach’s</b> α value > 0.70 {{but a little}} excessive similar with Dutch and Greek versions. The test–retest reliability (r =  0.80) was high and comparable {{with the findings of}} Dutch version (ICC 2 : 1 : 0.86) (Biemans et al. 2011; Erevnidou et al. 2004).|$|R
30|$|The MSPSS {{was used}} to measure the level of {{perceived}} social support from family, friends, and significant others. It contains 12 items and each item is rated on a 7 point scale. (Zimet et al. 1988). All items are added and then divided by 12 for the total score. High scores indicate a high degree of perceived social support. Its validity and reliability in Turkey was performed by Eker and Arkar (1995) and <b>the</b> <b>Cronbach</b> alpha was 0.89 (Eker and Arkar 1995). In this this study <b>the</b> <b>Cronbach</b> alpha was found to be 0.88.|$|E
30|$|This is a {{self-reported}} scale {{originally developed}} {{to indicate the}} possible presence of anxiety and depression states (Zigmond and Snaith 1983). It contains two subscales (one for anxiety and the one for depression) and 14 items. Total scores for each subscale range from 0 to 21, and higher scores represent greater anxiety or depression. The Turkish version of this scale was assessed by Aydemir et al. (1997) for its validity and reliability (Aydemir et al. 1997). Aydemir et al. (1997) stated that <b>the</b> <b>Cronbach</b> alpha was 0.85 and 0.77 for anxiety and depression subscales respectively. In this study <b>the</b> <b>Cronbach</b> alpha was 0.84 in the anxiety subscale and 0.80 in the depression subscale.|$|E
30|$|<b>The</b> <b>Cronbach</b> alpha {{coefficient}} for the Kujala, Fulkerson, Larsen and Lysholm scores ranged between 0.091 and 0.930, indicating excellent internal consistency.

30|$|To provide {{evidence}} that {{the components of the}} scale are sufficiently inter-correlated and that the grouped items measure <b>the</b> underlying variable, <b>Cronbach’s</b> alpha was employed. <b>The</b> <b>Cronbach’s</b> alpha reliability coefficient normally ranges between 0 (worst) and 1 (best).|$|R
30|$|Reliability. Following EFA, an {{internal}} consistency {{analysis was performed}} by determining <b>the</b> <b>Cronbach’s</b> coefficient alpha for each factor identified (DeVellis 2003).|$|R
3000|$|To ensure reliability, this {{research}} used Cronbach alpha coefficient to test reliability. <b>The</b> <b>Cronbach’s</b> coefficient alpha ranges from 0 to 1.

3000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Cronbach’s</b> alpha {{coefficient}} estimated for {{the instrument and}} subscales was acceptable and reached the target reliability of at least [...]. 70 (Garson, 2005;Lewicki & Hill, 2006).|$|R
30|$|In {{addition}} to the model fit indices and SMC, we also checked {{the reliability of the}} latent constructs. Reliability is referred to by <b>the</b> value of <b>Cronbach’s</b> Alpha. <b>The</b> <b>Cronbach’s</b> Alpha (Cronbach, 1951) values of the constructs LP and ST are 0.97 and 0.86, respectively; both values exceed the required level of 0.70 as suggested by Nunnally (1978). This also confirms internal consistency of the latent constructs (Garver and Mentzer, 1999).|$|R
30|$|The entire survey {{instrument}} was checked and examined for reliability using Cronbach Alpha {{and the result}} was 0.79, indicating a good internal consistency of the questionnaire items. <b>The</b> <b>Cronbach</b> Alpha coefficient is usually used in computing the reliability of a {{survey instrument}}.

30|$|This section {{details the}} full {{results of the}} entire work. The results of the {{additional}} research questions are included. A total of 86 questionnaires were analysed. To estimate {{the reliability of the}} research instrument, its internal consistency was measured using standardized Cronbach’s alpha which is also known as the coefficient alpha. This was calculated on different sections of the questionnaire, because they measured separate entities of the SQA and also had different Likert scales. For the section that measures quality control and standards, <b>the</b> <b>cronbach</b> alpha was 0.734, for the section that measured quality planning, <b>the</b> <b>cronbach</b> alphas was 0.689 while it was 0.809 for the section that measured the challenges. In the interpretation of cronbach alpha, 0.00 means no consistency, 1.0 means perfect consistency, and any value from 0.70 implies acceptable consistency, as such we can conclude that the research instrument is internally consistent, therefore reliable.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{develop and}} {{validate}} {{the design of}} a grid that assesses doctor-patient relationship skills. DESIGN: Evaluation study of an assessment instrument. SETTING: Private practices and family practice units. PARTICIPANTS: From a sample of volunteers, 100 family physicians either in private practice or in a family practice unit completed the proposed grid independently. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: <b>The</b> <b>Cronbach</b> alpha coefficient was used to analyze internal consistency. Factorial analysis was used to determine whether the grid's anticipated dimensions were in fact present. RESULTS: <b>The</b> <b>Cronbach</b> alpha coefficient had a very high value (0. 92), indicating that the items in the grid were highly homogeneous. Two key factors emerged from the factorial analysis; the first factor alone (understanding patients' experience) accounted for almost 42 % of the variance. CONCLUSION: The proposed grid presents some interesting metrologic qualities. It is short and relatively simple to use to assess relationship skills of future and practising family physicians. The grid must now be further validated using a variety of cases...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis {{study was}} {{conducted}} {{to examine the relationship between}} chemistry preservice teachers’ self-esteem and emotional intelligence levels. The sampling was consisted of 230 pre-service teachers studying at Hacettepe University, Faculty of Education. In order to reveal their self-esteem Self-Esteem Inventory was administered to chemistry preservice teachers. This inventory was developed by Coopersmith (1967) and adapted to Turkish by Pişkin (1997). The modified inventory was consisted of 25 items. <b>The</b> <b>Cronbach</b> Alpha internal consistency coefficient was calculated for the SEI as 0. 86.
