However, C. perfringens has been most studied as the causative agent of a range of enteric and soft tissue infections of varying severities in humans and animals. Host preference and disease type in C. perfringens are intimately linked to the production of key extracellular toxins and on this basis toxigenic C. perfringens strains have been classified into five toxinotypes (A–E). To date, twelve genome sequences have been generated for a diverse collection of C. perfringens isolates, including strains associated with human and animal infections, a human commensal strain, and a strain with potential industrial utility.

When toxinotyped, 35 strains were determined to be <b>toxinotype</b> 0, whereas 21 strains showed variations in toxin genes and could be grouped into 11 variant toxinotypes. Six of the toxinotypes had been described before (I, III, IV, VIII, IX, and XII). In addition, five new toxinotypes were defined (XVI to XX). Three of the new toxinotypes (XVIII, XIX, and XX) vary only in repetitive regions of tcdA and produce both toxins. In two strains from toxinotypes XVI and XVII, the production of TcdA could not be detected with commercial immunological kits. Strain J 9965 (<b>toxinotype</b> XVII) was in PaLoc similar but not identical to another known A−B+ strain, C. difficile 8864. Strain SUC 36 (<b>toxinotype</b> XVI), on the other hand, was similar to well-defined group consisting of toxinotypes V, VI, and VII, which thus far includes only A+B+ strains. Toxinotypes XVI and XVII represent two new groups of A−B+ strains. Strains of the well-known A−B+ group from <b>toxinotype</b> VIII have a nonsense mutation {{at the beginning of}} tcdA gene, and the introduction of a stop codon at amino acid position 47 results in nonproduction of TcdA.

This study investigated the genetic diversity of 70 toxigenic C. difficile isolates from two Korean hospitals by employing <b>toxinotyping,</b> ribotyping, multilocus sequence typing (MLST), and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Toxin gene amplification resulted in 68 A⁺B⁺ and two A-B+ isolates. Most isolates (95. 7 - 100 %) were susceptible to daptomycin, metronidazole, and vancomycin. Seventy C. difficile isolates were classified into five <b>toxinotypes,</b> 19 ribotypes, 16 sequence types (STs), and 33 arbitrary pulsotypes. All C. difficile isolates of ribotype 018 (n = 38) were classified into ST 17, which was the most prevalent ST in both hospitals. However, C. difficile isolates of ST 17 (ribotype 018) exhibited pulsotypes that differed by hospital. ST 2 (ribotype 014 / 020), 8 (ribotypes 002), 17 (ribotype 018), and 35 (ribotypes 015) were detected in both hospitals, whereas other STs were unique to each hospital. Statistical comparison of the different typing methods revealed that ribotyping and PFGE were highly predictive of STs. In conclusion, our epidemiological study indicates that C. difficile infections in both hospitals are associated with the persistence of endemic clones coupled with the emergence of many unique clones.

40|$|Abstract Background Clostridium difficile {{infection}} (CDI) is {{an important}} cause {{of morbidity and mortality}} internationally, yet there are important regional differences in the epidemiology and microbiology of disease. Most reports have come from North America and Europe, with limited information from other regions, including the Middle East. Given the changes in the epidemiology of CDI in developed countries, particularly associated with the dissemination of hypervirulent epidemic clones, an understanding of the epidemiology and microbiology of CDI in diverse regions is warranted. This study involved collection of stool samples from individuals with diarrhea at the Isfahan University of Medical Sciences Teaching Hospital, Isfahan, Iran, between October 2010 and March 2011. Selective enrichment culture for C. difficile was performed and isolates were characterised using ribotyping, PCR for the detection of tcdA, tcdB and cdtB genes, and tcdC sequence analysis. Findings Clostridium difficile was isolated from 19 / 89 (21 %) stool samples of 17 / 86 (20 %) patients. 13 / 17 (77 %) cases of CDI were hospital-associated. Patients with CDI were significantly older (43 ± 28 y) than those with non-CDI diarrhea (24, ± 26 y) (P = 0. 018). All isolates were toxigenic, and possessed genes encoding for toxins A and B. Six (32 %) of 19 isolates also possessed cdtB. Twelve ribotypes were identified. Ribotype 078 /toxinotype V was most common, accounting for 4 (21 %) of isolates. A single isolate of a different <b>toxinotype</b> V ribotype was identified, as was a <b>toxinotype</b> XXIV isolate. The remaining isolates consisted of 9 different <b>toxinotype</b> 0 ribotypes. Conclusions CDI {{is an important}} cause of diarrhea in patients in this hospital. The diversity of ribotypes was striking, and the number of different types suggests the presence of a broad range of strains in the community, the hospital or both. The predominance of <b>toxinotype</b> V strains, which have been associated with community-associated disease and food animals, was unexpected and possible sources of this type require further investigation. </p...|$|E
40|$|Outbreaks due to Clostridium difficile {{polymerase}} {{chain reaction}} (PCR) ribotype 027, <b>toxinotype</b> III, were detected in 7 hospitals in the Netherlands from April 2005 to February 2006. One hospital experienced {{at the same time}} a second outbreak due to a toxin A–negative C. difficile PCR ribotype 017 <b>toxinotype</b> VIII strain. The outbreaks are difficult to control. Since March 2003, outbreaks of severe cases of Clostridium difficile–associated disease (CDAD) were reported in hospitals in Montreal and Quebec (1, 2). Increased virulence was suspected, since the proportion of patients with CDAD who died within 30 days after diagnosis rose from 4. 7 % in 1991 – 1992 to 13. 8 % in 2003 (1). In addition, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported a growing threat of CDAD in US hospitals and found the strain to be associated with high illness and death rates during hospital outbreaks in 11 states (3). The increased virulence was considered to be associated with the production of a binary toxin and an increased production of toxins A and B (4). Further characterization of this strain showed that it belonged to <b>toxinotype</b> III, pulsedfield gel electrophoresis (PFGE) type NAP 1, restriction endonuclease analysis group BI, and {{polymerase chain reaction}} (PCR) ribotype 027 (2, 3). Toxinotyping involves detecting polymorphisms in the toxin A and B and surrounding regulatory genes, an area of the genome known collectively as the pathogenicity locus or PaLoc (5). By toxinotyping, 24 different types can be recognized, whereas the library of PCR ribotypes comprises 116 distinct types of C. difficile identified on the basis of differences in amplification profiles generated (6). The PCR ribotype 027, <b>toxinotype</b> III, strain is resistant to ciprofloxacin and the newer generation of fluoroquinolones, such as gatifloxacin, levofloxacin, and moxifloxacin (3). Exposure of patients to fluoroquinolones and cephalosporins is recognized as a risk factor for CDAD caused by 027 (2, 3).

Of 411 isolates from diarrhoeagenic patients with suspected C. difficile-associated diarrhoea (CDAD), 354 were toxigenic, of which 86 (24. 3 %) were toxin-variant strains. Major <b>toxinotypes</b> included <b>toxinotypes</b> 0 (n = 268), V (n = 28), VIII (n = 22) and III (n = 25). MICs of metronidazole, vancomycin, erythromycin, clindamycin, moxifloxacin and tetracycline were determined using the Etest method. All the toxigenic strains were fully-susceptible to metronidazole and vancomycin. Resistance to erythromycin, clindamycin, tetracycline and moxifloxacin was found in 44. 4 %, 46. 1 %, 9. 2 % and 37. 5 % of the isolates, respectively. Sixty-six different PCR ribotypes were characterised, with the 027 epidemic strain accounting for 6. 2 % of isolates. This strain was positive for binary toxin genes, had an 18 -bp deletion in the tcdC gene, and was resistant to both erythromycin and moxifloxacin. The mean incidence of CDAD was 2. 45 cases/ 10 000 patient-days, but this figure varied widely among the participating hospitals. Patients infected with the 027 strain {{were more likely to have}} a severe disease (OR 3. 29, 95 % CI 1. 19 – 9. 16, p 0. 008) and to have been specifically treated with metronidazole or vancomycin (OR 7. 46, 95 % CI 1. 02 – 154, p 0. 02). Ongoing epidemiological surveillance of cases of CDAD, with periodic characterisation of the strains involved, is required to detect clustering of cases in time and space and to monitor the emergence of specific highly virulent clones...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: Comorbidity with Clostridium difficile {{may cause}} {{diagnostic}} delay in newly presenting {{inflammatory bowel disease}} (IBD) patients, trigger relapse in established disease, confound therapies, and serve {{as an indicator of}} an underlying defect in innate immunity. Retrospective analyses have suggested community acquisition; to address this we conducted a prospective analysis of C. difficile carriage in IBD patients using molecular methods specifically in an outpatient setting. METHODS: Recruited participants had long-standing diagnoses of ulcerative colitis (n = 64) and Crohn's disease (n = 58), were in clinical remission, and had no recent exposure to antibiotics, corticosteroids, immunomodulatory drugs or recent hospitalization. Isolates were cultured from stools and confirmed by 16 S sequencing. The antibiotic susceptibilities of the isolates were tested followed by further strain characterization by <b>toxinotyping,</b> ribotyping, and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). RESULTS: The frequency of toxigenic C. difficile was higher in IBD patients than in healthy volunteers at 8. 2 and 1. 0...|$|R
40|$|The {{strains of}} Clostridium {{perfringens}} are classified according to major toxins produced. Classically, this determination involves the seroneutralization of their lethal effect in mice. However, this method requires specific antisera {{and a large}} number of mice. In this work, a new typing method was developed based on the amplification of toxin genes by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). By combination of several pairs of primers, the <b>toxinotype</b> of a Cl. perfringens strain was determined by looking at the pattern of bands on an agarose gel electrophoresis. This mixture contained primers amplifying simultaneously a part of alpha-toxin, beta-toxin, epsilon-toxin and enterotoxin genes. In order to distinguish between <b>toxinotype</b> A and E, the l-toxin gene fragment must be amplified in a separate PCR reaction. Moreover, with the primers combination, in most cases, a PCR product corresponding to the alpha-toxin gene was obtained from direct enrichments of animal intestinal contents. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|To {{determine}} {{the presence of}} Clostridium difficile, we sampled cooked and uncooked meat products sold in Tucson, Arizona. Forty-two percent contained toxigenic C. difficile strains (either ribotype 078 /toxinotype V [73 %] or 027 / <b>toxinotype</b> III [NAP 1 or NAP 1 -related; 27 %]). These findings indicate that food products {{may play a role}} in interspecies C. difficile transmission...|$|E
40|$|Using 42 {{isolates}} {{contributed by}} laboratories in Canada, The Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and the United States, {{we compared the}} results of analyses done with seven Clostridium difficile typing techniques: multilocus variable-number tandem-repeat analysis (MLVA), amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP), surface layer protein A gene sequence typing (slpAST), PCR-ribotyping, restriction endonuclease analysis (REA), multilocus sequence typing (MLST), and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). We assessed the discriminating ability and typeability of each technique {{as well as the}} agreement among techniques in grouping isolates by allele profile A (AP-A) through AP-F, which are defined by <b>toxinotype,</b> the presence of the binary toxin gene, and deletion in the tcdC gene. We found that all isolates were typeable by all techniques and that discrimination index scores for the techniques tested ranged from 0. 964 to 0. 631 in the following order: MLVA, REA, PFGE, slpAST, PCR-ribotyping, MLST, and AFLP. All the techniques were able to distinguish the current epidemic strain of C. difficile (BI/ 027 /NAP 1) from other strains. All of the techniques showed multiple types for AP-A (<b>toxinotype</b> 0, binary toxin negative, and no tcdC gene deletion). REA, slpAST, MLST, and PCR-ribotyping all included AP-B (<b>toxinotype</b> III, binary toxin positive, and an 18 -bp deletion in tcdC) in a single group that excluded other APs. PFGE, AFLP, and MLVA grouped two, one, and two different non-AP-B isolates, respectively, with their AP-B isolates. All techniques appear to be capable of detecting outbreak strains, but only REA and MLVA showed sufficient discrimination to distinguish strains from different outbreaks...|$|E
40|$|Clostridium difficile is {{the leading}} cause of antibiotic-associated {{diarrhea}} in hospitals worldwide, due to hypervirulent epidemic strains with the ability to produce increased quantities of the large toxins TcdA and TcdB. Unfortunately, accurate quantification of TcdA and TcdB from different <b>toxinotypes</b> using small samples has not yet been reported. In the present study, we quantify C. difficile toxins in < 0. 1 [*]mL of culture filtrate by quantitative label-free mass spectrometry (MS) using data-independent analysis (MSE). In addition, analyses of both purified TcdA and TcdB as well as a standard culture filtrate were performed using gel-based and gel-independent proteomic platforms. Gel-based proteomic analysis was then used to generate basic information on toxin integrity and provided sequence confirmation. Gel-independent in-solution digestion of both toxins using five different proteolytic enzymes with MS analysis generated broad amino acid sequence coverage (91 % for TcdA and 95 % for TcdB). Proteomic analysis of a culture filtrate identified a total of 101 proteins, among them TcdA, TcdB, and S-layer proteins...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA {{total of}} 227 Staphylococcus aureus colonies, {{isolated}} from 54 samples of raw milk {{and dairy products}} of bovine, ovine, caprine and bubaline origin were tested {{for the presence of}} genes coding for staphylococcal enterotoxins (SEs/SEls) and for methicillin resistance. Ninety-three colonies, from 31 of the 54 samples (57. 4 %) and from 18 (69. 2 %) of the 26 farms of origin tested positive for SEs/SEls genes. Most isolates harboured more than one toxin gene and 15 different <b>toxinotypes</b> were recorded. The most frequent were “sec” gene alone (28. 6 %), “sea, sed, ser, selj” (20 %), “seg, sei” and “seh” (8. 6 %). The 77 colonies harbouring “classical enterotoxins” genes (sea-sed) were further tested for enterotoxin production, which was assessed for 59. 2 % of the colonies. Three methicillin-resistant S.  aureus (MRSA) isolates were detected in three different ovine milk/dairy product samples (1. 3 %). All isolates belonged to spa type t 127, sequence type 1, clonal complex 1, SCCmec type IVa...|$|R
40|$|Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) is {{a common}} causative agent of pseudomembranous colitis (PMC). C. difficile-associated {{diarrhea}} (CDAD) ranges from mild diarrhea to life threatening PMC. Recently, a highly virulent strain of C. difficile polymerase chain reaction ribotype 027 was found in North America, Europe, and Japan. A 52 -yr-old woman with anti-tuberculosis medication and neurogenic bladder due to traffic accident experienced five episodes of C. difficile PMC after taking antibiotics for pneumonia along with septic shock and acute renal failure. She was readmitted to {{the intensive care unit}} and treated with oral vancomycin with refractory of oral metronidazole, inotropics and probiotics for over 60 days. C. difficile isolated both at the first and the last admission was identified as C. difficile ribotype 027 by ribotyping, <b>toxinotyping,</b> and tcdC gene sequencing, which turned out the same pathogen as the epidemic hypervirulent B 1 /NAP 1 strain. This is the first case of C. difficile PCR ribotype 027 in Korea. After discharge, she was maintained on probiotics and rifaximin for 3 weeks. She had no relapse for 6 months...|$|R
