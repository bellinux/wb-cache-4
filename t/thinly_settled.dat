The evidence they {{provide for the}} incomplete integration of the two populations is supported by research into placename history, the history of religious houses, and local archaeology, which indicates that {{the western part of}} Wessex was <b>thinly</b> <b>settled</b> by the Germanic newcomers at the time the laws were issued. It is notable that, although issued by the Saxon king of a Saxon kingdom, the term used in the laws to define Ine's Germanic subjects is Englisc. This reflects the existence, even at this early date, of a common English identity encompassing all the Germanic peoples of Britain.|$|E
25|$|The French Canadians {{get their}} name from Canada, the most {{developed}} and densely populated region of New France {{during the period}} of French colonization in the 17th and 18th century. The original use of the term Canada referred to the land area along the St. Lawrence River, divided in three districts (Québec, Trois-Rivières, and Montréal), {{as well as to the}} Pays d'en Haut (Upper Countries), a vast and <b>thinly</b> <b>settled</b> territorial dependence north and west of Montreal which covered the whole of the Great Lakes area.|$|E
25|$|When cotton {{was king}} during the 1850s, Mississippi {{plantation}} owners—especially {{those of the}} Delta and Black Belt central regions—became wealthy due to the high fertility of the soil, {{the high price of}} cotton on the international market, and their assets in slaves. They used the profits to buy more cotton land and more slaves. The planters' dependence on hundreds of thousands of slaves for labor and the severe wealth imbalances among whites, played strong roles both in state politics and in planters' support for secession.

2500|$|A {{number of}} early {{settlers}} worked small {{farms in the}} area, many of them near the lakeshore. [...] Mary Dennis, Max Dusham, Charles Beaubien, Simon Doyle, Wendal Alles, Joel Stebbins, and Arunah Hill {{were among the most}} prominent members of this <b>thinly</b> <b>settled</b> community, and some of their descendants remained in the area for generations. In the 1850s and 1860s, more prosperous entrepreneurs from New York State and the Eastern seaboard bought out many of these settlers. Among them were Alexander McDaniel (who had arrived in the 1830s, then returned from the California gold rush with money to invest), John G. Westerfield, Henry Dingee, and John Gage. During this period, Illinois more generally was experiencing a high degree of land speculation and settlement.|$|E
2500|$|Both {{before and}} after the War of 1812, the {{government}} of Upper Canada continued to fear what it suspected might be a growing interest in American-inspired republicanism in the province. Reasons for this {{can be found in the}} pattern of settlement across the province over the previous half-century. Although the British had originally hoped that an orderly settlement in Upper Canada would inspire the former American colonies to abandon their republican form of government, demographic realities intervened. After an initial group of about 70,000 United Empire Loyalists were <b>thinly</b> <b>settled</b> across the province in the mid-1780s, a far larger number of American settlers came after Lieutenant-Governor John Graves Simcoe offered cheap land grants to promote settlement. Although these settlers, known as [...] "late-Loyalists," [...] were required to take an oath of allegiance to the Crown in order to obtain land, their fundamental political allegiances were always considered dubious. By 1812, this had become acutely problematic since the American settlers outnumbered the original Loyalists by more than ten to one. It was this reality that led American legislators to speculate that bringing Upper Canada into the American fold would be a [...] "mere matter of marching." [...] Following the war, the colonial government took active steps to prevent Americans from swearing allegiance, thereby making them ineligible to obtain land grants. Relations between the appointed Legislative Council and the elected Legislative Assembly became increasingly strained in the years after the war, over issues of immigration, taxation, banking and land speculation.|$|E

60|$|For eight {{long years}} he had {{struggled}} and labored; changing his occupation several times, but always living in the city; always making his home in a boardinghouse or a hotel. His pluck and energy had had its reward, {{and for the past}} three {{years he had}} held a responsible and well-paid position in a mercantile house. But his life and his work had for him nothing but a passing interest; he had no sympathy with bonded warehouses, invoices, and ledgers. All he could look forward to was a higher position, a larger salary, and, when Miriam should graduate, a little home somewhere where she could keep house for him. In his dreams of this home, he would sometimes place it in the suburbs, where Sundays and holidays spent in country air would compensate for hasty breakfasts, early morning trains, and late ones in the afternoon. But when he reflected that it would not do to leave his young sister alone all day in a <b>thinly</b> <b>settled,</b> rural place, at the mercy of tramps, he was forced to the conclusion that the thing for them to do was to live in a city apartment. But there was nothing in either of these outlooks to create fervent longings in the soul of Ralph Haverley.|$|E
60|$|In the evening, {{instead of}} {{liberating}} our ponies as usual, we took and tethered {{them in the}} plantation, and next morning about three o'clock we crept cautiously {{out of the house}} and set off on our adventure. It was a winter morning, misty and cold when the light came, and the birds were excessively wild at that hour. In vain we followed the flocks, my brother stalking them through the sedges, above his knees in the water; not a bird could he get, and at last we were obliged to go back empty-handed to face the music. At half-past ten we rode to the door, wet and hungry and miserable, to find the whole house in a state of commotion at our disappearance. When we were first missed in the morning, one of the workmen reported that he had seen us taking our horses to conceal them in the plantation at a little after dark, and it was assumed that we had run away--that we had gone south where the country was more <b>thinly</b> <b>settled</b> and wild animals more abundant, in quest of new and more stirring adventures. They were greatly relieved to see us back, but as we had no ducks to placate them we could not be forgiven, and as a punishment we had to go breakfastless that day, and our leader was in addition sternly lectured and forbidden to use a gun for the future.|$|E
60|$|The fox {{takes up}} his {{residence}} in a vizcachera, and succeeds, after some quarrelling (manifested in snarls, growls, and other subterranean warlike sounds), in ejecting the rightful owners {{of one of}} the burrows, which forthwith becomes his. Certainly the vizcachas are not much injured by being compelled to relinquish the use {{of one of the}}ir kennels for a season or permanently; for, if the locality suits him, the fox remains with them always. Soon they grow accustomed to the unwelcome stranger; he is quiet and unassuming in demeanour, and often in the evening sits on the mound in their company, until they regard him with the same indifference they do the burrowing owl. But in spring, when the young vizcachas are large enough to leave their cells, then the fox makes them his prey; and if it is a bitch fox, with a family of eight or nine young to provide for, she will grow so bold as to hunt her helpless quarry from hole to hole, and do battle with the old ones, and carry off the young in spite of them, so that all the young animals in the village are eventually destroyed. Often when the young foxes are large enough to follow their mother, the whole family takes leave of the vizcachera where such cruel havoc has been made to settle in another, there to continue their depredations. But the fox has ever a relentless foe in man, and meets with no end of bitter persecutions; it is consequently much more abundant in desert or <b>thinly</b> <b>settled</b> districts than in such as are populous, so that in these the check the vizcachas receive from the foxes is not appreciable.|$|E
6000|$|It {{was one of}} {{the adventures}} met with by the man of the tale in his travels that came into my mind when I was in the Booth Museum, and caused me to smile. In his wanderings in a <b>thinly</b> <b>settled</b> district, he arrived at a village where, passing by the church, his {{attention}} was attracted by a curious spectacle. The church was a big building with a rounded roof, and great blank windowless walls, and the only door he could see was no larger than the door of a cottage. From this door as he looked a small old man came out with a large empty sack in his hands. He was very old, bowed and bent with infirmities, and his long hair and beard were white as snow. Toddling out {{to the middle of the}} churchyard he stood still, and grasping the empty sack by its top, held it open between his outstretched arms for a space of about five minutes; then with a sudden movement of his hands he closed the sack's mouth, and still grasping it tightly, hurried back to the church as fast as his stiff joints would let him, and disappeared within the door. By and by he came forth again and repeated the performance, and then again, until the traveller approached and asked him what he was doing. [...] "I am lighting the church," [...] said the old man; and he then went on to explain that it was a large and a fine church, full of rich ornaments, but very dark inside--so dark that when people came to service the greatest confusion prevailed, and they could not see each other or the priest, nor the priest them. It had always been so, he continued, and it was a great mystery; he had been engaged by the fathers of the village a long time back, when he was a young man, to carry sunlight in to light the interior; but though he had grown old at his task, and had carried in many, many thousands of sackfuls of sunlight every year, it still remained dark, and no one could say why it was so.|$|E
6000|$|Not so, however, {{with the}} {{products}} of non-competing industrial [...] groups. As shown by Mr. Mill, labor does not pass freely from one [...] employment to another; {{and it must be}} said that capital does not [...] either, although vastly more ready to move than labor. In a large [...] and <b>thinly</b> <b>settled</b> country capital does not move freely over the [...] whole area of industry; if it did, different rates of profit would [...] not prevail, as we all know they do, in the United States. Now, as [...] before stated, the total value of the commodities resulting from [...] the exertions of each group of producers is the source from which [...] wages and profits are drawn. The aggregate wages and profits in [...] each industry will vary with the value of the aggregate products. [...] But this total value depends upon what it will exchange for of the [...] products of other groups; that is, this value depends on the [...] reciprocal demand of one group for the commodities of the other [...] groups, as compared with the demand of the other groups for its [...] products. For example, although cost of production is low in group [...] A, if the demand from outside groups were to be strong, the [...] exchange value of A’s products would rise, and A would get more of [...] other goods in exchange; that is, the total produce is large, but [...] a second increment, arising from a higher exchange value, is to be [...] shared among A’s laborers and capitalists. A few years ago, about [...] 1878-1879, the value of wheat in the United States rose because of [...] the increased demand from Europe, where the harvests had been [...] unusually deficient. There had been no falling off in the [...] productiveness of the farming industry of the United States to [...] cause the increased price; but the relative demand of other [...] industrial groups for wheat, the product of the farming industry, [...] raised the exchange value of wheat, and so increased the [...] industrial rewards of those engaged as laborers and capitalists in [...] farming. So it is to be concluded that since there is no free [...] movement of labor and capital between non-competing groups, wages [...] and profits may constantly remain at rates which are not in [...] correspondence with the actual sacrifice, or cost, to labor and [...] capital in different groups; hence, their products do not exchange [...] for each other in proportion to their costs of production. [...] Reciprocal demand is the law of their value.|$|E
