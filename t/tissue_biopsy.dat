5|$|A {{definitive}} {{diagnosis of}} TB {{is made by}} identifying M. tuberculosis in a clinical sample (e.g., sputum, pus, or a <b>tissue</b> <b>biopsy).</b> However, the difficult culture process for this slow-growing organism can take two to six weeks for blood or sputum culture. Thus, treatment is often begun before cultures are confirmed.|$|E
5|$|Occasionally {{neuroblastoma}} {{may be due}} to a mutation {{inherited from}} a person's parents. Environmental factors have not been found to be involved. Diagnosis is based on a <b>tissue</b> <b>biopsy.</b> Occasionally it may be found in a baby by ultrasound during pregnancy. At diagnosis the cancer has usually already spread. The cancer is divided into low, intermediate, and high risk groups based on a child's age, cancer stage, and what the cancer looks like.|$|E
25|$|The {{cause is}} {{generally}} unclear. Risk factors include family history, obesity, {{and not enough}} exercise. Diagnosis is typically based on a physical exam. Occasionally medical imaging or <b>tissue</b> <b>biopsy</b> is used to confirm the diagnosis.|$|E

25|$|Diagnosis {{is usually}} {{made on the}} {{clinical}} appearance {{without the need for}} a <b>tissue</b> <b>biopsy.</b> However, when biopsies have been taken, the histologic appearance is one of marked elongation and hyperparakeratosis of the filiform papillae and numerous bacteria growing on the epithelial surface.|$|E
25|$|Diagnosis {{is made by}} {{the doctor}} {{on the basis of}} a medical history, {{physical}} examination, and special investigations which may include a chest x-ray, CT or MRI scans, and <b>tissue</b> <b>biopsy.</b> The examination of the larynx requires some expertise, which may require specialist referral.|$|E
25|$|In {{patients}} {{incapable of}} producing a sputum sample, common alternative sample sources for diagnosing pulmonary tuberculosis include gastric washings, laryngeal swab, bronchoscopy (with bronchoalveolar lavage, bronchial washings, and/or transbronchial biopsy), and fine needle aspiration (transtracheal or transbronchial). In some cases, a more invasive technique is necessary, including <b>tissue</b> <b>biopsy</b> during mediastinoscopy or thoracoscopy.|$|E
40|$|The leakage of {{metabolites}} from {{frozen and}} thawed <b>tissue</b> <b>biopsies</b> was measured semi-quantitatively by high-field (8. 5 T) proton MRS. Human prostate and rat brain tissue specimens, frozen within 1  min of collection, lost significant and variable amounts of diagnostic metabolites immediately upon thawing. For prostate tissue 30 – 50 % of initial total choline compounds, total creatines and citrate were {{detected in the}} collection buffer immediately after thawing. The widely used protocol for MR assessment of <b>tissue</b> <b>biopsies,</b> which involves washing of thawed tissue samples in fresh buffer, results in loss of large and unpredictable amounts of possibly diagnostic metabolites prior to MRS. This reduces the reproducibility of MR analysis of <b>tissue</b> <b>biopsies</b> and compromises the reliable identification of MR spectral patterns diagnostic of tissue pathology. The problem can be avoided by minimizing the volume of storage buffer, omitting tissue washing and performing MRS measurements on the tissue immersed in the original storage buffer...|$|R

40|$|A {{prospective}} {{study to determine}} the feasibility and cost effectiveness of fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) was done in Ndanda and Morogoro (the peripheral hospitals) and Muhimbili the national referral hospital in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. All patients with breast lump(s) who presented at the surgical outpatient clinic(s) or surgical ward(s) in these three hospitals were studied from November 1993 to August 1995. Fine needle aspiration smears from the peripheral hospitals, were posted to Muhimbili for staining and interpretation by the pathologist. The surgeons followed these patients with open <b>tissue</b> <b>biopsies.</b> For Muhimbili patients aspiration {{was done in the}} pathology cytology laboratory by the pathologist, whereas <b>tissue</b> <b>biopsies</b> were sent to the laboratory by the surgeons after operation. For both smears and <b>tissue</b> <b>biopsies,</b> dates of posting from peripheral hospital, receiving (taking in, in case of <b>tissue</b> <b>biopsies)</b> at the pathology laboratory, making diagnosis and getting cytology or histology report by the surgeon were noted by the author in each patient through collaboration with the surgeons. Th~ mean number of days taken for each procedure was calculated from the day of aspiration or operation. iii A total of the 256 FNAC paients were studied, of these 206 (80. 5 %) were from Muhimbili, 41 (16. 0 %) from Morogoro and 9 (3. 5 %) were from Ndanda. Of the 256 FNAC patients, 86 (33. 6 %) had traceable <b>tissue</b> <b>biopsies.</b> Results showed that compared to <b>tissue</b> <b>biopsies</b> FNAC significantly reduced the mean number of days in posting, receiving specimens at the laboratory, making diagnosis and getting report. seventy three (28. 5 %) patients who had adequate cytological material and had histological follow up, were analyzed to assess the accuracy of FNAC compared to histological diagnosis. FNAC was found to be a highly accurate method in diagnosis of palpable breast masses with an accuracy of 95. 8 %, sensitivity of 94. 8 % and specificity of 97. 0 %. Cost effectiveness analysis indicated that FNAC was highly cost effective, reducing the cost of diagnosing breast masses in peripheral hospitals by 63. 3 % and 60. 2 % for one outpatient and inpatient respectively. The respective cost reduction at Muhimbili referral hospital were 70. 4 % and 65. 7 % for one outpatient and inpatient. Therefore FNAC provides a rapid, accurate and cheap method of accurately diagnosing breast lumps. The findings {{of this study suggest that}} FNAC should be recommended for diagnosis of breast lumps in all hospitals in Tanzania...|$|R
25|$|The {{cause is}} {{typically}} unknown. It {{is believed to}} be due to genetic susceptibility that is triggered by an environmental factor such that an autoimmune disease occurs. This results in the destruction of skin pigment cells. Risk factors include a family history of the condition or other autoimmune diseases, such as hyperthyroidism, alopecia areata, and pernicious anemia. It is not contagious. Vitiligo is classified into two main types: segmental and non-segmental. Most cases are non-segmental, meaning they affect both sides; and in these cases, the affected area of the skin typically expands with time. About 10% of cases are segmental, meaning they mostly involve one side of the body; and in these cases, the affected area of the skin typically does not expand with time. Diagnosis can be confirmed by <b>tissue</b> <b>biopsy.</b>|$|E
25|$|Greater than 80% of {{mesothelioma}} {{cases are}} caused by exposure to asbestos. The greater the exposure the greater the risk. As of 2013 about 125 million people {{have been exposed to}} asbestos at work. High rates of disease occur in people who mine asbestos, produce products from asbestos, work with asbestos products, live with asbestos workers, or work in buildings containing asbestos. Asbestos exposure and the onset of cancer are generally separated by about 40 years. Washing the clothing of someone who worked with asbestos also increases the risk. Other risk factors include genetics and infection with the simian virus 40. The diagnosis may be suspected based on chest X-ray and CT scan findings, and is confirmed by either examining fluid produced by the cancer or by a <b>tissue</b> <b>biopsy</b> of the cancer.|$|E
25|$|In extrapulmonary TB, {{surgery is}} often {{needed to make}} a {{diagnosis}} (rather than to effect a cure): surgical excision of lymph nodes, drainage of abscesses, <b>tissue</b> <b>biopsy,</b> etc. are all examples of this. Samples taken for TB culture should be sent to the laboratory in a sterile pot with no additive (not even water or saline) and must arrive in the laboratory as soon as possible. Where facilities for liquid culture are available, specimens from sterile sites may be inoculated directly following the procedure: this may improve the yield. In spinal TB, surgery is indicated for spinal instability (when there is extensive bony destriction) or when the spinal cord is threatened. Therapeutic drainage of tuberculous abscesses or collections is not routinely indicated and will resolve with adequate treatment. In TB meningitis, hydrocephalus is a potential complication and may necessitate the insertion of a ventricular shunt or drain.|$|E

25|$|Microscopic {{identification}} of eggs in stool or urine {{is the most}} practical method for diagnosis. Stool examination should be performed when infection with S. mansoni or S. japonicum is suspected, and urine examination should be performed if S. haematobium is suspected. Eggs can {{be present in the}} stool in infections with all Schistosoma species. The examination can be performed on a simple smear (1 to 2mg of fecal material). Since eggs may be passed intermittently or in small amounts, their detection will be enhanced by repeated examinations and/or concentration procedures. In addition, for field surveys and investigational purposes, the egg output can be quantified by using the Kato-Katz technique (20 to 50mg of fecal material) or the Ritchie technique. Eggs {{can be found in the}} urine in infections with S. haematobium (recommended time for collection: between noon and 3 PM) and with S. japonicum. Quantification is possible by using filtration through a nucleopore filter membrane of a standard volume of urine followed by egg counts on the membrane. <b>Tissue</b> <b>biopsy</b> (rectal biopsy for all species and biopsy of the bladder for S. haematobium) may demonstrate eggs when stool or urine examinations are negative.|$|E

As part of an IRBapproved molecular profiling registry trial of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) patients, we facilitated blood-based NGS testing of 34 patients from multiple community-based and high-volume academic oncology practices. 23 of these patients also underwent traditional tumor tissue-based NGS testing. cfDNA was not detected in 9 / 34 (26 %) patients. Overall concordance between blood and tumor tissue NGS assays was low, with only 25 % sensitivity of blood-based NGS for tumor tissue NGS. Mutations in KRAS, the major PDA oncogene, were only detected in 10 / 34 (29 %) blood samples, compared to 20 / 23 (87 %) tumor <b>tissue</b> <b>biopsies.</b> The presence of mutations in circulating DNA was associated with reduced overall survival (54 % in mutation-positive versus 90 % in mutation-negative).

40|$|INTRODUCTION: We {{recently}} reported macrophage accumulation in adipose tissue of critically ill patients. Classically activated macrophage accumulation in adipose tissue is a known feature of obesity, {{where it is}} linked with increasing insulin resistance. However, the characteristics of adipose tissue macrophage accumulation in critical illness remain unknown. METHODS: We studied macrophage markers with immunostaining and gene expression in visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue from healthy control subjects (n= 20) and non-surviving prolonged critically ill patients (n= 61). For comparison, also subcutaneous in vivo adipose <b>tissue</b> <b>biopsies</b> were studied from 15 prolonged critically ill patients. RESULTS: Subcutaneous and visceral adipose <b>tissue</b> <b>biopsies</b> from nonsurviving prolonged critically ill patients displayed a large increase in macrophage staining. This staining corresponded with elevated gene expression of "alternatively activated" M 2 macrophage markers arginase- 1, IL- 10 and CD 163 {{and low levels of}} the "classically activated" M 1 macrophage markers tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -alpha and inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS). Immunostaining for CD 163 confirmed positive M 2 macrophage staining in both visceral and subcutaneous adipose <b>tissue</b> <b>biopsies</b> from critically ill patients. Surprisingly, circulating levels and tissue gene expression of the alternative M 2 activators IL- 4 and IL- 13 were low and not different from controls. In contrast, adipose tissue protein levels of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma PPARgamma a nuclear receptor required for M 2 differentiation and acting downstream of IL- 4, was markedly elevated in illness. In subcutaneous abdominal adipose <b>tissue</b> <b>biopsies</b> from surviving critically ill patients, we could confirm positive macrophage staining with CD 68 and CD 163. We also could confirm elevated arginase- 1 gene expression and elevated PPARgamma protein levels. CONCLUSIONS: Unlike obesity, critical illness evokes adipose tissue accumulation of alternatively activated M 2 macrophages, which have local anti-inflammatory and insulin sensitizing features. This M 2 macrophage accumulation may contribute to the previously observed protective metabolic activity of adipose tissue during critical illness. status: publishe...|$|R
