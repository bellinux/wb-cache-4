25|$|Fuel {{economy was}} notably {{improved}} for the 1986 Riviera, but {{the investment in}} the downsized, <b>transverse</b> <b>engine</b> front wheel drive platform resulted in a substantial price increase, to $19,831 to the base model and $21,577 for the new T-Type. Downsizing also resulted in a dimensional similarity to smaller, less expensive offerings from GM, with shared styling cues reinforcing the unfortunate resemblance.|$|E
25|$|The 2.5 TL was {{positioned}} as the sporty {{model and the}} 3.2 focused more upon a luxurious ride. There were minimal styling differences between the two, but the 3.2 TL had larger tires despite the 2.5 TL's more sporty marketing. Moreover, the added power in the 3.2 TL gave it better acceleration. The V6 engine in the 3.2 TL was mounted in a front-rear, or longitudinal position. This contrasted with the more typical <b>transverse</b> <b>engine</b> mount style, and was intended to provide better weight distribution and reduce nose dive. The engine mount design resulted in an elongated hood for the first generation TL. The inline-5 engine in the 2.5 TL competed with similar 5-cylinder engines offered in Audi and Volvo models.|$|E
50|$|The <b>transverse</b> <b>engines</b> {{began the}} 60° family in 1980. Like {{the rest of}} the Generation I engines, they were updated in 1985 with larger main {{journals}} for durability, along with multi-point fuel injection or E2SE carb and OBD I. Production of the Generation I <b>transverse</b> <b>engines</b> ended in 1986.|$|R

50|$|It was {{originally}} {{based on the}} engineering concept of the Volkswagen Golf Mk1, and is applicable to either front- or four-wheel drive vehicles, using only front-mounted <b>transverse</b> <b>engines.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{front-wheel drive}} Medallion used the 2.2L I4 engine that also powered the European Renault 25. It was mounted in a {{longitudinal}} (front-back) configuration, driving {{the front wheels}} through either a 5-speed manual transmission or a 3-speed computer-controlled automatic. The longitudinal engine placement is unusual for a front-wheel drive car, as the <b>transverse</b> <b>engine</b> layout is typically more space-efficient. It {{was one of a}} few cars with this layout, which helps reduce torque steering. The gearbox is centrally mounted resulting in equal-length axle shafts. In Europe, Renault 21 versions with engine displacements below 2L had transverse engines, just like smaller models such as the Renault 9. Higher-end R 21 versions with engines of 2L or more, retained the longitudinal layout of the previous Renault 20 and 30 series. The longitudinally mounted versions had a shorter wheelbase than the European transverse versions. Product plans also called for a four-wheel drive Medallion to be imported in late-1988.|$|E

2500|$|General Motors and Ford Motor Company cooperated in 2002 {{to create}} a new {{automatic}} transaxle, designed for <b>transverse</b> <b>engine</b> applications in cars. The companies jointly committed to investing US$720 million in their manufacturing plants to support the new transmission.|$|E
50|$|The {{longitudinal}} versions had minor {{differences from}} the <b>transverse</b> <b>engines</b> {{on which they}} were based. This group appeared in 1982 with the LC1 and LR2 and never added the aluminum heads of the Generation II engines.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Transverse</b> <b>engines</b> {{have also}} been widely used in buses. In the United States they were offered in the early 1930s by Twin Coach and used with limited success in Dwight Austin's Pickwick Nite-Coach. <b>Transverse</b> bus <b>engines</b> first {{appeared}} widely in the Yellow Coach 719, using Dwight Austin's V-drive; they continued in common use until the 1990s, though shorter V-configuration engines in a straight in [...] "T-drive" [...] configuration became common in the 1960s. They were also used in the British Leyland Atlantean and in many transit buses and nearly all modern double decker buses. They {{have also been}} widely used by Scania, MAN, Volvo and Renault's bus divisions.|$|R
50|$|In 1959, Saab had an {{experimental}} car with two <b>transverse</b> straight-three <b>engines</b> bolted together — the Saab Monster.|$|R
2500|$|The Autobianchi Primula is a {{supermini}} {{economy car}} manufactured between 1964 and 1970 by the Italian automaker Autobianchi, a now defunct {{subsidiary of the}} Fiat Group. The Primula was Fiat's first model with {{rack and pinion steering}} and is widely known for its innovative Dante Giacosa-designed front-wheel drive, <b>transverse</b> <b>engine</b> layout [...] that would be later popularized by the Fiat 128 to ultimately become an industry-standard front drive layout.|$|E
2500|$|BMC {{experimented with}} a {{twin-engine}} Mini Moke (dubbed the [...] "Twini Moke") in the mid-1960s, but never {{put it into}} production. This made advantage of the Mini's 'power pack' layout, with a <b>transverse</b> <b>engine</b> and the gearbox in the engine sump. Simply by fitting a second engine/gearbox unit across the rear, a rudimentary 4×4 system could be produced. Early prototypes had separate gear levers and clutch systems for each engine. Later versions sent for evaluation by the British Army had more user-friendly linked systems.|$|E
2500|$|The Trabant ( [...] ; [...] ) is an {{automobile}} which was produced from 1957 to 1990 by former East German car manufacturer VEB Sachsenring Automobilwerke Zwickau in Zwickau, Saxony. Although {{it is often}} seen as symbolic of the defunct East Germany {{and the collapse of}} the Eastern Bloc in general, it was a sought-after car in East Germany before the fall of the Berlin Wall. The Trabant had a hard plastic body mounted on a one-piece steel chassis (a so-called unibody or monocoque), front-wheel drive, a <b>transverse</b> <b>engine,</b> and independent suspension—unusual features at that time.|$|E

50|$|But the {{original}} ancestor was the AR4 transmission, deployed on Renault vehicles with longitudinal engines (4 and 6 cylinders) in the 1980s : R25, R21 and Espace. Two different versions for <b>transverse</b> <b>engines</b> {{were developed in}} the early 1990s : AD4 for 4 cylinders (Renault Clio, Mégane, Laguna, Safrane) and AD8 for 6 cylinders (Renault Laguna, Safrane). Both 096 and 01M VW transmissions {{are similar to the}} AD4, and many parts are interchangeable.|$|R
2500|$|Crossover (or CUV): A loose {{marketing}} term {{to describe}} a vehicle that blends features of a SUV with features of a car — especially forgoing the body on frame construction of the SUV {{in favor of the}} [...] car's unibody or monocoque construction. Crossovers usually borrow drivetrains and other parts from traditional cars in the same manufacturer's line. Crossovers typically employ an FF layout or an FF-based four-wheel drive layout with a <b>transverse</b> <b>engine,</b> rather than an FR layout or an FR-based 4WD layout with a longitudinal engine as is typically used on traditional truck-based SUVs.|$|E
2500|$|The Primula was favorably {{received}} in the marketplace, and came second in the 1965 European Car of the Year contest, after another front-wheel drive car, the Austin 1800. [...] This convinced Fiat to develop the drive concept further. In 1969 the first Fiat with a front-mounted <b>transverse</b> <b>engine,</b> the Fiat 128, was launched, along with two new front-wheel drive Autobianchis: the Autobianchi A112, smaller than the Primula, and the larger Autobianchi A111. The 128 secured Fiat the Car of the Year title in 1970, with A112 coming second. [...] Primula production ceased in 1970, by which time 74,858 had been built.|$|E
2500|$|The Primula's {{particular}} {{configuration of}} {{front wheel drive}} and <b>transverse</b> <b>engine,</b> but with a gearbox {{on the end of}} the engine, ingenious Fiat-designed clutch release mechanism and unequal length drive shafts, rather than a gearbox in the sump like the Mini, has become universal among front-wheel-drive cars, as did its use of conventional steel suspension in almost all other cars except Citroens: usually McPherson struts at the front and a [...] "dead" [...] rear axle. The Primula is thus a car design of far greater significance than is often realised, as its design influence spread, far beyond even the mainstream high volume Fiats such as the 127 and the 128 of the late 1960s which used its driveline layout; to every front wheel drive transverse engined car in production today.|$|E
50|$|The Ultradrive is a 4-speed {{automatic}} transmission from Chrysler Corporation. It was produced starting in 1989. It was originally paired primarily with the Mitsubishi 3.0 (6G72) engine in vehicles with <b>transverse</b> <b>engines.</b> In 1991, it was expanded {{to work with}} the Chrysler 3.3 & 3.8 V6 engines in Dodge Caravan/Grand Caravan, Plymouth Voyager/Grand Voyager, Chrysler Town & Country, Dodge Dynasty & Chrysler New Yorker. The Ultradrive was produced at Kokomo Transmission in Kokomo, Indiana, a plant which still makes front wheel drive Chrysler {{automatic transmission}}s.|$|R
5000|$|MQB {{is not a}} {{platform}} as such, but, rather, a system for introducing rationality to different platforms that have <b>transverse</b> <b>engines,</b> regardless of model, vehicle size or brand. Thus MQB uses a core [...] "matrix" [...] of components across {{a wide variety of}} platforms [...] - [...] for example, sharing a common engine-mounting core for all drivetrains (e.g., gasoline, diesel, natural gas, hybrid and purely electric). As well as reducing weight, the concept allows different models to be manufactured at the same plant, further saving cost.|$|R
50|$|Modern {{inline-four}} motorcycle engines {{first became}} popular with Honda's SOHC CB750 in the 1970s. Since then, the inline-four {{has become one}} of the most common engine configurations in street bikes. Outside of the cruiser category, the inline-four is the most common configuration because of its relatively high performance-to-cost ratio. All major Japanese motorcycle manufacturers offer motorcycles with inline-four engines, as do MV Agusta and BMW. BMW's earlier inline-four motorcycles were mounted horizontally along the frame, but all current four-cylinder BMW motorcycles have <b>transverse</b> <b>engines.</b> The modern Triumph company has offered inline-four-powered motorcycles, though they were discontinued in favour of triples.|$|R
2500|$|The compact {{engine and}} the <b>transverse</b> <b>engine</b> {{combined}} with a body wider than the class average to provide a level of interior space comparable to larger cars such as Peugeot's own 404: [...] both cars were Pininfarina designs. The 204 featured neither the fins of the 404 nor the sharp corners characteristic of the other major French launch of 1965. The resulting less aggressive look {{has been seen as}} a 'more European' moving away from a tendency to follow US styling trends that had been apparent in new car launches during the preceding two decades. The Peugeot 204's frontal styling owes much to the 1961 Cadillac Jacqueline by Pininfarina, whilst its rear and that of the prototype Pininfarina styled Mini-based MG ADO 34 of 1964 are strikingly similar. The rear end of the 1970 Lancia Flavia Pininfarina Coupe of 1969–74 also displays the same influence.|$|E
2500|$|As {{soon as the}} car and {{the engine}} became reliable, the era of the Lotus and of Jim Clark began. Clark won the title twice in three years, [...] and , the latter being the only {{occasion}} to date of a driver winning both the Championship and the Indianapolis 500-Mile Race in the same year. For 1964 Lotus introduced the new Lotus 33 and Ferrari made considerable technological and financial effort to win the title. Ferrari used no less than three different engines in the season—the existing V6, a V8 and a flat-12, while Lotus was struggling with the teething troubles of a new car. The title went to John Surtees and Ferrari. Surtees' title was especially notable, as he became the only driver ever to win the World Championship for both cars and motorcycles. The 1965 Mexican Grand Prix, the last race of the 1.5 litres Formula One, saw Richie Ginther giving Honda its first victory {{at the end of a}} season that was otherwise disappointing for the Japanese newcomer. This was the first victory by a Japanese car and, as of today, the only one by a car powered by a <b>transverse</b> <b>engine.</b>|$|E
60|$|Their {{secrecy and}} {{swiftness}} and inventions had far surpassed {{those of the}} Germans, and where the Germans had had a hundred men at work the Asiatics had ten thousand. There came to their great aeronautic parks at Chinsi-fu and Tsingyen by the mono-rails that now laced the whole surface of China a limitless supply of skilled and able workmen, workmen far above the average European in industrial efficiency. The news of the German World Surprise simply quickened their efforts. At {{the time of the}} bombardment of New York it is doubtful if the Germans had three hundred airships all together in the world; the score of Asiatic fleets flying east and west and south must have numbered several thousand. Moreover the Asiatics had a real fighting flying-machine, the Niais as they were called, a light but quite efficient weapon, infinitely superior to the German drachenflieger. Like that, it was a one-man machine, but it was built very lightly of steel and cane and chemical silk, with a <b>transverse</b> <b>engine,</b> and a flapping sidewing. The aeronaut carried a gun firing explosive bullets loaded with oxygen, and in addition, and true to the best tradition of Japan, a sword. Mostly they were Japanese, and it is characteristic that from the first it was contemplated that the aeronaut should be a swordsman. The wings of these flyers had bat-like hooks forward, by which they were to cling to their antagonist's gas-chambers while boarding him. These light flying-machines were carried with the fleets, and also sent overland or by sea to the front with the men. They were capable of flights of from two to five hundred miles according to the wind.|$|E
50|$|Based, as they were, on the Fiat Group's Tipo Due (Type Two) platform, the 145 and 146 had a unibody structure, front MacPherson strut {{and rear}} {{trailing}} arm suspensions. A peculiarity of these cars {{is that they}} were designed to be fitted with both longitudinal engines (the older Boxers) and with <b>transverse</b> <b>engines</b> (the diesels and the Twin Spark). The former were mounted in the same configuration as on the 33 or Alfasud, that is longitudinally overhanging the front axle with the gearbox towards the cabin; the latter in the conventional transverse position with the gearbox to the left side. All engines were coupled to 5-speed manual transmissions.Steering was rack and pinion, with standard hydraulic power assistance.|$|R
50|$|Although {{the other}} models were {{executive}} cars, the Croma was marketed {{in the large}} family car segment, replacing the Fiat Argenta in the Fiat lineup. The Croma was the first large car produced by Fiat to feature a <b>transverse</b> mounted <b>engine</b> and front wheel drive.|$|R
50|$|Developed {{at the end}} of the 90s in Turin, Italy, the Mini {{platform}} {{was designed}} to be adaptable to the city car of Fiat Group. Mini platform replaced the old Panda platform (code project Type Zero or Tipo Zero in Italian) and all components are totally new, and were made to be adaptable to more types of small vehicles (including hatchback, convertible and crossover SUV). The frame makes heavy use of high-strength steel. Mini platform is applicable to either front- or four-wheel drive vehicles, using only front-mounted <b>transverse</b> <b>engines.</b> The standard version was designed for MacPherson strut front suspension and torsion beam rear suspension but the four wheel drive version was re-engineered with independent semi-trailing arms rear suspension and electronic Limited slip differential.|$|R
50|$|The Critchley light car, {{made by the}} Daimler Motor Company in 1899, had a <b>transverse</b> <b>engine</b> with {{belt drive}} to the rear axle. A 1911 front-wheel drive car had a <b>transverse</b> <b>engine</b> with a clutch at each end, driving the front wheels directly.|$|E

50|$|In {{the early}} 1980s this {{transmission}} {{was developed for}} urban buses in the UK as the Maxwell, with a four-speed gearbox. UK buses are mostly double-deckers with rear-mounted <b>transverse</b> <b>engines.</b> Their use also involves much stop-start driving, thus heavy clutch wear for conventional gearboxes. The advantage of this arrangement was its use of four clutches, all easily serviced from outside the engine assembly, without needing to remove the engine. The clutches were multi-plate oil-supplied wet clutches. The first gearboxes gained a reputation for unreliability and in 1985 the original developers, Brockhouse, licensed them to Avon Maxwell Transmissions. A developed version, with an enlarged oil pump, was available as a retrofit for most UK buses. An unusual feature of this gearbox was the ability to engage first and second gear simultaneously. This acted as a 50 hp hydraulic retarder.|$|R
