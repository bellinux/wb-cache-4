40|$|OBJECTIVES: The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} the effectiveness of Samarium 153 -particulate hydroxyapatite radiation synovectomy in rheumatoid arthritis patients with chronic knee synovitis. METHODS: Fifty-eight rheumatoid arthritis patients (60 knees) with chronic knee synovitis participated in a controlled double-blinded trial. Patients were randomized to receive either an intra-articular injection with 40 mg <b>triamcinolone</b> <b>hexacetonide</b> alone (TH group) or 40 mg <b>triamcinolone</b> <b>hexacetonide</b> combined with 15 mCi Samarium 153 -particulate hydroxyapatite (Sm/TH group). Blinded examination at baseline (T 0) and at 1 (T 1), 4 (T 4), 12 (T 12), 32 (T 32), and 48 (T 48) weeks post-intervention were performed on all patients and included a visual analog scale for joint pain and swelling as well as data on morning stiffness, flexion, extension, knee circumference, Likert scale of improvement, percentage of improvement, SF- 36 generic quality of life questionnaire, Stanford Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ), Lequesne index, use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or oral corticosteroids, events and adverse effects, calls to the physician, and hospital visits. RESULTS: The sample was homogeneous at baseline, and there were no withdrawals. Improvement was observed in both groups in relation to T 0, but no statistically significant differences between groups were observed regarding all variables at the time points studied. The Sm/TH group exhibited more adverse effects at T 1 (p< 0. 05), but these were mild and transitory. No severe adverse effects were reported during follow-up. CONCLUSION: Intra-articular injection of Samarium 153 -particulate hydroxyapatite (15 mCi) with 40 mg of <b>triamcinolone</b> <b>hexacetonide</b> is not superior to <b>triamcinolone</b> <b>hexacetonide</b> alone for the treatment of knee synovitis in patients with rheumatoid arthritis at 1 y of follow-up.

40|$|BACKGROUND—Samarium- 153 {{particulate}} hydroxyapatite (Sm- 153 PHYP) is {{a relatively}} new radiation synovectomy agent developed for the treatment of chronic synovitis. Although {{it has been shown that}} the levels of unwanted extra-articular radiation are lower after intra-articular injection of Sm- 153 PHYP than yttrium- 90 colloid, its clinical efficacy has not been rigorously studied.  OBJECTIVES—To establish whether Sm- 153 PHYP radiation synovectomy results in a clinically useful benefit sustained at one year.  METHODS—In a randomised double blind study, patients received either intra-articular 40  mg <b>triamcinolone</b> <b>hexacetonide</b> alone or 40  mg <b>triamcinolone</b> <b>hexacetonide</b> combined with Sm- 153 PHYP in an outpatient clinic.  RESULTS—Sixty patients (28  male, 32  female), median age 51  (18 - 75) with chronic knee synovitis were studied. Diagnoses included: rheumatoid arthritis (n= 29); psoriatic arthritis (n= 9); ankylosing spondylitis (n= 3); reactive arthritis (n= 2); undifferentiated seronegative oligoarthritis (n= 13) and miscellaneous inflammatory conditions (n= 4). More patients who received Sm- 153 PHYP/triamcinolone hexacetonide sustained clinical benefit a year after treatment compared with patients who received corticosteroid alone (12  of 31  (39 %) v 6  of 29  (21 %), a difference of 18 % more patients (95 % CI − 5 % to 41 %)) though the difference was not significant (χ 2 = 2. 31, 0. 2 >p> 0. 1, n= 60). Despite the variation in injected activity (median 563  MBq, range 218 - 840 MBq), there was no obvious relation between low levels of injected activity (p> 0. 1, n= 31).  CONCLUSIONS—There was no clear beneficial clinical effect of combined Sm- 153 PHYP/triamcinolone hexacetonide injection over <b>triamcinolone</b> <b>hexacetonide</b> alone a year after treatment for chronic knee synovitis. ...|$|E

30|$|The second {{lesson is}} that the 2 tested corticosteroids, both {{frequently}} used {{in the treatment of}} OA, have differential effects on the viscosupplement properties. Cortivazol has no significant impact on HA properties. The decrease in viscosity is only slightly greater than that obtained with PBS. Conversely <b>triamcinolone</b> <b>hexacetonide</b> seems to stabilize the viscosupplement, suggesting that the increase in viscosity, results from the existence of favourable interactions between HA and triamcinolone. Thus, if a corticosteroid should be injected together with a viscosupplement, it seems logical to favour the second rather than the first, as long as it has not been demonstrated this does not affect the clinical outcome.|$|E

There were three withdrawals prior to the injections. Regarding the pain, there was a significantly better response in the Y/TH Group versus the Sm/TH Group at T 1 (p= 0. 025) and versus TH alone at T 48 (p= 0. 026). the Sm/TH group had more adverse effects (p= 0. 042), but these were mild and transitory. for the pain parameter alone, Yttrium- 90 radiosynovectomy associated to TH proved superior to Samarium- 153 hydroxyapatite radiosynovectomy associated to TH at T 1 and to synovectomy with TH at T 48.

Sixty wrists were included and randomized to receive low dose (20 mg) or high dose (40 mg). the outcomes assessed in T 0, T 1, T 4, T 8, and T 12 weeks were visual analog scale for pain and for swelling, chronic disease activity index, goniometry, simplified Stanford Health Assessment Questionnaire, and side effects. Results: Baseline mean (standard deviation) values were pain visual analog scale of 6. 1 (1. 6) and 6. 3 (1. 7), P = 0. 562; swelling visual analog scale of 5. 9 and 6. 4, P = 0. 466; chronic disease activity index of 17. 8 and 16. 8, P = 0. 366; and Health Assessment Questionnaire of 0. 8 and 0. 7, P = 0. 238, in the high-and low-dose groups, respectively.

We aimed to investigate whether oral methotrexate increases the efficacy of intra-articular corticosteroid therapy. METHODS: We did this prospective, open-label, randomised trial at ten hospitals in Italy. Using a concealed computer-generated list, children younger than 18 years with oligoarticular-onset disease were randomly assigned (1 : 1) to intra-articular corticosteroids alone or in combination with oral methotrexate (15 mg/m 2; maximum 20 mg). Corticosteroids used were <b>triamcinolone</b> <b>hexacetonide</b> (shoulder, elbow, wrist, knee, and tibiotalar joints) or methylprednisolone acetate (ie, subtalar and tarsal joints). We did not mask patients or investigators to treatment assignments.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare {{clinical}} evaluation of the site of hindfoot synovitis with contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings in children with juvenile chronic arthritis (JCA), and to evaluate the ecacy of selective guided intra-articular steroid injections. Thirteen symptomatic ankles of 11 consecutive JCA patients were examined clinically and with contrast-enhanced MRI. Pannus was demonstrated on MRI in both tibio-talar and sub-talar joints in 10 ankles, in the tibio-talar joint only in one ankle and in neither joint in two ankles. Correlation of clinical and MRI findings was good for the tibio-talar joint with concordance in 11 / 13 cases. Correlation was poor for the sub-talar joints. Of the 10 sub-talar joints shown to have pannus on MRI, only two were thought to have had definite clinical evidence of synovitis. Guided intra-articular steroid injection resulted in at least 6 months remission in 6 / 9 ankles compared with 1 / 10 ankles which had had previous unguided injections. We therefore recommend the use of image guidance for intra-articular <b>triamcinolone</b> <b>hexacetonide</b> injection in children with hindfoot synovitis...|$|E
40|$|Central giant-cell granulomas are benign, but {{occasionally}} aggressive, lesions that traditionally {{have been treated}} surgically. 21 cases of central giant-cell granuloma of the jaw were treated with intralesional injection of corticosteroids. The treatment protocol adopted was intralesional injection of 20 mg/ml <b>triamcinolone</b> <b>hexacetonide</b> diluted in an anaesthetic solution of 2 % lidocaine/epinephrine 1 : 200, 000 in the proportion 1 : 1; 1. 0 ml of the solution was infiltrated for every 1 cm(3) of radiolucid area of the lesion, totalling 6 biweekly applications. Ten patients had aggressive lesions and 11 nonaggressive. Two patients showed a negative response to the treatment and underwent surgical resection, 4 showed a moderate response and 15 a good response. 8 of the 19 who had a moderate-to-good response to the drug treatment underwent osteoplasty to reestablish facial aesthetics. In these cases, only mature or dysplastic bone was observed, with {{the presence or absence}} of rare giant multinucleated cells. The advantages of this therapy are its less-invasive nature, the probable lower cost to the patient, lower risk and the ability to treat the lesion surgically in the future, if necessary...|$|E
40|$|Ten {{posterior}} subtalar joints of 8 {{patients with}} rheumatoid arthritis and 12 posterior subtalar joints of 6 cadavers were studied by contrast synoviography. In the rheumatoid group the abnormalities included posterior capsule distension, filling defects caused by hypertrophic synovitis, limited or irregular filling of the anterior recess {{of the joint}} in 5 out of 10, and communication with the ankle joint in 3 out of 10. None of the cadaveric joints showed posterior capsule distension or limited or irregular filling of the anterior recess of the joint, but communication with the ankle was present in 2 joints. The joints of the patients were injected with a 1 : 1 mixture of sodium iothalamate 70 % (Conray 420) and <b>triamcinolone</b> <b>hexacetonide</b> (Lederspan) 20 mg/ml. All patients noticed a decrease in and an improvement in walking beginning 24 - 48 hours after the examination.

40|$|Juvenile {{idiopathic}} arthritis (JIA) is {{the most}} common chronic rheumatic condition in childhood and an important cause of short and long term disability. Oligoarthritis is defined as an arthritis that affects four o fewer joints during the first 6 months of disease. The large majority of patients within this category belongs to a quite well defined disease which is not observed in adults. It is characterized by an early onset (before 6 years of age), an asymmetric arthritis involving mainly large joints, a female predilection, a high frequency of positive antinuclear antibodies (ANA), a high risk for developing chronic iridocyclitis and consistent HLA associations. We describe 3 clinical cases who presented monoarthritis of the elbow as early sign of oligoarticular JIA. All patients showed inflammatory markers elevation and 2 / 3 were ANA positive. MRI showed the presence of synovial inflammation without bone involvement. Intraarticular <b>triamcinolone</b> <b>hexacetonide,</b> led to remission in one case, while in the other two there was a re-activation of the disease treated with NSAIDs and/or MTX. The reported cases represent 0. 6 % of 490 patients with JIA followed by our unit in the last 10 years. Cases of exclusive involvement of the elbow at onset of JIA in literature are rare. Therefore, we report 3 cases of monoarthritis of the elbow as initial sign of oligoarticular JIA, a very atypical onset of this disease.

40|$|AbstractObjectivesIdentify good {{response}} predictors to intra-articular injection (IAI) with <b>triamcinolone</b> <b>hexacetonide</b> (TH). MethodsThis {{study was}} carried out in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients (American College of Rheumatology criteria) submitted to IAI (mono, pauci or polyarticular injection). Assessmenta “blinded” observer prospectively evaluated joints at one week (T 1), four weeks (T 4), twelve weeks (T 12) and 24 weeks (T 24) after IAI. Outcome measurements included Visual Analogue Scale (0 - 10 cm) at rest, in movement and for swollen joints. Clinical, demographic and variables related to injection at baseline were analyzed according to IAI response. ResultsWe studied 289 patients with RA (635 joints) {{with a mean age of}} 48. 7 years (± 10. 68), 48. 5 % of them Caucasians, VAS for global pain= 6. 52 (± 1. 73). Under univariate analysis, the variables relating the best responses following IAI (improvement > 70 %) were: “elbow and metacarpophalangeal (MCP) IAI, and functional class II”. Under multivariate analysis, “males” and “non-whites” were the predictors with the best response to IAI at T 4, while “elbow and MCP IAI”, “polyarticular injection”, “use of methotrexate” and “higher total dose of TH” obtained the best response at T 24. ConclusionSeveral predictors of good response to IAI in patients with RA were identified. The best-response predictors for TH IAI of long term were “inject elbow and MCP IAI” and “perform polyarticular injection”...|$|E
40|$|Glucocorticoids {{have been}} the {{mainstay}} of treatment {{for many years in}} systemic-onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA), causing important side effects and some difficulties in the management of this disease. Until the introduction of biologic agents, oral glucocorticoids were used to control fever and other systemic features for several months or even years if systemic manifestations persisted. Nowadays, clinicians have valid alternatives that have revolutionized the natural history of sJIA. Biologic agents, such as the interleukin- 1 inhibitors anakinra and the more recent canakinumab, or the interleukin- 6 inhibitor tocilizumab, have improved the prognosis of this debilitating disease. Glucocorticoids still have to be considered at the onset of disease when a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug therapy fails or when there are life-threatening complications such as severe anemia or pericarditis, or macrophage activation syndrome. Local (intra-articular) <b>triamcinolone</b> <b>hexacetonide</b> is the treatment of choice for arthritis limited to one joint or a few joints in patients without systemic activity. To date, there is still great heterogeneity in the management of sJIA patients, but in recent years there have been attempts to design algorithms and treatment protocols for glucocorticoids, disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs, and biologic agents. This review provides an overview of the current knowledge of glucocorticoid therapy in sJIA, comments on recently published recommendations, and gives practical support to the clinician for management of this disease...|$|E
40|$|The {{hip joint}} {{is the most}} {{important}} joint as far as surgical management of JCA is concerned. Approximately a third of chil-dren will develop hip involvement, leading to pain and deformity. A wide spectrum of hip joint abnormalities may occur, being the result of either under-development or over-development of the bones and erosive change secondary to the syn-ovitis. For the acutely irritable hip with no fixed deformity an intra-articular injection of <b>Triamcinolone</b> <b>Hexacetonide</b> may be beneficial. For those hips with a fixed deformity, resulting in functional impairment in children prior to the closure of the proximal femoral capital epiphysis, a soft tissue release of selected muscles around the hip joint can correct deformity and improve function. For the painful destroyed hip joint, total joint replacement is indicated. Cemented hip replacements have been shown to have a high incidence of loosening in this patient group and consideration is being given to the use of customized uncemented femoral components. KEY WORDS: Juvenile chronic arthritis, Soft tissue release, Hip joint replacement. JUVENILE chronic arthritis is recognized as a heterogen-ous group of diseases in which the common factor is a persistent arthritis in one or more joints commencing under the age of 16 yr.

30|$|Improved hydrogels are {{continuously}} {{being made}} {{that seek to}} maximize the effect of treatment. One such is called Gel-One, which is composed of a product called Gel- 200, a cross-linked hyaluronate hydrogel [43]. This product was first shown to produce chondroprotective, anti-inflammatory effects and long-lasting analgesia in OA mouse models [43]. Another new product, HYA-JOINT Plus, was shown to produce a longer lasting and stronger effect on pain than compared to Synvisc-one, which is currently used by many physicians in intra-articular injections [44]. Furthermore, the product Cingal combined HA hydrogels with <b>triamcinolone</b> <b>hexacetonide,</b> a long acting corticosteroid previously shown to help with arthritis [45]. A clinical trial showed that Cingal provided immediate and long-term relief of osteoarthritis-related pain, stiffness, and function through 26  weeks when compared to saline [45]. Additionally, a new product named Cartistem paired HA hydrogels with human umbilical cord blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells has been used [46]. Unlike the usual autologous MSCs, these allogenic stem cells are isolated in a noninvasive manner and have shown a high expansion capacity, allowing a plethora of cells for therapeutic applications [46]. Moreover, it was previously shown in a sheep model of osteoarthritis that allogenic MSCs have a similar efficacy of treatment as autologous MSCs [34]. In a clinical trial, the product showed maturing repair tissue at 12  weeks and pain lowered at 24  weeks, both of which remained stable over 7  years of follow-up [33].|$|E
