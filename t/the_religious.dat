By employing <b>the</b> concept of <b>religious</b> multiculturalism and theory of religious education, this paper argues that to face <b>the</b> challenge of <b>religious</b> multiculturalism it is necessary to change <b>the</b> model of <b>religious</b> education from within, at and beyond <b>the</b> wall. <b>Religious</b> education “in” <b>the</b> wall contributes to shape an exclusive model of religiosity; while religious education “at” and “beyond” the wall contributes to shape an inclusive multiculturalistic model of religiosity. The last two models are applicable in Indonesia in order to face the challenge of multiculturalism, because both of them help students to accept, respect, and value religious differences. Religious education should show that the common enemy of religion is not people of different faiths, but poverty, corruption, violence, ignorance, and the like, and they have to stand together to fight against these true enemies...|$|R
