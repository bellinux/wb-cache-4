Her second child, Lovell, who inherited the property, was born the following year on 30 June 1775. The Edgeworth children were raised according to the system of Rousseau, as refined and modified by the Edgeworths.

40|$|This study uses US {{survey data}} and Swedish {{register}} data to estimate {{and compare the}} relationship between returns <b>to</b> <b>schooling</b> <b>and</b> ability. A significant and positive relationship is found for Sweden, {{but not for the}} USA. Based on the predictions of the optimal schooling model it is argues that measured differences in the relationship between returns <b>to</b> <b>schooling</b> <b>and</b> ability could depend upon on differences in the schooling systems between the countries. The findings suggest that a low price of higher education in Sweden makes a relationship between returns <b>to</b> <b>schooling</b> <b>and</b> ability observable in Sweden but not in the USA...|$|R
