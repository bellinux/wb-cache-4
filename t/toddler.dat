5|$|A {{securely}} attached <b>toddler</b> will explore freely while the caregiver is present, engage with strangers, be visibly upset when the caregiver departs, and {{happy to see}} the caregiver return. The anxious-ambivalent <b>toddler</b> is anxious of exploration, extremely distressed when the caregiver departs but ambivalent when the caregiver returns. The anxious-avoidant <b>toddler</b> will not explore much, avoid or ignore the parent—showing little emotion when the parent departs or returns—and treat strangers {{much the same as}} caregivers with little emotional range shown. The disorganized/disoriented <b>toddler</b> shows a lack of a coherent style or pattern for coping. Evidence suggests this occurs when the caregiving figure is also an object of fear, thus putting the child in an irresolvable situation regarding approach and avoidance. On reunion with the caregiver, these children can look dazed or frightened, freezing in place, backing toward the caregiver or approaching with head sharply averted, or showing other behaviors implying fear of the person who is being sought. It is thought to represent a breakdown of an inchoate attachment strategy and it appears to affect the capacity to regulate emotions.|$|E

40|$|Aim. The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} whether there are differences in shy behaviour of shy <b>toddlers</b> in different contexts (small circle, big circle, free play, offside). Method. The study was conducted among two groups of <b>toddlers,</b> all originating from the assistance plan PeuterPlus! (ToddlerPlus!). <b>Toddlers</b> with shy behaviour (N = 4) and <b>toddlers</b> without shy behaviour (N = 29) were observed in four different situations. The teachers were observed to see to what extent they supported the <b>toddlers</b> emotionally. It was then analyzed whether the degree of emotional support offered by teachers influenced the behaviour of the <b>toddlers</b> with end without shyness. Results. The results showed that, with a p value of. 05, shy <b>toddlers</b> showed significant difference in the degree of shy behaviour in different contexts. (Note: The group of shy <b>toddlers</b> was too small to look at the influence of emotional support from the teacher). The results also showed that in all situations there was a difference in the degree of shy behaviour between <b>toddlers</b> with and without shy behaviour. Besides this difference there were no other difference in the degree of embarrassment in various contexts of <b>toddlers</b> who are not shy. The degree of emotional support by the teacher did not affect the shy behaviour of these <b>toddlers.</b> Conclusion. The results are consistent with the expectation that there are differences in the degree of shyness of shy <b>toddlers</b> per context and also that there are differences between <b>toddlers</b> with and without shy behaviour in different contexts...|$|R

Across Action (N = 25; 16 – 20 months) and Verbal (N = 43; 20 – 24 months) studies, parents pretended, joked, and interacted literally with <b>toddlers.</b> Examined was whether parents use the above cues to express positive emotion, grab attention, or for pedagogical purposes. Parents exaggerated IDS, and sometimes smiling, when joking or pretending to express positive emotion. For younger <b>toddlers,</b> parents increased gaze to <b>toddlers</b> and smiling when joking compared to pretend and literal contexts, feasibly to grab attention to scaffold joke understanding. Parents decreased gaze to objects when joking, plausibly to avoid <b>toddlers</b> generalizing jokes’ false information, following pedagogy theory. Younger <b>toddlers</b> responded appropriately to parents’ cues, highlighting how <b>toddlers</b> could distinguish intentions to joke from other acts.

Unusual {{patterns of}} visual preference as indexed by eye tracking are hallmarks; however, {{whether they can}} be used to define an early biomarker of ASD as a whole or leveraged to define a subtype is unclear. To begin to examine this issue, large cohorts are required. MethodsA sample of 334 <b>toddlers</b> from six distinct groups (115 <b>toddlers</b> with ASD, 20 <b>toddlers</b> with ASD features, 57 <b>toddlers</b> with developmental delay, 53 <b>toddlers</b> with other conditions [e. g., premature birth, prenatal drug exposure], 64 <b>toddlers</b> with typical development, and 25 unaffected <b>toddlers</b> with siblings with ASD) was studied. <b>Toddlers</b> watched a movie containing geometric and social images. Fixation duration and number of saccades within each area of interest and validation statistics for this independent sample were computed. Next, to maximize power, data from our previous study (n = 110) were added for a total of 444 subjects. A subset of <b>toddlers</b> repeated the eye-tracking procedure. ResultsAs in the original study, a subset of <b>toddlers</b> with ASD fixated on geometric images > 69 % of the time. Using this cutoff, sensitivity for ASD was 21 %, specificity was 98 %, and positive predictive value was 86 %. <b>Toddlers</b> with ASD who strongly preferred geometric images had 1) worse cognitive, language, and social skills relative to <b>toddlers</b> with ASD who strongly preferred social images and 2) fewer saccades when viewing geometric images. Unaffected siblings of ASD probands did not show evidence of heightened preference for geometric images. Test-retest reliability was good. Examination of age effects suggested that this test may not be appropriate with children > 4 years old. ConclusionsEnhanced visual preference for geometric repetition may be an early developmental biomarker of an ASD subtype with more severe symptoms...|$|R

5|$|The more {{positive}} emotions and behavior that a 12- to 24-month-old <b>toddler</b> displays when coping with separation from a parent, the better s/he is 3.5 years later at using cooling strategies {{in order to}} delay gratification. This suggests that the emotional skills and processes required for coping with social and interpersonal frustrations {{are similar to those}} utilized for coping with the aggravation of goal-directed delay of gratification. Maternal attachment also influences the development of a child's ability to delay gratification. An interaction has been found between a mother's level of control and how close a child stays to the mother while exploring the environment. Children who have controlling mothers and explore their environment at a far distance from her are able to employ more cooling strategies and delay rewards longer. Similarly, children who stay close to a non-controlling mothers also use more cool strategies and demonstrate longer delays. This suggests that some children of controlling mothers have better learned how to distract themselves from or effectively avoid intrusive stimuli, although additional effects on their emotional competency are speculated but unknown. A greater capacity to delay gratification by using effective attentional strategies is also seen in preschoolers whose mothers had been responsive and supportive during particularly stressful times of self-regulation when the child was a <b>toddler,</b> indicating that maternal responsiveness during highly demanding times is crucial for the development of self-regulation, self-control and emotional competency.|$|E

40|$|While {{separate}} {{pieces of}} research found parents offer <b>toddlers</b> cues to express {{that they are}} (1) joking and (2) pretending, and that <b>toddlers</b> and preschoolers understand intentions to (1) joke and (2) pretend, {{it is not yet}} clear whether parents and <b>toddlers</b> consider joking and pretending to be distinct concepts. This is important as distinguishing these two forms of non-literal acts could open a gateway to understanding the complexities of the non-literal world, as well as the complexities of intentions in general. Two studies found parents offer explicit cues to help 16 - to 24 -month-olds distinguish pretending and joking. Across an action play study (n = 25) and a verbal play study (n = 40) parents showed more disbelief and less belief through their actions and language when joking versus pretending. Similarly, <b>toddlers</b> showed less belief through their actions, and older <b>toddlers</b> showed less belief through their language.
