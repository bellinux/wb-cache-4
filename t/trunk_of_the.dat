5|$|Hypertrophic scars are uncommon, and are {{characterized}} by increased collagen content after the abnormal healing response. They are described as firm and raised from the skin. Hypertrophic scars remain within the original margins of the wound, whereas keloid scars can form scar tissue outside of these borders.

That evening, while those attending the feast are sitting by the flaming hearths, they are visited by a one-eyed, very tall man whom they do not recognize. The stranger is wearing a hooded, mottled cape, linen breeches tied around his legs, and is barefooted. Sword in hand, the man walks towards Barnstokkr and his hood hangs low over his head, gray with age.

5|$|One of {{the goals}} of Mayor John Hylan's Independent Subway System (IND), {{proposed}} in the 1920s was a line to Coney Island, reached by a recapture of the BMT Culver Line. To connect this line to the Eighth Avenue Line–the main <b>trunk</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> IND–a subway line was to run from Brooklyn Borough Hall south under Jay Street, Smith Street, Ninth Street, and several other streets to Cortelyou Road (later Church Avenue) and McDonald Avenue, just north of the Ditmas Avenue elevated station. A ramp would then lead onto the elevated BMT Culver Line. This line was variously known as the Culver Line Extension, Culver−Smith Street Line, Smith Street Line, Smith Street–Prospect Park Line, Smith–Ninth Street Line, Jay–Smith–Ninth Street Line, Church Avenue Line, Prospect Park–Church Avenue Line, Prospect Park–Coney Island Line, Brooklyn Line, or South Brooklyn Line, though it was often simply referred to as the Brooklyn portion of the IND. As originally designed, service to and from Manhattan would have been exclusively provided by Culver express trains, while all local service would have fed into the IND Crosstown Line.|$|E

5|$|The Jain texts further {{illustrate}} {{the effects of}} leśyās on the mental dispositions of a soul, using {{an example of the}} reactions of six travellers on seeing a fruit-bearing tree. They see a tree laden with fruit and begin to think of getting those fruits: one of them suggests uprooting the entire tree and eating the fruit; the second one suggests cutting the <b>trunk</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tree; the third one suggests simply cutting the branches; the fourth one suggests cutting the twigs and sparing the branches and the tree; the fifth one suggests plucking only the fruits; the sixth one suggests picking up only the fruits that have fallen down. The thoughts, words and bodily activities of each of these six travellers are different based on their mental dispositions and are respectively illustrative of the six leśyās. At one extreme, the person with the black leśyā, having evil disposition, thinks of uprooting the whole tree even though he wants to eat only one fruit. At the other extreme, the person with the white leśyā, having a pure disposition, thinks of picking up the fallen fruit, in order to spare the tree.|$|E
5|$|The tree {{has survived}} {{for so long}} due to {{vegetative}} cloning. The visible tree is relatively young, but {{it is part of}} an older root system that dates back thousands of years. The <b>trunk</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tree may die and regrow multiple times, but the tree's root system remains intact and in turn sprouts another trunk. The trunk may only live for about 600 years, and when one trunk dies another eventually grows back in its place. Also, each winter, heavy snow may push the tree's low-lying branches to ground level, where they take root and survive to grow again the next year in a process known as layering. Layering occurs when a tree's branch comes in contact with the earth, and new roots sprout from the contact point. Other trees, such as coast redwoods and western redcedars are known to reproduce by layering. The tree's age was determined by carbon-14 dating of the root system, which found roots dating back to 375, 5,660, 9,000, and 9,550 years. Carbon dating is not accurate enough to pin down the exact year the tree sprouted from seed; but, given the estimated age, the tree is supposed to have sprouted around 7550 BC. For comparison, the invention of writing (and thus, the beginning of recorded history) did not occur until around 4000 BC. Researchers have found a cluster of around 20 spruce trees in the same area, all over 8,000 years old.|$|E

40|$|Background and Purpose. Palpation <b>of</b> {{peripheral}} nerve <b>trunks</b> has been advocated {{as a method}} <b>of</b> assessing <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> hyperalgesic nerve tissue as a contributing factor to pain syndromes in musculoskeletal disorders <b>of</b> <b>the</b> upper quadrant. This study investigated, in the first instance, the pressure pain thresholds <b>of</b> <b>the</b> median, radial and ulnar nerve <b>trunks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> upper limb in healthy, asymptomatic subjects. Method. Forty-five male and 50 female healthy volunteer subjects {{participated in this study}} which involved measurement of pressure pain thresholds by use of pressure algometry bilaterally over the three {{peripheral nerve}} trunks in the upper limbs. Results. Pressure pain thresholds were shown to be lowest in the median nerve (p= 0. 001) and lower in female subjects (p= 0. 001). Laterality (p= 0. 077) or <b>the</b> age <b>of</b> <b>the</b> subject (p= 0. 254) did not significantly influence results. Conclusions. The study demonstrated differences in pressure pain thresholds in <b>the</b> three nerve <b>trunks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> upper limb. These findings should be taken into account when interpreting <b>the</b> findings <b>of</b> nerve palpation in musculoskeletal upper quadrant disorders...|$|R

25|$|The tree {{maintained}} its {{connection with the}} dairy industry through the mid-20th century, serving as a collection point for dairy farmers bringing cans of cream to be loaded and transported by road to Gladstone when the first motorised truck began carting cream from Miriam Vale to the Port Curtis Dairy Factory in 1952. By this year a ramp, facing Blomfield Street, had been built alongside the <b>trunk</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Big Fig for the loading of cream and later milk cans {{onto the back of}} delivery vehicles. The place served as an easily accessible and shady location for farmers to assemble and wait for their produce to be loaded. During the 1960s, the original loading ramp was replaced with a new ramp, and an early fence and gates, reputedly constructed around the tree and cream/milk collection area by Queensland Railways, was demolished. The new ramp was built facing Station Street, and remained until at least 1977 when the last contract for the milk run to Gladstone was cancelled. Several small earth mounds {{to the north of the}} <b>trunk</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Fig Tree are all that remain of the second ramp.|$|E
