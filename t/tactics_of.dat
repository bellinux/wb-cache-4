5|$|According to Stanley Karnow, the Pulitzer Prize-winning {{author of}} Vietnam: A History, the coup was ineffectively executed; {{although}} the rebels captured {{the headquarters of}} the Joint General Staff at Tan Son Nhut Air Base, they failed to follow the textbook <b>tactics</b> <b>of</b> blocking the roads leading into Saigon. They also failed to disconnect phone lines into the palace, which allowed Diệm to call for aid from loyal units.|$|E

5|$|However, the {{aggressive}} <b>tactics</b> <b>of</b> Haywood and the IWW, {{along with their}} call for abolition of the wage system and the overthrow of capitalism created tension with moderate electorally-oriented leaders of the Socialist Party. Haywood and the IWW focused on direct action and strikes, which often led to violence, and were less concerned with political tactics. When Haywood was quoted speaking at public meetings in New York City {{to the effect that}} he had never advocated the use of the ballot by the workers but had instead favored the <b>tactics</b> <b>of</b> direct action, an initiative recalling Haywood from the NEC was launched by the State Executive Committee of the Socialist Party of New York. In February 1913 the recall of Haywood was approved by a margin of more than 2-to-1. Following his defeat, Haywood left the ranks of the Socialist Party, joined by thousands of other IWW members and their sympathizers.|$|E
5|$|Just as the armour {{and weapons}} {{of the late}} army were {{fundamentally}} {{similar to those of}} earlier eras, so the army's tactics were based on traditional principles.

5|$|Martin Luther King Jr. (born Michael King Jr., January 15, 1929– April 4, 1968) was an American Baptist {{minister}} and activist {{who became the}} most visible spokesperson and leader in the Civil Rights Movement.

5|$|The {{sheer number}} of guns fired {{broadside}} meant a sail battleship could wreck any wooden enemy, holing her hull, knocking down masts, wrecking her rigging, and killing her crew. However, the effective range of the guns was {{as little as a}} few hundred yards, so the battle <b>tactics</b> <b>of</b> sailing ships depended in part on the wind.|$|E
5|$|Up until now, the Bf 109s had {{successfully}} blocked {{attacks on the}} bombers.

The 18th North Korean Regiment, in control of the hill, mounted a disastrous counterattack in hopes of pushing the Marines back.

The Dallas Equal Suffrage Association developed a suffrage campaign based on social values and community standards. Community and social occasions served as recruiting opportunities for the suffrage cause, blunting its radical implications with the familiarity of customary events and dressing it in the values of traditional female behavior, especially propriety.|$|E

Joan of Arc's involvement helped the French remove the siege of Orleans and win the Battle of Patay before Joan was captured by the Burgundians, sold to the English, tried as a witch and burned at the stake.

5|$|Indonesia kept East Timor {{shut off}} from the rest of the world, except for a few years in the late 1980s and early 1990s, {{claiming}} that the vast majority of East Timorese supported integration.
