Not long after {{settling}} into {{his career at}} the Institute for Advanced Study (in Princeton, New Jersey), he expressed his appreciation of the meritocracy in American culture when compared to Europe. He recognized the [...] "right of individuals to say and <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> pleased", without social barriers, and as a result, individuals were encouraged, he said, to be more creative, a trait he valued from his own early education.|$|E
500|$|The song's writer, Brian Elliot, commented {{about the}} debate: [...] "I {{just wanted to}} make this girl in the song a {{sympathetic}} character. As a father myself, I'd want to be accessible to my children's problems." [...] Madonna avoided the controversy, and did not comment on the song's use as a pro-life statement. Her publicist, Liz Rosenberg, said that [...] "she [...] is singing a song, not taking a stand", adding that [...] "her philosophy is people can <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> want to think." [...] Danny Aiello, having appeared in the video as the titular [...] "Papa", recorded [...] "Papa Wants the Best for You" [...] later that year, an answer song written by Artie Schroeck from the father's point of view.|$|E
500|$|The {{final scene}} of the episode ended with a tape of a young Olivia in a fire-damaged room, leading to rumors her {{character}} was a fire starter. Torv however discounted this soon after, explaining [...] "I think it's more than that... I <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> got given or what they got taught is much bigger than just starting fire". Jeff Pinkner agreed and elaborated further, [...] "We saw the consequence. We saw that she started a fire {{at the end of}} the last episode, but I think it's a mistake to assume that that's her power. I think the truth is, it's probably a consequence of her ability". This particular scene, as well as the episode's reference to experiments Walter performed on children, comprise the main plot of the season three episode [...] "Subject 13".|$|E

[...] Since people often <b>think</b> about <b>what</b> <b>they</b> could have done differently, {{it is not uncommon}} for people to feel regret during upward counterfactual thinking.|$|R

2500|$|Whilst {{there was}} some {{speculation}} that [...] "Living Type" [...] was [...] "a cheesy, angsty love song", Powderfinger's lead singer; Bernard Fanning (who wrote the song) said it was actually about Charles Manson, and the people affected by his cult. [...] Fanning {{said that he was}} unable to control what people thought about the song, and so didn't try, but that [...] "cheesy love song" [...] that it had been dubbed was [...] "not the intention" [...] of the song. In a subsequent interview, Fanning told Juice magazine that people had been asking him if [...] "Living Type" [...] was about menstruation, which he dismissed as being [...] "so stupid". [...] However, he also re-iterated his statement that he was unable to control interpretations of the song, saying that [...] "people have a freedom to <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> like".|$|E
2500|$|At the time, most Christian music enthusiasts who weren't {{familiar}} with gothic music didn't {{know how to}} classify Prints of Darkness. It was most often compared {{to one of the}} best-known gothic rock groups, The Sisters of Mercy. The album displayed satirical lyrics, a theme Healy would later become known for. Both Dead Artist Syndrome and its gothic rock style achieved more notice after Blonde Vinyl Records reissued Prints of Darkness in late 1991. The album begins with the song [...] "Christmas", which is not a Christmas carol, but a rather sarcastic rock song that was said be [...] a denouncement of the secularization and commercialization of what has become known as the [...] "winter holiday season", Healy himself has stated [...] "Christmas". is about separation from faith, church, friends and family at what {{is supposed to be the}} best day of the year" [...] in many public and radio interviews. [...] "Amy" [...] is a haunting, romantic ballad, and while rumor to be about Amy Grant, Healy has stated [...] "it's not, but I let people <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> want, that said the idea of Amy Grant actually hearing the song and being creeped out was amusing to me, it's my Alice Cooper side" [...] while [...] "Red" [...] is a gloomy piece about a man who is mourning the loss of his wife, who may have either cheated on him, divorced him or died. The lyrics are said to symbolically to describe the apostasy of many churches, and relate to the Bible's description of the Church as the [...] "Bride of Christ". The album ends with [...] "Reach" [...] which is a synthesizer-driven worship song.|$|E
2500|$|Michael Musto of The Village Voice {{commented on}} the media's {{reaction}} to the incident, saying, [...] "Janet became a symbolic Joan of Arc to burn at the stake. I actually do think her breast {{was used as a}} diversionary tactic – I'm not sure to distract from Iraq specifically – but it did distract from important issues, from things we actually should be appalled by. The story got an undue amount of attention when the fact is, nobody has proved how her breast harmed anyone." [...] Speaking to Robert Tannenbaum of Blender Magazine, Jackson had strong, if guarded, views on the reactions, saying the furor [...] "is hypocritical, with everything you see on TV. There are more important thing to focus on than a woman's body part, which is a beautiful thing. There's war, famine, homelessness, AIDS". The fact that it happened in an election year [...] "did have {{a great deal to do}} with it. They needed something to focus on instead of the war, and I was the perfect vehicle for that. People are going to <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> want. It was an accident. It was not a stunt. That was embarrassing for me to have all those people see my breast. That's like having your penis hanging out in front of millions and millions of people." [...] Janet declared the reaction to the accidental exposure as [...] "contradictory", noting it to occur in an era where commercials for beer and Viagra are both [...] "very sexual" [...] and [...] "practically omnipresent". Jackson also said the mishap was [...] "not intentional" [...] and a [...] "costume accident", also commenting on some media outlets editing her taped apology, saying, [...] "Sometimes they cut out that I said it was an accident...That's what the media does, that's the way they are because they want it to be told a different way." [...] In Glamour Magazine, Janet exclaimed, [...] "It's hard to believe that there's a war and famine going on in the world and yet people made such a big deal about a breast. People said that it was done intentionally to sell records. Do you know what? I have never pulled a stunt. Why would you do that and have your album come out two months later? It doesn't make sense." [...] In the ensuing months, Janet felt overwhelmed by the hostility towards her. [...] "People think I'm immune to being hurt by what's said. They ask me questions that shock me. Not everybody is as strong as the next person and words can kill. People push you and you start to think, 'Can I handle this?' But I know I can." ...|$|E

30|$|To {{positively}} influence eudaemonic happiness {{we developed}} a new positive psychological exercise named Lottery Question, based on previous scientific research (Highouse et al. 2010; Vecchio 1980).

Although in most of these studies participants are simply asked to <b>think</b> about <b>what</b> <b>they</b> would do if they got enough money to stop working and still live financially comfortable, their methodology has become known as the “lottery question” because in some of these studies the data relies on a question that asked participants to <b>think</b> about <b>what</b> <b>they</b> would do if they actually win the lottery (Highouse et al. 2010; Kaplan 1987).|$|R
