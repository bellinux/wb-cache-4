In Algeria, the production of potable water from seawater desalination will reach in 2020 a capacity of 2. 5 million m 3 /day.

We are carrying out preliminary economic evaluation and comparison of various energy source options coupled with different seawater desalination processes.

40|$|The nuclear {{dynamics}} of urea aqueous solution was analyzed by time resolved optical Kerr effect (OKE). The data analysis was achieved {{in time and}} in frequency domains. Three relaxation times characterize the time decay of the OKE signal at high mole fractions of urea, while only two relaxation times characterize this decay for the low mole fractions. The observed slowest relaxation time increases with increasing the mole fraction of urea. The comparison between this relaxation time and the ones determined by Raman and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopies suggests that the slow relaxation time {{is related to the}} reorientation of an axis lying in the plane of the urea molecule. At high mole fractions, <b>the</b> <b>power</b> spectra <b>derived</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Fourier transform of the OKE signal are characterized by one broad peak at around 70 cm– 1 and by a shoulder at around 160 cm– 1 in the high frequency part of the former peak.

Molecular dynamics simulation results on urea/water system suggest that <b>the</b> <b>power</b> spectra <b>derived</b> <b>from</b> OKE data could be interpreted in terms of translational motions (caging effect) and in terms of rotational motion (libration) of urea molecules. © 2001 American Institute of Physics...|$|R

The behaviour of fast ions is accessible by two experimental methods, {{the measurement of}} CX-spectra and the time evolution of neutron production which are compared with numerical models. In previous studies systematic differences between numerical prediction and experimental data has been observed. For further investigation of the observed discrepancies new experiments with neutral injection were conducted. In order to gain an overview over the discharges the experimental neutron-rate is compared with a relaxation model of neutron production. Several discharges are numerically analyzed with a code for solving the Fokker-Planck equation. The influence of plasma parameters is investigated and the experimental error {{is found to be}} approximately 50 %. The differences between numerical simulation and experimental results is within these errors. <b>The</b> absorbed <b>power</b> from neutral beam injection is <b>derived</b> <b>from</b> neutron-rate measurement and compared to numerical calculations from FAFNER.

This system {{could serve as a}} basis {{for the development of a}} new generation of high-efficiency combined cycles. In one of several possible configurations of the new combined-cycle fossil fuel power system, natural gas enters the system at 4. 0 MPa and about 300 K, is heated and reformed, and is transferred to a turbine where the gas is expanded to 0. 6 MPa and 800 K, and then flows successively to heat exchangers and a condenser-separator, after which it is separated into two gas streams, one containing principally CO with some CH 4 and water vapor and the other containing pure H 2. The CO and H 2 flow to separate fuel cells and undergo electrochemical oxidation with the concomitant production of electricity. Separate streams of water and carbon dioxide (CO 2) are produced, making this cycle compatible with carbon mitigation strategies based on sequestration. Model calculations indicate combined-cycle efficiencies greater than 70 % based on the lower heating value of natural gas.
