5|$|A {{preliminary}} examination of <b>the</b> <b>imagery</b> suggests that S/2015 (136472) 1 has a reflectivity similar to charcoal, {{making it an}} extremely dark object. This is somewhat surprising because Makemake is the second-brightest known object in the Kuiper belt. One hypothesis to explain this is that its gravity is {{not strong enough to}} prevent bright but volatile ices from being lost to space when it is heated by the distant Sun.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis was to examine <b>the</b> mouth <b>imagery</b> (images of eating, tasting, swallowing, and devouring) in the poetry of Sylvia Plath {{in terms of its}} meaning of Plath's art. An {{examination}} of Plath's Collected Poems reveals that both the prevalence and specific nature of <b>the</b> mouth <b>imagery</b> make it a significant part of her poetic vision. <b>The</b> mouth <b>imagery</b> differs from <b>the</b> other threatening <b>imagery</b> in Plath's poems because, unlike the threat of death presented by the moon or sea, <b>the</b> mouth <b>imagery</b> describes a threat humans cannot detach themselves from; they must contribute to the "gross eating game. " Because existence depends upon consuming food, and new life builds upon decay, the threat represented by <b>the</b> mouth <b>imagery</b> is hoplesslessly recognized as necessary by its victims in Plath's poems. <b>The</b> mouth <b>imagery</b> expresses <b>the</b> paradox in the interdependence of life and death through metaphors which convey a sense of threat as well as necessity.

5|$|Diagnosis of a {{cerebrospinal}} fluid leak is performed {{through a combination}} of measurement of the CSF pressure and a computed tomography myelogram (CTM) scan of the spinal column for fluid leaks. The opening fluid pressure in the spinal canal is obtained by performing a lumbar puncture, also known as a spinal tap. Once the pressure is measured, a radiocontrast agent is injected into the spinal fluid. The contrast then diffuses out through the dura sac before leaking through dural holes. This allows for a CTM with fluoroscopy to locate and image any sites of dura rupture via contrast seen outside the dura sac in <b>the</b> <b>imagery.</b>|$|E

5|$|In Buah Rindu, Amir {{shows an}} {{affinity}} for using traditional Malay poetic forms such as the quatrain, but unlike the highly fixed traditional forms, he mixes the rhyming patterns. The text is dominated by terms related to love and searching, and according to Dutch scholar of Indonesian literature A. Teeuw the collection is united by a theme of longing. Johns states that <b>the</b> <b>imagery</b> in Buah Rindu is dependent on traditional Malay literature, and that Amir's terminology is heavily influenced by classical Malay poetry. The author's use of language is also notably coloured by Javanese terms and ideas, and another source of influence appears to be Indian literature, with references to Hindu gods and goddesses.|$|E
5|$|Jackson began storyboarding {{the series}} with Christian Rivers in August 1997 and {{assigned}} his crew to begin designing Middle-earth {{at the same}} time. Jackson hired long-time collaborator Richard Taylor to lead Weta Workshop on five major design elements: armour, weapons, prosthetics/make-up, creatures, and miniatures. In November 1997, famed Tolkien illustrators Alan Lee and John Howe joined the project. Most of <b>the</b> <b>imagery</b> in the films is based on their various illustrations.

5|$|Other {{artists of}} the period {{had already begun to}} {{experiment}} with alternative methods of depicting Hope in art.

Meanwhile, Edward Burne-Jones, a friend of Watts who specialised in painting mythological and allegorical topics, in 1871 completed the cartoon for a planned stained glass window depicting Hope for St Margaret's Church in Hopton-on-Sea. Burne-Jones's design showed Hope upright and defiant in a prison cell, holding a flowering rod.|$|E

Today, it is a part of My Old Kentucky Home State Park in Bardstown. In 1856, the Kentucky General Assembly created a new county from parts of Fleming and Morgan counties and named it Rowan County in Rowan's honor.|$|E

40|$|Gambling is {{a serious}} problem that affects the {{individual}} as well as the whole society. Multiple studies have investigated <b>the</b> effect of <b>imagery</b> tasks on gambling behavior. Whiting and Dixon (2013) investigated the effect of a gambling-related imagery task verses a laundry-related imagery task on gambling behavior.

40|$|Two {{types of}} {{encoding}} tasks have been employed {{in previous research}} to investigate the beneficial effect of unitisation on familiarity-based associative recognition (unitised familiarity effect), namely the compound task and <b>the</b> interactive <b>imagery</b> task. Here we show how these two tasks could differentially engage subsequent recollection-based associative recognition and consequently lead to the turn-on or turn-off of the unitised familiarity effect. In the compound task, participants studied unrelated word pairs as newly learned compounds. In <b>the</b> interactive <b>imagery</b> task, participants studied the same word pairs as interactive images. An associative recognition task was used {{in combination with the}} Remember/Know procedure to measure recollection-based and familiarity-based associative recognition. The results showed that the unitised familiarity effect was present in the compound task but was absent in <b>the</b> interactive <b>imagery</b> task. A comparison of the compound and <b>the</b> interactive <b>imagery</b> task revealed a dramatic increase in recollection-based associative recognition for <b>the</b> interactive <b>imagery</b> task. These results suggest that unitisation could benefit familiarity-based associative recognition; however, this effect will be eliminated when the memory trace formed is easily accessed by strong recollection without the need for a familiarity assessment...|$|R
