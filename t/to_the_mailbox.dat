5|$|Miranda's mom {{is invited}} {{to appear on the}} $20,000 Pyramid. In hopes of winning the money and having a better life, Miranda and her mom's boyfriend Richard prep her for the show. Miranda and Sal are friends again. While her mother is on-stage, Miranda reminisces about a {{conversation}} with Marcus about how no one would recognize a time-traveler from a different age. She suddenly realizes that the laughing man is an older incarnation of Marcus, who has come from the future to save Sal's life. He needed to deliver the notes to the young Marcus through Miranda. Later on Miranda goes <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mailbox</b> the laughing man (Marcus) slept under, where she finds a picture of an older version of Julia smiling happily. The novel ends as Miranda reflects on the events in an epilogue.|$|E

Mister agrees, but later attacks Nettie while she is walking to school. She fights back, prompting Mister to kick her out. Celie protests, but Mister swears they will never see each other again. As she leaves Mister's property, Nettie promises to write to Celie.

500|$|As Scully {{calls for}} a {{forensic}} team to come out there immediately, she hears something in the house. She goes for her gun in the dresser drawer, but finds it missing. As the creature comes up the stairs, a bloodied Big Mike grabs Scully and tells her to get out, that [...] "it's coming" [...] for her. He shoves Scully in the closet, and fights with the creature. Meanwhile, Mulder confronts Gogolak about marking the Klines for death by giving them the tacky windmill. Mulder says the creature is a Tulpa, a Tibetan thoughtform, that Gogolak conjured to assure compliance with the HOA rules. Mulder arrests him, handcuffs him to a mailbox, and goes to find Scully. Cuffed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mailbox,</b> Gogolak begs for help, knowing the creature is coming. The creature attacks Gogolak and, as he dies, it disintegrates into dirt. Scully comes outside too late to see the creature, the remnants of which are at Mulder's feet.|$|E

She wrote to him in French: [...] "After your departure, I {{did not take the}} chocolate. The box is still intact as on the day of your parting. Don’t delay too long writing us because I wear out the soles of my shoes for running <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mailbox</b> {{to see if there is}} a letter from you. There will never be any home in which you are so loved as in that in Brussels, so, you little bad boy, hurry up and come back…" [...] In 2007, Slachmuylders' group {{arranged}} for an historical marker honoring Rizal to be placed at the house.|$|E

50|$|From 1922 until 1971, all trams had {{mailboxes}} {{at their}} rear side.

30|$|In the mailbox-based {{approach}} [16], every MH {{is associated}} with a mailbox, which is a data structure residing at a mobility agent. If a sender wants to send a packet to an MH, it simply sends <b>the</b> packet <b>to</b> <b>the</b> receiver's <b>mailbox</b> no matter how the current location of the MH is. <b>The</b> <b>mailbox</b> acts as a relay and buffer station of MH. <b>The</b> <b>mailbox</b> forwards <b>the</b> buffered traffic <b>to</b> <b>the</b> MH based on the binding information maintained in it. Although HH-MIP and mailbox share a similar idea to some extent, there are some significant differences between them and will be discussed in Section 3.3.|$|R

50|$|On August 7, 1996, the Korzilius' 6-year-old daughter, Katherine, {{was on her}} {{way home}} with her mother and brother. They dropped her off at their mailbox {{approximately}} 1/8 of a mile from their home so that she could get the mail and then come home. She usually took about 30 minutes to make it <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mailbox</b> from their home, and then back again. An hour after dropping Katherine off, she had not returned home. They drove <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mailbox,</b> but did not see her along the route. Her mother then drove a full circle through their suburban neighborhood and found her body in the street.|$|E

Frustrated with the side-effects of the antipsychotic medication he is taking, which make him lethargic and unresponsive, he secretly stops taking it. This causes a relapse and he meets Parcher again.|$|R
50|$|A {{variation}} {{is to use}} a catch-all address, then forward <b>to</b> <b>the</b> real <b>mailbox</b> using wildcards. Many mail servers allow the use of '*', meaning 'any number of characters'. This makes the whitelist automatic and only requires <b>the</b> administrator <b>to</b> update <b>the</b> blacklist occasionally. In effect the user has one address, but it contains wild cards, e.g.; 'me.*@my.domain', which will match any incoming address that starts with 'me.' and ends with '@my.domain'. This is very similar <b>to</b> <b>the</b> '+' notation but may be even less obvious since <b>the</b> address appears <b>to</b> be completely normal.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Today mobile devices can {{interact}} with their environment, because of the introduction of wireless communication. Wireless networks have two properties that distinguishes itself from the wired networks: First, wireless communication is less reliable than their wired variants {{because they have a}} limited communication range. Second, wireless communication is more dynamic as communication partners enter and leave frequently the communication range of the wireless network. These two distinct properties make the development of mobile software difficult. The actor model is a programming model that allows development of concurrent distributed software in open distributed environments. Actor models fail to handle these two distinct properties of wireless networks well. In this paper we extend the operational semantics of <b>the</b> actor model <b>to</b> capture these two properties in the actor model. We do this by adding a single new concept <b>to</b> <b>the</b> model: <b>the</b> <b>mailbox.</b> This paper provides a foundation for new implementations of the actor language and frameworks that are usable in the context of wireless network environments. ...|$|R

40|$|Explicit {{behavioural}} {{interface description}} languages (BIDLs, protocols) are now {{recognized as a}} mandatory feature of component languages {{in order to address}} component reuse, coordination, adaptation and verification issues. Such protocol languages often deal with synchronous communication. However, in the context of distributed systems, components communicating asynchronously through mailboxes are much more relevant. In this paper, we advocate for the use of Symbolic Transition Systems as a protocol language which may deal also with this kind of communication. We then present how this generic formalism, specialized with different mailbox protocols, may be used to address verification issues related <b>to</b> <b>the</b> component <b>mailboxes.</b> ...|$|R
