5|$|The race {{is widely}} {{considered}} the greatest performance {{of the twentieth century}} by a North American racehorse. Secretariat became the ninth Triple Crown winner in history, and <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>since</b> Citation in 1948, a gap of 25 years. Bettors holding 5,427 winning parimutuel tickets on Secretariat never redeemed them, presumably keeping them as souvenirs (and because the tickets would have paid only $2.20 on a $2 bet).|$|E
5|$|After {{lying in}} state for thirty-four {{hours in the}} Capitol rotunda, a state funeral service was {{conducted}} at the Washington National Cathedral on June 11, the day when President George W.

5|$|Babangida survived an {{abortive}} coup, then postponed a promised {{return to}} democracy to 1992. Free {{and fair elections}} were finally held on 12 June 1993, <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>since</b> the military coup of 1983, with a presidential victory for Moshood Kashimawo Olawale Abiola of the Social Democratic Party, who gained some 58% of the votes, defeating Bashir Tofa of the National Republican Convention. However, Babangida annulled the elections, leading to massive civilian protests that effectively shut down the country for weeks. Babangida finally kept his promise to relinquish office to a civilian government, but not before appointing Ernest Shonekan head of an interim government. Babangida's regime has been considered the most corrupt, and responsible for creating a culture of corruption in Nigeria.|$|E

5|$|In December 2007, Maryland hired Kansas State {{offensive}} coordinator James Franklin {{to serve in}} that same role for the Terrapins.

In 2003 and 2004, he also served as the recruiting coordinator, and Rivals.com ranked Franklin {{as one of the}} nation's top-25 recruiters both years. Because of the arrival of Franklin, 2008 was <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>since</b> 2005 that head coach Ralph Friedgen did not call the offensive plays himself. At Maryland, Franklin installed a West Coast offense, which was well suited to quarterback Chris Turner's playing style and an experienced wide receiver corps that included play-maker Darrius Heyward-Bey and sure-handed Danny Oquendo.|$|E

5|$|In January 1874, Gladstone {{called a}} general election, {{convinced}} that if he waited longer, he would do worse at the polls. Balloting was spread over two weeks, beginning on 1 February. Disraeli devoted much of his campaign to decrying the Liberal programme {{of the past five}} years. As the constituencies voted, {{it became clear that the}} result would be a Conservative majority, <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>since</b> 1841. In Scotland, where the Conservatives were perennially weak, they increased from seven seats to nineteen. Overall, they won 350 seats to 245 for the Liberals and 57 for the Irish Home Rule League. The Queen sent for Disraeli, and he became Prime Minister for the second time.|$|E

Allen sprained his ankle in a workout with his hometown Philadelphia 76ers {{and was forced to}} miss the next workout with the New Jersey Nets. The Sixers were not overly concerned with the injury, as they drafted him in the second round with the 50th pick on June23.
