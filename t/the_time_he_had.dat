5|$|Often {{late and}} {{in the habit of}} leaving a lot of {{paperwork}} unfinished, shortly before he quit teaching Vainio organized an excursion for the pupils to express his gratitude for <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> spent with them.|$|E
5|$|Maben {{subsequently}} {{did some}} of the editing of the final cut at home, due to financial constraints. He regretted doing this, as he felt it was important to separate his work and home life, but, at <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> no choice.|$|E
5|$|Upon his retirement, O'Gara held {{a number}} of honours and {{achievements}} at both club and international level. At <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> played for Ireland more times than any other player in history and had won nine trophies with Munster.|$|E

5|$|At <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> {{his first}} {{confrontation}} with Spanish authorities, since Betances gave last priority of medical treatment to those Spanish-born military rank and {{officers who were}} affected by the disease (they demanded preferential and immediate treatment, and he openly despised them for it). For his hard work to save many Puerto Ricans from the ravages of the cholera epidemic of 1856, Betances was commended by the city's government. However, when the central government established a Chief Surgeon post for the city, Betances (who was the acting chief surgeon) was passed over, {{in favor of a}} Spanish newcomer.|$|E
5|$|Chandler {{remained}} {{involved in}} politics throughout his tenure as baseball commissioner. In 1948, he became {{the leader of the}} Dixiecrat movement in Kentucky. He hosted Dixiecrat presidential candidate Strom Thurmond at his home when he visited the state, but did not officially endorse Thurmond's campaign. By <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> permanently returned to the state in mid-1951, {{it was too late to}} influence the gubernatorial contest. He spent the next four years rebuilding his political base in preparation for another run at the office.|$|E
5|$|When Lincoln {{failed in}} 1989 it cost the federal {{government}} over $3 billion and about 23,000 customers were left with worthless bonds. In the early 1990s, Keating was convicted in both federal and state courts of many counts of fraud, racketeering and conspiracy. He served {{four and a half}} years in prison before those convictions were overturned in 1996. In 1999, he pleaded guilty to a more limited set of wire fraud and bankruptcy fraud counts, and was sentenced to <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> already served. Keating spent his final years in low-profile real estate activities until his death in 2014.|$|E

5|$|As a sophomore, {{he was a}} first-team All-area {{selection}} {{after leading}} Lake Central in scoring. On September 14, 2010, Robinson became the first verbal commitment to the Michigan Wolverines men's basketball class of 2012. At <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> scholarship offers from Colorado, Valparaiso, Missouri State, IUPUI and Indiana State, and Rivals.com rated him as the 118th {{best player in the}} class of 2012. On February 5, 2011, Robinson posted his career-high 39 points against East Chicago Central High School on 14-for-19 shooting. This was his first high school game that his father attended. In the 2011 Indiana sectional against Munster High School, Robinson scored 31 points in an overtime 5453 loss, but missed a free throw in the final seconds.|$|E
5|$|As the game's {{dialogue}} {{consists of}} a lot of wordplay and misunderstandings, Smith would analyze scenes before writing them: he would see what the scenes were trying to accomplish, and where the beats in them were. After he had the structure of a scene in his head, he would write it; at times he was able {{to make use of the}} original Japanese dialogue, but most of <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> to come up with new ideas himself. At several points, the English wordplay was inspired by the wordplay in the Japanese version. At some points, it was not possible to do wordplay in the same places as in the Japanese version, so Smith would change the structure of the scene slightly. At other points, Smith came up with a joke or funny line, and changed the scene to make the joke work. Around half of the jokes were rewritten based on the characters present in the scene, rather than being translations of the Japanese jokes.|$|E
5|$|Citing his {{disappointment}} at failing to gain promotion, Stimson resigned {{from his post}} at Grays on 16 May 2006. He stated that at <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> received no firm job offers from other clubs, and acknowledged that {{he was taking a}} gamble with his career, but said that if he was unable to find a new job as a manager he would move into youth coaching or open his own football school. He was linked with the managerial vacancy at League Two Peterborough United, but eventually took over as manager of Stevenage Borough on 28 May, and led the club to an eighth-place finish in the Conference National in his first season in charge. Stevenage also defeated Stimson's former club Grays to reach the FA Trophy final, and beat Kidderminster Harriers 3–2 at the new Wembley Stadium in the final, giving Stimson a third consecutive Trophy win as a manager.|$|E

50|$|Growing up, Nijhar recollects <b>the</b> <b>times</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> {{to stay in}} a kampung {{house without}} any basic {{amenities}} and had to depend on wells for water, and Hindu temples for free meals because of poverty.|$|R
5|$|Craig had {{a strong}} Sheffield Shield season in 1960–61. At <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> become a {{production}} manager at his pharmaceutical firm and declared that the season {{would be his last}} owing to work commitments. His employers had been pressuring him to commit to a career after cricket. Early in the campaign, Craig scored consecutive centuries against Queensland and Victoria. He then scored 83 as New South Wales defeated the touring West Indians by an innings and 97 runs, but he was overlooked for Test selection. He ended his season with 197 in an innings victory over Western Australia. Overall, he totalled 710 runs at 59.16, as New South Wales won their eighth successive Shield. After a successful campaign, he reversed his decision and made himself available for the 1961 tour of England, but Bill Lawry was selected ahead of him.|$|E
5|$|Despite his rapidly failing health, Djajakusuma {{remained}} {{active in}} the arts. In 1980 he made his last film appearance, and his only role on the big screen, acting in Ismail Soebardjo's Perempuan dalam Pasungan (Woman in Stocks). He and Sofia WD portrayed parents who regularly put their daughter in stocks to punish her for being disobedient; {{in an interview with}} Suara Karya, Soebardjo recalled that, from <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> written it, he had only considered Djajakusuma for the role. Perempuan dalam Pasungan won the Citra Award for Best Film at the 1981 Indonesian Film Festival, and Djajakusuma expressed an interest in making several further films; this was, however, never realised. In 1983 Djajakusuma served as dean of the Faculty of Arts at IKJ, and in 1984 he went to the Three Continents Festival in Nantes, France, where two of his films were shown to critical acclaim.|$|E
5|$|Hawkins {{was born}} in Finley, New South Wales to Jack and Jenny Hawkins. He {{grew up in the}} New South Wales region of Finley as the middle child among three other siblings. He {{attended}} Finley High School and played for the Finley Football Club before making the move south of the border to begin boarding at Melbourne Grammar School. Hawkins' footballing ability was recognised early on when he was selected to play first XVIII football for the school whilst still in year ten, when many of his teammates were completing their final year of schooling at year twelve. Hawkins kicked four goals on debut for the school and his performances up forward soon received attention from AFL recruiting teams. By <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> reached his final school year he was rewarded with joint captaincy of the football team alongside Hawthorn draftee Xavier Ellis. He was also selected in the Associated Public Schools (APS) team to play the Associated Grammar School (AGS) selected football team in the traditional annual clash of schools, where he won best on ground honours for his performance.|$|E

5|$|He {{joined the}} Oxford Playhouse in 1951 and worked {{there for three}} years, {{appearing}} in plays such as He Who Gets Slapped as the clown. Peter Hall worked with Barker at Oxford and gave him his break, casting him as the Chantyman and Joe Silva in his production of Mourning Becomes Electra at the Arts Theatre in London's West End in 1955. By <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> {{made it to the}} West End, Barker had appeared in an estimated 350 plays. Barker remained a West End actor for several years, appearing in numerous plays between 1955 and 1968. These included, in 1955, two performances each night as he played a gypsy in Listen to the Wind at the Arts Theatre and then a peasant in Summertime later in the evening. Other roles included Mr Thwaites in Double Image in 1956 (with Olivier), Camino Real (directed by Hall) in 1957, French gangster Robertoles-Diams in Irma La Douce for two years from 1958, Lord Slingsby-Craddock in Mr Whatnot in 1964 and Birdboot in The Real Inspector Hound in 1968. He also appeared in several Royal Court Theatre productions, including A Midsummer Night's Dream as Quince.|$|E
5|$|It {{is alleged}} that Amin became radicalised during his second {{stay in the}} United States in 1962, when he {{enrolled}} in a work-study group at the University of Wisconsin. Amin studied in the doctoral programme at the Columbia University Teachers College, but started to neglect his studies in favour of politics; in 1963 he became head of the Afghan students' association at the college. When he returned to Afghanistan in the mid-1960s, the route flew to Afghanistan by way of Moscow. There, Amin met the Afghan ambassador to the Soviet Union, his old friend Ali Ahmad Popel, a previous Afghan Minister of Education. During his short stay, Amin became even more radicalised. Some people, Nabi Misdaq for instance, do not believe he travelled through Moscow, but rather West Germany and Lebanon. By <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> returned to Afghanistan, the Communist People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan (PDPA) had already held its founding congress, which was in 1965. Amin ran {{as a candidate for}} the PDPA in the 1965 parliamentary election, and lost by a margin of less than fifty votes.|$|E
5|$|Mercator {{now turned}} to the modern maps, as author but no longer engraver: the practicalities of {{production}} of maps and globes had been passed to his sons and grandsons. In 1585 he issued a collection of 51 maps covering France, the Low Countries and Germany. Other maps may have followed in good order had not the misfortunes of life intervened: his wife Barbara died in 1586 and his eldest son Arnold died the following year so that only Rumold and the sons of Arnold were left to carry forward his business. In addition, <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> available for cartography was reduced by a burst of writing on philosophy and theology: a substantial written work on the Harmonisation of the Gospels as well as commentaries on the epistle of St. Paul and the book of Ezekiel.|$|E

5|$|Morales {{was born}} in the small rural village of Isallawi in Orinoca Canton, part of western Bolivia's Oruro Department, on 26 October 1959. One of seven {{children}} born to Dionisio Morales Choque and Maria Ayma, only he and two siblings, Esther and Hugo, survived past childhood. His mother almost died from a postpartum haemorrhage following his birth. Ethnically identifying {{as a member of the}} indigenous Aymara people, in keeping with Aymara custom, his father buried the placenta produced after his birth in a place specially chosen for the occasion. His childhood home was a traditional adobe house, and he grew up speaking the Aymara language, although later commentators would remark that by <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> become president he was no longer an entirely fluent speaker.|$|E
5|$|On 2 June 2003 U.S. {{authorities}} {{requested the}} Mexican government to extradite Francisco Rafael. A Mexican federal judge approved the request the following year, but the drug lord was extradited to the United States on 16 September 2006. He was flown from Matamoros, Tamaulipas, via helicopter {{and handed over}} to U.S. authorities in a prison in Brownsville, Texas, after a 10-year sentence in Mexico. He was then transferred {{to the state of}} California pending federal charges on drug trafficking. On 18 June 2007, he pleaded guilty to the possession and distribution of cocaine before U.S. District Judge Irma E. Gonzalez in a San Diego federal court. In his testimony, he admitted to selling about 250 grams of cocaine to a supplier who negotiated with an undercover Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agent in an unnamed motel in San Diego in 1980. In October 2007, Francisco Rafael was sentenced to six years in prison and with possibility to parole in four months given <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> already served in prison.|$|E
5|$|The prince's {{early death}} (and the later demise of his younger brother) had an {{enormous}} impact on PedroII: on a personal level, on his future conduct as monarch, and on the empire. In his eyes, the deaths of his only sons seemed to presage the end of the imperial system. Although the emperor still had a legal successor in his daughter Isabel, in the male-dominated society of <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> little confidence that a woman could rule Brazil. He was fond and respectful of the women in his life, but he did not consider it feasible that Isabel could survive as monarch. He did nothing to prepare Isabel for the responsibilities of ascending the throne, nor did he attempt to encourage acceptance of a female ruler among the political class.|$|E
