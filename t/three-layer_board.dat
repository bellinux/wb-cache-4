30|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to reveal the effects of various levels of mat-moisture content (m.m.c.) and the closed-press system for making single- or three-layer {{particleboard}} on the density profile, thickness swelling, specific moduli of elasticity (MOE) and rupture (MOR) and internal bond strength. Internal gas pressure was measured in an enclosed frame; and the larger the m.m.c., the higher the internal gas pressure became. When rising water vapor (steam) struck particles, it plasticized them and cured the adhesive, resulting in improved interparticle contact. The vertical density gradient in the <b>three-layer</b> <b>board</b> was larger than that in the single-layer board. As for thickness swelling by cold-water soaking, the single-layer boards were less affected than the three-layer boards and showed good dimensional stability with increased m.m.c. The open-system boards swelled more than the closed-system boards. The closed-system single-layer board made at high m.m.c. returned nearly to the prime thickness by air-drying after cold-water soaking. Specific MOE and MOR were larger at 15 % or 10 % m.m.c. than those at other m.m.c. Considerable reductions of specific MOR and MOE of the closed-system <b>three-layer</b> <b>board</b> were observed at 20 % or 25 % m.m.c.|$|E

30|$|This study {{examined}} the effects of density and layer structure on the mechanical properties and dimensional stability of strandboard manufactured from moso bamboo (Phyllostachys pubescens). The strandboard was fabricated in a laboratory at five densities and three different structures including a randomly oriented homogenous board, a unidirectionally oriented homogenous <b>board,</b> and a <b>three-layered</b> <b>board</b> with a cross-oriented core layer (BOSB). Bamboo strand alignment distribution could be predicted using the von Mises distribution function. Bending properties increased with increasing density and were affected by layer structure. The modulus of rupture (MOR) of the threelayered board in the parallel direction increased remarkably compared with the random board MOR; in the perpendicular direction, it exhibited less strength reduction. Elastic properties of the <b>three-layered</b> <b>board</b> could be predicted using elastic constants of the unidirectional board. Internal bond strength (IB) was greatly affected by density, but the layer structure effect did not appear in IB. Linear expansion per unit moisture change ranged from 0.017 to 0.022 for random and three-layered boards; these values are comparable with or lower than values for commercial board.|$|R
30|$|Strandboard panels were {{experimentally}} {{produced from}} moso bamboo (Phyllostachys pubescens) using various strand lengths and layer structures {{to evaluate the}} effects of manufacturing parameters on panel properties. The strandboard was fabricated in a laboratory using diphenylmethane diisocyanate (MDI) resin and laboratory-made strands of four lengths and four different structures. Strand alignment distributions and concentration parameter (k) values were greatly affected by strand length. A linear correlation {{was found between the}} value of k and the modulus of rupture (MOR), with correlation coefficients of 0.81 and 0.93 for unidirectional <b>boards</b> and <b>three-layer</b> <b>boards,</b> respectively. This correlation may be used to predict the strength properties of boards. Bending properties were significantly affected by both the strand length and the layer structure of the bamboo strandboard tested. Elasticity data from unidirectional boards and random boards can be used to predict the elastic properties of <b>three-layer</b> <b>boards.</b> The linear expansion (LE) of the random boards increased with decreasing strand length. The difficulty in mat forming and resin distribution for longer strands could cause deviation in modulus of elasticity (MOE) and LE, especially in strand lengths around 80 mm.|$|R

The type of applied furnishes at surface layers, moisture, and adhesive content were considered as variables, and their effects on roughness of manufactured particleboards were examined. The panels were produced with 10 % and 12 % urea formaldehyde (UF) adhesive at 10 % and 14 % moisture content. The surface characteristics were investigated. The results indicated that wood and OCC fiber utilization on the surface layer gave smoother surfaces than a control board with fine wood particles on its surface. The surface roughness decreased as adhesive and moisture content increased...|$|R
40|$|One aim {{of a joint}} European {{project called}} DIPP (Development of Innovative Particleboard (chipboard) Panels for a better {{mechanical}} performance and a lower environmental impact) {{is the development of}} lightweight particleboards made from annual/perennial farm plants such as hemp, sunflower, topinambur, maize and miscanthus. These lightweight particleboards are intended as a possible substitution for traditional wood-based particleboards used in the furniture industry. Therefore the requirements of the EN 312 concerning the moisture-related and mechanical properties of boards for interior use have to be met. The results of research have shown that the internal bond strength of one-layer lightweight particleboards made in the experiment meets the requirements of EN 312 (type P 2) and the internal bond strength of <b>three-layer</b> <b>boards</b> with topinambur in the core layer does not meet these requirement. The lightweight boards failed to meet the requirements of modulus of elastici ty and bending strength...|$|R

After that physical properties and mechanical strength measured. Overall, results have shown that use of graphite powder, increases amount of thermal conductivity significantly. Also found that modulus of rupture and modulus of elasticity had significantly increased and the thickness swelling and water absorption decreased, but they had no significant effect on shear strength parallel to surface. So the boards produced by 15 % graphite powder had maximum amount of modulus of rupture (18. 42 MPa) and modulus of elasticity (2298 MPa) and also had minimum amount of water absorption and thickness swellin...|$|R
40|$|One- and three-layer particleboards with densities varying from 200 kg/m 3 to 650 kg/m 3 are {{produced}} from hemp shives (Cannabis sativa) and stalks of sunflower (Helianthus annuus), topinambur (Helianthus tuberosus), maize (Zea mays) and miscanthus (Miscanthus sinensis gigantheus). The mechanical and physical properties of these boards are presented. Particleboards made from hemp shives, stalks of sunflower and topinambur and of low densities (400 kg/m 3 to 500 kg/m 3) {{were able to}} fulfill the minimum requirements for interal bond strength according to the EN 312 but could not achieve the adequate values of bending strength. Three-layer particleboards were made of topinambur stalks in the core layer and spruce particles in the surface layer, both bonded with UF-resin (12 % solid resin content). With a thickness of 19 mm and a density of 475 kg/m 3 these particleboards have even higher values of internal bond strength as a 22 m industrial standard particleboard made of wood chips with a density of 500 kg/m 3 or as the innovative lightweight boards made with expanded polystyrene in the core layer and a density between 430 kg/m 3 to 460 kg/m 3. The bending strength of these <b>three-layer</b> <b>boards</b> produced in the laboratory matches those of lightweight standard industrial particleboards. For a comparison between boards produced in the laboratory and in the industry, the different conditions of production have to be considered...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate the possibility of the utilization of defibrated-residual currency bills in production of fiber reinforced gypsum boards. Three gypsum contents were used, including: 1 : 2. 5, 1 : 2. 75 and 1 : 3 (wood: gypsum), based on dry weight of fibers. Defibrated residuals were used in three levels namely 20, 30 and 40 % based on their dry weight. Two different types of boards were manufactured: homogeneous and <b>three-layered</b> <b>boards.</b> Constructive gypsum powder was procured from Jabal-Gach Co. Thickness of all boards was 16 mm and their density kept constant at 1 g/cm 3. Specimens were prepared in compliance with EN- 312 for Physical and mechanical tests. Results showed that mechanical properties generally decreased with more residual fiber contents. The bending strength was significantly more in three-layered boards; however, internal bonding showed higher values in homogeneous boards. Increase in gypsum content up-to resulted in higher mechanical properties; higher gypsum content resulted in an increase only in the internal bonding values. Higher residual fiber content resulted in a significant decrease in the water absorption and thickness swelling. It may therefore be concluded that 2. 75 is a suitable mixing proportion of residual fiber composite-boards. Also, up to 30 % of residual fiber can be recommended to be used instead of wood-particles...|$|R
40|$|Red pine cone and barks {{combined}} with red pine wood particles in various proportions {{were used as}} the raw materials for one and three layered experimental particleboard manufacturing in laboratory conditions. The pine cones and barks have higher lignin, but lower holocellulose content compare to wood. For bark-based panels, the highest MOR (2. 52 MPa) corresponded to the lowest thickness swelling (9. 3 %) and marginally highest IB at 150 ºC and 8 % adhesive level. The 24 hour thickness swelling (TS) values obtained {{in this study were}} lower than the required TS-EN 312 (2005) value of 14 % for all bark-based boards. However, the single-layer bark-based boards demonstrated higher mechanical properties compared to <b>three-layer</b> <b>boards</b> using similar manufacturing conditions. The boards exposed to atmospheric conditions have considerably darkened (-DL) and lower surface roughness changes. Meanwhile, for single-layer cone boards, the highest MOR (4. 66 MPa) was found at 150 ºC and 8 % adhesive level, whereas the highest IB (1. 54 MPa) and lowest TS (32. 9 %) were found at 150 ºC and 10 % adhesive content. The cone-based panels had higher surface color changes (lightness and total color difference) compared to red pine wood panels. The particleboards produced using cone in the proportion of wood resulted in lower TS compared to boards made from only red pine wood...|$|R

Anylyses have been performed on dummy boards (models without electronic components), created as one-layered at first, then as <b>three-layered</b> PCB. <b>Board</b> is usually clamped by its longer edges with wedgelock. In order to enable the realization of boundary conditions in computional and experimental modeling, real clamping has been simplified to simply supported.

30|$|Three-layered {{composite}} oriented strand boards were manufactured using {{very thin}} hinoki (Japanese cypress, Chamaecyparis obtusa Endl.) strands oriented {{in the faces}} and mixtures of sugi (Japanese cedar, Cryptomeria japonica D. Don.) and hinoki particles in the core. The boards were composed of two density levels, with 1 : 8 : 1, 0.5 : 9 : 0.5, and 0 : 10 : 0 face: core: face ratios. Polymeric and emulsion type isocyanate resins were used. The resin contents for the strands {{in the face and}} particles in the core were 10 % and 5 %, respectively. The steam-injection press was applied at 0.62 MPa (160 °C), and the steam-injection time was 2 min. The mechanical and physical properties of the boards were evaluated based on the Japanese Industrial Standard. The parallel moduli of rupture and elasticity along the strand orientation direction and the wood screw retaining force increased with increasing face/core ratios. Incorporation of 10 %– 20 % of thin strands {{in the face of the}} boards improved the parallel moduli of rupture and elasticity by 47 %– 124 % and 30 %– 65 %, respectively. In addition, the thickness swelling after water-soaking at 20 °C for 24 h, and the parallel linear expansion after boiling for 2 h and water-soaking at 20 °C for 1 h, of the <b>three-layered</b> composite <b>boards</b> were below 8 % and 0.15 %, respectively, despite a short steam-injection press time. The thickness swelling of the boards decreased with increasing face/core ratios. In contrast, the presence of face strands seems to have a minimal effect on the moduli of rupture and elasticity along the perpendicular direction of the <b>three-layered</b> composite <b>boards.</b> A similar trend was observed for the internal bond strength, hardness, and linear expansion along the perpendicular direction.|$|R
40|$|Fault {{detection}} and diagnosis systems {{are required by}} the process industries because of tightening global competition and the increasing complexity of the processes, which results in the difficulty for operators to perform the diagnosis tasks. Academic {{research in the field}} of fault diagnosis has expanded rapidly to meet this demand and successful applications with economic benefits have been reported extensively. As a fault diagnosis method, the causal directed graph method has proved to have considerable advantages in applications with complex processes. The causal digraph method has been subjected to three development phases: signed digraph, fuzzy digraph and dynamic digraph. Being versatile with cause-effect models, the causal digraph method is able to utilize the benefits of both qualitative and quantitative diagnosis methods. However, the latest development, the dynamic causal digraph method, still has certain drawbacks {{in the case of a}} process fault. In specific situations, the {{detection and}} diagnosis results are not always reliable or sufficient to satisfy the industrial requirements. The aim of this thesis has been to enhance the traditional dynamic causal digraph method by developing a new fault detection approach and a new inference mechanism. The new detection approach produces better detection results and a more complete fault propagation path by taking into account the cancellation phenomenon of the different fault effects. The new inference mechanism is designed to identify possible faulty process components for the type of process fault. The proposed enhanced method has been tested on a generic paper machine simulator and the <b>three-layered</b> <b>board</b> machine simulator of Stora Enso Oyj. In the tests, a number of fault scenarios, sensor faults and process faults were using the proposed method. Finally, a comparison between the proposed method and the traditional method verified the improvements...|$|R
40|$|Acoustic {{properties}} of composite boards {{made out of}} bagasse were studied in this research. Urea-formaldehyde (UF) and melamine-urea-formaldehyde (MUF) adhesives were used to produce homogeneous as well as <b>three-layered</b> insulating <b>boards</b> with three densities of 0. 3, 0. 4, and 0. 5 g/cm 3. The sound absorption coefficient of experimental was measured at five frequencies of 250, 500, 1000, 2000, and 4000 Hz. Results have indicated that the sound absorption coefficient increases as the frequency is increased up to 2000 Hz; further increase in the frequency resulted in decrease in the coefficient. Two type of resins UF and MUF didn't show significant difference in sound absorption. Boards with lower density absorbed less at lower frequencies; however, increase in {{the density of the}} boards resulted in the increase in their sound absorption. Furthermore, layered boards resulted in more sound absorption coefficients at lowest frequency of 250 Hz. Higher frequencies, though, have shown more absorption coefficient. It can be concluded that composite boards made of bagasse can be recommended for production of insulating or sound-proof board...|$|R
30|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to develop a method for the effective use of both pruned wood and porcelain stone scrap. Thus, we manufactured a wood-porcelain stone composite board, which has excellent waterproof property and incombustibility properties. In addition, we examined the conditions needed to manufacture the wood-porcelain stone composite board as a construction material and evaluated the physical and mechanical properties of this board based on the Japanese Industrial Standard. The main results obtained were as follows: the wood-porcelain stone composite board made from pruned wood and porcelain stone scrap had excellent thickness swelling performance and the board had incombustibility properties that were better than commercial oriented strand board. In both single-layer and <b>three-layer</b> composite <b>boards</b> with weight ratios of porcelain stone particles of 40 %, the internal bond strength exceeded the standard value of type 18 particleboard of JIS A 5908. However, the bending properties of the composite board were inferior to the type 18 particleboard standard. Therefore, it will be necessary to improve the bending properties of the board by changing the particle sizes of both the porcelain stone scrap and the pruned wood component.|$|R
40|$|Particleboard often {{represents}} the lowest cost option amongst {{a range of}} suitable wood panel products. Particleboard consumption {{in the world is}} approximately 57 % of total wood panel consumption and the demand is growing at 2 &ndash; 3 % per year. This demand required more and more wood chipping to supply the raw materials as particleboards are traditionally made using custom flaked softwood particles. Hardwood sawmill residues have traditionally not been favoured by the particleboard industry (or indeed other forest product industries) owing to their high density and high extractive content. Throughout Australia considerable quantities of hardwood saw mill residues are produced as solid waste. In Victoria alone, over a million cubic metres of saw logs are converted annually into sawn timber, producing in excess of 200, 000 tonnes of hardwood sawdust. In recent years, the re-growth and plantation timber industry in Australia has been producing hardwood sawmill residues with lower extractive contents and lower densities. The work presented here is aimed at developing an economical methodology for making particleboard using 100 % hardwood sawmills waste. A comprehensive literature review indicated that a similar attempt has not been conducted to date. Through the literature review, major parameters which would influence particleboard made of sawmill waste were established. Subsequently, in consultation with the softwood particleboard industry, a preliminary process of making particleboards in the laboratory was developed. This method was trialled and modified until an acceptable particleboard could be produced. A systematic experimental investigation was then performed incorporating a design of experiments method (DOE) and analysis of variance (ANOVA) to investigate the behaviour of single-layer and three-layer particleboard properties separately with processing parameters. Seven processing parameters were studied for <b>three-layer</b> <b>boards</b> while six parameters were studied for single-layer boards. The particleboard testing was performed according to the Australian and New Zealand standards for reconstituted wood-based panels. It was found that three-layer particleboards can be produced using 100 % hardwood sawmill residues as the major raw material to meet the standards for general purpose particleboard. This hardwood particleboard uses a slightly higher amount of resin and moisture for its surface layer than conventional softwood particleboards. To understand the effect of processing parameters on the particleboard properties, further analysis was conducted. Based on this analysis, process models were developed to predict the most critical particleboard properties (modulus of elasticity, modulus of rupture and the vertical density profile) with respect to processing parameters. These models can be used to optimise properties of hardwood particleboard with regard to processing parameters. Also, these models can be used to produce particleboards in the laboratory with required design properties...|$|R
40|$|This note {{presents}} the results of a study of a simple model of an air-cooled electronic device mounted on a circuit board. The model includes a flush-mounted heater to represent the electronic device, a two-layer substrate to represent the circuit board, and a steady shear flow to represent the cooling fluid. Ortega provides a good review of the literature and a comprehensive introduction to conjugate methods applied to electronic cooling, emphasizing simple shear flows and single-layer substrates to illustrate basic principles. Ortega also describes two-layer effects by including infrared thermographs of a convectively cooled glass/epoxy circuit board with copper traces, which produce significant anisotropy, with larger in-plane relative to out-ofplane conductivity in the circuit board. There have been few conjugate studies with multiple conduction layers. Zebib and Wo simulated a protruding electronic module on a <b>three-layer</b> circuit <b>board,</b> but the geometry was fixed and only three fluid velocities were used. Gorobets analyzed a fin with a low-conductivity coating to simulate the effects of fin fouling. Chen et al. developed a solution that included solid, liquid, and gas phases to simulate laminar condensation on a fin. In a series of papers Lee and co-workers (Palisoc and Lee, Lee et al.) studied several different substrates with up to five layers, but these studies approximated the convective cooling by a spatially-uniform heat transfer coefficient. This note builds upon the work of one of us (Cole) for a single-layer substrate, in which results were presented for various values of the dimensionless substrate thickness and the conjugate Peclet number, (kf /ks) Pe 1 / 3. The present study adds a second layer to the substrate described by a single additional parameter that combines the thickness and conductivity of the added layer...|$|R
40|$|A novel {{metamaterial}} rectifying surface (MRS) for {{electromagnetic energy}} capture and rectification with high harvesting efficiency is presented. It is fabricated on a <b>three-layer</b> printed circuit <b>board,</b> which comprises {{an array of}} periodic metamaterial particles {{in the shape of}} mirrored split rings, a metal ground, and integrated rectifiers employing Schottky diodes. Perfect impedance matching is engineered at two interfaces, i. e. one between free space and the surface, and the other between the metamaterial particles and the rectifiers, which are connected through optimally positioned vias. Therefore, the incident electromagnetic power is captured with almost no reflection by the metamaterial particles, then channeled maximally to the rectifiers, and finally converted to direct current efficiently. Moreover, the rectifiers are behind the metal ground, avoiding the disturbance of high power incident electromagnetic waves. Such a MRS working at 2. 45 GHz is designed, manufactured and measured, achieving a harvesting efficiency up to 66. 9 % under an incident power density of 5 mW/cm 2, compared with a simulated efficiency of 72. 9 %. This high harvesting efficiency makes the proposed MRS an effective receiving device in practical microwave power transmission applications...|$|R

The strand board was manufactured using strand made from Douglas-fir beams selected from construction scrap wood. The strands were oriented, and two types of <b>three-layer</b> (face-core-face) strand <b>board</b> were manufactured: one in which the board bounded with only disposal EPS (P board), and the other in which the board bonded with disposal EPS after isocyanate compound adhesive was applied to the strand (M board).

The main results obtained were as follows: bending strength properties and internal bond (IB) strength of P board had larger than those of type 18 PB and 24 - 10 PB standard. However, thickness swelling (TS) of the board was large, and the problem in water-proof property of the board remained. Bending strength properties, IB strength and TS of M board were larger than those of type 24 - 10 PB standard. The performance of M board showed equal or larger performance than those of control board...|$|R
