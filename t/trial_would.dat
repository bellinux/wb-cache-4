5|$|After {{being told}} that nobody {{was going to be}} charged with Leigh's sexual assault, in 1990 Leigh's mother began a {{campaign}} for the case to be officially re-investigated. In August 1994, Kerry Carrington sent a 17,000-word document and 300 pages of evidence to the Royal Commission into the New South Wales Police Service, asking for the case to be investigated. The commission was headed by Judge James Roland Wood, though a representative for the commission stated that Wood's involvement in Webster's <b>trial</b> <b>would</b> not affect the outcome of any investigation. In December 1994, a representative for the commission said that after thorough consideration, they would not be investigating the matter.|$|E
5|$|Following the mistrial in Boston, the {{prosecution}} moved {{to schedule a}} new trial. LaRouche and the other defendants appealed that effort on October 5, 1988, saying that a new <b>trial</b> <b>would</b> create double jeopardy. The appeal was denied four months later. The contempt of court fines were appealed again on January 9, 1989, and affirmed again on March 29. Following the convictions in the Alexandria court, prosecutors moved to dismiss the charges from the Boston court, canceling the retrial. The LaRouche lawyers appealed that decision on March 13, 1989, arguing that they needed the trial to exonerate LaRouche.|$|E
5|$|In the 2015 Tour of Qatar, three {{different}} jerseys were awarded. The {{first of these}} was the general classification. It was calculated by adding together the times recorded in each stage of the race, then making adjustments {{to take account of}} bonus seconds won for stage victories and intermediate sprints in the road stages (the winner of the individual time trial did not receive bonus seconds). The winner of each stage received a ten-second bonus; the rider coming second received a six-second bonus; the third rider across the line received a four-second bonus. Similarly, the winner, second-placed and third-placed riders in intermediate sprints won three-, two- and one-second bonuses respectively. If two riders were tied on the same time, the precise time (to one-hundredths of a second) recorded in the time <b>trial</b> <b>would</b> have been used to separate the riders. The leader of the general classification wore a gold jersey and the winner of the competition is considered the overall winner of the race.|$|E
50|$|This {{algorithm}} is extremely inefficient. The {{maximum number of}} check <b>trials</b> <b>would</b> be m-n+1 <b>trials,</b> making the big-O efficiency at worst case O(mn). On average case, {{the maximum number of}} check <b>trials</b> <b>would</b> never be reached and only a few would be executed, resulting in an average time efficiency of O(m+n).|$|R
5000|$|Later, in 1933, Svenska Ungdomsringen för bygdekultur (The Swedish Youth Ring for Village Culture) {{created a}} system by which folk musicians could play music before {{a jury of}} experts. [...] Various awards for the {{participants}} of these <b>Trials</b> <b>would</b> be handed out at an annual [...] "National Folk Musicians' Gathering," [...] a name taken from that original event in 1910. [...] The highest award for participants in the <b>Trials</b> <b>would</b> be that same silver badge designed by Anders Zorn. Those who received this highest honor would be known as [...] "National Folk Musicians" [...] (riksspelmän).|$|R
50|$|Brigham {{died of a}} {{heart attack}} in 1993, at the age of 73, only days after {{determining}} with his attorney. His death between <b>trials</b> <b>would</b> mean that he would be presumed innocent.|$|R
5|$|It was objected yesterday, {{that there}} was no {{provision}} for a jury from the vicinage. If it could have been done with safety, {{it would not have been}} opposed. It might so happen that a <b>trial</b> <b>would</b> be impracticable in the county. Suppose a rebellion in a whole district, would it not be impossible to get a jury? The trial by jury is held as sacred in England as in America. There are deviations of it in England: yet greater deviations have happened here since we established our independence, than have taken place there for a long time, though it be left to the legislative discretion. It is a misfortune in any case that this trial should be departed from, yet in some cases it is necessary. It must be therefore left to the discretion of the legislature to modify it according to circumstances. This is a complete and satisfactory answer.|$|E
5|$|On 9 December 2015, the ORR {{announced}} that WCRC {{and the driver}} of the train were to be prosecuted for offences contrary to the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974. An initial hearing was scheduled to be heard at Swindon Magistrates Court on 11 January 2016, but postponed until 20 January. When the case opened, neither the driver Melvyn Cox nor WCRC entered pleas. The case was committed to Swindon Crown Court, where it was scheduled to be heard on 19 February; unconditional bail was granted to Cox. The case was subsequently postponed until 18 March, and then further postponed to an undisclosed date in May 2016. In late May, it was {{announced that}} the <b>trial</b> <b>would</b> begin on 27 June 2016.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} {{tried to}} enforce a controversial media law that would see Clarín lose licenses and be forced to sell most of its assets. The law was initially sanctioned as a competition law for the media, but critics pointed {{out that it is}} only being used to further the campaign against Clarín. The government had little interest in enforcing measures of the law that were not related to Clarín. Clarín launched a constitutional challenge against some articles of the law with the judiciary. The government released an anti-Clarín advertisement claiming it refused to obey the law and may be subverting democracy. The conflict led to disputes with the judiciary. Minister Julio Alak said that extending an injunction that allowed Clarín to keep its assets during the <b>trial</b> <b>would</b> be an insurrection, and it was rumored that judges who did not rule as the government wished might face impeachment. The court extended the inunction.|$|E
30|$|Non-response to ADs in MDD is {{correlated}} with hidden bipolarity (Hantouche et al. 2009; Rybakowski et al. 2010; Correa et al. 2012). Systematic screening for hypomanic symptoms during {{the selection of}} patients for controlled antidepressant <b>trials</b> <b>would</b> have several benefits. It would identify bipolarity in patients with major depressive episodes and increase the homogeneity of the samples, increase the responder rates {{and the power of}} placebo-controlled trials, and finally reduce the sample sizes required. Systematic measures of hypomanic symptoms by rating scales during the <b>trials</b> <b>would</b> help to identify the development of mixed states and switches into hypomania.|$|R

5|$|When in 2002 {{another life}} {{sentence}} prisoner challenged the Home Secretary's power to set minimum terms, Hindley {{and hundreds of}} others, whose tariffs had been increased by politicians, looked likely {{to be released from}} prison. Hindley's release seemed imminent and plans were made by supporters for her to be given a new identity. Home Secretary David Blunkett ordered Greater Manchester Police to find new charges against her, to prevent her release from prison. The investigation was headed by Superintendent Tony Brett, and initially looked at charging Hindley with the murders of Pauline Reade and Keith Bennett, but the advice given by government lawyers was that because of the DPP's decision taken 15 years earlier, a new <b>trial</b> <b>would</b> probably be considered an abuse of process.|$|E
25|$|The facts, {{if known}} by the court {{at the time of}} <b>trial,</b> <b>would</b> have {{prevented}} rendition of the judgment.|$|E
25|$|Courts have {{jurisdiction}} to prevent abuses of process {{if it would}} be unfair to try a defendant or a fair <b>trial</b> <b>would</b> not be possible.|$|E
50|$|Many {{juvenile}} court systems {{do not recognize}} a right to jury trial, {{on the grounds that}} juvenile proceedings are civil rather than criminal, and that jury <b>trials</b> <b>would</b> cause the process to become adversarial.|$|R
50|$|The Finns {{initially}} {{thought that}} the <b>trials</b> <b>would</b> be for conventional war crimes. However, as the Moscow Declaration of October 30, 1943 made clear, the Allied powers intended to prosecute for other actions as well.|$|R

25|$|March 14, 2007: Judge Kathleen A. McGuire set a {{date for}} jury {{selection}} for Addison's capital murder trial to be conducted on September 2, 2008. McGuire said that the <b>trial</b> <b>would</b> start on that date after jury selection.|$|E
50|$|In 2011, INFI {{announced}} that two phase I clinical <b>trials</b> <b>would</b> be started to explore duvelisib's effect on hematologic cancers. In July 2012, the phase I clinical trial was expanded and two phase II trials were planned.|$|R
30|$|Atenolol {{seems to}} be a safe and {{effective}} treatment for CM. Further investigations with double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized <b>trials</b> <b>would</b> be of value in order to assess the real efficacy of atenolol as a new therapeutic option for preventing CM.|$|R
50|$|On December 2006, Scientific American {{distinguished}} naproxcinod {{as one of}} the ten {{most promising}} treatments for the world's biggest health threats; however, in 2010 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration determined that further clinical <b>trials</b> <b>would</b> be needed to obtain approval.|$|R
25|$|The Halimi family {{wanted the}} trial to be {{conducted}} openly. Francis Szpiner spoke for Ruth Halimi saying: A public <b>trial</b> <b>would</b> have helped better understand the criminal machine, to make parents and teenagers reflect. It's the law of silence that killed her son, it would be unbearable for the trial to remain silent.|$|E
25|$|In March 1986, Gaggi {{was convicted}} of {{conspiracy}} to sell stolen cars, {{and was sentenced to}} five years in Lewisburg Federal Penitentiary. In 1988, Nino was transferred from Lewisburg to the Metropolitan Correction Center for his second trial. The second <b>trial</b> <b>would</b> focus on Gaggi's racketeering acts and on the 25 murders allegedly committed by the DeMeo crew.|$|E
25|$|As a {{compromise}} with the Soviets, {{it was agreed that}} while the location of the <b>trial</b> <b>would</b> be Nuremberg, Berlin would be the official home of the Tribunal authorities.

25|$|Manningham-Buller {{later told}} Parliament {{after the trial}} that the {{publicity}} which attended the Morrell <b>trial</b> <b>would</b> {{make it difficult to}} secure a fair trial on the indictment relating to Mrs Hullett, and that the second case depended very greatly on inference about not supported by admissions, as in Mrs Morrell's case, a reference to Adam's admission that he had himself injected most of Mrs Morrell's opiate injections.|$|E
25|$|A {{subsequent}} meeting, {{chaired by}} the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Austen Chamberlain, {{decided it was}} not {{in the interests of the}} British government to prosecute Sempill. Firstly Sempill's father was then aide-de-camp to King George V; any public <b>trial</b> <b>would</b> be a grave embarrassment to both The Crown and the British Establishment. Secondly a prosecution would have revealed to the Japanese that British Intelligence had cracked the cypher codes of its diplomatic service.|$|E
25|$|The DMK {{government}} {{lost power}} to the Jayalalithaa-led AIADMK government in 2001. In 2003, the party requested that the court proceedings take place outside Tamil Nadu because it doubted that a fair <b>trial</b> <b>would</b> happen under her governance. The case {{was transferred to the}} neighbouring state of Karnataka. During May 2010, Jayalalithaa's counsel argued that those in charge of the proceedings were not competent to run the case. The Supreme Court dismissed the appeal.|$|E

50|$|The {{process of}} {{extinction}} {{is such that}} trials are not reinforced, so that the CR of the animal declines when presented with the CS. A situation in which extinction procedures contain both reinforced and non-reinforced <b>trials</b> <b>would</b> weaken reacquisition. This is because, introducing reinforced <b>trials</b> during extinction <b>would</b> result in the reinforced trials being associated both with extinction and conditional learning. This would render the animal less able to rapidly learn again the CR to the stimulus.|$|R
