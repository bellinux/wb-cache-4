5|$|Bush used {{a budget}} surplus {{to push through}} Texas's largest tax-cut, $2 billion.

Critics contended that during his tenure, Texas ranked near <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>in</b> environmental evaluations. Supporters pointed to his efforts to raise the salaries of teachers and improve educational test scores.|$|E

5|$|The {{exhibition}} remained open to {{the public}} until 2005, when it was closed for a third restoration. The $12-million restoration, by Olin Conservation, Inc., of Great Falls, Virginia, started with the 26 sections of the painting and recreated its original shape of 14 panels hung from a circular railing, slightly flared out at <b>the</b> <b>bottom.</b> <b>In</b> the process, some original pieces were found of the 12 circumferential feet that had been cut away. Fourteen vertical feet of sky was also restored.|$|E
5|$|Colin Coates {{participated in}} six Winter Olympics, from 1968 to 1988, and came {{sixth in the}} 10,000m event in 1976, Australia's best result before Lillehammer. His four top-11 {{finishes}} in 1976 made him only the third Australian to place in {{the top half of}} a Winter Olympic event. Before the 1988 Olympics, three other athletes had represented Australia in long track racing, and all had placed near <b>the</b> <b>bottom.</b> <b>In</b> 1988, Danny Kah and Michael Richmond both broke into the top 15 and the top half in two events each, and in 1994, the former recorded Australia's best long track result, finishing fifth in the 5,000m event. However, Australia did not compete in long track again until 2010, when sole representative Sophie Muir became the first woman to compete for the country in the discipline; she came in the bottom fifth of entrants in both her races.|$|E

5|$|However, the {{proximal}} series {{can be directly}} compared to the ulnare and intermedium of tetrapods. The fin was clearly weight bearing, being attached to a massive shoulder with expanded scapular and coracoid elements and attached to the body armor, large muscular scars on the ventral surface of the humerus, and highly mobile distal joints. The bones of the forefins show large muscle facets, suggesting that the fin was both muscular and {{had the ability to}} flex like a wrist joint. These wrist-like features would have helped anchor the creature to <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>in</b> fast moving current.|$|E
5|$|On the upper-left side of what {{is today}} {{considered}} {{the back of the}} vessel, the mask of young Pan {{can be seen in the}} tree. Below, a goat is reaching for ripened grapes. Behind the goat lies fruit and a table, most likely an anclabris with five ceremonial vessels on top. On the left side of the table stands a small female figure, whose lit torches represent the festivities and the orgies associated with the cult's rites. Frédéric de Clarac argued that the statues could very well symbolize either Telete or Ceres, two deities often associated with Dionysus. Above the table is a tapestry and two bacchante masks. To the right, in an apple tree, another mask of Pan can be seen. Two more bacchante masks are present on <b>the</b> <b>bottom,</b> <b>in</b> front of the table.|$|E
5|$|The adult {{stage of}} a caddisfly may only survive for a few weeks; many species do not feed as adults and die soon after breeding, but some species are known to feed on nectar. The winged insects are nocturnal and provide food for night-flying birds, bats, small mammals, {{amphibians}} and arthropods. The larval stage lasts much longer, often for one or more years, and has a bigger impact on the environment. They form {{an important part of}} the diet of fish such as the trout. The fish acquire them by two means, either plucking them off vegetation or the stream-bed as the larvae move about, or during the daily behavioural drift; this drift happens during the night for many species of aquatic larvae, or around midday for some cased caddisfly species, and may result from population pressures or be a dispersal device. The larvae may drift in great numbers either close to <b>the</b> <b>bottom,</b> <b>in</b> mid-water or just below the surface. The fish swallow them whole, case and all.|$|E

5|$|The fleet {{remained}} in captivity during the negotiations that ultimately produced the Treaty of Versailles. Reuter {{believed that the}} British intended to seize the German ships on 21 June 1919, which was the deadline for Germany to have signed the peace treaty. Unaware that the deadline had been extended to the 23rd, Reuter ordered the ships to be sunk at the next opportunity. On the morning of 21 June, the British fleet left Scapa Flow to conduct training maneuvers, and at 11:20 Reuter transmitted the order to his ships. Seydlitz slipped beneath the surface at 13:50. On her side and on <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>in</b> twelve fathoms of water the wreck was frequently mistaken for a small island, and was sold in this condition as scrap to the salvage firm of Cox and Danks along with a battleship and twenty-six destroyers. The ship was raised on 2 November 1928, and while still inverted was towed south to be scrapped in Rosyth by 1930. Seydlitzs bell is {{on display at the}} Laboe Naval Memorial.|$|E
5|$|The {{ships were}} turned into {{floating}} AA batteries {{over the next}} several months although it availed them little when they were attacked again by American carrier aircraft in July. On the 24th Ise was struck by five bombs and near missed multiple times; all told she lost 50 crewmen killed and many others wounded. The bombs started numerous leaks and Ise began to settle by the bow, although she was returned to an even keel after three days pumping. Hyūga was a primary focus of the attack and she received 10 direct hits and up to 30 near misses. She was badly damaged with some 200-odd crewmen killed and 600 wounded during the attack. She slowly foundered over the next two days and was not attacked when the Americans returned four days later. This time it was Ises turn and she was struck 11 or more times with many near misses that put her on <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>in</b> shallow water with a 15 degree list. The sisters were struck off the Navy List in November and their wrecks were scrapped after the war.|$|E

25|$|Deep sea benthic {{fish can}} be divided into {{strictly}} benthic fish and benthopelagic fish.

25|$|Benthic fish, {{sometimes}} called groundfish, are denser than water, {{so they can}} rest on the sea floor.
