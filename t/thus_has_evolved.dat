50|$|Ropalidia romandi, first {{named by}} Élie Jean François Le Guillou in 1841, {{is in the}} {{subfamily}} Polistinae.

However, they share many traits with the Metrioxenini and are thus better treated as one of the three main lineages of the Oxycoryninae. The fossil record of the Metrioxenini shows that they were well distinct by the mid-Paleogene, about 50 million years ago (mya).

40|$|RNA viruses are {{particularly}} vulnerable to RNAi-based defenses in the host, and <b>thus</b> <b>have</b> <b>evolved</b> specific proteins, known as viral suppressors of RNA silencing (VSRs), as a counterdefense. In this issue of Genes & Development, Azevedo and colleagues (pp. 904 - 915) discovered that P 38, the VSR of Turnip crinkle virus, uses its glycine/tryptophane (GW) motifs as an ARGONAUTE (AGO) hook to attract and disarm the host's essential effector of RNA silencing. Several GW motif-containing cellular proteins {{are known to be}} important partners of AGOs in RNA silencing effector complexes in yeast, plants, and animals. The GW motif appears to be a versatile and effective tool for regulating the activities of RNA silencing pathways, and the use of GW mimicry to compete for and inhibit host AGOs may be a strategy used by many pathogens to counteract host RNAi-based defenses. © 2010 by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press...|$|R
50|$|Many {{pathogens}} are {{too large}} to fit through the small pores of the peritrophic matrix, and <b>thus</b> <b>have</b> <b>evolved</b> specialized mechanisms of evading being filtered out by the matrix. Since type I peritrophic matrixes are secreted {{in response to the}} presence of a food bolus in the midgut, some pathogens simply invade the epithelial cells before the matrix is excreted. Many helminth microfilaria and arboviruses (arthropod borne viruses) are transmitted to the mosquito in their infective form and are able to immediately invade mosquito tissue. However, other pathogens such as the malaria protozoan must first develop into an infective stage within the midgut before invading other tissues. These pathogens secrete chitinase and proteinase enzymes which dissolve the chitin microfibrils and proteins present in the peritrophic matrix. These enzymes open large holes in the membrane, allowing the pathogen to infect the epithelium and other tissues in the insect.|$|R

In bacteria, these elements {{are involved in}} intrinsic and acquired resistance to antibiotics. Unlike other well-known horizontally acquired antibiotic resistance determinants, genes encoding for multidrug efflux pumps belong {{to the core of}} bacterial genomes and <b>thus</b> <b>have</b> <b>evolved</b> over millions of years. The selective pressure stemming from the use of antibiotics to treat bacterial infections is relatively recent in evolutionary terms.

40|$|Studies on the {{relationship}} between the optimal phenotype and its environment have had limited focus on genotype-to-phenotype pathways and their evolutionary consequences. Here, we study how multi-layered trait architecture and its associated constraints prescribe diversity. Using an idealized model of the emotion system in fish, we find that trait architecture yields genetic and phenotypic diversity even in absence of frequency-dependent selection or environmental variation. That is, for a given environment, phenotype frequency distributions are predictable while gene pools are not. The conservation of phenotypic traits among these genetically different populations is due to the multi-layered trait architecture, in which one adaptation at a higher architectural level can be achieved by several different adaptations at a lower level. Our results emphasize the role of convergent evolution and the organismal level of selection. While trait architecture makes individuals more constrained than what has been assumed in optimization theory, the resulting populations are genetically more diverse and adaptable. The emotion system in animals may <b>thus</b> <b>have</b> <b>evolved</b> by natural selection because it simultaneously enhances three important functions, the behavioural robustness of individuals, the evolvability of gene pools and the rate of evolutionary innovation at several architectural levels...|$|R
40|$|Male {{secondary}} sexual characters may <b>have</b> <b>evolved</b> as intra- or intersexual {{signals of}} male phenotypic or genetic quality. In birds, singing performance {{may have the}} function to honestly reveal. health and vigor of individual males. Infectious diseases and poor body conditions would therefore be expected to negatively influence singing performance. Since bird pathogens are known to elicit both a humoral and a cell-mediated immune response, it can be predicted that a negative relationship exists between singing performance and activity of the immune system. This prediction was tested {{for the first time}} in this correlational study. The relationships between song rate and features and hematological variables (concentration of leukocytes in peripheral blood, ratio of gamma-globulins to total plasma proteins, Mood cell sedimentation ratej •hematocrit) and body condition were analyzed in a population of barn swallows (Hirundo rustica). Song rate was negatively correlated with lymphocyte concentration and with the ratio of gamma-globulins to plasma proteins. Spectrographic analysis showed that features of song were not significantly correlated with hematological variables or body condition. The level of circulating testosterone was not correlated with song rate nor hematological variables. Thii study is the first to show a correlation between a bird's singing performance and hematological profile and suggests that song rate of male barn swallows may reflect their health status.

There is, however, limited evidence for the applicability of Baker 2 ̆ 7 s Rule to invasive plants. We determined the breeding systems of three invasive milkweed species-Asclepias curassavica, Gomphocarpus fruticosus and G. physocarpus-in their invaded range in south-east Queensland, Australia. Although dependent on pollinators for reproduction, hand-pollinations revealed that all three species are self-compatible {{which is consistent with}} Baker 2 ̆ 7 s Rule and notable because milkweeds are generally self-incompatible. In progeny performance trials, seedlings from self-pollinations generally did not perform as well as those from cross-pollinations, but the differences were minor. Evidence for self-compatibility in G. physocarpus is a particularly noteworthy feature of this study, as this species has been reported to be self-incompatible in its native range and may <b>thus</b> <b>have</b> <b>evolved</b> self-compatibility during the invasion process. Furthermore, potential for hybridization between the two Gomphocarpus species was observed. Hybridization may have assisted the invasion of these species through providing additional sources of pollen and/or broadening genetic variation.

Five amplified fragments appeared to be specific to R. solanacearum. Fifteen different profiles were identified among the 120 bacterial strains, and a hierarchical cluster analysis distributed them into eight clusters. Each cluster included strains belonging to a single biovar, except for strains of biovars 3 and 4, which could not be separated. However, the biovar 1 strains showed rather extensive diversity since they were distributed into five clusters whereas the biovar 2 and the biovar 3 and 4 strains were gathered into one and two clusters, respectively. PCR-RFLP analysis of the hrp gene region confirmed the results of previous studies which split the species into an “Americanum” division including biovar 1 and 2 strains and an “Asiaticum” division including biovar 3 and 4 strains. However, the present study showed that most of the biovar 1 strains, originating from African countries (Reunion Island, Madagascar, Zimbabwe, and Angola) and being included in a separate cluster, belong to the “Asiaticum” rather than to the “Americanum” division.

Copy numbers of the remaining 992 ranged from 4 to 14, including homeologs, orthologs, and paralogs. Of the genes with three structural copies corresponding to homeologs, 55 % expressed from all three, 38 % from two, and the remaining 7 % expressed from {{only one of the}} three copies.

40|$|Glutamate- 1 -semialdehyde 2, 1 -aminomutase (GSAM) is {{the second}} enzyme in the C(5) pathway of tetrapyrrole {{biosynthesis}} found in most bacteria, in archaea and in plants. It catalyzes the transamination of glutamate- 1 -semialdehyde to 5 -aminolevulinic acid (ALA) in a pyridoxal 5 '-phosphate (PLP) -dependent manner. We present the crystal structure of GSAM from the thermophilic cyanobacterium Thermosynechococcus elongatus (GSAM(Tel)) in its PLP-bound form at 2. 85 A resolution. GSAM(Tel) is a symmetric homodimer, whereas GSAM from Synechococcus (GSAM(Syn)) {{has been described as}} asymmetric. The symmetry of GSAM(Tel) thus challenges the previously proposed negative cooperativity between monomers of this enzyme. Furthermore, GSAM(Tel) reveals an extensive flexible region at the interface of the proposed complex of GSAM with glutamyl-tRNA reductase (GluTR), the preceding enzyme in tetrapyrrole biosynthesis. Compared to GSAM(Syn), the monomers of GSAM(Tel) are rotated away from each other along the dimerization interface by 10 degrees. The associated flexibility of GSAM may be essential for complex formation with GluTR to occur. Unexpectedly, we find that GSAM is structurally related to 5 -aminolevulinate synthase (ALAS), the ALA-producing enzyme in the Shemin pathway of alpha-proteobacteria and non-plant eukaryotes. This structural relationship applies also to the corresponding subfamilies of PLP-dependent enzymes. We thus propose that the CoA-subfamily (including ALAS) and the aminotransferase subfamily II (including GSAM) are evolutionarily closely related and that ALAS may <b>thus</b> <b>have</b> <b>evolved</b> from GSAM...|$|R

Modern system-on-chips augment their baseline CPU with coprocessors and accelerators to increase overall computational capacity and power efficiency, and <b>thus</b> <b>have</b> <b>evolved</b> into heterogeneous systems. Several languages {{have been developed to}} enable this paradigm shift, including CUDA and OpenCL. This thesis discusses a unified compilation environment to enable heterogeneous system design through the use of OpenCL and a customised VLIW chip multiprocessor (CMP) architecture, known as the LE 1. An LLVM compilation framework was researched and a prototype developed to enable the execution of OpenCL applications on the LE 1 CPU. The framework fully automates the compilation flow and supports work-item coalescing to better utilise the CPU cores and alleviate the effects of thread divergence. This thesis discusses in detail both the software stack and target hardware architecture and evaluates the scalability of the proposed framework on a highly precise cycle-accurate simulator. This is achieved through the execution of 12 benchmarks across 240 different machine configurations, as well as further results utilising an incomplete development branch of the compiler. It is shown that the problems generally scale well with the LE 1 architecture, up to eight cores, when the memory system becomes a serious bottleneck.
