5|$|Sesame Street {{has been}} used to test the {{attention}} span of infants and toddlers. In 2004, children from three months to two years were shown Sesame Street clips and a group of computer-generated black and white patterns. Their attention spans, as determined by the duration of time they looked at <b>the</b> <b>stimuli,</b> significantly increased at six to twenty-four months, but only for the Sesame Street material. A study conducted in 2006 found that infants' attention span increased more when they were presented with video clips than with still images of the same stimuli, supporting the idea that movement helps young infants gain more information from the world around them. The evidence showed that attention span depended both on age and the on the type of stimuli children viewed. The time they looked at stimuli decreased for all types of stimuli from fourteen to twenty-six weeks, but the time they looked at it increased depending on <b>the</b> <b>stimuli.</b> When older infants (age fourteen weeks to twelve months) looked at Sesame Street materials and human faces, their attention increased compared to other types of stimuli.|$|E
5|$|Later studies {{investigated}} {{aspects of}} the effect. Koole, Dijksterhuis, and van Knippenberg sought to explore how automatic the preference process was. They did this with both numbers and letters. They divided participants into two groups. The first group was asked to give quick, intuitive reactions stating preferences for <b>the</b> <b>stimuli.</b> The second group was asked to reason why they liked some numbers better than others and to analyse which features of the numbers they liked. As the researchers had predicted, they found that both the birthday-number effect and name-letter effect disappeared in the ‘thinking’ condition. They argued that thinking about reasons instigates deliberative overriding of implicit self-esteem effects. This conclusion was supported by looking at correlations between the effects: whereas in the feeling condition {{the strength of a}} participant's birthday-number effect was correlated to his or her name-letter effect, no such correlation was found in the thinking condition.|$|E
25|$|Combining {{the brain}} bias towards facial {{processing}} and surface discovery, a follow-up study by Dr. Vuilleumier exposed subjects to paired visual stimuli in three phases. In the initial phase, stimuli were simply bilateral pairs, and extinction frequency was measured. In the next stage, <b>the</b> <b>stimuli</b> were surrounded with an oval, {{so that they}} appeared to represent eyes in a face. The extinction rate for this appearance was greatly reduced. Finally, the patients were shown <b>the</b> <b>stimuli</b> minus the contextual oval – however, the reduced extinction rate persisted, as though the patients had learned to group these stimuli. The effect did not occur when <b>the</b> <b>stimuli</b> were surrounded by a nonoval shape, pointing towards facial processing as being {{the key to this}} phenomenon.|$|E
40|$|A {{peripheral}} uniform stimulus on {{a uniform}} background tends to fade when a ring enclosing <b>the</b> <b>stimulus</b> is flashed briefly, indicating that neural signals external to <b>the</b> <b>stimulus</b> {{such as those}} from the ring or those from the background tend to inhibit the onset-response or after-discharge of <b>the</b> <b>stimulus.</b> In this study, a peripheral achromatic line was flashed briefly on an achromatic background while the subject was steadily fixating on a point on the background. It was predicted that <b>the</b> <b>stimulus</b> line would fade due to background inhibition of the onset-response or after-discharge of <b>the</b> <b>stimulus.</b> On a reference line, subjects indicated two points delimiting the part of <b>the</b> <b>stimulus</b> line which looked uniform in intensity of color. These points converged {{toward the center of}} the reference line as the luminance of <b>the</b> <b>stimulus</b> line approached that of the background. Compared to the central uniform part, the nonuniform parts near the endpoints of <b>the</b> <b>stimulus</b> line looked more faded. These results support the idea that the background surrounding a stimulus tends to inhibit the onset-response of after-discharge of <b>the</b> <b>stimulus...</b>|$|R
5000|$|The stimulus-model {{comparator}} theory {{emerged from}} the research of Sokolov who used the orienting response as the cornerstone of his studies, and operationally defining the orienting response as EEG activity. Orienting responses are heightened sensitivity experienced by an organism when exposed to a new or changing stimulus. Orienting responses can result in overt, observable behaviors as well as psychophysiological responses such as EEG activity and undergo habituation with repeated presentation of <b>the</b> eliciting <b>stimulus.</b> <b>The</b> Sokolov model [...] assumes that when a stimulus is experienced several times the nervous system creates a model of <b>the</b> expected <b>stimulus</b> (a stimulus model). With additional presentations of <b>the</b> <b>stimulus</b> <b>the</b> experienced <b>stimulus</b> is compared with <b>the</b> <b>stimulus</b> model. If <b>the</b> experienced <b>stimulus</b> matches <b>the</b> <b>stimulus</b> model responding is inhibited. At first <b>the</b> <b>stimulus</b> model {{is not a very}} good representation of <b>the</b> presented <b>stimulus</b> and therefore there is a mismatch and responding continues, but with additional presentations <b>the</b> <b>stimulus</b> model is improved; consequently {{there is no longer a}} mismatch and responding is inhibited causing habituation. However, if <b>the</b> <b>stimulus</b> is changed so that it no longer matches <b>the</b> <b>stimulus</b> model <b>the</b> inhibition of the orienting response is weakened, and an orienting response returns. Sokolov places the location of the Stimulus-Model within the cerebral cortex of the brain.|$|R

25|$|Negative priming is {{believed}} to {{play a crucial role}} in attention and memory retrieval processes. When stimuli are perceived through the senses, all <b>the</b> <b>stimuli</b> are encoded within the brain, where each stimulus has its own internal representation. In this perceiving process, some of <b>the</b> <b>stimuli</b> receive more attention than others. Similarly, only some of them are stored in short-term memory. Negative priming is highly related to the selective nature of attention and memory.|$|E
25|$|By {{repeatedly}} and carefully having a patient think about or encounter <b>the</b> <b>stimuli</b> and confront the emotions they are feeling, they will experience {{less and less}} distress.

25|$|Some {{experiments}} may use additional interferences such as {{changing the}} position of <b>the</b> <b>stimuli</b> or presenting completely irrelevant stimuli during either of these trials.

50|$|A neutral {{stimulus}} is {{a stimulus}} which initially produces no specific response other than focusing attention. In classical conditioning, when used {{together with an}} unconditioned <b>stimulus,</b> <b>the</b> neutral <b>stimulus</b> becomes a conditioned stimulus. With repeated presentations of both <b>the</b> neutral <b>stimulus</b> and <b>the</b> unconditioned <b>stimulus,</b> <b>the</b> neutral <b>stimulus</b> will elicit a response as well, known as a conditioned response. Once <b>the</b> neutral <b>stimulus</b> elicits a conditioned response, <b>the</b> neutral <b>stimulus</b> becomes known as a conditioned <b>stimulus.</b> <b>The</b> conditioned response {{is the same as}} the unconditioned response, but occurs in the presence of <b>the</b> conditioned <b>stimulus</b> rather than <b>the</b> unconditioned <b>stimulus.</b>|$|R
25|$|Depression {{or having}} {{previously}} been depressed probably {{is due to}} altered brain structure or alters brain structure. Patients who have been depressed or are depressed show more activation to negative stimuli in emotion.

25|$|In Biological {{theory and}} the concept of archetypes, Michael Fordham {{considered}} that innate release mechanisms in animals may be applicable to humans, especially in infancy. <b>The</b> <b>stimuli</b> which produce instinctive behaviour are selected from a wide field by an innate perceptual system and the behaviour is 'released'.

25|$|Discrepancy in vowel {{category}} {{significantly reduced}} {{the magnitude of}} the McGurk effect for fusion responses. Auditory /a/ tokens dubbed onto visual /i/ articulations were more compatible than the reverse. This could be because /a/ has a wide range of articulatory configurations whereas /i/ is more limited, which makes it much easier for subjects to detect discrepancies in <b>the</b> <b>stimuli.</b> /i/ vowel contexts produce the strongest effect, while /a/ produces a moderate effect, and /u/ has almost no effect.|$|E

40|$|Studies {{investigating}} {{the effect of}} visual illusions on saccadic eye movements have provided {{a wide variety of}} results. In this study, we test three factors that might explain this variability: the spatial predictability of <b>the</b> <b>stimulus,</b> <b>the</b> duration of <b>the</b> <b>stimulus</b> and <b>the</b> latency of the saccades. Participants made a saccade from one end of a Müller-Lyer figure to the other end. By changing the spatial predictability of <b>the</b> <b>stimulus,</b> we find that the illusion has a clear effect on saccades (16 %) when <b>the</b> <b>stimulus</b> is at a highly predictable location. Even stronger effects of the illusion are found when <b>the</b> <b>stimulus</b> location becomes more unpredictable (19 – 23 %). Conversely, manipulating the duration of <b>the</b> <b>stimulus</b> fails to reveal a clear difference in illusion effect. Finally, by computing the illusion effect for different saccadic latencies, we find a maximum illusion effect (about 30 %) for very short latencies, which decreases by 7 % with every 100  ms latency increase. We conclude that spatial predictability of <b>the</b> <b>stimulus</b> and saccadic latency influences the effect of the Müller-Lyer illusion on saccades...|$|R

25|$|Patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), {{the most}} common form of dementia, have been studied {{extensively}} as far as priming goes. Results are conflicting in some cases, but overall, AD patients show decreased priming effects on word-stem completion and free association tasks, while retaining normal performance on lexical decision tasks. These results suggest that AD patients are impaired in any sort of priming task that requires semantic processing of <b>the</b> <b>stimuli,</b> while priming tasks that require visuoperceptual interpretation of stimuli are unaffected by Alzheimers.|$|E
25|$|The actin {{protein is}} found in both the {{cytoplasm}} and the cell nucleus.

In Dictyostelium, phospholipase D {{has been found to}} intervene in inositol phosphate pathways. Actin filaments are particularly stable and abundant in muscle fibres. Within the sarcomere (the basic morphological and physiological unit of muscle fibres) actin is present in both the I and A bands; myosin is also present in the latter.|$|E
25|$|Color {{vision is}} the ability of an {{organism}} or machine to distinguish objects based on the wavelengths (or frequencies) of the light they reflect, emit, or transmit. Colors can be measured and quantified in various ways; indeed, a person's perception of colors is a subjective process whereby the brain responds to <b>the</b> <b>stimuli</b> that are produced when incoming light reacts with the several types of cone cells in the eye. In essence, different people see the same illuminated object or light source in different ways.|$|E
40|$|Imprinted ducklings {{were trained}} to peck a pole using brief presentations of <b>the</b> {{imprinted}} <b>stimulus</b> as <b>the</b> response-contingent (reinforcing) event. Subjects were then permitted to spend extended periods with continuous access to food and <b>the</b> imprinted <b>stimulus</b> (via a pole peck).

When, however, there was continuous opportunity to respond for <b>the</b> <b>stimulus</b> and food was available, the tendency to respond was related to the tendency to feed. Other experiments showed that independent presentations of <b>the</b> <b>stimulus</b> could initiate feeding in imprinted ducklings with no prior pairing of <b>the</b> <b>stimulus</b> with food and with no prior pole-peck training. The most consistent control over feeding, however, was exhibited by ducklings that were imprinted and also accustomed to periodic removals of <b>the</b> <b>stimulus.</b> It is concluded that in ducklings, imprinting procedures are sufficient to endow an arbitrary <b>stimulus</b> with <b>the</b> capacity to release feeding behavior...|$|R
50|$|Thigmonasty {{differs from}} thigmotropism in that nastic motion is {{independent}} of the direction of <b>the</b> <b>stimulus.</b> For example, tendrils from a climbing plant are thigmotropic because they twine around any support they touch, responding in whichever direction <b>the</b> <b>stimulus</b> came from.

25|$|There {{are a few}} {{problems}} associated with this inhibition model. This model accounts for negative priming only when <b>the</b> <b>stimuli</b> are repetitively ignored as distractors during a goal directed behavior of selecting the target stimulus. This model does not support negative priming effects found in cases short of goal directed behavior. Another issue is that negative priming effects {{have been found to}} be long-term contradicting to the proposed transient residual inhibition. Long-term persistence of negative priming questions the validity of the distractor inhibition model.|$|E
25|$|Perceptual priming {{is based}} on the form of the {{stimulus}} and is enhanced by the match between the early and later stimuli. Perceptual priming is sensitive to the modality and exact format of the stimulus. An example of perceptual priming is the identification of an incomplete word in a word-stem completion test. The presentation of the visual prime {{does not have to be}} perfectly consistent with later testing presentations in order to work. Studies have shown that, for example, the absolute size of <b>the</b> <b>stimuli</b> can vary and still provide significant evidence of priming.|$|E
25|$|Treatments {{aiming to}} inhibit works to block {{specific}} caspases. Finally, the Akt protein kinase promotes cell survival through two pathways. Akt phosphorylates and inhibits Bas (a Bcl-2 family member), causing Bas {{to interact with}} the 14-3-3 scaffold, resulting in Bcl dissociation and thus cell survival. Akt also activates IKKα, which leads to NF-κB activation and cell survival. Active NF-κB induces the expression of anti-apoptotic genes such as Bcl-2, resulting in inhibition of apoptosis. NF-κB has been found to play both an antiapoptotic role and a proapoptotic role depending on <b>the</b> <b>stimuli</b> utilized and the cell type.|$|E
