But there's a bigger evil above <b>them</b> <b>and</b> <b>you</b> start rooting for the bad guy". The six-part series will be a co-production between streaming service HOOQ, Globe Telecom's Globe Studios, and Matti's Reality Entertainment; it will be exclusively available on HOOQ. Directed by Matti himself, the ensemble cast will feature Leo Martinez reprising his film role, Arjo Atayde, Teroy Guzman, Bela Padilla, Neil Ryan Sese, Dominic Ochoa, Smokey Manaloto, Jake Macapagal, Ria Atayde, and Christopher de Leon. Of the project, Matti said: ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with MTV News, Bernthal stated that Walsh was suffering from the [...] "loneliness you feel when you're right there with <b>them</b> <b>and</b> <b>you</b> can't be {{with them in the}} way you want." [...] Bernthal applauded the writers for such changes, and felt that the storyline never devitalized. [...] "The people that Shane loved more {{than anyone else in the}} world before the apocalypse are still very much alive and still very much with him, but he'll never be with them in the way he wants to and the way he once was. Every relationship—Shane/Carl, Shane/Lori and Shane/Rick—it's tainted and fractured. When you suffer from that kind of loneliness, it brings out the worst in you." ...|$|E

500|$|On May 25, {{during a}} game against the Florida Marlins, Posey was injured during a {{collision}} with Scott Cousins at home plate as Cousins scored the eventual-winning run on a sac fly in the 12th inning of a 7–6 Giants' loss. In the aftermath, Posey suffered a fractured fibula and torn ligaments in his ankle, requiring season-ending surgery. Cousins, who was not disciplined, said he collided with Posey intentionally in order to score. [...] "If you hit them, you punish <b>them</b> <b>and</b> <b>you</b> punish yourself, but you have a chance of that ball coming out." [...] He expressed regret over injuring Posey, saying [...] "I certainly didn’t want him to get hurt." [...] Cousins received threats from fans, but Posey denounced them: [...] "I appreciate the continued support of Giants fans and others as I begin the process of working my way back ... But in no way do I condone threats of any kind against Scott Cousins or his family. As I said last week, I'm not out to vilify Scott." [...] In 45 games, Posey batted [...]284 with 17 runs scored, 46 hits, five doubles, four home runs, and 21 RBI.|$|E
500|$|On the reveal, Dohring {{said in an}} interview: [...] "I’m {{actually}} glad, Rob told {{us about}} episode six or seven that we would get together. We were like, ‘No way!’ But there was something going on there. We could feel it as actors. It was damn cool – these characters {{had some kind of}} connection. So we had to start to soften {{it up a little bit}} and break the ice somewhat [...] I’m glad he gave us that heads up." [...] Lead actress Kristen Bell expressed surprise over the initial decision by saying, [...] "I love working with Jason and he's such a great actor to work opposite, but sometimes, I feel it's really just weird luck. Somehow people get magic dust sprinkled on <b>them</b> <b>and</b> <b>you</b> don't know why. You look like you have boatloads of chemistry with someone else." [...] On the kiss itself, Dohring noted, [...] "It was so funny, as an actor, to kiss this girl. I was all nervous beforehand. But you have to just let it go for the scene. It was so fun to watch ," [...] adding that [...] "a lot of that emotion was real for me." [...] The song [...] "Momentary Thing" [...] by band Something Happens plays during Veronica and Logan's first kiss.|$|E

2500|$|Lewis Maltby, {{founder of}} the National Work Rights Institute, is highly {{critical}} of the decision. He castigated the public-concern requirement as [...] " [...] the Court just made up" [...] in his book Can They Do That?. [...] "Justice White seems to have missed the Catch-22 quality of his rule", he wrote. [...] "You don't need to question management when you agree with <b>them,</b> <b>and</b> <b>you</b> can't question management when you disagree with them because the very act of questioning them could hurt your working relationship." [...] With exceptions like McPherson, he believes this rule has cost too many public employees their jobs. [...] "The sad reality is that freedom of speech is a myth where your employment is concerned, whether you work in the private or the public sector." ...|$|E
2500|$|Brinkman {{also worked}} to limit state {{spending}} {{just as he}} had opposed local projects. In 2003, he opposed Taft's [...] "Third Frontier" [...] project and the bond issue on the November ballot as Issue One which would have permitted the state to borrow money to subsidize business's research and development. [...] "Who would have thought a Republican governor would run on this?" [...] Brinkman said (Issue One was soundly defeated by voters). When Taft proposed in 2004 the question once more be submitted to the voters, Brinkman renewed his criticism. [...] "Corporate welfare is corporate welfare. Just because you buy off the manufacturers with more money for <b>them,</b> <b>and</b> <b>you</b> buy off the farmers, doesn't change what it is." [...] He said he would join Democrats in voting against its placement on the November 2005 ballot.|$|E

2500|$|Even modern grandmasters {{study the}} book. Frank Brady {{wrote in his}} {{biography}} of World Champion Bobby Fischer that Chess Openings Ancient and Modern {{was one of the}} most heavily annotated books in Fischer's personal library. Fischer had pencilled in his own analyses of the Scotch Game, Giuoco Piano, Evans Gambit, Bishop's Gambit, Danish Gambit, and other openings. Specifically referring to the analysis in Chess Openings Ancient and Modern, Grandmaster Robert Byrne wrote in a 1991 New York Times chess column, [...] "Ingenious strategies and tactics were tried out in the old days, and if your opponent knows <b>them</b> <b>and</b> <b>you</b> don't, you are in for a pounding." [...] Likewise Fischer, in his famous book My 60 Memorable Games, annotating an Evans Gambit that he had won against Reuben Fine, cited analysis from the 1893 edition of Chess Openings Ancient and Modern as an improvement on Fine's ninth move.|$|E
2500|$|... "It {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{excellent}} provisions of Nature" [...] he wrote in a chapter for the warmest time of the year [...] "that chub are to be angled for on hot summer afternoons ... When the grass is high and full of hum and rustle, when the comfrey blooms along the edge of the water and the air shivers in the heat, the chub lie just under the surface in slacks and corners and eddies all along the bank. You will see <b>them</b> <b>and</b> <b>you</b> will think they have not seen you". His writing and contacts among anglers saw the president of the Piscatorial Society, Sir Robert Saundby, asking Hargreaves to organise the Society's library. With typical thoroughness the collection was removed to Jack's home, leaving it fully catalogued with not a volume unread. This was when he became sceptical about the opinion of the immortal 17th century author of The Compleat Angler, Izaak Walton, as to the culinary qualities of the chub – a dish Hargreaves described as [...] "eating cotton wool full of pins and needles".|$|E
2500|$|The album {{ends with}} the song [...] "North Star," [...] {{which serves as a}} [...] "closing credits" [...] type of song. In regard to this track and Popa Wu's inclusion, RZA later remarked [...] "The idea is Rae did {{everything}} he had to do. Everything is over now. The job is over. Mission is over, it's a perfect closing to the album. Popa Wu was a very smart mentor in the younger days to me and ODB. Everybody had dibs and dabs of knowledge of self, I brought him in to be a mentor to these men like, 'I love <b>them</b> <b>and</b> <b>you</b> the only person I know that have the intelligence to keep them in sync with knowledge.' It's very poisonous unless they got proper guidance. He was the smartest man I'd ever met at a certain time in my life." [...] Raekwon further commented [...] "'North Star' was a track I really, really wanted on my album. It was a track that I felt a vibe of it was motion picture-like." ...|$|E

2500|$|Wendy Leigh, {{who wrote}} an {{unofficial}} biography on Schwarzenegger, claims he plotted his political rise {{from an early}} age using the movie business and bodybuilding as building blocks to escape a depressing home. Leigh portrays Schwarzenegger as obsessed with power and quotes him as saying, [...] "I {{wanted to be part of}} the small percentage of people who were leaders, not the large mass of followers. I think it is because I saw leaders use 100% of their potential– I was always fascinated by people in control of other people." [...] Schwarzenegger has said that it was never his intention to enter politics, but he says, [...] "I married into a political family. You get together with <b>them</b> <b>and</b> <b>you</b> hear about policy, about reaching out to help people. I was exposed to the idea of being a public servant and Eunice and Sargent Shriver became my heroes." [...] Eunice Kennedy Shriver was sister of John F. Kennedy, and mother-in-law to Schwarzenegger; Sargent Shriver is husband to Eunice and father-in-law to Schwarzenegger.|$|E
2500|$|When {{asked how}} he beat his addictions, Cornell stated, [...] "It was {{a long period of}} coming to the {{realization}} that this way (sober) is better.

There’s nothing you can do...if your best friend has a problem and it's very serious, there's nothing you're going to be able to do about it and it was sad for me and the people around me. Sad for me when friends of mine died because of it." ...|$|E
