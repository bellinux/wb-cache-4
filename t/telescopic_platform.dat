40|$|This {{thesis is}} about {{the design of the}} <b>telescopic</b> <b>{{platform}}.</b> which should be fasten on robot called Breach. Purpose of this platform is to carry another equipment like sensors, cameras or manipulator. The platform has to provide chiefly the high demands on load capacity. Another part of the thesis is design of mechanism placed on this <b>telescopic</b> <b>platform,</b> or just on the robot Breach. This mechanism has to load up small subject on the top part of the platform and then unload it on chosen place. Only thing defined for this subjekt is maximal weight of 2 kilograms, but other parameters aren´t specified. Construction is therefore focused on maximal versatility of this mechanism...|$|E
40|$|In this study, {{vibration}} {{analysis of}} a <b>telescopic</b> <b>platform</b> is conducted, and the platform structure is reconstructed to satisfy vibrational standards. The analysis is realised using solid modelling, finite elements and an analytical method. The results are verified using experimental modal techniques. Through the finite element and experimental modal approach free vibration analysis is carried out and natural frequencies are determined. Additionally, vibration accelerations of the structure are obtained by forced vibration analysis of the model. All calculations one performed on the new reconstructed structure, and it is determined whether the reconstructed structure satisfies the vibrational standards...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. General {{arguments}} for optimized coronagraphy {{in the search}} for planets are presented. First, off-axis telescopes provide the best <b>telescopic</b> <b>platforms</b> for use with coronagraphy, and telescope fabrication technology now allows the fabrication of such telescopes with diameters of up to 6. 5 m. We show that in certain circumstances a smaller telescope with an off-axis primary has a signal-to-noise advantage compared with larger Cassegrain telescopes. Second, to fully exploit the advantages of the coronagraph for suppressing stray light, it is necessary to use a high Strehl ratio adaptive optics system. This can be best achieved initially with modest aperture telescopes of 3 – 4 m in diameter. Third, application of simultaneous differential imaging and simultaneous polarimetric techniques are required to reach the photon-limit of coronagraphic imaging. These three developments, if pursued together, will yield significant improvements {{in the search for}} planets. 1...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Existing {{applications}} {{solving problems}} of full-strokes {{are based on}} using non-synchronized telescopic guides working with mechanical, hydraulic or pneumatic motion drives [1]-[4]. In these cases the full-stroke in general {{is not possible to}} position and control reliably. One of the disadvantage of non-synchronized full-strokes using especially double-sided full-stroke is uncontrollable movement of extending parts, which can stagnate in various positions during the working cycle. Creating of a synchronized full-stroke using mechanical kinematic structure between particular components of the telescopic unit can solve these problems mentioned above.

40|$|The International Space Station (ISS) {{offers an}} {{opportunity}} to place and accomodate research equipment in LEO for a large variety of experiments. Through the Express Pallets System, already in the earlyphase of its utilisation, instruments can be installtes on prefabricated Adapters, for easy connection and control via the ISS. This concept will allow {{to gain access to}} a spaceborn 75 cm telescope, equipped with a spectrometer and camera system, to perform observations of solar system objects. Particular emphasis will be put on NEOs (asteroids and comets in near-earth space), where the proposed observatory shall be operated in close co-operation with ground-stations to complement and extend observations of newly discovered NEOs. Besides the observation of NEOs, the International Space Station <b>Telescopic</b> Observation <b>Platform</b> (ISSTOP) will facilitate teh spectral characterisation of mainbelt asteroids, the Moon and Mercury, and will allow to monitor variable phenomena on Venus, Mars and the outer planets. Taking advantage of the space location (no atmospheric disturbances, no seeing limitations, unrestricted wavelength coverage from UV to IR), a relatively small (75 cm mirror) telescope will make considerablecontributions for: Characterisation of the physical properties of NEOs, already shortly after their discovery and extending the orbital arc of objects covered with high-accuracy astrometric observations on order to improve orbit determination during the discovery apparition (through rapid reaction times, and 24 hour all sky access, even close to the vicinity of the sun); complementary search efforts in regions of the sky where observations from the ground are limited or impossible, i. e. searching for objects close to the sun at elongation angles as low as 18 degrees; NIR spectroscopic survey of mainbelt asteroids; imaging of the hitherto unobserved hemisphere of Mercury;...|$|R
