6000|$|He {{used to talk}} {{to himself}} when he was little, but one day his mother said to him jokingly, [...] "Don't {{you know that he}} who talks to himself has the devil for a listener?" [...] and after that he never dared whisper above his breath when he was alone, though his father and mother had both taught him that there was no devil but his own evil will. He shuddered when he heard a dog howling in the night, for that was a sign that {{somebody}} was going to die. If he heard a hen crow, as a hen sometimes unnaturally would, he stoned her, because it was a sign of the worst kind of luck. He believed that warts came from playing with toads, but you could send them away by saying certain words over them; and he was sorry that he never had any warts, so that he could send them away, and see them go; but he never could bear to touch a toad, and so of course he could not have warts. Other boys played with toads just to show that they were not afraid of having warts; but every one knew that if you killed a toad, your cow would give bloody milk. I dare say the far forefathers of the race knew this too, when they first began to herd their kine in the birthplace of the Aryan peoples; and perhaps they learned then that if you killed a snake early in the day its tail would live till sundown. My boy killed every snake he could; he thought it somehow a duty; all the boys thought so; they dimly felt that they were making a just return to the serpent-tribe for the bad behavior of their ancestor in the Garden of Eden. Once, in a corn-field near the Little Reservoir, the boys found on a thawing day of early spring knots and bundles of snakes writhen and twisted together, in the torpor of their long winter sleep. It was a horrible sight, that afterwards haunted my boy's dreams. He had nightmares which remained as vivid in his thoughts as anything that happened to him by day. There were no poisonous snakes in the region of the Boy's Town, but there were some large blacksnakes, and the boys said that if a blacksnake got the chance he would run up your leg, and tie himself round your body so that you could not breathe. Nobody had ever seen a blacksnake do it, and nobody had ever seen a hoop-snake, but the boys believed there was such a snake, and that he would take his tail in his mouth, when he got after a person, and roll himself along swifter than the fastest race-horse could run. He did not bite, but when he came up with you he would take the point of his <b>tail</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> mouth and strike it into you. If he struck his tail into a tree, the tree would die. My boy had seen a boy who had been chased by a hoop-snake, but he had not seen the snake, though for the matter of that the boy who had been chased by it had not seen it either; he did not stop to see it. Another kind of snake that was very strange was a hair-snake. No one had ever seen it happen, but every one knew that if you put long horsehairs into a puddle of water and let them stay, they would turn into hair-snakes; and when you drank out of a spring you had {{to be careful not to}} swallow a hair-snake, or it would remain in your stomach and grow there.|$|E
5000|$|In {{his time}} at Louisiana Tech, Robertson {{completed}} 179 of 411 passing attempts for 2,237 yards. He threw 12 touchdowns, but had 34 interceptions. It was thought Robertson had {{the potential for a}} pro career, but Robertson was more interested in hunting. Bradshaw once remarked about Robertson's love of hunting, saying [...] "... Phil Robertson, loved hunting more than he loved football. He'd come to practice directly from the woods, squirrel <b>tails</b> hanging <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> pockets, duck feathers on his clothes. Clearly he was a fine shot, so no one complained too much." ...|$|R

50|$|The {{scene where}} Turles forces Gohan to {{transform}} into a Great Ape by holding {{his face and}} forcing {{him to keep his}} eyes open at the power ball was edited, but Turles held him by his shoulders instead. At the same time when Gohan looks at the power ball, absorbing its Blutz Waves through his eyes and beginning to transform into a Great Ape, no heartbeat sound effect were heard in the Japanese and English uncut versions, but were digitally edited in background in the English edited version. During that same scene, when Gohan's <b>tail</b> grows <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> pants after he was pinned to the ground by Turles, the sound effect of it ripping through his pants were also edited.|$|R
5000|$|Copeland {{began his}} CFL {{career with the}} Montreal Alouettes in 2001 and played six games. During that season, he also starred at wide {{receiver}} with the XFL's champion Los Angeles Xtreme. He {{was known for his}} flashy big plays and the famous long skull cap <b>tail</b> hanging <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> helmet during his time with the XFL. After beginning the 2002 season in the Dallas Cowboys' training camp, Copeland returned to the Alouettes and contributed to their Grey Cup championship that year. Copeland picked up CFL and CFLPA all-star honours in 2003 after piling up 99 receptions and 1,757 receiving yards. Along with teammate slotback Ben Cahoon, Copeland set a CFL record for most receiving yards by two teammates, amassing 3,318 yards between them. In 2004, Copeland was one of four receivers with the Alouettes to eclipse the 1,000-yard receiving mark (the others were Cahoon, Thyron Anderson, and Kwame Cavil), a CFL record which was repeated by the Alouettes the following year.|$|R

50|$|The {{bonefishes}} are brackish or {{saltwater fish}} typically living in estuaries and travelling {{out to sea}} to spawn on a lunar cycle. They feed in the shallow sand and mud flats, on benthic organisms, such as worms, mollusks, shrimp and crabs. They use their conical-shaped snouts to root out their prey and can often be seen with their <b>tails</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the water. Bonefishes possess crushing teeth in their palates.|$|R
60|$|A {{school of}} feeding {{bonefish}} came toward us. I counted eleven <b>tails</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the water. They were around my bait. Now or never, I thought, waiting frantically! But {{they went on}} feeding--passed over my line--and came so near the boat that I could plainly see the gray shadow shapes, the long, sharp noses, the dark, staring eyes. I reeled in to find my bait gone, as usual. It was exasperating.|$|R
60|$|Then Jone {{went on to}} {{say that}} of course he could not make head or <b>tail</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> such a story as that, but when he heard that an awful row had been kicked up in a garden he {{immediately}} thought that as like as not I was in it, and so he and Mr. Poplington ran back, leaving their bicycles against the hedge, and bringing the young man with them.|$|R
25|$|On {{the second}} attempt, Wendel {{solved the problem}} by tapping the aircraft's brakes at takeoff speed, lifting the {{horizontal}} <b>tail</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the wing's turbulence. The aforementioned initial four prototypes (V1-V4) were built with the conventional gear configuration. Changing to a tricycle arrangement—a permanently fixed undercarriage on the fifth prototype (V5, code PC+UE), with the definitive fully retractable nosewheel gear on the V6 (with Stammkennzeichen code VI+AA, from a new code block) and subsequent aircraft corrected this problem.|$|R
60|$|We couldn't make head nor <b>tail</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> it, but {{for some}} days arterward you'd ha' thought that Bob Pretty's 'ouse was a peep-show.

Then the old gentleman was seen one day as bold as brass sitting at the winder, and we heard that it was a pore old tramp Bob Pretty 'ad met on the road and given a home to, and he didn't like 'is good-'artedness to be known for fear he should be made fun of.|$|R

5000|$|Petronele's {{world is}} {{dominated}} by people. Figures are often depicted in motion and communicating {{with each other and}} the beholder. Her creative world encompasses whole human life with all its aspects, but most important subjects are woman’s fate and man's and woman’s relationship. These “eternal” subjects interpreted with understanding and humour, men are often ridiculed like in the picture “Picking Cherries”: calm, smiling woman pulls a man by the hand into a lake. “If a man is afraid, he can grab hold <b>of</b> a calf’s <b>tail</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> fear.” Petronele loved to paint piquant situations, love dramas and psychologically complicated situations.

But I'm afraid I haven't got the hang of everything yet.

60|$|Thus adjured, I {{started down}} the passage, and after about twenty paces found myself in a gloomy {{apartment}} some forty feet long, by thirty broad, and thirty high, which in some past age evidently had been hollowed, by hand-labour, <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the mountain. This apartment was not nearly so well lighted as the vast stalactite ante-cave, and at the first glance all I could discern was a massive stone table running down its length, with a colossal white figure at its head, and life-sized white figures all round it. Next I discovered a brown thing, seated {{on the table in}} the centre, and in another moment my eyes grew accustomed to the light, and I saw what all these things were, and was <b>tailing</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the place as hard as my legs could carry me.|$|R

60|$|He crept <b>out</b> <b>of</b> {{the hole}} and then just lay down and panted for breath. He was almost too tired to move. Then he began to spit sand <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> mouth and blow it <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> nose and try to wipe it <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> eyes. The long hair <b>of</b> <b>his</b> fine coat was filled full of sand {{and no one would}} ever have guessed that this was Reddy Fox.|$|R
60|$|In {{a moment}} he was all servility. The sneer passed <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> face, the arrogance <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> demeanour. He became as full of smiles and capers as the meanest sycophant.|$|R
60|$|And jealousy, {{stronger}} than all except fear, wore Neale <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> exaltation, <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> dream, <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> old disposition to work.

60|$|So saying, Stuyvesant {{slipped the}} {{squirrel}} into his jacket-pocket, leaving {{his head and}} the tip <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>tail</b> <b>out.</b> The squirrel being accustomed to such operations, remained perfectly still. Stuyvesant then found a board a little larger than {{the bottom of the}} squirrel's house, and putting this board upon the bench, he placed the house upon it. He then took Frink <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> pocket and slipped him into the door. He next put a block before the door to keep the squirrel from coming out, and then taking up the board by the two ends he carried it <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the shop.|$|R

I doubt if the reader knows the larva of the beetle called (I know not why) Dytiscus.
