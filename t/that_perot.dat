While many disaffected conservatives may have voted for Ross Perot to protest Bush's tax increase, further examination of the Perot vote in the Election Night exit polls not only showed <b>that</b> <b>Perot</b> siphoned votes nearly equally among Bush and Clinton, but of the voters who cited Bush's broken [...] "No New Taxes" [...] pledge as [...] "very important," [...] two thirds voted for Bill Clinton.|$|E

In the final round of Democratic and Republican primaries, most notably in California, exit polls revealed that 42% of Republicans and 33% of Democrats favored Perot. A Time Magazine poll found <b>that</b> <b>Perot</b> had 37% support of all the electorate, ahead of both Bush and Clinton who tied for second at 24%. At this time, Vice President Dan Quayle became the most senior member of the Bush administration to criticize Perot, calling him a [...] "temperamental tycoon".|$|E

Exit polls also showed <b>that</b> Ross <b>Perot</b> drew 38% of his vote from Bush, and 38% of his vote from Clinton, though it's generally considered that he aided Clinton in defeating Bush.|$|R

500|$|By mid-July, the Washington Post {{reported}} <b>that</b> <b>Perot's</b> campaign {{managers were}} becoming increasingly disillusioned by his unwillingness {{to follow their}} advice {{to be more specific}} on issues, and his need to be in full control of operations with such tactics as forcing volunteers to sign loyalty oaths. Perot's poll numbers began to slip to 25%, and his advisers warned that if he continued to ignore them, he would fall into single digits. Co-manager Hamilton Jordan threatened to quit, and on July 15, Ed Rollins resigned after Perot fired advertisement specialist Hal Riney, who worked with Rollins on the Reagan campaign. Rollins later claimed that a member of the campaign accused him of being a Bush plant with ties to the CIA. Amidst the chaos, Perot's support fell to 20%. The next day, Perot announced on Larry King Live that he would not seek the presidency. He explained {{that he did not want}} the House of Representatives to decide the election if the result caused the electoral college to be split. He asked his supporters to look for other candidates to nominate for the race, and formed United We Stand to [...] "influence the debate." [...] At this point, Perot had spent $12 million of his own money on the race. Bill Hillsman, who produced a few unaired advertisements for the campaign, wrote <b>that</b> <b>Perot's</b> withdrawal was a tactic to find temporary relief from the press.|$|R

500|$|By {{the end of}} October, Perot {{had reached}} 20% in opinion polls, and his favorability ratings {{slightly}} increased. But as reports detailed Perot's investigation of campaign volunteers and the prior use of [...] "loyalty oaths", the numbers remained stagnant.

Perot appeared on Larry King Live later in the week and opined that the early 1990s recession was not over [...] "because of deficit spending and competition for money". He was also interviewed on Talking with David Frost, where he affirmed a statement made by his running mate that the Vietnam War protests had prolonged the war effort. In the final days, it was estimated <b>that</b> <b>Perot</b> spent $5 million a day on advertisements. Overall, he had spent $40 million in October alone, and $60 million {{during the course of the}} campaign.|$|E
500|$|Trump's {{announcement}} made way for {{the anticipated}} Buchanan–Trump primary contest with Buchanan himself moving closer to mounting a Reform Party bid. [...] Buchanan announced he would decide whether to join the race by late October. A Schroth and Associates poll of 500 {{people who voted for}} Perot in 1996, showed Buchanan with a slight edge over Trump, 32 percent to 29 percent. Though Ventura wished to prevent a Buchanan nomination, he did not publicly endorse Trump. [...] Some of Ventura's advisers were skeptical of Trump's campaign and wanted Ventura to leave the party if a Buchanan nomination appeared imminent. [...] Ventura's place in the party had become a subject of controversy. [...] Chairman Verney asked Ventura to leave the party in early October after Ventura commented in a Playboy interview that [...] "organized religion is a sham and a crutch."

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. The Perot phenomenon in the presidential campaign of 1992 was generated by a unique confluence of events. The decline of the political parties, the rise of candidate-centered campaigns, and the wavering economy all contributed to an environment favorable to a third-party candidacy like Perot's. This thesis explores Perot's campaign rhetoric chronologically throughout 1992 's election season. Perot at once projected himself as "outside the beltway" by violating campaign rituals and as a candidate who understood the desires of the American electorate by utilizing the contemporary political version of the jeremiad to invoke the American dream. Through an examination of these elements, this thesis considers the rhetorical requirements <b>that</b> faced <b>Perot</b> as he competed in the election. It concludes <b>that</b> <b>Perot's</b> use of the jeremiad helped to compensate for his resection of the traditional political system so that he would appear as a justifiable selection for the office of President...|$|R
50|$|By 1997, {{factional}} disputes {{began to}} emerge with the departure {{of a small group}} <b>that</b> believed <b>Perot</b> had rigged the 1996 party primary to defeat Lamm. These individuals eventually established the American Reform Party. During this time, Perot himself chose to concentrate on lobbying efforts through United We Stand America.|$|R
500|$|Perot campaigned in California in mid-June, {{and held}} a rally {{attended}} by 7,000 in Sacramento where he was heckled by some who chanted [...] "Talk about the issues!" [...] He privately spoke with black and Asian leaders in Los Angeles to discuss race relations following the L.A. race riots; afterwards, he gave a speech to a mostly white audience in Orange County about race relations, but did not {{take a stand on}} affirmative action. Perot finished his California campaign swing in Irvine before traveling to events in Colorado and Massachusetts. At the end of the month, large nominating conventions were held in Washington and other states to put together the final pieces to include Perot on the ballot. Perot addressed the conventions, largely made up of [...] "well dressed, middle aged" [...] individuals, and spoke of improving the education system and restoring the America [...] "where you leave the doors unlocked". As June came to a close, speculation arose <b>that</b> <b>Perot</b> was planning a National Convention to follow the Democratic and Republican National Conventions.|$|E
500|$|By May, Perot {{was leading}} presidential polls in both Texas and California. The Bush and Clinton campaigns became {{concerned}} about a candidacy, and publicly wondered if Perot could continue to [...] "play by his own rules". They attempted to downgrade Perot from his [...] "folk hero status" [...] {{to that of a}} politician, by highlighting his [...] "alleged character flaws". Meanwhile, Perot focused on sharpening his political positions as he promised. He hired John P. White, who served as a budget official under President Jimmy Carter, to work on his budget platform. Meanwhile, petition drives in every state reported that they had secured enough signatures to place Perot on the Election Day ballot. Speculation arose in the media <b>that</b> <b>Perot</b> would split the electoral college and force the United States House of Representatives to decide the presidency. Around this time, Hal Riney, who had worked on Ronald Reagan's 1984 campaign and was known for the [...] "Morning in America" [...] ad, was hired as advertising consultant. When Riney revealed the cost of advertisements during a meeting, Perot reportedly [...] "flipped out", and asked [...] "Why would I spend that when I could go on the 'Today' show for free?" [...] Riney produced several ads during the campaign that never aired.|$|E
500|$|Former advisors commented <b>that</b> <b>Perot,</b> who had {{achieved}} ballot access in 24 states, was unwilling [...] "to {{spend money on}} things that mattered" [...] including Rollins' and Jordan's proposed $150 million advertising campaign, was [...] "obsessed" [...] with his image, and lost interest in running after receiving negative press. Supporters were angry and distraught at Perot's decision, and his popularity dropped among the American public. One woman called Perot and commented that [...] "the tears have not stopped." [...] A class action lawsuit was filed in Florida {{to force him to}} remain in the race, but it was dropped. Later in July, the economic plan that Perot's campaign had been working on was released. The fifty-page proposal included cuts in domestic spending, investment in education, communication and transportation programs, an increase in income taxes for the wealthy, and an increase in the gasoline tax. The plan was projected to eliminate the budget deficit in five years. [...] At the end of August, Perot promised to give his endorsement to any candidate that supported his economic plan, but hinted that he may reenter the race. These hints increased in September, as Perot looked to buy advertising time on the major networks to discuss his economic plan, which could only occur if he was a declared candidate. Meanwhile, petitions for ballot access were approved in all 50 states, and polls showed Perot still in double digits with 14% support, behind Clinton and Bush with 44% and 39%, respectively.|$|E
2500|$|In June, Perot led a Gallup poll with 39% of the vote. By mid-July, the Washington Post {{reported}} <b>that</b> <b>Perot's</b> campaign {{managers were}} becoming increasingly disillusioned by his unwillingness {{to follow their}} advice {{to be more specific}} on issues, and his need to be in full control of operations with such tactics as forcing volunteers to sign loyalty oaths.

The next day, Perot announced on Larry King Live that he would not seek the presidency. He explained {{that he did not want}} the House of Representatives to decide the election if the result caused the electoral college to be split. Perot eventually stated the reason was that he received threats that digitally altered photographs would be released by the Bush campaign to sabotage his daughter's wedding. Whatever his reasons for withdrawing, his reputation was badly damaged. Many of his supporters felt betrayed and public opinion polls [...] subsequently showed a large negative view of <b>Perot</b> <b>that</b> was absent prior to his decision to end the campaign.|$|R
500|$|On October 1, Perot re-entered {{the presidential}} race, {{with a desire}} to further explain his {{economic}} plans to the American people. The New York Times commented <b>that</b> <b>Perot's</b> [...] "chances of winning are much less than when he quit in July. His only dim practical hope is to confuse and destabilize the contest." [...] He hoped to spend more resources using paid advertisements than holding traditional rallies to spread his message. During the last month of campaigning, Perot left his headquarters in Dallas only to appear in the presidential debates and seven rallies. One aide later commented: [...] "he wanted to do it just like he could go to the office every day, run for president, and go home and eat dinner." [...] Rather than using professional advisers, Perot employed [...] "political amateurs" [...] whose loyalty was unquestioned. Orson Swindle, whom he had known since the 1970s, was hired as the top aide. Perot's son-in-law Clayton Mulford, who was involved in the early draft effort, was hired as legal adviser. Sharon Holman, who worked for Perot since 1969, was hired as press secretary, and friend Murphy Martin was added as the media chief.|$|R
500|$|Ross Perot {{appeared}} on the February 20 edition of Larry King Live on CNN, his fourth appearance on the show since 1991.

[...] <b>Perot</b> firmly stated <b>that</b> {{he did not want}} to run, but spontaneously affirmed that he would begin a campaign if [...] "ordinary people" [...] signed petitions and helped him achieve ballot access in all 50 states. He set up a phone bank at his office on March 12, staffed with volunteers to inform interested voters and supporters on how they could assist Perot's potential campaign. Supporters viewed the candidate as an [...] "action man... who can get things done... takes care of his people". They were angry at President Bush for reneging on [...] The New York Times speculated <b>that</b> <b>Perot's</b> [...] "iconoclastic, take-no-prisoners persona and anti-politics politics" [...] would appeal to the [...] "angry frustrated electorate". But Republican consultant Karl Rove characterized Perot as an [...] "untested wild man". He rejected any financial donations for more than $5, and stated that he would personally fund a potential campaign. Perot spent $400,000 of his own money in the first month, however, he largely spread this message via television, capped by a March 18 National Press Club speech, which aired on C-SPAN.|$|R
500|$|In July, some of Perot's past actions, {{including}} a private {{investigation of the}} Bush family in the late 1980s, circulated in the media, causing frustration for the campaign. Perot blamed the reports on a [...] "Republican research team" [...] and claimed that he was warned that since {{he had such a}} [...] "clean record they have got to try to redefine you and destroy you". Campaign officials tried {{to come up with a}} new strategy to combat the negative press, and to end Perot's use of generalizations on the issues. Perot sought National Institutes of Health head Dr. Bernadine Healy as his running mate, but she declined. Meanwhile, Perot faced obstacles on the campaign trail. During an Olympia rally, he was approached by a gay rights group, demanding that he address AIDS and gay rights; he soon flipped on the issue and stated that he would allow gays to serve in the military and in his cabinet. During an address to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), Perot faced his toughest demographic, and made the gaffe of referring to African Americans as [...] "you people". It was later revealed <b>that</b> <b>Perot</b> did not want to appear at the meeting or any other forum without his supporters. Press consultant Squires had written a speech for Perot for the occasion, but he instead used his own. After the speech, Perot was concerned that members of the New Black Panther Party were plotting his assassination.|$|E

For Bush to earn a majority of the popular vote, he would have needed 12.2% of Perot's 18.9% of the vote, 65% of Perot's support base. State exit polls suggested <b>that</b> <b>Perot</b> did not alter the electoral college count, except potentially in one state (Ohio), which nonetheless showed a result in the margin of error.
