5|$|Tropical Storm Bonnie {{was a small}} {{tropical}} storm that made landfall on Florida in August 2004. The second storm of the 2004 Atlantic hurricane season, Bonnie developed from a tropical wave on August 3 {{to the east of}} the Lesser Antilles. After moving through the islands, its fast forward motion caused it to dissipate. However, it later regenerated into a {{tropical storm}} near the Yucatán Peninsula. Bonnie attained peak winds of 65mph (100km/h) over the Gulf of Mexico, turned to <b>the</b> <b>northeast,</b> <b>and</b> hit Florida as a 45mph (75km/h) tropical storm. The storm accelerated to <b>the</b> <b>northeast</b> <b>and</b> became an extratropical cyclone to the east of New Jersey. Bonnie was the first of five tropical systems to make landfall on Florida in the 2004 Atlantic hurricane season, and the second of a record eight disturbances to reach tropical storm strength during the month of August.|$|E

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave spawned Tropical Storm Dean on August 22 {{over the}} Lesser Antilles. Strong wind shear quickly weakened Dean to {{cause it to}} dissipate on August 23. The remnants turned northward, and redeveloped on August 26 {{to the north of}} Bermuda. Located over warm waters and in an area of favorable conditions, Dean steadily strengthened while moving to <b>the</b> <b>northeast,</b> <b>and</b> peaked just below hurricane status on August 27 southwest of Newfoundland. The storm subsequently weakened over cooler waters, and became extratropical on August 28. Tropical Storm Dean lightly affected Newfoundland, though no damages were reported.|$|E
5|$|After landfall, the cyclone {{accelerated}} in {{forward speed}} northward, weakening in intensity, and, by 1200UTC on October 12, Marco became an extra-tropical cyclone. It turned to <b>the</b> <b>northeast</b> <b>and</b> east through South Carolina, following behind Hurricane Lili to its northeast. For a time, the system's proximity to Lili resulted in hints of the Fujiwhara effect, {{in which two}} tropical cyclone appear to rotate around each other. The cold front that absorbed the weakening low was to the storm's north on October 13, though moisture from the remnants of Marco dropped heavy rainfall across the southeast United States for another day.|$|E
