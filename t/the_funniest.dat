25|$|Each New Girl episode {{starts out}} as a pitch page, goes through stages of an outline and a final draft before being filmed and edited, a process which may take weeks. Each stage is {{approved}} by Meriwether and her co-showrunners, by the production company Chernin, the Fox studio and the Fox network. One group of writers works on alternate punchlines ("alts"), while another group rebreaks a draft until they find <b>the</b> <b>funniest</b> and most emotionally resonant version. All characters are tried to be tied into the story, and determining their motivation is the major goal so that people will laugh. Before taking the script to the table read with the whole cast on Tuesday, the main writers of an episode continue working on the draft {{over the weekend and}} the executive producers polish it. During the first season, Meriwether usually made a final pass at the draft alone because of her film and theater background. The actors' performance influences new story ideas; the actors may also hand in story ideas.|$|E
