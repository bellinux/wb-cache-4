40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} the main ethical aspects concerning <b>the</b> Romanian <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> intermediation sector. <b>The</b> analysis tries to evaluate the true utility of <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> agents’ services and to assess the potential negative effects of an unethical behavior for the clients. In Romanian <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> market, {{there are at least three}} issues that endanger the business ethics of intermediaries. First, as the prices increase very fast, the transactions involve larger and larger amounts of money that attract entrepreneurs with weak intrinsic ethical standards. Very often, they fail to understand the instrumental value of business ethics too. Thus, instead of building a reputation in the market they prefer an immediate gain. Secondly, <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> brokerage is poorly regulated in Romania. According to the motto “if not forbidden, it's permitted”, <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>agents</b> adopted very lax ethical standards. The third factor is the deficit of public information regarding <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> market and <b>the</b> activity of <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>agents.</b> <b>The</b> press usually reproduces the views of leading <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>agents,</b> instead of providing authentic investigations of their services. The main conclusion is that there is evidence that <b>the</b> Romanian <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>agents</b> try to maximize their profits by manipulating the economic environment rather than providing valuable services for their clients. business ethics, <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>agent,</b> rent-seeking, reservation price, moral hazard...|$|R
