5|$|The {{recorded}} {{conversation was}} a critical aspect of Jackson's defense against the upcoming allegation made against him. He and his supporters argue that he was <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> jealous father whose only goal was to extort money from the singer. In October 1994, Mary A. Fischer of GQ magazine reported it was Evan Chandler who initially accused Jackson of molesting his son, before he demanded a screenwriting deal from Jackson {{instead of going to}} the police.|$|E

5|$|At a Sunday {{church service}} in mid-December, in what Marshall {{believed}} {{was an attempt}} by other officials {{to force him to}} assume the presidency, a courier brought a message informing him that Wilson had died. Marshall was shocked, and rose to announce the news to the congregation. The ministers held a prayer, the congregation began singing hymns, and many people wept. Marshall and his wife exited the building, and made a call to the White House to determine his next course of action, only to find that he had been <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> hoax, and that Wilson was still living.|$|E
5|$|Chris is Neighbours second ongoing {{homosexual}} character, {{following the}} introduction of Lana Crawford in 2004. Neighbours has featured a few short-term or minor male gay characters before for plot points or small story arcs, but Chris is the first male gay character {{to be given a}} prominent role. The first minor male gay characters to appear were Andrew MacKenzie (John Morris) and Alf Taylor (Frank Bren) in 1994. The following year a gay schoolteacher, Andrew Watson (Chris Uhlman), became <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> dismissal campaign by his pupils. Hairdresser Gino Esposito (Shane McNamara) was often hinted at being gay.|$|E
5|$|Given the {{propensity}} of the Macedonian aristocracy to assassination, foul play featured in multiple accounts of his death. Diodorus, Plutarch, Arrian and Justin all mentioned {{the theory that}} Alexander was poisoned. Justin stated that Alexander was <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> poisoning conspiracy, Plutarch dismissed it as a fabrication, while both Diodorus and Arrian noted that they mentioned it only {{for the sake of}} completeness. The accounts were nevertheless fairly consistent in designating Antipater, recently removed as Macedonian viceroy, and at odds with Olympias, {{as the head of the}} alleged plot. Perhaps taking his summons to Babylon as a death sentence, and having seen the fate of Parmenion and Philotas, Antipater purportedly arranged for Alexander to be poisoned by his son Iollas, who was Alexander's wine-pourer. There was even a suggestion that Aristotle may have participated.|$|E

5|$|In 1862, Grand Duke Constantine Nikolaievich was {{appointed}} viceroy of Russian Poland {{by his brother}} and moved to Warsaw {{with his wife and}} children. The stay in Poland proved difficult for the Grand Duke, who was <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> nationalist assassination attempt the day after his arrival in the Polish capital. Although Constantine embarked on a program of liberalization and re-instated Polish as an official language, Polish nationalists agitating for reform were not appeased. Finally, an uprising in January 1863 and the radicalization of the separatists pushed the Tsar to recall his brother in August. Olga's difficult experiences in Poland marked her profoundly.|$|E
5|$|In February 1828, Martin Harris {{arrived to}} assist Smith by transcribing his dictation. Harris {{also took a}} sample of the {{characters}} to a few prominent scholars, including Charles Anthon. Harris said Anthon initially authenticated the characters and their translation, but then retracted his opinion after learning that Smith claimed to have received the plates from an angel. Anthon denied Harris's account of the meeting, claiming instead that he had tried to convince Harris that he was <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> fraud. In any event, Harris returned to Harmony in April 1828, and continued as Smith's scribe.|$|E
5|$|Ranavalona died {{without ever}} having {{returned}} to Madagascar, after two formal requests in 1910 and 1912 were refused on the pretext of insufficient funds in the colonial coffers. The exiled queen died suddenly at her villa in Algeria on May 23, 1917, <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> severe embolism. Ranavalona was buried at the Saint-Eugene cemetery in Algiers at 10:00a.m. on May 25.

5|$|STRIKE's {{victory in}} the Black Sea leads them to the Caucasus, where Sadissa Savak, leader of the fictional state of Irek, begins {{aggressive}} overtures against local fighters. In the mission (which is supposedly north of the main battle area where Desert Strike took place), the player and Amad join forces with a militia run by Amad's relatives in stopping Ireki troops from capturing an ex-Soviet chemical weapons plant. With STRIKE killing Savak (and passed off as <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> car crash), the group goes to a heavily irradiated Transylvania to rescue Nick once more, this time from Dr Grymyenko Ukrainian, who wields an arsenal of ballistic missiles. The player is also tasked to kill the Shadowman's lead armor commander, Vila, who operates a special red-turreted T-80, and aid {{in the destruction of}} an abandoned nuclear reactor the Shadowman is planning to use.|$|E
5|$|Carmella is {{introduced}} as a barmaid at the Erinsborough bar Lou's Place. She becomes romantically involved with her colleague, Connor O'Neill (Patrick Harvey), to the disapproval {{of her father}} Rocco (Robert Forza). A feud with Connor's ex-girlfriend, Michelle Scully (Kate Keltie), results in Carmella slapping her and leaving the area. She later returns in 2004, reconciles with Connor and helps him to maintain access to his daughter Madeleine (Madison Lu). To prove that she is business-minded, Carmella becomes a magazine editor. She departs from Erinsborough suddenly after she becomes <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> stalker, Frank Romano (Lliam Amor). Before she leaves, she drives around with a shotgun {{in an attempt to}} kill Frank. Upon her return, Carmella loses Connor's affection to Serena Bishop (Lara Sacher). She attempts to ruin their relationship, which results in Serena's mother Liljana (Marcella Russo) slapping her to warn her off. Carmella then tries a different approach; she borrows money from her mother Lucia (Maria Mercedes) to pay for an operation Madeleine needs, then blackmails Connor into spending time with her. She claims to have borrowed the money from a crime mob who are harassing her for repayment, which prompts Connor to steal money to try to pay it back. When Carmella realises the trouble she has caused, she tells Connor the truth and leaves.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to having}} severe PTSD and {{being unable to}} do her job {{correctly}} anymore, Cristina quits and begins bartending and eventually throws a housewarming party. Derek helps Cristina emotionally and she ultimately decides {{to go to work}} after helping <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> school shooting. Yang discovers she is pregnant with Hunt's child, and decides to get an abortion. Though Hunt accompanies her to the abortion, he is extremely angry with her decision. Yang then operates on Henry Burton (Scott Foley), Altman's husband, unknown of his identity. When the surgery fails and he dies, Yang is guilt stricken upon learning of her patient's identity. Altman forgives Yang and forces Yang to realize that she did everything possible. Altman's mentorship of Yang is punishing at times, and Altman brutally emphasizes that Yang must learn patience, compassion, and the basics over the flashy surgeries Yang prefers. Altman's tutelage is successful, and Yang evolves into an aware and well-rounded surgeon because of it. Altman allows Yang {{to come up with a}} wish list of dream surgeries to fulfill before Altman resigns and moves on.|$|E

5|$|In July 2016 García, who was Real Sociedad's only {{representative}} in the squad, captained Spain to {{a silver medal}} at the UEFA Women's Under-19 Championship, losing 2–1 in the final to hosts France. She had two opportunities to draw Spain level but found herself <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> waterlogged pitch, missing a penalty in the opening half before skying a near-open goal opportunity in injury-time {{as a result of}} the on-field conditions. The match was suspended for over two hours after half-time due to the weather conditions and upon the players' return to the pitch certain sections of the field were entirely waterlogged. García was ridiculed by large sections of the media for the miss but received overwhelming support from her fan-base, prompting her to take to Instagram following the tournament to thank those who stood behind her and the team. The showpiece match was her third appearance in a continental final, having previously ended as runner-up in the tournament's previous edition and as well as in the UEFA Women's Under-17 Championship in 2014. The record is one which she shares with teammates Andrea Sánchez Falcón and Naria Garrote.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, Berry bought the Southern Air, a {{restaurant}} in Wentzville, Missouri. In 1990 he was sued by several women who claimed that he had installed a video camera in the bathroom. Berry claimed {{that he had the}} camera installed to catch a worker who was suspected of stealing from the restaurant. Though his guilt was never proved in court, Berry opted for a class action settlement. (One of the biographers, Bruce Pegg, estimated that, with 59 women, it cost Berry over $1.2 million plus legal fees.). His lawyers said he had been <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> conspiracy to profit from his wealth. During this time Berry began using Wayne T. Schoeneberg as his legal counsel. Reportedly, a police raid on his house found intimate videotapes of women, one of whom being apparently a minor. Also found in the raid were 62grams of marijuana. Felony drug and child-abuse charges were filed. As the child-abuse charges were dropped, Berry agreed to plead guilty to misdemeanor possession of marijuana. He was given a six-month suspended jail sentence and two years' unsupervised probation and was ordered to donate $5,000 to a local hospital.|$|E
5|$|Through {{the early}} part of 2006, Massaro became <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> series of attacks from Mickie James. At the Royal Rumble, James {{defeated}} Massaro with then Women's Champion, Trish Stratus, as the special guest referee. Massaro got her revenge one week later by pinning James in the rematch on Raw. During the February 20, 2006 edition of Raw, however, Massaro suffered a fractured left fibula while being eliminated from the Women's Battle Royal, and her feud with James was cut short. She underwent surgery to insert a five-inch metal plate and eight screws into her leg. During her recovery, Massaro still occasionally appeared on Raw as part of the Stratus/James feud, albeit in a non-active role. Massaro returned on the March 20, 2006 episode of Raw, being kidnapped by James to lure Stratus in to saving her but James was successful and attacked Stratus.|$|E

5|$|Fernando Alonso's luck finally ran out in Japan; {{having spent}} most of the season {{profiting}} from poor results from his rivals when he needed them the most, Alonso was <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> dramatic first corner clash, spinning out when he made contact with Kimi Räikkönen and paving the way for his championship rivals to make considerable inroads into his twenty-nine-point championship lead. Mark Webber was also caught up in the opening lap melee when he was hit by Romain Grosjean; Webber was forced to pit straight away, while Grosjean was given a ten-second stop-go penalty for causing yet another first lap incident. Bruno Senna also ran afoul of the stewards, hitting Nico Rosberg whilst trying to avoid Grosjean and Webber and earning a drive-through penalty for his troubles while Rosberg retired on the spot. Sergio Pérez added his name to the growing list of early retirements when he slid off at the hairpin under brakes and into the gravel trap whilst trying to force his way past a struggling Lewis Hamilton. Sebastian Vettel won the race from pole position, having led every lap of the race and setting the fastest lap time in the process to complete his second Grand Chelem. Felipe Massa finished second, his first podium result since the 2010 Korean Grand Prix, whilst Kamui Kobayashi claimed the first podium of his career – and the first podium for a Japanese driver at the Suzuka Circuit since Aguri Suzuki finished third in 1990 – after withstanding late pressure from Jenson Button.|$|E
5|$|Loxton had an {{unproductive}} {{time during the}} 1950–51 Australian season. He lost his Test place after three matches, and in Sheffield Shield games his highest score for the season was just 62. In the first match of the season, he made four for Victoria against Freddie Brown's touring team, a portent of the coming season. However, he did bounce back in the final match before the Tests, scoring 62 and 37 and taking 3/24 against New South Wales. The First Test of the Ashes series at Brisbane was decided largely by a tropical storm that completely {{changed the nature of}} the pitch after the first day. The Australian all-rounder had by then been <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> spectacular catch by England wicket-keeper Godfrey Evans, making 24 in Australia's 228. He picked up five catches—his first Test catches in his tenth match—as the Australians surrounded the English batsmen, who made 7/68 on the sticky wicket before Brown declared to force the Australian batsmen to suffer on the treacherous surface. Loxton was out for a duck in the second innings, unable to cope with the conditions, as did most of his compatriots. Australia collapsed to 3/0 before reaching 7/32, at which point Hassett declared after 78 minutes of batting. England fell to 6/30 at stumps in pursuit of 193. Twenty wickets had fallen in four hours, while only 102 runs had been scored. Australia eventually won the match by 71 runs.|$|E
